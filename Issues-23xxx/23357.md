On FreeBSD with CC=clang-3.8 this is problematic if I set `SAGE_FAT_BINARY=yes`, that is, will have

```
GF2X_CONFIGURE="--disable-hardware-specific-code $GF2X_CONFIGURE"

Have I removed too many patches?

gf2x puts its config.log at the normal place in the build tree.

Ok. Gentoo does just plain `configure && make && make install` but sage's package by default does

```
configure
make
make tune-lowlevel && make tune-toom TOOM_TUNING_LIMIT=100
make install
```
You have alternatives to do nothing or replace the tuning bit by

```
make tune-lowlevel && make tune-toom && make tune-fft
```
Are you saying that's just a waste of time :)

Well, as a matter of fact, tuning is much faster in 1.2, time considerations probably lead to `TOOM_TUNING_LIMIT=100` (I don't speak from authority, that's my guess), and I think we should at least drop it in 1.2. The FFT tuning on the other hand runs and runs.... forever.

Have a good night.

hopefully the last commit summarises the discussion right.
I have also removed the time limit `TOOM_TUNING_LIMIT=100`, it still builds in 2 minutes on my Linux desktop, with default settings.

I also checked that with `SAGE_FAT_BINARY=yes` it builds (very fast), and with 
`SAGE_TUNE_GF2X="full"` (triggering FFT tuning) it takes about 45 minutes to complete.
