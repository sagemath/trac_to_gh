On FreeBSD with CC=clang-3.8 this is problematic if I set `SAGE_FAT_BINARY=yes`, that is, will have

Have I removed too many patches?

Ok. Gentoo does just plain `configure && make && make install` but sage's package by default does

```
configure
make
make tune-lowlevel && make tune-toom TOOM_TUNING_LIMIT=100
make install
```
You have alternatives to do nothing or replace the tuning bit by

```
make tune-lowlevel && make tune-toom && make tune-fft

More precisely: I have no objection if you try to run some tuning before creating the binary package, but you don't have to.

There's probably less craftsmanship in the tuning thresholds of gf2x than with, e.g., gmp. But the default should nevertheless be fine.

In fact, doing limited tuning with `TOOM_TUNING_LIMIT=100` probably does more harm than good, since the default tables are computed with a larger limit.

Well, as a matter of fact, tuning is much faster in 1.2, time considerations probably lead to `TOOM_TUNING_LIMIT=100` (I don't speak from authority, that's my guess), and I think we should at least drop it in 1.2. The FFT tuning on the other hand runs and runs.... forever.

hopefully the last commit summarises the discussion right.
I have also removed the time limit `TOOM_TUNING_LIMIT=100`, it still builds in 2 minutes on my Linux desktop, with default settings.

I also checked that with `SAGE_FAT_BINARY=yes` it builds (very fast), and with 
`SAGE_TUNE_GF2X="full"` (triggering FFT tuning) it takes about 45 minutes to complete.
