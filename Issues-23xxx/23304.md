<div id="comment:10" align="right">comment:10</div>

I think that using `hold=true` should give the same result as using a hold context:

```
sage: with hold:
....:     (x + 1/3).power(2).mul(2)
2*(x + 1/3)^2
```
But the proposed doctest validates `2*(1/9*(3*x + 1)^2)`, so I don't think we want this doctest.

Ginac (and therefore pynac) was not designed with "hold" in mind (see also #31597), so I think it will take considerable effort to fix the many problems, but fixing the specific problem on this ticket might not be hard.  I might have time to work on these issues in the next few months, but it's great if someone else wants to do it.

One possibility would be to have two tickets: one ticket to add a doctest for the hold context right now (because it already gives a good answer), and another ticket (which will remain open) for fixing `hold = true`.
