This ticket implements a method `reverse_rows_and_columns`

```
sage: m = matrix(ZZ, 2, 3, range(6))
sage: m.reverse_rows_and_columns()
sage: m
[5 4 3]
[2 1 0]
```

Needed in #22841.

Note: in `numpy` they rather use `flip` (that return a copy) and Python list uses `reverse`

The row-and-column-reversed matrix of `M` is defined as:

.. MATH::

    (i,j) \mapsto M[nrows - i - 1, ncols - j - 1]

In other words, this function flips `M` up to down and left to right.
