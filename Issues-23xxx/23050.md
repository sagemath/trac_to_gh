This ticket implements a method `reverse_rows_and_columns`

```
sage: m = matrix(ZZ, 2, 3, range(6))
sage: m.reverse_rows_and_columns()
sage: m
[5 4 3]
[2 1 0]
```

Needed in #22841.

Note: in `numpy` they rather use `flip` (that return a copy) and Python list uses `reverse`

salut Vincent, i saw your cool function, maybe you can paste this too or similar:

```
The row-and-column-reversed matrix of `M` is defined as:

.. MATH::

    (i,j) \mapsto M[nrows - i - 1, ncols - j - 1]

In other words, this function flips `M` up to down and left to right.
```

Looks and works nice. Thank you! Just two minor comments:

1. Docstrings better to be consistent in the three methods. Note the period at the end.

```
Reverse the orders of rows and columns.
```

2. You may want to also show the matrices before reversing in some of the examples.

Sorry, it is different: transpose and antitranspose does inverse rows <-> columns. They are symmetries with respect to diagonals. However, both transpose and antitranspose return a different matrix. It would be weird to have a different behavior for reverse.

I propose to have
- `transpose`, `antitranspose`, `reverse` as methods returning a different matrix
- `_transpose_inplace`, `_antitranspose_inplace` and `_reverse_inplace` that modifies the matrix

```
sage: import numpy as np
sage: a = numpy.array([[0,1],[2,3],[4,5]])
sage: np.flip(np.flip(a,0), 1)
