This ticket implements a method `reverse_rows_and_columns`

```
sage: m = matrix(ZZ, 2, 3, range(6))
sage: m.reverse_rows_and_columns()
sage: m
[5 4 3]
[2 1 0]
```

Needed in #22841.

Note: in `numpy` they rather use `flip` (that return a copy) and Python list uses `reverse`

<a id='comment:2'></a>salut Vincent, i saw your cool function, maybe you can paste this too or similar:

```
The row-and-column-reversed matrix of `M` is defined as:

.. MATH::

    (i,j) \mapsto M[nrows - i - 1, ncols - j - 1]

In other words, this function flips `M` up to down and left to right.

```
sage: import numpy as np
sage: a = numpy.array([[0,1],[2,3],[4,5]])
sage: np.flip(np.flip(a,0), 1)
array([[5, 4],
       [3, 2],
       [1, 0]])
```
