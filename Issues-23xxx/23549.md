The Apple-supplied /usr/bin/as is apparently crap:
* https://github.com/wbhart/mpir/issues/217
* https://trac.macports.org/ticket/51642#comment:10
The workarounds are either `CFLAGS=-Wa,-q` or set the confusingly-named environment variable
`AS_INTEGRATED_ASSEMBLER=1` to use the clang assembler.

We use to have `-Wa,-q` in other places I am sure - but it seems to have gone. I like the idea of the environment variable but it probably wouldn't work while using gcc, not sure what `-Wa,-q` would do with gcc either.

OK I have just done a test with `mpir` that is the case at hand on sage-devel. `-Wa,-q` is very nice but doesn't work when gcc is actually clang provided by OS X. Which is the case on OS X when you bootstrap the compiler.
