It is not uncommon for pip package names to have `-` in the name, e.g. `sphinxcontrib-websupport` that popped up on #14645.
However, currently there is no way to have Sage package of type `pip`
that would be the equivalent of the explicit call

```
./sage --pip install sphinxcontrib-websupport
```
as `-` is not allowed in Sage package names, at least
an attempt to specify `sphinxcontrib-websupport` in a Sage package
dependencies produces an error.

**this** is an ability to specify the (external) pip package name which is not equal to the Sage package name of type pip. Such an ability would allow handling `-` in the (external) pip package names.

But I have no idea where things dealing with packages of type `pip` are handled in the build system and how - thus I ask for some pointers to the latter.

Well, one person's wishlist might be another person's won't fix, I really don't see the rush behind closing this. 

The choice of '-' as a separator between the version and and the package name was not fortunate, this is clear.

There is also not much point in keeping wishlist tickets open that nobody is ever going to work on. If you really want to fix this, you can always reopen the ticket or create a new one.
