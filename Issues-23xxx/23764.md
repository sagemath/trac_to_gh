It is not uncommon for pip package names to have `-` in the name, e.g. `sphinxcontrib-websupport` that popped up on #14645.
However, currently there is no way to have Sage package of type `pip`
that would be the equivalent of the explicit call

```
./sage --pip install sphinxcontrib-websupport
```
as `-` is not allowed in Sage package names, at least
an attempt to specify `sphinxcontrib-websupport` in a Sage package
dependencies produces an error.

**this** is an ability to specify the (external) pip package name which is not equal to the Sage package name of type pip. Such an ability would allow handling `-` in the (external) pip package names.

But I have no idea where things dealing with packages of type `pip` are handled in the build system and how - thus I ask for some pointers to the latter.

We still can, say, parse `ls SAGE_ROOT/build/pkgs/` for the list of package names, which could have `-` in them, and then build a list of pairs (package_name,package_version) by looking at `SAGE_ROOT/build/pkgs/<package_name>/package-version.txt`.
