```
sage: R.<x> = Qp(3)[];
sage: f = R(x^2 - 3);
sage: K = R.extension(f,'a');
sage: K.base_ring() 
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over 3-adic Field with capped relative precision 20
sage: K.is_field()
False
```

However in the documentation of base_ring

```
sage: R.<z> = PolynomialRing(ZZ)
sage: S.<beta> = R.quotient(z^3 + z^2 + z + 1)
sage: S.base_ring()
Integer Ring
```
