CC:  @kiwifb @embray

An update to gc is needed to support arm64/aarch64, see #23687,
as well as for FreeBSD support, see #22679.
It also appears to be good to be in sync with Linux boxes that ship make with guile extension (the latter depends on gc, and causes interesting errors, see #24575).

The source is here:
https://github.com/ivmai/bdwgc/releases/download/v7.6.4/gc-7.6.4.tar.gz

On some platforms this new version also needs libatomic_ops, see #23701

It's not cleaner than before since the branch didn't change. The fact that #23701 was merged does mean that the diff is easier to read on Trac.

Erik, does the branch work on Cygwin for you now? (You never answered comment 34 above).
