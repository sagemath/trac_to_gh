```
sage: M = matroids.Uniform(3,5)
sage: M.rank(list(x for x in range(5)))
3
sage: M.rank(x for x in range(5))  # expected 3 here
0
```

To fix this, I propose to replace all boilerplate of the form

```
        if X is None:
            X = self.groundset()
        else:
            if not self.groundset().issuperset(X):
                raise ValueError("input is not a subset of the 
groundset.")
        X = frozenset(X)
```
by a one-liner

```
        X = self.__subset_all(X)
```
or

```
        X = self.__subset(X)
```
where `X = None` means `self.groundset()` for the first variant.
