__Issues__

- Currently, sage.algebras.finite_dimensional_algebras.finite_dimensional_algebra_element is Python.

- Multiplication is implemented by

```
self.__class__(self.parent(), self._vector * other._matrix)
```
  which for *some* matrix implementations is not the fastest way:

```
sage: v = random_vector(GF(2),2000)
sage: M = random_matrix(GF(2),2000,2000)
sage: %timeit v*M
The slowest run took 8.27 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
100 loops, best of 3: 4.96 ms per loop
sage: %timeit M*v
1000 loops, best of 3: 172 µs per loop
sage: v = random_vector(GF(3),2000)
sage: M = random_matrix(GF(3),2000,2000)
sage: %timeit v*M
The slowest run took 37.59 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000 loops, best of 3: 1.11 ms per loop
sage: %timeit M*v
1000 loops, best of 3: 974 µs per loop
sage: v = random_vector(QQ,2000)
sage: M = random_matrix(QQ,2000,2000)
sage: %timeit v*M
1 loop, best of 3: 1.51 s per loop
sage: %timeit M*v
1 loop, best of 3: 3.32 s per loop
sage: v = random_vector(GF(9,'x'),2000)
sage: M = random_matrix(GF(9,'x'),2000,2000)
sage: %timeit v*M
1 loop, best of 3: 163 ms per loop
sage: %timeit M*v
1 loop, best of 3: 166 ms per loop
```
  (**Remark**: The timings for `GF(9,'x')` are with MeatAxe)

- vector*matrix respectively matrix*vector may be a lot slower than matrix*matrix:

```
sage: M = random_matrix(GF(9,'x'),2000,2000)
sage: v = random_matrix(GF(9,'x'),2000,1)
sage: %timeit M*v
10 loops, best of 3: 52.4 ms per loop
sage: v1 = v.transpose()
sage: %timeit v1*M
The slowest run took 37.36 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
10000 loops, best of 3: 14.6 µs per loop
```
  The last example is 163 ms vs. 14.6 µs!!!

- In my applications, I need finite dimensional path algebra quotients. The current implementation corresponds to a finite dimensional path algebra quotient where the underlying quiver has a single vertex.

- Creation of an element also involves construction of its multiplication matrix. From my experience, it can be faster (in some applications) to not construct the matrix of it right away, but be lazy. E.g., when one computes Gröbner bases, only multiplication by power products of the algebra generators are needed, and then it is faster to map the defining vector of the element repeatedly by multiplying with the matrices of the generators, instead of doing matrix by matrix multiplications.

__Suggestion__

1. Re-implement it in Cython
2. Replace vector*matrix by either row*matrix or matrix*column, being flexible enough that *both* implementations are supported (because it depends on the field whether row*matrix or matrix*column is fastest).
3. Allow using a quiver with more than one vertices.
4. Be more lazy, i.e. do costly computations such as the construction of the multiplication matrix only when needed.

This ticket is not necessarily about basic arithmetic. Eventually, I finally want to implement my F5 algorithm for modules over path algebra quotients (after being distracted by other things for several years), starting with finite dimensional quotients.

So, having an implementation of finite dimensional algebras over any field (but for me most importantly over finite not necessarily prime fields!) that is *really* competitive would be nice.

Can you give me a pointer for the PARI/GP implementation? Would it be difficult to wrap in cython?

An algebra over F<sub>q</sub> is just a special case of an algebra over F<sub>p</sub>. PARI/GP supports algebras over Q and over F<sub>p</sub>.

> Can you give me a pointer for the PARI/GP implementation?

See https://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/dochtml/html-stable/ section "Associative and central simple algebras".

I don't think so. Depending on your needs, you could also use `cypari2`.

I don't buy that. A matrix over F<sub>p</sub> should be the same as an algebra over F<sub>q</sub>, but the current default in sage differs totally in performance.

Anyway, if you wanted to say that PARI/GP is good in *both* cases then it's fine.

<a id='comment:8'>**Comment 8:**</a>
How can I do the following pari code in Sage?

```
  { m_i = [0,-1,0, 0;
           1, 0,0, 0;
           0, 0,0,-1;
           0, 0,1, 0];
    m_j = [0, 0,-1,0;
           0, 0, 0,1;
           1, 0, 0,0;
           0,-1, 0,0];
    m_k = [0, 0, 0, 0;
           0, 0,-1, 0;
           0, 1, 0, 0;
           1, 0, 0,-1];
    A = alginit(nfinit(y), [matid(4), m_i,m_j,m_k],  0); }
```
Defining the matrices works:

```
sage: Mi = pari("""
....: [0,-1,0, 0;
....:            1, 0,0, 0;
....:            0, 0,0,-1;
....:            0, 0,1, 0]""")
sage: Mj = pari("""
....: [0, 0,-1,0;
....:            0, 0, 0,1;
....:            1, 0, 0,0;
....:            0,-1, 0,0];""")
sage: Mk = pari("""
....: [0, 0, 0, 0;
....:            0, 0,-1, 0;
....:            0, 1, 0, 0;
....:            1, 0, 0,-1];""")
sage: Mj
[0, 0, -1, 0; 0, 0, 0, 1; 1, 0, 0, 0; 0, -1, 0, 0]
sage: Mi*Mk
[0, 0, 1, 0; 0, 0, 0, 0; -1, 0, 0, 1; 0, 1, 0, 0]
```
However, my attempts to define the algebra failed:

```
sage: pari("nfinit(y)").alginit([pari("matid(4)"), Mi,Mj,Mk], 0)
...
PariError: incorrect priority in nffactor: variable 0 >= y
sage: pari.alginit(pari("nfinit(y)"), [pari("matid(4)"), Mi,Mj,Mk], 0)
...
AttributeError: 'cypari2.pari_instance.Pari' object has no attribute 'alginit'
```

**Everything** is wrapped. That's the nice thing about `cypari2`: it automagically wraps all GP functions (assuming that the argument types are understood; PARI functions taking functions as input are not supported for example).

It's probably not so relevant, but it's best to use #23518.

> a quick look seems to indicate that the conversions are about numbers, not algebras.

Well yes, it's a Python package so it only supports a limited set of conversions for standard Python types. Sage does support more conversions though. In any case, don't be blinded by the conversions, that's really just a detail. If PARI supports your algorithms, surely the conversion between Sage and PARI should be possible to implement.

Use a different variable name :-)

```
sage: pari("nfinit(t)").alginit(["matid(4)", Mi, Mj, Mk], 0)
```
Note that you don't need `pari()` in the arguments of the method: the inputs are automatically converted to PARI. This means that strings are evaluated.

With #23518, you should be able to write this as

```
sage: pari.alginit("nfinit(t)", ["matid(4)", Mi, Mj, Mk], 0)
```
or

```
sage: pari.alginit(pari.nfinit("t"), [pari.matid(4), Mi, Mj, Mk], 0)
```

But in any case, Pari complains about type (t_VEC), not about value. So, the number of matrices isn't the only problem.

<a id='comment:20'>**Comment 20:**</a>
I think I shouldn't be overambitious in this ticket: The finite-dimensional path algebra quotient stuff should be for a later ticket, where I will probably sub-class the now cythonised finite dimensional algebra elements.

Changes:
- The element class is now in Cython.
- The multiplication matrix of an element is now lazy, which means that initialisation of an element will be substantially faster.
- An element is encoded by a matrix with a single row, not by a vector. As I have demonstrated, multiplying a single row matrix by a square matrix is always faster than multiplying a vector by a square matrix.

Caveat: It seems to me that **OVER QQ** multiplying a square matrix with a single-column matrix is faster than multiplying a single-row matrix with a square matrix. But that's the only case where I found that behaviour. Since I am not interested in the rational case anyway, I don't plan to provide a special implementation over QQ where elements are encoded as single-column matrices rather than single-row matrices.

PS: For me, tests pass...

I don't know why, but apparently Pari doesn't accept some associative algebras that are perfectly fine in Sage, while it accept others:

```

I notice a problem: Old pickles won't unpickle.

When I save a finite dimensional algebra element in the old version, and load it in the new version, I get

```
sage: x = load('backup.sobj')
sage: x
<repr(<sage.algebras.finite_dimensional_algebras.finite_dimensional_algebra_element.FiniteDimensionalAlgebra_with_category.element_class at 0x7f836819c0b8>) failed: AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'list'>
sage: x._vector is None
True
sage: x.__dict__

{'_default_filename': '/home/king/Sage/git/sage/backup.sobj',
 '_matrix': [0 1 0]
 [0 0 0]
 [0 0 0],
 '_vector': (0, 1, 0)}
sage: type(x)
<class 'sage.algebras.finite_dimensional_algebras.finite_dimensional_algebra_element.FiniteDimensionalAlgebra_with_category.element_class'>
sage: type(x) is A.element_class
False
sage: A = FiniteDimensionalAlgebra(QQ, [Matrix([[1,0,0], [0,1,0], [0,0,0]]), Matrix([[0,1,0], [0,0,0], [0,0,0]]), Matrix([[0,0,0], [0,0,0], [0,0,1]])])
sage: x = A.1
sage: type(x)
<type 'sage.algebras.finite_dimensional_algebras.finite_dimensional_algebra_element.FiniteDimensionalAlgebraElement'>
```

So, the old pickle gives the a python class that is derived from the new cython class and is not the same as the new element_class.

How can this be cured? There is unpickle_override, but I don't know if this helps in the current situation.

1 loop, best of 3: 255 ms per loop
1 loop, best of 3: 212 ms per loop
```

Basically the multiplication of (dense) `matrix * vector` (and vice versa) is using the naïve algorithm and does not take advantage of specialized implementations:

```python
        cdef Py_ssize_t i
        return sum([self.column(i, from_list=True) * v[i]
                    for i in xrange(self._ncols)], M(0))
```
While `_matrix_times_vector_` clearly deserves specialized implementations (same for `_vector_times_matrix_`), it will take some more specialized code to improve it. The amazing thing is **Q** has a specialized implementation for `_vector_times_matrix_`, but it is not as fast as going back and forth with a matrix (flint is doing something really good)! O_o That would be a project for a separate ticket.

`__setstate__` will work.

Question: When unpickling, the dictionary contains an item `_default_filename`, which provides the file name of the pickle. Should I simply ignore it? I think so...

I agree that the vector vs. matrix problem should be treated separately. I think currently it is best to do "single row matrix" times "square matrix".

Great, thank you for the timings.

Some things that will need to be done before positive review:

- You should have a pxd file with the appropriate declarations.
- I would get rid of the `is_vector` and just replace it with the appropriate `isinstance` test for clarity (and the compiler does not always inline `inline` functions).
- I would not mark `unpickle_FiniteDimensionalAlgebraElement` as `inline` as it probably never will be inlined.
- In this part of the initialization

  ```diff
  if A == elt.parent():
      self._vector = elt._vector.base_extend(k)
      self.__matrix = elt._matrix.base_extend(k)
  ```
  I think you should not compute the matrix for `elt`, but instead keep it lazy:

  ```python
  if A == elt.parent():
     mat = (<FiniteDimensionalAlgebraElement> elt).__matrix
     if mat is None:
         self.__matrix = None
     else:
         self.__matrix = mat.base_extend(k)
  ```
- You should generally avoid the `matrix()` constructor as it is slower than creating the corresponding `MatrixSpace` and directly constructing the element from that (at least last time I checked). This way avoids a lot of the logic for parsing arguments that is there in `matrix()`. So you could do changes like:

  ```diff
  -self._vector = matrix(self._parent.base_ring(), 1,len(v), list(v))
  +self._vector = MatrixSpace(self._parent.base_ring(), len(v)).one()
  ```
- You should add a typecast here for speed:

  ```diff
  -cdef FiniteDimensionalAlgebraElement a = ~self
  +cdef FiniteDimensionalAlgebraElement a = <FiniteDimensionalAlgebraElement> (~self)
  ```
  Also, on the line below you know that `a.__matrix` is set (if invertible), so you can avoid the extra Python call.
- Add a typecase for `other` in `_mul_`.
- In `_matrix`, you should add a `cdef int i` (Cython makes better code with this). Actually, better to do

  ```python
  cdef int i
  cdef tuple table = <tuple> A.table()
  ret = sum(self._vector[0,i] * table[i] for i in xrange(A.degree()))
  self.__matrix = matrix(A.base_ring(), ret)
  ```
- As Jeroen said on sage-devel, by having a `__dict__`, the class is slower than without it. I suspect there are probably better ways to deal with the unpickling than to have a `__dict__`. I can look into this if you want.

You misunderstand what I was doing.

We are talking here about the `__setstate__` method, that will *only* be called when someone unpickles an old pickle of finite-dimensional algebra elements. Pickling of the new implementation relies on `__reduce__` and an unpickle function that has nothing to do with `__setstate__`.

In other words, it is a dynamic class whose base is the former Python class FiniteDimensionalAlgebraElement. Hence, when unpickling it, the class will still be a dynamic (Python) class whose base is the (now!) Cython class FiniteDimensionalAlgebraElement.

Therefore, when unpickling an old pickle, we can be sure that the class *has* a `__dict__`, simply because it is a Python class! Nonetheless, just to be on the safe side, I check whether it really has a `__dict__`, and only if it has, I use it to store additional attributes that the user might have assigned to the element before pickling it.

In other words, FiniteDimensionalAlgebraElement has no `__dict__`, and we are merely talking about an attempt to recover as gracefully as possible in the unlikely event that the user has an old pickle containing additional attributes. But if that situation occurs, the class will be a derived Python class that *has* a `__dict__` -- I am not adding it.

I can confirm, although the difference isn't huge. Non-square matrix is faster with MatrixSpace:

```
sage: %timeit M = matrix(GF(7), 1,1000, range(1000))
The slowest run took 5.83 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
10000 loops, best of 3: 66.3 µs per loop
sage: %timeit M = MatrixSpace(GF(7), 1,1000)(range(1000))
The slowest run took 5.47 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
10000 loops, best of 3: 56.4 µs per loop
```
Square unit matrix (mind that we can not take `.one()`, as we want a mutable copy):

```
sage: %timeit M = matrix(GF(7), 1000,1000, 1)
1000 loops, best of 3: 738 µs per loop
sage: %timeit M = MatrixSpace(GF(7), 1000)(1)
The slowest run took 5.07 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.

I am encountering a difference because of extension classes versus regular classes:

```
sage: A = FiniteDimensionalAlgebra(ZZ, [Matrix([[1,0], [0,1]]), Matrix([[0,1], [0,0]])])
sage: A.an_element()[0]  # TypeError - defined in the category and not inherited
```
So no matter what, you currently need a Python class for the `element_class`.

One way you can add a test is take an old pickle string and then load that (which is how I am testing things).

I don't see where you need a mutable copy. Can you show me where that is? Also, `one()` does some extra checks, but the fastest way is `identity_matrix()` (all `MS(1)` does is call `MS.identity_matrix().__copy__()`).

I thought at some point of the code matrix entries are assigned to after creation, but it seems that it is in fact not the case. In that case, one should `.zero()` and `.one()`, as it is cached.

So, how could I change that without changing the old pickle?

That's totally odd. By how the category framework works, all methods defined in the category should still be available for an element class that is a cython class.

Is it not the case that the element class of a parent P coincides with `P.Element` if `P.Element` is a cython class (which is no the case for finite dimensional algebras, but used not to be the case in the old implementation).

> So no matter what, you currently need a Python class for the `element_class`.

No. It is perfectly normal for an element class to be Cython.

For reference:

I didn't, see discussion above.

As pointed out on sage-devel, `P.element_class` should be pickled by construction and not by constituents. That's a bug in the category framework that will generally be a problem when a former python element class becomes a cython element class. So, that's for a different ticket.

Something else: All tests pass `:-)`

I'd be happy to unpickle the old dynamic class that is derived from the old Python class `FiniteDimensionalAlgebraElement` just as plain `FiniteDimensionalAlgebraElement`. There would be no problem if the old pickle would state that the class is the element class of the algebra (because that in fact **is** `FiniteDimensionalAlgebraELement`, not just a derived class).

Ugg...the pickle is much more fugly than I was thinking. So it will be what it will be. At least, I don't see a way we can get around it either.

You specifically, no. IMO, it is a shortcoming of `UniqueFactory` (which is used for the `GF(p)` constructor).

However, these are special Python methods and behave different than normal methods. I ran into this same problem on #22632 (I say `_mul_`, but it really comes from the lack of the `__mul__` IIRC), and this was the only way I could work around it. I'm not sure if #23435 would actually be a proper fix for this or not.

However, it is the most straightforward way to get special methods implemented in the category to work while still retaining the Cythonization.

It is a backwards incompatible change in output of `vector()` returning a matrix instead of a vector. You should change `vector()` to return `self._vector[0]` (and maybe add a quick comment there to say `self._vector` is now a `1xn` matrix).

You are not really constructing a matrix from scratch but instead doing a copy. However, what is really strange is this:

```
sage: MS = MatrixSpace(QQ, 2)
sage: %timeit MS.one()
The slowest run took 9.92 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
100000 loops, best of 3: 5.36 µs per loop
sage: %timeit MS.identity_matrix()
The slowest run took 47.13 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
10000000 loops, best of 3: 60.7 ns per loop
sage: MS.one == MS.identity_matrix
True
sage: MS.one is MS.identity_matrix
True
```
I guess that is coming from the alias and `@cached_method` not as well-behaved with aliases. However, that is a huge difference (and something I will need to remember).

The difference is this:

```
sage: MS = MatrixSpace(QQ, 2)
sage: MS.__dict__

{'_MatrixSpace__is_sparse': False,
 '_MatrixSpace__matrix_class': <type 'sage.matrix.matrix_rational_dense.Matrix_rational_dense'>,

  (Rational Field, 2, 2, False, 'flint'),
  {}),
 'identity_matrix': Cached version of <function identity_matrix at 0x7f1014913b90>}
```

`identity_matrix` is an attribute on the object `MS`, while `one` is an attribute on `type(MS)`.

I recently created `getattr_debug` which is really useful in situations like this:

```
sage: MS = MatrixSpace(QQ, 2)
sage: getattr_debug(MS, "one")
getattr_debug(obj=Full MatrixSpace of 2 by 2 dense matrices over ~~~, name='one'):
  type(obj) = <class 'sage.matrix.matrix_space.MatrixSpace_with_category'>

Thanks. I think because it is an implementation detail, it should be a proper code comment rather than a docstring note.

OK, I'll provide a `__getitem__` that mimics what used to be inherited from the category.

It is a more systemic problem:

sage: A = FiniteDimensionalAlgebra(ZZ, [Matrix([[1,0], [0,1]]), Matrix([[0,1], [0,0]])])
sage: len(A.an_element())

We definitely should override `__getitem__` as that will be a lot faster than the generic implementation. However, there is a change in behavior:

```
sage: A.an_element()[5]
IndexError: matrix index out of range
```
Before this would return `0`. It is arguable that it is the wrong behavior, and you don't have to change it, but I am just pointing it out. However, the different behavior does make the iterator work, but that is a matter of a lack of implementation. Really, there should be an implementation at the category level, but this would create an inconsistency with free module elements (i.e., created by `vector()`) and subclasses of `IndexedFreeModuleElement`.

I think it would be good to decide on and implement the behavior for `__iter__` here:

1 - Iterate over the vector and yield the coefficients.
2 - Iterate over pairs `(k, v)`, where `k` is the index/key and `v` is a non-zero coefficient.

My vote would be for 2 to be consistent with many (all?) the other algebras in Sage.

Subsequently, your `__len__` is a change in behavior, but it needs to be consistent with the `__iter__`. So we will need to choose.

Seriously? Strange. I thought that renaming is supported on the level of `SageObject`. Aha, I just read:

```
           To support them for a specific class, add a
           ``cdef public __custom_name`` attribute.

I do believe not raising an IndexError is wrong in that case.

Here I am unsure what you are referring to by "different behaviour". As a matter of fact, iterator works now:

```
sage: A = FiniteDimensionalAlgebra(QQ, [Matrix([[1,0,0], [0,1,0], [0,0,0]]), Matrix([[0,1,0], [0,0,0], [0,0,0]]), Matrix([[0,0,0], [0,0,0], [0,0,1]])])
sage: x = A.1
sage: list(x)
[0, 1, 0]
```

I don't think it is possible to be consistent, as even multi- and univariate polynomials aren't:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: list(x^2+2*y)
[(1, x^2), (2, y)]
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: list(x^8)
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
```

> Subsequently, your `__len__` is a change in behavior, but it needs to be consistent with the `__iter__`. So we will need to choose.

A finite dimensional algebra is a finite dimensional vector space, and thus I believe one should be consistent with vectors, not with multivariate polynomials. And that is the case with the current implementation.

It probably is a side-effect of a generic implementation of `_coefficient_fast`, which is called from `__getitem__`, that doesn't do any safety checks (because it needs to support infinite bases). So, yes, I agree that raising an error is the right thing.

The old behavior for `__getitem__` returned `0`, where there seems to be a default `__iter__` by Python that uses `__getitem__` with `int`s until it raises an `IndexError`.

Good point. Always fun the differences between uni- and multivariate polynomials.

See [comment:72](#comment%3A72) for other algebras. Polynomials error out when trying to do, e.g., `len(x^2+x)` and sidestep the issue. It comes down to `len` meaning length as a column vector or length of the support.

I am okay with the current behavior, even if I would prefer it to agree with `ModulesWithBasis` objects/`CombinatorialFreeModule` subclasses, but I just wanted to bring up that it is a change. Since you prefer the current implementation and there is a green patchbot, I am setting a positive review.

Yes, it does. However, Python generally uses `Py_ssize_t` for sizes (say, of lists or tuples). Also, in Sage, the number of rows/columns of a matrix is already stored as `Py_ssize_t`:

```
cdef class Matrix(ModuleElement):
