An update to gc is needed to support arm64/aarch64, see #23687,
as well as for FreeBSD support, see #22679.
It also appears to be good to be in sync with Linux boxes that ship make with guile extension (the latter depends on gc, and causes interesting errors, see #24575).

The source is here:
https://github.com/ivmai/bdwgc/releases/download/v7.6.4/gc-7.6.4.tar.gz

On some platforms this new version also needs libatomic_ops, see #23701

On Linux tests pass, but I can trigger a nasty crash interactively:

```
sage: from sage.libs.ecl import *
sage: from sage.interfaces.maxima_lib import <TAB>
```
Debian [experimental uses gc 7.4.4](https://people.debian.org/~thansen/debian-sage-status.html), so this would be one to test for this regression, too.

Jeroen, `libatomic_ops` has nothing to do with this ticket. It was #23701.
If you think #23701 needs an improvement please open another ticket.

To be very precise, the commits which are supposedly from #23701 do not actually appear on the branch at #23701. So this ticket needs to be rebased.

It's not cleaner than before since the branch didn't change. The fact that #23701 was merged does mean that the diff is easier to read on Trac.

Erik, does the branch work on Cygwin for you now? (You never answered comment 34 above).
The commit in the upstream repo seems to do the same job and is authored by you, but it looks differently---hopefully it does the same thing.

Yes, the diff is small but the history remains ugly: there are several commits on this branch which are really duplicates of commits from #23701.
