```
An update to gc is needed to support arm64/aarch64, see #23687,
as well as for FreeBSD support, see #22679.
It also appears to be good to be in sync with Linux boxes that ship make with guile extension (the latter depends on gc, and causes interesting errors, see #24575).

The source is here:
https://github.com/ivmai/bdwgc/releases/download/v7.6.4/gc-7.6.4.tar.gz

On some platforms this new version also needs libatomic_ops, see #23701

On Linux tests pass, but I can trigger a nasty crash interactively:

```
sage: from sage.libs.ecl import *
sage: from sage.interfaces.maxima_lib import <TAB>
```
Debian [experimental uses gc 7.4.4](https://people.debian.org/~thansen/debian-sage-status.html), so this would be one to test for this regression, too.

Erik, does the branch work on Cygwin for you now? (You never answered comment 34 above).
The commit in the upstream repo seems to do the same job and is authored by you, but it looks differently---hopefully it does the same thing.

Now, all that doesn't really matter.
