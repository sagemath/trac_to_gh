An update to gc is needed to support arm64/aarch64, see #23687,
as well as for FreeBSD support, see #22679.
It also appears to be good to be in sync with Linux boxes that ship make with guile extension (the latter depends on gc, and causes interesting errors, see #24575).

The source is here:
https://github.com/ivmai/bdwgc/releases/download/v7.6.4/gc-7.6.4.tar.gz

On some platforms this new version also needs libatomic_ops, see #23701

<a id='comment:15'></a>Turns out this is still not building properly on Cygwin.  It fails to produce a shared lib at link time:

It's probably a minor issue with link flag ordering.  I will investigate and provide a solution.
