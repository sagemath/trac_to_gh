FriCAS is a CAS that provides some functionality which is otherwise either missing (e.g., guessing formulas), or not as complete as might be desirable (e.g., symbolic integration).

The FriCAS interface was completely rewritten after FriCAS was demoted to experimental in #18563 and is now quite mature, containing lots of doctests.

What kind of review do you think is suitable for this ? I have had fricas installed for about 2 years, with no specific problems.

Since, AFAICT, #21377 and #22525 are already merged in 8.1.beta6, the only test I could do would be to test #23782 and `ptestlong`.

Maybe we should grasp the opportunity to document this interface a bit better, and possibly doctest some opportunities made available by fricas ?

In [your post](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/cHkVjFt1pIY/3DhGTFRMAwAJ), you quoted "guessing formulas", lazy powerseries, as well as enhancements to symbolic integration and differential equations solving. Documenting those examples, either in the relevant "main" documentation or in a specific page) and doctesting them would be useful.

What do you think ?

These are actually in the main documentation.  To see it:

```
sage: import sage.interfaces.fricas
sage: sage.interfaces.fricas?
```

I agree that exposing some of the functionality would be good, but I think that's for another ticket.  I wouldn't do it for an experimental package.

You may be right...

But your ticket aims to make it an //optional// package...

Anyway : sage 8.1.beta6+#23782 passes `ptestlong` without any error. What remains to do is changing $SAGE_ROOT/build/pkgs/fricas/type from `experimental` to `optional`, fix the checksums, commit and push. Care to do it ? (I can review it this afternoon...).

'Cause, unless I'm mistaken, the $SAGE_ROOT/build/pkgs/fricas/type file is accoundd for in the checksum computation ?

About this ticket itself: the way I see it, the only difference between an optional package and an experimental package is that an optional package is required to work on all supported platforms. "working" is defined as building, passing its own testsuite and passing Sage doctests. Regarding the test suite: does FriCAS have one? There is no `spkg-check` file.

If it works as defined above, then there doesn't even need to be a vote: just make it optional.

I can run some tests on various systems. As I said above, I'd prefer to wait for a beta release where are dependencies have been merged.

One of the FriCAS maintainers says (https://groups.google.com/d/msg/fricas-devel/s5WtJx8u-kA/XVJPuUAQBwAJ) that this should be the case.  I have no way of testing it.

Because you don't get a result, such as "tests passed".  Well, it might make sense to run it and say something like "output of tests can be found in ..."

What do you think?

LGTM : on Debian testing running on core i7 + 16 GB RAM, 8.1-beta7+#23847 passes `ptestlong` with no error whatsoever //(mirabile dictu),// as well as `sage -t --optional fricas,sage src/sage/interfaces/fricas.py`.

As suggested by Jeroen Demeyer, I think that this should be tested on other "officially supported Sage platforms", whatever that means.

At the very minimum, I suggest Mac OS X (which is full of surprises, nowadays), the Sage appliance used under Windows, and maybe the Cygwin(-64 ?) port made by Erik Bray, if Erik thinks that his port is ready for diffusion (I put him in `Cc`).

Status remains at `needs_review`, but should be put as `positive_review` when this will have been tested on all "interesting" platforms.

It seems psutil is sorting the processes by pid, so there's no way to guarantee what order they're in.  I don't know what this test is for or if it's important but if it really is then it should sort these processes by name.

The issue is a difference in newlines: on linux, with `fricas -nosman`, I have

```
sage: fricas.eval("1+1", reformat=False)
'\n|startAlgebraOutput|\n   2\n|endOfAlgebraOutput|'
```
whereas with `fricas -nox -noclef`, I have

```
sage: fricas.eval("1+1", reformat=False)
'\r\n|startAlgebraOutput|\r\n   2\r\n|endOfAlgebraOutput|\r'
```
I'm not sure what the right fix is.  I think I'll replace `\r\n` throughout with `\n`.
