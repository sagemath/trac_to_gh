```
Note that `creduce` calls this a lot since it computes `inverse_of_unit` in the fraction field.

In a two-step extension, introduced in #23218, this is probably most significant:

```
sage: w=W.gen()
sage: %timeit u=-w
1000 loops, best of 3: 774 µs per loop # without caching
10000 loops, best of 3: 77.9 µs per loop # with caching
```

In order to get better speed, this ticket also deprecates the `print_mode` dictionary that can passed into `fraction_field`, since this functionality is now available with `change`.

`pAdicRing(7) is pAdicRing(7)`
I suspect there is at least some kind of unique representation for padics. This tends to combine very poorly with caching, since it makes unexpected strong global reference chains: Because the ring lives in the (weak value) unique rep. cache, any object it references is strongly globally referenced. If any of those objects now references the ring (for instance by having it in its construction parameters if it's unique rep. itself), you have a globally anchored reference cycle and hence a memory leak.

**EDIT:**
OK, it looks like it's OK, because it seems that the construction parameters of field of fractions or integer ring do not refer to the ring/field, but are both constructed as completions:

```
sage: R=pAdicRing(7)
sage: R.construction()
(Completion[7], Integer Ring)
sage: R.fraction_field().construction()
(Completion[7], Rational Field)
sage: K=pAdicField(7)
sage: K.construction()
(Completion[7], Rational Field)
sage: K.integer_ring().construction()
(Completion[7], Integer Ring)
```

It means that "completion" on number fields cannot be caching.
