Why this change?

```diff

+class CoercionException(TypeError, BaseException):
```
`TypeError` is a subclass of `BaseException`, so I don't understand why it is needed/wanted.

because this line triggers the warning

```
catching classes that don't inherit from BaseException is not allowed in  3.x
```
when the tests are run with "python -3 sage-runtests"

are you sure of what you say ?

```
sage: isinstance(TypeError,Exception)
False
sage: isinstance(TypeError,BaseException)
False
```
