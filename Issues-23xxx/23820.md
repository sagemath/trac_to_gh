In Pynac-0.7.11:
* fix `coeff()` problem with fraction as argument (#19996)
* fix: useries wasn't adapted to long numeric changes
* include last-minute fix from #23325
* hold context; see #10035
* immediate simplification of trig function with argument of form `I*x`
* immediate simplification of hyperbolic function with argument of form `I*x`
* `(x*y<sup>(m/n)*z)</sup>(r/s) ---> y<sup>t*(x*z)</sup>(r/s)`, if `t` integer
* cases function; see #20191
* use Singular for expansion of mul above certain threshold
* improvements with using libtool in configure
* remove unused code
