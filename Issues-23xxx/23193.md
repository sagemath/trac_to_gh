This should return some "typical" elements that are good for testing. Just random elements is a bit unfortunate because we are missing elements such as 0, 1, x, 1/x, …

```
sage: K.<x> = FunctionField(QQ)
sage: K.some_elements()
[(x^2 - x - 1)/(-11/4*x^2 - x),
 (-x^2 - 1)/(-x - 1),
 (2/217*x^2 + 6*x - 3)/(-23*x^2 - 1/6*x - 2)]
sage: K.some_elements()
[-2*x - 1/7,
 (-x + 1)/(-2*x^2 + 2/3*x + 1/8),
 (x^2 + x - 1)/(-1/3*x^2 - 1/2*x - 35)]
