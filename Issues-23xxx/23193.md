This should return some "typical" elements that are good for testing. Just random elements is a bit unfortunate because we are missing elements such as 0, 1, x, 1/x, …

```
sage: K.<x> = FunctionField(QQ)
sage: K.some_elements()
[(x^2 - x - 1)/(-11/4*x^2 - x),
 (-x^2 - 1)/(-x - 1),
 (2/217*x^2 + 6*x - 3)/(-23*x^2 - 1/6*x - 2)]
sage: K.some_elements()
[-2*x - 1/7,
 (-x + 1)/(-2*x^2 + 2/3*x + 1/8),
 (x^2 + x - 1)/(-1/3*x^2 - 1/2*x - 35)]
```

Sorry, I said something incorrect about this earlier, claiming that this would only affect rational function fields. This actually gets called as well for extensions of function fields, so you can never simply divide by the generator or something like that sadly.

Here is an idea how you could probably elegantly rewrite this and do so without putting some random constants in the code here. `self._ring` is the polynomial ring underlying the function field (i.e., if you have `K(x)`, then this would be `K[x]` and if you have `K(x)[y]/(f)`, then this would be `K(x)[y]`.)

What do you think?

You might want to also check that `a != b` and `a != 0` to avoid duplicates in that list and then add [0,1] to the list manually.
