Keywords: coxeter

Using `CoxeterGroup` is much faster than using `WeylGroup` for doing the computations necessary for the Iwahori-Hecke algebra.

Current default:

```
sage: R.<q> = LaurentPolynomialRing(ZZ)
sage: W = WeylGroup('B3')
sage: w0 = [3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1]
sage: I = IwahoriHeckeAlgebra(W, q^2)
sage: T = I.T()
sage: Cp = I.Cp()
sage: %time x = T(Cp[w0])
CPU times: user 1min 5s, sys: 52 ms, total: 1min 5s
Wall time: 1min 5s
```
versus (in a new session):

```
sage: W = CoxeterGroup('B3')
sage: I = IwahoriHeckeAlgebra(W, q^2)
sage: T = I.T()
sage: Cp = I.Cp()
sage: %time x = T(Cp[w0])
CPU times: user 8.8 s, sys: 24 ms, total: 8.82 s
Wall time: 8.81 s
```

This also does some cleanup of uniformizing the Coxeter group default methods and making Coxeter type closer to Cartan types.

Ideally I would like to do this for finite Weyl types:

```
sage: W = CoxeterGroup('B3', implementation='permutation')
sage: I = IwahoriHeckeAlgebra(W, q^2)
sage: T = I.T()
sage: Cp = I.Cp()
sage: %time x = T(Cp[w0])
CPU times: user 184 ms, sys: 12 ms, total: 196 ms
Wall time: 357 ms
```
However, there is a bug somewhere and I am not sure where (yet):

```
sage: R.<v> = LaurentPolynomialRing(QQ, 'v')
sage: W = CoxeterGroup('A3', implementation='permutation')
sage: H = IwahoriHeckeAlgebra(W, v**2)
sage: T = H.T()
sage: C = H.C()
sage: KL = KazhdanLusztigPolynomial(W, v)
sage: term = lambda x,y: (-1)^y.length() * v^(-2*y.length()) * KL.P(y, x).substitute(v=v^-2)*T[y]
sage: for x in W:
....:     temp = T(C[x]) - (-v)^x.length()*sum(term(x,y) for y in W)

Here is a fix that goes at a deeper problem of a lack of coercion and conversion maps between Coxeter group implementations. There is an issue with the conversion into the permutation group implementation of finite Coxeter groups. This comes from the fact that permutation groups implement a custom `__call__` and is a bigger can of worms than we need to tackle here.
