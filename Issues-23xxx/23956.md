As observed on #23700, the following

```
sage: from sage.libs.ecl import *
sage: from sage.interfaces.maxima_lib import <TAB>
```
(i.e. hit `<TAB>` to complete the 2nd line)
crashes Sage on some configs. Worse, it happens on Sage 8.0 (say, on CoCalc), on a clean build
of 8.1.beta6 on Fedora 26 (using gcc 6.4), as well as I see this on a semi-current Gentoo system (using gcc 6.3) for some time, since 8.0 at least.

See also #22766 for a different way to trigger essentially the same crash.


Depends on #22766

One can either force `IPython` to somehow be single-thread; they rely on `prompt_toolkit` for tab completion, and the latter ATM always runs in a separate thread(sic!),
or make ECL extension thread-safe.

ecllib quite fundamentally has problems with multiple threads, due to the fact that ECL and sage/python both have features for dealing with multiple threads, but in incompatible ways.

I think the best fix is to insert code to ensure that rebuilding the tab completion list is not built in the non-main thread (so, basically tie ecllib to one thread). I have no clue how to do that.

The simplest solution would be to not build the tab completion list on-demand, but build the list at build-time instead. The list doesn't need to be stored in user directories either, so it would improve performance characteristic on multi-user installs.

Replying to [@nbruin](#comment%3A4):

I don't understand what kind of incompatibility you mean. 

In fact, we do not need ECLs multithreading capabilities, neither as a compiler capable of dealing with Lisp threads, nor having its signals running in a separate thread. All we need is its ability to inform its GC about all the threads it has to handle (these are the ones ECL was ever invoked), this is what
`ecl_import_current_thread()` is for (not to be called in the main thread). I suppose we don't need to call `ecl_release_current_thread()`, as IPython's threads persist during the session (IMHO).

In `threading` there is `threading.current_thread()` which tells you where you are; 
one needs to figure out how to check whether it's the main one (in Python 3 it is simple, as there is 
`threading.main_thread()` to compare with).

Yes, but this does not look very attractive. (Although libGAP does it even simpler, it hardcodes the names of GAP functions in a Python module...)
