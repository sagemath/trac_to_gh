```
Currently, the `repr()` of a big matrix is this:

```
sage: random_matrix(ZZ, 100)
100 x 100 dense matrix over Integer Ring (use the '.str()' method to see the entries)
```
That's useful for interactive sessions to avoid clutter. In non-interactive sessions, that's mostly useless information. I am thinking of scripts which `print()` or `write()` a matrix to a file.

To fix this, I suggest to keep `repr()` as-is but to change `str()` to always show the entries.

This is somewhat analogous to #21124: be clever in `__repr__` but give all information in `__str__`.
