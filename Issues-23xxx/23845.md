The following all give errors:

```
sage: gcd(I-I*x, x^2-1)
sage: gcd(I+I*x, x^2-1)
sage: alg = SR(QQbar(sqrt(2)+I*sqrt(3)))
sage: gcd(alg+alg*x, x^2-1)
sage: gcd(alg-alg*x, x^2-1)
sage: sqrt2 = SR(QQbar(sqrt(2)))
sage: gcd(sqrt2+sqrt2*x, x^2-1)
sage: gcd(sqrt2-sqrt2*x, x^2-1)
```
This is fixed in Pynac master and should be doctested here.

Note that although Singular supports algebraic GCD Pynac uses Singular only in rational mode. Use a dedicated polynomial ring instead of symbolics if you want algebraic GCD.
