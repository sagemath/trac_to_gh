This ticket fixes the incorrect computation of Walsh Hadamard Transform in BooleanFunction. The incorrectness is due to wrong computation of sign function F corresponding to the BooleanFunction, that is F(x) = 1 - 2*f(x) where f is an n-variable Boolean function with the set of integer as codomain. This issue is previously mentioned in the #11450 .

Looks good to me, thanks for fixing this!

As this is my first sage/trac review, maybe someone else also want to take a look. I checked (following this guide http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/reviewer_checklist.html#chapter-review ) that:
- the code fixes the bug
- the doctests touched by this patch pass
- the reference doc builds without errors
- all doctests (make ptestlong) pass (there are two failed tests in sage.tests.cmdline.test_executable, but these seem to be unrelated)
