This ticket fixes the incorrect computation of Walsh Hadamard Transform in BooleanFunction. The incorrectness is due to wrong computation of sign function F corresponding to the BooleanFunction, that is F(x) = 1 - 2*f(x) where f is an n-variable Boolean function with the set of integer as codomain. This issue is previously mentioned in the #11450 .
