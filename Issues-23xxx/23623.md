# Issue 23623: Add is_trivial_zero() to coordinate functions and scalar fields on manifolds

The method `is_trivial_zero` is then used instead of `== 0` in tensor calculus, especially in tensor assignement, where the check for zero is performed because only nonzero components of a tensor are stored.
