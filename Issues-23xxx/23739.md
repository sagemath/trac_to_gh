Also, any `Parent` has a default `an_element` that implements a (very old) caching by calling `_an_element_` (if it exists). So that code path could error out in a way that the initial checking is saying it should not.

I would also put the `if is_ComplexIntervalField(S):` block first, but this is more of my personal preference as the code feels cleaner to me (so feel free to ignore it).

This might also be a good time to convert this from an old-style parent to new-style.

Yes, I think removing the `__call__` method completely is the way forward. If we do implement a custom `__call__` we should really call the `__call__` of parent if `im = None` since otherwise we break coercion. And I solved the reported issue of this ticket by fixing coercion. However removing `__call__` completely would be even nicer since then we also have as little as possible overhead when `im = None`.

What I mean by this is unrelated to performance issues, but more related to behaviour issues. In general one should not overwrite the `__call__` method because it breaks all the nice category and coercion stuff in sage.  So I made the `__call__`  method behave as much as possible as if it were not there by making the code behave as if there were no `__call__` at all if `im = None`.

Yes I agree this is a good time to do this. What kind of things would be involved in this? I guess at least replacing this

```
ParentWithGens.__init__(self, self._real_field(), ('I',), False, category = Fields())
```
in the `__init__` function of CIF with something else.

<a id='comment:16'></a>Yes, what I am advocating for is this:

```python
def __call__(self, x, im=None):
    if im is None:
        return super(ComplexIntervalField_class,self).__call__(x)
    return complex_interval.ComplexIntervalFieldElement(self, (x, im))
```

For removing the old-style parent, from a quick look, it looks like the following needs to be done:
- change `ParentWithGens` to `Parent` (maybe adding one or two extra methods to keep functionality)
- specify `Element = ComplexIntervalFieldElement`
- replace explicit calls to `ComplexIntervalFieldElement(self, args)` by `self.element_class(self, args)`

I am pretty sure you can use `_element_constructor_(self, x, im=None)`.

Sorry for the shorter responses and not contributing actual code right now, I'm in the process of moving.

That was a little too brief. What I mean is that the `__call__` should redirect extra arguments to `_element_constructor_` in the natural python way. Although I'm still slightly in favor of the special `__call__`.

<a id='comment:20'></a>Great, thank you. Looks good. A good followup will be making this use `UniqueRepresentation` instead of its own custom cache. However, that will probably be a bit more invasive of a change, so I think it is better as a separate ticket.

I added a little more documentation for `_coerce_map_from_` to match what the code does. I also implemented coercions from `CC` to match the real version:

```
sage: RIF.coerce_map_from(RR)
Call morphism:
  From: Real Field with 53 bits of precision
  To:   Real Interval Field with 53 bits of precision
```
The rest of my changes are PEP8 and trivial formatting.

If my changes look good, then positive review.
