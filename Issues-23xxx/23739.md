First I thought this was because there was no convert or coerce map registered. But apparently the coercion framework is not even called in this conversion, because the coercion framework works without problems!

```
sage: NF.<a> = QuadraticField(-2)
sage: CIF.coerce_map_from(NF)
Composite map:
  From: Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^2 + 2
  To:   Complex Interval Field with 53 bits of precision
  Defn:   Generic morphism:
          From: Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^2 + 2
          To:   Complex Lazy Field
          Defn: a -> 1.414213562373095?*I
        then
          Call morphism:
          From: Complex Lazy Field
          To:   Complex Interval Field with 53 bits of precision
sage: CIF.coerce_map_from(NF)(a)
1.414213562373095?*I
```

If you still feel like the best way forward is to remove the `__call__`, then I can try to help figure out what is going on and what we can do going forward. I don't understand what you mean by this:

> since in the case that `im = None` the current code behave exactly as if there where no `__call__` at all.


Also, any `Parent` has a default `an_element` that implements a (very old) caching by calling `_an_element_` (if it exists). So that code path could error out in a way that the initial checking is saying it should not.

I would also put the `if is_ComplexIntervalField(S):` block first, but this is more of my personal preference as the code feels cleaner to me (so feel free to ignore it).

This might also be a good time to convert this from an old-style parent to new-style.

Yes, I think removing the `__call__` method completely is the way forward. If we do implement a custom `__call__` we should really call the `__call__` of parent if `im = None` since otherwise we break coercion. And I solved the reported issue of this ticket by fixing coercion. However removing `__call__` completely would be even nicer since then we also have as little as possible overhead when `im = None`.

What I mean by this is unrelated to performance issues, but more related to behaviour issues. In general one should not overwrite the `__call__` method because it breaks all the nice category and coercion stuff in sage.  So I made the `__call__`  method behave as much as possible as if it were not there by making the code behave as if there were no `__call__` at all if `im = None`.

> Also, any `Parent` has a default `an_element` that implements a (very old) caching by calling `_an_element_` (if it exists). So that code path could error out in a way that the initial checking is saying it should not.

Yes I agree this is a good time to do this. What kind of things would be involved in this? I guess at least replacing this

```
ParentWithGens.__init__(self, self._real_field(), ('I',), False, category = Fields())
```
in the `__init__` function of CIF with something else.

Yes, what I am advocating for is this:

```python
def __call__(self, x, im=None):
    if im is None:
        return super(ComplexIntervalField_class,self).__call__(x)
    return complex_interval.ComplexIntervalFieldElement(self, (x, im))
```

For removing the old-style parent, from a quick look, it looks like the following needs to be done:
- change `ParentWithGens` to `Parent` (maybe adding one or two extra methods to keep functionality)
- specify `Element = ComplexIntervalFieldElement`
- replace explicit calls to `ComplexIntervalFieldElement(self, args)` by `self.element_class(self, args)`

I am pretty sure you can use `_element_constructor_(self, x, im=None)`.

Sorry for the shorter responses and not contributing actual code right now, I'm in the process of moving.

That was a little too brief. What I mean is that the `__call__` should redirect extra arguments to `_element_constructor_` in the natural python way. Although I'm still slightly in favor of the special `__call__`.

Great, thank you. Looks good. A good followup will be making this use `UniqueRepresentation` instead of its own custom cache. However, that will probably be a bit more invasive of a change, so I think it is better as a separate ticket.

I added a little more documentation for `_coerce_map_from_` to match what the code does. I also implemented coercions from `CC` to match the real version:

```
sage: RIF.coerce_map_from(RR)
Call morphism:
  From: Real Field with 53 bits of precision
  To:   Real Interval Field with 53 bits of precision
```
The rest of my changes are PEP8 and trivial formatting.

If my changes look good, then positive review.
