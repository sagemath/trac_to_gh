Part of #16081

This set of changes takes care of all the problems reported by `sage -t --long src/sage/matrix/*`. With probability 1 there are other functions that would need to be changed as well but that are not tested enough to raise errors at the moment.

It is my first ticket concerning pythn3 so please be extra careful when reviewing it. 

This marginally changed also `src/sage/graphs/generic_graph.py`.

1. I would replace

```
            from collections import Iterator, Sequence
            if isinstance(columns, (Iterator, Sequence)):
                columns = list(columns)
            else:
                raise TypeError("columns (=%s) must be a list of integers" % columns)
```
by

```
            columns = list(columns)
```

2. Don't break doctests! You should keep the test `A(range(4))`, just change it to

```
sage: from six.moves import range
sage: A(range(4))
```
if you want to do the same thing in Python 2 and 3.

Hi Jeroen, thanks for the fast reply.

2. I bowed to your knowledge here and just reintroduced the test.

1. The rationale behind the conditional clause you mention (and the many other similar occurrences I added in this partch) is that, most likely, `columns` is already going to be a list. I figured it was more efficient to add two checks rather than recreating a new list blindly. In this specific case you mention it will probably not matter because these lists will have short lengths anyway. The cases in which this is more relevant are probably in `src/sage/matrix/matrix_integer_sparse.pyx` where, in principle, one could be building a very big matrix. Should I remove these tests?

One other thing: before settling on this form I was just checking for `hasattr(columns, "__iter__")` but then I realized that also dictionaries will satisfy this.

This reply seems unrelated to the comment I made. It's not about calling `list()` when the input is not a list, it's about rejecting things which are not a `Sequence` or `Iterator`.

I'm perfectly fine with code like

```
if not isinstance(foo, list):
    foo = list(foo)
```
As you say, this is more efficient if the input is already a `list`.

OK, I consider myself voted down and I will remove these checks.

I would only like to point out that we are changing the behaviour from the one before this patch.

The current patch:

```
-        if isinstance(columns, xrange):
-            columns = list(columns)
-        elif not isinstance(columns, (list, tuple)):
-            raise TypeError("columns (=%s) must be a list of integers" % columns)
+        if not isinstance(columns, (list, tuple)):
+            from collections import Iterator, Sequence
+            if isinstance(columns, (Iterator, Sequence)):
+                columns = list(columns)
+            else:
+                raise TypeError("columns (=%s) must be a list of integers" % columns)
```

The proposed version:

```
-        if isinstance(columns, xrange):
-            columns = list(columns)
-        elif not isinstance(columns, (list, tuple)):
-            raise TypeError("columns (=%s) must be a list of integers" % columns)
+        if not isinstance(columns, (list, tuple)):
+             columns = list(columns)
```

1. With the code in sage before this ticket was opened the function in the comment 13 fails if you pass a dictionary to it (or any other iterable that is not xrange list or tuple).

2. With the change I made it preserves this behaviour.

3. With the change you suggest it works also if `coulmns` is a dictionary (using the its keys as elements).

I am not saying that 3 is bad (I actually prefer it), it is just different from 1.

Well, you are already changing the behaviour of the function in other ways too.

If allowing dicts was the *only* change that you did, I would agree with you: that would be dubious. But if you change behaviour anyway, then the argument "it behaves different from the old code" makes little sense.

That is not surprising: you forgot to call it.

```
sage: from six.moves import range
sage: isinstance(range(10), Iterator)
False
sage: isinstance(range(10), Sequence)
True
```

Anyway this is a moot point now since we decided that I should remove these conditional statements.

Dear All, sorry for the late reply.

I made few changes to the code:

1. All instances of `[0,1]` I introduced in the doctest are now `list(range(2))`. Same for `[0,1,2,3]`. I do not understand why you wanted this change (they produce the same output both in python2 and python3 and the fisrt syntax is shorter and more legible IMHO) but it is not worth spending time discussing this.

2. I removed all the tests `isinstance(foo, (Iterator, Sequence))` that where easily removeable. There are few more around, I think only in the following files

```
src/sage/matrix/matrix_double_dense.pyx
src/sage/matrix/matrix_integer_sparse.pyx
src/sage/matrix/matrix_mod2_dense.pyx
src/sage/matrix/matrix_modn_sparse.pyx
src/sage/matrix/matrix_rational_sparse.pyx
src/sage/matrix/matrix_space.py
``` 
    The reason is that the function in there already accept a variety of inputs, some of which are not iterable, and to remove the tests these function would have to be significantly reworked. There are two solutions to this:
 
    (cheap and messy) remove the test and fail if they are fed an iterator. This probably will require to fix doctests in other files. Plus I do not see why they should not work with iterators just because the implementation is not clean enough.

    (more time consuming) rewrite the functions so that they default to evaluate `foo = list(foo)`

    At the moment I do not have time to do so. If you are not satisfied feel free to take over this patch and fix it to your likings.

`@`Travis: I do not understand what you mean by "and be Python3 compatible". It looks to me that the changes this patch produces work in both version of python. This is the whole point, no?

This patch does not address the issue of slicing; are you saying that it should leave alone the doctests failing because of this? 

In any case, it looks to me that there is no consensus on what to do. Moreover we are not being consistent with other py3 tickets so far. Do we have to revisit all the work that has already been done? Frédéric should probably be part of the conversation as well so I just cced him.

Hello Salvatore,

in fact, there is no hurry (py3 is still a long way ahead, sadly), but I was afraid that you were (besides being very busy with installation at your new job, which is very understandable) somewhat horrified by the complexity of the matter, and the various contradictory requirements.

Concerning your name on the commit, I did a rebase, keeping only your first commit and squashing the others into this one, then changing its commit message. Then I worked a little bit and rebased again. So I guess this is considered to some kind of "transformation" of your initial commit.

1. Why was this doctest removed:

```
sage: A.delete_columns('junk')
```

2. This might be partially a style issue, but I hate code of the form

```
try:
    something()
except TypeError:
    raise TypeError(...)
```
because usually, the exception that is caught and thrown away contains more useful information that the newly raised exception. So I would replace this by

```
something()
