I have a couple of question relevant to sage-on-distro. Ok gentoo because I have a feeling binary distro won't care too much but I do because I make several versions of sage available for building and I need to be sure things will work with at least "current stable" and "current develop" (beta). Therefore I need to know if I need to provide different version of cython depending on the sage version.

* #23004 says it only affect windows, but with this ticket, is the patch now absolutely needed on other platforms as well?
*  If I only provide one version of `cython` with the patch at #23004 will sage 7.6 still build?

For the record I am already in the business of providing a patched cython for sage-on-gentoo. I sometimes feel more free than my debian colleagues...
