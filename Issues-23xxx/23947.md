This ticket implements what we are calling the reciprocal transform for polynomials, and its inverse. For a fixed parameter `q`, the reciprocal transform applied to `P(x)` returns `x^deg(P)*P(x+q/x)`. This operation transforms polynomials with all roots in the interval `[-2*sqrt(q), 2*sqrt(q)]` into polynomials with all roots having absolute value `sqrt(q)`, and accounts for all such polynomials up to multiplication by a factor of `x^2-q`.
