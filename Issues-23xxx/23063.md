This is a bug I stumbled into when creating a graphics_array where each plot has a legend_label string. I created a Minimal Working Example (MWE) and will attach an image with the current result.

Also, upon googling I stumbled into an ask.sagemath thread that pointed to a somewhat related Trac ticket #12591.

I found what I think is a closer match by finding Trac ticket #18711 (but I still don't know enough about Sage's internals to correctly point to what is going on). That bug is still reproducible by kcrisman's code.

Does this warrant a separate ticket? Or should this be merged into #18711 ?

Here is my MWE:

```python
def y(x=1, m=1, b=0):
    return m * x + b

data = [[[x, y(x=x, m=i, b=i)]
         for x in [1, 2, 3]]
        for i in [1, 2, 3, 4]]

plots = [list_plot(data=d,
                   legend_label=str(k + 1),
                   plotjoined=True)
         for k, d in enumerate(data)]


graphics_array(((plots[0], plots[1]),
                (plots[2], plots[3])))
```

And here is the MWE of #18711 :

```python
Qx.<x>=PolynomialRing(QQ)
K.<a> = NumberField(x^2-2)
S = K.embeddings(RR)
E=EllipticCurve([a,0])
F = E.base_extend(S[0])
F.plot(legend_label='b')
```

In fact, as explained in #12591, the complete last figure is duplicated (superposed with itself). Fixing this requires some expert in matplotlib, which I am not.

NOTE that the blue color is darker in the bottom left of your picture, for the same reason.

The first test case, using `graphics_array` is fixed in #27865.

The second test case is from #18711 (and is unfixed as of 8.9b1); it does not need to be duplicated on this ticket.

Let's close this ticket.
