The file `src/sage/graphs/base/boost_graph.pyx` is full of bad uses of `sig_on()`/`sig_off()`: one should never put Python code in a `sig_on()` block.

I am also fixing various style issues (not claiming to fix everything!):
- PEP 8 whitespace fixes
- Functions returning multiple values should use a tuple, not list.
- `OUTPUT` blocks should be #23017-compliant
- Fix exception messages and types
- Fix compiler warnings except for `-Wmaybe-uninitialized` (which are often false positives)

Thank you for this patch. I was not aware of the good use of `sig_on/sig_off`.

I have several compilation warnings. For instance

```

In method `boost_clustering_coeff`, could you explain why you use intermediate variable `cdef v_index vi` before the call `result_d = g[0].clustering_coeff(vi)` (in a `sig_on/sig_off` block). I don't understand the motivation behind.

Replying to [@dcoudert](#comment%3A10):
> Thank you for this patch. I was not aware of the good use of `sig_on/sig_off`.

The most important rule which is often forgotten is that you should not manipulate any Python objects inside `sig_on()`.

> I have several compilation warnings.

I know that there are several `-Wmaybe-uninitialized` warnings. But they are false positives (as far as I can tell). I fixed all other warnings.

> In method `boost_clustering_coeff`, could you explain why you use intermediate variable `cdef v_index vi` before the call `result_d = g[0].clustering_coeff(vi)` (in a `sig_on/sig_off` block). I don't understand the motivation behind.

See the "most important rule": `v` is a Python object, so we should do the conversion Python -> C outside of the `sig_on()` block.
