As found in [this post on ask.sagemath.org](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/38282/solving-system-of-ode-gets-valueerror/) the function `desolve_system` can fail with weird error message

```
sage: t = var('t')
sage: f = function('f')(t)
sage: g = function('g')(t)
sage: de1 = diff(f,t) == f*sin(t)
sage: de2 = diff(g,t) == 0
sage: desolve_system([de1, de2], [f,g])
Traceback (most recent call last):
<ipython-input-1-58fe9994eeb3> in <module>()
      2 de1 = diff(f,t) == f*sin(t);
      3 de2 = diff(g,t) == Integer(0);
----> 4 desolve_system([de1, de2], [f,g])

.../sage/calculus/desolvers.pyc in desolve_system(des, vars, ics, ivar)
    838     for i, sol in enumerate(soln):
    839         print(sol)
--> 840         soln[i] = sol.sage()
    841     if ics is not None:
    842         ivar_ic = ics[0]
...
ValueError: The name "+" is not a valid Python identifier.
```

The reason is that the `.sage()` method is not able to convert the maxima's answer back into Sage

```
f(_SAGE_VAR_t) = ilt((%i laplace(f(_SAGE_VAR_t), _SAGE_VAR_t, g2579 + %i)
 - %i laplace(f(_SAGE_VAR_t), _SAGE_VAR_t, g2579 - %i) + 2 f(0))/(2 g2579), 
g2579, _SAGE_VAR_t)
```
