Shouldn't that be the graph with 1 vertex and no edges?

I also see the code for the dual of the path. Shouldn't this one be a graph with one vertex one some parallel loops?

I guess one can still define the planar dual; the dual itself will always be connected. 


At the moment the method gets an uninformative error when you try these cases:

```
sage: G=Graph(1)
sage: G.faces()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
KeyError                                  Traceback (most recent call last)
...
   4940         # Storage for face paths
   4941         faces = []
-> 4942         path = [edgeset.pop()]
   4943 
   4944         # Trace faces

KeyError: 'pop from an empty set'
```

With the previous implementation, we can get:

```
sage: G = Graph([(0,0)], loops=True)
sage: G.faces({0:[0]})
[[(0, 0)]]
```
Could this be considered as a trivial face ?
