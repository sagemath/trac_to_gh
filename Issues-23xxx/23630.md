While working on the method I realized that some cases where not taken into account:
- what should the method returns when the graph has a single vertex and no edge ? (i.e., `G = Graph(1)`)
- What's the expected output for graphs with multiple connected components (e.g., `G = Graph(2)`) ? Should we raise an error for as long as we don't have a suitable solution ?

Shouldn't that be the graph with 1 vertex and no edges?

I also see the code for the dual of the path. Shouldn't this one be a graph with one vertex one some parallel loops?

I guess one can still define the planar dual; the dual itself will always be connected. 


At the moment the method gets an uninformative error when you try these cases:

```
sage: G=Graph(1)
sage: G.faces()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
KeyError                                  Traceback (most recent call last)
...
   4940         # Storage for face paths
   4941         faces = []
-> 4942         path = [edgeset.pop()]
   4943 
   4944         # Trace faces

KeyError: 'pop from an empty set'
```

- the graph has a single vertex and no edge (actually loops are not properly handled here). That's why `Graph(1).faces()` currently raises an uninformative error.  
- disconnected graphs.

For the dual graph, I agree that the dual of the path graph should be a single vertex with one or parallel loops.

A way to postpone the problem is to raise a not implemented error for these cases.

With the previous implementation, we can get:

```
sage: G = Graph([(0,0)], loops=True)
sage: G.faces({0:[0]})
[[(0, 0)]]
```
Could this be considered as a trivial face ?

I have fixed the issue with graphs without edge, ensuring that the result is the same has previous behavior. 
Actually, I did several tests with non-connected graphs, graphs without vertex/edge, etc. to compare former and new implementations. The behavior of the method remains the same. 

I have also fix some doctests in other modules. The change is only the order in which the elements of a set are displayed.

So I propose to let the open questions that may require special attention for another ticket. Here, we speedup the method without changing the behavior.
