As per #22509, `DESTDIR` is useful in the cases where the build process needs to hard-code `--prefix` paths in the build output. For example, embedded rpaths. This is not only useful but vital for binary distros who can't write to /usr during a build.

It's less important - and one can get away with only supporting `--prefix` - if the build does not embed these paths. However nowadays `DESTDIR` is a common standard, so it's good to support it regardless.

Since Sage 8.0 currently does not support DESTDIR (and neither did previous versions) I have to carry the following patch in Debian. It would be technically unnecessary after DESTDIR support is introduced, however in Debian we also have a policy to avoid rpath if possible.

Even disregarding Debian, there is no particular reason for Sage to go embedding rpaths in its binaries, it prevents SAGE_LOCAL from being moved to different places around the filesystem. AFAICS, no other part of Sage involves embedding build paths, and one can freely move a SAGE_LOCAL around after applying this patch.
