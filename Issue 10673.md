Note that this works properly for rationals:

```
sage: int(2)**(3/2)
2*sqrt(2)
sage: parent(_)
Symbolic Ring
```

Also, this thing is likely to happen in list comprehensions using `range()`, since that returns Python ints. Right now, this doesn't work as expected:

```
[n^(1.5) for n in range(10)]
```

This passes all doctests and -- with my minimal knowledge of Cython and MPFR -- the code looks very good. I see that the relevant function automatically coerces to complex numbers; would it make sense to add a doctest for negative ints? And maybe zero, to be complete?

```
sage: int(-2)^(0.333333)
0.629961522017056 + 1.09112272417509*I
sage: int(0)^(1.0)
0.000000000000000
sage: int(0)^(0.0)
1.00000000000000
```


My guess is that we'll need to test this on a bunch of platforms to suss out any numerical noise. But other than that, I can give this a weak positive review -- we need someone who knows MPFR and Cython better than I do. (Or, I need to learn more of those things...)

MPFR is platform independent--it's based on gmp/mpir so there's no "numerical noise" issues to worry about as there's no (machine-level) floating point arithmetic.

My knowledge of Cython and MPFR is even more minimal.  But the word "track" is in this ticket, should probably be fixed.

I fixed the "track #10736" bit and added the doctests I mentioned above to the "v2" patch.

Dan, anything you think still needs to be reviewed here?  That would be helpful for any future reviewers - sounds like you want a Cython guru to check it, correct, otherwise all is well?

Yep, just a quick once-over by someone who knows Cython and maybe a bit about MPFR. The code is simple and I can see it's very reasonable (and it fixes the problem!), but I'd like another person to look at it.

Applied patch to sage-4.7.1.alpha2, did 'sage -b' then 'make testlong'.  The patch fixed the reported problem.  All tests passed.  Positive review!
