Sometimes import_statements fails in given a working answer (pi, CIF, ...).

The patch contains a new function which_import_statements_fail that build the list of name in sage.all for which the answer of import_statements fail to import it.

I fixed (checking one by one) all the exceptions in the linked file (except the is_* stuff)... and this is now ready for review !!

It is much more robust but it would be marvellous to detect deprecated stuff (there is a note about that in the documentation of the function).

Helloooooooooooooooooooooooo !!!

Some remarks:

1) Affected ? That's only correct in french I thing. Do you want to translate "variable assignment" ? But I believe that in this context messages like "x is defined by <...>" or "x is equal to <...>" would be clearer.

2) `And one can actually check that FareySymbol and sum are aliases`. Would be better with `:func:`FareySymbol`` for the html doc.

3) If there is an option to display the import line for lazy functions then the output of this function is meant to be copy/pasted. Thus, shouldn't the Warning line begin with a `#` ? Otherwise it is impossible to copy/paste it into Python code.

4) `use it has a name` : as a name.

5) This function is awful. It may be nice to split it into `identify_module`, `identify_object_from_module`, `identify_by_search_through_modules`, `identify_object_from_source_code`, etc ?... Would make the code a bit clearer `:-P`

6) `names_pattern = dict((i,j) for i,j in whatever)` can be rewritten as `{i:j for i,v in whatever}`. Would make your `names_pattern` line clearer.

7) `at the beginig`

8) Why this `print_or_update` function ?

I have not understood everything of the code yet, but fixing the things above might help `^^;`

Hi,

Thanks so much for telling me to rewrite it ! Now it is simpler and cleaner and I hope you will understand everything.

I do have two things to solve before getting this in a needs-review status
* try to not load extra modules in the function `find_objects_from_name` (see the [thread on sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/Ok0s5ViT9dA))
* possibly move the functions `find_objects_from_name` and `find_object_modules` in `sage.misc.sageinspect`

See you soooooooooooon

Hello...

Really I tried, and I don't get a word of what the main function does. I don't get it, I don't get how it does anything, I don't even get at every moment which variables can be assumed to be defined, what is left to be found, I don't get the flow of it. Sorry, I tried and I just don't get it.

If you cannot split it into subfunctions further, please add comments to say from time to time "This has been defined, now we look for this". I just don't get it, all I can do right now is check that three consecutive lines make sense, and that's not doing a very good review job.

I add a small commit with a couple of unimportant modifications.

Some remarks:

- Why is `exclude_pattern` overwritten when module is `None` ?
- "Here we test some instances::" is followed by nothing
- Why should calling `import_statement` on a module raise an exception ? What if I do not know where `graph_decompositions` is located ?

```
sage: import_statements("graph_decompositions")
...
ValueError: the object '<module 'sage.graphs.graph_decompositions' from '/home/ncohen/.Sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/graphs/graph_decompositions/__init__.pyc'>' is a module
```


    More importantly, what should the following code do : raise an exception of continue ?

```
raise ValueError("the object '%s' is a module"%obj)
continue
```

Hello,

Ok. I had many comments into the code, especially about what the variables are.

> - Why is `exclude_pattern` overwritten when module is `None` ?

Because you can crash Sage (really):

```
sage: from sage.misc.dev_tools import load_submodules
sage: load_submodules(sage.libs)
load sage.libs.coxeter3.coxeter_group...failed
load sage.libs.cremona.homspace... suceeded
...
load sage.libs.singular.groebner_strategy... suceeded
sage: quit  # BOOOOOM
```


> - "Here we test some instances::" is followed by nothing

I removed it.

> - Why should calling `import_statement` on a module raise an exception ? What if I do not know where `graph_decompositions` is located ?
> {{{
> sage: import_statements("graph_decompositions")
> ...
> ValueError: the object '<module 'sage.graphs.graph_decompositions' from '/home/ncohen/.Sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/graphs/graph_decompositions/__init__.pyc'>' is a module
> }}}

Fixed.
