It fixes the reported issue.

I was wondering if this was related to bliss? Anyhow, I have bliss installed and with bliss the issue is fixed.

It's related to changes in the ordering of vertices/edges: we don't sort unless mandatory. Typically, for plotting there is no need for sorting the vertices/edges.

Also I forgot to re-install dot2tex after my last dist-clean...
