This seems too slow:


```
sage: A = random_matrix(GF(127),4000,5000)
sage: %time _ = A.echelon_form() # okay
CPU times: user 8.07 s, sys: 0.13 s, total: 8.20 s
Wall time: 8.24 s
sage: %time A.right_kernel() # slow!
CPU times: user 56.33 s, sys: 0.23 s, total: 56.56 s
Wall time: 56.83 s
```

The timings look much better now:

```
