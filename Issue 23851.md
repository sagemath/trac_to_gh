It is very curious as the log shows that `traitlets` is installed and used, and it should have pulled `ipython_genutils` in fact looking at it closer, one can see the failing call is from traitlets. The quoted github issue is most relevant here I think.

In fact it is worse than the github issue. In the github issue, `pip` solves the dependencies, in sage it is done by the master makefile and we still fail.
