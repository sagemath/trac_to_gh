Hi,

* Note that upgrading fplll at this point, wont' make much difference to Sage because the changes over 4.0.4 all affect options which aren't exposed well to Sage. The only difference is doubledouble/quaddouble support, but Sage doesn't install QD anymore.

* There's a new Python interface for fplll https://github.com/malb/fpylll which is partly based on Sage's, but much more flexible. I intend to make it available to Sage as well but I'll need to figure out how to do type conversions nicely, how to deal with not-installed optional packages (QD) and how to deal with competing interrupt handlers.

* I should probably be the upstream contact. I'll push an update as soon as my local Sage install is out of ATLAS tuning hell â€¦

Well, the main motivation for this ticket was #19701 and it helps with that.

But even if the change is small, it doesn't hurt to do it.
