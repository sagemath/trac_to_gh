```
sage: R = QQbar['s,t']
sage: type(R({(1,2): 3}).coefficients()[0])
<type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>
```

but it should be an element of `QQbar`.

This results in an error in the laurent polynomial code:

```
sage: L.<a,b> = LaurentPolynomialRing(QQbar)
sage: (a+a*b) // a
```

raises an `AttributeError` as an Python `int` does not have a `divides`-method. (The Python `int` comes from line 1600 in `laurent_polynomial.pyx`, but the true problem is the one at the top.

It looks like it just doesn't coerce each of the coefficients into the base ring when constructing the elements (and is something we should do).

The branch u/dkrenn/laurent-floor-hash does at least fix the symptome, so that

```
sage: L.<a,b> = LaurentPolynomialRing(QQbar)
sage: (a+a*b) // a
```

returns a result.
