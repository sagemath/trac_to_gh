```
sage: Family([])                                                                                                                            
Family ()
sage: bool(_)                                                                                                                               
True
```

Compare with:

```
sage: bool(dict())                                                                                                                          
False
```

I added the simple `__bool__` check to the appropriate class:

```
sage: type(Family([]))
<class 'sage.sets.family.TrivialFamily_with_category'>
sage: type(Family({}))
<class 'sage.sets.family.FiniteFamily_with_category'>
```

Shouldn't there also be a change for `FiniteFamily`?

Indeed, there should be. I also added one for `LazyFamily`.
