On 32-bit:

```
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/symbolic/expression.pyx", line 4882, in sage.symbolic.expression.Expression.expand
Failed example:
    ((a + b + c)^30 * (3*b + d - 5/d)^3).expand().subs(a=0,b=2,c=-1)
Expected:
    d^3 + 18*d^2 + 93*d - 465/d + 450/d^2 - 125/d^3 + 36  
Got:

I don't have time to push a branch until tomorrow, but I think that (for 9.3) we can solve the problem by weakening the doctest so that it works for both 64-bit and 32-bit. Maybe:

```
sage: a,b,c,d = var("a b c d")
sage: f = ((a + b + c)^30 * (3*b + d - 5/d)^3).expand().subs(a=0,b=2,c=-1)
sage: sum(sign(s) * (abs(ZZ(s)) % ZZ(2^20)) * d^i for s,i in f.coefficients())
d^3 + 18*d^2 + 93*d - 465/d + 450/d^2 - 125/d^3 + 36
```

This doctest looks a bit strange, but overall this is good enough as a hotfix for 9.3 for this severe bug.
