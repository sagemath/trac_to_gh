I have seen this on two occasions seemingly randomly appear. Once it appears, the only fix is to remove the generated workspaces:

Unhandled SIGFPE: An unhandled floating point exception occurred.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* module has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off().
Python will now terminate.

```


I'm setting this to blocker because this never appeared with Sage 7.5.1 or before. So my guess is that #20914 might be responsible.

did you see this on the same system?

Replying to [comment:1 dimpase]:

Yes. Twice on my laptop where I do all my Sage development. For example, this time I was doing some Cython development, then I went back to the `develop` branch and got this error.

Now I'm getting a `SIGSEGV` here:

it's baffling to me that you get SIGFPEs, for GAP doesn't really do floating point things. Do you have a weird list of GAP packages installed?

Also integer division by 0 gives a `SIGFPE`, run `cython(*print(<int>1 // <int>0)*)` for example.

> Do you have a weird list of GAP packages installed?

No, this is on a mostly clean installation of Sage where I regularly run `make distclean`.

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2017-03-10 12:54:44

The last time (from [comment:3]) was again after doing some Cython development and downgrading from 7.6.beta6 (#22554 to be precise) to 7.6.beta4 (#22471 to be precise).

Comment by dimpase created at 2017-03-10 13:01:48

could it be #22437 ? Did you see this before the latter was merged?
(in case you have a stale bunch of `gap/` headers somewhere...)

Just a guess here...

The code for `libGAP_RNamName` (see ticket description) has this line

```
pos = (pos % libGAP_SizeRNam) + 1;
```

This would give a `SIGFPE` in case `libGAP_SizeRNam == 0`.

In both cases, the problem goes away after removing the generated GAP workspaces. So it cannot be a compilation issue.

I'm wondering if this is related to #20421 somehow. Maybe a race condition in writing the workspace, leading to corruption?


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2017-03-10 13:18:15

I just recompiled GAP and libGAP with `SAGE_DEBUG=yes` (on top of 7.6.beta4). After doing that, the workspaces were regenerated automatically and everything worked again.

I then restored the corrupted workspace from [comment:3] that I had saved in a separate directory and the corruption appeared again. Traceback:

Corrupt workspaces almost always crash GAP (or libGAP), no wonder.

Comment by vbraun created at 2017-03-15 19:23:05

I'm not sure if gap workspaces are compatible between normal and debug builds.

Presumably the issue is mitated by #22570

I'm leaning towards not making this a blocker

We don't know, but at least we can hope...

> I'm leaning towards not making this a blocker

I think it should either be a blocker or closed as duplicate of #22570.
