# Issue 15006: Change algoritm for K.uniformizer(P)

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2013-09-30 13:47:42

As shown by #14476, it is annoying that the following depends on the hardware:

```
sage: K.<t> = NumberField(x^4 - x^3 - 3*x^2 - x + 1)
sage: [K.uniformizer(P) for P,e in factor(K.ideal(5))]
```


Moreover, the algorithm for `K.uniformizer()` seems inefficient: instead of calling `idealappr()`, we can simply use the second component of the `pari_prime()` structure. Experiments show that this yields equal results for 32-bit and 64-bit machines (but there is no guarantee).

Could you explain the first two hunks of your patch?

The change to `sage/libs/pari/decl.pxi` is to remove a duplicate definition of `stackdummy()` (and is technically unrelated to this patch). The change to `sage/libs/pari/gen.pyx` is to use a version of `idealappr()` with an extra flag, see

```
gp> ?idealappr
idealappr(nf,x,{flag=0}): x being a fractional ideal, gives an element b such that v_p(b)=v_p(x) for all prime ideals p dividing x, and v_p(b)>=0 for all other p. If 
(optional) flag is non-null x must be a prime ideal factorization with possibly zero exponents.
```

Thanks.  Patch looks good, testing now on 64-bit...32 will take longer....

..getting some 32-bit errors in number_field.py, full report when it finishes.

On 32-bit:

```
sage -t --long devel/sage/sage/rings/number_field/number_field.py  # 2 doctests failed
sage -t --long devel/sage/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_number_field.py  # 3 doctests failed
sage -t --long devel/sage/sage/rings/number_field/number_field_ideal.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long devel/sage/sage/rings/residue_field.pyx  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long devel/sage/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_local_data.py  # 1 doctest failed
```

I will give further details later but will not have access to the 32-bit machine again until the evening.

Strange, all tests pass for me on 32-bit. Are you sure you don't have any other patches applied (apart from #14476 and #15243)?

I am pretty confident in that but will check.  The machine is at home though, and I no longer have a 32-bit desktop in my office, so cannot do it before this evening.

It's certainly getting harder to test 32-bit builds these days!

To confirm:  this was sage-5.12.beta4 and the only patches applied are 

```
trac_14476_bugs_in_local_data.patch
trac_14476_trac_links.patch
15243_uniformizer.patch
```

Here are some details:

I don't know what to say, it works for me...

Just to be sure, can you remove all patches, re-download and apply them and do `./sage -b` and test again?

OK, I did that.  What happens is that the third patch, the one on this ticket, fails to apply properly (which I had not noticed before).  I get sage/libs/pari/gen.pyx.rej:

```
--- gen.pyx
+++ gen.pyx
`@``@` -7012,7 +7012,7 `@``@`
     def idealappr(self, x, long flag=0):
         t0GEN(x)
         pari_catch_sig_on()
-        return self.new_gen(idealappr(self.g, t0))
+        return self.new_gen(idealappr0(self.g, t0, flag))
 
     def idealcoprime(self, x, y):
```

-- could this be because I am using 5.12.beta4 and not beta5 or later?  I am now in a position to build a newer version on this 32-bit machine if needed.

Yes, indeed. Or just apply #15124.

With the extra dependency satisfied all is well, and all tests pass on a 32-bit machine too.  Positive review!

Resolution: fixed
