# Issue 3990: Developer's guide should have a definite list of pragmas for doctests

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/3990

Original creator: malb

Original creation time: 2008-08-29 11:29:00

Assignee: tba

CC:  malb jhpalmieri mhansen

This list includes:
 * `#32-bit` and `#64-bit`
 * `#random`
 * `#optional`
 * `#long`

Most are already mentioned, but 32-bit/64-bit is definitely missing. This ticket should be tackled after the Sphinx-isation of the Developer's guide.
