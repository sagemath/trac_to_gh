I have found the problem, in lines 190-199 in ell_rational_field.py.  It copies the points from the database curve in a way which does not change te curve those points lie on.

It would appear that I have made a serious error. I did run doctests, and they passed. I will admit to the possibility of having made a rookie mistake and tested the wrong copy of sage on my machine. 

Another possible explanation is that I didn't have the large Cremona database installed when I applied the patch. So I applied the patch THEN installed the database and it seems the doctests passed under those circumstances.

I'm running to tests again to see what happened.
