Currently there is no way in Sage to determine if a dynamical system has potential good reduction.

We add a potential_good_reduction function which computes if a dynamical system on projective space of dimension 1 over a number field has potential good reduction.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30141
