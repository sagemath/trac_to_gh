In function `prime_to_m_part(m,n)` from `misc.py` the examples in docstrings 
don't call the function but call instance method instead.



```
sage: 240.prime_to_m_part(2)
15
```


should be 


```
sage: prime_to_m_part(240,2)
15
```

I think that it is also nice to advertise that there is a method. For example you could add after the other examples

```
Note also that integers also have a method with the same name::

    sage: 240.prime_to_m_part(2)
    15
```

The aim of the documentation is multiple: doctest + user documentation.
