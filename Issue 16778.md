I see you didn't apply Julien's ntl patch for that release. Any particular reason for that?

An oversight on my part, I had not even seen the pull request.  I will sort this out tomorrow and produce a 20140921 version  Sorry.

Also a wget-able link for the tarball would be nice...

The next version will, I promise.  It was too late and I did not bother searching on other tickets for the right syntax, hoping that someone like you might edit it for me...

Since yesterday the new upstream tarball has changed (and has a new name/version number) and the branch updated accordingly.

The ticket title says 20140921 while the tarball says 20140920, which one is correct?

The changes themselves are trivial but the branch needs to be updated too.

Well I am 100% sure that I did tat push, but the evidence is against me...  on checking my bash history I see that I pushed it to 17105 instead of 17015.  This has now been corrected!
