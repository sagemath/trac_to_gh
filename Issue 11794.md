(The home base for this ticket is the Lion ticket #11881.)

See the discussion at #11884.  To fix this we may need to slightly modify the Maxima spkg, at least for now.

My first guess about a way to solve this problem was to add the two lines

```
(require :cmp)
(setf c::*compile-in-constants* t)

I realize that Sage doesn't start yet (#11967).  But can you try

```
./sage -maxima
```

and see if the Maxima standalone binary works fine?  If not, we have problems, but presumably it will.

Good question, which I wondered about.    It seems to work on other platforms, and logically it makes sense to me that it should be the right thing to do.    However, I'm not very knowledgable about the subtleties of lisp compilation.

The following tests failed:


	sage -t -long "devel/sage/sage/interfaces/maxima.py"
	sage -t -long "devel/sage/sage/interfaces/maxima_abstract.py"
	sage -t -long "devel/sage/sage/interfaces/maxima_lib.py"
```


I think that's most probably "just" due to ECL (or Boehm GC?), i.e. #11884, so I could otherwise give this ticket a positive review... ;-)

Anyway, someone would have to look at my reviewer changes.

Btw., there's an `spkg-dist` script apparently nobody used recently (I added a comment on that to `SPKG.txt`), which deletes the following (and creates dummy `Makefile.in`s):

Oooops, one should perhaps run `./sage -b` after installing a new ECL spkg... B)

By the way, the new ECL + patched Maxima spkgs work with both the boehm_gc-7.2.alpha6.p0 (from #11883) and the boehm_gc-7.1.p7 spkg.
