# Issue 21909: Symbolic eta function

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22146

Original creator: rws

Original creation time: 2017-01-07 08:04:27

There is code in Pynac for symbolic `eta` but it's not used by any class in `src/sage/functions`. At the moment `misc.functional.eta` does numerics only.
