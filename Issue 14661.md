Keywords: differential geometry, tensor calculus

This is the first draft of [SageManifolds](http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr), a project to implement differential geometry and tensor calculus in Sage. It is still at a very early stage; current functionalities include:

* differentiable mappings and submanifolds
* standard tensor calculus (tensor product, contraction, (anti)symmetrization)
* exterior calculus (wedge product, exterior derivative of differential forms)
* Lie derivatives
* affine connections
* curvature and torsion
* pseudo-Riemannian metrics
* Hodge duality

More details on the page [http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr](http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr)

The package is still very preliminary. Future developments will focuss on
- the implementation of Sage Parent/Element scheme for a better integration in Sage
- adding new functionalities (e.g. extrinsic geometry of submanifolds, spinors)
- producing faster code by migrating some parts to Cython
Volonteers are welcome !

Hellooooooo guys !!

Very recently a very large amount of code dealing with matroids was accepted into Sage (#7477). This project had been developped outside of Sage for a while (it was 21 000 lines long), and the authors then wanted ot make it a real part of Sage.

The problem is that the source code that makes it into Sage normally gets reviewed before, and we were not able to review the matroids code as we usually do as it was really, really too large.
(And appeared to be VERY clean, too).
Now it appears that your code is already 16 000 lines long, and so it would be very very very nice if you could begin to think right now of how it should be split into small "reviewable" pieces if you ever want to have you code included into Sage, not as a spkg but as a real standard code.

I personally felt very guilty to see all this code make it into Sage without discussions and reviews `^^;`

Have fuuuuuuuuuuun anyway !!

Nathann

Dear Nathann,

I see your point. However note that it was difficult to submit the package at an earlier stage for it was very fluctuating: various trials were performed and new classes/functionalities were introduced and then removed. The current version is, I think, the first one showable and to be discussed. It can be considered as a more or less stable root for expanding the package. To have a minimum of chart/frame flexibility and a minimum of tensor calculus (with symmetries/antisymmetries properly delt with), it required these 16,000 lines. Not however that not all of them are Python code: there is a lot of docstrings. Maybe the Python code is only one third of the total. If, hopefully, SageManifolds is integrated into Sage some day, it should be much larger than 16,000 lines.

+1. Larger/more experimental projects need a more nimble approach to experimenting and trying out their interface. Including little tidbits into sage early on takes away the ability to easily change API/interface/design (that's hard enough without all the bureaucracy the sage patch system imposes).

The development system of sage is geared towards stable, production quality code (regardless of whether that's attained), and that is incompatible with experimental, fast development.

I suspect we'd get the best quality if someone would first write a package independently (building on sage or another computer algebra system) and, once that system proves its worth, reimplement it as sage library code. The duplication of effort in that system is a bit unfortunate and, in practice, probably prohibitive. I don't think we know yet what the best solution is.

Note that for attracting funding, the "independent package" system is better: First you may be able to attract funding for developing a brand new package with revolutionary functionality. Later you can attract funding for ensuring that this revolutionary package gets integrated with other math software, so that it can interoperate with other systems. It also helps the authors more, because there's the independent entity to point to as accomplishment, rather than just an amorphous set of patches or files in the sage library.

Do I understand correctly: The project is *not* intended to be an optional/standard spkg (so, the attached spkg is obsolete), but is purely in the Sage library?

Are the installation instructions from comment:15 really relevant? After all, there is a branch attached to this ticket, so, `git trac checkout 14865` or `sage --dev checkout ticket=14865` should do the job, isn't it?

Yes the ultimate goal is that it is fully integrated into Sage library. 
Indeed the attached spkg are obsolete.

The branch attached to this ticket is sticked to version 0.5 (until version 0.6 is released), while the github repository mentionned in comment:15 contains the development version. See also the section "Installing the latest development version" in [his page](http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/download.html). If you want version 0.5 only, `git trac checkout 14865` is indeed sufficient (after you have installed #15916 of course).
