Keywords: multivariate polynomial containment

A bug in containment for multivariate polynomial rings:

```
sage: A1.<a> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: 3 in A1
True

sage: A2.<a,b> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: 3 in A2
False 

sage: A1(a) in A2
False
```

This occurs because `__contains__(self,x)` for multivariate polynomial rings simply tests whether the parent of `x` is `self`.  Instead, it should inherit `__contains__` from the class `Parent`.  Further discussion can be found on this [sage-devel thread](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/dab74506d9ff94bf).

Hi Andrey,

I'm working on a very simple bug in containment for multivariate polynomials, but the obvious fix is causing doctest failures in your `toric_variety.py` code, which I'm afraid I don't understand.  Could you help me figure out what the basic problem is, so that I can try to fix it? (Note that almost all of the sage library seems to work fine; `toric_variety.py` is the only file with significant failures.)

Details can be found on this ticket page, or I can write to you separately. (you can find my email at [http://nilesjohnson.net](http://nilesjohnson.net))

thanks,
Niles

It was fixing the issue due to the changes of this ticket, but it was actually more of a bug, so I attached an alternative version and added a little doctest checking that plain numbers are also interpreted correctly as polynomials.

I decided to add the doctest to the `__init__` method for 3 reasons:

* keeps the doctest in the file which defines multivariate polynomial rings
* `__init__` is one of the "closest" methods (in `multi_polynomial_ring_generic.py`) to the `Parent` class
* Having the test in the docstring for an underscore method means that it won't appear in any of the Sage documentation -- for this test, I think that's appropriate.
