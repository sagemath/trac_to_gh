Hello,

Did the reviewer really test the code before setting it to positive review?!

```
sage: t = Tableau([[1,2],[3]])
sage: t.leq(1)
TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for '+':
'Integer Ring' and '<type 'str'>'
```


The line

```
             raise TypeError(secondtab + " must be a tableau")
```

is wrong since only string can be concatenated to strings.

Uhm... this is undefined behavior, on a meaningless input.

This is just a method called `leq`. It does not override the generic comparison of tableaux with things.

The problem is not the meaningless input in my example. Two lines were added in this ticket to take care of this case and are completely wrong. Just look at commit â€‹ba5143c

```
+ if not secondtab in Tableaux():
+     raise TypeError(secondtab + " must be a tableau")
```
