Hum, I am only at 2.5.5 in sage-on-gentoo and that's not vulnerable. Hum, `spkg-install` doesn't do anything special that will need updating for that version so it should be all good.

Yes, 2.5.5 is also good.

I can confirm that it fixes original issue (made fresh build, all tests passed and saving to svg no longer segfaults)
