# Issue 30117: Remove cddlib spkg-src useless file

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30354

Original creator: tmonteil

The `spkg-src` file is now useless for `cddlib` package as `checksums.ini` now provides a `upstream_url`, and it is not used anyway. Let us remove that file.
