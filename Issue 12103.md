Attachment [trac_12275_plot3d_warn.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket12275/trac_12275_plot3d_warn.patch) by max created at 2012-03-21 22:43:22

I added warnings for unused keyword arguments in Graphics3d.show (warnings seemed more appropriate, it would be easy to replace with an error though). In doing so doctest found some bugs elsewhere in sage, which I also fixed.

plot/circle.py:
The doctest attempted to graph a 3d circle like it was a 3d circle. This caused errors as the 2d and 3d plotting parameters are different. A simple variable rename fixed the issue.

geometry/lattice_polytype.py:
LatticePolytypeClass.show incorrectly set axis=False. Instead, it should be axes=False. I fixed this as well.

I'm not quite sure what the problem is with plot/circle.py.  It seems like you just renamed `c` to `c3d`, which shouldn't make any difference... but maybe I'm missing something.

This needs rebasing.

I'm just not sure what the point of `verify` is.  If an option is invalid, it's invalid.

Can you try to explain exactly why changing the name of `c` to `c3d` made a difference?  I can only assume it's something in your code, but this is totally baffling to me.
