This lets the scipy-1.7.2 spkg build for me.

Thanks for the fix and for sending pull requests
to Boost and opening an issue for SciPy.

Should the the patch or the commit messages
mention the inspiration is from FreeBSD?

Or is the discussion here enough?

One way or the other, you can set to
positive review on my behalf.
