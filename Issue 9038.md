# Issue 9038: Typeset: Wrong charset for Greek characters

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jan

Original creation time: 2010-05-24 19:42:07

Assignee: jason, was

Client: Ubuntu Karmic 9.10 with jsmath 3.5.9, jsmath-fonts 1.3-2, ttf-jsmath, and Firefox 3.5.9.

Server: Either http://www.sagebn.org or Debian Lenny with Sage 4.4.2 compiled from source

When displaying a formula containing "pi" with "Typeset" checked, the character Ãš (capital U with accent) is displayed instead of the pi character.

This is most likely a problem with the ttf-jsmath package.  See http://www.math.union.edu/~dpvc/jsMath/download/jsMath-fonts.html

"Linux users with Firefox 3.5 should use the last archive in the list, as the Linux version of Firefoex 3.5 can not process the non-standard encoding used in the other archives."

Can you install the linux firefox 3.5 fonts listed in the website above and see if that fixes the problem?

You were right. After removing ttf-jsmath and installing the downloaded fonts it works. Thank you.
