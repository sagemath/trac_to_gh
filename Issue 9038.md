This is most likely a problem with the ttf-jsmath package.  See http://www.math.union.edu/~dpvc/jsMath/download/jsMath-fonts.html

"Linux users with Firefox 3.5 should use the last archive in the list, as the Linux version of Firefoex 3.5 can not process the non-standard encoding used in the other archives."

Can you install the linux firefox 3.5 fonts listed in the website above and see if that fixes the problem?
