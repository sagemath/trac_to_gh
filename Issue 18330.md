How to add an iterator over maximal sublattices of a lattice? I think that the algorithm is not too complicated. Basically we from 1 to n on elements.

Lets suppose that sublattice generated by elements 2,4,5 is not whole lattice. Now try to add 6. If it generates element 1 or 3, we will skip it. That's because if for example 1,2,4,6,8 is a maximal sublattice, then it had been generated already (we have tried all sublattices containing 1 before going to those that does not contain 1).

There might be a room for improvement by somehow arranging elements. But time for it is, I think, after we have some working code.

There is now some code that at least seems to work. This is quite interesting optimization problem. Can this be made to real `maximal_sublattices_iterator()` instead of `maximal_sublattices()` (that internally generates some non-maximal sublattices and then discards them).

I tried googling some time, but find no algorithm for this. This is somewhat ad hoc solution.

Two minor things:

- I think you could change the test `sorted([sorted(list(x)) for x in ms])` to `sorted(ms, key=sorted)` (note that I didn't actually try this).

- Could you add a space around the `<` comparisons to help improve readability?

Kevin, if you want to do the full review, please go ahead. I'm not sure I will have enough time to throughly test this.
