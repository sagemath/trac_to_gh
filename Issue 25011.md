A bit of background to this fix:  Python 3.4 introduced a new API to the `multiprocessing` module that uses application-specific *contexts* for all state related to multiprocessing, rather than the old way of relying entirely on module-global state (though there is a concept of a default context).  This also enables it to offer different strategies for process spawning.

Here we just keep the existing functionality as-is, but slightly update how the `multiprocessing` module is used in this module to use a context for it instead, while still keeping backwards compatibility on Python 2.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25248
