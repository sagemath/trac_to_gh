# Issue 23388: Some errors in LatticePoset

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23625

Original creator: jmantysalo

Original creation time: 2017-08-16 11:13:46

1) `Posets.DiamondPoset(5).is_join_distributive(certificate=True)` gives "global name 'DiGraph' is not defined".

2) Same applies to `is_meet_distributive`.

3) In the doc of `is_join_pseudocomplemented` a "greatest" should be "least".

4) `is_vertically_decomposable` has some mutually exclusive properties.

5) Some seealso-blocks still have a link in "stronger properties" that should be in "weaker properties".

6) I'll add more to the list, but wait until #23622 gets closed before fixing them.
