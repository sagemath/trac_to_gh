As noted in #14480, there are still some references to mercurial left in the doctests, even in the new git integrated repository. These should be removed.

A similar patch is in #15120, changeset:6912669a7da6c5754663fb9a0ef6d29cdb73f38b. I suggest we go with that ticket (doesn't really matter which imho)

Andrew merged #15120 into his `build_system branch`, so we should really close this ticket now.
