CC:  @nthiery

This code from `src/sage/categories/coercion_methods.pyx` looks like a potential infinite loop:

```
    if have_same_parent_c(self, right) and hasattr(self, "_add_"):
        return self._add_(right)
    return coercion_model.bin_op(self, right, operator.add)
```


The `hasattr(self, "_add_")` clause is bad: if there is no `_add_`, the coercion model will just call `__add__`, which calls the coercion model, which calls `__add__`...

Solution: remove the `hasattr(self, "_add_")`.

Hopefully the whole module `coercion_methods.pyx` can be removed in #20767 and then the problem will disappear by itself.
