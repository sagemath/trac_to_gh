# Issue 15825: DiGraph.is_aperiodic: new method (wraps networkx method)

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16062

Original creator: cheuberg

Original creation time: 2014-04-06 08:15:19

CC:  dkrenn

Keywords: digraph

This simply wraps the networkx method of the same method, but wrapping it may help to find the function in the sage documentation. Furthermore, other code calling DiGraph.is_aperiodic would
benefit from eventual other implementations for other backends.

Looks good. Could you add a link toward `http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aperiodic_graph` in the doc ?
