# Issue 16795: bad behaviour of simplicial complex automorphism

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17032

Original creator: chapoton

Original creation time: 2014-09-24 08:54:09

CC:  ncohen

Keywords: simplicial, automorphism

When a simplicial complex has tuples as vertices, the automorphism group is wrong: it is always returned as the trivial group.
