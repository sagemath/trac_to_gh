# Issue 17548: crash in matrix.subs

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17785

Original creator: cnassau

Original creation time: 2015-02-15 13:31:14

Keywords: crash, substitution

The following code gives a coredump in Sage-6.5.rc3:

```
a11,a12,a13,a21,a22,a23,a31,a32,a33 = allvars = var("a11,a12,a13,a21,a22,a23,a31,a32,a33")
P=PolynomialRing(QQ,allvars,order='degrevlex')
P.inject_variables()
A=matrix([[a11,a12,a13,],[a21,a22,a23,],[a31,a32,a33]])
A.subs(a11=a13,a21=-a23,a31=a33,a22=0)
```

Hello,

This is actually unrelated to matrices

```
sage: a22.subs(None,a11=a13,a21=-a23,a31=a33,a22=0)
...
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred in Sage.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* component of Sage has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off().
Sage will now terminate.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
```


(and as a sided remark, it is useless to declare the variables with `var`; the command `var` creates variables in the symbolic ring which have nothing to do with the variables of the polynomial ring)

Simpler examples with three variables `R.<x,y,z> = QQ[]`

```
sage: x.subs(None,y=x,x=0,z=y)
sage: x.subs(None,x=0,y=x,z=x)
sage: x.subs(None,x=0,y=0,z=x)
```

Changing priority from minor to critical.

Changing keywords from "crash, substitution" to "crash, SIGSEGV, substitution".
