Keywords: crash, substitution

The following code gives a coredump in Sage-6.5.rc3:

```

Hello,

This is actually unrelated to matrices

```
sage: a22.subs(None,a11=a13,a21=-a23,a31=a33,a22=0)
...
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred in Sage.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* component of Sage has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off().
Sage will now terminate.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
```


(and as a sided remark, it is useless to declare the variables with `var`; the command `var` creates variables in the symbolic ring which have nothing to do with the variables of the polynomial ring)

Vincent
