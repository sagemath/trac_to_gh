P.P.S.:  There are IMHO a couple of issues related to this we should report and fix upstream, but on another ticket, as this is just for working around the current brokenness *in Sage*.

After all, I'm not patching `configure.ac`, just `configure`, which is also much easier to maintain.

Well, what was the reason to change the patch to `configure` at all?

If someone now changes `spkg-install`, it's again broken.

The --with-all forces all --with-XXX to yes, therefore --with-maple was not working.

I suggest to simply change the `--with-all="$SAGE_LOCAL"` with `--with-default="$SAGE_LOCAL"`.

This seems to be a simpler/smaller fix and works on my box.
Let me know how it works on yours before I mess up with Dima's patch.

See my previous comments; IMHO there are things to get fixed *in other ways* upstream (besides the compiler errors themselves), I'll probably post on a further ticket, since here we just want to fix the Sage build.

Of course. This is now [https://github.com/linbox-team/linbox/issues/38](https://github.com/linbox-team/linbox/issues/38)

> (besides the compiler errors themselves),

I'm not sure to have found which one you're referring to.

For me, the option `--with-all` is the bug here, as we definitely do not need/want LinBox to look for all of its possible dependencies.
The `--with-default` is the one we want, to specify the common folder where to find the dependencies that are turned on when found (namely fflas-ffpack, NTL, IML).

I see no point in adding a patch to the configure file.
