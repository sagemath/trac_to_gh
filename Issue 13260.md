There are many places within the Sage library that make explicit references to `SAGE_ROOT`, when `SAGE_LOCAL`, `SAGE_DATA`, etc. are more appropriate. These references assume a particular directory structure which unnecessarily break various components when using a different directory structure (i.e. transitioning to git or sage-on-gentoo). This ticket aims to correct most of these references.

This ticket also adds `sage.env` as a place to keep global used Sage variables (these currently live in `sage.misc.misc`). Currently this file does little more than separate out these variables, but the intent is to provide a dedicated place in python for determining the environment for the Sage library (this will eventually need to be independent of `sage-env` if we are ever to truly transition to argparse).

I don't think there is duplication if `sage/env.py` simply reads the environment variables set by `sage-env`.  I see it as a library interface to the `sage-env` script.

I didn't create any new variables like SAGE_SRC and SAGE_LIB, that was a lot of work as it is.

No, if you look a little further down, I change a `path_to_zsolve+'zsolve'` to just `path_to_zsolve` -- this is a little cleaner, and it removes the string arithmetic that should be `os.path.join`'s.

I missed that line.

Is the replacement of SAGE_INC in setup.py (well spotted the one where it is still SAGE_LOCAL/include) by CPATH really necessary? That's the only place CPATH is used and you don't use it in module_list.py anyway.

Apart from this I am positive that it should go in while it is easy to apply. We may do some more work on this later.

```

Ok, updated the patch. Added the fix for `cython.py` suggested and reverted `CPATH` to `SAGE_INC` and it is no longer defined in `env.py`. I also modified `module_list.py` to use the new module as well.

Good point, I think Jeroen tries to make sure that all versions back to 4.8 can still upgrade. This should still work even for those versions since the sage library implicitly depends on SAGE_ROOT_REPO, but just to be sure, I've added a tiny patch to the root repository to make this dependency explicit.

If you want people to use these variables "correctly", you'd better document them somewhere. I hope you're working on a follow-up ticket for this...

I made a ticket for documenting development environment variables at #14262 -- I probably won't get around to it for another week/week and a half, as I'm mainly prepping for Sage Days 47 (and then might not get a chance to work on it at the Sage Days).

Sorry to revive an old ticket, but the people involved here might be able to answer the best: what is the rationale behind the variable substitution used in `sage/env.py`? That is, what is the advantage to doing the string substitution `"$SAGE_LOCAL" --> SAGE_ENV['SAGE_LOCAL']`, rather than just using the (already defined) variable `SAGE_LOCAL`? Using an example from the file, why use

```
_add_variable_or_fallback('SAGE_ETC',        opj('$SAGE_LOCAL', 'etc'))
```

instead of

```
_add_variable_or_fallback('SAGE_ETC',        opj(SAGE_LOCAL, 'etc'))
```


I am asking because there is a bug in the variable substitution (which I attempted to address in #23758): the variable substitution is done by iterating over `SAGE_ENV.items()`, which I think has no well-defined order, yet the order in which the substitution is done can matter, for example if you have variables `SAGE_LOCAL` and `SAGE_LOCAL_OTHER`, "$SAGE_LOCAL_OTHER" matches both as a string. In #23762, the possibility has been raised of removing the variable substitution altogether, so I want to know what we would be losing if we do this.
