The `fast_callable` function is great -- perfect for the application I had in mind, which was running Newton-Raphson on a polynomial of large degree.  Unfortunately, it seems `fast_callable` is implemented recursively, and maybe "blows the stack" as soon as the degree of the input gets large.   Here's an example, which fails on both 64-bit Linux *and* OS X:

```
sage: R.<x> = CC[];  f = R.random_element(degree=30000)
sage:  time g = fast_callable(f, CC)                   
/home/wstein/sage/sage-4.7.2.alpha2/local/bin/sage-sage: line 301: 15849 Segmentation fault      sage-ipython "$@" -i
```

This works as advertised, but is slow on large input.  I'd like to use fast_callable with / instead of polynomial_compiled, but that doesn't look promising so far since it takes so long to build the fast_callable.  


```
sage: R.<x> = CC[];  f = R.random_element(degree=600000)
sage: time f(1)
63.7162567572333 - 243.107542673361*I
Time: CPU 1.62 s, Wall: 1.62 s
sage: time f(1)
63.7162567572333 - 243.107542673361*I
Time: CPU 1.59 s, Wall: 1.60 s
sage: time g = fast_callable(f,CC)
Time: CPU 32.33 s, Wall: 32.41 s
sage: time g(1)
63.7162567572333 - 243.107542673361*I
Time: CPU 0.74 s, Wall: 0.74 s
```



Here's a slightly more reasonable example.

```
sage: R.<x> = CC[];  f = R.random_element(degree=20000)
sage: time f(1)                                        
67.4816349551299 + 91.7847423047406*I
Time: CPU 0.09 s, Wall: 0.09 s
sage: time f(1)                                        
67.4816349551299 + 91.7847423047406*I
Time: CPU 0.05 s, Wall: 0.06 s
sage: time g = fast_callable(f,CC)                     
Time: CPU 0.38 s, Wall: 0.38 s
sage: time g(1)                                        
67.4816349551299 + 91.7847423047406*I
Time: CPU 0.04 s, Wall: 0.04 s
sage: 
```


This is not significantly slower than the old version, so I'm accepting the patch
