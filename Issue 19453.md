Nathann, you already saw this in #19383, so I guess this is an easy review.

Documentation could be extended and said that Dedekind-Macneille completion of standard example is the Boolean lattice. (That is, this is also kind of standard example showing that completion by cuts can be exponential in size.) But then, doc can not say every mathematical fact.

What kind of reference? Googling founds books "Handbook of Discrete and Combinatorial Mathematics" and "Introduction to Lattice Theory with Computer Science Applications" and there are many papers. And Wikipedia uses the term.

But what is more important, I have not seen this poset named as something else, and neither seen "standard poset" used to refer any other poset.

I don't know why you are resistant to adding a reference; what harm can it possibly cause? Can't adding a reference only improve the situation? Anyway, you asked my opinion. At least one other person expressed the same opinion. Use wikipedia or use some other reference; I'm not a poset expert, so I don't know what reference would be most definitive.

I would add both references.

I made a few tweaks to the documentation. Once you add the references, you can set this to a positive review on my behalf (in part because I can't think of a better name at this point).
