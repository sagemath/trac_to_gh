```
sage: hex = LatticePoset({1: [2, 3], 2: [4], 3: [5], 4: [6], 5: [6]})
sage: hex.is_subdirectly_reducible()
True
sage: hex.is_subdirectly_reducible(certificate=True)
(False,
 (Finite lattice containing 5 elements, Finite lattice containing 5 elements))
```

is confusing, it should be `True`, I think.

Of course, my bad. Thanks for correcting.

This shows a defect in `src/sage/tests/finite_poset.py`, I'll open a ticket for that.
