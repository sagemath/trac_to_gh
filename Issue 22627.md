Hello,

I had some troubles with my laptop recently, I need to recompile Sage... Which will obviously take a while `:)`.
I'll review this as soon as my compilations completes.

Best,

David

Closing tickets in the sage-duplicate/invalid/wontfix module with positive_review (i.e. someone has confirmed they should be closed).
