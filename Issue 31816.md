```

The `coloring` method of Steiner triple systems
calls `MixedIntegerLinearProgram`, which takes
a `solver` argument, defaulting to `None`, in
which case `default_mip_solver` is used.

Testing on two different Sage installations:

```
sage: default_mip_solver()
'Glpk'
sage: len(designs.steiner_triple_system(7).coloring())
3
```


```
sage: default_mip_solver()
'Coin'
sage: len(designs.steiner_triple_system(7).coloring())
2
```


A previous report was at #30637.

bug is in line 2048 of src/sage/combinat/designs/incidence_structures.py

```
return self.coloring(k)
```

Recursive call loses value of `solver`:

```
sage: designs.steiner_triple_system(7).coloring(solver="literally whatever")
[[1, 2, 3, 4], [0, 5, 6]]
```

fix would be 

```
return self.coloring(k, solver=solver)
```

That wolud lead to

```
sage: designs.steiner_triple_system(7).coloring(solver="GLPK")
[[0, 1], [3], [2, 4, 5, 6]]
sage: designs.steiner_triple_system(7).coloring(solver="Coin")
[[1, 2, 3, 4], [0, 5, 6]]
sage: designs.steiner_triple_system(7).coloring(solver="PPL")
[[0, 1, 2, 5], [3], [4, 6]]

I won't have time to work on this before mid August unfortunately.
