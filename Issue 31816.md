On Ubuntu 18.04 with 9.4.beta3 with the following installed optional packages:


```
Using --optional=4ti2,build,ccache,cryptominisat,debian,dochtml,dot2tex,
e_antic,fricas,glucose,latte_int,lidia,normaliz,notedown,
pandoc_attributes,pip,pycosat,pynormaliz,rst2ipynb,sage,
sage_numerical_backends_coin,sage_spkg
```


the command


```
sage -t src/sage/combinat/designs/incidence_structures.py
```


gives


```
sage -t --random-seed=0 src/sage/combinat/designs/incidence_structures.py

The `coloring` method of Steiner triple systems
calls `MixedIntegerLinearProgram`, which takes
a `solver` argument, defaulting to `None`, in
which case `default_mip_solver` is used.

Testing on two different Sage installations:

```
sage: default_mip_solver()
'Glpk'
sage: len(designs.steiner_triple_system(7).coloring())
3
```


```
sage: default_mip_solver()
'Coin'
sage: len(designs.steiner_triple_system(7).coloring())
2
```


A previous report was at #30637.

Changing keywords from "" to "mip, milp, coin".

This will need testing in the next beta, which has many fixes for the use of MIP (see Meta-ticket #32191)

bug is in line 2048 of src/sage/combinat/designs/incidence_structures.py

```
return self.coloring(k)
```

Recursive call loses value of `solver`:

```
sage: designs.steiner_triple_system(7).coloring(solver="literally whatever")
[[1, 2, 3, 4], [0, 5, 6]]
```

fix would be 

```
return self.coloring(k, solver=solver)
```

That wolud lead to

```
sage: designs.steiner_triple_system(7).coloring(solver="GLPK")
[[0, 1], [3], [2, 4, 5, 6]]
sage: designs.steiner_triple_system(7).coloring(solver="Coin")
[[1, 2, 3, 4], [0, 5, 6]]
sage: designs.steiner_triple_system(7).coloring(solver="PPL")
[[0, 1, 2, 5], [3], [4, 6]]
```

Even better:

```
return self.coloring(k, solver=solver, verbose=verbose)
```

Did this on top of #32218.

I cannot reproduce this behavior - which is clearly a bug

```
sage: designs.steiner_triple_system(7).coloring(solver="Coin")
[[1, 2, 3, 4], [0, 5, 6]]
```

With which version of CBC do you get this result? We observed similar trouble in #30635


---

Comment by @sheerluck created at 2021-07-26 19:23:00

master branch of https://github.com/coin-or/Cbc with `--enable-cbc-parallel` because **coinor-cbc-2.10.5.ebuild** in Gentoo does not have `--enable-cbc-parallel` and that leads to failed `assert(masterThread_);` in `CbcModel::doOneNode`


---

Comment by @sheerluck created at 2021-07-26 19:24:32

I mean `stable/2.10` not master. It is `2.10.5` + 43 commits


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2021-07-26 19:31:38

Yes, I also saw these problems in #30635 with the upgrade to cbc 2.10.5 in #30644.

I think the coin interface (https://github.com/sagemath/sage-numerical-backends-coin) needs to be fixed. See #30635#comment:41 for a possible fix.

I won't have time to work on this before mid August unfortunately.

I noticed some activity at https://github.com/coin-or/Cbc.git then I rebuilded [Cbc, Cgl, Clp, CoinUtils, Osi] from master, saw same behavior for solver="Coin" and decided to ping here (I failed to fix sage-numerical-backends-coin)

bump to 9.6

for current `master` branches of `coinor-utils` `coinor-osi` `coinor-cgl` `coinor-clp` `coinor-cbc` one can build `sage_numerical_backends_coin` only without "CbcSolver" in `coin_backend.pyx`:

```diff

I was hoping to use #31962 this way:

```
from sage.numerical.backends.generic_sdp_backend import get_solver
designs.steiner_triple_system(7).coloring(solver=lambda: get_solver("cvxpy/CBC"))
```

but I got

```
TypeError: Cannot convert CVXPYSDPBackend to sage.numerical.backends.generic_backend.GenericBackend
```



---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2022-03-09 17:34:53

So far #31962 only provides an (unfinished) SDP backend, not an LP/MIP backend. This would have to be written separately. Any help is welcome on #31962!


---

Comment by @sheerluck created at 2022-03-12 21:34:51

when #31962 is merged and closed, "Coin" should not have a chance to be `default_mip_solver`.

Only if "Coin" is replaced with "cvxpy/CBC" then `len(designs.steiner_triple_system(7).coloring())` will be **3** on every Sage installations again.
