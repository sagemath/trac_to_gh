# Issue 31636: use libgiac instead of giac for integration

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31873

Original creator: @mwageringel

Original creation time: 2021-05-28 20:34:55

Now that giacpy_sage has been included into Sage by #29171, we can use it for integration instead of the Pexpect interface.

This will resolve issues like #28913 or this [ask-sage question](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/57312/result-that-comes-with-warning-from-giac-integrator/) where the Pexpect output cannot be parsed by Sage because Giac prints warning messages to the output.

Part of meta-ticket #16688.

I have fixed the doctests. Now this passes ptestlong again. Also, this does not conflict with #32275.
