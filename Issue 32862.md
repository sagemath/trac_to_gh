The problem is clearly [this fetch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/c5af19568ca95680a9f58511b6e1920e1438737a/docker/Dockerfile#L130).

And the code of the github branch that triggered this action should be in `$HOME/sage-context` if I am not mistaken. Either of these repositories is shallow (and I am not 100% sure which one, but I am guessing `$HOME/sage-context`) and the rest of this is written with that in mind.

Before attempting to fetch from `sage-context` we should first test whether it is shallow by setting that repo as our WORKDIR and do 


```
git rev-parse --is-shallow-repository
```


If I am correct this should evaluate to True. If so we should unshallow it. My preferred way would be to make sure that we get an unshallow repo by using by passing the correct arguments to the `actions/checkout`@`v2` command, however I don't know whether that is possible. Otherwise we should unshallow the relevant repository first by fetching all of the history using:


```
git fetch --unshallow
```


This unshallowing will of course only work if the shallow clone has a remote configured that is not shallow, so if unshallowing fails we should probably first set the remote of the `sage-context` to something sensible (I guess preferrably the github mirror since we are on github anyway).

Hope this helps.

p.s. this entire `source-from-context` target in the Dockerfile feels super hacky, and I am wondering whether build times can be kept down to something reasonable with other means.

Julian (saraedum) only pushed sage 9.4 to the `latest` and the `9.4` tags and not the `develop` tag when he manually updated the docker images while our gitlab CI was broken. I think this is not a problem caused by the CI code, but should be fixable by pushing the correct build to docker hub once manually to bootstrap the entire process.

Why is this whole patching business needed in the first place? Installing relevant system packages + compiling all other packages + building sage should be below the github action timelimit, so a fresh build without caching upon every push to develop should work. 

I would also suggest to use the docker action to build and publish the image: https://github.com/marketplace/actions/build-and-push-docker-images

The only thing I know of why, is cause of this discussion #32998#comment:5 , which you are probably also aware of.

Personally I don't care how many system packages we use, and only care about efficient and maintainable docker file. So I am all in favor of using more system packages, especially if that makes it easier to fix this issue. 

Sadly enough I don't have time myself to work on this right now aside from leaving some comments that are hopefully useful.

To my understanding, this is designed for providing very fast incremental builds so that all branches on trac can be tested with it.

Of course for just building the Docker images for release tags, a much simpler workflow would do the job.

Yes, we know that of course from our existing portability CI on GH Actions. `ubuntu-focal-minimal` (https://github.com/sagemath/sage/runs/4497390653?check_suite_focus=true) is around 6 hours and sometimes times out, but with system packages installed, `ubuntu-focal-standard` (https://github.com/sagemath/sage/runs/4497390666?check_suite_focus=true) finishes within 3.5 hours.

While I'm very much in favor of having a github action that runs on all branches, I'm not sure if docker is the right technology for it. Especially in view of the recent progress in the build script it should be easier to reuse partial build outputs from the develop branch also for other branches. For example, one could cache `sage-local` using the built-in github action cache (with hashing the package directory to invalidate the cache once the packages change). I think this is easier to maintain than the ingenious but somewhat hacky git-diff code in the docker build.

As the original author of these Dockerfile hacks…

If we can retain the possibility to create a docker image for every branch that could be quite beneficial at it would allow people to play with code changes in a review on binder instead of having to rebuild locally. However, we never integrated a button for this in trac, even though all the other infrastructure for it exists.

I am not sure if this is enough of a reason to repair these hacks. It's more important to have working docker images again than to have a feature that nobody is using anyway.
