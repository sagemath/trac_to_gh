# Issue 24257: Deprecate set_planar_positions()

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24494

Original creator: jmantysalo

Original creation time: 2018-01-08 20:13:16

Documentation for `set_planar_positions()` says "This method is deprecated since Sage-4.4.1.alpha2." but it has no formal deprecation. Do that.
