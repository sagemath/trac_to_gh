# Issue 19130: Deal with (new?) Maxima error message

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Apparently, we have

```
vertices = [(1,1,-1,-1,-1),(-1,-1,1,1,-1),(1,-1,-1,-1,1),(-1,1,1,1,1),(1,-1,1,-1,-1)]
p = LatticePolytope(vertices)
print p.vertices_pc()
print lattice_polytope.positive_integer_relations(p.vertices_pc().column_matrix())
TypeError: unable to make sense of Maxima expression '"Problemnotfeasible!"' in Sage
```

as reported [here](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/29797/non-negative-integer-relations-on-vertices/).  We should deal with this error message more appropriately.

See also #19365, which is about the actual bug itself (presumably in Maxima).

I move that this should be closed because it was for a specific Maxima call which is no longer used.

I dunno.  I think it might still be useful to keep open; unless this really is the ONLY place in Maxima we could conceivably see this coming up.  I would hate for it to bite us some other place in the future - e.g. by using `maxima_commands()` or whatever it's called.

This method no longer uses Maxima after #20766. So it's time to close this one.

Changing status from needs_info to positive_review.

Determined to be invalid/duplicate/wontfix (closing as "wontfix" as a catch-all resolution).
