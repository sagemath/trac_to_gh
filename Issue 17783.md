Raising a polynomial to a big integer power breaks as follows:

sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: x!<sup>(3!</sup>20)

Error in lines 2-2

This is because in dense representation, one cannot have such high-degree polynomials. This works in sparse representation though:

```
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(ZZ, sparse=True)
sage: x^(3^20)
x^3486784401
```

So this does not have to be fixed.
