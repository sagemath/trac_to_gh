# Issue 17783: Raising polynomial to power

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18020

Original creator: xhumari

Original creation time: 2015-03-20 23:44:33

Assignee: xhumari

Keywords: days64, power, polynomial

Raising a polynomial to a big integer power breaks as follows:

sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: x!<sup>(3!</sup>20)

Error in lines 2-2

This is because in dense representation, one cannot have such high-degree polynomials. This works in sparse representation though:


```
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(ZZ, sparse=True)
sage: x^(3^20)
x^3486784401
```


So this does not have to be fixed.
