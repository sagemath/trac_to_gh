What should be done to review the patches?

From looking at them, they seem good to me, but I am no expert for gdb. And I can confirm that "sage -gdb" now starts without error, in the sense of "I was able to do some non-trivial computation in an interactive session and quit Sage without gdb complaining".

But is that enough to constitute a positive review?

`./sage -t -gdb devel/sage/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_ideal.py` works as well.

Slight complaint: `./sage -gdb -t devel/sage/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_ideal.py` does not work.

Would it be possible to make the options -gdb and -t commute?

The option parsing in general should be overhauled and probably based on the argparse Python module. Right now its a pain to extend the way options work.

Q: How many Sage contributors does it take to change a light bulb? 

A: While looking at the broken light bulb we noticed some paint peeling on the wall, so we should probably re-do the foundation of the house first.

The patches, when chosing to the right repositories, cleanly apply, and sage -gdb does start fine.
