# Issue 25074: Don't check for the exact zn_poly version

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25311

Original creator: @timokau

Original creation time: 2018-05-08 21:47:51

Currently the doctests check for the version of zn_poly. That makes the doctests unnecessarily brittle. If somebody updates zn_poly they have to make a change at an unreleated position and it is an annoyance for packaging.

Why patch this specific test? I mean, I think that most of `misc/package.py` is problematic for packagers.

Thats the only one I had to patch. I [generate the files in the `installed` dir at build time](https://github.com/timokau/nixpkgs/blob/eeee5439e8e43bc9a6c31441440de675e16767e8/pkgs/applications/science/math/sage/sage.nix#L280) by iterating through sages dependencies. I only have to [translate two package names](https://github.com/timokau/nixpkgs/blob/eeee5439e8e43bc9a6c31441440de675e16767e8/pkgs/applications/science/math/sage/sage.nix#L210).

zn_poly has version `0.9` in nixpkgs, without the patch part. I could translate that just as the names, but that would need to be fixed with every change to the sage version.

And even when not considering packaging I think its best not to test for the exact version. That will always break the doctests with every zn_poly version, even if there was no api break.

Interesting. I don't know what other distros do.

I think we specifically chose `zn_poly` in this doctest because it is dead upstream (last release in 2008) and the last Sage-specific patch was in 2013. So the scenario that you describe is mostly hypothetical.

At least the arch linux package just fails the `package.py` tests.

Ah, I see. I would still prefer not to rely on this. Does that test provide any value? That installed packages are detected correctly is tested in `list_packages` and that the version is split from the name correctly is tested in `pkgname_split`.

OK, fine. Could you just replace `# not tested` by `# random`?

Sorry, no idea how that happened. I can't remember touching those files.
