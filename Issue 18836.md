I reviewed this ticket without reviewing its dependency #18182. I have added a few reviewer commits.

Here are some further comments.

1. `growth_group.combine_exceptions`: missing INPUT and OUTPUT blocks
2. Why is the default category now a monoid instead of a group?
3. `GenericGrowthGroup._pushout_`:
   - explain why there is no common canonical parent for objects with parents: `Growth Group QQ^x` and `Growth Group x^QQ` (commutativity of pushouts vs. non-commutativity of cartesian products of growth groups with the same generator?)
   - What is the role of the lines

```
        if isinstance(other, GenericGrowthGroup):
            pass
```

4. `growth_group_cartesian.merge_overlapping`: 
   - add more information to docstring: missing INPUT: and OUTPUT: blocks
   - `find_mergedoverlapping_index`: `key` is evaluated frequently
5. `_convert_factors_`: remove `list` in penultimate line of code.
6. `TermWithCoefficientMonoid._element_constructor_`: what is the point of catching and immediately re-raising an exception in 

```
try:
	return self.element_class(self, data, coefficient)
except:
	raise
```

7. `AsymptoticRing.__init__`: why is an `Asymptoticring` now a poset?

Cross-review...ok.

> 1. `growth_group.combine_exceptions`: missing INPUT and OUTPUT blocks

Added.

A monoid is all what is needed to make the asymptotic ring a ring. Of course usually this will be a group to allow inversions in the ring, but as a minimal requirement, we have Monoids()

Documented.

`elif` forgotten in the line following this. Rewritten completely.

> 4. `growth_group_cartesian.merge_overlapping`: 
>   - add more information to docstring: missing INPUT: and OUTPUT: blocks

Added and extended.

Now cached.

Done.

No point; changed. (I think this changed at some point and was forgotten)

> 7. `AsymptoticRing.__init__`: why is an `Asymptoticring` now a poset?

Removed (this was planned to be done on #19083).

Ok, this explains why a `GenericGrowthGroup` is only a monoid.

The derived classes `MonomialGrowthGroup` and `ExponentialGrowthGroup`, however, will be groups in many cases.
Perhaps this can be resolved in or after #19083.

I reworded that and added further doctests.

However, the helper functions only need the keys, I added a commit to do so.

Please cross-review my changes and add item 2. to the TODO list of #19083 or, alternatively, open a ticket for that.
After that, consider this to be a conditional `positive_review` from my side, conditional on #18182.

Ok. Added it as a work issue on #19083.

Corrected PEP8.

Thanks.

> Please cross-review my changes and add item 2. to the TODO list of #19083 or, alternatively, open a ticket for that.

Everything done.
