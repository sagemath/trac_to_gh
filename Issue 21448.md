On OS X 10.12, and also with some earlier versions of OS X, we have had problems with the Sage build because Python claimed to build correctly even though the module `_scproxy` did not actually build. So let's test to make sure.

Is there a way to test before installing python? Once python is installed you are screwed, so it should happen before, or possibly start the clean up.
