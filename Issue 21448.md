# Issue 21448: When building Python on OS X, test whether _scproxy can be imported successfully.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21685

Original creator: jhpalmieri

On OS X 10.12, and also with some earlier versions of OS X, we have had problems with the Sage build because Python claimed to build correctly even though the module `_scproxy` did not actually build. So let's test to make sure.

Is there a way to test before installing python? Once python is installed you are screwed, so it should happen before, or possibly start the clean up.

I don't know enough about the Python build process to know how to test before it is installed. We can uninstall if it fails, though.

I'll look to see if there is an easy way to figure out before installing.

From the "src" folder

```
find build -name _scproxy.so
build/lib.macosx-10.9-x86_64-2.7/_scproxy.so
```

So we should abort if `find` returns nothing before installing I'd say.

Great, that's better than what I was doing. I'm wary of deleting things, so I've removed that part of my changes. I think we can still test for `_scproxy` at the end, just in case.

I just tested this on OS X 10.12 with and without my branch from #21567 (so with Python succeeding and failing to build `_scproxy`) and it seems to detect this correctly.
