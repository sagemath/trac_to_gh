Packages for sip, PyQt4 and QScintilla2. sip is a required library for the other ones. PyQt4 allows to call Qt libraries from Python and Sage code, using the system-wide Qt installation. QScintilla2 is a plug-in for text input with syntax highlighting.
Current files are in experimental packages and in http://sourceforge.net/projects/lorienlabs/files/ .

There are sip and PyQT packages at #13022 so I'm changing the scope of this ticket.

Setting spkg proposals that have not seen recent activity to "sage-wishlist".
