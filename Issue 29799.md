# Issue 29799: pip-installable sage

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30036

We add the following mechanism to sagelib's `setup.py`:

  Try importing the module `sage_bootstrap`.
  If it succeeds, call an entry point in `sage_bootstrap` (#29039) to install the non-Python prerequisites of sagelib. 

Source distributions `sage_bootstrap` and `sagelib` can be uploaded to PyPI.
