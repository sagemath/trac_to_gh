# Issue 30944: Mutability class does not return is_immutable

At the current stage, the mixin class `sage.structure.mutability.Mutability` does not return anything for `is_immutable`:



```python
    def is_immutable(self):
        """
        ...
        """
        self._is_immutable
```

Looks like a simple oversight, but the doctest is not actually testing this function. Well, this will work though.

Thanks for the quick review. Some doctests will be added with #30261 anyway. But first, we have to handle the pickling problem in #31182.
