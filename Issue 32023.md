There is no added value that the functions `find_root`, `find_local_maximum`, `find_local_minimum`, `minimize`, `minimize_constrained`, `find_fit` would provide over just using `scipy`. 

We should replace it by documentation that empowers users to use Sage functions with `scipy` (including the `sage.ext.fast_callable` facility).

I'm not so sure about this one. These functions are minimal(ish) wrappers around scipy that,

* allow you to use sage types as input/output
* check the results for correctness
* drop "verbose" return values

The essence of sage is wrapping other scientific libraries in a consistent and user-friendly interface. What  `find_root` does (for example) is not rocket surgery,  but I certainly wouldn't want to write it myself every time I have a calc1 problem to double-check.

In other news, Gregory Bard's book (http://gregorybard.com/Sage.html) also uses a few of these functions.

Thanks for the input and the pointer.

I think we need to break this down function by function.

+1

Ideally these could be pretty light wrappers in general.  But having something top-level for undergraduate instruction is very, very convenient (as evidenced by the two books mentioned in the ticket).

Well, I have looked at the sections related to the present ticket in the books and I wouldn't recommend using these parts for instruction at any level.

I fully agree. For instance, I would be -1 in removing `find_root` for it is heavily used and very convenient for a basic usage.  For more sophisticated use, of course, the user shall import `scipy` functions.

Yes, `find_root` is not so bad.
