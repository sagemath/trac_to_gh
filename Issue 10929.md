Cohen provided a C-version of Dokchitser's script. This wraps that script and cleans up the script. There were several issues present and doctests for the elliptic curves have been adapted to correctly set the maximal imaginary value.

The patch and spkg installed OK (on 63-bit ubuntu)  and I am now testing.

* The spkg needs a version number, so use the date (e.g. dokchitser-20110325.spkg)
* There needs to be an SPKG.txt file
* The spkg needs to be under mercurial version control (but *not* the src/ subdirectory).
* The spkg-install looks good!

These are trivialities, but necessary!
