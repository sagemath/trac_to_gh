In #19302, the naive hash function of `Element` warns with a stopgap. To avoid annoying messages we implement some hashes function for some elements.

The remaining cases, will be treated in #19016.

To me, it seems good to go. I was a bit worried about the hash of polyhedra but the elements of your tuple are all integers, and the functions that return them are, well, 'not too scary' even though there is a bit of useless wrapping going on.
