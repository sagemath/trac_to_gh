# Issue 19084: provide better hash functions

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19321

Original creator: vdelecroix

Original creation time: 2015-09-30 21:19:29

CC:  ncohen nbruin

Keywords: hash

In #19302, the naive hash function of `Element` warns with a stopgap. To avoid annoying messages we implement some hashes function for some elements.

The remaining cases, will be treated in #19016.

Yo !

To me, it seems good to go. I was a bit worried about the hash of polyhedra but the elements of your tuple are all integers, and the functions that return them are, well, 'not too scary' even though there is a bit of useless wrapping going on.
