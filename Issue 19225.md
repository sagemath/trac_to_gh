Currently in Sage you can only build linear codes over finite fields. The only tentative to generalize it (though only to the rings `ZZ/nZZ`) is #6452. Note that this ticket not add directly a new linear code function but rather focuses on having a nice class for submodules of `(ZZ/nZZ)^r` which is exactly what linear codes are about.

And [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_code) says that linear code are over finite fields.

Because checking duplicates in a list of size `|size of the field| x nrows` is longer than in a list of size `nrows`.

I have no idea whether linear code over rings will be one day supported... ticket #6452 is just a first step. And I was just mentioning it to make some advertisement. But nobody cares.

This is a good justification for a field-specific version of this 5-lines algorithm. Not a justification for not supporting rings at all.

I have no idea either, but unless it is written somewhere that we can assume fields only, you won't see me adding a code that assumes more than it should.

Try to advertise it to people who you think should care. I review patches in less than three years, but on the other hand my field is graph theory. I forgot all I ever knew about rings.

About this ticket: it seems that some part of the code 'assumes' that the ring is a field indeed:


```
sage: LinearCode(matrix.ones(IntegerModRing(6),5))
...
NotImplementedError: Echelon form not implemented over 'Ring of integers modulo 6'.
```


Though that is apparently because the 'rank' function is only implemented on fields. This notion exists on rings too, doesn't it? Though I expect that the definition would be pretty nasty `:-/`

'on the paper', however:


```
sage: LinearCode(matrix.ones(IntegerModRing(3),5))
Linear code of length 5, dimension 1 over Ring of integers modulo 3
```


That's cheating, however, for


```
sage: IntegerModRing(3).is_field()
True
```

`LinearCode` is beyond broken for rings. That the object cannot even be constructed is only the tip of the iceberg. The `ZZ/pZZ`-modules that Vincent implemented can form a base of a type of code over ring later on, but that will not inherit from `LinearCode` or `AbstractLinearCode` since there field assumption is everywhere. I don't know how much code sharing will be possible, but I doubt too much non-trivial code.

Also, I don't think it's high on anyone's list of priorities...

I've also been discussing with David to change `LinearCode` so it doesn't
mention rings anymore. It's stupid since they're clearly not supported.

So I agree with Vincent that it's nicer to have code run in linear time rather than quadratic.

Moreover, I don't even think your code is correct over rings. Consider the
following generator matrix over ZZ mod 6:

    [ 1  2  0 ]
    [ 1  2  1 ]

This is clearly not projective since 2*c1 = c2.
But your code would compare

    set([ c1 * (ZZ mod 6) ]) = { (0,0), (1, 1), (2,2), ..., (5,5) }
    set([ c2 * (ZZ mod 6) ]) = { (0,0), (2,2), (4,4) }

Thus the check at the end would succeed, and you return `True`.

In the definition given in reference by Nathann, the condition is that `R c1 != R c2`... but of course, the definition is non-ambiguous over a field.

Ah, I see. Ok, so the code seems correct then :-)

But that's not what's usually understood by "linearly independent", I believe. If you, Nathann, insist on retaining the ring stuff, I suggest the definition be written out in full in the docstring (noone is going to look up a definition he believes he knows from high school).

Best,

yeah, I agree - even if one's high school linear algebra virginity has been lost to irresistible charms of commutative algebra, it's still quite unusual definition.

And actually in the reference Nathann gave, they consider codes over non-commutative finite rings! Which is indeed infinitely more general.

Nathann, for this version of the code, since you switched to a field implementation, could you adapt the documentation?
