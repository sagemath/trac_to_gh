Okay.... Well, despite what I told you by email earlier, it can also help to visualize my cherished hypergraphs.


```
sage: view(Hypergraph([[1,2,3],[2,3,4],[1,4,5]]))
```


I did the same modification to the Hypergraph class. If you agree with it, you can set this ticket to `positive_review`.

Thanks !

I confirmed that this keeps the dot2tex graph working and also has them work OOTB in the notebook (last time I tried this, which was a long time ago (6 months), it didn't work).

I fixed the same doctest for the other latex tutorials in French and English. So someone double-check and then set a pos_rev.
