Keywords: libgap, startup time

currently libGAP loads slower than GAP with pexpect interface. 

```

About extra 7 sec on a Core2 `x86_64` machine, at least according to the CPU time report, which might be lying(?).

I should retract this, my timings were off. Now I bet that it really is the main problem of slowness on startup.

The workspace to load should be created by `libGAP`, and not by "normal" `GAP`. Then it all works.

Should we mimic the way "normal" GAP deals with the workspaces? Or are there other/better ideas?

It does right now because you get the "Forcing sage-location, probably because a new package was installed." which touches `libgap.la`. Which, in turn, invalidates the saved workspace. Though that is not a good mechanism, and we probably want to get rid of the sage-location thing. There should be a generic hook to delete cached stuff after installing of packages, but afaik there is none. The GAP interface has the same problem, I think.
