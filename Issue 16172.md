Keywords: python3

While running the Python 2to3 on the Sage code base some warning are emitted:
* fixer= absolute_import

```
### In file sage/misc/sage_timeit.py ###
Line 199: absolute and local imports together
```


* fixer= map

```
### In file sage/geometry/polyhedron/constructor.py ###
Line 364: You should use a for loop here

```


* fixer= next

```
### In file sage/combinat/integer_list.py ###
Line 322: Calls to builtin next() possibly shadowed by global binding
```


* fixer= operator

```
### In file sage/combinat/sf/sfa.py ###
Line 3520: You should use 'operator.mul(lcm(pair), times=gcd(pair))' here.

* I fixed "absolute_import" and "map" cases. It tests OK.
* I will check the "operator" case later. 

The redefinition of `next()` in `sage/combinat/integer_list.py` has the text `INTERNAL FUNCTION! DO NOT USE DIRECTLY!`.
At the top of the module it says

```
IMPORTANT NOTE (2009/02):
The internal functions in this file will be deprecated soon.
Please only use them through :class:`IntegerListsLex`.
```

Travis, what would you suggest? - The deprecation has not yet happened, but I do not find it obvious how to fix ...

Short-term solution would be to rename `next` to `next_object` or something like this (it's also at least used in `combinat/integer_vector.py`). The true deprecation solution is going to be much harder (I can try to do this if you want, but it would take a lot longer to do).

But isn't {{{next()}} an element if the public API? So renaming would be no option.

I'm currently thinking it would be best to ignore this warning now.

It's not in the public (Sage) namespace, so we can rename it without having to deprecate it. However if you think it's fine to just ignore it, then that's fine (and I'll do the refactoring later this year).
