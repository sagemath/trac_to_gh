Please put this ticket in "needs_review". I have assumed that you forgot to do so.
Here are some points that I have seen at first reading.

```
+    See [Hutz-gr]
```
is wrong. The correct refererence syntax is `[Hutz-gr]_` with an underscore at the end. This happen at many places, for example also for `See [FMV]` and `[Silverman_ADS]` and `[Bruin-Molnar] and [Molnar]`.

```
`PGL(2,QQ)`
```
could be

```
`PGL(2,\QQ)`
```

This looks strange:

```
-        lift,lifted = blift(LG,Li,p,S=S)
+        lift,lifted = blift(LG,Li,p,S = S)
```

`Abelian variety` should keep its capital A

```
+        returns ``True`` if this map is a morphism.
```
should be

```
+        Return ``True`` if this map is a morphism.
```

`greens function` should be `Green's function`

`+        THis map must`
should be
`+        This map must`

typo `the subsgroup` at least twice

typo `post-critially`

typo `the the LLL`

duplicate reference `[Hutz_gr]` and `[Hutz-gr]` ?

typo `this projective spaces`

That is good to know about the reference. I hadn't figured out yet why they were only linking for some of them, so you saved some time trying to determine what was happening.
