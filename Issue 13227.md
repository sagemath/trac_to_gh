Speaking of fixes/improvements for symmetric functions: the current code is not perfectly consistent for the naming of the bases:

```
sage: S = SymmetricFunctions(QQ['q,t'].fraction_field())
sage: S.s()
Symmetric Function Algebra over Fraction Field of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in q, t over Rational Field, Schur symmetric functions as basis
sage: S.macdonald().P()
Symmetric Functions over Fraction Field of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in q, t over Rational Field in the realization MacdonaldPolynomials_p
```


And indeed in the code, S.s()._repr_ comes from SymmetricFunctionAlgebra_classical, where as
S.macdonald().P()._repr_ comes from generic with_realization code.

What about moving (in this ticket, or later), the _repr_ from
SymmetricFunctionAlgebra_classical to SymmetricFunctionsBases?

A bit of fiddling with ._basis might be needed to get the string 'Macdonald P symmetric functions' right, but this should not be too bad.

Cheers,
                       Nicolas

PS: as a side effect, this would help me a bit with my functorial
construction patch, as it currently breaks the naming of the
macdo/llt/hl basis, and would not anymore with the changes above.

Hi Mike,

I made all changes we discussed by e-mail. Could you have a look?

All tests pass and the documentation looks good.  Nicolas, we can address the !__repr!__Â changes in another patch. -Mike

Thank you, Mike! Same comments as on 12140.

After discussion, another addition to make will be ` coproduct `  method on k-Schur bases.

I implemented coproduct on k-Schur functions.  This required moving ` coproduct_by_coercion ` to the class ` SymmetricFunctionAlgebra_generic `.  Please test and review.

Hi Mike,

Thanks for the addition! I made some more changes to the doc explanations (there was still a reference to monomial symmetric functions even though coproduct_by_coercion was moved to sfa.py). I also added some further tests for k-Schurs and LLTs. Both patches are now folded, so please only

Apply: trac_13399-sf-as.patch

All tests pass on sage_5.3.rc0 + two additional 5457 patches. No idea what the current version of sage is that we are supposed to test against!

Best,

Anne

Rebased with respect to #13404. More additions regarding Jack polynomials are pending!

Hi Mike,

I folded the previous 13399 patch with the changes to jack.py. For me all tests pass and the documentation looks good. Please set a positive review if you are satisfied!

I changed two minor things in the doc strings indicating that coercion was done through the homogeneous basis.  All doc tests pass on sage-5.3.rc1 + dependency patches.  It looks good and I give it a positive review.
