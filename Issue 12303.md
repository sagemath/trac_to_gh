Solve the following problem:


```
sage: s = WordMorphism('1->121,2->131,3->4,4->1')
sage: s == s.reversal()
True
sage: s != s.reversal()
True
```


which is due to:

```
sage: s.__ne__?
Object `s.__ne__` not found.
```


Not much more than this should be added:

```
def __ne__(self, other):
    return not self.__eq__(other)
```
