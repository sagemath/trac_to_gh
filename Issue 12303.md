# Issue 12303: Define WordMorphism.__ne__

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/12475

Original creator: tjolivet

Original creation time: 2012-02-08 16:42:45

Assignee: sage-combinat

Solve the following problem:


```
sage: s = WordMorphism('1->121,2->131,3->4,4->1')
sage: s == s.reversal()
True
sage: s != s.reversal()
True
```


which is due to:

```
sage: s.__ne__?
Object `s.__ne__` not found.
```


Not much more than this should be added:

```
def __ne__(self, other):
    return not self.__eq__(other)
```

The patch applies correctly on my system and fixes the reported problem: positive review.

I couldn't figure out where the PatchBot fails (yellow icon as of now).
