When you call a quaternion algebra in Sage defined over a number field, you get grammar salad for the description.

I'm guessing the info fields for quaternion algebras are misdefined, or something similar to that. Hopefully this shouldn't be too much work to fix.

Figured it out.

```
Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^2 - 17
```

Read as: "The number field with adjoined element 'a', having defining polynomial x^2-17".

This makes perfect sense, so nothing is in fact broken. Issue withdrawn.
