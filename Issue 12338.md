Helloooooooo !!

Well, as far as I understand this code I think that it is good to go, except for this thing I just told you about : the new content of `QuotientRingElement.__nonzero__` creates this problem

```
sage: a = e.lift()
sage: any([e])
True
sage: b = e.lift()
# Now b and a are not necessarily equal anymore
```


If you think that this is not a problem after all, then you can set this ticket to `positive_review`.

Have fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuunnn !!

The returned result was wrong so I switched back to raising not implemented. I created #13999 to have the problem fixed. Please review,

Florent
