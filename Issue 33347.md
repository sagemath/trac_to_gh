Keywords: Mathics inteface SymPy

Since this upgrade of SymPy (especially by [this commit](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/commit/72420537f320d333b5302040adfe94f0c335af93)) the Mathics interface is broken:


```
sage: slist = [[1, 2], 3., 4 + I]
sage: mlist = mathics(slist)
sage: mlist.sage()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NotImplementedError: conversion to SageMath is not implemented
```


Here we implement a fix of that.

I agree that this fixes the issue, as well. Probably you know better about Mathics than I do, but it seems to be more restrictive, since it converts each instance of SympyExpression to a list.

Anyway, you are welcome to contribute to the code. But I would prefer to do that on a separate ticket, to have the issue fixed, as soon as possible.

I agree that my patch is a dirty hack :)

I agree that proper work with SympyExpression should be on on a separate ticket.

I agree that this ticket should be merged ASAP.
