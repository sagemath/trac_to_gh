CC:  tscrim vivianepons

Keywords: asm

If you do the following:

A=AlternatingSignMatrices(3)

A.lattice().plot()

you get an error, but 

A.lattice() says it is a finite lattice with 7 elements, as it ought to be. 

The error says we need to implement the sort algorithm for AlternatingSignMatrices.
