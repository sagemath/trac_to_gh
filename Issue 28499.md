problem visible here:

```
sage: v = [(sin(i),cos(i),i) for i in [-4,-3.5,..4]]
sage: S = sum(sphere(v[i], size=1/2, color=((i-4)/8, 1/2,(4-i)/8)) for i in range(len(v)))
sage: S.show(aspect_ratio=[1,1,1], viewer='threejs')
```

where most sphere are white because of bad Textures.

A question: is this the same bug that is seen in https://sage.sis.uta.fi/home/pub/198/ ? Accidentally I was just asked about that.
