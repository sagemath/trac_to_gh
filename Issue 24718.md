I don't think any of these fixes are in any other ticket yet but I need to double-check.

This fixes issues related to the fact that on Python 2 looking up a method on a class returns an "unbound method" object, whereas on Python 3 it just returns the bare function object.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24955
