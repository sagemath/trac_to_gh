The documentation of `graphs.LjubljanaGraph` claims that the default embedding is obtained from the Heawood graph, while the Heawood embedding is actually the second (and non-default) embedding.

This trivial patch just fixes the typo.

Hi Nathann -- I am trying to get my first review done and thought this is the right patch to do so.

So, I did `git checkout u/ncohen/15228`, then saw that you have interchanged the `if` and the `elif`, I fixed that, committed the changes, and then tried to push. But then, I got 

```
stumpc5@stumpc5:~/progs/sage$ git push

Do you have a simple explanation, or should I post that on `sage-devel`?

Cheers, Christian

There are permissions on branches. You can't write on mine, I can't write on yours. If you need to add a commit you need to create your own branch and push it there. Then I don't know what the procedure is exactly : you either change the branch field of this ticket to point to your new branch, or you tell me what your branch is and I add the commit to mine if I agree with it.
