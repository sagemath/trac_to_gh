In `sage.categories.pushout.SubspaceFunctor` we have the example

```
sage: M = ZZ^3
sage: S = M.submodule([(1,2,3),(4,5,6)]); S
Free module of degree 3 and rank 2 over Integer Ring
Echelon basis matrix:
[1 2 3]
[0 3 6]
sage: S.construction()
(SubspaceFunctor,
 Ambient free module of rank 3 over the principal ideal domain Integer Ring)
```

The subspace functor uses `coercion_reversed=True`. The pushout
sage: sage.categories.pushout.pushout(S, M)
Ambient free module of rank 3 over the principal ideal domain Integer Ring
}}}
is wrong; it should be `ZZ^3`. Consequently

```
sage: cm = sage.structure.element.get_coercion_model()
sage: cm.common_parent(S, M)
Ambient free module of rank 3 over the principal ideal domain Integer Ring
```

also gives the wrong result.
