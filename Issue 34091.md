Currently, `sage.parallel.ncpus.ncpus()` uses platform-specific code to determine the number of available CPUs for some specific systems. This functionality is now available in the standard `os` module as `cpu_count()`.

From https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.cpu_count it sounds like using `os.sched_getaffinity` would be a better choice when available. (It's not available on macOS.)

Done.

However, here's an issue: In reality, the `ncpus()` function actually always returns `1` when `SAGE_NUM_THREADS` is not set. This is because `sage-num-threads.py`, which is called by `sage-env`, defaults to returning `1` if `SAGE_NUM_THREADS` isn't already in the environment.

Is this intentional? If yes: Should multi-threading really be disabled by default in 2022?

and the other discussions were linked to from one of them.

The documentation could clarify what choices were made and why.
