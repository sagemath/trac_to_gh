The following is wrong:

```
sage: f = E.isogenies_prime_degree(37)[0].kernel_polynomial(); print f
x^18 + 4540*x^17 + 9432590*x^16 + 11849891575*x^15 + 9976762132800*x^14 + 5848587595725875*x^13 + 2353459307197093375*x^12 + 568092837455595073750*x^11 + 10497166901552517018750*x^10 - 58167719763827256503515625*x^9 - 29123957981672764259404562500*x^8 - 8642534874478733951747590312500*x^7 - 1813067882488802075989763827437500*x^6 - 280530629803275669434587526141796875*x^5 - 32092317459295198700901755629420390625*x^4 - 2653647761299569976280286239100456640625*x^3 - 150512357183694499353889242415640015234375*x^2 - 5251411022717638474379194466153432357421875*x - 109726025569211942107122161315881979114638903101906545147648940972972973/1289303099811316943271493632
sage: E.division_polynomial(37) % E.isogenies_prime_degree(37)[0].kernel_polynomial() == 0
False
```

In fact only the constant coefficient is wrong:

```
sage: E.division_polynomial(37).factor()[0][0]
x^18 + 4540*x^17 + 9432590*x^16 + 11849891575*x^15 + 9976762132800*x^14 + 5848587595725875*x^13 + 2353459307197093375*x^12 + 568092837455595073750*x^11 + 10497166901552517018750*x^10 - 58167719763827256503515625*x^9 - 29123957981672764259404562500*x^8 - 8642534874478733951747590312500*x^7 - 1813067882488802075989763827437500*x^6 - 280530629803275669434587526141796875*x^5 - 32092317459295198700901755629420390625*x^4 - 2653647761299569976280286239100456640625*x^3 - 150512357183694499353889242415640015234375*x^2 - 5251411022717638474379194466153432357421875*x - 3148881707222283483037230006935969560314453125/37
```

Thanks for finding this, I will look into it.  That code has been there for 3-4 years!

The difference between the two polynomials is by a very simple fractionâ€¯:


```
sage: QQ(E.division_polynomial(37).factor()[0][0] - E.isogenies_prime_degree(37)
....: [0].kernel_polynomial()).factor()
2^-33 * 3^-36 * 37^-1
```


maybe just a minor bug in some Weierstrass change of coordinates?

No -- and such a bug would be more serious, probably.

Around line 530 of isogenies_small_degree() a precision is set and it must be not large enough.  Note that this function only ever works with one curve for each of a small set of j-invariants, so one can check in a precomputation which precision suffices.  I thought I had done that.  I will fix it (possibly not until tomorrow).

OK, it's not a precision problem but rather the real polynomial computed has integral coefficients except for the constatnt term which has denominator 37, so rounding is a bad thing to do.  I have checked all the cases covered by this function in case there were other non-integral ones, and there are not.  For all the other ell and also the other j for ell =37 (namely j=-9317) the code is correct, so all that is rquired is to use  (ell*c).cound()/ell and get rational coefficients in this case.

It's currently a mystery to me how the doctest in lines 601-5 works since it gets the isogenous curve correct despite using this incorrect kernel polynomial.  A patch is on its way.

You are welcome -- it was my fault in the first place!
