# Issue 31011: Make tableaux error messages more precise

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31248

Original creator: @bollu

Original creation time: 2021-01-15 22:44:05

The current error messages of the standard and semistandard tableaux assert that rows are weakly increasing and columns are strictly increasing. On failing this property, a generic error of the form


"The rows of <<specific tableaux>> are not weakly increasing"

is printed. I propose to make the information more precise, to print errors of the form:


"row (1) is not weakly increasing between columns (2, 3)"

Thank you for contributing.

Can you please fill in "Author" and "Component" field.

Why did you remove the first line "coding: utf-8"?

There is a typo yet:


```diff
-            # we know that len(rnext) < len(rcur) as the SST cannot have
+            # we know that len(rnext) <= len(rcur) as the SST cannot have
             # more columns in the next row than the current row.
             assert (len(rnext) <= len(rcur))
```

Fixed typo.
What's the etiquette here: Ought I comment when I push a fix, or does the commit message suffice?

I don't know. I think forced pushes and changed branches are confirmed by email. There might be a message after a few hours after a normal new push as well.

I usually do it like you. When I want people to know that I treated their comments and nothing happens by itself (e.g. I don't get a status update by mail) I just comment that I fixed the issues.

Changing status from needs_review to positive_review.

LGTM. Thank you for the improvement.

Great, thanks! Is there something I need to do to get it to be merged?

No, the release manager (Volker Braun) takes care of it.
A number of people can close tickets for invalidity/duplicate etc,
but the actual merging is done by one person only (and a number of bots/scripts that help).

A positively reviewed ticket with green bots and all fields filled in will usually be merged in a week or two or rejected (merge conflict, issues with specific architectures, failing bots). But it might take longer (too many positively review tickets waiting, end of release cycle).
