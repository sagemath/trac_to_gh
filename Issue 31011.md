The current error messages of the standard and semistandard tableaux assert that rows are weakly increasing and columns are strictly increasing. On failing this property, a generic error of the form


"The rows of <<specific tableaux>> are not weakly increasing"

is printed. I propose to make the information more precise, to print errors of the form:


"row (1) is not weakly increasing between columns (2, 3)"

I don't know. I think forced pushes and changed branches are confirmed by email. There might be a message after a few hours after a normal new push as well.

I usually do it like you. When I want people to know that I treated their comments and nothing happens by itself (e.g. I don't get a status update by mail) I just comment that I fixed the issues.

No, the release manager (Volker Braun) takes care of it.
A number of people can close tickets for invalidity/duplicate etc,
but the actual merging is done by one person only (and a number of bots/scripts that help).

A positively reviewed ticket with green bots and all fields filled in will usually be merged in a week or two or rejected (merge conflict, issues with specific architectures, failing bots). But it might take longer (too many positively review tickets waiting, end of release cycle).
