Assignee: jason, was

Keywords: SIGSEGV, segmentation fault

The following is with sage 4.6.1 on OS X run under gdb to show more info:


```
sage: v=vector(GF(2),0,[],sparse=False)
Reading symbols for shared libraries . done
sage: m=matrix(GF(2),0,0,[],sparse=False)
sage: m*v
Reading symbols for shared libraries . done

Program received signal EXC_BAD_ACCESS, Could not access memory.
Reason: KERN_INVALID_ADDRESS at address: 0x0000000000000018
0x0000000106fc6239 in _mzd_mul_naive ()

Hej Johan,

Bedankt voor t fixen :).

I just looked at it and the patch aplies fine without failing doctest. Also found no problems when trying to get segfaults with similar examples. So I give it a positive review.
