Keywords: Documentation, DiCyclic Group

The documentation describing Sage's implementation of the DiCylic Group contains the sentence:

```
The presentation above means every element can be written as
a^{i} x^{j} with 0<= j<2n, j=0,1. 
}}}}
Here, the second to last occurrence of the letter j should instead be an i.
