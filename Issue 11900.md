I finally ended up folding the patch intended for this one into #12068. So this is a duplicate. Close as soon as #12068 is closed.

This doesn't need review, then; it's "positive review" to indicate the release manager takes the next step on this ticket.  Right?

Actually, I was waiting to have the positive review on #12068 before positive reviewed this one.
