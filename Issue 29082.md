# Issue 29082: pari spkg-configure.m4 should check for gphelp

The `gphelp` executable is needed by `cypari2` at installation time.

It is provided by the separate package `pari-doc` on Debian.

This causes build errors on `ubuntu-eoan-standard` (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/502310821?check_suite_focus=true)
