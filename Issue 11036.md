Assignee: jason, was

CC:  @jasongrout @novoselt

Having no arrows in an arrow plot (i.e., vector field that is a slope field) now causes warnings from matplotlib.

```
y = var('y') 
g = 1 
P=plot_slope_field(g,(x,3,4),(y,-1,1)) 
P 
<two sets of warnings> 
```

DSM has a diagnosis at [this sage-support thread](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/49471ab062fcb8e9)

```
P=plot_slope_field(g,(x,3,4),(y,-1,1),headlength=1e-8) 
works for me.  FYI, it's the following few lines in Quiver._h_arrows at fault: 
        minsh = self.minshaft * self.headlength 
        [....] 
        shrink = length/minsh 
        X0 = shrink * X0[np.newaxis,:] 
        Y0 = shrink * Y0[np.newaxis,:] 
Probably we should change the defaults and/or (if it's not done 
already) ask our matplotlib friends to special-case 0 for no 
arrowheads.
```

So maybe this should be reported upstream?  See also #2922, which is also about the mpl quivers.

Probably, and I say so on sage-support, but I don't know how to make this pure matplotlib, and maybe they would say it's user error?  But you are almost certainly right.

For the moment it seems OK to use Doug McNeil's hack of setting: headlength=1e-8
Its better than leaving this problem around any longer in my opinion.

On the plus side, it works!  DSM, just be sure to *not* replace the previous patch so that we can compare the two, but the rebase should be nearly trivial (I almost did it just now, but decided you were probably in the midst).  The only thing I could possibly say is that I would put the "(trac #11208)::" on the next line, but it's not really that important.

So positive review, modulo rebase.
