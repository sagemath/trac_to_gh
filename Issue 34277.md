Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/34514

Original creator: roed

Original creation time: 2022-09-09 16:29:44


```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^4 + 18*x^2 - 1)
sage: R.<y> = K[]
sage: L.<b> = K.extension(y^2 + 9*a^3 - 2*a^2 + 162*a - 38)
sage: [L.decomposition_type(i) for i in K.primes_above(3)]
[[(1, 1, 2)], [(1, 1, 2)], [(1, 1, 1)]]
```

The last triple should be `(1, 2, 1)`.
