autotools have a concept of "precious variables"
(https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/manual/autoconf-2.69/html_node/Setting-Output-Variables.html).

Because we do not use automake, many standard precious variables such as `CFLAGS`, `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` are not actually applied to building.

This should be fixed to make our build system more standard.

(from discussions in #29504, and a discussion with gh-mwageringel on a ticket I lost track of)
