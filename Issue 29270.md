autotools have a concept of "precious variables"
(https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/manual/autoconf-2.69/html_node/Setting-Output-Variables.html).

Because we do not use automake, many standard precious variables such as `CFLAGS`, `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` are not actually applied to building.

This should be fixed to make our build system more standard.

(from discussions in #29504, and a discussion with gh-mwageringel on a ticket I lost track of)

Easiest way to fix it is probably to use automake. Our targets in build/make/Makefile would just become "local" targets (https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/Extending.html#Extending)

using automake will also make installing of gettext-related stuff in bootstrap easy

Changing keywords from "" to "sd111".

`CFLAGS` and similar were taken care of in #30375.

Setting new milestone based on a cursory review of ticket status, priority, and last modification date.
