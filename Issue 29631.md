Some questions: 

- Who generates files such as `src/doc/en/reference/monoids/sage/monoids/free_monoid.rst`, and should they be part of what `sagemath-doc-src` installs (and thus ships with the wheel)?

- Is there a way to only generate the doctrees but not build HTML or PDF?

- Do the HTML and PDF builds need to be able to run the Sage library, or can they build these formats if given only the doctrees?

I do believe there is a sphinx option for doing just that.

As far as I know they need to be able to run the sage library. In particular all graphs/plots are generated during the documentation build.

I cannot find such an option anymore. If it existed. There is an option to say where the doctrees should be stored and found, but nothing on producing it in isolation.
