`is_empty` should essentially be an alias for `__nonzero__`, so just punt to it to avoid code duplication.

Minor nitpicks: "OUTPUT:" should be on a separate line, see http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/conventions.html#docstring-markup-with-rest-and-sphinx

Also, docstring should be imperative: "Return foobar" instead of "Returns foobar".
