Jason Grout, Rob Beezer, Robert Bradshaw, and William Stein have mostly written a rather extensive thematic tutorial on linear algebra for Sage (for inclusion in the HLA = Handbook of Linear Algebra, 2nd edition).  It has a creative commons license.  This ticket is for getting the tutorial into Sage itself.

At this point, I think someone just needs to scan through to see if there are big problems in any of the formats.  Long-term things would be expanding it by uncommenting a lot of the examples we had to cut due to page limits, or rearranging things so that the examples are inline instead of grouped at the end of each section.

Several references to Chapters of HLA.  These should be removed or made clear.  First paragraph is from the chapter saying there is a Sage tutorial.  This **is** the tutorial.  So...this needs a sweep for references or comments that only make sense for the HLA chapter and not for the thematic tutorial.
