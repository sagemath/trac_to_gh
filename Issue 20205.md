# Issue 20205: Deprecate inject_on()

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20442

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2016-04-14 08:10:31

The functions `inject_on`/`inject_off` are most likely used by nobody: they are superseded by the `K.<x> = ...` syntax and not all constructors are supported.
