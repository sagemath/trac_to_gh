Keywords: polytopes, polar

In #28850 we added an error message when taking the polar of non-polar polytopes.

We also added a keyword `in_affine_span`, which restricts the polar construction to the affine span of the polytope.

As this is likely the output a user wants, we improve the error message.

We also mark a doctest a long time.
