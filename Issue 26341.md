This ``i` divides `j`.::` will become `$i$ divides $j$.:`, so either remove the period or add a space before the `::`.

`if weighted is None: self._weighted = False` should be on 2 lines.

Bad space: `self.allow_loops(loops ,check=False)`.

Otherwise LGTM.

Thank you, although you've picked up some trivial failures:
