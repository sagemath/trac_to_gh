This ``i` divides `j`.::` will become `$i$ divides $j$.:`, so either remove the period or add a space before the `::`.

`if weighted is None: self._weighted = False` should be on 2 lines.

Bad space: `self.allow_loops(loops ,check=False)`.

Otherwise LGTM.

I have implemented your comments. On the way, I found some places where to use `.edges(sort=False)`.

Thank you, although you've picked up some trivial failures:

```
sage -t --long src/sage/graphs/digraph_generators.py  # 4 doctests failed
```

Once fixed, you can set a positive review.
