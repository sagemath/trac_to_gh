Ralf, do you plan any new pynac release with https://github.com/pynac/pynac/pull/339 soon? If not, I'd rather add that patch in Sage anyway.

In general, unless it's a blocker I'd want to keep a monthly release cycle. So, you could also wait until the first weeks of February.

That's not unreasonable. Thanks!

Retarging tickets optimistically to the next milestone.  If you are responsible for this ticket (either its reporter or owner) and don't believe you are likely to complete this ticket before the next release (8.7) please retarget this ticket's milestone to sage-pending or sage-wishlist.

We are now officially in the "first weeks of February". I would be very happy with the new release, since this is last remaining dependency for #22029.
