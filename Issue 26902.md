# Issue 26902: bug in term_order.py

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27139

Original creator: @denissunko

Original creation time: 2019-01-26 17:48:52

In Sage 8.6, typing

```
sage: R.<x,y,z,t>=PolynomialRing(AA,order='lex(2),lex(2)')
sage: x>y
```


raises a `TypeError`. The error report boils down to


```
/usr/local/share/Sage/sage-8.6/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/rings/polynomial/term_order.pyc in sortkey_block(self, f)
   1138         for block in self:
   1139             r = getattr(block, "sortkey_" + block.name())(f[n:n + len(block)])
-> 1140             key += r
   1141             n += len(block)
   1142         return key

TypeError: Argument 'self' has incorrect type (expected sage.rings.polynomial.polydict.ETuple, got tuple)
sage:                                                                           
```


I have changed line 1140 in term_order.py to


```
-> 1140             key += tuple(r)
```


which works as expected. Noticing that sibling functions to `sortkey_block()` in term_order.py are all coerced to return `key` as a tuple, I think that this is a localized bug which may be corrected safely as above.

The error appears only with lex being used in a block ordering. Obviously other block orderings do not trigger a call to `sortkey_block()`. This indicates some global design issue, which I do not feel competent to pursue.

Ticket retargeted after milestone closed (if you don't believe this ticket is appropriate for the Sage 8.8 release please retarget manually)

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).

Replying to [ticket:27139 gh-denissunko]:
> The error appears only with lex being used in a block ordering. Obviously other block orderings do not trigger a call to `sortkey_block()`. This indicates some global design issue, which I do not feel competent to pursue.

This is because `sortkey_lex` returns the exponent tuple as is, which means that the result is an `ETuple` rather than a `tuple`. Similarly, `sortkey_invlex` also returns an `ETuple`. For reasons of efficiency, this might be intended, as converting the exponent tuple to a tuple is not necessary in most cases.

Therefore, your suggested solution looks correct to me. Could you add a doctest please to test that the bug is fixed? For example like this:

```
        TESTS:

        Check that the issue in :trac:`27139` is fixed::

            sage: R.<x,y,z,t> = PolynomialRing(AA, order='lex(2),lex(2)')
            sage: x > y
            True
```

Also, please add your full name in the Authors field of this ticket, so that the patchbots run the tests.
