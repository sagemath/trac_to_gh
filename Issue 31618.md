This is the status. I used the configure file of sagemath.spec in fedora which allows to use python3.10.0 in the system. Using the link in  #32576 I used the revised cysignals, and I also used gmpy2.1.0rc1, both are compiled. The only unsuccessful package is pyzmq; the fedora system package python3-zmq exists and I was able to recompile it locally. The error in Sage is:

gcc build/temp.linux-x86_64-3.9/tmp/timer_createq5lapz40.o -o build/temp.linux-x86_64-3.9/a.out
  error: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'a.out'

It happens with 22.2.1 and 22.0.3
I do not know how to use the system package for this.
