I think that for example


```
except TypeError, e:
```


at `src/sage/rings/polynomial/skew_polynomial_ring.py` is py2-only -code. I found a total of 16 lines by


```
egrep 'except [a-zA-Z]+ ?,' src/sage -R
```


but almost all are false positives. Anyways, this should be checked.

Correction: Also `except TypeError, ValueError:` is an error in Python3. Hence there are about ten lines to correct.
