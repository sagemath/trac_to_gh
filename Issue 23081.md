Why are you changing the copyright statement to some non-standard format? See http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#headings-of-sage-library-code-files

In the documentation of `coerce()`, I wonder why the word "attempt" is used. I would just write "Coerce..."

According to 

http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#python-code-style

we are also supposed to follow the pep8 standard.

It might be closer to bikeshedding, but IMO I think it should be

```diff
-Return the additive order of `x`.
+Return the additive order of ``x``.
```

since `x` is referring to the argument, which is a "code" object.

It's outside the scope of this ticket, but just as a note: the `coerce` function should not be here, nor does it strictly do coercions (i.e., it tries a conversion afterwards).
