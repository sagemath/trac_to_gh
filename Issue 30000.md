The `m()` method might not be used in the code, but some user might be using it in their personal code. You should issue a deprecation instead with the appropriate redirect:

```python
from sage.misc.superseded import deprecation
deprecation(30237, "the .m(i, j) method has been deprecated; instead use .coxeter_matrix()[i,j]")
```

or whatever message is appropriate.

Other than that, LGTM.
