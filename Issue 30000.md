The `m()` method might not be used in the code, but some user might be using it in their personal code. You should issue a deprecation instead with the appropriate redirect:

```python
from sage.misc.superseded import deprecation
deprecation(30237, "the .m(i, j) method has been deprecated; instead use .coxeter_matrix()[i,j]")
```

or whatever message is appropriate.

Other than that, LGTM.

It needs to be doctested with a docstring as well.

Ah, sorry, wasn't sure if that needed to be done in this case. It's there now.

Can you quickly add a docstring just saying `This is deprecated, use ``self.coxeter_matrix()[i,j]`` instead.`?

Sorry, one last thing. It needs to actually have the same result/behavior as before.

I hope I understood correctly; I made it have the same behavior as before by "fixing" it; should it instead have the same _implementation_ as before (which would cause the old doctests to throw errors)? Thanks for guiding me through the protocol here, by the way.

Changing status from needs_review to positive_review.
