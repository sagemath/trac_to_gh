Currently, the implementation of the Greene-Nijenhuis-Wilf "hook-walk" algorithm for generating random standard Young tableaux is incorrect. It doesn't return incorrect output but it takes more steps than necessary.

In sage.combinat.tableau.StandardTableaux_shape.random_element, the code creating the array `hooks` has two off-by-one errors that result in the addition of two copies of `cell` to `hooks`. It should not contain `cell` at all.

I've also taken the liberty of fixing a comment and deleting some extra whitespace in this function.

I wasn't sure how to write a test but would be happy to try to implement one if anyone has any ideas.

It sounds like it is not "incorrect" but "inefficient", so I have updated the description accordingly. Anyways, as far as I can tell, everything looks good and it doesn't output any bad data. So positive review.
