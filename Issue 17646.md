Sage is a little late on matplotlib versions ; it would be nice to follow upstream more closely.

This is probably a duplicate of #17618, that still requires a bit of work.

It is definitely a duplicate of #17618 although we started it at MPL 1.4.2 we have to update it to 1.4.3 now. Contributions welcome.
