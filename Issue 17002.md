Keywords: lcalc


```
sage: from sage.libs.lcalc.lcalc_Lfunction import *
sage: Z = Lfunction_Zeta() #Riemann zeta function
sage: Z.value(100*I)
NaN - NaN*I
sage: CDF(100*I).zeta() #the correct value
6.51721042625 + 0.181288425338*I
sage: Z.value(99*I) #very large
-1.05677035996952e16 - 1.77185752069124e15*I
sage: Z.value(102*I) #very large
8.96446660698985e16 - 7.32159572862776e16*I
sage: 
sage: chi = DirichletGroup(7).gens()[0]
sage: L = Lfunction_from_character(chi) #this one seems to work
sage: L.value(100*I)
5.91365407523633 - 3.18382625901338*I
sage: L = Lfunction_from_character(chi**2) #this one does not
sage: L.value(100*I)
1.21202136552168e15 - 7.03760325879769e16*I
```


Note: this was done with sage 6.2. My apologies if this has been fixed since.

This is a pure upstream issue with lcalc, nothing to do with Sage. This ticket should be reported upstream.

Changing component from number theory to packages: standard.

What's more, in Sage 6.4 I get _different_ values.

```
sage: sage: L = Lfunction_from_character(chi**2) #this one does not
sage: sage: L.value(100*I)
-3.39759949284668e16 - 7.09820432707377e16*I
sage: sage: Z.value(99*I) #very large
-1.02176956945931e16 - 3.52220370693934e15*I
```
