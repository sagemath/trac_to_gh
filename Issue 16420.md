What's the purpose of this ticket?

I didn't open it. The only strange thing is that the title refers to my work, and actually I think it is identical with some commit message I did on #15820. Either someone has hacked my account, or the git trac scripts have a bug (say, `git trac push 15820` creating a new ticket).

Note also that this ticket immediately follows the "help" ticket #16656.
