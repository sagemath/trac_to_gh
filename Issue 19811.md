In [SageMath](SageMath) Version 6.8, Release Date: 2015-07-26 I get

R.<x,y> = GF(3037000453)[]
R.zero().degree(x)

---> ValueError, max() arg is an empty sequence.

With smaller coefficient domains it works.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20048

This is also one way to make an error:


```
from sage.rings.polynomial.real_roots import *
bernstein_polynomial_factory_intlist([])
```


But I don't know if this can be triggered by normal use. The class is meant to be for internal use only.
