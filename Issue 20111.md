Seems good to me.

However the patchbot is not entirely happy, it says

```

Should we fix it?

As for python3, we should leave it as `__nonzero__` since Cython extension types are fine with both `__nonzero__` and `__bool__`.  See the discussion at #21887.

Looks good. The only thing I stumbled upon: In https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit/?id=8195327f6709a45a0942692dabf153fc6f4cb28e you write `Zq` instead of `\ZZ_q` and you use `\ZZ_q` with an incorrect number of backticks once.

Apart from that, positive review.
