# Issue 32127: every quaternion lies in every quaternion order

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32364

Original creator: lorenz

Original creation time: 2021-08-11 06:32:59

CC:  pbruin

Keywords: quaternion orders, elements, membership

This is wrong:


```
sage: Q.<i,j,k> = QuaternionAlgebra(-1,-19)
sage: O = Q.quaternion_order([1,i,j,k])
sage: 1/5 in O
True
sage: (i+j)/123 in O
True
```

Here

```
+        TESTS::
+
+        Test for :trac:`32364`:
```

there should be a single colon on top line and a double colon on bottom lines. Double colons are signaling an indented block.

Changing priority from minor to major.

Bumping priority since this bug can lead to mathematical errors.

Stalled in `needs_review` or `needs_info`; likely won't make it into Sage 9.5.
