As reported in https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/issues/543

Yes, I suspect the sphinx upgrade had something to do with it. That's the most likely. 

Python2 vs python3: I haven't tried yet with python3. I am a bit busy and my first port of call was eliminating texlive2017 vs texlive2019.

I confirm: with Sage 8.7, running 

```
./sage -docbuild reference/tensor_free_modules pdf
```

yields a pdf file with the references properly set. It fails with Sage 8.8.beta7 and later versions.

I think you can modify this and not do any changes in the `sphinxcite{...}` commands:

```
\usepackage{xcite}
\usepackage{xr-hyper}
\externaldocument[../references/]{../references/references}
\externalcitedocument[../references/]{../references/references}
% These lines must appear before \usepackage{hyperref}.
```

These commands take an optional argument which specifies the prefix used in their citations. Then `\sphinxcite{../references/index:mil1958}` will be converted to `index:mil1958`, which should then be looked up in the master bibliography file. This renders as plain text `[Mil1958]`, but maybe that's the best you can hope for: PDF files shouldn't have live links to other PDF files, should they? Is that what we would want?

Maybe the best solution would be if Sphinx magically extracted the relevant citations and included only those in each PDF file, but I don't know how to do that. Maybe we can convert our master bibliography file into a BibTeX `.bib` file and use that?

Excellent! I may be incorrect, but I think LaTeX parses `../references/references.aux` to get bibliographical info.

I think a problem with this is that combinat.tex will want to access graphs.aux, which won't be ready until graphs.tex is compiled, while graphs.tex will want to access combinat.aux. So there is no good order to process these.

Regarding #27497: it's going to be a lot tedious work to do this (speaking from experience, since I have moved most of Sage's other references to the master bibliography file). I don't want to do it.

On a sage-on-gentoo build I see things like

```

Package: xcite 2011/09/02 v1.0 eXternal Citations (EG)

(/usr/share/texmf-dist/tex/latex/hyperref/xr-hyper.sty

Package xr Warning:
No file ../references/references.aux
LABELS NOT IMPORTED.
 on input line 35.

Package xc Warning:
No file ../references/references.aux
LABELS NOT IMPORTED.

```
 
I don't see any reason why this couldn't happen with vanilla sage. For the proposed fix to work it is necessary that the stuff under `../references/*` be built and I don't see any way to insure that, especially if things are built in parallel.
