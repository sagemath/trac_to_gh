With sage 9.2.beta12:

```
sage: ri = rising_factorial                                                       
sage: var('k,l')                                                                
(k, l)
sage: F82=sum((-1)**l*factorial(k)/factorial(l)/factorial(k+1-l)*ri(8/5+k+l,k+1-l)*ri(2/5,k+l+1),l,0,+oo)                                                 
sage: F83=sum((-1)**l*factorial(k)/factorial(l)/factorial(k+1-l)*ri(8/5+k+l,k+1-l)*ri(3/5,k+l+1),l,0,+oo)
```

Then F82 works and F83 gives many

```

;;; Jumping to the outermost toplevel prompt
