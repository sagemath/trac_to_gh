Ok I fixed the issues you raised at #23962, except that I used 79 as a cutoff. Is there a reason why you said 72 characters instead of the 79 in pep8?

If you really want to test #23962, you should use `E2` here:

```
            sage: E1.rank(use_database=False)
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
            RuntimeError: rank not provably correct (lower bound: 0)
            sage: E1._EllipticCurve_rational_field__rank
            (0, False)
            sage: E1.rank()
            0
            sage: E1._EllipticCurve_rational_field__rank
            (0, True)
```
