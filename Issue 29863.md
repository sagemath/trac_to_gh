# Issue 29863: Conversion for residue fields of number fields does not use lift map

Keywords: residue_field; lift_map

When I do

```
ZZp = Zp(p=2,prec=10, type = 'fixed-mod')
PRZZp.<x> = ZZp[]
R.<pi> = ZZp.extension(x^2+x+1)
Fp = R.residue_field()
a = Fp(pi)
b = R(a); b
```

I get pi.

But when I do



```
PRZZ.<x> = ZZ[]
R.<pi> = ZZ.extension(x^2+x+1)
Fp = ResidueField(R.ideal(2))
a = Fp(pi)
b = R(a)
```

I get an error.

This can be solved with lift_map, but I feel like that should be in the conversion. Furthermore, it would be nice to be able to lift polynomials with coefficients in the residue field. I made my own implementation of that.

Also note that without 'fixed-mod', it lifts to pi+O(2).
