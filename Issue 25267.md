# Issue 25267: Implement _an_element_ for matrix spaces

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25504

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2018-06-04 12:24:18

Currently, this is a bit too trivial:

```
sage: MatrixSpace(QQ, 3, 3).an_element()
[1 0 0]
[0 0 0]
[0 0 0]
```

If you could add a test `M.density()` for the sparse test to verify that it is indeed sparse (beyond the implicit test that you would kill your memory if such a sparse matrix was dense). Actually, that test makes me a bit nervous if at some point it does turn into a dense matrix. It would make it nearly impossible to debug because my computer would keep running out of memory. Perhaps it would be better to scale down the matrix and just do `M.density()` to show it is sparse.
