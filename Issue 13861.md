As part of #12913, we are adding inheritance from `Element` to many classes that inherit from `CombinatorialObject`. However, there are many functions are relying on a valid call to `cmp`, but `Element` overrides this. This patch is a fix which implements a basic `__cmp__` for `CombinatorialObject` for the switch.
