Volker Braun pointed out in ticket:31479#comment:12 that sage gives the following wrong answer on a 32-bit machine after the bug-fix patch of #31479 is applied:

```
sage: a,b,c,d = var("a b c d")
sage: ((a + b + c)^30 * (3*b + d - 5/d)^3).expand().subs(a=0,b=2,c=-1)
d^3 + 18*d^2 + 1739461754973*d - 8697308774865/d + 450/d^2 - 125/d^3 + 36
```

This answer is congruent modulo `2^32` to `d^3 + 18*d^2 + 93*d - 465/d + 450/d^2 - 125/d^3 + 36`, which is the correct answer, so it seems clear that the problem comes from an integer overflow error. Perhaps the overflow error can also be produced on a 64-bit machine.

I reproduced the bug by installing sage in a 32-bit debian virtual machine, and found a much simpler example of the overflow:

```
sage: (2*x).subs(x=-2^31)
0
```

More generally:

```
sage: for n in range(10):
....:     print(n, (n*x).subs(x=-2^31)/2^31)
0 0
1 -1
2 0
3 -1

8 0

I think the problem is an incorrect calculation of absolute value:

```
sage: abs(x).subs(x=-2^31)
-2147483648
```

To decide whether a multiplication might cause an overflow, pynac compares the absolute values of the factors to a certain bound. In the example of comment:2, the absolute value of a factor is negative, so it is less than the bound, even though the factor is actually very large.

And I think the incorrect absolute value comes from the C++ `std::labs` function. The documentation of that function says "If the result cannot be represented as a long int (such as labs(LONG_MIN) in an implementation with two's complement signed values), it causes undefined behavior."

I should be able to write a pynac patch soon that tests my theory. Even if it isn't the bug we are looking for, this bug in the absolute value needs to be fixed.

The pynac bugs on this ticket do not currently affect 64-bit sage.  (This is because pynac does not store `-2^63` as a `long integer`, even though it could fit into that space on a 64-bit machine.)  However, they will affect 64-bit machines after the branch on #31986 is merged.  (See the explanation and examples there.)

Followup tickets: #31984 and #31986.

I will try to post this (and my other pynac patches) to the pynac github repository soon.  My previous attempts failed because I know almost nothing about git, but now I understand that I need a fork, instead of a clone, so I hope to be successful.
