Volker Braun pointed out in ticket:31479#comment:12 that sage gives the following wrong answer on a 32-bit machine after the bug-fix patch of #31479 is applied:

```
sage: a,b,c,d = var("a b c d")
sage: ((a + b + c)^30 * (3*b + d - 5/d)^3).expand().subs(a=0,b=2,c=-1)
d^3 + 18*d^2 + 1739461754973*d - 8697308774865/d + 450/d^2 - 125/d^3 + 36
```

This answer is congruent modulo `2^32` to `d^3 + 18*d^2 + 93*d - 465/d + 450/d^2 - 125/d^3 + 36`, which is the correct answer, so it seems clear that the problem comes from an integer overflow error. Perhaps the overflow error can also be produced on a 64-bit machine.

I reproduced the bug by installing sage in a 32-bit debian virtual machine, and found a much simpler example of the overflow:

```
sage: (2*x).subs(x=-2^31)
0
```

More generally:

```
sage: for n in range(10):
....:     print(n, (n*x).subs(x=-2^31)/2^31)
0 0
1 -1
2 0
3 -1

5 -1

7 -1
8 0
9 -1

I think the problem is an incorrect calculation of absolute value:

```
sage: abs(x).subs(x=-2^31)
-2147483648
```

To decide whether a multiplication might cause an overflow, pynac compares the absolute values of the factors to a certain bound. In the example of comment:2, the absolute value of a factor is negative, so it is less than the bound, even though the factor is actually very large.

And I think the incorrect absolute value comes from the C++ `std::labs` function. The documentation of that function says "If the result cannot be represented as a long int (such as labs(LONG_MIN) in an implementation with two's complement signed values), it causes undefined behavior."

I should be able to write a pynac patch soon that tests my theory. Even if it isn't the bug we are looking for, this bug in the absolute value needs to be fixed.

Followup tickets: #31984 and #31986.

I will try to post this (and my other pynac patches) to the pynac github repository soon.  My previous attempts failed because I know almost nothing about git, but now I understand that I need a fork, instead of a clone, so I hope to be successful.
