On top of 8.0.rc3 + #24240, this :

* builds and passes {{{ptestlong without any error whatsoever ;
* sort-of passes its own test suite, modulo expected failures and numerical noise (but see [this](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/TXjupHtn9kc/Ncrl_5IxBQAJ) post on sage-devel) ;
* installs my 443 R packages without problem.

==`needs_review`. As usual, rewiew on Cygwin and Macintosh more than welcome...

Note : upgading `r` entails upgrading `rpy2` : this is normal.
