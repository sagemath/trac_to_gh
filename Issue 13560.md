Assignee: sage-combinat

This is actually documented in the docstring:

```
sage: def a(n): yield 1*n; yield 2*n
sage: def b(): yield 'a'; yield 'b'
sage: CartesianProduct(a(3), b()).list()
[[3, 'a'], [3, 'b']]
```
But by the principle of minimal surprise this should yield an error about generators and not silently return the wrong answer. Just to illustrate how dangerous this behavior is note that `sage/combinat/integer_vector.py` falls precisely into this trap.

Hellooooooo !!

Well, same question as the one asked on sage-devel : why shouldn't we build the list of each iterator ? If the list is infinite then the code will not terminate, but of course the user asked for it, and if we do make lists from generators we store a quantity of information which is (expectedly) small compared to the output ?

Err... Actually, if the function does not return a list but only "yields" the elements one at a time, what we store could actually be much, much more than what we should.

Hence, what about doing this :
* If we are given two lists, just do the job without problems
* If we are given iterators, convert them to lists first then do the job ?

With a `.. NOTE::` in the method's documentation, saying exactly that. This way we never use more than what we actually need to use.

Yeah, when we need significant overhead we know that we can always delegate to combinat stuff `:-P`

Of course, we could *only* do that with the elements of the list which are generators, and use sensible code otherwise. With warnings everywhere.

Actually, perhaps the best would be that :

   There is an optional flag called cache_iterator or something, which is set to False by default. When it is set to False, the function behaves exactly like the one you wrote, that is REFUSES INPUT if there is an iterator among them. The message could even say "if your iterators are all finite, wrap them with a `list()` to make them finite. 

Then, we could say (in the exception message, or in the doc, or at both places) that if you want the code to work with infinite stuff, or when you cannot ensure that all iterators are finite, and hence cannot wrap them with `list()` casts, then you can set `cache_iterator` to `True` which would do all the caching (or call the combinat stuff and enjoy their overhead if they already wrote it somewhere).

Hence :
* No speed loss for smart cases
* The speed will not be destroyed because the user forgot to wrap with `list()` calls, or just did not know it could make a difference
* Crazy guys iterating on infinite things can still use the function, be it finally implemented in the method itself or delegated to combinat stuff.

Well.. Is there any other corner case ? `:-P`

Well, you cannot convert them to lists when they are infinite, and you do not want to cache stuff when you already stored it once.
