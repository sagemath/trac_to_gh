I think it can be improved further as the distance can be float so 



```

cdef int distance

cdef priority_queue[pair[pair[int, int], pair[int, int]]] pq

```


can be changed to 


```

cdef double distance

cdef priority_queue[pair[pair[double, int], pair[int, int]]] pq
```


waiting for your thoughts on it....
