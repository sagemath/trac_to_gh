# Issue 18081: CryptoMiniSat Memleak

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18318

Original creator: malb

Original creation time: 2015-04-28 09:41:32

The CryptoMiniSat wrapper class's destructor does nothing which produces a pretty bad memleak.


```python
  def __dealloc__(self):
    del self

```
