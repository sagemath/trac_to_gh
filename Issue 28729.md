This is something that's been discussed before but I don't think there's a ticket for it.

Python 3 allows most unicode symbols (except some digit characters, whitespace and other oddities) to be used in identifiers, so we can easily provide unicode aliases for some common built-ins, e.g.


```
π = pi
ℯ = e
𝒾 = I
ℤ = ZZ
ℚ = QQ
```

etc.  One can have fun with it.

In Python 3 it is also possible to do tab-completion for many unicode characters: https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/generated/IPython.core.completer.html#latex-and-unicode-completion

This enables nice-looking code like:


```
sage: sin(π)
0
sage: cos(π)
-1
```


There were some things I found lacking, but this list can easily be expanded by modifying the dict in `IPython.completer.latex_symbols`.

Due to identifier normalization, these four identifiers are actually the same as their ASCII equivalents. For example:

```
sage: Q = 42
sage: ℚ
42
```

This is an upstream issue really.
