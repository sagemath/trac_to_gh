Would it be an option to call this method `coefficient()` instead?  This would be more descriptive in my opinion, and would mean that the existing, but currently useless, method `coefficient()` becomes useful.

This change violates the deprecation policy.  You can't just delete methods from the public API.   http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_in_python.html#deprecation
