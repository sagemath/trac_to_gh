# Issue 28951: Move vertex facet graph to combinatorial polyhedron

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29188

Original creator: @kliem

Original creation time: 2020-02-12 12:20:33

CC:  jipilab @laisrast

Keywords: polyhedra, vertex facet graph, combinatorial polyhedron

We move the method `vertex_facet_graph` from `Polyhedron_base` to `CombinatorialPolyhedron`.

Along the way we fix an bug, namely that `vertex_facet_graph(labels=False)` has the edges the wrong way::


```
sage: P = polytopes.cube()
sage: P.vertex_facet_graph().is_isomorphic(P.vertex_facet_graph(False))
False
sage: P.vertex_facet_graph().is_isomorphic(P.vertex_facet_graph(False).reverse())
True
```

There is a space missing in the inputs.

Then, I would just swap the two examples to show the default behavior first. 

Could you make this sentence more clear:


```
If ``names`` is ``True`` but no names are provided,
```


I would suggest to put `If names is True (the default) but no names...`.

I'll just put it back to needs work until this is done.

Batch modifying tickets that will likely not be ready for 9.1, based on a review of the ticket title, branch/review status, and last modification date.
