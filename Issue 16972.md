# Issue 16972: allow the use of distinct edgecolor and color for polygons (and other 2d shapes)

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17209

Keywords: edgecolor, polygon, plot2d

I would like to have a green polygon with black border. I can achieve this by superposing two polygons:

```
sage: P = polygon([[0,0],[0,1],[2,1],[1,0]],color='limegreen',fill=True)
sage: P += polygon([[0,0],[0,1],[2,1],[1,0]],color='black',fill=False)
sage: P
```

It should be possible to do that with *one polygon*, using the `edgecolor` keyword of `matplotlib`.
