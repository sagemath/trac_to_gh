```
sage: C = GF(5).cartesian_product(GF(5))
sage: C.one() - C.one()
... BOOOOM (infinite recursion) ...
```

The reason is that there is no default implementation of `_sub_` in `ElementMethods` of `Rings` (whereas there is one in `sage.structure.element.RingElement`).

Seems to be OK. If you want to modify something, maybe add a phrase like "By default `a-b` is defined just as a sum of `a` and the negation of `b`."

I do not especially want to modify something ;-) Actually this is what is in `sage.structure.element.RingElement`. But not all ring elements inherit from it. Hence the failure.

Yep, so the real problem behind this specific error is that there is no `.direct_product(...)` for rings (like at least groups have). But I think that (default) definition A-B := A+(-B) is always the right thing to do.
