# Issue 33841: pycodestyle cleanup in src/sage/graphs/graph_plot.py

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/34078

Original creator: dcoudert

Original creation time: 2022-06-25 14:34:11

We fix pycodestyle issues in `graph_plot.py`, except some `E203 whitespace before ':'` that ease the readability of dictionary `DEFAULT_PLOT_OPTIONS`. 

We also fix the few details in `graph_list.py` and `graph_plot_js.py`.
