# Issue 28208: Move references from combinat/ to references/index.rst

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28445

Original creator: @hensc

Original creation time: 2019-09-02 19:33:24

This is part of #27497.

One should also add DOI to all these references.

The attached file is the output from command `grep -R "\.\.[ ]* \[" src/sage/combinat` and then deleting a few false positives (thus it is an update of the file attached to #27497 after #28105).
