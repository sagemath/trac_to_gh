Because I did not think it was a good idea to expose a function like that to the user for the moment. This function is very specific, it mostly does what the oa product already does and it can lead to confusions (a guy finds this function before the other, and so uses it for the usual product).

When the OA library will be more "research-level" and everything why not, but for the moment there is not much to play with the OA themselves or do anything with them. We just generate those which exist.

I was somehow convinced that I had written another commit that needed this function too, but I don't seem to find it again. I hope I did not lose it anywhere or filed it in the wrong "component".

Well. I know that #16655 is somehow a dependency of #16780 as #16780 can be shortened if the `resolvable=True` flag is available. But I was sure I had done something similar with this product....

Anyway `O_o`
