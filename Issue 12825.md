# Issue 12825: LyndonWords from composition beginning by 0's

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/12997

Original creator: Adrien

Original creation time: 2012-05-24 10:55:10

Assignee: sage-combinat

CC:  slabbe saliola

Keywords: lyndon words, sage-combinat

LyndonWords, when applied to a composition starting with 0's, gives a wrong result, e.g.:

for w in LyndonWords(list([0,1])):
    print w

return 1 instead of 2, and in a similar vein

for w in LyndonWords(list([0,2])):
    print w

return '12' 

The problem is also described here : http://groups.google.com/group/sage-combinat-devel/browse_thread/thread/5c4b691a692b56b0#

The problem is that necklace._sfc() ignores 0's at the begining of a list.

A modified lyndon_word.py file which fix the problem is attached.

Hello Adrien, can you post a patch with your changes instead of the .py file?

You can follow SÃ©bastien's guide on [http://thales.math.uqam.ca/~labbes/Sage/how-to-contribute/ How to contribute to Sage](http://thales.math.uqam.ca/~labbes/Sage/how-to-contribute/ How to contribute to Sage) (especially steps 15 to 17).

I've attached the review patch which adds the doctests and tweaks the code format. Could someone give this a quick second review please?

Thanks,

Ok, this looks good to me.

I have added a patch to change the "raise" to python3 syntax
