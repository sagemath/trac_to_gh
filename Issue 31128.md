(from #31348)

... using `SAGE_NTL_PREFIX` via `sage_conf`.

This is for macOS with configurations in which Python extensions no longer have access to `/usr/local` due to the use of `-isysroot` in the compiler configuration from sysconfig.

In particular, we add handling for `ntl` to the `.homebrew-build-env` script -- so that after `brew install ntl; brew unlink ntl`, our `./configure` still finds NTL.

In `src/sage/misc/cython.py` we add `NTL_LIBDIR` to `standard_libdirs` and likewise we add `NTL_INCDIR` to `standard_incdirs`. Why do we need to add this to every file again that uses ntl?

Ok, I see:

```
[sagelib-9.3.beta7] cc1: warning: command line option ‘-std=c++11’ is valid for C++/ObjC++ but not for C

Which raises a bit the question, why its called `NTL_CFLAGS` and not `NTL_CXXFLAGS`.

The names follow the conventions of `pkg-config` - which does not make this distinction.
