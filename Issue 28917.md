I think it would be better to just return the place if it exists and `None` otherwise. This makes testing much easier because you can do things like

```python
if L.has_place(1):
    print("success")
```

and

```python
p = L.has_place(1)
if p:
    return p
```

without having to extract the information (note that the first use-case will always be `True` as it is a non-empty tuple). I would also consider renaming this to `get_place` and if you want a simple binary test function:

```python
def has_place(self, degree):
    return self.get_place(degree) is not None
```

Good point. Done.

The documentation does not build due to this line:

```
+        Return a place of ``degree`.
```
