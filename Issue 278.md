# Issue 278: Make sage -clone more like hg clone

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: ncalexan

Original creation time: 2007-02-22 23:55:05

Assignee: was

Keywords: clone

I often say sage -clone sage-main sage-ncalexan instead of sage -b main ; sage -clone ncalexan.  It would be nice if this was parsed automagically, and if I was alerted that sage-blah is almost certainly not correct.
