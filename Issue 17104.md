# Issue 17104: visualize_structure for matrices: behavior does not match documentation

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jhpalmieri

Original creation time: 2014-11-13 22:53:08

The docstring for `visualize_structure` (from the file `matrix/matrix2.pyx`) says that the input is

```
        -  ``filename`` - either a path or None in which case a
           filename in the current directory is chosen automatically
           (default:None)
```

In fact, if `filename` is None, then the file gets silently saved in a temporary directory (by default a subdirectory of `DOTSAGE/temp`), leaving the user to wonder where their file went. I guess the right thing to do is to change the docstring, since I think that's how other methods for saving graphics work.

(The docstring is also misformatted: `maxsize` should be in the bulleted list of inputs.)

`visualize_structure` no longer has a `filename` argument.

I can't even create a matrix with a dimension >= `2^31`:

```
sage: m = matrix(GF(2), 2**30, 1, {})
Killed: 9
```

So I can't test the second part of this. The first part looks good.

The transposed should work if you have sufficient memory:

```
M = matrix(GF(2), 1, 2^32, sparse=True)
```

The changes make sense, but I'm still stuck trying to find an example that used to be broken and now works. I get something like this with or without the change:

```
sage: M = matrix(GF(2), 1, 2^32, sparse=True)
sage: M.visualize_structure(maxsize=None)

As I said before, the second batch of changes make sense, whether they have any immediate benefit or not. So let's merge them.
