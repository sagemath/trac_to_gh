The docstring for `visualize_structure` (from the file `matrix/matrix2.pyx`) says that the input is

```
        -  ``filename`` - either a path or None in which case a
           filename in the current directory is chosen automatically
           (default:None)
```

In fact, if `filename` is None, then the file gets silently saved in a temporary directory (by default a subdirectory of `DOTSAGE/temp`), leaving the user to wonder where their file went. I guess the right thing to do is to change the docstring, since I think that's how other methods for saving graphics work.

(The docstring is also misformatted: `maxsize` should be in the bulleted list of inputs.)

I can't even create a matrix with a dimension >= `2^31`:

```
sage: m = matrix(GF(2), 2**30, 1, {})
Killed: 9
```

So I can't test the second part of this. The first part looks good.

The transposed should work if you have sufficient memory:

```
M = matrix(GF(2), 1, 2^32, sparse=True)
```
