# Issue 18428: Add verbose method names for primitive central and seminormal idempotents

Keywords: days65, symmetric group algebra, idempotents

The SymmetricGroupAlgebra class has methods (cpi, cpis, and epsilon_ik whose names do not advertise their function. These should be renamed to something more appropriate. For example, 

```
cpi = central_primitive_idempotent
cpis = central_primitive_idempotents
epsilon_ik = seminormal_basis_element
```

Also, there should be a separate function for `seminormal_idempotent` which is the equivalent of running `epsilon_ik` with both input tableaux the same. I.e., this new function should return the seminormal idemotent indexed by a given standard tableau.

Just wondering: shouldn't this be primitive central idempotents? It's about the central idempotents that are primitive, not about primitive idempotents that are central.

For the record: for good or bad, in `SemisimpleAlgebras.FiniteDimensional`, the method computing those is called central_orthogonal_idempotents. Consistency one way or the other would be nice!

Maybe we could just overload the `SemisimpleAlgebras.FiniteDimensional` method with `cpi` by renaming this last one, as it may be faster.


```
sage: A4 = SymmetricGroup(4).algebra(QQ)
sage: A4.central_orthogonal_idempotents() == A4.cpis()
True
```
