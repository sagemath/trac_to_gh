CC:  @jdemeyer @embray

This is a follow-up on #21480, which put `src/setup.py` in charge of all `sagelib`building and removed dependencies on various environment variables, as a step towards the goal of making `sagelib` an ordinary Python package (#21507). 

However, there is still a dependency on `$SAGE_CYTHONIZED`, which needs to be set in a way that matches the build-base (set by setup.py build --build-base).

This dependency should be removed.

See also #21508 on other cleanup issues of `src/setup.py`.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21535

So what would be the impact of removing SAGE_CYTHONIZED entirely?  As far as I can tell it is only really used by setup.py/sage_setup.  Implementing this ticket makes it pretty pointless I think--it makes SAGE_CYTHONIZED not even make sense, really.

Would it be a problem to outright remove it?  Or does it need to still be supported somehow?

That would be great!

By the way, in my current attempt at #21469 I noticed that `--build-base` already works. 

This line in `src/setup.py`:

```
build_base = 'build' # the distutils default. Changing it is not supported by this setup.sh.
```

is probably a leftover from my earlier changes, and should probably be removed. The variable `build_base` does not seem to be used, and the comment is no longer correct.

Commit 33746a2 is good, but I think some of the changes in 769de13 are not going in the right direction.

1) In particular the following, I think, breaks the already working `--build-base` feature (see comment 14)!

```diff
diff --git a/src/setup.py b/src/setup.py
index 6354427..be4036d 100755
--- a/src/setup.py
+++ b/src/setup.py

+# Directory to store Cython-generated files
+SAGE_CYTHONIZED = os.path.join(build_base, "cythonized")
+
```


2) The hardcoded paths depending on SAGE_SRC make it harder for the VPATH patch. Perhaps it's best to do this work after VPATH (#21469) is done.

This should address the concerns about `build_base`. The doctests still hardcode `build/cythonized`, but I prefer to fix that in a different ticket. I think this branch here does enough good things (even if it's not perfect), so I'm setting it back to needs_review.

Well, in #21480 the variable `build_base` was still used, but some of Erik's later tickets seem to have removed all uses of it.

I'm not actively concerned about any of my existing open tickets addressing issues in the setup.py.  I'd like to get back to that at some point but if any of those tickets still end up being useful I'll rework them.
