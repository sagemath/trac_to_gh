green bot, please review

Please rebase this over #23702. I'm also not sure we should remove the `from six.moves import range`, but since you have been doing the most on Python3, I leave that decision to you.

Seems to work. I tested with `--randorder 2`, now testing with `3`.

Hopefully tests cover all use cases; compare to #23625 where I have made an error in `is_join_distributive`.

At least `./sage -t --randorder 3 --long src/sage/combinat/root_system/weyl_characters.py` fails with this patch. May be that it failed even before.

This also fails on vanilla sage 8.1.b3
