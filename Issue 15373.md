# Issue 15373: Division field for an elliptic curve

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: wuthrich

Original creation time: 2013-12-30 19:30:33

Keywords: elliptic curves, division field, torsion points, galois representation

Currently there is a hidden function `_division_field` in gal_rep, that computes, for an elliptic curve over Q, the number field where all the p-torsion points are rational. This function should be made visible. One might also think about it for arbirary (number) fields.

Related to this is the proposed change #11905 to the function `_splitting_field` in the same file and the changes on #11271.

Any reason why this is *not* a duplicate of #11905?
