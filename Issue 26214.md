With sphinx 1.8.1 we see quite a few


```
ApplicationError: Source directory and destination directory cannot be identical
```


coming out of Sphinx as they have chahnged the argument checking of the `Sphinx` constructor it seems.

It would be nice to be more friendly to downstream by making Sage work better with Sphinx 1.8 already.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/26451

I was fearing that you would propose that ;)

I am not planning on working on upgrading Sphinx in Sage (as I've got too many other things to worry about.) I don't know what has chahnged in 1.8.1 and whether we would want to upgrade at all.

More generally, I don't know what we're aiming for here. I feel we don't have enough people to keep Sage-the-distribution close to upstream most of the time so that's probably not what we should be aiming for?

That said, feel free to upgrade Sphinx :) But if anybody likes these small changes and we want to move the Sphinx upgrade into a separate ticket, I would prefer that.

Once upon a time `sphinxify` was a part of sagenb and it was used in sage itself. So time ago we put an end to that. May be it is time to go in reverse and have (the now deprecated) sagenb use sage's sphinxify.

Indeed, `local/share/doc/sage/html/en/reference/_static` is a file, not a directory: it is the file `graphviz.css` from Sphinx. If I delete it, create a directory `_static`, and run `make` again, then only `graphviz.css` is copied to the directory, so the reference manual is missing all of its css files. The other parts of the documentation look good.

Then it also gets copied to a similar location in the html build. I commented out `'sphinx.ext.graphviz'` in the list of extensions in `src/doc/common/conf.py` and started over, but the same thing happened. So something strange is going on with graphviz and our custom builder for the reference manual. In contrast, `./sage --docbuild tutorial html` works fine.

That's very helpful, thank you, but it leads to my next problem: with that fix applied, `graphviz.css` is still copied to `local/share/doc/sage/inventory/en/reference/_static/`, and there is no reason to copy css files to the inventory build. As a consequence, I see this error:

```
Building reference manual, second pass.

[arithgrou] WARNING: failed to reach any of the inventories with the following issues:

```

I think intersphinx looks in every subdirectory of `inventory/en/reference/`, including `_static`, which should not be there.

If I use some sort of stupid patch on graphviz.py, then Sphinx crashes when it reaches the second pass, because of the reason you point out: `html/en/reference/_static` does not exist, but there are symlinks pointing to it. If I then manually create this directory (which we could add to the code), the docbuild still fails:

```
WARNING: search index couldn't be loaded, but not all documents will be built: the index will be incomplete.
```

There is a method in sphinx.builders.html called `load_indexer`, and for reasons I don't understand, it is not finding all of the relevant files: its input is two lists, the files it thinks it should include, and the files covered by the index, and if they are not the same, it raises this warning. I added some print statements to see how these two sets differed, and I couldn't see any pattern. When I disable that warning, it gets much farther, but I'm guessing that something will be broken with either the documentation or the index.

The point here is that the inventory builder is Sage-specific, and that's where the problem lies. So patching graphviz.py to deal with the inventory builder is okay (in my opinion) and would not make sense to report upstream. It looks like we can deal with it differently, though: rather than preventing graphviz.py from populating `_static` directories, we can remove them in the cleanup stage of the inventory build.

I don't see this with sage-the-distro. The file `doc/common/conf.py` had its doctests changed recently in another ticket (to fix Python 3 issues, I think). This branch doesn't touch that file, and I don't see why it would be related.

Instead of adding this very sage specific patch to sphinx, why not do this in a sphinx extension?

There is a balance to be struck: we're more or less forking Sphinx with extensions like this, so they require maintenance: as Sphinx changes, so should the extension. This recently required a fair amount of work for Sage's autodoc extension (#26949).

So is it better to patch Sphinx or create an extension?

From a packagers standpoint the extension is clearly better. Since the sphinx patch does not make much sense for us we would probably have to keep patching in the extension anyway. But I thought that was obvious and you were asking for opinions of sage developers.
