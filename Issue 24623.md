# Issue 24623: Building brial should use -std=gnu++11 on Cygwin

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24860

Original creator: embray

Original creation time: 2018-02-27 17:00:28

Keywords: brial

This is similar to #24192. On my Cygwin brial actually builds fine with `-std=c++11`, but one person [reported a problem with this](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/iMN3N7pqrq8/xNuNOWZfCgAJ), and that using `-std=gnu+11` fixed it.  It's not clear if this was due to an older version of Cygwin, or if this is a regression in newer Cygwins, but since at least one person was affected it's worth applying the workaround I think.

Changing priority from minor to critical.

I did some digging and it seems this affects Cygwin installs newer than mine, so we should definitely get this fixed then.

Given that this only affects Cygwin, I'll happily give this positive review.
