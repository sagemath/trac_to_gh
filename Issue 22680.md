OK, this is the update. Note that it needed an update of the Cygwin patch, thus a review on Cygwin is most appreciated.

I am OK with this if the cygwin patch is appropriate.

The cygwin patch update looks ok form a functional point of view but looses a tiny piece of info stuffed into the patch.

In fact the patch should not be necessary anymore:
* https://github.com/madler/zlib/issues/45
Please remove it.

It should still be nice to test it on Cygwin, `@`eric: can you do it?

I haven't tested it yet, but I don't imagine it will be a problem.  It would be nicer though if we could use the system zlib.  I'm working up a proposal for how to enable that more generally...

Sure but as you say, it's a wider and different issue.
