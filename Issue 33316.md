# Issue 33316: README Build from Source: m4 (step 5) is needed to run `make configure` (step 3)

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33553

Original creator: slabbe

Original creation time: 2022-03-24 08:32:57

In the current README (https://gitlab.com/sagemath/sage/-/blob/develop/README.md), in the `Instructions to Build from Source` section, it says at step 3 to:

```
3. [Git] If you cloned the Sage repository using git, bootstrap the
source tree using:

$ make configure
```


On a bare debian linux version, the above fails becaue of the absence of `m4`.

The installation of `m4` is suggested only at step 5:


```
5. [Linux, Cygwin] Install the required minimal build prerequisites.


Compilers: gcc, gfortran, g++ (a recent enough matching
set of these three will avoid building Sage-specific compilers).
See the Installation Manual for a discussion of suitable compilers.


Build tools: GNU make, GNU m4, perl (including
ExtUtils::MakeMaker), ranlib, git, tar, bc.


Python 3.4 or later, or Python 2.7, a full installation including
urllib; but ideally version 3.7.x, 3.8.x, or 3.9.x, which will
avoid having to build Sage's own copy of Python 3.
```

The change `9.` to `10.` needed to remove one space. I added a commit to fix this in case this changes the layout (I have more experience with !ReST than with markdown, so I don't know).
