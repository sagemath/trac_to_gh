Done this. If `Lats` is a list of all 10-element lattices, then the time for


```
sum(1 for L in Lats if L.is_uniform())
```


drops from 26 seconds to 9 seconds with this patch.

No, for example testing for semimodularity is faster that testing for modularity. But of course one can always test for a stronger property to get sure "yes"-answer, test for a weaker property to get sure "no"-answer, and only when needed to proceed testing the original property.
