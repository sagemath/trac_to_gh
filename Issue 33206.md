# Issue 33206: slow doctest improvements (isogeny_small_degree, function_field, doctest/test.py)

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33443

Original creator: tornaria

Original creation time: 2022-03-01 21:10:06

CC:  mjo

In this ticket we add some improvements for slow doctests in files that used to take more than 200s for --long. Also mark some tests as long so the file runs fast in not long mode.

 - isogeny_small_degree: the worst part is already fixed by 33293.
 - function_field: save 100s by tuning down number of repetitions.
 - doctests/test: this one spawns `sage-runtests` a lot of times to test, by tuning the cmdline this takes 1s less for each without compromising the test. Also improve the time it takes to test `die_timeout` by making it adjustable on the cmdline.

Very helpful, thanks. I have only two minor comments. First, in `doctests/test.py`, we see the pattern


```python
["sage", "-t", "--warn-long", "0", "--random-seed=0", "--optional=sage", ...]
```


over and over again. It might be easier to put those in a `common_args` variable at the top or something like that. But the same was true before you touched the file. Second, I don't really find these comments useful,


```
sage: K.<x> = FunctionField(QQ)
sage: TestSuite(K).run()               # long time (3s)
```


because they're in wall time. On my machine,


```
sage: K.<x> = FunctionField(QQ)
sage: %time TestSuite(K).run()
CPU times: user 12 s, sys: 0 ns, total: 12 s
Wall time: 12 s
```


But I don't violently object to seeing those numbers; I just don't really think they help anyone due to the unavoidable variation.

```
sage -t --long --warn-long 50.7 --random-seed=123 src/sage/doctest/forker.py  # 5 doctests failed
sage -t --long --warn-long 50.7 --random-seed=123 src/sage/doctest/control.py  # 6 doctests failed
```

Sorry, this even failed in a later patchbot run but for some reason it's still showing me the first gear badge that was for something completely unrelated.

I'm sorry Volker, this was totally my fault.

I forgot to `git add` one line. It turns out it's not enough to add the default for `die_timeout` in the argument parser in `src/bin/sage-runtests`. It also has to be added in `sage.doctest.control.DocTestDefaults()` since doctests run tests without going through `sage-runtests`.

When I pushed this I was trapped by #33473 which broke doctesting in all my boxes so I wasn't running full doctests, and I missed this, my bad.

I took the chance to tune up the die_timeout since I discovered that when pytest is installed, running `sage-runtest` (as done in `sage/doctests/test.py`) takes a ~3s overhead which breaks one doctest under the smaller die_timeout (we sleep 2s and test the process is still alive, but the 3s overhead means it's indeed dead), this would be unnecessary if #33531 is merged.

`@`mjo: this should be ok now, sorry for the lapse; could you re-review? I only added a small commit on top of what I had before. I tested this rebased on top of 9.5.beta5 (it merges cleanly).

Yeah no problem. The latest patchbot ran out of space and died so I'm going to build & test it myself (takes a while).
