The following is nonsense:

```
sage: IntegerModRing(Mod(4,5))
Ring of integers modulo 4
```

This is a problem:

```
sage: ZZ.coerce(4/2)
...
TypeError: no canonical coercion from Rational Field to Integer Ring
```

It is very likely that a user can accidentally have a rational, which looks like an integer, but it is not. Here, I think it should work smoothly for the rational case. We can special case this, but what about if we take a constant polynomial ring over `ZZ` (or over `QQ`)? That case is a lot more unlikely, but still within the realm possibility.

Jeroen is probably no longer around to defend his point of view.

Then let us keep only the non-controversial fixes where this was called in the code with non-integer arguments.

I have also pep8-cleaned the file integer_mod_ring
