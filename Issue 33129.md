# Issue 33129: BipartiteGraph() fails to create graph from graph6 string

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33366

Original creator: @maxale

Original creation time: 2022-02-17 16:10:01

Calling `BipartiteGraph('Bo', format='graph6')` produces meaningless error:

`ValueError: if input format is graph6, then g6_string must be a string`.

Building a bipartite graph from a graph6 string is currently not supported. When the first input parameter is a string, it is considered as the name of a file in `alist` format.

```
sage: BipartiteGraph('Bo')
unable to open file <<Bo>>
Bipartite graph on 0 vertices
```

This can certainly be changed. Feel free to contribute.

I'm working on this!

I have submitted a commit. A few comments:
- I assumed that an alist file will always have the .txt extension. Is this assumption correct?
- The code associated with partitioning was just copied from another block within the same function. Is repeated code like this a problem? Would it be better to create a new function with the duplicate code, or maybe call `__init__()` again after parsing the graph6 string (I couldn't figure out how to elegantly do this).

I don't know if a list file always ends with `.txt`.
A solution could be to try to read a list file and in case of failure try to decode a graph6 string (or the other way around).

Yes, it might be a good idea to add a method to check if the input partition is valid.

Concerning your commit, I doubt it is working when a partition is given and check is false. Indeed, you use `left.intersection(data.neighbor_iterator(a))`  but `data` is a string. That's why doctesting all possible ways to use a method is very important.

A potential problem with this approach is a user might be intending to open an alist file, but has provided a wrong file name. The file fails to load, but the user gets an error related to a graph6 string, which might be confusing.

In my last commit, I didn't add a new method to avoid duplicate code since there aren't any long duplicate blocks anymore. Let me know if I'm wrong.

The patchbot reports an error:

```
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/graphs/bipartite_graph.py", line 301, in sage.graphs.bipartite_graph.BipartiteGraph
Failed example:
    B.left
Expected:
    {0, 1, 2}
Got:
    {0}
```


I'm not convinced by the method you have chosen to check if data is a file.
An alternative solution could be:

```
import os
alist_file = os.path.exists(data)
```

method `os.path.exists` returns `True` if the file exists and `False` otherwise.

an error reported by the patchbot is not due to this ticket and is fixed in #33628.

When you write a doctest on multiple lines, you must do like this (otherwise, we get an error):

```diff
-         sage: B = BipartiteGraph('F?^T_\n', partition=[[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5, 6]], 
-                            check=False)
+         sage: B = BipartiteGraph('F?^T_\n', partition=[[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5, 6]], 
+         ....:                    check=False)
```

or simpler

```diff
+         sage: B = BipartiteGraph('F?^T_\n', partition=[[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5, 6]], check=False)
```

the 80 columns limitation is for comments and documentation, not for doctests (see how its done in other files).

You have certainly seen this doctest

```
    #. From an alist file::

         sage: file_name = os.path.join(SAGE_TMP, 'deleteme.alist.txt')
         sage: fi = open(file_name, 'w')
         sage: _ = fi.write("7 4 \n 3 4 \n 3 3 1 3 1 1 1 \n 3 3 3 4 \n\
                             1 2 4 \n 1 3 4 \n 1 0 0 \n 2 3 4 \n\
                             2 0 0 \n 3 0 0 \n 4 0 0 \n\
                             1 2 3 0 \n 1 4 5 0 \n 2 4 6 0 \n 1 2 4 7 \n")
         sage: fi.close()
         sage: B = BipartiteGraph(file_name)
         sage: B.is_isomorphic(H)
         True
```

which is ok as it feeds a string.

dcoudert, Thank you for clarifying the newline thing! The developer docs mentions using `...:`, but I saw some cases without it in the doctests, so I was kinda confused. It's clear now! Maybe something to add to the developer documentation, in case anyone else is confused.

For me it's ok now. Thank you.

Cool! Any reason why the Status badges shows "Build & Test" as failing? I've look at the failed builds on Github, but can't figure out what's wrong.

Comment by dcoudert created at 2022-04-03 07:21:39

There might be an error somewhere not related at all to this ticket. We have plenty of random doctests.
