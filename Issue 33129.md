Building a bipartite graph from a graph6 string is currently not supported. When the first input parameter is a string, it is considered as the name of a file in `alist` format.

I have submitted a commit. A few comments:
- I assumed that an alist file will always have the .txt extension. Is this assumption correct?
- The code associated with partitioning was just copied from another block within the same function. Is repeated code like this a problem? Would it be better to create a new function with the duplicate code, or maybe call `__init__()` again after parsing the graph6 string (I couldn't figure out how to elegantly do this).

I don't know if a list file always ends with `.txt`.
A solution could be to try to read a list file and in case of failure try to decode a graph6 string (or the other way around).

Yes, it might be a good idea to add a method to check if the input partition is valid.

Concerning your commit, I doubt it is working when a partition is given and check is false. Indeed, you use `left.intersection(data.neighbor_iterator(a))`  but `data` is a string. That's why doctesting all possible ways to use a method is very important.

I'm not convinced by the method you have chosen to check if data is a file.
An alternative solution could be:

```
import os
alist_file = os.path.exists(data)
```

method `os.path.exists` returns `True` if the file exists and `False` otherwise.

```

an error reported by the patchbot is not due to this ticket and is fixed in #33628.

When you write a doctest on multiple lines, you must do like this (otherwise, we get an error):

```diff
-         sage: B = BipartiteGraph('F?^T_\n', partition=[[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5, 6]], 
-                            check=False)
+         sage: B = BipartiteGraph('F?^T_\n', partition=[[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5, 6]], 
+         ....:                    check=False)
```

or simpler

```diff
+         sage: B = BipartiteGraph('F?^T_\n', partition=[[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5, 6]], check=False)
```

the 80 columns limitation is for comments and documentation, not for doctests (see how its done in other files).

You have certainly seen this doctest

```
    #. From an alist file::

         sage: file_name = os.path.join(SAGE_TMP, 'deleteme.alist.txt')
         sage: fi = open(file_name, 'w')
         sage: _ = fi.write("7 4 \n 3 4 \n 3 3 1 3 1 1 1 \n 3 3 3 4 \n\
                             1 2 4 \n 1 3 4 \n 1 0 0 \n 2 3 4 \n\
                             2 0 0 \n 3 0 0 \n 4 0 0 \n\
                             1 2 3 0 \n 1 4 5 0 \n 2 4 6 0 \n 1 2 4 7 \n")
         sage: fi.close()
         sage: B = BipartiteGraph(file_name)
         sage: B.is_isomorphic(H)
         True
```

which is ok as it feeds a string.
