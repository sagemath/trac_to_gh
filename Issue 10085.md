This was reported via the "Report a Problem" link:

When I try the following:

```
S1 = LazyPowerSeriesRing(ZZ)
S2 = LazyPowerSeriesRing(S1)

t = S1.term(1, 1) # same results with t = S1.gen()
tt = S2(t)
tt.coefficient(0)
```

this yields 0. Trying

```
tt.aorder
```

I get 1.

The series tt is the series with constant term equal to t, so its order should be zero and its 0th coefficient should be t.
