This was reported via the "Report a Problem" link:

When I try the following:

```
S1 = LazyPowerSeriesRing(ZZ)
S2 = LazyPowerSeriesRing(S1)

t = S1.term(1, 1) # same results with t = S1.gen()
tt = S2(t)
tt.coefficient(0)
```

this yields 0. Trying

```
tt.aorder
```

I get 1.

The series tt is the series with constant term equal to t, so its order should be zero and its 0th coefficient should be t.

This works now, since #32367.

There is also almost surely an implicit test for this too.
