# Issue 20116: Uncouple documentation builder from sagenb

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20353

Original creator: jdemeyer

CC:  hivert

The file `src/sage/misc/sagedoc.py` imports `sphinxify` from sagenb. This is bad, since sagenb should not be a dependency for the Sage documentation.

I think this could use one more change: 

```diff
diff --git a/src/doc/en/reference/misc/index.rst b/src/doc/en/reference/misc/index.rst
index 3fcd5b0..10a0a1d 100644

Then I think it's ready to go.
