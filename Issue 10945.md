After taking a look at the SparseGraph backend, it looks like some time is actually spent obtaining the list of neighbors. This patch caches so that the out_neighbors method does not have to be called so often.

I had set this patch to "needs review", as I was wondering why Cython was apparently slower than a C code I had written independently. Turns out the different lies in how the vertices of the 2d grid (which is the graph on which I was testing the performances) were labelled. 

In the C code, they were labelled from left to right, then from top to bottom, why Sage's numbering is much more random, hence different performances in practice.

Hail Cython `;-)`
