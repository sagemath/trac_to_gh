`sage -i autotools` results in this error. In a parallel build, one is left with a nondeterministic collection of installed autotools versions.

#21063 adds the required xz package.
But next it runs into a problem with the old gm4 on Mac OS X.

```

An unrelated issue with autotools that should be fixed as well. 
The package should actually install links "aclocal-VERSION" and "automake-VERSION" (actually `am__api_version`) to `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin`. For example, 1.14.1 and 1.14 have the same `am__api_version` (1.14). So we need to pick the better one I guess. 

(This is so that maintainer-mode Makefile targets which call automake work. )

What's this???

```
# System m4 from Mac OS X 10.11.5 is too old to bootstrap libtool 1.4.3
export M4="$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/m4"
```


That `m4` should be the first one found in the `$PATH`, so I really do not see the point.

The configure script prefers "gm4" to "m4". That's why this is necessary.

Please add this sentence to a comment in the patch (possibly with some more explanation) and refer to this ticket.

This is done now.

I have also fixed the installation of libtool's `ltversion.m4`, which was missing the serial number (`.serial`), causing the following warning. 

```
m4/ltversion.m4:12: warning: ill-formed serial number 'ltversion.m4', expecting a version string with only digits and dots
```

It now works fine for me.
Needs review.

Style question: why did you change this part?

```
sed 's/^/\t/;' <<EOF
cd $p-$v && ${bootstrap}\\
    ./configure --prefix="\$(SAGE_LOCAL)/$p-$v" && \\
    \$\$MAKE && \$\$MAKE install
# Remove all files except for the .* files
[ "\$\$SAGE_KEEP_BUILT_SPKGS" = yes ] || rm -rf $p-$v/*
EOF
```

I thought it was a very nice way to not have to write too many backslashes....

I think that `spkg-write-makefile` needs more documentation. All the changes that you did are non-trivial and should be documented better. What does `# Fix up for wrong prereq.` mean for example?

Unfortunately using '\t' only works with GNU sed, not with the traditional sed that is available on Mac OS X.
(See commit message).

> I think that `spkg-write-makefile` needs more documentation. All the changes that you did are non-trivial and should be documented better. 

OK, I'll add some.

> What does `# Fix up for wrong prereq.` mean for example?

It's a fix for an automake version that has a too low autoconf requirement listed in its source.
I believe in the current spkg, someone must have fixed this by hand-editing the `Makefile.build`.

Also: please remove this:

```
+	    # Could instead compute the .serial at "make" time:
+	    #echo -e "\tif test ! -f \"$p-$v/.serial\"; then ( cd \$(SRC)/$p && git log --pretty=oneline $tag ) |wc -l | sed 's|[\t ]||g ' > $p-$v/.serial ; fi"
```

It's only confusing...

Have you tested this version on OS X? I can test Linux but not OS X.

Why do you need the `.serial` files?

See comment 14 - it's also explained in the comment that I added to `spkg-write-makefile`

Well, that comment only explains why that file is missing. Not why it is needed.
