Apparently pymongo uses a getattr hack that claims to have all and every method implemented, and then fails flat on its face when you actually try. This breaks the new displayhook.

Note that this error will just appear if you (implicitly) call the displayhook. Pymongo is working just fine, only the implicit printing is broken:

Where do you get pymongo from? It is not in standard packages and it is not even in optional packages.

> Where do you get pymongo from? It is not in standard packages and it is not even in optional packages.

You get it like this:

```
sage -sh
<different prompt> easy_install -U pymongo
(exit)
```


I am using it for a project which uses Sage as a backend to a big number theory database, see http://www.lmfdb.org/ and the readme at https://github.com/LMFDB/lmfdb/wiki/GettingGoing .

With the new patch all tests pass for me: both my manual test with pymongo, and a full test of the whole library.

Note to Release Manager: it is OK not to have a doctest showing that the problem is fixed since the original problem only arises when pymongo has been installed and the machine has a running mongo daemon.  I was the original reporter, and "it works for me".

As soon as Volker sets the tciket to "needs review" I'll give it a positive review.
