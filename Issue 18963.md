LGTM (slight shame on me since I made some of these typos...).

there still a typo in 

```
+++ b/src/sage/calculus/desolvers.py
`@``@` -1116,7 +1116,7 `@``@` def desolve_rk4(de, dvar, ics=None, ivar=None, end_points=None, step=0.1, output
 
       - ``de`` - equation, including term with ``diff(y,x)``
 
-      - ``dvar``` - dependent variable (declared as funciton of independent variable)
+      - ``dvar``` - dependent variable (declared as function of independent variable)
```

namely, an extra !` after dvar`.

I had the branch already merged. I suggest you wait a week to see if you find anything else.

ok, sorry for having done something on a positive-reviewed ticket. I tried to be quick, but not enough. I will do as you suggest.
