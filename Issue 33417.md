I see welcome coding style fixes in this branch, but no changes to the documentation that  the ticket description promises

I saw another typo in `real_set.py` around line 900. 

```
sage: I02 = manifolds.OpenInterval(0, 2); I
I
sage: RealSet(I02)
```

`I` should read `I02`.

Fixed typo at `line 900 src/sage/sets/real_set.py`:

```
sage: I02 = manifolds.OpenInterval(0, 2); I02
sage: I02
Real interval (0, 2)
sage: RealSet(I02)
(0, 2)
```

Typo at `line 4360 src/sage/geometry/lattice_polytope.py`:

```
"polytopes ony! 
"polytopes only!"
```



Typo at `line 1036 src/sage/geometry/polyhedron/combinatorial_polyhedron/face_iterator.pyx`:

```
"However, the result is not necesarrily well-defined." 
"However, the result is not necessarily well-defined. "
```


Typo at `line 33 src/sage/geometry/polyhedron/combinatorial_polyhedron/polyhedron_face_lattice.pxd`:

```
# walks trough faces of incidence_dim_one
# walks through faces of incidence_dim_one
```

Also fixed python code style in `src/sage/geometry/polyhedron` and `src/sage/sets/real_set.py`

Build Test, and build documentation fail due to the #ticket3321 fail #33212 in my laptop with Apple M1 chip and macOS Big Sur Version 11.4
