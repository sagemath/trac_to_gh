```
sage: I02 = manifolds.OpenInterval(0, 2); I02
sage: I02
Real interval (0, 2)

Typo at `line 4360 src/sage/geometry/lattice_polytope.py`:

```
"polytopes ony! 
"polytopes only!"

Typo at `line 1036 src/sage/geometry/polyhedron/combinatorial_polyhedron/face_iterator.pyx`:

```

Typo at `line 33 src/sage/geometry/polyhedron/combinatorial_polyhedron/polyhedron_face_lattice.pxd`:

```
# walks trough faces of incidence_dim_one
# walks through faces of incidence_dim_one
```

Also fixed python code style in `src/sage/geometry/polyhedron` and `src/sage/sets/real_set.py`
