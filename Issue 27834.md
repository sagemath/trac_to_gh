Currently we cannot calculate the global height of an element that is not already an explicit element of QQ, QQbar, or NumberField. For example,


```
P.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(AlgebraicRealField(), 1)
Q = P(10)
Q.global_height()
```


currently fails, when we should be able to calculate the global heights for a point in any field that can be embedded into QQbar. We use coercion to QQbar in the global_heights function to solve this problem. There are also numerous instances in the projective_ds file where a check is made on the base field for the sole purpose of safely calling the global_height() function. We have removed these checks in favor of a single check in the global_height function.

Two questions here:

1) Can the new ``except'' trap a specific error?

2) It would be better if the example had elements actually in the field you are defining instead of just over QQ.
