CC:  dimpase

Added three families of distance regular graphs, they are based, respectively, on bilinear forms, alternating forms and hermitian forms.

Also moved `AztecDiamondGraph` to families of graphs rather than basic structures.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30312

Yes, I've changed it and also merged #30303 (with the update to 9.2.beta8).
If #29886 will take too much time, I could remove the dependency and generate the needed matrices with the `...FormsGraph` method.
This is what I initially did ages ago.

Of course as soon as #29886 or something similar gets fixed, I can change back these functions to something neater.

As you are on the forms graph here, let's add the missing case of the symmetric 3x3 forms graph, as
discussed in [BCN] corrections: https://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/drg/ch9

For $n = 3$ we find a distance-regular graph with intersection array

Having the latter should allow a more economic definition of the Hermitian case, as a product of the symmetric forms graph over GF(r) and alternating forms graph over GF(r).

It's the product, in the sense that vertices are pairs, 2 vertices (a,b) and (c,d) are adjacent iff 
rk(a-c+i(b-d))=1, where i is a generator of GF(q) over GF(r).
(If I'm not mistaken, rk(a-c+i(b-d))=1 may be expressed as "either rk(a-c)+rk(b-d)<2, or
rk(a-c)=rk(b-d)=1, Ker(a-c)=Ker(b-d).)

I think these graphs have the same intersection array of the Brouwer-Pasechnik graph (https://arxiv.org/abs/1107.0475).
You definitely know if I'm wrong.

The construction given for that graph is easy and works in O(E), so I chose that one over the symmetric matrices one.
Of course we could have both if you wish.

in fact, yes, sure, https://arxiv.org/abs/1107.0475 points out to https://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/drg/ch9 and discusses the relation between the two. There is something with q being even or odd there, so beware of details.

at the moment `graphs.HermitianFormsGraph(2,9)` is horribly slow. 

E.g. it could in part be due to slowness in computing the below-diagonal part. Taking to `r`-th power is perhaps the worst possible way to compute the map in question. Instead, choose `i` as above, compute `i`<sup>r</sup> (once), then for a,b in GF(r) one has (a+ib)<sup>r</sup>= a+i<sup>r</sup>b.

Another place is rank 1 Hermitian matrices. Each such nxn matrix has form vv<sup>*</sup>, for v in GF(q)<sup>n</sup>,
and * denoting the map induced by taking to r-th power. So no need to compute ranks and filter on rank 1.

I use integers only in `matricesOverq` and the encoding is given by `Fqelems` which maps integers to elements of GF(q).
The inverse GF(q) -> Int is not needed but it is given by `toInt = {n: x for n, x in enumerate(Fqelems)}`.
All arithmetic is done with elements of GF(q). The integers are only used to speed up the iteration `for m1 in matricesOverq`.
