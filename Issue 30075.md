CC:  @dimpase

Added three families of distance regular graphs, they are based, respectively, on bilinear forms, alternating forms and hermitian forms.

Also moved `AztecDiamondGraph` to families of graphs rather than basic structures.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30312

Yes, I've changed it and also merged #30303 (with the update to 9.2.beta8).
If #29886 will take too much time, I could remove the dependency and generate the needed matrices with the `...FormsGraph` method.
This is what I initially did ages ago.

Of course as soon as #29886 or something similar gets fixed, I can change back these functions to something neater.

As you are on the forms graph here, let's add the missing case of the symmetric 3x3 forms graph, as
discussed in [BCN] corrections: https://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/drg/ch9

```
For $n = 3$ we find a distance-regular graph with intersection array
$"{"q sup 3 -1 , q sup 3 -q , q sup 3 -q sup 2 + 1 ;~ 1,q,q sup 2 -1"}"$
(in the diagram on p. 286, merge the balloons for the forms of rank 3 and
the alternating forms of rank 2).

Having the latter should allow a more economic definition of the Hermitian case, as a product of the symmetric forms graph over GF(r) and alternating forms graph over GF(r).

It's the product, in the sense that vertices are pairs, 2 vertices (a,b) and (c,d) are adjacent iff 
rk(a-c+i(b-d))=1, where i is a generator of GF(q) over GF(r).
(If I'm not mistaken, rk(a-c+i(b-d))=1 may be expressed as "either rk(a-c)+rk(b-d)<2, or
rk(a-c)=rk(b-d)=1, Ker(a-c)=Ker(b-d).)

I think these graphs have the same intersection array of the Brouwer-Pasechnik graph (https://arxiv.org/abs/1107.0475).
You definitely know if I'm wrong.

The construction given for that graph is easy and works in O(E), so I chose that one over the symmetric matrices one.
Of course we could have both if you wish.

I'll still try this construction. Could you clarify what you mean by "a generator of GF(q) over GF(r)"?
Do you mean $i \in GF(q)$ s.t. $i$ generated $GF(q) / GF(r)$ as vector spaces over $GF(r)$?

in fact, yes, sure, https://arxiv.org/abs/1107.0475 points out to https://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/drg/ch9 and discusses the relation between the two. There is something with q being even or odd there, so beware of details.

at the moment `graphs.HermitianFormsGraph(2,9)` is horribly slow. 

E.g. it could in part be due to slowness in computing the below-diagonal part. Taking to `r`-th power is perhaps the worst possible way to compute the map in question. Instead, choose `i` as above, compute `i`<sup>r</sup> (once), then for a,b in GF(r) one has (a+ib)<sup>r</sup>= a+i<sup>r</sup>b.

Another place is rank 1 Hermitian matrices. Each such nxn matrix has form vv<sup>*</sup>, for v in GF(q)<sup>n</sup>,
and * denoting the map induced by taking to r-th power. So no need to compute ranks and filter on rank 1.

I use integers only in `matricesOverq` and the encoding is given by `Fqelems` which maps integers to elements of GF(q).
The inverse GF(q) -> Int is not needed but it is given by `toInt = {n: x for n, x in enumerate(Fqelems)}`.

by the way, nothing prevents you from trying to use the meataxe backend for matrices, and falling back on the default one if it's not available.
