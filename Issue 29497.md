`shortest_path_lengths` method in `generic_graph.py` makes self.weighted=True, when called with Dijkstra_Boost or `Bellman-Ford_Boost` See the code below


```
sage: G = graphs.PathGraph(7)
sage: G.weighted()
False
sage: G.shortest_path_lengths(0,algorithm='Dijkstra_Boost')
{0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3, 4: 4, 5: 5, 6: 6}
sage: G.weighted()
True
```
