This avoids a nasty import at startup of `matrix.matrix_space` in polynomial rings. Instead of importing `MatrixSpace`, we take it from `sage.all`. This is needed for #24742.

LGTM, but what about making the (default, since there is a method to override it...) threshold an attribute of the base ring instead?

Because this is happening at Sage startup time. So `sage.all.MatrixSpace` may not exist yet.

```
try:
   threshold = base_ring._karatsuba_threshold
except AttributeError:
    threshold = 0
```

that would not depend on some startup effect.

I don't know. Would it be a problem to have such a method (or a simple attribute) either in the category of rings or even in `Parent`?
