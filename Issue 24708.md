# Issue 24708: Avoid importing matrices in polynomial rings

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24945

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2018-03-11 09:05:18

This avoids a nasty import at startup of `matrix.matrix_space` in polynomial rings. Instead of importing `MatrixSpace`, we take it from `sage.all`. This is needed for #24742.

LGTM, but what about making the (default, since there is a method to override it...) threshold an attribute of the base ring instead?

Why is there a need for a try/except here!?

Because this is happening at Sage startup time. So `sage.all.MatrixSpace` may not exist yet.

This is very bad. I am very much in favor of something like Marc suggested

```
try:
   threshold = base_ring._karatsuba_threshold
except AttributeError:
    threshold = 0
```

that would not depend on some startup effect.

Hmm, adding that to all possible base rings seems strange. I would much rather do it depending on the element class. For example, generic polynomials would not use Karatsuba, but polynomials over `ZZ` would.

I'm thinking of something like

```
        # element class determines default Karatsuba threshold
        self._Karatsuba_threshold = self.Element._default_karatsuba_threshold(base_ring)
```

As far as I understand, the goal is not to decide whether to use Karatsuba, but when the _generic_ multiplication code should switch from the schoolbook algorithm to Karatsuba. This depends on the base ring (or _its_ element class): basically, the more expensive multiplication is compared to addition, the lower the threshold should be. And yes, I guess most base rings wouldn't need to override the default value.

But we have really a lot of possible base rings in Sage. Should they all get a `_default_karatsuba_threshold()` method?

A different solution is to use a `lazy_attribute` instead for `_Karatsuba_threshold`. That might solve the startup problem.

I don't know. Would it be a problem to have such a method (or a simple attribute) either in the category of rings or even in `Parent`?

I went with the simple solution of using a `lazy_attribute`.
