Assignee: @aghitza

Keywords: parentheses, multivariate polynomial, finite field

We have

```
sage: F.<a>=GF(9)
sage: R.<x,y>=F[]
sage: a*x+1
(a)*x + 1
```
There, clearly the parentheses around `a` are unnecessary. In the univariate case, the phenomenon does not appear:

```
sage: S.<s>=F[]
sage: a*s+1
a*s + 1
```
