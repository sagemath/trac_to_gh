# Issue 23598: Replace Maxima with Pynac/Singular in Expression.factor()

Issue created by migration from Trac.

The default for symbolic factorization should be changed. Maxima as default should be replaced with a call to Pynac's `factor()` implementation, which itself uses Singular at the moment. Maxima should be made available via `ex.factor(algorithm=...)`.

If you rebase this to 8.4.beta0, I will review it.

Sorry, due to other work I'm restricting my activities to maintaining Pynac and its upgrade tickets.

No problem. It ended up being a trivial rebase. So I am treating this ticket as a needs_review.

While I do not see as big of a speed difference (9.5s to 3.2s), it still is quite an improvement. So positive review.

See #27304 for a follow up (bug in factorization of exponentials).
