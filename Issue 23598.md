The default for symbolic factorization should be changed. Maxima as default should be replaced with a call to Pynac's `factor()` implementation, which itself uses Singular at the moment. Maxima should be made available via `ex.factor(algorithm=...)`.

No problem. It ended up being a trivial rebase. So I am treating this ticket as a needs_review.

While I do not see as big of a speed difference (9.5s to 3.2s), it still is quite an improvement. So positive review.
