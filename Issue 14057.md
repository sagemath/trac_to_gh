Hey Brant,

I've uploaded a new version of the patch which reworks the implementation to follow the `WithRealizations` API and deprecates the `IwahoriHeckeAlgebraT` class. If it wasn't ready for review, I think it now is.

Best,

Travis

* Having just said that the code is 'the same' in terms of caching it would be better to implement the C'-basis using the observation that C_x' = \alpha(C_x), where \alpha is the Z-linear ring automorphism of the Hecke algebra which sends q^1/2} ^to -q<sup>-1/2</sup> and T<sub>x</sub> to (-1)<sup>\ell(x)</sup>q<sup>-1/2\ell(x)</sup>T<sub>x</sub>.

I've just looked into the patch to see how algebras with multiple bases are implemented; I don't really know (or care much, by now) about Hecke algebras. I've uploaded a few superficial docstring fixes.

An issue I'm not fixing but you might want to ponder about are the docstrings of `bar(self)` and `hecke_involution(self)`. They pretend that these methods send the deformation variable `q` to `q^(-1)` (or `q^(1/2)` to `q^(-1/2)`, which is more or less the same).

So if the deformation variable is, say, `2t`, then `t` is sent to `t^(-1)`, not `2t` to `(2t)^(-1)`. I don't know in how far this issue will pop up in real life, but here's an example:


```
sage: W.<t> = LaurentPolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: H = IwahoriHeckeAlgebra(['A',3], 2*t)
sage: T = H.T()                            
sage: T1,T2,T3 = T.algebra_generators()    
sage: T1.bar()                             
(1/2*t^-1)*T1 + (-1+1/2*t^-1)
sage: (t*T1).bar()
(1/2*t^-2)*T1 + (-t^-1+1/2*t^-2)
```

    "body": "Hey Darij,\n\nThanks for looking over the documentation. As for the `q`, in order to do what you're suggesting means we have to do all computations in a formal variable and then specialize. However I don't think this is the correct behavior, especially when `q` is a root of unity, but I don't know if the bar involution is still useful at specialized `q`. The problem in my mind is take `q = 2` and consider the element `2`, what is the bar of this, does it matter if it's `1 + 1` or `2 in ZZ` or suppose to be the `q`?\n\nAndrew, Dan, Brant, or someone who understands Hecke algebras better than myself, do you have any thoughts on this?

Thanks for looking over the documentation. As for the `q`, in order to do what you're suggesting means we have to do all computations in a formal variable and then specialize. However I don't think this is the correct behavior, especially when `q` is a root of unity, but I don't know if the bar involution is still useful at specialized `q`. The problem in my mind is take `q = 2` and consider the element `2`, what is the bar of this, does it matter if it's `1 + 1` or `2 in ZZ` or suppose to be the `q`?

Andrew, Dan, Brant, or someone who understands Hecke algebras better than myself, do you have any thoughts on this? Also would any of you have time to do the last (math) review of this patch?

Best,

Travis

Hi Travis,

You're right, the only thing we can do with `2` is leave it fixed. So the implementation is right and the docstring is wrong: the only thing we can do is invert the indeterminates; inverting the deformation parameter doesn't in general work.

Given the issues that we're having in computing the KL bases I think that we need some basic tests like:

```
    sage: T(Cp(1))
    v^-1*Cp1 + v^-1
    sage: T(C(1))
    v^-1*Cp1 - v
    sage: C(Cp(1))
    C1 + (v+v^-1)
    sage: Cp(C(1))
    Cp1 + (-v-v^-1)
```

I think that there also should be long tests like:

```
    sage: forall( C(x)==C(T(x)) for x in W )
    true
    sage: forall( C(x)==C(Cp(x)) for x in W )
    true
    sage: forall( Cp(x)==Cp(T(x)) for x in W )
    true
    sage: forall( Cp(x)==Cp(C(x)) for x in W )
    true
```

where W is at least Sym(4) or of type B2 or ...

As there is an independent implementation of the KL-polys inside sage (I think???) it should also be possible to do something like:

```
    sage: T(Cp(x)) == v^-x.length()*sum( KLPoly(y,x)*T(y) for y in W)
```

Apologies but I don't know the right syntax here.

The correct way of doing this is to work with an indeterminant/formal variable to compute the KL-basis elements and then specialise. The bar involution really only makes sense when q is generic.

(Btw, I tried using H.inject_shorhands() but this just gave an error message.)

The syntax for defining the Hecke algebra itself also strikes me as being a little OTT:

Is there a way of simplifying this? For example, from memory chevie computes the KL bases internally using an indeterminant and then specialised back to the square root of the Hecke parameter.

Sage has two KL polynomial implementations. The other one is by Dan Bump:

```
            sage: W = WeylGroup("B3",prefix="s")
            sage: [s1,s2,s3]=W.simple_reflections()
            sage: R.<q>=LaurentPolynomialRing(QQ)

            sage: KL.P(s2,s3*s2*s3*s1*s2)
            q + 1
```

It is unlikely that both are wrong!

Hi Travis and Anne,

This is the first interesting KL-polynomial and the polynomial is `1+q=1+v^2`. So the result being returned by the basis code is correct and the result being returned by the KL.poly sum is wrong. The problem is that KL.P is returning a polynomial in `v` whereas in the sum we want a polynomial in `v^2`. So all that needs to be done to fix this is make KL.P return a polynomial in `v^2`.

I'm part way through writing a review patch. Mostly I have just been expanding on the documentation (and hopefully improving it). In particular, I have added Iwahori-Hecke algebras to the algebra chapter of the reference manual, as it didn't seem to exist anywhere else.

There is one significant issue that needs to be addressed: currently the code accepts two parameters `q1` and `q2` and defines the algebra with generators `{T_s|s\in S}` and relations `(T_s-q1)(T_s-q2)=0` together with the braid relations. I am unsure how to define the bar involution for such parameters. 

What the code currently does is invert all of the generators of the base ring. This is probably the right thing to do if `q1` and `q2` are powers of generators of the base ring -- although even this is not clear because we could have `q1=v^2` and but be working with the Hecke algebra over `Z[v,w]`, so that we would probably want `\bar[w}=w`. Of course, I can't image why one would ever want to do this...

A less extreme (and more natural), example is when `q1=a^2`, `q2=b^2` and `a` and `b` are not algebraically independent. In this case, this bar involuton on the base ring will almost never extend to a ring involution on te Hecke algebra.

What is cool about the current implementation is that it works correctly with parameters `(q1,q2)` being either `(v^2,-1)` or `(v,-v^-1)`. What is less cool is that it will be wrong in the senarious above and, more seriously, it gives incorrect answers when given parameters `(1,-1)` which corresponds to the group ring `ZW`:

```
sage: H = IwahoriHeckeAlgebra(['A',3], 1,1)  
sage: H.inject_shorthands()
Injecting C as shorthand for Iwahori-Hecke algebra of type A3 in 1,-1 over Integer Ring in the C basis
Injecting Cp as shorthand for Iwahori-Hecke algebra of type A3 in 1,-1 over Integer Ring in the Kazhdan-Lusztig basis
Injecting T as shorthand for Iwahori-Hecke algebra of type A3 in 1,-1 over Integer Ring in the standard basis
sage: T(Cp(1))
1
```


The underlying problem is that the bar involution really only makes sense in the generic case and currently there is no checking for this. On the other hand, the Kazhdan-Lusztig bases do make sense whenever the squre root of the prameters lives in the base ring as we can compute the KL bases over `Z[v,v^-1]` and then specialise `v^2` to `q`. In particular, the KL bases make sense for the integral groups rings `ZW`.

I can think of a couple of solutions:
* Leave everything as it is.
* Only allow the KL bases to be implemenetd in the generic case.
* Implement a generic Hecke algebra behind the scene and compute the KL basis here, together with transition matrices, and then specialise these results into the non-generic Hecke algebras whenever the square roots of the parameters are (testably) well-defined.

I don't like the first option because the current behaviour is mathematically incorrect in important examples. Nor do I like the second option because working with the KL bases of the group algebra is a natural thing to want to do. Therefore, I think that the last option is the way to go.

** Please let me know what you think. **

Here are a few other less important issues that I have come across:
* I am confused by the `one_basis` method of all of the bases: why does this return the identity element of the corresponding Coxeter group? Initially I thought that this would return the identity element of the Hecke algebra with respet to the current basis (which is implemented as`T.one()`). If we really need a shorthand for the identity element of the group shouldn't the method be called something like group_identity?
* Similarly, the method `is_field` strikes me as being strange: the Hecke algebra is a field if only if the Coxeter group has rank zero and the base ring is a field. Rather than being a method of the Hecke algebra this should be (and is) a method of the base ring of the Hecke algebra. 
* I think that the names for the bases are all too long to be useful and that something shorter like "X-basis of Iwahori-Hecke algebra"  or "X-basis of Iwahori-Hecke algebra of type Y" feasible? Compare these with:

```
Iwahori-Hecke algebra of type A3 in v^2,-1 over Univariate Laurent Polynomial Ring in v over Rational Field in the C basis
Iwahori-Hecke algebra of type A3 in v^2,-1 over Univariate Laurent Polynomial Ring in v over Rational Field in the Kazhdan-Lusztig basis
Iwahori-Hecke algebra of type A3 in v^2,-1 over Univariate Laurent Polynomial Ring in v over Rational Field in the standard basis
```


Unless anyone objects, in my review patch I will remove the `is_field` method, rename (or delete?) the `one_basis` method and shorten the basis names. 

In the bsence of better suggesstions I will also have a go at implementing a generic algebra in the background.

I'm slightly hesitant about option 3 (implementing a generic Hecke algebra), and it's probably due to my lack of expertise, but does it always work for specializing to roots of unity? Or do problems just arise with the representation theory? If it's okay, then I'm for option 3.

This is correct; it is suppose to return the index of basis element for the Hecke's algebra's (multiplicative) identity. It's something needed for `CombinatorialFreeModule` (at least, I'm pretty sure).

I don't like removing the base ring in the representation (the `Univariate Laurent Polynomial Ring in v over Rational Field` part) since it helps distinguish the Hecke algebras. The `in the X basis` part is a standard paradigm from other `WithRealization` objects such as symmetric functions.

> Thank you for reviewing this ticket Andrew.

Well, I haven't actually finished a review yet! Thanks for getting back to me.

> I'm slightly hesitant about option 3 (implementing a generic Hecke algebra), and it's probably due to my lack of expertise, but does it always work for specializing to roots of unity?

The KL bases are defined over `Z[q<sup>{1/2},q</sup>{-1/2}]` so you can specialise them to ANY ring provided these square roost exist. You can't, however, compute these bases over any ring becaue the bar involution will not be defined in general. Therefore, one really SHOULD compute them generically and then specialise.

To be explicit, the group ring `RW` of the Coxeter group has a well-defined KL basis for any ring `R`, however, you can't "see" the KL bases of `RW` inside the group ring. The only way to compute the KL bases or `RW` is to do it inside the generic Hecke algebra and then specialise. Notice also that even though the KL bases are defined for `RW` the bar involution is NOT defined on `RW`, so non-generic Hecke algebras should not have a method for the bar involution either.

The KL bases also work in the root of unity cases...it is more that no one has found a good use for them yet.

> This is correct [about `one_basis`]; it is suppose to return the index of basis element for the Hecke's algebra's (multiplicative) identity. It's something needed for `CombinatorialFreeModule`  (at least, I'm pretty sure).

I don't believe this. Combinaorial modules can be indexed anything so it seems unlikely that they would require something in the index set to be a multiplicative identity. In the code `one_basis` is used as a shortcut to get to things like `T(1)`.

> I'm not really opposed to removing it, but I'm thinking it should be in there for consistency (with perhaps modified behavior).

Is `is_field` a default method for an algebra? Most algebras are not fields so this struck me as being a strange question to ask mathematically. If you accept this then you should agree that it is a strange method for an algebra. (But perhaps it is just me who is strange!:)

> I don't like removing the base ring in the representation (the `Univariate Laurent Polynomial Ring in v over Rational Field`  part) since it helps distinguish the Hecke algebras. The `in the X basis`  part is a standard paradigm from other `WithRealization`  objects such as symmetric functions.

I agree that this could be useful but I always err on the side of readabiltly and ease of use.

I will try and incorporate some or all of the above into the review patch and get it back to you tomorrow (possibly optimistic). Going via the generic algebra turns out to be a minor rearrangement of code (I think), so it shoudn't be too hard - I hope!

I note the tense of the verb :P

Or do problems just arise with the representation theory? If it's okay, then I'm for option 3. Actually, that made me have another (scarier) thought, does anyone know if this works for fields of positive characteristic? If not or we don't know, I think we should put that in the documentation somewhere that we assume the base ring has characteristic 0.

You can't, however, compute these bases over any ring becaue the bar involution will not be defined in general. Therefore, one really SHOULD compute them generically and then specialise.

The only way to compute the KL bases or `RW` is to do it inside the generic Hecke algebra and then specialise. Notice also that even though the KL bases are defined for `RW` the bar involution is NOT defined on `RW`, so non-generic Hecke algebras should not have a method for the bar involution either.

Then I'm for it. I'm guessing we only would want the generic structure for the basis transitions and let the bar and Hecke involution methods fail as necessary (with proper documentation of course). I'd imagine that we shouldn't see too big (if any) of a speed penality doing it this way.

> I don't believe this. Combinaorial modules can be indexed anything so it seems unlikely that they would require something in the index set to be a multiplicative identity. In the code `one_basis` is used as a shortcut to get to things like `T(1)`.

It's useful in the `to_*_basis()` methods because their argument is given in terms of an indexing element. Only at one place in the code did `T(T.one_basis())` get used and could be turned into `T.one()`. If you're still thinking of changing this to `one()` (which you do need to implement otherwise), then we'll see if something else breaks (and you might consider asking Nicolas about it).

Since the class `Algebra` inherits from `Ring`, it does have this method. However the category `Rings`, which is a super-category of (unital, associative) `Algebras`, does not have an `is_field` method (I think because you're suppose to test it like `R in Fields()`, but don't quote me on that), so it's okay to remove it.

Now down the rabbit hole: as to it being strange, I don't have the experience to say. I do agree that most algebras are not fields, but then again, so are most rings. However isn't the fraction field of an algebra also an algebra?

> > I don't like removing the base ring in the representation (the `Univariate Laurent Polynomial Ring in v over Rational Field`  part) since it helps distinguish the Hecke algebras. The `in the X basis`  part is a standard paradigm from other `WithRealization`  objects such as symmetric functions.
>

IMO the string representations of parents are mainly used to remind us what they are or to identify them. Leaving off the base ring makes it harder to achieve this. If you're still wanting more readability, perhaps a global option is in order with the default being the more descriptive string (although we might need to be careful about the hash...)?

> I will try and incorporate some or all of the above into the review patch and get it back to you tomorrow (possibly optimistic). Going via the generic algebra turns out to be a minor rearrangement of code (I think), so it shoudn't be too hard - I hope!

I don't think it should be difficult. Thank you Andrew.

From the documentation of one_basis in AlgebrasWithBasis
(now in Algebras.Unital.WithBasis.ParentMethods.one_basis):

```
                When the one of an algebra with basis is an element of
                this basis, this optional method can return the index of
                this element. This is used to provide a default
                implementation of :meth:`.one`, and an optimized default
                implementation of :meth:`.from_base_ring`.

```


So just a little standard shortcut which furthermore gives the system
a bit of information that can be used for some optimizations.

Just a tiny bit of food for thoughts: In symmetric functions, we are
facing a similar issue when it comes to implementing the plethysm: one
needs to know which parameters in the ground field are of rank 1 (in
which case p_k(x)=x^k) or of rank 0 (in which case p_k(x)=x). And of
course specializing a rank 1 parameter to a complex number does not
play well with plethysm.

The approach we took in MuPAD-Combinat for this particular issue (and,
I think, should be implemented in Sage) is to have the user specify
explicitly what the plethysm does on the ground field, and this worked
pretty well.

In practice the user had to provide a glorified field with a plethysm
method. This was typically "ExpressionField" (roughly the equivalent
of Sage's symbolic ring) glorified as the facade parent
"ExpressionFieldWithDegreeOneElement(variables)" that added a
"plethysm" method which did an appropriate substitution on the
variables. See e.g. p. 4 of [1].


So one could imagine a similar approach where: if the user wants the
full featured Hecke algebra, (s)he would have to provide explicitly a
method implementing the bar involution on the ground field (assuming
of course it actually makes sense!). This would give the flexibility
to handle several cases: free parameters without
doing nonsense like inverting other variables in the ground field, parameters on the unit
circle (taking complex conjugation as bar involution), ...

Of course, a default implementation of the bar involution could be
automatically provided in the easy cases. One point to discuss would
be the interface: do we want to create a glorified field with a bar
method, or just provide the bar method separately.

Again, just some food for thoughts; I am not saying it's necessarily
the right approach for the problem at hand.

Cheers,
                           Nicolas

Hi Nicolas,

Unfortunatey, having  user supplied bar involution isn't going to work here. For example, it makes perfect sense to talk about the Kazhdan-Lusztig bases of the group ring `ZW` (by specialisation) BUT you can can't define an appropriate bar involution on `ZW`. The point is that you can't detect the KL-bases inside `ZW`: to find them you have to work generically and then specialise -- that is, you have to work in a completely different (but related) algebra to define these bases.


It turns out that if you have a Hecke algebra with quadratic relations of the form

```
(T_r-a)(T_r-b)=0
```

such that the square root of `-ab` is a well-defined element of the ground ring then this Hecke algebra has well-defined Kazhdan-Lusztig bases (not sure if this is written down anywhere but, nonetheless, it is true). 

To define the KL-bases one has to go to a suitable generic suitation and then specialize. One way of doing this is to work with the Hecke algebra defined over the Laurent polynomial ring `Z[u,u<sup>-1,v,v</sup>-1]` which has quadratic relations

```
(T_r-u)(T_r+v^2u^-1)=0
```

and then specialize `u` to `a` and `v` to `\sqrt{-ab}` -- so that, `-v^2/u` maps to `b`. There is a bar involution on this "generic" Hecke algebra which sends `u` to `u^-1`, `v` to `v^-1` and `T_w` to `T_{w<sup>{-1}}</sup>{-1}`. Moreover, there are bar invariant bases `{C_w}` and `{C'_w}` which are unique subject to a Kazhdan and Lusztig like property.

Implementing the KL-basis via this strange two parameter generic Hecke algebra behind the scenes means that the KL-bases will be defined for `ZW`. In addition, the KL-basis will automatically work correctly if I consider the Hecke algebra which has quadratric relations of the form `(T_r-v^2)(T_r+1)=0` or of the form `(T_r-v)(T_r+v^{-1})=0`. From the user's point of view they will get the right bases in all of thesse cases, and more, without them needing to do anything special.

In principle I have a patch which impements this approach, but I am running into a strange inheritance issue which I don't understand. In the original patch we have an implementation of the Iwahori-Hecke algebra `H`, with parameters `a=q1` and `b=q2`, using the standard structure:

```python
class IwahoriHeckeAlgebra(Parent, UniqueRepresentation):
    class T(CombinatorialFreeModule, BindableClass):
        class Element(CombinatorialFreeModuleElement):
    class _KLHeckeBasis(CombinatorialFreeModule, BindableClass):
    class C_prime(_KLHeckeBasis):
        def to_T_basis(self, w):
            ....
    class C(_KLHeckeBasis):
```

Whenever the squareroot of `-ab` is well-defined I am attaching a "generic Hecke algebra" `GH` to `H` together with Kazhdan-Lusztig `C` and `C'` bases which are computed generically in `GH` then automatically specialised back to `H`. As the methods for converting between the KL-basis in the two `H` and `GH` are different I have created another class for the generic Hecke algebra which looks like:

```python
class _AGenericIwahoriHeckeAlgebra(IwahoriHeckeAlgebra):
    class T(IwahoriHeckeAlgebra.T):
    class C_prime(IwahoriHeckeAlgebra.C_prime):
        def to_T_basis(self, w):
            ....
    class C(IwahoriHeckeAlgebra.C_prime):
```

In principle, what is supposed to happen is that everything inherits from `IwahoriHeckeAlgebras` and I just overwrite the basis conversion functions -- and a few other things. Everything is working exactly as I expect EXCEPT that when a "generic" method already exists in a "non-generic" basis class then it is NOT overriding the corresponding method in `IwahoriHeckeAlgebra`.

For example, as above, the 'C_prime' basis classes of `H` and `GH` both contain a method `to_T_basis`. The method in `GH` implicitly calls the corresponding method in `GH` and then specialises the result back to `H`. The corresponding generic method for `GH` implements the inductive construction of the `C'`-basis in terms of the `T`-basis. For some reason, however, both of these `to_T_basis` methods are the method defined in `IwahoriHeckeAlegbras` and the new method in `_AGenericIahoriHeckeAlgebra` is being ignored.

The categories etc of the various different Hecke algebras and bases all appear to be correct (and they are different for the generic and non-generic versions). I am just getting the wrong methods in the generic bases. Other "generic" methods which do not have "non-generic" counterparts, such as specialization, are working fine. 

I suspect that I am running foul of the category framework somewhere and that it doesn't like the way that am trying to use inheritance above. Can anyone tell me what I am doing wrong and what I should be doing?

> Thanks for the explanation. I think that the name `one_basis` is a little misleading...

Yup, that's not perfect, but it's consistent with the xxx_basis suffix
of product_on_basis and all its friends: it's a way to implement "xxx"
using the "basis". one_on_basis did not really make better sense, so
that was reduced to one_basis.

Yes, that's what I meant above by "when it makes sense". When it does
not you certainly have to go through generic/specialization.

My point is that, when it makes sense, it could be worthwhile making
explicit (and customizable!) what the involution on the ground field
does. In particular for potential use cases where the bar involution
on the ground field is non trivial. In which case the user could
provide an implementation of it to bypass the generic/specialization
process.

**How should we print elements of the Hecke algebra?**

Currently the Hecke algebra elements in different bases are printed differently:

```
sage: R<v> = LaurentPolynomialRing(QQ, 'v')
sage: H = IwahoriHeckeAlgebra(['A',2], v**2)
sage: H.T()[1,2,1]
T1*T2*T1
sage: H.C()[1,2,1]
C[s1*s2*s1]
```

I think that the default printing for the different bases should be consistent. We clearly cannot print the KL-bases as `C1*C2*C1` as this is not equal to `C[1,2,1]`. 

I also think that it is good to have the (default) output being valid input so that you can cut and paste it directly back into sage. For these reasons I would prefer:

```
sage: H.T()[1,2,1]
T[1,2,1]
sage: H.C()[1,2,1]
C[1,2,1]
```

I also think this is more readable than the current output because it is easier to identify the permutation, as a Coxeter word, which indexes each basis element. Another advanatage is that it simplifies the code.

Please let me know what you think.

**Default parameters for the Hecke algebras**

We are implementing Hecke algebras with two parameters `q1` and `q2`. Should the corresponding quadratic relations be

```
(T_r-q1)(T_r-q2)=0,
```

as we currently have it, or should they be 

```
(T_r-q1)(T_r+q2)=0?
```

There are advantages and disadvantages with both choices. I don't really care either way, but I thought that the question should be at least asked because the three "most common" choices for relations are:

(T_r-q)(T_r+1)=0           # Iwahori's original defintiion

(T_r-1)(T_r+1)=0           # the group ring of the Coxeter group
```

All of these are arguably more compatible with the second choice.

If no one has a strong preference either way then I will leave it as it is (choice 1).

It was my bug rather than one in `BindableClass`. The problem was that I hadn't defined the shortcuts in the generic Hecke algebra class. As a result the non-generic shortcuts were being inherited and used instead of their generic replacements.

> I have no preference on the sign and the string representation. Just for the record, you can input `C[s1*s2*s1]`.

Well, only if `s1` and friends have been defined:)

I have to try and finish a paper today, but hopefully I will manage to finalise this by the end of the week. Apologies for the delay.

Btw, I just noticed failing doc-test in the original patch (and in my "review"). The following is supposed to work but doesn't:

```
sage: G = CoxeterGroup("B2")
sage: T[G.simple_reflection(1)]
```

The problem is that `CoxeterGroup` and `WeylGroup` return different groups:

```
sage: CoxeterGroup("B2")
Permutation Group with generators [(1,3)(2,6)(5,7), (1,5)(2,4)(6,8)]
sage: WeylGroup("B2")
Weyl Group of type ['B', 2] (as a matrix group acting on the ambient space)
```

Does anyone know if this is fixed in some patch or reported as a bug somewhere?

We can fudge the failing doc-test by using `WeylGroup` instead of `CoxeterGroup`.

For the `CoxeterGroup` vs `WeylGroup`, you must have chevie installed so `CoxeterGroup` defaults to a permutation group implementation. Because of this, I can't test it, but it should be in the `CoxeterGroups` category and there should be a coercion between the different implementations of the same group.

Actually on that note, instead of passing a Cartan type to the Iwahori-Hecke algebra constructor, perhaps we should pass a Coxeter group instead.

A bug report on that note, this doesn't work for affine groups because the comparison of elements in the Coxeter groups does not always agree with the Bruhat order:

```
sage: G = CoxeterGroup(['A',2])
sage: s1,s2 = G.gens()
sage: G.one() < s1
False
sage: G.one() < s2
False
sage: G = CoxeterGroup(['A',2,1])
sage: s0,s1,s2 = G.gens()
sage: G.one() < s0
False
sage: G.one() < s1
True
sage: G.one() < s2
True
```

I've attached small patch which (crudely/proof of concept) fixes this by using the Bruhat ordering for you to fold into your review patch.

I've finally finished this "review". I had intended just to give the code
 a quick look over and then a positive review but the issues with computing
 the KL-bases in the non-generic cases changed that. For example, the
 previous version of the patch would have computed KL-bases for ZW which
 were not the expected bases. There were also some issues with
 documentation (both what was and wasn't written and the fact that it
 wasn't included in the reference manual) and places where Laurent
 polynomials were misbehaving badly...and I didn't like the way that it was
 necessary to specify the Hecke parameters and their square roots.

 To fix all of these issues I ended up rewriting the patch completely
(sorry!). As I foreshadowed above, the KL-bases are now done behind the
 scenes in a generic Hecke algebra. There is no longer any need to specify
 square roots as the code just figures out what to do. Here is an exerpt
 from the new documentation:
 {{{
     The conversions to and from the Kazhdan-Lusztig bases are done behind
 the
     scenes whenever the Kazhdan-Lusztig bases are well-defined. Once a
 suitable
     Iwahori-Hecke algebra is defined they will work without further
     intervention.

     For example, with the "standard parameters", so that
 `(T_r-q^2)(T_r+1)=0`::

         sage: R.<q> = LaurentPolynomialRing(ZZ)
         sage: H = IwahoriHeckeAlgebra('A3', q^2)
         sage: T=H.T(); Cp= H.Cp(); C=H.C()
         sage: C(T[1])
         q*C[1] + q^2
         sage: Cp(T[1,2,1])
         q^3*Cp[1,2,1] + (-q^2)*Cp[1,2] + (-q^2)*Cp[2,1] + q*Cp[1] +
 q*Cp[2] + (-1)
         sage: C(_)
         q^3*C[1,2,1] + q^4*C[1,2] + q^4*C[2,1] + q^5*C[1] + q^5*C[2] + q^6

     With the "normalized presentation, so that `(T_r-q)(T_r+q^{-1})=0`::

         sage: R.<q> = LaurentPolynomialRing(ZZ)
         sage: H = IwahoriHeckeAlgebra('A3', q,-q^-1)
         sage: T=H.T(); Cp= H.Cp(); C=H.C()
         sage: C(T[1])
         C[1] + q
         sage: Cp(T[1,2,1])
         Cp[1,2,1] + (-q^-1)*Cp[1,2] + (-q^-1)*Cp[2,1] + (q^-2)*Cp[1] +
 (q^-2)*Cp[2] + (-q^-3)
         sage: C(_)
         C[1,2,1] + q*C[1,2] + q*C[2,1] + q^2*C[1] + q^2*C[2] + q^3

     In the group algebra, so that `(T_r-1)(T_r+1)=0`::

         sage: H = IwahoriHeckeAlgebra('A3', 1)
         sage: T=H.T(); Cp= H.Cp(); C=H.C()
         sage: C(T[1])
         C[1] + 1
         sage: Cp(T[1,2,1])
         Cp[1,2,1] - Cp[1,2] - Cp[2,1] + Cp[1] + Cp[2] - 1
         sage: C(_)
         C[1,2,1] + C[1,2] + C[2,1] + C[1] + C[2] + 1

     On the other hand, if the Kazhdan-Lusztig bases are not well-defined
 (when
     ``-q_1q_2`` is not a square), attempting to use the Kazhdan-usztig
 bases
     triggers an error::

         sage: R.<q>=LaurentPolynomialRing(ZZ)
         sage: H = IwahoriHeckeAlgebra('A3', q)
         sage: C=H.C()
         Traceback (most recent call last):
         ...
         ValueError: The Kazhdan_Lusztig bases are defined only when -q_1q_2 is a square
 }}}

 In terms of the code there is now a new ``_AGenericIwahoriHeckeAlgebra``
 class which is where all of the KL-basis calculations are really done.
 Elements of this class have a ``specialize_to`` method for getting back to
 the (possibly non-generic) Hecke algebra. The transition to the category
 framework is now complete with the previous element class
 ``IwahoriHeckeAlgebraElement`` being subsumed into the
 ``IwahoriHeckeAlgebra`` class. There is also a new
 ``normalized_laurent_polynomial`` function for making Laurent polynomials
 (and even integers) play more nicely...this seems like an awful hack, but
 it does seem to be necessary? (Perhaps Travis' Laurent polynomial patch
 removes the need for this, but things like 1/1 being rational may still
 cause problems?).

 I have been through the documentation and tried to explain everything. I
 apologise for the many typos that I have no doubt introduced and I hope
 that what remains is passable.

 One question/concern: if some one wants to work with what really is a
 generic Hecke algebra, say defined over `Z[q,q^-1]`, I wonder whether
 the overhead in implementing the KL-bases via a hidden two variable Hecke
 algebra will end up being too costly. If I could see a way to detect when
 the parameters really are "generic" then perhaps a generic Hecke algebra
 could be returned in this case to avoid the duplication....but I can't for
 the life of me see how to detect this. Perhaps the special parameters
 `(q_1,q_2)=(q1,-1)` and `(q_1,q_2)=(q,q^-1)` should be treated
 separately?

 Finally, I seem to have confused my local version of the combinat queue so
 I am unable to push the patch to the combinat server at the moment.
 Instead I'll upload the patch to trac and hope that it works -- it should
 be applied **after** the two patches currently in the queue. Two more
 points:
* Nicolas suggested passing in the ``bar_involution`` as a parameter to
 the Hecke algebras. I haven't done this. I can't think of a case where
 this would be needed, but perhap it is? Whether or not this is done, the
 ``bar_involution`` should give an error/warning whenever the parameters
 are not generic as in such caes it ill return silly results. (As I said,
 however, I dont see how to test for "generic" parameters...perhaps just
 algebraic independence overhe ground ring?).
* Travis, sorry, but I haven't looked at all at your ``term_cmp`` patch.

 Andrew

ps. I should have mentioned that I renamed ``hecke_involution`` the ``hash_involution``  because I thought that ``hecke_involution`` sounded too intrinsic. It is often called the hash involution in the literature.

Hey Andrew,

Andrew, thank you for reworking this to handle KL basis in specializations.

Hey everyone,

Here's the new version of the patch with Andrew's review patch, the alt interface patch, and the term compare patch folded in. I've also done the following:
* fixed some typos,
* changed `_AGenericIwahoriHeckeAlgebra` to `GenericIwahoriHeckeAlgebra` since it is a more natural name and to allow it to be seen in the documentation,
* removed the `to_C[p]_basis()` methods which did
  {{{
  return sum(H._bar_on_coefficients(coeff) * (-1)^w.length()*C(w)  for (w,coeff) in self)
  }}}
  since this looked like it was intended as an element method and it did not agree with going through the T basis.

I don't know of a way to test if the parameters are truly generic or not. I'm not completely in favor of having the bases category accessible from the `IwahoriHeckeAlgebra` instance (which does follow `QSym`) since the category should be behind the scene as far as `IwahoriHeckeAlgebra` is concerned and I would expect `Bases` to return a list of bases (up to the mismatch with convention). I'd prefer to have it as its own separate class, but I'd like to get opinions on the matter first.

Thanks,

Travis

Additionally this class should be faster than going through the specialization process; so the person who is using a generic Hecke algebra and needs to speed can know of this class's existence. Plus IMO all objects, including private functions/methods, should be in the reference manual. We only make it private to hide it from the casual user using tab-completion.

There are many instances of internal/helper classes being in the sage documentation. For example, the `*Element` classes. They are there for people to look at as a nice reference. Additionally this class should be faster than going through the specialization process; so the person who is using a generic Hecke algebra and needs to speed can know of this class's existence. Plus IMO all objects, including private functions/methods, should be in the reference manual. We only make it private to hide it from the casual user using tab-completion. Since the class is not imported into the global namespace but is key for the Hecke algebras, I'd rather see it in the documentation.

> In terms of names, I called this **A**`GenenericIwahoriHeckeAlgebra` because it returns a generic Hecke algebra with a particularly *idiosyncratic* choice of parameters: `u` and `-v^2/u`. There is (currently) no way to change these parameters. Most people would expect the two variable generic Hecke algebra to have parameters `u` and `v` and to be defined over the Laurent polynomial ring in these indeterminates. This is not what this class returns. For these reasons, whether or not the class is private, I think that calling the class `GenericIwahoriHeckeAlgebra` is misleading and will cause confusion.

By putting it in the documentation we will only confuse people because they will think that they should use the generic class when they want to work with a generic Hecke algebra. When they try to do this however they will get a rude surprise because they will not be able to work with their preferred parameters.

You've chosen a convention for the generic Hecke algebra that is convenient for the code here and is clearly documented. Being much closer to naming conventions seems better to me and less likely to cause confusion for anyone who wants/needs the generic code.

> > I'm not completely in favor of having the bases category accessible from the `IwahoriHeckeAlgebra` instance (which does follow `QSym`) since the category should be behind the scene as far as `IwahoriHeckeAlgebra` is concerned and I would expect `Bases` to return a list of bases (up to the mismatch with convention). I'd prefer to have it as its own separate class, but I'd like to get opinions on the matter first.
> 
> I prefer to have the category class as subclass of the algebra class. As you say this structure is already used in several places in `sage` so the idiom is established and will be familar to people. Rather than the category being "behind the scenes", I think that the element category is an integral part of specifying the algebra so it should be part of algebra's class - having to call a random external class for the category, and further poluting sage's namespace, just seems wrong to me. 
> 
> If you want to rename the class something other than `Bases` I certainly won't object as I agree that the name is misleading. Still, I vote for keeping the category class internal to `IwahoriHeckeAlegbra` as it currently is.

It is only used in `QSym` and `NCSF` as far as I known, and they are tied together. In particular, it is not used for symmetric functions. However I was not importing it into the global namespace, but instead it was just in the module's namespace. How about a middle ground of calling it `_BasesCategory` or something else where it is private?

Hi Travis,

I am sure that there are but the main reason that I gave against doing this is that thie generic Hecke algebra class is very likely to confuse people and encourage them to make mistakes. The term "generic Hecke algebra" is quite common in the literature but I hve NEVER seen it refer to this particular choice of parameters and base ring.

> You've chosen a convention for the generic Hecke algebra that is convenient for the code here and is clearly documented. Being much closer to naming conventions seems better to me and less likely to cause confusion for anyone who wants/needs the generic code.

As some one who has worked with these algebras and with Kazhdan-Lusztig bases quite a lot, I doubt very much that any one will want to work with this particular choice of parameters. As far as I am aware this particular choice of parameters, and in fact this description of two variable KL-bases, does not appear in the literature. Because of this I do not think that any one will want or need this particular variation of "generic code". 

On the other hand, people will almost certainly want to work with the "standard" generic Hecke algebras (with parameters `(q^2,-1)` or `(q,q^-1)`) and it is quite likely that they will think that this class provides that. I agee that the documentation explains what this class actually does, but not everyone reads the manual cover-to-cover.

I didn't say we were poluting the global namespace, just the namespace:) Whether it is private or public it's still a name that must be reserved in sage and "maintained" further down the track - just like the current patch needs to depreciate, and define pickle override for, `IwahoriHeckeAlgebraT`.

Ultimately, I don't see any benefits in making the class separate, but I htink it is semantcally better to define it as a subclass and, more importantly, doing this makes the code cleaner.

Anyways, I have stated my arguments, so I am happy to let some one wiser decide.

Do you check which definition people use when reading a paper, i.e. is that the standard practice? (That is not a rhetorical question.) However I think someone has read the manual, at least the first few lines, if they found this class.

> To my mind making this class public is a lose-lose situation: we provide something that most people won't want and we risk confusing them because it sounds like, but isn't something they do want. I don't see any gains.

There are very few classes in Sage which are private, and they all inherit from `object` or `SageObject` and are small helper classes with no outside context. The reason why I made `_KLHeckeBases` a private nested class was because I was having difficulty with the inheritance with nested classes.

> I didn't say we were poluting the global namespace, just the namespace:)

You said sage's namespace which to me implies the global namespace. However you're always adding it to some namespace, and pollution, as I think of it, occurs when using tab completion. So by having it accessible as an attribute, it's pollution.

> Whether it is private or public it's still a name that must be reserved in sage and "maintained" further down the track - just like the current patch needs to depreciate, and define pickle override for, `IwahoriHeckeAlgebraT`.

I've been told we only need to do that for things imported into the global namespace, although that doesn't mean we shouldn't formally deprecate everything IMO. Yet we still have the same responsibilities with nested classes because we still need to properly handle those pickles (in essence it is in the global namespace).

> I'm against creating the category class as a separate class - I don't care what it is called:) - so I don't see this as midde ground. Given that you are arguing for documenting the generic Hecke algebra code I am surprised that you're suggesting that this could be a private (and hence undocumented) class.

I was suggesting that as a private nested class; I'm sorry I wasn't very clear on that. It's a lesser of two evils to me, not being in the documentation versus being given to the user explicitly.

> Ultimately, I don't see any benefits in making the class separate, but I think it is semantcally better to define it as a subclass and, more importantly, doing this makes the code cleaner.

For reference, these are called nested classes, subclasses are from inheritance. I think this makes the code harder to read since there's more levels of indentation to fight through.

Let me also ask you this, when should a utility class be nested? Specifically, why shouldn't the generic Iwahori-Hecke algebra be (privately) nested?

I'm also starting to worry this code is trying to be too generic instead of being explicit. In particular, we have two notions of abstract classes for the bases in `_Basis` and the category. You're also using reflection with the `getattr` which does incur a speed penality:

```
sage: class Foo:
....:     def bar(self):
....:         return 5
sage: F = Foo()
sage: %timeit F.bar()
1000000 loops, best of 3: 796 ns per loop
sage: %timeit F.bar()
100000 loops, best of 3: 757 ns per loop
sage: %timeit F.bar()
1000000 loops, best of 3: 787 ns per loop
sage: s = 'bar'
sage: %timeit getattr(F, s)()
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.09 us per loop
sage: %timeit getattr(F, s)()
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.1 us per loop
sage: %timeit getattr(F, s)()
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.11 us per loop
```

With this I'm more split on what is best here since it costs CPU cycles and is less explicit, but it is more compact and an extendable idiom (i.e. works as we add other bases, but if we keep it, there should be a comment about what's needed for it to work).

I've probably given more than a nickle's worth, so I'll stop now before I go broke.

Best,

Travis

Just some first feelings; I have only skimmed through the discussion, so please take them with a grain of salt!

About AGenericIwahoriHeckeAlgebra:

- +1 on ``it should not be in the global name space''

- +1 on ``it should not be in the Hecke algebra name space (i.e. appear in the tab completion on  Hecke algebra'')

- +1 on it appearing *somewhere* in the reference manual

With this in mind, I guess I would put it in the same module as it is now, but not as a nested class. And maybe change the class name to be explicit about the choice of parameters not being what people would call ``the generic ones''?

Oh, and a stupid idea: would it make any sense for the Hecke algebra to have lift/retract maps to the "generic" one, and reference the later as "ambient" like we do for subquotients ?

Sorry for misunderstanding. I'd be happy with this. I agree that `_BasesCategory` is a good name.

Thanks.

To borrow a phrase from Nicolas, the code should do the talking. Having `_BasesCategory` nested makes the defininition of the basis classes easier, although there is not much in it. On the other hand, the generic Hecke algebras really are subclasses and it would be major pain, I think, to define them as nested classes.

> I'm also starting to worry this code is trying to be too generic instead of being explicit. In particular, we have two notions of abstract classes for the bases in `_Basis` and the category. 
Having the nested `_Basis` class together with the category was really in the initial patch: I simply moved some common methods out of the three basis classes into `_Basis`. All of the methods in `_Basis` really should be inside the category but as far as I can see this is not possible. Please correct me if I am wrong

>You're also using reflection with the `getattr` which does incur a speed penality:

We should change this then. Minor conveniences in coding should not win over efficiency of execution I think. This use of `reflection` (again, I didn't know it was called that:), is also used in the `specialize_to` method, but I think this needed there...the alternative would be to specify the basis that is specialized to, rather than the Hecke algebra, but then you have to worry about converting to the correct basis before or after specialization and as far as I can see you would need to use reflection here instead so the problem doesn't go away.

OK, so Anne and I have voted against putting it in the manual, Travis has voted for and Nicolas for but with the caveat that it should (probably) have a different name. If the name suggests that this is an unusual generic Hecke algebra and we put a `.. warning` in the manual I guess I'd be happy. What about calling it `AnUnusualGenericHeckeAlgebra` or `ANonStandardGenericHeckeAlgebra` or ...?

> Oh, and a stupid idea: would it make any sense for the Hecke algebra to have lift/retract maps to the "generic" one, and reference the later as "ambient" like we do for subquotients ?

Well, it is not a subquotient and mathematically I wouldn't describe it as an *ambient* space, so I don't think that this is very intuitive terminology. 

On the other hand, there is already a map from the generic Hecke algebras to the non-generic one given by the `specialize_to` method:

```python
sage: R.<a,b>=LaurentPolynomialRing(ZZ,2)
sage: H=IwahoriHeckeAlgebra("A3",a^2,-b^2)
sage: GH=H._generic_iwahori_hecke_algebra
sage: GH.T()(GH.C()[1])
(v^-1)*T[1] + (-u*v^-1)
sage: ( GH.T()(GH.C()[1]) ).specialize_to(H)
(a^-1*b^-1)*T[1] + (-a*b^-1)
```

Perhaps this could be defined explicitly as a map or coercion? Although since these classes are not *supposed* to be used directly I am not sure if this is really necessary. If there there isn't any overhead in doing this it wouldn't hurt. There isn't a well-defined *retract* map in the other direction.

Btw, the `specialize_to` map probably should be a normal method of the Iwahori-Hecke algebra elements. It won't always be well-defined, and it is not clear how to test for when it is well-defined, but the documentation for the method could have a warning to this effect and we could raise an exception when specialization fails. (Actually, we should add a similar warning for the bar involution `bar`).

You are correct, concrete methods can't be overwritten by the category, in particular the `__init__()` method.

A new review patch is attached (and on the queue). It fixes some errors (which I may have introduced) in the documentation and some issues with `nil_coxeter_algebra` and `new_kschur` due to the new calling syntax and new output.

**Brant:** Could you please check the documentation for (mathematical) errors? I just fixed quite a few about the KL-bases, but it is likely that I missed some and not unlikely that I created others. As you are more familiar with the area than Travis it will be much easier for you to spot mistakes.

**Travis:** There is an error i the documentation on line 185:

```
:meth:`bar involution <IwahoriHeckeAlgebra._BasesCategory.ElementMethods.bar>`
```

The `bar involution` should presumably be a link to the corresponding method but the link i not showing up. I haven't seen this syntax before so I'm not sure of the best way to fix it. Could you please have a look?

I'm fairly happy with the patch now. As we (Brant, Travis and I) are now all listed as authors what is the protocol for giving this a positive review? Can we just agree amongst ourselves or should be lean on some one?

If you've worked with the KL-bases then you have worked with a generic Hecke algebra:) These more exotic two variable generic rings you probably haven't played with but they are just an sleight of hand so that the code works with the KL-bases no matter what normalization of the quadratic relations the user want to use: for example, `(T_r-q)(T_r+1)=0` over `Z[q^{\pm1/2}]`, or `(T_r-v)(T_r<sup>v</sup>-1)=0` over `Z[v^{\pm1}]`.

Patch review: #14261

This patch began as a SageDays project to implement the Kazhdan--Lusztig C' basis of the Iwahori--Hecke algebra under the "standard" 1-parameter specialization (described, for example, in Humphreys' book "Reflection groups and Coxeter groups").  Since this initial effort, the patch has been rewritten by Andrew Mathas to construct the algebra for any pair of parameters (rather than just q<sup>2</sup> and -1), and to compute the Kazhdan--Lusztig C basis (when the negative product of the paramters is a square in the base ring).  Travis Scrimshaw has made significant contributions to help design, code, and document these changes so that they conform to current Sage conventions used by other classes.  Their work has dramatically improved the readability and utility of this class!

Andrew is a widely acknowledged expert in this area, having written a textbook and many papers involving computations in Iwahori--Hecke algebras.  This patch implements useful mathematics and the documentation includes references to relevant mathematical literature.

Generally speaking, the documentation is exceptionally clear.  I may have found a minor typo in the description of the C basis:  I believe that the second defining property of the C basis should include a minus sign in the exponent of (-q)<sup>(\ell(v))</sup> in the triangular expansion.  Otherwise, the documentation is very helpful and includes many useful examples and consistency checks for conversions among the T, C, and C' bases.  All of the doctests (with --long) passed.  I have also tested some Kazhdan--Lusztig basis computations in types A and B and compared with the corresponding GAP/CHEVIE (version 3) output.  All of the computations I performed agreed with this external software.

Many thanks again to Andrew and Travis for all of their improvements to this patch!

Hi Travis,

Thanks for fixing this so quickly! I have checked and the new patch fixes the problems that Jeroen found, however, I found another issue: 

```
sage -t --long iwahori_hecke_algebra.py
```

takes forever.

I seem to remember that even `#long tests` should be limited to about 3-5s - which always struck me as not being very long, but rules are rules. As far as I can tell the existence of such a limit, and what the upper bound is, does not seem to be documented in the developers guide, or anywhere else, but I am sure that it exists. (As the time that a test takes to execute is machine dependent it probably does not make any sense to have an official time limit, but the developers guide really ought to mention this somewhere and give some guidance:)

Anyway, using `--warn-long 5` identifies the problem tests (there are many more in the 3-5s range):

The longest test is on line 388 -- but this whole block is problematic because if we took out the first test then one or more of the subsequent tests would take longer as they all (should) benefit from caching.

As I don't know what the official upper limit is for a long test I am not sure which ones we need to disable. Still, taking out the block on lines 383-409 would be a good start. If 30s is too long then we have a few more to worry about.

To remove a test I guess that we just replace `#long time` with `#not tested`? Hopefully, there is a more efficient way to take out an entire block?

There is certainly no such rule as far as I know. The basic rules are: normal short tests should be less than 1s. Long tests should be less than 30s, although exceptionally (if there is a good reason) up to 60s is acceptable.

The benchmark system is `sage.math` or `boxen.math`.
