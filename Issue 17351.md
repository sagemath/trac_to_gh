The current spkg-install script for pari includes the following specific darwing instruction

```
if [ "$UNAME" = "Darwin" ]; then
        # The following is a hack to get the library installed correctly
        # on Mac OS X:
        echo "Applying Mac OS X hack -- deleting and reinstalling libpari.a ..."
        rm -f Odarwin-ppc/*lib*
        $MAKE install-lib-sta
        if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
            echo >&2 "Error reinstalling PARI's static libraries (OS X trick)"
            exit 1
        fi

        cd "`config/objdir`" && cp -f libpari* "$SAGE_LOCAL/lib"
        if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
            echo >&2 "Error copying PARI's libraries (OS X trick)"
            exit 1
        fi
        cd "$CUR"
    fi
```
This section completely destroy the proper setting of darwin's install_name for no good reason. It needs to be removed. See conversation in #16017 and #16044 about this.

Haha!   I might get a chance to do it on a couple older machines (10.4 and 10.7) eventually, but you should have reviewers testing it on 10.9 and 10.10, methinks.

This passes all long doctests on 10.7 (other than the `PowmInsecureWarning: Not using mpz_powm_sec.` and a Maxima timeout, but those are unrelated and happen to me anyway).

Maybe someone should test on 10.9, but otherwise I wouldn't hold it up for me testing on any older platform.

John or William, can you quick check this doesn't break anything?  I don't have access to the right version of OS X and Fran√ßois is of course the author here.  Should be a very quick finish of review.

It shouldn't as the file set installed is the same. Just the content of the dylib headers are different. But it is better to rebuild all pari dependencies to make sure it has been taken into account and rebuilding will do that for you.
