In `diff --git a/src/sage/misc/all.py b/src/sage/misc/all.py`

```diff
-    - n -- int (default: -1) the benchmark number; the default
-           of -1 runs all the benchmarks
+    - n -- int (default: -1); the benchmark number. The default
+      of -1 runs all the benchmarks.
```



```diff
-    - list -- summary of timings for each benchmark.
+    - list -- summary of timings for each benchmark
```


in `diff --git a/src/sage/misc/python.py b/src/sage/misc/python.py`

```diff

Good changes. Positive review with or without the following nitpicks.

Optionally refactor this long line into two:


```diff
-        return "<" + ("optional " if self._optional else "") + "abstract method %s at %s>" % (self.__name__, hex(id(self._f)))
+        s = f"abstract method {self.__name__} at {hex(id(self._f))}"
+        return f"<{'optional ' if self._optional else ''}{s}>"
```


Optionally refactor `benchmark` docstring in `src/sage/misc/abstract_method.py`:


```diff
     INPUT:

-    - ``n`` -- int (default: -1); the benchmark number. The default
-      of -1 runs all the benchmarks.
+    - ``n`` -- int (default: -1) the benchmark number to run,
+       or -1 to run all the benchmarks

-    OUTPUT:
-
-    - ``list`` -- summary of timings for each benchmark
+    OUTPUT: summary of timings for each benchmark, as a list.
```


Optionally improve readability with an f-string here:


```diff
-            print("The command '{}' is not available as part ".format(cmd) +
-                  "of Sage; not creating script.")
+            print(f"The command '{cmd}' is not available as part of Sage; "
+                  "not creating script.")
```
