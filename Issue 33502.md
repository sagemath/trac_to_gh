The current solution to prebuild the gitpod docker image using github actions does not work nicely, since prebuilds triggered shortly after a new release still use the old gitpod image (and it may take up to a few days until the new image is available). This is especially notable for the `develop` branch, which is the default entry point if you want to start a new branch on gitpod.

In this ticket, we migrate the gitpod config to use the conda environment, which is now generally stable enough for serious development (e.g. almost all tests pass). As a positive side effect, the gitpod config simplifies and startup times are considerably reduced.

Can you not install the updated package manually using `make xyz`? But yes, there are a few things that might be harder to test in a conda environment. On the other hand, you also got a few new tools at your hand. For example, you can easily install specific versions of dependencies using conda.

I think its also not a good idea to optimize gitpod for package update tickets, they should only be a small subset of all tickets. And for those the conda-based gitpod works more reliable and has shorter startup times.

I think the way forward could be to work on the devcontainer ticket (#33671). There can be multiple devcontainers (we could have them for all the platforms that we generate Docker images for). This would be a good replacement for what gitpod right now offers in terms of testing package upgrades.

How would devcontainer help here? Gitpod doesn't support them yet and its not clear yet when they will and in which form; the linked github issue reads more like that the are considering this as a alternative syntax for their gitpod.yml file and not that they would offer prebuilds for all defined devcontainers.

Even with a conda-based gitpod, you can simply deactivate the conda environment and run `configure && make`. This is pretty much a disposable devcontainer without prebuild.

How is this supposed to work? I found `src/sage_setup/command/sage_install.py` which installs the jupyter kernel but is only referenced in the `install` hook in `setup.py` and thus not invoked for editable installs. So this doesn't seem specific to the conda or github setup. What do I miss?
