# Issue 21709: solve(x==x, x) returns [x == r1]

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21946

Original creator: pelegm

Original creation time: 2016-11-23 11:57:15

Keywords: solve,days79

Not sure if it's a bug or a problem with the documentation, but without any assumptions on `x`, `solve(x==x, x)` returns `[x == r1]`.  The documentation does not state what `r1` is, but gives the following example:

```
   If there is a parameter in the answer, that will show up as a new
   variable.  In the following example, "r1" is a real free variable
   (because of the "r"):

      sage: solve([x+y == 3, 2*x+2*y == 6],x,y)
      [[x == -r1 + 3, y == r1]]
```


However, without assumptions on `x`, there's no reason to believe that `x` is real.

what do you mean to say by

```
+    In case one of the solutions while solving an equation is a real number::
```

First of all, I would have written

```
+    In case one of the solutions of an equation is a real number::
```

Still, it's unclear what the following sequence of assumptions following this line has 
to do with the one of solutions being real. Do you mean to say that in order to make sure that one (rather, every?) solution is real, you need to make the following assumptions? Something else?

It was a part of ticket #21554 which has already been merged.

According to the documentation provided earlier, the solution of the equation described in the issue is r1, which is a real number (That is what the documentation says!). But the solution to this equation can be a complex number too! So, I just changed the documentation and redefined r1 to be any arbitrary constant.

OK, I didn't notice this. But this makes no sense regardless, and you should fix it here.

I understand this --- my question is wholly about the commit from #21554.
How does this docstring clarify anything about assuming non-integer? I don't get it.

No. The commits are different. I pushed them in different branches. But they showed up when I changed the author name.
That was what my doubt was about -> https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-support/iqqEhA4K2Gg

Differently named branches always have some common commits (and as I wrote on sage-support, it is the case that the commit c7acfd6 from #21554 is present in the branch here). Branch names are merely labels in the directed graph of commits in a repo.

Anyhow, c7acfd6 needs fixing, if only because it's broken English there...

Yea, I will fix it :)

This no longer merges.

I fixed the merge conflict. Unless there are other outstanding objections, I'm setting this to positive_review as this is certainly an improvement to the docs.
