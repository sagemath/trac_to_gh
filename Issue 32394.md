Keywords: typo, polynomial, random_element

In `/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_ring.py`, there are two consecutive `or` in the docstring of `random_element` resulting in the following:

...optional integer for fixing the degree __or or__ a tuple of minimum and maximum degrees. By default...

One of those `or` should be removed.
Here is a part of the corresponding docstring. Note that the two `or` are separated by a new line (1326, 1327):


```
1320    def random_element(self, degree=(-1,2), *args, **kwds):
1321        r"""
1322        Return a random polynomial of given degree or with given degree bounds.
1323
1324        INPUT:
1325
1326        -  ``degree`` - optional integer for fixing the degree or
1327           or a tuple of minimum and maximum degrees. By default set to
1328           ``(-1,2)``.
```

Will do that. This was my first time contributing anything to an open-source project, I'm still trying to figure out how trac tickets work, and how I can contribute some actual code to sage.
