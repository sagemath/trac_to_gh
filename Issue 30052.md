Imho, this try-except block should be removed and replaced by another solution (or at least restricted to a smaller snippet of code) since it can mask bugs like these.

Furthermore, I just noticed that picewise defined continuous maps (not quite the unusal case) could perhaps not be displayed properly (cf. #28554 for scalar fields).

Ah okay, it's the variable `coords2`. The bug can be fixed very quickly.

My other points still stand for discussion. :)
