Can you remind me how I can access the skynet machines? t2 seems to be unavailable.

And what is needed to do in order to build Sage on `OpenSolaris`? IIRC, one needs to set some environment variables.

We turned t2 off again because the UPS's in the math server room were dying after the power outage, and t2 draws quite a lot of power.  They are still not happy.   We probably won't be able to turn t2 on until we buy new UPS's.   The sysadmins are working with a company (APS) to get an estimate done. 

To connect to skynet, connect to sage.math  or boxen.math then ssh to skynet, e.g., 

```
   ssh skynet
```


> And what is needed to do in order to build Sage on `OpenSolaris`? IIRC, one needs to set some environment variables.

I don't think we have any OpenSolaris installs anywhere right now.   ?

Then how can it be claimed that #10296 results in a doctest error on `OpenSolaris`??

Sorry, by "we" I meant "I".  The machine "hawk" is in David Kirkby's house, I think.   It has nothing to do with skynet or the sage.math cluster.

You mean these lines?

```diff
sage/interfaces/expect.py

diff --git a/sage/interfaces/expect.py b/sage/interfaces/expect.py

 	735	            elif restart_if_needed==True: # the subprocess might have crashed 
 	736	                try: 
 	737	                    self._synchronize() 
 	738	                    return self._post_process_from_file(self._eval_line_using_file(line, restart_if_needed=False)) 
 	739	                except RuntimeError, msg:

```

That would mean: On some machines Singular raises a `RuntimeError`, while in the same setting on `OpenSolaris` it is raising a `TypeError`. Odd.
