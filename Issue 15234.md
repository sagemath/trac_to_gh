Hellooooooooooooooooo !!

HMmmmmmm, makes total sense `O_O`
And most probably totally my mistake `O_O`

What do you think of this patch ? It just clears a docstring by emphasizing that both list/permutations are accepted as input (and possibly making the instructions clearer). It also uses `graphs.PermutationGraph` instead of importing the function as it was done.

If you agree with it you can set the patch to `positive_review`, otherwise tell me what's wrong.

Thaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaanks for simplifying that and for the doc ! `:-)`
