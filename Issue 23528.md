What do you require of the basis? If the basis is just required to play well with the filtration, then `counit_on_basis` is wrong since any basis element of any degree might have a nonzero counit.

EDIT: Similarly, `antipode_on_basis` also assumes that any nontrivial basis element has zero counit (in this case, it's fine). This shouldn't be hard to fix.

I can't ssh to UMN now, and I have uninstalled my virtualbox from this laptop already (planning to get a new one when I'm back to Minneapolis). Meanwhile, can you please do the following?

1. Remove the `counit_on_basis` method. Or, if you feel like making things more interesting, keep it in, but only if a keyword argument `augmented_basis` has been set to `True` when instantiating the class. ("Augmented basis" means that the basis has the property that only the element 1 has nonzero counit.)

Done all related to this ticket.

If you do

```
HopfAlgebras(QQ).Graded().WithBasis()
```

you are saying the Hopf algebra is graded, but your basis does not necessarily respect that grading, in contrast with

```
HopfAlgebras(QQ).WithBasis().Graded()
```

where you are specifying the basis is graded. You can see the difference here:

```
sage: HopfAlgebras(QQ).Graded().WithBasis()
Join of Category of hopf algebras with basis over Rational Field and Category of graded algebras over Rational Field
sage: type(HopfAlgebras(QQ).Graded().WithBasis())
<class 'sage.categories.category.JoinCategory_with_category'>
sage: HopfAlgebras(QQ).WithBasis().Graded()
Category of graded hopf algebras with basis over Rational Field
sage: type(HopfAlgebras(QQ).WithBasis().Graded())
<class 'sage.categories.graded_hopf_algebras_with_basis.GradedHopfAlgebrasWithBasis_with_category'>
```

However, the Sym issue is a separate ticket IMO.

Yay.

> Quick question: Why is `HopfAlgebrasWithBasis` not a parent category of this? Would this lead to the incorrect conclusion that `FilteredHopfAlgebrasWithBasis == HopfAlgebras.Filtered.WithBasis`?

I don't understand. We have this:

```
sage: from sage.categories.filtered_hopf_algebras_with_basis import FilteredHopfAlgebrasWithBasis
sage: FilteredHopfAlgebrasWithBasis(QQ).super_categories()
[Category of hopf algebras with basis over Rational Field,
 Category of filtered algebras with basis over Rational Field]
```


I also removed your requirements as this is a subcategory of `FilteredModulesWithBasis`, so it has to respect them.

Yeah, that was an awkward formulation. Let me know if the new one is better. Positive_review if you are OK with my changes.

Sorry for how long this took!

(Rationale for my other changes: Theoretically, a basis of a connected graded Hopf algebra might contain, say, -1 instead of 1. Thus, the claim that the counit of $i$ is "1 & \hbox{if $i$ is the unique element of degree $0$}" is false. Also, the recursive formula for S(x) in the graded case was not true for degree 0, so I replaced "in general" by "when `|x| > 0`".)

I know this is basically bikeshedding, but I do not want the word "requirement" to appear. It feels too much like exposing implementation details (or maybe instructions to [future] authors) to the casual user. So could you revert this part:

(with adding the `)` of course). You can set a positive review on my behalf when done.

Thank you for doing the review.
