Keywords: Steenrod algebra

In Sage 5.6, the basis of the Steenrod algebra is not quite what it should be:

```python
sage: A=SteenrodAlgebra(7)
sage: for k in zip((1,..,5),A.basis()):
....:     print k
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
IndexError: tuple index out of range
```

The attached patch uses the new `set_from_iterator`-classes to fix this:

```python
sage: A=SteenrodAlgebra(7)
sage: for (idx,a) in zip((1,..,5),A.basis()):
...      print idx, a
1 1
2 Q_0
3 P(1)
4 Q_1
5 Q_0 P(1)
```

Should I be worried about calling another method (`self.is_finite()`) from the `__init__` method? Otherwise, this looks okay to me.

I wouldn't worry - we already test implictly that these calls work even though the object hasn't been fully constructed yet. The only alternative would be to move the code of `self.is_finite` entirely into the constructor and have the result cached - but I see no reason to do so; it clearly wouldn't make the code more readable, and probably also not any more reliable.
