On my new OSX 10.9 buildbot I get:

```
$ ./sage -bdist
Sage version 6.1.beta5, release date 2014-01-15
Error: configure tarball '/Users/vbraun/Sage/upstream/configure-3.tar.gz' does not exist.
Run sage-autogen and try again.
```

Jeroen, any thoughts? This would have worked if we had used "sage -f configure"....

Am I allowed to make this ticket depend on #15606 (to avoid conflicts)?
