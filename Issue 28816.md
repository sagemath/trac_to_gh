https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/source.html#linux-recommended-installation
gives `apt-get install` and `yum install` command lines to install system packages that will be recognized by `build/pkgs/SPKG/spkg-configure.m4`.

Several packages are missing, see comments in
https://trac.sagemath.org/attachment/ticket/27824/Dockerfile-ubuntu-minimal

We propose to put this information on a per-package basis into `build/pkgs/SPKG/apt`, `.../yum` or similarly named files and to aggregate it during `./bootstrap` to produce the command lines shown in the manual.

(Similar to #29041.)

I guess it was `optional` just as it predated the `spkg-configure.m4` machinery, and it was not fixed then, right?

Thanks, I have added this suggestion to #29146, which already has a number of ideas for improvements.

Somehow in recent merges I experienced failure to build the documentation in sage-on-gentoo. It seems the `literalinclude` are causing me trouble.

Yes, as of #26964, these files are being generated by `bootstrap` and are not sources in the git tree any more.

Distributors should build either from a bootstrapped source tree or from a sagelib sdist (see  ticket #21516 - Fix sagelib sdist (src/setup.py sdist); which needs help).

> I am thinking of removing the installation instruction from sage-on-gentoo 

Yes, there's no point in shipping the installation manual with a distribution package.

I see, a sagelib sdist is a good development as it makes it more like a regular python package I guess. But right now I am missing the ability to build sagelib directly from git head. Thanks for explanation.

This has missed 	`build/pkgs/r/` from #28884.
