# Issue 23170: Don't link C modules with -lstdc++

Various extension modules implemented in C are linked with `-lstdc++`. I cannot think of a reason for this, but please correct me if I'm wrong.

Odd. I'll have to check this on Cygwin just in case, but I can't immediately think of any reason it would be needed.

I suspect it is historical baggage. I can confirm that the standard extensions do not have any dependency to `stdc++`, direct or indirect. I cannot check gurobi and cplex as I don't yet provide those options in sage-on-gentoo.

I'd rather let Erik try on Cygwin first.

It built fine on Cygwin with this patch.  I haven't run the tests yet and will do so now, but I can't imagine there's any reason the tests would fail if the build didn't fail, given how sensitive Windows is with build time linking issues.
