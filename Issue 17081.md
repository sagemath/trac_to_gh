The problem is how to test if this does the thing without ssl installed.
Would it be enough to build Sage and do not install openssl spkg?

it seems to me that the patch goes too far in making tests pass no matter what. Indeed, if I do this renaming and do

```
sage -bt --long --optional=ssl src/sage/repl/ipython_extension.py
```

I see

```
...
    [0 tests, 0.00 s]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed
```

instead of a meaningful error.
