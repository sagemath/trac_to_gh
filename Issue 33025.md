CC:  mjo dimpase jhpalmieri

The behavior of our `configure` script depends on what SPKGs are already installed.

We often get reports about build problems with a `config.log` attached that just shows "... already installed as an SPKG", so we cannot see what caused the SPKG to be installed in the first place.

So at the end of a `configure` run or perhaps as a step in `build`, we should append the current contents of `config.log` to some file in `logs/`

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33262
