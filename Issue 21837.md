`NaN` should never compare equal to anything, including itself (following the IEEE-754 standard). But in Sage we have

```
sage: a = RR('NaN')
sage: a == a
True
```

Note that it is already OK for Python `float` and `complex`, `RDF`, `RBF`, `RIF`, `CIF`, but not for:

- `CC`
- `CBF`
- `CDF`
- `Symbolic Ring` (for which i have no opinion).
