Could you explain how importing `unicode_literal` allows you to use `unicode` in Python3? I would think you should use `unicode_literal`.

hmm, well. I have doubts, I must say.

Question 1: This is a pyx file. I nevertheless wonder whether cython understands "unicode" and "str" correctly in py2/py3 contexts

I am only starting to try and touch the unicode question.. IMHO, this will be a large scale mess, maybe only marginally easier than the "cmp" mountain.

Question 1 is something Jeroen might be able to answer, I cannot. For Question 2, I would almost say not putting the spaces around the `+` as it looks somewhat strange. I more strongly disagree with the space after the `:` in a slice.

Hopefully the unicode problem won't be so pervasive as we don't use unicode in too many places.

Okay, so I've looked a little more into `unicode_literals`, and it is a global flag that makes all strings into unicode (i.e., is like doing `u'foo'`). I'm slightly worried about potential side effects (well, not on my system since I don't have unicode file paths), so is it strictly necessary to include it?

Then again, this is Cython code, so Python rules need not apply.

To answer the questions above:

1. `from __future__ import unicode_literals` is like changing all strings in the sources from `"foo"` to `u"foo"`.

2. Cython does understand `str`, `bytes`, `unicode`, `basestring` in all Python versions.

Note that this conflicts with #22755.
