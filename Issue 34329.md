This should presumably be part of metaticket #27497. What references is this ticket intended to deal with?

In `sage/categories/weyl_groups.py` there are the two references [Dye] and [JahStu].
The have been added to the master reference file in #32669 as [Dy1994] and [JS2021].

I was waiting for the 'roll-out' of 9.7.1 and wanted to make the changes then.
