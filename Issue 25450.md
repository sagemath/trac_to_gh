There are a bunch of "failed to compute analytic rank" on the patchbot report. Are those ignorable?

no, they should be taken care of. Cause by the change in 	`src/sage/modular/btquotients/btquotient.py` probably. This is a very touchy file... Not the first time that I had to withdraw my changes there.

or maybe not.. I am not able to reproduce them. And I do not see how this could come from my changes, which I have double-checked, and are all innocuous enough.

So they can probably be ignored. I will try to run my own patchbots on that.

I remember seeing them on other tickets and could be ignored there. I have no idea what causes them; they seem to be more transient failures (I am also unable to reproduce them). I thought I would check just to be sure.
