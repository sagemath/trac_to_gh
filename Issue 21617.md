Wait #21419 to get closed.

Then add `kappa_dual` as parallel to `kappa` and use them to check for `is[_meet|_join]_semidistributive()`.

Just use that as a base and build upon it. It's not worth waiting until things get closed.

Yes, can be done, but getting congruence-related functions done will give enought work to do until next beta.

Thanks.

Actually I was going to add `certificate` with this, but I can do that later.
