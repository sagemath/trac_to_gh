# Issue 31866: function(lambda x, y: ...)

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32103

Original creator: mkoeppe

We extend the global bindings `function` and `symbolic_expression` to accept a callable such as those created by `lambda` expressions.

The result is a callable symbolic expression, in which the formal arguments of the callable are the symbolic arguments.

Example:

```
function(lambda x,y: x^2+y^2) == (SR.var("x")^2 + SR.var("y")^2).function(SR.var("x"), SR.var("y"))
```

On a second pass, I think this code (and the related at #32103) looks good.  An additional (`TEST` only) of this using several types of non-lambda functions could be useful.  Patchbot seems to be not giving info at the current time.

Good idea, done.

Great.  And good call on the second set of tests confirming only `(Parameter.POSITIONAL_ONLY, Parameter.POSITIONAL_OR_KEYWORD)` works.  Once patchbot says yes I say this is fine, unless Travis has something additional to say about the new tests.

Patchbot green is all I wanted, and sounds like Travis is okay with it.
