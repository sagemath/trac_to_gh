We extend the global bindings `function` and `symbolic_expression` to accept a callable such as those created by `lambda` expressions.

The result is a callable symbolic expression, in which the formal arguments of the callable are the symbolic arguments.

Example:

```
function(lambda x,y: x^2+y^2) == (SR.var("x")^2 + SR.var("y")^2).function(SR.var("x"), SR.var("y"))
```

On a second pass, I think this code (and the related at #32103) looks good.  An additional (`TEST` only) of this using several types of non-lambda functions could be useful.  Patchbot seems to be not giving info at the current time.

Great.  And good call on the second set of tests confirming only `(Parameter.POSITIONAL_ONLY, Parameter.POSITIONAL_OR_KEYWORD)` works.  Once patchbot says yes I say this is fine, unless Travis has something additional to say about the new tests.
