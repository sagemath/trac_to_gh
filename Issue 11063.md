Sorry I missed the trac update. I'm reviewing right now. Like it very much.

Mild reasons for needs_work:

* incorrect spelling of diffrent
* I guess you can't doctest `edit_devel`, but it would be good to get rid of the following warning:
  {{{
  sage -coverage devel/sage/sage/misc/edit_module.py
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  devel/sage/sage/misc/edit_module.py
  SCORE devel/sage/sage/misc/edit_module.py: 100% (6 of 6) 
  
  Possibly wrong (function name doesn't occur in doctests):
 	 * edit_devel(self, filename, linenum):
  
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  }}}

Suggestions for the patch (these things aren't regressions, they were like this always, so if you don't want to spend time on it, that's fine with me):

* After %ed, the file is reloaded, which is not the correct thing to do. It should be imported, otherwise doing %ed doesn't make sense. Example:
   {{{
   sage: EllipticCurve([1,2,3,4,6])
   Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 + x*y + 3*y = x^3 + 2*x^2 + 4*x + 6 over Rational Field
   sage: %ed EllipticCurve
   Editing... done. Executing edited code...
   sage: EllipticCurve([1,2,3,4,6])
   ImportError: No module named ell_generic
   }}}
* when the `.sub` is successful and `filename` ends with `".sage"`, it would be easy to afterwards overwrite the site-packages file with the source file. Then the user only has to `sage: from sage.all import *` (which you can tell the user to do, or maybe program Sage to do)
