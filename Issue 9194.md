Sage needs a good thematic tutorial on symmetric functions. An embryo is in sage.combinat.sf.symmetric_functions, but it's quite indigent (I wrote it, and take the blame):

- Reference it from doc/en/reference/combinat/symmetric_functions.rst and highlight it as the *main* entry point for symmetric functions
- Make sure `sage.combinat.sf?` points to this tutorial
- Extend it! (for general use, but also for kschur and the like)

I've put a first version on the sage-combinat queue.  It can be built with `sage -docbuild thematic_tutorials html`.  Currently no effort has been made to coordinate with #8533, which will have to be done eventually.  I will continue to work on this, but suggestions and advice are welcome here.
