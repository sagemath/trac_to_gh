Can you undo the changes to the `m4` files, it conflicts with #19298.

Initially I was afraid about the performance of running this `find` command all the time, but it's not really a problem.

Should we remove `./configure` from the developer's documentation? Probably yes.

The long-term goal should probably be to have everybody onboard with `./configure && make`, so I'm happy to leave it in the developer docs.

On the other hand, if this branch makes `./configure` not needed, I don't see the point of keeping it in the manual: it's only confusing.

I don't particularly care either way; Feel free to add a commit or do it on a separate ticket if you really want to change the docs.

On top of 6.10beta2, merging #19443 allows to merge #19469 successfully without having to `./configure` again. 

Passes `ptestlong` ==> positive_review.

IIRC, the trac reviewers field must contain the full name of the reviewer, not the username.
