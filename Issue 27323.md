Rawgit will shut down completely this fall, so these URLs need to be updated. JSDelivr is the replacement recommended by [GitHub](GitHub).

Thanks for the update!

LGTM. I've tried it on this [notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/egourgoulhon/SageMathTest/blob/master/Worksheets/threejs_online.ipynb); `nbviewer.jupyter.org` displays it correctly.
