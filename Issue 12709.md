# Issue 12709: Plotting zero interval raises dumb error

Issue created by migration from Trac.

```
plot(x,x,0,0)

ZeroDivisionError: float division
```

Maybe this should be an error, but it should be an _informative_ error.

See #11753, which should have fixed this.

Indeed I cannot reproduce this on Sage 5.0.beta13.

Changing type from defect to enhancement.

Oh, and this is clearly a dup *and* invalid as it stands, because I was using our old campus server.  Nice!

But I'm going to change this.  I wonder if this maybe shouldn't give rise to an empty graphic, or maybe just a point.  The reason is that in the wild, one can't always predict what one will want.  As an example:

```
var('y')
`@`interact
def _(t = [pi/6*n for n in [1..18]]):
    P = plot(1/2*sin(y),(x,0,t),fill=True,tick_formatter=pi,ticks=pi/6)
    Q = plot(1/2*sin(y),(x,0,3*pi),tick_formatter=pi,ticks=pi/6)
    show(P+Q)
    html("The integral up to $y=%s$ is $\\approx %s$."%(latex(t),latex(integral(1/2*sin(y),y,0,t).n())))
```

I would really _like_ to have it be from `[0..18]`, since I already have a plot and it would be nice to have this work since integration from 0 to 0 works - but this error stands in the way.
