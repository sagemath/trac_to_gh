The absolute value of a power is computed incorrectly when the base is a symbolic real number and the exponent a non-real complex number:

sage: abs(2^i)
2^I
sage: abs((-2)^i)
-(-2)^I
sage: abs(pi^(1+2*i))
pi^(2*I + 1)
sage: abs(2^i+1)
2^I + 1

When the exponent is a variable, the result is however correct:
sage: abs(2^x)
2^real_part(x)

Changing component from basic arithmetic to symbolics.
