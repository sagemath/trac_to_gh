This is not a Lie algebra over the scalar field (only over the base field); it fails to be bilinear.

We will change this to be a [Lie algebroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_algebroid).

I've changed this as per our discussions and the forced push is to remove the dependency of #16820.

Looks good to me, thanks (the above commits are just to fix doctests in dependency tickets).

Setting back to positive review (since the latest commit simply propagates changes in the dependency ticket #19092)
