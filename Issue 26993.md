CC:  dimpase fbissey

This is basically repackaging the existing code from `sage.env` that is used to set the `SINGULAR_SO` variable, but making it a bit more generic and flexible.

This will be useful as well for #26930 to get the correct libgap path.  It also tries to be a bit more flexible than the old code, so as to reduce the need for patching in some distros, though this does not guarantee to eliminate that need altogether.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27230

I have a branch for this, but the cloud hosting provider for the VM I was working in seems to be monkeying around with something and now my VM lacks working DNS...

`env.py` is a central repository of variables so it fits there. But I am open to discussion about splitting some of it in the future if there is a good rationale. But that will be in the future. 

Now this will remove a bit of patch in sage-on-gentoo in a nice generic way. The amount of patching of sage in sage-on-gentoo has gone down considerably.

Addressed comment:16 and obvious bugs from comment:15 (in the latter case, it previously worked on Cygwin but I did not test on Cygwin after the refactoring I did; I'm confident now that it's right-enough).

Happy to shuffle things around to different locations as well, though keep in mind everything in `sage.env` should work easily with minimal, if any, imports from other sub-packages in Sage (at least anything that does anything less trivial that define a few pure-Python classes and functions).
