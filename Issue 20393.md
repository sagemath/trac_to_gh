# Issue 20393: Missing sig_on()...sig_off() in PariInstance.get_var()

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20630

Original creator: pbruin

Keywords: pari

The following causes Sage to crash with a SIGABRT:

```
sage: R.<theta> = QQ[]
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(theta^2 + 1)
sage: K.galois_group(type='pari')
```

This is due to a missing `sig_on()...sig_off()` around the PARI function `fetch_user_var` in `PariInstance.get_var()`.
