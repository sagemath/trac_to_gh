Why not remove parentheses too?

The doctest failure in `sage/plot/plot.py` seems genuine.

the error in plot seems to be random and unrelated to the present ticket

I think this should be good to go. The failure in plot is random, and have been seen elsewhere if I remember correctly.

Would you answer this?

Well, this is a matter of taste. I prefer to keep `()` for aesthetic reasons.

I doubt it. No parentheses indicate no inheritance. Dangling `()` looks just a mistake.

To see it as a matter of taste, there should be many examples in python docs or in sage.

There is no style guide on this AFAIK, so #34348 applies.

Okay. Then I don't object.

#34348 is to be explicit about disputed styles. If this issue is on dispute again somewhere else, we may consider to put it to the section.

Inheriting from other classes is

```
class This(That, Other):
```

so, to me, inheriting from no other class with

```
class This():
```

seems consistent.

Likewise, functions definitions and calls use parentheses,
whether or not there are arguments.
