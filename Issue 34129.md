I doubt it. No parentheses indicate no inheritance. Dangling `()` looks just a mistake.

To see it as a matter of taste, there should be many examples in python docs or in sage.

#34348 is to be explicit about disputed styles. If this issue is on dispute again somewhere else, we may consider to put it to the section.

Inheriting from other classes is

```
class This(That, Other):
```

so, to me, inheriting from no other class with

```
class This():
```

seems consistent.

Likewise, functions definitions and calls use parentheses,
whether or not there are arguments.
