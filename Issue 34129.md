I doubt it. No parentheses indicate no inheritance. Dangling `()` looks just a mistake.

To see it as a matter of taste, there should be many examples in python docs or in sage.

Inheriting from other classes is

```
class This(That, Other):
```

so, to me, inheriting from no other class with

```
class This():
```

seems consistent.

Likewise, functions definitions and calls use parentheses,
whether or not there are arguments.
