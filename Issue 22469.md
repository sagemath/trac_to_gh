Keywords: giac, special functions

A "conversion" is a dictionary entry which maps object names in an interface (e.g. Maxima, Mathematica, Giac, ...) to corresponding objects with a different name in Sage.

Some conversions relevant to the Giac interface are missing:

- Dirac delta with support different from 0, as in `Dirac(t, 1)`.
- Special function names at `/functions/orthogonal_polys.py`.

See also: 

- In the file: `local/share/giac/doc/aide_cas`, lines starting by # are keywords followed by synonyms, next lines are for small doc and see also. Full doc it is here: [Symbolic algebra and Mathematics with Xcas](http://www-fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr/~parisse/giac/doc/en/cascmd_en/cascmd_en.html)

- `sage.libs.pynac.pynac.register_symbol` can be used to register new symbols in the `symbols_table`, as in `register_symbol(heaviside,{'giac':'Heaviside'})`.

```
sage: giac.simplify((exp(2*i*pi/3)+exp(2*i*pi/15))^3)
((-768*i)*(-1)^(2/15)*sqrt(3)-768*(-1)^(2/15)+768*i*(-1)^(4/15)*sqrt(3)-768*(-1)^(4/15)+rootof([[16-16*i,-16+16*i,-400+528*i,144+240*i],[1,0,-30,-40,5]]))/512

do we need to chose a name for the variable in the extention field? (if yes  then how? (or what would be a good name))

I went through the files in `sage/functions` to add as many conversions for special functions as possible, but could only find ten that were different from Sage.

The Giac exponential integrals `Ei`, `Si` and `Ci` have existing Sage aliases, so there shouldn't be a problem with those.

The orthogonal polynomials `hermite` and `laguerre` have the same names in Giac and Sage. Same for `erf` and a pending `erfc`, as well as `binomial` and `factorial`.

The Giac function `Psi` has is a different name from Sage `psi`, but the order of the arguments is reversed so I didn't add it now.

true and they agree if just 1 argument is passed.

also:

- should Giac's `abs` be mapped so `abs_symbolic`? notice that asking for `abs_symbolic??`, there is already some: 


```
"""GinacFunction.__init__(self, "abs", latex_name=r"\mathrm{abs}",
                               conversions=dict(sympy='Abs'))
```


- same for `binomial`, `arg`, `ceil`, `conjugage` (and `conj`), `factorial`, `frac`, `imag` (and `imag_part`), `real` (and `real_part`).

+1. moreover, it should also fix integration:


```
sage: integrate(dirac_delta(x-2)*sin(x), x, 0, 4)    # unevaluated??
integrate(dirac_delta(x-2)*sin(x), x, 0, 4)
sage: integrate(dirac_delta(x-2)*sin(x), x, 0, 4, algorithm='sympy')    # ok
sin(2)

hi,
i've added some simple conversions. 

remaining:

- rootof
- psi function
- derivative of delta function. 

for the last item is not clear to me if it is required to write a `_derivative_` method for `FunctionDiracDelta`, or to write a new a class `FunctionDiracDeltaDerivative`, or if it's about passing a dictionary element with some preprocessing (some arguments) so that say `Dirac(x, 2)` (giac) changes to `diff(dirac_delta(x), x, x)` in sage and conversely.

Thanks for the feedback -- not yet but close! I'd like to handle the `psi` function conversion. Have to figure out how to reverse the arguments in the function call. I haven't seen examples of that sort.. 

For the other tasks discussed in this thread, i've separated them into smaller chunks, see  [giac interface wiki section](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/symbolics#Giacinterface).

partial progress: with the last commit one has


```
sage:Â giac('Psi(x,1)')._sage_()
psi(1,Â x)
```


as desired. however the other way round doesn't work get swapped:


```
sage: psi(1, x)._giac_() 
psi(1, x)   # Psi(x, 1) is expected
```
