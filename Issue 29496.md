# Issue 29496: Create gitattributes file specifying proper line endings

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29733

Original creator: @tobiasdiez

Original creation time: 2020-05-25 12:58:58

If you checkout sage on Windows, the line endings are wrong (depending on the core.autocrlf setting).

This PR adds a .gitattributes file which specifies the correct line ending so that simply cloning sage results in the correct line ending for all files. See the following documentation for more information

Could you also take a look at the documentation that we have related to this in `README.md`? Does it need updating?

Good point. I've changed the readme accordingly. 

(Btw, the documentation at https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/walk_through.html is not really reflecting some of the recent changes to the readme.)

Thanks, I've opened #29784 for that.

I think it's better to keep the `--branch master ` in the documentation -- so that it becomes clear for beginners how to select a different branch...

I probably miss something, but what's the purpose of the `--branch master` part? The clone command still fetches all branches so that changing a branch is a matter of `git checkout <branch>`. So why would you want to use the clone with a different branch?

But if you think it would be helpful, I'll readd this of course.

Of course it's redundant but by including it, it is more obvious to beginning users what to change to get the "develop" branch.  At this point they do not necessarily know about git, and I don't think the README is a place to educate them about it.  Think of a user who used to unpack tarballs but is taking a tiny step into the scary git world.

In any case, removing it does not belong on this ticket.

Could it be that this broke #30403?

Comment by chapoton created at 2020-11-08 13:23:43

and this is also breaking some of the gitlab workers, maybe ?
