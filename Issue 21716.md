We should have an easy way of shifting a chain complex up or down in degree.

Why not just construct a new chain complex with the appropriate shift:

```
return ChainComplex_class(self._grading_group, self._degree_of_differential,
                          self.base_ring(), {k+shift: self._diff[k] for k in self._diff})
```

or is there something subtle I am missing?

Sure, that's fine, we just have to keep track of the signs explicitly. It's faster your way, though.
