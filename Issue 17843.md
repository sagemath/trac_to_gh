So it looks like I should have insisted more in #17897 about mistune. Putting that back to needs_work as it depends directly on cython and that needs to be in `build/deps`. No circular dependencies in sight.

Wasn't actually built since its not a build-time dependency

Umm... did you just add a standard package when nobody was watching?


---

(Because my build of 6.7.beta0 just failed because of this, as I was not on the internet then to download it.)

Upstream added it as a dependency, you can complain there...

Well, yes as Volker said upstream adds mandatory dependencies so we follow. The only other option is to drop a standard package. So Volker has been busy adding the dependency and I have been busy reviewing quite a number of them. While you weren't watching... Although this one would be in 6.6 I believe.

Cool.  Just given the "policy" regarding packages it might be useful to do some announcements about this, since otherwise it's rather confusing.  Just how many dependencies is Ipython adding, just out of curiosity?

5 if I count them right.
 * mistune
 * jsonschema
 * tornado (which in turn needs)
   * backport_ssl_match_hostname
   * certifi

Not everything was added at once and some of them may have been added earlier in 6.5.
