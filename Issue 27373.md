the following code


```
var("q");
cosh=(exp(q)+exp(-q))/2;
print cosh,"equals",cosh.factor()
```


outputs



```
1/2*e^(-q) + 1/2*e^q equals e^q
```

(I'm using Cocalc.)

Give positive review if you agree.

Agreed, the workaround in #27304 prevents the wrong answer. I now get:


```
1/2*e^(-q) + 1/2*e^q equals 1/2*(e^(2*q) + 1)*e^(-q)
```
