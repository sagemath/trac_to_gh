CC:  tscrim soehms

namely, they are Shephard groups.

This requires adding a few simple methods.

This is a good idea.

I just fixed a small typo!

Question: The following is just an irritation. But what is the reason for the reversed order for the reflection group?


```sage
sage: C4 = CubicBraidGroup(4)
sage: R4 = C4.as_reflection_group()
sage: C4.codegrees()
(0, 3, 6)
sage: R4.codegrees()
(6, 3, 0)
```

no special reason for the inverse order of degrees. I took them from a table in some article.

Should we check that they are given in increasing order ?

If people care, I would aim to be consistent with other parts of Sage, mainly that they are in increasing (resp. decreasing) order for (co)degrees (via `gap3`):

```
sage: R = ReflectionGroup((3,1,4))
sage: R.degrees()
(3, 6, 9, 12)
sage: R.codegrees()
(9, 6, 3, 0)

sage: R = ReflectionGroup((4,2,4))
sage: R.is_well_generated()
False
sage: R.degrees()
(4, 8, 8, 12)
sage: R.codegrees()
(12, 8, 4, 0)
```

Then we are horribly inconsistent across Sage. Well, it is not like there is a canonical way to order these. Choosing an order and enforcing it across Sage is best left for another ticket, if we want to do it.
