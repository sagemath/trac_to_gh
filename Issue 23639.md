because the function that is supposed to provide the information is itself crashing.

When starting sage with python3.6, sage crashes immediately. The crash report ends up with

```

    275 

TypeError: a bytes-like object is required, not 'str'
```

This is not the source of the crash. But the function supposed to provide information on the origin of the crash is itself crashing because `docstring` is of type `str` when `bytes` is required.

The code is in `_sage_getdoc_unformatted` (`docstring` is the return value of this function)

```
    # Check if the __doc__ attribute was actually a string, and
    # not a 'getset_descriptor' or similar.
    if not isinstance(r, string_types):
        return ''
    elif isinstance(r, unicode):
        return r.encode('utf-8', 'ignore')
    else:
        return r
```

For things to work properly I currently invert the last two returns call. It is probably sub-optimal. But after that operation the crash report works and give us the real reason sage crashed in the first place.

I don't understand half the problems you have building with python3. sage-on-gentoo just builds out of the box with python3.6. That being said your problem is with `package.py` which in sage-on-gentoo I replace with a shorter version https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/blob/master/sci-mathematics/sage/files/sage-7.3-package.py this is because from the point of view of sage-on-gentoo the sage "library" has no business in package management and what's left is solely to make patching minimal in other areas of the sage code.

I do not mess anything just to get python3 to build (apart from pynac for side by side python install), if there is something helping that's just a side effect.

I guess you have the same kind of issue python3 must expect stdout to be bytes when in python2 it was made a nice string.

Survived doctesting with python2.7 so I pushed. I am fairly sure that's the only place `text_type` is used in the file so further edits should probably be done.

I would prefer to replace

```
elif isinstance(r, text_type):
```

by

```
elif not isinstance(r, str):
```


I think that would work on Python 3 and the functionality would remain exactly the same on Python 2 since we already know at that point that it's either `str` or `unicode`.

The comment `# unicode (py2) = str (py3)` no longer makes sense. Maybe write `# On Python 2, we want str, not unicode`.
