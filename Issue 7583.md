From IRC:

```
07:34 < logix> help('sage.numerical.optimize.find_minimum_on_interval')
07:35 < logix> shouldn't this say "f" instead of "self"?
07:36 < mvngu> logix: Yes.
07:36 < mvngu> logix: Can you create a ticket for it?
07:37 < logix> mvngu: i don't have a trac account...
07:38 < logix> i'd ask wstein, but i don't think it's worth the hassle just for 
               this small thing... so could you perhaps? :)
07:38 < mvngu> Oh, I'll create a ticket then...
```
