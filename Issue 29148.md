See the numbering in [this method](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/categories/sage/categories/finite_dimensional_algebras_with_basis.html#sage.categories.finite_dimensional_algebras_with_basis.FiniteDimensionalAlgebrasWithBasis.ParentMethods.is_identity_decomposition_into_orthogonal_idempotents).

This is caused by incorrect indentation in the docstring.
