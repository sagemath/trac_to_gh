Keywords: ray class group pari

Sage's support for ray class groups of number fields is currently limited to `NumberFieldFractionalIdeal.ray_class_number()`.

The purpose of this ticket is to implement ray class groups using PARI's `bnrinit0()` and related functions.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15829

Hi John,

No plan right now, I've been swamped. If there are people very interested in seeing this move forward, I can try to carve more time out for it. It's pretty much functional, but still requires several doctests.

It shouldn't require the script. I only recently noticed that pari could do this, and so I haven't tried it. I don't think it would be difficult to switch to the pari library, but maybe I'll put that low priority since John is awaiting.

And John, sorry this is taking so long, I have a lot of other things on my plate. Have you tried it out? It works (at least on 8.0rc1). There's mostly just a bunch of doctests to write.

Thanks Frédéric, is this just a rebase?

The branch provides a lot of new functionality.

Do the author and reviewers have time to see this through?

Can the ticket be split into smaller chunks to make the review easier?

The `conductor` method of the `HeckeCharacter` class has this:

```
        modulus = bnr.bnrconductor(self._log_values_on_gens())
        # in a newer version of pari, this is replaced with bnrconductor
```

Is the comment obsolete since `bnrconductor` is already used?

On the other hand, the `is_primitive` method goes:

```
        # When a newer version of pari is part of Sage, call
        # bnrisconductor instead.
        return self.conductor() == self.modulus()
```

and the `root_number` method goes:

```
        # try-except only necessary because of
        # http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1848
        # According to Belabas this bug seems to occur because of
        # a problem dealing with imprimitive characters, thus the code
        # in the except clause below. Once we incorporate a version
        # of pari where this bug is fixed, the command in the try
        # itself should be sufficient. The first example above
        # (with Q(cubert(3))) fails without the except clause
        # and so can be used to test if the pari bug has been fixed.
        try:
            rn = self.parent().group().pari_bnr().bnrrootnumber(self._log_values_on_gens())
        except PariError:
            chi = self.primitive_character()
            rn = chi.parent().group().pari_bnr().bnrrootnumber(chi._log_values_on_gens())
        return rn.sage()
```

but it would seem the pari bug in question is long fixed, right?

The examples block for `primitive_character` needs care:

```diff
-        Examples::
+        EXAMPLES::
```


There are some unwanted spaces before `::` in other example blocks.

Is all the commented-out code waiting for some other ticket to be in?

- method `_pari_finite_factors` in the class `Modulus`
- method `_element_constructor_` in the class `HeckeCharacterGroup_class`
- lots of code in the class `RayClassGroupElement`
