# Issue 13870: saving fill in eps doesn't work right for some reason

See [this ask.sagemath.org question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/2224/no-fillalpha-after-eps-export).  The original poster points out that 


```
(plot(1+e^(-x^2), xmin=-2, xmax=2, ymin=0, ymax=2.5, fill=0.5, fillcolor='green', fillalpha=0.5)).save('t.eps')
```

doesn't actually save with the correct fill.  A simpler example is comparing

```
sage: polygon([(0,0), (1,1), (0,1)],alpha=.1).save('test.pdf')
sage: polygon([(0,0), (1,1), (0,1)],alpha=.1).save('test.eps')
```

Is this a Sage or matplotlib issue?

My thus far unsuccessful attempt.  I always forget _something_ when trying to use mpl natively, and this is no exception.  I think I just need a week to memorize the mpl workflow.

```
sage: from matplotlib.figure import Figure
sage: figure = Figure()
sage: subplot = figure.add_subplot(111)
sage: import matplotlib.patches as patches
sage: p = patches.Polygon([(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2)])
sage: p.set_alpha(float(.1))
sage: p.set_fill(True)
sage: p.set_linewidth(float(10))
sage: p.set_edgecolor((float(0.25), float(0.4), float(0.9)))
sage: subplot.add_patch(p)
sage: from matplotlib.backends.backend_agg import FigureCanvasAgg
sage: figure.set_canvas(FigureCanvasAgg(figure))
sage: figure.savefig('test.png')
```

Unfortunately this doesn't work for some reason (empty plot other than frame).  Maybe I added the plot too early.

It's a bug in mpl.

Reported at [upstream bug #1740](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/1740).

And [here is the response](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/1740#issuecomment-13290321) - that PostScript doesn't actually support this.  Well, now what?

It seems only some backends can make eps _look_ like it supports transparency. So, now I would say that this ticket should be closed as "invalid". ;) If someone needs transparency with eps, then they should save it to some other format and then convert it to eps.

Closing this ticket since it is not really a bug.
