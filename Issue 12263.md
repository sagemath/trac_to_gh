The lcalc spkg currently does not respect the global CXX flag, we should fix this (for instance for #12426).

Ooops, didn't see this ticket (as it was not listed on #2999 / #3000).

Since #12681 has meanwhile been merged into Sage 5.0.beta9, we should close this.  Sorry.


Unfortunately your changes from #12436 and #12437 will then have to be "rebased" on my spkg.

Positive review w.r.t. that this is now fixed by #12681, so *this ticket can be closed*.
