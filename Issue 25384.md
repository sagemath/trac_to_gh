Other than that, looks good to me provided that doc compiles (html and pdf).

I fixed the detail.

html doc is ok, as patchbot is green.

For pdf doc, this is not handled by default by any patchbot.

Running docpdf now. I know it will fail at some point due to the French tutorial, but it usually does combinat until then.

Changing keywords from "" to "typos, doc".

I have tried to launch one of my pet bots with the experimental `docbuild_pdf` plugin enabled. We will see what happens.
