In #3893 SL2Z.random_element() was fixed to pass through *args and **kwds arguments. There are still 2 cases in the method that don't do that.

I really don't know how to provide a doctest for this patch.

I do not agree. This is a random function, and we should not expect it to return a fixed result.


```
sage: SL2Z.random_element(5, distribution='1/n')
[-1 -1]
[ 0 -1]
sage: SL2Z.random_element(5, distribution='1/n')
[1 1]
[0 1]
sage: SL2Z.random_element(5, distribution='1/n')
[-1  7]
[ 1 -8]

The result is random, and the test must be tagged accordingly.
