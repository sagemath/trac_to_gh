A completely straightforward update, just by replacing files in src/ with newer versions.

needless to say:

```
$ sage -t --long --optional=sage,4ti2 src/sage/interfaces/four_ti_2.py
Forcing sage-location, probably because a new package was installed.

(Please wait at most a few minutes.)
DO NOT INTERRUPT THIS.
Done updating paths.

LGTM.

Harald: Can you upload this to the web server? I tried putting it into the right folder but that apparently wasn't enough.
