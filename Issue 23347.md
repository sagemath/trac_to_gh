This was found when trying to build and run sage with python3. There, one gets a  complaint that it is expecting a string or bytes and not a "lazy_string" object (for the concatenation operation). So the easy solution is to call out the string of the lazy_string. Anyway, these methods are themselves wrapped with lazy_string decorator, so there is no harm.
