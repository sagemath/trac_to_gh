# Issue 34398: Add tensor_factors() method to TensorProductOfHighestWeightModules in quantum_group_gap

This fails with `gap_packages` installed since #34393.

However, there is another failure for the submodules. I do not think subobjects of tensor products should have a tensor product structure.

I disagree

But it should be documented

If I take `V (x) W` and the submodule `V (x) w` for some fixed `w \in W`, what is the tensor product structure on that? I don't see how to make sense of that.

What are the morphisms in the category of tensor products of modules?

There is no difference with modules. Are you trying to say that we should have the tensor factors of `V (x) w` be `V` and the span of `w`? That might work, but how would this work with the problem at hand, where we have an `A`-repr inside of `V (x) W`?

Let me elaborate slightly on this. I believe we agree that the tensor product of finite dimensional modules is equivalent to the category of modules (over a (commutative?) ring `R`). It just has a little extra information about how the module was constructed (which is important for things like graded modules and representations).
