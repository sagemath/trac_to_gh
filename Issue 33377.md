The usual definition of the "homogenization" of an ideal I is the ideal consisting of the homogenizations of the polynomials in I. However, the method `I.homogenize()` doesn't compute this; it computes the ideal generated by the homogenizations **of the given generators of I**, which is in general strictly smaller (and is not what one wants for most applications).

It would be good to change this method so it computes the mathematically interesting quantity which its name suggests, rather than the essentially useless object it currently computes. (This is not difficult to do -- if we compute a Groebner basis of I w.r.t. a degree-graded order, then the homogenizations of the Groebner basis are generators of the homogenized ideal.)

Example:

```
sage: R.<x,y,z> = QQ[]
sage: J = R.ideal(x + y + z^2 - 1, x*z - y*z, x + y^2 + z - 1, x*y - y*z, z - 1)
sage: K = J.homogenize('t')
sage: x in J
True
sage: x.homogenize('t') in K
False
```
