# Issue 31826: Documentation: remove duplicate reference entry

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32063

In `dynamics/arithmetic-dynamics/end-PN_minimal_model.py` there is a literature reference to `[Bruin-Molnar]`. This is an alias to the same article elsewhere referenced as `[BM2021]`. We should fix the reference to also point to `[BM2021]` and remove the duplicate.
