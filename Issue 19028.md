`facade=True` is default for posets in general, and at least #17051 was accepted. Hence I suggest changing `order_ideals_lattice()` to also have that same default.

Logical change, I think. Nathann, a review?

Hmmmmmm... I can't say that I don't want to see the end of these non-facade things, but I am not sure that I should be the one to positive-review them, especially for this reason. 

In the present case, however, I'd say that the logical change would be to define the default of `facade` to match the facade status of the actual poset it was built from.

i.e. if you wanted a non-facade poset, you probably want a non-facade order ideal.

I add frederic in Cc, he might have an opinion on this.

You are right. I made a new commit according to that.
