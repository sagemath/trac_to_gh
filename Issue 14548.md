# Issue 14548: typo causes failure in nonsplit Cartan image for elliptic curve Galois representation

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: cremona

Original creation time: 2013-06-17 08:53:25

Assignee: cremona

CC:  wuthrich

Keywords: galois representation

In 5.10.rc2 (i.e. even after applying the patch at #14577) this happens:

```
EllipticCurve([0, 0, 0, -1129345880,-86028258620304]).galois_representation().image_type(11)
...
NameError: global name 'nonsplit_str' is not defined
```


Solution: fix typos ("nonsplit_str" --> "non_split_str") in two places.

Applies to 5.10.rc2

The patch fixes the two typos and adds a doctest to show that the original case now works.  In addition, I ran the following script:

```
for E in cremona_curves([11..300000]):
    D = E.discriminant()
    cm = E.has_cm()
    rho = E.galois_representation()
    lab = E.label()
    for p in primes_first_n(15):
        if not cm or not p.divides(D):
            print lab,p,rho.image_type(p)
```

with 5.10.rc2 + database_cremona_ellcurve-20121022.spkg and every curve in the database runs without crashing.

A future task is to check that the output agrees with that of Sutherland's independent C program.

All tests pass. Thanks for fixing my typos.

(To be precise, I get one error in sage/modular/modform/find_generators.py when testing with --long. But I am certain that it is not caused by this ticket.)
