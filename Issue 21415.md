# Issue 21415: Uppercasing "seealso"

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21652

To make automatic processing slightly easier this patch will convert every `.. seealso::` to `.. SEEALSO::`.

Done with


```
find src/sage -name '*.py' -or -name '*.pyx' | xargs perl -e 's|\.\. seealso::|.. SEEALSO::|g;' -p -i.bak
```
