Some while-we-are-at-it things (although feel free to say too much for a ticket):

- `.. note::` -> `.. NOTE::`
- Rename the `dict` variables.
- Remove the `:math:` tags.
- Avoid the `*.all` imports (this helps avoid circular imports).
- Lowercase error messages, e.g., `raise ValueError("There are...`.

But there is a failure in the `TestSuite` now, and I do not understand why.

I don't have the error in front of me, but since you added `UniqueRepresentation` to `EtaGroup_class`, it should not have a `__reduce__` method. (Also, it is better to put the UR first in the MRO.)

Also, instead of `EtaGroupElement` in the `__call__` (which likely should become `_element_constructor_`), you should use `self.element_class`.

I don't understand the purpose of the `EtaProduct` function. Likewise, the corresponding arithmetic functions should just be replaced by `self.parent().element_class(self.parent(), data)`.

Last, why the change to the more generic class:

```diff
-class EtaGroupElement(MultiplicativeGroupElement):
+class EtaGroupElement(Element):
```

I am fine with it, but I was wondering if you had a reason for the change.

I do not understand exactly what you say. Maybe one could keep further refactoring for later ?

Well, this seems to be duplicated information, as we have fixed the category for the parent now. And `MultiplicativeGroupElement` looks like something from an old Element hierarchy system, which is more or less obsolete, no ?

I made these changes because it is necessary to have the elements returned being the correct class. However, I created #31121 for some additional changes I wanted to make while looking at the file.

True, there is nothing really added there.

If my additional changes are good, then positive review. Tests in the folder pass for me.
