# Issue 12791: PolyBoRi links against system -lboost_unit_test_framework

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/12963

As noted on sage-support, the sage-5.0 *binary* `sage-5.0-linux-32bit-fedora_release_16_verne_-i686-Linux.tar.gz` requires the boost library `libboost_unit_test_framework` at runtime, since the binary was built on a machine with that library available.  PolyBoRi checks for `-lboost_unit_test_framework` and links against it if available.

This is because of the PolyBoRi upgrade to version 0.8.1.  The older PolyBoRi in sage-4.8 did not do this.

I'd be in favor of adding the missing bits of boost. Its a great library and we should make more use of it if anything.

The full boost package is close to 50 MB in size.  So I can imagine some people being unhappy about this.

Diff for the polybori spkg. For review only

The diff looks sane. If it installs and tests well, I'll give a positive review soon.
Note that upcoming PolyBoRi 0.8.2 will only links the tests to boost_test. Since test executable  are not installed, the problem should not persist then.

`make ptestlong` succeeded, so positive review.

My system boost library got upgraded (1.46 -> 1.48), and then polybori broke.

Irrespective of however many times I recompiled polybori, ldd showed that libpolybori-0.8.1.so.0.0.0 was still linked agaist libboost_unit_test_framework-1_46*. Installing this spkg works, and now libpolybori-0.8.1.so.0.0.0 is linked against the new boost.

The new spkg here only changes things for binary versions of Sage (i.e. when `SAGE_FAT_BINARY=yes`).  If you're using Sage on your own computer, not intending to distribute it, I don't think it's a problem that the system Boost library gets linked.

Well, the point is that this spkg works while the one already present doesn't. I recompiled polybori several times, and I have no idea how it kept on relinking against boost-1.46 when it is not even present in my system. Using this spkg actually did the right thing and linked it against the installed boost-1.48.

This SPKG gives weird linker errors (as in, `ld` quits with nonzero exit status) on my multiarch Debian system. Here's a diff of my build log for p1 and p3 (#13040): http://wstein.org/home/keshav/files/polybori-log.diff.xz

I'm not sure, but I would suspect, that the error were introduced by p3. Do the ld errors occur in with p2?

Huh, you're right. Weird...

Looking closer, the linker errors were intended, but they should be suppressed of course. Unfortunately, the patch from #13040 reverted this. I have suggested an alternative patch there.Looking closer, the linker errory were intended, but they should be suppressed of course. Unfortunately, the patch from #13040 reverted this.
