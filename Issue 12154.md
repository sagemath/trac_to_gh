From [this ask.sagemath.org answer](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/703/combine-sage-plot-with-matplotlib?answer=1734#1734), an interesting sort of example (maybe could be spruced a little) which could be useful in the documentation for plotting.

```
#make some graphs
x=var('x')
g=plot(sin(x))
g_ins=plot(cos(x))
# plot main figure
from matplotlib.figure import Figure
figure = Figure()
main_plot = figure.add_axes((0.2,0.2,0.7,0.7))
g.matplotlib('a.svg', figure=figure, sub=main_plot)
# plot an inset
inset = figure.add_axes((0.6,0.2,0.3,0.3))
g_ins.matplotlib('a.svg', figure=figure, sub=inset)
# display graph (note that only single sage Graphics object has to be saved )
g_ins.save('a.svg', figure=figure, sub=inset)
```

apparently this shows how to plot using matplotlib a graph made with Sage plot command.
I'm looking for the other way round: plot with Sage a matplotlib graphics (for example made by
the pylab.imshow command).
