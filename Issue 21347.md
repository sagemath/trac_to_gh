I forgot that `Permutations(n)` gives permutations for elements `1, ..., n`, not `0, ..., n-1`. Hence `Posets.RandomLattice(n, ...)` gives elements starting from one instead of zero. Should be corrected, as `Posets.RandomPoset(n, ...)` starts from zero.

maybe `Permutations(list(range(n))).random_element()` would work ?

It would, but I already did a correction. But whatever, I can put a positive review if you put your code to trac. This should not make any significant difference.
