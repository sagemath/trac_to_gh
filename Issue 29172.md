This issue is split off from #29400. The command `cot(1 + I).n()` gives a `TypeError`:

```
sage: cot(1 + I).n()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

TypeError: cannot evaluate symbolic expression numerically
```

There is no such error for `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `sec`, or `csc`.

I believe this can be fixed by renaming the `cotan` method of the `ComplexNumber` class to `cot`, and I will upload a PR soon.

I changed the name of the `cotan` method of the `ComplexNumber` class to `cot`. This eliminates the error:

```
sage: cot(1 + I).n()
0.217621561854403 - 0.868014142895925*I
```

For consistency, I made the same change to the class `MPComplexNumber`, which I think is the only other occurrence of a `cotan` function in the sage source. To preserve backwards compatibility, I added `cotan` as an alias for each of these methods.

Do we want to deprecate `cotan`? If so there is `deprecated_function_alias` that you may use. You will find example by doing `search_src('deprecated_function_alias')`.


```
from sage.misc.superseded import deprecated_function_alias

Yes, we should deprecate `cotan`. Thanks for the suggestion. I made a new ticket (#29412) for this, because cotangent is such a well known function that I don't feel comfortable making a possibly significant change to its behavior without announcing it, even though I don't think this will be controversial.

This is not official, but we usually do

cotan = cot  # provide this alias for backwards compatibility in #29409
```

instead of

```
cotan = cot # provide this alias for backwards compatibility (2020-3-25)
