# Issue 29706: do not assume R installation has Makevars.site

If SAGE_LOCAL is set to the prefix of an (external, or not) R installation,  it is assumed in src/bin/sage-env that Makevars.site exists.

But it should be checked, as it need not be there in case of an external R.

Note: if one wants to ignore theses variables, it is possible to launch R with a parameter.



```
  --no-environ          Don't read the site and user environment files
  --no-site-file        Don't read the site-wide Rprofile
  --no-init-file        Don't read the user R profile
```
