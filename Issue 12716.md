I added a set_random_seed in generic_graph.py, because randomly generated graphs are not always hamiltonian.

The default method is now set to ``Sage`` since it seems faster than the ``networkx`` method, except for very sparse graphs where networkx with ``fast=True`` is faster. Bellow are some experiments from very dense to very spare graphs.

1) When ``method="networkx"`` and ``fast=False`` (so before this patch and after patch #12362)

```
sage: timeit('graphs.RandomGNP(2000, .8, method = "networkx", fast = False)') 
5 loops, best of 3: 22.5 s per loop
sage: timeit('graphs.RandomGNP(2000, .1, method = "networkx", fast = False)') 
5 loops, best of 3: 6.38 s per loop
sage: timeit('graphs.RandomGNP(2000, .01, method = "networkx", fast = False)') 
5 loops, best of 3: 4.21 s per loop
sage: timeit('graphs.RandomGNP(2000, .001, method = "networkx", fast = False)') 
5 loops, best of 3: 4.07 s per loop
```


2) When ``method="networkx"`` and ``fast=True``

```
sage: timeit('graphs.RandomGNP(2000, .8, method = "networkx", fast = True)') 
5 loops, best of 3: 19.6 s per loop
sage: timeit('graphs.RandomGNP(2000, .1, method = "networkx", fast = True)') 
5 loops, best of 3: 2.44 s per loop
sage: timeit('graphs.RandomGNP(2000, .01, method = "networkx", fast = True)') 
5 loops, best of 3: 237 ms per loop
sage: timeit('graphs.RandomGNP(2000, .001, method = "networkx", fast = True)') 
25 loops, best of 3: 27.9 ms per loop
```


3) When ``method="Sage"`` (with this patch)

```
sage: timeit('graphs.RandomGNP(2000, .8, method = "Sage")') 
5 loops, best of 3: 11.3 s per loop
sage: timeit('graphs.RandomGNP(2000, .1, method = "Sage")') 
5 loops, best of 3: 1.38 s per loop
sage: timeit('graphs.RandomGNP(2000, .01, method = "Sage")') 
5 loops, best of 3: 166 ms per loop
sage: timeit('graphs.RandomGNP(2000, .001, method = "Sage")') 
5 loops, best of 3: 49 ms per loop
```
