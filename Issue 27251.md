# Issue 27251: Note that timeout is in seconds in doctesting page

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27488

Original creator: kcrisman

Original creation time: 2019-03-14 18:47:17

[This page](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/doctesting.html) does not mention that the timeout parameter is in seconds.  It probably should, for completeness.  Also, several things on the [installation guide](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/source.html#make-targets) should be mentioned here, since they are about doctesting.

Ticket retargeted after milestone closed (if you don't believe this ticket is appropriate for the Sage 8.8 release please retarget manually)

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).
