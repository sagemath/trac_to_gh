Fix would be trivial (add a comma + doctest).

Thanks.

I added two reviewer commits for PEP8 compliance.

Please add your full name in the author field of this ticket.

I do not know whether we have a strict policy on that, but most commits in Sage nowadays have the _full name_ of the author as the git author, see the [developer's guide](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/git_setup.html#your-name-and-email). This would be impractical for these commits, but please do it for future contributions.

Apart from that, this is a positive review from my side.

Thank you, and sorry about missing the PEP8 guidelines. I added myself as an author. I changed the status to _positive_review_.
