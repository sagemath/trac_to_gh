as a simple useful invariant to have, much finer than cardinality, and still multiplicative for Cartesian product.

I'm not familar with the `polygens` construct -- how clean is it?

Also, is there a reason not to define this on the level of digraphs?

Since you also need the parent, I would do

```python
from sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_ring_constructor import PolynomialRing
R = PolynomialRing(ZZ, 'x,y')
x,y = R.gens()
```

I also agree with Darij that this should be lifted to a method of `DiGraph` and then call `self._hasse_diagram.valence_polynomial()`.
