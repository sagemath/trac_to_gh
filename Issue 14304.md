Looks good, but the commit message should be more descriptive and you need to put the ticket number on a line of the test that checks that this bug was fixed, i.e. add a comment

`... # Trac #14508`

I failed to find a reference in the developer's guide, but I am pretty sure that was the consensus.

Helloooooo !

It looks good to me, but when you add

```
if base_ring.is_field():
    A = self.change_ring(base_ring) 
```

Then you make a copy of `A` even if ``base_ring`` is equal to ``A.base_ring()``, aren't you ? Is that necessary ?
