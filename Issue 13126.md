# Issue 13126: Update Cremona's table of elliptic curves to 250000

Issue created by migration from Trac.

On 2012-07-23 John Cremona published an update of his database covering the conductor range 240000-250000. The optional spkg database_cremona_ellcurve needs updating accordgingly.

As soon as I have finished a full test to see if any doctests need changing (as sometimes happens) I'll set this to Needs Review.

This works as is with 5.2.rc1.  After #12768 there will need to be one doctest change in sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_curve_isogeny.py since #12768 introduces a doctest which creates a curve whose conductor is between 240k and 250k.

I'm now making a patch to allow for the issue raised above relating to #12768.

Attachment

Without the patch there's one test which will fail if the optional database is installed since it relies on a curve of conductor 10001 not being in the database.  I replaced it by one of conductor `>10^8`.

spkg is on the sage server + on its way around the world :)

Thanks!  I was wondering if I would get to 280000 before this went in, but no (currently at 275840).

I now have an updated spkg which goes up to 280000.  Shall I open a new ticket for that (I assume yes)?

Yes please! It's more work, but hard to follow later on, if one ticket that has been closed (and resolved something) ends up serving more than one task.

Fine.  See #13547.
