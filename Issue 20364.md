Keywords: warnings, experimental

Marking a function/method/constructor as ``@`experimental` causes the experimental warning message to be issued every time. This seems to be due to a general convention in Sage that warnings are issued repeatedly.

That convention leaves ``@`experimental` virtually useless, however, since the user is clearly aware of the experimental nature of the code after the first issuing of the warning, but nonetheless chooses to keep on using it.

This patch makes sure that the ``@`experimental` warnings are issued only once (without changing behaviour for other warnings)

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20601

I've implemented a flag so ``@`experimental` knows whether it has already issued a warning or not. The flag works as expected in the terminal.

However, during doc-testing I get strange behaviour: I wanted to add a test to demonstrate that an error message is now only issued on the first call. However, the test passes even without the patch! This is in stark contrast to the behaviour in the terminal, where the message (copy-paste the code from the doc-tested) is definitely issued every time. There is some magic in either Sphinx or the terminal interface that I'm not understanding here.

(more data is that #20526, commit 0ab93ec currently has all doc-tests failing due to experimental warnings being issued, but with this patch, all the tests pass)

I managed to make a test that properly demonstrates the behaviour: without the patch, the test fails since extra `FutureWarning`s are issued, while the test passes with the patch.

Due to aforementioned Sphinx magic the test is a bit complicated: it seems the test has to involve a "real" function/class and span multiple documentation strings, so I've added a class `__experimental_self_test` for this purpose.

Note that this behaviour is really critical, i.e. that only a single warning is issued across documentation strings: if not, a class that is marked as ``@`experimental` would need to add the `FutureWarning` to *all* documentation strings in the entire file. With this patch, only a single at the top needs to be added (e.g. together with the documentation text that describes that the functionality is experimental).

The patch is still in needs review.

Hello,

It works (I tested it in #20526 and it fixed my problem with experimental warnings), the doc looks good...
But does not compile because you wrote `:method:` instead of `:meth:` l. 222 in `superseded.py`.

If you fix that I'll set this ticket to positive review.
