I needed to massively optimize f.change_ring(QQ) for f in ZZ['x'] so that #11375 would not suck.

I can confirm that the patch does exactly right thing, and I have successfully run the test code in the polynomial section.

Also, I wanted to add that the function "fmpq_poly_set_fmpz_poly" is present in flint-2.3 so that this won't have to be rewritten when we finally update the version of the flint in Sage.

Best wishes

Sebastian
