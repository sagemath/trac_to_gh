CC:  simonking

The API change of `coercion_model` (#27021) broke `p_group_cohomology`: https://patchbot.sagemath.org/log/27152/Ubuntu/18.04/x86_64/4.15.0-38-generic/quasar/2019-01-29%2023:36:43

The fix is simple: rebuilding `p_group_cohomology` is sufficient (an analogous problem occurred with `giacpy_sage` on #27021). There is no automatic way to do this, but because of the missing dependency on cython (which is what I grepped for) I missed this.

That's actually good news. When you wrote "API change broke the spkg", I thought I need to change code again (by the way, I am not sure: What is the current official spkg version in Sage? v3.1?).

> (an analogous problem occurred with `giacpy_sage` on #27021). There is no automatic way to do this, but because of the missing dependency on cython (which is what I grepped for) I missed this.

The current dependencies are

```
singular meataxe | matplotlib gap xz $(SAGERUNTIME)
```


Really the package does depend on sagelib. Namely, it cimports various Sage types (including Element, Parent).

In an ideal world, it would be possible to have a dependency list

```
singular meataxe sage.structure.element | matplotlib gap xz $(SAGERUNTIME)
```

No, what really happened is an incompatible change in `element.pxd` which means that every Cython file cimporting that must be recompiled.

So, are you saying that a dependency on *specific* parts of the Sage library is possible? Or would that mean to extend Sage's build system?

Nice! I thought the `dependencies` file may only contain package names.

Also good that you add pip - indeed spkg-install uses pip.

But how to test it? Pull the branch, build sage, touch element.pxd, do `make` and see if the spkg gets rebuilt?

I think it would be possible to be a little more thorough. Here is the list of all cimports in the spkg that get stuff from outside the spkg (hence, that's dependencies):

```
src/pGroupCohomology/cochain.pxd:from sage.matrix.matrix_gfpn_dense cimport Matrix_gfpn_dense as MTX
src/pGroupCohomology/cochain.pxd:from sage.libs.meataxe cimport *

src/pGroupCohomology/cochain.pyx:from sage.structure.element cimport RingElement

src/pGroupCohomology/cohomology.pyx:from sage.matrix.matrix_gfpn_dense cimport new_mtx
src/pGroupCohomology/cohomology.pyx:from sage.libs.meataxe cimport *
src/pGroupCohomology/modular_cohomology.pyx:from sage.libs.meataxe cimport *
src/pGroupCohomology/modular_cohomology.pyx:from sage.matrix.matrix_gfpn_dense cimport Matrix_gfpn_dense as MTX
src/pGroupCohomology/modular_cohomology.pyx:from sage.matrix.matrix_gfpn_dense cimport new_mtx
src/pGroupCohomology/resolution_bindings.pxd:from sage.libs.meataxe cimport *
src/pGroupCohomology/resolution.pxd:from sage.libs.meataxe cimport *
src/pGroupCohomology/resolution.pxd:from sage.matrix.matrix_gfpn_dense cimport Matrix_gfpn_dense as MTX
src/pGroupCohomology/resolution.pyx:from libc.string cimport memcpy
src/pGroupCohomology/resolution.pyx:from cysignals.memory cimport sig_free
src/pGroupCohomology/resolution.pyx:from cysignals.signals cimport sig_check, sig_on, sig_off

src/pGroupCohomology/resolution.pyx:from sage.matrix.matrix0 cimport Matrix as Matrix0
```

So, the complete lists of dependencies is

```
sage.matrix.matrix_gfpn_dense
sage.libs.meataxe
sage.structure.element
sage.rings.morphism
libc.string
cysignals.signals
cysignals.memory
sage.matrix.matrix0
```


So, I suggest to include all this in the list of dependencies. Which gives rise to the questions:
- Has the dependency list be in a single line, or can it be one dependency per line? Would look nicer!
- What to do about libc and cysignals? Is that covered by the dependencies `python` and `cython`?

Only the first line of the `dependencies` file is read, so yes, the dependencies must all
be listed in the first line of that file.

I have added all dependencies in sagelib, i.e., all pxd-files from which p_group_cohomology cimports.

So, what's missing is libc and cysignals. How to name them in the dependencies?

No, that's not the complete list of dependencies. Like I said, you should also consider implied dependencies: for example, `sage.structure.element` depends on `sage.structure.parent` and so on. So my choice of `sage.structure.element` and `sage.matrix.matrix_gfpn_dense` was meant to be a reasonably small but meaningful set of dependencies.

For cysignals, just add a dependency on the `cysignals` package.

I understood that. But I think to the very least one should name *all* pxd files from which the package cimports. Everything else would be too short.

Thanks. And for libc?

I have added `cysignals` to the dependencies. What about `libc`? In any case, it is still "needs review", and since I added stuff (after searching for all cimports), I guess I qualify as one author.

That's just the system C library on which virtually everything depends. It's assumed to remain ABI-compatible, so recompiling isn't needed.
