CC:  @tscrim @fchapoton

Keywords: py3, graph

We clean methods `subgraph`, `_subgraph_by_adding`, `_subgraph_by_deleting`, `subgraph_search`, `subgraph_search_count`, `subgraph_search_iterator`, `random_subgraph`, `is_chordal`, `is_circulant`, `is_interval`, `is_gallai_tree`, `is_clique`, `is_cycle`, `is_independent_set`, `is_subgraph`. 
- PEP8 cleaning

- avoid sortings in methods `_subgraph_by_adding` and `_subgraph_by_deleting` and slightly speed up the methods by using sets instead of lists for checking membership.

- fix bug in `is_hamiltonian` for graphs on 2 vertices with multiple edges that is raised by the changes done in `_subgraph_by_deleting`. Roughly, we were not testing if `self.allows_multiple_edges()` but if `self.has_multiple_edges()`. Consequently, in some situation we were returning edge `(u, v, [l])` instead of `(u, v, l)`, but `(u, v, [l])` is not hashable! The changes done here are not conflicting with the changes done in #26663.

- avoid comparison of vertex labels in `is_clique` using a mapping to integers

- small improvement in `is_independent_set` to avoid a copy

If I don't do this change in `traveling_salesman_problem`:

```diff
-                    if self.has_multiple_edges():
+                    if self.allows_multiple_edges():
```

then I get:

```
Failed example:
    DiGraph([(0,1),(1,0)],multiedges=True).is_hamiltonian()
Exception raised:

        edges_to_keep_labeled = frozenset(e for e in edges if len(e) == 3)
    TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'
```

Indeed, when the graph allows multiple edges, `G.edge_label(u, v)` returns a list, even if there is only one edge from u to v.

So the doctest is already here.
