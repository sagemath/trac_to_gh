Does [attachment:sage_crash_IAI1or.log] look right to you?  Why are there only 4 frames in the Cython backtrace?

And (this is unrelated to this ticket) why is there a message

```
Exception:  <type 'exceptions.TypeError'> must be string, not None
```

That means that the Python script running in GDB encountered an error. Unfortunately it doesn't do automatic backtraces. I've updated the patch to manually print a backtrace. Can you give it a try? This should tell us what is wrong on your system...
