CC:  gchatel vivianepons @tscrim

Let us implement a `random_element` method for Tamari intervals.

This uses random triangulations and the bijection of Bernardi and Bonichon.

On the way, one needs also to compute a minimal Schnyder wood of a planar triangulation.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20240
