Instructions for the git-trac command in the Developer's Guide needs to be updated to match the instructions and new options listed on the Readme of the git-trac-command Github page.

In particular, the Developer's Guide makes no mention of the new --token= option, which is the only way that people with [GitHub](GitHub) accounts are able to authenticate.

Don't forget to set the ticket to `needs_review` when it is ready for review.

I know, I just didn't want to mark it for review until I had a chance to double-check everything myself.
