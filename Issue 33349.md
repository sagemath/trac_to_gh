The docstring for `boundary_simplicial_complex` ends with

```
The boundary of every convex set is a topological sphere::
```

Thanks! I'll add the missing example

Would it be possible to illustrate that boundary_simplicial_complex is a sub complex of simplicial_complex?

Good idea, done

It looks like abstract simplicial complexes don't have an `is_subcomplex` method. Should we add one?


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2022-08-06 21:32:01

Cubical complexes also define `is_subcomplex`.


---

Comment by yzh created at 2022-08-06 21:33:38

Defining `is_subcomplex` for abstract simplicial complexes is probably beyond the scope of the current ticket. I think that polyhedral complex has the method `is_subcomplex`, so it can at least be added to the doctests of `polyhedral_complex` or `boundary_polyhedral_complex`.

Yes, I'm already using it

OK, I've opened #34294 for it

In the docstring of `Triangulation.__init__`, it says "In the second case, the point indices of the maximal simplices of the triangulation", which needs rephrasing.

It would be nice to point out that the polyhedral complex and boundary polyhedral complex are actually simplicial complexes. The difference is that they are not abstract.

Never mind.

Does it make sense to compare `Triangulation.boundary_polyhedral_complex` and ` PolyhedralComplex.boundary_subcomplex`?

I decided to stay away from that for this ticket because there's a bit of confusion regarding "boundary" vs "relative boundary"

The code on this ticket (other than comment:21) looks good to me.
