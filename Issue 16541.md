The text report of gperftools is printed to stdout, but in order to access it in other methods (e.g., citations), we need the it to return the report as a string.  This adds an optional parameter to the method top.

I'm against the last commit. You have a method to "ï¿¼Print text report" and you added an option to precisely **not** do that. WTF? Do you think that is a sane UI? If you want to save the output to a file there is already "save". If saving to a temporary file and loading said file is a common occurence then add an appropriately-named method, `string()` or `stdout()` or something like that.

That's all right (I mean the language). As for the commit, I see what you mean. My focus is on citation management at #16777. So I would postpone work on profiling. Eventually an interface unifying cProfile and gperftools would be nice. But that's not for today, and requires more thorough thining.

Close as wontfix then?
