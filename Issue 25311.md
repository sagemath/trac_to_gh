At the very least it creates a `twisted` dependency for sage that I was not aware off. If we can, we definitely should remove it.

FWIW this sort of thing will less likely be a problem come the day we can fully switch to Python 3, where the `multiprocessing` module has been refactored to not use so much module-global state that interacts poorly when `multiprocessing` is used by multiple Python modules for different purposes within the same application.
