I do not see the point of the commit, in particular the code `query = list(query)`, the current code works correctly with tuples already:


```
sage: oeis((1,2,5,16,61))                                                                                                                                                                                    
0: A000111: Euler or up/down numbers: e.g.f. sec(x) + tan(x). Also for n >= 2, half the number of alternating permutations on n letters (A001250).
1: A138265: Number of upper triangular zero-one matrices with n ones and no zero rows or columns.
2: A303058: G.f. A(x) satisfies: A(x) = Sum_{n>=0} (1+x)^(n^2) * x^n / A(x)^n.
```


Perhaps could we improve the doc of `find_by_subsequence`, in the `INPUT` section to explicitely state:


```
- ``subsequence`` -- a list or tuple of integers.
```

Also, if some handling of the data should be done (this is not the case), it seems better to do it in the `find_by_subsequence` method, since the `__call__` method is a just dispatcher.
