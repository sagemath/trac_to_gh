Keywords: days101

As the [Python 3 documentation for the `collections` module](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/collections.html) explains,
some [Collections Abstract Base Classes](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/collections.abc.html#collections-abstract-base-classes)
moved to the [`collections.abc`](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/collections.abc.html#module-collections.abc) module, staying visible in `collections` through Python 3.7.

These "Collections Abstract Base Classes" currently include
`AsyncGenerator`, `AsyncIterable`, `AsyncIterator`, `Awaitable`,
`Bytestring`, `Callable`, `Collection`, `Container`, `Coroutine`,
`Generator`, `Hashable`, `ItemsView`, `Iterable`, `Iterator`, `KeysView`,
`Mapping`, `MappingView`, `MutableMapping`, `MutableSequence`,
`MutableSet`, `Reversible`, `Sequence`, `Set`, `Sized`, `ValuesView`.

In Python 3.8 importing them from `collections` will stop working.
In Python 3.3 to 3.7, they can be imported from `collections` or
from `collections.abc` (it gives the exact same classes).
In Python 3.7, importing them from `collections` prints a
deprecation warning, since Python 3.8 is getting near.

In Python 2 they can only be imported from 'collections',
not from 'collections.abc'.

In Sage we have a few such imports:
`Iterable`, `Iterator`, `MutableMapping`, `Sequence`.

We deal with this using a try/except block:

```
try:  # works in Python >= 3.3
    from collections.abc import Sequence
except ImportError:  # Python 2, Python <= 3.2
    from collections import Sequence
```


We can then revert the silencing of warnings from #28002.

Sorry for letting over a year pass by. Here is a new branch. Please review.

The file `finite_state_machine.py` has `import collections`
and then `collections.defaultdict`, `collections.OrderedDict`,
`collections.deque`, `collections.namedtuple`, `collections.abc.Iterator`.

Would there be an advantage, or a disadvantage, to doing the following instead:

```
from collections import defaultdict, deque, namedtuple, OrderedDict
from collections.abc import Iterator
```

and then using `defaultdict`, `OrderedDict`, `deque`, `namedtuple`, `Iterator`?

I changed to that style in some other files.
