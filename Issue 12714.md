They are currently several metaclasses in Sage for various feature. There is an ongoing discussion to improve the framework. 

See #12808 and [this thread](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-combinat-devel/browse_thread/thread/ae09de5a608525e5)

I think the meta-metaclasses only make sense if introspection would properly work, which requires #11791.

Yes, I had forgotten about the old ticket when I opened the new one some years later.
