Keywords: erf inverse erfinv inverf

[Mpmath](http://mpmath.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/build/functions/expintegrals.html#erfinv) has an inverse erf.  [Maxima](http://www.ma.utexas.edu/pipermail/maxima/2009/017196.html) now has an inverse erf.  We need it too.

It should be both symbolic and evaluated.  !Function_Erf could be used as a model.  Make sure to add it to the conversion list in sage.symbolic.pynac!  (Which should be elsewhere in any case...)
