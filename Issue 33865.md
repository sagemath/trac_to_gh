On `fedora-35-standard` (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/7141170218?check_suite_focus=true - with system flint 2.8.4)

`@`fredrik.johansson - is it intended that arb requires flint 2.9?
https://arblib.org/setup.html#dependencies says that flint 2.5 is enough

Now I see https://github.com/fredrik-johansson/arb/issues/431#issuecomment-1172025554, so apparently we need flint 2.9 for the arb upgrade. I'll split it out to a separate ticket, #34106
