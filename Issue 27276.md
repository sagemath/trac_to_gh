To fill the matrix, we just need a mapping from edges to integers. That's the easy part.

The hard parts are
- to check that the given list of edges is exactly the list of edges of the graph **without** sorting (Python 3)
- to decide what to do if the input list of edges has labels (raise an error or consider only the vertices)
- possibly to deal with multiple edges / loops. We can decide that the method works only for simple (di)graph
