# Issue 27276: Allow custom order for edges as well as vertices for incidence matrix

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27513

Original creator: kcrisman

Original creation time: 2019-03-19 17:44:42

See [this SO question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55073473/how-to-specify-the-vertice-order-and-the-edge-order-when-obtaining-the-incidence), where the question is how to use `incidence_matrix` in such a way as to order the vertices _and_ the edges as desired.  One can specify vertex order, but not edges.

To fill the matrix, we just need a mapping from edges to integers. That's the easy part.

The hard parts are
- to check that the given list of edges is exactly the list of edges of the graph **without** sorting (Python 3)
- to decide what to do if the input list of edges has labels (raise an error or consider only the vertices)
- possibly to deal with multiple edges / loops. We can decide that the method works only for simple (di)graph

Changing status from new to needs_review.

This should do the job. Note that edges are considered without labels. It is possible to change that if needed.

You can now give edges with labels. This might ease the use of the method.

Moving tickets from the Sage 8.8 milestone that have been actively worked on in the last six months to the next release milestone (optimistically).

LGTM.

On a followup ticket, I might consider adding a `check` parameter to both this and the vertices input for the users who know what they are doing and need the extra speed.
