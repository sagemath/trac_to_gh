In examples like this:

```
sage: f(x)=matrix()
sage: bool(f(x)-f(x)==0)
...
TypeError: mutable matrices are unhashable
```

the `f(x)` is expanded into a mutable matrix, but this prevents evaluation because Pynac is called by `Expression._sub_` and wants to do hashes on the matrix for comparison reasons. However, for the purpose of subtraction dealing with a mutable matrix is completely unnecessary. So a solution would be to turn mutable objects immutable before doing arithmetics in `Expression` or in Pynac.

This is quite funny. By chance I hit on the real bug with this issue (note that `f(x)+1` and `f(x)^1` will work) in Pynac. No fiddling with mutable/immutable necessary it seems. Investigating.
