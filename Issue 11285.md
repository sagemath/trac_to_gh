roed314:  the coercion system catches other problems and doesn't forward them all on
your real problem is:
100         return x[0]
   101     if n>0:
--> 102         divs = divisors(n)
   103         dict = {}
   104         wn = 0

NameError: global name 'divisors' is not defined
you need to import divisors from sage.rings.arith
 
me:  so you have to do like nn=Integer(n)
nn.divisors()

roed314:  that would work too
then you have to import Integer
from sage.rings.integer

Does coercion from the integers into a ring of Witt Vectors work right?  What is the image of p?

Coercion is not implemented. I'd also like to implement coercions for padics but I first need to deal with this division by p thing. 

Also, I have some modifications that It won't let me refresh. I'm having trouble with these "phases". It's not letting me refresh the patch

```
(sage-sh) tdupu@tdupu-Gazelle-Professional:sage-oms$ hg qrefresh
abort: cannot refresh immutable revision
(see "hg help phases" for details)
```


I tried modifying my .hg/hgrc in my working branch of sage ~/sage-whatever like so 

```
[phases]
publish = False
```

this isn't working.

There are at least two issues with this implementation of Witt vectors:

1) The Frobenius map on the Witt vectors doesn't just take the p-th power of every coordinate. This is only true if p = 0 in the base ring.

2) The definition of Witt vector addition and multiplication through the ghost components don't work over a ring where p isn't invertible (or at least a non-zero divisor). This is why every time this definition is used to actually define the Witt vectors, it is accompanied by a functoriality condition.

I fear that fixing the issues requires rewriting the methods from scratch.

I am also wondering whether anything speaks against implementing Witt vectors for general nests as well (including the nest of all positive integers, leading to "big Witt vectors").

darij actually means in characteristic p base ring. The correct form of the p-frobenius has the ghost component equation

w_{n}(f_p) = w_{n+1} 

See Hazewinkel (5.27).

The following two suggestions have been made:

1) Implementing a division by  ` p^n ` function. This is just a morphism of modules from ` p^{n} R ` to  ` R/ann(p^{n} ) ` . 

2) Implementing a lifting function. If R has the form ` A/p^n A ` then we would like a function which takes elements of A to elements in ` A/p^{n+1} A `.

I'm not sure what you mean here. Could you explain more or provide a link? Suggestions for implementations of Witt-Burnside functors are also welcome.

Hi Taylor,

>

I don't think any of these would help compute Witt vector addition over an arbitrary commutative ring. When you take ghost components over a ring in which p is a zero-divisor, you lose information; you can't gain it back by lifting as far as I know.

What I meant by "big Witt vectors" are Witt vectors that are not p-typical (Section 9 of Hazewinkel). We should be able to use some of the extensive symmetric functions implementation we have in Sage (including Witt coordinates since #14775). While I'd love to play around with Witt-Burnside, too, I don't know enough about this generalization to implement it well (though I can learn).

When you say "specifying a particular p", does p mean the polynomial or the prime? It might be interesting to do it on a generic polynomial, though I wasn't thinking of that; having addition, negation and multiplication would already be a wonderful start.

Best regards,\\
Darij

Here are some suggested that I'm copy-pasting from the emails to fix the division problems. The formatting is a little weird, but I think people can read it if they need to. Here is the link to the symmetric polynomials patch that darij wrote http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14775


FIRST IMPLEMENTATION: Try the "lifting and dividing" procedure. I have broken it up into subcases. Are there other objects we could consider? 

Here are the cases we could consider: 

```
A) finitely generated rings over ZZ (may not be implemented). This could be maybe broken into two subcases, 
  1) Rings in which p is a zero divisor (may not be implemented)
      i) Rings for which p is nilpotent (these are just finitely generated algebras over ZZ/p^n, and 
       we can do computations with lifts as it is well defined.)
      ii) Ring for which p is not nilpotent (this may be hard, I need to think about this too)
  2) Rings in which p is a non-zero divisor
B) Finite Fields. (could be coerced into case A?) 
C) p-Adic Rings. (we could probably use case A here but I'm not too familiar with this. )
D) Domains. 
```


TODO:


```
*Implement the control flow suggested above. 
*Implement the frobenius correction.
*Re A.1.ii) Rings where p is a zero divisor but not nilpotent could be tricky too since division by p could be really messed up. For example division by powers of p in the ring ZZ[x,p]/(p^5 x) or lifts of it could be totally nasty. 
*Re A.1.i) We need to check that two functions are implemented.
--A lifting function which lifts an element of a ring mod p^n to an element of a ring mod p^{m} where m>n
--A division function which is a map from an element of p^n A to A/ann(p^n). 
*We should also clarify where these functions should be implemented within sage. For example, the lifting procedure would probably be useful outside of the witt vectors code. 
*Is sage coercion to finitely generated ZZ algebras working? For example, if we implemented to code on the level of finitely generated ZZ-algebras, then ran it on GF(4)[x]/(x^4+x) would it work? Should we care?

```



SECOND IMPLEMENTATION: 
I thought about it and I like the symmetric polynomials/generating function identities approach to Witt sum and multiplication polynomials/rules. I think working with just the big Witt vectors is a good first step for the applications we have in mind. 

Recall:

{{
-There is an injective functorial group homomorphism from the Ring of big Witt vectors (viewed as tuples in the usual way) to the ring of power series 1+tA[This is the Trac macro *t* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#t-macro) given by 
(x_1, x_2,...) maps to prod_i (1-x_i t<sup>i)</sup>{-1}.
Recall that the multiplication structure on the power series is induced from the rule
(1-xt)<sup>{-1}*(1-yt)</sup>{-1} = (1-xyt)^{-1}
Together with the identity 
Prod (1- x_i t<sup>i)</sup>{-1} = Prod (1-y_i t)^{-1}
That is, we views the x_i's as symmetric polynomials in y_i's and derive the rule by rewriting the final product in terms of elementary symmetric polynomials. 
The addition rule is just usual power series multiplication.
}}

At any rate, I think the suggestion of Darij is as follows: use the isomorphism between power series functor and the big Witt functor to derive the sum and addition polynomials. I outline it the idea for the multiplication polynomials


```
1) the isomorphism between the big Witt vectors and power series tells is that the image of 
(x_1,x_2,...)*(y_1,y_2,...)=(m_1,m_2,...)
under the homomorphism will be
 Prod(1-m_it^i)^{-1}.
We can expand this out to get
 1 + c_1(m) t + c_2(m) t^2 + ....
where m = (m_1,m_2,....) are the witt multiplication polynomials and c_j(m) is a simple polynomial we can write down (and have a simple closed form expression of --- it is the sum of terms m_1^{j_1} m_2^{j_2} ... where j_1 + 2j_2 + ... = j )
2) If we consider the x_i's and y_i's as elementary symmetric polynomials in auxiliary variables z_i and w_i so that
prod_i 1/(1-x_i t^i) = \prod_i 1/(1-w_i t)
\prod_i 1/(1-y_i t^i) = \prod_i 1/(1-z_i t)
then the product \prod 1/(1-w_iz_i t) can be expanded and then since it is symmetric the coefficients of the expansion can be written as a symmetric functions in w_i and z_i (ie polyns in x_i and y_i):
  prod_i 1/(1-x_it^i) prod_i 1/(1-y_i t^i) = 1 + M_1(x,y) t + M_2(x,y)t^2 +....
where M_1,M_2, ... are explicitly computable. 
3) I think what darij proposed is to use the identities
 c_i(m) = M_i(x,y)
to solve for m_1, m_2, ... 

```


Am I stating this correct? Are there simplifications that one can make in doing this? I haven't tried to do this in sage so I don't know if solving these equations is actually faster than solving for the witt addition and multiplication polynomials "by hand". Is there a simpler way of factoring these power series?

I have been working an implementation of Witt vectors using Luis Finotti's work in  [this paper](https://web.math.utk.edu/~finotti/papers/witt.pdf). I'd like to take over this ticket and begin merging this work, but I want to be careful about credit. Also, I'm new to the Trac server, and don't want to make changes hastily.

If/when I accept this ticket, should I change the "Authors" field to just my name? Or my name *and* the previous authors? I'm not really building on the previous work (as I've just discovered it).

Good questions!  Two thoughts.
* First, the "Author" field really is about who writes the final version that goes in.  So the author can change over time, and if you end up starting from scratch, then maybe you'd be sole author.  For now we can even just leave it blank, obviously this ticket has languished.
