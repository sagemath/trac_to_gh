# Issue 25650: Add dependencies to p_group_cohomology

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25887

Original creator: SimonKing

Original creation time: 2018-07-20 11:37:34

Keywords: p_group_cohomology singular dependency

When installing the singular spkg, the folder `$SAGE_SHARE/singular/` is completely overridden. However, `p_group_cohomology` installs two .lib files into that folder. So, singular must be listed as a dependency for p_group_cohomology, so that it will be rebuilt after each upgrade of singular.

Also it adds some files into `$SAGE_SHARE/sage/ext/gap/modular_cohomology`, but (as I just tested) re-installing GAP preserves that folder.

So, I suggest adding just singular to the dependency list of p_group_cohomology.

Now optional packages are also release blockers...

This is causing breakage on one of the patchbots. So it should be a blocker indeed.

Causing breakage in a patchbot that tests this particular optional package, perhaps?

Yes, obviously.
