Assignee: @craigcitro

CC:  sage-combinat

Keywords: categories, abelian varieties

Before the patch, the following was wrong (probably introduced by #9138):

```
    sage: End(J0(37)).homset_category()
    Join of Category of hom sets in Category of sets and Category of rings
```


After the patch:

```
    sage: End(J0(37)).homset_category()
    Category of modular abelian varieties over Rational Field
```


In both cases, we have, as desired:

```
    sage: End(J0(37)).category()
    Join of Category of hom sets in Category of sets and Category of rings
```


By the way, this removes a direct call to _Hom_, using Hom instead, preparing for #11935.

Note: #11935 depends on this ticket.
