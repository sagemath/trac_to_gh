# Issue 31181: Incorrect (Maxima) symbolic sum

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31418

Original creator: charpent

Original creation time: 2021-02-20 10:45:59

See this `ask.sagemath.org` [question](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/55766/a-simple-sum-causes-division-by-zero-exception/) for details.

```
sage: sum((1+r)^i, i, 1, n)
((r + 1)^(n + 1) - r - 1)/r
```


which is incorrect if `r==0`.


`Mathematica` faills in the same trap :

```
sage: sum((1+r)^i, i, 1, n, algorithm="mathematica")
((r + 1)^n - 1)*(r + 1)/r
```


Workaround : use `sympy` algorithm :

```
sage: sum((1+r)^i, i, 1, n, algorithm="sympy")
cases(((r + 1 == 1, n), (1, ((r + 1)^(n + 1) - r - 1)/r)))
```

I don't think the simplification is actually a bug, because the result is equal to the sum as a symbolic expression, so the code is behaving as advertised. More precisely, [the rule in ginac](https://www.ginac.de/tutorial/#Automatic-evaluation) is that a simplification can be made if it is "algebraically correct, possibly except for a set of measure zero (e.g. x/x is transformed to 1 although this is incorrect for x=0)".

The user in this particular `ask.sagemath.org` question, seems to be interested in numerical calculations, rather than symbolic manipulations, so perhaps they should have defined a python function, instead of using a symbolic expression.

However, I agree that it would be good to have a way to evaluate the symbolic expression at `r = 0` (without having to take a limit).

Moving to 9.4, as 9.3 has been released.
