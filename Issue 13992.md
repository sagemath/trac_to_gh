Keywords: abelian group subgroups invfac one

In Sage 5.7:

```
sage: A = AbelianGroup([2,1])
sage: A
Multiplicative Abelian group isomorphic to C2 x C1
sage: A.subgroups()
[Multiplicative Abelian subgroup isomorphic to C2 generated by {f0},
 Trivial Abelian subgroup]

sage: B = AbelianGroup([1,2])
sage: B
Multiplicative Abelian group isomorphic to C1 x C2
sage: B.subgroups()
Vectors not LI:  [[0, 0], [0, 1]]
...
ValueError: The given basis vectors must be linearly independent.
```


This last command should work just as well as A.subgroups().

```

In Sage 5.6, it was still:

```
sage: A = AbelianGroup([2,1])
sage: A
Multiplicative Abelian Group isomorphic to C2
sage: A.subgroups()
[Multiplicative Abelian Group isomorphic to C2, which is the subgroup of
Multiplicative Abelian Group isomorphic to C2
generated by [f], Trivial Abelian Group, which is the subgroup of
Multiplicative Abelian Group isomorphic to C2
generated by []]
sage: B = AbelianGroup([1,2])
sage: B
Multiplicative Abelian Group isomorphic to C2
sage: B.subgroups()
[Multiplicative Abelian Group isomorphic to C2, which is the subgroup of
Multiplicative Abelian Group isomorphic to C2
generated by [f], Trivial Abelian Group, which is the subgroup of
Multiplicative Abelian Group isomorphic to C2
generated by []]
```

I think the situation in Sage 5.7 is an improvement, except of course for the failure to compute `B.subgroups()`.
