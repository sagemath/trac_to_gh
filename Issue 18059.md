# Issue 18059: Emphasize that Graph.subgraph_search ignores edge labels

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18296

A post on sage-support [1] reported that the `subgraph_search` functions ignored edge labels, despite claiming the opposite.

Indeed, the common terminology of "labelled copies" and "unlabelled copies" is pretty misleading with respect to actual labels on the edge/vertices of the graph. With this branch, I hope to make this mistake less likely.

`aglgorithm` -> `algorithm`

otherwise, the patch seems OK

For me the patch is good to go (install, doctest, docbuild, etc.).

I don't see how it was caused by this branch, but indeed there is a mistake `O_o`
