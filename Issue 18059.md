A post on sage-support [1] reported that the `subgraph_search` functions ignored edge labels, despite claiming the opposite.

Indeed, the common terminology of "labelled copies" and "unlabelled copies" is pretty misleading with respect to actual labels on the edge/vertices of the graph. With this branch, I hope to make this mistake less likely.
