`ore_algebra` 0.3 is not working with Sage for a wile and upstream does not release versions anymore. Hence, we should stop shipping a broken package and fetch `ore_algebra` directly from upstream.

I don't see how premise (A) implies conclusion (B). There are other packages that don't have releasea and which are still packaged normally.

New version: `ore_algebra` 0.4 was released on 2019-05-17.

Can someone test whether it installs and works with current Sage?

Changing keywords from "" to "upgrade, ore_algebra".

Why remove the package instead of upgrading, as Samuel proposed?

It is an external package with a dependency on Sage. I think people should install it from pip or whatever they like; I don't see the point of having it as a Sage package. And while I try to make sure that the master branch always works with the latest Sage release, the Sage package is broken half of the time. If someone wants to take care of it on a regular basis (and bug Manuel to tag a point release every time something breaks), that's fine with me of course, but that hasn't been the case in the last few years.

There are many packages for which this argument could be made, but we still ship them as Sage packages. The advantages of having a Sage package are user friendliness (`sage -i ore_algebra` works) and automatic updates with version checking.

But not everybody uses the latest Sage release. You may break stuff if a newer version of `ore_algebra` doesn't work with an older version of Sage.

If it works, yes, except that I personally consider `sage -i` a strictly less user-friendly option than `sage -pip install` (< `pip install` < `apt install`).

Yes, of course. I'm alking about the master branch... Fwiw I also try to keep it compatible with earlier versions when that's easy to do.

(If anyone really considers it important to have ore_algebra as a Sage package, feel free to revert my changes to this ticket.)

PS regarding Thierry's version: I personally don't like the idea of a “package” that actually installs a version that was not checked by the packager, but I won't argue if people want that.

So: If someone prefers the status quo or Thierry's original solution to removing the package, could you please state it clearly? Otherwise, this should be an easy review... Thanks!

Moving tickets from the Sage 8.8 milestone that have been actively worked on in the last six months to the next release milestone (optimistically).
