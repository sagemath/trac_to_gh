# Issue 24088: manifolds: failing tests in options

When the untested examples in `src/sage/manifolds/manifold.py` involving `GlobalOptions` are actually tested:

```
sage -t src/sage/manifolds/manifold.py
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/manifolds/manifold.py", line 1802, in sage.manifolds.manifold.TopologicalManifold.options
Failed example:
    f
Expected:
    D[0](g)(x, y) + D[1](g)(x, y)
Got:
    diff(g(x, y), x) + diff(g(x, y), y)
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/manifolds/manifold.py", line 1804, in sage.manifolds.manifold.TopologicalManifold.options
Failed example:
    latex(f)
Expected:
    D[0]\left(g\right)\left(x, y\right) + D[1]\left(g\right)\left(x, y\right)
Got:
    \frac{\partial}{\partial x}g\left(x, y\right) + \frac{\partial}{\partial y}g\left(x, y\right)
**********************************************************************
```

Argh, I realize I should have based this on the branch of #24322. I'll do it later.

This should be OK now.

Can you explain a bit why simply changing the doctest is the right thing to do here? Why should the output be changed?

Replying to [comment:6 jdemeyer]:

After some Pynac update in Sage 7.4 (cf. #21286), there has been a change of notation for the display of derivatives of Sage's symbolic functions: `D[0](f)(x,y)` has become `diff(f(x,y), x)`. Hence it suffices to update the output of the doctest.
