In analogy to #19791:

```
sage: tanh(1+2*I).n()
1.16673625724092 - 0.243458201185725*I
sage: tanh(1+2*I).real().n()
0.202053272732553
sage: tanh(1+2*I).imag().n()
-0.579697798322816
sage: tanh(x).real()
tanh(real_part(x))/(tan(imag_part(x))^2*tanh(real_part(x))^2 + 1)
sage: tanh(x).imag()
tan(imag_part(x))/(tan(imag_part(x))^2*tanh(real_part(x))^2 + 1)
```

Will be fixed in Pynac-0.6.3 and should be doctested here.
