The problem seems to come from the following lines in the definition of `NumberFieldElement_quadratic._randomize()` in `src/sage/rings/number_field/number_field_element_quadratic.pyx`, which set the default denominator bound to be 1.

```
# normalize denominator bound
if den_bound is None or den_bound < 1:
    den_bound = 1
```

The problem goes away if an explicit denominator bound is specified:

```
sage: K = QuadraticField(2)                                                            
sage: for _ in range(5): 
....:     print(K.random_element(den_bound=10)) 
-1/4*a + 3/5
1/8*a - 1
-1/10*a - 4/7
-6/7*a + 391/5
-9/2
```

```

This is a nice improvement.

There is one problem (see **a** below).

My other comments and suggestions (see **b** to **e** below) 
can be ignored or kept for later.

**a.**

The tests blocks in `_randomize` are missing the double-colon.


**b.**

Suggestion: state one can pick random integral elements
by setting `den_bound` to one.

This could be added to the examples:


```
    With denominator bound one, we always get integral elements::

        sage: K = QuadraticField(2)
        sage: uu = [K.random_element(den_bound=1) for _ in range(5)]
        sage: uu  # random
        [0, a + 2, -12*a - 2, -a + 1, -a - 2]
        sage: all(u.is_integral() for u in uu)
        True
```


This could be added to the tests:


```
    With denominator bound one, we always get integral elements::

        sage: def random_number_field(max_degree=3):
        ....:     R.<x> = ZZ[]
        ....:     p = x^2
        ....:     while not p.is_irreducible():
        ....:         d = ZZ.random_element(2, max_degree + 1)
        ....:         p = x^d + R.random_element(degree=(0, d - 1))
        ....:     return NumberField(p, 'a')
        sage: all(u.is_integral()
        ....:     for _ in range(10)
        ....:     for K in [random_number_field(max_degree=8)]
        ....:     for u in [K.random_element(den_bound=1)])
        True

    Without this constraint, we don't always get them::

        sage: all(u.is_integral()
        ....:     for _ in range(100)
        ....:     for K in [random_number_field(max_degree=8)]
        ....:     for u in [K.random_element()])
        False
```


**c.**

One test builds a quadratic field using a random nonsquare in `[-100 .. 99]`:


```
        sage: non_squares = [a for a in srange(-100, 100) if not a.is_square()]
        sage: K = QuadraticField(non_squares[randint(0, len(non_squares)-1)])
```


Here are some alternative ways to pick a random quadratic field.

We can use `random.choice` to select a list element at random:

```
        sage: import random
        sage: non_squares = [a for a in srange(-100, 100) if not a.is_square()]
        sage: K = QuadraticField(random.choice(non_squares))
```


Or skip building a list by picking at random until we are happy:

```
        sage: a = ZZ.random_element(-100, 100)
        sage: while a.is_square():
        ....:     a = ZZ.random_element(-100, 100)
        sage: K = QuadraticField(a)
```


**d.**

One test checks that five random elements are pairwise distinct:


```
        sage: n = 5
        sage: randlist = [K.random_element() for _ in range(n)]
        sage: all(randlist[i] != randlist[j] for i in range(n) for j in range(n)
        ....:     if i != j)
        True
```


Here are alternative ways to write the test.

Have `j` run through `range(i)`:

```
        sage: n = 5
        sage: uu = [K.random_element() for _ in range(n)]
        sage: all(uu[i] != uu[j] for i in range(n) for j in range(i))
        True
```


Use `enumerate`:

```
        sage: n = 5
        sage: uu = [K.random_element() for _ in range(n)]
        sage: all(ui != uj for i, ui in enumerate(uu) for uj in uu[:i])
        True
```


Use a set:

```
        sage: n = 5
        sage: len(set(K.random_element() for _ in range(n)) == n
        True
```


**e.**

The documentation could also mention one can pick random integral
elements using the `random_element` method of the number field's
"ring of integers" or "maximal order".


```
sage: K = QuadraticField(2)
sage: O = K.maximal_order()
sage: O.random_element()  # random
5*a - 6
sage: O = K.ring_of_integers()
sage: O.random_element()  # random
-4*a + 1
```
