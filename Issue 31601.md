No changes in gfortran runtime, so it should be OK even for upgrades.

This fixes a problem I had with compiling sage-9.3 on Catalina. My compilation kept hanging while installing gsl-2.6 (both while upgrading, and compiling from a fresh clone). For more information, see: https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/6DN-Aiem23U/m/oENEbMywAwAJ

is your Xcode up to date?

Xcode seems to be up to date (i.e., Software Update doesn't propose any updates other than suggesting that I update to Big Sur).
