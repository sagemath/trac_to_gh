Note that the following packages are required:

sudo apt-get install texlive-full pandoc

surely thats a docker build issue and not a release blocker

Changing priority from blocker to major.

See also: #29124 - which collects lists of recommended system packages - which should probably be made available in Docker builds

Is anyone planning to take care of the Docker build for 9.1?
