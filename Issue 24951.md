CC:  @embray

It seems that `DUMMY_PACKAGES` in `build/make/Makefile` no longer works correctly.

`build/make/Makefile` contains

```
DUMMY_PACKAGES = \
    gcc \
    gfortran \
    git \
```


Despite this, a normal build rule for `gfortran` is generated. Partial output of `make -f build/make/Makefile -n DEBUG_RULES=1`:

```
$(INST)/gfortran-7.2.0:   /bin/gcc  |  $(inst_mpir)  $(inst_mpfr)  $(inst_mpc)  $(inst_zlib)  $(inst_xz)
        +sage-logger -p '$(SAGE_SPKG) gfortran-7.2.0' '$(SAGE_LOGS)/gfortran-7.2.0.log'

gfortran: $(INST)/gfortran-7.2.0

gfortran-clean:
        rm -rf $(INST)/gfortran-7.2.0
```

This is causing build failures because `gcc` is also installed.

I think the problem has more to do with the oddities of how gcc is being handled, especially since #24703.

I was confused because you wrote that "gcc is also installed", but in your Makefile it has `gcc` in `DUMMY_PACKAGES` implying that it was not selected for installation.  Yet all the packages have `$(SAGE_LOCAL)/bin/gcc` as dependencies implying that it was installed at some point.

I think that what #24703 missed is that even if `$SAGE_INSTALL_GCC = exists` it needs to be setting `needs_to_install_gcc = yes` (this doesn't actually mean it will reinstall gcc if it isn't necessary to--this just means gcc is selected for possible installation in Sage, pending checking of its prerequisites by make).   Since that isn't happening, the build system gets into a funny state where Sage's gcc *is* installed, but the build system doesn't really think it should be.

Yes, I meant "gcc has been installed at some point in the past". `configure` correctly detects that `gfortran` should not be installed, but it's still being installed anyway.

It's resolving the thing I at least thought you were confused about.

Say you want to install gcc in Sage (whether explicitly, or by requirement of configure):


```
$ SAGE_INSTALL_GCC=yes ./configure
```


then `./configure` correctly outputs:


```
checking package versions...
...
    gcc-7.2.0
...
```


Then you install the gcc SPKG (explicitly or otherwise):


```
$ make gcc
```


And in the Makefile you see


```
BUILT_PACKAGES =\
...
gcc \
...
```


and


```
DUMMY_PACKAGES = \
    curl \
    gfortran \
    git \
```


However, if you then re-run `./configure` (without explicitly supplying `SAGE_INSTALL_GCC=yes`):


```
checking package versions...
...
    gcc-7.2.0 not installed (configure check)
...
```


it now says gcc spkg will not be installed (even though it is in fact already installed, and should continue to be installed).  Furthermore this means:


```
DUMMY_PACKAGES = \
    curl \
    gcc \
    gfortran \
    git \
```


so the stamp file for the gcc spkg is now `$SAGE_SPKG_INST/.dummy` and not the real stamp file for the actual installed gcc.  This obviously isn't the intended behavior, nor the behavior for any other package.  This bug is just unique to the gcc package because of how its installation state is being managed by the configure script.
