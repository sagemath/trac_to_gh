Hey Ben,

One small doc thing slipped past me in the new patch; on line 18, you have

```
    Does not work with :funct:`TensorProductOfCrystals`.
```


but the link should be `:func:`TensorProductOfCrystals``. Could you repost the patch with this change please?

Thanks,

Travis

Hi Ben,

I just pushed some changes to your patch to the sage-combinat queue (since there were trailing white spaces). Please pull from there to get them .

Also, for the very last method "subcrystal" could you please add a description.

Other than that the patch looks good to me. Once you make the change and are happy with my changes, please upload on trac and set a positive review on my behalf!

Anne

The LaTeX PDF documentation still fails to build:

```

\math`@`cr`@``@``@` ...`@` \`@`ne \add`@`amps \maxfields`@` \omit
                                                  \kern -\alignsep`@` \iftag`@` ...
l.96848 \end{gather}

?
! Emergency stop.

The problem was that the pdf docbuild did not like the `align*` environment inside of a `.. MATH::` but the html build worked just fine with this. This has been fixed for sure now.
