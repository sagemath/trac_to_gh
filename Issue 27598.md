Complete nitpick/bikeshedding, but I think it sends a nice visual cue:

```diff
             NotImplementedError: cannot differentiate airy_ai
-            in the first parameter
+             in the first parameter
```
in all applicable places. Once changed, you can set a positive review on my behalf.
