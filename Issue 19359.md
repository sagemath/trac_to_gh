This happened for 'staticmethod' imported from another module. Before


```
sage: from sage.misc.rest_index_of_methods import list_of_subfunctions
sage: class A:
....:     x = staticmethod(Graph.order)
....:     
sage: list_of_subfunctions(A)
([], {})
```


After


```
sage: list_of_subfunctions(A)
([<unbound method Graph.order>], {<unbound method Graph.order>: 'x'})
```
