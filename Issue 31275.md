Keywords: graded quasimodular forms gsoc2021

The goal of this ticket is to implement the ring of graded quasimodular forms as there are no such functionality in [SageMath](SageMath) (as of v9.2). More precisely, the goal is to first implement a class named `QuasiModularFormsRing` with similar methods and feature as the class `ModularFormsRing`. Second, it would be desirable to implement the Block-Okounkov bracket that, given a shifed symmetric polynomial, produces a quasimodular form.

This initial implementation is really "primitive" and work only for the full modular groups. However, it would be great to support quasimodular forms for higher level congruence subgroups.

This is my first ticket for a new enhancement, so any comments and insight about how to correctly do this is more than welcome.

Hi David,

Great start.

Let us stick to `SL(2,Z)` in this ticket. Further improvements (other congruence subgroups, Bloch-Okounkov brackets should be reserved for other tickets).

Some concrete remarks
- `QuasiModularFormsRing` could simply be `QuasiModularForms`
- The main class should inherit from `Parent` and the category should be properly initialized, see https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/thematic_tutorials/coercion_and_categories.html
- The objective is to manipulate exact formal objects. Not approximate q-series. The following operations should be available on the elements
  - equality tests between two qm-forms
  - decomposition of a qm-form with respect to the grading (ie by level)
  - testing modularity
  - computing the q-series expansion of a qm-form (arbitrary precision)
  - multiplication by a modular form (maybe the simplest to achieve this is to define qm-forms as an algebra over modular forms?)
  - (further ticket) computing algebraic or differential equations (for that purpose it is necessary to have formal derivatives, not the derivative of the q-expansion)
  - (further ticket) asymptotics of coefficients
- The following methods should be available on the parent (the algebra itself)
  - vector space basis of a given graded component
  - basis and generators up to modular forms

This

```
        if not self._polynomial.degree():
            return self._polynomial[0].is_modular_form()
        else:
            return False
```
is equivalent to

```
return not self._polynomial.degree() and self._polynomial[0].is_modular_form()
```


Why do you store base ring in the element (attribute `__base_ring`)? This would better be accessed through the parent. Note that `ModuleElement` has a default implementation of the method `base_ring` as

```
def base_ring(self):
    return self._parent.base_ring()
```
Also, since you inherit from `Parent`, there is already a slot dedicated to that. Namely `_base`. This is initialized inside the constructor

```
Parent.__init__(self, base=..., category=...)
```
So : remove `__base_ring` from both `QuasiModularForms` and `QuasiModularFormsElement`.
(I believe the same could be done for modular forms. But leave that to another ticket)
