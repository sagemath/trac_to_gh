It already states explicitly that the command creates a merge, not a pull. Isn't that clear enough?

This section of the manual appears at the very end and is solely about reviewing tickets. I'd rather not complicate the review process by explaining too much about other operations. To that end, I've replaced `git trac checkout` here with a link to the appropriate section above in the manual. Since #22451 is now in the current beta, I've also added a link to it in the section of this manual on merging. More appropriate there than here because there is already some information on updating Sage to its most current version.
