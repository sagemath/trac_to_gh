```
+ If you want to edit the ticket branch (that is, add additional commits) you cannot
+ use ``git trac try``. You must use ``git trac checkout`` to get the actual ticket
+ branch as a starting point.
```

We could mention the new section introduced in #22451 to say something on how to continue working on an existing ticket.

Maybe: Should it be stated somewhere, what `git trac try` actually does in terms of the usual git commands? (Maybe, mentioning that it is similar to `git pull` could suffice.)

It already states explicitly that the command creates a merge, not a pull. Isn't that clear enough?

This section of the manual appears at the very end and is solely about reviewing tickets. I'd rather not complicate the review process by explaining too much about other operations. To that end, I've replaced `git trac checkout` here with a link to the appropriate section above in the manual. Since #22451 is now in the current beta, I've also added a link to it in the section of this manual on merging. More appropriate there than here because there is already some information on updating Sage to its most current version.

Ok, I've reread the whole section, and it fits as it is now.

Fair enough.
