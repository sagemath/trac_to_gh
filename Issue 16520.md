# Issue 16520: Organize the V(m,t) vectors into a dictionary

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16757

Original creator: ncohen

Original creation time: 2014-08-04 15:55:35

CC:  vdelecroix

There are many Vmt vectors coming, and while the data of a Vmt is only <20 integers, adding one in Sage takes a total of 40 lines of code, because of the doc and everything (aways copy/pasted).

With this patch, all the V(m,t) vectors are now contained in a dictionary, and adding one takes 3 lines (one for the integers, one for the bibliographical reference, and one for the index at the top of the file).

1) The documentation in the dictionary is a bit strange... but it is modified in #16763. So it is fine for me as I will review the latter in a minute.

2) There is no need for an empty function to have a doctest. In `u/vdelecroix/16757` I removed it and use a string alone. Drawback: there will be some conflict with #16763.

Beyond that it is fine... and could go to positive review.

Yep, sorry for that ! I got an email from Julian about those references after submitting that commit.

No prob, shouldn't be hard to fix. Thanks again !
