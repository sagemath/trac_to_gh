Keywords: Dirichlet character Bernoulli number

If `chi` is the trivial Dirichlet character, then `chi.bernoulli(1)` returns different results depending on the algorithm:

```
sage: chi = DirichletGroup(1)[0]
sage: chi.bernoulli(1)  # algorithm='recurrence'
-1/2
sage: chi.bernoulli(1, algorithm='definition', cache=False)
1/2
```

The documentation is consistent with the answer `1/2`.  The answer `-1/2` can be explained as being the result of

```
sage: bernoulli(1)
-1/2
```

since the `bernoulli()` function returns the traditional "first Bernoulli numbers".

We should decide which convention to use, and update the documentation if necessary.
