More likely something I did. I was having trouble building my local branch so I deleted it, created a new branch named '20830' and did a `git trac pull 20830` into it. After making changes I just did `git trac push` hoping that would be that but something went wrong.

Since all of the commits are there is it possible for you to get them into the proper branch?

Or if it's simpler for you, close this ticket and I'll create a new one.

there is certainly no need to create a new ticket. Even if you managed to destroy your local git repo somehow, one could (with "plain" git) cherry-pick your commits into a branch and push it, and then update (in the browser) the branch.
