I think it would be more useful for the user if you mentioned "Mac OS" somewhere.

I've updated the advisory to make it Mac specific, since Windows can't currently be used for building Sage.

The branch seems to be missing (perhaps an issue with our git server?)

More likely something I did. I was having trouble building my local branch so I deleted it, created a new branch named '20830' and did a `git trac pull 20830` into it. After making changes I just did `git trac push` hoping that would be that but something went wrong.

Since all of the commits are there is it possible for you to get them into the proper branch?

Or if it's simpler for you, close this ticket and I'll create a new one.

Just push the branch that has your patch on on it using "git trac push 20830"

there is certainly no need to create a new ticket. Even if you managed to destroy your local git repo somehow, one could (with "plain" git) cherry-pick your commits into a branch and push it, and then update (in the browser) the branch.

Thanks Dima, that did it! Learned something new about Git.

Could you or Matthias reset the positive review?
