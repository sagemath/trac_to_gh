Keywords: mixed_forms, manifolds

At this stage, the inequality comparison fails:

```
sage: M = Manifold(4, 'M')
sage: X.<x,y,z,t> = M.chart()
sage: Form0 = M.mixed_form(comp=([0,0,0,0,0]))
sage: Form1 = M.mixed_form(comp=([1,0,0,0,0]))
sage: Form0 != Form1
False
```


I already spotted the error: originally, `richcmp` is checked separately on each component and returns `False` if the check fails for at least one element. But for the inequality, it is enough when the check succeeds for at least one element because then both mixed forms are already unequal.

I will remove the method `_richcmp_` and replace it with `__eq__`. Since only `==` and `!=` are mathematically well-defined for mixed forms, this is perfectly fine.

This sounds like a good idea, except maybe when efficiency matters, like for `ManifoldPoint`, since points are parameters of `UniqueRepresentation` objects, namely tangent spaces.
