Hi Nathann,

What about #18246? Just returning `0` will create many collisions that will be hard to track. I think that raising an error is more appropriate because you know what is to be fixed.

If you see a way to turn #18246 into a `needs_review` ticket soon, then I do not mind. But I don't want to fight against 800 screaming guys again, and I want this to be solved.

What about a middle ground: raise a warning, which would appear only once, whenever this 0 hash function is used?

This is a very bad bug and it needs to be fixed. Creating tickets that we forget is nto much more responsible than doing nothing.

It is already a bit better.

It is.

I did not forget as you see ;-)

With your implementation, I am pretty sure that the running time of the tests will be much slower. Sage very often put elements in dictionaries or sets. Your solution does not help users to see that `__hash__` is important, because you will not run into bugs, just into very slow code. I agree that you fix the error but you open a much more annoying feature.

Remember that #18246 is not even about the hash function that I change here.

If you think that we can fix the bug *quickly* by removing the `__hash__` function from Element, then let us do that. If the result is that my ticket will be put "on hold" waiting for something that never happens (like it happened 4 months ago on #18246), then this ticket is better than an imaginary one.

Concerns about efficiency do not weight much compares to wrong results.

What is your position for "constant hash" Vs "we change nothing and the bug stays"? How many classes do you think would be broken (and would have to be fixed) if this hash is removed? Are you willing to help?

Often you can have normal forms on general grounds, so IMHO would be reasonable to just make `CanonicalRepresentation` a part of vector spaces and such. Thats why I said we shouldn't have to do it for every parent by hand. For most parents the `hash(repr(element))` is a good enough hash function. Sure you could make it faster by an overall constant factor, but its still gives you O(1) associative containers.

A little digging in Gap's FP compare functions [source](https://github.com/gap-system/gap/blob/master/lib/grpfp.gi#L236) shows that for finite finitely presented groups, our hash, given these definitions:

```
FamilyObj=libgap.function_factory("FamilyObj")
ElementsFamily=libgap.function_factory("ElementsFamily")
FPFaithHom=libgap.function_factory("FPFaithHom")
Image=libgap.function_factory("Image")
```

should probably look something like this:

```
sage: G=groups.presentation.Cyclic(4)
sage: f=FPFaithHom(ElementsFamily(FamilyObj(G.gap())))
sage: newhash=lambda a: hash(Image(f,a.gap()))
```

A little test:

```
sage: import collections
sage: L=[G.0^i for i in [-5..5]]
sage: collections.Counter(hash(a) == hash(b) for a in L for b in L if a==b)
Counter({False: 20, True: 11})

sage: collections.Counter(newhash(a) == newhash(b) for a in L for b in L if a!=b)

Just a small paranthesis: there are two very different things

1. Changing the **default** behavior of the hash function

2. Having a better hash for FP group elements

These deserve two tickets, don't you think? The initial purpose of the ticket was 1 and now you are mainly discussing 2. Could you open a ticket "better hash for FP Group element"?

Indeed, absolutely. And #18246 is now marked fixed. Another example is (of course) SR -- another ring where equality and normal form are impossible to resolve in general

```
sage: f=sin(x)^2

No, worse: any magma should have a decidable equality notion and a hash that's compatible with it. As we've already seen, the mathematical notion of equality in a magma need not be decidable. It makes no sense having a hash if you cannot test equality.

I think the proper solution is to lose this equality and hashing requirement and instead subclass to `MagmaWithDecidableEquality` and put the hash & equality stuff there (or do it via categories/axioms if you think that's more appropriate, but I'd rather avoid that if at all possible).

Is that attainable? Another possibility is to by default only test equality in the free structure covering the magma, i.e., "presentation equality". But that's going to be very confusing.

Nope. To fix just these `test_zero` and `test_one` one way is to allow to hash the unit but no other elements... does it look reasonable from the point of view of this ticket? Whether we want to do better looks for me as a part #19038.


New bad news: hashing of ideals. The `ResidueField` factory in `sage.rings.finite_rings.residue_field` uses as keys ideals that do not implement hashing. And I guess in most non trivial case having a hash value would be hard. For principal ideal, it is easy to test equality but much harder to implement a hash.

The branch must be based over #18246 (which is not yet merged). Otherwise it makes no sense!

I also did implement several hashes that I will add to the branch.

While going through the code I found

```
sage: M = MatrixSpace(GF(3),2,2).list()
sage: for m in M: m.set_immutable()
sage: len(M)
81
sage: len(set(map(hash,M)))
8
```

I opened #19050.

I don't think we have another option:
- testing if something is hashable doesn't test if something is mutable
- something that is immutable can be unhashable. Elements in monoids with an unsolved wordproblem are/should be examples of that
- python guidelines *say* that mutable elements should not be hashable, but this is not enforced.
- python simply doesn't provide a sure-fire way of testing if something is mutable.
- Note that even for properly hashable elements the internal data structure can still change (attributes, internal representation), as long as equality holds. But for reuse of elements those other attributes can still be important! So even hashability does not imply an element is safe for caching/reuse.
Feel free to extend the tests I've proposed. However, assuming 0 and 1 are hashable is not a good test for the stated goal.

I had hard time with `sage.structure.element_wrapper` which is intensively used in crystal code. The comparison code looks completely broken as I had to implement all the family of `__eq__`, `__ne__`, `__lt__`, etc as well as `__cmp__`.

I did not change any doctest in the code, but because I introduced many new functions some of them lack doctest.

The failing doctest in `parent.pyx` is very weird! The doctest expected a coercion

```
(matrix space over QQ, number field K) -> (matrix space over QQ)
```

but now it is

```
(matrix space over QQ, number field K) -> (matrix space over K)
```


The reason is that before we had (keeping the notation from the failing doctest)

```
sage: ma = a.matrix()
sage: cm = get_coercion_model()
sage: cm.get_action(ma.parent(), b.parent(), operator.mul, ma, b) is None
True
```

but with the patch applied

```
sage: cm.get_action(ma.parent(), b.parent(), operator.mul)
Right scalar multiplication by Number Field in b241562 with
  defining polynomial x^2 + 272118 on Full MatrixSpace of
  2 by 2 dense matrices over Rational Field
```

I'd be OK with that. When one ends up in  sage.structure.element.Element.__hash__ , performance will be down the drain anyway, and the warning only prints once.

Incidentally, the hash of symbolic expressions is *not* this one.

So resolving the title of the ticket will not address several of the perceived issues mentioned in the description.

Replying to [comment:70 vdelecroix]:
> The failing doctest in `parent.pyx` is very weird!
I agree. In fact, I believe the doctest is exposing current buggy behaviour and the changed behaviour on this ticket is resolving this behaviour.

Currently (on unpatched sage) we have

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2 + 2*3*7*11)
sage: M = parent(a.matrix())
sage: K_into_MS = K.hom([a.matrix()])
sage: K._unset_coercions_used()
sage: M.get_action(K)
Right scalar multiplication by Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^2 + 462 on Full MatrixSpace of 2 by 2 dense matrices over Rational Field
```

and

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2 + 2*3*7*11)
sage: M = parent(a.matrix())
sage: K_into_MS = K.hom([a.matrix()])
sage: K._unset_coercions_used()
sage: K.register_embedding(K_into_MS)
sage: M.get_action(K) is None
True
```

so adding an embedding (which adds edges to the coercion graph) prevents a discovery of an action! I don't think that can ever be OK. 

Also note that anything that requires `_unset_coercions_used` to be called is a hack (basically by definition).

So, I'm not so sure we should be trying to preserve this behaviour.

I appreciate your support ;-) Though, I would like to understand what is happening there. Why changing the hash of elements (not parents) should have something to do with coercions!?

Found it: the doctest is indeed broken.

The appropriate way to construct the field would be via

```
sage: Ktemp.<atemp> = NumberField(x^2 + 2*3*7*11)
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(atemp.minpoly(),embedding=atemp.matrix())
TypeError: <type 'sage.matrix.matrix_rational_dense.Matrix_rational_dense'> is not hashable and does not implement _cache_key()
```

which shows the real source of the change in behaviour: previously, the matrix used to define the embedding couldn't be used as a key in the `UniqueFactory` cache. On our very first commit, I introduce a `_cache_key` to compensate for the missing hash. So unhashable matrices can now be used as cache keys (but of course they shouldn't).

**Certificate:** You can toggle the behaviour by activating/deactivating the definition of _cache_key on Element.

So the doctest used to create a field that couldn't be directly constructed. With the introduced _cache_key, the field can be constructed.

During action discovery, the field does get reconstructed. This failed in an unexpected way before, which led to abandoning action discovery and then to using the specified embedding.

In our new setup, registering the embedding after the fact does not lead to breaking action discovery anymore, and hence we never get to using the embedding.

It is documented in `get_coercion_model().bin_op` that it first tries to find an action and then tries to find a coercion. So this doctest is relying on erroneous behaviour: There is an action between M and K, so the meaning of M.0 * K.0 is: let K.0 act on M.0, not "try to coerce K.0 into M and then multiply M.0 with the result".

**MAIN ACTION POINT:**: kill offending doctest.

Followup work to be done:
- do we want `_cache_key` on elements? For matrices, the implementation proposed here is robust (i.e., the key is basically what one could get from making an immutable copy of the thing).
- should embeddings take precedence over actions? I think that this would mean a horrible overhaul of the coercion framework, so I think the answer needs to be "no". People need to get used to the fact that implicit coercion can't do everything for you. Most of the time you're better of applying maps explicitly.

That's just because the matrix that is passed to "embedding" for the field that is reconstructed during action discovery is apparently newly constructed (probably it's `embedding_morphism(K.0)`) and hence mutable again (you can verify by adding `print self.is_mutable()` to `_cache_key`). So while you can make the field properly by passing an immutable (and hence hashable) matrix, stock sage still gives buggy behaviour, because subsequent coercion discovery tries to construct the field in an invalid way (and then eats the exception and abandons action discovery).

Can you give line numbers? I count only two definitions of `__hash__` in 
`src/sage/rings/polynomial/laurent_polynomial.pyx`, and they are on distinct classes:

```
sage.rings.polynomial.laurent_polynomial.LaurentPolynomial_mpair.__hash__
sage.rings.polynomial.laurent_polynomial.LaurentPolynomial_univariate.__hash__
```

respectively.

If `self.m` should be an `Integer` this is a good way of enforcing it. I don't think we did this before? perhaps this is covered in `element_class` already. I'm not familiar with this code (and didn't add that patch)

[duplicated __hash__ function](http://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/diff/src/sage/rings/polynomial/laurent_polynomial.pyx?id=0a2e3c93c5f5c2751aaf051c40ae6d8a199c3b3b&ss=1&context=20). I think the problem is that this `__hash__` is already included in Sage 6.10.beta0.

This seems like an argument for *not* adding the 0 hash to `Ideal_generic` then.

The only reason was some failing doctests. It appeared that most comparisons were not properly implemented in crystals. I do not care, but I did not find any simpler way to fix the doctests.

The best would be to implement an `ElementWrapper_with_cmp`.

As Jeroen points out, this ticket needs another merge/rebase. I know I would screw that up. Would you be able to do it? I'd be fully in favour if you'd also implement some of the suggested changes here in the process.

> I actually used some, for example in `crystals/elementary_crystals.py`. But I tend to agree with Nils that in most cases, this will be useless (or badly used).

I don't think you did. The `hash(self.parent())` is on `AbstractSingleCrystalElement` which has it `eq` defined as `self.parent() is other.parent()`, so making the hash equal to that of the parent is entirely justified there.

I think the `self.element_class(self, ZZ(m))` looks justifiable, so I'd be OK with leaving that in.

How about you try to reproduce it with said ticket, if you can get a new branch by tomorrow I can merge it.

Can you also fix the random failure at #19488

The doctest gets introduced on this ticket and it's a bad one: it's just comparing the parents, so the result is fundamentally ill-defined. Just delete the test (or check that it's not an error if you care about that behaviour. I'd say `cmp(b,1)` *should* yield an error).
