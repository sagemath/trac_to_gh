Keywords: meataxe random

I just noticed that, when meataxe is installed and its Sage wrapper is used for matrices over `GF(p^n)` with `p` odd and `p^n<255`, then at least in some cases the random matrices aren't sufficiently random:

```
sage: random_matrix(GF(9,'x'), 5)
[      x 2*x + 1   x + 2   x + 2       0]
[  x + 1       x   x + 2   x + 1       0]
[  x + 1       2   x + 1       2       0]
[      x     2*x       x   x + 1       0]
[2*x + 1       0 2*x + 1 2*x + 2       0]
sage: random_matrix(GF(9,'x'), 5)
[      2   x + 1   x + 1 2*x + 2       0]
[      x 2*x + 2   x + 2     2*x       0]
[  x + 2     2*x       0 2*x + 2       0]
[    2*x       2       2       1       0]
[  x + 2       2     2*x       1       0]
sage: random_matrix(GF(9,'x'), 5)
[      2 2*x + 1       x 2*x + 1       0]
[2*x + 2       0 2*x + 2       x       0]
[      2       x 2*x + 1   x + 2       0]
[      0 2*x + 1       x       x       0]
[      1       1       2   x + 1       0]
sage: random_matrix(GF(9,'x'), 5)
[      x   x + 1       0       0       0]
[      1   x + 1       0 2*x + 1       0]
[      2       0       x   x + 2       0]
[      2       0   x + 1   x + 2       0]
[      x   x + 1     2*x       1       0]
```

So, the last column always is zero, which shouldn't be the case.

The matrix entries are densely packed in meataxe. Hence, in some situations, the last byte of a row in memory is only partly filled with data. And in fact the HIGHEST bits of the last byte have to be filled.

The problem was: In the old code, the LOWEST bits of the last byte have been filled.

I fixed it by explicitly assigning random numbers to the last few entries (instead of trying to fill a whole block of entries).

Sooner or later this ticket needs to be merged with #21437. There is a merge conflict, and `git mergetool` doesn't work reasonably (namely: It shows me numerous conflicts, although the diff from this ticket is very small).

Therefore I will *rebase* this ticket on top of #21437 and force-push it.

Don't be scared. All but the last commit belong to #21437. Yes, I still believe that git commits *belong* to a ticket...

That's not quite what I said. I proposed to split up #21437. Adding more stuff to existing tickets (like this one) is actually the opposite of what I intented.

Do you prefer that I rebase again and split this ticket into three: One for the new MeatAxe patch (that avoids frequent calls to a C function and thus gives a speedup), one for the pickling and one for random matrices?

The first one is #23410.

The patches to be distributed are, as much as I see, independent. Would it be better to let the new tickets build upon each other (i.e., the git history of one ticket is included in the git history of the other tickets), or should they stay separate (i.e., each ticket provides a patch, and then they are merged only when needed)?

The ticket that is about sanitizing sig_on/off/check and about proper Cython code style has to depend on the other tickets. But I suggest to keep the other tickets separate as much as possible, and will soon push branches accordingly.

In the splitup process, I have already updated #23410, #23411 and #23352, making them small and independent.

About the other parts, I plan this:

- We have #21437 for proper initialisation. I plan to try to make this stand-alone as well, but only if it cleanly merges with the afore-mentioned tickets. If it doesn't merge, I'll put it on top of the other tickets.
- We have #23400 for code cleanup. The cleanup will also concern parts of code that are touched by the other tickets. So, it will use them as dependency.
- We have #23399 for some additions (new methods). I very much doubt that it can stay separate, but I'll try. Very likely #23399 will be on top of all other tickets.

Jeroen, do you support my plan?

If I'm reading the documentation at http://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/~MTX/doc24/group__ff.html correctly, it should be the LOWEST bytes:

Yes, that's what I had in mind, too, and is why I wrote the old code in the way I did. Anyway, I am now using meataxe's `FfInsert`, which should do the right thing.

Let's test: If I would set the last byte inconsistent with meataxe's conventions, then multiplying a matrix with the transposed matrix (these are all using meataxe functions) would give a wrong result. 

```
sage: MS = MatrixSpace(GF(9,'x'),1,5)
sage: def sanity_check(M):
....:     assert (M*M.transpose())[0,0] == add(e*e for e in M.list())
....:     
sage: while(1):
....:     sanity_check(MS.random_element())
....:     
```

works without error. Note that in the setting above, the new code is called. Thus, I believe my code is correct and indeed the meataxe documentation provides a wrong statement.
