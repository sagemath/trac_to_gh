Assignee: burcin

CC:  was eviatarbach

Currently simplify_rational() only offers 3 Maxima methods. GiNaC offers another possibility via its normal() method. This issue is discussed here

http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/843c17dcbd9c2958

I have a patch and a benchmark but need to redownload sage because I am getting unrelated doctest failures with or without the patch.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/10268

Okay, I've been contributing to the confusion. Now I see what you meant: When sage calls Pynac's normal() function, Pynac calls "its" gcd() function, which is actually sage's gcd() function. So, all the calls to gcd() are expected behavior, and the question becomes why doesn't Pynac get them over with and terminate in 30 seconds like GiNaC does with the CLN implementation of gcd()?

For reference when I switch on the statistics bookkeeping in the (latest) GiNaC source:

Okay, that is what is supposed to happen. With the current Pynac, I interrupt after an hour and


```
sage: quit;

```

So, it looks as if Pynac is hanging at or toward the end, and it experiences many more failures in the heur_gcd() routine. I guess I should be looking at the gcd heuristics then. Any ideas come to mind?

Bah, it was a bug in GiNaC that was fixed by this recent GiNaC commit

http://www.ginac.de/ginac.git?p=ginac.git;a=commit;h=edf1ae46a926d0a718063c149b78c1b9a7ec2043

I can bring the bug back by reverting it.

However, the patch touches code that was only added to the 1.5.x branch  of GiNaC, so we can't just apply that patch to the pynac spkg. I guess the logic that this patch fixes was also wrong somewhere in the 1.4.x branch of GiNaC. But I'm too tired and frustrated to look into it right now.

Sorry for the confusion. I meant to say gcd.

Now that there is a separate ticket for the bug in the pynac gcd, #10284, I will post my response to the other questions there.

Pynac's `normal()` was made accessible by `Expression` in #12068, so this patch can take advantage of it. The gcd error can be worked around optionally with Pynac-0.6.7 and libgiac if it is installed (#20742). This speeds up the GCD by an order of mag versus Pynac and two orders of mag versus pexpect-Maxima.
