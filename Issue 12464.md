/usr/local/share/sage/sage-5.0.beta4/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/rings/integer.so in sage.rings.integer.Integer.is_squarefree (sage/rings/integer.c:27127)()

PariError:  (5)
```

This bug was probably introduced with the recent Pari upgrade, as older versions of Sage do output `False`.

I've reported it upstream as this is clearly a Pari bug:

```
? issquarefree(0)
  ***   at top-level: issquarefree(0)
  ***                 ^---------------
  *** issquarefree: zero argument in an arithmetic function.
  ***   Break loop: type 'break' to go back to GP
```


In older Pari versions we do get 0 as output.

It's been fixed in Pari now.

Fixed in #12638.  It would be good if this ticket would add a doctest to the `is_squarefree()` function.
