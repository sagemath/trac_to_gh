By definition, the `-maximal` environments install all system packages of standard and optional packages - whether they have `spkg-configure.m4` or not.

As we add more and more system packages, this can lead to failures on non-current distributions: For example `ubuntu-focal` as can be seen in https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/2156547051:

```
E: Unable to locate package libgap-dev
```


In this ticket, we fix this by setting `IGNORE_MISSING_SYSTEM_PACKAGES=yes` for all `-maximal` environments (but override it for the cutting edge versions of the distributions). 
In this way, there is still error checking (which will catch typos in the system package information).


To test: `tox -e docker-ubuntu-focal-maximal -- config.status`
