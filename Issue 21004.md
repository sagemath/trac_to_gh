# Issue 21004: faq-usage typo 'preparse' should be 'preparser'

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: hsnyder

Original creation time: 2016-08-13 18:19:12

Keywords: faq-usage faq preparser preparse

In src/doc/en/faq/faq-usage.rst around line 362, text says


```
You can also disable the preprocessor in your code via
 ``preparse(False)``.
```


This should read

```
You can also disable the preprocessor in your code via
 ``preparser(False)``.
```


Example: try the following in sage command line session. It fails with an exception.

```
num = 123
num.bit_length()
```


But this succeeds and produces output:


```
preparser(False)
num = 123
num.bit_length()

```

In the next sentence please change "can may" to "can" and ". Or switching" to " or switch" for correct grammar.

There are two other instances of "preparse(" in this file on L286 and L333 which are correct. ~~Please correct those as well.~~

Also, `preparse` is no longer located in `sage.all` as stated on L301. It's now in `sage.repl.all`. Shouldn't that also be corrected?

Please also let me know for future reference whether it's simpler for me to make changes like this on a public branch and then have you review them. Happy to do so if that's a better work flow.

References to "preparse(): at L286 and L333 are correct. There are two similarly-named functions. First parameter to preparse() is a line of code. Parameter to preparser() is a boolean.

done. The import of line 301 still works, so does not need to be changed.
