Keywords: faq-usage faq preparser preparse

In src/doc/en/faq/faq-usage.rst around line 362, text says


```
You can also disable the preprocessor in your code via
 ``preparse(False)``.
```


This should read

```
You can also disable the preprocessor in your code via
 ``preparser(False)``.
```


Example: try the following in sage command line session. It fails with an exception.

```
num = 123
num.bit_length()
```


But this succeeds and produces output:


```
preparser(False)
num = 123
num.bit_length()

```

In the next sentence please change "can may" to "can" and ". Or switching" to " or switch" for correct grammar.
