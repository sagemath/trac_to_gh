# Issue 25326: Rename MPolynomialRing_generic -> MPolynomialRing_base

Issue created by migration from Trac.

The name `MPolynomialRing_generic` is confusing because it's not a generic implementation: it's essentially an abstract base class. One cannot create elements of it:

```
sage: from sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_ring_generic import MPolynomialRing_generic
sage: R = MPolynomialRing_generic(ZZ, 2, ["a", "b"], "lex")
sage: R()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NotImplementedError                       Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-5-5a32ac3184a1> in <module>()
----> 1 R()

/usr/local/src/sage-git/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/structure/parent.pyx in sage.structure.parent.Parent.__call__ (build/cythonized/sage/structure/parent.c:9489)()
    899         """
    900         if self._element_constructor is None:
--> 901             raise NotImplementedError(f"cannot construct elements of {self}")
    902         cdef Py_ssize_t i
    903         cdef R = parent(x)

NotImplementedError: cannot construct elements of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in a, b over Integer Ring
```


Typically, the word "generic" means an implementation which works over any ring, for example:

```
sage: type(matrix(QQbar, 2, 2))
<type 'sage.matrix.matrix_generic_dense.Matrix_generic_dense'>
```
