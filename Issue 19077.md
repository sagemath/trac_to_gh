Currently, `FindStatCollection` is purely internal, isn't it? Of course you can fix this issue, but I would not recommend to have this as a user point of entry to the findstat functionality...

I really do have to fix it, since it might be called internally... Also, personally, I use `FindStatCollections` quite a bit.

This is ready to go, are you going to set it to needs review? Please also have a look at #19307 and #19296, both ready for review with green patchbot.
