Right now the entire description for each spkg at http://sagemath.org/packages/standard/ is a link, so that the text is displayed (on firefox 3.5, Ubuntu) as blue underlined text.  That makes it harder to read than if it was just normal black-on-white text.  I'm suggesting we make the description text not a link, but just put something like a "More" link at the end of the description that is a link to the spkg.txt.
