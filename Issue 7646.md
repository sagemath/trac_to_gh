Hello William,
I've done some more snooping
into this, and the preparse_file function is messing up the file by adding
lines of the form

 _sage_const_2 = Integer(2); _sage_const_3 = Integer(3)

to the {top} of the file. Thus, in most cases, the function

 find_position_right_after_docstring

never really gets to do its thing properly. I've temporarily fixed this by
setting the default value of numeric_literals to False in sage-preparse.
This problem still seems to be around in version 4.2....

Best,

Subject: SAGE: is the preparser really supposed to be messing up my module docstrings?

Hello William,

I poked around a bit in the sage source code, for the preparser, and it seems
that the intention is not to mess up module docstrings:

 file: $SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/sage-preparse, lines: 125ff
 -----------------------------------------------------
   ...
   # Put the Sage library include along with a autogen message in the file.
   # It is ** critical ** that we put this after the mdoule docstring, since
   # otherwise the module docstring will disappear.
   insert = '%s%s.\nfrom sage.all_cmdline import *   # import sage library\n'%(AUTOGEN_MSG, f)
   i = find_position_right_after_module_docstring(G)
   ...

however, with regard to the subject line, see the sage session below.

$ ./sage-4.0.2/sage
----------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage: cat my_mod.sage
