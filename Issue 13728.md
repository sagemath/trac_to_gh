```
sage: RF= RealField(52)
sage: Y=matrix(RF,2,2,1)
sage: A = matrix(RF,[[0.24,1,0],[1,0,0]])
sage: A.solve_right(Y)
    ValueError: matrix equation has no solutions
```

Though it decidedly does have solutions. solve_right() needs to implement a fuzzy check (or default to check=False) if the base field is not exact:

```
sage: sol = A.solve_right(Y, check=False)
sage: A*sol
[     1.00000000000000 -5.55111512312578e-17]
[    0.000000000000000      1.00000000000000]
```

Since #12406, the `check` is ignored for inexact rings, so this problem does not exist anymore. A doctest for this example has also been added in that ticket, so this ticket can be closed.
