Remove all the `is_[A-Z].*` from global namespace. They have been deprecated for over two years.

step 1) remove the imports of is_* from rings/all.py (#15076)

step 2) remove the imports of is_* from matrix/all.py (#15098)

step 3) idem for modules/all.py and structure/all.py (#15333)

step 4) remove otherwise unused (i.e., not re-imported) imports of is_[A-Z]* (this ticket)

step 5) remove the remaining imports of is_[A-Z]* (this ticket)

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14329

Arrgghhh! regexp!! There, the current modification should suffice.

On a serious note, what I do mean is all the "is_Vector", "is_Polynomial", "is_Matrix", and what not. The patch will be trivial but tiresome. I don't know any means of listing and testing whether they give a deprecation warning automatically. So, it has to be a slow, manual, and visual process.

is a hack but should work.

Btw many of the imports that were supposed to be removed as part of steps 1)-3) are still there (or were added back?).

This time there are no `is_[A-Z]*` remaining in the global namespace and all (long) tests pass.

Note that I did *not* remove `is_pAdic{Ring,Field}` since these were not formally deprecated as far as I understand (but I would not mind removing them as well if other people agree).
