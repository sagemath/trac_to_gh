This ticket implements the action of differential operators (from the Weyl algebra) on polynomials:


```
sage: W.<x,y> = DifferentialWeylAlgebra(QQ)
sage: dx, dy = W.differentials()
sage: dx.diff(x^3)
3*x^2
sage: (x*dx + dy + 1).diff(x^4*y^4 + 1)
5*x^4*y^4 + 4*x^4*y^3 + 1
```

    "body": "This is good to have. Although I don't see why this needs the full `Action` framework.

That being said, let's get this in as-is and do more based on this ticket later.",

Thanks for the review. Mainly, I assumed using the action framework was the preferred way to implement this, but you are probably right that it is not entirely necessary.

Using the ``@`` operator here sounds like a good option to me. Though, given the recent discussion on devel, it might be difficult to reach a consensus about this.
