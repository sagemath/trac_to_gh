# Issue 22867: implement alpha for streamline plots

In #10775 we implemented streamline plots, but [this ask.sagemath question](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/37728/transparency-option-in-streamline-plot/) requests alpha transparency for it too.  Currently this raises an error.

The matplotlib streamplot [https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.axes.Axes.streamplot.html](https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.axes.Axes.streamplot.html) currently doesn't support the alpha option. To allow alpha transparency, one would have to re-implement `streamline_plot` by plotting lines and arrows, instead of using the matplotlib function. As the answer [https://ask.sagemath.org/question/37728/transparency-option-in-streamline-plot/?answer=37729#post-id-37729](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/37728/transparency-option-in-streamline-plot/?answer=37729#post-id-37729) to the ask.sagemath question suggests, one can use the alpha option in PIL as a workaround.
