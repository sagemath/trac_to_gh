# Issue 23423: Better isomorphisms between function fields and fraction fields

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23660

Original creator: saraedum

Original creation time: 2017-08-21 04:21:37

Keywords: function field, fraction field

Add a method `function_field` to fraction fields of univariate polynomial rings over fields which returns the isomorphic function field. Also, the involved morphisms should know that they are injective and surjective.

Looks fine.

Maybe you could make the paragraph in `_richcmp_` a warning or note block.

```
File "src/sage/categories/rings.py", line 117, in sage.categories.rings.Rings.MorphismMethods.is_injective
Failed example:
    f = ZZ.hom(K); f
Expected:
    Composite map:
      From: Integer Ring
      To:   Rational function field in x over Rational Field
      Defn:   Conversion via FractionFieldElement_1poly_field map:
              From: Integer Ring
              To:   Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field
            then
              Coercion map:
              From: Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field
              To:   Rational function field in x over Rational Field
Got:

            then
              Isomorphism morphism:
