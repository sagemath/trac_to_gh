# Issue 28076: notebook-5.7.6 contains local files

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28313

Original creator: hderycke

Original creation time: 2019-08-02 12:07:38

Keywords: jupyter

Some files in notebook-5.7.6.tar.gz contains relative link.

`./notebook/static/style/ipython.min.css.map` and `./notebook/static/style/style.min.css.map`

Those files are not part of the official notebook release. It may be caused by an error in the building process.

This triggers error in Firefox (at least), when it tries to load files like:
`http://localhost:8888/Users/benjaminrk/dev/jpy/security/notebook/static/notebook/less/modal.less`

What are the reasons not to use Jupyter release ?

Outdated because of the update #26919, which uses unmodified upstream tarballs
