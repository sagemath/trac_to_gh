Hi,

What is the point of having several open tickets concerning Normaliz/PyNormaliz upgrade? You want the job of the release manager to become a nightmare? If Normaliz/PyNormaliz are not mature you should not have set anything to needs review in the first place. Also, you are shipping a beta version of e-antic which is not nice either.

Could you check whether there is a config.log in

/home/slabbe/GitBox/sage/local/var/tmp/sage/build/pynormaliz-2.5

and if so attach it.

No config.log file in the src directory, but there is a config.py.in:


```bash

That is to be expected. The `setup.py` script calls `$ sh configure` that creates the `config.py` from the template file `config.py.in`. In your situation, the process get stuck at the `$ sh configure` call (as you `pynormaliz-2.5.log` already mentioned).

Do you have `sh` installed?
