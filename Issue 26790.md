CC:  @dcoudert

This branch in `relabel()` should not rely on sorted vertices:

```
        elif callable(perm):
            perm = dict( [ i, perm(i) ] for i in self.vertices() )
            complete_partial_function = False
```

You could use `G.relabel(list(range(G.order())))` instead of `G.relabel(list(range(len(G))))`.

In `generic_graph.py`, you changed the doctest `G.relabel(return_map=True) == expecting`. Isn't it risky to do that ? the ordering of the keys of a dictionary might differ in py2  and py3, no ?
