# Issue 12783: Move __len__ and __getitem__ from Parent to FiniteEnumeratedSets

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/12955

Keywords: days38

Title says it all. The point is that with the current implementation in Parent, it is impossible to override those methods with something more interesting from lower categories. This long awaited change should be possible now that all(?) finite enumerated sets in Sage should be in FiniteEnumeratedSets.
