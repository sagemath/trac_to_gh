CC:  @gagern @jdemeyer

As remarked in #17890 the comparisons of elements in `QQbar` can be much faster by implementing `_richcmp_` instead of `__cmp__`. A naive implementation already gives a great speedup

old timing

```
sage: a = AA(125/13)
sage: b = AA(3/5)
sage: timeit("a < b", repeat=10, number=50000)
50000 loops, best of 10: 15.9 µs per loop
sage: a = AA(2).sqrt()
sage: timeit("a < b", repeat=10, number=50000)
50000 loops, best of 10: 17.9 µs per loop
```


new timing

```
sage: a = AA(125/13)
sage: b = AA(3/5)
sage: timeit("a < b", repeat=10, number=50000)
50000 loops, best of 10: 1.02 µs per loop
sage: a = AA(2).sqrt()
sage: timeit("a < b", repeat=10, number=50000)
50000 loops, best of 10: 7.6 µs per loop
```

I see, `__nonzero__` does not exists anymore in Python3. But then, will you take care again of removing all aliases `__nonzero__ = __bool__`? As this 2to3 move is pretty simple I do not see the point of doing it now.

I would not have insisted on `__nonzero__`, but this indeed for python3-readiness.

For the doctests, sorry but I still do not understand. You say morally 'let us check that something is zero non-trivially" and then all doctests are of the kind 

```
bool(something)
False
```

which mean that something is NOT zero. What am I missing ?
