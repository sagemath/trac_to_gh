# Issue 16209: BalancedIncompleteBlockDesign -> balanced_incomplete_block_design

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16446

Original creator: vdelecroix

Original creation time: 2014-06-05 12:01:47

CC:  ncohen

The functions in `sage.combinat.designs` that try to build a design with given parameters are by convention lower case... excepted `BalancedIncompleteBlockDesign`. We just replace the name with its lower case version `balanced_incomplete_block_design` and set a deprecation warning for the upper case one.

Would it be possible to change this after #16347 ?

Yes it is. I set it as a dependency...

You can rewrite this if you want. Ticket #16347 used to be a mess of dependencies but it only takes one commit now, and it shouldn't conflict with this one.

Yo !

You should use `deprecated_function_alias` for things like that :

```
+# deprecated in june 2014 (#16446)
+def BalancedIncompleteBlockDesign(v,k,existence=False,use_LJCR=False):
```


Besides this, it's fine.

I added a commit on public/16446 about an occurrence of `BalancedIncompleteBlockDesign` in `design_catalog.py`.

Set to positive review if you have nothing else to add !
