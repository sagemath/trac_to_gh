# Issue 4582: use Singular's capabilities for computing over fraction fields

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/4582

Guillaume Moroz wrote on [sage-devel]:

"
it seems that the sage interface to singular is not aware that Singular handles multivariate polynomial rings with coefficients in a fraction field.


```
sage: from sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_singular_interface import
can_convert_to_singular
sage: r=Frac(QQ['a,b'])['x,y']
sage: can_convert_to_singular(r)
False
```


However, it is possible to define it in Singular: in this case, it would be


```
ring R=(0,a,b),(x,y),dp;
```


(following the syntax 2. given at http://www.singular.uni-kl.de/Manual/latest/sing_30.htm#SEC40)

In particular, GrÃ¶bner basis can be computed by Singular in these polynomial rings more efficiently than the toy algorithm currently used.
"


I hope this can help!

Best regards,

Hi,

please don't close tickets. A ticket is only closed once it has been merged by the release manager. 

Please make sure to read http://wiki.sagemath.org/TracGuidelines since it explains the process.

Cheers,

Michael

And one more thing: Please make sure to attach the file with the ending ".patch". The current attachment is a plain diff, so in case you use mercurial commit and do an "hg export tip" to create an hg patch. That patch automatically gives credit to you in the hg changelog for example and also has a number of different advantages. If you have trouble using hg we can discuss it either in IRC or on [sage-support].

Cheers,

Michael

Yes sorry, I realized this too late.

It is the first time I use mercurial and just piped the output of 'sage -hg diff' in the text file: I'll check the export mercurial function and send a normal patch in some days.

No problem, plenty of us have made that mistake :)

Cool. Welcome aboard Sage development.

Standard mercurial patch

Patch applies cleanly against 3.2, doctests in `sage.rings` pass, patch contains doctest.
