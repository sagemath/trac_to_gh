Reported by Bruce Fontaine: The method mutation_class() was giving the wrong answer for ClusterSeed(['E',8]]).

The length was supposed to be 25080, but our code gives 25067 instead.

The issue was that we refer to index of an element of a list, but we then turn that list into a set.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14638
