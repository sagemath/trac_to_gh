Keywords: IMA coding sprint, combinatorics, Hopf algebras, permutations

Currently, we only have the F-basis for FQSym. We should implement

- the G-basis (G[sigma] == F[sigma^{-1}]);

- the monomial basis of Aguiar and Sottile (see 1.3 in http://www.math.tamu.edu/~sottile/research/pdf/SSym.pdf ; the formula (1.13) is most important, and triangularity should do the rest, if we make sure that the order is right).

Stupid copypasta in doctests caused failing tests. Fixed.
