In [this ask.sagemath question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/691/subticks-in-2d-plot#3839), the very reasonable question of controlling subticks was asked.  Meanwhile, Mark Edgington has implemented this!

Here is a description from that question of the new functionality:

```
Here's an example which should achieve what was sought after by the questioner (except that minor ticks are smaller than major ticks, which may not have been desired) :
var('x')
p=plot(5*sin(x/10)*sin(x),(x,0,20*pi))
p.show(ticks=[[0,5*pi,10*pi,15*pi,20*pi],5], minor_ticks=pi,
       tick_formatter="latex")
If the minor_ticks option is not specified, then minor-tick behavior will follow previous Sage defaults. If the option is specified, then the following examples describe the behavior:
minor_ticks=None, or =[None,None] -- no minor ticks will appear on either x or y axes
minor_ticks=3 -- minor ticks every 3 units on x axis ; Sage defaults on y axis
minor_ticks=[3,None] -- minor ticks every 3 units on x axis ; none on y axis
minor_ticks=[3,[2,7]] -- minor ticks every 3 units on x axis ; at 2 and 7 on y axis
```


Currently this lives, as based on Sage 5.10, on [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/edgimar/sage-main/compare#diff).  A patch would be needed, with doctests.  Some of the stuff on that branch is also [for other issues](https://bitbucket.org/edgimar/sage-main/commits/8f2d381fae7eb0e8de92ecab9f12f4b1d3ef951e) like #8478.

Not sure if this is really relevant for this specific ticket.
The following code can be used to get some control about the appearance of the major or minor ticks: 


```
import matplotlib
from pylab import figure, show
matplotlib.rcParams.update({'xtick.major.size':4})   #length
matplotlib.rcParams.update({'ytick.major.size':4})   #length
matplotlib.rcParams.update({'xtick.minor.size':2})   #length
matplotlib.rcParams.update({'ytick.minor.size':0})   #length 0 = no minor ticks on y-axis
matplotlib.rcParams.update({'lines.markeredgewidth':2})  #width of ticks
matplotlib.rcParams.update({'lines.markersize':6})       #size of ticks
```


However, implementing fine grained control, may be beyond the scope of this ticket. 

Currently (Sage 9.2)   `None` is used if the major ticks on an axis are NOT changed. If ticks should not be shown this is used: `ticks=[[],[]])`
Note that this is different from what is proposed in the description of this ticket for minor_ticks.
