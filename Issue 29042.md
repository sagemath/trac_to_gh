# Issue 29042: make doctests of fqf_orthogonal groups independent of the generators

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29279

Original creator: sbrandhorst

Original creation time: 2020-03-04 09:45:42

CC:  tscrim

The doctests in `sage.groups.fqf_orthogonal` call `an_element` whose output may change depending on the gap packages installed. This causes doctests to fail.

```
sage -t --long /usr/lib/python3.7/site-packages/sage/groups/fqf_orthogonal.py
**********************************************************************
File "/usr/lib/python3.7/site-packages/sage/groups/fqf_orthogonal.py", line 17, in sage.groups.fqf_orthogonal
Failed example:
    T.gen(0) * Oq.an_element()
Expected:
    (1, 3)
Got:
    (0, 3)
**********************************************************************
```


This ticket hard codes the elements in the doctests.
