The four last commits make available a `\Hom` macro that is reasonable to have in Sage. I was able to compile the pdf documentation by adding a `\Frob` macro. But I do not like it so much having it has a globally defined macro: the name "Frob" is ambiguous.

Exactly. The last non-bugfix release of PARI (version 2.7.0) was 21 march 2014. More than 2 years between releases is a really long time, especially because PARI is quite actively developed.
