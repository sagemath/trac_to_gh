This new option sets a default for all standard packages.

To build all standard packages (except gcc) from SPKG, use `configure --with-system-standard-packages=no`.

To require all standard packages to be present in the system, use `configure --with-system-standard-packages=force`. (This is for #30845.)

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33345

I guess I have more than one question:
- `bliss`, for example, is an optional package, but it's listed in the "Optional Features" section of the help message. Why?
- What's up with all of the "=" in `--enable-sagemath-objects`?
- `brial`, for example, is a standard package but it's listed in the "Optional Packages" section. Why?

I noticed this when looking at the help message for `--with-system-standard-packages`, which says "default setting for all standard package except gcc". This doesn't sound quite right to me. Maybe "provide default setting for ..."?

This is all pretty low priority because I don't know if anyone actually looks at this help message in any detail; I tend to do `./configure --help | grep <whatever>`, so I miss the organizational scheme anyway.

and "Optional Packages" is the section for all `--with` options. This cannot be changed.

Indeed, when I try this here, I see
