This new option sets a default for `--with-system-...` for all standard packages that have this configure option (except for `gcc`, which has its own special default).

The default is unchanged and corresponds to the option value `yes`.

To build all standard packages (except gcc) from SPKG, use `configure --with-system-standard-packages=no`. This is a quick way to build a vanilla Sage, much shorter than using `configure --with-system-openblas=no --with-system-gfan=no --with-system-gmp=no ...........`

To require all standard packages to be present in the system, use `configure --with-system-standard-packages=force`. (This is for #30845: For example, `EXTRA_CONFIGURE_ARGS="--prefix=/opt/conda --with-system-standard-packages=force" tox -e docker-conda-forge-standard -- config.status` will test that conda packages for all standard packages (with `spkg-configure.m4`) are usable.)

The defaults set with the new option can be overridden by `--with-system-...` options for individual packages. The order in which these options appear on the command line does not matter. For example:

```
  ./configure --with-system-palp=no --with-system-standard-packages=force --with-system-pari=yes 
```

We also simplify `tox.ini` and `build/bin/write-dockerfile.sh` by removing code that generated long lists of `--with-system-...` options. It is no longer needed.

I guess I have more than one question:
- `bliss`, for example, is an optional package, but it's listed in the "Optional Features" section of the help message. Why?
- What's up with all of the "=" in `--enable-sagemath-objects`?
- `brial`, for example, is a standard package but it's listed in the "Optional Packages" section. Why?

I noticed this when looking at the help message for `--with-system-standard-packages`, which says "default setting for all standard package except gcc". This doesn't sound quite right to me. Maybe "provide default setting for ..."?

This is all pretty low priority because I don't know if anyone actually looks at this help message in any detail; I tend to do `./configure --help | grep <whatever>`, so I miss the organizational scheme anyway.

Indeed, when I try this here, I see
