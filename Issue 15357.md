Mainly threw this together to test python3 compatibility (since scons is not yet python3 compatible). I personally prefer autotools over scons, so I think it would be good to finish this, although I'm not sure what the best way to integrate it into the build system would be.

One important question is the following: are you going to track the autotools-generated files with git? If yes, that will enlarge the git repo by a significant amount. If no, you will require Sage *developers* to have *autotools* installed.

No.

The source distribution will obviously have the autotools-generated output, but for those who are directly cloning the sage repository, they would need autotools (as is standard for most projects), or we would need to make autotools a standardish package (akin to gcc).

Integrating the prereq package runs into the same issue.
