Keywords: Tensors, parallelism, segmentation fault

The following code generates a segfault in sage-shell. In the notebook, we get a TypeError and a kernel crash.
 

```python

Parallelism().set(nproc=2) 
M = FiniteRankFreeModule(SR, 3, name='M')
e  = M.basis('e')
x,y,z,t = var("x,y,z,t")                 
Theta = M.tensor((1,1))
for i in range(3):
    for j in range(3):
        Theta[i,j] = function("Theta_"+str(i)+str(j))(x,y,z,t)
Theta["^i_j"]*Theta["^j_i"]  

```


Note that the error does not occur if one replaces 
`Parallelism().set(nproc=2)`
by 
`Parallelism().set(nproc=1)`

Furthermore, this error did not occur in sage8.9

I Tried to find a simpler version of the bug. It does not occur if one replace symbolic functions by a variable.

No problem.
