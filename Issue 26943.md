# Issue 26943: py3: fix doctest in generic_graph (part 3) -- _build_flow_graph

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27180

Original creator: dcoudert

Original creation time: 2019-01-31 10:35:05

Keywords: py3, graph

The 7 failing doctests in `_build_flow_graph` are all due to the same issue with `round`. 
We add `from sage.misc.functional import round` as suggested https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/C9yDz_JIE9s.
