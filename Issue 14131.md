It doesn't harm but obfuscates the logs and perhaps means there's some header file missing guards.

Those warnings are expected. It means that L1-L3 were not detected successfully and are replaced by default values. So it's not critical. It might make sense to investigate how to detect L1/L2 on your kind of boxes (for future releases) and we should also print a less scary warning once.
