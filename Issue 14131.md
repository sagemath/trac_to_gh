FWIW, I just built Sage 5.8 from scratch with the SPKG linked above on bsd.math.washington.edu.

I successfully compiled the spkg with sage 5.8 on my arm box.

I looked at libm4rie's compilation and found there where many warnings ; I checked libm4ri's build log, and found that many, many files trigger the following warnings:

```

It doesn't harm but obfuscates the logs and perhaps means there's some header file missing guards.

Those warnings are expected. It means that L1-L3 were not detected successfully and are replaced by default values. So it's not critical. It might make sense to investigate how to detect L1/L2 on your kind of boxes (for future releases) and we should also print a less scary warning once.
