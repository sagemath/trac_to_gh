# Issue 33667: polymake is built even if it was installed from the distro

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33904

Original creator: tmonteil

Original creation time: 2022-05-25 19:19:52

I am running Debian bullseye with `polymake` (4.3) and `libpolymake-dev` installed from the distro. However, if i configure with `--enable-polymake` the package is built anyway. The `spkg-configure.m4` seems to require a version at least 3.5 though.

Here are the logs, the build of polymake (that was unexpected) ended with no space left on device, but this is not the issue.

Polymake is installed, as you can see with:


```
sagemath@debian:~$ polymake

As config.log says: polymake is rejected because libpolymake is broken.

You can open a bug report with Debian.

Replying to [comment:4 mkoeppe]:

"libpolymake is broken" is not really helping, which error should be reported ?

Well, you see what is tested in the spkg-configure.m4 file, of course.

It was introduced in #31527

Changing priority from major to minor.
