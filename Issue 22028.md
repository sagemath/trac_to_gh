CC:  ben hutz

Need to add NotImplementedError to try/except in homogenize in affine_morphism.
Need to fix dynatomic error that returns wrong parent in projective_morphsim.
Current examples of failure:

```
  R.<c>=QQ[]
A.<z>=AffineSpace(R,1)
H=End(A)
f=H([z^2+c])
f.dynatomic_polynomial([1,2])
```


```
R.<c>=QQ[]
P.<x,y>=ProjectiveSpace(R,1)
H=End(P)
f=H([x^2+c*y^2,y^2])
f.dynatomic_polynomial([1,2]).parent()
```


```
R.<c>=QQ[]
P.<x,y>=ProjectiveSpace(ZZ,1)
H=End(P)
f=H([x^2+y^2,(1)*y^2 + (1)*x*y])
f.dynatomic_polynomial([1,2]).parent()
```

```
sage: P.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(CC, 1)
sage: H = Hom(P,P)

this is line 853 in the projective_morphism.py file. The expected value is also wrong.

What is happening in that example is that the quo_rem fails to return a nonzero reminder, so then maxima is tried. The division in maxima (line 964) is not checked to see if the remainder is zero (which it is not).

This example is unable to be exactly divided, so it should return the rational function.

Both examples where the base ring is a polynomial ring still do not work.

The example you added with


```
f.dynatomic_polynomial([0,1]).parent()
```


is still the m=0 case, which is not what you changed. I would choose a different period for the example.


You need to add some readability spacing such as around = and ==


The complex example is fixed. I think it would be good to also add an example where the division succeeds, CC.0/2 or some other finite decimal expansion.

The original failures listed in the ticket now work. However, I found a number of additional examples that fail. Mostly it is for the affine computation, but apparently there is also no input checking done on the `n` parameter in both affine and projective.

Needs input checking:

```
P.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(ZZ, 1)
H = Hom(P,P)
f = H([x^2-5*y^2, y^2])
D=f.dynatomic_polynomial(-3)
print D.parent(),D
F=f.dehomogenize(1)
D=F.dynatomic_polynomial(-3)
D.parent(),D
```



```
P.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(ZZ, 1)
H = Hom(P,P)
f = H([x^2-5*y^2, y^2])
D=f.dynatomic_polynomial([1,0])
print D.parent(),D
F=f.dehomogenize(1)
D=F.dynatomic_polynomial([1,0])
D.parent(),D
```
