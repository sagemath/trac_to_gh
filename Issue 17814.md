# Issue 17814: Doctests in global options docs are ignored

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18051

The doctesting framework completely ignores any tests in the `end_doc` part of a `GlobalOptions` object. See the attached branch for an example of a doctest 

This is why the bug in #17995 has taken that long to find.
