ERROR: pip's dependency resolver does not currently take into account all the packages that are installed. This behaviour is the source of the following dependency conflicts.
sagemath-standard 9.5b9 requires sphinx<4.3,>=4, but you have sphinx 4.3.1 which is incompatible.
Successfully installed Sphinx-4.3.1
```

To fix this, we should add these files as dependencies of the `configure` target in the top-level `Makefile`.
