Currently the `Subset_s.an_element()` method returns a different result from the `Subset_s._an_element_()` method. The proposed fix is to move the current implementation of `an_element` to `_an_element_` and let the parent framework take care of the rest.

Strictly speaking, this is not a bug: we provide a default implementation of `an_element()` that caches the result of `_an_element_()` (which has its own generic implementation). However, we have no requirement that they both need to be implemented non-generically and return the same result. However, I do find that by using the caching mechanism this becomes an improvement. Once the patchbot comes around and is green, then this is a positive review.
