# Issue 33753: Subset_s _an_element_

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33990

Original creator: tkarn

Original creation time: 2022-06-13 13:31:41

CC:  tscrim

Keywords: gsoc2022 subsets elements

Currently the `Subset_s.an_element()` method returns a different result from the `Subset_s._an_element_()` method. The proposed fix is to move the current implementation of `an_element` to `_an_element_` and let the parent framework take care of the rest.

Strictly speaking, this is not a bug: we provide a default implementation of `an_element()` that caches the result of `_an_element_()` (which has its own generic implementation). However, we have no requirement that they both need to be implemented non-generically and return the same result. However, I do find that by using the caching mechanism this becomes an improvement. Once the patchbot comes around and is green, then this is a positive review.

It looks like a plugin failed, but I am not sure how to read the message. Do you have any advice?
