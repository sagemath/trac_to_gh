Currently, selftest of `cvxopt` rely on `nose`, which is broken (see#32595). Upstream does not mention `nose` anymore and recommends to use `pytest`, see https://cvxopt.org/install/index.html

You could conditionalize the dependency on pytest in the same way that it's done in `build/pkgs/networkx/dependencies`
