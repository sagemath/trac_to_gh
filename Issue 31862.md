Keywords: database knotinfo

In #31921 the location for the file-cache of the KnotInfo databases has been changed from `$SAGE_LOCAL` to `$DOT_SAGE`. Unfortunately this change has not been performed with respect to cleaning on version updates. This will be fixed here.

Furthermore, an upgrade to  the first official release 21.7 of the PyPI-package will be done.

The original databases on the [KnotInfo](https://knotinfo.math.indiana.edu/) web-page are developed under continuous flow. In order to keep track with that I've installed a [cronjob](https://github.com/soehms/database_knotinfo/blob/main/.github/workflows/check_version_changed.yml) that looks for differences and creates new releases if necessary. This is done once a month. The version numbers correspond to the month giving the next differences. The first such release is [21.7](https://pypi.org/project/database-knotinfo/21.7/).

This upgrade just puts Sage on that release. It does not effect any functionality. As far as I've seen, the major difference to the former release is the addition of 2 new columns for proper links (`'arf_invariant': 'Arf Invariant'`, `'topological_four_genus': 'Genus-4D (Top.)'`).

Indeed not. This was possibly overlooked as of non consequence on a multi-user install because it would only apply to the installing user's `DOT_SAGE`. But if cleaning is needed, it has to be done at runtime when the user starts sage or the specific functionality.

This is not a good solution - let's please not re-introduce uses of `sage.misc.package` - this is specific to sage-the-distribution.

I would suggest to instead query the version of the installed Python package using standard Python means: 
- either using a variable that your Python package `database_knotinfo` provides for this purpose
- or using `importlib.metadata` https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.metadata.html

}
```

I think the first option of your suggestion in comment 10 is the better choice, since it can be implemented independent on the Python version. Thus, I'm switching to this solution, now.

After an inspection of the log-files being attached to the `tox-optional` workflow run mentioned in [comment 15](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32099#comment:15) (for example the [one for ubunto focal](https://github.com/soehms/sage/runs/3040930473?check_suite_focus=true)) I realized that a couple of dependencies to standard `spkg` being necassary to have the doctests of `spkg-check.in` pass successfully during a clean build, were missing.

I've added these and started the [workflow](https://github.com/soehms/sage/actions/runs/1044132433) again.


I suspect that the problem which has been reported in [comment 17](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32099#comment:17) is related to that and should be fixed, now.

BTW: Is it intended that the jobs of `tox-optional` are marked green even though `spkg-check.in` failed?

This is not stable: I reran the same command and got different errors:

```
sage -t --random-seed=0 src/sage/knots/knotinfo.py  # 232 doctests failed
sage -t --random-seed=0 src/sage/features/databases.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --random-seed=0 src/sage/knots/link.py  # 2 doctests failed
```


My guess is that what is happening here is that creating the cache is not safe for parallel doctesting. You may want to make this step atomic.

Exactly! Shame on me: I only tested serial! Since I didn't find an appropriate Sage class to use for this purpose I created a variation of `atomic_write` in #32344
