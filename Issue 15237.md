These environment variables are supposed to control the number of times tests are run. 

Regarding `SAGE_TEST_ITER`: the time reported for each file doesn't change regardless of how this is set. The total time reported for all files increases as this does, though. So it's doing something, but the reporting isn't handled very well.

Regarding `SAGE_TEST_GLOBAL_ITER`: between each iteration, the message "Doctests interrupted" is printed, and that's not the appropriate message. 

So fix the use of these and document them, either in the installation manual (along with the other environment variables) or in the developer's guide.
