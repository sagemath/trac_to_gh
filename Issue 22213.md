# Issue 22213: Add Docker Installation guide in Readme.md

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: asutosh7hota

Original creation time: 2017-02-26 09:21:16

CC:  embray nthiery vbraun

Keywords: documentation

The installation instruction in Readme.md is limited to build from binaries and source. However, a new developer faces difficulties while installing and setting the environment for the first time.Adding docker installation guide would help the new developers.

You need to change the field "Component" in the ticket to somethig more appropriate (like "documentation").

Changing component from PLEASE CHANGE to documentation.

I don't think these instructions should contain anything resembling instructions for installing Docker, beyond a link directly to the Docker documentation, as that is often in flux and not something Sage's documentation can/should keep up with.

The documentation for the container itself is outdated too.  The most up to date documentation is at: https://github.com/sagemath/docker-images#containers-for-sagemath--friends

(up to the part about building the containers, which isn't relevant)

should remove the instructions to install docker itself


---

Comment by saraedum created at 2018-04-06 22:46:11

I think that we should just link to the docker documentation for installing docker and to our docker hub page for running the docker image.

Please visit https://github.com/saraedum/sage/blob/t/22450/add_docker_installation_guide_in_readme_md/README.md to see how this renders now on github. And see https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/master/README.md for the previous version.

asutosh7hota: I hope you don't mind that I took this a step further. Thanks for pointing out the missing docker instructions.

I think the link to the icon on Gravatar is a bit strange and subject to break (I don't know just how static their URLs are).  Wouldn't it be better to include a copy of that image somewhere in the Sage sources and link it from there?

Comment by embray created at 2018-04-09 09:30:14

I'm not sure about this part:


```
+If you downloaded a [binary](http://www.sagemath.org/download.html),
+you do not need to do anything (as long as your system provides a SSL library,
+OpenSSL is recommended); just execute:
 
     ./sage
```


the parenthetical about SSL is distracting and confusing, especially to a newbie ("what is an SSL library?  Does my system even have that? Why does that matter for math software?")  I would make that a note further done at the most.

Also I'm not sure if the answer after installing from a binary is to run `./sage`.  I'm not sure how all the different binary installers for Sage work but who's to say `sage` is in the current directory?

+If you have questions or encounter problems, please do not hesitate
+to email the [sage-support mailing list](https://groups.google.com/group/sage-support).

Should it also mention ask.sagemath.org?

```
+Sage fully supports several Linux distributions, recent versions of
+Mac OS X, Windows (using virtualization), as well as a number of
+Solaris and OpenSolaris releases.
```



```
+   * __Windows:__ [Download and install VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads),
+   and then download the [Sage virtual appliance](https://wiki.sagemath.org/SageAppliance).
```


The part about Windows is definitely out of date.  I can update that if you'd like...

Comment by embray created at 2018-04-09 09:34:54


```
+You can also have a look at our docker images to run Sage.
```


Minor nitpick--Docker should be capitalized.

You're right. Fixed.

I just took this part over from the previous section but I guess you're right. I tried to improve it now.

So what was the problem exactly about the SSL library? I need this for the sage notebook or for Sage in general?

Yes please go ahead. In general, please feel free to make any changes that you see fit.

Not even.  AFAIK the whole thing about SSL only pertained to using pip to install Python packages (and possibly for installing R packages as well).  Most users won't even be affected by that (although it's not a non-issue since some people definitely do want to install packages with pip).  But as far as very high level instructions go, it's not going to matter to a user who just wants to get Sage up and running and find out what one plus one equals :)

Ok. We mention SSL as a requirement in the detailed instructions. That should be good enough already. embray, so from my point this just need the fix for the Windows part and a final proof-read (I can do that then.)

Set assignee to embray.

Yes, I'll update the Windows parts...

Thanks Julian for cleaning up the README; it was much needed!

But as far as very high level instructions go, it's not going to matter to a user who just wants to get Sage up and running and find out what one plus one equals :)

Sage without pip support feels somewhat like firefox without support
for plugins. With the general aim of a more modular Sage in mind, we
want to encourage people to distribute code as pip packages. However,
at this stage most users actually can't install them, due to misc
technical issues, the lack of SSL support being a big one
(first hand experience speaking here, with one occurence
no later than yesterday).

The whole SSL issue is complicated. Here is not the location to fix
it. Yet, if there is an opportunity to improve the README to increase
the chances that, in the easy cases, source installs will support SSL
with the default installation instructions, that would be a big plus.

Note by the way that there is a bias; a user that takes the time to
install from source presumably wants to do more than a few trivial
calculations.

Thanks!

I decided to make a followup ticket #25206 for the Windows stuff, since upon investigation I found additional place(s) in the Sage documentation that should be updated concerning Windows.

Volker, if there is going to be another release candidate it would be nice to include this (documentation only) change since it much improves our top-level README, especially for viewing on GitHub/Gitlab.

Setting milestone to "sage-pending" since it has a dependency on a ticket that's not positively reviewed.

I am already uploading the docker images with #24655 though it has not been merged yet and put the proposed docker README on Docker Hub. So the section about docker is appropriate already.
