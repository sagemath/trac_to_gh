# Issue 14058: Document development variables (SAGE_LOCAL, SAGE_PACKAGES, etc.)

Issue created by migration from Trac.

While the developer documentation references these variables, it never actually defines how to use them anywhere in the documentation. This needs fixing!

Where should this appear, other than of course [the current location](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/packaging_old_spkgs.html?highlight=sage_local) where it is defined?  Maybe [here](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/coding_basics.html?highlight=sage_root#files-and-directory-structure), where `SAGE_ROOT` is defined?  (I don't see `SAGE_PACKAGES` any more, but I didn't look hard.)
