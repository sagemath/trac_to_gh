# Issue 19798: Enable thickness-option in graph plotting

Issue created by migration from Trac.

This trivial patch allows `thickness`-option in graph plotting. It seems to have forgotten from the option list.

To test try for example


```
G = graphs.CompleteGraph(4)
G.allow_loops(True)
G.allow_multiple_edges(True)
G.set_edge_label(1,3,'foo')
G.set_edge_label(1,0,'foo')
G.add_edge(1,1)
G.add_edge(1,3)
G.show(color_by_label=True, thickness=2.5)
```

I am wondering about the name: `vertex_colors, edge_colors`, why not `edge_thickness` to go with them?

True. Changed.

Okay, cool !

I just noticed that the list of arguments is also available in GenericGraph.plot. That's an ugly copy/paste, that's for sure... I'm hesitant to remove it and link toward the auto-generated doc of the `graph_plot` module, however: what do you think?

(adding Anne in case she cares: she mentionned the options of Graph.plot some time ago)

I think that #13827 is what we really need. This is phase zero, enabling features that are already there.

What I recently wished existed was the following: internally the vertices are labelled by something. I wanted to be able to give a function f from the internal labels to some other labels (for printing). The printing labels would not necessarily need to distinct for all vertices (i.e. it could be a non-injective map). If x is an internal label, the plot would print f(x) next to the label.

Would this be easy to add?

Yes it is. This kind of code would be very similar to the other options already available, so you need not fear to hit a block if you give it a try.

Ticket #15206 is about non-injective relabeling. Please add your code under it.

Frédéric, got some minutes? This one is should be trivial.

Eight doctests failed: please fix them.

Also, in the documentation "tickness" needs to be corrected to "thickness".

OK, now the errors seem to be gone.

Doctests pass. Documentation builds. Example runs as expected.
