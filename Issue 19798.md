This trivial patch allows `thickness`-option in graph plotting. It seems to have forgotten from the option list.

To test try for example


```
G = graphs.CompleteGraph(4)
G.allow_loops(True)
G.allow_multiple_edges(True)
G.set_edge_label(1,3,'foo')
G.set_edge_label(1,0,'foo')
G.add_edge(1,1)
G.add_edge(1,3)
G.show(color_by_label=True, thickness=2.5)
```

I just noticed that the list of arguments is also available in GenericGraph.plot. That's an ugly copy/paste, that's for sure... I'm hesitant to remove it and link toward the auto-generated doc of the `graph_plot` module, however: what do you think?
