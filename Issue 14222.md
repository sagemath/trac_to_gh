Isn't the problem also that PExpect interfaces apparently do not properly get shut down?




The bug / patch should be (better) documented in the spkg;  AFAICS there's not even a link to the upstream report there.

You of course have to rebuild the spkgs that depend on ECL as well, i.e., Maxima, and do `sage -b` afterwards.

FWIW, I think we met that "double-fault" problem with `stderr` before, quite a while ago, and IIRC discussed it with upstream, so it's a bit astonishing it's still in.  (Although the circumstances were probably slightly different.)

`SPKG.txt` lacks a "Patches" section, and the following "Special Update/Build Instructions" should get corrected:

```
 * Note: the way we configure Sage, CXX and CXXFLAGS are unused.
 * Note: for the time being, ECL is built single threaded library as it
   seems to interact badly with the pexpect interface and Sage's signal
   handling when built multithreaded.
```
