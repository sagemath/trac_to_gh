As discussed in #27124, it might be helpful to actually check the validity of stamp files in `$SAGE_SPKG_INST` against a schema.

Furthermore we could add a test which actually checks all the stamp files on the user's Sage installation against that schema.  It's fine if that test fails for some users, as it would indicate that they have either a very outdated or mis-installed package (which should be indicated clearly when the test fails).
