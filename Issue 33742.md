We have:

```
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(GF(7))
sage: print( (x-5).roots(multiplicities=False)[0].parent() is R.base_ring() )
True
```

but at the same time:

```
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(Integers(21))
sage: print( (x-5).roots(multiplicities=False)[0].parent() is R.base_ring() )
False
```

In the latter example, `.roots()` returns elements of `ZZ` rather than `Integers(21)`.

Thanks for reporting the bug. When the base ring is an `IntegerModRing`, the code finds integer roots and neglected to convert them to elements of the base ring.
