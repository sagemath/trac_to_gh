In `src/setup.py`, we should not run `cythonize()` manually. It would be better to use Cython's `build_ext` command for that (new since Cython 0.25, so this ticket needs to depend on #20596).

Exactly. But it interacts in non-trivial ways with other parts of `setup.py` (in particular, finding the data files), so this isn't ready yet.

Well, I haven't figured out precisely what to do with this part from `src/setup.py`:

```python
from sage_setup.find import find_python_sources, find_extra_files
python_packages, python_modules = find_python_sources(
    SAGE_SRC, ['sage', 'sage_setup'])
python_data_files = find_extra_files(python_packages,
    ".", SAGE_CYTHONIZED, SAGE_LIB, ["ntlwrap.cpp"])
```


This code determines some inputs to the `setup()` call, so logically it should come before calling `setup()`.

On the other hand, the last line assumes that Cython has run because it looks for files in `SAGE_CYTHONIZED`. So, if we run Cython in the `build_ext` command of `setup()` (what this ticket already implements), then we can no longer determine the `python_data_files` before calling `setup()`.

One secret about distutils, which is both a bug and a feature--and the fact that it's often exploited is why it's so hard to change anything about distutils--is that in many cases it doesn't really matter what you pass to `setup()`.

So for example, the `data_files` passed to `setup()` is stored on the `Distribution` object in the `.data_files` attribute.

Where this requires care is it's sometimes important to make sure you're using those attributes in ways that are compatible with how other commands use them, for which the best documentation is the source code (another misfeature).  `data_files` is an easy one because it's only used by a couple other commands, mainly `install`/`install_data`, and `sdist`.

I could have done that, but the usage of `data_files` in Sage has always been a bit fishy, see #20108. So given that I'm changing the data file handling anyway, I decided to stop using `data_files`.

> though for files installed with the Python modules themselves it's more customary to use `package_data`

That doesn't work either: `package_data` assumes that the package data files are in the same directory as the Python sources. This is not the case for the Cython-generated files, so I cannot use `package_data`. But I am processing the data files similarly as what distutils does with `package_data`: copying them to the build directory. Since the data files appear in the build directory, they are automatically installed in `site-packages`.

> I suspect the problem might have to do in part with oddity in how `find_extra_files` is expected to work.

No, we can always change `find_extra_files` to do whatever we want it to do.

> I'm not sure why the `dist.extra_files =` either.  There's no reason now to go assigning arbitrary *new* attributes to the Distribution instance.

These `extra_files` are also needed for cleaning in the `sage_install` class. So I need to pass them somehow and assigning an attribute to the Distribution instance seemed like the most natural way.

There is another issue: `package_data` is handled in the `build_py` command, which happens *before* `build_ext`, which runs Cython. So even if you manage to handle the Cython-generated files using `package_data`, you either need to reorder the `build` subcommands or you need to run Cython in `build_py`.

Adding attributes to a class is a completely normal thing when subclassing. In this case, I could make a trivial subclass

```
class SageDistribution(Distribution):
    pass
```

and define that `SageDistribution` supports a `sage_extra_files` attribute. Because of the way Python works though, there is no need for such a subclass.

And the rest pretty much exactly as you have it.  Would that work?

It's not pretty but with distutils you have to write code like you're writing for Python 2.1 or something :)

If I had to guess, the reason they're doing it that way is because of how the "sdist" command uses the "build_ext" command to get a list of source files to include in the sdist.  I think the right way to do that is not really to run `cythonize()` in the `finalize_command()` method, but rather to modify the `sdist` command so that it runs `cythonize()` as a sub-command.

I will try to work with them more closely on that.

In the interest of harmony and in making progress, if this is *working* for you as is, then I give it a positive review.  I'll open a separate ticket with my ideas for how to build on this to make it a bit cleaner, but I don't think it's *bad* as is as long as it works.  I just know we can do better.
