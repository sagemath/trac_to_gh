# Issue 22803: Fix conway_polynomials build with SAGE_PYTHON3=yes

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23040

Original creator: jhpalmieri

The spkg-install script for conway_polynomials should be run with `sage-python23` instead of `python`, so that it uses the version appropriate to the setting of `SAGE_PYTHON3=yes`.

We should also fix the dependencies file: it does no longer require sage_runtime, but only python. I forgot to do that when upgrading the package for python3 compatibility.

It also depends on six, right?

Thinking more about all that, I am not convinced by all these changes. Maybe it would be sufficient to just add a dependency to six ? This was your original issue, no ?

The original issue is that the script should be run with `sage-python23` rather than `python`. I don't care that much about the other changes, so we can revert them if you want.

ok, then. Works for me both in py2 and py3

Wait, should we revert the other changes or keep the branch as is?

oh, well,as long as it works, I do not care that much..

I have question of details (I actually like the new `spkg-install` better than the last version). The database is created with `pickle.dump`, is the format dependent on the version of python used? If you created the file with python2 could you use it from python3, and vice versa?

[This](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#pickle.load) suggests that (if you use `fix_imports=True`, which is the default), then Python 3 should be able to unpickle Python 2 pickles. I haven't tried it, though. (See also

OK, that may have an impact on sage-on-distro packaging. It turns out that so far I won't be able to have a python3 and python2 of sage side by side - pynac makes that very difficult unless you are being very, very, creative. So I'll also have to watch for potential incompatibilities there.
