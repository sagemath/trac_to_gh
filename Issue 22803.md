The spkg-install script for conway_polynomials should be run with `sage-python23` instead of `python`, so that it uses the version appropriate to the setting of `SAGE_PYTHON3=yes`.

We should also fix the dependencies file: it does no longer require sage_runtime, but only python. I forgot to do that when upgrading the package for python3 compatibility.
