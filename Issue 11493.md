I wonder if we should delete previously built Sage documentation at all (in *all* devel branches btw.), since rebuilding the documentation takes a fair amount of time, and if someone's going to rebuild it (from scratch), he'll certainly be smart enough to delete whatever generated output he wants (or needs) to.

The current behaviour is IMHO somewhat surprising, at least in that it affects *all* branches as mentioned above.

And worse, this even happens whenever Sphinx gets reinstalled just because some of its (direct or indirect) dependencies changed (when using `make` with `SAGE_UPGRADING=yes` to also rebuild all dependent packages).

I know this isn't your change, but setup.py says

```
requires = ['Pygments>=0.8', 'Jinja2>=2.2', 'docutils>=0.5']
```

So why are the prerequisites "Pygments >= 1.3.1" and "docutils >= 0.4"?

The changes look okay at first glance, otherwise.  I'll keep looking at them, as should other people.

Another pre-existing condition (i.e., this was a problem with the previous version of the spkg):

```
Processing dependencies for Sphinx==1.0.4
Searching for docutils==0.7
Best match: docutils 0.7
Adding docutils 0.7 to easy-install.pth file

Using /Applications/sage_builds/sage-4.7.1.rc2/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages

Why wasn't docutils in `easy-install.pth` already?  The other prerequisites look okay, for example

```
Searching for Jinja2==2.5.5
Best match: Jinja2 2.5.5
Processing Jinja2-2.5.5-py2.6.egg
Jinja2 2.5.5 is already the active version in easy-install.pth

Using /Applications/sage_builds/sage-4.7.1.rc2/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/Jinja2-2.5.5-py2.6.egg
```

Looking at easy-install.pth, indeed there is no entry for docutils, either before or after (!) the Sphinx installation.  Before installing Sphinx, this is perhaps the fault of the docutils spkg, although I'm not sure how to fix it.  After installing Sphinx, either there is a problem with the Sphinx installation process, or the line "Adding docutils 0.7 to easy-install.pth file" is just wrong.

Perhaps [attachment:ticket:10176:easy_install.py.debug.patch] helps in debugging this.

(I don't have an entry for `docutils` in `easy-install.pth` in any Sage installation since [at least] Sage 4.5.3; haven't checked earlier versions just because they're located on other machines or filesystems.)

FWIW, in no Sage installation since [at least] Sage 4.2.1, so I guess it's never been there.

Do you understand why the Sphinx installation process says "Adding docutils 0.7 to easy-install.pth file" but doesn't actually do anything?

Otherwise, I'm happy with the changes, except that the list of prerequisites in SPKG.txt should be changed (or explained, if it should stay as is).

Well, Sphinx just uses distutils / distribute, and IIRC that prints that message.

A problem we previously had was that packages found in Python's current path won't get added, despite of the message (which is printed in advance).

Yes, I can correct them. AFAIK a couple of spkgs have rather "random" numbers as the minimal version of some other package required; usually simply the current version in Sage is taken. (And not even the upstream pages always give the correct versions required, some not even the full list of requirements.)

Just the message is perhaps confusing.

There have certainly been cases where old doctree directories were incompatible between Sphinx versions, resulting in crashes for `sage -docbuild ...`.

Well, that's easily fixed by a `rm -rf devel/sage/doc/output`; the deletion of work which perhaps took hours (or more) of CPU time isn't.

If #6495 gets reviewed and merged, it will speed up generation of the reference manual on machines with many processors.  So deleting the output wouldn't be as much of an issue then.  (The reference manual is the real bottleneck; everything else takes just a few minutes.)

The deletion of the output was introduced in #7286. Some options:

- Delete the output, as is done now.
- Don't delete the output, but print a message after installation about potential problems.  Such a message may get lost among many others during a run of `sage -upgrade`.
- Delete the output if we've updated the version of Sphinx (which we can tell by looking at the name of the Sphinx directory in SAGE_LOCAL/lib/python/site-packages), but not otherwise.  But Sage-specific changes in Sphinx, which wouldn't affect the Sphinx version number, could conceivably lead to incompatible pickles.

The first of these is in some sense the safest, since it is the status quo.  It will make some operations take more time, but it won't cause things to fail in confusing ways.  The others could lead to failures and confusing error messages.  So your comment that deleting the docs has "more potential of annoyance than not doing so" depends on your point of view: is it better to make things work but take longer, or to have them be faster but possibly fail in confusing ways.

Speaking of confusing error messages, for a while now, running "sage -docbuild tutorial pickle" (or replace 'pickle' by 'json') has failed...

The funny thing is that #6495's description says:

  *"Building the Sage reference manual can use significant computer resources. Easing the burden could speed up Sage development."*

Building the documentation in parallel doesn't take *less* resources, but even more. It only makes things faster *if you have more resources available*.

That's a bit misleading.  Building the entire reference manual in one piece takes more memory, for example, than building it in chunks — it doesn't scale up well — so building with two threads should use less memory, even with both threads combined, than building before the patches at #6495.  This is especially true when building in LaTeX format, it seems to me.  Based on my anecdotal experiences: building, say, the PDF version of the reference manual was pretty painful before the patches on my home computer: it slowed other things down noticeably.  Building after the patches is more pleasant.

(I didn't write the description at #6495, for what that's worth.)
