# Issue 29693: Change handling of 'sage --APP'

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29930

Original creator: jhpalmieri

Rather than handling `sage --gp`, `sage --singular`, etc. as separate `if` blocks in the `sage` script, treat them more uniformly.

Should we also deprecate these commands? Right now:

```
sage --gap ARGS
```

If we deprecate, is the alternative

```
sage --sh -c "gap ARGS"
```

? I think the quotes are necessary. Is this too unwieldy, or are we happy to essentially discourage people from using these commands at all?

Here's a branch to start the conversation.

Here's a new version. Not a strict rebase: the earlier version deprecated commands like `sage --gap`, while this one keeps them. It keeps those for standard packages, deprecates their usage for optional and experimental packages like `sage --M2`. It also removes `sage --gdb-ipython`, which looks like it's been broken for a while.

See #30563 regarding `sage -maxima` and what is necessary from the viewpoint of distributions

Setting new milestone based on a cursory review of ticket status, priority, and last modification date.

Rebased. Still don't know if this a good approach or worth spending much time on.
