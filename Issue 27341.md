After upgrading to Sphinx 1.8.5 in #26451, Sphinx's function `formatargspec` is deprecated, so we should not use anymore it in `src/sage_setup/docbuild/ext/sage_autodoc.py`.

For ordinary Python functions, we may be able to change `formatargspec(my_func, *argspec)` to `Signature(my_func).format_args()`. I don't think this works with Cython functions, though.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27578

The `Signature` class is new in Python 3, though there exists a backport of it for Python 2 so we'd have to add the backport as a depency so long as we still support Python 2.
