_A height bound may *be* specified_...

_sufficiently small poly*n*omial_

_requ*i*res height_bound to be set_

Shouldn't `sqrt(2)` be typeset in math mode?

(Though I generally hate that: For every "p" in p-adic an image is generated by TeX for the HTML documentation, which takes by far more than half of the docbuild time.)

It should be _default*:*_ (with colon)

Surely Sphinx caches and reuses these bits and pieces of TeX-generated images. A small grep for some of the more often used images (like $A$) seemed to indicate that at least...

Might be true. Nevertheless, then even generating a _single_ image file for every used math character (or short math-typeset identifier) takes a big amount of time, and btw. looks pretty ugly for e.g. _p-adic_ in the HTML documentation. (The latter is what disturbs me more, but such mark-up is widely used in Sage, even for numbers in a word like _2-descent_. If we one day build the documentation in parallel, too, the former is less of an issue, though it also takes more disk space. The ratio build:doc:ptestlong is about 3:2:3 on my newer machines; on older machines ptestlong takes longer.)
