# Issue 17343: Fix autoload generation for sage_mode

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: iandrus

Original creation time: 2015-01-03 20:22:36

Keywords: emacs, sage-mode

Autoloads are not generated when installed.  This needs to be fixed.  Also, we should update to 0.13 which fixed a few bugs.
