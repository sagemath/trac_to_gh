Keywords: elliptic curves, reduction

Given an elliptic curve E with a point P and good reduction at p, this wraps E.reduction(p)(P) to P.reduction(p).

The docstring was misformated (see http://wstein.org/home/wstein/tmp/trac11822.png).  I've refreshed the patch and uploaded a fixed one.  Positive review.

It might be nice to have a doc example of the type

```
E = EllipticCurve(...)
P = E(...)
E.reduction(p).is_on_curve(P.reduction(p))
True
```

I added one line doctest to check that the reduction of the point is on the reduction of the curve.  It probably needs_review again now, but I can't seem to set that flag.

Changing keywords from "elliptic curves, reduction" to "elliptic curves, reduction sd35.5".

Checked functionality in Sage, seems to be working as advertised.  Positive review.

Sorry for the extra comment.  Forgot to mention that the doctest passed 100% and the documentation looks good.

Please fix the formatting of the documentation string to be consistent with the developer manual: there should be an empty line after `INPUT` and no indent (currently, there is a 1-space indent).
