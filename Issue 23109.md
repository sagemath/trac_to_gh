CC:  sage-combinat @bsalisbury1

We can now `cdef` the class `LieAlgebraElement` since #22632 is merged. This also does some other fixes to `__mul__` to better handle `int` input and to `lift` to handle when the UEA has a different indexing set or is the PBW basis.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23346

What I am trying to do is implement `x * y` such that if `x` is a Lie algebra element and `y` is not in is base ring (or with the role of `x` and `y` swapped), then it lifts `x` up to a bigger algebra (the universal enveloping algebra) where `*` is defined (associatively). So really this should be a coercion map where it converts `x` and `y` to a common parent as there is not an action of `y` on `x` (or vice versa).

However, I don't know how to do this in the current system as the bigger algebra may not have been constructed yet (but is available through `L.universal_enveloping_algebra`). I would be happy enough if `x` and `y` were both elements of `L` (i.e., using `_mul_`) and then call `lift()` on both elements and multiply, but the coercion framework needs the result to be in `L`. So what I am trying to do is essentially emulate the coercion framework to get around this.

Doing things this way is what got it to do what I wanted it to do without breaking anything. However, I am sure there is a better way to do this. Suggestions welcomed.

Maybe an analogy in a less specialized area of math would be when you do `x + y` with two (multiplicative) group elements, then it would automatically coerce into the corresponding group algebras. (I'm not saying this is a feature we want, but merely would be the same concept).

Continuing your analogy, it seems that your input is really one group element and one other object which could be anything. Since it really could be anything, you shouldn't force the Sage coercion model on it.

What's wrong with something like

```
def __mul__(left, right):
    # ...
    # handle base ring stuff first
    # ...
    if isinstance(left, LieAlgebraElement):
        left = left.lift()   # Or (<LieAlgebraElement>left).lift() if lift is cpdef
    if isinstance(right, LieAlgebraElement):
        right = right.lift()
    return left * right
```

True, well, I want to assume that the other one is something coercible into a group element. So I need to invoke the coercion model at some point. Although I guess I can let the coercion model do its thing via `+` once I lift up the group element.

I think that should work. At least I don't see anything wrong with that at this point. I will test.

Okay, here is the new fix. I ended up copying most of the logic from `Element.__mul__`, but I need to make sure it attempts to go through the usual coercion framework first in order to test for things like the Lie algebra element acting on something else. However, I don't mind how the code turned out; it ended up being more straightforward than I was originally thinking.

In this case, LBYL is better than EAFP. You are doing `isinstance()` checks anyway, so you really already know whether to use `__mul__` or `__rmul__`.

For example, the old code

```
        if isinstance(left, LieAlgebraElement):
            self = <LieAlgebraElement> left
            y = right
        else:
            self = <LieAlgebraElement> right
            y = left
        try:
            return super(LieAlgebraElement, self).__mul__(y)
        except TypeError:
            pass
```
could be rewritten as

```
        try:
            if isinstance(left, LieAlgebraElement):
                return super(LieAlgebraElement, left).__mul__(right)
            else:
                return super(LieAlgebraElement, right).__rmul__(left)
        except TypeError:
            pass
```

It's not a Cython issue but a Python issue. I understand the confusion because

        ...

looks like it is providing `Element.__mul__` but that isn't actually the case.

I don't really understand your question. But let me try to clarify anyway. Consider

```
cdef class Foo:
    def __mul__(left, right):
        pass
```
Now, this `def __mul__` is not a Python method or function or anything like that. It's really a C function to put in the `nb_multiply` slot. Cython chose the syntax `def __mul__` because it would be familiar to Python programmers, but the similar syntax hides the difference in what it really is.

Now, when a type(*) is initialized by Python, ordinary Python attributes `__mul__` and `__rmul__` are generated from the slots like `nb_multiply`. These attributes are of type "slot wrapper" and you can see them in the `__dict__`:

```
sage: Integer.__mul__
<slot wrapper '__mul__' of 'sage.rings.integer.Integer' objects>
sage: Integer.__rmul__
<slot wrapper '__rmul__' of 'sage.rings.integer.Integer' objects>
sage: Integer.__dict__
dict_proxy({'__abs__': <slot wrapper '__abs__' of 'sage.rings.integer.Integer' objects>,
            '__add__': <slot wrapper '__add__' of 'sage.rings.integer.Integer' objects>,
            '__and__': <slot wrapper '__and__' of 'sage.rings.integer.Integer' objects>,
            '__array_interface__': <attribute '__array_interface__' of 'sage.rings.integer.Integer' objects>,
            '__copy__': <method '__copy__' of 'sage.rings.integer.Integer' objects>,
            '__div__': <slot wrapper '__div__' of 'sage.rings.integer.Integer' objects>,
            .......
```
These behave mostly like ordinary methods. They are implemented by Python and call the underlying slot function, which is `nb_multiply` for both `__mul__` and `__rmul__`.

In other words, the Python code `cls.__mul__(left, right)` roughly translates to `cls->nb_multiply(left, right)` in C, *with extra checking* added (like ordinary methods, the first argument `self` should be a suitable type). Now what I propose is to have a special function

```
def wrapperdescr_call_nocheck(slotwrapper, *args)
```
which would call the underlying slot function but *without checks*.

I haven't actually tried if it would work, but it should. And I can imagine it being useful for other purposes too. This might turn out to be one of these things where, if you know that it exists, you start seeing lots of use cases.

You might think that the problem could also be solved by implementing a custom `__mul__` method-like attribute on the type(*), which would be like the standard `__mul__` slot wrapper, except that it would not check that the first argument is of the right type. That sounds good, but breaks when subtyping(*): Python insists on "restoring" the slot wrapper in the subtype(*). I know because this broke an earlier attempt of #23102.

(*) "type" and "class" mean the same thing in Python. However, there is a tendency to use "type" when talking about Python internals but "class" when talking about user code. The only exception are old-style classes, which are not types: indeed, `type(obj)` is not the same as `obj.__class__` for instances of old-style classes.

Side comment: most special methods (like `__init__`, `__getattribute__`, `__hash__`, `__repr__`, `__iter__`, ...) are implemented this way. Usually, there is a close correspondence between the Python attribute and the C function: the first argument really is `self` and 1 slot function only has 1 attribute. The main exceptions to these are:

1. `__new__` which is special in many "interesting" ways

2. Rich comparison like `__eq__` because one C function corresponds to six Python methods. The first argument is still `self` though.

3. Arithmetic like `__mul__` because the first argument may not be `self`.

Interestingly, Cython already special cases calls to `__new__` (`cls.__new__(cls)` does not mean the same thing in Python and Cython) and I recently dealt with various tickets to improve Python support for rich comparisons. So, to finish the list, maybe there should be a ticket to close the gap between the Python and C implementations of arithmetic too.

If you write such a function, I will make the appropriate changes in here to use it.

The multiplication of elements in the Lie algebra should be a rare event and is mainly used as a convenience (the better way is to do the lift within the code itself). I also would say multiplying by an `int` should not really be done either.

TL;DR - I can live with the 5-10% regression for the typical multiplication cases in order to have cleaner code.

I can think of 2 reasons for the slowdown:

1. The method access `IndexedFreeModuleElement.__mul__` takes some time. You could do this at the top-level like

```
cdef object IndexedFreeModuleElement__mul__ = IndexedFreeModuleElement.__mul__
```

2. You are constructing `{}` for every call of `wrapperdescr_fastcall`. Since this `kwds` argument is not actually used, you could pass `None` instead.
