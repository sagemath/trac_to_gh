As reported on [this ask question](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/47587/inverse-of-real-sparse-matrix/), we have:


```
sage: B=matrix(RR, [[1/6, -1/24, -1/30, 1/120,1/12, 0, 0, 0, 0], [-1/24,1/60,1/60, 1/420, -1/24, 0, 0, 0, 0], [-1/30,1/60, 2/105, 1/140, -1/20, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1/120, 1/420, 1/140, 13/1260, -1/40, 0, 0, 0, 0
....: ], [1/12, -1/24, -1/20, -1/40, 1/3, -1/24, -1/30, 1/120,1/12], [0, 0, 0, 0, -1/24,1/60,1/60, 1/420, -1/24], [0, 0, 0, 0, -1/30,1/60, 2/105, 1/140, -1/20], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1/120, 1/420, 1/140, 13/1260, -
....: 1/40], [0, 0, 0, 0,1/12, -1/24, -1/20, -1/40, 1/6]],sparse=true)
sage: (B.inverse()*B).norm(1)
138.4999999999923
```


Note that reverting #24122, by removing the call to `build_inverse_from_augmented_sparse` in the `__invert__` method of `sage/matrix/matrix0.pyx` (line 5410), leads to a correct answer.

Okay, so I figured out the problem. Basically it comes from the inexactness of the arithmetic. There are a lot of non-zero entries in the part of the augmented matrix that are normally 0 but are not when working over inexact fields. So I just moved that special construction to only be for exact fields as the resulting matrix is much more likely to be dense anyways for inexact fields.

I also cannot replicate the issue with Python 3, whereas I can using Python 2, on those same machines. Any idea what could be causing this?

Actually, having had a look at the implementation, the reason why this seemingly works with Python 3 is that iterating over dicts is done in an ordered fashion, whereas it is done in arbitrary order with Python 2. Thus, the extraneous non-zero entries in the left half of the augmented matrix are consistently overwritten by entries on the right if they exist.

All in all, I agree this is the correct solution.
