# Issue 30365: Partitions_n.__iter__ creates partitions with int (instead of Integer) parts

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30602

Original creator: mantepse

Original creation time: 2020-09-18 18:42:56

Several iterators over partitions return partitions whose parts are of type `int` instead of `Integer`: 

```
sage: type(Partitions(3)[0][0])
<class 'int'>
sage: type(Partitions(3, length=3)[0][0])
<class 'int'>

sage: type(Partitions(3, max_part=3)[0][0])
<class 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>
```

Sorry -- I had been waiting for the patchbot build to run before marking it `needs_review`.

And the patchbot was waiting for the author field to be filled in.  : )
