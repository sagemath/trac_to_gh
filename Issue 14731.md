We could also support supporting a URL as the tarball field. That would be useful during development: people who cannot upload to the mirror network can then just put the upstream URL there. Actually, that might even make sense in general, not only during development.

Patch looks good to me.

I don't think we should allow an arbitrary URL. Then we also have to make sure that every Sage release all URLs actually point to our servers. And for development its much easier to just put your tarball into the `/upstream` directory instead of uploading it to a remote server and then downloading it again. It it turns out to be a crucial feature we can always add it later.

There were some merge conflicts. I've resolved those and improved the path a bit, please take another look (and hopefully merge before it goes stale again).
