# Issue 29977: Add graph method to permutations

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30214

Original creator: slelievre

Original creation time: 2020-07-24 21:37:37

CC:  slelievre

Keywords: permutation, graph

The `show` method for a permutation

- computes a graph corresponding to that permutation
- displays it
- but does not return it

It would be nice to have a method that returns the graph.

Inspired by a question by Ask Sage user magviana.

- [Ask Sage question 52649: How to LaTeX the graph of a permutation?](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/52649)

This should do what you want.

Personally, I would do

```diff
-E = [(i + 1, self[i]) for i in range(len(self))]
+E = list(enumerate(self, start=1)))
```

Do you agree?

Indeed a better solution. I'm also avoiding the creation of the list.

good, I was not sure if it takes an iterable as well. even better.

When the input format is specified, you can give an iterator. Otherwise...
