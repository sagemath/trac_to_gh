Keywords: permutation, graph

The `show` method for a permutation

- computes a graph corresponding to that permutation
- displays it
- but does not return it

It would be nice to have a method that returns the graph.

Inspired by a question by Ask Sage user magviana.

+E = list(enumerate(self, start=1)))
```
