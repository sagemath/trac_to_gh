# Issue 28520: CombinatorialPolyhedron: Remove empty folder

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28757

Original creator: @kliem

Original creation time: 2019-11-18 17:36:51

CC:  jipilab @laisrast

Keywords: combinatorial polyhedron

In the folder `src/sage/geometry/polyhedron/combinatorial_polyhedron` there is an empty folder that keeps appearing.

This is because `bit_vector_operations` was not properly defined in `module_list.py`.

We fix this by creating an empty file `bit_vector_operations.pyx`.

This is a new approach. I remove the module `bit_vector_operations` completely. Instead each file just includes whatever it needs from `bit_vector_operations.cc`.

Seems still to cause a merge conflict...

Not still. Again. The annoying thing about this approach is that I'm very likely to conflict.

Could you update the description of the ticket to also mention the new functions that are added?

Somehow, this ticket does more than changing 2-3 lines... Perhaps also change the title of the ticket. This will help in the future to traceback if necessary...

There are no new functions. It's just that we know grep them directly from the .cc file:


```diff
-from .bit_vector_operations cimport intersection, bit_rep_to_coatom_rep
+
+cdef extern from "bit_vector_operations.cc":
...
```
