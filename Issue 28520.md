CC:  jipilab @laisrast

Keywords: combinatorial polyhedron

In the folder `src/sage/geometry/polyhedron/combinatorial_polyhedron` there is an empty folder that keeps appearing.

This is because `bit_vector_operations` was not properly defined in `module_list.py`.

We fix this by creating an empty file `bit_vector_operations.pyx`.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28757

Somehow, this ticket does more than changing 2-3 lines... Perhaps also change the title of the ticket. This will help in the future to traceback if necessary...
