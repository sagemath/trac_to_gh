# Issue 24408: Support for spkg-postinst scripts

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24645

Original creator: embray

Original creation time: 2018-02-02 13:03:31

This is a change separated out from #22509, to add support for `spkg-postinst` scripts in SPKGs.  These are run after `spkg-install` and, in the case of packages that support `$SAGE_DESTDIR`, after the package's main files have been copied into `$SAGE_LOCAL`.

This allows for post-installation steps that are easier to perform once the package has been installed into its runtime context.  It _may_ be used to generate additional files which are not tracked.  In this it would be good to have an `spkg-postrm` script that cleans up any such files, but for now that is omitted since we don't have proper package uninstallation yet (this was added in #22510 which still needs to be updated).

Note: #25139 now provides `spkg-postrm` and `spkg-prerm` capabilities.

`additionall` is a typo I think.

Could we add a ticket number to the TODO that tracks this?

Otherwise, feel free to set this to positive review.

In #25139 I actually removed the TODO comment, since there's a ticket for that now.  I forgot that was originally introduced in this ticket.  I'll just clean that up and set positive review.

From #25139, I see there's still an unresolved issue here: When running post-install scripts the `$SAGE_DESTDIR` variable should _not_ be set anymore (or even unset).

By design, the post-install scripts run after the package files have already been moved into the real `$SAGE_LOCAL`, so any commands run in the post-install scripts should not use `$SAGE_DESTDIR`.

Ok, I confirmed that this fixed the issue in #25139, so I'll set back to positive review unless anyone has an objection.
