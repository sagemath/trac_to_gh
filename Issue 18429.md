As reported in sage-devel [1], pexpect should be a dependency of SAGERUNTIME. For some reason it is not, and I was not able to see if that was a recent change.

With this branch, the dependency is made explicit.

Mystery solved: that happened in #18508, which removed sagenb as a dependency of Sage. That's how pexpect, a dependency of sagenb, was removed as a dependency from SAGERUNTIME.
