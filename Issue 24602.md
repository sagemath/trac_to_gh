Similar issue here under python3:

```
sage: d = DisjointSet(4)
sage: list(d)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-2-d0c0da2e41ad> in <module>()
----> 1 list(d)

TypeError: iter() returned non-iterator of type 'dict_values'
```

where the code is

```
return (<dict?>self.root_to_elements_dict()).itervalues()
```

that under python2 returns

```
sage: d = DisjointSet(4)
sage: iter(d)
<dictionary-valueiterator object at 0x7f0306d3f578>

Eurk. Ugly enough, indeed. No hope that Cython could do that for us ?
