Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/11877

Original creator: ranosch

Original creation time: 2011-09-30 09:23:03

Assignee: malb

CC:  polybori burcin

Keywords: Tab Completion, complete primary decomposition


```
sage: R.<x,y,z> = QQ[]
sage: I = R.ideal([x,x+1])
sage: I.primary<TAB>
I.primary_decomposition
```


It would be better like this:

```
sage: R.<x,y,z> = QQ[]
sage: I = R.ideal([x,x+1])
sage: I.primary<TAB>
I.primary_decomposition           I.primary_decomposition_complete
```
