CC:  bhutz

We can initialize a ProjectiveSpace object as follows:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: P = ProjectiveSpace(R)
```


However, we get a strange error when we try

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: P = ProjectiveSpace(R)
```


The error should be clear on why this fails. Namely we can't construct a ProjectiveSpace given a univariate polynomial ring, since we need at least two generators from the base ring to work with.

Actually, I think the fix here should be the univariate ring does construct a dim 0 projecive space (which is just a single point). For example, for single variable multivariate polynomial rings everything works just fine

```
P=ProjectiveSpace(QQ,0)
R=P.coordinate_ring()
ProjectiveSpace(R)
```


So I think the line

```
if is_MPolynomialRing(n) and R is None:
```

just to needs to be an `or` for is_Poly or is_MPoly
