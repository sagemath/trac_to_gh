# Issue 32745: Completely split primes sometimes gives wrong answer

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32982

```
sage: x = polygen(QQ); 
....: f = x^3 - x^2 + 2*x + 8 
....: K.<a> = NumberField(f) 
....: print(K.completely_split_primes(80), len((2*K).factor()))                 
[59, 73, 79] 3
```


Since `len((2*K).factor())==3` we should expect 2 to show up in the list of completely split primes.
