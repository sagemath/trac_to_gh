Keywords: interact

Consider this example:

```
@interact(layout={
"top": [
["u_lines"],
["v_lines"],
]
})
def _(
      u_lines=slider([1..50], default=10, label=r"$u$-lines:", display_value=False),
      v_lines=slider([1..50], default=10, label=r"$v$-lines:", display_value=False),
      ):
    print u_lines, v_lines
```

With 5.7.beta1 (and I believe the problem existed for a while):
* The vertical spacing between elements is HUGE - if I remove layout (which is supposed to reproduce default placement here anyway), it is much more reasonable. This makes it next to impossible to create interacts to show in class that will have all controls and graphs on one screen in a reasonable size.
* Math is not processed in labels. Again, everything is OK without layout.
* Values of sliders are not actually updated - this is due to `display_value=False` with or without layout.

In Cell Server there are no issues with layout, but `display_value=False` does not work - the value is still shown.
