# Issue 13816: interact with layout is broken

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14020

Original creator: novoselt

Original creation time: 2013-01-28 01:12:39

Assignee: jason, mpatel, was

Keywords: interact

Consider this example:

```
@interact(layout={
"top": [
["u_lines"],
["v_lines"],
]
})
def _(
      u_lines=slider([1..50], default=10, label=r"$u$-lines:", display_value=False),
      v_lines=slider([1..50], default=10, label=r"$v$-lines:", display_value=False),
      ):
    print u_lines, v_lines
```

With 5.7.beta1 (and I believe the problem existed for a while):
 * The vertical spacing between elements is HUGE - if I remove layout (which is supposed to reproduce default placement here anyway), it is much more reasonable. This makes it next to impossible to create interacts to show in class that will have all controls and graphs on one screen in a reasonable size.
 * Math is not processed in labels. Again, everything is OK without layout.
 * Values of sliders are not actually updated - this is due to `display_value=False` with or without layout.

In Cell Server there are no issues with layout, but `display_value=False` does not work - the value is still shown.

Does this work on Jupyter?  We could repurpose the ticket.  And the syntax is "supposed to work" on platforms ...

Proposing to close all sagenb tickets as outdated, so that all remaining open tickets in the notebook component are about the Jupyter notebook.

Again, does this work with Jupyter?  If not, we might as well just turn this ticket into a Jupyter one to conform with comment:10.  Else close, yes.
