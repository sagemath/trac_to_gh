# Issue 15610: Do deepcopy + reset label in FiniteStateMachine.quotient instead of creating a new state

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: cheuberg

Original creation time: 2014-02-23 13:38:15

Keywords: finite_state_machine

In
`sage.combinat.finite_state_machine.FiniteStateMachine.quotient`,
do not create a new state, but make deepcopy + reset label in order to
preserve possible additional information of the state.

I am preparing a patch, it will be pushed in a few days.
