# Issue 31973: Bug in multiplication of Ore polynomial

The right multiplication of a Ore polynomial by 0 outputs a result with a wrong degree:


```
sage: k = GF(5)
sage: A.<t> = k[]
sage: d = A.derivation()
sage: S.<X> = A['X', d]                                                                                                                                                                                   
sage: f = 0*X
sage: f.degree()
1
```

Looks OK to me, and you're the expert. Before the patch:


```
sage: f = k.zero()*X                                                            
sage: f.is_zero()                                                               
False
sage: f = A.zero()*X                                                            
sage: f.is_zero()                                                               
False
sage: f = S.zero()*X                                                            
sage: f.is_zero()                                                               
True
```


and after it:


```
sage: f = k.zero()*X                                                                                                                                                         
sage: f.is_zero()                                                                                                                                                            
True
sage: f = A.zero()*X                                                                                                                                                         
sage: f.is_zero()                                                                                                                                                            
True
sage: f = S.zero()*X                                                                                                                                                         
sage: f.is_zero()                                                                                                                                                            
True
```
