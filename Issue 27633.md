one needs to understand the existing design first.

* (as far as I can see) currently Sage generates *.pc files for pkg-config, for blas, cblas, and lapack. This is done for Atlas (and for external blas/lapack fed in by `SAGE_ATLAS_LIB` ?). For openblas these *.pc files are basically all point to the same library.

* how are they used?  Are they all used?

* is the description of `SAGE_ATLAS_LIB` outdated? I cannot imagine any need for f77 libraries in 2019...

Not only this :-)


```
make openblas-clean # uninstall package
./bootstrap # update ./configure
./configure # here the output should show that openblas is not being installed
make build
```

on OSX for some reason I also needed to `./sage -f numpy` before `make build`

`make distclean` before `bootstrap` is more robust. I'm not sure in which cases one should re-install all the packages that depend upon blas, too, this might be
platform-dependent.

----

One naturally is interested in testing against system's openblas: e.g. on debian and derived systems one needs `apt install pkg-config libopenblas-dev`

On OSX's Homebrew one would need `brew install openblas` and then export certain
environment variable (as Homebrew will tell you), as for some reason it's not installed into a default location.

I'm not suggesting that we don't support other blas/lapack implementations, but trying to account for multiple system implementations AND multiple sage implementations is making life harder than it has to be. Somewhere down the road, we should be (a) checking for system blas/lapack, and using what we find; then (b) as a fallback, installing openblas and using openblas.

This is all speculation right now, regardless =)

I can reproduce your problem - and it seems to go away if I just not call that
python script, i.e.

```diff

I'm not saying it can be just removed unconditionally, but it needs an adjustment.

Hopefully Francois, its author, knows what's going wrong.

So in their infinite wisdom they removed `openblas.pc` all together.
Not sure it's a Debian bug (note that upstream openblas does create such a file, so it's really an incompatible Debian invention here).

Note, however,that my `locate` finds the `openblas.pc` created in my various Sage trees, but **not** the systewide one.

I don't recall having ever fiddled with its configuration.

I originally followed the model of the gentoo ebuild for figuring out the needed blas/cblas bits. Of course if you standardise on openblas this is not so needed.

Debian and now gentoo have this model where you have just `libblas.so`, `libcblas.so` and `liblapack.so` and what is underneath can be changed at runtime. So you don't need to know the implementation. On the other hand numpy has this detection model trying to figure what implementation you may have to figure the correct libraries. It used to be that something different would be built depending on implementation but not anymore. Honestly trying to figure which blas/lapack you are using leads to madness :( which is why we steered towards having standard named .pc files. And historically we shaved some bits from numpy's detection machinery.

On my TODO list is to switch my sage-on-gentoo from openblas to mkl. The runtime switch means that it should be quick and easy.

The stuff about `pkgconfig.parse` should be reported as a bug. Although we should check we have currently the latest version first.

Yes. So I think for that part
1. upgrade `pkgconfig`
2. put a `try`-`expect` block in the script
first we try with both, if the right exception is raised we try only `blas` and if that errors too, something is wrong and we should bail out.

I've opened #28883 for pkgconfig upgrade. 

I should also add cblas to the list of link the branch here is installing.

This //seems// to have worked. Now `make`ing. Don't hold your breath...

**EDIT :** `make` went directly to building the docs, which seems fishy : I expected it to recompile openblas-dependent packages (among them R). But these binaries somehow have caught the change :


```
charpent@zen-book-flip:/usr/local/sage-9$ ./sage -R

R version 3.6.1 (2019-07-05) -- "Action of the Toes"

[ Snip ... ]

> sessionInfo()
R version 3.6.1 (2019-07-05)
Platform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit)
Running under: Debian GNU/Linux bullseye/sid

Matrix products: default
BLAS/LAPACK: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/openblas-pthread/libopenblasp-r0.3.7.so

[ re-Snip... ]

```


So it seems to work.

In your opinion (prbably better than mine), is the need to set PKG_CONFIG_PATH enough to block a `positive review` ?

Anyway, `ptestlong` underway...

> Currently doesn't detect system openblas on Cygwin (which just gets installed as the generic libblas when you install it).  Not sure why yet.  I won't hold up this ticket over it but if I can find a quick fix I might like to do that.

I see; it's simply that Cygwin does not install an openblas.pc.  That's annoying.  I'll see if I can get that fixed upstream.  In the meantime we can just leave this as-is.

I think as a broader improvement to the current situation it's worth recognizing that the spkg-install for "atlas" actually does two things:

* If you have the old `SAGE_ATLAS_LIB` environment variable set it will just detect and use any old generic BLAS it can find in th given path; it doesn't care if it's actually ATLAS or not.
* Otherwise it contains steps for specifically building and installing ATLAS from source.

These two cases seem to be quite at odds with each-other, and the naming of `SAGE_ATLAS_LIB` is misleading.

I think what we should do is this (in a separate ticket):

* Deprecate use of `SAGE_ATLAS_LIB`; it can still work for now but display a deprecation message if it is set sage is configured with `--with-blas=atlas`.

* Clean up the atlas SPKG a bit so it's only responsible for installing ATLAS if requested.

* Add a generic package called just "blas" (we could keep openblas as the default though).  The spkg-configure.m4 for blas would implement the `--with-blas` flag, and also extend it to take an optional argument of a path (e.g. instead of `--with-blas=openblas` or `--with-blas=atlas` one can pass something like `--with-blas=/usr/lib`.  This latter case would have essentially functionality as the current `SAGE_ATLAS_LIB` (maybe a little better): use that path to search for a generic blas library; maybe also check that it contains some known symbols.
  * This is nice, because if you use the `--with-blas=<path>` option you don't get any SPKGs installed for blas, emphasizing that some generic blas on the system is being used.

Apparently my rather old Ubuntu lacks a `PKG_CONFIG_VAR` macro, so since this ticket I get:


```
$ ./bootstrap
rm -rf config configure build/make/Makefile-auto.in
bootstrap:69: installing 'config/config.rpath'
configure.ac:328: installing 'config/compile'
configure.ac:113: installing 'config/config.guess'
configure.ac:113: installing 'config/config.sub'
configure.ac:68: installing 'config/install-sh'
configure.ac:68: installing 'config/missing'
configure.ac:453: error: possibly undefined macro: AC_CONFIG_COMMANDS
      If this token and others are legitimate, please use m4_pattern_allow.
      See the Autoconf documentation.
configure:17006: error: possibly undefined macro: PKG_CHECK_VAR
configure:17007: error: possibly undefined macro: AC_CONFIG_LINKS
configure:17012: error: possibly undefined macro: AC_MSG_WARN
```


(I don't know why it complains first about `AC_CONFIG_COMMANDS` since that's standard autoconf, but it seems likely the problem is stemming from `PKG_CHECK_VAR` being missing.)

I'm going to look into it.

you must have a past-EOL Ubuntu, I gather.

The spkg-configure.m4 for blas would implement the `--with-blas` flag, and also extend it to take an optional argument of a path (e.g. instead of `--with-blas=openblas` or `--with-blas=atlas` one can pass something like `--with-blas=/usr/lib`.

Perhaps the idea of a "generic package" is overcomplicated for now.  Although it's something I've wanted to try to do in the past (#23465) but as a first pass detection of a "generic blas" can live in the spkg-configure.m4 for openblas (sort of as we do with gmp/mpir).

On the third-hand, because of the way the Sage build uses .pc files for cblas and lapack, and the fact that both the openblas and atlas SPKGs install these .pc files into SAGE_LOCAL, I understand now that even when we detect a system openblas, this ticket uses `AC_CONFIG_LINKS` to create those .pc files as symlinks directly into `$SAGE_LOCAL`.

I don't really like this, because part of my long-term goals has been to make it so that running `configure` doesn't create and write *anything* to `$SAGE_LOCAL` (this preference is in service to issues like #21532).  I'm okay with it for now as a temporary solution, but it does seem like a step backwards.

I'm going to see if I can come up with an alternative solution to this...
