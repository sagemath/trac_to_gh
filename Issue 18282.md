In the following comment (moved from `singular-cdefs.pxi` to `singular/decl.pxd`), is “deferences” a typo for “references” or a technical term I don't know?

```
+NOTE: our ring, poly etc. types are not the SINGULAR ring, poly,
+etc. types. They are deferences. So a SINGULAR ring is a ring pointer
+here.
