Keywords: complex_embedding relative

Here is a minimal example, with a trivial extension.

```
QQx.<x> = QQ[]
L.<b> = NumberField(x^2 - x - 1)
Ly.<y> = L[];
M.<c> = NumberField(y)
print L(b).complex_embedding()
print M(b).complex_embedding()

As written in the documentation, the function `complex_embedding` returns the image of the `i`-th embedding into the complex numbers (default is `i=0`). Here is the list

```
sage: L.complex_embeddings()
[
Ring morphism:
  From: Number Field in b with defining polynomial x^2 - x - 1 with b = 1.618033988749895?
  To:   Complex Field with 53 bits of precision
  Defn: b |--> -0.618033988749895,
Ring morphism:
  From: Number Field in b with defining polynomial x^2 - x - 1 with b = 1.618033988749895?
  To:   Complex Field with 53 bits of precision
  Defn: b |--> 1.61803398874989
]
```

In particular
- `i=0` is not the complex embedding coming from the coercion embedding
- for extension fields this list is not sorted according to the embedding of the base

I definitely agree that this is confusing. To my mind, the function `b.complex_embedding()` is to blame and it is a mistake to have made `i=0` the default.
