We currently patch cddlib to replace `rand()` with a GNU implementation. The idea seems to be to get the same random numbers on all platforms (I could not really find which platform this was done for but I saw some things related to Solaris in the surroundings.)

If we really want to get stable random numbers for doctesting there, we should probably use a preload hack to fix `rand()` everywhere, see https://rafalcieslak.wordpress.com/2013/04/02/dynamic-linker-tricks-using-ld_preload-to-cheat-inject-features-and-investigate-programs/ to get the idea.

I would like to get some feedback on this idea. Has this been tried before?

I don't think there are that there are other places where we rely on the glibc random number generator. Usually its the one in Python or a special cryptographically secure one; As far as cdd goes, I consider it a bug that it uses pseudorandom numbers at all, it implements a completely deterministic algorithm.
