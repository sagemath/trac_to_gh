Amazingly, this has not come up.  We do have _extremely_ rudimentary support the other way.  I'm putting this under interfaces nonetheless.

Changing component from interfaces to interfaces: optional.

Excuse me, I would be interested in watching this source as I need a converter from Latex or MathML to Sage for a degree thesis I'm writing for the University of Torino (Italy). What does your previous comment signify ? Isn't any source indeed or can you associate me to this so that I can git-trac on it ?
Thanks a lot, best regards.

Davide

What I mean by this is we have [this](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/misc/sage/misc/mathml.html).  But I don't even know whether most classes implement it, and it's not in the direction you need - hence this ticket.

I see it's not what I wanted. Thanks anyway for your kind answer, best regards.
