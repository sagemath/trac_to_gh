# Issue 21833: dot2tex produces tikz code with missing \filldraw lines

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: slabbe

Original creation time: 2016-12-16 14:53:11

Recent ticket #21918 brings up a problem with `dot2tex`.


```python
edges = [(i,(i+1)%3,a) for i,a in enumerate('abc')]
G_no_labels = DiGraph(edges)
G_with_labels = DiGraph(edges)
C = [[0,1], [2]]
kwds = dict(subgraph_clusters=C,color_by_label=True,prog='dot',format='dot2tex')
G_no_labels.latex_options().set_options(edge_labels=False, **kwds)
G_with_labels.latex_options().set_options(edge_labels=True, **kwds)
```



```
sage: view(G_no_labels)    # works fine
sage: view(G_with_labels)  # is missing cluster rectangles
```


Other problematic examples were provided in [#21918:comment:6](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21918#comment:6).

With labels, some `\filldraw` line is missing in one of the tikz scope:


```
sage: latex(G_no_labels)    # works fine
...
sage: latex(G_with_labels)
\begin{tikzpicture}[>=latex,line join=bevel,]
%%
\begin{scope}
  \pgfsetstrokecolor{black}
  \definecolor{strokecol}{rgb}{0.0,0.0,0.0};
  \pgfsetstrokecolor{strokecol}
  \definecolor{fillcol}{rgb}{0.94,1.0,1.0};
  \pgfsetfillcolor{fillcol}
\end{scope}
\begin{scope}
  \pgfsetstrokecolor{black}
  \definecolor{strokecol}{rgb}{0.0,0.0,0.0};
  \pgfsetstrokecolor{strokecol}
  \definecolor{fillcol}{rgb}{0.94,1.0,1.0};
  \pgfsetfillcolor{fillcol}
  \filldraw (25.0bp,8.0bp) -- (25.0bp,37.0bp) -- (53.0bp,37.0bp) -- (53.0bp,8.0bp) -- cycle;
\end{scope}
...
\end{tikzpicture}
```


It seems to be because of a missing `elif op == 'F'` clause inside of the function `do_draw_op` of `dot2tex.py` file (see [#21918:comment:11](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21918#comment:6)).

this works fine now (9.2.beta1)

I agree. Same for me.

Should we add a doctest ?

maybe a minimal one which only tests the presence of two occurrences of "filldraw", to avoid it to be fragile to other changes in the output...
