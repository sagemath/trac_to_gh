Keywords: scalar, hall inner product

In the documentation, the `scalar` method for symmetric functions (which is the Hall inner product) never actually says that it's the Hall inner product.

A minor issue, but anyone searching for this functionality will have a lot of trouble finding it, as I did.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25538
