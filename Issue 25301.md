# Issue 25301: add "Hall inner product" into the documentation for the hall inner product

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25538

Original creator: @MareoRaft

Original creation time: 2018-06-08 02:07:02

CC:  ghseeli

Keywords: scalar, hall inner product

In the documentation, the `scalar` method for symmetric functions (which is the Hall inner product) never actually says that it's the Hall inner product.

A minor issue, but anyone searching for this functionality will have a lot of trouble finding it, as I did.

Rather put this additional information on a separated line, as a full sentence. The usual thing is that the first line is a brief description, followed by an empty line, then more precisions.
