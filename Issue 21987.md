> If you had an old version of TeX Live (2014 or earlier) and then upgraded your operating system to Sierra, TeX will no longer work.

One would have to test carefully that it doesn't break it for previous versions.

I'm not sure.  It never affected me, but I could imagine it might still be valid.   I wouldn't count on this having been fixed (I haven't looked at the Mac app for a bit).

The mac app was removed in #30867, so this ticket is no longer valid.

Providing a macOS app again is tracked at #31000.
