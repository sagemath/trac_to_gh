# Issue 13409: implement residue() for padic extensions

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13613

Original creator: saraedum

Original creation time: 2012-10-17 15:56:23

Assignee: roed

Currently, elements of padic extensions do not provide a `residue()` method:


```
sage: sage: K=Qp(3)
sage: K(3).residue()
0
sage: sage: R.<a> = K[]
sage: sage: L.<a> = K.extension(a^2+1)
sage: a.residue()
AttributeError: 'sage.rings.padics.padic_ZZ_pX_CR_element.pAdicZZpXCRElement' object has no attribute 'residue'
```


The attached patch fixes this.

I hope the reviewer doesn't mind that I also added a copyright header and changed the exception messages to be the same for all flavours of `residue()`.

A few comments:

 * You'll need to depend on #13299, and may need to change your implementation here based on the changes there
 * Use the macros `\ZZ` and `\QQ` rather than `\mathbb{Z}` or `\mathbb{Q}`

In general though I'm happy with the changes here.  Once you're ready you should mark it as needs review.

I'm taking the liberty to setting this to positive_review again since the fix was trivial.
