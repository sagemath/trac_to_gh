# Issue 17470: Test if a graph is asteroidal triple free

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17707

Original creator: dcoudert

Original creation time: 2015-01-31 18:10:00

CC:  ncohen

This patch adds the module `sage.graphs.asteroidal_triple` and the methods for testing if a graph is asteroidal triple free (AT-free for short) or not.

It also connects the test to the `graph_classes`.

Hello,

Apparently something goes wrong with my second commit (http://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit/?id=0cb23b7b8064cc9bc96326e37172220264763609) but I don't know what.

Currently, I can compile sage with `sage -b` but I'm unable to run sage or to build the documentation. I don't know what's wrong.

Any help is more than welcome.

David.

Hello,

Nice code, it is simple and does the job. At the same time that an error has been reported in the implementation of `is_interval_graph`, it is almost tempting to replace our current implementation of it by `is_chordal and is_AT_Free` `;-)`

I will fix it soon, though. And I will probably need your help for the review.

About this branch: it is a bit weird to expose only a version of `is_at_free` that does not allow for a `certificate=True` flag, given that other recognition algorithms have it. Also, could you turn `AT` into `asteroidal_triple` in the functions' name ? We try to avoid abbreviations in Sage.

After this, I guess that I should be able to add a commit and we will be done here. I am a bit troubled by your "parameters": why not "input" ?

Good night,

Nathann

About your problem: you never say exactly what is wrong and I don't seem to have any problem with your code, so I cannot help.

Hello,

I have integrated all your remarks.

Question: what should we do if the input graph is not connected? test all its connected components or raise a "notion defined for connected graph only" error?


David.

PS: I had to do a distclean and to recompile everything (14hours). I don't know what happens, but something was broken...

Hello,

Is there any reason why we should have both `is_asteroidal_triple_free` and `has_asteroidal_triple` ? Also, 'INPUT' does not take a 's' even when there are several arguments.

No particular reason. At first, `is_asteroidal_triple_free` was returning only a yes/no answer. Now that it can also return a certificate, I can merge the methods if you prefer.

Yes. please. The way it is done now, we have dozens of lines of documentation for a function that reverses a boolean returned by another.

Hello,

There are two commits at public/17707b. The first one does some cleaning, and the second one is a proposition to make the `C` function accept a `short_digraph` instead of only its `.neighbors` pointer. Add what you like to your branch, and you can then set this ticket to `positive_review`.

Hello,

I agree with all your modifications => I set the ticket to `positive_review`.

Thanks,
