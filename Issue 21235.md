# Issue 21235: Implement newform_decomposition for modular abelian varieties

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Given a modular abelian variety, this function returns the newforms of the simple subvarieties in the decomposition of self as a product of simple subvarieties, up to isogeny.

There is currently a decomposition method for modular abelian variety but it does a lot more work than just finding the newforms. For many purposes, just determining is newforms is sufficient.

Closing tickets in the sage-duplicate/invalid/wontfix module with positive_review (i.e. someone has confirmed they should be closed).
