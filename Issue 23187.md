This is more a question, I do not have checked how to actually do it.

An (Hermitian) positive semidefinite matrix M has a unique positive semidefinite square root T, this is, M = T^2.

I would like to have this square root implemented as I need it for some further computations. This is already possible numerically as in


```
sage: W = RootSystem(['A',3])
sage: C = W.cartan_matrix()
sage: D, S = C.eigenmatrix_right()
sage: D

[                  2                   0                   0]

sage: T

sage: T^2 == C
True
```

It would be great to (1) have this exact (in some field extension in which the square roots live) and (2) to have the positive semidefinite decomposition.

The example in the ticket description is actually an exact computation, just displayed in a slightly misleading way. Indeed, one computes in `QQbar` here:

```
sage: d1=D[1][1]
sage: d1
0.5857864376269049?
sage: d1.minpoly()
x^2 - 4*x + 2
sage: d1.sqrt().minpoly()
x^4 - 4*x^2 + 2
sage: type(d1)
<class 'sage.rings.qqbar.AlgebraicNumber'>
```

Thus, what is the question? This way it seems like an implementation is already there.

IMHO it is more of a mathematical question whether you get a p.s.d. T.

In the basis of the columns of S, one has the quadratic form, given by M in the standard basis, diagonal, given by D, with nonnegative entries (i.e. M=SDS<sup>-1</sup>).
The square root T is a power series in M, and thus given by T=SD<sup>1/2</sup>S<sup>-1</sup>, 
a p.s.d. matrix with eigenvalues given by D<sup>1/2</sup>, thus all positive whenever D>0.

What can still go wrong is that T is not equal to T<sup>*</sup>. 

However we know that D=D<sup>*</sup> and so M<sup>*</sup>=M=SDS<sup>-1</sup>=S<sup>*-1</sup>DS<sup>*</sup>, implying S<sup>*</sup>SD=DS<sup>*</sup>S.
Thus any power of D commutes with S<sup>*</sup>S, thus S<sup>*</sup>SD<sup>1/2</sup>=D<sup>1/2</sup>S<sup>*</sup>S implying T=T<sup>*</sup>.

Anything I still miss?
