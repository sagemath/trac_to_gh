# Issue 31374: taylor series fails with `MACSYMA-QUIT undefined`

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31611

I have a problem (context: trying to find radius of convergence of a Taylor series related to Newton's method).  Sage throws a bizarre exception without any useful information.  Changing from `QQbar` to `CC` or `CDF` doesn't work for every root due to floating point overflow (it does work ok for the first two roots).


```
c = polygen(QQbar)
h = c^6 + 3 * c^5 + 3 * c^4 + 3 * c^3 + 2 * c^2 + 1
hh = diff(h, c)
c = h.roots()[2][0]
f(z) = z - h(c + z) / hh(c + z)
g = taylor(f(z), z, 0, 20) # gives error
t = g.coefficients(z, sparse=False)
print(c, abs(t[18] / t[19]), abs(t[17] / t[18]))
```



```
...
RuntimeError: ECL says: THROW: The catch MACSYMA-QUIT is undefined.
```

Sorry for leaving component as "please change": I don't know where it is wrong.

Moving to 9.4, as 9.3 has been released.
