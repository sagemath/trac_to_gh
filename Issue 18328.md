similar to

```
    graphs.some_graph
```

or to

```
    codes.some_code
```

(and similar), I propose to introduce

```
    sequences.some_sequence
```

which should provide a unified access point to all possible sequences in SageMath. For example, there is `fibonacci_sequence` in `sage.combinat.combinat`, `binary_recurring_sequence` (somewhere in combinat) and various other code.

One motivation for creating this, is to include here many sequences, which can be calculated term-by-term (from the previously calculated ones, i.e., recursively) or where the first N terms can be calculated at once efficiently.
Nevertheless, it can also provide an interface to sequences, where each term can be calculated explicitly (without dealing with the previous ones).

Hello Daniel,

Could you define what you mean by *sequence*. Is it sequence of numbers? Rational numbers? Real numbers? An element of an *infinite cartesian power*? Because there also are

```
sage: words.FibonacciWord('ab')
word: abaababaabaababaababaabaababaabaababaaba...
```

which is an infinite sequence of elements in `{a,b}`.

What I head in mind is a sequence of numbers (usually intergers, rationals, maybe reals). But of course words are very much related to it. So any ideas/suggestions are very welcome.

Then you are more restrictive than [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence) in which a sequence is even allowed to be finite. I do not have suggestion beyond _having precise specifications_. You can perhaps even be explicit in the names by using `number_sequences.*` or `sequences.numbers.*`? But those two looks a bit too much.

And you also have orthogonal polynomials, orbit of a dynamical system, permutations (i.e. image of the letters), ... Depending on who you are talking to a sequence can be many things!

What about 'integer sequences', like for Sloane? Words are already stored in `word.<tab>`

I am happy to make it as general as needed.

Like: Finite and infinite sequences where the elements can be any sage objects (but all of the same type/parent)?

Best,

Daniel

Ok. Do you think here of a parametrisation (parameter `ZZ` for integer sequences; like the base for some parent)? I ask, because maybe someone wants to have a sequence of rationals (e.g. Bernoulli numbers) or polynomials (again e.g. Bernoulli). This would then be similar to words with an infinite alphabet...

No idea. But I do not think that it is related to what this ticket is about. It seems that you want to create a catalog of some sorts, and we just have to figure out a sensible name for it. I do not think that there is any reason to define any kind of interface for the object that it contains.

I also expect that you will find in the (many) combinat class something which can already handle sequences. In this case, it would be better to use it rather than build a new one.

Let me try to summarize the two apparently orthogonal issues here:

* provide an interface for playing with sequences.  My favorite ticket attempting this is #16137, together with #16107.  This is for sequences indexed by natural numbers, although possibly finite.  If I recall correctly, a generalization might be provided by `Family`.

* provide a catalogue of named ("famous") sequences.  I believe that #16137 should be general enough to be able to deal with just about any sequence.  Is there any need to restrict to a certain type of sequence?

If the scope of this ticket is the second item, there is no conflict.  However, a backend would need to be chosen...
