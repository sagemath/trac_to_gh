yes, I'm currently trying to reproduce this, and ran so far into a similar error.
I am not sure whether there  always was the recommendation to use Conda's compilers, 
c-compiler, cxx-compiler, and fortran-compiler.

What I see atm is

yes, this one is probably fixable by installing conda gc package (if there is one) - but the question is why the compiler does not want to see anything in /usr/include?

(here Sage is configured to use system gc package)

This is intentional with the compilers shipped by conda. Mixing system packages and conda packages almost always breaks stuff. (For eg: the pillow issue `@`mkoeppe had). You need to add `-I/usr/include` for the compiler to find it.

> (here Sage is configured to use system gc package)

How did sage find the system gc package if the compiler doesn't? Does sage by default look in `/usr/include`?

another sort of trouble is coming from pkg-config not looking in <conda-root>/lib/pkgconfig

this is something that leads to a problem in buidling linbox, if fflas-ffpack is installed in conda

Something in `build/pkgs/pkgconf/spkg-configure.m4` should be fixed. It has

```
       AC_SUBST(SAGE_PKG_CONFIG_PATH, ['$SAGE_LOCAL/lib/pkgconfig'])

so the list should be extended with `<conda-root>/lib/pkgconfig`. So this leads the questions:
