Looks good to me, thanks for fixing this!

As this is my first sage/trac review, maybe someone else also want to take a look. I checked (following this guide http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/reviewer_checklist.html#chapter-review ) that:
 - the code fixes the bug
 - the doctests touched by this patch pass
 - the reference doc builds without errors
 - all doctests (make ptestlong) pass (there are two failed tests in sage.tests.cmdline.test_executable, but these seem to be unrelated)

Although the milestone is set to sage-8.1, the patch in this ticket is not merged in version 8.1. Should I reopen this ticket and change the milestone to 8.2 ? Or is it sufficient to change only the milestone in ticket description ?

Regards,
Rusydi
