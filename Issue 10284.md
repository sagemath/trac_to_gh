The compilation of sage 4.6 fails on my netbook -- a toshiba ac100, with an arm processor running an ubuntu distribution.

It fails in atlas ; see the attached log for details (the log is from running make again after the initial build command, so it only shows the problem).

I had a wonderful idea this night : compiling with "make -k" instead of make, so the compilation goes through all packages and go on even on error.

That means running "make -k 2>&1 > build.log" has given me a log with the failed build of the only problematic packages!

So here is the full list of things which don't build on this box (grep build.log -B1 -e Finished) : atlas-3.8.3.p16, boehm_gc-7.1.p6, flint-1.5.0.p5, singular-3-1-1-4.p3, symmetrica-2.0.p5,tachyon-0.98beta.p11.

W. Hart from FLINT saw something very interesting in the logs : the errors about Thumb support happen on assembly files which come from C-files -- so in fact the compiler which is generating wrong assembly.

I reported that as : https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/677360

Getting that right won't fix all packages, but should definitely help.

Hi there.  I found this ticket via:
 https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/677360

There's a bunch of things going on here and they look like the package has been configured incorrectly.  I don't think the compiler is at fault.

This code:

```
/home/jpuydt/sage/spkg/build/atlas-3.8.3.p16/ATLAS-build/../src//CONFIG/src/atlconf_misc.c:306: warning: the use of `tmpnam' is dangerous, better use `mkstemp'
2690	/home/jpuydt/sage/spkg/build/atlas-3.8.3.p16/ATLAS-build/../src//CONFIG/src/backend/cpuid.S: Assembler messages:
2691	/home/jpuydt/sage/spkg/build/atlas-3.8.3.p16/ATLAS-build/../src//CONFIG/src/backend/cpuid.S:30: Error: bad instruction `subl $8,%esp'
2692	/home/jpuydt/sage/spkg/build/atlas-3.8.3.p16/ATLAS-build/../src//CONFIG/src/backend/cpuid.S:31: Error: bad instruction `movl %ebx,(%esp)'
2693	/home/jpuydt/sage/spkg/build/atlas-3.8.3.p16/ATLAS-build/../src//CONFIG/src/backend/cpuid.S:32: Error: bad instruction `movl %edi,4(%esp)'
2694	/home/jpuydt/sage/spkg/build/atlas-3.8.3.p16/ATLAS-build/../src//CONFIG/src/backend/cpuid.S:36: Error: bad instruction `movl 16(%esp),%eax'
```


is x86 assembler.

This line:

```
	cd /home/jpuydt/sage/spkg/build/atlas-3.8.3.p16/ATLAS-build ; ./xprobe_comp -v 0 -o atlconf.txt -O 1 -A 0 -Si nof77 0  -Fa ic '-fPIC' -Fa sm '-fPIC' -Fa dm '-fPIC' -Fa sk '-fPIC' -Fa dk '-fPIC' -Fa xc '-fPIC' -C if '/home/jpuydt/sage/local/bin/sage_fortran' -Fa if '-fPIC'  -b 32 > config1.out
2754	cc1: error: unrecognized command line option "-m32"
```

fails due to the ARM compiler being passed the x86 specific -m32 flag.

This code:

```
 gcc -DPACKAGE_NAME=\"gc\" -DPACKAGE_TARNAME=\"gc\" -DPACKAGE_VERSION=\"7.1\" "-DPACKAGE_STRING=\"gc 7.1\"" -DPACKAGE_BUGREPORT=\"Hans.Boehm@hp.com\" -DGC_VERSION_MAJOR=7 -DGC_VERSION_MINOR=1 -DPACKAGE=\"gc\" -DVERSION=\"7.1\" -DGC_LINUX_THREADS=1 -D_REENTRANT=1 -DSTDC_HEADERS=1 -DHAVE_SYS_TYPES_H=1 -DHAVE_SYS_STAT_H=1 -DHAVE_STDLIB_H=1 -DHAVE_STRING_H=1 -DHAVE_MEMORY_H=1 -DHAVE_STRINGS_H=1 -DHAVE_INTTYPES_H=1 -DHAVE_STDINT_H=1 -DHAVE_UNISTD_H=1 -DHAVE_DLFCN_H=1 -DNO_EXECUTE_PERMISSION=1 -DALL_INTERIOR_POINTERS=1 -DGC_GCJ_SUPPORT=1 -DJAVA_FINALIZATION=1 -DATOMIC_UNCOLLECTABLE=1 -DLARGE_CONFIG=1 -I./include -fexceptions -I libatomic_ops/src -g -O2 -MT alloc.lo -MD -MP -MF .deps/alloc.Tpo -c alloc.c  -fPIC -DPIC -o .libs/alloc.o
/tmp/cckXY2Jn.s: Assembler messages:
/tmp/cckXY2Jn.s:1314: Error: selected processor does not support Thumb mode `swp ip,r2,[r3]'
```


is due to a swp instruction being used in inline assembly instead of the correct ldrex.  I know that Boehm GC 7.2 does this correctly and suspect that 7.1 does as well, so you might have another configuration problem.

```

Let me summarize what has been found so far :

- atlas does use x86 code, and this is a probably a bug in atlas ;

- atlas also uses the -m32 switch, and that is probably a bug there too ;

- tachyon has the same -m32 problem but its author is working on it ;

- I tested the compilation of gc-7.2alpha4 (Boehm gc), and it compiled well, while compiling gc-7.1 failed with the same problem as in sage -- so upgrading the version will fix the package ;

- I tried to find out the problem in flint-1.5.2 and failed -- but trying flint2, I get "error: impossible constraint in ‘asm'" ; which probably means there's something fishy in the code too ;

- singular just refuses to build because it doesn't know the arch ;

- symmetrica seems to trigger a compiler problem.

For symmetrica, I discovered the problem was that the compiler went out of memory : adding more swap, I was able to get it to compile in sage.

So as things stand :

(1) atlas-3.8.3.p16 doesn't build for several reasons (I haven't investigated yet) ;
(2) boehm_gc-7.1.p6 doesn't build, but the 7.2alpha4 version does ;
(3) flint-1.5.0.p5 has a problem in its assembly code -- reported upstream and waiting for feedback ;
(4) singular-3-1-1-4.p3 detects an unsupported platform (I haven't investigated yet) ;
(5) tachyon-0.98beta.p11 doesn't build because the Makefile target adds a switch which is unsupported on this platform -- reported upstream and waiting for feedback.

Ok, as far as I know, atlas is the last hurdle (and what a hurdle).

I have a strange problem with Boehm' GC version 7.2 though : the spkg I made doesn't build as-is. If I use my usual shell, export SAGE_LOCAL, then unpack my spkg and ./spkg-install, all is fine. If I use sage -sh, then the resulting shell isn't able to compile the package! I first get strange warnings in the configure step :

checking if gcc supports -c -o file.o... rm: cannot remove `conftest*': No such file or directory

then it goes on trying to build (which is already surprising) :

/bin/bash ./libtool --tag=CC   --mode=compile gcc -DHAVE_CONFIG_H   -I./include -I./include -I./libatomic_ops/src -I./libatomic_ops/src  -fexceptions -g -O2 -MT allchblk.lo -MD -MP -MF .deps/allchblk.Tpo -c -o allchblk.lo allchblk.c
rm: cannot remove `allchblk.o': No such file or directory
rm: cannot remove `.libs/allchblk.o': No such file or directory
rm: cannot remove `allchblk.lo': No such file or directory
rm: cannot remove `allchblk.loT': No such file or directory
rm: cannot remove `allchblk.lo': No such file or directory
rm: cannot remove `allchblk.loT': No such file or directory
rm: cannot remove `.libs/allchblk.o': No such file or directory
rm: cannot remove `': No such file or directory

Could someone lend me a hand?

You just have to `unset RM`. The problem is that sage sets `RM=rm`, which then the autotools scripts preserve. But if `RM` is unset, the autotools scripts set it to `rm -f`.

Some failures are just time outs because your processor is slower than what the doctest writer took into account. I think thats the origin of the "0 doctests failed" case.

The only worrying ones are the pickling error (no idea whats going on there) and the two floating point rounding errors, for example

```

In the pynac-0.2.1 package, things get hairy, but it seems I end up calling Number_T::tgamma, which is just py_funcs.py_tgamma. Of course, py_funcs is only declared in the pynac package, so hunting where it is wasn't that simple.

I managed to find the trail again by checking which packages depend on pynac in spkg/standard/deps : none. So I turned to sage-4.6, where I found : py_funcs.py_tgamma = &py_tgamma, implemented in ./sage/symbolic/pynac.pyx, where as far as I understand, since float(6) is a float, I guess the type checking leads me to sage_tgammal, which is defined in ./sage/symbolic/pynac_cc.h ; since I'm not running cygwin, this function is just calling tgammal... which is in math.h.

And I checked that this tgammal returns 120 with a printf ("%Lg\n", tgammal(6.)); ... so I'm a little at loss to where the error can come from.

Where did I fail in my search?

as far as floating point goes,  119.99999999999997 is definitely equal to 120...
I don't see why this can be classified as a bug. To me, it's just a feature of this particular FPU, nothing 
more than that. (e.g. it can present 6 as 5.9999999999999, nothing is wrong with this...)
I think you can just modify the doctests accordingly.


Regarding the pickling, is this even a stable failure, i.e. when you re-run this particular test, do you see exactly the same error
again and again?

I feel very annoyed by this : when I tracked the call stack, I found a working implementation, and now it seems I missed something... I must have checked "double" instead of "long double" :-(

The version is : eglibc (2.12.1-0ubuntu10.2).

My main box' is : eglibc (2.11.2-11).

I'll see with upstream.

So that means only the pickling problems are left. Thanks!
