    You are running a GAP kernel which does not fit with the library.
    Probably you forgot to apply the kernel part or the library part
    of a bugfix?

    If you are using Windows, make sure you installed the file
    wbin4r6n2.zoo (or .zip),
    Macintosh users make sure the file
    bin4r6n2-PPC.sit (or -68k.sit) is installed,
    Unix users please recompile.

    Error before error-handling is initialized: Update to correct kernel version!


    #W Static module lib/oper1.g has CRC mismatch, ignoring
    Error before error-handling is initialized:

```

Running `./sage -b` doesn't really do much, could there be some dependencies missing?

For the record: I based the libgap spkg on the libgap version that awaits review at #14014.

There are a few doctests that fail because of changed GAP notation for some group elements.
