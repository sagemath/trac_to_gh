CC:  paulmasson

This shows third edge:


```
g = Graph(); g.allow_multiple_edges(True)
g.add_edge(0, 1); g.add_edge(0, 1)
g.show(edge_colors={'red': [(0, 1)]})
```


It is propably my error in some former ticket.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21370

It does, and I can give it a positive review if you want. However, there is another bug, see direction of arrows:


```
g = DiGraph(); g.allow_multiple_edges(True)
g.add_edge(0, 1); g.add_edge(1, 0)
g.show(edge_colors={'red': [(0, 1)]})
g.show()
```


After your patch this will become a one arrow only, so there is bug in both with and without this patch. Do you want to look at that, or want me to make that another ticket?

The additional error you identified arises because currently unspecificed edges are first sorted by vertex and then tested against specified edges by edge label. If there are no edge labels then unspecified edges with the same vertices as those already specified will be ignored.

I replaced the test by labels with a test against an explicit list of edges already drawn. That should be more robust, but please test it in all the ways you can imagine.

It works with `g.allow_multiple_edges(True)`.

Jori, try testing this update please. The last error was caused because the value returned by `self._graph.edge_label` on line 634(old)/641(new) changes depending on whether `allow_multiple_edges()` is true or false.

To clean up the code I've added the method `append_or_set()`, since the same test against `edges_to_draw[]` occurs five times.

I tried quite hard to found more errors on colors, but did not found any. I tested with and without loops, with and wihtout multiple edges, and with some options to `edge_colors`, `edge_style` and even `vertex_size`, `graph_border` and so on.
