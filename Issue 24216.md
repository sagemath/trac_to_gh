Keywords: narrow class group, quadratic field

The narrow_class_group function does not even work for some simple real quadratic fields.  Specifically, while it works for Q(sqrt(2)), it does not for Q(sqrt(3)) (I have not tried other number fields).  See snippet below.


```
sage: version()
'SageMath version 8.1, Release Date: 2017-12-07'
sage: F.<a> = QuadraticField(2)
sage: F.narrow_class_group()
Trivial Abelian group
sage: F.<a> = QuadraticField(3)
sage: F.narrow_class_group()
  File "<string>", line 1
    [2, [2], [[0, -1]~]]
                     ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

sage: NumberField(x^2-3,'a').narrow_class_group()
  File "<string>", line 1
    [2, [2], [[0, -1]~]]
                     ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

```


If it matters, I was using a pre-built Mac binary.

Indeed, there is maybe something strange..

```
sage: F.<a> = QuadraticField(3)
sage: F.pari_bnf().bnfnarrow()
[2, [2], [[0, -1]~]]
sage: F.<a> = QuadraticField(2)
sage: F.pari_bnf().bnfnarrow()
[1, [], []]

[3, [3], [[2, 1, 1; 0, 1, 0; 0, 0, 1]]]
