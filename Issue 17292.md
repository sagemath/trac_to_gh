Hello !

Can you tell me which commands you used to turn the original file into your bz2 file ?

When I do the same I get a different hash. Theoretically, that makes me suspect you from having inserted dangerous code inside of the binary `:-P`

OK, I took the tar bundle here: https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~latte/software/packages/latte_current/latte-integrale-1.7.2.tar.gz
untarred it, then untarred the latte-int-1.7.2 tarball there, renamed the resulting directory latte_int-1.7.2, and tarred it. This is as described in SPKG.txt.

I didn't bother to check the contents of the following:

but the tarball `latte-int-1.7.2` there has the same md5 hash as the one in the bundle mentioned above.
