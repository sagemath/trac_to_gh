This bug was reported to me by Xavier ProvenÃ§al:


```
sage: M3 = matrix(3,[-1,1,0,-1,0,1,1,0,0])
sage: a = M3.eigenvalues()[0]
sage: a            
0.5436890126920763?
sage: a < oo            # <---- this should return True
False
sage: a > -oo      
True               
sage: float(a) < oo
True               
```

Changing type from PLEASE CHANGE to defect.

This happens because `QQbar` does not coerce into `InfinityRing` (which is probably correct), and the coercion model does not discover `UnsignedInfinityRing` as a common parent.  (Note that `a < unsigned_infinity` does work correctly.)

In fact it could be argued that the result is correct, since `QQbar` is not ordered, and `AA(a) < infinity` works. I'm tempted to suggest closing the ticket as wontfix.

with recent sage we get

```
sage:  a <  oo
True
sage:  a < -oo
True
sage: -a <  oo
True
sage: -a < -oo
True
```


is that consistant/correct?

The second and third answers are "obviously" false at first sight, but there is probably no "good" way to compare with signed infinity in `QQbar`.  I think this should either be closed as wontfix (as in comment:7) or that `UnsignedInfinityRing` should be discovered as a common parent.

If there is no good way to compare with signed infinity in QQbar it should be incomparable?(IMHO)
