This bug was reported to me by Xavier ProvenÃ§al:

```
sage: M3 = matrix(3,[-1,1,0,-1,0,1,1,0,0])
sage: a = M3.eigenvalues()[0]
sage: a            
0.5436890126920763?
sage: a < oo            # <---- this should return True
False
sage: a > -oo      
True               
sage: float(a) < oo
True

This happens because `QQbar` does not coerce into `InfinityRing` (which is probably correct), and the coercion model does not discover `UnsignedInfinityRing` as a common parent.  (Note that `a < unsigned_infinity` does work correctly.)

with recent sage we get

The second and third answers are "obviously" false at first sight, but there is probably no "good" way to compare with signed infinity in `QQbar`.  I think this should either be closed as wontfix (as in comment:7) or that `UnsignedInfinityRing` should be discovered as a common parent.

If there is no good way to compare with signed infinity in QQbar it should be incomparable?(IMHO)
