If brew is installed on Linux, Sagemath thinks this is the primary package manager and, e.g., configure suggests to run brew xyz to install new packages.

Probably build/bin/sage-guess-package-system should be changed so that brew is only tested after the Linux package managers.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32753

For `nix`, do we need to check whether a nix environment is active, like we do for `conda`?

It would be great to have instructions how to do Sage development using nixpkgs in our installation manual. 

Other than figuring out how to provision a nix environment with packages on top of the `nixos/nix` Docker image (so I can say `tox -e docker-nixos-standard`), I have no experience with nix.

By the way, I am getting the error:

```

```

so it may be that some work on the `nix.txt` files is needed.

Yes, it's for the system package advice that is printed at the end of a `configure` run.

The code for this is in `build/bin/sage-print-system-package-command`.

`configure` only checks what is available in `PATH`.

For packages where we don't find a system package in this way, if there is system package information in `build/pkgs/*/nix.txt` for the package, we issue the system package advice. No package manager queries are done -- this is all left to the user.

(This is a design principle for this code -- it does not attempt to take care of system package installation tasks for the user; instead it only informs/educates the user about possible commands.)

Thanks for the information, this is very helpful! So, yeah, I think recommending `nix-env` is fine, since people who use the declarative approach can just copy and paste the list of packages into their derivations.

I will try to write some docs for Sage development with nixpkgs as part of the Sage 9.6 release.
