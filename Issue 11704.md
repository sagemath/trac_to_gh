If `K` is a number field with a given embedding, then `K.subfield(gen)` should inherit that embedding but it does not::

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2-5, embedding=2)
sage: L, phi = K.subfield(-a)
sage: K.specified_complex_embedding()
Generic morphism:
  From: Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^2 - 5
  To:   Real Lazy Field
  Defn: a -> 2.236067977499790?
sage: L.specified_complex_embedding()
```


Also, if `K` has no given embedding, then `L` could at least store an embedding in `K`.
