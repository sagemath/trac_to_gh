Sorry to be ignorant about the meaning of "random" keyword for the doctest context.
I have corrected/recovered the original word from the translated word/text.
After the correction, I have tried the doctest by issuing command "sage -t --long /usr/local/sage/src/doc/ja/tutorial/*.rst", it seems ok.

`make doc-pdf` from the Sage root fails with 

```
! LaTeX Error: This file needs format `pLaTeX2e'
               but this is `LaTeX2e'.
```

This is because it, under the hood, runs `make all-pdf` in `SAGE_ROOT/src/doc/output/latex/ja/a_tour_of_sage` which runs pdflatex. Only the `make all-pdf-ja` target works. 

The best fix would be to special-case the japanese docs in `SAGE_ROOT/src/doc/common/builder.py` to run the `all-pdf-ja` target.

Attachment

Following your suggestion, I have modified the pdf(...) function in the builder.py so that it recognizes the  'ja' language option to run “make all-pdf-ja” instead of “... all-pdf”.
It is rough and ready, but it works with “make doc-pdf” and in the context of “sage –docbuild...”.
I have made a patch file for builder.py of sage-6.9. The name is builder-ja.patch.
Please look at it.
