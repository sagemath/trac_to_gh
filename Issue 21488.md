There is a current trend to develop Cython libraries as separate packages, rather than as part of Sage.

Many of these libraries take numbers of various kinds as input or produce them as output.

It would be nice if these Cython libraries could do conversions from/to Sage number types. Otherwise, on the Sage side we would have to provide a separate wrapper around the Cython wrapper. 

Currently, this leads to 
- awkward dependencies (such as fpylll depending on sagelib - see [this sage-devel discussion](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/s8yeEPK_9zU)) and to 
- duplication of effort (for example, PyPolymake and its GMP wrappers)

We need to develop shared infrastructure (a new lightweight library, which does NOT depend on sagelib) for this.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21725

If a Python call + a copy per number conversion it not too high a price to pay, then perhaps sage objects backed by a “well-known” C library could provide an interface that would make them read/write an `mpz_t` (resp. `mpq_t`, `mpfr_t`, `mpfi_t`...) from/to a specified location? This would at least make it possible to exchange multiple-precision numbers with sage without build-depending on it.

For example, it would not seem so hard to provide a C library with a minimal interface such as

```
int mpz_from_python_integer(mpz_t target, PyObject *object)
```
that fills `target` with a GMP integer converted from `object`
and returns an error code if it can't.

By default (in plain Python), it would only deal with Python integers.

But libraries that provide new integer types such as sagelib can hook into this, for example by defining a method or any other of Python's dynamic mechanisms.


For the opposite conversion, for converting to the Python/Sage world, one would pass an extra argument to the wrapped function that indicates the type of output (Python integer? Sage integer? ...)

This is exactly the kind of thing I am fighting with in pypolymake. Actually pypolymake could easily provide a function to set the interface

```
int set_pypolymake_mpz_wrapper((PyObject *) (mpz_t, PyObject *))
```
I am not sure what is the best approach here but +1 for having a standardized and Sage agnostic way of doing it! I am available to test as many approaches as suggested within pypolymake. 

Note that we might want to do that for many basic types (integer, rational, floating point real and complexes, Zmodn, matrices, polynomials, ...). And this explosion might become a nightmare.

I hope that you mean a Python module and not a C library. Libraries are a pain in Python.

One thing we really need to consider is efficiency. We already have plenty of slow ways to do what you want (e.g. for integers we can go via Python ints, for other types we could use strings). So I would like a solution which is implementable 100% in Cython (in particular, there should be no Python methods/attributes involved).

Yes, something like that. Or perhaps the buffer protocol, if that's more convenient for some reason? Or even by asking the caller to pass an instance of Python extension class of a certain fixed form...

More or less for the same reason as the Debian packagers: to make it possible for Python interfaces to software using GMP, MPFR & co to be used in conjunction with Sage without necessarily being compiled with Sage support. For example, I am involved in a research project for which we developed a Python interface to [Sollya](http://sollya.gforge.inria.fr).

I don't think it is reasonable to move the Sage number types to an external package, if only because the Sage library is full of circular dependencies between modules. (And I don't see how to have conversions that don't go through Python at all without doing something like that...) However, I don't see the problem with trying to standardize a way to exchange, say, GMP, MPFR, MPFI, and perhaps FLINT/Arb objects between Python libraries (as originally suggested), or at least having an ad hoc solution to import/export these kinds of objects to/from Sage (as suggested in my comment).

I have been looking at `gmpy2` for the last hour or so. I think it could work to use the `gmpy2` types as intermediates for the proposed conversions.

The big issue is that `gmpy2` currently does not expose a C or Cython interface. So either we need to work with upstream to implement that or we need to fork `gmpy2`.

The C prototypes that I wrote are an illustration of what I would do if we were making the Python wrappers by hand instead of using Cython.

Of course, we should be making a Cython library with corresponding Cython prototypes.

You need to pass around `mpz_t` pointers but you cannot literally do that in Python: you need to wrap the `mpz_t` pointer in some Python object. And that's precisely what `gmpy2` does.

This is not exactly what I need for pypolymake. This library is just a Python interface to polymake (that is currently a mix of C++ and Perl). When the answer to some method is an integer I want the possibility to return a Sage integer (if it is used from Sage), a gmpy2 integer (if it is used from Python with gmpy2 available) or a Python integer.

This is the kind of template I have

```
cpdef my_integer_question():
    cdef mpz_t ans
    my_polymake_function(ans)
    return mpz_wrapper(ans)
```
And I want this `mpz_wrapper` parametrizable (on module loading or by the user). This is currently working but not very clean.

With your proposal, this function will have to go through `gmpy2` and then call a (possibly pure Python) conversion `gmpy2 -> whatever`.

```
cpdef my_integer_question():
    cdef mpz_t ans
    my_polymake_function(ans)
    my_gmpy2 = mpz_wrapper(ans)
    return gmpy2_converter(my_gmpy2)
```

I am not sure I prefer the gmpy2 version.

And actually, 2. is totally trivial to implement in like 10 lines of Cython code (you just need to store a pointer to a conversion function in a global variable). Ideally, this would be added to some existing project because it seems a bit overkill to create a separate Python project for just those 10 lines.

It's a cleaner design to pass an extra argument around. 

In my experience, global variables never solve a problem but only create new ones.

Vincent is the one who asked for this feature, so I'll let him discuss it with you.

Anyway, I would still like to know what you think of my idea to use `gmpy2` as "de facto" standard to pass around integers.
