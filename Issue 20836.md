# Issue 20836: remove a suggestion to move Sage tree from docs

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21073

Original creator: dimpase

Original creation time: 2016-07-21 13:45:36

CC:  slelievre

this is misleading:  http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/source.html#installation-in-a-multiuser-environment
says ``After building Sage, you may optionally copy or move the entire build tree to /usr/local or another location. `

Reported on sage-devel.

Looks good to me. I've only one comment: the last sentence at the end of the file `source.rst` should be updated to 

```
**This page was last updated in July 2016 (SageMath 7.3).**
```

Done (except that I kept "Sage" since that manual always uses "Sage" instead of "SageMath")
