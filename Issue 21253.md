`pandoc_attributes` is a dependency of `notedown`, which is a dependency of `rst_to_ipynb`.

Tarball can be found at https://github.com/aaren/pandoc-attributes/archive/8bc82f6d0d1421c7ba84b480748fb89269c6523e.zip and should be renamed `pandoc_attributes-8bc82f6d.zip`. See also https://lipn.univ-paris13.fr/~monteil/hebergement/tmp/pandoc_attributes-8bc82f6d.zip for a direct download.

Installation worked fine on 7.4.beta5 after downloading the file `pandoc_attributes-8bc82f6d.zip` in the upstream directory. I was able to test that the optional package works as expected using [examples](https://github.com/aaren/pandoc-attributes) from the github readme page.

Thanks for working on the `sage -rst2ipynb` which I soon want to run on some of my rst files.
