Just some PEP8 nitpicks:

```
def is_comparability(g, algorithm="greedy", certificate=False, check=True,
                     solver=None, verbose=0):
```


```
        comparability_test = is_comparability_MILP(g, certificate=certificate,
                                                   solver=solver, verbose=verbose)
```


```
        return (is_comparability(g, algorithm=algorithm, solver=solver, verbose=verbose) and
                is_comparability(g.complement(), algorithm=algorithm, solver=solver, verbose=verbose))
```

(and similar).
