Regarding the use of `cp -pr`, on OS X, the man page for cp (from "BSD General Commands Manual") says

```
COMPATIBILITY
     Historic versions of the cp utility had a -r option.  This implementation supports that
     option; however, its use is strongly discouraged, as it does not correctly copy special
     files, symbolic links, or fifo's.
```

It would be better to use `cp -pR`, I think.  (This also seems consistent with what I can find on the internet about POSIX standard options for cp.)

Fine.  GNU coreutils `cp` doesn't differentiate between `-r` and `-R` (they behave identically), so I was unaware of this.

Looks good to me.  Unnecessary note to release manager: make sure to run [attachment:fixdate.sh] on a system which uses GNU's version of `touch`; for example, this won't work on OS X.
