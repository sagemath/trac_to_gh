... by features.

This is so that users can make use of doctests conditionalized with "# optional" in their Sage programs even on distribution-packaged Sage installations.

I don't know about others but I do it badly. The current stuff allow some autodetection of what is installed by the sage package management system. That was not always the case. I remove the autodetection bits and add anything I want to test manually when running `sage -t`.

I'm just seeing this now after wondering why sage keeps searching my system for random broken programs to try to use. Runtime detection of these things will not be a good long-term approach:

1. You have to reimplement every spkg-configure.m4 in python for the feature check and keep them synchronized forever.
2. Runtime checks are run over and over again. And many are going to be slow, once they are made to return the right answers.
3. Distros track dependencies and usually don't want them to (dis)appear at runtime.
4. If I build sage with e.g. `--disable-lrslib`, I expect it to not search my system for something that looks like lrslib and use it anyway. There has to be a way to reliably disable things.

As an alternative, you can imagine a shared location where "features" record their existence (think pkg-config). The simplest implementation might be to create a file named after the feature to indicate that the feature is present.

Optional packages would touch `$FEATURESDIR/$PACKAGE` upon being detected or installed. That centralizes all of the detection code in spkg-configure.m4, and would eventually make `--disable-foo` work again. Distros could install a "feature file" for every feature that their distro package provides. Or if they don't mind the automagic dependencies, you could have (say) the "ffmpeg" package install the ffmpeg feature file to tell sage that ffmpeg is available. Of course this would only be done if the distro's ffmpeg package actually works with its sage. But it does allow the user to add features on a binary distro on-the-fly without the developers having to jump through too many hoops.

A more positive perspective on that would be that eventually, when we can assume that there is an at least mildly usable python3 available at `./configure` time, we can replace many `spkg-configure.m4` tests by Feature tests, written in Python.
