It doesn't matter whether you specify the embedding or not.

It's not really the pushout that's failing here:

I am not sure about this:

```python
        if latex_name is None and latex_names is not None:
            latex_name = latex_names
```

I would expect `latex_names` to be a tuple, so I would think the correct thing to do would be `latex_name = latex_names[0]`.
