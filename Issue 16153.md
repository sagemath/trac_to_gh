# Issue 16153: remove -patchbot option to sage

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: rws

Original creation time: 2014-05-23 09:00:58

As explained in https://github.com/robertwb/sage-patchbot/issues/35 and http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16377#comment:11, patchbot when started with `sage -patchbot` will clobber your Sage installation. This ticket will remove that option, as the underlying problem cannot be solved once and for all, i.e., it is possible to take care of known environment variables that affect unsafe patchbot runs, but any new variable will break such a solution.

This appears to work and, in conjunction with a fix for the setuptools problem, allows patchbot to test unsafe tickets successfully.
