Making a package for void-linux the `build` directory is not really needed. However the main sage binary tries to run `$SAGE_ROOT/build/bin/sage-site`, causing a warning, in particular failing a few doctests in `src/sage/tests/cmdline.py`, for instance:

```
**********************************************************************
File "/usr/lib/sage-9.5.beta9/src/sage/tests/cmdline.py", line 170, in sage.tests.cmdline.test_executable
Failed example:
    err  
Expected:
    ''   
Got:
    '/usr/lib/sage-9.5.beta9/src/bin/sage: line 133: /usr/lib/sage-9.5.beta9/build/bin/sage-site: No such file or directory\n'
**********************************************************************
```

Proposed solution: test that `sage-site` exists and is executable before trying to exec it.

I think you should just unset `SAGE_ROOT` in your distro build.

I'm not setting `SAGE_ROOT`, this is set by the `sage` script itself (either the one at top-level directory, or the one in `src/bin/sage`).

I don't see an easy way to unset it.

In distribution packaging, the `SAGE_ROOT/sage` script should not be used.

The installed `src/bin/sage` script gets `SAGE_ROOT` from `sage-env-config`. This configuration file can be adjusted by your build scripts.

My first try was using `--prefix` and installing only `SAGE_LOCAL`. However, binaries are not installed so now I install `SAGE_ROOT/local` and `SAGE_ROOT/src` which works ok. It may be better if there was an option to install the binaries into `SAGE_LOCAL/bin` with `SAGE_ROOT` unset.

OTOH, where would I place the src? Isn't it necessary for `??` to work?

Yes, `--without-sage-venv` makes SAGE_VENV equal to SAGE_LOCAL.

This is implied by using `--prefix`.

`SAGE_SRC` uses the installed Python package directory when `SAGE_ROOT` is unset.
https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/develop/src/sage/env.py#L182

This makes `??` work for `.py` files (but not `.pyx` files)

That could work... isn't `[ -d "$SAGE_ROOT" ]` equivalent?


OTOH, for a distro package I rather have `SAGE_ROOT` unset so it might be nice to have a configure option for that rather than patching.

So far I know two places where I have to patch:
- `SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage-env-config`
- `SAGE_LOCAL/lib/python*/site-packages/sage-conf.py`

There's also `src/bin/sage-src-env-config` but that doesn't seem to be installed into `SAGE_LOCAL/bin`.

Hi there,

I can explain to you how sage-on-gentoo is packaged if you need pointers. I do remove a number of things that are not needed for distros, or that would break. Right now sage is in a transition and is splitting in a number of new packages that make things a bit awkward if you are just starting.

I just found this ticket, I think it's related to a problem I see as well.
I'm building Sage 9.5 from source, also using `--prefix ...`.
It works fine, so, OK. But, each time it starts up:


```
/opt/sage/bin/sage-env: line 122: cd: /home/sage/sage: No such file or directory
Warning: overwriting SAGE_ROOT environment variable:
Old SAGE_ROOT=/home/sage/sage
New SAGE_ROOT=
```


In particular, there are no sources in `/home/sage/sage` any more. I think the content of `./bin/sage-env` needs to be different under these configuration settings, it shouldn't set `SAGE_ROOT`.

I guess `NEW_SAGE_ROOT` should be a directory because of how it's defined, but why not check again?

I'm not quite sure why the last `if` block that I quoted isn't nested within the earlier one (the one checking whether `"$SAGE_ROOT" != "$NEW_SAGE_ROOT"`, etc.).

I built Sage with `./configure --prefix=DIR`. Then I did `cd DIR` and ran `./bin/sage -t (old_sage_root)/src/sage/tests/cmdline.py` and tests passed. Not a surprise, I think. Then I moved `(old_sage_root)` to `(new_location)` and ran `./bin/sage -t (new_location)/src/sage/tests/cmdline.py` and it failed:

```
././bin/sage-env: line 122: cd: (old_sage_root): No such file or directory
```

In fact I get the same error just running `./bin/sage`.

Line 122 is

```
    NEW_SAGE_ROOT=`cd "$NEW_SAGE_ROOT" && pwd -P`
```

In the test a few lines earlier

```
if [ -n "$SAGE_ROOT" ]; then
    NEW_SAGE_ROOT="$SAGE_ROOT"
```

should this be `-d`?

Sage builds now, but I am still struggling with other aspects.

- `./configure --prefix=PREFIX`
- `make build`
- `cd ..; mkdir TEMP; mv SAGE_ROOT TEMP`
- `cd PREFIX`
- Then `./bin/sage` worked!
- But right after that, `./bin/sage -testall` failed, and then further attempts at `./bin/sage` failed, all with complaints from `sage-location`:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/palmieri/Desktop/Sage/sage_builds/TESTING/NEW33127/X/bin/sage-location", line 102, in <module>

    s2 = os.stat(f2)
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: ''
```

(The path for `sage-location` is `PREFIX/bin/sage-location`.)
