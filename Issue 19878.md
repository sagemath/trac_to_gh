# Issue 19878: Line cannot handle a number of graphics option

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20115

Original creator: kcrisman

Original creation time: 2016-02-25 18:32:39


```
sage: line([(0,0),(1,1)],fontsize=20,legend_label='G',legend_font_size=20)
RuntimeError: Error in line(): option 'legend_font_size' not valid.
```

And many others.  Interestingly, the legend label itself works.

(Presumably some of the other graphics primitives also suffer from this, so anyone working on this should try things out fairly comprehensively.)
