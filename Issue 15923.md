This ticket organize the integration of flat surface code from several developers into Sage. The order of integration might roughly follows:
  * #14683: new datastructure for iet
  * #16159: quadratic strata
  * #16102: Lyapunov exponents strata and their covering constructions
  * #9806: constellations (ramified cover of the sphere from a topological/combinatorial point of view)
  * #16018: conjugacy class iterator
  * separatrix diagrams (ticket coming)
  * [Ronen Mukamel code](http://math.uchicago.edu/~ronen/software/triangulated_surface.tar.gz) (ticket coming)
  * Vincent Delecroix code on origamis (ticket coming)

It can be closed as soon as all of the above code is integrated into Sage.
