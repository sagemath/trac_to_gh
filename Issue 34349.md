I'm not convinced that a broken build is worse than the build working and then having many things broken at runtime (all the test failures reported in #34537). If anything, system 2.15 should be rejected until #34537 is merged.

We should disallow using of pari 2.15 from the system. I'll make patch - we already getting many reports on sage-devel etc due to this issus.

Not sure if relevant for Sage, but the giac test suite segfaults here with pari 2.15 (after applying the build fix).
