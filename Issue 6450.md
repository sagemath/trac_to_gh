Changing keywords from "" to "generic group documentation".

Thanks for working on this!  It's a great thing to have this file appearing in the reference manual.

I checked that the docs built ok after the patch (which applied fine to 4.1.alpha2), then added a second patch which tidies up the documentation a bit -- since I wrote most of it, I thought that was my duty.

ylchapuy, if you approve of my additional patch then you can give this a postive review.
