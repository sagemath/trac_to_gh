#14561 will introduce a unicode Sha to the docs, this is hacked around in the patch so we don't have to mess with cyrillic fonts. I don't think that this one character in the pdf version merits any further work, though reviewer patches are of course welcome...

Is it still shipped with TeXLive?
By the way, how do you figure out what is shipped within a given TeXLive distribution?

Does not seem to be shipped in Ubuntu's TeXLive packages... surely because using the TeXLive package manager on top of Ubuntu's one is not supported and will never be and I don't really want to use my own TeXLive install rather than what Ubuntu/Debian provides.
I can still do "apt-file search utf8x.def", but my Debian install already uses some preview of TeXLive 2013, and it still provides utf8x.def in the texlive-latex-extra package which from its description might indeed not be from vanilla TeXLive.

OK; I also checked that this patch works with `TeXLive 2012` distribution (with Russian support installed, naturally). On the other hand, it also has

```
-rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel  8036 Apr 21  2012 texmf-dist/tex/latex/ucs/utf8x.def

So " that doesn't even ship with `TeXLive-2012`" is not correct.

I was asking whether we can replace the current patch with one-char patch, removing `x` from `utf8x` in the line

```
latex_elements['inputenc'] = '\\usepackage[utf8x]{inputenc}'
```

By itself this is not necessarily a problem, there are certainly Sage packages which are no longer developed. Of course it's better to use newer packages, but my impression is that there is no obvious replacement for `utf8x`, so maybe we should just leave it...

But I don't know much about `TeX`, I'm just guessing based on the discussion above.

> I also agree that we should get rid of `utf8x`. I wasn't that excited about it when it first went in (in #8036), so I'm happy to see its removal.

I don't see why this is needed. `utf8x` is a part of maintained, since 2011, [ucs package](http://ctan.org/pkg/ucs); #8036 is older, and indeed at that point `utf8x` was an orphan. It is a slight extension (and very useful) of standard LaTeX, so what?

E.g. I don't see how you can avoid `utf8x` in the [example](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/attachment/ticket/8036/utf8.tex) on #8036, at least without Babel. That is, if you write some unicode `Ж` (different from `Ш`, which is taken care of) somewhere, it won't display right in pdf, and may even fail to compile with `pdflatex`.

the fact that `biblatex` (a `contrib` package we don't use, AFAIK) is not compatible with `ucs` (another `contrib` package) does not mean we should rush to change what we have, I think. Note that `biblatex` is incompatible with lots of other packages, cf. [Sect 1.5.4](http://www.math.upenn.edu/tex_docs/latex/biblatex/biblatex.pdf). 

Do you know any other packages incompatible with `ucs`? I don't.
