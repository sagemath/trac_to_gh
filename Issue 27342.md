This ticket introduces a new technique for finding median of graph : [ ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_of_medians)  
This algorithm runs at complexity of O(n) in worst case and will be a good addition to sage stats module.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27579

Implementation of median_of_medians code is done. Algorithm does run fast as compared to the one in function median(), but still slow compared to it's expectation.
Results:

sage: A = [randint(0,i*100) for i in range (0,5000000)]
sage: median_of_medians(A,len(A)//2)
sage: median(A)

The method says that it returns the `i-th` smallest integer in the array, but in the examples, you return the `(i+1)-th`.

The examples are for small values, but you have hardcoded `items_per_column = 1000`. Thus, your tests are only for `sorted(A)[i]`.

Please add a description of the algorithm. Otherwise, it's very hard to  check your code.

Do you really need recursive calls ? can't you avoid that ?

and why choosing `1000` ?

I will change it.

Yeah sure.

Actually no, I have a way to remove recursive calls, let me code it!

As mentioned above, it gave the best results among '10','100','1000','10000'and '100000'.

Thanks!

Apparently numpy has implemented introselect algorithm which is a mix of median_of_median and quickselct algorithm, and works quite fast as compared to the algorithm implemented in current branch.

 Introselect: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introselect     
 
 numpy library function :-https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.partition.htm

I have made a new branch in which numpy library algorithm is called rather the one implemented above.
Or should i have both codes and let user decide which one should be implemented.

If there is a faster and simpler method, there is no need for adding another one, and in view of the proposed method, I think there is no need for adding `i_smallest`. The added value to Sagemath seems rather limited here.

So I suggest to change the milestone to wontfix.
