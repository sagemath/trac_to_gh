Setting a new milestone for this ticket based on a cursory review.

This seems like it extends existing functionality. There is already a possible periods function for the rationals, see `possible_periods`. This ticket seems to extend that functionality to function fields, so we should add to the existing function instead of creating a new one.

Further, what algorithm is this based on? You mention a paper by Hutz, which paper is it?

In dimension 1, this is not from my paper. As Alex said, this should be part of the `possible_periods` function rather than a new function. Similarly, the `mod` function it depends on should be part of `change_ring`.

Although since e can be unbounded in this case (see Silverman Arithmetic of Dynam. Sys. exercise 2.22), so some thought needs to be given here on what should be implemented. I'm less familiar with the function field set-up. Can you get around this unbounded e problem by using multiple primes? When the function field has base ring a finite field, don't all the residue fields have the same characteristic so that you can't get around this problem?

My concern is that no matter what the user passes in for `e`, the function could be missing valid periods.

Stalled in `needs_review` or `needs_info`; likely won't make it into Sage 9.5.
