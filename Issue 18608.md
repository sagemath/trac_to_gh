I've updated three fuzzy/failing patching.

I've not touched the error callback patch which does not apply ass we have two solutions:
* update our patch,
* use the native NTL error callback mechanism, this can arguably be done elsewhere if the former solution is trivial.

There should still be trouble with flint, singular and friends.
From what I read flint is fixed in git master.
No clear idea about Singular. From what I read there is a fix upstream, but is it available for 3.x as we are stuck with that at the moment, or only for 4.x?

Could you test this on a usual arch?

You get the same errors as I do.

And I cannot get NTL to build with `NTL_LEGACY_SP_MULMOD=on` to check that the old `double` implem is still fine.

Sure, I just sent a report to Victor Shoup.

Note that it does not explain the failure in `bernmm` code with the new sp implem in (new) NTL.
It will just allow us to check that `bernmm` works as expected with the old sp implem in (new) NTL.

I'd say not quickly and I'm away for one week starting tonight.

I really have no idea why it does not work with the current patch.
The only way I see to understand this is to print everything bern_modp does to find the problem.
A small couple of problematic values is `k = 128` and `p = 7` (or another small prime).

So unless you see some obvious mistake in what I did, we can postpone the use of the new (and recommended upstream) sp implem for later.
We'll just need to remove one line in `spkg-install`.
