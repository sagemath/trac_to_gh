Keywords: lattice polytopes, reflexive

Currently, computing facets of a lattice polytope, changes whether it is reflexive or not.


```
sage: p = LatticePolytope([], lattice=ToricLattice(3).dual()); p
-1-d lattice polytope in 3-d lattice M
sage: a = p.faces()[0][0]
sage: p = LatticePolytope([], lattice=ToricLattice(3).dual()); p
-1-d lattice polytope in 3-d lattice M
sage: a = p.faces()[0][0]; a
-1-d lattice polytope in 3-d lattice M
sage: a.facet_normals()
Empty collection
in 3-d lattice N
sage: a
-1-d reflexive polytope in 3-d lattice M
```


We fix this by deleting a line in `compute_facets`, which applied a private definition of reflexivity to the polytope.

What do you mean its own definition??? It is the same definition as in other places and it does not overwrite ``is_reflexive`` but rather sets a cached value. However the code failed to check that the polytope is full-dimensional, so I'd much rather keep the old code and add the missing check rather than getting rid of an easy computation and triggering another one right away with `is_reflexive()` call.

Sorry. I was completely puzzled about this and exaggerated.

As you can probably tell, I stumbled open this trying to implement incidence matrix.

I still don't get the advantage of the current setup. Is it because we avoid making a copy of the constants?

What currently happens with `is_reflexive` is that it implicitly calls `compute_facets`, which computes the value for `is_reflexive`. However, `is_reflexive` now recomputes the value and returns it. I don't think this is ideal.

But my idea isn't perfect either.

It is still double calculation. Just executing the same code now.

Sorry for confusing code, believe me it used to be even more convoluted, especially with regard to determining and using reflexivity ;-) It still feels to me that this is a better fix.

Had to rebase.

This time I did not delete any trailing spaces etc. Implementing the incidence matrix in #28743 will take care of that.
