# Issue 12250: Python doesn't compile on Mac with GCC

From `/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreFoundation.framework/Headers/CFString.h` on `bsd` (and presumably other OS X systems):

```
#if defined(__GNUC__) && (__GNUC__*10+__GNUC_MINOR__ >= 42) && !defined(__INTEL_COMPILER) && (TARGET_OS_MAC || TARGET_OS_EMBEDDED)
#define CF_FORMAT_FUNCTION(F,A) __attribute__((format(CFString, F, A)))
#define CF_FORMAT_ARGUMENT(A) __attribute__((format_arg(A)))
#else
#define CF_FORMAT_FUNCTION(F,A)
#define CF_FORMAT_ARGUMENT(A)
#endif
```


Here Apple is assuming that gcc >= 4.2 will properly understand `_attribute__((format_arg()))` but this isn't true.  Obviously this works with XCode's C compiler, not with GCC.  A stupid workaround is to define `__INTEL_COMPILER` when compiling Python on OS X.

Closing this as wontfix, since gcc-4.6.2 does not have this problem.
