why remove the "Files previously patched" section when someone (you?) explicitly wrote "Do not delete that!"? Also, did David Kirkby's note become irrelevant?

I did not test, but the release manager said on sage-devel that we could trust that the author tested this ticket thoroughly ;)

So I'll just wait for Jeroen to answer these questions and then set this to positive review.

Replying to [comment:6 mstreng]:
> why remove the "Files previously patched" section when someone (you?) explicitly wrote "Do not delete that!"?
I certainly did not add the "files previously patched" section, not ask that it doesn't get deleted.  I removed it because
1. it causes me more effort than needed when removing a patch.
2. those who want to see previous patches can always check the Mercurial history or download an older version of Sage.
3. it's not even clear why we should keep a record of those historical patches in that file.

> Also, did David Kirkby's note become irrelevant?
Yes. The flags in that comment are no longer added by upstream PARI and the workaround isn't needed.

> I did not test, but the release manager said on sage-devel that we could trust that the author tested this ticket thoroughly ;)
I did indeed test this as much as I could.
