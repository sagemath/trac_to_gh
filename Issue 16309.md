Given an instance of MSNC problem (a directed acyclic graph, a set of source nodes, a set of sink nodes, each source node having some source variables and each sink node wanting some source variables). Use single element extension of matroids to enumerate the codes with additional option to compute the rate region (set of all rate tuples) achievable over given finite field.
