It seems that inheriting from `Mutability` causes a pickling test. Probably that is the reason why it is endowed with this method.

This is exactly the reason why we remove `__reduce__` from `Mutability`. But even then, pickling is tested (see #30280).

This `__reduce__` method is bad because it it tries to unpickle anything as a `Mutability` object. So a Python class that inherits from this must then contend with this, which puts more of burden on the implementer. Perhaps there is a better way to do this, but it is not immediate to me how to do this...

I really think this should be removed. However, we need to make sure that when we pickle and unpickle an immutable object `X` it remains immutable.
