# Issue 24895: Define the class of SuperPartitions

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25132

CC:  tscrim alauve darij

Keywords: IMA coding sprint,  combinatorics combinatorics, Hopf algebras

These combinatorial objects index the space of symmetric polynomials in
two sets of variables, one commuting and one anti-commuting, and they
are known as symmetric functions in super space (hence the origin of the
name super partitions).

Super partitions may be input in two different formats: one as a pair
consisiting of fermionic (strict partition) and a bosonic (partition) part
and as a list of integer values where the negative entries come first
and are listed in strict order followed by the positive values in weakly
decreasing order.

A super partition is displayed as two partitions separated by a semicolon
as a default.  Super partitions may also be displayed as a weakly increasing
sequence of integers that are strict if the numbers are not positive.

Changing keywords from "IMA coding sprint,  combinatorics combinatorics, Hopf algebras" to "IMA coding sprint, CHAs".

Note: #25163 is the follow up ticket and the reason for implementing this object.
