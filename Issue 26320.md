# Issue 26320: Common code for p-adic exp and log

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/26557

The new Tate algebra code in #26195 duplicated code for computing log and exponentials from `padic_generic_element.pyx`.  It would be good to extract this functionality out into a function that could be called by both, and also used for things like matrices.
