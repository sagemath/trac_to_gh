CC:  @jhpalmieri @dimpase @embray

Whilst trying to package sagemath for Debian: https://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/debian-science/packages/sagemath.git/

During the docbuild, if I run:

```
$ find ./src/doc/en/reference/ -type f -exec ls -l --time-style=long-iso '{}' \; | sort -k6,7
```

I can see that the `.rst` files get touched during the docbuild. This breaks incremental build and makes it very time-consuming to debug segfaults.

I have already tried applying `build/pkgs/sphinx/patches/environment.patch` to my system sphinx. The patch applies, but the above behaviour remains.

Is this the same as #21611?

No, it's definitely different. This is about incremental build, errors are not relevant.

More information: the doctrees and inventory is currently getting built in `~/.local/share/sagemath/doc`, but the rst files are being built in `sage.git/src/doc/en/reference` and they're being deleted and re-written every time.

Ok, here is the patch I'm using. Incremental build works again, but as you can see, it's quite a hack and I don't know how this affects the rest of sage. https://xkcd.com/1739/ is relevant, sigh.

OK, it looks like memory usage is not really improved directly. If I try the docbuild from scratch, my system will still fail it with an OOM.

However, this patch allows me to re-run the build - now it will skip the already-built stuff, proceed directly to the memory-intensive "Merging environment/index files" step, and this time it will *succeed*. This suggests that there is a rather bad memory leak in the docbuilder - the skipped stuff was unnecessary to perform the merging, yet it still used up enough memory to crash the docbuilder the first time around.
