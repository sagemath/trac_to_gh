CC:  @EmmanuelCharpentier @embray @kiwifb @kcrisman @slel @timokau @orlitzky

The aim of this ticket is to allow Sage to use the system's `R`, instead of building its own.

It should work for:
- `sage -R` command
- Sage's `r` interface
- Sage's `rpy2` Python package
- Sage's jupyter `IRkernel`

As for atlas, it is done by setting the ``SAGE_R_LIB`` environment variable.

I think that if the system has `R` installed, people should run it by running `R`, not `sage -R`. So I think if Sage is going to use the system's `R`, there is no need for command `sage -R` – it adds the 6 extra characters `sage -` for no reason – and it should be disabled.

If Sage is not going to install a copy of `R`, then you could rewrite the main `sage` script so that `sage -R` prints a deprecation warning before executing the system's R`.

I don't really buy your ambiguity argument, and I think that you are misleading people if `sage -R` runs a version of R which was not installed by Sage.

If you really want to proceed, note that `sage -h` contains

```
  -cython [...]       -- run Cython with given arguments
  -ecl [...]          -- run Common Lisp
  -gap [...]          -- run Sage's Gap with given arguments

so maybe they should all omit "Sage's". I won't be happy with that change, so you'll need another reviewer, and I also think you should ask for more opinions.

That's not true that there is no reason for it.  For example, what if you want to run R in the Sage environment so that you can run sage commands in R with RPy?  Or interface with other software that is included in the Sage distribution?  From the user's perspective, `sage -R` means "launch the R that sage is using".  It's transparent/irrelevant whether or not the R command happened to be included in the Sage distribution or not.  For downstream distributions (e.g. on Debian, Gentoo) they are all using the system's copies of programs as much as possible, so you'll just have confused users who find that `sage -R` works on some system but not others.

Is there still anything to do here? I don't really use R inside or outside of sage... has #28884 caused any problems?
