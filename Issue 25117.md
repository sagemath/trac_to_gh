Keywords: packaging

Since in `nix` every python package is in its own directory (as opposed to all python packages being in the python directory), I need to add the cysignals dir to include_directories.

Debian [adds](https://salsa.debian.org/science-team/sagemath/blob/58bbba93a807ca2933ca317501d093a1bb4b84db/debian/patches/d0-libgap-sage.patch#L84) a custom libgap path.

This patch makes it possible to extend the `include_directories` by setting a `PATH`-like, colon seperated environment variable `SAGE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`.

So how does this work? Are all those directories then added to `sys.path`?

I have some doubts about your patch because it should just work even if cysignals is installed in a different directory. So I'd like to see exactly what fails when you don't add any new include directories.

Now that I think about it its a bit weird, because I chose the second (symlink tree) option for sage (necessary because sage interfaces with the `python` binary). Even if my use-case didn't exist, there would still be the debian use case.

I don't have any build results cached, so I'll have to do a full rebuild to find the exact error. So that'll take a while.

I didn't literally mean just ignoring it. But you could for example add a patch to nixos to remove that test.

I don't think so because Cython uses `sys.path` to resolve `cimport` statements. It's only `include` statements which are problematic, but the `.pxi` files are deprecated so `include` should not be used.

If I needed to patch sage anyways, I might as well add the include.

I'll close this for now. If another use case comes up, we can always reconsider.
