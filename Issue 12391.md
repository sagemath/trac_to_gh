Since #12329, sympy might be installed after the Sage library.  The sympy `setup.py` imports lots of stuff, including `sage` itself.  One nasty consequence is that `sage-cleaner` can get started because of this.

The solution is to start `setup.py` with python's `-S` option to start Python with a minimal `sys.path`.
