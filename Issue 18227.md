`exec` does not spawn a new process, it replaces the current one.

ok, then I must admit that I am not able to do the job..

Just remove the `exec`...

But anyway, it's the wrong fix anyway: `make doc` should _just work_ in all cases (like it did until a year ago or so).

I think we should indeed fix `make doc` and close this as "wontfix".
