As reported on [sage-release](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-release/kU5M1QVuQQY/4ClWRtgMBAAJ), when building Sage 9.1.beta9 from a path that is a symbolic link, the following test in `src/sage/env.py` fails:


```
    sage: env = {k:v for (k,v) in os.environ.items() if not k.startswith("SAGE_")}
    sage: from subprocess import check_output
    sage: cmd = "from sage.all import SAGE_ROOT, SAGE_LOCAL; print((SAGE_ROOT, SAGE_LOCAL))"
    sage: out = check_output([sys.executable, "-c", cmd], env=env).decode().strip()   # long time
    sage: out == repr((SAGE_ROOT, SAGE_LOCAL))                                        # long time
```


The problem is that the left path in `out` is the symbolic link to Sage's root directory, whereas `SAGE_ROOT` is the absolute path without symbolic link.

Another way to see this problem directly:

```
./sage -sh
(sage-sh)$ unset SAGE_ROOT
(sage-sh)$ python3
>>> from sage.all import SAGE_ROOT
>>> SAGE_ROOT     # outputs the symbolic link, not the physical path
```


Rather than changing the doctest to use abspath, it seems that in both cases `SAGE_ROOT` should already be a path without symbolic links in it.

I am not sure where `SAGE_ROOT` is initialized for the Python executable. I tried to replace `pwd` by `pwd -P` in `build/bin/sage-get-system-packages`, but it did not help, unless the value is cached somewhere.

Maybe it's just not a good doctest. Why do we care what the Python executable thinks SAGE_ROOT is? The top-level `sage` script sets SAGE_ROOT and attempts to resolve all symbolic links. Does that work properly?

Note that this doctest is new as of 9.1.beta9. Maybe we should revert back to something closer to what was in beta8.

I assume this is a step towards making sagelib more usable from Python. Previously, SAGE_ROOT was just `None`.

Yes, that works as usual.

As of 9.2.beta3, I get a lot more test failures when building Sage in a location that is a symbolic link. The problem is that SAGE_ROOT changes between the symbolic link and the real path. For example:

I think it needs to be investigated whether the `resolvelinks` logic in `src/bin/sage-env` serves any useful purpose. My guess is that it probably was motivated by the filesystem relocation mechanism for SAGE_ROOT, which has been defunct for years.

Comment by @mwageringel created at 2020-07-05 19:08:23

Just for the record, the new behaviour is a result of #25486.


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2020-07-05 19:14:20

That's right.

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2020-07-07 21:08:55

`resolvelinks` seems to have been introduced in #5852.

It seems that `resolvelinks` is not related to this, as it messes with relative links, not absolute ones.

I think the problem is that `src/bin/sage-env-config` sets `SAGE_ROOT` to the symbolic link after running configure from the symbolic location. Rerunning configure from the physical location sets `SAGE_ROOT` back to the physical path.

Should this problem be handled in `src/bin/sage-env-config.in` or in `src/bin/sage-env`?

From the comments at the top of `src/bin/sage-env-config.in`:

```
#  - This file is only for setting immediate values.  Any kind of conditionals
#    or computed values are to be set by src/bin/sage-env after sourcing this
#    file.
```

Are you saying that the only setting in which you observe the reported warnings is when you manually call `configure` with different `SAGE_ROOT`s? 

Then I'm not sure if anything needs to be fixed.

In `$SAGE_ROOT/src/bin/sage-env`:

```
# Make NEW_SAGE_ROOT absolute
NEW_SAGE_ROOT=`cd "$NEW_SAGE_ROOT" && pwd -P`
```


In `$SAGE_ROOT/sage`:

```
# Make SAGE_ROOT absolute
SAGE_ROOT=`cd "$SAGE_ROOT" && pwd -P`
```


Of course, these comments are not precise. The `-P` option makes these directories not just "absolute" but actually "physical" (all symlinks resolved).

In contrast, in `$SAGE_ROOT/src/bin/sage-env-config.in`:

```
export SAGE_ROOT="@abs_top_srcdir@"
```

autoconf's ``@`abs_top_srcdir`@`` is only absolute, but not physical.

Also, in `configure.ac`, the `$SAGE_ROOT` is made physical:

```
# Assume current directory is SAGE_ROOT.
SAGE_ROOT=`pwd -P`
```

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2020-07-14 19:03:02

I see two possible fixes:

a) Get rid of all the above `-P`. It's up the user to express the `SAGE_ROOT` using whatever symlinks they like to use.  Use `pwd -P` only for the following: Issue the warning regarding changing `SAGE_ROOT` in `sage-env` only if they do not resolve to the same physical path.

b) `AC_SUBST(SAGE_ROOT)` and change `export SAGE_ROOT="`@`abs_top_srcdir`@`"` to `...`@`SAGE_ROOT`@``.

`./configure` determines `SAGE_ROOT` automatically, without explicitly setting it, but the result depends on whether the current directory is symbolic or not.

I prefer option b), since with a) it is confusing if the behavior depends on the (symbolic) path that was used to cd into SAGE_ROOT. If, for example, I open a new tab from SAGE_ROOT, the current directory is always the physical path, so it is easy to confuse the two.

Option b) seems to work for me, but to test this on the affected machine I first need to install dependencies for bootstrap.

Comment by @mwageringel created at 2020-07-15 20:22:48

Ok, this works for me now. With this branch, SAGE_ROOT will always be the absolute physical path, like it used to be until recently. In particular, the doctest from the description works now.

SAGE_LOCAL was already the physical path, so nothing needs to be changed for that.
