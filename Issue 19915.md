# Issue 19915: add monomial functions to MPolynomialRing_polydict

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20152

Original creator: bhutz

Original creation time: 2016-03-03 17:26:47

Assignee: bhtuz

To enable groebner basis for rings such as Zmod(large integer) the monomial functions need to written for MPolynomialRing_polydict.

Since they are currently written for MPolynomialRing_polydict_domain, which inherits from MPolynomialRing_polydict. This is just a matter of moving them to the parent class.

The functions in question are:

```
monomial_quotient
monomial_lcm
monomial_reduce
monomial_divides
monomial_pairwise_prime
monomial_all_divisors
```

A few suggestions for the documentation follow. Once corrected, you can set the ticket to `positive_review`.
* In `monomial_quotient` and `monomial_all_divisors`, please add a space after `self,`:
  {{{#!diff
  -    def monomial_quotient(self,f, g, coeff=False):
  +    def monomial_quotient(self, f, g, coeff=False):
  -    def monomial_all_divisors(self,t):
  +    def monomial_all_divisors(self, t):
  }}}
* In the documentation of `monomial_reduce`, please replace the single backticks by double backticks.

Changes made. Thanks for reviewing this.

Since you have to go back and add your name for 'Reviewer', I'll let you mark it positive_review as well.
