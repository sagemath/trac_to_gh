LGTM. Let us wait a few days to give dkrenn a chance to have a look on it and then feel free to set to positive unless dkrenn objects.

Why do we need make `offset` explicit in

```
-    def from_recurrence(self, *args, **kwds):
+    def from_recurrence(self, *args, offset=0):
```

? Shouldn't it suffices (as done) in

```
+    def __call__(self, *args, offset=0):
```


Apart from this, changes LGTM

Briefly tested using `**kwds` (on #31787); seems to work.
