This should also be done through the backend `normaliz` with the version coming after 3.5.3. The call to get the `ehrhart_polynomial` in normaliz will be facilitated and would be nice to have too.

The upgrade to normaliz 3.5.3 is here: #22984.

Let's start with `ZZ`.

In `base_ZZ.py` (structure looks great):

- You can correct the doctests later (this might save time)
- `ehrhart_polynomial`: empty line after INPUT, and period at the end of engine description.
- Eventually replace the third input by the description in the `_latte` method.
- the current check `if self.is_empty():` located at the beginning of `_ehrhart_polynomial_latte` could be moved to the public `ehrhart_polynomial`.

In `backend_normaliz.py`:

- looks good!

- I am tempted to simply make the definition of the two `_ehrhart_polynomial_normaliz` as alias:


```
    _ehrhart_polynomial_normaliz = _ehrhart_quasi_polynomial_normaliz
```


- The check `if self.is_empty():` of `_ehrhart_quasi_normaliz` can be safely removed since the function should not be reached if it is empty since it is dealt with in the front function. I believe the same could also be checked for compactness in the front function (in `base_ZZ` and `base_QQ`).

Here are some small edits to be done:

- You can forget my previous comment abour the heading space added.

- No spaces are needed between equality in the definition of a function:


```diff
- def _ehrhart_quasipolynomial_normaliz(self,variable = 't'):
+ def _ehrhart_quasipolynomial_normaliz(self,variable='t'):
```


- The output should be related to the data structure, without much details of what they are. The text with details should then be moved after the one-line description of the function to explain the output.


```diff
        OUTPUT:

-        If it is a polynomial, returns the polynomial. Otherwise, returns a
-        tuple of rational polynomials whose length is the quasi-period of the
-        quasi-polynomial and each rational polynomial describes a residue class.

+        A polynomial or tuple of polynomials.
```


- Most examples in doctests with text explanations should be moved to the public function without underscore so that they are accessible to the users. Then the examples of the private functions should show that they work as needed and that raising Errors are done appropriately.

- Some formating of variables are missing (see http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html):


```diff
- * None (default): When no input is given the Ehrhart polynomial
+ * ``None`` (default): When no input is given the Ehrhart polynomial
```


- it is conventional to use lower cases for objects:


```diff
- sage: Line_Seg = Polyhedron(vertices=[[0],[1/2]],backend='normaliz')
+ sage: line_seg = Polyhedron(vertices=[[0],[1/2]],backend='normaliz')
```

I forgot that we could have put it to needs review to get some bot feedback already, but it was still quite under constant development.

Once the merge conflict is resolved, it could benefit from some bot-runs before another round of review.

As this function is a good example of interfacing of normaliz, I would say it is worth to make it a robust and clean model for other eventual methods using normaliz. It is in quite good shape, once it is on needs review, I would check again if we covered all the intricate cases of backends and base rings...
