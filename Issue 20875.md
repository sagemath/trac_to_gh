The elementary symmetric polynomials of the multiplier spectra of a projective morphism will defined over the base ring. Currently, they are QQbar elements.

Returns "NameError: global name 'NonImplementedError' is not defined" for morphisms of higher dimensional projective spaces.


```
R.<t> = QQ[]
K.<a> = NumberField(t^2-2)
P.<x,y,z> = ProjectiveSpace(K,2)
H = End(P)
f = H([x^2, y^2, x*y])
f.sigma_invariants(1)
```

```
P.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(QQ,1)
H = End(P)
f = H([x^2 + y^2, x*y])
f.sigma_invariants(3)
```

returns just two values (should be 4)



```
P.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(QQ,1)
H = End(P)
f = H([x^2 + y^2, x*y])
f.sigma_invariants(1)
```

returns "AttributeError: 'sage.rings.integer.Integer' object has no attribute
'univariate_polynomial'"
