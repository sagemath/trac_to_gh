# Issue 21317: Document noninteger assumption in Maxima

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: kcrisman

Original creation time: 2016-09-21 14:39:57

Keywords: beginner

It turns out that not only can one declare integer, one can declare noninteger.  See [here](http://maxima.sourceforge.net/docs/manual/maxima_11.html#Item_003a-integer).  Let's add an example pointing this out, perhaps with the example from [this question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39612476/declare-a-variable-as-not-an-integer-in-sage-maxima-solve/).

I am interested in working on this. How do I start?

First, http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/index.html

and please use the Google group sage-devel for questions unrelated to this specific ticket.

I am interested in adding an example to fix this. How do I know in which part of the sage directory is this located? I guess it is in src/doc/

Nope, you would have to find an appropriate place.  The src/doc is mostly auto-generated.  Instead, try to add to the documentation for the command mentioned in the [question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39612476/declare-a-variable-as-not-an-integer-in-sage-maxima-solve/) mentioned in the ticket description.  The `solve` command is in src/sage/symbolic/relation.py or at least that is one place.

In such cases you can set positive again yourself.

With all respect, 

```
In case one of the solutions while solving an equation is a real number::
```

makes little sense, in particular in the context of this ticket. I'm requesting a clarification on #21946

Yea, I can change that statement to a more clear one. Also, #21946 and this ticket are not dependent.

this ticket is closed. Any changes to the branches here will be ignored. (So it should go to another ticket, say #21946) But still, your branch did not and does not make sense. The purpose of this ticket is to document and provide a test for `noninteger` assumption. E.g. 

```
sage: var('K')
K
sage: assume(K, 'noninteger')
sage: solve([K^2==1],K)
[]
```

The doctring should say what this test doing: it is showing how to use this type of assumption, and not something about reals. (Yes, I agree that the link for an example in the ticket description is somewhat misleading, but, well...)

even better example:

```
sage: solve([K^3==1],K)
[K == 1/2*I*sqrt(3) - 1/2, K == -1/2*I*sqrt(3) - 1/2]
```

Yea, I will replace the existing example with the example given above in #21946
