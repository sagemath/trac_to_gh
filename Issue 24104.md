very boring ticket, I admit.. still an enhancement nevertheless

By quick look:

Shouldn't the correction `if len(s) > 0` => `if len(s)` be just `if s`?

Exception strings should start with lowercase and not end with dot. (At least when they are only one sentence.)

No time for more just now.

ok, let me assume that this will never be reviewed (too many changes).

Please close.

This seems fine to me?  I agree with Jori's point about `len(s)` but it's not so important either.
