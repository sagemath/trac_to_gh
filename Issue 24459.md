CC:  frederichan

`hash_map` was deprecated with C++11 but is still available with gcc installations, e.g., in `/usr/bin/../lib64/gcc/x86_64-suse-linux/4.8/../../../../include/c++/4.8/backward/hash_map:83`. That's presumably why there was no need for giac authors to switch to `unordered_map`. However clang installations do not have it or pick it out of gcc include paths, leading to compile failure with `CC=clang` on OpenSuSE Leap 42.3:


```
In file included from input_lexer.ll:48:
In file included from ./giacPCH.h:8:
./index.h:571:11: error: no template named 'hash_map' in namespace 'std'; did yo
u mean '__gnu_cxx::hash_map'?
  typedef std::hash_map< index_t,index_m,hash_function_object > hash_index ;
          ^~~~~~~~~~~~~
          __gnu_cxx::hash_map
/usr/bin/../lib64/gcc/x86_64-suse-linux/4.8/../../../../include/c++/4.8/backward
/hash_map:83:11: note: '__gnu_cxx::hash_map' declared here
    class hash_map
          ^
```

Possibly a missing system package should be installed, or a shell compile option be added? Ultimately however `unordered_map` should be used.
