They are an issue when using sage outside of sage-the-distribution. They make it necessary that either the arb version used is the exact arb version sage-the-distribution uses or that patches are applied to sage. With tolerances we could potentially update sage and arb independently. And this is not only an issue for distributions. It could in the long run also allow sage-the-distribution to use the system's arb version (#24919).

In my opinion ideal sage tests should only fail if something is actually broken in sage, upstream projects or packaging. "broken" here may be an actual error or a api change.
