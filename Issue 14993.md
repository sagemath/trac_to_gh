Given a graph G, the following error occurs when trying to compute its distance matrix


```
sage: G = Graph(G, data_structure='static_sparse')
sage: G.distance_matrix()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This appears to have been fixed at some point; probably by #15623.
