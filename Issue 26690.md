Given a quadratic number field, conversion to Python floating point is terribly slow compared to the more complicated MPFI interval floating point conversion

```
sage: %timeit float(a)
1000 loops, best of 3: 224 Âµs per loop
sage: %timeit RIF(a)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 919 ns per loop
```

    "body": "I agree it should be fast, but I'm not sure it should be *that* fast.

That can be quite tricky, especially with high powers of fundamental units, where one conjugate will have large absolute value (easy to compute) and the other has small absolute value. If you compute these by first writing out the unit as `a+b*sqrt(d)` and then compute the embedding, it's quite a bit of work to get the precision right (due to a large amount of cancellation).

I agree it should be fast, but I'm not sure it should be *that* fast. It's not so strange to expect that if they transfer an algebraic number into `RealField(100)`, they actually get something on which (close to) 100 digits are correct.

If people need super-fast coversions, they should probably have a recipe to do so. I don't think the standard coercions are the place to sacrifice accuracy for speed.

Oh, sorry. The same applies to the 53 bits that float has, though. So I'd suggest to share the same code between the two.

Code looks good to me, but there are some failing doctests says the patchbot. I think they are all related to the exception raised in case of complex values.

And, there should be doctests covering the else-branch of the outer if, and maybe one as well which raises the exception.
