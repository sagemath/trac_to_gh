Log of integer to base 1/n can have nonsymbolic results but this is not recognized in `Integer::log()`:

```
sage: ZZ(8).log(1/2)
log(8)/log(1/2)
```
nor in `Integer.exact_log()`:

```
sage: ZZ(8).exact_log(1/2)
...
TypeError: no conversion of this rational to integer
```

I would avoid doing the `exact_log` twice:

```python
        if type(m) == Integer and type(self) == Integer:
             elog = self.exact_log(m):
             if m**elog == self:
                 return elog
```
Similarly for the other one. Otherwise LGTM.
