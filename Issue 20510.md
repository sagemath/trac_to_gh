Wouldn't this test

```python
if self._hasse_diagram.size() > n*log(n, 2)/2:
    return False
```

be better done in the `HasseDiagram.is_semidistributive`, so all methods which call it benefit?

The function at `hasse_diagram.py` does not return a Boolean, but `None` or a tuple instead. It is meant to be extendable at later time.
