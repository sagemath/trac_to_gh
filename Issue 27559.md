Is there a reason for this? Dollar signs should work just as well as backticks in docstrings, for triggering math mode.

Just for the sake of uniformity of documentation, no more serious reason. Most of the existing $ are remainders of the first few years of sage.

I think this is useful to do as people will look to random bits of doc, see this, and then argue that they can do it because it was done elsewhere.

The implication here is that dollar signs are bad; is that what you intend? Dollar signs are [explicitly allowed](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#latex-typesetting) according to our documentation, and people who are used to LaTeX will be comfortable using them. I see no reason to discourage their use.

My understanding is the dollar signs were (strongly) discouraged and the documentation used to reflect this. Although apparently that is not the case and/or has changed. We also (much) more uniformly have backticks throughout the codebase, so there is that too.

I've never had that understanding. Note that I wrote the original `process_dollars` function to make the transition to Sphinx easier, and that was about 10 years ago.

Anyway, I don't object to the change on this ticket, but I don't think it should be a routine thing. It's sort of like deciding that we don't want to use `a` as a variable name anywhere, and so going through changing every `a` to `b`.
