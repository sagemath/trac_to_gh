CC:  @etn40ff

This ticket is about changing the internal configure/install logic, not about changing behaviour.

"gcc" is a special Sage package because it's currently the only package which is either installed in Sage or used from the system if it's available.

In the future, we probably want more packages like this. It makes sense to mark all these packages as "standard" with some logic in `configure.ac` to skip the installation of certain standard packages.

I propose to define a *standard package* as a package which will always be available in Sage, either installed by Sage or taken from the system.

As for the actual patch, it looks good to me.

One thing that might be worth considering is rather than setting `$PKG_VAR = \$(INST)/.dummy` for skipped packages, still keep an explicit record of skipped packages in some `$(SKIPPED)/$PKG_VERSION`.  Or maybe better yet determine the version of the package that is being used from the system and write that to a file too.

But I'm not sure--for now it might be YAGNI. But one might also be able to imagine cases where it would be nice to have a record of what Sage *is* using for that package if not the one that was built as part of Sage.

The following sentence in the developer guide is not understood (by me) conforming to the definition of the standard package:

**standard** packages are built by default unless ``configure`` determines that they are not needed.

Shouldn't this be like this:

**standard** packages are built by default unless ``configure`` determines that they are available from the system.

or something close?

Good enough for positive_review?

I could make an argument for it. In particular for build dependencies it would be helpful for recording what packages everything was built with--as you say it's not necessarily useful information about what is currently running on the system.

But it would be easy enough to add later if a specific need arises.
