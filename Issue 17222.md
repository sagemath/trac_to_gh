# Issue 17222: Remove unused database modules

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2014-12-07 23:15:54

1. `src/sage/databases/install.py` is unused and only raises `NotImplementedError`.

2. `src/sage/databases/lincodes.py` mostly consists of commented-out code with a comment from William from 2007 "commented out, since it's broken".
