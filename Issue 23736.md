For a few weeks now (I haven't been able to pursue the issue much due to travel) I've had to take the Cygwin patchbot down due to an issue that didn't occur before where building the docs, particularly with multiple processes, hangs indefinitely.

I'm still trying to track down the commit where this issue began.  But in the meantime testing on Cygwin has been stunted due to this.  I hope to get to the bottom of it ASAP.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23973

Does this happen after a *failure* or during a *successful* build?

Hard to say, but now that I take a careful look at the doc build log I think there might be an unhandled failure of some sort. I just tried a new build from scratch and here's what I found:  The document `en/constructions`, that was edited in that commit, starts building (again, this is a parallel build so the log is interleaved):

It's not clear where "Insufficient memory for black list" is coming from but probably `en/constructions`.  After that there's no more output from that worker, but the remaining documents get built successfully, and then the build hangs.

So I guess this is a matter of poor error handling.  Reminds me I should finish my work to generalize `DocTestDispatcher.parallel_dispatch` :)

I take it back. Looking at the error message it gave it actually couldn't have been using gc 7.6.  In fact for some reason when I upgraded gc it did not replace the old DLL.

In particular, the default configuration for libgc on Cygwin is to use `sbrk` *only* for memory allocations.  \n  * It *just happened* that running the doc build in the manner I was running it deterministically (but otherwise arbitrarily) caused ``sbrk`` to bump into the fixed size limit of the private heap (at least I think--I have not directly confirmed this but it seems likely).  This was happening to me in the context of the doc build, but in principle this error could have come up in some other context.\n  * The obvious solution is to build libgc to use `mmap` (which generally works well on Cygwin) and not rely on `sbrk`.  Another workaround would be to manually increase the max heap size on the `ecl` executable (this can be done with the `peflags` utility) but that's only sweeping the problem under the rug somewhat.\n* libgc hard-codes a lot of the defaults for various settings depending on platform, such as `USE_MMAP` for whether or not it should use `mmap` for allocations (in fact, it seems on Linux this is not the default for some reason).  The only way to force this at configure time, it seems, is to (seemingly strangely) pass `--enable-munmap` to `configure`.\n  * However, on Cygwin this does *not* enable `USE_MMAP`.  It seems like maybe it used to, but now it also sets `USE_WINALLOC`, a setting whereby gc uses the Windows API directly for managing memory allocation.\n    * This has a surprising side-effect that it *forces* `--enable-handle-fork` to be disabled, as relying on direct handling of virtual memory allocations is inherently incompatible with Cygwin's fork emulation.  However, we *need* this setting in order for ecl to work at all in a multi-process environment where it might be forked (see #22694)\n    * Therefore we need to force `USE_MMAP` as well as `USE_MUNMAP` to be defined by manually passing them in via `CFLAGS`.  Other workarounds are possible of course but this is the simplest.\n* However there's a reason `USE_MMAP` was explicitly disabled on Cygwin.\n  * libgc's memory allocator uses algorithms that require it to be able to keep ranges of memory allocated but unusuable--in particular it remaps an existing `mmap` with the `PROT_NONE` flag to do this.  This runs afoul of the same problem we had in #22810, where Cygwin does not like this.\n  * This can be fixed on Cygwin by simply using `mprotect(..., PROT_NONE)` here, instead of `mmap`.  However, this alone is not sufficient and can lead quickly to failures because:\n    * The `mprotect` call must be aligned to the start of the `mmap`'d region, which libgc calculates using its `GC_page_size` global variable, which is initialized early on.  However, it currently calculates this incorrectly on Cygwin; rather it uses it incorrectly.  Although it does get the page size right, what it really needs is a value called the allocation granularity--the alignment for the start address of mmap'd regions.  On many systems this is equal to the page size but not on 64-bit windows where the page size is 4k but the allocation granularity is 64k.  Regions allocated by Cygwin's `mmap` are aligned to the latter.  The easiest workaround here is to just use the allocation granularity for `GC_page_size`.  There's not much sense in trying to use the actual page size anywhere in this case.\n----\nNew commits:",

Here's a full summary of the issue so far, and how the attached patch addresses it:

* Cygwin processes reserve an address space for Cygwin's "private heap" for the process--most POSIX system calls that manipulate the heap (e.g. `brk`, `sbrk`) are manipulating Cygwin's heap.
  * This private heap is of a fixed size and reserved at process startup--this allows it to be used freely without interference from Windows, which may be doing whatever it wants with the rest of the process's virtual address space.
  * Most of the time this is not a problem--while Cygwin's `malloc` does make small allocations to the heap, larger allocations are made with `mmap` and can be anywhere in the Windows process's VM space (not within the private heap).
  * However, a custom memory allocator (such as that used by libgc) may still run into problems here. In particular, the default configuration for libgc on Cygwin is to use `sbrk` *only* for memory allocations.  
  * It *just happened* that running the doc build in the manner I was running it deterministically (but otherwise arbitrarily) caused ``sbrk`` to bump into the fixed size limit of the private heap (at least I think--I have not directly confirmed this but it seems likely).  This was happening to me in the context of the doc build, but in principle this error could have come up in some other context.
  * The obvious solution is to build libgc to use `mmap` (which generally works well on Cygwin) and not rely on `sbrk`.  Another workaround would be to manually increase the max heap size on the `ecl` executable (this can be done with the `peflags` utility) but that's only sweeping the problem under the rug somewhat.
* libgc hard-codes a lot of the defaults for various settings depending on platform, such as `USE_MMAP` for whether or not it should use `mmap` for allocations (in fact, it seems on Linux this is not the default for some reason).  The only way to force this at configure time, it seems, is to (seemingly strangely) pass `--enable-munmap` to `configure`.
  * However, on Cygwin this does *not* enable `USE_MMAP`.  It seems like maybe it used to, but now it also sets `USE_WINALLOC`, a setting whereby gc uses the Windows API directly for managing memory allocation.
    * This has a surprising side-effect that it *forces* `--enable-handle-fork` to be disabled, as relying on direct handling of virtual memory allocations is inherently incompatible with Cygwin's fork emulation.  However, we *need* this setting in order for ecl to work at all in a multi-process environment where it might be forked (see #22694)
    * Therefore we need to force `USE_MMAP` as well as `USE_MUNMAP` to be defined by manually passing them in via `CFLAGS`.  Other workarounds are possible of course but this is the simplest.
* However there's a reason `USE_MMAP` was explicitly disabled on Cygwin.
  * libgc's memory allocator uses algorithms that require it to be able to keep ranges of memory allocated but unusuable--in particular it remaps an existing `mmap` with the `PROT_NONE` flag to do this.  This runs afoul of the same problem we had in #22810, where Cygwin does not like this.
  * This can be fixed on Cygwin by simply using `mprotect(..., PROT_NONE)` here, instead of `mmap`.  However, this alone is not sufficient and can lead quickly to failures because:
    * The `mprotect` call must be aligned to the start of the `mmap`'d region, which libgc calculates using its `GC_page_size` global variable, which is initialized early on.  However, it currently calculates this incorrectly on Cygwin; rather it uses it incorrectly.  Although it does get the page size right, what it really needs is a value called the allocation granularity--the alignment for the start address of mmap'd regions.  On many systems this is equal to the page size but not on 64-bit windows where the page size is 4k but the allocation granularity is 64k.  Regions allocated by Cygwin's `mmap` are aligned to the latter.  The easiest workaround here is to just use the allocation granularity for `GC_page_size`.  There's not much sense in trying to use the actual page size anywhere in this case.

Yeah that's just the macro they use internally for "cygwin".  The "32" part is a misnomer.

It doesn't matter--have a look at the source code for gc.  It defines its own macros for platform checks.  This is only consistent with their style.
