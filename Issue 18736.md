Similarly to the collection of transducers available in the `transducers` object, an `automata` object is created which may hold useful transducers.

As a first such transducer, implement a transducer recognizing one given word.

Looks fine. Added 3 reviewer-commits (two: docs, one: change state-labels to Sage-Integer (instead of Python-int)). Needs cross-review (but positive from my side).
