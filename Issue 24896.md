Darij, you will probably want more documentation (including references). Feel free to add. Otherwise this should be ready.

Ignore -- I accidentally pushed to the wrong branch. I push-forced the right one back now.

Thank you Darij and Travis for your hard work!

Some other bases that would be nice to code, if you guys have time - these are the sums of M's over some order on ordered set partitions, so maybe the only work is to code the orders:
- Q basis of Bergeron-Zabrocki (https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0509265 start of section 6);
- The fundamental and multiplicative bases from Novelli-Thibon (https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0605061 lines 55-56; section 2.6 and line 47).
- Their dual bases in the dual of WQSym.

Let me know if I can help. (But I'm in an antipodal timezone from you.)

Please open up follow-up tickets for each of these bases and feel free to work on them today. I/We can work on them tomorrow for us.

I opened #25151 and #25152. Maybe two will do for now? I looked at the current WQSym code and am not confident I can write anything useful... I'll try to make comments in those tickets. I'll be online for another 2 hours.
