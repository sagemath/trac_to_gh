# Issue 28773: Split off sage.rings.number_field.homset from sage.rings.number_field.morphism

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29010

Original creator: pbruin

Original creation time: 2020-01-14 14:15:23

The module `sage.rings.number_field.morphism` contains classes for homsets as well as homomorphisms.  It would be good to split off the homsets as a new module similar to `sage.rings.homset`.  One advantage is that this will make the patch for #28869 more readable.

LGTM except I think we should have a deprecation redirect (which you can do with a `lazy_import` IIRC).
