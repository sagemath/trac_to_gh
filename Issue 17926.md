The [documentation](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#documentation-strings) suggests to have one empty line between each `INPUT` argument, why are you removing those lines?

Also, why this extra line?

I wasn't aware of that, and I guess I tried to make things consistent locally or I used a badly thought out regex. Thanks for the comment!

The docstring of `vector_double_dense` begins with

```
Dense vectors using a NumPy backend. This serves as a base class for
```

which is not a 1-line description of the module.

General comment: forced pushes should be avoided while the ticket is being reviewed. Now I cannot easily see the differences with the previous version.

I thought that one was trivial enough, sorry.
