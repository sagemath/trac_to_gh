# Issue 31621: tranlation of univariate Gamma from fricas is broken

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31858

Original creator: mantepse

CC:  chapoton slelievre

Keywords: fricas

at least before #25597 we had

```
sage: fricas.Gamma(3/2).sage()
1/2*sqrt(pi)
```

but this is broken currently

The problem is that, in `src/sage/functions/gamma.py`, we have

```
        GinacFunction.__init__(self, 'gamma', latex_name=r"\Gamma",
                               ginac_name='gamma',
                               conversions={'mathematica':'Gamma',
                                            'maple':'GAMMA',
                                            'sympy':'gamma',
                                            'fricas':'Gamma',
                                            'giac':'Gamma'})
```

which attaches `fricas.Gamma` to the bivariate gamma function, not the symbolic function:

```
sage: lazy_import('sage.libs.pynac.pynac', ['symbol_table'])
sage: symbol_table["fricas"]["Gamma"].parent()
<class 'sage.functions.gamma.Function_gamma_inc'>
sage: gamma
<function gamma at 0x7ff1d6f2b940>
```
