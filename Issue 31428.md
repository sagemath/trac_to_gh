# Issue 31428: wrong comparison

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31665

Original creator: zimmerma

Original creation time: 2021-04-13 07:31:17

consider the following with Sage 9.1:

```
sage: t
log(17179815199/17179869184) + 727717503781781876485802752874818120860129694543334299450155913077668355/231584178474632390847141970017375815706539969331281128078915168015826259279872
sage: v
-53985/17179869184
sage: assert abs(t) < 1.213*2^-56*v^4
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AssertionError                            Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-43-e39fe5695680> in <module>()
----> 1 assert abs(t) < RealNumber('1.213')*Integer(2)**-Integer(56)*v**Integer(4)

AssertionError: 
sage: R=RealIntervalField(200)
sage: R(t)
1.55578750734428907680358094?e-39
sage: R(1.213*2^-56*v^4)
1.6413230032915689258596928268620690736175285393511912922960995?e-39
```

It seems the `assert` statement is evaluated in floating-point with insufficient precision to yield a correct result.

if we now get `true` with the patch from #31424 (I did not check however), this is ok for me

Replying to [comment:9 zimmerma]:

Yes, and it's included as a doctest there too.
