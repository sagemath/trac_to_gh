The new patch includes (folded) Nicolas' review patch, which makes CrystalOfTableaux a class again.

Please disregard the update pickle_jar as the new revised patch does not seem to break any old pickles.

Ah cool. That's a nice side effect.

This patch substantially improves the support for classical and affine crystal in sage. For classical crystals, it makes it easier to construct crystals of half integral weight in types B and D. For affine crystals, it largely completes the support for Kirillov-Reshetikhin crystals by adding the previously unimplemented cases. This is an important enhancement.

This patch must be merged simultaneously with #10485 and after #10723. If all three patches are merged, all doctests pass with sage-4.7.alpha1. The patches have been extensively reviewed in sage-combinat-devel and appropriately revised.

In the doctests, you should specify why a test is "#optional".  You should write "# optional - <packagename>" instead.

Some of the added tests take a *very* long time (more than 1 minute).  Can you justify that it is really important that they are included?

Also, there are some "# long time" tests which in reality take less than 1 second on `sage.math.washington.edu`, so there is no reason for the "# long time".

Could you please specify for which of the tests I can remove # long time and for which
they should be added? When I run the tests on my machine without longtest, there are non that take more than 1 minute.

Thank you,

Anne

The tests on lines 197 and 199 of `sage/combinat/crystals/kirillov_reshetikhin.py` take more than a minute.  Preferably these tests should be changed, or there should be a justification of why they are really needed.  If none of this can be done, just remove those tests.

The raised issues about the specification of optional packages and long tests have been addressed in the revised patch. I set the flag again to positive review.

The syntax for specifying optional packages is

```
# optional - pkg1 pkg2
```

no "requires" or "and" should be there.
See 
[http://sagemath.org/doc/developer/conventions.html#documentation-strings](http://sagemath.org/doc/developer/conventions.html#documentation-strings)

Also, there are still various places where there is simply an "#optional" without specification.
