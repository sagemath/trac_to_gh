# Issue 30185: Failure in Deep-copying Matrices Over Certain Laurent-Series-Rings

Deep-copying matrices over laurent-series-rings whose base-rings are GF(p<sup>n</sup>) with large enough values of p,n, seem to fail for most matrices.


```
sage: import copy
sage: K = GF(41^3)
sage: S.<s> = LaurentSeriesRing(K)
sage: A = matrix(S, [(5*K.gen()^2 + 8*K.gen() + 31)*s])
sage: A
[(5*z3^2 + 8*z3 + 31)*s]
sage: C = copy.deepcopy(A) 			# succeeds
sage: A = matrix(S, [(5*K.gen()^2 + 8*K.gen() + 31)*s + s^2])
sage: A
[(5*z3^2 + 8*z3 + 31)*s + s^2]
sage: C = copy.deepcopy(A) 			# fails
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
...
TypeError: unable to convert PARI t_SER to finite field element
```

Moving this ticket to 9.4, as it seems unlikely that it will be merged in 9.3, which is in the release candidate stage
