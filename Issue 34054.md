# Issue 34054: Downgrade some optional packages to experimental

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/34291

Original creator: jhpalmieri

Original creation time: 2022-08-06 18:10:20

The following don't currently build on various platforms â€” see https://github.com/sagemath/sage/actions/runs/2777704587:
- `symengine_py` #34141
- `p_group_cohomology` #30787
- `r_jupyter`
The following don't build for me on OS X 12.5:
- `polylib` #33758
- `rubiks`
I propose downgrading at least the first batch, maybe all, from optional to experimental.

rubiks is fixed in #34293

I agree that `polylib` can be downgraded to experimental. Then also `barvinok` should be downgraded because it depends on `polylib`.
