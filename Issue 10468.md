When uploading a zip file of worksheets to the notebook, if multiple  worksheets have the same name, only one of the worksheets is extracted (multiple times).  This is because the zip extraction code iterates through the file *names* instead of zipinfo file *objects* in the zip file.  The attached patch takes care of this, and fixes uploads of zip files containing multiple worksheets having the same name.

This bit me several times today.

Can somebody upload a zip file somewhere so that we can more easily understand the problem and review this ticket.

For example, this is what I did while working on [this issue](http://code.google.com/p/sagenb/issues/detail?id=33) of the new Sage flask Notebook.

Note that the file `twist.py` is deprecated in the the Flask Notebook. Hence, this patch will have to be re-based again. I am ready to do it since I worked in the exact same line while fixing the above issue. But a zip file would be appreciated. For example, I don't understand how two files can have the same name if they are in the same directory (I believe it is True, but I need an example to understand).

I don't know anything about the new notebook, but here are the steps to reproduce the problem on the (unpatched) "old" notebook:

1. Create two worksheets with different contents but give them the same name.
2. Download all active worksheets via the link.
3. (optional) Delete the worksheets from the server -- just to prevent confusion.
4. Upload the zip file created in step 2.
5. Examine the two worksheets created: they are duplicates of only one worksheet from the zip file. The other worksheet was never extracted.

attachment:download_worksheets.2.zip is a zip file of the kind that ltw described. I created two worksheets with the same name but with different contents (either "This is the first worksheet" or "This is the second worksheet").

I made a mistake with attachment:download_worksheets.zip that is perhaps instructive: I opened the zipfile produced by the notebook (version 4.7) in Ubuntu's Archive Manager, and when I use "Save As" to save it to a file, I get the zip file you see in attachment:download_worksheets.zip.
