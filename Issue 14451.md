Keywords: dynkin diagram copy

Initializing:

```
sage: d = DynkinDiagram(['B',3,1])
sage: g = DiGraph()
sage: for x in d.vertices(): g.add_vertex(x)
sage: for y in d.edges(): g.add_edge(y)
sage: cd = copy(d)
sage: cg = copy(g)
sage: cd is d
False
sage: cd == d and cg == g
True
```

Now the correct behavior using `DiGraph`:

```
sage: g.vertices()
[0, 1, 2, 3]
sage: cg.vertices()
[0, 1, 2, 3]
sage: cg.add_vertex(4)
sage: g.vertices()
[0, 1, 2, 3]
sage: cg.vertices()
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
```

The error with `DynkinDiagram`:

```
sage: d.vertices()
[0, 1, 2, 3]
sage: cd.vertices()
[0, 1, 2, 3]
sage: cd.add_vertex(4)       
sage: cd.vertices()
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
sage: d.vertices()
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
```


This causes problems with `automorphism_group(edge_labels=True)` noticed by Mark Shimozono.

Thanks, Travis, for fixing this. A few small things to deal with:

Please fix the docstring for :func:`DynkinDiagram`: the real issue for the Cartan matrix convention
is transposing or not; in everyone's conventions the arrow points from a *longer* root to a *shorter* one.

I ran the following tests and got some errors.


```
sage: d = DynkinDiagram(['A',3,1])
sage: TestSuite(d).run()
Failure in _test_not_implemented_methods:
Traceback (click to the left of this block for traceback)
...
The following tests failed: _test_not_implemented_methods
```


I'm not sure I understand why, but :class:`DynkinDiagram_class` inherits from
:class:`CartanType_abstract` and therefore is obligated to supply its abstract methods.
It appears not to fulfill its promise for :meth:`is_finite`, :meth:`is_affine`, and :meth:`is_irreducible`.

Otherwise it looks great!
