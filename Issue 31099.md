https://gitlab.com/embeddable-common-lisp/ecl/-/merge_requests/231 
has been merged in 21.2.1, see
https://gitlab.com/embeddable-common-lisp/ecl/-/commit/cd2f19fedbd4fed9f1e8fb8122bb9ee1e08541bf

(so `ecl-configure-include-stdlib-h.patch` should be removed too)

https://gitlab.com/embeddable-common-lisp/ecl/-/merge_requests/210 was merged too, so
`skip_makeinfo_test.patch` should be dropped too

The tests look fine (also builds OK on `cygwin-standard`).
