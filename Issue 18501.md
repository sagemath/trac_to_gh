All the `.pxd` files etc installed since #18494 are considered "stale" by `sage_setup/clean.py` and are deleted.

Work around this by white-listing the extensions `'.c', '.cpp', '.h', '.pxi', '.pxd'`

Yes I should have done something better in `clean.py`. Are you sure about `sage: skip_extensions = (loadable_module_extension(),)` in particular that comma, or where you going to put something else afterwards and forgot?

It's a one-element tuple, which is also in other places in that file. So yes, it's intentional.
