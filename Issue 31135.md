I would prefer to comment out the line, with the idea to put it back when/if this is fixed

I removed them because they are optional packages, and I don't think the docker image should install them by default.  If these packages should be present in every installation, someone should make the case for them to be standard packages -- which will ensure that they are actually tested.

Some pointers as we stop shipping the GAP, PARI
and Singular Jupyter kernels in our Docker image.

The repo for the GAP Jupyter kernel is at:
