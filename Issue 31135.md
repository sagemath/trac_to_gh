I removed them because they are optional packages, and I don't think the docker image should install them by default.  If these packages should be present in every installation, someone should make the case for them to be standard packages -- which will ensure that they are actually tested.

Some pointers as we stop shipping the GAP, PARI
and Singular Jupyter kernels in our Docker image.

The repo for the GAP Jupyter kernel is at:

- https://github.com/gap-packages/JupyterKernel

To try GAP with Jupyter online, see:

- https://github.com/gap-system/try-gap-in-jupyter

The repo for the PARI Jupyter kernel is at:

- - https://github.com/jdemeyer/pari_jupyter

Solving the issue that broke things here is tracked at:

- https://github.com/jdemeyer/pari_jupyter/issues/9

See also "Run PARI/GP in your browser" including WebAssembly version:

The repo for the Singular Jupyter kernel is at:
