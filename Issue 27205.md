# Issue 27205: Implement option for factoring differentials out of Weyl algebras

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27442

Original creator: tscrim

Original creation time: 2019-03-08 04:43:52

CC:  chapoton

Keywords: Weyl algebra

It is natural to write the elements of the (differential) Weyl algebra with the differentials factored out (on the right). This is a common expression for the elements in the single variable case.

I would appreciate a review here (bot is morally green), but I will understand if you do not want to as this is not a trivial ticket.

A couple of small remarks:
1. `for e,g in`: Not sure if PEP8 would say `for e, g in` (space after comma) here. (found three times)
2. `[True,False]` (very last line of patch): here PEP8 for sure
2. Also `R.<x,y,z>`, `x,y,z,dx,dy,dz`, `t,dt` should IMO been written with space after comma.
3. `factor_differentials` is not doctested.
4. `(8*t^3 + 18*t)dt^1` (discussion): Should there be a `*` before the `dt`? (In some sense, this would be closer to a representation that one could feed back into the system and let it evaluate (i.e. correct Python syntax). However, I am aware that this might not be a major usecase (if at all).
5. Latex `d^{3}_{t}`: I simply do not know if this is the standard convention to write to typeset it; I simply believe you here and just wanted it noted.

Otherwise, LGTM.

PEP8 allows you to remove the space for operators when inside of a lower precedence operator. So IMO the no space is fine (and can be more readable). However, I don't care so strongly and have changed it.

> 2. `[True,False]` (very last line of patch): here PEP8 for sure

See above.

> 2. Also `R.<x,y,z>`, `x,y,z,dx,dy,dz`, `t,dt` should IMO been written with space after comma.

IMO, the `R.<x,y,z>` looks better and is easier to read (and fits PEP8 in the sense given above). However, I agree that there can be spacing for the list of generators, so I have changed those.

> 3. `factor_differentials` is not doctested.

Whoops, thanks. Fixed.

> 4. `(8*t^3 + 18*t)dt^1` (discussion): Should there be a `*` before the `dt`? (In some sense, this would be closer to a representation that one could feed back into the system and let it evaluate (i.e. correct Python syntax). However, I am aware that this might not be a major usecase (if at all).

That is a good point. I have added that.

> 5. Latex `d^{3}_{t}`: I simply do not know if this is the standard convention to write to typeset it; I simply believe you here and just wanted it noted.

It was a good thing to note. In PDEs, people use d<sub>t</sub> for the derivative wrt t. However, in this case, I used the del/`\partial` notation, so I changed it to be consistent with that.

I see. I know of this rule, but never interpreted it for skipping space after a comma. If I would have known that, I might would have reviewed differently. Anyways, thanks for changing; I think that in many parts of [SageMath](SageMath), there are spaces after commas.

Ok, thank you for the explanation.

So, for me this everything looks fine. Once the patchbot is happy, this is a positive review.

Thanks. PEP8 allows for some flexibility and interpretation. Bottom line is being consistent and what looks "good".

So the patchbot is essentially happy modulo one bad doctest (I swore I tested the file before pushing...), which I will fix when I get to my desktop tomorrow morning (I am based in Australia).

I fixed that one doctest and did a force push since it was a trivial change. With that, I now get the file passing all tests:

```
Using --optional=4ti2,coxeter3,dochtml,dot2tex,gambit,latte_int,lidia,lrslib,meataxe,memlimit,mpir,normaliz,p_group_cohomology,pynormaliz,python2,sage,sirocco
Doctesting 1 file using 8 threads.
sage -t --long weyl_algebra.py
    [196 tests, 0.16 s]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Total time for all tests: 0.2 seconds
    cpu time: 0.2 seconds
    cumulative wall time: 0.2 seconds
```

This with the previous green bot, I am allowing myself to set a positive review. If you disagree Daniel (and want to wait for another patchbot), just set it back to needs review.

Thank you for the review.

Fine for me, thank you.

You're welcome.
