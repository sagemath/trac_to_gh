This is the lowest-hanging fruit in addressing the issues I raised in [this comment](http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20218#comment:16).

It changes `sage-uncompress-spkg` to apply mode 700 to all directories extracted from tarballs.  Original permissions are preserved for plain files.  Are there any odd packages this would cause an issue for?

This doesn't apply to zipfiles since they do not contain permission information, though in principle we could modify zipfiles to use the same policy wrt directories. I don't think it matters much though.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20481

Instead of ignoring permissions for dirs, would it be possible to simply apply the user's umask on everything which gets extracted (files and directories). This would mean changing `tarinfo.mode` to `tarinfo.mode & CURRENT_UMASK`.

Perhaps one reason *not* to prefer that is that if the umask is set to something useless then then applying it would be no less "safe".  As it is this is only "unsafe" in the context of moving the extracted directory to someplace like /tmp.  But it seems more reliable not to rely on the user's umask.

I would say that the `umask` *defines* what is safe. It is the thing which determines which permissions the user wants.
