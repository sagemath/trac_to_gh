Looking at my log file (to be attached shortly), it doesn't seem like the patch was attempted to be installed on my Cygwin32.

According to your log the patch is applying but you're having some other, possibly unrelated problem.

Ah, yes, it is applying and I missed it in the log. The errors are from these lines:

```
In file included from src/SHA256.c:35:0:
src/hash_SHA2.h:91:9: error: unknown type name 'U32'
typedef U32 sha2_word_t;
         ^
In file included from src/SHA256.c:72:0:
src/hash_SHA2_template.c:175:38: error: unknown type name 'U8'
hash_update (hash_state *self, const U8 *buf, int len)
                                      ^
In file included from src/hash_SHA2_template.c:199:0,
                 from src/SHA256.c:72:
```

Should we try and fix this problem here on this ticket as well?

I'd rather not, if anything just because I don't know what the issue is here and it probably isn't related.  I'm also not spending any time on Cygwin32.  *Unless* of course this is actually _caused_ by the patch in this ticket and is fixed by removing it.

Changing status from needs_review to positive_review.

It definitely is not caused by the patch since this failed for me without the patch.
