I also modified the graph doctest which calls the polytope. Good to go?

Looks good. 

These 16 sec to build the graph from polytope highlight the need to have a method to do so directly, without constructing all faces. In fact, it can be done by just calling an LP solver the number of times equal to the number of pairs of vertices...

I did that in #18860, but... Well, the function does not work `:-P`

Actually, it works to build this polyhedron, but I hard-coded a constant '26'. If you can figure out what should appear instead of 26, then we will proably have a huge speedup for this .graph function `:-P`
