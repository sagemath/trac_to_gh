Has anybody checked that the problem is really with the doctests? i.e. do `make distclean`, install `database_gap`, do the tests fail?

packages in # optional should be separated by spaces - commas don't work (tested :-))

Replying to [comment:9 dimpase]:
> commas don't work
You can use commas for things like

```
# optional - database_gap, long time, random
```
