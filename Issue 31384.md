# Issue 31384: ubuntu-groovy-standard: numerics-related sage testsuite errors

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31621

Original creator: mkoeppe

CC:  dimpase jhpalmieri vdelecroix @kliem

From https://groups.google.com/g/sage-release/c/6WjKQt_e_B8/m/dpx1qILOCwAJ (for 9.3.rc2):

9.3.beta8> {debian-bullseye,ubuntu-groovy}-standard: cvxopt testsuite errors, numerics-related sage testsuite errors
9.3.beta8> (is system BLAS feeling OK??)

The numerics failures on debian-bullseye have disappeared (or perhaps it is processor dependent, and we were luckier in this run), but show up in debian-sid this time. 
The numerics failures on ubuntu-groovy are still present.

Moving to 9.4, as 9.3 has been released.

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2021-09-22 21:39:22

I saw what I think are the same failures on one OS X 11.5.2 machine (but not another one — I think it's CPU dependent). The failing machine says

```
% sysctl -n machdep.cpu.brand_string
Intel(R) Xeon(R) W-2140B CPU @ 3.20GHz
```

I can provide other CPU info if you let me know what commands to run.

The tests passed when I did `tox -e local-homebrew-macos-minimal -- ptestlong`. Any guesses for what homebrew package is causing the problem? What should I plug into `./configure --with-system-PKG=no`?


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2021-09-24 21:57:26

These tests passed when I did `./configure --with-system-gsl=no --with-system-openblas=no`. 

Just using `./configure --with-system-gsl=no` failed to build: gsl's configure script failed with

```
configure: error: in `/Users/jpalmier/Desktop/Sage/sage_builds/TESTING/sage-9.5.beta1/local/var/tmp/sage/build/gsl-2.6/src':
configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables
```

and gsl's config.log file said

```
ld: library not found for -lopenblas
```


I'm trying now with `./configure --with-system-openblas=no`, which means that Sage will also build its own `gsl`, `r`, and `suitesparse`.

(This computer is in my work office, and so I will not check its progress again until Monday.)


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2021-09-24 22:06:05

By the way, I expect this to pass these tests — it should be equivalent to what I already did with `./configure --with-system-gsl=no --with-system-openblas=no` — but I want to see the output of `make ptestlong`.


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2021-09-27 18:56:16

All tests passed when using that flag (`--with-system-openblas=no`).

John, do you see on macOS the error reported by Vincent?

```
File "src/sage/matrix/matrix_double_dense.pyx", line 1365, in
sage.matrix.matrix_double_dense.Matrix_double_dense.?
Failed example:
     A.eigenvalues(algorithm='symmetric', tol=1.0e-5)  # tol 2e-15
Expected:
     [(-8.0, 22), (2.0, 77), (22.0, 1)]
Got:
     [(-13.81753974166025, 1),
...
```


- it's one I know how to produce a standalone test for (as a short Fortran program linking OpenBLAS)


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2021-10-16 22:56:56

also, what openblas version did you try on homebrew?
the bumped to 0.3.18 two weeks ago: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/commit/63de340b1e397b67e7137519f45b02491b6e1f15

Dima, even a standalone test with scipy would be already good enough. I would like to check if the Debian package is completely broken or simply used wrongly within sage. In both cases, it might be known from Debian developers.

Attachment

I've uploaded an attempted test of OpenBLAS. Download the attachments and

```
gfortran dev_test.f90 -lopenblas
./a.out <HigmanSims.tst
```


The last line of the output should say `max. deviation of eigenvals: <small number>`, where `<small number>` is smaller than 10<sup>-13</sup> or so if all is good.
 
(there is another, smaller, example, too, petersen.tst)


Please note I'm not sure I used exactly the same LAPACK function as in Sage failing test - there is one more function to try, `DSYEVR` if this one, `DSYEV`, would just work.

Yes, I see this failure. This is with an un-updated version of OpenBLAS: 0.3.17 from 2021-09-23 according to `brew info openblas`. I will try upgrading.

I can't use the standalone test because I get `ld: library not found for -lopenblas`.

You'd need `-L` flag:

```
gfortran <...>.f90 -L/usr/local/opt/openblas/lib -lopenblas
```

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2021-10-18 18:57:22

Thanks. When I run `./a.out <HigmanSims.tst`, the last line is the same with either test program: `max. deviation of eigenvals:    1.2878587085651816E-014`.


---

With `petersen.tst` I get `max. deviation of eigenvals:    8.8817841970012523E-016`.

Which Fortran program do you compile? Please try  `dev_test_dsyevr.f90` if you did not.

I tried both (that's what I meant by "either test program").


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2021-10-18 19:32:02

ok, so the next step would be to try the "normal" scipy run. That is, you can print `a` to a file, and then start `./sage --python`, read `a` in, and then run all the other lines in comment:17.


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2021-10-18 19:38:03

and if the latter still returns incorrect results, I'd try a standalone scipy, built from source using openblas from homebrew.

one quick way to do this is the following:

```
sage: import numpy as np
sage: g=graphs.HigmanSimsGraph()
sage: a=np.matrix(g.adjacency_matrix())
sage: np.save('/tmp/x',a)
```

now we have `a` in `/tmp/x.npy`. So start 

```
./sage --python
}}} 
and at its `>>>` prompt do
{{{
import numpy as np
a=np.load('/tmp/x.npy')
import scipy
import scipy.linalg
eig=scipy.linalg.lapack.dsyevr(a); eig[0]
}}}


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2021-10-18 20:03:14

Needless to say, it's a good idea to check that `/tmp/x.npy` is correct, so copying it on a machine where Sage is not broken and testing it as above might be good idea.

This gives correct results (although I wrote the matrix `g.adjacency_matrix()` to a file and then read it back in and fed it into `np.matrix(...)`).


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2021-10-18 20:19:55

So it's not OpenBLAS or SciPy themselves, right?
Something else in Sage upsets OpenBLAS (and only OpenBLAS from numpy, right?) on this particular CPU.


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2021-10-18 21:14:43

For what it's worth, I dumped `a` to a file using `np.save(FILE, a)`. Then I loaded it and ran the above list of commands.

- works just fine with `./sage --python`
- produces the wrong answer with `./sage`


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2021-10-18 21:21:04

And naturally it works fine if I use a version of Sage built with `./configure --with-system-openblas=no`.


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2021-10-18 21:22:49

Could `gsl` be involved somehow, rather than `openblas`?


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2021-10-18 21:47:28

It need not be something even dependent on openblas that creates this weird CPU state. It could be something using AVX-512, or OpenMP.

Unfortunately Sage isn't modularised enough so that one could just load parts one by one, and check if the bug appears.


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2021-10-18 22:17:13

I built Sage with

```
export CFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/openblas/lib"
./configure --with-system-gsl=no
```

and I am not seeing the errors. This is using homebrew's `openblas`.


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2021-10-18 22:40:27

Interesting. First, it's a bug either in spkg-install of GSL, as it demands that `cblas` is known to `pkg-config`, which is not the case here - it can get the same from `openblas`, or somewhere in our hacky procedure of creating .pc files from the one for `openblas`.

Second, Sage is still on GSL 2.6, but Homebrew is on GSL 2.7.
There is #32607 - which supposed to be fixing something GSL 2.7-related (but I am happily running GSL 2.7 on Linux with Sage...)

Matthias has tickets to make GSL optional.


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2021-10-18 22:46:33

Regarding the 1st issue: if you fire up `./sage --buildsh`, and at its prompt, run
`pkg-config --libs cblas`, what's the output?

I suspect that 

```
sdh_configure LIBS="`pkg-config --libs-only-l cblas` -lm"
```

in GSL's spkg-install.in should be

```
sdh_configure LIBS="`pkg-config --libs cblas` -lm"
```


(`--libs-only-l` doesn't print `-L` flags.)

Can you try the latter line without `CFLAGS` ?


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2021-10-18 22:51:15

Should `pkgconf` be a dependency for `gsl`?

Will do.

Comment by dimpase created at 2021-10-19 07:35:26

As noted in #32587, GSL 2.7 may be built with an option to use old API. This does not happen on Homebrew, see https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/HEAD/Formula/gsl.rb

However, on Debian Bullseye GSL is still version 2.6, so perhaps
it's not the version alone that's reponsible.
https://packages.debian.org/source/stable/gsl

----

Vincent, could you check the GSL version you're using, and build Sage with system OpenBLAS, but
without GSL, just as John did here?

Perhaps one should leave that LIBS settings alone, and add LDFLAGS (it's weird that CFLAGS worked for you!) as follows:


```
sdh_configure LIBS="`pkg-config --libs-only-l cblas` -lm" LDFLAGS="$LDFLAGS `pkg-config --libs-only-L cblas`"
```

`gsl` builds but the `sagelib` package fails to build this way: `ld: library not found for -lopenblas`.

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2021-10-19 18:59:49

I'm really confused now.

- With the changes you suggested in comment:42 and comment:44 (set LDFLAGS and modify `.homebrew-build-env`), Sage builds, but the example in comment:17 fails and I see the numerical failures in doctesting.
- If instead I build Sage as in comment:36 (exporting `CFLAGS`), then Sage builds (although with warnings "clang: warning: argument unused during compilation: '-L/usr/local/opt/openblas/lib' [-Wunused-command-line-argument]") and the example in comment:17 works. `./sage -tp --long src/sage/matrix` succeeds: no numerical failures.


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2021-10-19 20:15:51

probably "success" with gsl comes from it not using openblas at all. You can check by running `otool -L `

`% otool -L local/lib/libgsl.25.dylib` returns the same thing in each of the two cases (edited to replace the actual path with `$SAGE_ROOT`):

```
% otool -L local/lib/libgsl.25.dylib 
local/lib/libgsl.25.dylib:
	$SAGE_ROOT/local/lib/libgsl.25.dylib (compatibility version 26.0.0, current version 26.0.0)
	/usr/local/opt/openblas/lib/libopenblas.0.dylib (compatibility version 0.0.0, current version 0.0.0)
	/usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1292.100.5)
```

Same with `otool -L local/lib/libgslcblas.0.dylib`.

I can only say that exporting `-L` flag in CFLAGS makes little sense to me.
I'd like to see GSLs config.log when it's set, and when it's not (as in comment:6 are you sure your CFLAGS didn't contain something wrong then?).

```
% echo $CFLAGS
-L/usr/local/opt/openblas/lib
```

But this causes other changes in the Sage build: when I set `CFLAGS` manually, then Sage does not add `-O2 -g -march=native`. Maybe one of those flags makes a difference. I'll try to test it out.

I guess it's `-march=native` to blame for this. Overwriting `CFLAGS` to exclude it for `gsl` makes a difference (see  #27122), and we saw this a number of times lately in regard of `openblas`. Not all Xeon CPUs are created equal. :/

After a `make openblas` sage fails to start with

```
~/sage/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/sage/matrix/matrix_space.py in <module>
     42 
---> 43 from . import matrix_modn_sparse
        global matrix_modn_sparse = undefined
     44

ImportError: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libblas.so.3: undefined symbol: gotoblas
```

I thought that this would have solved my problem but instead created another one.

have you rebuilt sagelib?

```
make sagelib-clean && make build
```

Separately from the other issues, should we change gsl's `spkg-install.in` to use

```
sdh_configure LIBS="`pkg-config --libs-only-l cblas` -lm" LDFLAGS="$LDFLAGS `pkg-config --libs-only-L cblas`"
```

as suggested in comment:42? And should `pkgconf` be a dependency for `gsl`, to make sure `pkg-config` is available for this command?

yes

yes (an order-only dependency, just like for `r`).

By the way, if I build all of Sage with `export CFLAGS='-O2 -g'`, just with a plain `./configure` so using all of homebrew's packages, tests pass. So allowing  `-march=native` to remain (by not explicitly setting `CFLAGS`) on this machine causes problems in building parts of Sage.

Shouldn't `CPPFLAGS` also be set using pkgconfig?


---

(in the branch of #32587)

It builds without that, but please modify that branch if you think it's a good idea.

Changing priority from critical to blocker.

Still the same in 9.5.beta6

What's the status here?

Changing priority from blocker to major.

We can no longer test `ubuntu-groovy`, and the failures do not show up in any other Debian and Ubuntu variants tested in https://github.com/sagemath/sage/actions/runs/1673712139 (for 9.5.rc0). 

So perhaps we can close it?

Seen again in 9.7.rc0 on `debian-bullseye-standard`
