From https://groups.google.com/g/sage-release/c/6WjKQt_e_B8/m/dpx1qILOCwAJ (for 9.3.rc2):

9.3.beta8> {debian-bullseye,ubuntu-groovy}-standard: cvxopt testsuite errors, numerics-related sage testsuite errors
9.3.beta8> (is system BLAS feeling OK??)

The numerics failures on debian-bullseye have disappeared (or perhaps it is processor dependent, and we were luckier in this run), but show up in debian-sid this time. 
The numerics failures on ubuntu-groovy are still present.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31621

These tests passed when I did `./configure --with-system-gsl=no --with-system-openblas=no`. 

Just using `./configure --with-system-gsl=no` failed to build: gsl's configure script failed with

```
configure: error: in `/Users/jpalmier/Desktop/Sage/sage_builds/TESTING/sage-9.5.beta1/local/var/tmp/sage/build/gsl-2.6/src':

```

and gsl's config.log file said

```
ld: library not found for -lopenblas
```


I'm trying now with `./configure --with-system-openblas=no`, which means that Sage will also build its own `gsl`, `r`, and `suitesparse`.

(This computer is in my work office, and so I will not check its progress again until Monday.)

Dima, even a standalone test with scipy would be already good enough. I would like to check if the Debian package is completely broken or simply used wrongly within sage. In both cases, it might be known from Debian developers.

I've uploaded an attempted test of OpenBLAS. Download the attachments and

```
gfortran dev_test.f90 -lopenblas
./a.out <HigmanSims.tst
```


The last line of the output should say `max. deviation of eigenvals: <small number>`, where `<small number>` is smaller than 10<sup>-13</sup> or so if all is good.
 
(there is another, smaller, example, too, petersen.tst)


Please note I'm not sure I used exactly the same LAPACK function as in Sage failing test - there is one more function to try, `DSYEVR` if this one, `DSYEV`, would just work.

one quick way to do this is the following:

```
sage: import numpy as np
sage: g=graphs.HigmanSimsGraph()
sage: a=np.matrix(g.adjacency_matrix())
sage: np.save('/tmp/x',a)
```

now we have `a` in `/tmp/x.npy`. So start 

```
./sage --python
```
 
and at its `>>>` prompt do

```
import numpy as np
a=np.load('/tmp/x.npy')
import scipy
import scipy.linalg
eig=scipy.linalg.lapack.dsyevr(a); eig[0]
```

```

So it's not OpenBLAS or SciPy themselves, right?
Something else in Sage upsets OpenBLAS (and only OpenBLAS from numpy, right?) on this particular CPU.

For what it's worth, I dumped `a` to a file using `np.save(FILE, a)`. Then I loaded it and ran the above list of commands.

- works just fine with `./sage --python`
- produces the wrong answer with `./sage`

It need not be something even dependent on openblas that creates this weird CPU state. It could be something using AVX-512, or OpenMP.

Interesting. First, it's a bug either in spkg-install of GSL, as it demands that `cblas` is known to `pkg-config`, which is not the case here - it can get the same from `openblas`, or somewhere in our hacky procedure of creating .pc files from the one for `openblas`.

Second, Sage is still on GSL 2.6, but Homebrew is on GSL 2.7.
There is #32607 - which supposed to be fixing something GSL 2.7-related (but I am happily running GSL 2.7 on Linux with Sage...)

Matthias has tickets to make GSL optional.

Regarding the 1st issue: if you fire up `./sage --buildsh`, and at its prompt, run

I suspect that 

```
sdh_configure LIBS="`pkg-config --libs-only-l cblas` -lm"
```

in GSL's spkg-install.in should be

```
sdh_configure LIBS="`pkg-config --libs cblas` -lm"

(`--libs-only-l` doesn't print `-L` flags.)

Can you try the latter line without `CFLAGS` ?

Perhaps one should leave that LIBS settings alone, and add LDFLAGS (it's weird that CFLAGS worked for you!) as follows:


```
sdh_configure LIBS="`pkg-config --libs-only-l cblas` -lm" LDFLAGS="$LDFLAGS `pkg-config --libs-only-L cblas`"
```
