The `N[]` function from mathematica is being overwritten by `numerical_approx`.  There seems to be no other way to call `N[]` on an existing mathematica object, so this is a problem.

One way to solve this would be to make mathematica functions take precedence over all or most Sage methods.  To call a Sage method one would/should/could use `.sage().whichever_method()`
