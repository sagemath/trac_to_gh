I'm not sure what is causing this difference. Apparently [debian has the same problem](https://salsa.debian.org/science-team/sagemath/blob/e063adfe71044302f7777bd1d4794f6b8ca31c8d/debian/patches/u2-fix-trivial-test-cases.patch#L47).

This patch makes the doctests accept both formats.

It seems like this patch was only included to fix this formatting error (#20599). This is a bit meta, but is there a general patching policy for sage?

Sage patches a lot of its dependencies and often has very good reasons to do so. But sometimes it is not strictly necessary. That makes life hard for packagers and also for the people maintaining the sage spkgs. In my opinion patching dependencies should be a last resort, only if there is pretty much no other option.

There is no such policy. But it might be a good topic for discussion on `sage-packaging` (do you know about that mailing list?)

Your patch looks good to me. I think a ` # see #25320 for the apparently unnecessary ...` or something similar would be nice to make sure that nobody takes this out on the next refactoring.

Okay I could reproduce the error locally. No idea why I didn't notice that before, I must have messed up somewhere.

Apparently python will interpret those `...` at the beginning as line-continuation characters[1]. I've updated the patch with a solution for this, but its not very pretty: Print a leading dummy line.

In my opinion the best solution would be to just remove the backports patch in sage. One patch less is one problem less and this patch seems to bring little to none advantage. But judging by the mailing list discussion, `@`jdemeyer probably disagrees?

Why? It's not the fault of Sage that upstream doesn't make a new release (EDIT: actually, that upstream is dead). One could also argue that your distro should just apply that patch to `backports.shutil_get_terminal_size` since it fixes an actual bug.

I know. I think it's because of the "coverage" policy that every function should have tests. If people cannot come up with good tests, they just copy an existing test to satisfy the `sage-coverage` tool. It's a good example of a well-intentioned tool having unintended side effects.

I agree, that'll improve the test (doctests with textual output are inherently brittle) and solve half of this problem.

What about the other one? Could we maybe replace that with another exception that is well-behaved, regardless of the backport patch level?

I skimmed through the source and the patch to get an idea, but I can't figure out how the backport even influences the ZeroDivisionError formatting, let alone how the `master.patch` fixes it.
