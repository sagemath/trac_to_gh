# Issue 20193: Bug in RSK_inverse()

I am using sage 6.8 and got the following result


```
sage: t = [[1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3], [3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5], [4], [5]]
sage: s = SemistandardTableau(t)
sage: RSK_inverse( s, s, 'matrix' )
[0 0 2 2 0]
[0 0 0 1 3]
[2 0 0 1 1]
[2 2 0 0 0]
[0 2 2 0 0]
```


This can't be correct as the result must be a symmetric matrix.

I found a few slightly smaller examples, where `RSK_inverse` returns wrong results::

```
[[[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2], [2], [3]],
 [[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3], [2], [3]],
 [[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2], [2], [3]],
 [[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3], [2], [3]],
 [[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2], [2], [3]],
 [[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3], [2], [3]],
 [[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3], [2], [3]],
 [[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2], [2, 2], [3]],
 [[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3], [2, 3], [3]],
 [[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2], [2, 2], [3]],
 [[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2], [2, 3], [3]],
 [[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3], [2, 3], [3]],
 [[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2], [2, 2], [3]],
 [[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2], [2, 3], [3]],
 [[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3], [2, 3], [3]],
 [[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 3], [3]]]
```

Changing priority from major to blocker.

Changing component from PLEASE CHANGE to combinatorics.

Sorry, the above examples were not minimal.  I think the following are minimal for `max_entry=3`:

```
[[[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2], [2], [3]],
 [[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2], [2], [3]],
 [[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2], [2], [3]],
 [[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2], [2], [3]]]
```

looking at 


```
sage: t = SemistandardTableau([[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2], [2], [3]])
sage: RSK_inverse(t,t, "array")
[[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3], 
 [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1]]
```


we see that the array is not in lexicographic order.  Maybe that's part of the problem.

Changing priority from blocker to critical.

This probably won't be considered as a blocker because it isn't breaking anything. However, this is a serious bug that we need to fix. I will take a look at this today. If I can't figure out a fix by tomorrow, we'll put up a stopgap (which are considered blockers because we want them in ASAP).

I usually leave such decisions to the release manager, but it's true that this most certainly not a blocker. It's just an ordinary bug...

Changing status from new to needs_review.

Comment by tscrim created at 2016-04-13 18:58:35

Error caused by `dict` not being ordered. This should fix these issues once and for all.

wonderful, thank you!  Unfortunately, it is rather unlikely that I can review this properly before end of next week, I'm really sorry about that.
