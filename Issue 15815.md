This meta-ticket tracks those tickets for changing the Sage library that did not go into stage 1 (ticket:15980).

Some reasons for assigning tasks to stage 2:
* The code can run on Python 2 only with the support of imported "compatibility" libraries. [copied from description] 
  Maybe we have to check the licenses of the used compatibility libraries.
* The tasks are usually more complicated. The approach may not be obvious or uncontroversial.
* To make progress we need a Python 3.3 test environment for them.

This ticket is referenced by the meta-ticket ticket:15530

Is it true that this stage 2 depends on the modifications already made to stage 1? Then perhaps we should put #15980 in the dependencies field of the ticket.

Stage 2 does not //depend// on stage 1. The tickets of stage 1 could be solved after stage 2 tickets. They are usually improvements of Py2 code (without relying on separate "compatibility layer").

Both stage 1 and stage 2 are tracked as dependencies of the meta-ticket ticket:15530.
