Keywords: laurent polynomials, polynomials, coercion, categories


```
sage: R = LaurentPolynomialRing(ZZ, 'x')
sage: T = LaurentPolynomialRing(QQ, 'x')
sage: R.gen() + T.gen()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for '+': 'Univariate Laurent Polynomial Ring in x over Integer Ring' and 'Univariate Laurent Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field'
```

Compare with the more complicated:

```
sage: R = PolynomialRing(ZZ, 'x').fraction_field()
sage: T = PolynomialRing(QQ, 'x').fraction_field()
sage: R.gen() + T.gen()
2*x
```


CCing Travis on this because it's a pain the ass for #15311.

I have just been hit by a similar problem:

```
sage: R = LaurentPolynomialRing(ZZ, 'x')
sage: T = PolynomialRing(ZZ, 'x')
sage: R.gen() + T.gen()
2*x
sage: R.gen() + FractionField(T).gen()
BOOM !
```

Here is something that seems to work. There remains to add doctests for the new behaviour.

This breaks division:

```
sage: T.<x> = LaurentPolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: 1 / x
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

Too bad.. Maybe then one can content ourselves to solve the initial problem, and not try to solve the problem about the fraction field, which seems to be harder ?


---

Comment by chapoton created at 2014-02-12 09:55:24

Maybe one could also ensure that the fraction field of a Laurent Polynomial ring is just the fraction field of its associated polynomial ring ?

I like this idea as the usual polynomial rings are much better behaved as a fraction field compared to their Laurent counterparts (even with #11726). However I think we should ask on sage-devel if everyone else agrees with doing this as things like `numerator` won't return Laurent polynomials.

I like it better too.  Asking on sage-devel might be a good plan though.  I've made a branch that does this, and fixes the bug with `1/x` observed above.

Travis, what do you think of the two failing doctests in HallAlgebra (see patchbot report) ?

The first one looks innocent enough, but the second one seems rather strange to me.


---

Comment by darij created at 2014-02-13 12:52:47

Both doctest failures in the Hall algebra file are exactly what should be happening. These doctests were illustrating a bug!


---

Comment by chapoton created at 2014-02-13 15:06:39

I have changed the doctests in hall_algebra.

One should add tests for the new bahvior of `FractionField`.

I added some tests in the `fraction_field` method.  Were you thinking of others?

Two comments, not a review (I fear I have no idea what spooky action at a distance these changes might cause):

- In `hall_algebra.py`, please change not just the doctests but the whole WARNING they're in. They should be a regular example, not a WARNING.

- Could you maybe document `converter`? I know it's an internal function, but I want to understand what it does and why.

Comment by chapoton created at 2014-02-13 16:08:26

`@`David:
I was thinking to something like

```
sage: FractionField(LaurentPolynomialRing(QQ,'x'))
Fraction Field of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field
```

but, yes, this can be considered as superfluous.

`@`Darij, yes, I agree that one should change the doc in hall_algebra in a better way. I was hoping that somebody more knowledgeable than me about this part of sage would do that.

Comment by tscrim created at 2014-02-14 16:51:14

Okay, I've fixed up the Hall algebra documentation. I've changed `to_fraction()` into `_fraction_pair()` since this is only suppose to be used for the coercion (so it's hidden) and IMO it more accurately reflects what is being returned. If you're happy with my changes, then up to someone not likely what we're doing on sage-devel, it's a positive review from me.
