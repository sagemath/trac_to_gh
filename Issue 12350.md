# Issue 12350: Check assignment of SAGE_ROOT in $SAGE_ROOT/sage

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/12522

Original creator: jdemeyer

Assignee: leif

The top-level Sage script doesn't check the value of `SAGE_ROOT` if it was set from the outside.  Example:

```
$ SAGE_ROOT=does_not_exist ./sage
./sage: line 118: cd: does_not_exist: No such file or directory
./sage: line 122: /spkg/bin/sage: No such file or directory
```

More error checking can't hurt ;-)
