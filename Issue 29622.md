Is there any way to check the maximum dimension one the palp command is supposed to take? I think I may have bungled my gentoo ebuild by trying to be smarter with it. I have doctest failures that on further scrutiny probably shouldn't be there

by default `POLY_Dmax` should be 6, but it looks like I got something higher.

Figured my issue. First time I was using a particular tool to repeat a build several times with small variation in gentoo - instead of my own homebrewed solution from years ago. And there was a couple of things the documentation wasn't clear about. Plus, there was probably a couple of changes in palp itself that were thwarting the way I was varying `POLY_Dmax`. I have things under control and much tighter now.

Looks good to me.
