Let's continue #19517. We shall include the code to Sage after 8.1 is out, but we can write it before that.

What is the definition of "canonical form with restrictions"? Maybe something like

"Canonical labeling is actually defined by some injective function that maps graphs to integers, and canonical form is the permutation of vertices that minimizes the function.

Both `partition` and `edge_labels` restrict possible permutations. That is, `g.canonical_label(partition=[[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]])` tries only swapping pairs 1/2, 3/4 and 5/6 and see what permutation out of 8 possible gives smallest value by the canonicality function. See below for examples."

What should `edge_labels` actually do? I tried with

```
sage: C5 = graphs.CycleGraph(5)
sage: C = C5+C5
sage: C.set_edge_label(0, 1, 'a')
sage: C.set_edge_label(1, 2, 'b')
sage: C.set_edge_label(2, 3, 'c')
sage: C.set_edge_label(3, 4, 'd')
sage: C.set_edge_label(4, 0, 'e')
sage: C.canonical_label(algorithm='sage', edge_labels=True).show()
```

and do not understand. I assumed to get a ring 0-1-2-3-4-0 (and another with 5-8-7-6-9-5), but got a ring 0-1-2-4-3-0.

What is important is that the following will display the same graph, i.e., the canonical labeling is unique for this isomorphism class.

```
sage: D = C.relabel(perm=Permutations(C.vertices()).random_element(), inplace=False)
sage: D.canonical_label(algorithm='sage', edge_labels=True).show()
```

That works, but even totally ignoring `edge_labels` would satisfy that. It seems to work and the parameter is not ignored, but I do not understand what is the meaning of paramater.
