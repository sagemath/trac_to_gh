Behold this bug:

```
K.<a> = NumberField(x^2-5)
EllipticCurve(K,[1..5]).change_ring(RR)
```

BOOM!

It's nothing to do with elliptic curves.  Try

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2-5)
sage: RR(K(1))     
```

So the expected "natural" coercion from elements of K to elements of RR is blowing up, instead of using the default embedding.
