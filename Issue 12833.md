# Issue 12833: "maximum recursion depth exceeded" when doing change_ring(RR) on an elliptic curve

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Behold this bug:

```
K.<a> = NumberField(x^2-5)
EllipticCurve(K,[1..5]).change_ring(RR)
```

BOOM!

```
...
  File "coerce_maps.pyx", line 82, in sage.structure.coerce_maps.DefaultConvertMap_unique._call_ (sage/structure/coerce_maps.c:3345)
  File "coerce_maps.pyx", line 77, in sage.structure.coerce_maps.DefaultConvertMap_unique._call_ (sage/structure/coerce_maps.c:3248)
  File "/Users/wstein/sage/build/sage-5.0/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/rings/complex_field.py", line 286, in _element_constructor_
    if not isinstance(x, (real_mpfr.RealNumber, tuple)):
RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded while calling a Python object
```

It's nothing to do with elliptic curves.  Try

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2-5)
sage: RR(K(1))     
```

So the expected "natural" coercion from elements of K to elements of RR is blowing up, instead of using the default embedding.

Can you add doctests for number fields that already embeds into a real field (possibly of precision different from that of R)?

Can you mention the ticket number as `:trac:`#13005`` in the documentation?

Never ever do this: 

```
            raise TypeError("cannot convert %s to real number"%(self)) 
```
