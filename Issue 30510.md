We move `is_package_installed` etc. to `sage_setup`, leaving deprecated `lazy_import`s behind.

We keep `PackageNotFoundError` (after #30607, instantiation already leads to a deprecation warning).

We move `src/bin/sage-list-packages` to `build/bin`. It is only used in `build/bin/sage-site` (to implement `sage --installed` etc.) and not documented individually as a script.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30747
