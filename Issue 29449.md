I have launched my patchbot on your branch, and you can see its report by clicking on the colored round icon at top right. It mainly complains that the doc does not build.

```
+[dochtml] OSError: /sage/combinat/posets/hasse_diagram.py:
docstring of sage.combinat.posets.hasse_diagram.HasseDiagram.diamonds:3:
WARNING: Unexpected indentation.
```

It also complains about unused imports and about using "Returns" instead of "Return". For more info, see the little red signs in the patchbot report page.

I have made a bunch of reviewer changes. Please take a look. Most notable is I removed the `mobile.py` since it does not (currently) contain much information (so be sure to have this separated or be aware of this when you merge my changes to later branches). It is best to add that on a later ticket IMO. If my changes are good with you, and once you put your real name as the author, then this can be set to a positive review.
