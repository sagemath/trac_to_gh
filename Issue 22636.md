Incomplete gamma doesn't do anything given ball arguments

```
sage: gamma(2, RBF(1/3))
gamma(2, [0.3333333333333333 +/- 7.04e-17])
sage: gamma(2., RBF(1/3))
gamma(2.00000000000000, [0.3333333333333333 +/- 7.04e-17])
```

It's not use making a `GinacFunction` out of this so a Python solution should do.
