Maybe I misunderstood the purpose of this ticket (cf. the description I added), but after pulling the branch here, `interrupt.so` still gets linked to both PARI and GMP (i.e., MPIR).

(Probably you just intended a proper rebuild of it upon changes to libgmp, but the patch looks as if you intended to remove the libraries from the extension module.)

IMHO at most PARI should get linked to it.

Ok, I see, in `sage/libs/pari/paridecl.pxd`, there's (still)

```python
# distutils: libraries = gmp pari
```


Do we really need `gmp` there as well?


---

Comment by leif created at 2015-11-21 20:23:29

Certainly `interrupt.so` doesn't use/need GMP (but `PARI_SIGINT_*` from PARI), but can we (easily) remove GMP from it?

AFAICS, the declarations are only needed/used in `sage/ext/interrupt/implementation.c`, i.e., genuine C code, not Cython.

Comment by leif created at 2015-11-21 21:35:28

The following works for me to get rid of GMP (i.e., avoids overlinking `interrupt.so` with libgmp):

(preliminary hack)

Probably another `distutils: depends` for PARI is needed in `sage/ext/interrupt/interrupt.pxd`.

P.S.:  The copied declarations are IMHO unlikely to change.

Anyway, I pushed a slightly cleaner version to [u/leif/19610_reviewer-remove_libgmp_from_interrupt.so](http://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit/?h=u/leif/19610_reviewer-remove_libgmp_from_interrupt.so&id=e12e9b61467b4109500c0da7f2490e25a4dbecc7).

Yes, because PARI needs gmp:

Well, of course *PARI* needs GMP, but not (necessarily) modules using PARI; that's a transitive dependency.  Unless you link statically, you don't have to explicitly specify GMP (and you shouldn't), because the dependency of PARI on GMP is recorded in `libpari.so`.

If GMP changes, PARI will get rebuilt, and hence also modules depending on PARI.

The reason `libgmp` was listed *twice* (and different versions of it!) [comment:ticket:19589:18 in your ldd output] is exactly such overlinking.

Do you have a reference for this? It's the first time I hear somebody say this.

The linked documents are only about Linux (thanks for the links though). I'm not at all convinced that the same holds for all operating systems.

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2015-11-23 09:13:50

If we decide to stop "overlinking", that would be a major change in how we build Sage. It is something which should be discussed on `sage-devel` first. Given that I'm not convinced that there is a problem, I'm not going to write about this.

What you are proposing is not portable: see the first few slides of [https://people.debian.org/~vorlon/dependency-hell/img0.html](https://people.debian.org/~vorlon/dependency-hell/img0.html)

No.  We've cleaned up `module_list.py` a couple of times in the past with respect to this.

Note that it's (only) _the common case_ that you don't have to specify libraries used by the libraries you use.  (In particular, building the whole Sage library with the linker option `--as-needed` doesn't work, but would work for most modules.)

The main exceptions are:

 * A library is _intentionally_ "underlinked", e.g. to allow the user to choose from different (binary-compatible) alternatives at the final link stage or even at run-time, or the user/application has to provide some symbols the library uses (e.g. memory management functions, error handlers etc.).

 * The interface of the library (i.e., the header) exposes symbols of a library it uses, such that your code at least _may_ contain references to the otherwise only indirectly used library.  This is in principle the same as if you would explicitly use the other library directly as well, but not always as obvious, and may (or usually does) depend on your code, not necessarily just the header(s) you include.  (Stupid example:  PARI could have a function `pari_foo(x)` implemented as a macro or inline function which expands to `gmp_bar(x)` or of course more complicated code containing calls of GMP functions.  Then you'd have to explicitly link with GMP _if your code actually uses that macro or inline function_.  But it's also a poor example, in that for especially PARI/GMP, this is _not_ the case -- AFAIK.  A better example is probably MPC/MPFR, but you hardly ever use MPC without also _explicitly_ using MPFR.)

Are you sure? We've certainly cleaned up `module_list.py` a couple of times, but I don't think it ever was to remove libraries only appearing as indirect dependencies.

ROFL, e.g. #18777?  (The others date back much longer...)

#18777 removed libraries which were unused by that module. You are here proposing something different: to remove libraries which are used indirectly by a module.

I doubt that the following statement is true on all operating systems:

Anyway, can we please go back to the review of this ticket? If you want to discuss more general linking issues, open a thread on `sage-devel`.

Well, _you_ asked general questions.

> Anyway, can we please go back to the review of this ticket?

`interrupt.so` still does not need GMP, but with your current patch, GMP gets linked to it.  (Worse, not even the Cython code, `interrupt.*`, where `paridecl` gets imported, uses any PARI stuff.)  I agree that copy-pasting parts of PARI headers (although it's just a single line) is not nice, but that's more a problem of the PARI headers and I was simply getting bored of trying which to include and which not.  (Probably the top-level one is ok as well, but seems overkill to me.)

I still don't like the IMHO redundant `libraries = pari gmp` (in `paridecl.pxd`), but it's not a major issue either (until we or some people switch to PARI with a different kernel at least).

Perhaps cc some more reviewers, e.g. François.

There are certainly OSs which don't have shared/dynamic libraries...

But besides that their names/extensions vary, the above holds for all platforms supported by Sage, _AFAIK<sup>TM</sup>_.

It does need GMP since it uses PARI which needs GMP. It's true that the Cython code doesn't use anything of PARI or GMP, but the C code in `implementation.c` does.

So `sage-on-gentoo` is built with `-Wl,--as-needed` which discard unneeded libraries. Because `interrupt.so` doesn't directly use `gmp` it is not kept. For that to work libpari has to be properly linked to libgmp - by that I mean, libgmp has to be in the `NEEDED` section of libpari.

Equivalently on OS X everything will be fine so long as all the `install_name`s are properly set to the right value.

Yes it will break if your system only use static libraries. Static libraries don't know where to get their other needed bits - unless you bundle them in in the first place.

I don't know if cygwin is properly equipped to deal with something like a `needed` section or even if it exists on windows (I'll confess ignorance in that matter). I also don't know how things will go on BSD, they are using elf but some bits may depend on the libc implementation and of course `ld`.

Linking with `gmp` is not useful on OS X and linux but it won't hurt.

I should say I haven't read the whole thread, and now that I see more of it. there are some points that can be made:
 * it is of course legal to underlink a library
 * only executable need to have all their symbols resolved

A case in point is vanilla `gsl`. libgsl needs a `cblas` library but it is not linked against `cblas` implementation (unless you do something). So there is no entry for a `cblas` in the elf table. When you build an application against libgsl you have to provide a cblas library whether your application use cblas function or not, to resolve the `cblas` symbols in libgsl.

If libpari was underlinked like that you would have to provide your libgmp/libmpir all the time.

Regarding your slides Gentoo applies "the chasing your tail method" (recompile on soname change). I think `sage` fits in that category too. I'll note that if you do it correctly a change in soname for libgmp will trigger a rebuild of libpari but not of interrupt.so _and it shouldn't have too_ if libpari didn't change its soname there is no impact on interrupt.so.

If your handling of soname is not done properly or your are overlinking you are exposing yourself to excessive rebuilding. Making sure your handling of soname is right is the hard bit. Only now do we have interesting mechanism that will trigger rebuild on soname change in Gentoo and I won't pretend that every gentoo dev understand them properly.

One more to be in rant mode: dev that thinks soname and install_name are not important or even ignorant of them should be sent in re-education before touching a library (I am looking at you Fredrick Johansson with your `arb` package - and now that `arb` has been made standard it can contribute to the brokenness on OS X 10.11).

It is (tautologically) true on every operating system where you can link shared libraries to other shared libraries.

I don't know of an OS where you can't link libraries to libraries, but I'd bet that some obscure platform did that back in the old days. Today certainly not.

I don't understand why this would be tautologically true. It might be true whenever the linker is sufficiently clever, but I don't know if that's the fact on all operating systems. I have particular doubts about Cygwin, because I know that linker command lines often have to be changed for Cygwin.

We should get rid of `decl.pxi`.
And its several inclusions within other `pxd` files.

Did you mean to post this on #19590? But yes, of course we should.

Argh yes, I did intend to post to the NTL ticket.

I'll check the recursive dep on Cygwin when I have some time.
For sure on Cygwin you have to explicitely specify every thing that is needed at link time.
I don't remember how it goes when a linked lib itself needs another library but it might be the case you need to specify both in that case...
It sounds crazy but linking on Cygwin is.

This ticket has nothing to do with Cygwin, it's only about adding a dependency.

This is getting a bit too long, so let me try to summarize:

Replying to [comment:38 jdemeyer]:

But the dependency is wrong (interrupt does not depend on gmp).

Cygwin doesn't really have shared libraries, it uses a static library hack (the Cygwin import library) at link time. 

So the real question is should we
* Overlink on all platforms
* Artificially inject all libraries on Cygwin only (via LDFLAGS, say)

Sage has always chosen the first option, so there are probably many overlinked modules in Sage.

So: can we please just focus on the bug that this ticket is about? If you want to discuss overlinking, please do it somewhere else.

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2015-12-24 12:32:54

Let me also summarize: this ticket is about adding a dependency of `interrupt.pyx` on PARI.

This ticket has absolutely nothing to do with linking and it does not change anything related to linking.

Comment by vbraun created at 2015-12-24 12:34:38

It seems that we have a branch for each approach already so we might just as well merge the one we want to pursue in the future. 

Jean-Pierre, do you have any thoughts on Cygwin?

IMHO the "always overlink" approach is simpler and the cost of unnecessarily compiling an extension module is low (its just a single source file, no extra configure and recursive make).

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2015-12-24 12:39:21

Can we please stop this? This has *NOTHING* to do with linking, why is that so hard to understand?


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2015-12-24 12:42:59

Or maybe I should turn the question around: why do you think that this ticket is somehow related to linking?

Changing status from needs_review to positive_review.

Comment by jpflori created at 2015-12-24 14:30:25

I suggest to fix the dependency here and fix the overlinking issue elsewhere (e.g. using leif branch).

As far as Cygwin is concerned, the situation is quite good actually: you just need to have at hand libs directly used by your executable/library and feed them to the linker with appropriate flags as I just tested on a VM.
If these libraries need further libraries then everything is resolved at run time.
So in the linking ticket, we can drop the `gmp` library.

The main issue with cygwin is that the need above is mandatory: if you wanna use a gmp function (whatever it relies on, even further libraries) then you need to tell it to the linker whereas linux is more negligent about that and just bet that at runtime every undefined symbol will be resolved.
And many times people modified a random Sage cython file, use some gmp function (typically `mpn_popcount` don't ask me why :)) and forgott to make gmp a dependency.
Nowadays, thanks to Jeroen work, it should be less an issue as when people want to use `mpn_popcount` they have to cimport it and it will automagically tell the linker that gmp has to be linked in.
