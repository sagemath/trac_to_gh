Assignee: somebody

`ZZ['x']` polynomials have a square_free_decomposition() method; all polynomials have a squarefree_decomposition() method (as of 2.8.7).  (Yes, I'm the one who added both of them.  I don't know what I was thinking.)

I have a patch for this which I will attach as soon as -testall is finished.
