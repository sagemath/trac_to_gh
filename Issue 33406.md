`src/doc/en/comstructions/interface_issues.rst` has wildly outdated recommendations on how to cite Sage. 

They should be removed; but there is also good (but also outdated) advice that underlying software (GAP, Singular, PARI, ...) should be cited. This should be updated and merged into `faq-general.rst`
