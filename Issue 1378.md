no, there was no ssh-keygen installed, after installation (on Debian
Etch ssh-keygen is provided by the package ssh-client) it works
perfectly now without options, just notebook(),

this should be annotated in the installation manual in the list of
required packages,
and the possibility notebook(secure=false) if it's not installed

thank you very much....
