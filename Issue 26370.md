Please check that this does not conflict with #26440. Once that is resolved in either direction, you can set a positive review.

The `FusionRing` is not a graded algebra (at least, by using the dimension of the representation), so when `k is not None`, we should not add `Graded`. I can change this and check the category stuff, but I will not be able to do so until either tonight or tomorrow (after I upgrade to beta2).
