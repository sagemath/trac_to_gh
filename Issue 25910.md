I'd prefer to have a solution which solves this at a more global level, e.g. a function `has_items()` which performs this check and can be removed at the fullness of time when python2 support is dropped; similar in style to six. If these here are the only occurrences within all of sage, then this would of course be overkill.

And note that mapping types also have an `items` methods in python2. I think `if hasattr(data, 'iteritems') or hasattr(data, 'items'):` can be simplified into `if hasattr(data, 'items'):`.
