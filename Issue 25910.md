There are many failing doctests in sage.rings.asymptotic when using Python3; fix them.

I'd prefer to have a solution which solves this at a more global level, e.g. a function `has_items()` which performs this check and can be removed at the fullness of time when python2 support is dropped; similar in style to six. If these here are the only occurrences within all of sage, then this would of course be overkill.

For the record #26468 and #26466 fix some py3 issues for FiniteStateMachines.

And note that mapping types also have an `items` methods in python2. I think `if hasattr(data, 'iteritems') or hasattr(data, 'items'):` can be simplified into `if hasattr(data, 'items'):`.
