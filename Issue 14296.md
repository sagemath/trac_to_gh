If I run the following code in python it works fine



```
import httplib
conn = httplib.HTTPConnection("google.de", 80)
conn.request("GET", "/")
```


But in sage this piece prodces an error. The trackball is attached.
In sage when I changed


```
conn = httplib.HTTPConnection("google.de", 80)
```


to


```
conn = httplib.HTTPConnection("google.de")
```


it worked.
I tried replacing httplib.py and socket.py in sage with the files from python. but the problem persists

Ubuntu 12.04 64 bit
Python 2.7
sage 5.8 installed from ubuntu repo

This is not really a bug, although it is annoying. Since I don't see an easy fix, close as invalid?
