Why both lines

```
    (r' \\circ', ' o'),
    (r'\\circ', ' o')
```

Isn't the second good enough?

No: a docstring "f \circ g" should give "f o g" and not "f  o g".

Oh, I see, we do the same with `\\times`.

Your comment is relevant though. Why not using regex like  `(r' *\\circ', 'o')` instead?

We want to keep the space in `f o g`: we don't want `f\\circ g` or `f \\circ g` to get converted to `fo g`.
