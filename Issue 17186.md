It seems like the ring attribute of vector() is ignored in some cases.

The following test should pass, if I understand correctly the use of the vector constructor:


```python
import numpy as np
v = np.asarray([0.5,1])
vv = vector(RealField(rnd='RNDU'),v)
assert vv.parent().rounding_mode() == 'RNDU'
```


Instead, vv is created with ring RDF rather than the correct one, so the assertion fails because it cannot access rounding_mode().

```
