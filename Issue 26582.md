We do th following in this ticket.

In method `eccentricity` of `distances_all_pairs.pyx`:
- add parameter `vertex_list` to . This way we save some calls to `.vertices()`.

In method `eccentricity` of `generic_graph.py`:
- set parameter `vertex_list` when calling method `eccentricity` of `distances_all_pairs.pyx` 
- fix an error in the ordering of returned values (a doctest was false...). This ordering must be consistent with parameter `v`
