Is jsonpointer really necessary, I do not see it on my list of ipython 3 dependencies. But I have mistune (markdown support) for the notebook.

Is jsonpointer an optional package bringing extra features that we should know about?

I just read http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24211371/updating-ipython which says so, I haven't tried if it works without jsonpointer.

From setup.py in ipython 3

```
# setuptools requirements

pyzmq = 'pyzmq>=13'

extras_require = dict(
    parallel = [pyzmq],
    qtconsole = [pyzmq, 'pygments'],
    doc = ['Sphinx>=1.1', 'numpydoc'],
    test = ['nose>=0.10.1', 'requests'],
    terminal = [],
    nbformat = ['jsonschema>=2.0'],
    notebook = ['tornado>=4.0', pyzmq, 'jinja2', 'pygments', 'mistune>=0.5'],
    nbconvert = ['pygments', 'jinja2', 'mistune>=0.3.1']
)

if not sys.platform.startswith('win'):
    extras_require['notebook'].append('terminado>=0.3.3')

if sys.version_info < (3, 3):
    extras_require['test'].append('mock')

extras_require['notebook'].extend(extras_require['nbformat'])
extras_require['nbconvert'].extend(extras_require['nbformat'])

install_requires = []

# add readline
if sys.platform == 'darwin':
    if 'bdist_wheel' in sys.argv[1:] or not setupext.check_for_readline():
        install_requires.append('gnureadline')
elif sys.platform.startswith('win'):
    extras_require['terminal'].append('pyreadline>=2.0')

everything = set()
for deps in extras_require.values():
    everything.update(deps)
extras_require['all'] = everything
```

So I think jsonpointer is not necessary but mistune is. I checked the direct dependencies for jsonpointer but did not find anything.

In fact we may want to add terminado to that list.

Terminado is definitely optional... you can pip install it if you want the option for a web-based terminal but its not required.

Looks like jsonpointer isn't necessary after all
