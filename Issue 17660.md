Is jsonpointer really necessary, I do not see it on my list of ipython 3 dependencies. But I have mistune (markdown support) for the notebook.

Is jsonpointer an optional package bringing extra features that we should know about?

From setup.py in ipython 3

```
# setuptools requirements

pyzmq = 'pyzmq>=13'

extras_require = dict(
    parallel = [pyzmq],
    qtconsole = [pyzmq, 'pygments'],
    doc = ['Sphinx>=1.1', 'numpydoc'],
    test = ['nose>=0.10.1', 'requests'],
    terminal = [],
    nbformat = ['jsonschema>=2.0'],
    notebook = ['tornado>=4.0', pyzmq, 'jinja2', 'pygments', 'mistune>=0.5'],
    nbconvert = ['pygments', 'jinja2', 'mistune>=0.3.1']
)

if not sys.platform.startswith('win'):
    extras_require['notebook'].append('terminado>=0.3.3')

if sys.version_info < (3, 3):
    extras_require['test'].append('mock')

extras_require['notebook'].extend(extras_require['nbformat'])
extras_require['nbconvert'].extend(extras_require['nbformat'])

install_requires = []

# add readline
if sys.platform == 'darwin':
    if 'bdist_wheel' in sys.argv[1:] or not setupext.check_for_readline():
        install_requires.append('gnureadline')
elif sys.platform.startswith('win'):
    extras_require['terminal'].append('pyreadline>=2.0')

everything = set()
for deps in extras_require.values():
    everything.update(deps)
extras_require['all'] = everything
```

So I think jsonpointer is not necessary but mistune is. I checked the direct dependencies for jsonpointer but did not find anything.

Terminado is definitely optional... you can pip install it if you want the option for a web-based terminal but its not required.
