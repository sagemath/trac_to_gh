# Issue 11519: scaling_term only appears in documentation

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: iandrus

Original creation time: 2011-08-16 09:04:21

Assignee: iandrus

The scaling_term is documented in `Graph.plot?` but in fact does nothing.  Moreover, if passed to to `Graph.show` it returns an error.


```
sage: search_src('scaling_term')
graphs/generic_graph.py:12985:        - ``scaling_term`` -- default is 0.05. if vertices are getting
graphs/graph_plot.py:577:            scaling_term -- default is 0.05. if vertices are getting chopped off,
sage: Graph([This is the Trac macro *1,2* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#1,2-macro)).show(scaling_term=3)

I tried to look around on the documentation of matplotlib whether this could have matched one of their former parameters, but it looks like this "scaling_term" is a pure Sage invention. Weird. Neither have I any idea of what it could be transformed into.

We will probably be better without this in the documentation for the moment.
