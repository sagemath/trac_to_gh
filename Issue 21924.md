`EllipticCurveIsogeny` takes degree as a parameter. Part of the code determines the order of the points in the kernel naively. We can speed this up by using the fact that the order is bounded by the degree.

You are trying to avoid computing the group order I think, and I assume that the use case is large finite fields?   I think that a better solution would be to change the order method of points to allow an optional multiple of the order to be passed together with its prime factors. Here the isogeny degree would be passed.  This would be more generally useful.

Either way you should add a doctest illustrating the speedup, or explain why you do not.
