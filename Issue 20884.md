\\

Sage saying that 10<sup>-14</sup> > 10<sup>-14</sup> appears a bit stupid; either the doctesting framework should be more tolerant here, or give better messages regarding the deviation.

(Inspired by #21119.)

One could also change the code below its definition rather than (just) `failstr()`.

I.e., we should **at least** make sure `"%.0e" % RIFtol(actual).center()` doesn't give the same as `"%.0e" % RIFtol(desired).center()`.  (Not sure whether using `.center()` here is at all the right thing, or whether we should at all use `RIF` for the *tolerance values* themselves; see also below.)

If it does, we may increase the number of (mantissa) digits in the former.  Or in both, until they differ.

And that's orthogonal to improving hints regarding the actual deviation, i.e., if one wants to adjust the *expected figures* rather than (just) the tolerance.

If the intervals of *want* and *got* do not overlap (i.e., when the tolerance is exceeded), we could also give `.upper()` and `.lower()` (or vice versa, depending on whether *want* is smaller or larger than *got*).

To do:

Replace `True` by `dp <= some_meaningful_number` and `break` by `return ...` (returning what's now returned below, after the loop).

Then if we exit the `while` loop (giving up on too many decimal places), fall back to returning some other (meaningful) output, of course again other than `... x > x`.
