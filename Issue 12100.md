Looks mostly good to me. I have just two comments:
1. In `sage/modular/local_comp/type_space.py` line 42 do you want to add `# long time` in addition to the statement you wrote?
2. I am not sure what configuration the server sage.math has, and that configuration might change over time. I think it will be better if the processor is mentioned instead of the server name; like `on Intel corei7 (8 cores)`. Then you wouldn't need to mention the year also. What is your opinion on this?

Down by around ten seconds. But this one?

And what are these?


```

```

I got here too late to help, it seems.  I think we might want a discussion on sage-devel about the role of long tests.  Whenever I test a beta build I run all the long tests anyway (what's the point otherwise?), and casual users will not run any tests.

`# long time` serves purposes beyond that:
1. non-long tests are actually used, for example the patchbot does non-long tests only.
2. "long time" serves as documentation to the user that some command is supposed to take a long time.
3. keeping track of the runtime of these tests makes it possible to detect regressions.  For example, for the `integral_points()` tests, it was marked as taking 35s but I found it actually took 50s.  I agree "long time" isn't the best solution for this, but it's the best we currently have.

Thanks for checking.

> * sage/combinat/root_system/pieri_factors.py
Removed `# long time` here.

> * sage/crypto/mq/sr.py
> * sage/geometry/triangulation/point_configuration.py
> * sage/groups/matrix_gps/matrix_group.py
> * sage/rings/function_field/function_field.py

These already had `# long time`, I just changed or added the time.  So the "before" and "after" are meaningless because they are both not running the changed tests.

Anybody feels like giving this a final review?

I also removed one extra `# long time` from `sage/graphs/generic_graph.py` as #12888 considerably speeds it up.
