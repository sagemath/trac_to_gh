# Issue 15433: eliminate_linear_variables() may increase degree

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15670

Original creator: malb

Original creation time: 2014-01-13 17:14:57

CC:  polybori alexanderdreyer bouillaguet

Keywords: polybori

eliminate_linear_variabels() may call polynomial.eliminate.ll which in turn may increase the degree. This shouldn't happen (by default).
