This fixes two doctest failures with Python 3 in `src/sage/algebras/steenrod/`. 

This is a little progress, but there is a third failure which I do not understand:

If we can fix the coercion problem here, that's great. We can also defer that to another ticket and do the easy fixes right away. So I'm marking this as "needs review".

thanks for trying to help.

In the change

```
sorted(list(A[5].basis()))
```
you can remove list and just use sorted. Once done, you can set to positive

By the way, for another ticket, there is with python3 a very annoying issue in these files

```
Killing test src/sage/homology/cell_complex.py
Killing test src/sage/homology/delta_complex.py
```
that involve an infinite recursion error.
