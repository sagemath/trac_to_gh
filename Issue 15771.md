Keywords: gfun Mgfun Ore guessing

the group of Manuel Kauers at RISC develops the `ore_algebra` package
(http://www.risc.jku.at/research/combinat/software/ore_algebra/index.php) which is similar to the
Maple gfun package (but more powerful since it works in more general rings), and will be extended to
the multivariate case. A small example with version 0.1:

```
  sage: from ore_algebra import *
  sage: R.<x> = QQ[]; A.<Dx> = OreAlgebra(R)
  sage: deq = guess([1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21],A)
  sage: deq
  (x^2 + x - 1)*Dx + 2*x + 1
  sage: rec = A(deq).to_S(A2)
  sage: rec
  (-n - 2)*Sn^2 + (n + 2)*Sn + n + 2
```

But it isn't, is it?

Sure, `ore_algebra` is available as an spkg. It already was Paul openeed this ticket. So the way I understand the ticket's description is that it is about including `ore_algebra` into sage itself (either as a package, or perhaps by making it part of the sage library, if Manuel & co are interested—I know they were considering it at some point, but I don't know how things are standing now). I could understand that you suggest to close the ticket as wontfix if you believe it should just stay an external package, but I don't think the issue is fixed.

Sorry, I never reviewed optional packages before, and I thought the idea was to use the ticket to review that the package worked well once all that was done, not to decide whether to make it an optional package at all. But if positive review only means "yes, this should be an optional package," then I agree with you.
