Assignee: @malb

CC:  @malb alexanderdreyer polybori

Keywords: BooleanPolynomial

This is in contradiction with other functions (BooleanPolynomial.nvariables), and with the behavior of the "normal" class MPolynomial.

Example:

```
sage: R.<x,y,z> = BooleanPolynomialRing()
sage: p = R(1)
sage: p.variables()
(1,)
sage: p.nvariables()
0
```

Which differs from:

```
sage: R.<x,y,z> = GF(2)[]
sage: p = R(1)
sage: p.variables()
()
sage: p.nvariables()
0
```

Hi, can you add a doctest that shows that the issue is resolved? I also CCed the PolyBoRi developers to make sure there isn't some obscure reason for this behaviour.

Hi,

I actually did, in fact. I modified the existing docstring to verify that:

```
sage: P.one_element().variables()  
()
```

Should I add anything else?
