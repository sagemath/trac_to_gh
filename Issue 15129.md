I guess the bug is also:
* http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=57680

Ok the previous bug was unrelated.
The right one was here:
* http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=57982
and has been fixed upstream after my bumping.

This `spkg-install` uses `set -e`. So, you should remove all the extra checking you added, and you might want to move the `set -e` down to after the patching.

Thanks, I did not pay attention to `set -e`...

Is this fixed by #17169?
