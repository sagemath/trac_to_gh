While fixing this, I also changed the TypeErrors to more appropriate ValueErrors, added a catch for non-primeness that is just slightly more informative (since no longer from legendre_symbol, but from the function itself), and added a doctest of one of these ValueErrors.

Here's a trivial observation on performance. Look at the line

```
247	        for r in range(2,p):
```

With the patch as is, on sage.math I get the following timings:

```
# BEFORE
sage: p = 179424673
sage: time quadratic_nonresidue(p)
CPU times: user 9.07 s, sys: 4.37 s, total: 13.44 s
Wall time: 13.44 s
5
sage: timeit("quadratic_nonresidue(p)")
5 loops, best of 3: 19.3 s per loop
```

Now if I change the said line to

```
247	        for r in xrange(2,p):
```

I get some performance improvement:

```
# AFTER
sage: p = 179424673
sage: time quadratic_nonresidue(p)
CPU times: user 0.00 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.00 s
Wall time: 0.00 s
5
sage: timeit("quadratic_nonresidue(p)")
625 loops, best of 3: 36.6 Âµs per loop
```

However, in both cases whether we use `range()` or `xrange()`, if p is say 88462514817229869523, then I get the following error for `range()`:

```
sage: p = 88462514817229869523

    245     ## Find the smallest non-residue mod p
    246     try:

    248             if legendre_symbol(r, p) == -1:
    249                 return r

TypeError: range() integer end argument expected, got sage.rings.integer.Integer.
```

And for `xrange()`, I get a similar error, but this time it's an `OverflowError`:

```

REFEREE REPORT



The patch `quad-nonres.patch` applies OK against Sage 3.4.1.alpha0; all doctests passed with the options

```
-t -long
```

I'm also adding the patch `trac_5627-referee.patch` which adds another test case in addition to kcrisman's test case. This patch should be applied on top of kcrisman's patch. So positive review for kcrisman's patch. Only my patch needs to be reviewed.



As for my observation on performance improvement, I agree with kcrisman that the issue should definitely be addressed in another ticket. That issue should not prevent kcrisman's patch from being applied, since kcrisman's patch only deals with exception handling, adding a test case, and fixing a typo.

I have added another patch after looking carefully at this, which does the following:

1. I removed hilbert_symbol_rational(), making a trivial change to hilbert_symbol() so that it already works on rationals.  I think this will useful outside the quadratic forms module.
2. I moved IsPadicSquare() to a member function for rationals, so you now say r.is_padic_square(p) instead of IsPadicSquare(r,p), while at the same time making the function simpler and cleaner.  I think this will also be useful outside the quadratic forms module.
3. I removed random_int_upto(n) since it does the same as ZZ.random_element(n).
4. I simplified quadratic_nonresidue() (and changed its name to least_quadratic_nonresidue()) -- by putting in three simple tests for when the answer is 2, 3 or 5 the loop is avoided in 7/8 of the cases.   I also changed the loop to "for r in xsrange(7,p)", in response to the discussion earlier on this ticket:  adding the x gives an iterator instead of making the whole list and iterating through it (bad for large p!), and adding the s makes the iterator yield Sage integers (so it works for p too large to fit into a python int).  I also added an is_prime() test on p, since otherwise if you give it a huge composite number there seemed to be a danger that it would run through a loop of length p before realising that the input was invalid.

All tests in sage/quadratic_forms pass, as do those in arith.py and rational.py which were also touched.

If one of the origianl posters can ok my patch then the whole lot can be merged, I hope.

You are probably right, I got a bit carried away when I saw functions I knew I would like to use but rather hidden away.

I think that for functions which are only used in this module (i.e. quadratic_forms/*) we do not need to go through the deprecation procedure, especially as this stuff has not been in Sage long anyway.

A suitable new Summary would be something like "Tidy up utility functions for quadratic forms", but I'll leave that to you as it is your patch.

By the way, the extend_to_primitive() function will be extremely useful too, and I would like to see it mvoed to somewhere like matrix/matrix_integer_dense.pyx (where smith_form is) but I thought I had wreaked enough havoc as it was.

Any comment from mvngu who did the original refereeing?

Done at #5834.  The patch there is the same as the 3rd one here (rebased and checked), and it relies on the first two patches here being applied first.  The third patch here can now be deleted.

Next time I feel inspired to do something similar I'll do so in a new ticket in the first place.

They were not my "oops"s, and I agree with you.  I just did not remove them.  If we do this now with a new ticket/ patch then it will interfere with #5834 but I think I could live with that.
