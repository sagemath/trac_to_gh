CC:  ncohen

At #14806, an immutable graph backend has been introduced. However, the resulting graphs are not known to be immutable.

```
sage: g = graphs.CompleteGraph(400)
sage: gi = Graph(g,data_structure="static_sparse")
sage: hash(gi)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: graphs are mutable, and thus not hashable
```

So, when the immutable graph backend is used, then the `._immutable` attribute should be set to True.

But hang on: Does using the immutable graph backend really result in immutable graphs? I.e., would it really be impossible to change the `==`- and `cmp`-classes of a graph by "official" methods such as "`add_vertex()`"? And is the current equality testing really what we want to test?

Currently, `__eq__()` starts like this:

```
        # inputs must be (di)graphs:
        if not isinstance(other, GenericGraph):
            raise TypeError("cannot compare graph to non-graph (%s)"%str(other))
        from sage.graphs.all import Graph
        g1_is_graph = isinstance(self, Graph) # otherwise, DiGraph
        g2_is_graph = isinstance(other, Graph) # otherwise, DiGraph

        if (g1_is_graph != g2_is_graph):
            return False
        if self.allows_multiple_edges() != other.allows_multiple_edges():
            return False
        if self.allows_loops() != other.allows_loops():
            return False
        if self.order() != other.order():
            return False
        if self.size() != other.size():
            return False
        if any(x not in other for x in self):
            return False
        if self._weighted != other._weighted:
            return False
```


1. Is it really a good idea to raise an error when testing equality of a graph with a non-graph? Most likely not!
2. For sure, a graph that *has* multiple edges can not be equal to a graph that does not have multiple edges. But should it really matter whether a graph *allows* multiple edges when it actually doesn't *have* multiple edges?
3. Similarly for `.allows_loops()`.
4. Should `._weighted` be totally removed? Note the following comment in the documentation of the `.weighted()` method: "edge weightings can still exist for (di)graphs `G` where `G.weighted()` is `False`". Ouch.

Note the following annoying example from the docs of `.weighted()`:

```
            sage: G = Graph({0:{1:'a'}}, sparse=True)
            sage: H = Graph({0:{1:'b'}}, sparse=True)
            sage: G == H
            True

        Now one is weighted and the other is not, and thus the graphs are
        not equal::

            sage: G.weighted(True)
            sage: H.weighted()
            False
            sage: G == H
            False
```

So, calling the method `weighted` with an argument changes the `==`-class, even though I guess most mathematicians would agree that `G` has not changed at all. And this would actually be the case even if `G` was using the immutable graph backend!!!

The aim of this ticket is to sort these things out. To the very least, graphs using the immutable graph backend should not be allowed to change their `==`-class by calling `G.weighted(True)`. This would best be done by banning `._weighted` from the equality test.

Shouldn't the hash of graphs be cached, for efficiency? Currently it does `return hash((tuple(self.vertices()), tuple(self.edges())))`, which seems rather expensive.

Note that #12601 makes it possible to comfortably turn the hash (and other special methods) into a cached method.

Concerning "weighted": What exactly is the semantics? Is it the case that a weighted graph has positive integral edge weights, that could be taken as the multiplicity of this edge? But then, do we want that a weighted graph is equal to a multigraph with the corresponding multiplicity of edges?

In any case, the hash is currently broken, since it does not take into account weightedness, but equality check does.

It seems to me that the following is the easiest way to go:
- We keep equality test as it currently is. Here, I am being egoistic: As long as the edge labels and the multiplicity of edges count in equality testing, I simply don't care whether _weighted counts or not. I just need immutable graphs with an unbroken hash.
- In order to fix the hash, it must take into account precisely the data that are used in `__eq__`.
- We want that graphs using the immutable graph backend are immutable in the sense stated above. Hence, we must disallow `G.weighted(True/False)` if `G` is supposed to be immutable. Hence, `G.weighted` should check for the `G._immutable` flag. Similarly, we must proceed with all other non-underscore methods that could potentially change the ==-class of `G`.
- In particular, we want that that `G._immutable` is set when the immutable backend is in use.

Replying to [comment:2 SimonKing]:
> - In order to fix the hash, it must take into account precisely the data that are used in `__eq__`.

Perhaps I am over-eager at this point. The hash is *not* broken. Being broken means that two graphs that evaluate equal have distinct hash values. But this can currently not happen. So, it's fine.

Therefore I modify the "easiest way to go":
- We keep equality test as it currently is. Here, I am being egoistic: As long as the edge labels and the multiplicity of edges count in equality testing, I simply don't care whether _weighted counts or not. I just need immutable graphs *with a fast hash*.
- We want that graphs using the immutable graph backend are immutable in the sense stated above. Hence, we must disallow G.weighted(True/False) if G is supposed to be immutable. Hence, G.weighted should check for the G._immutable flag. Similarly, we must proceed with all other non-underscore methods that could potentially change the ==-class of G. 
- In particular, we want that that G._immutable is set when the immutable backend is in use. 
- The hash will of course keep raising an error if `G._immutable` does not evaluate to True. However, we would not like that the hash of an immutable graph is re-computed, since this is too slow. Hence, we should use ``@`cached_method` on the `__hash__`. We thus use #12601.

Do you agree on using #12601?

A related question: Shouldn't `copy(G)` return `G`, if `G` is immutable? Currently, we have

```
sage: g = graphs.CompleteGraph(400)
sage: gi = Graph(g,data_structure="static_sparse")
sage: copy(gi) is gi
False
```

Moreover, `copy(gi)` takes a lot of time.

I have uploaded a preliminary "patch" (or branch, actually). The existing tests pass.

What it already does:
- If a graph is immutable then the `__copy__` method returns the graph---unless of course optional arguments are passed to the `__copy__` method. This is standard behaviour for immutable things, IIRC.
- If `.weighted(...)` is used to modify an immutable graph, then an error is raised.
- The `__hash__` became a cached method

So far, I am not setting the `._immutable` flag for the immutable graph backend. I did not add tests for the new code. And I did not verify that all "official" methods will be unable to alter an immutable graph (so far, I only fixed `.weighted()`). This shall be done in the next commits.

* About not requiring `allows_multiple_edges` and `allows_loops` to be equal :
  there is actually a technical problem there I just noticed : the
  `get_edge_label` function behaves differently according to the value of
  `allow_multiple_edges()`. It returns either a label, or a list of labels. And
  that complicates things.

  {{{
  sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
  sage: print g.edge_label(0,1)
  None
  sage: g.allow_multiple_edges(True)
  sage: print g.edge_label(0,1)
  [None]
  }}}

  (I hate labels and multiple edges)

  Besides, testing whether the graph containts multiple edges is currently a bit
  costly. I think we actually go over all edges, and test it.

* About `.weighted()` : looks like the meaning of "weighted" is only used in
  `spanning_tree.pyx`. And I'd say that this can easily be replaced by an
  additional argument to the methods (as it is already the case in many others,
  like `flow` of `traveling_salesman_problem`)

* I believe (note sure, never used it) that `.weighted()` only indicates whether
  the labels on the edges are to be understood as weights. That's all. Multiple
  edges are handled by the backend, and each edge can have a different label,
  it's unrelated.

* I don't see any problem with using #12601. Do you see one ?

* `copy(gi)` takes a lot of time : indeed, returning `self` makes sense. If one
  actually wants to copy the immutable copy of the graph, i.e. the underlying C
  data and arrays, this can be made MUCH faster than the current
  implementation. Two calls to `memcpy` and it's settled `:-P`

* Why didn't you use the decorators from your first immutable graph patch to
  deal with immutability in `.weighted()` ?

* If you want to check that current functions act well on immutable graphs, you
  may be interested by the decorator named `_run_it_on_static_instead` in
  `sage.graphs.backends.static_sparse_backend`. It makes the function take the
  graph as input, create an immutable copy of it, and run the code and the
  immutable copy instead. It's still a lot of manual work to do, but it's easier
  than trying the functions hand by hand. Just add the decorator to the graph
  functions you want to test, and run the doctests `;-)`

Sorry for the delay. I moved a lot through Paris with my backpack during the
last days `:-P`

Back at questions on the static graph backend...

In `__eq__`, the following data play a role:
- `.allows_multiple_edges()`
- `.allows_loops()`
- `.order()`
- `.size()`
- `._weighted`
- vertex and edge labels, and of course start and endpoints of the edges.

For immutability, it is thus essential that these methods do not change the answers after applying non-underscore methods.
- `._weighted` may be changed by the `.weighted(new)` method, which I thus made respectful against mutability. So, that is settled.
- The methods mentioned above call the backend, namely: 
  1. `._backend.multiple_edges(None)
  2. `._backend.loops(None)`
  3. `._backend.num_verts()`
  4. `._backend.num_edges(self._directed)`

So, my question boils down to this, Nathann: Is it possible for the static backend that the return value of the above methods 1.--4. changes, if the user is only using non-underscore methods on the graph? If it is not possible, then the `__eq__` classes won't change when using the static graph backend, and I am happy.

The hash only takes into account the tuple of vertices and edges (which includes their labels). You have already confirmed that this is fine with the static backend.

It will probably be fine to keep them in `__eq__`, as they simply ask for the backend's opinion, and the static backend hopefully has no changeable mind.

OK, but removing ".weighted()" from `__eq__` could be done later, I believe.

Nope.

With the decorator, an error would be raised whenever `.weighted()` is called on a mutable graph. However, `.weighted` only mutates the graph if it has an argument. `G.weighted()` will not change `G`, but will only tell whether `G` is weighted or not. I am not using the decorator in order to preserve this behaviour.

I think we need to take care of another detail:

If the static graph backend is used, then `self.delete_vertex(vertex)` and similar mutating methods will result in an error raised by the backend.

However, the problem is that the backend is only called in the very end, after doing damage to attributes that the graph takes care of in addition to the backend:

```python
        if in_order:
            vertex = self.vertices()[vertex]
        if vertex not in self:
            raise RuntimeError("Vertex (%s) not in the graph."%str(vertex))

        attributes_to_update = ('_pos', '_assoc', '_embedding')
        for attr in attributes_to_update:
            if hasattr(self, attr) and getattr(self, attr) is not None:
                getattr(self, attr).pop(vertex, None)
        self._boundary = [v for v in self._boundary if v != vertex]

        self._backend.del_vertex(vertex)
```

Shouldn't this better be

```python
        if in_order:
            vertex = self.vertices()[vertex]
        if vertex not in self:
            raise RuntimeError("Vertex (%s) not in the graph."%str(vertex))

        self._backend.del_vertex(vertex)
        attributes_to_update = ('_pos', '_assoc', '_embedding')
        for attr in attributes_to_update:
            if hasattr(self, attr) and getattr(self, attr) is not None:
                getattr(self, attr).pop(vertex, None)
        self._boundary = [v for v in self._boundary if v != vertex]
```

And these methods have not been written while taking this into account. And all these functions *will* break on immutable graphs.

We already had the experience of "bipartite graphs", a new class of graph that made sure all graphs stayed bipartite. Sometimes, adding an edge would raise an exception because such an edge couldn't be added while keeping the graph bipartite. This class was hell. Making it the default class of `graphs.CompleteBipartiteGraph` would have been hell too.

So please, the named graphs stay mutable for the moment, unless this job is done responsibly.

That's to say, would it be enough to have

The `ValueError` you are mentioning is not part of the `add_vertex` method of the static backend, by the way:

Gosh, I'm going to hate these git dependencies.

Some remarks, though :
- In `.copy()`, you add a line before everything else to handle your case. Couldn't you add a line after the second "if" block, the one after which we know for sure that `data_structure` has been defined, saying "if data_structure == "static_sparse" and hasattr(self,'_immutable')" then return self ? By the way, is an object considered mutable if it HAS a ._immutable variable equal to False ?

- Why wouldn't we add (later) a "immutable" flag to the constructor and to "copy" ? It would be nice to call `Graph(graphs.PetersenGraph(),immutable=True)` ? `O_o`

- What about an exception message for `_hash_` that would give the hint that hashable graphs can be built ? Something like "This graph is mutable, and thus not hashable. To make it mutable, read the doc of Graph.copy."
  I personnally don't mind much, it's more for your crowd... They may think that it can't be done and leave.

Oh. And it's cool, the multiple edges problem and loops are handled by the backend too. Well, thus making graphs immutable looks rather shorter than I first thought `:-)`

Splitting hair...

+1

I am working on it.

> By the way, is an object considered mutable if it HAS a ._immutable variable equal to False ?

Hmm. Would this be possible? I think a graph should be considered immutable if and only if the static backend is used---or rather if and only if *some* static backend is used: Perhaps there will be more static backends in future.

So, instead of relying on an attribute `._immutable` that the user could mess with, one could test for the type of the backend when we need to know whether a graph is immutable.

Problem: If I am not mistaken, people currently *do* mess with the attribute `._immutable`, if I am not mistaken.

Would it be feasible to try to remove the `._immutable` attribute (and testing the type of the backend instead), see how much fails, and fix the failing code by using "proper" immutable graphs?

> - Why wouldn't we add (later) a "immutable" flag to the constructor and to "copy" ?

Would a flag in the "copy" function be supported by Python?

> It would be nice to call `Graph(graphs.PetersenGraph(),immutable=True)` ? `O_o`

Yes. Only problem: We would then need to decide what to do if "immutable=False" and "backend="static_sparse" is simultaneously used.

> - What about an exception message for `_hash_` that would give the hint that hashable graphs can be built ? Something like "This graph is mutable, and thus not hashable. To make it mutable, read the doc of Graph.copy."

OK.

Yes yes indeed, that's what Nicolas told me they did at the moment, and that's what Python uses too know whether it should consider the object as mutable or not. I just wondered if it checked whether the variable existed, or whether the variable was set to True too. 

> Would it be feasible to try to remove the `._immutable` attribute (and testing the type of the backend instead), see how much fails, and fix the failing code by using "proper" immutable graphs?

Hmmmm, I thought that Python really needed this `_immutable` variable somewhere `O_o`

Well not in `.__copy__` but in `.copy()` no problem I guess.

I usually settle this by setting the keywords to "None" by default, instead of True/False. Then if the user manually sets two keywords to contradicting values, either ignore one of the two or scream, as usual. I'll do that in another patch when this one will be reviewed, it will be an easier syntax.

Now we talk about three things. I was talking about Python's (or Sage's?) `copy()` function, which dispatches to `__copy__` or to pickling, depending on what's available. You talk about the `.__copy__()` method, which exists for graphs, and the `.copy()` method, which is set to `__copy__` for graphs.

In any case, I should add a test showing what happens with copies of immutable graphs.

Ahem. Then I guess there are many things in Python that I've never heard of...

From my perspective, this behaviour would be fine. But I also see this:

```
sage: M = matrix([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]])
sage: M.set_immutable()
sage: M.is_immutable()
True
sage: m = copy(M)
sage: m.is_immutable()
False
```

There is one crucial difference, though: A mutable matrix can be made immutable, by `M.set_immutable()`. But a mutable graph can (currently?) not easily be made immutable, since mutability crucially relies on the backend, which is not the case for matrices.

Anyway, I don't think that there is a commonly accepted standard in Sage. Since we have no `G.set_immutable()` method for graphs, I guess it is better to have
- `copy(G)` has the same backend as G. In particular, mutability is copied. And if it is immutable, then we should have `G is copy(G)`.

Yepyep. Making it mutable needs to copy it, so it has to go through .copy or through the constructor.

Oh. I see. Hacks.

Well, that makes sense indeed. Looks like a proof that we shouldn't rely on this `_immutable` flag. Especially when none of us knows who exactly uses it `:-P`

Is there an usual "is_immutable" function in immutable objects ? Perhaps we should do this. This function would check the actual backend, and return its answer accordingly.

This being said, checking the backend does not exactly mean that all other properties of graphs are "protected", like the embedding and everything.

Hmmm...

That's why *both* the flag and the type of the backend are checked before returning "self" as a copy.

Meanwhile I see at what point the copy is taken: It is

```python
    def transitive_reduction(self):
        r"""
        Returns a transitive reduction of a graph. The original graph is
        not modified.

        A transitive reduction H of G has a path from x to y if and only if
        there was a path from x to y in G. Deleting any edge of H destroys
        this property. A transitive reduction is not unique in general. A
        transitive reduction has the same transitive closure as the
        original graph.

        A transitive reduction of a complete graph is a tree. A transitive
        reduction of a tree is itself.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: g=graphs.PathGraph(4)
            sage: g.transitive_reduction()==g
            True
            sage: g=graphs.CompleteGraph(5)
            sage: edges = g.transitive_reduction().edges(); len(edges)
            4
            sage: g=DiGraph({0:[1,2], 1:[2,3,4,5], 2:[4,5]})
            sage: g.transitive_reduction().size()
            5
        """
        from copy import copy
        from sage.rings.infinity import Infinity
        G = copy(self)
        for e in self.edge_iterator():
            # Try deleting the edge, see if we still have a path
            # between the vertices.
            G.delete_edge(e)
            if G.distance(e[0],e[1])==Infinity:
                # oops, we shouldn't have deleted it
                G.add_edge(e)
        return G
```

Hence, it seems that we indeed want a mutable copy here. And perhaps it isn't *their* mess after all, as this method is broken for all truely immutable graphs.
