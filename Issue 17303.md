With this code, Sage can compute the dimension of a Poset.

Turns out that we couldn't.

Concerning the `certificate`, it looks like a half-certificate ; is the algorithm able to provide an evidence that no smaller set of linear ordering can generate the poset by intersection ?

Also, the "just to be sure" section at the end of the code should be run only if some `check` option is set to `True` since the algorithm is supposed to work without this ?

By the way, in the `INPUT` section, it seems more common to write ```certificate`` - boolean (default: ``False``)` than to write the default at the end of the description (i first thought the information was missing).

There seems to be no check for argument, i.e. `certificate='cat-says-meow'` does not raise an error. Should it?

Does this work with empty poset? Checking just now, but compiling is slooow with this machine.

It seems that you get a smaller ILP; you run your acyclicity test and compute cycles just as you do, but only leave critical pairs there (i.e. you take the subhypergraph induced on the critical pairs --- the edges get intersected with the subset of critical pairs).

> There seems to be no check for argument, i.e. `certificate='cat-says-meow'` does not raise an error. Should it?

I do not think that there should, especially when the argument is boolean (not even a string) and when it does not produce any bug whatever happens. Chekking this kind of stuff is useful when a string is expected, but really if we begin to check every single arguments of every function like that, then half of the python code we have in Sage will be checking the type of input because Python does not do it instead.

Done

Done (Jori: we have a 4h30 difference in our timezones)

For me

sage: P.dimension()
