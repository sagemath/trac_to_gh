For the given expression

```
sage: integral(sqrt(x-1)*sqrt(1/x-1/4))
integrate(sqrt(x - 1)*sqrt(1/x - 1/4), x, 0, 5)
```

it is giving output

```
1/2*integrate(sqrt(x - 1)*sqrt(4/x - 1), x, 0, 5)
```

but sqrt(x-1) is not defined for x < 1, also sqrt(1/x-1/4) is not defined for x > 4 

and it is not evaluating the given expression.

What would you expect when feeding Sage this input?

There are ways to make sense of the integral
if we understand `sqrt` as taking complex values.

Maxima, Giac, and Sympy can't do the integral, so there doesn't seem to be anything for sagemath to do differently. I think we should close this ticket as invalid.
