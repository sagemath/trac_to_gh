# Issue 29016: integral function is not working properly

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29253

Original creator: @Karn-Tiwari-3003

Original creation time: 2020-02-27 17:03:22

For the given expression

```
sage: integral(sqrt(x-1)*sqrt(1/x-1/4))
integrate(sqrt(x - 1)*sqrt(1/x - 1/4), x, 0, 5)
```

it is giving output

```
1/2*integrate(sqrt(x - 1)*sqrt(4/x - 1), x, 0, 5)
```

but sqrt(x-1) is not defined for x < 1, also sqrt(1/x-1/4) is not defined for x > 4 

and it is not evaluating the given expression.

Moving tickets to milestone sage-9.2 based on a review of last modification date, branch status, and severity.

Changing keywords from "" to "integral".

What would you expect when feeding Sage this input?

There are ways to make sense of the integral
if we understand `sqrt` as taking complex values.

Moving to 9.4, as 9.3 has been released.

Maxima, Giac, and Sympy can't do the integral, so there doesn't seem to be anything for sagemath to do differently. I think we should close this ticket as invalid.
