Just noticed something in `parametric_surface.pyx`: 

- the first `.. PLOT::` is ill-placed: it should be located immediately after `show(P)`
- the second `.. PLOT::` is immediately followed by `./`, which looks like a typo; indeed this `.. PLOT::` directive is not effective: no image of the Moebius strip is generated in the doc.

Thanks for the correction and for your work on this!

Note that 3d plots in the html documentation will be soon based on `threejs` and no longer on `jmol`, see #33507.

I'm sorry. I do not understand the implications on this. Will I need to use other directive than `.. PLOT`?

For the moment, the `.. PLOT` sections are still there and generate static `jmol` images; there are simply new sections `.. ONLY:: html`, which generate `threejs` plots on demand, see
