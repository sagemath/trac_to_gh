Just noticed something in `parametric_surface.pyx`: 

- the first `.. PLOT::` is ill-placed: it should be located immediately after `show(P)`
- the second `.. PLOT::` is immediately followed by `./`, which looks like a typo; indeed this `.. PLOT::` directive is not effective: no image of the Moebius strip is generated in the doc.

I'm sorry. I do not understand the implications on this. Will I need to use other directive than `.. PLOT`?
