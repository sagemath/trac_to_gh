Sage's mathematical audience has long been plagued by the terrifying ambiguity of the recklessly named `if` keyword we've inherited from Python in an unfortunate series of events.

Here's an example of what I mean:

```python
if 0 == 1:
    set_computer_on_fire()
```


Apparently, there exist plenty of programmers who foolishly assume this code snippet to be completely harmless, arguing that the `if` branch will never be taken.

But can we be so sure? Nothing about this syntax even *suggests* that the `set_computer_on_fire()` call cannot occur *despite* the premise of the `if` being false; after all, `A ⇒ B` is widely known not to imply `¬A ⇒ ¬B`.

The good news is that we can easily fix this shortcoming and finally clarify the exact semantics of conditional branching in Sage by making use of the existing preparsing infrastructure.

Thus, without further ado, here's the same example as above, but after my patch:

```python
if and only if 0 == 1:
    set_computer_on_fire()
```


For users who prefer something less verbose, the shorthand `iff` is also supported:

```python
iff 0 == 1:
    set_computer_on_fire()
```


Moreover, we deprecate the support of `if` to prevent any further confusion caused by this design flaw.

We would need to take care of Python's conditional expression as well. Perhaps

```
a = 4a+1 only when a%1 !=0 and a//2 otherwise
```

Python has recently acquired a more powerful parser that can probably handle this. We'd have to carefully balance the binding affinity of the `otherwise` postfix part with the precedence of the `and` infix operator, though.

As there might be no confusion with tuples, and since some PEP8-addict reviewers are typographically pretty picky, we could accept the use of `if, and only if,`, which would allow:


```
if, and only if, 0 == 1:
    set_computer_on_fire()
otherwise:
    set_computer_on_ice()
```


Such an enhancement could be part of a follow-up ticket.

Hmmmm...

What would happen if we implemented (at least !) Maxima's thee-valued logic `true`, `false`, `unknown`), shouldn't `iff` treat `unknown` in a way different from `if`'s ?

If so, which ?
