Looks good.  One question: do you really want to say "try *random* polynomials in lexicographic order" in the docstring?!

Done.
Now we should make it so this is as fast as Magma's implementation.
I think refactoring the finite field poly factorization code and make it use NTL/PARI/FLINT code should be enough.
