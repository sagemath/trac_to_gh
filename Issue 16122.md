This is the default behavior in Magma.

Changing keywords from "" to "finite fields magma irreducible".

Maybe the non-prime case needs some thought.

Looks good.  One question: do you really want to say "try _random_ polynomials in lexicographic order" in the docstring?!

Nope.
Correcting that now.

Done.
Now we should make it so this is as fast as Magma's implementation.
I think refactoring the finite field poly factorization code and make it use NTL/PARI/FLINT code should be enough.
