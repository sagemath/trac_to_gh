Reported by Nicolas Privault via Rado Kirov:

```
sage: integrate(x^(0.5)*e^(-x-x^2),x,0,infinity).n()
0.886226925452758

sage: integrate(x^(1/2)*e^(-x-x^2),x,0,infinity).n()
0.32015709036013135

which give two different results, and the second one is correct.

The other thing was correct, I believe, so I'm not sure what the poster thought was wrong with it.
