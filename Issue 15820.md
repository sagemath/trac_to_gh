# Issue 15820: Fix multiplicity of nodes in Kleber tree

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16057

Original creator: tscrim

The formula should read:

```
p_i^{(a)} = ( \alpha_a | \lambda^{(i)} ) - \sum_{j > i} \max(j - i, 0) L_j^{(a)}.
```

The old formula caused the multiplicities to become too large.

It's faster to do it this way:

```
sage: B = [[1,2]]*50
sage: %timeit for (r,s) in B: r,s
100000 loops, best of 3: 6.61 µs per loop
sage: %timeit for b in B: b[0], b[1]
10000 loops, best of 3: 22.4 µs per loop
```
