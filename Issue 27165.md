# Issue 27165: remove the doctest flag "optional - gmpy2"

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27402

Original creator: vdelecroix

Original creation time: 2019-03-03 10:04:32

CC:  vklein

#23024 made `gmpy2` a standard package but there are still some doctest flags in `src/sage/arith/misc.py` and `src/sage/structure/coerce.pyx`. The presence of these flags imply that the corresponding tests are not run.
