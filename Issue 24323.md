Well, a=m*n+1 and b=n in the case of interest here

Oops, I derped. Looks good. But:

* In the class doc of `GeneralizedTamariLattice`, I'd replace `a \geq b \times m` by `a \geq bm`. The \times is misleading, as it makes me think of a rectangle.

* Is the lattice property of a `GeneralizedTamariLattice` still a conjecture?

ok

Well, I think so.

Actually, it seems to follow from https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.3787.pdf , Theorem 1, doesn't it? (Where v is the Christoffel path, i.e., the (a,b)-Dyck path that keeps closest to the diagonal.)

Of course, the m-Tamari lattices themselves are known to be lattices.

In general no, and this is more subtle. In this sage procedure, the generalisation goes beyond that of Preville-Ratelle and Viennot, because shape and slope become independant parameters.

Ah, they aren't corner-to-corner paths...
