Adding the global functions (1) causes some unfortunate clashes (`bounding_box` example in #22705)
and (2) puts a lot of useless member functions in the tab completion of every object.

I assume the decision to add these global functions was done to allow for this:

```
sage: M = polymake.new_object("Matrix", [[1, 2], [3, 4]])
sage: M.det()
-2
```

which is not possible in polymake itself, which requires us to use a global function:

```
sage: polymake.det(M)
-2
```


This convenience, however, probably does not justify adding hundreds of monstrosities such as 
`M.bipyramid`, `M.containing_outer_cone` to the tab completion of every object.
