# Issue 15971: Make Sage (6.1.1/6.2.beta*) build with GCC 4.9

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16208

Original creator: leif

Keywords: PPL ptrdiff_t Lcalc default parameters error C++

[GCC 4.9.0](http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.9/) has been released on April 22nd 2014.

Due to stricter conformance to the C++ standard, both the current stable release of Sage, 6.1.1, and the current development release, 6.2.beta8, won't build with GCC 4.9.

Luckily only two Sage packages, namely Lcalc (1.23) and PPL (1.1), are affected, and small patches which don't change any functionality are sufficient to let Sage build with the new GCC.  (The same patch(es) apply to both Sage 6.1.1 and 6.2.beta8.)

Haven't [yet] updated the corresponding `SPKG.txt` files though (listing/documenting the patches).

Looks good to me, are you going to document the patches?

Just adding the filenames to the list of patches?  (There's not much more to say, other than probably referencing this ticket.)

Ah, thanks.  I of course forgot to update the `SPKG.txt` files.

(Although I don't like removing the old changelogs from these; they often provided valuable information, and it's a bit tedious to restore them.  The commit messages in contrast -- if at all available -- frequently don't tell much, many not even a ticket number or the corresponding patch level of an spkg.)
