If PARI doesn't care so much about the difference between a polynomial and a series (I don't really know how PARI deals with these things), then LGTM and you can set a positive review.

Thanks.  In PARI, polynomials and power series can be mixed easily, just like in Sage polynomial rings coerce into power series rings.  In fact, power series with infinite precision are implemented in #15601 using PARI polynomials.

Thank you for the explanation. That is what I was thinking, but it is good to have confirmation.
