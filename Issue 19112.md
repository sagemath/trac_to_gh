Its still a magic string. If somebody were to change the magic value to

```
fastest_mirror = "http:// fastest mirror"
```

then the program doesn't work any more. Fragile and difficult to follow.

The usual pattern is to throw exceptions that have the error message and catch them at the outermost level. Without relying on any local variable being in scope at the exception handler. But its an improvement, at least.
