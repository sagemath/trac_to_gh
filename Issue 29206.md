From 1.2.0 to 1.2.3, there shouldn't be any issues. The ticket for dealing with issues in 1.4+ is already in so I would be surprised if there was any new problems.

The build error on `fedora-32-standard` (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/557675394) is due to GCC 10; https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/11611.

In case this could be merged before 9.1.

Shall we set this to blocker, since 9.1 will be the last version supporting Python 2 ?

Changing priority from major to blocker.

Volker, this only makes sense to merge in 9.1 - for 9.2 we should go to a newer Python3-only version.

I would support this to increase the expected shelf life of 9.1
