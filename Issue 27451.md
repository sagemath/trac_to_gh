CC:  @kiwifb @slel

In `src/sage/matrix/matrix1.pyx`, the `matrix_from_columns()` method has the following pieces:

```
        if not isinstance(columns, (list, tuple)):
            columns = list(columns)

        ...

        ncols = PyList_GET_SIZE(columns)
```

Note how `PyList_GET_SIZE` may be called on a `tuple`. This is invalid and causes assertion failures with Python 3.7.
