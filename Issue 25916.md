This line in `sage-spkg`

```
$SAGE_SUDO mv "$PREFIX/$filename" "${SAGE_LOCAL%/}/$filename"
```

might move a file `$filename` (to be installed) into a *directory* `$filename` (if the latter was an existing directory).

This is partially responsible for #26152.

Or, it seems, a symlink pointing to a directory.  That's the real problem.

It's not really "fixed" by #26011 in the sense that the condition now becomes a hard error (after #26642), failing the installation. Ideally, it should *overwrite* any existing directories.

That being said, I think that you can only do so much with simple shell scripts. Anything more complicated should really be done in Python.
