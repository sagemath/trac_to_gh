CC:  @embray

This line in `sage-spkg`

```
$SAGE_SUDO mv "$PREFIX/$filename" "${SAGE_LOCAL%/}/$filename"
```
might move a file `$filename` (to be installed) into a *directory* `$filename` (if the latter was an existing directory).

This is partially responsible for #26152.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/26153

Or, it seems, a symlink pointing to a directory.  That's the real problem.

It would.  The problem here was that I was manually calling `mv` on each file one-by-one, which in its own right is a bit slow when you have lots of files to move.  But there are some unfortunate subtleties to `mv`, especially when symlinks are involved, that were not taken into account (see the problem Jeroen described in this ticket).  #26011 would replace N `mv` calls with a single `cp -r` of the entire directory tree, which AFAICT handles cases like symlinks well too.  

In #26011 Jeroen raised some valid concerns about that approach which I attempted to answer, but I admit I don't know what the best play is here (though most online resources I've scoured really do seem to suggest that using `cp` is the most robust approach in most cases, even if that means needless copying of data.  But I'm definitely up for other approaches if they can be suggested...

It's not really "fixed" by #26011 in the sense that the condition now becomes a hard error (after #26642), failing the installation. Ideally, it should *overwrite* any existing directories.

That being said, I think that you can only do so much with simple shell scripts. Anything more complicated should really be done in Python.
