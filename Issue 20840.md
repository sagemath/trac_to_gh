With coxeter3 installed

```
sage: W = CoxeterGroup(['B', 3], implementation='coxeter3')
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
.../coxeter3/coxeter.pyx in sage.libs.coxeter3.coxeter.CoxGroup.__cinit__ (.../cythonized/sage/libs/coxeter3/coxeter.cpp:3329)()
    266
    267         if len(cartan_type) == 2:
--> 268             type, rank = cartan_type
    269         else:
    270             type, rank, affine = cartan_type
ValueError: too many values to unpack (expected 2)
```

And indeed

```
sage: c = CartanType('B3')
sage: len(c)
2
sage: len(list(c))
3
```


This causes **many** doctest failures.

This is caused by #20973 and is independent of coxeter3. I will post a fix shortly.

The problem is that there is an `affine` method for finite Cartan types that returns the corresponding affine type, whereas for affine types, the twist number is in the attribute `affine`. We already override `__getitem__` for affine Cartan types, so we just default to 2 valid indices for the general `__getitem__`.
