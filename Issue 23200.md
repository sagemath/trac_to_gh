The following results in an unending loop:

```
sage: M = matroids.named_matroids.Fano().dual()
sage: print list(M.bases())
sage: save(M, "fanodual.sobj")
```

followed by

```
sage: N = load("fanodual.sobj")
sage: N.is_isomorphic(matroids.named_matroids.Fano().dual())
```


My guess is that ``N`` thinks some invariant has been computed, when it really hasn't been computed. You need to do something with ``M`` before saving to trigger the behavior.

I think your guess is probably correct because when you get the bases of the new object (or do not construct them for the old object), then this works.

```
sage: M = matroids.named_matroids.Fano().dual()
sage: _ = list(M.bases())
sage: Mp = loads(dumps(M))
sage: _ = list(Mp.bases())
sage: Mp.is_isomorphic(M)
True
```


```
sage: M = matroids.named_matroids.Fano().dual()
sage: Mp = loads(dumps(M))
sage: Mp.is_isomorphic(M)
True
sage: Mp is M
False
```

Also, if you look at the pickling data, there is a difference

```
sage: M = matroids.named_matroids.Fano().dual()
sage: explain_pickle(dumps(M))
pg_unpickle_binary_matroid = unpickle_global('sage.matroids.unpickling', 'unpickle_binary_matroid')
pg_unpickle_binary_matrix = unpickle_global('sage.matroids.unpickling', 'unpickle_binary_matrix')
pg_unpickle_binary_matroid(0r,
 (pg_unpickle_binary_matrix(0r, (4r, 7r, 0r, long(7), 1r, 8r, [(long(97),), (long(82),), (long(52),), (long(120),)])),
 ['d', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'a', 'b', 'c'],
 ['d', 'e', 'f', 'g'],
 None))
sage: _ = list(M.bases())
sage: explain_pickle(dumps(M))
pg_unpickle_binary_matroid = unpickle_global('sage.matroids.unpickling', 'unpickle_binary_matroid')
pg_unpickle_binary_matrix = unpickle_global('sage.matroids.unpickling', 'unpickle_binary_matrix')
pg_unpickle_binary_matroid(0r,
 (pg_unpickle_binary_matrix(0r, (4r, 7r, 0r, long(7), 1r, 8r, [(long(42),), (long(120),), (long(25),), (long(52),)])),
 ['e', 'c', 'd', 'f', 'g', 'a', 'b'],
 ['e', 'c', 'd', 'f'],
 None))
```


I simplified the example to get the code to fail.

Hey all!  I managed to hunt down the problem here; I'll get the patch up shortly.

The issue is in the method `BinaryMatroid.__reduce__`.  Here's another interesting failure mode:


```python
sage: M = matroids.named_matroids.Fano().dual()
sage: _ = list(M.bases())
sage: N = loads(dumps(M))
sage: N.closure(frozenset({'d'})) # !
frozenset({'e'})
```


The code in `__reduce__` produces a pickled data object which includes a binary matrix representation of the matroid in question, and also a list of the elements in the *current* basis, in the sense of the algorithms of class `BasisExchangeMatroid`.  The problem stems from the following note in the documentation of `BinaryMatroid.__init__`:


```
The extra argument ``basis``, when provided, is an ordered list of
elements of the groundset, ordered such that they index a standard
identity matrix within ``matrix``.
```


The code which is problematic is the following, at lines 3951 to 3960 in `linear_matroid.pyx`:


```python
if self._representation is not None:
    A = self._representation
    gs = self._E
    basis = None
else:
    A = self._A
    for e in self.basis():
        basis[self._prow[self._idx[e]]] = e
    rows, cols = self._current_rows_cols()
    gs = rows + cols
```


When an explicit representation of a matroid hasn't been generated, the existing code in `__reduce__` produces an ordering of the matroid groundset and current basis which are not consistent with this requirement.  The call to `self._current_rows_cols` sets `rows` to the ordered list of groundset elements corresponding to the current basis, ordered as required by the note above so that they index an identity submatrix of the current matrix `self._A`.  The `for` loop above this effectively recomputes the ordering of `self.basis()` (a similar loop is used in the implementation of `_current_rows_cols`), so the resulting return data is an ordered groundset and basis for which the basis is a prefix.

However, the matrix `self._A` is not necessarily reduced so that the left-most square submatrix is an identity matrix -- the elements of the current basis may be distributed in a different order and on different column indices.  This results in an improperly initialized `BinaryMatroid` object, which results in all kinds of bad behavior, including the unending loop noted in the ticket description.  The correct data to include for pickling is the basis (in appropriate order to correspond with consecutive standard basis vectors in the matrix) and the *current* groundset ordering, given by `self._E`, which gives the correct correspondence between the elements listed in `basis` and the columns of the matrix `self._A`.

These assumptions and the corresponding issue in the `__reduce__` method are also found in the `TernaryMatroid` and `QuaternaryMatroid` classes, so I've updated the corresponding code in these classes as well.  I didn't find specific examples where unpickling causes issues for these two classes, but I didn't search too hard; the problem would show up in examples where a lot of manipulations have been done to the matroid being pickled/unpickled, changing the underlying matrix by row-reduction into a form for which the basis columns are scattered and out of order in the matrix.

It is great that you were able to track down the problem (I am not sure I completely understand the issue in full technicality, but I just need to reread what you wrote more carefully). I do have a few little fixes, but otherwise your branch is good.

- Instead of `\\times`, it would be better to do `r"""` at the beginning of the docstring.
- `TESTS::` -> `TESTS:` since you have text after (not code).
- Similarly `From :trac:`23437` and comments:` -> `Check that :trac:`23437` is fixed::`.
- Do `basis = self._current_rows_cols()[0]` as you just need the 1st output; better to not have a `_` variable.
- Similarly _ = list(M.bases())` -> `B = list(M.bases())`.
- I would probably add the example in the ticket description to the other `__reduce__` methods changed (but with an appropriate matroid to test them).

Great, I'll make the changes and push the updated branch in a bit.  Just for my understanding, what's the advantage of avoiding `_` variable assignment?

Also, managed to find appropriate corresponding bugs/tests for the `TernaryMatroid` and `QuaternaryMatroid` cases; for reference:


```python
sage: from sage.matroids.advanced import TernaryMatroid
sage: X_bin = matroids.named_matroids.Fano().representation()
sage: X = Matrix(GF(3, 'x'), X_bin)
sage: M = TernaryMatroid(matrix=X).dual()
sage: B = list(M.bases())
sage: N = loads(dumps(M))
sage: N.closure(frozenset({3}))
frozenset({4})
sage: N.is_isomorphic(M)
```


and


```python
sage: from sage.matroids.advanced import QuaternaryMatroid
sage: X_bin = matroids.named_matroids.Fano().representation()
sage: X = Matrix(GF(4, 'x'), X_bin)
sage: M = QuaternaryMatroid(matrix=X).dual()
sage: B = list(M.bases())
sage: N = loads(dumps(M))
sage: N.closure(frozenset({3}))
frozenset({4})
sage: N.is_isomorphic(M)
```

both hang on the current development branch, but are fixed by the patch.

It is not really a good variable name, even if it is for something to be discarded. I think it might also not be valid or considered as evil on Python3.
