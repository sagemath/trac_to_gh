# Issue 28918: Full-dimensional face of Polyhedron should have equations

Keywords: polytopes, universe face, equations

Currently in a Polyhedron with lines, the full-dimensional face is initialized without equations:


```
A 2-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in ZZ^3 defined as the convex hull of 6 vertices
sage: P = polytopes.permutahedron(3)
sage: [f] = P.face_generator(2)
sage: f
A 2-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in ZZ^3 defined as the convex hull of 6 vertices
sage: f.ambient_Hrepresentation()
()
```


This is a bug from #28646 (probably introduced there). We fix this:


```
sage: P = polytopes.permutahedron(3)
sage: [f] = P.face_generator(2)
sage: f.ambient_Hrepresentation()
(An equation (1, 1, 1) x - 6 == 0,)
```
