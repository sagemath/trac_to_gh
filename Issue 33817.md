Keywords: gsoc2022 documentation family

The current documentation implies that the index set must be finite. This is not the case:


```
sage: F = Family(ZZ)
sage: type(F)
<class 'sage.sets.family.EnumeratedFamily_with_category'>
```

I am not sure the documentation is wrong, but it might be a slight abuse of notation. In particular `|ZZ|` is aleph<sub>0</sub>, and aleph<sub>0</sub> - 1 = aleph<sub>0</sub> (well, this might make slightly more sense in terms of ordinals rather than cardinals). So it is saying it is indexed by `{0, 1, ...}`.

Now your change definitely is wrong because it is not indexed by **Z** but by **N** (with 0) in the infinite case. Don't let this run for too long:

```
sage: F = Family(ZZ)
sage: F[-1]
```

as the generic `unrank()` from the category doesn't protect against bad input (for infinite enuemrated sets, IMO, it should).

I know that this is not from your ticket, but this:

```
             counter = 0
             for u in self:
                 if counter == r:
                     return u
                 counter += 1
