Check documentation of functions like `is_less_than()`.

This continues the serie of #18925, #18941, #18959 and #19141.

Kevin, what you think about "Relations are also often called intervals."? I would say that every comparable element pair _defines_ an interval, not that it _is_ an interval. Actually the name of `intervals()`/`relations()` could be `comparable_pairs()`, or even not-yet-implemented `chains(size=2)`. But maybe that would go too far.

But should we deprecate `intervals`, as it does not return intervals but a pairs of elements?

I thought I responded to this, but maybe this was the response I had typed out just after my free 30 minute wifi session at O'Hare expired...

I don't think relations are often (or ever) called intervals. So deprecate that, but maybe add a docstring comment to `relations()` indicating that the number of relations is the number of intervals, and is thus the dimension of the incidence algebra. 

Not especially a fan of `comparable_pairs()`, just because technically speaking pairs are unordered, and we care about the order of the pair. I also don't think `chains(size=2)` would be a good option, either.

The way that I think of posets (and the way the poset constructor thinks of them) is that you have data of a ground set and relations, and how all of that data interacts makes a poset structure. Things like chains and intervals are properties of the entire poset structure, whereas relations are an individual piece of the defining data.

What should I do to `interval`? Now it is de facto alias to `closed_interval` (or to other way), but technically a function.

I guess this can be reviewed as it is.

Different question is that should `open_interval(x, y)` and `open_interval(y, x)` return just same elements.

I don't think `open_interval(x,y)` and `open_interval(y,x)` should always return the same thing.

Looks good.

Thank you! Now this is starting to look quite good.
