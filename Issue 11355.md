To test this, use `./sage -docbuild reference html` and make sure all looks right in the 3d plotting area.  Let me know if there is a problem with the formatting.

Looks okay except that the revolution_plot3d page has a missing title, because the py file doesn't have a docstring at the top.  I'm adding this in a new patch, along with a "delta" patch so you can see the difference.  If you're happy with my changes, please switch to "positive review".
