As a very inexperienced person in this field I found it very difficult from the existing docs to understand the difference in syntax between the python and sage functions "minimize" - and I imagine this applies to other function handles as well: though I will need some guidance as to which function specs I need to amend.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14493

```

assuming that this ticket is for documentation only (not for the feature itself), i find that the docstring is currently well and clear in this respect. 

this is because it says:

```
    INPUT:

    - ``func`` -- Either a symbolic function or a Python function whose
      argument is a tuple with `n` components
```

for this reason i suggest to either close this ticket, or to add an extra note:

```
- If you use a Python function, the argument must be a tuple with `n` components, e.g. 
``def func(x): return sin(x[0]) + cos(x[1])`` instead of ``def func(x,y): return sin(x) + cos(y)``.
```

The latter seems good, because I wouldn't have figured out that syntax from no example.
