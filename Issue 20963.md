# Issue 20963: unbound the lazy_list formatter

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: dkrenn

Original creation time: 2016-08-10 10:58:26

In #21164, a string formatter for lazy lists was introduced in the class `lazy_list_generic`. The aim of this ticket is to unbound this method, so that one is able to use it outside lazy lists as well.

This will become handy when using it in conjunction with k-regular sequences (no ticket yet) and probably other sequences as well.

Simplifed the requirements needed for the input. (Now `L` needs only to be iterable.)

Instead of `'{!r}'.format(e)` you could use the more direct `repr(e)`.

Why don't you encode the default argument in the function

```
def lazy_list_formatter(L, name='lazy list', separator=', ', more='...',
        opening_delimiter='[', closing_delimiter=']',
        preview=3):

```

Indeed. Changed.

I see that this change makes the code much clearer; thus changed.
