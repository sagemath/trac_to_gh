# Issue 22465: polymake interface: Bug in interrupt handling - expect_list

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22702

In `polymake.py`, `Polymake._keyboard_interrupt passes` a bad first argument in the line

```
i = self._expect.expect_list(self._prompt, timeout=1)
```


This leads to:


```
/Users/mkoeppe/s/sage/sage-rebasing/another-local-sans-autotools/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/interfaces/polymake.pyc in _eval_line(self, line, allow_use_file, wait_for_prompt, restart_if_needed, **kwds)

I do not know how to reproduce this consistently. It involves pressing C-c at the right moment.

There is no `polymake.py` in Sage. You must be running code from some other branch. Set that other branch to needs_work if there are issues.

No, I want this to be a follow up ticket.
The original ticket is good enough for production work already.

Changing keywords from "" to "polymake".
