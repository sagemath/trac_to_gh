As raised [here](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/41910/viewer-3d-problem/#) and I believe elsewhere as well, viewing threejs plots does not work on Windows if "offline" scripts are used (i.e. the scripts included in Sage) since the correct Windows-style paths are not output to the HTML template.

It would be nice to get this fixed ASAP, but it should have a workaround in the form of using the "online" scripts, in which case the scripts are downloaded over the internet.
