We wish to support all combinations of the following scenarios:

1. Running `notebook` installed in `SAGE_LOCAL` from SPKG

2. Running `notebook` installed in the system python, or in some venv unrelated to Sage

3. Running `notebook` on a different host (which has no Sage installation), connecting to the Sage Jupyter kernel

A. Sage-the-distribution

B. Distribution packaging of Sage (Debian, Conda, ...)

C. Pip-installed sagelib (#30036)
