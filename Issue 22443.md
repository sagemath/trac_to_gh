We now have several programs (e.g. Gap, Maxima) which have both pexpect and some sort of library-ish interface.  As a user said, 
> How do I go about ensuring that the web documentation for the "pexpect" interface at least includes a pointer to the "libgap" interface? I was not at all aware of the latter, and it appears to pretty much majorize the former in all respects. I can understand that there may be reasons not to retire the "pexpect" interface, but it would be good to point "newbie" users (like me) to the very-likely-to-be-superior libgap interface.

So we should be sure to have documentation that points people to that in these cases.  

Separately (though perhaps still on this ticket, if you disagree open a new one and link to this one) we may wish to convert some older documentation, particularly in tutorials, to use library interfaces.  For instance, which interface do http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/tutorial/interfaces.html#maxima or http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/tutorial/interfaces.html#gap use?
