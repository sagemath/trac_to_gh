Keywords: python3

The Py2 builtin function `reduce()` is available in Py3 as `functools.reduce()`.

The tool 2to3 adds `from functools import reduce`.


But the code has to depend on the Python version!

There are 24 effected modules. 

This ticket is tracked as a dependency of meta-ticket ticket:16052.

I didn't realize that `from functools import reduce` is already possible since Python 2.6 (see the changed description).

All test passed `./sage -tp 4 --all --long >logs/sage-tp4-all-long-16078.log`.

But I think it would be better (see also PEP8) to do the imports only once at the top of teach module. For 24 modules this could be generated by `2to3` - the 3 `.pyx` and the 1 doctest case go extra.
