Changing keywords from "permutation, descent composition" to "permutation, descent composition, FindStat".

Please change one thing and I can set to positive review.  You write
...`descent, see :trac:14864::`... and I think it should read ...`descent, see :trac:`14864`:`...

I was thinking about it and It is probably just easier to erase the reference since it is not like the trac ticket contains more information about why this should be the base case.

Hey Christian,

Could you rebase this over #14808?

Thanks,

Travis

Hi Travis, it looks like this bug was already fixed in #14808, am I right? Then please set this ticket to duplicate.
