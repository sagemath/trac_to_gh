# Issue 21692: make "tightpage" the default behavior for view

When invoking the `view` command, it produces a large pdf. It might be nicer to have a smaller page by default. This amounts to setting the default of `tightpage` to `true`.

I would like to remove the many occurrences of `tightpage=True` in various files to reflect the new defaults.

Hi Moritz,

Did you make a circular search do look for all instances of "tightpage=(T)true"?

Hi Moritz,

Could you also adapt the text in the documentation of view concerning the option "tightpage" so that it makes sense with the updated default value. For example, say what it does when it is set to "False".

I searched for all instances of `tightpage=True` and hopefully didn't miss any.

The last commit addresses the changes in the documentation you suggest.

Great! All test passed.

I would like to have a second opinion. Nicolas, anything to say about the patch?

This looks good for a positive review on my part.

Dear Moritz,

I did a pep8 check on latex.py. Could you remove the "blanklines containing whitespaces" and "trailing whitespaces" in line 2101 and 2103, 2118 of latex.py.

For the record: we made a quick poll here at Sage Days 79, and everybody who cared voted to make `tightpage=True` the default.
