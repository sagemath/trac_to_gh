# Issue 15161: wrong output of %timeit

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: zimmerma

Original creation time: 2013-11-11 20:05:29


```
sage: R=RealField(1000000)
sage: a=R(1/sqrt(3))
sage: %timeit a.arcsin()
1 loops, best of 3: 7.26 s per loop
```

It should be either `3 loops, best of 3` or `1 loop, best of 1`.

can someone tell me why this particular test pyflakes failing. It says time imported but not used but that is not the part of modified lines.

as explained in the link on top of the patchbot report,

(https://wiki.sagemath.org/plugins#pyflakes)

pyflakes checks the modified files.

not necessarily, only if you can check that this removal does not break anything. It could be that "time" is imported from this file by another file, who knows..
