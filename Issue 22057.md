# Issue 22057: Installation guide should say that you can't move the Sage installation

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22294

Original creator: jhpalmieri

Original creation time: 2017-02-02 22:46:52

You can't move the main Sage directory without breaking Sage, but the installation guide currently says that you can. We should fix the documentation.
