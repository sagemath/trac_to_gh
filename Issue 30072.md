`FreeModule` and `CombinatorialFreeModule` elements support methods `monomials`, `coefficients`, `monomial_coefficients`, and `FreeModule` has the alias `dict` for the latter.

`FiniteRankFreeModule` elements could support these methods too (with an optional `basis` argument), and `Components` as well.
