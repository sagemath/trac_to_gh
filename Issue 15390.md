Err... Right now, the disjoint union of two graphs with multiedges/loops is the disjoint union of those two graphs without loops nor multiple edges. That's clearly missing from the code.

Here is the new behaviour

There is a typo "afinite projective plane"

I propose to replace "No other value is available for this parameter." by

"For the moment, no other value is available for this parameter."

There is a failing doctest about the immutability :

```
sage: (2*g)._backend
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    NotImplementedError: An immutable graph does not change name
```


I suggest also to add a reference to `:trac:`15627``

Ok, good enough for me (even if not fully pep8 or python3)
