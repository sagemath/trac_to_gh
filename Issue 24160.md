# Issue 24160: Expression._convert should not make exact function arguments inexact

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24397

Original creator: rws

Original creation time: 2017-12-17 07:17:23


```
sage: f = function('f')
sage: f(1, 2)._convert(RR)
f(1.00000000000000, 2.00000000000000)
```

This loses information that might be needed by the function. Some functions might even require exact arguments for correct results.

This ticket tracks and doctests the Pynac fix.

We are scratching at the fundamental design decisions here. FP evaluation of expressions is implemented by walking the expression tree depth-first and converting exact and inexact numeric to inexact numeric. The end result is either inexact numeric or an expression containing symbols. This process is inherently fast because only inexact operations are done. We don't want to change it fundamentally.

The bug that sparked this ticket can be resolved differently anyway.

Is there a reference for the upstream bug report and discussion?
