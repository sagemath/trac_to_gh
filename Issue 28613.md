Currently, the polar of rational polyhedra does not check, whether the polyhedron is full-dimensional:


```
sage: P = polytopes.simplex(3, base_ring=QQ)
sage: P.polar()
A 4-dimensional polyhedron in QQ^4 defined as the convex hull of 4 vertices and 1 line
```


We fix this by adding an assertion


```
sage: P = polytopes.simplex(3, base_ring=QQ)
sage: P.polar()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AssertionError: must be full-dimensional
```


We change the other message `"Not a polytope."` according to conventions to `"not a polytope"`.
