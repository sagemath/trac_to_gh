# Issue 14967: Fix gap cyclotomics to sage

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15204

Original creator: tscrim

Original creation time: 2013-09-17 19:20:43

Assignee: tscrim

Current gap expects a particular method of `_n()` which is provided by `CyclotomicField` but not by others, in particular `UniversalCyclotomicField`. Fixes this by catching this exception and converting through the `CyclotomicField`.

Hello Travis :)

Now that we are trusted again, I am afraid there is no longer any patchbot around for the mercurial tickets. At least the only active one (except my own one) seems to work only on git tickets.

I will try to find time to run my patchbot on this ticket. It takes me around 90m per ticket... Maybe you could run a patchbot too ?

Frederic
