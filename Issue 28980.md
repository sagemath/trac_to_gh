Salut Thierry, merci pour les commentaires.

Voici un nouvel essai. J'ai intégré dans "programs" l'extraction des codes, mais pas la vérification. Comme la vérification ne concerne que le code sage, je pense qu'il vaut mieux la garder à part pour le moment. A la limite, je peux l'enlever si tu veux.

Tout cette extraction est rendu bien pénible par l'état de l'OEIS, et par leur refus de créer un champ par langage, qui serait la seule chose logique à faire.

Mon objectif à long terme serait de vérifier automatiquement tout le code sage dans l'OEIS. On en est encore bien loin, mais j'ai déjà trouvé des problèmes, et poussé fort vers la compatibilité avec Python3.

Auto-translate from a non-reliable auto-translator in case it proves useful to some reviewers.  I assume "wise" is "sage" which is pretty darned funny.  No implication should be inferred that Trac comments need to be in English, by the way!

Hi Thierry, thanks for the comments.

Here is a new test. I integrated in "programs" the extraction of the codes, but not the verification. As the verification only concerns the wise code, I think it is better to keep it separate for the moment. Ultimately, I can remove it if you want.

All this extraction is made very painful by the state of the OEIS, and by their refusal to create a field by language, which would be the only logical thing to do.

My long term goal would be to automatically check all of the wise code in the OEIS. We are still far from it, but I have already found problems, and pushed hard towards compatibility with Python3.

In French, we have "sage" for the person and "sauge" for the plant.

Why are you enclosing the FancyTuple into another layer of list for maple and mathematica ? Each entry of the FancyTuple seems to be either a comment or a on-liner program already:


```
sage: s = oeis(45)
sage: s.programs('maple')
[0: A000045 := proc(n) combinat[fibonacci](n); end;
 1: ZL:=[S, {a = Atom, b = Atom, S = Prod(X,Sequence(Prod(X,b))), X = Sequence(b,card >= 1)}, unlabelled]: seq(combstruct[count](ZL, size=n), n=0..38); # _Zerinvary Lajos_, Apr 04 2008
 2: spec := [B, {B=Sequence(Set(Z, card>1))}, unlabeled ]: seq(combstruct[count](spec, size=n), n=1..39); # _Zerinvary Lajos_, Apr 04 2008
 3: # The following Maple command isFib(n) yields true or false depending on whether n is a Fibonacci number or not.
 4: with(combinat): isFib := proc(n) local a: a := proc(n) local j: for j while fibonacci(j) <= n do fibonacci(j) end do: fibonacci(j-1) end proc: evalb(a(n) = n) end proc: # _Emeric Deutsch_, Nov 11 2014]
sage: s.programs('mathematica')

 1: Table[2^n Sqrt @ Product[(Cos[Pi k/(n + 1)]^2 + 1/4), {k, n}] // FullSimplify, {n, 15}]; (* Kasteleyn's formula specialized, Sarah-Marie Belcastro (smbelcas(AT)toroidalsnark.net), Jul 04 2009 *)

 4: CoefficientList[Series[-(x/(-1 + x + x^2)), {x, 0, 20}], x] (* _Eric W. Weisstein_, Sep 22 2017 *)]
```


Also, for other languages, the cutting seems not working:


```
sage: s.programs('python')

 2: for n in range(100): print(str(n) + " " + str(fib(n)))  # _Bruno Berselli_, Dec 06 2016,

  3:     x, y = 0, 1
  4:     while 1:
  5:         yield x
  6:         x, y = y, x+y
  7: f = fib()
  8: a = [next(f) for _ in range(100)]
  9: def A000045(n):
 10:     """ Returns Fibonacci number with index n, offset 0 """
 11:     return a[n]
 12: def A000045_list(N):
 13:     """ Returns a list of the first n Fibonacci numbers """
 14:     return a[:N]]
```

I am not able to cut the maple or mathematica code into pieces, as there is nothing in these fields that separate independant programs, that could very well take several consecutive lines. So I have only "one program" for each. And to be consistent with all other languages, I return a list of one single FancyTuple.

Of course, one can give up coherence, make a special treatment and return one single FancyTuple for these specific languages. Would you prefer to have this very specific behaviour for "maple" and "mathematica" parameters ?
