The optional package `libbraiding` should enable the module `sage.libs.braiding`. But it does not.

To check it, install the package `libbraiding and then try:


```
sage: from sage.libs.braiding import *
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ImportError                               Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-1-d9209c49d9c3> in <module>()
----> 1 from sage.libs.braiding import *

ImportError: No module named braiding

```


I guess the culprit has to do with the `module_list.py` but have been unable to pin it.

I think you need to run `sage -b` afterward installing it. Perhaps that is something we should add to the Sage install file?

Perhaps you just didn't notice it? If you installed both at the same time and then ran `sage -b`, it would fix the issue as well.

I suspect it suffers from the same issue. I have `libhomfly` installed on my copies of Sage, so I can't test it.

Absolutely.  Personally, I don't really consider this a bug. When you run `make libbraiding`, it installs the `libbraiding` package, which is different from the `sage.libs.braiding` Python module.

Better `make sagelib` because that does dependency checking. And you mean to do that after every `sage -i` call? I'm OK with that, I just wanted to verify.

I do feel that this should be discussed on sage-devel first.
