There was a doctest error... the `sage -t --long` is now fine.

And maybe someday it will be useful to display `MOLS_table(10^5)` ;-)

I don't mind. We update those table frequently anyway.

Really, to me this code is a waste of time. We could have set the width to be 4 for everything, and you go to such lengths to handle absurdly high values (which btw ignore that the screen's width is not infinite).

Anyway. Your code is correct and works, if you don't have anything to change here we can change the ticket's status !
