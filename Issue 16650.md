With this patch the MOLS table can be printed for values n>1000 with a correct alignment, and you can also pick an interval of values of n you are interested in.

Hello,

I made the `MOLS_table` size adaptative at `public/16887b`. What do you think?

To me it is being needlessly smart.

There was a doctest error... the `sage -t --long` is now fine.

And maybe someday it will be useful to display `MOLS_table(10^5)` ;-)

For the potential future rebase, it might be better to fold all commits into one because I have just undone all doctest to their previous state. What do you think?

I don't mind. We update those table frequently anyway.

Really, to me this code is a waste of time. We could have set the width to be 4 for everything, and you go to such lengths to handle absurdly high values (which btw ignore that the screen's width is not infinite).

Anyway. Your code is correct and works, if you don't have anything to change here we can change the ticket's status !

Great! The two commits are now one (you are the author ;-) and leads to much less changes.

I don't enjoy much being the "author" of the modifications you made in `MOLS_table`. Well, it doesn't matter `:-P`
