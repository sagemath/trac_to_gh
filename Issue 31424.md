Original creator: culler

Original creation time: 2021-04-11 22:50:00

On https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/index.html there are image links that a user can click to download a PDF file.  The url of the image file is https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/_static/pdf.png

As of April 11, 2021 requesting that image url produces a 404.

Likely fixed in #30418, merged in Sage 9.3.beta1.

The fix will be live when Sage 9.3 is released.

Set to positive review to confirm.
