Straightforward update.

Removed disable_help.patch (which did not apply anymore) as Victor fixed the issue (in a different way).

Not sure if it's because I did not recompiled everything correctly or eclib (interface?) does bad things, but I get a lot of complains/segfault about uninitialized ZZ_p modulus.

In fact eclib does not pass its testsuite anymore.

Ok, it seems it was just an old version of ntl so file lurking around.

So that was why I was scratching my head "but it works in sage-on-gentoo!". The rest looks all right to me and in use for a couple of weeks locally :)  positive.

I am feeling very ashamed that both Jean-Pierre and I missed that. And it was working in 6.0 I am sure. I am fairly sure I ran it in 6.0 when it was included, I thought I ran it this time too and I am also fairly sure the test suite didn't really change that much between 6.0 and 6.1. One of these must be a figment of imagination.
