bot and lights are morally green, so please review (should be easy)

You are not also going to change?

```diff
-        if len(V) != 0 and D[V[0], V[0]] == 0:
+        if V and D[V[0], V[0]] == 0:
```


I find changes like this harder to parse:

```diff
-                B[i:i+2, :] = trafo * B[i:i+2, :]
+                B[i:i + 2, :] = trafo * B[i:i + 2, :]
```

I would apply the PEP8 higher priority operators spacing exception here (e.g., `3 * (x+y)`).

well, undone, but now my text editor complains again about missing spaces.

Thank you. I am sorry about that, but this does make it a lot easier to parse IMO since the spaces are delimiting the inputs. I would apply the same for function arguments, such as `f(x=y + 1, z=y + 2)`. The lack of spacing around the `=` (which is mandated by PEP8 and I also support to distinguish it from assignment `=`) really throws me off.
