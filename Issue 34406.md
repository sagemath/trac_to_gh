You are not also going to change?

```diff
-        if len(V) != 0 and D[V[0], V[0]] == 0:
+        if V and D[V[0], V[0]] == 0:
```


I find changes like this harder to parse:

```diff
-                B[i:i+2, :] = trafo * B[i:i+2, :]
+                B[i:i + 2, :] = trafo * B[i:i + 2, :]
```

I would apply the PEP8 higher priority operators spacing exception here (e.g., `3 * (x+y)`).
