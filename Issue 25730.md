(TBD after currently waiting tickets are merged to `hasse_diagram.py`.)

A lattice can be built from lower pseudo-intervals iff `|Ji(L)| = |Ji (Con L)|`. But we can not have `|Ji(L)| < |Ji (Con L)|`. Hence we can stop when we found two principal congruences to be the same.

```

Rather than using `SetPartition`, it would be better to use lower-level Python objects:

```diff
-S = SetPartition(H.congruence([[v, next(H.neighbor_out_iterator(v))]]))
+S = frozenset(map(frozenset, H.congruence([[v, next(H.neighbor_out_iterator(v))]])))
```

to avoid the overhead, including constructing the parent, all of this is in Python, and the checks of `SetPartition`.

Otherwise LGTM
