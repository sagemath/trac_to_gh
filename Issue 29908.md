Now that we have `EdgesView` for graphs (#27408), we can use `.edges(...)` instead of `.edge_iterator(...)`.  We do the following:
- add missing parameters to method `edges` to have same behavior than `edge_iterator`
- make `edge_iterator` call `edges`
- use `edges` instead of `edge_iterator` in the code
- add deprecation warning in `edge_iterator`
