# Issue 29908: deprecate edge_iterator

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30145

Original creator: dcoudert

Original creation time: 2020-07-14 18:52:33

Now that we have `EdgesView` for graphs (#27408), we can use `.edges(...)` instead of `.edge_iterator(...)`.  We do the following:
- add missing parameters to method `edges` to have same behavior than `edge_iterator`
- make `edge_iterator` call `edges`
- use `edges` instead of `edge_iterator` in the code
- add deprecation warning in `edge_iterator`

I will split that into several smaller tickets. Too hard to make it at once.

After second thought, I don't think anymore it is a good idea to deprecate `edge_iterator`. It avoids some overheads due to `EdgeView` and so is better for internal use.

Therefore, I propose to move this ticket to invalid/wontfix.
