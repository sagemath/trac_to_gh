# Issue 33158: doument using Wolfram Engine (a.k.a. wolramscript) with Sage

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33395

It appears that https://www.wolfram.com/engine-technology/
is basically a freely available for personal use terminal engine.
One has to create a script renaming `wolframengine` to `math`.
Put in your PATH
(or just in `SAGE_LOCAL/bin/math)

```
$ cat local/bin/math
#!/bin/sh
/usr/bin/env wolframscript $@
```

and don't forget

```
$ chmod 755 local/bin/math
```

All tests in `mathematica.py` passed with 9.6b1 on MacOS 11.5.2. Instead of writing a script, I did `ln -s wolframscript math` inside `/usr/local/bin/`.

Changing keywords from "" to "wolfram, mathematica".

What is the full path to `wolframscript` ? Is it `/usr/local/bin/wolframscript` ?

Yes, that is the path.
