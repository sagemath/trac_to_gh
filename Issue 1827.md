this should completely fix the problem.  But I've only tested it on one 32-bit linux system.  it needs more testing

For _an_element_impl, it should return a very generic element. If it returns zero, then it may mess up the coercion model!

Hi Robert,

can you provide a doctest that exposes the issue you describe?

Cheers,

Michael

OK, I take this back. 

It used to be that some multiplication code was written as 


```
def _lmul_(self, other):
    if not other:
        return other
    ...
```


This would succeed when other was ANY type with bool(other) == False, and an_element was used to construct `other` to pass in and try it out (in the action detection code) which would cause it to succeed and this "valid" action would get cached (resulting in a error or segfault when a non-zero `other` was passed. 

It now forces other to be an element of self.parent().base_ring(), which solves this problem.
