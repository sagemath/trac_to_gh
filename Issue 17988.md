Hello Frédéric,

Could we decide something about this Icosidodecahedron thing? My patch at #18775 also contains two graph constructors that I need. Do you know when you will be done with this ticket?

You are free to split it into several tickets.

Quick remark on the code: some of the constructors do not accept `exact`/`base_ring` as arguments. I know that some of them are infinitely slow with `exact=True`. There are already some of them that have default `exact=False` that is fine with me if there is a clear warning.

PS: I have code that improves the generic double description algorithm and makes the constructions reasonable over QQbar... but it needs a bit of cleaning.

Is this code already on a ticket? We'd be quite interested in testing it.

Here is how you can create `phi` and `xi`:

```
sage: Q = QuadraticField(5, 'sqrt5')
sage: sqrt5 = Q.gen()
sage: phi = (1 + sqrt5)/2
sage: R.<x> = Q[]
sage: A = NumberField(x^3 - 2*x - phi, 'xi')
sage: xi = A.gen()
```

You can also use `RDF` for an `exact=False` input.

Edit - Missed one command

Ok, this is a first version, but exact is not working. I guess this might be the same problem as Frédéric had with the snub cube, but I don't know. Constructing the object gives now problem, but calling `f_vector()` gives the wrong result. Also calling `show()` gives the following error message:

Hello again,

There was a small problem in the index code, which I now fixed at #19596.

If used in the library.py file without the fix, two functions are missing: `associahedron` and `flow_polytope`.

We have several ways out (tell me what you prefer):

1) We don't add any index in this ticket, waiting for #19596 to be reviewed

2) We add the index in this ticket, with #19596 as a dependency

3) We add the index in this ticket without #19596 as a dependency, and the two missing elements will appear whenever #19596 will be merged (possibly before the next beta anyway)

Have fun,

Nathann
