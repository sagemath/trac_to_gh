# Issue 12461: Fix doc of attach

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/12633

Original creator: nbruin

`attach?` presently says:

```
     Type ``attached_files()`` for a list of all currently
     attached files. You can remove files from this list to stop them
     from being watched.
```

but that's wrong. One should use `detach`.

Looks good to me.  I ran doctests in the 'misc' and 'server' directories (all successful), the only places I saw references to this stuff.

I think the `detach(...)` string should be replaced by `detach(filename)` so that it is more explicit what the argument of `detach` should be. For instance, detach does not take in lists which I think it should, but that is the context of some other ticket.

Actually it can be written as

```
:meth:`detach()` method
```


As for the other "problems" with detach, I have now opened #12634.

Thanks for taking care of it !

However, there was already a ticket for that (#11303). Please check before creating a ticket.
