Mathematica uses "phased permutations" to express tensor symmetries.

A cycle of length k is labeled with a kth root of unity.

This generalizes the symmetries that `sage.tensor` can currently express, which are products of full symmetric groups (where the transpositions in the antisymmetries are labeled with -1).

this seems to generalise to cyclic groups only, no?

each generator is a cycle...

each generator is a product of cycles, in full generality. Then, I think these things are called monomial groups, "phased" comes from physics people not taking algebra classes :-)

Yes, it's a Wolfram-ism, I think

Would these be a generalization of `ColoredPermutations`, where each element of `{1, ..., n}` can have its own distinct cycle length?

yes, but with some kind of compatibility relation, I guess.

Setting new milestone based on a cursory review of ticket status, priority, and last modification date.
