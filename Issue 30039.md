Mathematica uses "phased permutations" to express tensor symmetries.

A cycle of length k is labeled with a kth root of unity.


http://reference.wolframcloud.com/language/tutorial/TensorSymmetries.html


This generalizes the symmetries that `sage.tensor` can currently express, which are products of full symmetric groups (where the transpositions in the antisymmetries are labeled with -1).

this seems to generalise to cyclic groups only, no?

each generator is a cycle...

Yes, it's a Wolfram-ism, I think

Would these be a generalization of `ColoredPermutations`, where each element of `{1, ..., n}` can have its own distinct cycle length?
