# Issue 15021: The "Brian" optional spkg must be updated for the new git directory layout

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: vbraun

Original creation time: 2013-10-06 21:17:32

The `spkg-install` hardcodes things about the Sage directory tree that were changed. In particular, there is no `newest-version` script any more.

This is necessary for #14962.
