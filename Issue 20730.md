# Issue 20730: Make behavior of charpoly in Rational consistent with other instances of charpoly

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: klui

Original creation time: 2016-07-06 20:48:18

Keywords: rational, charpoly

Currently, charpoly in Rational does not have a default var.

```
sage: a = QQ(2); a.charpoly()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-1-b2bd5f519d4e> in <module>()
----> 1 a = QQ(Integer(2)); a.charpoly()

TypeError: charpoly() takes exactly one argument (0 given)
```


Over other rings, it does have a default var.


```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2-2); a.charpoly()
x^2 - 2
```

<rant>It is so pointless that this is done manually.</rant>
