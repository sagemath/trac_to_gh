This question is slightly orthogonal to the patch, but was the first thing I thought to try.  `:-)`  Should we require an explicit parameter to relabel a graph into loopiness/multiedgeness if it isn't already?  It seems far more likely to be an accident than to be intended, and currently can get a graph into weird states:


```
sage: G = graphs.CubeGraph(3)
sage: G.relabel()
sage: G.vertices(), G.edges()

Hi!

At this point, the intent is only to handle bijective relabelling (I just updated the title accordingly). Doing more could certainly be useful, but as you point out would require more algorithmic and possibly more information from the user. So that would be for a later patch.

So for this patch it would indeed make sense to add a sanity check that all new labels are distinct. I'll try to get around to do this, unless you beat me to it :-)

My turn now : I'm sorry for not having seen it earlier, but you are adding a new way to relabel a graph through a function and the docstring does not mention it. So it's quite unlikely anybody else would notice `:-)`

Could you add some mention of it in the doc ?

After that, I promise I will write a patch for anything else I wouldn't have noticed :-D`

Done. And since we should always go the extra mile, I reworked a bit the rest of the doc. Since I haven't changed the code, test pass on this file, and the documentation compiles and looks reasonable, I assume the buildbot will stay green.
