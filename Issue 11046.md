Keywords: factorization, tower of number fields

I suspect this is a regression, but I do not have and old sage copy right now


```
sage: K=QQ[I]['x,t']
sage: K.inject_variables()
Defining x, t
sage: f=t^2+1
sage: f.factor()
(t + (-I)) * (t + (I))
sage: K=QQ[sqrt(5),I]['t']  
sage: K.inject_variables()
Defining t
sage: f=t^2+1   
sage: f.factor()
(x + I) * (x - I)
sage: prod(f.factor())==f
False
sage: f.parent()
Univariate Polynomial Ring in t over Number Field in sqrt5 with defining polynomial x^2 - 5 over its base field
sage: prod(f.factor()).parent()
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Number Field in sqrt5 with defining polynomial x^2 - 5 over its base field
```


Factor of uni-variate polynomials in polynomial rings (uni and multivariate) over towers of number fields are broken, since the output variable is always 'x', so it the output is in the wrong ring.
