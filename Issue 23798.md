Finite Quadratic Forms can be diagonalized for p!=2.
For p=2 they can be decomposed into blocks of size at most 2.
This is completely analogous to quadratic forms over the p-adics.

I have tested the functions on the 290 lattices of 
https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.06420

There are many lattices with determinants divisible by 2^n. So they are good for testing the 2-adic case which is the most complicated.

The normalisation doesn't order square and not square elements. This functionality could be useful in order to compare two discriminant forms (together with the order given by the p-valuation)

for example:

```
from sage.modules.torsion_quadratic_module import TorsionQuadraticModule
M = CartanMatrix(['D',8])*3^4
L = FreeQuadraticModule(ZZ,8,M)
Ld = L.span(M.inverse())
T = TorsionQuadraticModule(Ld,L)
T2= T.primary_part(2)
Todd=T.orthogonal_submodule_to(T2)
Todd.orthogonal_gens()
```

gives:

If L is an even lattice, sometimes ```orthogonal_gens``` returns a matrix not in the form declared in the documentation. 
For odd p we could have diagonal values bigger than 1:

```
sage: from sage.modules.torsion_quadratic_module import TorsionQuadraticModule
sage: M = CartanMatrix(['E',8])*3
sage: L = FreeQuadraticModule(ZZ,8,M)
sage: Ld = L.span(M.inverse())
sage: T = TorsionQuadraticModule(Ld,L)
sage: T.orthogonal_gens()

[  0   0   0   0   0   0   0 2/3]

```


And for p=2 we could have not normalized blocks

```
sage: from sage.modules.torsion_quadratic_module import TorsionQuadraticModule
sage: M = CartanMatrix(['E',8])*8
sage: L = FreeQuadraticModule(ZZ,8,M)
