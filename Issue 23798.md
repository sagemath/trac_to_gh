# Issue 23798: Orthogonal/Jordan decomposition for TorsionQuadraticModules

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24035

Original creator: sbrandhorst

Original creation time: 2017-10-13 15:06:14

Finite Quadratic Forms can be diagonalized for p!=2.
For p=2 they can be decomposed into blocks of size at most 2.
This is completely analogous to quadratic forms over the p-adics.

I have tested the functions on the 290 lattices of 
https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.06420

There are many lattices with determinants divisible by 2^n. So they are good for testing the 2-adic case which is the most complicated.

(fixed) Diagonalization fails in this example:



```
from sage.modules.torsion_quadratic_module import TorsionQuadraticModule
M = CartanMatrix(['D',8])*3^4
L = FreeQuadraticModule(ZZ,8,M)
Ld = L.span(M.inverse())
T = TorsionQuadraticModule(Ld,L)
T.orthogonal_gens()
```


the problem is related to how p-adic precision is setted. It could be at least equivalent to the discriminant group

The normalisation doesn't order square and not square elements. This functionality could be useful in order to compare two discriminant forms (together with the order given by the p-valuation)

for example:

```
from sage.modules.torsion_quadratic_module import TorsionQuadraticModule
M = CartanMatrix(['D',8])*3^4
L = FreeQuadraticModule(ZZ,8,M)
Ld = L.span(M.inverse())
T = TorsionQuadraticModule(Ld,L)
T2= T.primary_part(2)
Todd=T.orthogonal_submodule_to(T2)
Todd.orthogonal_gens()
```

gives:

If L is an even lattice, sometimes ```orthogonal_gens``` returns a matrix not in the form declared in the documentation. 
For odd p we could have diagonal values bigger than 1:

```
sage: from sage.modules.torsion_quadratic_module import TorsionQuadraticModule
sage: M = CartanMatrix(['E',8])*3
sage: L = FreeQuadraticModule(ZZ,8,M)
sage: Ld = L.span(M.inverse())
sage: T = TorsionQuadraticModule(Ld,L)
sage: T.orthogonal_gens()

Finite quadratic module over Integer Ring with invariants (3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3)

[2/3   0   0   0   0   0   0   0]
[  0 2/3   0   0   0   0   0   0]
[  0   0 2/3   0   0   0   0   0]
[  0   0   0 2/3   0   0   0   0]
[  0   0   0   0 4/3   0   0   0]
[  0   0   0   0   0 2/3   0   0]
[  0   0   0   0   0   0 4/3   0]
[  0   0   0   0   0   0   0 2/3]

```


And for p=2 we could have not normalized blocks

```
sage: from sage.modules.torsion_quadratic_module import TorsionQuadraticModule
sage: M = CartanMatrix(['E',8])*8
sage: L = FreeQuadraticModule(ZZ,8,M)
sage: Ld = L.span(M.inverse())
sage: T = TorsionQuadraticModule(Ld,L)
sage: T.orthogonal_gens()

[1/8 1/4   0   0   0   0   0   0]
[  0   0   0 1/8   0   0   0   0]
[  0   0 1/8   1   0   0   0   0]
[  0   0   0   0 1/4 1/8   0   0]
[  0   0   0   0 1/8 1/4   0   0]
[  0   0   0   0   0   0   1 1/8]
[  0   0   0   0   0   0 1/8   0]
```

The following code is still running after 176 000 examples.
So far no bugs.

```
block = []
for x in mrange([5,5,5,5]):
    x = [2*d-1 for d in x]
    y = []
    for d in x:
        if d!=-1:
            y.append(d)
    block.append(matrix.diagonal(R,y))

#L = []
s = 0
for b0 in block:
    for b1 in block:
        for b2 in block:
            print(s)
            s = s+1
            D = Matrix.block_diagonal([b0,2*b1,4*b2])
            if D.ncols()!=0:
                a = p_adic_normal_form(D,p,precision=prec)[0].change_ring(ZZ)
                n = a.ncols()
                for k in range(20):
                    u = random_matrix(ZZ,n,n,algorithm='unimodular')
                    aa = p_adic_normal_form(u*D*u.T,p,precision=prec)[0].change_ring(ZZ)
                    assert a == aa
```

The mathematical part seems ok and the examples tested work. 
The code is well commented, it remains now to check python conventions and improve the documentation
