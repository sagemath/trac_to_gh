fedora-26-minimal (https://github.com/sagemath/sage/runs/4752776718):

```
  [pyzmq-22.3.0] error installing, exit status 1. End of log file:

  [pyzmq-22.3.0]   
```

tests for other fedora versions still running at https://github.com/sagemath/sage/actions/runs/1673712139

`-standard` builds (with system libzmq) seem fine, for example `fedora-28-standard` (https://github.com/sagemath/sage/runs/4752776869)
