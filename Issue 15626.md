Normally, this should be fixed by #15755, hashes should never return a Python `long`. Proposal: close as invalid.

This is caused by #15755. Also, there is nothing wrong with returning `long` for hashes on obsolete platforms imho. In this particular case Polybori returns the hash as `size_t`.

Can you confirm then that doctests do not pass with #15755 and they do pass with #15863?

> Also, there is nothing wrong with returning `long` for hashes on obsolete platforms imho.
Who says it only happens on "obsolete" platforms?

Yes.

It works on LP64. Nobody in their right mind is going to use 32-bit or Windows 64 for scientific computations nowadays.
