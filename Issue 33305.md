# Issue 33305: Align notation of vector fields

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33542

Currently, the notation for the vectorfield module is given by `\mathfrak{X}(U,\Phi)`. The most common notation for sections of (vector) bundles, however, is `\Gamma(\Phi^* TM)` or `C<sup>k(U;\Phi</sup>* TM)` to indicate the regularity.

For vector bundles, I have used the latter notation. It might be a good idea to unify this, or introduce both notations to improve readability and accessibility to our doc.

> `C^k(U;E)`

From what I've seen, this is the usual notation for arbitrary k-smooth maps from `U` to `E`; the set of global sections of `E` is usually denoted by `\Gamma(E)` or `\Gamma^k(E)`, and `\Gamma^k(U; E)` (or `\Gamma^k_U(E)`) for sections over a subset `U` of the base.

> \mathfrak{X}(U,\Phi)

`\mathfrak{X}(M)` is a pretty common notation for the set of vector fields on `M`. I don't think there is a standard notation for vector fields along a map, but `\mathfrak{X}(U,\Phi)` seems like a good convention (which however needs explanation).

I agree: `\mathfrak{X}(M)` is a standard notation and we should keep it. It is then quite natural to use `\mathfrak{X}(U,\Phi)` for vector fields along a map.

May I ask about the purpose of these doctests:

```diff
+        TESTS:
+
+        Identity map of a differentiable manifold::
+
+            sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M', structure='differentiable')
+            sage: id = M.identity_map(); id
+            Identity map Id_M of the 2-dimensional differentiable manifold M
+            sage: isinstance(id, sage.manifolds.differentiable.diff_map.DiffMap)
+            True
+
+        Identity map of a topological manifold is not smooth::
+        
+            sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M', structure='topological')
+            sage: isinstance(M.identity_map(), sage.manifolds.differentiable.diff_map.DiffMap)
+            False
```

They are pretty trivial and I am not sure they are useful. Moreover, I don't see the connection with the topic of this ticket.

I agree, `\mathfrak{X}(M)` _is_ common. That is not what I meant. I rephrased the description (frantically opened this ticket this morning between two meetings).

In principle, I just wanted to start a discussion as these changes were proposed by Tobias in another ticket. `@`Tobias, maybe you can point out the purpose of these changes that you had in mind, and modify the description accordingly?

They were a result of a discussion/confusion at the beginning of #29775.

I don't like this notation. This looks like a statement. I'd prefer something like this:


```diff
-    the *vector field module* `\mathfrak{X}(U,\Phi)` is the set of
+    the *vector field module* `\mathfrak{X}(U,\Phi)` (sometimes also denoted as 
+    `\Gamma(\Phi^* TM)` or `C^k(U; \Phi^* TM) )` is the set of
```


Also, it could be a nice idea to add a reference to [the section modules of vector bundles](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/manifolds/sage/manifolds/section_module.html).

It might be worth to check other files and make the changes accordingly.

Moreover, I agree with Eric. I still don't see the purpose of this (trivial) test.

It is also a statement. `\mathfrak{X}(M)` is an abbreviation for `\Gamma^\infty(TM)`, i.e. `\mathfrak{X}(M) \equiv \Gamma^\infty(TM)`. I've clarified this point now.

Ok, removed.
