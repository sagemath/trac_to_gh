This ticket follow the discussion of ticket [#22889](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22889)

There are still instances in the Sage library of code like

```
if A == True:
...
if B == False:
...
if C == None:
...
```

which should be changed to

```
if A:
...
if not B:
...
if C is None:
...
```


This ticket goal is to fix the remaining cases identified during the review :
