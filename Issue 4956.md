```
This works 
html(r'Donde $\Sigma$ es la sumatoria de los n&uacute;meros... etc.' ) 
but only works the first time. If you save & quit your work, after 
trying again it fails. This is because when saving it converts 
"n&uacute;meros" to "n√∫meros". 
```


Note that this issue might be closely related to some other notebook tickets.

Cheers,

This works for me now, since the output files now have the magic utf-8 comment. Please close this.
