Sorry, no time until sunset. As I am now above the artic circle, it may take some time.

In the Hecke algebra sections where line breaks were changed in comments, 'that' should be 'than' (not a mistake you made, just an additional typo to be corrected in the original version).

Otherwise, everything looks good to me, assuming Patchbot is happy (currently don't have to way to compile/test myself).

all tests pass on the modified files.

I have just corrected 3 more typos since Kevin had a look.

Given the nature of the ticket, I am setting this to positive.
