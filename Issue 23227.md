Here is an example:

    sage: R.<pi> = Qp(7).extension(x^3 - 7)
    sage: (pi^93).add_bigoh(-10)
    <BOUM>
```

The segfaulting starts at the 76th power; I'm not sure why 76.  The following is perhaps closer to the problem:

```
sage: (pi^93)._ntl_rep_abs()
<BOOM>
```

It now works (with Sage 8.3.beta1)! Though I don't know why...

Should we close this ticket?

Weird.  I don't know of anything that would have fixed this.  If it works now we should add a test.
