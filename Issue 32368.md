If we are having a test failure like that, then we can't upgrade this to an optional. Or is it still marked as `# known bug`?

Right, we had marked some of the failing or non-robust tests `optional - polymake_expect`.
I'll mark the ones that failed this time in the same way.

Okay, that will be good.

The only other thing I am not sure about with making this optional is the perl dependencies. It should be okay, but I feel like we should just double check on sage-devel about this.

I'd say the Perl dependencies are just like other dummy packages that we have that can only be installed using system packages. For example: `pandoc`

I've now merged #31163, which gives better system package info when someone ignores the advice issued by `configure` and attempts to install `perl_cpan_polymake_prereq` (directly or as a dependency of `polymake`).

On #31527 I found that `jupymake` must be installed if `polymake` is, so dependencies aren't set right here.
