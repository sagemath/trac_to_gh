In the wake of #23671, a meta-ticket to record some proposed improvements to hypergeometric motives. Please add suggestions to this list, and make individual tickets for individual changes.

- Euler factors at tame and wild primes.
- Tune the p-adic precision in `padic_H_value`.
- Speed up the computation of p-adic Gamma.
- Speed up possible_hypergeometric_data for fixed weight.
- Add the computation of the Frobenius structure on the hypergeometric equation, which can be more efficient than the trace formula when the degree is large.

Batch modifying tickets that will likely not be ready for 9.1, based on a review of the ticket title, branch/review status, and last modification date.

Setting new milestone based on a cursory review of ticket status, priority, and last modification date.
