In the wake of #23671, a meta-ticket to record some proposed improvements to hypergeometric motives. Please add suggestions to this list, and make individual tickets for individual changes.

- Euler factors at tame and wild primes.
- Tune the p-adic precision in `padic_H_value`.
- Speed up the computation of p-adic Gamma.
- Speed up possible_hypergeometric_data for fixed weight.
- Add the computation of the Frobenius structure on the hypergeometric equation, which can be more efficient than the trace formula when the degree is large.
