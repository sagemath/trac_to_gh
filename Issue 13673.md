Applying #13832, #13864, #13867. #13868, #13876, I get the following when starting Sage:

```

So, I guess that's the job of #13868...

I first considered #13864 not as a meta-ticket, but as a ticket with the single purpose to configure Python with pydebug when SAGE_DEBUG is set to "yes". But as you now changed it into a "task": Yes, it is a duplicate.
