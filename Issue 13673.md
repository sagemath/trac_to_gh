# Issue 13673: Metaticket: Make SAGE_DEBUG work

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: SimonKing

Original creation time: 2012-12-28 13:05:23

Assignee: GeorgSWeber

CC:  nbruin vbraun jpflori jdemeyer

Keywords: SAGE_DEBUG

Currently, building Sage with SAGE_DEBUG set to "yes" does not work. The purpose of this ticket is to keep track of what single tickets are needed to make it work.

Preliminary list:

 * #13832
 * #13864
 * #13867
 * #13868
 * #13876

Applying #13832, #13864, #13867. #13868, #13876, I get the following when starting Sage:

```

     62     else:

SystemError: Objects/object.c:854: bad argument to internal function

```


So, I guess that's the job of #13868...

I beat you to it, the metaticket is #13864 ;-)

I suggest we close this as duplicate

I first considered #13864 not as a meta-ticket, but as a ticket with the single purpose to configure Python with pydebug when SAGE_DEBUG is set to "yes". But as you now changed it into a "task": Yes, it is a duplicate.
