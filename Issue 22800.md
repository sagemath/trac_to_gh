Keywords: lie algebras

We implement the chargeless representations and Verma modules for the Virasoro algebra. Along the way, we also add `witt` to the catalog, fix an issue with actions for Lie algebra elements, and change the bracket convention for the Witt and Virasoro algebras.

A note on the change to the bracket convention: Our current bracket convention is non-standard with the rest of the literature and causes formulas to change in subtle ways. So the easiest thing to do is change it, and I think this will be better in the long run.

A strange sentence here in Verma modules:

```

```

Maybe you mean `of the shape` ?

Otherwise, looks good.

No, it is a triangular decomposition in the same way of simple Lie algebras or Lie groups by the root system (positive, negative, and 0 parts). I made some tweaks to the documentation; they probably don't help much, but maybe they do.

Thank you very much for looking at this.

I understand the triangular decomposition, sure.

You introduced a typo : "trianglar"

I would simply remove the "of"
