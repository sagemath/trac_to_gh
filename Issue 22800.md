# Issue 22800: Implement representations for Virasoro algebra

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23037

Original creator: tscrim

Original creation time: 2017-05-20 07:18:20

CC:  sage-combinat darij

Keywords: lie algebras

We implement the chargeless representations and Verma modules for the Virasoro algebra. Along the way, we also add `witt` to the catalog, fix an issue with actions for Lie algebra elements, and change the bracket convention for the Witt and Virasoro algebras.

A note on the change to the bracket convention: Our current bracket convention is non-standard with the rest of the literature and causes formulas to change in subtle ways. So the easiest thing to do is change it, and I think this will be better in the long run.

There is one `it.next` that should be `next(it)` for py3 sake, no ?

and doc does not build, probably because of

```
+    this for `\{d_i \mid -10 \leq i < 10\}::
```


EDIT: typo "+    REFERNCES::"

Yes, thanks. Fixed.

another issue here:

```
+    REFERENCES::
```

has too many colons

Good catch. Fixed.

A strange sentence here in Verma modules:

```
+    The Virasoro algebra admits a triangle decomposition of
```

Maybe you mean `of the shape` ?

Otherwise, looks good.

No, it is a triangular decomposition in the same way of simple Lie algebras or Lie groups by the root system (positive, negative, and 0 parts). I made some tweaks to the documentation; they probably don't help much, but maybe they do.

> Otherwise, looks good.

Thank you very much for looking at this.

I understand the triangular decomposition, sure.

You introduced a typo : "trianglar"

I would simply remove the "of"

Ah, sorry, I misunderstood your comment:11. Here is the fix from comment:14.
