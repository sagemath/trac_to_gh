# Issue 14746: Trac has trouble showing patchsets

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14983

Original creator: gagern

Original creation time: 2013-07-30 15:21:10

[A search for “patchbot”](http://trac.sagemath.org/search?q=patchbot&noquickjump=1&changeset=on&wiki=on) yielded a list with one entry: a reference to

> [a4ddf299584ba04b3204f40161573c9fab01aaef]: Trac 10702: add patchbot to the developers guide

with the above line linked to http://trac.sagemath.org/changeset/a4ddf299584ba04b3204f40161573c9fab01aaef.

But when I follow that link, I get an error message:

> Error: Invalid Changeset Number
>
> No changeset a4ddf299584ba04b3204f40161573c9fab01aaef in the repository

I find this really strange, and somewhat annoying as well. I could not find this issue in the [upstream bug list](http://trac.edgewall.org/query?component=plugin%2Fmercurial) for the [mercurial plugin](http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracMercurial). If you have checked for obvious configuration problems, you might want to [report this upstream](http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/NewTicket), since you will be able to cooperate with Trac upstream, trying out patches and the likes.

I guess this is obsoleted by the move to git. Particularly since the git plugin for trac is not used. It seems I can't close my own tickets, though.
