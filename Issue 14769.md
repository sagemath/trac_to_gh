# Issue 14769: Unclear example in the tutorial

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15006

Original creator: mmezzarobba

Original creation time: 2013-08-06 09:38:24

Keywords: tutorial

`src/doc/en/tutorial/programming.rst` contains the following text:


```
A common idiom is to iterate through the pairs in a dictionary:

::

    sage: d = {2:4, 3:9, 4:16}
    sage: [a*b for a, b in d.iteritems()]
    [8, 27, 64]

A dictionary is unordered, as the last output illustrates.
```


It may just be me being thick but I don't see how this illustrates that a dictionary is unordered.

In fact, the order is the expected one in the example (otherwise the doctest would occasionally fail). But it is only fixed in this case coincidentally (CPython hash table implementation detail and consecutive hashes for Sage integers). 

Perhaps a better example

```
sage: d = dict([(chr(i+97), i) for i in range(26)])
sage: d   # note: our displayhook sorts output by keys!
{'a': 0,
 'b': 1,
 'c': 2,
 'd': 3,
 'e': 4,
 'f': 5,
 'g': 6,
 'h': 7,
 'i': 8,
 'j': 9,
 'k': 10,
 'l': 11,
 'm': 12,
 'n': 13,
 'o': 14,
 'p': 15,
 'q': 16,
 'r': 17,
 's': 18,
 't': 19,
 'u': 20,
 'v': 21,
 'w': 22,
 'x': 23,
 'y': 24,
 'z': 25}
sage: d.keys()     # random order
['a',
 'c',
 'b',
 'e',
 'd',
 'g',
 'f',
 'i',
 'h',
 'k',
 'j',
 'm',
 'l',
 'o',
 'n',
 'q',
 'p',
 's',
 'r',
 'u',
 't',
 'w',
 'v',
 'y',
 'x',
 'z']
```

I'm interpreting that as 'needs work' but feel free to change back if that is not what was intended.
