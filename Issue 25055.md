There is no Cython 0.29 yet, but consider this as a metaticket for Cython issues which would be fixed by that.

Running `make distclean && make cython` with `SAGE_CHECK=yes`, I'm reproducibly getting one test failing (see log).

(The two failing tests in #26450 don't seem to be an issue anymore in 0.29.)

Does this mean Cython 0.29 will become a hard dependency of Sage?  I don't mind that ofc, but maybe the tickets that depend on it can be done in such a way that checks this (e.g., checks the Cython version before enabling those features).

I'm going to give this a quick check on Cygwin, but I doubt there will be any problem, so positive_review from me if it that works.

I can only really talk about the cycache ticket. There we could of course only enable caching when we find that it actually works.

I guess the same could be done for the other ticket but I do not know enough about it.

Nix uses a bot that automatically generates trivial package update PRs based on repology data. I think adding support for another repo would basically sonsist of (1) finding a relibale data source that gives current metadata about all packages and (2) converting that datasource into the format repology expects.

Yeah its pretty neat. Nix uses a bot that automatically generates trivial package update PRs based on repology data. I think adding support for another repo would basically sonsist of (1) finding a relibale data source that gives current metadata about all packages and (2) converting that datasource into the format repology expects. There are already issues for [conda-forge](https://github.com/repology/repology/issues/518) and [cygwin](https://github.com/repology/repology/issues/269).

The curating is imperfect and for some distros it is listed under "cython" and for other under "python:cython" https://repology.org/metapackage/python:cython/versions not much you can do about that.

No, it is not. The difference is really small though, packagers that insist on Cython 0.28 can easily revert this patch.

I think that's a bit presumptuous.  But I agree there's no reason for anyone to hold back up on updating Cython and that it should/will happen before long so I don't object to moving forward on this.
