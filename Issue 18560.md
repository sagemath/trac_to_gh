Error building Sage.
 
The following package(s) may have failed to build:
 
package: linbox-1.3.2.p1
log file: /projects/1f2a5de2-58fe-4dd3-9ae9-2abee319cbee/sage-dev-images/sage-6.8.beta3/logs/pkgs/linbox-1.3.2.p1.log

```


This one was a "make build" after "make distclean" (albeit a second attempt because the first was interrupted; this is on Sagemathcloud again).

```

Either your compiler is broken, or there was some system problem (out of memory?).

In any case, it's not a Sage problem.
