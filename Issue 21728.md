# Issue 21728: Unhandled SIGILL running sage on Debian 7

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21965

Original creator: bisson

Original creation time: 2016-11-25 02:58:49

Keywords: sigill, wheezy

When I unpack sage-7.4-Debian_GNU_Linux_7-x86_64.tar.bz2 on a Debian Wheezy system and then run `./sage` at the root of the extracted folder, after a few seconds I get a backtrace and the program terminates. See the output attached.
