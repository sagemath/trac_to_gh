Keywords: sd87 gamma p-adic

This code uses the Gross-Koblitz formula to compute Gauss sums as products of p-adic Gamma functions. The result is an element of a totally ramified extension of Q_p. This can be much faster than computing gauss sums in the naive way.

There is a code snippet on #23671 that checks the p-adic computation against the computation by roots of unity. Perhaps that could be added as a doctest, but not on this ticket since it's already closed.
