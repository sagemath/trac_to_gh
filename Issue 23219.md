# Issue 23219: Compute Gauss sums with Gross-Koblitz formula

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23456

Original creator: asteele

Original creation time: 2017-07-18 15:51:17

Keywords: sd87 gamma p-adic

This code uses the Gross-Koblitz formula to compute Gauss sums as products of p-adic Gamma functions. The result is an element of a totally ramified extension of Q_p. This can be much faster than computing gauss sums in the naive way.

I am happy to see this available; this will come handy for some code I am working on right now.

But the documentation is not properly formatted. I am going now to make a quick reviewer commit to fix that.

Here it is. If you agree with my (small) changes, please set back to positive review in my name.

I moved the imports inside the function, and documentation builds now.

I changed a detail in the doc, and checked that doc builds. I am setting back to positive review.

Silly question maybe, but are we completely sure of the correctness of the code here ? I am asking because I have some problems in #23671 that could possibly come from here.

There is a code snippet on #23671 that checks the p-adic computation against the computation by roots of unity. Perhaps that could be added as a doctest, but not on this ticket since it's already closed.
