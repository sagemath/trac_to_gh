Patch attached.  Depends upon trac_12960-fix_legend.2.patch, not for the fix, but for the doctest.

Hello, patchbot!

Apply only trac_11998_v2_combined.patch

be more aggressive about pruning legend labels, v2b combined

You don't like whitespace, do you, patchbot?

Sorry to bother again, but this still doesn't apply to sage-5.1.beta3 + #10514:

```

trac_10514-reviewer.patch

I think this is just because dsm didn't change the ticket description.  Can you try [attachment:trac_11998_v2b_combined.patch]?  Doug, can you confirm that's the right one and change the description accordingly?

(Actually, Doug, you have a superfluous `::` line there you might want to get rid of... but I sort of doubt it will cause an error.  But you might as well refresh it.)

I can confirm that it does apply correctly on 5.1.beta3.

Deleted the other patches for good measure :-)
