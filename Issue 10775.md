As reported in [a sage-support thread](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/7d0fdb331d05c557), in 4.6.1 we see that


```
sage: # succeeds

1
sage: # fails
sage: f = Piecewise([[(0,1),0]])

ultimately because 0 is special-cased:


```
sage: type(SR(0).integral(x))
<type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>
sage: type(SR(1).integral(x))
<type 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression'>
```


and the code path for a zero in Piecewise.integral never coerces to SR, so .function fails.

I've tested this on one machine on an older version of Sage and sage -testall passed, except for 
failing the (presumably unrelated) R-interface file. Also, the code looks good, has the appropriate doctests
and seems to do what is claimed. I want to test it on one more machine before giving it a positive review though.
