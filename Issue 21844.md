I like this new functionality.  It would be great if regular polygons could also be drawn in the Poincare disc model.

Here are a few issues with the coding style:

In hyperbolic_arc.py, HyperbolicArc.__init__, the code


```
        else:
            if model == "PD":
```


would better be


```
        elif model == "PD":
```


which then requires less indenting for the following block.

HyperbolicArc.__init__ should also report an error if `model` is neither 'UHP' or 'PD' rather than raising some other error.  For example, `hyperbolic_arc(0, 1, model='foo')` raises an index error rather than reporting the actual user error.

The same two remarks apply to HyperbolicPolygon.__init__.

The style guide in PEP 8 says "Method definitions inside a class are surrounded by a single blank line.".  Please do that here.

The coding guideline for docstrings says

  It describes the function or method’s effect as a command (“Do this”, “Return that”), not as a description like “Returns the pathname ...”.


So for example, the documentation for _PD_hyperbolic_arc, "Function to construct an hyperbolic arc ...",  should start "Construct an hyperbolic arc ...".  The docstring for _bezier_path, "Returns the corresponding bezier path", should not start with "Returns the" and in any case should be more informative about the function.  As this function does not in fact return anything, the docstring is quite misleading.

The docstrings should be more complete as well, for all method definitions, describing the inputs and output and containing at least one example or test.  See http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#section-documentation-strings

There are several identical methods in hyperbolic_arc.py and hyperbolic_polygon.py.  This code duplication is never a good idea if the functions are truly the same.  Perhaps the two classes could inherit from some new class that contains a singly copy of these definitions---this will make repair easier if an error is discovered in future or some new functionality is to be added.

It would be useful somewhere to describe  the different coordinate systems used for the two models, as it is not immediately obvious what are legitimate PD coordinates.

It is too bad that there is no model-independent way to specify the points (which would make it easy to plot the same diagram in the two different models).  However, adding this probably goes beyond the scope of what you are trying to do here.

Finally, file /src/bin/sage-env-config should not be tracked.

I am now wondering a bit why we are not using (and possibly combining with) the code already provided by `HyperbolicPlane` for this. It seems to be doing the same computations and it would be good for code maintenance. I know some of the implementation details need to be different, but I suspect there is code to be shared, which would give the other models essentially for free.

I agree. As a matter of fact we had this same doubt in ticket:22002#comment:3 five years ago. I see no trouble in relying on the geometry code, as its .plot()[0] are in fact `<class 'sage.plot.arc.Arc'>` and the same programming logic can be used to transform them in bezier arcs allowing for filling.
Is this a decision that we alone can make?

Thank you for the additional changes. There were still a few bugs dealing with the different input types of `CC` versus vectors. I have tried to make the code more robust, but there are likely to be some other subtle bugs involved with an assumption of one type of input over the other. However, that can wait until another ticket.

I managed to streamline the arc construction with a little bit of refactoring and a well-placed `getattr`.

I made some other documentation tweaks and fixes.

If the bot comes back green (in particular, I think we should look at the doc output with the new tag above), then we can set a positive review if my changes are good.

Also, sometimes it can be good to ignore what the any linter/codestyle tool says in favor of readability and consistency with other code. `:)`
