# Issue 16196: clique_with_loops.is_strongly_regular() is True

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16433

Original creator: ncohen

Original creation time: 2014-06-03 17:02:09

CC:  vdelecroix

In #16370 Vincent reported the following


```
sage: BIBD = designs.BalancedIncompleteBlockDesign(31,6)
sage: V = map(Set, BIBD.blocks())
sage: G = Graph([V, lambda x,y: x&y])
sage: G.is_strongly_regular(parameters=True)
(31, 32, 31, -1)
```


The parameters should always be positive, and this bug comes from the fact that G is a clique with loops. And well, strongly regular graphs are assumed to be simple, so let's keep Sage's code simple without trying to generalize definitions `:-P`

Hi Nathann,

Nice fix! I added docs. See u/vdelecroix/16433. Have a look and put positive review if you like.

Yo !

> Nice fix! I added docs. See u/vdelecroix/16433. Have a look and put positive review if you like.

Sounds a bit counter-productive to add such comments here while we implement `OrthogonalArrayGraphs` just near. Don't you prefer to have this patch depend on #16370 so that you can link to the doc of `OrthogonalArrayGraph` (with stuff like a seealso block) ? By the way we have a LOT of strongly reguar graphs in Sage (including families), so unless you want to make a list of them these comments do not make much sense to me... The doc about BIBD and OA graphs really belong to the doc of those functions, not to the doc of this method.

What we should do perhaps is begin to index the SRG we can build somewhere. But I don't know how to do this properly atm...

So it's up to you. If you insist on adding this I don't mind.

I do know nothing about strongly regular graphs, so I was very enthusiastic of having this one. But you are right it does not make much sense.

Ok. Just keep this in mind.

Just add the doctest about the errors (there are at the very end of the doc in the commit). I do not mind if you do a copy paste and keep it in your branch.

What about your branch then ?... Do you update it ?

Of course I keep this in mind. I have been implementing families for this only...

Okay Okay so I update your branch ...

Okay, turns out I cannot add a reference to the OA graphs because the ticket may be closed as wontfix. So I do what I can.

How did you manage to make me the author of the last commit ???

When you run git commit --amend instead of git commit you do not create a new commit but add your changes to the last commit. I just did that. I does not change the author's name.

You can also set the author manually when you do a commit btw.
