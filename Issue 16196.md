In #16370 Vincent reported the following


```
sage: BIBD = designs.BalancedIncompleteBlockDesign(31,6)
sage: V = map(Set, BIBD.blocks())
sage: G = Graph([V, lambda x,y: x&y])
sage: G.is_strongly_regular(parameters=True)
(31, 32, 31, -1)
```


The parameters should always be positive, and this bug comes from the fact that G is a clique with loops. And well, strongly regular graphs are assumed to be simple, so let's keep Sage's code simple without trying to generalize definitions `:-P`

Hi Nathann,

Nice fix! I added docs. See u/vdelecroix/16433. Have a look and put positive review if you like.

What we should do perhaps is begin to index the SRG we can build somewhere. But I don't know how to do this properly atm...

So it's up to you. If you insist on adding this I don't mind.

I do know nothing about strongly regular graphs, so I was very enthusiastic of having this one. But you are right it does not make much sense.

Ok. Just keep this in mind.

Just add the doctest about the errors (there are at the very end of the doc in the commit). I do not mind if you do a copy paste and keep it in your branch.

When you run git commit --amend instead of git commit you do not create a new commit but add your changes to the last commit. I just did that. I does not change the author's name.

You can also set the author manually when you do a commit btw.
