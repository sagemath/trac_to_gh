Currently `gmp.pc`, which may be provided at least on some platforms, is not used at all -- neither by `configure` nor by `sage.env.cython_aliases`, `sage.misc.cython`.

For example, on homebrew, using it will provide the specific library search directory `-L/usr/local/Cellar/gmp/6.2.1/lib` instead of having to rely on `/usr/local/` (which is disabled when compiler/linker are invoked with `-isysroot`)

The failure reported in #31335#comment:47 only `sage.misc.cython` to pick up `gmp.pc` - but to avoid unpleasant surprises, we need to make sure that it is used consistently when present.

previous tickets: #27212

I started to play around with this a bit, and I can use python’s pkgconfig to locate gmp and mpfr.  After doing that though, I get complaints about not being able to locagte -lntl, which I don’t think I can find with pkgconfig since it doesn’t have an ntl.pc file.

This may be a bit too hacky, but would it be possible in the build process to copy the various includes and libraries to SAGE_LOCAL/{include, lib} that are picked up by configure?

For NTL, the configure script already determines `SAGE_NTL_PREFIX`.
This variable just needs to be used more.

They have merged a broader change now, eliminating all of `distutils.cfg` (https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/91043#issuecomment-1032079055), at least for their Python 3.10 package. That's a good improvement, but it changes nothing for the present ticket.
