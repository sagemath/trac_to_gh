Keywords: solve, solution_dict

As pointed out in a post on sage-support:

```
var('x')
g(x)=0
print solve(g(x)==0,x)
print solve(g(x)==0,x,solution_dict=True) 
```

gives

```
[x == r1]
{x: r1}
```

It should be [{x: r1}] to be consistent.

Yep:

```
       * ``solution_dict`` - bool (default: False); if True or non-zero,
         return a list of dictionaries containing the solutions. If there
         are no solutions, return an empty list (rather than a list
         containing an empty dictionary). Likewise, if there's only a
         single solution, return a list containing one dictionary with
         that solution.
```


A doctest for a similar case got deleted by a reviewer, which still works though:

```
sage: solve([x+y==6, x-y==4], x, y, solution_dict=-1)
[{y: 1, x: 5}]
```

And also the following works as expected:

```
sage: solve([x==0],x,solution_dict=True)
[{x: 0}]
```

(Sage 4.7.1.{alpha2,rc0})

The attached patch fixes the inconsistency and adds a doctest for the case given.

I've removed superfluous parentheses (and white space) and also converted some tabs to spaces. (I thought the merge script would reject patches introducing new tabs after all got converted a while ago.)

Hmmm,

ans = [ {x: self.parent().var('r1')} ]
```

would perhaps have been a bit more readable...

I've updated the patch to directly construct the solution dictionary.
