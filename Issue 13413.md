# Issue 13413: SEGFAULT in matrix_mod_pn for padic extensions

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13617

Original creator: saraedum

Original creation time: 2012-10-18 14:06:33

Assignee: roed

The following code produces a SEGFAULT:

```
sage: R = ZpCR(5,5)
sage: S.<x> = R[]
sage: f = x^5 + 75*x^3 - 15*x^2 +125*x - 5
sage: W.<w> = R.ext(f)
sage: W.zero().matrix_mod_pn()
```


The attached patch fixes this.

Is this ready for review?

Thanks for looking into these tickets. I have not run the doctests yet on the tickets which are not marked as needs review. I'll try to do so in the next few days and set them to needs review afterwards.

If you set it to "needs review" then the patchbot will run doctests for you.  You can feel free to make a comment saying that you're waiting on the patchbot to run tests.

I just didn't want to give various tickets a positive review if you were still planning on adding more code/documentation.  :-)

Changing status from new to needs_review.

Hehe, and I was actually wondering why the patchbot would never pick up some of my tickets.

I think one should avoid writing ```self``` in the docstrings. As a beginner, I found it quite hard to understand what it meant and it is present in quite a few documentations. Only when I started writing classes could I grasp its true meaning. Perhaps the last line can be rewritten as follows? It's up to you, whether you deem it acceptable.

My suggestion is to change this

```
(unless ``self`` is zero to arbitrary precision; in that case the entries are integer zeros.)
```

to

```
If this element of the ring is zero to arbitrary precision,
then the entries of the matrix are integer zeros.
```

The patchbot will eventually pick up "new" tickets, but only after doing all the needs and positive review ones. 

+1 removing the explicit reference to self

Just as a note, it's easier to read the diff (and see what changed) if you don't re-wrap the portion of the docs that you're not editing.

Thanks for the comments. I'll remove the references to `self`.
