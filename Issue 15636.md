What's the reason behind changing the example in `src/doc/en/thematic_tutorials/group_theory.rst` to a smaller example? Was it too slow?

I can't find in the docs the way to review such kind of tickets in the git way. 
What should be done besides

```
sage -dev checkout --ticket 15873
sage -b
```

Thanks!

I don't really know.
Have a look at the changes?
You can click on the branch name here or use `git diff` with something like:

```
git diff trac/develop
```

no, I mean, what to do with the tarballs? I sort of know what to do with tickets without tarballs...

Ah, sure.
Just download them to the upstream directory and then do what you suggested to rebuild Sage.

FYI, it compiled and build doc without trouble on a sparc/solaris machine I have access to.
Otherwise the changes look ok to me.
I'll just check I can build it on another machine and give it a quick look there and I'll be happy with the update when Volker answer my previous question from comment:7.

See #15582 comment 10.

It seems the atlasrep pkg is not installed by database_gap.
Adding this to spkg-install makes more doctests depending on atlasrep or tomlib happy.

See #15582 comment 10 

EDIT: I see Travis was faster ;-)

Branch pushed to git repo; I updated commit sha1. New commits:

Comment by jpflori created at 2014-02-28 10:17:23

Ok everything seems fine to me for this upgrade to get merged.
Maybe an additional commit to remove the history from newly gitified pkgs?


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2014-02-28 10:24:40

Feel free to do that if you feel strongly about it.

Comment by jpflori created at 2014-02-28 11:00:42

Changing status from needs_review to positive_review.


---

Comment by jpflori created at 2014-02-28 11:00:42

Not so strongly, but that was easy enough to modify and don't think it needs to get rereviewed, so here are the changes and let's merge this one.

I also very slightly reformatted the patch part of SPKG.txt to look more like other pkgs.

If i try to checkout, i get the following:

```
mmarco`@`artin:~/sage/sage$ ./sage -dev checkout --ticket 15873
The branch field on ticket #15873 is set to the non-existent "1a91835f99e01395b74226e185ed88f6cf26031a". Please set the field on trac to a field value.

```

Thats a bug in the sage dev scripts, apparently they can't handle SHA1 directly.


---

Comment by mmarco created at 2014-03-04 09:51:03

So, is there a solution?


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2014-03-04 13:28:20

I've released 6.2.beta3 which includes this ticket, so you can just checkout that version.  Alternatively, don't use the dev scripts (I don't use them).

Remove binary junk in gap_packages-4.7.4.tar.bz2!
There is stuff in `src/grape/bin/i686-pc-cygwin-gcc-default32/`

Comment by dimpase created at 2014-03-08 10:59:22

In guava's `PackageInfo.g` one has

```
  Autoload := false,
```

This apparently causes the issue in #15908. One possible fix for the latter would be to change to

```
  Autoload := true,
```

Dear reviewers of optional package updates: please run the appropriate tests before giving OK...
