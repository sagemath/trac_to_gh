Implementing a class corresponding to decorated permutations (permutations in which non-fixed points are assigned one of two possible colors). 

Originally defined by Postnikov in 'Total Positivity, Grassmannians, and Networks' as one of many objects in bijection with totally nonegative cells of the Grassmannian (positively oriented matroids, le-diagrams, Grassman necklaces, equivalence classes of plabic graphs).

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27286

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).
