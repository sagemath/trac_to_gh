# Issue 14016: Cleanup of symmetric function code

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14220

Original creator: zabrocki

Original creation time: 2013-03-03 20:27:23

Assignee: zabrocki

CC:  aschilling saliola chrisjamesberg

Keywords: symmetric functions, pyflakes

Recent tickets which changed the symmetric function code (potentially #5457, #13399, #13404, #13762, but maybe others) included unnecessary import statements and lines that raise warnings with pyflakes.  This ticket corrects most of these warnings plus minor cleanup of the symmetric function code.

I have added a tiny patch, trying to ensure that all tests pass in ncsf

If the bot turns green, I will give a positive review

This needs to be rebased to sage-5.9.beta0.

This applied cleanly for me so I'm setting this back to positive review.
