To construct the 1st graph (in GAP) one can do

```
LoadPackage("grape");
gg:=SpecialUnitaryGroup(4,2);
hl:=Z(2)*[ 
[0,0,1,0],
[1,1,0,0],     
[0,1,0,1],     
[0,1,1,0],     
[1,1,0,1]];
o216:=Orbit(gg,Set(hl),OnSets);
a216:=Action(gg,o216,OnSets);
h:=Stabilizer(a216,1);
re:=Filtered(Orbits(h,[1..216]),x->Length(x)=20);
G:=NullGraph(a216);
AddEdgeOrbit(G,[1,re[1][1]]);
AddEdgeOrbit(G,[1,re[2][1]]);
Print(GlobalParameters(G));
```

namely, it turns out that the vertices are the hyperbolic lines of the unitary GQ of U(4,2), and the graph is edge-transitive (if one adds field automorphism).

```
LoadPackage("grape");

that is, the permutation action in question is the action of U(4,2)=Sp(4,3)<U(4,3) on the nonsingular, w.r.t. to the Hermitean form stabilised by U(4,3), points of the 3-dimensional projective space over GF(9), and 
then one just needs an appropriate merging.
