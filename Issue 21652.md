These are examples constructed in https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07133
admitting vertex-transitive actions of U(4,2)

To construct the 1st graph (in GAP) one can do

```
LoadPackage("grape");
gg:=SpecialUnitaryGroup(4,2);
hl:=Z(2)*[ 
[0,0,1,0],
[1,1,0,0],     
[0,1,0,1],     
[0,1,1,0],     
[1,1,0,1]];
o216:=Orbit(gg,Set(hl),OnSets);
a216:=Action(gg,o216,OnSets);
h:=Stabilizer(a216,1);
re:=Filtered(Orbits(h,[1..216]),x->Length(x)=20);
G:=NullGraph(a216);
AddEdgeOrbit(G,[1,re[1][1]]);
AddEdgeOrbit(G,[1,re[2][1]]);
Print(GlobalParameters(G));
```

namely, it turns out that the vertices are the hyperbolic lines of the unitary GQ of U(4,2), and the graph is edge-transitive (if one adds field automorphism).

And to construct the 2nd graph (one of two non-isomorphic examples with these parameters):

```
LoadPackage("grape");
q:=3;
f:=Sp(4,q);
o540:=Orbit(f,Z(q)^0*[1,0,0,Z(q^2)],OnLines);; # len=540
a540:=Action(f,o540,OnLines);
h:=Stabilizer(a540,1);
oh:=Orbits(h,[1..540]);
lo:=List([8,9,10,11,12,16,19,22,23,24],x->[1,oh[x+1][1]]);
G:=EdgeOrbitsGraph(a540,lo);
Print(GlobalParameters(G));
```

that is, the permutation action in question is the action of U(4,2)=Sp(4,3)<U(4,3) on the nonsingular, w.r.t. to the Hermitean form stabilised by U(4,3), points of the 3-dimensional projective space over GF(9), and 
then one just needs an appropriate merging.

the long doctests should be fixed now.

something easy to review, please...

with #21890 done, this is very easy to review.

Nitpick:

```diff
-Returns a (216,40,4,8)-strongly regular graph from [CRS16]_
+Return a (216,40,4,8)-strongly regular graph from [CRS16]_.
```

and similar for the other function. You can set a positive review for me once that is done.

PDF docs don't build

This is not a minus sign:

```
Strongly regular graphs from orthogonal groups `O^+(6,2)` and `O^âˆ’(6,2)`
```

sorry, it didn't cross my mind that we have doctests testing doctest strings :-)

It's not a doctest testing doctest strings ;)
It a doctest for a method that builds a table of methods and inserts it in the html doc. See for instance `sage/graphs/graph.py` and the corresponding html page. 
It's very convenient to have a nice html doc. We could use it more.
