We expose one additional `libsingular` function in `sage.libs.singular.singular`:

```
sage: from sage.libs.singular.singular import get_resource                                                              
sage: get_resource('i')

AFAIK it can be deleted from both `src/bin/sage-env` and `src/sage/env.py`. `git grep SINGULARPATH` shows only those two instances of it, aside from a qepcad patch.
