According to the [gentoo patchbot](https://patchbot.sagemath.org/log/23637/Gentoo%20Base%20System/2.2/x86_64/4.4.26-gentoo/sage4/2017-08-31%2016:56:52?short) the same issue as at #20710 is occurring again. An update of glpk to the version in gentoo should fix the patchbot problems.

Maybe thinking about how to make the doctests independent of the glpk version is also worthwhile since otherwise we would need to tie the version of glpk in sage to that in gentoo in order to keep the patchbot happy, which doesn't sound like a good idea.

Thanks, tried to search for such a ticket but for some reason I only found #20710 . For some reason I find it really difficult to search trac and find the correct ticket, this is not the first time this happens to me.
