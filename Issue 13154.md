sage: if log(2)*Infinity == Infinity: print "Hello"
....: 
type = 214729600
** Hit STUB**: invalid type: is_zero() type not handled
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::runtime_error'
  what():  stub

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGABRT: An abort() occurred in Sage.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* component of Sage has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off(). You might
want to run Sage under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
Sage will now terminate.
