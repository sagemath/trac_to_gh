CC:  @kcrisman @pelegm

The two functions that query Pynac expressions' `info::flags` only work with `numeric`s and `symbol`s with domain. The rest simply returns `False`:

```
sage: (1-pi).is_negative()
False
sage: (log(1/2)).is_negative()
False
sage: e.is_positive()
False
sage: (e+1).is_positive()
False
sage: (2*e).is_positive()
False
sage: (e^3).is_positive()
False
```

UPDATE: everything above but the first works now.

Since everything apart from sums works now, let's look at what is possible with sums containing exact `numeric`s (in the Pynac sense) and constants only. The border case is if the expression is nonzero---but only at certain precision. This is impossible to handle. It is also not possible to convert to float and only check sign if the absolute result is greater some epsilon, because that could be due to precision loss in a denominator.

I'm therefore just adding the doctests here to resolve the ticket.

One logic for `b^e.is_positive()` is `if (e.is_even()) return b.is_real() and b.is_nonzero()` but `is_nonzero` was not implemented for constants until now. This is fixed in https://github.com/pynac/pynac/commit/e92febc468800e4a1457f944bb7a45e9baf0e2f6 and will be in pynac-0.7.15. We can as well put all of these doctests in this ticket too. Thanks for the report!
