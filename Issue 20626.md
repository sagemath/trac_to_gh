# Issue 20626: Complete documentation for overconvergent modular symbols

The documentation of overconvergent modular symbols could be improved on a bit. 

More specifically, I am thinking of all the places where (as a reviewer of #812) I (wuthrich) put a "mm TODO" in the code.

While there is still lots of room for improvement, I added the missing documentation pieces at the indicated spots. All doctests pass as well.

Thanks Marc. Looks like a lot of work. I am going to look at now.

I fixed a few minor issues. pdf and html compile. I running tests now.
Since I have no access to magma, I can't check the optional ones involving magma.

I get this. 


```
sage -t --long --warn-long 126.8 src/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/padics.py
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/padics.py", line 195, in sage.schemes.elliptic_curves.padics.padic_lseries
Failed example:
    L.series(3)
Expected:
    2 + 3 + 3^2 + 2*3^3 + O(3^5) + (1 + 3 + 2*3^2 + O(3^3))*T + (1 + 2*3 + O(3^2))*T^2 + O(3)*T^3 + O(3^0)*T^4 + O(T^5)
Got:
    2 + 3 + 3^2 + 2*3^3 + O(3^5) + (1 + 3 + 2*3^2 + O(3^3))*T + (1 + 2*3 + O(3^2))*T^2 + O(T^3)
```

Sorry, I tested only sage/modular/btquotients and sage/modular/pollackstevens. I have changed two docstrings in padics.py now.

The reason for this change is that there is one less "precision-like" parameter now when computing p-adic L-series using the overconvergent method. I think that this makes sense, because of how these are computed, but we can discuss if you don't agree. I could also revert it back to how it worked before, but still it wouldn't perfectly match the non-overconvergent way of handling precision.

All pass now.

Sorry, Marc that it took me a while to come back to this. Thanks again for doing all these docstrings.
