# Issue 13597: Fix facade set category initialisation

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13801

Original creator: vdelecroix

Original creation time: 2012-12-05 16:08:14

Assignee: vdelecroix

CC:  sstarosta

Keywords: category, facade

Facade sets are used in many places but there are two small errors that prevent from using it everywhere...

Here is the first error

```
class A(Parent):
    def __init__(self):
        Parent.__init__(self, facade=True, category=((FiniteEnumeratedSets(),Monoids()))
```

for which we get

```
sage: A()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: 'tuple' object has no attribute 'is_subcategory'
```


And the second conerns the behavior of .facade_for() which is better explained with a minimal example

```
class B(Parent):
    def __init__(self):
        Parent.__init__(self, category=Sets(), facade=True)
```

for which we get

```
sage: b = B()
sage: b.facade_for()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: 'B_with_category' object has no attribute '_facade_for'
```

That's now done.

I modified the behavior of facade_for() in the way it was discussed on combinat-devel (see comment:3 of Travis).

Actually, I missed one and now it's done!
