Assignee: somebody

I don't know that this belongs here, but: emacs key bindings are hard-wired in my lizard brain, and I've noticed that not all control characters work: try ^F.

Hmmm... that "^F" is meant to be "CTRL-F".

Is this a SAGE problem?

No clue.  I was hoping an expert here would know.  This could be a problem in SAGE, browser, Trac.

This is not a SAGE issue.
