```
`[0,1]\\times[0,1]`
```

for some reason doesn't render right in the [show documentation](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/plotting/sage/plot/graphics.html#sage.plot.graphics.Graphics.show).  This ticket is to fix this (and check it works in pdf too!).

I think I just reported this without even looking at the code - that would surely do it.  Shall I trust that you verified in both html and pdf?

Ran `make` and `make doc-pdf` successfully.

Checked both html and pdf; that instance of
`[0,1]\times[0,1]` now renders fine in both.

Found no other similar problem needing fixing.
