# Issue 14953: Refactor inheritance of padic polynomials and polyniomial rings

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15190

Currently, there is no single place where one could add a method so it is
available for all p-adic polynomials (this is required for #15188). This ticket
streamlines the inheritance graph, removes some unnecessary classes, and adds
docstrings in several places.
