This confirms that the last line (`External software detected for doctesting: latex`) is not written to the log file because of I/O errors:


```

The error is not there if external software are not tested:

I found a way to raise the issue from sage:


```
sage: from sage.doctest.control import DocTestDefaults, DocTestController
sage: DD = DocTestDefaults(optional=set(['sage', 'external']), logfile=tmp_filename())
sage: filename = os.path.join(SAGE_SRC, "sage", "misc", "latex.py")
sage: DC = DocTestController(DD, [filename])
sage: DC.run()
```


Thus, I added a commit with a doctest + a commit fixing the two pyflakes issues (see patchbot report).

In the doctest, I was testing that `sage -t --optional=sage,external --logfile a.log` works on a file inside the sage library containing at least one external doctest namely `sage/misc/latex.py`. Of course, this test way too much thing including all of the doctests inside of that file which may create other unrelated failures like the one obtained by Volker.

I found a much simpler way to test that the error is fixed. Indeed, running the command on a empty file raises the failure:

```
$ touch a.py
$ sage -t a.py --optional=sage,external --logfile a.log
too many failed tests, not using stored timings

```


Therefore, I will update the doctest with this instead.

Can't the line `Git branch: develop` cause a doctest error too ?
