This patch is only a first step. We need to create the 'dependencies.h' file, replace the load/dump file function with a structure which lets us interface directly, write the wrappers, etc...

New patch lets you give an input string to the isom function, and gives a string as output. Still rudimentary, but a proof of concept. Be careful calling it on invalid input, I haven't really worried about that yet.

Minor update to the previous filei, fixing the doctest quotes.

Invalid since this is an interface to an old package without copyright information and the functionality is provided by PARI anyway (but not yet exposed to Sage).
