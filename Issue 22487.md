Keywords: polymake, lp

polymake has a simple implementation of the dual simplex method, which works with polymake's quadratic extensions. 
We should make it available as a MixedIntegerLinearProgram. (Of course, there are no integer variables.)

Moving some tickets to 9.2. This is not a promise that I will be working on them.
