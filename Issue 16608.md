# Issue 16608: Implementation of the Coxeter-Knuth graph in type A

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16845

Original creator: aschilling

Original creation time: 2014-08-17 10:49:07

CC:  sage-combinat

Keywords: graph, coxeter group

This branch implements the Coxeter-Knuth graph of type A. The Coxeter-Knuth relations in this case are given by `a a+1 a \sim a+1 a a+1`, `abc \sim acb` if `b<a<c` and `abc \sim bac` if `a<c<b`.

It looks like you import dot2tex for nothing.

Oh yes! Thanks for catching this! I had latex options in the code, but Nicolas made me remove those and I forgot to remove the import. I will fix this tomorrow (as my internet right now does not allow for shh connections).

I removed the superfluous import and set Nicolas as a reviewer.
