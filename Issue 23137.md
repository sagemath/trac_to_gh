http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/constructions/linear_algebra.html#solving-systems-of-linear-equations recommends using maxima, numpy, and octave to solve a system of linear equations. We should at least demonstrate Sage's native capabilities (which are generally very fast and work much better over exact rings).
