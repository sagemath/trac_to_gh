I often get failures with one doctest in `singular/polynomial.pyx`:

I have seen this at least since the 6.5 sequence (b0 and rc0).  Not sure it was intermittent at that point.
It popped up again in the 8.4-8.7 sequences.
FWIW, the problem recurs, intermittently) if I test polynomial.pyx by itself, but in a loop (for i in a b c d...).

My current system is a fairly shiny new iMac Pro (18-core Xeon W, 128GB Ram, and 4TB SSD), so I think it's fairly speedy.  I typically build with "-j20", but I have seen this with "-j6".

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).
