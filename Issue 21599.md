Issue created by migration from Trac.

CC:  tscrim

This patch will add functions to get meet- and join-prime elements of a lattice.

Test code:


```
def join_primes_trivial(self):
    result = []
    for x in self.join_irreducibles():
        if all(self.le(x, a) or self.le(x, b) for a, b in Subsets(self, 2) if self.le(x, self.join(a, b))):
            result.append(x)
    return result

set_random_seed(42)
for _ in range(1000):
    L = Posets.RandomLattice(15, 0.99)
    if sorted(L.join_primes()) != sorted(join_primes_trivial(L)):
        L.show()
        break
    if sorted(L.meet_primes()) != sorted(join_primes_trivial(L.dual())):
        L.show()
        break
else:
    print("OK")
```

For "multiloop breaks", you could split that into a small function within `prime_elements` (which doesn't need to be doctested). Right now the code just looks somewhat fugly.

This can be done with list comprehension. But it was something like 20% slower when I tested with all 11-element lattices. I am sure that it will be much more slower with helper function.

And the complexity is encapsulated in one function with clear input and output. I admit that the for-break-else-continue -style is hard to read, but not that hard.

It takes a little bit to understand the logic, so I disagree. Although this might be one of those times where a `goto` statement is actually the best way forward.

Two other little things: Does the iteration order for `upset` matter? Considering you're doing containment checking, you should make it a `(frozen)set`. Also

```diff
-                        if m not in upset:
-                            if all(u_ in upset for u_ in
-                                   self.neighbor_out_iterator(m)):
-                                if meet_prime is not None:
-                                    break
-                                meet_prime = m
+                        if (m not in upset
+                            and all(u_ in upset for u_ in self.neighbor_out_iterator(m))):
+                            if meet_prime is not None:
+                                break
+                            meet_prime = m
```

Yep. Python is not easy when the code should be recursive and try to found a "solution" in some sense. Only good way I know is to raise an exception like `FoundSolution()`. This is not recursive, and so not that bad, but anyway not easy.

> Two other little things: Does the iteration order for `upset` matter? Considering you're doing containment checking, you should make it a `(frozen)set`. Also

Good point! Order does not matter for the validity of the code. For speed I guess it will only matter for special cases like vertically decomposable lattice.

`set` is faster. For `BooleanLattice(10)` it is about 7-times faster, and for all lattices of 11 elements about 10% faster. There is no measurable difference between `set` and `frozenset`.

Whatever. I alreaydy thinked about that, and they are both as good to me.

So, the question remains if we shall accept `break-else-continue-break-else` -structure for speed or not.

Here is a version with `and` instead of `if-if`. Because you suggested `NOTE` in #21419, I did the same here.

I still can't invent easy way to make the code more clear.

Pinging this one... When Python has no multilevel break, then it has not. We can do nothing for that.

Annoyingly, Python doesn't have a `goto` statement. However, pulling it out into a separate internal function as I originally suggested resulted in a 2x speedup:

```sage
sage: L = posets.BooleanLattice(10)
sage: %time L._hasse_diagram.prime_elements()   # My branch
CPU times: user 24 ms, sys: 4 ms, total: 28 ms
Wall time: 20.6 ms

sage: %time L._hasse_diagram.prime_elements()   # Your branch
CPU times: user 56 ms, sys: 12 ms, total: 68 ms
Wall time: 57.6 ms
```

This is due to the (much) more complicated logic of your `break`-`else` statements.

If you agree with my changes, then you can set a positive review.

I was not able to reproduce that much speedup. But anyways your version is faster, and easier to read. Thanks!

Lesson to learn for me: (internal) function call in Python is very cheap.

With beta3 I could. I just added 5 to the test. It's something we might have to update as we add more methods to `FiniteLatticePoset` because it is somewhat fragile.
