All tests pass for me for the modified files with and without optional package `lrslib`. Patchbot is green.

Also, here is what I get:


```
$ venv/bin/python3 -c 'from sage.all import *; print(polytopes.hypercube(3).volume(engine="lrs"))'
8
$ venv/bin/python3 -c 'from sage.all import *; A = matrix([[1, -1], [-1, 1]]); B = matrix([[-1, 1], [1, -1]]); matching_pennies = NormalFormGame([A, B]); print(matching_pennies.obtain_nash(algorithm="lrs"))'
[[(1/2, 1/2), (1/2, 1/2)]]
```
