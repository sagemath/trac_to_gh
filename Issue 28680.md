# Issue 28680: sagemath should not use math names with underscore when generating Latex

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28917

Keywords: latex

seen at https://ask.sagemath.org/question/49232/latex-problem-using-result-obtained-from-fricas-integrate/.

Using sagemath 8.9, when asking sagemath for latex of a math expression which contains something like `log_integral`, it generates in latex `log_integral` which does not typeset well due to underscore. Better translation would be `\logintegral`, this allows one to make a math operator using `\DeclareMathOperator{\logintegral}{log\_integral}`

But it is not possible to do this now as things stands.  Here is an example



```
sage: var('t')
sage: result=integrate(1/log(t)^2,t, algorithm="fricas")
sage: result

(log(t)*log_integral(t) - t)/log(t)

sage: latex(result)

\frac{\log\left(t\right) log_integral\left(t\right) - t}{\log\left(t\right)}

```


The latex above would be better as



```
sage: latex(result)

\frac{\log\left(t\right) \logintegral\left(t\right) - t}{\log\left(t\right)}

```


even though `\logintegral` is not known to Latex, it can be made a known math name using `\DeclareMathOperator` as shown above.

Changing component from translations to symbolics.

I changed the Latex name of `log_integral` to `\operatorname{log\_integral}` so that the resulting Latex code can be pasted directly into a Latex file, without needing to add any macro definitions. (This is the same approach that was already used in the Latex name of `exp_polar`.) I made a similar fix to the Latex name of `log_integral_offset`, which was the only other place that I found this problem in the sage source.

Thank you for fixing this. There is just a small problem with the backslashes in the docstring. These need to be escaped, or (preferably) the docstring should be changed to a raw string:

```diff
     def __init__(self):
-        """
+        r"""
         See the docstring for ``Function_log_integral``.
```


Other than that, this looks good to me. I could not find other instances of this latex problem in Sage, either.

Oops. Thanks for the correction. I also fixed a typo in a docstring (`Function_log_integral-offset` -> `Function_log_integral_offset`).
