As discussed in #18099, there is something wrong with the actual way of setting `LinearCodes` in the category framework.
This should be fixed.

David, what's the status on this? The description doesn't say what specifically should be fixed, so I can't check.

If I remember correctly, we discussed that with Vincent almost a year ago at SD66.
However, I can't recollect any specific details. I checked my notes, and found nothing related to it.
Sorry, I'm not really helpful here...

Well, I managed to find this out!
See: http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18099, comments 24 to 34 (especially 24 to 26).
It's related to this line:

`Element = type(facade_for).an_element()` (l. 877) which is completely wrong.
