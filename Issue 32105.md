# Issue 32105: Multiplication of NoneType and SymmetricGroupElement causes segmentation fault

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32342

Original creator: @tniessen

Original creation time: 2021-08-06 14:42:05

Attempting to multiply `None` with a `SymmetricGroupElement` crashes due to a segmentation fault:


```python
None * (SymmetricGroup(5))([(1, 2, 3), (4, 5)])
```


The last lines of the output:

```
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* module has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off().
Python will now terminate.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
```

This works fine for me on the latest develop version of sage.

On which version of sage, which operating system, which CPU do you see that ?

I believe I am using the latest stable release on Linux on an Intel i7 11th gen:


```
$ sage --version
SageMath version 9.3, Release Date: 2021-05-09
$ lsb_release -a 2>/dev/null | grep 'Description:'
Description: Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS
$ uname -svmo
Linux #38~20.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Thu Jun 17 14:14:18 UTC 2021 x86_64 GNU/Linux
$ lscpu | grep 'Model name:'
Model name: 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-11700 @ 2.50GHz
```


In the same terminal:


```bash
$ echo 'None * (SymmetricGroup(5))([(1, 2, 3), (4, 5)])' | sage 2>&1 >/dev/null | tail -n1
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
```


I can also reproduce this on CoCalc (Jupyter notebook with the [SageMath](SageMath) 9.3 kernel).
