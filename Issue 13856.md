Keywords: pari precision

This fails on a 32-bit machine (Sage-5.6):

```
sage: EllipticCurve([0, -1, 0, -360796668980, 83414685883377400]).minimal_quadratic_twist()
```

because it results in pari_curve() being called on some curves with no attempt to catch insufficient precision.

Two things needs fixing:  (1) Making sure that all calls to pari_curve() deal with this precision issue properly;  (2) a better implementation of minimal_quadratic_twist(), for example if the conductor is square-free then there is no need to do so much rwork as is currently done.  Additionally, when j(E)=0 or 1728 the curve returned is a minimal twist, but not necessarily a quadratic twist, so the documentation (or function name, or something) needs correcting.

I see two possibilities here:  either rename this function `minimal_twist()` and return (as it does now) a curve which may be a sextic or quartic twist when j=0 or j=1728;   or keep this name and be more restrictive for those j-invariants so that the returned curve literally is a quadratic twist.  A third possibility is to have both named functions, doing the same thing unless j=0 or j=1728.

I am CC-ing Chris W since the only place where this function is used (according to `search_src()`) is in `sha_tate.py`, line 540, and whatever we do must be compatible with what is needed there!

Of course this is in addition to adding one line to return self of `self.conductor().is_squarefree()`.

Looking more carefully at the code (I am not embarrassed that I wrote it but could not remember) I see that for j=0 and j=1728 the curve returned is always a quadratic twist.  So the "additionally" part of the ticket's current description is incorrect.

If you agree with me on that (and a second opinion would be welcome!) then that just leaves the first part which I can easily implement by adding one line.

I have implemented the small improvement (do nothing if the conductor is square-free) with a new doctest, and also expanded on the documentation in the exceptional cases j=0, 1728 to remove any confusion, with an example!

I decided not to implement a new `minimal_twist()` function since 

```
EllipticCurve(j=E.j_invariant())
```

does that.  But I could.

I don't know, I thought that not warnings were produced when building the docs but have forgotten.
