Presently `hadamard_matrix()` only returns matrices obtained by just two of several constructions Sage knows. It should use all Sage has.

I don't think any deprecation is needed, just add more constructions.

Matteo, thanks. Have you run tests? (just checking). Run `make ptestlong` 
on your branch, if you didn't.

Changed the `hadamard_matrix` method to avoid checking that the matrix is normalized, since it may not be.
