Keywords: theta subgroup modular forms hecke triangle

Support for modular forms for the Hecke triangle group corresponding to n=infinity
(the theta subgroup). All relevant spaces are defined and the basic generators/functions work.
Laurent expansions, (fast) function evaluation and differential operators work.

The ticket also adds corresponding + further doctests/documentation.

However no basis can be generated so far and no coordinate vectors work.
That's because the situation is different since there are now two cusps with
two corresponding generators. 

In particular the limit of the generator f_rho tends to 1 and the generator
for n=infinity is instead E4 which is the limit of f_rho^n.

Note that only functions which are meromorphic and meromorphic at the cusps are considerd.
In particular theta^8 lies in the corresponding space (smaller powers are not meromorphic at -1).
Also note that limits of functions/coefficients as n tends to infinity are usually given by
the corresponding function in the theta subgroup.

This looks good. I have reviewed the changes originally introduced in #16839, too. Several corrections to the latter have been made. I.e. #16839 should be closed as invalid or similar after this.

As soon as the buildbot has run this, this can be changed to positive review.
