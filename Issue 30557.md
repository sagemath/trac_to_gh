having `CONDA_PREFIX` nonempty does not mean that `conda` is active, but `./configure` thinks it does.

Could you elaborate? 

Runnning `conda deactivate` does remove `CONDA_PREFIX` for me.

the box in question also has
something in `/anaconda/bin` or
something like `/anaconda3/bin`, maybe that is why.

Moving to 9.4, as 9.3 has been released.
