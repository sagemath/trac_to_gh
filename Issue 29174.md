this has caused a [breakage of jupyter notebook/server](https://groups.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!msg/sage-devel/mWTD0_iBwKc/SDZa965UAQAJ). Apparently some of its dependencies get  "blessed"
by `./sage -b`, but no longer get blessed by `make build`.

        This appears to be a serious server configuration error. I don't see any ticket in either this beta or the previous one that would cause this. Am I missing some new configuration step? Sage built and runs just fine.

This broke `sage -b`: it wants to run `make` in a directory with no `Makefile`.
