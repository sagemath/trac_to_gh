It also doesn't terminate for other primes then 29, but here is a more detailed example of the case 29 which should illustrate everything

The sourcecode which determines the basis is currently:


```
def basis(self):
    try:
        return self.__basis_cache
    except AttributeError:
        pass
    level = self.level()
    bound = self.__M.hecke_bound()
    dim = self.__M.rank()
    if dim == 0:
        basis = []
    elif dim == 1:
        basis = [self.hecke_operator(1)]
    else:
        span = [self.hecke_operator(n) for n in range(1, bound+1) if not self.is_anemic() or gcd(n, level) == 1]
        rand_max = 5
        while True:
            # Project the full Hecke module to a random submodule to ease the HNF reduction.
            v = (ZZ**dim).random_element(x=rand_max)
            proj_span = matrix([T.matrix()*v for T in span])._clear_denom()[0]
            proj_basis = proj_span.hermite_form()
            if proj_basis[dim-1] == 0:
                # We got unlucky, choose another projection.
                rand_max *= 2
                continue
            # Lift the projected basis to a basis in the Hecke algebra.
            trans = proj_span.solve_left(proj_basis)
            basis = [sum(c*T for c,T in zip(row,span) if c != 0) for row in trans[:dim]]
            break

    self.__basis_cache = tuple(basis)
    return basis
```


Now dim equals 44 and the hecke bound 140 in this example:

```
sage: G29=Gamma1(29)
sage: M=ModularSymbols(G29,2)
sage: m=M.cuspidal_subspace()
sage: m.rank()
44
sage: m.hecke_bound()
140
```


Now we see that the hecke algebra has rank 22 over ZZ

```
sage: HA=m.hecke_algebra()
sage: span = [HA.hecke_operator(n) for n in range(1, 140+1) if not HA.is_anemic() or gcd(n, 29) == 1]
sage: (ZZ^(44^2)).span([i.matrix().list() for i in span])
Free module of degree 1936 and rank 22 over Integer Ring
Echelon basis matrix:
22 x 1936 dense matrix over Rational Field
```

So as the comment say's we are unlucky since proj_basis[43] will always be zero since the hecke algebra has only rank 22

```
            if proj_basis[dim-1] == 0:
                # We got unlucky, choose another projection.
                rand_max *= 2
                continue
```

I suspect there is a problem in that the rank of m is 44 over QQ. But that the rank of the hecke algebra will be the dimension of m as a complex vector space so dim should actually be half of what it is now.

I don't know enough of modular symbols yet to know how it should be done in other weigth's and other modular groups but I suspect there will be problems there also.

Reawakening this moribund ticket: I just ran this in 7.3 and the behavior appears to be unchanged.

There is some other code for bases in the same file which doesn't seem to suffer from the same issue:

CC'ing davidloeffler since he appears to have worked on some of this code.
