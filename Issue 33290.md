# Issue 33290: Converting p-adic extension element back to base ring raises an error

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33527

```
sage: K = Qq(25, names='a')
sage: K0 = K.base_ring()
sage: K0(K(1))
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded in comparison
```

I think at some point the element constructor for `K0` tries to convert into its base ring, which is `K0` itself.  Instead, we probably need to create an explicit section of the inclusion of `K0` into `K`.
