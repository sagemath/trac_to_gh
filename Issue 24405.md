# Issue 24405: remove old Sun workarounds

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: dimpase

Original creation time: 2018-02-02 10:18:27

The remains of the commit 29fd8e9662c from 2008 should be removed, it does not work on modern gcc. Basically it is the following piece from `src/sage/combinat/partitions_c.h`:

```
#if defined(__sun)
#include <ieeefp.h>
int isinf(double x) { return !finite(x) && x==x; }
#endif
```

that should go.

Do you have a branch here? If not, I can also have a look.

Working on it. Will have something by the end of the day.

I would give `solaris_fixes.h` the benefit of the doubt in the sense that keeping it doesn't break anything and removing it might break on some other Solaris systems.

And for `partitions_c.cc`: I think that those functions aren't actually used. There seems to be a lot of stuff in that file which isn't used.

I just kept this one part which is certainly OK. See #24667 for `partitions_c.cc`

Or maybe we should just keep this to deal with `solaris_fixes.h`

You can't just remove the file `solaris_fixes.h`. You also should stop including it.

Right, I forgot about this in my branch.
(it must be there, I should have cherry-picked more carefully)
the only include is in src/sage/ext/interpreters/wrapper_cdf.pyx, I gather.

By the way, with this extra it builds and starts.

oops, it's `src/sage_setup/autogen/interpreters/specs/cdf.py`
(the former one is autogenerated)

I've updated my branch accordingly, just in case.
