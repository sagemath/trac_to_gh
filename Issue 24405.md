The remains of the commit 29fd8e9662c from 2008 should be removed, it does not work on modern gcc. Basically it is the following piece from `src/sage/combinat/partitions_c.h`:

```
#if defined(__sun)
#include <ieeefp.h>
int isinf(double x) { return !finite(x) && x==x; }
#endif
```

that should go.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24642
