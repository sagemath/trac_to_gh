Shouldn't python3-venv then be better included in the base image, then installing it manually in the build workflow?

Okay, then why add it manually in the build workflow? For testing purposes this is fine, but I guess it should be removed before merging this ticket.

Makes sense. Then I would propose to squash the current commits and remove python3-venv from the build workflow in a new commit. Then you could cherry pick the squashed commit in other tickets that depend on this one here.

Or at least add a comment in the workflow that it should be removed in the future.

Otherwise this looks good to me.
