This ticket implements the following changes to the Macaulay2 interface:

- Naming of Macaulay2/interface elements is improved.

  The constructor for interface elements now correctly handles the `name` parameter (which previously got ignored in some cases). For example, this works now:
  {{{
  sage: A = macaulay2(ZZ['x,y,z'], name='A')
  sage: A.name()
  'A'
  }}}

  Moreover, Macaulay2Elements can now be renamed, as `name()` was implemented. In particular, this works for polynomial rings, so the `sage0`, etc., identifiers can be avoided in the Macaulay2 output. For example:
  {{{
  sage: S = macaulay2(QQ['x,y'])
  sage: S.name()
  'sage0'
  sage: R = S.name("R")
  sage: R.name()
  'R'
  sage: R.vars().cokernel().resolution()
   1      2      1
  R  <-- R  <-- R  <-- 0

  0      1      2      3
  }}}

- The `_contains` operator (i.e. `in`) is implemented:
  {{{
  sage: '"x"' in macaulay2('hashTable {"x" => 1}')
  True
  }}}

- Seeds are implemented.

Moreover, this ticket provides small fixes:

- The syntax `..` for defining a polynomial ring can now be used more than just once:
  {{{
  sage: macaulay2.ring('QQ', '[a_0..a_2,b..<d,f]').vars()
  | a_0 a_1 a_2 b c f |
  }}}

- Tab completion is slightly improved to avoid the use of global variables.

The first two commits fixing some doctests are from #27848. To run the tests on all files that have optional Macaulay2 doctests, you can use:

```
sage -t --long --optional=sage,macaulay2 $(grep -i "optional.*macaulay2" -r src/sage -l | paste -sd " " -)
```

Tested using Macaulay2 1.13.

Looks good to me.

I have rebased the branch on top of the branch of #27848. And then squashed the commits into a single one.

I am setting this to positive.
