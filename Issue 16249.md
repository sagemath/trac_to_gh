Keywords: crystals, tableaux, ascii art

Currently we have the following:

```
sage: C = crystals.Tableaux(['B',6], shape=[1]*5)
sage: ascii_art(C.module_generators[0])
5 # 4 # 3 # 2 # 1
```

whereas this should be displayed as a tableau:

```
sage: ascii_art(C.module_generators[0].to_tableau())
  1
  2
  3
  4
  5
```
