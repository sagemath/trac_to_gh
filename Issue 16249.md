# Issue 16249: CrystalOfTableaux doesn't override _ascii_art_()

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: tscrim

Original creation time: 2014-06-16 18:51:20

Assignee: sage-combinat

CC:  sage-combinat bsalisbury1

Keywords: crystals, tableaux, ascii art

Currently we have the following:

```
sage: C = crystals.Tableaux(['B',6], shape=[1]*5)
sage: ascii_art(C.module_generators[0])
5 # 4 # 3 # 2 # 1
```

whereas this should be displayed as a tableau:

```
sage: ascii_art(C.module_generators[0].to_tableau())
  1
  2
  3
  4
  5
```
