`adams_operator` was added at the level of bialgebras and is defined as `\mu^{n-1} \circ \Delta^{n-1}` however in symmetric functions the method `adams_operation` is an alias to `frobenius`.  Since this is confusing.  We propose removing `adams_operation` as an alias for `frobenius`.  `adams_operation` was added in #14775, `adams_operator` will be added in #18678.

The documentation explains: The `n`-th Frobenius operator is also the `n`-th Adams operator of the `\Lambda`-ring of symmetric functions over the integers.  This does not seem to agree with what we found in a paper by Aguiar and Lauve "The characteristic polynomial of the Adams operators on graded connected Hopf algebras" which says the Adams operators are the "Hopf powers or Sweedler powers" and it gives the definition that was defined at the level of bialgebras.

Good point about the conflicting terminology. I don't mind removing these aliases (but I fear I have no time whatsoever to actually do any of the job myself).

Please keep the comment about the Adams operator of the lambda-ring. That at least is correct.

Also there is a similar problem with QSym.

Thanks Darij.  Jean-Baptiste is here visiting and we wanted to check with you that it is ok to remove the aliases.
Can you explain how the terminology is correct?  What are we taking as the definition of "Adams operator of the lambda-ring"?

I see now.  Both operations are Adams operators.
`frobenius` is the Adam's operator for the bialgebra `p_r \circ p_n = p_{rn}` and `\Delta^{\circ}(p_n) = p_n \otimes p_n`.  Thanks.  We will try to make that clear.

LGTM. Do the doctests agree?

I positively hope noone has used the aliases yet, since I have no idea how deprecation works.

```
+        The Frobenius operator is the Adam's operator for the bialgebra
+        `p_r \circ p_n = p_{rn}` and `\Delta^{\circ}(p_n) = p_n \otimes p_n`.
```

That's wrong. I think the `n`-th Adams operator of this bialgebra would send `p_k` to `p_{k^n}`. 
I also don't think that this is a good way to understand the Frobenius.
