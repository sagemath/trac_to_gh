```
sage: A=matrix(GF(2),[[1,0],[0,1]])
sage: A.set_immutable()
sage: loads(dumps(A)).is_immutable()
False
```


from `explain_pickle(dumps(A))` it looks like the pickling routine for `sage.matrix.matrix_mod2_dense` is just a little too naive. For several other base rings immutability is preserved.

It's probably a simple fix in case anyone would like to try to do it for Sage 8.4 (which I believe will be accepting new fixes for ~1 week).

I'm afraid it could be a bit of work: You need to store a new value in the pickle, so this possibly needs a new format for pickling these matrices. Some care needs to be taken that old pickles are still read correctly. When I made the ticket I did take a look if I could fix it easily and at the time I concluded it was a bit more work/took a little more expertise than I had available.

It should just be a matter of appending on another optional value `immutable=True` to the `unpickle_matrix_mod2_dense_v1` (or maybe call it `v2` with an `register_unpickle_override`) and just add the extra input of the `_is_immutable` to the corresponding `__reduce__`. So I did that on this branch.
