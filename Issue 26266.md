In Sage 8.3 we get the following (wrong) answer:


```
sage: var('t')
sage: wp = QQ[t](t^2+t+1).roots(QQbar)[0][0]
sage: Kw.<wp>=NumberField(wp.minpoly(), embedding=wp)
sage: R.<x,y> = Kw[]
sage: z = 1
sage: f = y * (y + (-wp - 1)) * x * (x - 1) * (x - y) * (x + (-wp - 1)*y - 1) * (x + (-wp - 1)*y + (wp))
sage: from sage.schemes.curves import zariski_vankampen as zvk
sage: zvk.fundamental_group(f)
Finitely presented group < x0, x1, x2, x3, x5 | x2*x1*x2^-1*x1^-1, x1*x0*x1^-1*x0^-1, x5*x2*x5^-1*x2^-1, x0^-1*x3*x0*x3^-1, x0^-1*x2*x0*x2^-1, x1*x3*x1^-1*x3^-1, x5^-1*x0*x5*x0^-1, x3^-1*x5*x3*x5^-1, x1*x5*x1^-1*x5^-1 >
```

It must be wrong because the abelianized must have rank 7, so it must have at least 7 generators.

Note that Sage 8.1 used to give right answers.

Anyways, I think I did find the problem. When computing the braids corresponding to each segment, the endpoints are represented by floating point numbers, which may cause some errors. Using algebraic numbers for this seems to solve the issue.

```
This combines some pep8 fixes, getting rid of a symbolic variable,
using `z` to clarify `f`, and combining two `.subs` into a single one.

Yes, but on the other hand, the other minor change I made that computes radical of the polynomial before computing the discriminant would make things faster, so overall the change could actually be faster.

Seems the order of the elements in `disc` can vary.

Maybe exactifying the elements of disc and sorting them would fix that:

```

        sage: Kw.<wp> = NumberField(wp.minpoly(), embedding=wp)

        sage: z = -wp - 1

        sage: from sage.schemes.curves import zariski_vankampen as zvk
        sage: g = f.subs({x: x + 2*y})
        sage: disc = zvk.discrim(g)

Yes, that is what I think too. The failing doctest relies on the order of the roots of the discriminant being fixed, which apparently might not be depending on the architecture (as the failing doctest shows). Samuel's proposal makes more sense.
