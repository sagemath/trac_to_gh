# Issue 26266: Numerical glitch causes error in computation of fundamental group of curves

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/26503

In Sage 8.3 we get the following (wrong) answer:



```
sage: var('t')
sage: wp = QQ[t](t^2+t+1).roots(QQbar)[0][0]
sage: Kw.<wp>=NumberField(wp.minpoly(), embedding=wp)
sage: R.<x,y> = Kw[]
sage: z = 1
sage: f = y * (y + (-wp - 1)) * x * (x - 1) * (x - y) * (x + (-wp - 1)*y - 1) * (x + (-wp - 1)*y + (wp))
sage: from sage.schemes.curves import zariski_vankampen as zvk
sage: zvk.fundamental_group(f)
Finitely presented group < x0, x1, x2, x3, x5 | x2*x1*x2^-1*x1^-1, x1*x0*x1^-1*x0^-1, x5*x2*x5^-1*x2^-1, x0^-1*x3*x0*x3^-1, x0^-1*x2*x0*x2^-1, x1*x3*x1^-1*x3^-1, x5^-1*x0*x5*x0^-1, x3^-1*x5*x3*x5^-1, x1*x5*x1^-1*x5^-1 >
```


It must be wrong because the abelianized must have rank 7, so it must have at least 7 generators.

Note that Sage 8.1 used to give right answers.

Anyways, I think I did find the problem. When computing the braids corresponding to each segment, the endpoints are represented by floating point numbers, which may cause some errors. Using algebraic numbers for this seems to solve the issue.

So this change will likely slow things down, but it will make things more numerically stable (as evidenced by this example).

One thing that should be changed:

```diff

+    TESTS:
 
-        # Check that # 26503 is fixed
+    Check that :trac:`26503` is fixed::
```

Pushing the suggestion by Travis Scrimshaw a bit further, I would change

```
    TESTS::

        # Check that # 26503 is fixed
        sage: var('t')
        sage: wp = QQ[t](t^2+t+1).roots(QQbar)[0][0]
        sage: Kw.<wp>=NumberField(wp.minpoly(), embedding=wp)
        sage: R.<x,y> = Kw[]
        sage: z = 1
        sage: f = y * (y + (-wp - 1)) * x * (x - 1) * (x - y) * (x + (-wp - 1)*y - 1) * (x + (-wp - 1)*y + (wp))
        sage: from sage.schemes.curves import zariski_vankampen as zvk
        sage: g = f.subs({x:x+y})
        sage: g = g.subs({x:x+y})
        sage: disc = zvk.discrim(g)
        sage: segs = zvk.segments(disc)
        sage: segs[16]
        (0.577350269189626*I, 0.500000000000000 + 0.288675134594813*I)
        sage: zvk.braid_in_segment(g, *segs[16])  # optional - sirocco
        s0*s1*s3*s5*s1^-1*s0^-1*s3^-1
```

to the following, if you agree it means the same (please double check):

```
    TESTS:

    Check that :trac:`26503` is fixed::
        
        sage: wp = QQ['t']([1, 1, 1]).roots(QQbar)[0][0]
        sage: Kw.<wp> = NumberField(wp.minpoly(), embedding=wp)
        sage: R.<x, y> = Kw[]
        sage: z = -wp - 1
        sage: f = y*(y + z)*x*(x - 1)*(x - y)*(x + z*y - 1)*(x + z*y + wp)
        sage: from sage.schemes.curves import zariski_vankampen as zvk
        sage: g = f.subs({x: x + 2*y})
        sage: disc = zvk.discrim(g)
        sage: segs = zvk.segments(disc)
        sage: segs[16]
        (0.577350269189626*I, 0.500000000000000 + 0.288675134594813*I)
        sage: zvk.braid_in_segment(g, *segs[16])  # optional - sirocco
        s0*s1*s3*s5*s1^-1*s0^-1*s3^-1
```

This combines some pep8 fixes, getting rid of a symbolic variable,
using `z` to clarify `f`, and combining two `.subs` into a single one.

Yes, but on the other hand, the other minor change I made that computes radical of the polynomial before computing the discriminant would make things faster, so overall the change could actually be faster. 

Samuel: I think your change is better. I will push a commit with it tomorrow.

A blank line is needed between `::` and the code block.

Also, please consider simplifying

```
        sage: g = f.subs({x:x+y})
        sage: g = g.subs({x:x+y})
```

into

```
        sage: g = f.subs({x: x + 2*y})
```

There is a sign problem, not only a matter of tolerance..

Comment by slelievre created at 2019-01-20 11:50:50

Seems the order of the elements in `disc` can vary.

Maybe exactifying the elements of disc and sorting them would fix that:

```
        sage: wp = QQ['t']([1, 1, 1]).roots(QQbar)[0][0]
        sage: Kw.<wp> = NumberField(wp.minpoly(), embedding=wp)
        sage: R.<x, y> = Kw[]
        sage: z = -wp - 1
        sage: f = y*(y + z)*x*(x - 1)*(x - y)*(x + z*y - 1)*(x + z*y + wp)
        sage: from sage.schemes.curves import zariski_vankampen as zvk
        sage: g = f.subs({x: x + 2*y})
        sage: disc = zvk.discrim(g)
        sage: for a in disc: a.exactify()
        sage: disc = sorted(disc)
        sage: segs = zvk.segments(disc)
        sage: segs[16]  # abs tol 1e-16
        (0.577350269189626*I, 0.500000000000000 + 0.288675134594813*I)
```

Yes, that is what I think too. The failing doctest relies on the order of the roots of the discriminant being fixed, which apparently might not be depending on the architecture (as the failing doctest shows). Samuel's proposal makes more sense.

Patchbot seems to have trouble with it, plus one of them is getting an error with `sirocco`:

```

---

Comment by slelievre created at 2019-01-24 09:46:42

Order seems to depend on the platform, so we can't rely on `segs[16]` and we need a better doctest.


---

Comment by mmarco created at 2019-02-20 18:01:20

Can you check if the discrepancy on the order appears on `disc` or `segs` ?

Anyways, maybe the right thing to do about this doctest is to be explicit and give the specific segment to test?


---

Comment by tscrim created at 2019-02-20 20:36:47

What precisely is that part of the doctest suppose to be testing?


---

Comment by mmarco created at 2019-02-20 20:47:06

It is testing the computation of the braid along the segment. The segments are created from the Voronoi diagram of the points in disc. We compute them all, and pick a specific one (where the bug shows up) and test it. The problem seems to be that the orderof the computed segments seems to deppend on the platform, so we are picking a different one on 32 bits, and get different results.


---

Comment by tscrim created at 2019-02-20 20:52:16

So if the bug is showing up in that specific segment, perhaps the thing to do is isolate that segment, maybe by checking if that segment is in `segs` and then passing it to `braid_in_segments`?


---

Comment by tscrim created at 2019-02-20 20:52:47

Ah, wait, that won't work outright because of the numerical noise.


---

Comment by tscrim created at 2019-02-20 20:56:21

Perhaps instead of that specific segment, we check

```
s0*s1*s3*s5*s1^-1*s0^-1*s3^-1 in [zvk.braid_in_segment(g,s) for s in segs]
```

I guess we could then get the index of that braid in the corresponding list and then check the segment itself (if you also want to show that output).

Can someone with a 32-bit machine retest this for completeness?

No problem. Thank you for doing that.

This looks good now on 32bit, see https://patchbot.sagemath.org/log/26503/debian/9.7/i686/4.9.0-7-686/tmonteil-debian-stretch-32/2019-03-21%2013:03:07.

There is an error for the file `src/sage/tests/books/computational-mathematics-with-sagemath/graphique_doctest.py` but it also exists for ticket 0, see https://patchbot.sagemath.org/ticket/0/ so it is unrelated to this ticket.
