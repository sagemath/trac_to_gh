Keywords: tensor product, free modules

Tensor products of combinatorial free modules still use an old version of
cartesian product. As a consequence extracting a coefficient is not possible:

```
sage: F = CombinatorialFreeModule(ZZ, [1,2]); F.__custom_name = "F"
sage: G = CombinatorialFreeModule(ZZ, [3,4]); G.__custom_name = "G"
sage: T = tensor([F, G]); T
sage: T.basis()[(1,3)].coefficient((1,3))
...
NotImplementedError:
```
I fix that. As a side effect, this change the result of `an_element` so that I
have to fix a few doctests.

Moreover, building the tensor of two infinite dimensional FM now raises a correct
warning:

```
sage: F = CombinatorialFreeModule(ZZ, NN)
sage: T = tensor([F, F]); T
Free module generated by Non negative integer semiring over Integer Ring ⊗ Free module generated by Non negative integer semiring over Integer Ring
sage: T.an_element()

  warn("Sage is not able to determine whether the factors of "
2*B[0] ⊗ B[1] + B[0] ⊗ B[0] + 3*B[0] ⊗ B[2] + B[42] ⊗ B[42]
```
I'm hiding this by asking only finite dim FM.
