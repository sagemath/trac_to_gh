# Issue 21760: Fix the check for Littlewood-Richardson tableaux

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: aschilling

Original creation time: 2016-11-30 05:22:27

CC:  tscrim j.levinson

Keywords: tableaux, Littlewood-Richardson

Currently

```
sage: sage.combinat.lr_tableau.is_littlewood_richardson([[2],[3]],[3,3])
True
```

whereas this should return False. This is due to the fact that in the code the alphabet of the constructed subwords is not specified.

One little thing for Python3, you should wrap `list(range(start, stop))`. Once that is changed, you can set a positive review on my behalf.
