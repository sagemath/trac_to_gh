Thanks to Stephen Montgomery-Smith's excellent work maintaining the port at http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/ports/math/sage/ we are nearly there; this ticket would be to allow someone to download a Sage tarball on FreeBSD and (with appropriate prerequisites) type `make` and have it build and work. 

Since  #14406 and #14447 show us how to do it for adding Cygwin, we could probably cut and paste much of those.

I am having some significant troubles building sage-5.9.beta5.  It is due to the fact that there is more than one version of the compiler being used, and various libraries either being built or not being built, or linkers getting pre-built libraries from the wrong place.  The exact nature of the error depends upon whether I use the FreeBSD versions of gcc-4.7 and atlas or the versions that come with sage.  Both give errors, but different errors.  I know that given time I can work it out, but I don't have time right now.

For this reason, when the release version of sage-5.9 comes out, I am unlikely to upgrade the sage port.  We should delay in adding FreeBSD as a supported platform.

Also, for ANY version of the gcc-4.7 compiler to work (either the one that comes with FreeBSD, or the one that comes with sage), the following patch is needed for FreeBSD:

We already discussed that on sage-devel (and John is aware of that);  not sure whether there's already a ticket, but IIRC Jean-Pierre also fixed that, so he'll know...

Yes we discussed the eclib issue extensively on sage-devel and John is aware of it.
Not sure though he already commited anything upstream.

I'll be in Warwick in two weeks for the FLINT workshop, so if that can give him enough motivation to push a patch :)

I had similar issues in the past with R on the Skynet Solaris machines; at some point, an R script (not Sage's `spkg-install`!) messed up `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, such that an outdated version of `libgcc_s` got picked up (although I don't recall whether that led to *`libgfortran`* failing to load) .

There were some old instructions that pjeremy had on how to build sage, and some of those are still necessary.

1.  FreeBSD comes with a totally incompatible version of make, so you have to link make to gmake in $SAGE_ROOT/local/bin.

2.  You also have to build the FreeBSD version of gcc47 and atlas.  And you need to put wrappers to gcc, gfortran and g++ in SAGE_ROOT/local/bin.

3.  I did try building the gcc that comes with sage, and that worked.  But first it has to build mpir, and unfortunately the standard gcc that comes with FreeBSD-8.x broke.  I haven't tried clang which comes with FreeBSD-9.x.  gcc46 was capable of building mpir, but it seemed like a bad deal to build gcc46 just to build one of the prerequisites for building the sage version of gcc.

4.  The sage version of atlas failed to work.  I didn't explore this issue too far, because the FreeSBD version of atlas works.  But it might well be #9600, so don't close it yet.

The need for a GNU make is already documented in the source install guide, of course it would be nice to add pointers on how to actually install it on FreeBSD.

So I've relaunched builds on the two virtual machines running FreeBSD on GCC Compile Farm, one is FreeBSD 8.3 amd64, the other FreeBSD 9.0 x86.
Here is what I had to do to get Sage 5.9 to build so far, mostly on the 8.3 amd64 system (not finished yet), ATLAS failed on the 9.0 x86 system so some things might be different:
* install usual prereqs (e.g. gmake),
* Sage installed its GCC 4.7.2.p1 on both systems, no problems doing so,
* force iconv installation to let R build,
* use upstream int64_t fix for eclib,
* use ATLAS 3.10.1.p1 from #14605, this worked fine on the 8.3 system, but segfaults during tuning (more precisely running "xdfindCE -f res/atlas_cacheedge.h" to determine cache edge, IIRC it used to compile fine on a previous attempt, surely with a different version of GCC compiled by Sage, surely 4.6.3, I've tried to lower optimization levels to build the pieces involved in xdfindCE without success yet, when I try to run it under gdb it just kicks me out of the virtual machine)
* use pycrypto fix from #12399,
* elliptic_curve spkg fails because of an sqlite I/O error, surely because of NFS,
* I've not used python fix from #12400, I'll give it a shot without the fix, but that will surely fail to run "sage -t  -force_lib "devel/sage/sage/parallel/decorate.py"" as indicated at http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/12400#comment:2

I received a suggestion for the FreeBSD port of sage, to use gcc46, and add to the make environment SAGE_INSTALL_GCC=no.  This way sage doesn't build its own gcc-4.7, and builds with the gcc-4.6 that comes with FreeBSD.

Could you explain a bit further, i.e., which parts of Sage are affected by this?

(It would for example be easy to add this flag when building Sage library extension modules, and in some `spkg-install` files.)

Or in other words, what exactly is broken now?

leif:  to be honest, I don't know the answer to your questions.

First, I don't know what a linker script is.

Secondly, as to what is broken - in the FreeBSD port of sage, I have a wrapper script for gcc that looks something like this:


```/bin/sh

# This is a wrapper to redirect compiler invokations to the port of gcc that
# contains fortran.  LDFLAGS needs to be added so that the linker knows where
# to find the dynamic libraries.

# If the compiler is invoked with the argument "-v", adding LDFLAGS to the
# arguments results in an error which stops some packages being built.

if [ "x$*" = "x-v" ]; then
  exec %%CC%% "$@"
else
  exec %%CC%% %%LDFLAGS%% -Wl,--copy-dt-needed-entries "$@"
fi
```


The `%%CC%%` and `%%LDFLAGS%%%` are replaced by a `sed` script to create three scripts called `gcc`, `g++` and `gfortran`, which are placed in `${SAGE_ROOT}/local/bin`.

As I said, I don't know what a linker script is - is it something like my bin scripts?

I am trying to understand how the linking to Cephes-provided functions is meant to work
(we probably only need cpow and clog from there, but still).
The rest in fact looks OK - I am able to build a functioning version of Sage 7.6
(modulo the said issue, which causes a couple of hundred failing tests---no wonder).
