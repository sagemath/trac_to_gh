I think you forgot to include the references in `references/index.rst`

The references do already exist somewhere inside sage (`git grep` will tell you where). Moving them to the master ref file is not the objective here.

Typo `\leg`, also I think `n` and `k` should be code formatted since they are input variables (you can also change the inequalities to be code ```1 <= k <= n```. Additionally, I think you should put the definition in the function description.
