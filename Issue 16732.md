The error message is consistent with what Python gives:

```
sage: D = {}
sage: D[0]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
KeyError                                  Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-2-b088d10b34b5> in <module>()
----> 1 D[Integer(0)]

KeyError: 0
```

so I would close it as "invalid" (not a bug).

Interestingly, `KeyError` uses the `repr()` of its argument to show the exception, while other exceptions use the `str()`, note the extra `'` around the last `0`:

```
sage: raise ValueError("0")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-5-eae8cf826a55> in <module>()
----> 1 raise ValueError("0")

ValueError: 0
sage: raise KeyError("0")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
KeyError                                  Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-6-97c3d5eafb80> in <module>()
----> 1 raise KeyError("0")

KeyError: '0'
```


So I really think that `KeyError` is supposed to take as argument the exact key which failed.

I suggested Nadia to create the ticket. For some user the difference between the str `'0'` and the int `0` is not clear especially since both of the following have the same repr :


```
sage: m = WordMorphism('0->01,1->10'); m
WordMorphism: 0->01, 1->10
sage: m = WordMorphism({0:[0,1],1:[1,0]}); m
WordMorphism: 0->01, 1->10
```


The following is fine and I think any user is okay with it:


```
sage: m
WordMorphism: 0->01, 1->10
sage: m([4])
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
KeyError: 4
```


But suppose you don't remember how `m` was created. You print it and then you use it:


```
sage: m
WordMorphism: 0->01, 1->10
sage: m([0])
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
KeyError: 0
```


The first time you get the error, it can be confusing and not easy to find what is wrong.

I was thinking about a better error message like the following:


```
sage: m
WordMorphism: 0->01, 1->10
sage: m([0])
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
KeyError: 0. Valid keys are ['0', '1']. 
```
