Patch aims to resolve the following inconsistency, by providing a `.inverse()` method for permutation group elements.

```
sage: S = SymmetricGroup(4)
sage: s = S("(1,2,3)")
sage: type(s)
<type
'sage.groups.perm_gps.permgroup_element.PermutationGroupElement'>
sage: s^-1
(1,3,2)
sage: s.inverse()
(1,3,2)

sage: A = AlternatingGroup(4)
sage: a = A("(1,2,3)")
sage: type(a)
<type
'sage.groups.perm_gps.permgroup_element.PermutationGroupElement'>
sage: a^-1
(1,3,2)
sage: a.inverse()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)
<snip>
AttributeError:
'sage.groups.perm_gps.permgroup_element.PermutationGroupElement' object has no attribute 'inverse'
