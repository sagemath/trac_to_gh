The short ebuild name "tox" is ambiguous.
What we need is `dev-python/tox`:

```
$ cat build/pkgs/tox/distros/gentoo.txt
dev-python/tox
```

Here's a branch doing that.

Taking the opportunity to remove tox distro info
for Cygwin, as tox is not packaged in Cygwin.

Yes, this is needed, `tox` by itself is ambiguous on Gentoo.
