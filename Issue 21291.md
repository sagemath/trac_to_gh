CC:  @fchapoton

This patch adds a function to check if a lattice is semidistributive, i.e. both meet- and join-semidistributive.

This seems to be normal vocabulary used in papers. It is kind of unfortunately that in finite lattices `modular := upper semimodular and lower semimodular` but `distributive := meet-distributive and join-distributive`, and semidistributivity is a related but different concept. But Sage can not change that terminology.

Kevin, can you review this?

The paper http://www.math.hawaii.edu/~jb/unbound.ps says "If L also satisfies `SD_\vee`, then `\kappa` is one-to-one - -", hence the part "A semidistributive lattice must have equal number of meet- and join-irreducibles." at the code. Otherwise this should be trivial.

According to J. B. Nation it has not been proved that a finite join-semidistributive lattice with equal number of join- and meet-irreducibles is meet-semidistributive. (It is proved for lower bounded finite lattices, but not every semidistributive lattice is lower bounded.) Hence the last line of the code can not be optimized for now.

Frédéric? This is quite trivial to review.
