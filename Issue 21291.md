CC:  chapoton

This patch adds a function to check if a lattice is semidistributive, i.e. both meet- and join-semidistributive.

This seems to be normal vocabulary used in papers. It is kind of unfortunately that in finite lattices `modular := upper semimodular and lower semimodular` but `distributive := meet-distributive and join-distributive`, and semidistributivity is a related but different concept. But Sage can not change that terminology.

Kevin, can you review this?

The paper http://www.math.hawaii.edu/~jb/unbound.ps says "If L also satisfies `SD_\vee`, then `\kappa` is one-to-one - -", hence the part "A semidistributive lattice must have equal number of meet- and join-irreducibles." at the code. Otherwise this should be trivial.

Frédéric? This is quite trivial to review.
