# Issue 9634: binomial does not accept variable when only in the lower argument

Issue created by migration from Trac.

```
sage: var('k')
k 
sage: binomial(x,3)
1/6*(x - 2)*(x - 1)*x
sage: binomial(3,k)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError: Either m or x-m must be an integer 
```


From kcrisman:
Is this a bug?  I would say yes, because

```
sage: binomial(x,k)
binomial(x, k)
```

works, but maybe we want to have it be a specific integer if the top
number is given?  Any input?

Attachment

attachment:trac_9634-symbolic_binomial.patch replaces the top level `binomial()` function with the one defined in `sage.functions.other`. This version can handle symbolic input, as opposed to the previous one from `sage.rings.arith`.

This still needs work, since the files `sage/functions/other.py` and `sage/rings/arith.py` don't pass doctests yet. We need to improve the speed of numerical approximation using the `gamma` trick from `sage.rings.arith.binomial` and change `sage.symbolic.pynac.py_binomial()` to handle large integers.

Good catch; I was pretty sure we had rewritten that at some point, but I have trouble following the imports.

Is that part of this ticket?  Are you saying that the numerical approximation has slowed down dramatically from the `rings.arith` version?

This very bug trips up many potential users.  Ping.   Let's fix it!!


---

Attachment

I uploaded a new patch that fixes doctests as well. This meant reimplementing the `_eval_()` and `_evalf_()` methods to override those defined in pynac.

Patchbot, apply only trac_9634-symbolic_binomial.take2.patch.

The patch2 does not apply cleanly, with two hunks failing, which I fixed manually, and push it to git. However:

```
sage -t src/sage/functions/other.py  # 18 doctests failed
sage -t src/sage/combinat/partition.py  # 2 doctests failed
sage -t src/sage/rings/arith.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t src/sage/symbolic/expression.pyx  # 2 doctests failed
```

Never mind, it's all fine, I had an incomplete installation.

OK I retested after merge, though only combinat. The number in that commit message is wrong, please ignore.

The branch loses the "Polynomial" global which causes a number of doctest falures

```

The funny thing is, it appears the global definition of `Polynomial` now missing is in `power_series_ring_element.pyx` which was indirectly and illogically imported in `polynomial_ring_element.pyx` before the author's patch.

Evidently he should have submitted the import cleanup separately.

Offhand, I'm not able to fix this, any takers?

Indeed.


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2014-02-21 20:11:49

In any case, Polynomial should just be imported into the global namespace in `src/sage/rings/polynomial/all.py`. The import cleanup is good, even though it should have been separate.
