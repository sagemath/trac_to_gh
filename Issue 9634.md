From kcrisman:
Is this a bug?  I would say yes, because

```
sage: binomial(x,k)
binomial(x, k)
```

works, but maybe we want to have it be a specific integer if the top
number is given?  Any input?

attachment:trac_9634-symbolic_binomial.patch replaces the top level `binomial()` function with the one defined in `sage.functions.other`. This version can handle symbolic input, as opposed to the previous one from `sage.rings.arith`.

This still needs work, since the files `sage/functions/other.py` and `sage/rings/arith.py` don't pass doctests yet. We need to improve the speed of numerical approximation using the `gamma` trick from `sage.rings.arith.binomial` and change `sage.symbolic.pynac.py_binomial()` to handle large integers.

Good catch; I was pretty sure we had rewritten that at some point, but I have trouble following the imports.

Is that part of this ticket?  Are you saying that the numerical approximation has slowed down dramatically from the `rings.arith` version?
