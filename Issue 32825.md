Follow up from #32703, where this was implemented for macOS.

Here we implement it for the `docker`-based workflows.

Not sure if that's it but there are a number of new failures introduced by switching to `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1`, for example https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/5087229478?check_suite_focus=true

My point was that you shouldn't use the matrix for stages, so that you don't run into these constraints.
- Job "build": (min, standard, max) for each system (=3 * 46 < 256) - build docker image
- Job "test-basic": (min, standard) for each system - build sage, run tests
- Job "test-optional": max for each system - build sage with optional packages, run tests

This would also keep what is build and runs in stages.

You seem to have the same problem with the current setup as well (e.g. first stage of debian-bookworm fails due timeout).

I don't see anything there that would be easier with matrix-stages over job-stages. In the contrary, the design I proposed above can easily be extended using additional jobs (that run on top of "build"). While your matrix-stage design would need an additional stage, which is not possible due to 3 stages * 2 configs * 46 systems > 256.

OK, so to summarize, the revised plan of comment:30 would be:

- Job "prebuild": (minimal, standard, maximal) for each system (=3 * 46 < 256) - build `-with-targets-pre` images
- Job "build": (minimal, standard, maximal) for each system (=3 * 46 < 256) - build `-with-targets` images
- Job "test-basic": (minimal, standard) for each system - build sage, run tests
- Job "test-optional": (maximal) for each system - build sage with optional packages, run tests

This would work. Minor detail: After this change, prebuild and build would build the union of the platforms currently run for "standard" and for "maximal". That's a small change, but that would be fine with me.
