A new Sage class somewhere between `ConvexSet_base + ConditionSet` and `Polyhedron` that is able to store convex sets given by finitely many, strict or non-strict linear constraints (not necessarily minimal) would be valuable. In contrast to `Polyhedron`, it would not insist on eagerly computing a minimal description by facet defining inequalities.
