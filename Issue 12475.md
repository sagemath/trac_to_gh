Assignee: leif

This deals with adding support for a file

```
$DOT_SAGE/sagerc
```

which will be sourced after `sage-env`, so it can be used to override the environment variables used in Sage.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/12647

As far as I know, these two tests are identical.  But I changed it to use `-z`.

Minor flaw:

should read

```sh

AFAIK `.` is more portable than `source`; does Bash 2.04 support the latter?

Sun's "default" `sed` (not the one in `/usr/xpg*/bin/`) doesn't either IIRC.

Probably even the XPG one doesn't; I don't recall.  It at least used to be a GNU extension.

We could of course implement `./sage --make ...` :-)

(But perhaps the easiest way is to make `make` an alias to a script that behaves differently in case the current directory is the root of a Sage installation, and just calls `make` otherwise.)

> The patch to `sage-env` causes a beta9 regression since `CFLAGS` are now no longer exported, which at least some spkgs relied on (i.e., their `spkg-install` sets or modifies them, but doesn't export them by itself since this used to be redundant).

Can you explain that? I thought that first sage-env was run, then spkg-install was run (via sage-spkg). So how can exporting (an empty) `CFLAGS` in sage-env help if that variable is later modified in spkg-install?

Actually any `spkg-install` modifying `CFLAGS` should export them (at least if they've been empty / unset) ...

It would have helped only if `CFLAGS` were (e.g.) set to `""` as well (if they had been empty or unset before), which on the other hand would currently break building the Sage library, which needs `-fno-strict-aliasing`, which [also] comes from Python's `CFLAGS`, but only if `CFLAGS` are **not** set to `""`, i.e., not set / exported at all.

Exporting a variable which you don't set has no effect.  Since `CFLAGS` wasn't (and still isn't) set in `sage-env`, the `export` did nothing.

Example (GNU bash version 4.0.35(1)-release if it matters):

```
jdemeyer@arcanis:~$ ( export FOO; env ) | grep FOO
jdemeyer@arcanis:~$ ( export FOO; FOO=; env ) | grep FOO
FOO=
```

Of course.  But we [still] have things like

```sh
if [ "$LDFLAGS" = "" ]; then
    LDFLAGS=""          && export LDFLAGS
fi


if [ "$CXXFLAGS" = "" ]; then
    export CXXFLAGS="$CFLAGS"
fi
```

in `sage-env`, which will **always** cause `LDFLAGS` and `CXXFLAGS` to be exported, no matter whether they've previously been unset, or exported empty.  So currently (re)exporting these in e.g. `spkg-install` scripts is indeed redundant.

I think we should either do that there for all such variables, or none of them.  Especially setting `CXXFLAGS` to `$CFLAGS` even if a user did `export CXXFLAGS=""` may have somewhat surprising effects, or is (I think) at least unexpected behaviour.
