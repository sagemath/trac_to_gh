Hi Travis!

Thanks for your work on free monoids and algebras; those features have been waiting around for too long! I glanced through the code, and here are some random thoughts that came to my mind:

- Rather than importing `IndexedFreeMonoid` in the global namespace,
  it would be preferable to have `FreeMonoid(...)` construct an
  `IndexedFreeMonoid` when given appropriate arguments (and same
  things for its friends). Let's avoid the bad route we took with
  `CombinatorialFreeModule` and have at once a single entry point for
  free monoids! As an immediate side effect, the current code for
  the `FreeAlgebra` might well make it almost immediately work for any
  index set.

- Mathematically speaking, the free algebra indexed by I is
  (isomorphic to) the algebra of the free monoid indexed by I is
  (isomorphic to) the tensor algebra of the free module indexed by I. So we now have three implementations of the free algebra!

  I'd rather only have a single implementation, typically in
  `FreeAlgebra(K, I)`, with `FreeMonoid(I).algebra(K)`
  pointing to it.

  `FreeAlgebra(K, I)` should by the way be in the category
  Monoids().Algebras(K) which could allow for reusing some generic
  code.

  `TensorAlgebra(V)` could then also point to `FreeAlgebra(K, I)`.
  Possibly with some customization (e.g. printing using tensor symbol).

  By the way, with the name `TensorAlgebra`, the user would probably
  expect to write the product using tensor rather than *. Actually I
  am not yet sure we actually want at this point to have
  `TensorAlgebra` with multiplicative notation.

  Altogether, since `TensorAlgebra` does not bring a feature set
  really different from `FreeAlgebra`, I'd rather leave it name alone
  for now until we have a better view on how we want to handle
  tensor/symmetric/exterior modules.

- It could be preferable to have `TensorModule` be a functorial
  construction, parallel to that for tensor products, and if
  possible sharing as much code as possible with it.

- On a similar footing, the code for _repr_, _latex_, ... in
  `TensorModule` is duplicated from
  `CombinatorialFreeModule_Tensor`.  Can we avoid that?

- `IndexedFreeAbelianGroup`: do we want to write them additively or
  multiplicatively? In the later case, code could be shared with
  `CombinatorialFreeModule`.

- `TensorModule.algebra`: this definition of .algebra is incompatible
  with the functorial construction with the same name
  (`I.algebra()` builds an algebra whose basis is indexed by
  I). Do we really need this method?

- `is_finite` methods for `Free...Monoid`: this would be
  best achieved by setting the category appropriately.

- `IndexedMonoidElement`: Describe the data structure

- The doctests of __init__ actually constructs an
  `IndexedFreeAbelianMonoid`. Is this on purpose?

- `_mul_(self, y)` -> `_mul_(self, other)`

- What is the semantic of comparisons (__lt__, ...)? Do we really
  need those comparisons?

- __pow__: Can't we use a generic implementation?

- IndexedMonoid.__contains__ seems generic enough to be lifted
  higher up in the class hierarchy

- _an_element_: rather do the product of the first three elements
  (if available), similar to what's done in
  CombinatorialFreeModule.an_element. This is less demanding on the
  index set (computing the cardinality may be expensive/not
  implemented)

- gens: using `PoorManMap` in `CombinatorialFreeModule.monomial`
  is relevant to make it easy to allow for the short idiom:
  `M.module_morphism(M.monomial*...)`. Do we need it here?

- gens: define instead monoid_generators. gens defers by default to
  monoid_generators in the monoids category (at least with #10963).

- ngens: kill the beast. `self.gens().cardinality()` is a better
  idiom. If we really want a shortcut, it should live in a more
  generic setting.

OK, that was quite a few failing doctests, mostly just me being careless. Fixed... with one big exception: almost none of the coercion doctests work! Most strikingly, this here:

```
            sage: C = CombinatorialFreeModule(ZZ, Set([1,2]))
            sage: TAC = TensorAlgebra(C)
            sage: c = C.monomial(2)
            sage: TAC(c)
```
blows up! I don't understand coercion well enough to fix this; this probably needs you, Travis.

That said, some of my coercion doctests might be expecting too much.
