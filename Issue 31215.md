This is with

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ SageMath version 9.2, Release Date: 2020-10-24                     │
│ Using Python 3.8.5. Type "help()" for help.                        │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

All of these work as expected:

```                                                                                                                                            
sage: solve(x==3,x)                                                                                                                                            
sage: solve([x==3],x)                                                                                                                                          
sage: solve([x==3],[x])                                                                                                                                        
sage: solve(x==3,[x])                                                                                                                                          
sage: solve(x==3,x,solution_dict=True)                                                                                                                         
sage: solve([x==3],x,solution_dict=True)                                                                                                                       
```

So I wonder why these give an error:

```
sage: solve(x==3,[x],solution_dict=True)                                                                                                                     
sage: solve([x==3],[x],solution_dict=True)                                                                                                                     
[...]
TypeError: 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression' object is not iterable
```

I am sure you have guessed:  I am trying to do this in a program where the number of equations and the number of variables are variable.

Is it necessary to test for the case where there is only one variable?
I hope not.
