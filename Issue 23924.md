# Issue 23924: Improve speed of Kostka-Foulkes polynomials

With the current version of Sage, we have:

```
sage: %timeit KostkaFoulkesPolynomial([4, 4, 2], [3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1])
100 loops, best of 3: 14.8 ms per loop
```

However, if we avoid creating conjugate partitions (and with some other tweaks), we get

```
sage: %timeit KostkaFoulkesPolynomial([4, 4, 2], [3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1])
100 loops, best of 3: 6.13 ms per loop
```


We also get a speedup using #24160.

Now according to `%prun`, about 60% of the time is spent in `dominated_partitions` and 40% in the `Partition.__init__` (basically entirely overlapping contributions) and their subroutines. If we skip all checks and normalization in partitions, we can get another ~30% speedup, but that could be a much more fragile change. This is already a huge speed gain.

Looks good.

Two details:

```
i = 0
```

is no longer needed. And

```
`ZZ['t']`
```

could be `\ZZ['t']`

Once done, you can set to positive.
