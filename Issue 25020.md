# Issue 25020: Implement rank for sparse integer matrix using LinBox

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Keywords: linbox, sparse matrix

Right now the only way to compute the rank of a sparse integer matrix is to either convert it to a dense matrix or a rational matrix (which simply does Gaussian elimination). Both of these options are horrible. Linbox provides a rank algorithm more for sparse matrices. The aim of this ticket is to expose this.

For example, with a sparse matrix

```
matrix dims: 11550 x 5775
density: 1/1155
number nonzero positions: 57750
```

it takes ~11s with linbox on my computer, and I gave up after well over minute doing it over *Q*.

This is a part of #13915.

Here is an initial branch that is horribly hacked together, but it was sufficient for my purposes and to demonstrate that we should do this.

Nice.

Please add tests for all possible corner cases (0 x 1, 1 x 0 and 0 x 0). I had troubles with these with other linbox functions.

I think that it would be better to isolate the conversion `dict -> sparse matrix` as in #24544 (`libs/linbox/conversion.pxd`). What do you think? Moreover, the datastructure for sparse integer matrix is not a dict. Converting to a dict is a lot of waste. Though, this can be done in a second time.

BTW, I already have rank/det/solve for sparse matrices on a branch. You might want to wait for next week (Sage days in Cernay).

(my version has C++ conversions between the `mpz_vector *` of Sage and linbox custom datatype)

But priority is #24544 which fails to compile :-(

I completely agree with comment:2. I was just trying to get the rank of certain big matrices rather than do rank frequently, so converting from the internal format was not a big issue for me. Again "horribly hacked together" `:)` I also highly doubt what I've done is the correct, or even good, way to do it too.

I am happy to wait until next week. I will be visiting Sydney, so I probably won't have much time to devote to Sage development next week. However, I am happy to review tickets where I can.

Could you try #23214?

I would say #23214 superseeds this, which we can close as a duplicate.

Thanks for creating this ticket: it motivated me to finish #23214.

Thank you for doing a much better job than I did on this ticket. I will try to get to #23214 as soon as I can. I think I have some time in the afternoon tomorrow to properly review it then (too tired tonight to review the #24544 parts).
