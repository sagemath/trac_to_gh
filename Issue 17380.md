The examples contained in the coding theory tutorial were never tested because they began with "Sage :" instead of "sage:".

This is reformatted in #17616 but many doctests were broken and were flagged as "not tested". Somebody who understands coding theory should go over them and fix them properly.

It appears now "codes." must be preappended: for example,


```
C = ToricCode([[0,0],[1,0],[2,0],[0,1],[1,1]],GF(7))
```

becomes

```
C = codes.ToricCode([[0,0],[1,0],[2,0],[0,1],[1,1]],GF(7))
```

True. I believe that #17616 already does that wherever it is needed, though.

Indeed.

All of these were fixed when I completely rewrote this tutorial in #19897. 

I don't exactly know what to do in that case though. I know you can set a ticket as closed/invalid/wontfix which it more or less the case here, but I don't know how to do that.

Yes, like this. It was under "milestones", of course...

Anyway, I'm giving a positive review to this closed/invalid/wontfix as the bugs described in this ticket does not exist anymore.
