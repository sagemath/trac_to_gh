Where is this plrs coming from? I can't find it in the upstream tarball. Is it something specific to the autotoolized version?

sage is still using lrslib 6.x. it's possible that it was removed in 7.0

Replying to [comment:2 mkoeppe]:

Ah yes, that's it. It is in the 062 tarball but not in the 070 one.

Sage development has entered the release candidate phase for 9.3. Setting a new milestone for this ticket based on a cursory review of ticket status, priority, and last modification date.
