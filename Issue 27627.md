it only uses gmp/mpir, should be easy. On debian, `sudo apt install libisl-dev`.

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).

This works for me. Do you think the version hard coded in the `spkg-configure.m4` package should come from `package-version.txt` for simple scripts like this?

Not always - sometimes it might be lower.
