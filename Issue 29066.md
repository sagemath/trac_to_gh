# Issue 29066: Fix backwards compatibility broken by #29247

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29303

Original creator: pbruin

In #29247, the `_no_generic_basering_coercion` flag was deprecated, but its effect (not executing `UnitalAlgebras.ParentMethods.__init_first__`) was accidentally nullified.  Thanks to Marc Mezzarobba for reporting this.
