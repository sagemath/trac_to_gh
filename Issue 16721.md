That doesn't surprise me. We tried to properly interface with libsingular's reference counting before and, while we came close, it ended up being a rather nightmarish experience. See #13447.

I am still quite hopeful that this can be fixed *if the right experts get in the same room* for a couple of days (either that or people will find out if libsingular's reference counting is fundamentally broken).

(note that #13447 is about garbage collecting rings, which are probably a little more complicated data structures. Nonetheless, there may well be components in common).

Singular's `fast_map` returns non-normalized values (e.g. rational coefficients are not in standard form). As far as I know, this shouldn't be a problem yet we still segfault in the `p_Delete`. Adding a `p_Normalize` avoids the segfault. Perhaps there is a subtle bug / hidden assumption in `fast_map` that requires the normalization, I don't know.
