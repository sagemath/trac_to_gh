Sorry I didn't pay attention to this ticket in the past month
and only realise now...

I would have suggested to keep the "sws to other formats"
converters for a year.

This would give time to migrate legacy worksheets, matching
our one-year deprecation period.

Of course, people can always download Sage 9.1, or find it on CoCalc...
for a while.
