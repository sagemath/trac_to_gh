OK, I think I managed en/ru/de[plattdeutsch:-)] and for fr/es/pt/jp I inserted a bit of English (pardon...). 

Could someone versed enough in these please fix these languages.

The remaining challende is to fix Sage Mac app, which refers to sws files in menus etc.
For this we need someone who knows enough Xcode IDE, I gather.

When I look at the branch on trac, the last entry is a new file "t", containing

```
if test x`locale -a | grep C\.UTF-8` != x; then
 export LC_ALL=C.UTF-8;
else
 export LC_ALL=C;

Is that supposed to be there?

Otherwise, I think we should merge this and fix the remaining languages later.

Sorry I didn't pay attention to this ticket in the past month
and only realise now...

I would have suggested to keep the "sws to other formats"
converters for a year.

This would give time to migrate legacy worksheets, matching
our one-year deprecation period.

Of course, people can always download Sage 9.1, or find it on CoCalc...
for a while.
