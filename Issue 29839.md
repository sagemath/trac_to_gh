For the tutorial, I would suggest removing the section `_section_notebook` completely, and making a change like this:

```diff
diff --git a/src/doc/en/tutorial/introduction.rst b/src/doc/en/tutorial/introduction.rst
index 10f929fc97..e52077c221 100644
--- a/src/doc/en/tutorial/introduction.rst
+++ b/src/doc/en/tutorial/introduction.rst

 You can use Sage in several ways.
 
 
--  **Notebook graphical interface:** see the section on the
-   Notebook in the reference manual and :ref:`section-notebook` below,
+-  **Notebook graphical interface:** run `sage -n jupyter`; see 
+   `the Jupyter documentation on-line <https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebook.html>`_,
 
 -  **Interactive command line:** see :ref:`chapter-interactive_shell`,
 
```

Unfortunately I don't know to write that in the various languages we offer. If you don't want to do this, I would at least suggest removing "the section on the Notebook in the reference manual", since I don't think that such a section exists.

OK, I think I managed en/ru/de[plattdeutsch:-)] and for fr/es/pt/jp I inserted a bit of English (pardon...). 

Could someone versed enough in these please fix these languages.

The remaining challende is to fix Sage Mac app, which refers to sws files in menus etc.
For this we need someone who knows enough Xcode IDE, I gather.

Removal of binaries is best done on top of #21559

```
sed -i.bak 's/aufrufen Sie `sage -n jupyter`/rufen Sie `sage -n jupyter` auf/' src/doc/de/tutorial/introduction.rst

Spanish done, thanks to Reimundo.

This could be better for french in `src/doc/fr/tutorial/introduction.rst`

```diff
--  **Interface graphique (« notebook ») :** démarrer `sage -n jupyter`; lire 
-   `Jupyter documentation on-line <https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebook.html>`_ ;
+-  **Interface graphique (« notebook ») :** démarrer `sage -n jupyter`; lire la
+   `documentation en ligne de Jupyter <https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebook.html>`_ ;
```

But it's true that the current form clearly indicates that the on-line documentation of jupyter is in english.

I'm surprised in fact that Jupyther has no localised docs, but I can't find any, at least nothing official.


---

Comment by dcoudert created at 2020-07-08 07:40:37

At least it has a documentation, while today many software have no docs at all (and don't expect proper comments in the code).

macOS app to be fixed on #30099

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2020-07-20 17:05:59

When I look at the branch on trac, the last entry is a new file "t", containing

```
if test x`locale -a | grep C\.UTF-8` != x; then
 export LC_ALL=C.UTF-8;
else
 export LC_ALL=C;
fi

echo $LC_ALL
```

Is that supposed to be there?

Otherwise, I think we should merge this and fix the remaining languages later.

Sorry I didn't pay attention to this ticket in the past month
and only realise now...

I would have suggested to keep the "sws to other formats"
converters for a year.

This would give time to migrate legacy worksheets, matching
our one-year deprecation period.

Of course, people can always download Sage 9.1, or find it on CoCalc...
for a while.

converters are still there.

Only the already broken sws<->rst converters are removed here.
