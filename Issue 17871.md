```
+        sage: import sage.rings.field
+        doctest:...: DeprecationWarning: the module sage.rings.field is deprecated and will be removed
+        See http://trac.sagemath.org/18108 for details.
```

So ... what are the details?  (That is, there is no reason apparent in the message, but presumably there is one obvious to those who use this, just would be helpful to have it here.)

Looking fine and simple. Passes all tests in http://patchbot.sagemath.org/log/18108/Ubuntu/14.04/i686/3.13.0-40-generic/arando/2015-04-03%2001:27:54%20+0100?short

Your arando patchbot run, however, again seems to have problems, modules are not found.
