# Issue 11823: Implement Vec() functions as in newest PARI

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2011-11-05 22:34:40

Assignee: was

Upstream PARI has extended the `Vec()`, `Vecrev()`, `Col()` functions to allow an optional argument giving a minimum length.  The PARI currently in Sage does not support this, but we can easily emulate it in the Sage library.
