I checked that this does not cause problems with the `autotools` package, which depends on ncurses. Haven't tested anything else.

My VM is happy, removing custom patches is always a good newe, let us just wait that some patchbot gives a green light and it will be OK for me.

It seems that the patchbots get stuck after downloading the tarball. Any hint ?

The patchbot won't run package upgrades (for security reasons). Although I'd be shocked if this caused any (nontrivial) doctest failures.

It did not on my 32-bit VM, which is a weird setting. While currently at sage days 84, i cannot afford to recompile everything it on my 6 years old laptop. So, let me positive_review it now then.
