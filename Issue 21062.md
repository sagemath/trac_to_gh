Seems good. I could review this, but just now I got `STDERR: fatal: Couldn't find remote ref u/chapoton/21299` from `git trac checkout`.

But I am paranoid `:=)`. Maybe there is a <tab> or I did not see something about `_iter_concurent` etc.

I'd rather list some of these in _Daily WTF?_... :-)

Just wanted to say (here as well) that I'm not having any issues fetching the branch (again, with _plain_ `git`).

OK. As usual, I tested with

`./sage -t --long $(git show | egrep '^\+\+\+ .+\.py' | colrm 1 6)`

In `hecke_triangle_group_element.py`, please change `explicitely` to `explicitly`, then it looks good.

FYI I did actually checkout the ticket and rebuild. No issues.
