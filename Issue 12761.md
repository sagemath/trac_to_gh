Let it be said that I hate vertex labels.

Before:

```
sage: g = digraphs.RandomDirectedGNP(2000,.2)  
sage: g.strongly_connected_components_digraph()
Exception: The user died of old age
```

After :

```
sage: time g.strongly_connected_components_digraph()
Digraph on 1 vertex
Time: CPU 2.78 s, Wall: 2.79 s
```

Which is already far, far too much. And if it is still slow it is -- of course -- only because of labels.

The running time improvement is impressive, although I had no "user died of old age" exception. Considering a linear time algorithm, the running time is still high, but I don't know how to be faster in python.

The patch is working perfectly and passes all tests (graph.py and digraph.py).
I give positive review.

Nathann, you are my hero of the day!

I was running a calculation while Anne was presenting a talk about monoids. My calculation was taking forever (minutes? more? I killed it). I applied your patch, and it went down to 5s. And now I have a little counter example that she can announce at the end of her talk :-)
