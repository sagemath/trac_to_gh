```
The following causes a segmentation fault for the identity morphism of polynomial rings over number fields:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = QuadraticField(-1)[]
sage: f = R.hom(R.gens(), R)
sage: f.is_identity()
------------------------------------------------------------------------
(no backtrace available)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred.
```

This does not happen for morphisms that are not the identity.

This bug was introduced between Sage 8.1 and 8.6.

In the original example this `_lmul_()` call happens in `sage.categories.morphism.Morphism._richcmp_()`.  The problem may be that the parent of the argument is not the scalar ring of the module element, but a smaller ring.

Thank you for looking into this. I think maybe it would be safer to use a coercion here instead of a conversion? For example

```diff
-gens = [(<ModuleElement>e)._lmul_(B(x)) for x in gens]
+gens = [(<ModuleElement>e)._lmul_(B._coerce_c(x)) for x in gens]
```

Just to be sure that no strange conversions are done.

Sounds reasonable, but I prefer `B.coerce(x)` since `_coerce_c` is a remnant of the old coercion model.  Now running tests.
