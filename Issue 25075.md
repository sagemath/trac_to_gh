The patch can be replaced by a doctest warning filter. That means that sage doesn't have to maintain that patch anymore and distributions don't have to patch that package just for sage.

This patch originated at [debian](https://salsa.debian.org/science-team/sagemath/blob/master/debian/patches/u2-pari-stackwarn.patch) and I adapted it for [the nix package](https://github.com/timokau/nixpkgs/blob/sage-on-nixos/pkgs/applications/science/math/sage/patches/pari-stackwarn.patch).

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25312

The patch has been accepted upstream. So IMHO it makes little sense to remove it. Otherwise, we would have to undo the changes here when PARI is upgraded.

PS: if you want a ticket to be reviewed, you need to set it to "needs_review". You should also add your real name in the "Author" field.

Ah, right. I thought it was declined upstream, must have confused it with the glpk exact_verbosity patch.

For reference, [here is the relevant pari commit](http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=pari.git;a=commitdiff;h=def3bed8d2dcba1ea88a6e3faacd316124a63147;hp=b96fdad01b33faeb0c501d6ffc0f31388123588f).

Then you're right of course, it doesn't make sense to patch around it if it won't be necessary at all anymore next update.

Thanks for the tips, using trac is new to me.

For the record: it has been declined multiple times upstream but I eventually managed to convince one PARI developer to accept this patch. Even then, a different PARI developer reverted patch of my patch (the commit you linked to is actually that revert).
