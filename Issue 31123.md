It makes no sense that we offer to install an ancient version of git from source. 

On `fedora-26-minimal` (https://github.com/sagemath/sage/runs/1850248210),
it fails:

```
make -C perl  PERL_PATH='/usr/bin/perl' prefix='/sage/local' localedir='/sage/local/share/locale' all
/usr/bin/perl Makefile.PL PREFIX='/sage/local' INSTALL_BASE='' --localedir='/sage/local/share/locale'
Can't locate ExtUtils/MakeMaker.pm in @INC (you may need to install the ExtUtils::MakeMaker module) (@INC contains: /sage/local/lib/perl5 /usr/local/lib64/perl5 /usr/local/share/perl5 /usr/lib64/perl5/vendor_perl /usr/share/perl5/vendor_perl /usr/lib64/perl5 /usr/share/perl5 .) at Makefile.PL line 3.
BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at Makefile.PL line 3.
make[6]: *** [Makefile:83: perl.mak] Error 2
```


We reduce `git` to an optional script package - so that we can continue to advertise system packages providing it. (See also #30201)

Why even optional? What benefit does having git installed provide to a normal user?

My perspective is: if you have even the slightest idea what git is or what you would do with it... you don't need sage to suggest that you install it.

If nothing else, having it as an optional script package creates a landing page in our reference manual that shows basic info. It gives us a clean standardized way to talk about external software in our manuals.
