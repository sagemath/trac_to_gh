CC:  tscrim chapoton

I would like to implement relations A-D from http://www.math.hawaii.edu/~jb/unbound.ps

It seems natural to first start from the function that is marked as greek letter kappa at the paper. Here I gave it just a name `kappa()`.

That's good name!

By googling I found that Lattices and Ordered Sets by Steven Roman p. 225 uses the name "kappa function", but I can not see the page itself. The symbol itself seems to be coherently used for this, see Algebras and Orders by Ivo G. Rosenberg and Gert Sabidussi, or http://journals.cambridge.org/download.php?file=%2FJAZ%2FJAZ1_63_01%2FS1446788700000355a.pdf&code=9cc17eeb007fe5d050aadfcbedad50cd, but I did not found other mentions of "kappa function" spelled out.

Should I ask from J. B. Nation himself?

Name `maximal_incomparable_element` would suggest that function works for all elements in every poset, and it really could be defined so. But I have seen it only used for join-irreducibles.

Back to *needs_review*. This can not be "maximal incomparable element", as that is not the case in special case where an element covers a doubly irreducible element; then `\kappa(a)=a`. Hence I can see no easy name for the function at all, except "kappa".

> I think `kappa` is fine. I reworked things slightly and improved the documentation. If my changes look good, then you can set a positive review. (From Sage's definition of join-irreducible, the 1 element lattice does not have any join-irreducible elements, and subsequently this case is not handled by your code, which is okay.)

Thanks (once again). This is good.

I must remember that one-element case when making code for semidistributivity.
