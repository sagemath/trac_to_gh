Changed all occurrences of `.next` except for those in `FSMProcessIterator`, since those will be changed in #16538.

merges cleanly, doctests pass, no changes in documentation. It probably does not hurt to have these replacements at this stage. #16075 is tasked with the switch at a more global level, but has no branch attached yet, so no merge conflicts expected at this stage.
