Keywords: full subcategories, homset

It has been desired for a while to be able to test, when B is a subcategory of A, whether it is a *full subcategory* or not; equivalently this is whether any A-morphism is a B-morphism (up to forgetfull functor; note that the converse always holds).

The main application is for #10668, which will let `B.homset_class` inherit from `A.homset_class` in this case and only in this case.

# Implementation proposal

For each category `C`, we encode the following data: is `C` is a full
subcategory of the join of its super categories? Informally, the
question is whether `C` introduces more structure or operations. For
the sake of the discussion, I am going to call `C` a *structure
category* in this case, but a better name is to be found.

Here are some of the main structure categories in Sage, and the
structure or main operation they introduce:

- AdditiveMagmas: +
- AdditiveMagmas.AdditiveUnital: 0
- Magmas: *
- Magmas.Unital: 1
- Module: . (product by scalars)
- Coalgebra: coproduct
- Hopf algebra: antipode
- Enumerated sets: a distinguished enumeration of the elements
- Coxeter groups: distinguished coxeter generators
- Euclidean ring: the euclidean division
- Crystals: crystal operators

Possible implementation: provide a method `C.is_structure_category()`
(name to be found). The default implementation would return `True` for
a plain category and `False` for a CategoryWithAxiom. This would cover
most cases, and require to implement `foo` methods only in a few
categories (e.g. the Unital axiom categories).

Once we have this data encoded, we can implement recursively a
(cached) method such as:

```
    sage: Rings().structure_super_categories()
    {Magmas(), AdditiveMagmas()}
```

(just take the union of the structure super categories of the super
categories of ``self``, and add ``self`` if relevant).

It is now trivial to check whether a subcategory B of A is actually a
full subcategory: they just need to have the same structure super
categories! Hence `is_full_subcategory` can be written as:

```
    def is_full_subcategory(self, other):
        return self.is_subcategory(other) and
           len(self.structure_super_categories()) == len(other.structure_super_categories())
```


## Advantages of this proposal

This requires very little data to be encoded, and should be quite
cheap to compute.

This is generally useful; in particular, for a user, the structure
super categories together with the axioms would give an interesting
overview of a category:

```
    sage: Rings().structure_super_categories()
    {Magmas(), AdditiveMagmas()}
    sage: Rings().axioms()
    frozenset({'AdditiveAssociative', 'AdditiveCommutative', 'AdditiveInverse', 'AdditiveUnital', 'Associative', 'Distributive', 'Unital'})
```


In fact, we could hope/want to always have:

```
    C is Category.join(C.structure_super_categories()).with_axioms(C.axioms())
```


which could be used e.g. for pickling by construction while exposing
very little implementation details.

## Bonus

Each structure category could name the main additional operations, so
that we could have something like:

```
    sage: Magmas().new_operation()
    "+"
    sage: Rings().operations()
    {"+", "0", "*", "1"}
```

or maybe:

```
    sage: Rings().operations()
    {Category of additive magmas: "+",
     Category of additive unital additive magmas: "0",
     Category of magmas: "*",
     Category of unital magmas: "1"}
```


## Questions

- Find good names for all the methods above

- How to handle the case where the extra structure is forced by the
  context, and automatically preserved by morphisms? E.g. the trivial
  Euclidean structure on fields?

Ideally, for every piece of algebraic structure there should be both a full and a fully structure-aware subcategory. So there should be a UnitalAlgebrasWithUnitalMorphisms and a UnitalAlgebrasWithArbitraryMorphisms, etc.; more importantly, there should be categories for graded modules with graded morphisms and with arbitrary morphisms (I don't remember out of the hat which is the one we have) and categories for modules-with-basis with basis-preserving morphisms and with arbitrary morphisms etc..

Agreed.

I guess that's alright: when we will want both, we will just need to
have two distinct categories/axioms/functorial construction for the
two situations. I am missing a good idiom / naming convention though.

In the mean time, the current implementation makes a default choice on
a case by case basis, according to the foreseen main use case for the
category (see the doc).

> Other than this I like the proposal!

Cool. I just pushed a first attempt. It's probably reasonably
complete. The main things that need discussion are:

- Terminology and method names

- Are there categories which need special handling that I missed?

- The default choices I have made.

In the current implementation, we are comparing the set of all super categories that define some structure. This set can only become larger for inclusion when going down the category hierarchy. So technically we are fine.

And this implementation seems to correctly models the mathematics, right?

Also, instead of an "is_..." method, we could name the method something like `additional_structure` and have it return something possibly meaningfull, like "*" for magmas or "+" for additive magmas, and None if there is none.

Possibly so indeed. Although this would be duplicating a bit the job
of `required_methods`. I am not sure we want to put a specific
emphasis on the methods related to an operation that adds structure
(e.g. '+') or that does not (e.g. '-').

Speaking of which: see #16363.

This is because the additional structure defined by `EuclideanDomains()` (the degree) is trivial in this case.

We can't model this in the current implementation. An approach might be to have `Fields()` explicitly remove `EuclideanDomains()` from its structure categories. But then we have to be more careful in the full subcategory test. Maybe we can test, for B a subcategory of A that `B.super_structure_categories()` is a subset of `A.super_structure_categories()`; given that we hash and check for equality by id, that should be fast enough if deemed correct.

A similar situation appears for graded connected hopf algebras where there is a single choice for the antipode (and, IIRC, it's preserved for free by bialgebra morphisms). So this is a full subcategory of the category of bialgebras.

Cheers,
                                              Nicolas

I put here for the record a summary of a private discussion by e-mail.

Darij:

I don't see any better names than "full" and "structure" subcategory.
In my opinion, these are clear and don't conflict with common usage.
While I am still not very keen on the name "subcategory" itself, we
can keep the "full" and "structure" adjectives even if we change it.

Travis:

This is the big thing that we needed. I can do the rest of the
review at this point I think. However thanks for looking things over
and giving us your notes.

Darij:

<pointing to the limitation now explicitly mentioned in the description of the ticket>

Nicolas:

I believe that this limitation could be raised, though at this point I
don't quite know what's the best approach. I also don't see a critical
need (it's already a good progress). So, as long as it's properly
documented (I just reworked that piece of the documentation; now it's
up to you guys to judge), I think that's fine for now.

It's more of there has been no better alternative proposed. If we move away from the terminology "structure category", then I feel like we loose the ability to name methods like `all_structure_super_categories`. However I do understand your objection.

Currently the default is that new subcategories are structure categories (so they are not full subcategories). If we were to go with returning pairs `(op, method)`, then the question becomes do we want the default to be `False` or do we allow `True` to remain the default and have it be when we can't adequately define the structure?

Actually, that made me have a thought. How about instead of `is_structure_category` we have `has_additional_structure`, and then we could extend this to `additional_structure` (on a followup ticket).

Hmm, it doesn't sound very desirable to define a category where you can't define what its extra structure is...

This sounds good.  We could go even further and formalise the notion of category with extra structure, so we would have
1. `CategoryWithAxiom`: like the existing class, but more restrictive.  Specifies an additional axiom to be satisfied by the objects, and defines the full subcategory objects satisfying this axiom.  For example, commutativity for groups.

Thanks. I double checked on this, and mostly agree up to one point: I
think Coxeter Groups should be a structure category, the extra
structure being the chosen set of simple generators.

I believe this would be dangerous. Being accidently a structure
category means that your homsets will miss some code that could be
available. So just a missing feature. Whereas being accidently a non
structure category can let your homset inherit from code that is not
applicable which can lead to wrong code.

Besides, all the categories your changed should actually become
CategoryWithAxioms at some point, which will have precisely the
desired effect.

So now one could wonder whether having a CategoryWithAxiom be a non
structure category is not a dangerous default. I believe it's ok,
because for a category with axiom A.B, one only has to be careful
about being a full subcategory or not if A is the category defining
the axiom B. There are not soo many of them.

That was the original plan, but this means having to encode much more
information. And it's quite more costly to compute.

> Hmm, it doesn't sound very desirable to define a category where you can't define what its extra structure is...

But this is imposing the category writer to do implement one more
thing, when implementing a category is already a barrier.  Being a
full subcategory only adds extra features to homsets. In most cases,
when implementing a category for the first time, one does not need
this feature. So being able to just not have to worry about it is a
definite plus.


> > Actually, that made me have a thought. How about instead of `is_structure_category` we have `has_additional_structure`, and then we could extend this to `additional_structure` (on a followup ticket).

Possibly so. What would be the names for all the related methods (like
`all_structure_categories`)?

For example (thinking about the discussion on #16843) the `Unital` property for rings (as a subcategory of `Rngs`) would become a structure instead of an axiom, because morphisms are restricted by the requirement that they preserve the unit element.

We want Unital to have all the other features of axioms like:

```
    sage: Rngs() & Semigroups().Unital()
    Category of Rings
```


So this would require a more complicated hierarchy of classes,
especially since one would also need to take care of the
over_base_ring variations. I am not sure this is worth it for just a
single method.

By the way: `Semigroups().Unital()` is indeed a structure
category. But not `Rngs().Unital()`: all the structure is defined in
the super categories `Rngs()` and `Semigroups().Unital()`.

Also: there is room for improvement in functorial constructions: in
some cases, we could automatically deduce that the category is a
structure category. I believe this is easier to implement by mean of
methods than by inheriting from one class or the other (and past has
proven that I can live with class surgery when needed).

I don't think so. If we wanted the generators to be part of the structure (definition), that should be the category of Coxeter syetems as it is much more rigid than just the groups.

I agree with this, although my thought is more about how many categories will we have are structure categories. As I stated, we need more data and I agree that having this default is the safe route.

Most axioms that come to my mind adds extra structure, but we can see what happens as we add more axioms.

Thanks for double-checking my double-check.

With this, we could keep the same names (although I believe the method your referring to  is `all_structure_super_categories`).

Are we all in agreement that we should change `is_structure_category` to `has_additional_structure` and the current framework is a good enough to merge in (since it could be extended at a later date to carry additional info)?

I don't see why this should necessarily be the case; we would just encode for each direct supercategory (of which there are usually just one or two)
whether it is a full supercategory.  This makes computing all full
supercategories not any slower (and probably faster) than computing
all supercategories, or presumably all "structure supercategories" for
that matter.

It seems to me that the first thing one has to do when defining a
category (and maybe the only essential thing!) should be to decide how
to encode its mathematical meaning.  The distinction between adding a
new axiom to the objects (thereby creating a full subcategory) and
adding a new type of structure (thereby creating a relationship that I
was thinking of as "category refinement" in earlier discussions) is
really fundamental in my opinion.

Of course, this type of construction should stay the same.

On the contrary, I think it there is an essential distinction between
just adding an axiom to the objects (hence creating a full
subcategory) and adding "extra structure".  (By the way, "over a base ring" is actually something that I am thinking of as another example of "extra structure".)

This actually strengthens my conviction that "structure category" is
not a well-defined notion.  Instead, I have the impression that the
structure should be regarded as being attached to what is currently
called the "axiom" rather than to the category.

In this example, it depends on how you define `Rings()`: either as
`Rngs() & Semigroups().Unital()`, in which case it is just a join of
categories without new structure, _or_ as `Rngs().Unital()`, in which
it does have extra structure (at least at first sight; you have to
know that the category code magically rearranges the construction to
turn `Rngs().Unital()` into a join of larger categories).  In fact,
`Semigroups().Unital()` (= `Monoids()`) is not a structure category
either; it is the join of `Magmas().Unital()` and `Semigroups()`.
> Also: there is room for improvement in functorial constructions: in

I am wondering how you could possibly detect such a thing.  In the
case of the `Unital()` structure (correct me if this is somehow an
exception), how do you know that this does not just mean the existence
of a unit element in the objects, but also the requirement that
morphisms preserve this element?  This seems to me precisely the type
of information that has to be specified by the person implementing the
`Unital()` structure.

Both concepts are useful, but it's far from clear for me that we want
to maintain both categories Coxeter groups / coxeter systems. Given
that:

- Our Coxeter groups all come endowed with a distinguished set of
  generators.

- It's easier to change a structure category to a non structure
  category than the converse (since it's adding features).

- With the current setting, we already have both concepts: e.g. when
  constructing a morphism between two coxeter groups, you can choose
  to construct it as a group morphism or as a Coxeter group morphism.

I agree that we need more data. My bet is that most categories will be
either structure categories or categories with axioms.

> Most axioms that come to my mind adds extra structure, but we can see what happens as we add more axioms.

Do they? So far, only one of the existing axioms (Unital and its
additive variant) add extra structure. And the one I am thinking for
the future don't add extra structure (about monoids: L,R,J-Trivial,
...).


> With this, we could keep the same names (although I believe the

If we switch to has_additional_structure, it feels like we are not
using `structure` as an adjective for qualifying a category anymore,
but rather as a noun. So ``all_structure_super_categories`` does not
really make sense. On the other hand, we could possibly name this
method "structure":

	sage: Rings().structure()
	[Category of unital magmas, Category of additive unital	additive magmas]

We could actually get rid of "has_additional_structure" altogether,
and instead have `C.additional_structure()` return `C` by default,
with the possibility to override it to return `None`, or, in the
future, something more meaningful than `C`.

It's perfectly defined: C is a structure category if whenever A and B
are in C and phi is a morphism between A and B for any strict super
category of `C`, then phi is a `C` morphism. And it coincides with the
intuition we have of it: does `C` define some additional structure
(typically an operation) that has to be preserved by `C`-morphisms.

I don't see why `Rngs().Unital()` should suggest it's a structure
category. `A.Unital()` is never a structure category unless `A` is the
category defining `Unital`. That is `A=Magmas()`.

Well, I tried, and the code stunk with duplication, urging me to do it
differently :-) Feel free to try for yourself. In particular, it
becomes painful for categories with axioms or functorial construction
categories where the super categories are computed automatically for
you.

Yup.

Possibly so. There are few structure supercategories so that's rather
cheap too.

I'll answer the rest tomorrow.

After looking over the category, I agree with you that it is modeling a Coxeter system. However I think we should expand the documentation at the beginning of the category to emphasize this (and I'd almost say we should rename the category to reflect this).

I was thinking associative and inverse add structure (to the morphism), but they don't, they just guarantee properties about the elements (and the axioms are preserved under the morphisms). I was also thinking of things like "grading", "topogolical", and "metric" but they aren't axioms (they are/would be functorial constructions). So perhaps axiom categories could not be structure categories by default...more data is probably needed.

Actually that brings up another question, should (regressive) functorial constructions be structure categories by default? Or again do you think more data needed?

However with doing things this way, how is it different than explicitly specifying the full subcategories (well, in reverse)?

OK, but what I meant is that this notion depends on what supercategories of `C` have been defined, not just on `C` itself.

Certainly, but this relies on the the implementation choice of defining `Magmas().Unital()`.  I admit this may be a slightly silly example, but I could imagine a different scenario where the person implementing these categories did not think anyone would need unital magmas, and hence chose to define `Unital()` relative to a more specific category, which in an extreme case could be `Rngs()`.

I wish I had the time, but given that I don't, the best I can do is to just add my perspective as a non-developer but potential user of the category framework...

But to find them I assume one needs to traverse all supercategories and pick out the ones that are structure supercategories, so the time would still depend on the number of all supercategories, or am I mistaken?

What is a functorial construction category?  From the documentation it appears that the idea is that one first defines a construction in some "abstract" sense, and only then decides in which category it takes its values, or even to construct a completely new category for this.  I realise that the code doesn't have to follow mathematical definitions exactly, but this seems to be quite the opposite of the usual pattern of doing things, where defining a function, functor or natural transformation presupposes that a domain and codomain have been fixed.

Possibly so; but then one has to do the same for Weyl groups, and

That felt like a reasonable default which is why I implemented this
way; especially since anyway the only case where there can be
additional structure for the axiom category is within the category
defining the axiom.

> Actually that brings up another question, should (regressive) functorial constructions be structure categories by default? Or again do you think more data needed?

At this point I'd be uncomfortable with it, since e.g. Graded is one
such construction. So I guess it's best done construction by
construction until we have more data. But it may well be that things
should be as for axiom categories: except within the category defining
the construction, there is no additional structure.

In fact, maybe the correct default would be to have,
`A.B().has_additional_structure()` return True if and only if `A` is
the category defining the axiom/regressive construction `B`.

Well, first it's more concise (just return None or `self`) and
involves less duplication.

Also, it gives more information to the system: there are cases where a
category defines no additional structure even though it's not a full
subcategory of any of its direct super categories. Think of some full
subcategory of `Magmas() & AdditiveMagmas()`. Granted, you could have
`full_super_categories` return a join, but this would deviate from
everywhere else (a category never has a join as super category), and
thus probably be a source of problems.

I agree that clarifying what additional structure, if any, a category
defines can be a fundamental guideline for the design. Now, from what
I have seen in practice, new category writers usually start with plain
structure categories, and they do intuitively the right thing (which
typically shows up in the documentation: a XXX is a YYY endowed with
an operation zzz).

Worst case, if XXX does not actually define new structure, the default
behavior remains safe. They just won't get some feature that they most
likely don't need anyway. Remember that the doc of
"is_full_subcategory" specifies:


```
            A positive answer is guaranteed to be mathematically
            correct. A negative answer may mean that Sage has not been
            taught enough information to derive this information. See
            :meth:`full_super_categories` for a discussion.
```


Things are also safe when implementing an existing axiom or
construction in a category where it was not yet there.

The above guideline becomes important when implementing new axioms,
new constructions, or deciding which it should be; but there we can
assume that the developer has gained enough experience.

My point is that the two concepts of axioms and of categories adding
structure are rather orthogonal.

Axioms are relevant when a bunch of categories have something to say
about that axiom. An axiom by itself may or may not add structure.
And there are non structure categories that need not be axioms.

Whether a given category is a structure category or not is the matter
of a single method, and it's not worth the complexity of duplicating
the category class hierarchy just for this.

> (By the way, "over a base ring" is actually something that I am thinking of as another example of "extra structure".)

Here, it's really the category `Modules` that adds the structure. The
class "Category_over_base_ring" is just a technical gadget to handle
the base ring parameter that the categories over base rings
takes. E.g. `Algebras.FiniteDimensional` is a category over a base
ring which does not add structure, whereas `Modules` does.

Yes, this need to be specified explicitly by the person *defining* a
new axiom. But if it's just about implementing an existing axiom for
some category where it was not yet there, then the answer is clear:
there is no new structure.

As we discussed with Travis, I believe something similar should hold
for functorial constructions categories, at least in the covariant
case, but I need to think more about it.

Fair enough: this is indeed not something purely about the abstract
(lattice of) mathematical categories, but about whatever subset has
been actually modeled in Sage. It's not so bad though, since this does
not depend on how the categories have been implemented (e.g. through
axioms or not); just on which categories are implemented or not.

In the above scenario, `Rings` would at first be a structure category;
and then, when the definition of the `Unital` axioms gets lifted up to
some higher category like `Magmas`, Sage would learn that the
structure actually comes from some higher category. That's fine given
the specs about negative answers for "X.is_full_super_category(Y)".

In general, when adding new categories and "moving structure up", one
indeed needs to update the "additional structure" methods of the lower
categories accordingly. Though if one forgets to do it, it should just
cause a lack of new feature, rather than bugs. So we are on the safe
side.

Hi,

I just fixed some small typos, and reverted the change to
`CoxeterGroups.is_structure_category()` as we discussed.

Time for a checkpoint on the current status.

## Permutation groups

Looking back at Travis change, I would want to also revert the change
to `PermutationGroups()`, to let it be a structure category. Indeed,
permutation groups come with a distinguished action, and Wikipedia
states that this action should be preserved by isomorphisms:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation_group#Permutation_isomorphic_groups

Do you agree?

## additional_structure w.r.t. full_super_categories

As discussed above, I believe that having the developer implement
`additional_structure` rather than `full_super_categories` is more
concise and involves less duplication. And also gives more information
(which category define additional structure) which could be further
refined (e.g. "Magmas()" defines "*"), if deemed useful in later
iterations.

Is this acceptable for everyone?

## additional_structure w.r.t is_structure_category

Do we have a consensus that the "additional_structure / structure"
language is better than "is_structure_category /
all_structure_super_categories"? And that for now we can specify that
`C.additional_structure()` shall return `C` or `None`?

If yes, I can implement this change shortly.

## Default for axioms

Currently, axiom categories define no additional structure by default.
To be 100% foolproof even when defining new axioms, one could change
that so an axiom category `C().A()` would by default define additional
structure if and only if `C` is the category defining the axiom `A`.

It would be a relatively small change. The cost is that all but two of
our current axioms would need to have an "additional_structure"
method.  I also need to check whether it's easy to detect if `C` is
the category defining `A`.

Something similar could probably be done for functorial constructions,
but we need more data and thinking to do it right and the current
default is safe in the mean time.

## Anything else?

Cheers,
                             Nicolas

> What is a functorial construction category?

Coming back to this side discussion ...

That's a good question. The documentation is certainly terse and could
take some love. I haven't spent on it the two weeks of hard work I put
on axioms!

>  From the documentation it appears that the idea is that one first defines a construction in some "abstract" sense, and only then decides in which category it takes its values, or even to construct a completely new category for this.  I realise that the code doesn't have to follow mathematical definitions exactly, but this seems to be quite the opposite of the usual pattern of doing things, where defining a function, functor or natural transformation presupposes that a domain and codomain have been fixed.

I am somewhat worried that the Sage implementation might rely (maybe just in subtle ways) on the intuition behind the cases where this advance choice of domain and codomain doesn't matter so much.

Maybe the doc is misleading. But the starting point is really the
functorial construction, that is the collection `(F_C)_C` of related
functors (e.g. the collection of algebra functors: `groups->group
algebras`, `monoids->monoid algebras`, `finite groups->finite groups
algebras`, ...).

Then, the functorial construction category `C.F()` is meant to model
the codomain of the functor `F_C`, which is well defined.

Of course the model might be incomplete. Categories in Sage are an
approximation of the ideal mathematical categories; not all of them
nor features thereof are implemented in Sage.

One possible source of confusion is that the functors `F_C` might not
actually be modeled as a standalone objects in Sage. But that's just
because we did not really need them at this point. In our example, we
just need it was sufficient for now to have the construction
implemented as `G -> G.algebra(QQ)`. In general, at this point, the
central feature really resides in the categories.

Another source of confusion is that some of the uses of the mechanism
for "functorial construction categories" go beyond functorial
constructions.  E.g. for subobjects, quotients, ... there is not
really a collection of functors behind the scene. Still the mechanism
remains valid. It would be nice to come up with a better name and
definition that would cover all cases. That's now #16991.

However I'd rather have fuctorial construction categories being structure categories by default (I believe currently we only have two, graded and with-realizations, but the two I'd like to add, topological and metric, have additional structure).

Yes, the set that is acted upon does seem to qualify as extra structure.

That sounds good to me.

I am in favour of this change.

I am not in favour of this, because it would conflate the notions of "axiom" and "extra structure" (which from my perspective are quite different) even more.

This is not really addressed yet: There is `additional_structure`, but it returns `self` or `None`.

Anyway, I am still somewhat confident that I can make something out of the idea to use Gröbner bases in boolean polynomial rings to deal with deduction rules (à la Wedderburn Theorem) for axioms *and* structures. And then, it would be a matter of filling a dictionary with information about what structure corresponds to what operation.

Probably not, if you talk about the case that `return self` is the default for categories that are not `CategoryWithAxiom`.

If you have a default (which here is chosen so that the test for a full subcategory will not give a false-positive answer by default), then you need to do something special for all cases that are special.

Hmmmmm... Then perhaps only a flag when this infrastructure is initialized ? Doesn't matter much I guess, I it just unpleasant to see the same (empty) function being copy/pasted one thousand times.

Or an attribute `_adds_structure`, and then define something like the following:

```python
def additional_structure(self):
    if getattr(self._adds_structure, None):
        return self
```

In that way, the method `additional_structure` would be defined only in three places (default for categories, for categories with axiom, and for functorial constructions), and non-default behaviour could be requested more light-weight.

Nicolas, what do you think about it? To me, it sounds like a good idea.

But of course I have absolutely no idea of what I am talking about.

Yeah, I agree it's verbose looking. But I am actually quite happy that
the design allowed us to explicitly insert so few additional
information :-)

With this ticket, we are really adding a not so trivial mathematical
information to almost 260+ categories (what shall, or not, be
preserved by morphisms); thanks to the chosen defaults (which depend
on whether we have a category with axiom, a construction category, or
...) we had to special case only about 20 categories. For each of
them, there was a conscious design decision taken, some of which took
a bit of discussion; each such decision has to be documented and
tested. Hence we really want the doctests. In particular, having an
attribute instead of a method would not save anything.

Cheers,
                                 Nicolas

I am open to suggestions. This is completely local to categories and easy to change. That being said, since it's a method on categories, the context is rather well specified. And in this context, it's rather customary to say things like ``a ring is a set endowed with a *structure* of unital magma and unital additive magma satisfying the axioms xxx'':

```
sage: Rings().structure()
frozenset({Category of additive unital additive magmas,
           Category of additive magmas,
           Category of unital magmas,
           Category of magmas,
           Category of sets with partial maps,
           Category of sets})
sage: Rings().axioms()
frozenset({'AdditiveAssociative',
           'AdditiveCommutative',
           'AdditiveInverse',
           'AdditiveUnital',
           'Associative',
           'Distributive',
           'Unital'})
```


(btw: for that purpose, in the first example above, we might want to have a separate method that returns only the lowest categories, i.e. unital magmas and additive unital magmas).

Then, from "structure" to "additional structure", the leap is not too big.
