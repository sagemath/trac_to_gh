Yep, that's the reason... I agree that making it a spkg would be cleaner, but it has only one file and it i really easier to deal with like that ... To be honest if somebody comes in and say very loud "make it a spkg" I will, but I really feel that it's just sparing everybody additonal work the way it is.

Thank you for the review !

Is there anybody who still believes that non-English variable/function names are a good idea? Only in France ;-)

Since "upstream" is just a C file without anything (not even a makefile) I don't see any point in making it a spkg.

> Is there anybody who still believes that non-English variable/function names are a good idea? Only in France ;-)

Come ooooooooooon.. At least there are no accents in the function's name`:-P`

And it is nice sometimes to name a list "liste", because list is a Python keyword `:-P`

> Since "upstream" is just a C file without anything (not even a makefile) I don't see any point in making it a spkg.

Well, just to emphasize that it is some external code, and that it hasn't been reviewed by Sage developpers... That's the normal procedures, but I believe less and less in procedures and laws these days `:-P`

Possible, though for that you would have to compile with `-fextended-identifiers` and use `\uNNNN` escapes instead of accented characters...

And the spelling works for French & German!

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred in Sage.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* component of Sage has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off(). You might
want to run Sage under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
Sage will now terminate.
