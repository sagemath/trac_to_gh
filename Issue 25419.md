We need to change `x_\\ast` to `x_\ast` so that it's valid LaTeX.

I was going to open a ticket later https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/blob/master/sci-mathematics/sage/files/sage-8.3-pdfbuild.patch there are quite a few places you need to apply a fix.

This probably comes from all the "invalid escape sequences" tickets, where I should have checked that pdf doc still builds. My apologies.

I also should have checked. Sorry. Perhaps we should pull in all of FranÃ§ois's changes?

I would have pushed them if someone else hadn't opened this ticket. There is at least another instance that breaks the build. https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/issues/509#issuecomment-399810389

The rest is possibly cosmetics.

It seems that there remains at least one similar issue.

There is definitely `categories/pushout.py`. I got stung by it after going systematically after everything `x_\\ast` and `y_\\ast`.

The PDF docbuild works for me with only my change, for what that's worth.
