Following https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/sage-devel/zijERXXw43M, here are two small and trivial fixes for the reference manual:

* GAP interface misses the G in GAP.
* Weyl group category links to a Wikipedia article that does not exist

Makes sense, and it is not likely to do anything very bad `:-D`

This being said, could you replace the line containing the link with the following ?

```
See the `Wikipedia page of Weyl Groups <Weyl_group>`.
```


That's how we now refer to Wikipedia pages `:-)`

Thanks !

Attached is an extra patch with proper Wikipedia links. In the process of learning Sage's ReST rules, I stumbled upon another broken Wikipedia link: [multicommodity flow](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/graphs/sage/graphs/generic_graph.html#sage.graphs.generic_graph.GenericGraph.multicommodity_flow). I hope that piggybacking this ticket is OK.

Gloops. The one from `generic_graph.py` is probably one of my mistakes `:-)`

Thank you for those patches ! There is no problem at all with having several patches on the same ticket.
