CC:  @fchapoton @jdemeyer

Adds a context manager that can save and restore the state of the `atexit` module.

This functionality is currently only needed by the test runner (see `DocTestTask`) but is non-trivial on Python 3 since the list of registered atexit handler functions is no longer exposed to Python.

This is perhaps the first example we have in sage of a Python 3-only extension module.  Thsi establishes a convention that module names ending with '_py3' should only be built on Python 3.  Typically these should also begin with an underscore to emphasize that they are an implementation detail.  They can then be conditionally imported from a 'public' module of the same name without the `_*_py3`.

We might consider using a similar convention for modules that are Python 2-only, but currently none such examples exist.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24234

If you say so--I felt like it would be good to add a module to `sage.misc` specifically for context managers *in general*.  I'm not sure how I feel about `sage.cpython` for this.

Cython is clever enough to deal with that. Extensions which are explicitly listed take precedence over extensions specified by a glob pattern. See for example

```python
    # Compile this with -Os because it works around a bug with
    # GCC-4.7.3 + Cython 0.19 on Itanium, see Trac #14452. Moreover, it
    # actually results in faster code than -O3.
    Extension('sage.structure.element',
              sources = ['sage/structure/element.pyx'],
              extra_compile_args=["-Os"]),

    Extension('*', ['sage/structure/*.pyx']),

You import `six` but don't use it.\n\n3. The doc of `restore_atexit` is misformatted. The correct format is\n\n```\n    EXAMPLES:\n\n    For this example...\n\n    ...of the ``atexit`` state::\n\n        sage: import atexit\n```\n\n4. I would move the comment \"# These are helper functions...\" outside of the `IF` block. There is also a typo: implements -> implementations.\n\n5. I find it mildly ugly that the signature of the helper functions is different in the Python 2 and Python 3 versions (`cdef inline list` vs. `def`) Since performance doesn't really matter here, I would make all functions simply Python (`def`) functions. Then they can be imported as usual.\n\n6. I think the doctest would be more clear by adding some `print` statements showing the list of registered handlers in appropriate places. Something like\n\n```\nsage: print(\"Initial exitfuncs: {}\".format(_get_exithandlers()))\n```\n\n7.

```

Overall, this looks good. There are various details to be fixed though:

1. The title still says "A home for miscellaneous context managers."

2. You import `six` but don't use it.

3. The doc of `restore_atexit` is misformatted. The correct format is

```
    EXAMPLES:

    For this example...

    ...of the ``atexit`` state::

        sage: import atexit
```

4. I would move the comment "# These are helper functions..." outside of the `IF` block. There is also a typo: implements -> implementations.

5. I find it mildly ugly that the signature of the helper functions is different in the Python 2 and Python 3 versions (`cdef inline list` vs. `def`) Since performance doesn't really matter here, I would make all functions simply Python (`def`) functions. Then they can be imported as usual.

6. I think the doctest would be more clear by adding some `print` statements showing the list of registered handlers in appropriate places. Something like

```
sage: print("Initial exitfuncs: {}".format(_get_exithandlers()))
```

7. Add a comment above `ctypedef struct atexit_callback:` that you are copying the internal structures of the `atexit` module, see `Modules/atexitmodule.c` in the Python sources.

8. The Python 3 version of `_set_exithandlers` says "Replace the list of exit handlers..." but doesn't it instead *append* to the existing list?

9. Add a test with an empty `restore_atexit():` context:

```
with restore_atexit():
    pass
```
showing that the list of registered functions is the same before and after. That would have caught 8.

That's a good point--it should clear the existing list first.
