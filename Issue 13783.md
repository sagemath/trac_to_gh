Keywords: trees

Just as in #8703 we want to implement trees with a fixed number of subtrees (equivalent of binary trees but with m subtrees). Especially to use them in the context of the m-Tamari lattices.Â 

This ticket depends on #8703 as we use the implantation of RootedTrees

This is exactly the existing behaviour in binary trees. So I guess we can keep that for the moment. The recursive check is handled when creating a tree, I think.

```

Some comments:

- I think it would be good to do a `TestSuite` on something like `MAryTree(3, [])` as an extra security check in the `MAryTree.__init__`.
- Do we want this MRO: `class MAryTrees_all(DisjointUnionEnumeratedSets, MAryTrees)`? If it is the other way -- `class MAryTrees_all(MAryTrees, DisjointUnionEnumeratedSets)` -- then I think we can remove the `__call__`. Even without changing the order, do we need it to go up the `MAryTrees` path?
- Do we want to have 2-ary trees create the corresponding `BinaryTree*` class? This would mean we do not have to convert back and forth.
- Related, do we want to have `BinaryTree*` inherit from its corresponding `MAryTree*` class?
- The `LabelledMAryTrees.__call__` can be removed.
- Lowercase error messages: `"Invalid word"` and `"Wrong number of nodes"`.
- There is a non-standard `.. note::` block.
- We should also specify in the `MAryTree` class-level doc that m-ary trees are plane/ordered trees.

I can make these changes tomorrow (tonight I am feeling a little lazy `^^;;`).

Why not? It doesn't make sense to me both mathematically and programmatically.

I'd like to try and help get this finished, though I'm not sure I'm qualified to be final judge and jury on the OOP/MRO aspects. At the very least, I can implement Travis's suggestion of removing ```LabelledMAryTrees.__call__``` , and try to reverse the order of inheritance for ```class MAryTrees_all(DisjointUnionEnumeratedSets, MAryTrees)``` and remove the ```__call__`` and make sure nothing breaks.

In terms of m=2, people seem fine with having conversion for now, and having inheritance be part of a later ticket to get this finished.

I can implement Travis's suggestion that the documentation being clearer about these being ordered/plane trees.

In terms of ```check``` only checking the outer layer, I'm pretty sure this should be fine, and it will recursively check the entire tree. But I can try and make a test case to be sure.

I'll make a thorough pass in the next day or two to test things out, check doc and examples for clarity to somebody that may not be as familiar with m-ary trees, and make sure the doc compiles properly. One thing that's more a note to self to fix later when I do this is that enumerated m-ary trees of a given size is still labeled as 'enumerated set of binary trees of a given size' in the code.

Also reminder to self to check (1) as part of comment:37.
