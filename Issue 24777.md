# Issue 24777: Twist of a TorsionQuadraticModule

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Let `T = TorsionQuadraticModule(V, W)` with free quadratic modules `V` and `W`.
Then `T.twist(n)` should be a shortcut for `TorsionQuadraticModule(V.twist(n), W.twist(n))`
i.e. the underlying modules remain unchanged but the quadratic/bilinear form is rescaled.
