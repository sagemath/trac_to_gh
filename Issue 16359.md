I removed the `except AttributeError` on `is_exact()`, since all rings in Sage implement `is_exact()`.

You can change this to positive review if you are happy with my changes.

Since `Parent` implements `is_exact`, we're okay.

Done. Thanks for doing the review.

EDIT - IDK why the commit didn't change with your update, but 611f2ff... is the correct commit according to the branch. The created/modified being changed is also strange; perhaps a bug in trac *shrugs*.
