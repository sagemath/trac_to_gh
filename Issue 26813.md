With `_Partitions`/`Partitions()`, we decided to make that a global object permanently fixed in memory because it appears in so many different contexts within combinatorics and could appear in tighter loops (e.g., the cycle type of a permutation). So I am not sure about doing the same for `_Combinations`/`Combinations()`. Moreover, it should not have such a significant impact on timings because of the `UniqueRepresentation` behavior. Thus, I think this is something we need to take into more careful consideration. Nevertheless, it should be something on an independent ticket because it is a bigger change.

In `_from_schur_on_basis`, you can (I would probably even say should) use `self._indices` instead of `Compositions()` as `self._indices` has a little more context.

However, this is a good change to do and is quite a speedup.

done, and yes indeed, the `_Compositions` was nonsense, thanks!

I wouldn't say it was nonsense, but just something that would warrant a little more consideration.

Anyways, LGTM. Thanks.

Thanks.  Nonsense, because it did not give any speedup with respect to the topic of this ticket.
