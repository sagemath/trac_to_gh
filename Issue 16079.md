Caching does currently not work for unhashable elements

```
sage: @cached_function
....: def f(x):
....:     return x
....:
sage: K.<a> = Qq(9)
sage: f(a)
TypeError: unhashable type: 'sage.rings.padics.padic_ZZ_pX_CR_element.pAdicZZpXCRElement'
```

In this case `a` should not be hashable since its current operator `==` could
never be made consistent with a non-trivial hash value (cf. #11895).
However, such elements should be cacheable.

This ticket adds a `_cache_key()` for such elements which can be used to hash and
compare unhashable elements. That method should then return a tuple (or
anything else that is hashable) which uniquely identifies the element, e.g. for
p-adics the precision and a lift of the element to the integers.

It seems that the problem really has to do with key comparison in dictionaries, not with hashing or caching specifically.  Given (1) Python's use of `==` for key comparison and (2) Sage's lenient implementation of `==` for elements, we basically cannot use Sage elements as dictionary keys.

One would like a third comparison operator, say `equal`<sup>1</sup>, that regards two objects as equal if and only if all their "mathematically relevant" properties (e.g. value and precision for real or *p*-adic numbers, but not memory location) are the same.  Our caching problems would then disappear if keys were compared using `equal`.  In this hypothetical case, the correct property for hash functions would be `X equal Y` => `hash(X) == hash(Y)`.

- Do I understand correctly that the purpose of `cache_key` can be viewed as emulating the "missing" `equal` by assigning to each object `X` a (hashable) object `cache_key(X)` satisfying the condition `cache_key(X) == cache_key(Y)` <=> `X equal Y` ?

- If so, does the implementation in this ticket satisfy this condition?  (I am mainly worried that the parent of an element `x` does not seem to be encoded in `cache_key(x)`.)

<sup>1</sup> I just looked up the different comparison functions (`=`, `eq`, `eql`, `equal` and `equalp`) in Lisp and `equal` seems to be the closest to what we would need, hence I am using that notation.  However, Lisp uses `eql` by default for hash tables.

I did this on purpose. I replicate the current behaviour in sage, i.e., if you mix elements with different parents in one dictionary, then you really need to know what you are doing. Why not include the parent? Well, are two parents equal if they are `==`-equal, or identical, and what if they can not be hashed (which will be the case for `p`-adic extension fields).

I have no strong opinion on whether or not to include the parent but I think it can be more confusing than helpful. Also keys might unnecessarily be rather large.

Sorry if this sounded off-topic; I was thinking of the dictionaries used in caching, but didn't focus on that because I thought my "objections" were applicable to dictionaries in Sage in general.

I also wanted to avoid focussing on hashing because actually I don't fully understand what the criteria are for objects to be hashable.  The only thing that is clear to me is that if the "mathematical meaning" can change over time (e.g. if the object is a list whose length can change, or a matrix on which you can perform row/column operations), then the object should not be hashable.  But what about *p*-adic elements?  These are supposedly fixed in time.  Why exactly do we want elements of `Zmod(n)` and `RR` to be hashable but not elements of *p*-adic fields?

In that case, shouldn't power series also be unhashable?

Sure, but ``@`cached_function` should also work for user functions, and we have no control over what kind of arguments the user is going to feed those.  It would not be strange for an unsuspecting user to have some complicated function of one variable accepting elements of arbitrary *p*-adic fields, for example.

I would say the only option (for caching purposes) is to make two elements `equal` only if their parents are identical, otherwise you will get cases where the cached function returns values in wrong (equal but not identical) parents.  Hence I would translate this hypothetical `equal` (for elements) in terms of `cache_key` as `x equal y` <=> `parent(x) is parent(y) and cache_key(x) == cache_key(y)`.

I see. I guess this means that we should at least have that if `a != b`, then `some_cached_function(a)` should have a chance to be `!= some_cached_function(b)`.

> > Such an operator might be helpful and would really fix trouble with caching. Then again, when are two objects `equal`? Do their parents have to be identical? Or just `equal`? It is not clear to me whether there can be a generic implementation that makes everybody happy.

> I would say the only option (for caching purposes) is to make two elements `equal` only if their parents are identical, otherwise you will get cases where the cached function returns values in wrong (equal but not identical) parents.  Hence I would translate this hypothetical `equal` (for elements) in terms of `cache_key` as `x equal y` <=> `parent(x) is parent(y) and cache_key(x) == cache_key(y)`.
Ok.

> > I have no strong opinion on whether or not to include the parent but I think it can be more confusing than helpful. Also keys might unnecessarily be rather large. If your application will only get elements from a single parent but you store all the data needed to create the extension field with every element in a cache, that could be really a waste. We could of course only store `id(parent)`; but I'm not sure whether that is too extreme.

> Actually that was the option I was thinking of; it should be fast and won't waste too much memory.  Alternatively, there could be both an "internal" `cache_key` (for use with ``@`cached_method`, where the parent is known) that does not include the parent `id`, and an "external" one (for use with ``@`cached_function`) that does include the parent `id`.
Imho, ``@`cached_method` and ``@`cached_function` should not differ in such a way. Storing the parent's `id` is not a waste of memory and should hardly lead to any surprises.

I'll push a new commit which implements the inclusion of the parent. Thanks for joining this discussion btw.

Now for some timings, before:

```
sage: @cached_function

....:     return x
....:
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: C = crystals.Tableaux(['A',2], shape=[2,1])
sage: p = R(range(100))
sage: q = R(range(10000))
sage: pl = R(range(1000000))
sage: m = matrix(10, 10, range(100))

sage: %timeit foo(5)

sage: %timeit foo(C)

sage: %timeit foo(p)

sage: %timeit foo(q)
10 loops, best of 3: 29.5 ms per loop
sage: %timeit foo(pl)
1 loops, best of 3: 2.85 s per loop

sage: foo(m) # fails as it should
```
with the branch:

```
sage: %timeit foo(5)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.51 µs per loop
sage: %timeit foo(C)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 976 ns per loop

sage: %timeit foo(p)
1000 loops, best of 3: 390 µs per loop
sage: %timeit foo(q)
10 loops, best of 3: 30.4 ms per loop
sage: %timeit foo(pl)
1 loops, best of 3: 3.07 s per loop

sage: foo(m) # Still fails
```
So there's no statistically significant slowdown that I can see.

Some other design questions/comments:

- Is there some reason why you didn't `cpdef _cache_key(self)` or make it into a ``@`lazy_attribute` since it cannot change over the lifetime of the object? The latter would actually speed things up for things whose hash is long to compute (ex. large degree dense polynomials).

- I'm worried about not using the hash for polynomials for caching. I feel that `_cache_key` should result `self` for every hashable object. For example, this no longer would cache as the same element:

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: p = R(range(100))
sage: hash(p)
1520766690567384545
sage: hash(p._cache_key())
-4253877232222459194

sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]

  So now you're requiring everyone to be *very* careful about the parent an object belongs too.

- I'm pretty sure using the parent's `id` will break pickling with the cache. So suppose you create parent `A`, store an element `a` in a cache `C`. Now you pickle and unpickle `a`, `A`, and `C`. The `id` of `A` is different than before the pickle and unpickling, so we are no longer able to retrieve `a` from `C`:

```
sage: R = QQ['x']
sage: p = R(range(100))
sage: hash(p._cache_key())
-4253877232222459194
sage: dumps(p)
# This is some pickle
# Start a new sage session:
sage: s = # The pickle above
sage: hash(loads(s)._cache_key())
2293648738429524678
sage: hash(loads(s)) # This is persistent across sessions
1520766690567384545
```

I think both of the last two are issues that need to be addressed.

Sorry, I'm not familiar with this term.

I can understand this point. Strengthening `==` would be a fairly huge project, affecting a lot of code. Many people would be opposed to this (including myself).

This could be changed.

I do not understand ``@`lazy_attribute` very well. What would be the implications of this? If it can't hurt us, then I don't mind changing it.

> - I'm worried about not using the hash for polynomials for caching. I feel that `_cache_key` should result `self` for every hashable object.
 
`_cache_key()` is only invoked if the object is unhashable. For most hashable objects it raises an error.

> For example, this no longer would cache as the same element:

I don't think so. `_cache_key` would never be called in this case.

This is a compromise for elements which are unhashable. This was already discussed above.

I agree. This is a very serious problem.

From my point of view, only the last point needs to be addressed.

It's a very good idea to include the description in the summary of `cachefunc.pyx`. But I also think it should be in `SageObject._cache_key`; if somebody is wondering what it is good for, that is the first place where they will look for it. It is a duplication of docstrings but I hope it is acceptable.

I made a few changes to your commit:
* I removed some debug statements.
* Your changes to `_cache_key` change the current behaviour. Say you have a tuple of a polynomial over the rationals and a p-adic number. The old version would only call `_cache_key` of the p-adic number and leave the polynomial. Your version unpacks both which is unnecessary. I restored my version of the code.

That is exactly what causes the problem.  Consider the following example with a hypothetical parent class `MyParent` that has unhashable elements but does not have unique representation:

```
sage: @cached_function
sage: def f(x):
....:     """
....:     Return `x^2 + 1` in the parent of `x`.
....:     """
....:     return x^2 + 1
....: 
sage: P = MyParent()
sage: Q = MyParent()  # Q is equal but not identical to P
sage: f(P(0)).parent() is P
True
sage: f(Q(0)).parent() is Q
False  # since the parents are equal, f(q) returns the cached f(p)
sage: f(P(0)) is f(Q(0))
True
```
This already happens before this patch with parent *P* and *Q* where there exists a coercion map compatible with hashing (e.g. **Z** and **Q**):

```
sage: @cached_function
....: def f(x):
....:     return x^2 + 1
....: 
sage: f(ZZ(0)).parent()
Integer Ring
sage: f(QQ(0)).parent()
Integer Ring
sage: f(ZZ(0)) is f(QQ(0))
True
```
However, I think we should avoid this situation whenever possible.
