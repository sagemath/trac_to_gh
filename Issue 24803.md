# Issue 24803: Update additional packages to use sdh_install

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: embray

Original creation time: 2018-03-27 12:10:11

Keywords: destdir combinatorial_designs graphs pari_galdata pari_seadata_small polytopes_db threejs

This updates packages that do nothing more than copy some files to use `sdh_install` from #25039:

* combinatorial_designs
* graphs
* pari_galdata
* pari_seadata_small
* polytopes_db
* threejs

Excluded jmol from this since it's slightly more complicated, and would conflict with #25026.

I added one extra commit to deal with all PARI databases. If you agree, set this ticket to positive review.

See #25665 for a follow up (issue with `threejs`).
