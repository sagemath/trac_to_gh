It's very unclear how to build a distributable Sage.app now. Can it be documented (either in this branch, or on https://github.com/sagemath/binary-pkg)?

Whats unclear? You run "make package-sage" in https://github.com/sagemath/binary-pkg, as documented on the top of the readme.

And how does one specify what will be made? Do you mean to say it will make everything?

Yes, it builds Sage from scratch (as it must). Configuration is in sage.yaml as also described in the readme.

no, I mean the output result: sage.app vs. sage console vs. sage console packaged as dmg

How is it specified?

Default is always the same tarball (not os-specific), which you presumably call "sage console". To build something else use e.g. `make package-sage PACKAGE="OSX DMG image"` as explained at the top of the readme.

What is that `"OSX DMG image"` ? Sage.app or not?

OK, but please add more docs on https://github.com/sagemath/binary-pkg
specifying in all detail how to build each of the 3 types of packages for OSX.

Agreed that the current readme is cryptic, and that Sage 7.1 or whatever shouldn't be released until that's fixed.  Reading [the sage-osx-makefile](https://github.com/sagemath/binary-pkg/blob/master/sage-osx-makefile) didn't make me wiser in comparison to the detailed explanation of the 'old' env vars, and I really don't think one should have to know what a `yaml` file is in order to use these.  I'll try making a PR for that 'upstream' but will likely fail miserably at expressing what is going on...

BTW, will `binary-pkg` ever become part of Sage (is it already)?
