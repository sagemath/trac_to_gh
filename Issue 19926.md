Agreed that the current readme is cryptic, and that Sage 7.1 or whatever shouldn't be released until that's fixed.  Reading [the sage-osx-makefile](https://github.com/sagemath/binary-pkg/blob/master/sage-osx-makefile) didn't make me wiser in comparison to the detailed explanation of the 'old' env vars, and I really don't think one should have to know what a `yaml` file is in order to use these.  I'll try making a PR for that 'upstream' but will likely fail miserably at expressing what is going on...

BTW, will `binary-pkg` ever become part of Sage (is it already)?
