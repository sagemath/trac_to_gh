Assignee: brunellus

I would like to implement my rejected proposal for GSoC during this autumn. [https://google-melange.appspot.com/gsoc/proposal/review/google/gsoc2012/brunellus/1](https://google-melange.appspot.com/gsoc/proposal/review/google/gsoc2012/brunellus/1)

I am going to start with creation of a simple environment for online algorithms and implementation of [http://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-61576-8_70](http://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-61576-8_70) or similar non-trivial algorithm in Cython that will demonstrate the functionality.

I did not get any response to my proposal whatsoever yet â€“ this is your last chance to stop me from doing this before I spend a lot of time on it.
