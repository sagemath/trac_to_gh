While we are at it:

```diff
             Traceback (most recent call last):
             ...
             ValueError: length must be a non-zero positive integer
        """
-        if nocheck == False and c not in self.code():
+        if not nocheck and c not in self.code():
             raise EncodingError("Given word is not in the code")
         return self.unencode_nocheck(c)
```
Could you add the extra space to align the `"""`?

Feel free to set a positive review on my behalf whichever way you decide.
