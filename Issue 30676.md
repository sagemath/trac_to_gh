I think I misunderstood your question. Yes, the variable `SAGE_SPKG_WHEELS` is expected to point to the full location of the wheels when set. 

But I made a mistake - the `simple` is not expected to be part of `SAGE_SPKG_WHEELS`

Well, only specifying known upper and lower bounds for the versions. Maybe it would make sense to add min/max version information in build/pkgs?


> Let's investigate if the pipfile.lock file really needs to include hashes or we can get away with automatically generating a weaker version.

The hashes and the complete dependency tree is what makes pipenv special over requirements.txt. For applications (i.e. sage distribution), it should be fine to pin the versions in the pipfile (in the build folder). Normally you don't want to do this because it makes upgrades harder (if the versions are free, you can simply run `pipenv update` for this). But since upgrades are done differently in sage anyway, it should be fine.

So what you think about the following:
- One pipfile in build (pipfile.lock in gitignore) with all packages in the distribution and version information locked (for users to use pipenv to install pip packages)
- One pipfile in src (pipfile.lock in gitignore) with all dependencies of sagelib and version information as free as possible (for developers to generate a dev environment, and for CI as test environment)

You took the initial pipfile from my ticket, right? They actually look good to me. I'm not sure which packages are missing (as the sagedocs seem to mostly pass with the current ones). Note that pipenv is able to resolve sub-dependencies automatically, so they don't need to be specified in the pipfile (but are in build/pkgs of course).

For the files in build/pkgs/sagelib, are they meant for distribution? In this case, it's probably enough to add only the pipfile in the root there (since src/pipfile is for developers only).

Since the pipfile in the root seems to be only for distribution, why not put it directly in `build/pgks/sagelib`?

Yes

The version of the pipfile that pins the versions to the sage distribution's versions will need the pinnings of these dependencies.

Pipenv will use the prebuilt wheels anyway, so there is no point in installing build dependencies for these packages, right?

This seems to work well now - but the variants using pipenv fail in mysterious ways. I have marked these variants as "experimental" in the comments in `build/pkgs/sagelib/src/tox.ini`.

Ready for review.

One more point for discussion is if the pipfile should list the dependencies or if it is enough to only put them in the install_requires.
Normally, the advice seems to be to put them only in install_requires, but that's mainly to capture missing dependencies and not bother to keep the files in sync. But since they are now automatically generated, I'm not sure how to precede.

no idea about that `jupyterlab-widgets`, we don't even seem to have such a package in Sage.

PS. `./sage --pip install jupyterlab-widgets` didn't fix it.
