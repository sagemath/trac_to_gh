# Issue 2630: Python API for sage-ptest

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/2630

From #311, 
  a Python API so testing is integrated into the SAGE shell (and into the notebook, although this is not particularly powerful at this time)
This ought to be easy to do now that sage-ptest is written in python.
