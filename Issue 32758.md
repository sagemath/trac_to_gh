As a follow-up to #32973 and #32981, there are a few other ways we could improve the `--warn-long` flag to keep our test suite speedy:

1. Add a flag like `-Werror` to the test runner, so that warnings are turned into errors that are reflected in the exit code. This will allow the CI to catch them.
2. Summarize the `--warn-long` warnings at the end of the test run, so that they're all visible to the user without having to dig through a log file.
