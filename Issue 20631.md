I'm getting this doctest failure on at least two machines:

```
sage -t --long src/sage/libs/homfly.pyx
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/libs/homfly.pyx", line 93, in sage.libs.homfly.homfly_polynomial_dict
Failed example:
    homfly_polynomial_dict(trefoil) # optional - libhomfly
Expected:
    {(0, -4): -1, (0, -2): -2, (2, -2): 1}
Got:
    {(-4, 0): -1, (-2, 0): -2, (-2, 2): 1}
**********************************************************************
```


I have no idea about the mathematics, I'm just running the tests to check Sage. Unless somebody comes up with a better idea, I'm just marking this test as random.

I believe this is my fault; I swapped the order of the variables and forgot to re-run this doctest with explicitly passing `optional=libhomfly,sage`. I also get this error and it is just a matter of updating the doctest.

Well, so hold on - is it random or not?  If it's not random, then the test should just be changed, not marked random (untested and hence broken, as they say).

It is not random. Somehow I got it in my mind that this ticket fixed the doctest.

Can somebody of you then fix it properly please?
