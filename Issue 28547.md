Thanks for making all doctest passed.
I gave a more in-depth look at the code and it looks very good.
I've just performed some reviewer tweaks, which I pushed in the new branch. You can see the (minor) changes [here](https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit?id=0823e29c5fa02815c71a23f770f8ee226eec7c76).
In particular
- a doctest block has been corrected by adding a missing `::`
- some PEP 8 enforcement has been performed
- doctests raising an exception have been rewritten via `Traceback...` instead of a `try` block
- the header  `# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-` has been added to the file `tensor_with_indices.py`, in order to get rid of the non-ascii error revealed by the patchbot.

Do you agree with the above changes?

Hi! 

 I completely agree! We should open another ticket or a discussion of devel to discuss this (I would at the very least ask Eric Gourgoulhon for validation). 

 To begin the discussion, I see other issues with the current implementation and methods.
For instance, it's not possible to define the symmetries of the riemann tensor. This is related to the fact that (anti)symmetrize ony takes a set of indices as argument and then consider the action of the natural action of the symmetric group this set.
It would be appreciable to define the symmetrization via an action of some group on the set indices. Antisymmetrization would need also a 'signature' morphism G-->{1,-1}. More generally, one could consider linear group action symmetries.
