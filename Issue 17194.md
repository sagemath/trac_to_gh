# Issue 17194: no loops in edge-vertex graphs of polyhedra

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: chapoton

Original creation time: 2014-12-02 09:26:16

Keywords: polyhedron, loop

So far, the vertex_graph method of polyhedra returns looped graphs.

This seems to be a strange thing to do.

Let us change that to graphs with no loops.

Weird. And it seems to have been done on purpose `O_o`

No broken doctests anywhere in Sage ? `O_o`

I have not tested the full sage. This has to be checked, for sure.
