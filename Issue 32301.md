remove a useless import of `round` in `_build_flow_graph`.

Perhaps there should be a better version of `edge_iterator`?

this

```
+            def good_edge(e):
+                return frozenset(e)
```

could be

```
good_edge = frozenset
```

(3 times, at least)

The other alternative to avoid use of `good_edge` is to write distinct code for directed and undirected graphs. Since most of the computation time is in the milp resolution, the current solution might be good enough.
