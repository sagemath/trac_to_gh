I agree with rws that it's not 100% clear why this is necessary, and I won't be looking for typos or syntax errors (though it mostly looks fine assuming `git trac` does the same thing as `sage -dev` in some sense), but did find one things that should be fixed even if one agrees with "the author".

```
This section gives an example how to review using the ``sage``
```
One of the times that shows up you actually have used `git trac` - toward the end of the diff.

Long comment addressed (presumably) to Volker, though of course anyone else who has been writing things like the `sage -dev` or `git trac` stuff is more than welcome to join in:

The overly dismissive tone about the `dev` scripts is unnecessary, and to be honest seems a little insulting to the people who worked hard on creating those - which doesn't include me, and t think might even include said author of the guide, which confuses me?  

In any case, relegating the dev script part to something that isn't really even mentioned seems... odd.  I think that "the author" has an overly optimistic view of how easy it is to overcome all the hurdles associated with development.  And yes, Virginia, some open source projects don't collaborate using git.  It would be helpful to have this discussion on sage-devel about this, rather than a somewhat combative tone in what is supposed to be an educational document providing the easiest path to doing things like reviewing a patch.   A new reader will be really confused by this - imagine someone who is starting to use a terminal for the first time encountering the vim/emacs debate; it would just turn them off.

Honestly, not having to do things like install git (which is, after all, *in* Sage) or all the other stuff involved really helps a true newcomer.  I mean, look how much one has to do before getting to reviewing.  (That is a problem with the current layout of the devel guide as well, but is made more egregious by this change).

I'm willing to help work on a different layout for the devel guide that addresses your concerns about not having enough git resources and mine about making sure the most basic interface is prominent (and correct, which as you note the documentation isn't always, or complete).

This is an assumption. "Assuming the necessity ..." can equally mean that *I am assuming it. I do but I have much less overview than you both.

You are of course welcome to improved the docs later, but I think the current state is enough of an improvement over what we have that it should go in asap.

On a practical level, we have to start with "here is how to make a branch". If you don't make a branch *FIRST* then that means you edit the master and that will cause a lot of pain later on.

Right, but if you don't know **why** you are making a branch it is even more confusing.  For now, it's that part of the organization I'm referring to - it assumes quite a bit of what the reader wants to do.  What is nice about the current format is that it says [stuff about what to do](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/vbraun/doc/developer/dev_script.html#contributing-to-the-sage-source-code) for the most common use cases *first*, leaving things like setting up git or even acquiring a Trac account to later.

Perhaps along these lines, here is something either wrong or confusing.

```
[user@localhost sage]$ git checkout master
[user@localhost sage]$ git branch last_twin_prime
[user@localhost]$ git branch
  master
* last_twin_prime
```
But it says "Also note that git branch creates a new branch, but does not switch to it. For this, you have to use git checkout:" - yet the star is on `last_twin_prime`.

I've just installed these scripts, so while novice impressions are fresh:
- I have cloned the original repository from trac following "Tentative conventions" wiki, so my "origin" in git already points to trac and seems a bit silly to add it as "trac" as well. In general, it would be nice to have some clear statement in the "setting up" of why there is a github version as well and when one should use it. Maybe there is already something somewhere, but I don't recall seeing it. I do recall someone (Volker?) saying that it saves bandwidth.
- There are way too many versions of installing "git trac" ;-) And "python setup.py install" has to be run as sudo, would be nice to add it to the documentation. I guess this is why there is also an option of just adding it to PATH.
- "Configuration" gives two commands for setting remote trac as read-only or read-write, and only one of the two has to be used, which is not immediately clear. And who has to use read-only anyway?
- Is it possible to have "parameter TAB completion"? I.e. when I type "git trac <TAB>" I'd like to see these "create", "push" etc. as it happens with regular git commands, but instead I get local file listing.
- Enabling "git help trac" would be nice as well!
- Perhaps password in the example can be entered in single quotes to avoid problems with special characters, i.e.

```
$ git trac config --user=Myself --pass='s3kr1t'
```
- And adding there an appropriate chmod would be nice since by default .git/config is 0644

```
$ chmod 0600 .git/config
```

Okay, let me fix that and try to slightly rearrange this somewhat today.  My main ideas would be (none of which would take very long once I have an uninterrupted stretch)
* Make top of index.html a little more organized, showing coming attractions (for those reading it and not just searching in it)
* Rename "Collaborate Development" to "Collaborative Development with Git Trac" and make it its own (sub)section
* Probably making the "Writing Code for Sage" a main section, while putting all the git/trac related stuff into a separate main section
* Putting the notebook developer stuff at the end again (and possibly warning that some of the info may be outdated)
* Miscellaneous wording fixes.

> For a complete newbie approach it might be nice to have a `sage upgrade 12345` to just download the ticket branch and rebuild sage without any user intervention. We can do that in the followup.


Yes, that is true, but you are right it would definitely be outside the scope of this ticket - and I'm not sure I'd want "upgrade" as the word.

And it's IMHO a bit weird to assume someone would start *developing* Sage without (ever?) having it installed... 

Of course there are also binary dists, but at least the source code of the Sage library is always included, and I think most users will have taken a look at it before considering contributing, or will at least have seen it in tracebacks ;-) or by having typed `foo??`.

Still, there should probably be a special section or a whole chapter for "absolute beginners", starting e.g. with how to fix a typo in the documentation, i.e., where to find the relevant file(s), how to edit them, how to rebuild the docs (and also the Sage library, in case of docstrings), then introducing what revision control systems are all about, that Sage (now) uses `git`, and how Sage development is organized (trac -- not just a bugtracker, but used for *all* Sage development; "stable" releases vs. "development" releases, how reviewing happens, the relevant mailing lists...) -- and the latter mostly in prose, without terminal screen dumps, and without mentioning dozens of commands and options (whether with or without referencing other sections) in the first place.

Oh, I was referring to the [draft](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/vbraun/doc/developer/walk_through.html#obtaining-the-sage-source-code):

*"Obviously you need the Sage source code to develop, so we download it from github which is a public read-only mirror (=faster) of our internal git repository [...]"*

Or, how *I* read it:

*"Obviously **you** need the Sage source code to develop, so **we** download it from github [WTF?!] which is a public read-only mirror [Aha, so I previously installed the wrong version?] (=faster) [Ok.] of **our __internal__** [!?!?!] git repository [...]"*




Sorry for *my* words being misleading... :-/




P.S.:  A mirror is always "read-only".  (Otherwise it would be a proxy, or an instance of a distributed system.)

That is what makes Perl so unusable for large projects. Code written by two different people generally looks like it was written in completely different languages ;)

I don't know about that sickly green ;-) is that an official Sage color?  (Is it sage?)  But I don't think we'll probably come up with a better compromise than this, so as long as the design folks don't complain I'll say this is okay.

I don't want to give final positive review because I did so some rearranging and want someone to confirm it builds the doc properly, but it all seems fine on my end so that's all that remains, since I definitely went over everything else pretty carefully.
