Keywords: random_fail

#27904 reduced the upper limit from 10 to 2 seconds, now this occasionally fails with high cpu load:

```
File "src/sage/interfaces/expect.py", line 1150, in sage.interfaces.expect.Expect._expect_expr
Failed example:
    w = walltime(t); 0.3 < w < 2
Expected:
    True
Got:
    False
```
