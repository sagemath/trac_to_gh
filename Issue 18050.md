# Issue 18050: Fix percentage in sage-coverageall

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2015-04-23 12:18:16

The coverage score is a factor 100 too large:

```
(sage-sh) $ src/bin/sage-coverageall
...
Overall weighted coverage score:  9486.0%
Total number of functions: 38096
We need   53 more functions to get to 95% coverage.
We need 1577 more functions to get to 99% coverage.
```

This was caused by #17776 badly changing the string formatting.
