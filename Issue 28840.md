This is kind of a while-we-are-at-it thing, but I think we can avoid the double call to `f.dict()` and `g.dict()` here:

```diff
         if not coeff:
             coeff = self.base_ring().one()
         else:
-            coeff = self.base_ring()(next(itervalues(f.dict())) /  next(itervalues(g.dict())))
+            nf = next(iter(f.dict().values()))
+            ng = next(iter(g.dict().values()))                    # (trailing whitespace too)
+            coeff = self.base_ring()(nf / ng)
 
-        f = next(iterkeys(f.dict()))
-        g = next(iterkeys(g.dict()))
+        f = next(iter(f.dict()))
+        g = next(iter(g.dict()))
```

by instead doing

```python
        fd = f.dict()
        gd = g.dict()
        fk = next(iter(fd))
        gk = next(iter(gd))

        if not coeff:
            coeff = self.base_ring().one()
        else:
            coeff = self.base_ring()(fd[fk] / gd[gk])

        f = fk
        g = gk
```
