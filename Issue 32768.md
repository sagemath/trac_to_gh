# Issue 32768: Add feature for pdftocairo

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33005

Original creator: slabbe

Original creation time: 2021-12-09 17:12:35

feature `pdf2svg` was introduced in #32650 in order to be used in #20343. But it turns out that `pdftocairo -svg` is more widely used, for instance it is available on cygwin as opposed to `pdf2svg`, see #32650#comment:43

Do we want to remove `pdf2svg` from sage, because I can use only `pdftocairo` in #20343 instead of `pdf2svg`?

Are there any difference in functionalities between `pdf2svg` and `pdftocairo` ? Are the svg produced strictly equal ? Even if `pdf2svg` is not available on some platform, it could make sense to keep it.

My initial motivation for using `pdf2svg` was to construct `svg` files to laser cut Wang tiles as shown in [this blog post](http://www.slabbe.org/blogue/2018/09/wooden-laser-cut-jeandel-rao-tiles/). I never tried `pdftocairo -svg` yet. But typically, in front of the laser cuting machine, things always do not work as expected. Therefore, I think it is good to keep both since it allows to try the other one of one does not work well.

Changing the milestone to 9.5 to allow #20343 to get in.
