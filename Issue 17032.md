# Issue 17032: Live documentation within ipython notebook

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: tmonteil

Original creation time: 2014-10-31 16:05:14

Keywords: documentation notebook ipython

The documentation (reference manual, thematic tutorials,...) is available from the Sage notebook as live worksheets. An important step in supporting ipython notebook for Sage is to have this feature available within ipython notebook.

I have no idea on the right way to achieve this though (e.g. should it be done by Sage or requested at IPython level ?).

Determined to be invalid/duplicate/wontfix (closing as "wontfix" as a catch-all resolution).
