Keywords: documentation notebook ipython

The documentation (reference manual, thematic tutorials,...) is available from the Sage notebook as live worksheets. An important step in supporting Jupyter notebook for Sage is to have this feature available within Jupyter notebook.

I have no idea on the right way to achieve this though (e.g. should it be done by Sage or requested at IPython / Jupyter level ?).
