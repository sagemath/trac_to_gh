In a fresh Sage, assumptions on symbols within expressions are preserved when Maxima returns the same expression in an unevaluated integral. But in this case the domain/flag information of `m` is somehow cleared/deleted:

```
sage: _ = var('m')
sage: (x^m / sqrt(2+3*x)).integral(x)
integrate(x^m/sqrt(3*x + 2), x)
sage: _= var('m', domain='integer')
sage: (x^m / sqrt(2+3*x)).integral(x)
integrate(x^m/sqrt(3*x + 2), x)
sage: _.operands()[0].operands()[1]
x^m
sage: _.operands()[1].is_integer()
False
```

`assume(m, 'integer')` cannot restore the flag of `m` in the returned integral.

The problem does not occur without the first two lines.  Maybe the first creation of `m` does somehow irrevocably set something in Maxima (or Sage's module for backtranslation)?

Actually hashes have nothing to do with it. The vars are not the keys in the dictionary and, even if they were, hash makes no difference because keys are compared via `bool(a==b)`, ie `ex.__nonzero__()` is used and there lhs-rhs is zero even for vars with different flags or hashes.
