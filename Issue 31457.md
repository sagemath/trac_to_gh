There are still several pynac bug tickets that may not be hard to fix, so I think I will be posting quite a few more pynac patches in the next few months, so let's wait on this. But it would be good to make an upgrade before the 9.4 release.

Thanks, Dima, that's great! I am not concerned about the "author", so nothing needs to be done, as far as I'm concerned.

Copying these patches to the pynac repository has been on my to-do list for a long time, but I never got around to it, so thanks for doing this!  In the future, I'll try to save you (and the distro managers) some trouble by making the appropriate PRs.

It's important to keep tickets focused. In particular for a blocker ticket like this one, which creates an urgency to get it in.

The urgent need to add support for gcc 11 is entirely unconnected to a decision to drop support for the gcc 4 versions used in some of our supported distributions.

It is poor practice to connect these two issues arbitrarily.
