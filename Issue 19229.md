Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jdemeyer

All these should return the same value:

```
sage: RealField(53, rnd="RNDD")(continued_fraction(-1/2))
-0.500000000000001
sage: RealField(53, rnd="RNDU")(continued_fraction(-1/2))
-0.499999999999999
sage: RealField(53, rnd="RNDN")(continued_fraction(-1/2))
-0.500000000000000
```
