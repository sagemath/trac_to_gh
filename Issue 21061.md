# Issue 21061: Implement abelian_variety() to elliptic curves

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21298

Original creator: klui

Original creation time: 2016-08-20 02:38:29

Keywords: elliptic curve, modular abelian variety

If `E` is an elliptic curve then `E.abelian_variety()` will return `E` as a modular abelian variety.

What other base rings should this work for?  You should document those, and also perhaps add this function so it is a method on those elliptic curves.  Otherwise, I'd remove the `base_ring=QQ`.

I removed it. The base_ring option is a bit strange in this situation.
