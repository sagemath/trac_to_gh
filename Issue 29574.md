In analogy to the existing method `normal_cone`.

For #29806 (Gram-Brianchon formula) I only need the (affine) tangent cones of a face, tcone(P, F). See for example https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/1.9781611972443.ch6 Def 6.2.2

But for completeness it would also be nice to have the (homogeneous) tangent cone, AKA the cone of feasible directions.
