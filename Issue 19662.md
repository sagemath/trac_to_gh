Currently, the Sage is compiled with `-w` which suppresses all warnings. I don't think that is a good idea because there might be useful warnings.

One kind of warning which appears a lot is unused functions or variables because of the way that Cython generates code. Such warnings also appear in external Cython packages which use Sage. Therefore, we simply compile Python with `-Wno-unused` which is then passes down to all Python packages.

I noticed something else strange: Python puts `CFLAGS` *before* its own flags like `-O3`. But there is also a variable `EXTRA_CFLAGS` which is put after Python's flags. Since we usually want user flags to override the package flags, we put the user's `CFLAGS` into `EXTRA_CFLAGS`.
