similar to ticket:27501 all_simple_paths  also fails to output all simple paths (as per definition) in case of multiple edges present inside the Digraph.


```
....: sage: eg = DiGraph(multiedges=True)
....: sage: eg.add_edge(0,1,1)
....: sage: eg.add_edge(0,2,3)
....: sage: eg.add_edge(1,4,3)
....: sage: eg.add_edge(2,3,5)
....: sage: eg.add_edge(2,4,15)
....: sage: eg.add_edge(2,4,12)
....: sage: eg.add_edge(4,5,7)
....: sage: eg.add_edge(4,5,8)
....: sage: eg.add_edge(5,6,2)
....: sage: eg.all_simple_paths(starting_vertices=[0],ending_vertices=[6])
```


it currently returns -


```
[[0, 1, 4, 5, 6], [0, 2, 4, 5, 6]]
```

 
but should return 



```
[[0, 1, 4, 5, 6],
 [0, 1, 4, 5, 6],
 [0, 2, 4, 5, 6],
 [0, 2, 4, 5, 6],
 [0, 2, 4, 5, 6],
 [0, 2, 4, 5, 6]]
```


Functions like all_paths_iterator also require some changes.

There is a merge conflict in this branch.

I think you should not add several times a path to the queue, and only yield it a sufficient number of times. Note however that this will work for unweighted paths only, but this is enough for now.

You should not just get last version of `digraph.py`.

You should first update your develop branch

```
git checkout develop
git pull
make
```

And then rebase your branch on last beta, for instance like that

```
git checkout -b tmp develop
git fetch trac u/gh-rajat1433/27504_all_simple_paths_multi:tmp2
git merge tmp2 -m "trac #27504: Merged with 8.7.beta7"
```

you will get a message indicating that merge failed.

Then, open file digraph.py and search for `<<<<` to go to the line with the merge conflict. Fix it, and then commit the changes.

- what does `empty` mean

```
         - ``data`` -- dictionary (default: ``empty``); optional parameter to
```

  it's not a Python keyword, right? By default you just have nothing. An alternative is to use `data=None` instead of `**data`...

- a more direct code

```diff
-                                edge_paths=[]
-                                edge_paths.extend(cartesian_product([my_dict[e] for e in zip(newpath[:-1], newpath[1:])]))

- instead of `if (e[0], e[1]) in my_dict.keys():`, you can do directly `if (e[0], e[1]) in my_dict: `

- You create `my_dict = {}` and later `dat = my_dict`. Why not using a single variable called `data` ?

- why are you converting the `Counter` to a `dict` ? I think you can pass the Counter to `_all_paths_iterator`. And just call it `data`.


- don't add uncessary empty lines

I was just asking to do e.g.

because the comment was place here because we had only one kind of returned format. Now that we have several, we can move the comment.
