In #31721 a generic `__pow__` has been introduced on `Parent`. It might be more natural to have this operation directly on `CategoryObject`. However
- do we have objects inheriting from `CategoryObject` but not from `Parent`/`Element` and would benefit from this `__pow__`?
- check that it does not hurt performance of `Element.__pow__`.

We also enhance the documentation to explain how `Parent` (and possibly `CategoryObject`) can overload `__pow__`.

IMO, it is always best to put things in as general of a place as possible. Even if there is not a use-case currently, that doesn't mean there won't be one in the future. The bigger thing is the performance of `Element` subclasses.
