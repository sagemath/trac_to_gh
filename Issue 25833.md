Indeed. Let us now wait for the patchbot before setting back to positive.

On OSX:

```
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/combinat/designs/incidence_structures.py", line 1406, in sage.combinat.designs.incidence_structures.IncidenceStructure.packing
Failed example:
    IncidenceStructure([[1,2],[3,"A"],[2,3]]).packing()
Expected:
    [[1, 2], [3, 'A']]
Got:
    [['A', 3], [1, 2]]
**********************************************************************
1 item had failures:
   1 of   3 in sage.combinat.designs.incidence_structures.IncidenceStructure.packing
    [322 tests, 1 failure, 5.18 s]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage -t --long src/sage/combinat/designs/incidence_structures.py  # 1 doctest failed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

I don't think its your fault, you just happened to change memory allocations slighly so that this bug surfaces. Still, please fix.

ok, this should do the job. I have hardened the doctest and I am setting back to positive.

Note: this precise doctest was never run before, because it was preceded by "sage;" (note the last character).

FYI grep founds two more `;`-characters.

For another ticket, I think.

There are two other places in the Sage library containing doctests which are skipped because of `sage;` (plot/graphics.py and rings/polynomial/pbori.pyx), and one of those leads to a doctest failure (not hard to fix) when actually run. Have those been fixed in other tickets?


---

Comment by chapoton created at 2018-09-01 16:14:08

plot/graphics is fixed here, the other I do not know

EDIT: the other too

Sorry, I should have checked.

Resolution: fixed

True. I kind of wait this in #26175.

in fact, this is already done here!
