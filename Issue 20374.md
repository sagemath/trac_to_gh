Hi,\\
You might want to use more pythonic syntax e.g.



```python
def substitute(x):
    mask = (1 << b) - 1
    xl = (x >> b) & mask
    xr = x & mask
    for sb in sboxes:
        xl, xr = sb(xl) ^ xr, xl
    return (xl << b) | xr
```


also in my opinion `is_bent` should return `False` instead of raising `ValueError`.

Hi,

Thanks for looking at the code. I have applied your suggestion on both is_bent() and is_almost_bent(). Btw, can you review this ticket ?

Hi Martin,

Thanks for looking at this. I should have asked this before, but can you point out at which lines you see such issue ? This makes me a bit confuse before.
