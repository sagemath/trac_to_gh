CC:  jipilab @laisrast

Keywords: combinatorial polyhedron, maximal chain

We implement a method that returns a maximal chain of the face lattice of a combinatorial polyhedron without empty face and universe.

With this we can easily obtain vertices spanning the affine hull of a polytope.

Looks good to me.
Some minor things:
* Say that the faces are listed in an increasing order.
* Change the word "universe" to something more familiar (e.g. the whole polyhedron, the maximal face..)
