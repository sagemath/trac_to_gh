# Issue 28880: Implement a maximal chain for combinatorial polyhedron

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29117

Keywords: combinatorial polyhedron, maximal chain

We implement a method that returns a maximal chain of the face lattice of a combinatorial polyhedron without empty face and universe.

With this we can easily obtain vertices spanning the affine hull of a polytope.

Looks good to me.
Some minor things:
* Say that the faces are listed in an increasing order.
* Change the word "universe" to something more familiar (e.g. the whole polyhedron, the maximal face..)

It would be nice if you could add this feature for polyhedron objects as well?

I will wait for the patchbot to finish, then I will put it on positive review.
