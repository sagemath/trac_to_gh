Reported in https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!topic/sage-support/wiwEbgILB14:

```
z=var('z'); solve(conjugate(z)==1+i, z)
 [z == (I + 1)]
```

Maybe solve should work around the Maxima conjugate bug.

Changing keywords from "" to "solve, conjugate, maxima, wrong result".

The "sage-support" discussion gives excerpts of posts
to the "maxima" mailing list.

A workaround discussed there consists in working with
real and imaginary parts and solving for those.

Moving to 9.4, as 9.3 has been released.
