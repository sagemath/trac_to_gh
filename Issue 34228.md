# Issue 34228: Invalid escape sequence in special.py

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/34465

Original creator: jhpalmieri

Original creation time: 2022-08-31 21:21:42

I just saw this when doctesting:

```
/Users/jpalmier/Desktop/Sage/git/sage/src/sage/functions/special.py:852: DeprecationWarning: invalid escape sequence '\p'
```

To reproduce: assuming you have an editable build, run `touch src/sage/functions/special.py` and then doctest a file.

The warning is shown when jupyterlab starts. It is very visible.

I cannot reproduce it... Sorry for noise.

It is reproduced when the python file is compiled for the first time. Anyway, not critical.

You should be able to reproduce it by "touch"ing the file, which will force a recompilation. I agree, probably not critical.
