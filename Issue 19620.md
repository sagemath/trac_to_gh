# Issue 19620: Replace certificates of *sagemath.org

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Now that [let's encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) is available for everybody, the github.com certificate of sagemath.org and the self-signed certificate of trac.sagemath.org should be replaced. Then ***https*** can be used everywhere by default.

Hey Miguel,

I saw you got access to update the wiki certificate. In case you have the rights, could you update the certificate to also cover
* sagemath.org
* www.sagemath.org
* trac.sagemath.org
* patchbot.sagemath.org

Thanks.

I would be happy to do so, but I don't have access to them. If someone could grant me ssh access I can set them up.

You can contact me for the patchbot

Otherwise, here is what chrome tells me:

```
Mixed Content: The page at 'https://wiki.sagemath.org/buildbot/details' was loaded over HTTPS, but requested an insecure script 'http://aleph.sagemath.org/static/jquery.min.js'. This request has been blocked; the content must be served over HTTPS.
Mixed Content: The page at 'https://wiki.sagemath.org/buildbot/details' was loaded over HTTPS, but requested an insecure script 'http://aleph.sagemath.org/embedded_sagecell.js'. This request has been blocked; the content must be served over HTTPS.
Mixed Content: The page at 'https://wiki.sagemath.org/buildbot/details' was loaded over HTTPS, but requested an insecure image 'http://sagemath.org/pix/sage_logo_v3_s_icon.png'. This content should also be served over HTTPS.
```

So maybe *aleph.sagemath.org* should also be converted.

The certificate used for www.sagemath.org contains some strange alternative names:

```
DNS Name: ssl375118.cloudflaressl.com
DNS Name: *.azhdd.com
DNS Name: *.sagemath.org
DNS Name: *.sagemathcloud.com
DNS Name: *.vivatapasfood.com
DNS Name: azhdd.com
DNS Name: sagemath.org
DNS Name: sagemathcloud.com
DNS Name: vivatapasfood.com
```

Interesting ! Both these websites do exist.

That is probably due to the use of cloudflare. It is a cache service that many websites hire to improve performance and protect against attacks; but it essentially works by putting cloudflare servers as a man in the middle before the actual servers, so the ssl session ends there. Probably they use these multiple certificates because they cover all those clients with the same server/VM/container.

www.sagemath.org is still not using https
