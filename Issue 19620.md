Now that [let's encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) is available for everybody, the github.com certificate of sagemath.org and the self-signed certificate of trac.sagemath.org should be replaced. Then ***https*** can be used everywhere by default.

Hey Miguel,

I saw you got access to update the wiki certificate. In case you have the rights, could you update the certificate to also cover
* sagemath.org
* www.sagemath.org
* trac.sagemath.org
* patchbot.sagemath.org

Thanks.

I would be happy to do so, but I don't have access to them. If someone could grant me ssh access I can set them up.

You can contact me for the patchbot

Otherwise, here is what chrome tells me:

```
Mixed Content: The page at 'https://wiki.sagemath.org/buildbot/details' was loaded over HTTPS, but requested an insecure script 'http://aleph.sagemath.org/static/jquery.min.js'. This request has been blocked; the content must be served over HTTPS.

```

So maybe **aleph.sagemath.org** should also be converted.
