# Issue 20743: LatticePoset: certificate for non-modularity, part 1

This patch will add a function to get a pentagon sublattice, if it exists.

Interface part of this will be `certificate`-options to functions checking if a lattice is (semi)modular.

Part of "add certificates" -serie. I guess that this is useful for teaching at least.

But what did I wrong? The patch seems to work, but Branch-field is red.

Ok, I've spent a bit of time convincing myself the math works out with the description, and I think it needs some clarification. 

Strictly speaking, what the description mentions corresponds to Birkhoff's condition for weak semimodularity. Just looking at the definition of semimodularity, it appears one only needs a pair of elements `a` and `b` so that `a` covers the meet and `b` is not covered by the join. It's only because weakly semimodular is equivalent to semimodular for finite lattices* that we can further require that `b` covers the meet and `a` is covered by the join.

*(technically lattices of finite length and upper continuous relatively atomic lattices...whatever that means)

True, minimal certificate for non-semimodularity would be two elements. They can be extracted from this pentagon.

What about non-modular and non-distributive lattices? Should we return elements `(a, b, x)` violating definition of modularity, and same with distributivity?

After this we could think about best implementation. Maybe `is_distributive(certificate=True)` should first call `is_modular(certificate=True)` which could call `is_upper_semimodular()` and `is_lower(semimodular)`. But if a non-distributive lattice is modular, then `is_distributive()` runs it's own subprogram to find the three elements of `M_3` sublattice.

#21002 kind of overrides this, so I think this one can be closed.

Kevin, just asking confirmation for this.

Didn't realize I needed to do a thing for person reporting/authoring a ticket setting it to wontfix.

Well, I don't know if it's really meaningful for tickets like this. I have just used to ask confirmation for even `wontfix`es, see #5964 as a trivial example.

Resolution: wontfix

Determined to be invalid/duplicate/wontfix (closing as "wontfix" as a catch-all resolution).
