There is a bug in SSLv3, see for example https://securityblog.redhat.com/2014/10/15/poodle-a-ssl3-vulnerability-cve-2014-3566/

If I am correct, quick way to disable this is edit `SAGE_ROOT/local/lib/python/ssl.py` and add `:!SSLv3` to end of `_DEFAULT_CIPHERS`. This should be made default.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17164

I don't know, I just saw this, fairly randomly.

Exactly what would we want to do to fix this - upgrade Python?  I don't know that we can dump the openssl package, there is nothing to replace it.

Isn't there any configuration file that could be modified by Sage team until package itself is corrected?

Quite possibly!  Actually, probably could just patch Python right now.  But the point is that *I* don't know how :-)  Since this seems pretty important, do you want to email sage-devel to make people aware of it?
