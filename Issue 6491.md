Keywords: cohomology ring finite p-group

I suggest to distribute our package for the computation of modular cohomology rings of finite p-groups as an optional package.

## Authors

- Simon A. King (Since recently at National University of Ireland, Galway)
- David J. Green (Friedrich-Schiller-UniversitÃ¤t Jena)

## Installation

The package can be installed by 

```
sage -i http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/SimonKing/Cohomology/p_group_cohomology-1.0.spkg
```


## Purpose

Given any group of order `p^n` (where `p` is prime), compute the cohomology ring (in terms of minimal generators and relations and also providing various ring theoretic invariants) of the group with coeffients in the finite field of order `p`. Of course, induced homomorphisms can be computed as well.

## Documentation

An extensive documentation can be found at [http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/SimonKing/Cohomology/](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/SimonKing/Cohomology/).

## Features

The package includes the cohomology rings of all groups of order 64. These are actually quite challenging for other software (e.g., the Hap package for Gap, or the Magma programs of Jon F. Carlson with which these cohomology rings were first computed).

On sage.math, there are the cohomology rings for all groups of order 128, and the package can download them. **Sage is the only CAS that can currently provide such data.** Similarly, the cohomology of the groups of order 243 is available, but six of them are still not completely computed yet.

## Sources

The comprises
- a modified old version of the Aachen C-MeatAxe, 
- C-routines and Gap functions of David J. Green for the computation of minimal projective resolutions, and
- various Cython extension modules and Singular functions written by myself, computing the structure of the cohomology ring according to algorithms of Dave Benson and David J. Green. 
- Data for the cohomology of all groups of order 64.

The C-MeatAxe is considerably modified, the rest of the sources has never been published yet. Therefore we included all of the sources into the Mercurial repository.

## Dependencies

It is required that the SmallGroups library is installed.

Since I too often had to work around bugs in the non-commutative part of Singular 3-0-4, it is required that Singular 3-1-0 is available when dealing with a finite p-Group and p>2.

## Testing

I am afraid that there is no separate test suite for the C-sources. The package includes two scripts `spkg-check` and `spkg-check-details`, that both walk through all doc tests. `spkg-check-details` is slower, but in case of errors provides more direct pointers to the failing tests than `spkg-check`. The scripts also verify the presence of doc test in any method.

Note that some tests require internet connection, as data will be downloaded.

## Known issues

- It is not clear to me how one properly works with Licences. I did my very best. But could please some more experienced person check whether everything is alright with the licence?

- A couple of months ago, I tried to build an earlier version of the package on OS X. It failed, which was very likely due to C-MeatAxe, which in fact does not seem to support OS X (even in the most recent version). But this was without distutils. Perhaps someone can test it, as I do not have access to OS X.

- By the way of saving matrices in the MeatAxe format, it is very likely that the porting between big and little endian machines will be impossible. In particular, it could turn out to be impossible to use the data bases with a motorola processor.

Some comments: Seems to be installing okay (amd 64 ubuntu 9.04).

Before installing database_gap*.spkg I got an error reading something like "cannot access database_gap" or something. Does it actually require that spkg or merely smallgroup in gap*/pkg?

Waht is the license of the version of Meataxe you are using?

Looks like a *great* contribution Simon!

}
```

William suggested at sage-devel that I should tell precisely how I think the package should be tested, addressing the following areas:

### What hardware/OS combos should it be tried to install

So far, I successfully installed the package on Intel Pentium M, two processor types of AMD (Opteron and another one that I can't remember), and Sun X4450 (sage.math). The OS was SuSE Linux on the three machines that I had in Jena.

So, there are plenty of architectures which aren't tested, yet. As I indicated, I expect that OS X and Motorola processors are most challenging. But I leave it up to you, since so far I did not do extensive porting.

### What commands should be tested, and what should happen?

__A) The test script__ 

There is `spkg-check`, which should of course work without errors. Note that the script needs to be executed in a Sage shell. Note that some tests assume that Singular is present in version 3-1-0, and that there is internet connection. If you get an error of Singular mentioning the timer, this is most likely related with ticket #6412, so please apply the patch...

__B) Groups of order 64 (should be less than 1 hour)__

One of my favourite benchmarks are the groups of order 64. You can compute the cohomology rings as follows.

```
sage: from pGroupCohomology import CohomologyRing
sage: tmp_root = tmp_filename() # chosing a temporary location, or choose a permanent if you like
sage: CohomologyRing.set_user_db(tmp_root) # For each test, you should choose a different location,
                                           # since otherwise data would be reloaded from previous computations.
sage: for i in range(1,268):
...:      H = CohomologyRing.user_db(64,i,websource=False) # avoid that the complete ring gets downloaded
...:      H.make() # compute the ring structure
...:      print H == CohomologyRing(64,i) # this compares H with the pre-computed ring in the 'public' data base 
                                          # that is shipped with the package
```


- The answer should be `True` in all cases. 
- It might also be interesting how long the computation takes.
- The doc string of `CohomologyRing` mentions various options -- try them out!

__C) Non-abelian case (p!=2)__

If you have a new Sage version, with Singular 3-1-0, you may also try whether the computation for all groups of order 81 works without error. Note, however, that these rings are not included in the package, hence it makes no sense to test `CohomologyRing.user_db(81,i)` against `CohomologyRing(81,i)`

__D) 1. Groups given in the Gap interface__

Construct any finite p-Group G (if you only have Singular 3-0-4, p must be 2) in the Gap interface. Try to compute the cohomology ring using `H=CohomologyRing.user_db(G,GroupName='NameOfYourGroup', options='prot')`, followed by `H.make()`. The protocol output might give you a feeling of what happens inside, or, should an error occur, might point to the source of trouble.

Note that *an initial segment of the generator sequence of G must be a minimal generating  set*. Otherwise, the package would complain.

__D) 2. Induced homomorphisms__

If you have two groups G1, G2 matching the condition on the generating sets, with H1,H2 the respective cohomology rings,  construct a homomorphism G1 -> G2, and try to compute the induced map. See the documentation of H1.hom about how it works.

In particular, take an __auto__morphism `phi:G1 -> G1`. Compute the induced map `phi_star=H1.hom(phi,H1)`. Try `phi_star^(-1)`, `phi_star^3`, apply phi_star to elements of the cohomology ring, etc.

__E) Test various methods__

If you don't have Singular 3-1-0, choose a different group:

```
sage: from pGroupCohomology import CohomologyRing
sage: ROOT = '/home/SimonKing/CTest'  # choose your own root folder, you need write permissions
sage: CohomologyRing.set_user_db(ROOT)
sage: H = CohomologyRing.user_db(27,3, options='prot', websource=False)
#... some protocol output
sage: H.make()
#... tons of protocol output
sage: H.nil_radical()
#... some protocol output
a_1_0,
a_1_1,
a_3_4,
a_3_5,
b_2_0*b_2_3-b_2_0*b_2_1,
b_2_1^2-b_2_0*b_2_2-b_2_0*b_2_1,
b_2_1*b_2_2+b_2_0*b_2_2,
b_2_1*b_2_3-b_2_0*b_2_2-b_2_0*b_2_1,
b_2_2^2+b_2_0*b_2_2,
b_2_2*b_2_3+b_2_0*b_2_2
```



### RTFM

There is extensive documentation at [http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/SimonKing/Cohomology/](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/SimonKing/Cohomology/). Please read some chapters and see whether you find it clearly explained and whether it teaches you how to use the package. If not, please tell me!

I believe the package (should it be possible to install on your system) is already useful. But certainly there are many more things that one might want to know about cohomology rings: More ring theoretic invariants, for example. Please tell me what functionality you are missing, so that later versions of the package might implement it.

Perhaps this formulation is not clear enough: The above commands *must* work, otherwise the cohomology package can not even start with the computation.

It seems to me that you using a completely different way of representing the cohomology rings. Is that correct? If not, is there a simple example using your package that can also be used with CRIME to compare their outputs?\nFor example, the dihedral group of order 8. It seems that CRIME wants to truncate the ring at a given degree and you don't (but maybe I'm wrong here?), so I don't see how to easily compare them.\n\nBTW, I am testing the innstallation on an older amd64 ubuntu 8.10 machine.

Thanks. 

In that case, I think it should be made clear in the installation docs that to install the package you need to have run sage -i database_gap*.

I'm trying to see how this compares with GAP's CRIME package. It seems to me that you using a completely different way of representing the cohomology rings. Is that correct? If not, is there a simple example using your package that can also be used with CRIME to compare their outputs?
For example, the dihedral group of order 8. It seems that CRIME wants to truncate the ring at a given degree and you don't (but maybe I'm wrong here?), so I don't see how to easily compare them.

BTW, I am testing the innstallation on an older amd64 ubuntu 8.10 machine. Seems to be going okay there too.

What do you mean by "installation docs"? [http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/SimonKing/Cohomology/#installation](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/SimonKing/Cohomology/#installation) ? Yes, you are right. I will add a few words later today.

I must admit that I was not aware of CRIME, although Marcus Bishop currently is in Galway (so am I, since very recently). I only knew HAP (from Galway, too), that can also compute cohomology.

Looking at the CRIME manual, I think it compares with our package as follows:

- We work with coefficients GF(p); CRIME allows more general modules.
- Apparently, when doing `C:=CohomologyObject( G )` in CRIME, you get a not-yet-completed cohomology ring; this is similar to `H=CohomologyRing(G)` or `H=CohomologyRing(q,m)`, if G or SmallGroup(q,m) are not yet in our data base.
- Both CRIME and our package rely on the construction of minimal projective resolutions. We use David Green's GrÃ¶bner basis approach, while probably CRIME uses linear algebra.
- Indeed, CRIME works with truncated rings. For example, `CohomologyGenerators( C, n )` computes the ring out to degree `n` and returns the generators that it found. With our package, one could do the same, doing `H.make(n); H.gens()`. Our `H.make(n)` is similar to `CohomologyRing(G,n)`.
- `CohomologyGenerators( C, n )` only yields the *degrees* of the generators. `H.gens()` yields the generators themselves, and you can actually do computations with them. Actually, from the documentation, I get the impression that CRIME does provide (truncated) Cohomology Rings, but it does not provide *elements* of Cohomology Rings.
- The most important difference: Apparently CRIME has no completeness criterion. Section 2.4 states: "A test or series of tests for completion of the calculation will hopefully be implemented soon. See [CTVZ03] for the details." So, there is no analogue for our `H.make()`.

Also my impression is that we provide more things to do with a cohomology ring:

We implemented the computation of some ring theoretic invariants: Depth, PoincarÃ© series, a-invariants. Also we are able to compute the nil radical. For these operations, we make extensive use of the fact that we have a cohomology ring: We use Benson's completeness criterion, which involves the computation of a filter regular system  of parameters. These parameters allow for an easy computation of depth and Poincare series, and with a slightly extended machinery we also get the a-invariants. The nil radical is obtained by studying the restrictions to the maximal elementary abelian subgroups (which we do anyway when we choose our generators!).

My impression from the CRIME doc is that the computation would be much more clumsy: 
* Compute the ring structure C (Problem 1: There is no completeness criterion)
* Create a quotient of a polynomial ring P/I that has this ring structure. 
* Problem 2: On the way you loose the information that C was a cohomology ring. Now you just have an abstract ring presentation P/I, and then the computation of the nil radical or the Poincare series becomes much harder.

Back to your question:
> I'm trying to see how this compares with GAP's CRIME package. It seems to me that you using a completely different way of representing the cohomology rings. Is that correct? If not, is there a simple example using your package that can also be used with CRIME to compare their outputs?

Note that our favourite example (cohomology of the Dihedral Group of order 8) also appears in the CRIME documentation. Of course, we get essentially the same result -- but we can prove that our result is complete and not just a truncated version of the cohomology ring.

What you could always do: Make a complete computation with our package, and use it to get the right truncation degree for CRIME, hence:

```
sage: G = your favourit p-group
sage: H = CohomologyRing.user_db(G)
sage: H.make()
sage: n=H.knownDeg
```


The last line means that n tells in what degree we drove our computation before realising that it was complete. So, you could now use CRIME:

``` 
C := CohomologyRing(G,n);
```

and get the ring structure. 

Then you can compare with our result. Of course, in general the relations will look different. But: The number of generators sorted by degree and the number of relations sorted by degree should be the same with CRIME and our package. And, if you are able to compute the PoincarÃ© series with CRIME, again the result should be the same.

Actually this is how we compared our computational findings with the results of Jon F. Carlson.

Since people don't know the purpose of the `make` method, a little elaboration.

There are two ways of usage:
- `H.make(n)`: Compute at most out to degree `n`. This corresponds to the capabilities of CRIME.
- `H.make()`: Compute in increasing degree, until (our improved version of) Benson's criterion tells us that we can stop. This can't be done in CRIME, but HAP has a completeness criterion.

----

Perhaps it is better to compare HAP (or actually HAPprime), rather than CRIME, with our package.

HAPprime [http://www.gap-system.org/~gap/Manuals/pkg/happrime-0.3.2/doc/userguide/manual.pdf](http://www.gap-system.org/~gap/Manuals/pkg/happrime-0.3.2/doc/userguide/manual.pdf) uses a clever idea: Frst compute the Lyndon-Hoschild-Serre Spectral Sequence until convergence to ï¬nd the additive structure of the cohomology ring, and then compute the cohomology ring itself, based on projective resolutions, up to and including the maximum necessary generator or relation degree. 

The point is that this completeness criterion is perfect! However, an application of this criterion involves the computation of spectral sequences, which is perhaps not the easiest thing to do.

Here is a random collection of features, and how the three packages compare. Disclaimer: I am rather tired, so, perhaps I do mistakes. Sorry in advance.

 
__Complete computations:__ Possible with HAPprime and our package, impossible with CRIME.

__Induced homomorphisms:__ CRIME can do, we can do, but I didn't find it addressed in the HAPprime manual.

__Ring theoretic invariants:__ CRIME has nothing. HAPprime has PoincarÃ© series. We have PoincarÃ© series, depth, dimension, a-invariants, and can also compute the nil radical.

__Speed:__ I don't know about CRIME. I was told by Paul Smith that HAPprime needs a few days to compute the cohomology for the groups of order 64. We need less than 60 minutes.

1. Thanks for fixing the installation docs and the detailed comparison. That was very valuable for me anyway.

2. The comparision between crime and your package is a bit more complicated that it first seems I think. For example, we have


```

sage: from pGroupCohomology import CohomologyRing
sage: H = CohomologyRing.user_db(8,3,websource=False)
sage: print H

Cohomology ring of Dihedral group of order 8 with coefficients in GF(2)

Computed up to degree 2
Minimal list of generators:
[c_2_2, a 2-Cochain in H^*(D8; GF(2)),
 b_1_0, a 1-Cochain in H^*(D8; GF(2)),
 b_1_1, a 1-Cochain in H^*(D8; GF(2))]
Minimal list of algebraic relations:
[b_1_0*b_1_1]

sage: gap('LoadPackage("crime")')            
true 
sage: gap.eval("C:=CohomologyObject(DihedralGroup(8))")
'<object>'
sage: gap.eval("CohomologyGenerators(C,2)")
'[ 1, 1, 2 ]'
sage: gap.eval("CohomologyRelators(C,2)")
'[ [ z, y, x ], [ z*y+y^2 ] ]'
```

These seem different but I am not an expert. Is this difference easy to explain?

Is this difference easy to explain?\n\n\nThis problem is addressed in the package documentation in various places. \n\n__Explanation:__\n\nOf course, isomorphic rings can have different ring representations. In fact, when computing the cohomology with our package, the result depends on the given p-group *together with a choice of a minimal generating set*.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n\n```\nsage: from pGroupCohomology import CohomologyRing\nsage: tmp_root = tmp_filename()\nsage: CohomologyRing.set_user_db(tmp_root)\nsage: G1 = gap('DihedralGroup(8)')\nsage: G2 = gap('SmallGroup(8,3)')\nsage: H1 = CohomologyRing.user_db(G1, GroupName = 'Dihedral')\nsage: H1.make()\nsage: H2 = CohomologyRing.user_db(8,3)\nsage: H2.make()\nsage: H1.rels()\n['b_1_1^2+b_1_0*b_1_1']\nsage: H2.rels()\n['b_1_0*b_1_1']\n```\n\n\nHence, when we apply our algorithm to the dihedral group with generators given by DihedralGroup(8), we get a result as in CRIME. But using generators as provided by the SmallGroups library, the ring presentation is different.\n\nBy the method `group()`, one gets a permutation group that is guaranteed to yield the same presentation of the cohomology ring, and you see: These permutation groups are different, and mapping generators to generators would not provide an isomorphism of groups.\n\n```\nsage: H1.group()\nGroup( [ (1,5)(2,6)(3,8)(4,7), (1,3,2,4)(5,7,6,8) ] )\nsage: H2.group()\nGroup( [ (1,2)(3,8)(4,6)(5,7), (1,3)(2,5)(4,7)(6,8) ] )\n```\n\n\nHowever, the groups *are* isomorphic, so, we can construct an induced homomorphism of the cohomology rings:\n\n```\nsage: phi = G2.IsomorphismGroups(G1) # note that the resulting isomorphism is not unique\nsage: phi.SetName('\"phi\"')\nsage: phi_star = H1.hom(phi,H2)\nsage: phi_star\nphi^*\nsage: [H2.cochain_to_polynomial(phi_star(X)) for X in H1.gens()]\n\n[1, a 0-Cochain in H^*(D8; GF(2)),\n b_1_1^2+c_2_2, a 2-Cochain in H^*(D8; GF(2)),\n b_1_1+b_1_0, a 1-Cochain in H^*(D8; GF(2)),\n b_1_1, a 1-Cochain in H^*(D8; GF(2))]\n```\n\n\nSo, the induced homomorphism is not the identity. Just for fun, let us test whether the preimage of the relation of H2 is really zero in H1:\n\n\n```\nsage: print (phi_star^(-1))(H2('b_1_0')) * (phi_star^(-1))(H2('b_1_1'))\n2-Cochain in H^*(Dihedral; GF(2)),\nrepresented by\n[0 0 0]\n```\n\n \n> 3. Regarding the PoincareSeries in HAP: I think Graham Ellis told me that his PoincareSeries was likely to be true but not guaranteed. Is this right? If so, how sure are you of yours? (I checked in an example that they agree.)\n\nI don't know how reliable it is in HAP.\n\nConcerning reliability in our package: Note that there are two completely different methods for the computation of the Poincar\u00e9 series, namely `poincare_series()` and `poincare_without_parameters`. The second method uses a generic algorithm, but the first uses the parameters that are used in Benson's completeness criterion.\n\nSo, to test the reliability, you may compare the output of the two methods. \n\nNote that both methods do not rely on Hilbert function computations of Singular. The reason for an independent implementation was in fact that Singular is not reliable, it sometimes produces silent integer overflows.\n\n> 4. Regarding the license: \n> \n> (a) Can you ask any surviving Meataxe people if they might relicensing the version you used under GPLv2+?\n\nOnne may try. Perhaps the more recent versions are already GPLv2+.

This problem is addressed in the package documentation in various places. 

__Explanation:__

Of course, isomorphic rings can have different ring representations. In fact, when computing the cohomology with our package, the result depends on the given p-group *together with a choice of a minimal generating set*.

Here is an example:


```
sage: from pGroupCohomology import CohomologyRing
sage: tmp_root = tmp_filename()
sage: CohomologyRing.set_user_db(tmp_root)
sage: G1 = gap('DihedralGroup(8)')
sage: G2 = gap('SmallGroup(8,3)')
sage: H1 = CohomologyRing.user_db(G1, GroupName = 'Dihedral')
sage: H1.make()
sage: H2 = CohomologyRing.user_db(8,3)
sage: H2.make()
sage: H1.rels()
['b_1_1^2+b_1_0*b_1_1']
sage: H2.rels()
['b_1_0*b_1_1']
```


Hence, when we apply our algorithm to the dihedral group with generators given by DihedralGroup(8), we get a result as in CRIME. But using generators as provided by the SmallGroups library, the ring presentation is different.

By the method `group()`, one gets a permutation group that is guaranteed to yield the same presentation of the cohomology ring, and you see: These permutation groups are different, and mapping generators to generators would not provide an isomorphism of groups.

```
sage: H1.group()
Group( [ (1,5)(2,6)(3,8)(4,7), (1,3,2,4)(5,7,6,8) ] )
sage: H2.group()
Group( [ (1,2)(3,8)(4,6)(5,7), (1,3)(2,5)(4,7)(6,8) ] )
```


However, the groups *are* isomorphic, so, we can construct an induced homomorphism of the cohomology rings:

```
sage: phi = G2.IsomorphismGroups(G1) # note that the resulting isomorphism is not unique
sage: phi.SetName('"phi"')
sage: phi_star = H1.hom(phi,H2)
sage: phi_star
phi^*
sage: [H2.cochain_to_polynomial(phi_star(X)) for X in H1.gens()]

[1, a 0-Cochain in H^*(D8; GF(2)),
 b_1_1^2+c_2_2, a 2-Cochain in H^*(D8; GF(2)),
 b_1_1+b_1_0, a 1-Cochain in H^*(D8; GF(2)),
 b_1_1, a 1-Cochain in H^*(D8; GF(2))]
```


So, the induced homomorphism is not the identity. Just for fun, let us test whether the preimage of the relation of H2 is really zero in H1:


```
sage: print (phi_star^(-1))(H2('b_1_0')) * (phi_star^(-1))(H2('b_1_1'))
2-Cochain in H^*(Dihedral; GF(2)),
represented by
[0 0 0]
```

 
> 3. Regarding the PoincareSeries in HAP: I think Graham Ellis told me that his PoincareSeries was likely to be true but not guaranteed. Is this right? If so, how sure are you of yours? (I checked in an example that they agree.)

I don't know how reliable it is in HAP.

Concerning reliability in our package: Note that there are two completely different methods for the computation of the PoincarÃ© series, namely `poincare_series()` and `poincare_without_parameters`. The second method uses a generic algorithm, but the first uses the parameters that are used in Benson's completeness criterion.

So, to test the reliability, you may compare the output of the two methods. 

Note that both methods do not rely on Hilbert function computations of Singular. The reason for an independent implementation was in fact that Singular is not reliable, it sometimes produces silent integer overflows.

> 4. Regarding the license: 
> 
> (a) Can you ask any surviving Meataxe people if they might relicensing the version you used under GPLv2+?

Onne may try. Perhaps the more recent versions are already GPLv2+. However, we need the old version, or we need to re-implement David Green's code.

> (b) Since David Green is a co-author - he can license the code as he wants:-)

Well, but it would be wise to use a licence that meets the requirements of Sage.

> (c) Did you create the database "Data for the cohomology of all groups of order 64" yourself?

Well, the computer helped me a little...

The data base is not a relational data base (yet!), hence, no SQLAlchemy involved. It is just the result of the computations of our package, applying "tar -cz" to the result. Essentially, it is a courtesy, since a computation from scratch would yield that data base in just about 50 minutes.

> Do you know the distribution license for it? 

As I did it myself, I can probably choose. But I don't know how! Can you explain?

Cheers,
   Simon

Hi!

Before I go to the remote place, I can use the internet for a couple of hours.

I am kind of reluctant to accept the positive review, yet. Perhaps it should be "positive review pending"?

We have the following issues.

__Licence__

- As much as I understood, the MeatAxe Licence should be fixed. **Must** or **should**?
- You said that I should put my data base tar file under a certain licence. I assume this hods both for the stuff included with the package (groups of order 64) and in the internet (groups of order 128 and 243). But HOW can I put them under a licence?

__Porting__

Good news is that it works with Ubuntu. But did anybody try with OS X or on Motorola processors?

__Tests__

Did you run the test suite?

__More Features__

Thank you for pointing me to CRIME! It has implemented the Massey products. I think I would just need a day to implement it as well. But due to the expected shortcomings with internet in the near future, it might be a longer way.

So, what should I do when I have new features? Open a new ticket, with a version 1.1 of the spkg? Or (as long as the package did not become optional yet) stay on *this* ticket?

Best regards,
   Simon

That is fine but I don't see how any of the issues you raise below are important for the inclusion as an *optional* spkg, which is what this ticket is about.

Since Meataxe is GPLv2 and you compile against it, your package is GPLv2. I assume you are releasing your *code* under GPLv2+, but the package itself inherits what Meataxe is. So, **must** is only if you want your optional package to by GPLv2+. There are all kinds of licenses in the optional spkg's though.

Why not ad a COPYING or license.txt or README file to 
SAGE_ROOT/local/pGroupCohomology, asssuming that is where the 
DBs are? That's the obvious thing. 

BTW, if you type


```

Do you mean
sage: !/home/wdj/sagefiles/p_group_cohomology-1.0/spkg-check ?

In general, I have very little idea where in the SAGE tree different parts of the spkg get loaded.
In one of your earlier comments you mentioned this script but with no indication of where to find it. I had to separately tar xjvf the spkg and run that script since I couldn't find it in any "obvious" places in the Sage tree.

I got 


```
...
Writing doc strings to '/home/wdj/.sage//temp/hera/7169/RecDoctest.py' and running 'sage -t -long -verbose'...
All tests passed!
SUMMARY
-------
Some doc tests failed or where missing.
Please check '*_test.log', with * in ['cohomology']
Total time: 9.30 min
```

This gives no idea where `cohomology_test.log` is located but I found it. See
http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/wdj/patches/cohomology_test-amd64-ubuntu904.log
for the ubuntu test log and 
http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/wdj/patches/cohomology_test-mac0s10.4.11.log
for the intel macbook test log. In the ubuntu test log example_51 and example_7
had failures. I didn't understand the error but it seems to be a problem with Singular.
The macbook behaved better (only example_51 was listed as failing) but again the
problem was with Singular.

When version 1.1 is ready, open up a new ticket, describe the changes and post the new spkg. With new features, I guess you should have new doctests?


In any case, I think for an optional package, this is fine. If you want to call it "pending" and make more changes then that is fine too.

OK. I thought that this is the distinction between *optional* and *experimental*, the latter being not completely portable and also not completely reliable due to doc test errors.

What's wrong with it? In fact, this stuff is defined in ``__init__.py``. The reason is as follows:
- The user is supposed to construct things with the ring constructor.
- Hence, it should be easy to import.
- Hence, it should be on top level: `from pGroupCohomology import CohomologyRing` should be better than `from pGroupCohomology.cohomology import CohomologyRing`

Yes, and this is the usual place for a test suite, or at least this is what I got from the developers guide.

Sorry. Assuming that the location of the script was clear, when running it, it writes the log simply in the current work directory.

Some of them are. I don't know what happens, yet. I mean, ``def sage10456=COHO6r(1);`` resulting in an error in Singular. These things sometimes go away if the tests are performed in a different order. So, It really seems to me that they are due to Singular and not to the package. I suspect that the number of variable names in Singular is restricted. And 10456 is quite a lot. In fact, while developing the package, I tried to keep the number of autogenerated variable names small, but it doesn't help if you run hundreds of doc tests without restarting singular.

But something in the Ubuntu log irritates me: There is one example where a wrong ring structure is found. 
Currently I have no time to analyse it further. 

By the way, there also is a test suite spkg-check-details, that does the doc tests in a different way.

Well, I think the Massey product should go in, and I definitely want to see what happens with the doc tests.

So, I think it would hurt to keep it pending until my return end of July. Or are there different opinions?

Yes, the license of your package is still an issue. You can either (a) rewrite SPKG.txt to say it is GPLv2, or (b) ask any surviving Meataxe people you can find (maybe Alexander Hulpke or Thomas Breuer or other GAP people know who to contact?) if they will relicense or dual-licence it as GPLv2+ (at least the part of it that you use), then revise SPKG.txt after that.

It would be helpful to have a README or something which explains where what parts of your package go in what part of the Sage tree and what license they have.

I posted the shell history to

Hi!

It turned out that there is some internet access here, so, to some extent I can work.

David Green took care of it and asked in Aachen.

I  think nothing goes to the Sage tree, where I understand that "Sage tree" is everything inside SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/

But a README might indeed be helpful.

> Well, I'm used to seeing __init__.py as a file which users don't read which imports stuff from other modules that readers do read (__mymodule__.py is more private than mymodule.py). Also, it's not very descriptive. Still, it's up to you.

I see. You are right, I should put the code for CohomologyRing into a different file (say, cohomology_constructor.py), so that __init__.py only contains the import statement "from pGroupCohomology.cohomology_constructor import CohomologyRing". In that way, it is still possible for the user to do "from pGroupCohomology import CohomologyRing". OK, I will do so.

Good! Was it on Ubuntu? 

spkg-check-details does the same tests as spkg-check, but it does them one after the other. In particular, sage, singular and gap are re-started for each test. That might explain why the Singular error disappeared.

But I see that the last line says "some items have no doc test". I just realise that spkg-check-details should tell the user that (if there are errors or missing doc tests) the script produces a file "test.log" in the current directory that gives details for all doc test errors and that gives a list of all items without doc tests. Could you please post the test.log?

Things to do for me: 
- Replace spkg-check by spkg-check-details, since it avoids some trouble with Singular.
- There should be a pointer to test.log.

And then probably also including the Massey products!

Yes.

OK. Then the doc tests errors (including the very disturbing one, where the ring structure was wrong) seems to be due to Singular being overworked.

OK. So, the doc tests passed, and the missing doc tests mainly concern some inherited methods. 
The only "new" method without doc test is CohomologyHomset._repr_, which I will fix. The other missing doc tests concern classes, and I  understood that the *methods* suffice for having 100% doc test coverage.

There's news about licences:

Michael Ringe kindly agreed to provide mtx-2.2.3 with a new licence "GPL v2 or later", hence, he put a version mtx-2.2.4 on the download page, and as much as I see it differs from mtx-2.2.3 only by a new COPYING file.

So, I guess that in the documentation of our package I should replace all references to mtx-2.2.3 by a reference to mtx-2.2.4, and I should provide the new original sources in the folder 'mtxoriginal/' of our package.

My questions:
- Look at the folder 'src/mtx-2.2.3'. Does it suffice to rename that folder to 'src/mtx-2.2.4' and replace the old COPYING file by the new one?
- Specifically: Is it a problem that we use files showing cvs (or svn?) numbers that are different from those on the MeatAxe download page? For example, the *official*  'zzz.c' from the download page starts with

  So, my question is: Must these file headers match in order to conform with the licence? If this were the case, I had a lot of dull work to do...

You should change "#  Distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL)" to "#  Distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL), version 2 or later (at your choice)" or something like that.

If you don't specify the version of the GPL you use then it defaults to the latest version (which is version 3 currently). You don't want that.

I am about to produce a version 1.0.1, that will essentially be an attempt to fix the licence.

- I took the COPYING file from the MeatAxe 2.2.4 and put it on top of our modified MeatAxe version. Since the licence allows redistribution of the modified work, as long as the COPYING file isn't touched, this should be alright.
- The C-code of David Green got a similar COPYING file. So, this is GPL 2+ as well.
- Each of my files starts with a header, referring to the GPL, version 2 or later.
- I think it should be appropriate to put the data bases under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike licence. 

__Questions:__

- In order to put the data bases under the mentioned licence, does it suffice to state it in the documentation, as I now did in http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/SimonKing/Cohomology/#licence ?  You suggested to put a 'LICENSE.txt' into the package; but the major part of the data base is not included in the package, but only available in the internet. So, I thought that the package documentation is the right place for stating the licence. Is this OK? Or perhaps I should add some words concerning the data bases in the file 'SPKG.txt', that has a licence section anyway?
- It is also stated that the documentation itself is under CC Attribution-Share Alike. But: The documentation is mainly auto-generated using the source code of our package, which means that the documentation is derived work from something that is under GPL 2+. So, is it legal to use another licence for the documentation, or am I shooting myself in the foot?

Once theses questions are addressed, I will put a version 1.0.1 of our package online, so that hopefully the last reviewing steps can be done.

Best regards,
   Simon

I'm not crazy about putting the database license statement in the docs or in SPKG.txt, though it
is fine to mention them there. I prefer a separate file, say in the same directory or tarball
the database is stored in. I don't think it's important enough to argue about.

The code snippets are (I presume) yours and you can relicense or dual license it as you wish.


BTW, I think "licence" should be "license".

Hi David!

OK. 

I think it is more likely that people read the docs than manually enter http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/SimonKing/Cohomology/db/ where the main part of the data base currently sits. So, it seems logical to me to point out the licence in the docs rather than in the directory.

> The code snippets are (I presume) yours and you can relicense or dual license it as you wish.

All Python and Cython code, including the documentation, is 100% written by myself.

> BTW, I think "licence" should be "license".

You know, David Green is from England, and he told me that he wants to *licenSe* our package under a certain *licenCe*... :-)

Usually I try to use British English. Only when I directly refer to the "GNU Public License", I spell it the US way -- since I think of it as the *name* of the licence.

Cheers,
   Simon

I created a new version 1.0.1 of our package. You can install and test it by

```
sage -i http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/SimonKing/Cohomology/p_group_cohomology-1.0.1
```


I did not open a new ticket for the new package version, since the changes mainly concern the points that were discussed here: Licenc/se...

- The (modified) MeatAxe version in our package is now GPL2+. Many thanks to Michael Ringe for making this happen!
- As I point out in the file SPKG.txt (that you find after opening the package with "tar -xj"), the licence of the package is GPL2+, while the data base and the documentation are CC By-SA.
- The licence is also stated in the package's documentation, namely at http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/SimonKing/Cohomology/#licence
- When the package gets installed, a file LICENCE is copied into the folder containing the data base (SAGE_ROOT/local/pGroupCohomology/db/), and a similar file is also at http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/SimonKing/Cohomology/db/

Now you certainly think I am paranoid.

Apart from that, I did the following changes:

- There is a new method for cochains, returning the right multiplication by that cochain as a map of cohomology rings. So, this is a map that is not of degree zero and couldn't be dealt with before. There are new doc tests for composition of those maps.
- The test suite "spkg-check" (in the standard location, i.e. after opening the package with "tar -xj") now does the tests one at a time, so that Singular will not be overworked. The new test suite "spkg-check-quickly" is quicker, but may result in the Singular errors that David found on some machines. Both test suites have to be executed in a Sage shell.
- The Massey products are not included yet, I need a lot more time for them.

I ask the reviewer(s) to do the following:

- Install the new package version, including platforms such as OS X (I am really happy and surprised that it worked with the first version!!)
- Run the test suite(s)
- Do some reading in the documentation http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/SimonKing/Cohomology/ and see if you find it useful

Should a positive review result: Must I start a voting on sage-devel before it can become an optional package?

Best regards
   Simon

Yes, after thinking it over, my impression was that the old solution was better: Loading the package would still require some initialisation - no matter whether it is done in __init__.py or somewhere else.

As stated in SPKG.txt (the usual place where those informations are provided), the package contains the original meataxe sources of the version 2.2.4 (folder "mtxoriginal"), including the COPYING file, that I also provide in our modified meataxe version (folder "src/mtx2.2.4").

I think it is very clear. There is "mtxoriginal/", providing the original source of a third party package. There is "src/", which contains all code that is used in the package. The package is based on three components: Meataxe (c-code, in "mtx2.2.4/"), some executables written in C for computing some basic data ("present/"), and the Cython modules (in "pGroupCohomology/"), together with some c-files the cython code is linked with ("pGroupCohomology/c_sources/").

> I cannot find a guide in the docs as to how the unpacking is done, so one can find the source and read it if one desired details on the algorithms implemented. 

Of course it is not covered in the docs of the package, because unpacking an spkg is something that a user usually doesn't. And a user who *does* unpack it for reading the code is usually aware of the fact that any spkg can be opened with "tar -xjf"; this is pointed out in the Sage developer's guide.

> (For example, why not just put everything in python2.6/site-packages?)

I don't understand the question. Of course, neither Cython code nor c-code is supposed to be in python2.6/site-packages! Nor are the executables of meataxe and the additional executables from "present/". And the compiled extension modules *are*, of course, in python2.6/site-packages. 

> 4. I cannot find the test files spkg-check in the sage tree. Or do you expact people who want to run tests to download your package and unpack it separately (as I did before)?

Just read the relevant chapter in the developer's guide, [http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/producing_spkgs.html](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/producing_spkgs.html).

spkg-check is not supposed to be in the Sage tree. 

Read also a thread on sage-devel, where I raised some related questions, at [http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/5e286c6ec0d90879/40e55782bbb0e144?lnk=gst&q=spkg-check#40e55782bbb0e144](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/5e286c6ec0d90879/40e55782bbb0e144?lnk=gst&q=spkg-check#40e55782bbb0e144).

I don't see what you mean. The sources of an spkg are not supposed to be in the sage tree. Executables built by an spkg are supposed to be in SAGE_ROOT/local/bin, extension modules in SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/python2.6/site-packages/, and local data (e.g., data bases) in a subfolder of SAGE_ROOT/local, whose name is given by the name of the extension module (here: pGroupCohomology). And of course, when you install the package, then you get a copy of the (unpacked) spkg in SAGE_ROOT/spkg/optional/.

So, I don't think that I make anything different from any other spkg in that regard.

Best regards,
   Simon

It should not be p_* but pG*:
There is a difference between the name of the spkg (p_group_cohomology-1.0.1) and the name of the extension module it provides (pGroupCohomology, and this is also how the folder in site-packages is called). Compare this with another optional spkg: The spkg is called pil-1.1.6, but the module is PIL.

Nevertheless, if it can't be imported then it's bad. Is there any informative error message if you start a sage session and try manually

```

that tells at what point the problem occurs?

There is the possibility that it "simply works" when you try the installation a second time. If not: You might remove SAGE_ROOT/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/pGroupCohomoloy* and try again (this is to avoid conflict with previous builds).

Unfortunately I have no access to Macbooks, so, I can't try myself.

Strange indeed. As I mentioned, on one of my machines I had to try installation a second time. In this case, I think the problem was that the installation took more than 50% of the memory, but the machine was busy with differnt things, so it failed.

As much as I know, sage -f of course does a re-installation. But *if* SAGE_ROOT/spkg/optional/ contains a file xyz.spkg then it will use this file for re-installation; it will not attempt to download a new copy of that file.

> Any more testing to be done? Or is the package ready to be moved from "need review" to "positive review"?

On the bright side: It passes testing on various platforms, including some for which this is a good surprise. In addition, using the package I did a lot of computations that went smoothly, reproduce known results, but go much beyond the previously known.

So, from this point of view, I think it is OK to move it to "positive review" (but I think *you* should do, because you are the reviewer, and don't forget to insert your name in the "Reviewer" field).

On the dark side: Apparently nobody here has access to a computer with Motorola chips. Martin Albrecht said it is extremely likely that our package will not work on Motorola. 

I am about to write an email to William with you as Cc, and ask whether he can provide testing on Motorola, and if not, whether it is crucial for an optional package being tested on it.

sage: from pGroupCohomology import CohomologyRing
sage: tmp_root = tmp_filename()
sage: CohomologyRing.set_user_db(tmp_root)
sage: for i in range(1,268):
....:     H = CohomologyRing.user_db(64,i, websource=False) # Compute the ring from scratch
....:     H.make()
....:     K = CohomologyRing(64,i)  # Compare with the ring in the data base
....:     if H is K:
....:         raise RuntimeError, "H is K" # 'public' and 'private' data base are different...
....:     if H!=K:
....:         raise RuntimeError, "H != K" # ... but they contain the same data.
```


The above used to run in about 45 minutes. But now, the computation time and the memory consumption increased dramatically. Currently I try to find out whether the problem is the change from sage-4.0 to sage-4.1 or the change from p_group_cohomology-1.0 to  p_group_cohomology-1.0.1; probably it is the latter. 

So: Until I solved the problem (famous last words...) I give it the tag "needs work".

I did an update of my package. You can install it by

```
sage -f http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/SimonKing/Cohomology/p_group_cohomology-1.0.2.spkg
```

or without the http stuff as soon as William has moved it into the repository of experimental spkgs.

I am not sure if it is reasonable to have yet another version number (1.0.2 instead of 1.0.1). Opinions?

Here are my comments and questions on the new version:

* In this version, I finally use _sig_on/_sig_off. Hence, you should be able to keyboard interrupt a lengthy computation of a projective resolution (which was impossible before). Question:
  * I know that _sig_on and _sig_off must come in pairs. So, if a method has _sig_on, then _sig_off should be used before return. But is it also required to have _sig_off before leaving the method by raising an error?

* As usual, you can run the test suite if before installation you do `export SAGE_CHECK=1`.

* Install and test is fine on 
  * AMD Athlon(tm) 64 Processor 3700+, GNU Linux openSUSE 10.2 (X86-64), gcc version 4.2.1, sage 4.0.2
  * Intel(R) Core(TM)2 CPU, GNU Linux openSUSE 11.0, gcc version 4.3.1, sage 4.1

 Please test on as many platforms as possible!

* In addition to the test suite, I did the following test, that revealed a time regression that is now fixed:
  {{{
sage: from pGroupCohomology import CohomologyRing
sage: tmp_root = tmp_filename()
sage: CohomologyRing.set_user_db(tmp_root)
sage: for i in range(1,268):  # testing the performance
....:     H = CohomologyRing.user_db(64,i,options='nosave',websource=False)
....:     H.make()
....:     save(H, H.autosave_name())
sage: for i in range(1,268): # unit tests
....:     H = CohomologyRing.user_db(64,i)
....:     if not H.completed:
....:         raise RuntimeError,"Forgot to save!"
....:     K = CohomologyRing(64,i)
....:     if H is K:
....:         raise RuntimeError, "H is K"
....:     if H!=K:
....:         raise RuntimeError, "H!=K"
   }}}
* On the AMD Athlon, the above performance test takes roughly 25 CPU minutes or 45 "real" minutes.

* On the Intel Core 2, it is only about 19 CPU minutes or 37 "real" minutes. As far as I know, this is a new **world record** for the cohomology computation of the groups of order 64.

**__News and Changes__**

* Fixing a severe time regression
* Fixing some error that William revealed by the doc tests on PPC Macbook
* Fixing a minor memory leak
* Using _sig_on/_sig_off
* My Email address has changed, and I provide the new address in the package.

If no objections arise from the version number and _sig_off questions, then I think it is ready for review!

Thank you very much!

By the way, I meanwhile learned that it is not needed to start spkg-check manually. Probably the easiest way to test the package is to do
`export SAGE_CHECK=1` before installing the package, since spkg-check will then be started automatically.

So, according to reports of David Joyner, William Stein and myself, we currently have install tests pass on
- Amd64, Ubuntu 9.0.4 
- AMD Athlon 64 3700+, openSUSE 10.2 
- Dual Core AMD Opteron 270, openSUSE 10.2
- Intel Core Duo, openSUSE 11.0 
- Intel X7460, Ubuntu 8.04.2 (this is sage.math)
- PowerPC, OS X 10.4
and I understood that William is currently doing further tests.

The previous version used to work on your Macbook, you said. Does the new version as well?

Has anybody tried it under Windows (I mean, via a virtual machine) yet? I have no Windows machine handy.

I expected far more installation problems. The portability is, I guess, mainly due to distutils. So, kudos to whoever developed distutils!

Too bad! I hope that at least you are safe!

Well, if it passed spkg-check (showing the bottom line "All tests passed!"), then the work is done, and a retest wouldn't be needed. `sage -testall` would test all of Sage,  not just our package.
