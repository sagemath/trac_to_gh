Thank you.
NB: Currently giacpy is just an optional spkg not a sage library so there is no sage.lib.giac

I don't know if there is a suitable place on sage git to expand  the so called upstream spkg, I would be happy to put it in public so that sage developper could also modify it.

I cleaned it up a bit more. It still needs tests, documentation and a way to shut Giac up. Also, does Giac have an option to print a protocol of the GB computation (most systems do).

Finally, we get this doctest failure:


```
File "src/sage/libs/giac.py", line 19, in sage.libs.giac
Failed example:
    sig_on_count()
Expected:
    0
Got:
    1
```

Replying to [comment:14 frederichan]:
> The sig_count pb is from giacpy 0.4.8 Pygen `__iter__`, it could/should? be fixed in a separate trac?

yes, this should be a separate ticket but this ticket IMHO should depend on that ticket. That is, this ticket should wait until the fix is in.

> we can avoid it with: 
> ` return PolynomialSequence(P, tuple(gb_giac), immutable=True)`
> instead of just gb_giac. I remark time loss with tuple, should we adopt this?

You mean instead of `PolynomialSequence(gb_giac, P, immutable=True)`? I don't think we should work around a bug which should be fixed instead.


> is there a way to substitute efficiently variables in PolynomialRing (ex: 'i' will give use troubles in giac) if not I will just add some protection with an error message

You can try but it's not very fast:


```python
sage: P.<a,b,c,i> = QQ[]
sage: R.<x,y,z,w> = QQ[]
sage: f = P.random_element()
sage: R(f)
-2*y^2 - 1/4*y*z + 6*z*w - 2*z - 59/5
sage: %timeit R(f)
10000 loops, best of 3: 77.3 ¬µs per loop
```


Maybe check `P.gens_dict().keys()` for problematic names and only switch over if there is a problem?

Dear martin, thank you for the modifs.
About the doctests I don't trust even the first 2 characters: `//` of the message `// Giac ...`
I have not yet tested this giac spkg  1.2.0-19 on os X to see but last time I got pbs with the begining of this message on OSX versus linux. so I think that in a doctest it is safer to do it in 2 steps:
`sage: gb = J.groebner_basis('giac') # optional - giacpy, random`
`sage: gb # optional - giacpy`
