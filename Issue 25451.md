On 32-bit:

```
File "src/sage/functions/hypergeometric.py", line 148, in sage.functions.hypergeometric
Failed example:
    hypergeometric_U(2, 2, x).series(x == 3, 100).subs(x=1).n()
Expected:
    0.403652637676806
Got:
    0.403651580752398
```


Pynac is not involved in the numerics (`hypergeometric_U` is not a `GinacFunction`), so the hypothesis is that the expression before `.n()` is different with 32bit Linux pynac-0.7.22.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25688

This bug is fixed by the pynac patch in #31585. (So the inaccuracy in the sum is due to an arithmetic overflow.) 

There is only new commit in the branch here. It just deletes the "known bug" tag from the doctest in src/sage/functions/hypergeometric.py that is in the description of this ticket.
