On 32-bit:

```
File "src/sage/functions/hypergeometric.py", line 148, in sage.functions.hypergeometric
Failed example:
    hypergeometric_U(2, 2, x).series(x == 3, 100).subs(x=1).n()
Expected:
    0.403652637676806
Got:
    0.403651580752398
```


Pynac is not involved in the numerics (`hypergeometric_U` is not a `GinacFunction`), so the hypothesis is that the expression before `.n()` is different with 32bit Linux pynac-0.7.22.

This bug is fixed by the pynac patch in #31585. (So the inaccuracy in the sum is due to an arithmetic overflow.) 

There is only new commit in the branch here. It just deletes the "known bug" tag from the doctest in src/sage/functions/hypergeometric.py that is in the description of this ticket.

Changing keywords from "" to "pynac, 32-bit, overflow".

Rebased on the new #31585 that eliminates a merge conflict.

Thanks for pointing out the merge conflict -- I hadn't noticed. I rebased on 9.4b6 (and deleted the dependency on #31585, which has already been merged).

Stalled in `needs_review` or `needs_info`; likely won't make it into Sage 9.5.

Changing status from needs_review to positive_review.
