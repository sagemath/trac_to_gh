Keywords: UFD

Right now, there is no `Zmod(k).is_unique_factorization_domain()` method, while one can test these rings for being field, integral domain, ... 

The code is actually the same as for methods `Zmod(k).is_field()` of `Zmod(k).is_integral_domain()` since it consists simply in testing whether `k` is prime.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17501

Since this checks for the prime, which is the same test for `is_field`, IMO we should just call `is_field` (and do the category refinement too).

Seems reasonable indeed. I do not understand the "category refinement" part of your comment!

`Zmod` is in the category of `Rings` by default because we don't want to do the prime check. However, if we do do the check, then we want `Zmod` to be in the category of `Fields` if applicable. You can see this by:

```
sage: R = Zmod(5)
sage: R.category()
Join of Category of finite commutative rings and Category of subquotients of monoids and Category of quotients of semigroups
sage: R.is_field()
True
sage: R.category()
Join of Category of finite fields and Category of subquotients of monoids and Category of quotients of semigroups
```

Moreover you get extra methods and/or shortcuts (like `lcm` on elements).

Do you mind making the change Bruno?

I looked into `sage.rings.finite_rings.integer_mod_ring.py` but was unable to find how the change of category occurs. In particular, I looked into the `is_field()` method but nothing seems to be done there.

It's this part of the `sage.rings.finite_rings.integer_mod_ring.is_field` method:

I've made the change. I also changed the default input to `proof=None` to reflect that of `is_field` (at the end of the day, I believe the `is_prime` uses a global flag of some kind to make the default choice). If you're happy with my changes, then you can set this to a positive review.
