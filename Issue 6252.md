I think this can be closed now. There's no need to apply the patch to the Sage source distro, nor to incorporate the XML file. This is for the Sage website, so only apply the patch to sagemath on boxen. I've applied the patch and updated the website. The updated page should be at



http://www.sagemath.org/development-map.html



where one can search for the names of the above new contributors.
