`Homset._generic_convert_map` uses `self._element_constructor`.

Ideally, we would get rid of `_generic_convert_map` completely.

I'm not sure about changing `__call__` to `_element_constructor_` here as it could cause a speed regression because of having to go through the coercion framework. Have you run any timings? Homsets often do not follow the usual rule of having a `Element` attribute, which may have misbehaviors because of that.

Also, because it would now pass through the coercion framework, some things are unnecessary, such as `if x.parent() is self:`. I'm also not sure how much the input may have changed by the time it reaches `_element_constructor_`. I can do some investigation.

**Trivial conversion**:

*Before*:

```
sage: H = End(FreeGroup('x,y')); f = H.identity(); timeit('H(f)', number=20, repeat=100000)
20 loops, best of 100000: 489 ns per loop

*After*:

```
sage: H = End(FreeGroup('x,y')); f = H.identity(); timeit('H(f)', number=20, repeat=100000)
20 loops, best of 100000: 95.4 ns per loop
```


**Non-trivial conversion**:

*Before*:

```
sage: H = End(FreeGroup('x,y')); f = lambda x:x; timeit('H(f)', number=20, repeat=10000)
20 loops, best of 10000: 2.55 µs per loop
```


*After*:

```
sage: H = End(FreeGroup('x,y')); f = lambda x:x; timeit('H(f)', number=20, repeat=10000)
20 loops, best of 10000: 3.4 µs per loop

Interestingly, I traced the speed difference of the "non-trivial conversion" above to the call

```
R = parent(x)
```


Apparently, asking for the parent of non-numeric types is very slow.

My timings.

Before

```
sage: H = End(FreeGroup('x,y')); f = H.identity(); timeit('H(f)', number=20, repeat=100000)
20 loops, best of 100000: 393 ns per loop
sage: H = End(FreeGroup('x,y')); f = lambda x:x; timeit('H(f)', number=20, repeat=10000)
20 loops, best of 10000: 1.85 µs per loop
```

Just #23905

```
sage: H = End(FreeGroup('x,y')); f = H.identity(); timeit('H(f)', number=20, repeat=100000)
20 loops, best of 100000: 47.7 ns per loop
sage: H = End(FreeGroup('x,y')); f = lambda x:x; timeit('H(f)', number=20, repeat=10000)
20 loops, best of 10000: 2.35 µs per loop
```

Both #23905 and #23912:

```
sage: H = End(FreeGroup('x,y')); f = H.identity(); timeit('H(f)', number=20, repeat=100000)
20 loops, best of 100000: 47.7 ns per loop
sage: H = End(FreeGroup('x,y')); f = lambda x:x; timeit('H(f)', number=20, repeat=10000)
20 loops, best of 10000: 1.65 µs per loop
```


So LGTM. I'm putting #23912 as a dependency just because I feel we should not merge this without #23912 to avoid the speed regression.
