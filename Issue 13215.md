On #715 and #12313 some variants of WeakKeyRef data structures are introduced, used in caching for, among other things, uniqueness of parents and coercions. In [#12313 comment 162](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/12313#comment:162) is some data on how these data structures can be improved.

Excellent work! Looks promising. I tested `IdKeyDict` against the revamped classes here with the same tests you posted there. The `MonoDict` wins of course:

```
sage: %timeit K in W
625 loops, best of 3: 38.1 µs per loop
sage: %timeit K in M
625 loops, best of 3: 112 ns per loop
sage: %timeit K in I
625 loops, best of 3: 160 ns per loop
sage: %timeit K2 in W
625 loops, best of 3: 680 ns per loop
sage: %timeit K2 in M
625 loops, best of 3: 64.1 ns per loop
sage: %timeit K2 in I
625 loops, best of 3: 104 ns per loop
sage: %timeit W[K]
625 loops, best of 3: 36.7 µs per loop
sage: %timeit M[K]
625 loops, best of 3: 99.2 ns per loop
sage: %timeit I[K]
625 loops, best of 3: 146 ns per loop
```

but already for the `TripleDict` it seems a reasonable choice:

```
sage: %timeit (K,K,True) in I
625 loops, best of 3: 392 ns per loop
sage: %timeit (K,K,True) in T
625 loops, best of 3: 451 ns per loop
sage: %timeit (K2,K,True) in I
625 loops, best of 3: 133 ns per loop
sage: %timeit (K2,K,True) in T
625 loops, best of 3: 541 ns per loop
sage: 
sage: %timeit I[K,K,True]
625 loops, best of 3: 366 ns per loop
sage: %timeit T[K,K,True]
625 loops, best of 3: 432 ns per loop
```

I don't think I'll even understand modern CPU's ... (that or  `TripleDict` can be further tuned. It was a first try. I think I did use some ideas that might be useful for you, though.

Anyway, at least the iteration needs some work (nice that cython generators now work!)

```
sage: from sage.structure.idkey_dict import IdKeyDict
sage: I = IdKeyDict(3,53, threshold=0.7)
sage: L = []
sage: for p in prime_range(10000):
....:         L.append(GF(p)['x','y'])
....: 
sage: for i,K in enumerate(L):
....:         I[K,K,True] = i
....: 
sage: from collections import Counter
sage: Counter([k in I for k,v in I.iteritems()])
Counter({False: 1229})
sage: Counter([(k,k,True) in I for k in L])
Counter({True: 1229})
sage: Counter([(k[3](),k[4](),k[5]) in I for k,v in I.iteritems()])
Counter({True: 1229})
```

but as you see, that's easily fixed. You just have to extract the actual keys. Doing it this way might report errors a bit better than with the unsafe casting of `k[:3]` (dead weakrefs etc.)

```
sage: Counter([(id(k[3]()),id(k[4]()),id(k[5])) == k[:3] for k,v in I.iteritems()])
Counter({True: 1229})
```

Pitfall, by the way:

```
sage: import weakref
sage: W=weakref.ref(ZZ)
sage: weakref.ref(W)
TypeError: cannot create weak reference to 'weakref' object
```

So:

```
sage: from sage.structure.idkey_dict import IdKeyDict
sage: import weakref
sage: class D(object): pass
....: 
sage: d = D()
sage: W = weakref.KeyedRef(d,None,None)
sage: I = IdKeyDict(1,53, threshold=0.7)
sage: I[W]= 10
sage: I[W]
10
sage: del d
sage: len(I)
1
sage: I[W]
KeyError: <weakref at 0x5f6c4d0; dead>
sage: len(I)
0
sage: W
<weakref at 0x5f6c4d0; dead>
```

Note that my key, `W` still exists! Also note that an `IdKeyDict` would accept mutable (unhashable) objects.
That might be a selling point beyond its "weak" and speed properties.

So we should document that one should not use `KeyedRef`s as key elements and probably forbid them. For key construction, after weakreffing has failed, doing a little `isinstance(k,KeyedRef)` shouldn't be so bad (that's not the code path we really care about anyway)

There is nothing *wrong* with `TripleDict`.

**EDIT:** It used to say *except for an eraser problem we don't know how to fix. We should solve that for now by forbidding the problematic keys in the documentation. In other words: "Don't use `TripleDict` unless you know what you're doing". Then `TripleDict` doesn't have any known bugs and we can take our time to think about how to make `TripleDict` more generally applicable.* here. There is no such problem as far as we know now though (required reading:
[Modules/gc_weakref.txt](http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/4b42d7f288c5/Modules/gc_weakref.txt))

Memory management, deallocation, and weakref callbacks are genuinely hard ...

Concerning the timing reported on [#12313:300](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/12313#comment:300), with the patch here we get

which is an improvement of 91 ns over the 331 ns reported there. Since a normal dictionary times 110 ns for this operation, and this patch avoids the internal use of another dictionary lookup in `_refcache`, it seems like the gain is indeed basically purely the removal of `_refcache`.

We now have

sage: def test():
....:            for n in xrange(10**7):
....:              _=QQ(x)
....: 
sage: sage: time test()
Time: CPU 7.92 s, Wall: 7.95 s
```

That is a bit of a gain over `Time: CPU 8.53 s, Wall: 8.57 s` we have without #13387, but still quite a bit worse than the `Time: CPU 2.97 s, Wall: 2.98 s` we have prior to #12313. The difference is that the dictionary that stores the conversion and coercion maps turned into a weakkeyref dict (`MonoDict`), which is necessarily slower in key lookup than a normal dict, because there's an extra indirection level in the keys.

Concerning Jeroen's original report, we now have (#12313 + #13387)

```
sage: def test(RR):
....:         for d in range(-20,0):
....:             if abs(RR(quadratic_L_function__numerical(1, d, 10000) - quadratic_L_function__exact(1, d))) > 0.001:
....:                 print "Oops!  We have a problem at d = ", d, "    exact = ", RR(quadratic_L_function__exact(1, d)), "    numerical = ", RR(quadratic_L_function__numerical(1, d))
....: 
sage: time test(RealField(50))
Time: CPU 1.81 s, Wall: 1.82 s
```

versus reference timing

```
Time: CPU 1.63 s, Wall: 1.64 s
```

To compare, on this machine, the same test with just #12313 takes

```
Time: CPU 2.07 s, Wall: 2.08 s
```

so the improvements here do significantly reduce the regression originally reported by Jeroen.

Incidentally, doing a `del` on a bucket slice is indeed safe: Python defers DECREF activity until the slice has been removed from the list. Also, since the slices we delete are not longer than 8 entries, the temporary references are kept on the stack (faster!).

So we shave a little more off (something like 30ns, i.e., some 15% on a simple MonoDict lookup)

It looks like this patch does indeed fix the `KeyError` I posted on #12313. At least, I can no longer reproduce the problem with this patch applied.

Ah yes! Good catch. This could very well be the source. The stored values here are `id`s of python objects. They are stored via a `<size_t><void *>` cast (which subsequently gets converted to a python int). When we try to retrieve that via a `PyInt_AsSsize_t` we're trying to retrieve it into a `signed` `size_t` (that's the purpose of the `Ssize_t`, right?), so indeed this might not fit.

What's the best fix, though? Should we be storing via a `<Py_ssize_t><void *>` cast or should we do a `<size_t><void *>PyList_GET_ITEM(...)` instead? I think I found `PyInt_AsSsize_t` by looking at the code generated by that statement.

It depends a bit: I would assume that python has relatively efficient storage for both small positive and negative integers, so storing as a signed quantity would make better use of the bits python offers for its "small" (as in not `PyLong`) integers.

Previously, the code prevented this whole issue by constructions such as

```
            tmp = <object>PyList_GET_ITEM(bucket, i)
            if <size_t>tmp == h1:
```

which of course works, but is less efficient: The cast to `<object>` will introduce refcounting.

So, my hunch is: store keys as `<Py_ssize_t>` and cast to `<size_t>` before doing modulo operations. I suppose that `<size_t><Py_ssize_t>(-1)` equals `256^(size_of(size_t))-1` (and probably doesn't generate code).

Advice welcome.

That is completely true, so going the Py_ssize_t way is probably the most efficient.

If N is of type Py_ssize_t, then <size_t>N % k isn't even slow, it should actually be at least as fast as N % k and certainly a lot faster than

```
h = N % k
if h < 0:

{
    "body": "Oh bother. Neither the iteration code nor the resize code is likely to be safe. The resize code does memory allocations throughout its inner loop, so callbacks (and bucket modifications!) can happen there. The loop is not robust against that in a rather fundamental way: If a callback happens on an entry that has already been copied over to the new buckets, but before the new buckets have been commissioned, then the entry will get removed from its old bucket (possibly causing mayhem), but the entry in the new bucket will happily remain!\n\nI'm not sure how to formulate resize otherwise. Should we trigger a garbage collection, to ensure all collectable entries have already been removed? If we start rearranging the buckets right after that, we shouldn't be getting any callbacks. Unless GC isn't always completely thorough. Can it ever be that a GC call issued right after another GC can still find something? Given how difficult it can be to break cycles, I can imagine this would happen. For instance, if a weakref callback causes something else to become garbage, will that still be collected in the same call?\n\nAnother approach might be to \"lock\" the dictionary so that callbacks get queued rather than executed.

Oh bother. Neither the iteration code nor the resize code is likely to be safe. The resize code does memory allocations throughout its inner loop, so callbacks (and bucket modifications!) can happen there. The loop is not robust against that in a rather fundamental way: If a callback happens on an entry that has already been copied over to the new buckets, but before the new buckets have been commissioned, then the entry will get removed from its old bucket (possibly causing mayhem), but the entry in the new bucket will happily remain!

I'm not sure how to formulate resize otherwise. Should we trigger a garbage collection, to ensure all collectable entries have already been removed? If we start rearranging the buckets right after that, we shouldn't be getting any callbacks. Unless GC isn't always completely thorough. Can it ever be that a GC call issued right after another GC can still find something? Given how difficult it can be to break cycles, I can imagine this would happen. For instance, if a weakref callback causes something else to become garbage, will that still be collected in the same call?

Another approach might be to "lock" the dictionary so that callbacks get queued rather than executed. When we unlock the dictionary we could process the queue (or purge the dict so that we're sure any outstanding callback has become irrelevant)

The iterator is less inherently unsafe. It's just that in between "yield"s there is likely allocation activity of some sort, so GCs could modify the dict.

In any case, I don't think the work on this ticket makes the situation worse than it already is, which apparently is not so bad: resize operations are very rare. It may well be they don't happen in the test suite at all.

Furthermore, the problem only arises if a new bucket needs to be *extended* during copying.

**Conclusion:** This ticket should still be merged because it's likely strictly an improvement over the status-quo, but there are some fundamental design problems due to an extremely remote possibility for unfortunate GC occurrences in the middle of dictionary update operations.

Some remarks about the comment (lines 48--62 of `sage/structure/coerce_dict.pyx`):

Nobody guarantees that `size_t` is a "pointer sized integer". In practice, the number of bits in a `size_t` does equal the bitness of the machine on modern systems, but there is no guarantee for this. In C99, there is a type `uintptr_t`, which is defined as being a pointer-sized unsigned integer. See also [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1464174/size-t-vs-intptr-t](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1464174/size-t-vs-intptr-t) for some good points.

The next sentence (This has an advantage...) could be made more concrete:
Assuming that Py_ssize_t is the same as a C long (which is true on most Unix-like systems),
this also has the advantage that these Py_ssize_t values are stored as a Python "int" (as opposed to "long"), which allow for fast conversion to/from C types.

Typo:

```
(<size_t) h)% modulus
```

There is something that comes close, though:
Python's `id` is implemented via `PyLong_FromVoidPtr`. This routine only compiles if `sizeof(void *) <= sizeof(long)` or if `sizeof(void *) <= sizeof(long long)` (if that type is available).

So CPython itself is taking reasonable but not extreme measures to support odd pointer sizes (I guess `sizeof(void *) !=sizeof(long)` is quite possible)

The definition is available:

```
cdef extern from "stdint.h":
    ctypedef long intptr_t #doesn't need to match exactly
```


In order to find conversion routines in Python that are guaranteed of the right length, we'd have to go with `PyLong_FromVoidPtr` and `PyLong_AsVoidPtr`. So basically we'd be working with `void *` and convert to `intptr_t` if we need to do arithmetic.

In fact, at that time we can afford to lose bits, so we wouldn't particularly need `intptr_t` as a type at all. We can just cast to `<long>` once we do arithmetic to compute the hash value or the bucket number.

So the question really is: Do we want to let our keys be `<void *>` rather than `Py_Ssize_t`?
We do need to pack and unpack those keys into the bucket `PyList` objects.

There is a slight problem there: `PyLong_FromVoidPtr` goes through extra trouble to interpret `void *` as an unsigned quantity (if only it didn't do that! what's wrong with a negative pointer?). Thus even on systems where a PyInt and a `void *` have the same number of bits available, half of the possible values will be stored in a `PyLong` anyway (because of sign). [Note that `PyLong_FromVoidPtr` is happy to produce a `PyInt` if it thinks it fits.

So yes, we could do that and guard against future platforms where `sizeof(void *) > sizeof(size_t)`, but we'd do so at a storage and performance penalty on our platforms now.
(probably very rare on 64bit, because pointer tend to have their top bits zero there, but on 32-bit it's very common to have pointers with their top bit set)

I'm not sure it's worth it.

> What is the startup_modules script complaining about?

It's complaining that there seems to be a new module now, `sage.structures.gc`. I don't know why that's a bad thing. It's a direct consequence of the statement `import gc` that I added, which I need because I need to do `gc.enable()` and `gc.disable()`. This is in a routine that should rarely execute and has an expensive inner loop that doesn't contain these statements, so I don't think the python method calls are going to make a difference. Furthermore, I wasn't able to find a C-level interface to this functionality. I've checked the source of the `GC` module and the underlying C routines are explicitly declared `static`, so our only access seems to be via method lookup.

If someone has a recommended way of accessing this functionality without importing gc, that's fine with me. Moving the `import gc` statement into runtime, say one of the __init__ methods is a bad idea: Several of these dictionaries get instantiated every time a parent's coercion framework is initialized (which can be pretty often), but a documented C-level API for turning gc on and off would be fine.
