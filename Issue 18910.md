Keywords: differentiable manifold, affine connection, curvature, torsion

This ticket implements affine connections on infinitely differentiable manifolds (i.e. smooth manifolds) . This is a follow-up of #19092 within the [SageManifolds project](http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/) (see the metaticket #18528 for an overview). As in #19092, the non-discrete topological field K over which the smooth manifold is defined is generic, although in most applications, K=**R** or K=**C**.

Affine connections are implemented via the Python class `AffineConnection`, the user interface being the method `DiffManifold.affine_connection()`. At the user choice, CPU-demanding computations (like that of the Riemann curvature tensor) can be parallelized, thanks to #18100.
