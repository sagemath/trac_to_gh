# Issue 18910: Affine connections on smooth manifolds

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19147

Keywords: differentiable manifold, affine connection, curvature, torsion

This ticket implements affine connections on infinitely differentiable manifolds (i.e. smooth manifolds) . This is a follow-up of #19092 within the [SageManifolds project](http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/) (see the metaticket #18528 for an overview). As in #19092, the non-discrete topological field K over which the smooth manifold is defined is generic, although in most applications, K=*R* or K=*C*.

Affine connections are implemented via the Python class `AffineConnection`, the user interface being the method `DiffManifold.affine_connection()`. At the user choice, CPU-demanding computations (like that of the Riemann curvature tensor) can be parallelized, thanks to #18100.

The parallelization is not effective in the latest commit (cf. the discussion starting from comment 74 in #18529). Hence the FIXME comment in the doctest at line 1730 of `affine_connection.py`.
