I'm not working on a fix. As a workaround, I am using the following local script.
{{{#! /bin/bash
# from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1668649/how-to-keep-quotes-in-bash-arguments/8723305
if [ "$#" -lt 1 ]; then
 quoted_args=""
else
 quoted_args="$(printf " %q" "${@}")"
fi
ssh -t $MY_SERVER_WITH_MAPLE maple "$quoted_args"
```
