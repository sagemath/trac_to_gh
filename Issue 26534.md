Keywords: cluster algebra, generalized cluster algebra,

This ticket is being opened to describe proposed work for an coding sprint at the IMA.

In 2011, [Chekhov and Shapiro](https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.3963) introduced a generalization of cluster algebras in which the exchange polynomials are allowed to have arbitrarily many terms.

We want to create a new class, GeneralizedClusterSeed, and related methods necessary to implement these algebras in Sage. We plan to build on the framework established by Rupel and Stella's [implementation](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/algebras/sage/algebras/cluster_algebra.html) of cluster algebras.

Our major functionality objectives are:
* creating a class for generalized cluster seeds, with analogous attributes to ClusterSeed
* implementing generalized mutation for arbitrary coefficients
* creating methods for calculating left and right companion algebras
* creating a method for unfolding cluster algebras

For more information, see:

We are using the automated behavior of the git trac command.  Does this command needed to be updated to make the default use "public" as opposed to "user_names", especially when multiple developers are collaborating?

The default behavior generally assumes one person pushing to a private branch.  The solution here is to stop using the default bahavior.

Instead, please run something like:


```
git trac push --branch public/ticket-26771 26771
```


This will set the branch name for the ticket to `public/ticket-26771` and subsequent pushes will continue to use that upstream branch, rather than constantly switching it between your private branches.  

Locally your branch is still yours to work in.  It's just when you push/pull that you will have to resolve conflicts, etc.

First of all please accept my apologies for taking so long before reviewing this.

I think that the code in this ticket is far from being ready for a positive
review for several reasons.

First of all there is still some debugging scaffolding left over, e.g. at lines
just after 1275. This, and any other such, should be removed.

Talking of these lines, is `//` really not working? If so this could explain the major
issue I will point out later on.

Second the code introduces a lot of unnecessary small changes like spaces and
newlines that make the patch much bigger than it needs to be. Unnecessary white
spaces at the end of lines should be avoided. It looks to me that the code here
was based on #28176 before it was finalized and therefore it redoes/undoes many of
the changes already implemented there. Please remove all of those; ideally this
thicket should be rebased on the current develop. I tried doing so but it is not
working automagically so someone (else) familiar with the changes should do it. 

Similarly the code should be better formatted avoiding long lines and using the
correct spacing.

On a more substantial note, the use of both `d` and `Z` is redundant. I
understand that one wants to allow `d` as an input but there is no need to carry
over both of them in the implementation.

Why are you keeping around two copies of the greedy_element framework?

The major obstacle to giving a positive review to this code is the big slowdown
it introduces. For example here is the old version in action on my laptop


```
  sage: A = ClusterAlgebra(['E',8],foo=random())
  ....: S = A.seeds(mutating_F = False)
  ....: %time _ = list(S)
  CPU times: user 21.4 s, sys: 209 ms, total: 21.6 s
  Wall time: 21.6 s
  sage: A = ClusterAlgebra(['E',8],foo=random())
  ....: %time A.explore_to_depth(infinity)
  CPU times: user 23.9 s, sys: 191 ms, total: 24.1 s
  Wall time: 24.1 s
```


and here is the new one:


```
  sage: A = ClusterAlgebra(['E',8],foo=random())
  ....: S = A.seeds(mutating_F = False)
  ....: %time _ = list(S)
  CPU times: user 1min 35s, sys: 1.69 s, total: 1min 37s
  Wall time: 1min 37s
```


exploring the exchange graph while computing cluster variables with the new code
does not terminate in any reasonable amount of time (I killed it after 30
minutes).

I see three possible reasons for this slowdown: 

- the algorithms are inherently slower for generalized cluster algebras

- working over symbolic rings is slow

- you are using `/` rather than `//`

I doubt the reason is the third one since the slowdown appear also when not
mutating F_polynomials. The code computing mutations of seeds uses just basic
linear algebra and a 400% slowdown in it indicates some major issue.

If the reasons are the first two I would strongly advice to retool this
implementation according to this scheme: 

- write a base class in which all the common code is located

- add two more classes ClusterAlgebra and GeneralizedClusterAlgebra that inherit
  from the base class

In doing so please make sure that no significant slowdown is introduced in the
current code.
