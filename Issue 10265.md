CC:  abmasse

Add a word constructor that returns the sequence of the sum mod `m` of the digits written in base ``base`` of the integer sequence ``seq``.

For example, the sum of digits modulo 2 of the prime numbers written in base 2::


```
sage: words.SumDigits(primes(1000))
word: 1001110100111010111011001011101110011011...
```

Hi Sébastien!

Some remarks

1. I'm not sure that this generator should be placed here. It sounds a lot like the `delta` and `partial_sums` functions for the infinite words class. Shouldn't it be placed there along with these functions? Another argument in that direction: to be more coherent with the object-oriented approach, it seems to me that the parameter `seq` should be `self`, i.e. the function should belong to the word/sequence `seq`.
2. If you don't agree with the first comment, I suggest to name the function `SumDigitsWord`.
3. One of the parameter is `m`, I suggest replacing it with `mod` which is more significant.
4. Is there any reason why the `m` parameter allows one to relabel the word with new letters? I don't think the function `SumDigits` should be taking care of that translation.
5. For the Thue-Morse word example, I would add a line that checks if the first, say 500 letters, are indeed the same.
6. Very minor remark, but in the first sentence of the docstring, I would replace "mod" with "modulo". 

That's it for now!

Hi, Sébastien !

Thank you for the modifications. There is one last thing that need to be corrected. When I create a word with a negative value, there is an infinite loop


```
sage: w = Word([-1,0,1,2,3,4,5])
sage: w.sum_digits() # infinite loop

```


Except that, everything else seems fine.
