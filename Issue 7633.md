Thanks to #7627 I just looked at the very nice notebook settings page, and noticed that the save/cancel buttons are hidden at the bottom.  It would be nice replicate them at the top of the screen too.

Reviewer patch. Apply on top of previous. Does the same for Account Settings, and changes the elements from <input>s to <button>s.
