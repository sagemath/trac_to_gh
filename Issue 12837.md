# Issue 12837: Add blank lines for a couple plots in reference manual

In graphics.py, we have

```
plot(sin(pi*x), (x, -8, 8)) # Labels not so helpful
plot(sin(pi*x), (x, -8, 8), ticks=2) # Multiples of 2
plot(sin(pi*x), (x, -8, 8), ticks=[[-7,-3,0,3,7],[-1/2,0,1/2]]) # Your choices
plot(sin(pi*x), (x, -8, 8), ticks=[[],[]]) # No ticks at all!
```

but then in the live documentation only the last one shows up, so we should separate them with

```

::

```

things.

Oh, is that why there are so many extra `::` in Sage docstrings? I wondered about that.

Why not just wrap them with show() or put them in a single "line" by wrapping them with parentheses and semicolons?


```
show(plot(sin(pi*x), (x, -8, 8))) # Labels not so helpful
show(plot(sin(pi*x), (x, -8, 8), ticks=2)) # Multiples of 2
show(plot(sin(pi*x), (x, -8, 8), ticks=[[-7,-3,0,3,7],[-1/2,0,1/2]])) # Your choices
show(plot(sin(pi*x), (x, -8, 8), ticks=[[],[]])) # No ticks at all!
```


or


```
( plot(sin(pi*x), (x, -8, 8)) ; # Labels not so helpful
  plot(sin(pi*x), (x, -8, 8), ticks=2) ; # Multiples of 2
  plot(sin(pi*x), (x, -8, 8), ticks=[[-7,-3,0,3,7],[-1/2,0,1/2]]) ; # Your choices
  plot(sin(pi*x), (x, -8, 8), ticks=[[],[]]) ) # No ticks at all!
```

Well, whatever.  We've basically been doing it this way for a while, and since `plot(foo)` _does_ indeed implicitly call show, it's a little easier.  There are some doctests out there that use the `show()` syntax.  But I do prefer the `::` business.
