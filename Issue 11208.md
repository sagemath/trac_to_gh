Keywords: norm-euclidean, two-stage euclidean, continued_fraction

We have implemented some routines that allow for the computation of continued fractions in real quadratic number fields of class number one. This uses 2-stage division chains as defined in G.E.Cooke,"A weakening of the euclidean property for integral domains and applications to algebraic number theory".

The algorithm finds a set of "hyperbolic regions" as described in the above article, large enough so that it covers a fundamental domain. These regions are used to construct 2-stage division chains and therefore obtain continued fractions with elements of the ring of integers of the number field.

More information can be found in the preprint posted in the Math Arxiv: http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.0856

Also available as a pip-installable package that runs on top of Sage:

I have added a second patch, which should be applied after the first. This will replace the .py with a .pyx and fix some errors.

I think that this works now as expected. Sorry for the small mess...it's my first ticket :-).

I updated the patch with the suggested changes. As for the review, during this weekend we plan to upload our preprint to the arxiv, and there you can find the algorithm that we are using explained.

In short, what the only function accessible should do is to return a list of elements of the ring of integers of the number field, so that they are a (terminating) continued fraction for the given element.
