# Issue 25507: construct sbox from univariate polynomial

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25744

Original creator: asante

Original creation time: 2018-07-02 15:04:04

Keywords: sbox, days94

Many good constructions of S-boxes are defined as univariate polynomial, so it would be nice, if the SBox constructor can handle such a representation.

You can import `is_Polynomial` from `sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_element` and instead of using `isinstance(args[0], Polynomial)`, you may use `is_Polynomial(args[0])`.

Also, I think the polynomial needs to be defined over a finite field with characteristic `2`, this needs to be checked.

And the construction of `S` can be simplified further as `S = [ poly(v) for v in sorted(R) ]`

Mh, I'm not sure if it has to be defined over characteristic two?

As discussed on Zulip, we implicitly assume characteristic 2 basically everywhere in this module, so we check for this here, too.
