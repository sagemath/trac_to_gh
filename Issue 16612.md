While working on #16667, I noticed that the build system for Cython code in Sage (a.k.a. `sage -b`) no longer detects `c_lib` headers as dependency: changing `src/c_lib/include/interrupt.h` for example should cause many files to be recompiled.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16849

Volker, I have made this a blocker because I think it can cause really trouble during development, but feel free to downgrade the priority. The only reason this isn't so serious is that `c_lib` isn't changed often.
