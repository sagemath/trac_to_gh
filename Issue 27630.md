I get occasional failures in dynamics â€” this one about half the time:

```
sage -t src/sage/dynamics/arithmetic_dynamics/endPN_automorphism_group.py
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/dynamics/arithmetic_dynamics/endPN_automorphism_group.py", line 1456, in sage.dynamics.arithmetic_dynamics.endPN_automorphism_group.automorphisms_fixing_pair
Failed example:
    automorphisms_fixing_pair(f, L, False)
Expected:
    [(6*z + 6)/z, 6/(z + 1)]
Got:
    [6/(z + 1), (6*z + 6)/z]

   1 of   6 in sage.dynamics.arithmetic_dynamics.endPN_automorphism_group.automorphisms_fixing_pair

```

and this one once out of ten tries:

```
sage -t src/sage/dynamics/arithmetic_dynamics/endPN_automorphism_group.py
**********************************************************************

    (-z - 1)/(z - 1)]
Got:

But if you remove dynamics from the list of good directories, positive review.

maybe we can rather sort these doctests ?

Branch pushed to git repo; I updated commit sha1. New commits:

ok, I have added `sorted` and changed the doctests. Now the bots will not manage to check this ticket, because the python3-list is (stupidly) not in a "safe" location..

Okay with me.
