This presumably broke `sage_mode` (cf. [this post on sage-devel](http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.mathematics.sage.devel/88271)).

And this also seems related:

```
After the update, on exit from Sage I get

After doing "sage --pip install service_identity"
this warning goes away.

Any idea what happens here?
