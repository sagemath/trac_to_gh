Doctest failure here:

```
File "src/sage/categories/morphism.pyx", line 269, in sage.categories.morphism.Morphism.register_as_coercion
Failed example:
    phi.register_as_coercion()
Expected:
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    AssertionError: coercion from Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Integer Ring to Univariate Polynomial Ring in y over Integer Ring already registered or discovered
Got:
    <BLANKLINE>
```


I cannot remember if this behavior was intentional or not as we might not wanted to create a coercion after explicitly checking that there was not one as a safety check. However, even if that was the case, I think this is the more natural thing to permit since the user should really know what they are doing to add this.

So once the doctest is fixed, then you can set a positive review on my behalf.
