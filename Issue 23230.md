- `order` is a duplicate of `cardinality` that is moreover wrong

```
sage: QQ['x'].quo(1).order()
A positive finite number
```

- `cardinality` returns Python integers

```
sage: type(QQ['x'].quo(1).cardinality())
<type 'int'>
```

- iteration not possible

```
sage: list(R.quo(x^3 - x + 1))
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NotImplementedError: object does not support iteration
```

Adele,

When you review a ticket you should not put your names in the `Authors` field but `Reviewers` one.
