https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/develop/build/sage_bootstrap/download/mirror_list.py#L203 falls back to the server http://sagepad.org/

Who runs this server? Is this fallback still needed? 

This server is not mentioned in https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/Infrastructure

Sagepad seems to belong to Volker, so I would guess that this is his server, and I hope he can tell you whether it is obsolete.  See
https://www.openhub.net/p/sagepad and https://github.com/vbraun/sagepad

it seems that `sagepad` project has not been touched for 10 years. The server just gives a default Centos web server page, nothing there it seems.
