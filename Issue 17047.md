CC:  @vbraun @kcrisman @strogdon

This should open a Tachyon-rendered plot (and this worked until very recently):

```
sage: cube(viewer="tachyon")
```


The following still works:

```
sage: cube(viewer="tachyon").show()
```


Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17284

This does work here from the command line. The notebook also seems OK. However, the ipynb seems to be malfunctioning. The default in ipynb is Tachyon, i.e. `cube()` returns a Tachyon rendered image.

I can't test it out immediately because I don't have time to compile up to rc1 right now, but this seems okay.  

Only one question - there are other viewers (e.g. canvas3d) available in the notebook, so I assume this code will only be reached in the command line?  Currently we get, in the command line,

```

sage: cube().show(viewer='canvas3d')

UnboundLocalError: local variable 'viewer_app' referenced before assignment

This is a noble goal and I totally agree that the 3d graphics show code is miserable due to accretion of layers over the years, but I think it probably isn't really worth the effort to fix that *right now* because it will be pretty hard to test for all possible bugs easily.  On the other hand, putting something like that in an early beta someday when there aren't actual bugs to fix seems fine.

It's also worth pointing out that one reason that is so messy is because the actual creation of most plots is viewer-agnostic, which was deemed to be "a good thing" by TBDFL.

True, though that *still* might not make dealing with it worth the while as compared to other things one could spend time on.  That's why I always visually tested output when I reviewed changes in things related to it, though probably one would want to do so in any case - esp. given that we can't do like mpl and have pre-existing files to test against, at least I don't think so.
