# Issue 33081: speed up is_prime() for very small integers

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33318

Original creator: lorenz

Original creation time: 2022-02-09 17:13:52

This patch adds the use of a lookup table to compute `.is_prime()` for very small integers. I arbitrarily chose the cutoff at 1000, using a hard-coded table of 500 booleans. This is obviously up for discussion.

Since it comes basically for free, we also trial-divide small integers by 2 before calling a primality test. The reason we do this for 2 only is because (1) division by 2 is extremely cheap using bit operations, and (2) it allows us to halve the table size.

Example benchmark:

```
sage: p1,e1,o1, p2,e2,o2 = 997,998,999, 1009,1010,1011
....: _ = [x.is_prime() for x in (p1,e1,o1,p2,e2,o2)]  # warm up
....: %timeit p1.is_prime()
....: %timeit e1.is_prime()
....: %timeit o1.is_prime()
....: %timeit p2.is_prime()
....: %timeit e2.is_prime()
....: %timeit o2.is_prime()
```


Sage 9.5:

```
166 ns ± 0.754 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000000 loops each)
135 ns ± 0.468 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000000 loops each)
138 ns ± 0.261 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000000 loops each)
171 ns ± 2.28 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000000 loops each)
136 ns ± 0.729 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000000 loops each)
139 ns ± 0.409 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000000 loops each)
```


This branch:

```
109 ns ± 0.785 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000000 loops each)
112 ns ± 1.82 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000000 loops each)
109 ns ± 2.15 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000000 loops each)
169 ns ± 2.25 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000000 loops each)
104 ns ± 0.359 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000000 loops each)
140 ns ± 0.849 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000000 loops each)
```


The new code path is taken in lines 1,2,3,5.

I noticed that _small_primes_table is just bits and then I found http://oeis.org/A133155 

I updated their code to

```
a = gmpy2.mpz(0)
for p in range(3, 500, 2):
    if gmpy2.is_prime(p):
        a = setBit(a, (p - 1) / 2)
        print(a)
```


and then used `format(large_x, "b").zfill(9000)` to get long bitstring of _small_primes_table.

After that I splitted bitstring into 32-bit chunks and recreated _small_primes_table this way:

```
_small_primes_table = [ 
    1689570158, 2171409050, 2253016114,  563511821, #   1,   3,..., 255
    1510225097, 2760466720,  696652100, 1244168913, # 257, 259,..., 511
    ...
```


and oneliner `return _small_primes_table[u >> 1]` turns to something like

```
        index = u >> 1
        mask = 1 << index % 32
        return (_small_primes_table[index >> 5] & mask) != 0
```

When I finish with filling `_small_primes_table` I will benchmark my alternative too.

benchmark shows that my alternative patch makes is_prime() even slower than no patch at all :)
Sorry for the noise.

Looks great.
