Although we have deferred the Arb upgrade to Sage 9.3, on various platforms (e.g. `ubuntu-groovy-standard`, https://github.com/sagemath/sage/runs/1058929422) we are already getting the doctest failures because system Arb is 2.18.

Hence we need to adjust the doctests (see #28623) already in Sage 9.2

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30486

In #28623#comment:25
there are examples of tests that lead to an error on 2.16, while producing 
a meaningful answer on 2.18, so I don't really think this is easy to consolidate - without making doctests dependent on the arb  version (are there facilities for this ?)

I don't think it is silly. pkg-config would be a nice alternative but being able to interrogate the library/program itself about its own version should be a standard feature.

I like the branch, it looks good to me.
