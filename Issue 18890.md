CC:  @hivert @nathanncohen

No change in functionality, just some clean up.

In particular:
- move the code for running Sphinx to `src/doc/builder`
- do not create and delete empty directories, instead silence the Sphinx warnings about non-existing directories
- instead of `compile()`, use `import`
- add a new variable `SAGE_DOC_OUTPUT` for `src/doc/output` (with the idea that this might be moved to `local/share/doc` in the future)

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19127

LGTM. Two minor comments though:
* I wonder why you renamed the logger to `doc.builder` (the obvious reason to change the name would be to follow the more-or-less standard convention of “namespacing” it using the corresponding Python module name, but that's not what you do).
* The developer guide contains a mention of `SAGE_ROOT/src/doc/builder/__init__.py` that probably should be updated or removed.
