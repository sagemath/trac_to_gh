Note: in `src/setup.py`, we change the location of `c_lib` includes to `$SAGE_SRC/c_lib/include` instead of the installed location `$SAGE_LOCAL/include/csage` since the latter is not automatically cleaned (installed files just remain there).

If we are not going to use installed headers we may as well not install them at all. But then I guess we can keep that for the final removal.
