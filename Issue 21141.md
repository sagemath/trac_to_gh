# Issue 21141: Make doc-clean when making ptestlong

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: rws

Original creation time: 2016-08-31 09:18:36

I just had a doc build error in `make ptestlong` that went away with `make doc-clean`. Assuming that isn't done automatically before starting the doc build, I think that it should.

I disagree with this. Rebuilding the documentation *every time you run make ptestlong* makes no sense.

#19882 is a better solution to the problem anyway.
