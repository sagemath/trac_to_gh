Here is another problem, of the same kind:

```
sage: G = PermutationGroup([[2,1]]); G
Permutation Group with generators [(1,2)]
sage: g = G.gens()
sage: g[0] = 1
sage: G.gens()
[1]
```

I checked a few examples of groups, the all return a tuple.

A while-we-are-at-it thing would be to replace the `$` with a back tick ```. If you decide to do this or not, you can set a positive review on my behalf once the patchbot is green.
