# Issue 30938: refresh file generators/platonic_solids.py

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31175

We improve de coding style of the file and modify the methods in order to
- avoid using networkx to get the list of edges
- use `_circle_embedding` (the resulting embeddings are the same)
This is much cleaner this way.
