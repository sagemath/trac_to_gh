The introduction of a class attribute for the derived objects is a good idea! However, I would suggest that its name is changed from `DERIVED_OBJECTS` to `_derived_objects`. Indeed, it seems that in Sage, capital letters are not used for attributes. Moreover, the heading underscore indicates a "private" attribute, not exposed to a tab search. Otherwise, a user searching for some derivative via `g.der` + TAB, might find this attribute.

Here are some remarks about each of the three tensors:

- **Schouten tensor:** 
  The LaTeX formula defining the Schouten tensor in the documentation should
  use the same notations than in the rest of the documentation of class `PseudoRiemannianMetric`:
  Ricci should be denoted by 'Ric' (cf. method `ricci`) and the Ricci scalar should be denoted by 
  'r', not by 's' (cf. method `ricci_scalar`)

- **Cotton tensor:**
  The LaTeX formula defining the Cotton tensor in the documentation is not
  correct: it should be
  {{{
   C_{ijk} = \nabla_k S_{ij} - \nabla_j S_{ik}
  }}}
  (the Cotton tensor is antisymmetric in its last two indices).
  Besides, in the code, the line
  {{{
  cot = nabla(s).antisymmetrize(0,2)
  }}}
  must be replaced by
  {{{
  cot = 2 * nabla(s).antisymmetrize(1,2)
  }}}
  Indeed, the convention for the index positions of a covariant derivative is
  `(nabla(s))_{ijk} = \nabla_k s_{ij}`, i.e. the derivation index is the last one, cf. the note
  at http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/doc/19209/reference/manifolds/sage/manifolds/differentiable/affine_connection.html . Note also the factor 2 to compensate for the 1/2 factor introduced by the
  antisymmetrization. 
  Besides, I have the impression that in the literature, the Cotton tensor
  is generaly defined by
  {{{
  C_{ijk} = (n-2) ( \nabla_k S_{ij} - \nabla_j S_{ik} )
  }}}
  i.e. it differs from your definition by a factor n-2, cf. for instance
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton_tensor.
  Of course in dimension 3, both definitions coincide, but could you please
  check the literature for n > 3 ?

- **Cotton-York tensor:**
  Since in the rest of the documentation, $\epsilon$ stands for the Levi-Civita
  tensor (cf. the method `volume_form`), there should be no $\sqrt{\det g}$ in the LaTeX formula
  defining the Cotton-York tensor. Moreover, the indices seem ill-placed; the
  correct formula is (cf. Eq. (4) in York's paper, Phys. Rev. Lett. **26**, 1656 (1971)
  or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton_tensor)
  {{{
   CY_{ij} = \frac{1}{2} \epsilon^{kl}_{\quad i} C_{jlk} 
           = \epsilon^{kl}_{\quad i} \nabla_k S_{lj}
  }}}
  Accordingly, in the code, the ligne
  {{{
  cy = -cot.contract(0,2,eps,0,1)
  }}}
  must be replaced by
  {{{
  cy = (1/2) * eps.contract(0, 1, cot, 2, 1)
  }}}
  Besides, the test
  {{{
   if n < 3:
  }}}
  must be replaced by
  {{{   
   if n != 3:
  }}}

Yes, each ticket depends on the preceding one.  

> Such a deep dependency tree is scary.


This results from the split of SageManifolds into small tickets, to ease the review process.
Note that the dependency tree is linear: each ticket depends only on the preceding one, the top being now #18640. 
The full tree is sketched on the metaticket #18528.

This is done in the latest commit, along with some updates to take into account changes in #18640.
