# Issue 29505: is_unit() fails for power-series-ring element: O(t^0)

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29742

Keywords: power series, is_unit

Using version 9.1 of sage, is_unit() fails for the element O(t<sup>0</sup>) of a power-series ring. 

The bug does not depend on the base of the power-series. It occurs since is_unit() attempts to access the 0'th coefficient of the series, which does not exist in the special case of O(t<sup>0</sup>), resulting in an Index Error.
