Keywords: power series, coefficients

Currently `map_coefficients` works for polynomials by not power series:

```
sage: P.<z> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: p = 1+2*z+5*z^2
sage: p.map_coefficients(lambda x : x^2)
25*z^2 + 4*z + 1

sage: P.<z> = PowerSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: p = 1+2*z+5*z^2 + O(z^3)
sage: p.map_coefficients(lambda x : x^2)
...
AttributeError: 'sage.rings.power_series_poly.PowerSeries_poly' object has no attribute 'map_coefficients'
```

I'm giving a basic implementation calling the corresponding method on the underlying polynomial
