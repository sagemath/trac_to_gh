# Issue 23618: Deprecate various .pxi files

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23855

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2017-09-14 11:58:28

Cython upstream considers `.pxi` files to be semi-deprecated, so we should deprecate `cdefs.pxi` and friends, which are no longer used.

Would it be possible to doctest that the deprecation is actually visible?
