CC:  jpflori

Many Sage files contain

```
include 'sage/ext/cdefs.pxi'
```

without a good reason.

This file adds a dependency on the GMP declarations which is often unwanted.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18455

Couldn't we completely get rid of `cdefs.pxi`?
It does not seem that useful.
Or at least get rid of the `gmp` part within it.

By the way, your commits added an inclusion of `cdefs.pxi` in `integer.pyx`, was it intended?

> Couldn't we completely get rid of `cdefs.pxi`?
Well, there is always backwards compatibility for custom Cython code.
In the Sage library, we could get of it. But I'd rather not do that in this ticket, it's already big enough.

> By the way, your commits added an inclusion of `cdefs.pxi` in `integer.pyx`, was it intended?
Yes.
