To implement group actions on polyhedra, one usually wants affine groups. This acts on homogeneous coordinates. For vertices, this is the coordinates with a 1 appended. For rays and lines, this is the coordinates with a 0 appended.

One minor thing. Because the fact that the first sentence is telling what each method returns and the second is describing what that object is. I feel that the second sentence should not be in that short initial description, but instead in a second paragraph. I don't hold a strong opinion on this, so whether you make the changes or disagree, you can set a positive review on my behalf.
