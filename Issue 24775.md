I am running a number of jobs written in sage on a supercomputer. About 20 sage process are all started at the same time. About half an hour later a few fail with the same message at the same time

The obvious guess for what is happening is that each of these processes is trying to use the same lazy import cache, and only a few win the race to delete it.

This code is specifically meant to deal with such race conditions. But somehow it is still breaking anyway. Which filesystem are you using?",

That is not what is happening. This code is specifically meant to deal with such race conditions. But somehow it is still breaking anyway. Which filesystem are you using?

NFS. Would it work better on Lustre?

It is well known that NFS tends to break things which work perfectly for local filesystems. I have no idea what "Lustre" is.

Still, it would be interesting to know *why* it fails on NFS. Can you check with the following diff:
