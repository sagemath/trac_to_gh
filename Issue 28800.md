Sometimes it is useful to do a long computation and return `None` (say, because you realize something is impossible) and then store that computation. Furthermore, this is not a documented special case AFAIK, so even if we do not change the behavior, we need to add it to the documentation.

> Sometimes it is useful to do a long computation and return `None` (say, because you realize something is impossible) and then store that computation. Furthermore, this is not a documented special case AFAIK...

Yes it is documented:

```python
cdef class CachedMethodCallerNoArgs(CachedFunction):
    """
    Utility class that is used by :class:`CachedMethod` to bind a
    cached method to an instance, in the case of a method that does
    not accept any arguments except ``self``.

    .. NOTE::

        The return value ``None`` would not be cached. So, if you have
        a method that does not accept arguments and may return ``None``
        after a lengthy computation, then ``@cached_method`` should not
        be used.
...
```

I see; I didn't think of looking there. Perhaps we can make that more prominent, perhaps in the `cached_method` decorator?
