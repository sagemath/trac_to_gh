In preparation for a long needed overhaul (and a workshop in early 2021 I am planning), let's collect tickets and issues related to combinatorial species here.  An earlier roadmap is #10662.  An earlier attempt to refactor the species code is #20622.

* #16107 is the meta-ticket for lazy lists, refactoring the species code should cross check with #15673

* improve operations with symmetric functions - it would be particularly nice if a cycle index would just be a symmetric function, so we can immediately use their operations

* multivariate species, see #13264

* provide isomorphism types for functorial composition (which needs multivariate species)

* establish link to permutation groups, and thus provide the molecular/atomic decomposition of a species of fixed cardinality

* keep track of symbolic expressions for generating functions

* revive group cycle index #14347

* species for other groups, in particular the hyperoctahedral group

* interface to https://gitlab.com/ParComb/usain-boltz for random generation
