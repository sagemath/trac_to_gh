The git self-tests fail on OSX 10.8, 10.9 because of braindamage in Apple's regex library. This is worked around in upstream git, so just update to the latest and greatest:

```
*** t0070-fundamental.sh ***
ok 1 - character classes (isspace, isalpha etc.)
ok 2 - mktemp to nonexistent directory prints filename
ok 3 - mktemp to unwritable directory prints filename
not ok - 4 check for a bug in the regex routines
#	
#		# if this test fails, re-build git with NO_REGEX=1
#		test-regex
#	
# failed 1 among 4 test(s)
1..4
make[5]: *** [t0070-fundamental.sh] Error 1
make[4]: *** [test] Error 2
make[3]: *** [test] Error 2
Error running git's combined build/test suite.
```

Other than being slightly dated (1.8.5 came out a few days ago), this seems fine.

I'm not sure where to put this: the packages in "standard" are updated for every new release. There are also git packages in "optional" and "experimental" and the new "upstream/git".

I think we can get rid of the ones in optional and experimental and you mean to replace the one in upstream/git ?

This ticket is not a spkg, just a new-style tarball. Should go into upstream. We should probably keep the old git spkg in "standard" for a while if Sage 5 users need it.
