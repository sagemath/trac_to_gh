Hi Kini,

Thanks for this - looks like Dima beat me to a review.

Have you seen  `hg qpush --move some_patch.patch`  in the newest versions of Mercurial?   Let's you grab an unapplied patch out of any position in the unapplied stack to push on.

Hi Rob,

Sure. Yes, I've heard of it, and even use it :) But I didn't see how to work it in here what with the topic of this post. How many "different" things are supposed to fit into a single ticket, anyway? I saw your post on sage-devel about upgrading the developer guide, and it seems like it would be easier to just edit the docs and be done with it rather than submitting dozens of patches. (Well, I suppose that's what the Sage Wiki is for...)

Hi Keshav,

Just upgraded my OS, so now have a version of Mercurial with "--move" - been anxiously awaiting it.  It will make the Developers Guide better, no need to talk about editing the series file.  Just passing it along, in case you hadn't seen it.  ;-)

No - wasn't suggesting that for this ticket, or a new incremental ticket.  I'll try to round up a few details like this for the reorganization proposed in sage-devel.  Post there if you have any more tips or tricks!

Thanks,
Rob
