Please review. This should be simple enough, and will be helpful for the patchbot.

green bot, and you can see that the fermat patchbot is happy, for the first time since many months..

Since I don't have magma, I cannot explicitly check, but given that fermat is green (since that has magma), I am going to put this as a positive review.
