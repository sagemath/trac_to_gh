Update on his way, I'm just testing whether it still makes sense to disable the test we disabled back in 2010.

According to http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/10039#comment:14 this was on Solaris because of a GCC bug.
Therefore, I suggest to put the tests back in (only tested with SAGE_CHECK=yes anyway, and passed on a x86_64 and ppc64 systems).

The full test suite takes a loooong time, is it what is done here? Other that that I was convinced that sage was already at 1.1. I bumped sage-on-gentoo to 1.1 in the last couple of months. Where is your git branch?

Yup but is only run when you pass SAGE_CHECK=yes (and note that the patch only disabled three modules...)

FYI, the full PPL testsuite and Sage testsuite passed (quite quickly) on a POWER7 :)

I actually never tried to test sage or its bits in parallel on our box, because I cannot overload the login/build node you know. But given the low activity at the moment I'll schedule it on a compute node using the 32 cores and 128GB of ram :)

That was shockingly fast for ppl (~20 minutes) but it all passed on power7.
