# Issue 11195: Rounding values, and inconsistencies in graph methods

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/11367

This patch rounds values of methods when their result is expected to be integer (dominating set, flows, connectivity, ...)

It also modifies a "weight" parameter which should be replaced by the usual "use_edge_labels" parameter used throughout the file.
