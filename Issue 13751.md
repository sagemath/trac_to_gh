Keywords: Weyl groups

This short ticket provides the new behaviour


```
sage: W = WeylGroup(['A',2,1], prefix="s")
sage: [s0,s1,s2]=W.simple_reflections()
sage: latex(s0*s1) # indirect doctest
s_{0}s_{1}
```


to obtain proper latex output for Weyl groups with prefix.

Maybe write that without a for, something like that ?


```
sage: "".join(["s_{%d}"%k for k in range(6)])
's_{0}s_{1}s_{2}s_{3}s_{4}s_{5}'
```
