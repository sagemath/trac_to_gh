# Issue 31276: jupyter: "%display latex" completely breaks @interact

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31513

In sage-9.1, this works fine with Jupyter:

```
%display latex

then in another cell

@interact
def f(n=10):
    print(n)
```

However, in sage-9.2, the output of Interact is **displayed as latex**, i.e., somebody changed %display latex in such a way that it also breaks widgets. 

```

Changing priority from major to blocker.

Perhaps introduced by ipython upgrade in #28197?

FWIW, `%display latex` also breaks `%matplotlib notebook`. For instance the following cell in a Jupyter notebook

```
%display latex
%matplotlib notebook
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot([1, 2, 3, 4])
plt.ylabel('some numbers')
plt.show()
```

yields

```
<𝙸𝙿𝚢𝚝𝚑𝚘𝚗.𝚌𝚘𝚛𝚎.𝚍𝚒𝚜𝚙𝚕𝚊𝚢.𝙹𝚊𝚟𝚊𝚜𝚌𝚛𝚒𝚙𝚝𝚘𝚋𝚓𝚎𝚌𝚝>
<𝙸𝙿𝚢𝚝𝚑𝚘𝚗.𝚌𝚘𝚛𝚎.𝚍𝚒𝚜𝚙𝚕𝚊𝚢.𝙷𝚃𝙼𝙻𝚘𝚋𝚓𝚎𝚌𝚝>
```

instead of the pyplot window.
If one suppresses `%display latex` or replaces it by `%display plain`, then everything is fine: the interactive pyplot window appears, with the requested plot. 

Contrary to the issue with ``@`interact`, this one is also there in Sage 9.1, except that the output is only

```
<𝙸𝙿𝚢𝚝𝚑𝚘𝚗.𝚌𝚘𝚛𝚎.𝚍𝚒𝚜𝚙𝚕𝚊𝚢.𝙷𝚃𝙼𝙻𝚘𝚋𝚓𝚎𝚌𝚝>
```

Shall we revert #23330? It looks more important to have ipywidgets working than a correct pdf export.

Moreover, in the spirit of #31536, `tex/latex` mime type is to be deprecated in favor of `tex/html`.

BTW, this points to the need to move to the default Jupyter rich output display for latex (i.e. use `_repr_latex_` instead of `%display latex`), since the pdf export works out of the box with `_repr_latex_` and there is no interference with ipywidgets.

But then, there cannot be pdf export of latex-typeset formulas from `text/html`.

Here is a possible fix, which does not revert the pdf export fix introduced in #23330. I have instead modified `sage.repl.display.formatter.SageDisplayFormatter.format` so that IPython widgets are tried before Sage rich output. I've performed a few tests and things seem OK, but I am not completly sure about possible side effects of this fix. So please test it on your side.

Right. `tex/latex` is the right mime type for pdf output. What I don't like is the use of `latex` for mathjax+html. I misdirected my arrow.

Then you bypass the test `set(sage_format.keys()).issubset(self.default_mime())` checked before calling `self.ipython_display_formatter(obj)`. I guess the author (Volker?) of the test thought the test is necessary before resorting to ipython for output.

Do you understand the logic of the test? I don't. If you do, would you explain? As it is practically impossible to check all side effects of the change, I think we need to understand the logic correctly and be sure it is safe to bypass the test.

No. I have to look deeper. Certainly Volker should check this.

Now #31536 also contains fixes both for jupyter pdf export problem and this ticket.

Hope for no unexpected side effects..

This sounds nice! I'll look at it today.

Morally thats wrong, we should prefer our own formatter which gives e.g. the emacs backend a chance of handling things correctly. The problem is that ipython/jupyter doesn't have a blessed way of recognizing interact output, and moreover keeps adding more magic methods over time. The proposed patch is reasonable to me, hopefully the jupyter guys can keep `ipython_display_formatter` sufficently specific that only output is captured that is 100% ipython specific (like the current ``@`interact`s which cannot work anywhere else)

Note that I didn't actually check this ticket for regressions.

Thanks for your feedback.

#31536 seems in a good shape and would be a better fix for the issue reported here.

Now that #31536 is ready, we should use it to fix the issue reported here. In particular, #31536 complies with the moral behaviour expressed in comment:18.
