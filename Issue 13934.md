Il faut vraiment que vous compreniez que ce n'est pas en esperant que "quelqu'un finira par faire le taf un jour" que ces codes pourris vont se réécrire tout seuls. Si tous les gens qui utilisent ces codes savent ou sont les bugs et les contournent, ils n'ont aucune raison de se mettre à améliorer le code (puisqu'on dirait qu'ils ne tirent aucune fierté d'avoir un code propre) et on restera avec ces conneries à vie.

Ce qui personnellement me retient de les recoder, c'est parce que je refuse catégoriquement de mettre les mains dans les catégories. C'est exclusivement ca, parce que je sais que si je mets la main dedans j'aurai besoin de vous sans arret, que je ne serai autonome pour rien et que je devrais me farcir des choix de design avec lesquels je ne suis pas d'accord. Vous faites ce que vous voulez avec votre business, mais moi c'est ca qui me retient de programmer chez vous. Voilà.

Sinon, si ca vous botte de reviewer ces deux trois trucs sur lesquels j'ai passé une petite heure d'allers-retour en discutant avec un pote, ce sera toujours ca de fait.

Hello Nathann, the patch seems good and those files in `sage.combinat` need a lot of cleanup. They seem abandoned for years :(. I also have some other specific comments:
1. I think the following should be changed to

```
47	   The following functions will soon be deprecated.
```


```
The following functions are deprecated and will soon be removed.
```

2. The cardinality should be a method

```
2027	    deprecation(14138, 'Use Combinations(mset,k).cardinality instead.')
```


```
deprecation(14138, 'Use Combinations(mset,k).cardinality() instead.')
```

3. What is this deprecated in favor of? I think it should be mentioned that the `min_part=0` will raise an error in the future.

```
3763	                    from sage.misc.superseded import deprecation 
3764	                    deprecation(14138,"Currently, setting min_part=0 produces "+ 
3765	                                "Partition objects which violate internal "+ 
3766	                                "assumptions. Calling methods on these objects "+ 
3767	                                "may produce errors or WRONG results!") 
```

4. The following `..note::` should be deleted now since `Combinations` can handle any Sage object

```
def number_of_combinations(mset,k):
    """
    Returns the size of combinations(mset,k). IMPLEMENTATION: Wraps
    GAP's NrCombinations.

    .. note::

       ``mset`` must be a list of integers or strings (i.e., this is
       very restricted).
```

5. The last sentence should be removed here

```
    Returns the size of arrangements(mset,k). Wraps GAP's
    NrArrangements.
```

6. In the function `def number_of_permutations(mset):` I think you can replace all of its code with `Permutations(mset).cardinality()`?

Hi Nathann!

Thanks much for the cleanup!

A couple details:

- What's the reason for removing the doctests about
  cyclic_permutations_of_partition and cyclic_permutations?

- Don't deprecate min_part in Partitions. Even if fragile, it is
  useful in some cases, and we will want to support robustly at some
  point. The documentation warns the user.

  Besides, Partitions is under heavy refactoring by #13605 which will
  get into Sage soon; we don't want conflict with that.

- While you are at removing a space in sage/combinat/multichoose_nk.py,
  you might as well remove the comma before :-)

- Please check the discussion on sage-combinat-devel about
  number_of_partitions; I don't remember whether we decided we wanted
  to deprecate it or not.

- ``See http://trac.sagemath.org/14138 for details'' Please use :trac:`14138`.

  Besides, if the user is referred to the ticket, then the ticket
  should be more explicit not only about what you don't like, but what
  the ticket actually does about it.

Cheers,
                           Nicolas

I wrote that above. The reason is that the code changed as it now calls what it should have been calling in the first place, and this doctests which says that "the behaviour is not the one that we usually expect" has apprently become what one would expect. Correct it if it is wrong.

I did not want to deprecate min_part but min_part = 0 only. Because IT RETURNS WRONG RESULTS.

>   Besides, Partitions is under heavy refactoring by #13605 which will
>   get into Sage soon; we don't want conflict with that.

This ticket was positively reviewed yesterday, your ticket #13605 is 4 months old, is needing a review, weighs 400kb and depends on another ticket #13688 which also needs a review. Why the hell would you delay this one instead and have us work on top of yours ?
 
> - Please check the discussion on sage-combinat-devel about

Have fun chatting about what should be done in the future. `number_of_partitions` has been deprecated by #13072.

> - ``See http://trac.sagemath.org/14138 for details'' Please use :trac:`14138`.

This is no Sphinx code. This is a deprecation warning, automatically generated by the `deprecation()` function.

What I do not like in this ticket should be obvious to everybody. Just read the code sample and the documentation I quoted.

This ticket has been created, written and reviewed in three days. It is very short. Unless you can give me a fair reason why my patch should depend on yours, which once more is NOT reviewed, is 400kb long and depends on another ticket which still waits for a review please set this ticket back to its initial state.

Bullshit. Quand je vous parle de bugs dans votre code, la seule réponse que j'ai jamais eue c'est 'on le fera plus tard', ou "faut voir si le code perso de tout le monde continue à passer". JE fixe les bugs que je trouve dans votre code, et votre code pourri ruine MES calculs. Je fous dans ce projet les codes dont je pense qu'ils peuvent aider d'autres personnes, mais je ne me permets pas d'y foutre des trucs faux qui peuvent induire en erreur des mecs qui essaient de faire leur taf.

Vous ne prioritisez pas, vous vous foutez de ma gueule. Vous ne corrigez pas les bugs que vous voyez, vous les remettez systematiquement à plus tard, et c'est pour ca que j'écris des patches comme celui-là. Je change ce que je peux changer sans avoir a comprendre vos hierachies insupportables. Sur #14019 il est écrit que Florent s'engageait à corriger le bug des posets sous un mois. C'était le 27 janvier. Si tu devais prendre les paris dessus, tu dirais quoi ? Qu'il est dessus, ou qu'il a oublié ? Il reste une semaine. Je crois que depuis mon départ j'ai du lui balancer une bonne dizaine de mails auxquels je n'ai eu AUCUNE réponse.

J'en ai marre de la politique. Faut corriger ces conneries, et le faire vite. Si vous preferez passer votre temps à discuter c'est cool, mais faut nous laisser faire le taf urgent. Et les résultats faux, c'est prioritaire sur les features.

Perfect. Thanks for checking this out.
