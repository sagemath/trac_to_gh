Before this wait until all old-style line continuations are corrected; see for example #21650.

There are more than thousand doctest lines without 4-space indentation. Those can be found by


```
egrep -R '^ *\.\.\.\.: {1,3}[^ ]' src/sage  | wc -l
```


and corrected by Perl.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21673
