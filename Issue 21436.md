# Issue 21436: Indentation in doctests

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21673

Original creator: jmantysalo

Original creation time: 2016-10-10 06:17:23

CC:  tscrim

Before this wait until all old-style line continuations are corrected; see for example #21650.

There are more than thousand doctest lines without 4-space indentation. Those can be found by


```
egrep -R '^ *\.\.\.\.: {1,3}[^ ]' src/sage  | wc -l
```


and corrected by Perl.

Changing status from new to needs_review.

I was wrong. This is not doable with simple perl. So I suggest closing this as wontfix.

This is something we can do file by file as we come across them.

Closing tickets in the sage-duplicate/invalid/wontfix module with positive_review (i.e. someone has confirmed they should be closed).
