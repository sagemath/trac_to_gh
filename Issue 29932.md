I am not sure about the change I made in the first commit. Surely the category should depend on the category of the underlying free module, but I suspect some construction functor needs to come into play.

Since this fixes the problem with the ticket description, I would be willing to set a positive review. However, I suspect there might be some test failures given the latest working patchbot report. So I want to wait for a working patchbot report.

I am not convinced they should be the same because something in the tensor space should not be the same thing, even though they are isomorphic. The user might expect certain features and semantics that would be different if `M.tensor_module(0, 1)` does not return a `TensorFreeModule`.
