CC:  @jdemeyer

There exists a method `PowerSeries_poly.__floordiv__()`, but it is not clear how it differs from ordinary division (see comment:43:ticket:15601), or how it should differ mathematically.

We replace this method by a new method `PowerSeries._floordiv_()`, which is a deprecated alias for `_div_()`.

Why would this be necessary?  If the user calls `__floordiv__`, he presumably does this for a reason, i.e. expects that it behaves differently from `__div__`...

Well, power series rings are not fields.  There is also an implementation of `_floordiv_` in `RingElement`, which explicitly raises an error saying `unsupported operand parent(s) for '//'`.  In fact, this error is even raised when applying `__floordiv__` to elements of `RR`:

```
sage: RR(1.2) // RR(2.3)
...
TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for '//': 'Real Field with 53 bits of precision' and 'Real Field with 53 bits of precision'
```


> So I would not deprecate it, but rather simply make it an (non-deprecated) alias of `__div__`.

Then we should do this in general for ring elements; I don't really see the advantage of this...

In my opinion, it would make more sense to make sure that power series rings `R` over a field, or more generally all discrete valuation rings `(R, v)`, are put into the category of Euclidean domains.  Then floor division in `R` can be implemented using Euclidean division, so `f // g = f / g` if `v(g) <= v(f)` and `f // g = 0` if `v(g) > v(f)`.  However, this has the disadvantage that it is not the same as the current `__floordiv__`, which (as far as I can see) is the same as `__div__`.

One case I very often encounter is the need of an "exact division", that is a division when you know in advance that the result is exact.

Right. But this behavior for `RR` is currently being discussed in #15260.

That's right, it is probably a bad idea to make `__floordiv__` an alias of `__div__` in this case.

Then floor division in `R` can be implemented using Euclidean division, so `f // g = f / g` if `v(g) <= v(f)` and `f // g = 0` if `v(g) > v(f)`.  However, this has the disadvantage that it is not the same as the current `__floordiv__`, which (as far as I can see) is the same as `__div__`.

You're perfectly right. My two-cent on this would be as follows:

* `__div__` should return an element of the fraction field, as it is the case for elements of `ZZ` or polynomials for instance; I find the current situation weird:

```python
sage: R.<x> = QQ[[]]
sage: (1/(1+x)).parent()
Power Series Ring in x over Rational Field
sage: (1/x).parent()
Laurent Series Ring in x over Rational Field
```

  while for instance for `ZZ`:

```python
sage: (1/1).parent() is (1/2).parent()
True
```



* `__floordiv__` in power series rings over a field should return the quotient in the euclidean division, since these rings are euclidean.

* `__floordiv__` in power series rings over `ZZ` (say) should behave the same way as it behaves for polynomials over `ZZ`, that is return the quotient in the euclidean division (as over `QQ`) but reducing each coefficient modulo the leading coefficient of the divisor. For instance, `2-3*x-x<sup>2+O(x</sup>3)//(2+x)` should equal `1-2*x+0*x<sup>2+O(x</sup>3)`.

I think that such category stuff should probably not be used for Cython methods, I'm not entirely surprised that it doesn't work.

In any case, I think there is not much point in implementing stuff if we haven't agreed on the semantics of `//`.

For the deprecation policy, I (probably) agree that we should warn the user. Isn't it possible to put a deprecation warning while changing the behavior? I mean, one could do something like:\n\n* If `self.quo_rem(other)` works, return `self.quo_rem(other)[0]`;\n* Else return `self._div_(other)`;\n* In all cases, print a deprecation message such as (message to be improved for sure!): `The operator // now performs a euclidean division (when possible) rather than a division. Use / instead to perform a division.`\n\nBtw, I think that this change should also go with a change of behavior in the `truediv` algorithm, that should always return an element of the fraction field of the PowerSeries ring.",

I did not notice that, so you probably knew this `:-)`.

> Yes, absolutely.  There are two problems: (1) due to the problem mentioned in comment:5, it seems that we cannot easily implement a generic `__floordiv__` using `quo_rem` for all Euclidean domains simultaneously, and (2) in view of backward compatibility it would not be very good to change the behaviour of `__floordiv__` without any warning or deprecation of the old behaviour.

Again, I simply trust you for the technical part about `__floordiv__`. For the deprecation policy, I (probably) agree that we should warn the user. Isn't it possible to put a deprecation warning while changing the behavior? I mean, one could do something like:

* If `self.quo_rem(other)` works, return `self.quo_rem(other)[0]`;
* Else return `self._div_(other)`;
* In all cases, print a deprecation message such as (message to be improved for sure!): `The operator // now performs a euclidean division (when possible) rather than a division. Use / instead to perform a division.`

Btw, I think that this change should also go with a change of behavior in the `truediv` algorithm, that should always return an element of the fraction field of the PowerSeries ring.

A proposal along the line of my previous comment would be as follows:


```python
    cpdef RingElement _floordiv_(self, RingElement denom):
        """
        ...
        """
        from sage.misc.superseded import deprecation                               
        try:                                                                       
            deprecation(20062, "the operator // now performs a euclidean division for power series over fields,      use / instead to perform a (true) division")
            return self.quo_rem(denom)[0]                                          
        except AttributeError, NotImplementedError:                              
            deprecation(20062, "the operator // is deprecated for power series over non-fields, use / instead")
            return self._div_(denom)
```


Testing this code, I get a deprecation warning about deprecation warnings so it is probably not the right way to write this:


```python 
/opt/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/IPython/core/formatters.py:92: DeprecationWarning: DisplayFormatter._ipython_display_formatter_default is deprecated: use @default decorator instead.
```

The new comment implements a variant of your suggestion; I think the message in the case of fields should be a normal warning (since the behaviour changed), not a deprecation.
