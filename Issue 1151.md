The problem is that QQ[x]/(x^2+1) cannot be a base ring in singular, and when we try to reduce (in creating an element), we can't compute a Grobner basis.

We need to handle multivariable quotients better over general rings.  One solution would be to write a naive groebner basis implementation that works over an arbitrary ring.

Changing component from algebraic geometry to commutative algebra.

I've got a possibly very stupid question first. Isn't 


```
sage: A.<x> = QQ[]
sage: Gauss.<i> = A.quotient(x^2+1)
```


equivalent to:


```
sage: A.<x> = QQ[]
sage: Gauss.<i> = NumberField(x^2+1)
```


? If so, then the base field can be coerced to Singular:


```
sage: R.<c,d,X1,Y1,X2,Y2,Z1,Z2> = Gauss[]
sage: S = R.quotient([(X1^2+Y1^2)*Z1^2-c^2*(Z1^4+d*X1^2*Y1^2),
....:                     (X2^2+Y2^2)*Z2^2-c^2*(Z2^4+d*X2^2*Y2^2)])
sage: S(1)
1
```


The behaviour described above would still be a bug but a different one.

Besides that detail, I have a 100% generic Gr√∂bner basis implementation in pure Python (very very slow) that -- once integrated -- will resolve this bug for any base field (and ZZ).

malb -- A number field is a totally different sort of object in Sage than
`A.quotient(x^2 + 1)`.   It happens that the two are  abstractly isomorphic, though, so whatever coercion you're thinking about can probably be made to work.

Attachment

after #2111 has been merged, this patch fixes the issue of this ticket

I claim that this issue was resolved in Sage 2.10.2.alpha0.

When I apply trac_1151.patch the above example works, so if somebody gives it a positive review I will merge it.

Cheers,

Michael

patch still applies to 2.10.2 and make test passes.

The patch looks good to me.

Maybe we should add the original example as a test somewhere, but where?

Comment by mabshoff created at 2008-02-27 23:20:14

Merged in Sage 2.10.3.rc0

Resolution: fixed
