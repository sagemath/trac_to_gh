`src/sage/categories/coercion_methods.pyx` conflicts with #20767. Please just remove all changes to that file (or at least make sure that it doesn't conflict).

Please don't change `src/sage_setup/docbuild/ext/sage_autodoc.py`. It should be treated as a file coming from upstream.

ok, here is a branch where I have just reverted the changes in one file. This branch passes all doctests, so I will assume that I can put it to positive review in your name.
