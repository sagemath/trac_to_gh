# Issue 21355: ".. note:" must be ".. note::"

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21592

Original creator: jmantysalo

Original creation time: 2016-09-25 16:45:55

CC:  chapoton jhpalmieri

See for example `isogeny_graph()` on elliptic curves over the rational numbers: http://sage-doc.sis.uta.fi/reference/curves/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_rational_field.html. The note "The vertices are labeled 1 to n - -" is not shown at all. The reason is


```
.. note:
```


that should be


```
.. note::
```


According to


```
egrep -R -i '^ +\.\. note:$' src/sage
```


there are 19 files with this bug and a total of 34 lines to correct.

Perl is... perl.


```
find src/sage -name '*.py' -or -name '*.pyx' -or -name '*.pxi' | xargs perl -e 's|(^ +)\.\. note:(?=$)|$1.. note::|g;' -p -i.bak
```


Anyways, this should work. Not tested yet, just compiling.

John, maybe you are also interested in this. Does this make some harm to the code removing `TESTS`-blocks?

Why not use Sage for the search?

```
sage: search_src('\.\. note:[^:]')
```

Just that I didn't remember that. Thanks!

Next question: what to do for blocks that have


```
.. note:

Not indented block here.
```


? Or how to found them automatically?

Uh, I don't like Sphinx.

To find such blocks:

```
sage: search_src(r'([ ]*)\.\. note::[ ]*\n\n\1[^ ]', multiline=True)
categories/map.pyx
interfaces/r.py
rings/polynomial/pbori.pyx
```

With the `multiline=True` option, it doesn't return the line number, just the file. But it's not hard to find the offending lines. `map.pyx`:

```diff
diff --git a/src/sage/categories/map.pyx b/src/sage/categories/map.pyx
index 5fd7637..8c36b47 100644
--- a/src/sage/categories/map.pyx

`r.py`:

```diff

         s = self.eval('help("%s")'%command).strip()     # ?cmd is only an unsafe shortcut
         import sage.plot.plot
```

The last one, `pbori.pyx`, is a false positive, probably because of a mistake in my regular expression: it matches because of blocks with more than one blank line between `.. note::` and the indented block.

Thanks.

Now this one should work, at last. Sphinx seems to be very, very bad and error-prone for documentation like this. It would need much more structure and error checking.

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2016-09-26 18:17:57

I found a few more. I think that Sphinx treats any line that starts with `.. text` as a comment unless it is of the form `.. directive::`. In particular, lines like `.. note: blah` are ignored completely by Sphinx, so I fixed those.

Can you re-check this? It seems that `elliptic_curves/padic_lseries.html` contains no `NOTE`-blocks, but `btquotients/btquotient.html` is fine. I don't see why so.


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2016-09-27 17:32:47

The methods in `padic_lseries.py` which contain the `.. notes:` blocks start with an underscore, so they don't appear in the documentation. I think we should still fix the formatting.

The way prescribed by the dev guide it `.. NOTE::`. So while you're at it, could you make that change as well?

It is easier to do this first, and then later change all with a perl command, just like in #21648. (Btw, thanks for that.)

ok, looks good to me. I made one more commit about some missing accents in one of the touched files.

If you agree with my changes, you can set to positive.
