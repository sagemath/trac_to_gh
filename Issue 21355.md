CC:  @fchapoton @jhpalmieri

See for example `isogeny_graph()` on elliptic curves over the rational numbers: http://sage-doc.sis.uta.fi/reference/curves/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_rational_field.html. The note "The vertices are labeled 1 to n - -" is not shown at all. The reason is

```
.. note:
```

that should be

```
.. note::
```

According to

```
egrep -R -i '^ +\.\. note:$' src/sage
```

there are 19 files with this bug and a total of 34 lines to correct.

Just that I didn't remember that. Thanks!

Next question: what to do for blocks that have

```
.. note:

Not indented block here.
