Just a little further `configure.ac` cleanup.  This is a big chunk of code that deserves to be centralized in one place if/when further updates to it are needed.

Yes, it's just a verbatim code move--no changes otherwise.  I'm trying to make the `configure.ac` shorter and easier to read.

I believe this issue can reasonably be addressed for Sage 8.4.
