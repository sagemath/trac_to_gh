CC:  @jhpalmieri @kwankyu

We change the function `sage.misc.sagedoc.process_dollars` so it issues a deprecation warning when dollar signs are used for math markup. 

This is to provide a gentle transition for user packages that use  the Sage docbuilding machinery.


Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33973

```

A reminder: we need to change the developer's guide, coding_basics.rst:

```
In Sage's documentation LaTeX code is allowed and is marked with **backticks or
dollar signs**:

    ```x^2 + y^2 = 1``` and ``$x^2 + y^2 = 1$`` both yield `x^2 + y^2 = 1`.

```

and an example a few lines later.

Thank you very much for checking. I agree with your second suggestion. I changed the first instead to ```e = ...```: it's referring to something being printed, so it should be rendered as code, not as math.

Regarding the second, there are instances of both ``n`-th` and ``n^{th}`` in the Sage library. I would prefer `$n$th`, but Sphinx doesn't seem to handle ``n`th` correctly. In any case, I followed your suggestion.
