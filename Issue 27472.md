# Issue 27472: The attribute `_vector` of H and V representation is exposed

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27709

Original creator: jipilab

Original creation time: 2019-04-21 11:18:13

CC:  vdelecroix jhpalmieri

Keywords: polytopes

Following the sage devel thread:

https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/iHvm9wfvr5g

The following code changes the internal attributes of V and H representations:


```
sage: C = polytopes.cube()
sage: C.vertices()[0].vector()[0] = 3
sage: C.vertices()[0]
A vertex at (3, -1, -1)
```


and:


```
sage: C.inequalities()[0].A()[2] = 5
sage: C.inequalities()[0]
An inequality (0, 0, 5) x + 1 >= 0
```


As mentioned in the `__hash__` function of the file `representation.py` inside of the folder `src/sage/geometry/polyhedron/`, the attribute `_vector` is not immutable, due to the way it is constructed and its requirement to change in the current setup.

This ticket provides a small fix that creates a copy of the vectors.

As suggested, I removed the deprecation warning removal from the branch.

The failing doctest is related to that.
