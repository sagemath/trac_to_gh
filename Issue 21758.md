PoorManMap currently only implements `__eq__` but not `__hash__` nor `__neq__`.

This ticket implements `_richcmp_` and `__hash__` instead of `__eq__` and makes `__eq__` not rely on comparison of `__dict__` which does not work anymore when introducing ``@`cached_method`s in PoorManMap, see #21894.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21995
