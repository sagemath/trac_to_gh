CC:  @EmmanuelCharpentier @videlec @dimpase @isuruf @jhpalmieri @novoselt @williamstein

We reduce the unmaintained `r` package (stuck at 3.6.3) so that we detect a system installation of R but do not attempt to install it ourselves.

When found as a system package, `rpy2` will be built; otherwise it won't.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/34268

Something is going wrong with prerequisites. From `sagemath_doc_html-none.log`:

```
pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound: The 'rpy2<3.4,>=3.3' distribution was not found and is required by sagemath-standard
```

(The `rpy2` package has not yet been built — it's still in progress trying to download the tarball. Since the downloading timeouts can take a while, is there any way to tell Sage to skip the standard mirrors and just jump straight to the option given by `--enable-download-from-upstream-url`?)
