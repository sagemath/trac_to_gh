Assignee: Rebecca Lauren Miller

CC:  @bhutz

Added function to determine whether an equation is a polynomial or not by checking if it has a totally ramified fixed point. (is_polynomial)

Then used this function to create make_look_poly, which puts polynomials in the form     "x**n + a*x**(n-2) +...+c", where a and c are constants.

Needs more examples, specifically for errors.

I did some code clean-up. No functionality was changed except that instead of having to compute the inverses of the conjugation it now just computes the right one to start with.

There are still a few functionality issues: Other base rings that should work do not such as QQ


```
P.<x,y>=ProjectiveSpace(QQ,1)
H=End(P)
f=H([x^2+y^2,y^2])
f.is_polynomial()
```


I think it likely these will work for finite fields as well


```
P.<x,y>=ProjectiveSpace(GF(13),1)
H=End(P)
f=H([x^2+y^2,y^2])
f.is_polynomial()
```


Function field base rings are not going to work, but this error isn't very informative

```
R.<c>=PolynomialRing(QQ)
P.<x,y>=ProjectiveSpace(FractionField(R),1)
H=End(P)
f=H([x^2+c*y^2,y^2])
f.is_polynomial()
```



```
R.<c>=FunctionField(QQ)
P.<x,y>=ProjectiveSpace(R,1)
H=End(P)
f=H([x^2+c*y^2,y^2])
f.is_polynomial()
```


The single rational preimage check is not sufficient

```
K.<w>=QuadraticField(4/27)
P.<x,y>=ProjectiveSpace(K,1)
H=End(P)
S=P.coordinate_ring()
f=H([x^3+w*y^3,x*y^2])
f.is_polynomial()
```

Going all the way to the splitting field was causing some slow performance, so I've reworked it to manage the fields directly. This includes special casing finite fields and managing the embeddings as well.

it should be noted that a simple error in projective_morphism.conjugation() was corrected in this ticket as well as a simple error in affine_morphism.homogenize()

The new version is ready for review now.
