I'm not sure this is a bug, however it can be very misleading for users, who can spend quite some time (like me) to understand what happens:

```
sage: var('e,t')
sage: foo = exp(2*I*t)
sage: foo
e^(2*I*t)
sage: foo - e^(2*I*t)
-e^(2*I*t) + e^(2*I*t)
```

What happens is that Sage prints `exp(x)` as `e^x`.
This is fine as long as we don't declare a variable `e`:
as input, `e^x` is parsed like `exp(x)`.

But if we declare a variable `e`, then `e^x` is now parsed as this variable to the power `x`, and thus differs from the *output* of `exp(x)`, although they are printed exactly the same.

In particular if we copy/paste the output of `exp(x)`, we obtain an expression which differs!

If Sage outputs `exp(x)`, this will solve this issue.

I don't agree, especially because `e` is predefined in Sage as Euler's number:

```
sage: e^x - exp(x)
0
```

So it makes sense to print `exp(x)` as `e^x`, following standard mathematical notation (`exp(x)` looks more like a computer scientist notation to me...).
If a user redefines `e`, it is his/her responsability to manipulate it accordingly. The same thing holds for `i`, `I`, `pi`, etc.

Note also that you can have the same issue with `exp` itself, if for some reason you redefine it:

```
sage: function('exp')
exp
sage: diff(exp(x),x) - exp(x)
-exp(x) + diff(exp(x), x)
```

Another example, similar to yours:

```
sage: foo = I
sage: var('I')
I
sage: foo - I
-I + I
```

Would you try to prevent this as well?

after reading comment [comment:2], I agree with that comment. The conclusion is that we should not use `e` as a variable in Sage. I propose to resolve as "wontfix".
