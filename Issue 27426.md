Actually, this will need an independent docbuild run as the patchbot is coming back with an error on the docbuild.

The indentation in `constructions/contributions.rst` isn't correct as it stands. If you want it to be formatted like `tutorial/afterword.rst`, then you could do this:

```diff
diff --git a/src/doc/en/constructions/contributions.rst b/src/doc/en/constructions/contributions.rst
index 194e38b0ba..26a641f299 100644
--- a/src/doc/en/constructions/contributions.rst
+++ b/src/doc/en/constructions/contributions.rst
@@ -3,7 +3,7 @@ Contributions to this document
 ******************************
 
 Besides William Stein, contributions to this part of the
-documentation were made by Gary Zablackis.
+documentation were made by Gary Zablackis. ::
 
     [CF] {CF} A. Campillo and J. I. Farran, *Symbolic Hamburger-Noether
          expressions of plane curves and applications to AG codes*, Math.
```

Otherwise, I think you should revert the indentation changes in that file.

I would suggest building the old way (reverting the indentation) and also with the added double colons and see which you like better. I have a slight preference for it not to be an indented code block, because then the links are not live, but I don't care very much.
