Keywords: @fpsac2019

Implementation of class of semistandard multiset tableaux as defined by Colmenarejo, Orellana, Saliola, Schilling and Zabrocki, see https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.02071.

In the special case of semistandard set-valued tableaux as described by Monical, Pechenik and Scrimshaw, see https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03294, we implement their type A crystal structures as well.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28134
