Keywords: @fpsac2019

Implementation of class of semistandard multiset tableaux as defined by Colmenarejo, Orellana, Saliola, Schilling and Zabrocki, see https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.02071.

In the special case of semistandard set-valued tableaux as described by Monical, Pechenik and Scrimshaw, see https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03294, we implement their type A crystal structures as well.

As per our discussions, it might be better to split the two classes between between two different tickets since they will have fairly different implementations. Also, you might consider working on a `public/*` branch so you can both easily push/pull without always changing the branch `;)`.

Batch modifying tickets that will likely not be ready for 9.1, based on a review of the ticket title, branch/review status, and last modification date.
