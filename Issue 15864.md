I've rebased the branch and made a few very minor changes (almost all formatting). I'd like to review the patch, but since
- there's still a `DEBUG=True`
- I don't know much about polyhedra
that's probably not the best idea. The code looks good though.

I don't think that 600-cell is a big example; it is a 4-dimensional polytope with 120 vertices!
If about the only example the new codepath is checked on is a plane triangle, then I say no, this needs work...

Would you like me to construct this test?

Feel free to open a ticket for your feature request.

Also, even if it were fast enough for a doctest, the 600-cell would be a terrible way to test the functionality. Field arithmetic is tested elsewhere, so for *testing* you should use examples over QQ where you actually have something to compare to...

In any case, although using `QQ[phi]` helps enormously with the RAM usage, two hours of runtime still haven't produced a result for me.

However, I do believe that Volker is making a reasonable point. While it would be desirable to have a fast implementation, at least the proposed patch is adding functionality that could eventually be made faster.

absence of a sizeable example with irrational numbers suggests that there could be memory leaks which only manifest themselves on such an example; you might make the example a bit smaller by only taking the 96 vertices with irrational coordinates, constructing the [snub 24-cell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snub_24-cell).
