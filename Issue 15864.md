I don't think that 600-cell is a big example; it is a 4-dimensional polytope with 120 vertices!
If about the only example the new codepath is checked on is a plane triangle, then I say no, this needs work...

Would you like me to construct this test?

Feel free to open a ticket for your feature request.

Also, even if it were fast enough for a doctest, the 600-cell would be a terrible way to test the functionality. Field arithmetic is tested elsewhere, so for *testing* you should use examples over QQ where you actually have something to compare to...

absence of a sizeable example with irrational numbers suggests that there could be memory leaks which only manifest themselves on such an example; you might make the example a bit smaller by only taking the 96 vertices with irrational coordinates, constructing the [snub 24-cell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snub_24-cell).

How about "this is the world's fastest code for polyhedra over degree > 2 extensions". Because, as far as I know, there is nothing else. IMHO it does work great.
