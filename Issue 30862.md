CC:  @tobiasdiez @isuruf @kliem

We create a `tox` environment `local-conda-forge-environment_yml`.
In contrast to `...-standard`, it uses the file `environment*.yml` (generated by `bootstrap`) to set up the conda environment.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31099

Great questions. I hope we can add the answers in #28746 (Developer's Guide: Add instructions for sagelib development in a conda environment)

The present ticket does not change anything in this regard. It only tests that environment.yml can be used to set up some environment in which the Sage distribution can be built and tested.

`conda env create environment.yml && sage -t` does not work -- it's missing the build of Sage between the two commands!

`tox -e local-conda-forge-environment` includes that -- and it does so in an isolated install tree (`SAGE_LOCAL`) under `.tox/`
