# Issue 30862: tox.ini, GH Actions: Add test for Sage distribution on conda using environment.yml

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31099

Original creator: mkoeppe

Original creation time: 2020-12-23 00:22:03

CC:  @tobiasdiez isuruf @kliem

We create a `tox` environment `local-conda-forge-environment_yml`.
In contrast to `...-standard`, it uses the file `environment*.yml` (generated by `bootstrap`) to set up the conda environment.

Can't continue at the moment because miniforge3 on macOS seems broken at the moment

```
Miniforge3 will now be installed into this location:
/Users/mkoeppe/s/sage/sage-rebasing/worktree-algebraic-2018-spring/.tox/local-conda-forge-environment_yml/conda

  - Press ENTER to confirm the location
  - Press CTRL-C to abort the installation
  - Or specify a different location below

[/Users/mkoeppe/s/sage/sage-rebasing/worktree-algebraic-2018-spring/.tox/local-conda-forge-environment_yml/conda] >>> 
PREFIX=/Users/mkoeppe/s/sage/sage-rebasing/worktree-algebraic-2018-spring/.tox/local-conda-forge-environment_yml/conda

```

No matter what I answer to this promptless question, it aborts

Figured out what was wrong: This was caused by having a `.condarc` that only defines `pkg_dirs` but no `channels`.

The title says something about github actions. Do you still plan to do this in this ticket, or is the new local-conda-environment_yml automatically executed? 
(by the way, is the yml part of `local-conda-environment_yml` really necessary? this is hard to remember/write)

So what is the new workflow now with these changes? How do I now create a conda environment with a given name in a given location with the sage dependencies installed, and activate this env later and run say the doctests? Similarly, say I've created a conda env myself and activated it. How can I now install the sage dependencies and run tests/lints using tox in this env?

For the part `-n {env:CONDA_SAGE_ENVIRONMENT}`, the github action or conda itself (?) issued warnings if the name of the environment was different to what was specified in the `environment.yml`. In either case, I think the default should be what is specfied in the environment.yml, which I think is `sage-build`.

Great questions. I hope we can add the answers in #28746 (Developer's Guide: Add instructions for sagelib development in a conda environment)

The present ticket does not change anything in this regard. It only tests that environment.yml can be used to set up some environment in which the Sage distribution can be built and tested.

By the way, when you have a chance, could you continue the review of #30940 (or indicate that another reviewer is needed)? It's an indirect prerequisite of this ticket.

I thought the point of using tox in order to manage the conda was to make sure that locally a developer can easily work in a similar way to what is tested on the CI. These question arose because I have trouble understanding how this interplay now works. Ok, I can now run `tox -e local-conda-forge-environment` but what is the advantage of this over `conda env create environment.yml && sage -t` ?

That's right.

`conda env create environment.yml && sage -t` does not work -- it's missing the build of Sage between the two commands!

`tox -e local-conda-forge-environment` includes that -- and it does so in an isolated install tree (`SAGE_LOCAL`) under `.tox/`

does this need anything from Conda to begin with, or it takes care even of installing Conda?


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2021-03-04 13:34:58

Oh, I see, it seems to be setting everything up... Thus, also a new way to install Sage, all you need is source tree and tox, no?


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2021-03-04 13:39:33

Seems that building is done single-thread for some reason. I.e.

```
make --no-print-directory all-sage
```

is only using one core. Is it on purpose?

All of the `local` tox environments pass on the `MAKE` variable. If you want to build in parallel, use `export MAKE="make -j16"`.

On this ticket, the only change to the existing `tox -e local-conda-forge-standard` is that using the environment files is tested, instead of using `conda install PACKAGES....`

lgtm

I tested these locally on Linux, looks good. Further fixes might be added later.
