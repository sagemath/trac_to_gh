# Issue 13138: `:trac:` links are broken

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13310

Original creator: ppurka

Original creation time: 2012-07-31 12:02:40

Assignee: mvngu

Keywords: trac keyword

Two issues:
1. The use of `:trac:`<number>`` is broken on the command line. The second link below shouldn't repeat the ticket number of the first one

```
sage: integral?
<removed earlier text>
       TESTS:

       A symbolic integral from http://trac.sagemath.org/11445 that was
       incorrect in earlier versions of Maxima:

          sage: f = abs(x - 1) + abs(x + 1) - 2*abs(x)
          sage: integrate(f, (x, -Infinity, Infinity))
          2

       Another symbolic integral, from http://trac.sagemath.org/11445,
       that used to return zero incorrectly:

          sage: f = exp(-x) * sinh(sqrt(x))
          sage: integrate(f, x, 0, Infinity)
          1/2*sqrt(pi)*e^(1/4)
```

2. The link in the notebook is actually correct (that is I get the correct ticket number in the second URL), but it should open the documentation in a _new tab_. Otherwise, there is a huge potential of someone losing all their work just because they forgot to shift-click or something.

#13116 fixed trac tickets in docstrings for command line, but I think it wasn't fixed properly. The problem exists at least as far back as sage-5.1.rc0.

Changing status from new to needs_review.

I think that these are two completely separate issue, and deserve completely separate tickets. In fact, issue 2 is really an issue with the notebook, so should be dealt with [upstream](https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb). I'm attaching a patch for issue 1.

(By the way, I think that the sagenb issue could be fixed by patching the "sphinxify" function, but it should be done at the sagenb github site, not here.)

This works. Thanks. Issue 2 is [reported upstream](https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/issues/90).

Hmm... the patch does not end with the correct extension, hopefully it is not a problem.

patchbot apply trac_13310-trac.pach

It shouldn't be a problem, but just in case...
