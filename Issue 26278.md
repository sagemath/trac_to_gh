Keywords: py3, graph

Done in this ticket:
- simplify method `plot` using `_line_embedding`
- avoid some sorting of edge vertices that were not necessary
- fix method `save_afile` that was working only for bipartite graphs with vertices labeled in `[0..n-1]` and with `left = [0..|left|-1]`. Obviously, due to the file format, we can only ensure that the graph stored in the file is isomorphic to the original graph.
- remove helper method `__edge2idx` using a mapping in `reduced_adjacency_matrix`. This is faster than constantly searching for the index of a vertex in a list
- cleaning (PEP8)

Remaining sorting operations on sets of vertex labels:
- 2 in `plot` used to order vertices in each side of the partition.
- 2 in reduced_adjacency_matrix`. We can remove these sort operations if we agree that the returned matrix M encodes a bipartite graph that is isomorphic to the original bipartite graph. I'm in favor of this change

To be discussed:
- parameter `in_order` of method `delete_vertex` enables to delete the ith vertex of `G.vertices()`. Is this useful ?

The `in_order` might be useful if there is a specified ordering on the vertices but you do not want to explicitly deal with the labels. Personally, I don't think it is so useful, but I am guessing someone did, so I would just leave it.
