# Issue 20478: is_numpy_type(object) crashes Sage

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20715

Original creator: jdemeyer

Segfault Sage in 10 characters:

```
sage: 1+object()
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* module has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off().
Python will now terminate.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
```


The reason:

```
sage: from sage.structure.coerce import is_numpy_type
sage: is_numpy_type(object)
```

The thing is that `tp_base` is `NULL` in that case.
