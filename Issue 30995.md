I just came across this ticket and have one small suggestion for follow-up tickets concerning typing:

```
PP = NewType('PP', 'PlanePartition')
def random_element(self) -> PP:
```

Was the point of introducing PP as a new type was to prevent import problems? This can also be accomplished by specifying the type as a string:

```
def random_element(self) -> 'PlanePartition':
```

Once we drop python 3.6 support, one can also import annotations from future, which does this automatically so that the following works: 

```
from __future__ import annotations
def random_element(self) -> PlanePartition:
```

I think one shouldn't use abbreviations at all here. Just makes the code harder to understand, especially for new developers not familiar with this part of the code base (in the above context: what is PP?). It's similar to naming of variables: try to avoid abbreviations, the few additional keystrokes are worth it for enhanced readability. Moreover, most IDEs provide a good autocompletion.
