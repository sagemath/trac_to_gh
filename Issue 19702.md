I indered pondered about this. I went for using `r.is_zero()` for
style consistency with the nearby zero tests. But I don't have a
strong opinion, and I am fine switching to `if r`. In that case, maybe
the nearby zero tests should be changed accordingly for
consistency. What do you think?

By the way: I looked at the current tests failure. They are due to the
default implementation of `quo_rem` for `Fields` which return a plain
`0` for the remainder instead of the zero of the field:


```
    sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^3 - 2); K
    Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^3 - 2
    sage: y = K.an_element()
    sage: y.parent()
    Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^3 - 2
    sage: q,r = y.quo_rem(y-1)
    sage: q,r
    sage: parent(q)               # OK
    Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^3 - 2
    sage: type(r)                 # GASP!!!
    <type 'int'>
```

I am going to handle this right now by:

1. Updating `EuclideanRings.ParentMethods._test_quo_rem` to test for this
2. Fixing the default implementation of quo_rem

`FieldElement.quo_rem` almost duplicates `Fields.ElementMethods.quo_rem`, with the same bug of returning a plain zero, but with the additional feature of doing coercion on rem.

Do you see any situation where this method could be time critical, or should I just remove `FieldElement.quo_rem` (and move up the coercion feature)?

Thinking twice about it: this `_test_method` is going to be run just once for each parent, so speed is not an issue here. Besides `is_zero` is more explicit for the reader, especially for new developers who may stumble upon this while learning to implement an EuclideanRing.

Changing all `is_zero` consistently can be done in a later ticket, if someone cares.

Thanks for your feedback though!
