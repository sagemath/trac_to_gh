(What's the procedure for upgrading these?)

I've successfully replaced the 'src' directory in the current maxima-5.23.2.p2.spkg with the tarball from 5.24.0. All tests pass with one small exception; fix included.

This will fix #11591, and prevent a regression in the fix for #11483.

Hmm, but isn't the latest Maxima 5.25.1?  Just wondering.

----

The procedure for upgrading is as follows.
* Create new spkg for the upgrade as in the [developer's guide](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/).
* Make sure that you've upgraded SPKG.txt, checked in any changes etc.
* Post a link to the spkg here and in the description to the ticket.  (You can use an account at sage.math, or [spkg-upload at Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/spkg-upload/).)
* Tell us anything else we need to know!
* After review (probably on a few platforms) the new spkg will be incorporated by the release manager.

Sure. In sage/calculus/desolvers.py, we have,


```
sage: y=function('y',x); assume(x>0); assume(y>0)                       
sage: desolve(x*diff(y,x)-x*sqrt(y^2+x^2)-y == 0, y, contrib_ode=True)
[x - arcsinh(y(x)/x) == c]
```


Instead of that nice (confirmed correct) result, I was getting back a much larger expression. I tested in the Maxima console, and it was returning the correct answer, as expected above. However, that wasn't coming back out to sage.

I didn't test with 5.25.0. There was some other general shuffling about of terms in doctest results, and I thought it best to compartmentalize the damage since this is my first time touching any of this code.

Wow!  That is really baffling.

Here's the best I could do.

```
sage: F.expand_log().simplify_full().expand()
x + 1/2*log(x^2 + 2*y(x)^2 + 2*sqrt(x^2 + y(x)^2)*y(x)) + log(2/x) - arcsinh(abs(y(x))/x) - arcsinh(y(x)/x)
```

Probably this just differs by a constant - though this is after assuming positive things and still there is the abs in there.

There will be a number of people needing easy bugfixes at Sage Days 35.5, but I don't know how many of the many symbolics tickets with "fixed upstream" are in fixed in 5.24, how many in 5.25, etc.

Okay, here is something we should do.

```

 * TODO:
   Is the `spkg-dist` script still needed, i.e., does anybody run
   this after upgrading the upstream source tree?
   (It deletes the stuff in some language directories, `src/doc/info/*/`,
   and creates dummy `Makefile.in`s, but apparently nobody has run it on
   the recent Maxima spkgs.)
```

This was added by Leif to SPKG.txt, and I think it's a good point.  To wit:

```
$ du -h -c
<snip>
110M	total
$ ./spkg-dist 
rm -rf "src/doc/info/es/"*
rm -rf "src/doc/info/es.utf8/"*
rm -rf "src/doc/info/pt/"*
rm -rf "src/doc/info/pt.utf8/"*
rm -rf "src/doc/info/pt_BR/"*
rm -rf "src/doc/info/pt_BR.utf8/"*
$ du -h -c
<snip>
 64M	total
```

Also, we can add to

```
for X in ['es', 'es.utf8', 'pt', 'pt.utf8', 'pt_BR', 'pt_BR.utf8']:
```

by doing

```
for X in ['de', 'de.utf8', 'es', 'es.utf8', 'pt', 'pt.utf8', 'pt_BR', 'pt_BR.utf8']:
```

What do people think?

Otherwise, I don't foresee any problems here; it works, and I'm running tests on OS X 10.6 currently.  If that goes well, I'll try it on sage.math and perhaps call it a day?

> *Do* be sure to update that script spkg-dist and apply it (and commit it in hg), then test again to make sure it still builds; that will save at least a few MB compressed, I suspect.

Updated, committed, and applied. I added the extra directories that you suggested, and removed an unused import (time).

I also fixed the double negative, and updated SPKG.txt to be more clear about running spkg-dist.

By the way, using [spkg-upload](http://code.google.com/p/spkg-upload/) or getting an account on sage.math might lead to much faster download speeds for this spkg :)   It does take a while.
