# Issue 18478: Move fixed part of build/Makefile to build/deps

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2015-06-16 18:27:21

The build rules (not the actual files) for the scripts and extcode targets are "auto-generated" but they are really just one fixed block. Move this to `build/deps` instead.
