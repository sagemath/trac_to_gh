I don't know what line 1265 in `programmation.tex` is suppose to be illustrating, but I think a better test would be:

```
sage: ' + '.join(str(k) for k in [1..10])
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10
```

Ok, done. In fact, changing the tests for the French book in this way is not really satisfactory. Given the recent discussion in sage-devel, the change to py3 syntax for print
is not going to happen soon.
