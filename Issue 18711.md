This ticket implements a new module names `strongly_regular_db` that lets us build one example of strongly regular graph, given four integer parametes (v,k,lambda,mu).

It uses Andries Brouwer's database to return more meaningful non-existence results, and help us find which constructions are missing from the database.

With a bit of luck (and time, and work) it would be great if we could reproduce all SRG that are known to exist!

The module has a simple structure:

has a simple structure:

- A `seems_feasible(v,k,l,mu)` function that performs the basic artihmetic
  checks to figure out if `(v,k,l,mu)` is realizable. The
  'apparently_feasible_parameters(n)` returns the lists of all parameters that
  pass these tests for v<n. When n=1301, the set of parameters it returns is
  precisely those that appear on your database (this is checked in the code).

- Several functions (is_paley, is_johnson, ...) test if a given set of
  parameters (v,k,l,mu) can be realized with a graph of the corresponding family
  (a Paley graph, a Johnson graph, ...). If they can, they return the parameters
  of that graph so that it can be built easily.

- The main function `strongly_regular_graph` can be called in two ways:

  - `strongly_regular_graph(v,k,l,mu,existence=True)` answers True if such a
    graph is known to exists, False if it is known to be infeasible, and Unknown
    otherwise.

  - `strongly_regular_graph(v,k,l,mu)` attempts to build and return the
    requested graph, and returns a meaningful exception if it cannot.

This branch also updates the package 'graphs', which now ships the database in json format.

To me your phrasing also sounds incorrect, as it seems to test whether "every (v,k,l,mu)-strongly regular graph is a Paley graph".

What about replacing 'a' by 'some'?

```
Test if some Paley graph is (v,k,l,mu)-strongly regular

How about functions like `is_paley()`? They also do not need `mu`...

By the way, what is the point of doing `return (lambda q : PaleyGraph(q),v)` instead of

If you think that this feature would be useful, I have nothing against your adding it in another ticket. I do not see the point, as those functions are not even meant to be called directly by users, who can do so with 'strongly_regular_graph' (which can automatically guess 'mu' if needed).

That's in order to be able to tell if the construction *can* be done without doing it (which can take quite some time). Very useful to know which entries Sage can build to compare it to the list of those that are known to exist. I used a design similar to the one used in `sage.combinat.designs.orthogonal_arrays_find_construction`, where many functions exist to *guess* the parameters of some constructions (exactly like it is done here). With these design, knowing if something can be built and getting the data to build it is done in the same operation. There are two advantages:

1) No need of a 'exists=True' optional keyword when you call the function
2) No 'if exists' everywhere in the code's function, to return 'True' instead of returning the graph
3) If you want to test the existence, THEN build the graph, you do not call the function twice with different parameters (which would not use the function's cache, and so you compute the decomposition twice).

Admittedly, the functions of the design code are computationally much more expensive than those.

> There is something wrong with this branch, it doctests implementation details instead of mathematical truths.

Wow. I could remove 50% of Sage's doctests with a rule like that.

> Hence it is so fragile that even you yourself can't avoid breaking it. You can take care of the problem here or in a subsequent ticket, I don't care which.

Excellent. Then if you agree that rewriting the dependencies of 3 stacked tickets is a bad idea, then I chose to do it later.

The doctest counts the number of graphs that we are not able to build automatically. These doctests are very precious, and there are many like that in the combinat.design folder already. It is admittedly a mess during the early stages of the implementation, especially when you forget (as I did) to order everything linearly from the beginning.

When tickets will start getting merged it will become easier. Here my trouble today was with #18934, which is "not in a release beta" but "already closed". If not for that, I would have moved it atop of the others, and there would have been no work involved.

Well as long as you are only hurting yourself good luck with that. Of course you could alternatively run your own doctests before having #18988 reviewed, that would also avoid test failures.

Just set this ticket back to positive review once you have fixed #18988 or wherever you want to address it.

Easy: you add constructions of strongly regular graphs.

Given that you add constructions, the final number changes, and the doctest breaks.
