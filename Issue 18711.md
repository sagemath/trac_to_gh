# Issue 18711: Strongly Regular Graphs database

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18948

Original creator: ncohen

Original creation time: 2015-07-24 16:42:31

CC:  dimpase

This ticket implements a new module names `strongly_regular_db` that lets us build one example of strongly regular graph, given four integer parametes (v,k,lambda,mu).

It uses Andries Brouwer's database to return more meaningful non-existence results, and help us find which constructions are missing from the database.

With a bit of luck (and time, and work) it would be great if we could reproduce all SRG that are known to exist!

The module has a simple structure:

has a simple structure:

- A `seems_feasible(v,k,l,mu)` function that performs the basic artihmetic
  checks to figure out if `(v,k,l,mu)` is realizable. The
  'apparently_feasible_parameters(n)` returns the lists of all parameters that
  pass these tests for v<n. When n=1301, the set of parameters it returns is
  precisely those that appear on your database (this is checked in the code).

- Several functions (is_paley, is_johnson, ...) test if a given set of
  parameters (v,k,l,mu) can be realized with a graph of the corresponding family
  (a Paley graph, a Johnson graph, ...). If they can, they return the parameters
  of that graph so that it can be built easily.

- The main function `strongly_regular_graph` can be called in two ways:

  - `strongly_regular_graph(v,k,l,mu,existence=True)` answers True if such a
    graph is known to exists, False if it is known to be infeasible, and Unknown
    otherwise.

  - `strongly_regular_graph(v,k,l,mu)` attempts to build and return the
    requested graph, and returns a meaningful exception if it cannot.

This branch also updates the package 'graphs', which now ships the database in json format.

I think you do not need to edit module_list.py file anymore when there is no dependencies. See #15410.

I removed it and all doctests break because of an import problem. As I do not mind much either way personally, I leave it like that.

this comment landed on the wrong ticket (#18960), sorry:

```
Test if a Paley graph is `(v,k,\lambda,\mu)`-strongly regular.
```

Huh? Do you mean 

```
Test whether a  `(v,k,\lambda,\mu)`-strongly regular graph is Paley.
```


All the similar docstrings have the same problem. Namely, one tests that a (v,k,l,m)-srg is `BlahBlah`, not the other way around...

To me your phrasing also sounds incorrect, as it seems to test whether "every (v,k,l,mu)-strongly regular graph is a Paley graph".

What about replacing 'a' by 'some'?

```
Test if some Paley graph is (v,k,l,mu)-strongly regular
```

Do you really want to keep mu as a required by functions parameter? I would rather get rid of it, for it is a simple computation to find mu given the 1st three parameters.

I prefer to keep it, for it belongs to the definition of strongly regular graphs. I don't see anything wrong it making it optional: we can replace 'None' by the computed value if necessary.

How about functions like `is_paley()`? They also do not need `mu`...

By the way, what is the point of doing `return (lambda q : PaleyGraph(q),v)` instead of
`return PaleyGraph(v)` ?

> How about functions like `is_paley()`? They also do not need `mu`...

If you think that this feature would be useful, I have nothing against your adding it in another ticket. I do not see the point, as those functions are not even meant to be called directly by users, who can do so with 'strongly_regular_graph' (which can automatically guess 'mu' if needed).

> By the way, what is the point of doing `return (lambda q : PaleyGraph(q),v)` instead of
> `return PaleyGraph(v)` ?

That's in order to be able to tell if the construction *can* be done without doing it (which can take quite some time). Very useful to know which entries Sage can build to compare it to the list of those that are known to exist. I used a design similar to the one used in `sage.combinat.designs.orthogonal_arrays_find_construction`, where many functions exist to *guess* the parameters of some constructions (exactly like it is done here). With these design, knowing if something can be built and getting the data to build it is done in the same operation. There are two advantages:

1) No need of a 'exists=True' optional keyword when you call the function
2) No 'if exists' everywhere in the code's function, to return 'True' instead of returning the graph
3) If you want to test the existence, THEN build the graph, you do not call the function twice with different parameters (which would not use the function's cache, and so you compute the decomposition twice).

Admittedly, the functions of the design code are computationally much more expensive than those.

it seems that

```
cdef eigenvalues(int v,int k,int l,int mu)
```

only returns correct results for the non-Paley (non-conference) case (i.e. the case where the eigenvalues are not integer).

This should be documented, at least.

there are easy to implement necessary conditions on parameters which don't seem to be there,  e.g. Krein conditions, absolute bound, etc; see 9.1.8 in http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/2WF02/spectra.pdf


I don't mind them to be added in a follow-up ticket, but it has to be done, I think.

I know, I already have plans for that. I planned to do it after #18960.

This ticket has only one dependency, i.e. #18934. You must be confused.


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2015-08-05 08:04:59

The dependency is fine. But when I merge this ticket and then #18988 and #18960 on top of this ticket then tests fail.


---

Comment by ncohen created at 2015-08-05 08:05:54

I don't know what exactly you are doing, but unless there is something wrong with this branch as it is, please set it back to `positive_review`.


---

Comment by ncohen created at 2015-08-05 08:09:51

By the way, all 'merge' operations that you may perform between those three tickets should result in a 'fast-forward', as they are all linearly ordered.


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2015-08-05 08:10:19

There is something wrong with this branch, it doctests implementation details instead of mathematical truths. Hence it is so fragile that even you yourself can't avoid breaking it. You can take care of the problem here or in a subsequent ticket, I don't care which.


---

Comment by ncohen created at 2015-08-05 08:14:36

> There is something wrong with this branch, it doctests implementation details instead of mathematical truths.

Wow. I could remove 50% of Sage's doctests with a rule like that.

> Hence it is so fragile that even you yourself can't avoid breaking it. You can take care of the problem here or in a subsequent ticket, I don't care which.

Excellent. Then if you agree that rewriting the dependencies of 3 stacked tickets is a bad idea, then I chose to do it later.

The doctest counts the number of graphs that we are not able to build automatically. These doctests are very precious, and there are many like that in the combinat.design folder already. It is admittedly a mess during the early stages of the implementation, especially when you forget (as I did) to order everything linearly from the beginning.

When tickets will start getting merged it will become easier. Here my trouble today was with #18934, which is "not in a release beta" but "already closed". If not for that, I would have moved it atop of the others, and there would have been no work involved.

Well as long as you are only hurting yourself good luck with that. Of course you could alternatively run your own doctests before having #18988 reviewed, that would also avoid test failures.

Just set this ticket back to positive review once you have fixed #18988 or wherever you want to address it.

Scuse me, can you show me this 'doctest failure' you mention? I do not see it. I load the branch, I run the tests, they pass. Something different happens on your computer?

Then the answer is in your git log: there are commits from #18972 in your history, which have nothing to do there.

They do. Have you found a proof of the contrary? You do not even have to merge them, they are linearly ordered already.

These commits should not affect the outcome, or at least I don't see how they can.
Or, if you like, I have weird test failures on my branch due to something in your already reviewed tickets...

Easy: you add constructions of strongly regular graphs. The only thing this doctest does is check the *COUNT* of them (note that the individual lines naming each graph are not check, except the first, because of '...'). Given that you add constructions, the final number changes, and the doctest breaks.

> Or, if you like, I have weird test failures on my branch due to something in your already reviewed tickets...

Just load *ONLY* the branch, and you will not have any problem. If you add other commits, now, I can do no magic.

If you read his 'history' file you will see that he tested more commits than that. He also had some commits of hiw own patch (#18972) in his history. If you load only the branch on my tickets things work, but you can't expect me to fix in my branches the errors introduced on non-reviewed tickets. The only thing that it proves is that #18972 needs to be rebased on #18988. And that's clearly not my job.

Oh hell... How about we add a special tag (say, countexamples) to these counting test(s), so that they don't normally run.

The problem is that nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition hitting on your tests this way. Doctesting such counts is akin to doctesting number of Sage tests that pass...

Regardless of that, the doctests pass, in this ticket and in those above.

> The buildbot always merges dependencies first; Currently I'm at

So that is your explanation. Yesterday, or that night, you ran the doctests on a version of Sage which included #18934. This branch, at that time, did not have #18934 as a dependency. This morning, I rebased this ticket (and those above) over #18934, and I fixed it. So now it should work, because of this rebasing. So unless you find something wrong with this branch, please set it back to its original status.

If we do it now, I will have to re-merge 3 linearly ordered patches again.  So let's do that later.

Can you do this on #18988, or whatever ticket that has the latest commits in this chain?

Yeah yeah. I'm against it, but after having been complaining pointlessly for 30 minutes on a ticket because you were all testing something different from the branch stored on this ticket, I won't even bother trying to explain.

Easier to blame the doctest, of course.

Let's create another ticket for that. It's unrelated to the topic of #18988..

So? Are you now convinced that there is no broken doctest in this ticket, and that it can be set back to its original status ?

I'm not necessarily convinced but I can try again... hopefully I'll get through a testing cycle before the branch changes again ;-)

Changing status from needs_work to positive_review.

Yeah, sorry for that. I should have remembered to keep such tickets in a linear order at all times.
