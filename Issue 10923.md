Assignee: tbd

This patch provides an implementation of the subword complex:

Fix a Coxeter system (W,S). Let Q = be a finite word in S and pi in W.

The subword complex Delta(Q,pi) is then defined to be the simplicial complex with vertices being {0,...,n-1}, (n = len(Q), one vertex for each letter in Q) and with facets given by all (indices of) subwords Q' of Q for which Q\Q' is a reduced expression for pi.


```
    sage: W = CoxeterGroup(['A',2])
    sage: w = W.from_reduced_word([1,2,1])
    sage: C = SubwordComplex([2,1,2,1,2],w); C
    Subword complex of type ['A', 2] for Q = [2, 1, 2, 1, 2] and pi = [1, 2, 1]
    sage: C.facets()
    {(1, 2), (3, 4), (0, 4), (2, 3), (0, 1)}
```


depends on Ticket #8359.

I will upload the patch as soon as the patch on Coxeter groups is ready.

Hello Christian, do you really think that this ticket depends on #11187 ?

I am tempted to ressurect this one, without waiting for the famous category-and-axiom ticket.

With not so much work, I managed to get a branch with only 19 failures.

Dear Frederic,

Thanks for your work on that -- I am super busy with other stuff, hopefully this will get better in about 4 weeks from now.

I am not sure if I/we should keep the construction for positive genus:
- Mathematically, this has not been considered before,

- it is not quite the right generalization of subword complexes as defined by Knutson-Miller. In particular, such complexes do not need to be vertex-decomposable or shellable.

- we have a proper generalization which will have similar combinatorics and will capture the needed behaviour for positive genus

- our paper in which I introduce these things is still on hold and we will need at least another 3-6 months before getting this into a state to make it publicly available

I should be able to quickly look at your branch during the weekend to clean things up a bit. Or do you prefer to work things out yourself?

Cheers, Christian

Hello Christian,

I would be happy to see you come back here. The code is not very easy to understand by me alone.

The remaining issues (15 doctests) seem to be related to a strange use of roots, where Weyl group elements seem to be supposed to act on the indices of roots in the list of roots. And they do not, of course.

I will not do anything more on the ticket until next week.

Hi,

I spend some time today trying to get Sage working properly again, but I failed so far. I guess I need someone helping me to work properly with git...

* I upgraded Sage using http://wiki.sagemath.org/TentativeConventions#Get_the_latest_official_development_version_of_Sage, but I got an error ```error: command 'gcc' failed with exit status```, so this is my first problem

I don't know how to resolve that now (and I also don't know if I tried to upgrade to the newest development version or the latest stable version).

> The remaining issues (15 doctests) seem to be related to a strange use of roots, where Weyl group elements seem to be supposed to act on the indices of roots in the list of roots. And they do not, of course.

I use the CHEVIE implementation of finite reflection groups which are implemented as permutation groups on indices of roots. This speed things drastically, but it is not reall mathematically clean. Moreover, I just looked at the code, and

* I also pushed many non-features that are there only for my research (and for which I cannot prove what I want to prove)
* Many features only make sense for finite Coxeter groups, so such checks are still to be implemented.

Hello Frederic,

I now spent some time playing with the patch.

My main concern is: I can re-implement things to work with any implementation of Coxeter groups (i.e., with the current implementations of Weyl groups and Coxeter groups). BUT: this will slow down things drastically!

So we either leave this ticket open and wait for my CHEVIE version of Coxeter groups, 
#11187 (I am not too positive that these will make it into Sage this year though), or we get rid of the speedy implementations and have a slow version to play in very low ranks that can be used soon.

Cheers, Christian

I have made a new branch, by disentangling u/vpilaud/ticket/11010 from #11187 (but sadly still depending on #11187).

Sorry for having been a little rude. I was tired and angry yesterday evening.

It remains that I have done twice the same clean-up work. I think it was
because the branch by Vincent was not based on my previous branch.

I would really like if this ticket would no longer depend on #11187, which has
no hope to enter sage as long as it depends on gap3.

You said once that it could be possible, but with a high speed penalty. Maybe this is nevertheless the way to go.

As far as I can see, just one thing is needed:

- `reflections()` (technically `nr_reflections()`, but we can just do `len(self.reflections())`)

We can construct this easily enough by conjugation of simple reflections:

```
sage: W = CoxeterGroup(['A',2])
sage: S = W.simple_reflections()
sage: I = W.index_set()
sage: R = RecursivelyEnumeratedSet(S, lambda x: [S[i]*x*S[i] for i in I if not x.has_descent(i)], structure="graded")
sage: list(R)
[
[-1  1]  [ 1  0]  [ 0 -1]
[ 0  1], [ 1 -1], [-1  0]
]
sage: all(x.absolute_length() for x in R)
True
```


The `apply_simple_reflection` is already a part of Sage for Coxeter groups.

Aside - This probably deserves to be in the category of finite Coxeter groups, but there is some slight conflict with this

```
sage: W = WeylGroup(['A',2], prefix='s')
sage: W.reflections()
Finite family {s1*s2*s1: (1, 0, -1), s1: (1, -1, 0), s2: (0, 1, -1)}
```

(Trying to do this on the Weyl group on the root system seems to run forever and `ctrl-C` out results in a nasty error message.)

Ok, guys. We are **almost there**. Most of the things are working and hopefully not too slow. I have worked hard for two days, so please react !

Just 2 small remaining problems (unless the bot reveals some others):

* the "plot" code is broken, maybe we can remove that for the moment ? unless somebody wants to repair it ?
* the "root_polytope" method is not documented, any objection to its removal ? unless you can provide a working example ?

cheers,

Frederic

I think one should put a large **Warning** about

`To be used only with Coxeter groups in the implementation='reflection'`

In fact, it is not only slow but mostly broken with Weyl groups.

Side remark : it seems that one cannot use the quadratic fields Q(sqrt2) for type B
and Q(sqrt5) for type H. To be fixed in another ticket, maybe.

Oh yes, the doctests were written for `implementation='reflection'` so it does not show that it is broken for Weyl groups.

You can use the (relatively recent) Coxeter matrices and types:

```
sage: W = CoxeterGroup(['C',4])
sage: T = W.coxeter_matrix().coxeter_type(); T
Coxeter type of ['C', 4]
```

However, the information you're after is inside the wrapped type:

```
sage: T.cartan_type()
['B', 4]
sage: T.cartan_type().type()

I am rather confused now:
* First Sage start

```
sage: W = CoxeterGroup(['B',4])
sage: W.coxeter_matrix().coxeter_type()
Coxeter type of ['B', 4]
sage: W = CoxeterGroup(['C',4])
sage: W.coxeter_matrix().coxeter_type()
Coxeter type of ['B', 4]
```

* Second Sage start

```
sage: W = CoxeterGroup(['C',4])
sage: W.coxeter_matrix().coxeter_type()
Coxeter type of ['C', 4]
sage: W = CoxeterGroup(['B',4])
sage: W.coxeter_matrix().coxeter_type()
Coxeter type of ['C', 4]
```

In particular, the root systems `W.roots()` are not correct in the two second calls of `CoxeterGroup`.

Also, the plotting now assumes that the first index is the type B/C special one. This is, it is expected that

```
sage: s0 = W.simple_reflection(W.index-set()[0])
sage: s1 = W.simple_reflection(W.index-set()[1])
sage: (s0*s1).order()
4
```

I doubt that this is correct in the current implementation of `Coxeter groups` where the last index is expected to be special. If so, I will add some magic to figure out the proper labelling...

Not quite, I wanted to add a few more doctests for the type B plotting with various indexing sets. But then saw that the indexing in `CoxeterGroup` is corrupted, see #19830. This is another issue, but I still want to add more examples/testing.

ok, good enough for me.

I have made two minor doc changes, and now set this again to positive review.

Any further changes will have to be in another ticket.
