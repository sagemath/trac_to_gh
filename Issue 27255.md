Keywords: parallelization, symbolic functions

As reported in this [sage-devel post](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/k4W5eo4nQ50), Sage fails silently on some parallelized computations involving symbolic functions. A minimal example with 
Sage 8.7.beta7 (**python2** version) is

```
sage: Parallelism().set(nproc=2)
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M')
sage: X.<x,y> = M.chart()
sage: a = function('f')(x)
sage: t = M.tensor_field(0, 2)
sage: t[0,0], t[0,1], t[1,1] = a, x+y, x-y
sage: v = M.vector_field()
sage: v[0], v[1] = 1 + x*y, -x^2
sage: s = t.contract(v)  # parallelized computation occurs here
sage: s0 = s[0].expr(); s0  # symbolic expression OK
-x^3 - (x^2 - x*f(x))*y + f(x)
sage: s0.coefficient(a, 1)  # incorrect output
0
```

The correct result should be `x*y + 1`. The latter is obtained if one sets `nproc=1` in the first line (i.e. no parallelization). Furthermore, if one replaces the line

```
sage: a = function('f')(x)
```

by 

```
sage: a = sin(x)
```

one gets a correct result as well.

With the **python3** version of Sage 8.7.beta7, one does not get a silent failure but an error message when the parallel computation is performed, i.e. at the line `s = t.contract(v)`: 

```
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
/home/eric/sage/py3/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/sage/symbolic/function_factory.py in function_factory(name, nargs, latex_name, conversions, evalf_params_first, eval_func, evalf_func, conjugate_func, real_part_func, imag_part_func, derivative_func, tderivative_func, power_func, series_func, print_func, print_latex_func)
    109             setattr(NewSymbolicFunction, '_%s_'%func_name, func)
    110 
--> 111     return NewSymbolicFunction()
    112 
    113 
...
TypeError: expected str, bytes found
```

The full error message is attached.

To help you along with this: it's probably a matter that the existence of the symbolic function 'f' isn't properly coordinated across the inter-process communication, so that a new symbolic function, also called 'f' is created at some point:

```
sage: a_new=s0.operands()[2]
sage: a
f(x)
sage: a_new
f(x)
sage: a - a
0
sage: a - a_new #this indicates something fishy
-f(x) + f(x)
sage: bool( a==a_new)
True
sage: s0.subs({a_new: a})
-x^3 - (x^2 - x*f(x))*y + f(x)
sage: s0.subs({a_new: a}).coefficient(a,1)
x*y + 1
```

If may pickling that's (part of) the problem:

```
sage: function('f')(x)-function('f')(x)
0
sage: function('f')(x)-SR('f(x)')
0
sage: loads(dumps(SR('f(x)')))-SR('f(x)')
0
sage: function('f')(x)-SR('f(x)')
f(x) - f(x)
sage: loads(dumps(function('f')(x)))-function('f')(x)
-f(x) + f(x)
sage: loads(dumps(function('f')(x)))-SR('f(x)')
0
```

as you can see, the different ways of creating a symbolic function start out as giving the same result. However, as soon as pickling has been involved, something changes, and results are not compatible any more. from that point onwards, `SR('f(x)')` seems to produce results consistent with pickling, but `function('f')(x)` is reliably not compatible (and in fact, further investigation shows that `function('f')(x)` across different invocations of pickle returns unidentical results. So there's some naste cache wiping/corruption going on somewhere.

You can see part of it here:

```
sage: explain_pickle(dumps(function('f')(x)))
pg_Expression = unpickle_global('sage.symbolic.expression', 'Expression')
si = unpickle_newobj(pg_Expression, ())
unpickle_build(si, (0r, ['x'], 'GARC\x03\tfunction\x00class\x00symbol\x00x\x00name\x00seq\x00python\x00f\x00sage_ex\x00\x01\x08\x01\x02\x02\n\x02"\x03\x04\n\x00+\x001\x00"\x07'))
si
```

As you can see, there's a rather opague string involved.

Well, there are lots of libraries involved in symbolics, so lots of questions.

I guess the first question to ask is whether the parallelization that you use involves several threads in one process, or several processes.

The reported error comes from Maxima, which runs in ECL. Is ECL prepared and configured for threadsafe operation? Are the parts of Maxima that the symbolics code uses threadsafe? (The assumptions code that I touched in #30074 is definitely not threadsafe.)

The parallelization is based on the Python module [multiprocessing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html), so it involves several processes.

> The reported error comes from Maxima, which runs in ECL. Is ECL prepared and configured for threadsafe operation? Are the parts of Maxima that the symbolics code uses threadsafe? (The assumptions code that I touched in #30074 is definitely not threadsafe.)

There is no error when the involved symbolic expressions do not contain any symbolic function, so I would say that is not an issue with Maxima and parallelization, but rather an issue with Sage's symbolic functions (cf. comment:4 and #31047).
