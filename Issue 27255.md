Keywords: parallelization, symbolic functions

Sage fails in parallelized computations on tensor fields involving symbolic functions (without any symbolic function in the tensor components, everything is OK). Here is an example with Sage 9.3.beta6 (`...` indicates truncated output, see the attachment for the full log):

```
sage: Parallelism().set(nproc=2)

sage: X.<x,y> = M.chart()

To help you along with this: it's probably a matter that the existence of the symbolic function 'f' isn't properly coordinated across the inter-process communication, so that a new symbolic function, also called 'f' is created at some point:

```
sage: a_new=s0.operands()[2]
sage: a
f(x)
sage: a_new
f(x)
sage: a - a
0
sage: a - a_new #this indicates something fishy
-f(x) + f(x)
sage: bool( a==a_new)
True
sage: s0.subs({a_new: a})
-x^3 - (x^2 - x*f(x))*y + f(x)
sage: s0.subs({a_new: a}).coefficient(a,1)
x*y + 1
```
If may pickling that's (part of) the problem:

```
sage: function('f')(x)-function('f')(x)
0
sage: function('f')(x)-SR('f(x)')
0
sage: loads(dumps(SR('f(x)')))-SR('f(x)')
0
sage: function('f')(x)-SR('f(x)')
f(x) - f(x)
sage: loads(dumps(function('f')(x)))-function('f')(x)
-f(x) + f(x)
sage: loads(dumps(function('f')(x)))-SR('f(x)')
0
```
as you can see, the different ways of creating a symbolic function start out as giving the same result. However, as soon as pickling has been involved, something changes, and results are not compatible any more. from that point onwards, `SR('f(x)')` seems to produce results consistent with pickling, but `function('f')(x)` is reliably not compatible (and in fact, further investigation shows that `function('f')(x)` across different invocations of pickle returns unidentical results. So there's some naste cache wiping/corruption going on somewhere.

You can see part of it here:

```
sage: explain_pickle(dumps(function('f')(x)))
pg_Expression = unpickle_global('sage.symbolic.expression', 'Expression')
si = unpickle_newobj(pg_Expression, ())
unpickle_build(si, (0r, ['x'], 'GARC\x03\tfunction\x00class\x00symbol\x00x\x00name\x00seq\x00python\x00f\x00sage_ex\x00\x01\x08\x01\x02\x02\n\x02"\x03\x04\n\x00+\x001\x00"\x07'))
si
```

Since false results are produced, it seems to be a severe bug. On this, I'd suggest either to solve it for milestone 9 or at least to disable the feature or give it a warning in the documentation until a solution is found.

This bug is really annoying in terms of applications. You need parallelization to speed things up, especially in this case. I thought maybe you have some ideas to contribute. If not, my apologies.

Well, there are lots of libraries involved in symbolics, so lots of questions.

I guess the first question to ask is whether the parallelization that you use involves several threads in one process, or several processes.

The reported error comes from Maxima, which runs in ECL. Is ECL prepared and configured for threadsafe operation? Are the parts of Maxima that the symbolics code uses threadsafe? (The assumptions code that I touched in #30074 is definitely not threadsafe.)

The parallelization is based on the Python module [multiprocessing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html), so it involves several processes.

There is no error when the involved symbolic expressions do not contain any symbolic function, so I would say that is not an issue with Maxima and parallelization, but rather an issue with Sage's symbolic functions (cf. comment:4 and #31047).
