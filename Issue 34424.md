Unfortunately, the current branch fails.  Here is a simplified illustration of what goes wrong:

```
sage: L.<z> = LazyPowerSeriesRing(ZZ)
sage: A = L.undefined(valuation=5)
sage: B = L.undefined()
sage: A.define(z^5 + B)
sage: B.define(z + A)
sage: A
z^5 + z^9 + z^10 + O(z^12)
sage: B
1 + z^4 + O(z^7)
```


I think we are sloppy about our use of `_approximate_order` and `_offset`, which are now both lazy attributes.  This might eventually become a problem anyway (eg. with #34556), so we better solve it:

```
sage: A = L.undefined(valuation=5); B = L.undefined(); A.define(z^5 + B); B.define(z + A)
sage: A._coeff_stream._offset
5
sage: B._coeff_stream._offset
0
sage: B[0]
1
```


The iterator of `B` (which is just the default iterator of `Stream_inexact`) is

```
    def iterate_coefficients(self):
        n = self._approximate_order
        while True:
            yield self.get_coefficient(n)
            n += 1
```

When it is called by `B._coeff_stream.__getitem__[0]`, we find `n == self._approximate_order == 1`, which does not correspond to `self._offset`, which is `0`.

I am guessing, the essence of the problem is that we do not clearly specify with which coefficient `Stream.iterate_coefficients` begins.

The current behaviour is that it starts with the `_approximate_order` which is currently valid :-)

Actually, now I found a bug (or garbage in - garbage out without warning), without this ticket:

```
sage: L.<z> = LazyPowerSeriesRing(ZZ, sparse=False); A = L.undefined(valuation=3); B = L.undefined(); A.define(z^3 + B); B.define(z^2 + A^2)
sage: A
z^3 + z^6 + 2*z^9 + O(z^10)
sage: B
z^2 + z^6 + O(z^7)
```

This is wrong, because `A != z^3 + B`.
