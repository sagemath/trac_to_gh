Unfortunately, the current branch fails.  Here is a simplified illustration of what goes wrong:

```
sage: L.<z> = LazyPowerSeriesRing(ZZ)
sage: A = L.undefined(valuation=5)
sage: B = L.undefined()
sage: A.define(z^5 + B)
sage: B.define(z + A)
sage: A
z^5 + z^9 + z^10 + O(z^12)
sage: B
1 + z^4 + O(z^7)
```

I think we are sloppy about our use of `_approximate_order` and `_offset`, which are now both lazy attributes.  This might eventually become a problem anyway (eg. with #34556), so we better solve it:

```
sage: A = L.undefined(valuation=5); B = L.undefined(); A.define(z^5 + B); B.define(z + A)
sage: A._coeff_stream._offset
5
sage: B._coeff_stream._offset
0
sage: B[0]
1
```

The iterator of `B` (which is just the default iterator of `Stream_inexact`) is

```
    def iterate_coefficients(self):
        n = self._approximate_order
        while True:
            yield self.get_coefficient(n)
            n += 1
```
When it is called by `B._coeff_stream.__getitem__[0]`, we find `n == self._approximate_order == 1`, which does not correspond to `self._offset`, which is `0`.

I am guessing, the essence of the problem is that we do not clearly specify with which coefficient `Stream.iterate_coefficients` begins.

The current behaviour is that it starts with the `_approximate_order` which is currently valid :-)

Actually, now I found a bug (or garbage in - garbage out without warning), without this ticket:

```
sage: L.<z> = LazyPowerSeriesRing(ZZ, sparse=False); A = L.undefined(valuation=3); B = L.undefined(); A.define(z^3 + B); B.define(z^2 + A^2)
sage: A
z^3 + z^6 + 2*z^9 + O(z^10)
sage: B
z^2 + z^6 + O(z^7)

This is wrong, because `A != z^3 + B`.

Resetting the approximate order of `self` and of `coeff_stream` in `Stream_uninitialized.define` seems to work roughly (unless `coeff_stream._is_sparse`, of course), but I am quite sure it is not the right way to do it.  In particular, there are some failures which I don't quite understand (among others).

My hope would be to have a cleaner design, and more precise responsibilities for `approximate_order`.

Help would be very much appreciated.

I guess I should go through a simple recursive definition with pen and paper.

`@`tscrim, in case you have some time, this is the ticket I currently find most important.

I'd like to stress, however, that I do not find the aim as stated in the description important (in most cases, the savings will be negligible).  Instead, what I hope for is a much cleaner (and therefore more robust) design.

In particular, this ticket should probably be considered together with #34556.
