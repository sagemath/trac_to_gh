I should almost make you wait longer just for the length of your branch name!

You need to change `\hdots` to `\ldots` for it to work properly in the documentation.  Otherwise this is fine.

Of course, there is the meta-question of whether one should really change this behavior.  Have you talked to anyone else about that?  It is indeed backward-compatible but still one might ask whether matrix rows are numbered at 0 or 1... though with Python probably the previous behavior was more wrong than the current one...

:-)

Most of the name was built by git trac from the summary; I'd been too lazy to type this in myself :-)

Done.

Sage matrices/vectors/... (under the influence of Python) are
unambiguously indexed by 0..n-1, aren't they? After all that's the
convention used systematically in all other methods (row, set_row,
col, __getitem__, ...).

In this sense, permute_rows and friends were the exceptions. That's
why I did not bother yet advertising this ticket specifically (beside
you, Anne, and whoever is following it). We could make a call on
sage-devel if you think this is really needed.

Cheers,
                                    Nicolas

You know, I'd feel better if you just put a little blurb there saying, "we want to make this change because it seemed more in line with 0-based counting, but in case anyone cares say something on the ticket."  If we don't hear back, switch it to positive review.
