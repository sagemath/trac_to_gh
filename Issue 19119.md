Instead of only allowing an interval containing a root, an approximate root should also be accepted.

I'm not sure why this never got reviewed, so I am reviewing it after rebasing it on 7.1.beta3 (actually merging not rebasing).  The code looks good, but I suppose that #19362 needs finishing first.  I am not sure what the needs_work issue is with that one?

I merged with current develop (7.1.beta3).  One minor doctest change was needed in QQbar.  I hope I did not break etiquette ('ticket-etiquette'!) by doing so and pushing the branch with my name on...
