The fix should be trivial but documentation may need to be checked.

kiwisolver is a new dependency of matplotlib. This means that you will need to add that as package.

Replying to [comment:8 jdemeyer]:
> kiwisolver is a new dependency of matplotlib. This means that you will need to add that as package.

Yes, I should have mentioned it in my earlier message but I had completely forgotten about it. No other new dependencies as far as I know.

Just a small detail: could you wrap the lines in `SPKG.txt` to at most 72 characters per line?

We need to decide what to do with `spkg-src`. The tarball on this ticket was not generated using the `spkg-src` script.

It seems you forgot to update the checksums. I can do that...

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2018-07-02 20:55:02

I'm confused now because the checksums seem correct despite not being updated since uploading the tarball. So maybe the checksums were correct before, but for the wrong tarball.

---

Comment by slelievre created at 2018-07-02 22:00:46

Yes, that is what happened. The spkg-src script in build/pkgs/matplotlib
had been run, so the checksums were already for the repackaged tarball,
but no link had been provided for the new tarball.

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2018-07-03 07:21:19

Running `make ptestlong` now. Positive review if that passes.

The "normed" keyword argument has been replaced by "density".

In Sage, should we still allow the "normed" keyword for a while, with a deprecation warning?

Or are the changes in the last commit enough?

That's a very good question and one of the reasons why I didn't set this to positive_review directly.

I'm getting confused here. I cannot reproduce the deprecations regarding `normed`. It seems that these deprecations are really caused by a numpy upgrade (which is not on this ticket).

Rebased to 8.4.beta0 and squashed. The final commit still needs review. Samuel, can you do that?

This looks good to me. And it works on top of 8.4.beta1
