# Issue 30207: Mention anonymous hyperlinks in developer doc

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30444

Original creator: slabbe

Original creation time: 2020-08-26 12:08:07

In the documentation of a sage file, writing


```
see `this page <http://www.example1.com>`_
or `this page <http://www.example2.com>`_
```


creates an error while building the documentation saying ``WARNING: Duplicate explicit target name: ...``.

One solution is to use anonymous hyperlinks with double underscores as in:


```
see `this page <http://www.example1.com>`__
or `this page <http://www.example2.com>`__
```


See: [Restructured text (rst) http links underscore ('__' vs '_' use)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27420317/) on stackoverflow. This ticket aims to add documentation about that solution.

The issue was raised in #30393, in particular see [comment:22](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30393#comment:22).

I would just modify the existing sentence to say

```
If you want a specific link name, use ```link name <http://www.example.com>`__`` (with two underscores at the end)
```

but I'm okay with your version too.

Also, I'm not sure how idiomatic “creates an error” is, but your English is likely better than mine!

I agree, the new paragraph was too long. Will do the update next week (going on vacation tomorrow).

It's an improvement already and further refinements can also be done in a follow up ticket.
