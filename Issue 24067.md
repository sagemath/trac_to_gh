# Issue 24067: Make is_endomorphism_set be trivial for Endsets.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24304

Original creator: tscrim

Original creation time: 2017-11-30 11:40:18

CC:  jdemeyer

Keywords: homset, endsets

Right now, if a homset is in `Endsets`, the code in `is_endomorphism_set` still does the checks. However, by declaring in `Endsets`, this is guaranteed (otherwise it is a bug). We should not check anything and just return `True`.
