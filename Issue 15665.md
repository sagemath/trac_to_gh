In `calculus/calculus.py`: `symbolic_expression_from_maxima_string()` should catch maxima `RuntimeError`s from `ecl.c` and rethrow them with meaningful information, like the statement triggering the error and, if possible, the exact maxima error msg.

At the moment you only get `RuntimeError: ECL says: THROW: The catch MACSYMA-QUIT is undefined.`

(don't know if the latter is possible)

There may be several ways of approaching this problem. The main reason why this runtime error occurs is illustrated by:

```
sage: from sage.interfaces.maxima_lib import maxima_eval
sage: maxima_eval("#$1+$")
RuntimeError: ECL says: THROW: The catch MACSYMA-QUIT is undefined.
sage: type(maxima_eval)
<type 'sage.libs.ecl.EclObject'>
```

The problem is that `maxima_eval` itself is a wrapper around a lisp function. When called with a string argument, the default is to convert that string to a lisp expression via the lisp "reader" (think parser). The `"#$...$"` construct is a reader "macro": it calls the maxima parser on the string. Problem is, this happens *before* `maxima_eval` takes control (which does set up the appropriate error catching infrastructure for maxima code).

We could run the reader under the same error catching:

```
sage: maxima_eval('(read-from-string "#$1+$")')
RuntimeError: ECL says: Maxima condition. result:T$error:No error.
```

As you can see, now the error does get processed in a different way. No useful error message comes out of it, though.

When I wrote this, it was really with the idea that it would be an error of the calculus library if maxima were fed a syntax error. Nearly all the translation between sage and maxima can be done on a deeper level than string back-and-forth parsing. See `sr_to_max` and `max_to_sr` and how they are used in `sr_integral`, `sr_limit` and `sr_sum`. It was originally the idea that the calculus-to-maxima_lib interface would eventually almost do away completely with string passing. As it turned out, this hasn't been such a priority.

In my opinion, `symbolic_expression_from_maxima_string` should only receive strings that parse in maxima. Only the ones that don't give the incomprehensible error messages. Actual runtime errors are caught in a meaningful way:

```
sage: sage.calculus.calculus.symbolic_expression_from_maxima_string("1/0")
RuntimeError: ECL says: Error executing code in Maxima: expt: undefined: 0 to a negative exponent.
```
