Keywords: R r-project graphics

The current version of R disables graphics if no X11 is available even though `r.capabilities()` states that PNG is enabled. But you can't generate PNGs, which is why R graphics is broken in the Sage virtual machine. This is fixed in the newest upstream version, of which I made a new spkg.

There is no other change.

On an unrelated note, it would be nice if R would be referred to as r-project on trac since it is otherwise hopeless to search for it.

Hmm, I don't mind this in theory.  I'd want to test it out a little.   Can you point to one of the R announcements where they end up fixing this?  They have *very* detailed and thorough announcements, which I usually cannot make it all the way through when searching for this sort of thing.

Also, does this mean we don't need libpango or cairo or all that stuff?  Or would we still need that?

Some relevant things.
* Re: #8868 - One concern is whether it *always* makes graphics work - OS X, Linux, Solaris.  Otherwise I wouldn't want to re-enable the doctests, which are currently optional.  If they work, then this ticket should enable them.
* Great idea on the r-project.  I always put R things that are not about statistics per se in the "packages" component.    I'm updating others now.
* Leif has put a lot of work in separating rpy from R at #9906.  I'm not sure what should have priority, though, given that we are fairly behind the times and reviewing #9906 is a boatload of work.
 
Here are a bunch of other relevant tickets which perhaps (?) should be addressed here, or at least mentioned.
* #7865 R on 64-bit Solaris C and Fortran mixing
* #7664 R and Latex
* #9668 hardcoding paths in R binary
* #11970 readline issues on Oneric Ocelot or something

Given that we get relatively frequent requests for R graphics in the virtual machine I would prefer it if we could get this ticket reviewed asap. Really all there is to do is regression testing, and the easiest way to do so is to run it on the build bot.

I think that given Leif's lukewarmness on this and Volker's adamance, along with my own natural inclination, let's go for it.   My guess is that we may not even need to backport everything for the others... ?

Functions can't be lvalues in R, so its fine though maybe not beautiful:

```
> file=123
> file
[1] 123
> file('test.txt')
description       class        mode        text      opened    can read 
 "test.txt"      "file"         "r"      "text"    "closed"       "yes" 
  can write 
      "yes" 
> file
[1] 123
```


>  * Also, might as well add to reference manual if it's now all formatted correctly?  Should just be one line adding it to the toc or something...

I only patched up the sphinx breakage where I fixed things. There are still 2kloc to go, but I didn't want to break each and every patch for `sage/interfaces/r.py` on trac...

>  * Is it possible to provide a VM doing what you showed works I could download into my VirtualBox, or is that too much work?

You just have to recompile the new R in my virtual machine and it'll basically work. You need to install fonts, though, otherwise all text in the plots will be emtpy squares.

I just built on sage.math and it worked for me (20x parallel). I'm using sage-4.8.alpha2, though. Did you merge anything in alpha3 that might cause this?

I don't have a local OSX machine, so I can't debug it myself. Does it also happen if you start R and type in `capabilities("png")`? If yes, does

```
Sys.unsetenv("DISPLAY")
```

change anything?

Yes, X11 doesn't start, and it reports "False" for png:

```
> Sys.unsetenv("DISPLAY") 
> capabilities("png")
  png 
FALSE 
> capabilities("aqua")
aqua 
TRUE 
```

(I don't know why there are leading spaces in the returned string "  png".)

Wow, that is really unexpected.  Also weird, because I tested the entire library overnight on my local 4.8.alpha4 (for another ticket) and nothing happened like that, or I would have noticed this morning.

```

new-host-2:sage-4.8.alpha4 karl-dietercrisman$ ./sage -t devel/sage/sage/interfaces/r.py 
sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/interfaces/r.py"                  
	 [13.6 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 13.6 seconds

Of course, I also get

```
> capabilities("png")
  png 
FALSE 
```

Your problem is that someone Sage got compiled with png support!  It's not supposed to on Mac, we try to configure it to use (only) Aqua.  Hence the doctest being a little unusual:

```
            sage: s = r.eval('capabilities("png")') # Should be on Linux and Solaris
            sage: t = r.eval('capabilities("aqua")') # Should be on all supported Mac versions
            sage: "TRUE" in s+t                      # optional -- rgraphics
            True
```

My guess is you have something set in your preferences or elsewhere that caused R to pick up a system version of something.  In general, getting R to compile on Mac with png support is interesting and hackish - I can't find the page I'm looking for right now, but it's referenced somewhere on one of the previous "get graphics in R in Sage to work" Trac tickets.

In other words, while not ideal, I wouldn't call this something to unmerge this new spkg for.

X11 just starts up.  It doesn't seem to have any windows running.  I don't have strace installed on this computer, and I wouldn't know how to use it if I did ;)

By the way, if I log into an OS X box remotely, I don't have this problem.  It must correctly detect that I can't run X11, and it also says that I don't have 'png' capabilities.

kcrisman: Do you have X11 installed on your Mac?  Maybe if it's not installed, it doesn't go through this check and returns "FALSE" for png capabilities.

I remember seeing something about compiling R with png support on [http://ask.sagemath.org/](http://ask.sagemath.org/), but I don't remember beyond that.  I don't think I have a particularly unusual setup, but who knows what R looks at?  In the install log for R, I see this:

```
  Interfaces supported:      X11, aqua, tcltk
  External libraries:        readline, ICU
  Additional capabilities:   PNG, JPEG, NLS
```


Anyway, I'm not suggesting unmerging the spkg, but fixing the doctest somehow (in a followup ticket, if that's best).  Can we do the equivalent in Sage of

```
Sys.unsetenv("DISPLAY") 
capabilities("png")
capabilities("aqua")
```

without breaking things on Linux or Solaris?

> On OS X 10.6.8 I cannot install this spkg in  sage-4.8.alpha3 (I build the alpha3 from source so the old spkg does install).

Questions:
* Do you have any unusual environment variables set?
* Do you have any R env. variables, or another R installation separate from this one?
* Is there anything unusual you have on your machine (I am currently on the exact same OS version, w/out problems) regarding compiling?

Usually we've found that R problems are related to it picking up system versions or variables.  

I'd recommend we open a new ticket for this, though, since "most" OS X 10.6 systems seem to be just fine.
