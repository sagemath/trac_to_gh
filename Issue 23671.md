Looks good. I have a few minor changes to add, in a few minutes.

I think you should be a little careful about a non-necessarily-finite ring meaning the group is infinite. Also, are we sure every ring (that works) has `is_finite` implemented?

Okay, I made a few changes:

- moved the references to the master bibliography file
- made some more lines shorter than 80 characters
- fixed a typo ("rinrg")
- fixed two doctests in `categories/primer.py`

If this passes doctests and if you are happy with my changes, positive review from me.

Travis, is this ok for you ? Or did I miss something ?

I think we can assume if something implements `is_finite`, then it will return the correct value (or [hopefully] raise an error if it unable to decide). Thanks.

If tests pass, positive review.
