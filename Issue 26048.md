Are these little helper functions useful? They don't seem to really improve the code readability IMO now.

```
            def f_edge_used(u, v):
                return edge_used[frozenset((u,v))]
```


```
                def B(u,v):
                    return b[frozenset((u,v))]
```


Otherwise LGTM.
