* Implement the Gessel-Reutenauer bijection between words and multisets of aperiodic necklaces (using Lyndon words as a makeshift aperiodic-necklaces class). Also implement its "odd" analogue. (See http://people.brandeis.edu/~gessel/homepage/papers/necklace.pdf for both).
* Possibly implement Kufleitner's sort transform as well (arXiv:0908.0239v1).
