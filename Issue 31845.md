Hi Frédéric. Would you be willing to review this ticket?

For the basis computation algorithm, it works by having the generators act on the new basis vectors that we see during each iteration. To improve stuff for larger rank, I added some sparseness support that improves the `basis()` computation both in terms of memory and speed.
