# Issue 31845: Implement e7 and e8 as matrix Lie algebras

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32082

Original creator: tscrim

Original creation time: 2021-06-29 06:56:38

CC:  chapoton darij

Keywords: lie algebras

We provide a sparse version of some methods to help facilitate this construction and keep the amount of memory used small.

Hi Frédéric. Would you be willing to review this ticket?

For the basis computation algorithm, it works by having the generators act on the new basis vectors that we see during each iteration. To improve stuff for larger rank, I added some sparseness support that improves the `basis()` computation both in terms of memory and speed.

Green patchbot.

This is relatively simple implementation of e<sub>7</sub> and e<sub>8</sub> as matrix Lie algebras with some added speed improvements that should be straightforward to review. Doctests verify that they are the correct Lie algebras. Green patchbot.

ok, looks good.

Please add one empty line before

```
+        def build_assoc(row):
```

and then you can set to positive on my behalf.

Done. Thank you.

Running the test suite could be done in a TESTS block
(+ minor rephrasing suggestion):


```diff
         EXAMPLES::
 
             sage: g = LieAlgebra(QQ, cartan_type=['E', 8], representation='matrix')
             sage: g
             Simple matrix Lie algebra of type ['E', 8] over Rational Field

+        TESTS:
+
+        Run the test suite, skipping tests that take too long::
+
+            sage: g = LieAlgebra(QQ, cartan_type=['E', 8], representation='matrix')
             sage: TestSuite(g).run(skip="_test_not_implemented_methods")  # long time
-
-        We skipped this tests as it takes too much time.
         """
```


Or fix the typo in "We skipped this tests".

I think it really doesn't make any difference for an `__init__` doctest being `TESTS::` versus `EXAMPLES::` as any casual user will never see it, but I changed it. I made an additional tweak to your suggested change too.

You are right about EXAMPLES vs TESTS for
an `__init__` method; restore if you prefer.

I would use present tense "We skip"
rather than "We skipped", but up to you.

Good point about the present tense. I am allowing myself to reset a positive review as the change is trivial.
