As a dependency for #14469, we need a sagenb spkg that includes https://github.com/vbraun/sagenb/commit/89c6b6ced13733bcedff7c18ae49ba0dc8db0457. It is merged but not in a release.

Please try out the new spkg. It depends on #14469. Tested

```
sage -tp --sagenb
```

against sage-5.11.rc0.

Works for me. 

The SPKG.txt hasn't been updated with the git changelog in a while, so I guess there is no point in starting now.

What is missing from the SPKG changelog? It is not complete, but it is up to date.

Oops, got the directories mixed up when I looked at the contents. Everything is as it should be.

This ticket is not fixed in the latest sage-git. I wonder why, because it has the latest sagenb.
