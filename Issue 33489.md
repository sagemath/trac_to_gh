What do you mean? You only replaced `iteritems` with `items` (of python3).

Well, I suspect that this part of the code is never doctested. In python3, dictionaries no longer have an iteritems method.

The only thing that still have an iteritems method are sage own's weak dictionaries. We should switch this method's name to items, but not in this ticket.
