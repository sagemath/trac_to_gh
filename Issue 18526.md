Please fill the `Authors` field with your full name.

Instead of `sage_malloc` you could use `check_malloc` (that checks that the memory is indeed allocated and raises an error if not).

Otherwise, everything looks clean and tests run smoothly on my computer (with Coin installed).

Thanks a lot for reviewing the ticket.
Does one call `sage_free` to free the memory allocated by `check_malloc`?
Since `sage_malloc` is used throughout the file, I was trying to be consistent. Would you suggest replacing them all by `check_malloc`? Or perhaps better to update them using #18868?

I do not think that #18868 is good idea in this case. You will create a Python object for nothing.

`check_malloc` is equivalent to `sage_malloc` except that it will raise an error in case the memory was not allocated (where `sage_malloc` just returns `NULL`). So the memory should be freed with `sage_free`. You can safely replace occurrences of `sage_malloc` by `check_malloc`. Moreover you can always replace

```
my_ptr = sage_malloc(12)
if my_ptr == NULL:
    raise MemoryError("allocation failed")
```

by

```
my_ptr = check_malloc(12)
```
