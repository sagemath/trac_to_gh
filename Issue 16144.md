I was trying to do a simple example on page 51 of Atiyah-Macdonald using Sage, and it fails:

```
R.<x,y,z> = QQ[]
I = R.ideal([x*y - z^2])
A.<xbar,ybar,zbar> = R.quotient(I)
p = A.ideal([x,z])
p.primary_decomposition()
```

boom! ---

So we'd want somthing like this?


```python
sage: R.<x,y,z> = QQ[]
sage: I = R.ideal([x*y - z^2])
sage: A.<xbar,ybar,zbar> = R.quotient(I)
sage: J = A.ideal([x,z])

sage: J = Ideal(f.lift() for f in p.gens())
sage: Q = Sequence(Ideal(A(f) for f in q.gens()) for q in (I + J).primary_decomposition())

Primary decomposition in quotient rings is not yet supported by Singular, see documentation.

Consider that Singular usually never checks if used parameters are valid or allowed!!
Their philosophy is/was that the user should know what he is doing, a very unfortunate one from my point of view. 

Parameter check is now (since ver 4.0 ) done for primary decomposition.
Maybe I will add support for primary decomposition in quotient rings, so bug me continuously to get this done.
