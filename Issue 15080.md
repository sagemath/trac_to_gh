Python currently fails/is suboptimal on Cygwin because:
* it does not properly detect readline which is only installed as a shared library, patch "2.7.3-dylib.patch" from Cygwin package fixes that;
* the curses module is not built because of undefined refs, just passing -lcurses when linking is not enough, one should add -ltinfo;
* it segfault at startup when loading the readline module, not sure why. It looks exactly as what is reported at http://trac.macports.org/ticket/29496 . Rebuilding ncurses with debug info (including CFLAGS="-O0 -g" which cannot easily be passed right now) does not give much info. The offending line pointed by GCC is "char *result = exit_attribute_mode;"; maybe some dark magic going on as reported in http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-ncurses/2006-10/msg00002.html ; please not that on Cygwin the stack is small by default but playing a little bit with that did not really help. Further info: ncurses 5.7 is fine, ncurses 5.8 fails in the same way.

The problem is that when the config BROKEN_LINKER is set, then a pointer CurTerm is used but never set to something else than zero.
Setting it as in other cases seems to fix the problem.
Or unsetting BROKEN_LINKER on Cygwin.

What is in that branch exactly?
From the git log I assume you just updated the tarball with what's within the spkg?
Note that's only for testing purpose and a clean patch should be produced :)
FYI, I think we temporarly could just diff what's in the tarball with the vanilla tarball and ship it as a patch in Sage, but that's definitely not for upstream inclusion.
Right know it basically adds "-ltinfo" all the time which is right for Sage as we build our own ncurses which makes tinfo a separate lib.

The _socket thing reminds me of rebasing issues.
Try to run "find . -name "*.dll" > dlls && rebase -O -T dlls && make" in Sage's root.
And I did not test on Cygwin64 lately, so that might be another problem.

> ATLAS built fine for me, but it's failing on pillow. I've attached the log. I'm trying the Cygwin64 now.
The pillow failure has noting to do with the cahnges here.
It is quite easy to fix and is an upstream bug:
* pillow wants to use some png functions but does not explicitely link to libpng and that's a no go on cygwin (but ok on most other systems).
* in the log see line 314 "building 'PIL._imagingft' extension" and the few next ones

> FTR It doesn't work for me on Cygwin64. Here's the log.
It seems the readline module is not built:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
ImportError: No module named readline
```

and indeed readline is not found:

```
checking how to link readline libs... none
checking for rl_callback_handler_install in -lreadline... no
checking for rl_pre_input_hook in -lreadline... no
checking for rl_completion_display_matches_hook in -lreadline... no
checking for rl_completion_matches in -lreadline... no
```

Could you post your readline log?

Please let's go one step at a time, at least now installing python on Cygwin32 works, I'll try to go with the pillow and installing python on Cygwin64 issues on follow up tickets quickly.
