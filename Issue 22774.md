# Issue 22774: ECL sometimes doesn't handle signals in a timely manner

Keywords: ecl cygwin

The following test sometimes blocks / fails due to timeout:


```python
from sage.libs.ecl import *
from cysignals.tests import interrupt_after_delay
ecl_eval("(setf i 0)")
inf_loop = ecl_eval("(defun infinite() (loop (incf i)))")
interrupt_after_delay(1000)
print("starting loop")
inf_loop()
```


This will *sometimes* block indefinitely, at least on Cygwin--I have not tested on other platforms yet.

The issue isn't with `interrupt_after_delay` itself, since replacing `inf_loop` with a long `sleep()` doesn't exhibit the problem.

The problem appears to be fixed upstream in the development version of ECL.  I traced the fix to [this commit](https://gitlab.com/embeddable-common-lisp/ecl/commit/0c9e67345c364b3d41acca899d80a5c0c35152a6) which is pretty bizarre, as it doesn't have anything to do with signal handling.  Yet I'm certain this is the one.  What I suspect is that something in the `(loop)` macro had slow behavior due to the bug this commit fixed, and that that slow behavior was taking place while signal handling is disabled (`ecl_disable_interrupts()`).

After applying the fix it doesn't appear to block signals anymore, or if it does it's only for a very small amount of time, so the failure should be much more rare.

I've added the fix from upstream as a patch to Sage's ECL.

The patch should also apply cleanly to ECL 6.1.3 (#22191) and the issue is still present in that version.

Does Cygwin have something like `strace`? It would be interesting to see the output of that.

You mention that it's a doctest. So if the problem would occur on Linux, surely somebody would have mentioned it and I cannot remember ever seeing this problem.

It could be that there is a genuine race condition on all systems, but that it only manifests itself on Cygwin due to different timing of things.

Looking at the trace, the many lines with `rt_sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK, NULL, [], 8)  = 0` do look strange. Just by itself, it's nothing problematic though.

It happens semi-randomly though.

Right, it wouldn't be the first time.  I think this is most likely too.

With the patch applied I don't see this at all--when it gets to the loop, strace output goes silent.  I'm about to try rebuilding again without the patch.

> Erik, I reckon you have a branch for using a development version of ECL. If so, would you mind sharing it, I think I need to try it on #22679.

I don't think I have anything exactly like that.  Right now, when I want to test dev versions of packages, I just copy the `build/pkgs/<pkgname>` directory somewhere, and then check out the git repo into that under `src/`, then run `./spkg-install` manually (in a `sage -sh`).

Doing this with the latest snapshot I then get an error building ecl extension:

```
src/build/cythonized/sage/libs/ecl.c:3701:57: error: use of undeclared identifier 'ECL_OPT_TRAP_SIGCHLD'; did you mean 'ECL_OPT_TRAP_SIGILL'?
```

and indeed `ECL_OPT_TRAP_SIGCHLD` is gone, so one needs to rework the interface.
Probably it was a recent change and you didn't hit it then...
