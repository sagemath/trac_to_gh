Are there some corresponding changes that need to be made in the Sage binary distribution repo? On rare occasions when I've installed a binary, it has run a script to hardcode various library locations, and I wonder if it uses `sage-location`. (To be honest, I don't know the status of binary distributions of Sage anymore.)
