numpy build fails on macOS with conda-forge (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/542501526)

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "numpy/core/setup_common.py", line 241, in check_long_double_representation
    ltype = long_double_representation(pyod(obj))
  File "numpy/core/setup_common.py", line 401, in long_double_representation
    raise ValueError("Could not lock sequences (%s)" % saw)
ValueError: Could not lock sequences (None)
```


This can be tested with #29415:

```
  tox -e local-conda-forge-macos-standard
```

it seems that these warnings are coming from scipy itself, or from networkx
(which in turn calls scipy).

Let me see if upgrading networkx helps.

Unfortunately there seem to be problems with runner setups, e.g. here 
https://github.com/dimpase/sage/runs/740349791?check_suite_focus=true
- this is `docker (archlinux-latest, standard-gcc_spkg)`
I see

```

2020-06-04T22:39:01.9688790Z   python3-pytest python-setuptools-doc
```

and a lot of 

```
2020-06-05T03:08:41.2134392Z Failure: ModuleNotFoundError (No module named 'pytest') ... ERROR
```

which seems to suggest that `python3-pytest` is a requirement.

Do you know how to fix this?

(there are other errors pointing at internal problems of runners)

Can we easily extend setup to use our own runners?

Apparently, running the testsuite of networkx requires pytest. Let's discuss this on #29766.

I don't think this has anything to do with [GitHub](GitHub).

Actually, on `ubuntu-xenial-standard` (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/745921419), I see lots of failures from the `networkx` testsuite such as this one:

```
