```markdown
Currently, the pprinter gets registered after controller.load_environment(). This is fine if a lazy import cache exists in ~/.sage/cache, because in this case sandpile.py doesn't get immediately executed. However, if there's no such cache, then the line

```
pretty.for_type(SandpileConfig, pretty.for_type(dict, None))
```

in sandpiles.py gets to run before the new dict pretty printer gets registered, causing the unsorted pretty printer to be registered for SandpileConfig (and similarly for SandpileDivisor). This leads to test failures in the absence of the lazy import cache.
