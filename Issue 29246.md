Next step... push the current `develop` to your sage fork on [GitHub](GitHub), and then do `git tag ci-gsl-29483` on the branch of the ticket and push the tag to your sage fork

I recommend to put the URL(s) of the most interesting actions runs (in this case, perhaps https://github.com/slel/sage/actions/runs/216181767 and https://github.com/slel/sage/actions/runs/216181769) in the Reviewer field on the Trac ticket. This makes it easy to see them in ticket lists.
