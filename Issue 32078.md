If it does need to be used by subclasses, then it should be `__classcall__`. However, you can do all of thebpreprocessing in the private version, then pass off to the correct subclass. What I am saying is it would be your factory function.

A non-enumerated set is not supposed to have an `__iter__` method, no? That's why I thought that sub-classing is necessary. Or what would have been your approach?

> I also don't get how you are getting an infinite loop. It is how function inheritance works.

Well, `__classcall__` of the base-class returns an invokation of the enumerated class. But that invokes the same `__classcall__` method, invoking the class constructor again... Or do I have a flaw in my thinking?

`set` also has an iterator. It just doesn't promise anything precise about the iteration order.

You would likely have a `__classcall_private__` to handle delegating to which subclass, then the processing of the input is done in `__classcall__`. Although another option is just a `_process_inputs` type method.

I see, then no sub-classing is necessary. That makes this ticket indeed minimal-invasive.

The latter is good to know. Does `__classcall_private__` always go over `__classcall__`?
