```
sage: (QQ^2).submodule([[1,1]])
Vector space of degree 2 and dimension 1 over Rational Field
Basis matrix:
[1 1]
sage: _.category()
Category of finite dimensional vector spaces with basis over (number fields and quotient fields and metric spaces)
```


`Subobjects` is missing, so the standard methods `ambient`, `lift`, `retract` are missing. 

This is in contrast to `CombinatorialFreeModule`.


(There is a class-specific method `ambient_module` though.)

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33431

LGTM other than catching `Exception` seems quite broad and might hide bugs. Could we make that more refined?

I generally agree (and specifically it did hide a bug, just fixed in 8230736!) but this is copied directly from `Module_free_ambient.__init__` and I don't have special insights to what it should be tightened.
