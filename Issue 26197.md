Keywords: threejs, conda, installed_packages

On conda, we are seeing failing doctests because installed_packages() is used:

```
File "src/sage/plot/plot3d/base.pyx", line 361, in sage.plot.plot3d.base.Graphics3d._rich_repr_threejs
Failed example:

This ticket aims to make installed_packages() here optional but also to simplify the threejs inclusion code that appears to have been duplicated and has since diverged.

I looked into making threejs a feature and reporting the version there. But it appears that threejs has no version information readily available. Even if it had that information I am not sure what we would do with it. Requiring `r80` seems to be wrong as we are using a very small subset of threejs so I suspect that almost any version of threejs would work.

Why doesn't the example

```


require an `# optional - internet` tag? Apparently it doesn't becasue it didn't have one before either, but it seems like it should?

> But it appears that threejs has no version information readily available.

Grep shows that at least on nix the version is present in `package.json` and `package-lock.json`. Not sure if that is build system specific or anything.

Why would anyone want to use the CDN version anyways?

This just generates `<script>` tags. It doesn't download the scripts that these tags refer to.

These files are npm metadata. I don't think that all disrtibutions include them.

Why would you want to use it? Well "it feels right" from a web-dev perspective...maybe you don't have threejs installed (in a compatible version)? Or you want to publish this somewhere online and don't want to serve all these script tags yourself?

But there does not seem to be an easy way to do this without dumping it all into the output. It's 500K per plot. That's annoying, sure, but at least it works (last time I checked at least) and nobody is going to complain about privacy.

At the meeting in Luminy last week we had virtually everybody who tried Sage stumble upon this one.

Since three.js is a standard package this should also be acceptable for packagers. They need to set the THREEJS environment variable and then the right scripts should be included.

The current situation is:
- by default scripts are served offline and it works in some cases
- there is an option to easily get output with scripts served online from CDN which also has its use cases and works everywhere, as I understand, but should not be made the default
- there are cases (important ones) where offline does not work

How about:
- keep the existing functionality of serving "offline" scripts
- keep the existing functionality of serving "online/CDN" scripts
- add your new option to inject the whole code instead of script tags

The default should be then "use offline scripts if possible, but inject the code if it does not work". Is this realizable? If not, then at least please keep the option to use CDN on request, what harm comes from that?!
