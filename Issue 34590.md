Keywords: Vector Partitions, distinct parts

Vector Partitions of a given vector is a multiset of integer vectors that sum to it. The module for Vector Partitions in [SageMath](SageMath) was initially developed by Dr. Amritanshu Prasad. The module contained primitive features such as enlisting all vectors lexicographically lesser than or equal to the given vector, and also generating all possible partitions of it. This new version of Vector Partitions module features distinct part partitions, partitions with a given set of parts as input and also enables repetition of certain selective parts.
