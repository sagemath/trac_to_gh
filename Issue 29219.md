Various packages have build errors with gcc 10, which is shipped with `fedora-32`. 
Hopefully we can wait for upstream to fix these errors.

- gf2x: #29390 gf2x build fails on `fedora-32-minimal`
- scipy: see #29443: Update scipy to 1.2.3 (last release supporting py2) 
- sympow: see #3360
- palp

I just adopted the patch already shipped in fedora until a new release.

* sympow is fixed by upgrading to the new fork.
* scipy can be fixed by adding some fortran flags until they fix the code, `-std=legacy` I think. I otherwise built sage-on-gentoo successfully with gcc-10 but I am not sure I have scanned absolutely all the packages.
