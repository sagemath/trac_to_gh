Orbit structure is a function for projective morphisms returning the pre-period and period of a point by the map in projective space. The same function can be defined for affine morphisms with little change. 

Used the same function code but replaced the examples with those suited for affine space.


``` 
sage: A.<x,y,z> = AffineSpace(GF(49, 't'),3)
sage: H = Hom(A,A)
sage: f = H([x^2 - z, x - y + z, y^2 - x^2])
sage: f.orbit_structure(A(1,1,2))
[7, 6]

Just some minor things. The functionality seems fine. Also put your full name in Author.

`function` is spelled wrong in comments. Actually the affine_point version has a number of typos as does the projective_point/projective_morphism versions. This is perhaps a reasonable place to fix all those typos.
