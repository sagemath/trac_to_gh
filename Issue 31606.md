Regarding the duplicate class

- remove it in a separate ticket from the rest of the changes?
- keep classes `AffinePermutationGroupTypeX` in alphabetic order?

Regarding the code formatting: while we're at it,
why not add spaces after commas also

- in `['A',5,1]`, `['A',7,1]`, `['B',4,1]`, `['C',4,1]`, `['D',4,1]`, `['G',2,1]`
- in some lines very near those modified in commit 9a54a5b:

```
... = AffinePermutationGroup(...)
p=...([...])
x=...([...])
gq=p.grassmannian_quotient()
...==loads(dumps(...))
ct=CartanType(...)
C.one()*C.one()==C.one()
```


But I don't mind either way, as iteratively
caring for nearby lines can take us far.

Or set to positive review on my behalf and keep
further changes for later.
