# Issue 18449: Tableaux: remove false theorem I stated about Bender-Knuth involutions

I claimed that `(s_i s_{i+1})^6 = id`, where `s_k` means the `k`-th Bender-Knuth involution on semistandard skew tableaux. I even made a doctest that unfortunately used a hook shape, which renders the Bender-Knuth involutions rather boring (though maybe it would make a nice exercise to check it in this case -- although I don't know if it is always true there).

The claim is false. There is a counterexample for skew tableaux and `i = 1` (or straight tableaux and `i = 2`). The source where I had it from, a paper by Berenstein and Kirillov, only claimed it for straight tableaux and `i = 1` (and that is indeed correct).

Thanks to Pavel Galashin for finding a counterexample!

Could we use some for loops?

```
sage: p = lambda t, k: t.bender_knuth_involution(k).bender_knuth_involution(k + 1)
sage: t = Tableau([[1,2,2],[3,4]])
sage: x = t
sage: for i in range(6): x = p(x, 2)
sage: x
[[1, 2, 3], [2, 4]]
sage: x == t
False
```

If you agree and make these changes, you can set a positive review on my behalf.
