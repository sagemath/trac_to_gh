# Issue 29217: spkg-configure.m4 for ppl

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29454

Original creator: mjo

CC:  dimpase embray mkoeppe fbissey

This is a C++ library with no pkg-config file, but at least upstream provides an m4 macro to detect itself.

On conda, the package is `ppl`.

I get the following error,

Hm... it's passing -lppl to the link command, is your conda library path on that command-line somewhere?


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2020-04-03 17:19:13

You can test conda using #29417:
`tox -e local-conda-forge-standard`

Looks like `-Wl,--as-needed -lppl conftest.cpp` doesn't work. `-Wl,--as-needed` is added by conda. `-lppl` needs to come after `conftest.cpp`.

Something wrong with their m4 macro, then? They stick the `-lppl` in `LDFLAGS` instead of `LIBS`.


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2020-04-03 19:14:05

Yes, that's wrong


---

Comment by mjo created at 2020-04-03 19:31:55

See if this works? I've hacked their macro to loop through the output of `ppl-config --ldflags`, putting each flag into either `PPL_LDFLAGS` or `PPL_LIBS` based on whether or not the flag starts with `-l`. This feels reeeaaally sketchy, but it seems to do the right thing on my machine. If it's semi-reliable, I can suggest it to upstream.

---

Comment by mjo created at 2020-04-04 14:00:55

Looks like missing ppl-config on Ubuntu. Does Debian also have a "ppl" package? If so, does it install ppl-config?


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2020-04-04 14:42:03

Debian/Ubuntu:

A ppl package does not exist. I changed it already to libppl-dev.

Following the links on repology leads to
https://packages.debian.org/testing/source/ppl,
which reveals ppl-dev - Parma Polyhedra Library (development binaries)
which might have what is needed in addition.

on Debian buster I have

```
/usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/ppl.hh
```

from libppl-dev
and

```
$ ppl-config -i
/usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu
```

(ppl-config comes from package ppl-dev)

Clearly I have not yet understood how to use repology. I guess there's a ppl-devel on fedora, too?

See https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/ppl/blob/master/f/ppl.spec on how Fedora builds its ppl packages.

In particular: 

```
# In order to avoid multiarch conflicts when installed for multiple
# architectures (e.g., i386 and x86_64), we rename the header files
# of the ppl-devel package.  They are substituted with ad-hoc 
# switchers that select the appropriate header file depending on
# the architecture for which the compiler is compiling.
 
# Since our header files only depend on the sizeof things, we smash
# ix86 onto i386 and arm* onto arm.  For the SuperH RISC engine family,
# we smash sh3 and sh4 onto sh.
normalized_arch=%{_arch}
%ifarch %{ix86}
normalized_arch=i386
%endif
%ifarch %{arm}
normalized_arch=arm
%endif
%ifarch sh3 sh4
normalized_arch=sh
%endif
 
mv %{buildroot}/%{_includedir}/ppl.hh %{buildroot}/%{_includedir}/ppl-${normalized_arch}.hh
install -m644 %{SOURCE1} %{buildroot}/%{_includedir}/ppl.hh
mv %{buildroot}/%{_includedir}/ppl_c.h %{buildroot}/%{_includedir}/ppl_c-${normalized_arch}.h
install -m644 %{SOURCE2} %{buildroot}/%{_includedir}/ppl_c.h
```



---

Comment by mjo created at 2020-04-04 15:23:41


```
install -m644 %{SOURCE1} %{buildroot}/%{_includedir}/ppl.hh
```


That should be installing their copy of ppl.hh that "selects the appropriate header file depending on the architecture for which the compiler is compiling."

Comment by dimpase created at 2020-04-04 15:25:59

Fedora 30 has packages ppl and ppl-devel, and ppl-config in one of them.

```
$ ppl-config -i
/usr/include
```

Thanks, I force-pushed over that last commit to add ppl-devel on Fedora. Maybe that solves the header problem.

One more try! That's another thing I'll have to report upstream if the new commit fixes the issue.

Thanks for setting up this test infrastructure, by the way. I occasionally feel personally attacked by github, but it's ultimately better to find and fix these problems early on.

Comment by dimpase created at 2020-04-13 09:05:18

there is a (hopefully innocent) no-op

```diff
+  [ # Some of its dependencies are installed as SPKGs, so install the
+    # ppl SPKG as well.
+    sage_spkg_install_ppl=yes
```

there is actually no need to set this var to `yes`, anyway, as it's `yes` before the macro is run


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2020-04-21 23:50:31

Regarding homebrew: this suggests using homebrew to install ppl, but Sage then doesn't allow that:

```
configure:27049: checking whether any of glpk gmp mpir is installed as or will be installed as SPKG
configure:27053: result: yes; install ppl as well
configure:27448: no suitable system package found for SPKG ppl
```

And this is because Sage doesn't allow `glpk`: the file `build/pkgs/glpk/distros/homebrew.txt` says

```
## glpk 4.65 should not be used by Sage as long as it is not patched by Homebrew
# glpk
```

Is this because of the doctest failures which have been fixed at #29317? That is, can we use an unpatched `glpk`? Should I open up a ticket to allow homebrew's `glpk`?

I've made this (apparently harmless in all cases) mistake a few times by copy/pasting something that never worked to begin with. I left myself a note to go back and delete them all.

We do use unpatched (to some extent) glpk on various Linux distos, I don't see why Homebrew is special in this sense. By the way, did you try submitting a Homebrew issue to fix this? I recently managed to talk them into fixing an annoying thing about their gettext package.

Nothing prevents you from installing glkp on Homebrew and using it regardless,
it's merely a hint that it's not printed (and thus not picked by the AI that does automated installs of Sage on Github Actions CI).

probably noone tested with `# optional - build` on, so it slipped through the cracks.
Obviously, a system package is not `"installed"` - in the sense, not by Sage.
The doctest has to be changed, to another package we don't have from a system (so this is a shrining list)...
