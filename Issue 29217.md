Regarding homebrew: this suggests using homebrew to install ppl, but Sage then doesn't allow that:

```
configure:27049: checking whether any of glpk gmp mpir is installed as or will be installed as SPKG
configure:27053: result: yes; install ppl as well
configure:27448: no suitable system package found for SPKG ppl
```

And this is because Sage doesn't allow `glpk`: the file `build/pkgs/glpk/distros/homebrew.txt` says

```
## glpk 4.65 should not be used by Sage as long as it is not patched by Homebrew
# glpk
```

Is this because of the doctest failures which have been fixed at #29317? That is, can we use an unpatched `glpk`? Should I open up a ticket to allow homebrew's `glpk`?

I've made this (apparently harmless in all cases) mistake a few times by copy/pasting something that never worked to begin with. I left myself a note to go back and delete them all.

We do use unpatched (to some extent) glpk on various Linux distos, I don't see why Homebrew is special in this sense. By the way, did you try submitting a Homebrew issue to fix this? I recently managed to talk them into fixing an annoying thing about their gettext package.

Nothing prevents you from installing glkp on Homebrew and using it regardless,
it's merely a hint that it's not printed (and thus not picked by the AI that does automated installs of Sage on Github Actions CI).

probably noone tested with `# optional - build` on, so it slipped through the cracks.
Obviously, a system package is not `"installed"` - in the sense, not by Sage.
The doctest has to be changed, to another package we don't have from a system (so this is a shrining list)...
