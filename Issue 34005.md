CC:  @videlec martinpepin

The docker images are using Ubuntu impish. We should instead build against the latest LTS version jammy.

Also, the README on Docker Hub is quite outdated.

Finally, we drop the CircleCI setup here. To my knowledge nobody is using it and I it's likely broken by now anyway.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/34242

I just checked with 9.6, it works without ARTIFACT_BASE.

When I do set ARTIFACT_BASE=sagemath/sagemath-dev:develop then docker build errors out with


```
ImportError: libssl.so.1.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```


which is to be expected, since ubuntu jammy switches to openssl 3.

This is a critical change: without it, building with docker fails.

I guess that's only a temporary issue. Once a newer image has been uploaded that shouldn't be an issue anymore.

It seems to have failed for a weird reason not related to the docker configuration (`apt-get` not being able to install some packages).
I think it has been fixed on the `develop` branch, maybe merging/rebasing will be enough to fix the build ?

BTW: I also managed to build the docker images on my system using your updated dockerfile so +1 for merging this patch
