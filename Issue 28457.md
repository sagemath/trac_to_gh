LGTM except you have a doctest failure in `src/sage/categories/groups.py`. So it seems like some order changed in a subtle way. It probably just is a doctest that we need to update.

I have replaced the doctest. This change comes from a change of sorting for matrices in SL(2,F2). I think. May need to be checked ?

Before

```
sage: sorted(SL(2,2))
[
[0 1]  [0 1]  [1 0]  [1 0]  [1 1]  [1 1]
[1 0], [1 1], [0 1], [1 1], [0 1], [1 0]
]
```

After

```
sage: sorted(SL(2,2))
[
[1 0]  [1 0]  [0 1]  [0 1]  [1 1]  [1 1]
[0 1], [1 1], [1 0], [1 1], [1 0], [0 1]
]
```

So indeed there is a change here.

I actually like the sorting after a little better since the identity comes first and it follows the iteration order. I just don't understand why the iteration order did change. It really looks like equivalent code and tests. Unfortunately, I don't think it matches the docstring. Ah, perhaps there is a `_cmp_` in the group code that gets used and gets used instead of the `_richcmp_` since these are matrix group elements?

Do you think one needs to investigate further, or one could proceed as it is ?

It is okay to proceed as-is, it might just be something that we will again have to change later on.
