# Issue 18885: cardinality_exhaustive incorrect in genus 1

Issue created by migration from Trac.

The `cardinality_exhaustive` method can return incorrect results for genus 1 curves if they are given by `y^2 = f(x)` where f(x) is a quartic polynomial whose leading coefficient is not a square:


```
sage: ZZX.<x> = PolynomialRing(ZZ)
sage: f = 15*x^4 + 7*x^3 + 3*x^2 + 7*x + 18
sage: HyperellipticCurve(f.change_ring(GF(19))).cardinality_exhaustive(1)
20
sage: sum([legendre_symbol(u, 19) + 1 for u in [f(x) for x in range(19)] + [f[4]]])   # correct answer
19
```


Here is the offending code:

```
if g == 1:
        # elliptic curves always have one smooth point at infinity
        a += 1
```


The problem is that for the given model, the curve may not have a rational point at infinity.

I agree.  It should add 1 for odd degree and for even degree it should add 1+(a/q) where a is the leading coefficient and q the fields cardinality, assuming that q is odd.

`@`cremona: what should be done when q is even ?

Good question!    The reasoning in odd characteristic is this:   let f^* be the reverse polynomial forced to have even degree if deg(f) is odd by adding an extra factor of x.  Then the points on y^2=f(x) above x=infinity are the points on y<sup>2=f</sup>*(x) above x=0.  In char 2 this will always be 1.

Conclusion: when q is even always add 1, for all degrees.

OK, I can test now...

The formula involving the Legendre symbol seems to assume that _K_ is a prime field.  I guess it can be replaced by

```
a += 2 if f.leading_coefficient().is_square() else 0
```

Thanks Peter.  Despite my good intentions other matters intervened...

I am literally making the branch now.  Meanwhile, there is no no need to import lefendre_symbol...

Good!  I am happy with the code and tests, so positive reivew coming up.

A general hyperelliptic curve is given by _C_: _y_<sup>2</sup> + _h_(_x_)_y_ = _f_(_x_); it seems to me that this fix is only correct if _h_ = 0.  (Note: in characteristic 2 we cannot have _h_ = 0, otherwise the curve would be singular everywhere.)

Take for example (over any finite field of characteristic not 11)

```
C: y^2 + y = x^3 - x^2      # 11a3, my favourite elliptic curve
D: w^2 + z^2*w = -z^2 + z
```

Then _C_ and _D_ are isomorphic via the change of variables

```
z = 1/x, w = y/x^2
```

The curve _C_ has two points at _x_ = 0, so _D_ has two points at _z_ = infinity.  Now consider

```
def test_C(p):
    R.<x> = GF(p)[]
    C = HyperellipticCurve(x^3 - x^2, 1)
    return C.count_points_exhaustive()

def test_D(p):
    S.<z> = GF(p)[]
    D = HyperellipticCurve(-z^2 + z, z^2)
    return D.count_points_exhaustive()
```

Running this for _p_ = 2 and _p_ gives

```
sage: test_C(2)
[5]
sage: test_D(2)
[4]
sage: test_C(3)
[5]
sage: test_D(3)
[3]
```

whereas all answers should be 5.

Should we fix this on this ticket or open a new one?

Do whatever you prefer.  I do not use this code and have no intention to start implementing code for hyperelliptic curves in characteristic 2.  I was asked a specific question about how many points there are at infinity on a curve of the form y^2=g(x).

Sure, it is clear from your comments that they were only meant for that case.  Since this ticket fixes the bug in that case, and has positive review, I will open a new ticket to treat the case `h != 0`.

This is now #21195.
