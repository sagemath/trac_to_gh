`src/` is the "pure Python" part of the project (sagelib). Most Sage developers are only familiar with this part.

But I have changed the top-level tox.ini so that it runs codespell on the same distribution.

Many of the excluded file/directory patterns could actually be obtained from `.gitignore` - but then again we would need a shell script to do this. I think it's "good enough" for this ticket.

Let's add documentation in #30453 (`sage -advanced` already shows it as part of the help). I will need help there with the IDE angle - I only use the command line.

> - Is the idea to run it as part of a github action, or patchbot on each ticket?

As of this ticket, it's just a dev tool that can be run locally. I don't have plans to work on CI integration for it.

As soon as you have participated in reviewing a ticket, it is appropriate to add your name to the list of reviewers.

(I have started to use the format "My name, ..." to indicate that more reviewers may be needed to cover other aspects of the ticket that I do not feel confident (or do not have time) to review. But this is not widely used ... yet.)

If you are the only reviewer and you are confident about giving a positive review, you set positive_review. If there are several active reviewers, some communication using comments is needed.
