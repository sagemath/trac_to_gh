$ mathematica --version
10.0
```

I get similar doctest failures with Sage 6.7 and Mathematica 10 running on OS X.  It looks to me like it's an issue with how Sage is formatting things; the output of the doctests often looks like it is TeX'ed.  In particular, I think somehow the _latex_ method of `sage.interfaces.mathematica.MathematicaElement` is being called instead of just __repr__ as you would expect.  Here's a simple example: 



```

                 \begin{array}{cc}
                  1 & 2 \                  3 & 4 \                 \end{array}
                 \right)

I did few checks and it looks like __repr__ is the method being called; to see this just do the following changes

there is something going on with 'N()' that I don't get:

Matthias, it seems that in your setup N() and n() methods of Mathematica objects are mixed up. For me on Linux, with 64-bit Mathematica 9,  I have

```
sage: t=mathematica('Pi')
sage: t.n?

   precision.

No. I copy-pasted from the banner that it displays at start; and also verified by calling ` mathematica.SystemInformation()`.
 
Note that in the docstrings that you copied, it guarantees "at least" ... digits.
So the tests should probably not rely on a particular number of digits.

In more detail:

Then `get()` is called, and it does (line 528 of `mathematica.py`)

```
return self.eval('InputForm[%s, NumberMarks->False]'%var, strip=True)
```

stripping `10` after the tick away (this is what `NumberMarks->False` does)! Oops...
One workaround would be to provide an implementation of `N()` avoiding `get` all together.

well, I am struggling to understand the error here:
E.g. how would you explain the following:

it is a symbolic Mathematica expression `prec[Pi]`. It cannot be evaluated to anything.
Evaluating `mathematica('Pi').n()`, on Mathematica side I see the following:

```
In[1]:= sage0=Pi;
In[2]:= sage1=0;
In[3]:= sage2=gen[sage1];
In[4]:= sage1=prec[sage0];
In[5]:= sage3=1;
In[6]:= sage3=53;
In[7]:= sage1 < sage3
Out[7]= prec[Pi] < 53
In[8]:= sage1 > sage3
Out[8]= prec[Pi] > 53
In[9]:= sage1 == sage3
Out[9]= prec[Pi] == 53
In[10]:= sage1
Out[10]= prec[Pi]
```


(in comment 22 I posted the corresponding log for `.n(10)` (I made a typo, wrote that it is `.n()`, now corrected there).

OK, I have implemented `n()`, and it works. 

But I am at loss as to how to implement `N()` (i.e. the Mathematica function call).
The problem is that `get()` method of Mathematica class in 
https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/develop/src/sage/interfaces/mathematica.py#L517
should get the parameter `ascii_art` set to True while it calls Mathematica via Expect.
And I cannot find an interface that would do this for me.

The thing is that

```
self.parent().N(self, *args)
```

doe not work properly, as data is kept in `InputFormat` on Mathematica side, e.g. 1.111111111111 with
precision 5 is not kept the way one expects, 1.1111, but as 1.111111111111<backtick>5. And that <backtick> gets stripped off by `get()`, getting the precision info lost in the process. 

So I ended up calling `self.parent().eval()` directly, took me the whole morning to figure out the right way. Anyhow, ready for review now!

With Mathematica 10.3.1 for Mac OS X x86 (64-bit), all tests passed. 

The old doctests showed that the results of `math_bessel_K(nu,x)` were different on 32-bit and 64-bit machines.

Have they become identical now? 

Also, I was puzzled by the discrepancy between

```
sage: mathematica('Pi').N(10)
         3.141592654
```

and

```
sage: mathematica('Pi').n(10)
3.1
```

After reading up on the code, I understand that `MathematicaElement.N()` sets the precision in decimal digits, whereas `MathematicaElement.n()` sets the precision in bits, so that the two examples above behave as

```
sage: pi.n(digits=10)
3.141592654
```

and

```
sage: pi.n(10)
3.1
```

respectively.
Is such difference between `.N()` and `.n()` intended for `MathematicaElement`? Then maybe this should be specified in the documentations? Does it make sense to implement `mathematica('Pi').n(digits=10)` as well?

the difference was due to a bug that is now fixed, I think.

they should be.
I don't have 32-bit Mathematical to test, but I think it should be the same.

the idea is that N() is a Mathematica function, and n() is a Sage function.
