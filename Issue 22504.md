# Issue 22504: use svg logo in html documentation

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22741

Original creator: chapoton

Original creation time: 2017-04-02 08:06:52

In the top-left and bottom-left corner of html documentation, there is currently a png "sage" icon.

See for example http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/index.html

I propose to use instead an svg file.

The look of the svg logo is not quite the same as the png file.
