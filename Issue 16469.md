CC:  jdemeyer leif vbraun fbissey

Keywords: iml spkg

I've been in contact with Arne and he's very cooperative to psuh a new release on IML website.

Experimental tarball at:
* http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jpflori/iml-1.0.4/iml-1.0.4.tar.bz2

Should:
* use different cblas and in particular pass something diffrenet from "-lcblas -latlas" to the linker,
* and so correctly link the shared lib,
* and so let shared libs be built on Cygwin (#15389),
* anything else you want to fix.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16706

Any comments, rants, suggestions welcome.

Particular attention could be cast upon:
* the new --with-cblas configure option/m4 macros,

* libtool versioning, I've just updated the revision part as should be, but before that it was naively set.

Sure, it's not an official release and I don't want people to think so.
It is though supposed to become the official one.
Therefore I've added a `.prerelease` to the archive so that people trying it out will have to perform a non trivial action and be aware of what they do.

Is it installed in standard location?

Blush. OK I found the problem. While openblas install a cblas.h in the standard location it wants to load another header, not in a standard location. Not sure how I managed to configure it once without that additional header.

After further tinkering around with the cblas-check.m4 I think it is OK as it is. No need to over-engineer it.

Now one thing that tripped me is the fact that your tarball include a config.log where cblas and atlas are not found.

Also, now that I have it open in front of my eyes you may want to bump the following line to 1.0.4 near the top of configure.ac

```
AC_INIT(IML, 1.0.3)

After some thoughts if I fix things specifically for openblas it may blow in my face for some other proprietary implementations. There are two things:
* I cannot think of any other packages that looks for the cblas.h header, doesn't mean it is wrong to look for it, just unusual - most other package assume it or bring it with them.
* You could relax the need to have both variables defined at the same time and make configure spit a message asking whether both need to be set in case of failure.

Failing that, I will port the patch for iml 1.0.3 to just use pkg-config in the gentoo ebuild.

You mean there is an "#include ..." in cblas.h which points to a header not found?? so you have to sepcify a bunch of "-I" to be able to use it?

Sure pkg-config would be nice, I just don't want to add that as a dependency to IML as it's not my software, I'm just helping Arne here.

And I assume this "first" cblas.h header is also in a non standard location?

It's complicated. We allow people to install several blas/cblas/lapack side by side. One thing that is done to achieve that, is that headers, indeed, are put in a non-standard location (/usr/include/${somename}). Then you have a mechanism to choose one as the system default. That mechanism will link the corresponding cblas.h in /usr/include but no other headers. After the adventures of today I am not sure it even make sense to create that link.

That's the state of cblas headers as far as I know
* atlas has an atlas.h header and a whole atlas subfolder - but cblas.h is nicely self contained.
* gotoblas2/openblas calls an extra header
* netlib has just cblas.h
* gsl has gsl_cblas.h which is fortunately self contained
* blis sort of has a (c)blas layer in blis/bli_blas.h that is full of blis subheader
That's all for open source as far as I know. I don't know what the proprietary look like (well I do for IBM ESSL but I'd rather not make this an ESSL flame).

I have had one success at configuring it and I am not sure how it happened. In fact I am starting to think I hallucinated that success or somehow was looking at some other code.

Got it!

```
		if test "x${CBLAS_HEADER}" != "x/usr/include" -a "x${CBLAS_HEADER}" != "x/usr/local/include"; then
			for CBLAS_LIBRARY in ${CBLAS_LIBRARY_PATH}

					CBLAS_LIBS="${CBLAS_LIBS} -L${CBLAS_LIBRARY}"
				fi
			done
```

CBLAS_CFLAGS needs to be set outside of the test for CBLAS_LIBRARY. If you only have standard paths in CBLAS_LIBRARY_PATH, CBLAS_CFLAGS is never set. I would do

```
		if test "x${CBLAS_HEADER}" != "x/usr/include" -a "x${CBLAS_HEADER}" != "x/usr/local/include"; then
                        CBLAS_CFLAGS="-I${CBLAS_HEADER}"

				if test "x${CBLAS_LIBRARY}" != "x/usr/lib" -a "x${CBLAS_LIBRARY}" != "x/usr/local/lib"; then
					CBLAS_LIBS="${CBLAS_LIBS} -L${CBLAS_LIBRARY}"
				fi
			done
```

instead. Nit-picky, should you do 

```
CBLAS_LIBS="-L${CBLAS_LIBRARY} ${CBLAS_LIBS}"
```

instead of 

```
CBLAS_LIBS="${CBLAS_LIBS} -L${CBLAS_LIBRARY}"
```

not sure if there are picky linker that would bother.

	if test -r "${CBLAS_HEADER}/cblas.h"; then

The current way, even with my small change in the previous comment, assume that if the header is in the standard place then the library is as well. This code makes no such assumption.

More precisely, the `CBLAS_LIBS="-lcblas -latlas"` is used when no `--with-cblas` option is given, which is currently the case in `spkg-install`. I think this is what we want, so I personally see no further obstructions for this ticket.

I don't agree.
Picking up the right linker flags, include path, lmib path for any CBLAS implem is black magic.
I'm not even sure the autotools suite provides anything to pick properly a working CBLAS implem on every system.
Using pkg-config could ease all of that but I wouldn't say it's an option for us or IML.

We are going slightly off-topic but that's something that the science group in Gentoo has studied for a while. Right any cblas/blas/lapack is installing a .pc file and every ebuild is required to use it. We are thinking of replacing those by a linker script with a standard name in the future.

If you write a comprehensive macro that covers all the cases that's very good, pass it on and I can tell you I will torture it to death and give you the appropriate feedback.

Ok used gsl_cblas.h headers to make it compile. We may want to install this file as SAGE_LOCAL/include/cblas.h on OS X just in case. Bonus: as I mentioned on the mailing list iml now pass its test suite on OS X.

On an old Mac (slightly newer than my usual test machine, but still OS X 10.4 PPC) iml bails out with complaining about not having ATLAS 3.0 or greater.  These built Sage 6.4.beta6 fine (other than rpy2) so it must be something about this upgrade that changes it - I assume iml always asked for that, see for instance [this nearly 8-year-old discussion](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-forum/sHwJyMp7Wmo)!

Could it possibly be the removal of

```
--with-atlas-include="`pwd`" --with-atlas-lib=/usr/lib
```

Reading http://web.mit.edu/sage/export/iml-1.0.2/config/atlas-check.m4 certainly seems to indicate so.

Even though in general we will have to drop easy support for that old of a machine because gcc 4.0.1 won't compile gcc 4.9.x (you'd think it would have made sense for gcc to number it 5.0 when they changed the language they wrote it in!), I do want to make one final binary for Sage 6.4.1 at least, so I would appreciate any assistance.

For the record, the simple change to

```
EXTRA_BLAS=""
if [ $UNAME = "Darwin" ]; then
    # copy cblas headers from gsl
    cp ../patches/gsl_cblas.h cblas.h
    EXTRA_BLAS="--with-cblas=-lgslcblas"
fi
```

works on that older platform, apparently.
