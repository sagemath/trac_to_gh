See #13793, RÃ©mi Maurice and I propose an library of combinatorial Hopf algebras which contains Loday-Ronco.

there is a "small" problem because of ... UniqueRepresentation or... 


```
sage: Pt = PBT(QQ, True).P()
sage: Pf = PBT(QQ, False).P()
sage: Pf == Pt
True
```


I'm too tired to check the origin...
