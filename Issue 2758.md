Debian switched from g77 to gfortran while I wasn't looking; these patches should update the Debian packages for iml and linbox to deal with the transition.

Both patches look good to me. Positive review. The linbox patch has been merged in linbox-1.1.5rc2.p7, the iml patch has been merged in iml-1.0.1.p10.

Cheers,

Michael
