Sparse integer matrices get sent to the generic Smith form routine, where they fail (see #10625).  They should instead get dense-ified
and routed to the integer-only version.  This solves some failures on #10604.


```
sage: A = matrix(2, range(4), sparse=True)
sage: A.smith_form()

Patch mirrors docstring for dense matrices and just ships off a dense version of the matrix to that code.  `matrix/matrix_integer_sparse.pyx` is not included into the documentation, so I've added that chore to my list.
