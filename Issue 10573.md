# Issue 10573: Route sparse integer matrices to a working Smith form

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/10626

Sparse integer matrices get sent to the generic Smith form routine, where they fail (see #10625).  They should instead get dense-ified
and routed to the integer-only version.  This solves some failures on #10604.


```
sage: A = matrix(2, range(4), sparse=True)
sage: A.smith_form()

Changing status from new to needs_review.

Patch mirrors docstring for dense matrices and just ships off a dense version of the matrix to that code.  `matrix/matrix_integer_sparse.pyx` is not included into the documentation, so I've added that chore to my list.

I've just uploaded a patch at #10625, which makes the examples here work. That said, densifying a matrix and calculating Smith form of that using integer-specific routines is going to be much faster than calling a slow generic routine; so this patch should still be applied. Applies fine to 4.6.2.alpha0 and all doctests pass, so positive review.

Changing keywords from "" to "Smith form".
