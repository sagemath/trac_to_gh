Perhaps #30001 happens to fix it?

No, doesn't help. At least not as it is now.


---

Comment by @kliem created at 2020-06-30 19:23:37

According to this

https://www.noreplied.com/how-to-fixed-cannot-change-locale-utf-8-error-in-centos-7/

one should add `LC_CTYPE="en_US.UTF-8"` to `/etc/environment`. Very unsatisfying fix for someone without root privileges.

This appears to be a bug with centos 7, which is merely exposed now.


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2020-06-30 19:36:36

Just exporting this environment variable setting in `build/bin/sage-spkg` should be enough. No need for a systemwide setting

Also the upgrade to Sphinx 3.1.2 is complete at #30001 and was merged in Sage 9.2.beta5.

On Ubuntu 18.04 + beta12 + #30053 (+ #30606, the other branch I am working on now), I do not confirm this issue for building sphinx: `sage -f sphinx` works correctly. version 3.1.2.p0 to be more precise.


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2020-09-21 12:44:36

the error in the ticket description comes from Python 3.6. Is this outdated, in view of #30053, as the locale is staying `C` locale?

What is the commit in comment:20 doing? I am lost.

`build/bin/sage-system-python` finds the Python that we use for downloading and unpacking packages. 

It is unrelated to the python that we try to find in `build/pkgs/python3/spkg-configure.m4` (which rejects Python 3.6 after #30053).

`build/bin/sage-system-python` can use any of the Pythons listed in `build/tox.ini`. In particular, it can be an early 3.x series Python. For these, `LC_ALL=C` disables UTF-8 operation, which causes the errors described on this ticket. 

Look at the GH Actions links in the ticket description to see it in action.

You probably have a better version of python in the front of the path than what is the default on Ubuntu 18.04. You can check this with `build/bin/sage-system-python --version`.

Comment by mjo created at 2020-09-21 18:57:17

Why again are we trying to extract a tarball with python?

The problem here isn't really the `C` locale, it's that Sphinx ships files with non-ascii characters in them...


```
$ ls tests/roots/test-images/ | tail -n 1
-rw-r--r-- 1 mjo mjo  65K 2020-08-13 11:46 testimÃ¤ge.png
```


and we don't specify an encoding, which ultimately leaves it up to the locale.

Ignoring the fact that reimplementing this is absurd, we should be able to set the filename encoding to utf8 here without touching the locale at all.

Yes, it is specifically the problem with setting the `C` locale explicitly. This is explained well in https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0538/

We are using the `tarfile` module as supplied by the system python.


---

Comment by mjo created at 2020-09-21 19:47:22

I'm not willing to install a version of python from 2014 to test it, but setting `tarfile.ENCODING = 'utf-8'` probably solves this in a much better way, since we know what the encoding is.

You don't have to. We have the GH Actions to test it. The link with the runs and results is in the "Reviewer field".

No, that is absolutely not the correct fix because the default (obtained using `sys.getfilesystemencoding()` or `sys.getdefaultencoding()`) is correct. See https://docs.python.org/2.6/library/tarfile.html#tar-unicode (Python 2.6 is the earliest version that we support for `sage-system-python`).

The specific problem is that if someone puts a `LC_ALL=C`, the default encodings are set to ASCII. This is what causes the breakage, and this is what the current ticket fixes.

Needs review.


---

Comment by mjo created at 2020-09-21 20:19:40

Setting the locale to `C` causes the default guess to be wrong, but we _know_ the correct encoding. And the `utf-8` encoding is available "everywhere," unlike the locales that we're guessing at in your branch. Finally, changing the system locale to affect one tarfile is like setting your house on fire to stop the faucet from leaking.

It is very localized, and it undoes the damage done by #30053's `sage-spkg` doing exactly what you seem to be criticizing here - namely setting the system locale for all its subprocesses.

Replying to [comment:36 mjo]:

This is of course a good point. We can just decide that our tarballs have utf-8 pathnames.  I will test the approach with setting `tarfile.ENCODING`.

Nevertheless, removing the `C` locale setting in `sage-system-python` would still be good because there could be other parts that are affected by this unsuitable setting.

And #30053 just put things back the way they were before we tried to switch to `C.UTF-8`. We need to set _some_ locale, because otherwise the behavior of standard utilities in spkg-install and spkg-check scripts is unknowable. For example, this branch can choose the `en_US.utf8` locale. How do grep ranges work there? According to https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/manual/html_node/Character-Classes-and-Bracket-Expressions.html,

> In the default C locale, the sorting sequence is the native character order; for example, â[a-d]â is equivalent to â[abcd]â. In other locales, the sorting sequence is not specified, and â[a-d]â might be equivalent to â[abcd]â or to â[aBbCcDd]â, or it might fail to match any character, or the set of characters that it matches might even be erratic. To obtain the traditional interpretation of bracket expressions, you can use the âCâ locale by setting the LC_ALL environment variable to the value âCâ.

Mucking with this is bad luck.

Yes, it was a good change for that ticket, which is why I agreed with the change there.

But it affects the Pythons that run below it.
(1) the `sage-system-python` - which the present ticket addresses
(2) the python3 from which we build our venv -- which is yet to be addressed in #30576 if we want to support python 3.6.

I have:

```
$ build/bin/sage-system-python --version
Python 2.7.17
```


I don't know how to properly review this ticket. With ubuntu-bionic 18.04, I do not have problem. So what I can do is to check that with the branch, I still don't have a problem. Should I do some kind of make distclean? For now, I just pulled that branch on top of freshly built beta13, and I am currently running make ptestlong. Will report later.

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2020-09-22 20:18:05

The tests have already run on GH Actions. It is not necessary to run them again to review this ticket.


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2020-09-22 20:20:07

The problem shows on machines where sage-system-python is python 3.x with x < 7.

It's probably not a good idea to try to uninstall python2 to review this ticket, but you could try to shadow it

Replying to [comment:48 mkoeppe]:

tell me how to shadow, I will try that tomorrow. How can I make `sage-system-python` to use:


```
$ which python3.6
/usr/bin/python3.6
```

?


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2020-09-22 22:36:09


```
mkdir /somewhere && ln -s /usr/bin/python3.6 /somewhere/python 
export PATH=/somewhere:$PATH
```

Comment by mjo created at 2020-09-23 01:07:44

Doesn't the tarball commit alone fix issue without the locale voodoo?


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2020-09-23 01:09:37

It does fix the issue, but it is best not to pass a locale to python 3.6 that we know to break things.

Indeed, the above shadowing method works:

```
$ build/bin/sage-system-python --version
Python 3.6.9
```

I can now reproduce the issue with Ubuntu 18.04 + 9.2.beta13 and I confirm that the current branch fixes it.
