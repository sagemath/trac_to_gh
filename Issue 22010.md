ok, looks good. But maybe one could also add some SEEALSO "backward" from the existing functions to the new function ?

I have added some backward links. I'm not sure to understand the semantic with the way to add links, but the links are properly generated on my computer.

Another question is for #22206: How to ensure that the modifications made here are taken into account in #22206 ? One should explain them (and me).
Best,
David.
