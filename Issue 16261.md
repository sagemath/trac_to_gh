I think there are further things that should be in the thematic tutorial but they don't have to go in this patch. For example, the methods of root lattice and weight lattice realizations for affine case.
It is best that this be a separate patch because the changes here are noncontroversial and presumably can be merged quickly.

There is a typo in the single KR crystal section:

vertify -> verify

Also, since you mention projections, it should be mentioned which projection (onto what) gives the KR crystals.
