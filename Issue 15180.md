# Issue 15180: timeout in documentation of timeit

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: dkrenn

Original creation time: 2013-11-14 10:16:22

Keywords: timeit, timeout, beginner

In the docstring of `timeit` you find

```
It is also based on IPython's %timeout command.
```

Should this be `%timeit`? 

(I tried `%timeout`, which didn't work und I did a short internet search and couldn't find an such a command. Feel free to close this ticket, if `%timeout` is correct.)
