The Murnaghan-Nakayama formula is a recursive formula for  a character value of the symmetric group (for the statement, look at the second paragraph of Mark Wildon's answer http://mathoverflow.net/a/134620/9672 on mathoverflow, or Theorem 2.4.7 in _Representation Theory of the Symmetric Group_ by James and Kerber).

Changing keywords from "partitions" to "partitions, days60".

a couple of quick comments:

the 1st line of the docstring should be separated from the rest by an empty line, i.e.
not

```
+        r"""
+        Return `\chi^{\lambda/\mu}(\alpha)` value in Murnaghan-Nakayama formula
+        (Enumerative Combinatorics (Stanley) equation 7.75)
...
```

but

```
+        r"""
+        Return `\chi^{\lambda/\mu}(\alpha)` value in Murnaghan-Nakayama formula
+
+        (Enumerative Combinatorics (Stanley) equation 7.75)
...
```


The reference should be made properly (by the way, which volume it is , I guess vol. 2?)
we already have it, so just use `[EnumComb2]_`

-------

I am not sure that the recursive function should be public, and not an internal function in the non-recursive one. Also, the debugging flag should be a function parameter (default value `False`)

Some additional comments:

I don't see the point of making these static methods attached to `Partition`. That is not the natural place I would look for them. Furthermore, `get_chi` is a very non-descriptive name and needs to be changed. Actually, these might best as a normal method attached to `SkewPartition` (with a redirect in `Partition` with the skew being the empty partition).

I agree with Dima that the `get_chi_recursive` should not be public since it is essentially an internal function.

The `ALGORITHM:` block is over-indented (this is because it only (as it should) has one colon).

Do not return `None` if there is a check failure; raise an error message as intended.

Why are the keys for `refDict` strings and not the data as a tuple?

Please follow Python naming conventions (`lower_case` variable names). Also, try to avoid the extra blanklines.

Thanks for the comment.

Working on all issues Dima and tscrim mentioned. I have a few questions though.

1. Are all the docstring rules the same for internal function? (i.e. Do I just copy/paste the entire docstring for the current get_chi_recursive())?
2. The reason why I use static is 
    i. it seems unnatural to call something like lda.get_chi(mu, alpha). And user will have to make Partition Object first before they can call the function. 
    ii. I do not rely on any methods from Partition/Skewed-Partition Object and I cannot figure out how to extract the underlying list from a Partition Object (.get_part() does not look like a nice option...)
3. By redirecting, you mean on the docstring or make a redirect in function call? Please teach me how to do if you mean docstring.

by the way, did you look at ``@`CachedFunction` decorator, which provides memoization, so you don't need to carry around `refDict` at all?

this would make the code cleaner, and you could roll the two functions, recursive and non-recursive, into one.
