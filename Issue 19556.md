# Issue 19556: arb fails on systems without specialized FLINT implementation

Issue created by migration from Trac.

On systems without a specialized assembly implementation of `umul_ppmm`, the `arb` package breaks because it uses same temporary variable names.

*Upstream bug*: https://github.com/fredrik-johansson/arb/pull/78

This breaks on i386. I'm going to revert this to just adding the one patch and move the actual upgrade to #19811.

`@`fredrik.johansson: can you review this branch? It's really just adding the upstream patch to arb 2.7.0.

The patch seems fine from inspection. What am I expected to do to review this branch?

I think that is sufficient. I cannot expect you to test it on `ppc64le`, but I assure you that it works. And the bug is obvious in retrospect.
