# Issue 15576: make cunningham_tables-1.0.spkg standard and upgrade it

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: rws

Original creation time: 2014-02-13 09:00:56

CC:  roed

The optional spkg cunningham_tables-1.0 has no tickets, and is now available since sage-4.3.1. It is remarkably small.

According to #7240, the newest version would be http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/roed/cunningham_tables-2.2.spkg

Needed for #7240.

I reverted David's unrelated changes to `databases/install.py`

`@`roed: David, if you want to deprecate `database_install()` please open a separate ticket.

We need a plain tarball (gz/bz2) for standard packages. David, can you make one?

Some problem when buiding in patchbot. Set flag again when tarball available.

The package is now not even experimental. The spkg is no longer available. The issue is superseded by #12133 because the Brent database contained the Cunningham tables.

So this is a duplicate.
