I would say that the following is a bug:


```
sage: A = PolynomialRing(GF(3), name='t')
sage: K = A.fraction_field()
sage: t = K.gen()
sage: t.derivative(t)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: cannot differentiate with respect to t
```


The reason is that the method `derivative` tries to take the derivative of the numerator with respect to the given variable but the variable here lives in the fraction field and not in the polynomial ring.

Should we fix this?
