The command

```
sage -t --optional=sage,internet src/sage/combinat/tutorial.py
```


gives


```
sage -t src/sage/combinat/tutorial.py
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/combinat/tutorial.py", line 224, in sage.combinat.tutorial
Failed example:
    oeis([1,1,2,5,14])                            # optional -- internet
Expected:
    0: A000108: Catalan numbers: C(n) = binomial(2n,n)/(n+1) = (2n)!/(n!(n+1)!). Also called Segner numbers.
    1: A120588: G.f. satisfies: 3*A(x) = 2 + x + A(x)^2, with a(0) = 1.
    2: ...
Got:
    0: A000108: Catalan numbers: C(n) = binomial(2n,n)/(n+1) = (2n)!/(n!(n+1)!). Also called Segner numbers.
    1: A124302: Number of set partitions with at most 3 blocks; number of Dyck paths of height at most 4; dimension of space of symmetric polynomials in 3 noncommuting variables.
    2: A120588: G.f. satisfies: 3*A(x) = 2 + x + A(x)^2, with a(0) = 1.
