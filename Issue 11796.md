Keywords: random matrix

The very first example in the docstring for `random_matrix` says


```
Random integer matrices.  With no arguments, the majority of the
entries are -1 and 1, never zero, and rarely "large."
    
          sage: random_matrix(ZZ, 5, 5)
          [ -8   2   0   0   1]
          [ -1   2   1 -95  -1]
          [ -2 -12   0   0   1]
          [ -1   1  -1  -2  -1]
          [  4  -4  -6   5   0]
```


Hang on!  What are those five zeroes doing in there?

The problem seems not to be that the given matrix contains 0s, but rather that the text above says it shouldn't contain 0s, as this command will many times give a matrix that indeed contains 0 entries. So, which should be fixed? The actual code or the wrong documentation? Is it that big of a deal to have a random matrix with 0 entries?

I think this is due to the default value of the density= keyword being changed from 1.0.


```
A = random_matrix(ZZ,5); A

```


```
[  2  -1   1  11   1]
[  0   1   1   1   1]
[  0   0   3   4   1]
[ 25   1   1   0 -27]
[ -2   1  -1   4  -2]

```


```
A = random_matrix(ZZ,5,density=1.0); A

```


```
[  2 -15 -23  -1  -4]
[  1  -3  -1   6  -1]
[  5   2  -2  -1  -1]
[ -1   2  -1   2   1]
[  1  -1  -2  -2   1]
```

If we're going to have a density keyword, then the documentation should at least state that you can create a matrix with no zero entries by setting density=1.0.

I've also created a ticket #13555 arguing for more doctesting of random functions.

Oh god, the documentation/behaviour isn't even consistent with x= and y= keywords.


```
A = random_matrix(ZZ,5,x=4,y=10); A

[7 5 7 6 4]
[8 8 7 5 4]
[8 4 7 9 9]
[4 6 7 4 6]
[9 6 9 6 6]

```

So this gives us behaviour that agrees with the documentation, but seems to use density=1.0.

Just ran across this again.  So clearly at odds with what is stated - yet another example:

```
Also, the default is to not create zero entries,
        unless the ``density`` keyword is set to something strictly less
        than one.
```

What is going on?

```
    if algorithm == 'randomize':
        density = kwds.pop('density', None)
        # zero matrix is immutable, copy is mutable
        A = copy(parent.zero_matrix())
        if density is None:
            A.randomize(density=float(1), nonzero=False, *args, **kwds)
        else:
            A.randomize(density=density, nonzero=True, *args, **kwds)
        return A
```

Okay, so this is the default.  But oops - if `density is None` (default) then `nonzero=False`!!!  So putting density in the right place is then frustrated by using the wrong nonzero value.  And why is the other one `True`?

I would argue this is a bug, not bad documentation.

This contains only changes to the documentation, so that it matches the code.  I've tried to clarify the documentation of the matrix `.randomize()` method so the action of the `density` and `nonzero` keywords are clearer.  Hopefully their use in the `random_matrix()` constructor will then be clearer as well.
