Sage is mainly hit by the renaming of the Py2 module `__builtin__` into {{builtins}}} in Py3. Others are e.g. `cPickle`,
`copy_reg`, `StringIO`, `cStringIO` and `httplib`.

The tool 2to3 renames the modules. 


But the code has to depend on the Python version!

There are 39 effected modules. 

This ticket is tracked as a dependency of meta-ticket ticket:16052.
