# Issue 29526: Direct convertion from Univariate Polynomial Ring over Rational function field to Symbolic Ring doesn't work

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29763

Original creator: @petRUShka

Original creation time: 2020-05-30 13:25:43

Keywords: symbolic ring, conversion

Lets consider following code


```
F = FunctionField(QQ, 't')
R.<u> = F[]
poly = u^2 + (t^2 + 1)*u - t^2 - t

SR(poly)
# TypeError: no common canonical parent for objects with parents: 'Rational function field in t over Rational Field' and 'Symbolic Ring'
```


whereas convrsion through Multivariate Polynomial Ring works as expected:


```

P.<t,u> = QQ[]
SR(P(poly))
# t^2*u - t^2 + u^2 - t + u
```

Changing component from PLEASE CHANGE to symbolics.

Usual caveat:

```
F=FunctionField(QQ,'t')['t']
```

However confusing it is, we cannot forbid name collisions as such above because of automatic ring constructions:

```
Matrix(FunctionField(QQ,'x'),2,2,[1,0,0,x]).charpoly()
```

Needless to say, conversion of these objects to SR would give rather surprising results.

You are right, but it is possible to notify user that there is dangerous place in his code through warning or with some other instrument.

It is very convenient to have that conversion at least in predictable cases like I've mentioned in the issue.

Sage development has entered the release candidate phase for 9.3. Setting a new milestone for this ticket based on a cursory review of ticket status, priority, and last modification date.
