Current code (in a Jupyter notebbok) mutates at last clicked value as opposed to the current clicked value, and always mutates at 0 first.

Changing component from PLEASE CHANGE to combinatorics.

First step: ensure that any cluster seed comes with a "user_label", even if it needs to be automatically populated to be [0,1,2,...n-1].  

Later: this attribute name will be renamed to make it clear it is not only user_label.
