I've reviewed the patch and have the following comments:

1. `result.exact_part() == result`: Maybe create a follow up ticket implementing `is_exact`.

2. The code

```
            if isinstance(summand, ExactTerm):
                expansion = asymptotic_expansions.\
                    SingularityAnalysis('Z', alpha=alpha, zeta=singularity,
                                        precision=precision).subs(Z=self.gen())
                return summand.coefficient * expansion
            elif isinstance(summand, OTerm):
                return (self.gen() ** (alpha - 1)).O()
```

    is not ideal. It looks like the singularity analysis should be done by the terms themselves and eventually by the growth groups (since they know what they are).

3. `(self.gen() ** (alpha - 1)).O()` should depend on the singularity.

4. In some sense the transfer term `(self.gen() ** (alpha - 1)).O()` has the same status as the expansion `asymptotic_expansions.SingularityAnalysis`. So a generation in the generations would be an option. However, I understand, that it is much simpler, so I do *not* have a strong preference for this.

5. Parameter description `function`: mentioned the word "callable"(?) Say that it is a function in one variable.

6. Parameter `return_singular_expansions`: in an ideal world, there would not be a different kind of output (asymptotic expansions vs. named tuple). However, I understand it is as it is; it seems that there is no other satisfying solution to this. Am I right?

A few thoughts on your comments:

* `asymptotic_expansions.SingularityAnalysis` with `precision=0` could very well return the transfer error term; I think that this would be consistent with `precision=0`. And `precision=0` does not work anyway at the moment.
* Then, indeed, an ExactTerm could do singularity analysis by calling singularity analysis on the growth element and multiply by its coefficient; and an OTerm could do singularity analysis by calling singularity analysis on the growth element with `precision=0`.
* A monomial growth group would do singularity analysis by checking whether it is a growth group in `T` (then call the generator with `alpha=...` and `beta=0`) or a growth group in `log(T)` (call a yet to be written generator for `(1-z)^alpha (log(1-u))^beta`)
* A cartesian growth group would restrict its attention to cases where all non-trivial contributions come from one factor (hand the question down to the factor) or from two factors (in that case, the cartesian growth group has to do the job on its own calling the above mentioned generator).

The method is now completely rewritten; `7.1.beta1` has been merged implicitly by merging #19981.

Replying to [comment:9 dkrenn]:
> 1. `result.exact_part() == result`: Maybe create a follow up ticket implementing `is_exact`.

done (#19981)


> 2. The code ...
>     is not ideal. It looks like the singularity analysis should be done by the terms themselves and eventually by the growth groups (since they know what they are).

Done.

> 3. `(self.gen() ** (alpha - 1)).O()` should depend on the singularity.

Implicitly done by 2.

> 4. In some sense the transfer term `(self.gen() ** (alpha - 1)).O()` has the same status as the expansion `asymptotic_expansions.SingularityAnalysis`. So a generation in the generations would be an option. However, I understand, that it is much simpler, so I do *not* have a strong preference for this.

Done (via `precision=0`).

> 5. Parameter description `function`: mentioned the word "callable"(?) Say that it is a function in one variable.

Done.

> 6. Parameter `return_singular_expansions`: in an ideal world, there would not be a different kind of output (asymptotic expansions vs. named tuple). However, I understand it is as it is; it seems that there is no other satisfying solution to this. Am I right?

No better solution found.

Thanks you for your rewrite; it is much better and cleaner now; I consider the code as positively reviewed. However, please cross-review my minor changes and the following two documentation issues should be discussed (both concerning the private `_singularity_analysis_`-mathods:

1. Is `(1-z\zeta) \to 0` correct or should it be `(1-z/\zeta) \to 0`? Maybe using `z\to\zeta` instead of `(1-z/\zeta) \to 0`? (I don't have a strong preference for changing, but from an outside view, this would be easier to understand.

2. Should it be mentioned that (in terms and growth groups) a variable (`_var_` of the parent) represents/equals `1 / (1-z/\zeta)` ?

> 1. Is `(1-z\zeta) \to 0` correct or should it be `(1-z/\zeta) \to 0`? Maybe using `z\to\zeta` instead of `(1-z/\zeta) \to 0`? (I don't have a strong preference for changing, but from an outside view, this would be easier to understand.

I prefer `(1-z/\zeta) \to 0` or perhaps `T = 1/(1-z/\zeta) \to \infty`.

> 2. Should it be mentioned that (in terms and growth groups) a variable (`_var_` of the parent) represents/equals `1 / (1-z/\zeta)` ? 

This should change once asymptotics `z->z_0` are implemented.

What about  "`T = 1/(1-z/\zeta) \to \infty` where this element is a growth element (resp. monomial) in `T`"?

OK, I'll change the `_singularity_analysis_` routines.

Once we have #20050, the parameter `zeta` will be removed.
