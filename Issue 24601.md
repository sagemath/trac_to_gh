CC:  fbissey @timokau

In the new version:
* fix memleak in in-place PyObject numerics (#24745)
* Python interface / Py3 fixes and improvements (thx Erik Bray, #24561, #24752)
* fix internal `asin`/`acos` of complex balls
* draw factors out of `add^rational` (#24768)
* `exp(f(x))`, `exp(c*f(x))`, f inv. hyperbolic simplifications
* always extend trig/hyperbolic functions to complex domain (#24428)
* extensive code readability improvements

Despite what you think, you are not using mpfr, but PARI:

```python
    def arccosh(self):
        """
        Return the hyperbolic arccosine of ``self``.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: (1+CC(I)).arccosh()

        """
        return self._parent(self.__pari__().acosh())

If you want to compare with something, it should be mpc (in Sage: `CC = MPComplexField(53)`)

```

The analogous thing as [comment:9] should be fixed for pure imaginary results:

```
sage: CDF(1/2).arccosh()
1.0471975511965979*I
sage: SR(CDF(1/2)).arccosh()
-6.372599439108525e-21 + 1.0471975511965979*I
```

Then you also revert [comment:29]

Pynac is not involved in the numerics (`hypergeometric_U` is not a `GinacFunction`), so the hypothesis is that the expression before `.n()` is different with 32bit pynac-0.7.22.

This isn't really about this specific ticket (thanks for putting in the work for the upgrade), but is there a reason everybody seems to make seperate "pkg version / chksum" and "doctest fixes" patches?

Shouldn't each commit be one unit of changes for which the doctests still pass?

A much more practical reason is the use of `git-bisect` or just generally being able to check out some interesting commit and build from it.
