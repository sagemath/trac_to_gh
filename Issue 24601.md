CC:  @kiwifb @timokau

In the new version:
* fix memleak in in-place PyObject numerics (#24745)
* Python interface / Py3 fixes and improvements (thx Erik Bray, #24561, #24752)
* fix internal `asin`/`acos` of complex balls
* draw factors out of `add^rational` (#24768)
* `exp(f(x))`, `exp(c*f(x))`, f inv. hyperbolic simplifications
* always extend trig/hyperbolic functions to complex domain (#24428)
* extensive code readability improvements

Despite what you think, you are not using mpfr, but PARI:

```python
    def arccosh(self):
        """
        Return the hyperbolic arccosine of ``self``.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: (1+CC(I)).arccosh()
            1.06127506190504 + 0.904556894302381*I
        """
        return self._parent(self.__pari__().acosh())
```


If you want to compare with something, it should be mpc (in Sage: `CC = MPComplexField(53)`)

Pynac is not involved in the numerics (`hypergeometric_U` is not a `GinacFunction`), so the hypothesis is that the expression before `.n()` is different with 32bit pynac-0.7.22.

Shouldn't each commit be one unit of changes for which the doctests still pass?
