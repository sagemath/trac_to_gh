Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: pdenapo

Assignee: tbd

I think that the current version of docutils in Sage is rather old
(version 0.5, september 15th 2008)
So I suggest upgrading to the latest stable release (which is 0.7,
(released on 2009-10-11 )

I submit an upgraded spkg

I built with sage-4.6.rc2 with the proposed spkg using 'make testlong'.  All tests passed.  Positive review.

http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/mariah/docutils-0.7.p0.spkg has an updated SPKG.txt as requested.  I also put the spkg under Mercurial control.  These are the only changes from docutils-0.7.spkg.

A little searching on the sage mailing lists found that Pablo De Napoli is pdenapo.  I have added the name as both Author and to [http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/#AccountNamesmappedtoRealNames](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/#AccountNamesmappedtoRealNames).

Pablo - If you want to add your affiliation, you will need to do that yourself.

Mariah, please keep the version number docutils-0.7.spkg (not .p0) because that's what SPKG.txt refers to.
