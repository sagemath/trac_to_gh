Keywords: RSK, permutations, days45

The theory behind it is explained in Britz-Fomin, arXiv:9912126 (and briefly discussed in EC1, exercise 77 in chapter 3). It is a map associating to any poset P a partition \lambda(P) of |P|. For P being a permutation poset, this partition is the shape of the RSK tableaux of the permutation; the tableaux themselves can also be reconstructed by taking the sequences of \lambda(P_i) where P_i are the initial resp. final intervals of P.

This functionality appears in Macaulay ( http://www.math.uiuc.edu/Macaulay2/doc/Macaulay2-1.5/share/doc/Macaulay2/Posets/html/_greene__Kleitman__Partition.html ) but is apparently not exposed in Sage. I also don't like the Macaulay implementation, since (as far as I understand the sourcecode at http://www.math.uiuc.edu/Macaulay2/doc/Macaulay2-1.5/share/Macaulay2/Posets.m2 ) it goes by brute force despite the existence of a polynomial-time algorithm.

So I've implemented the algorithm given in Greene-Kleitman. I'm not doing this as a patch, because I believe the Posets file is currently being worked on and this is likely to require manual merging (also, I am not currently using sage-combinat).

greene_shape is the most important method here. The stuff after it is what I needed for checks; maybe it has its use too, but I wouldn't expect too much.

Reuploaded fixed version, with docstrings and doctests.

I assume it should eventually be merged into Posets, with the functions becoming methods (umm, the ones that aren't useless to begin with). The ford_fulkerson_chronicle method should get an underscore in front of it (right now this would break the doctests).

I have tried to make this into an actual patch but I need some help now. I somehow fucked up with hg mq, and the patch ended up empty.

Note that this will likely need manual merging with #14136 since both patches insert stuff at the same position; but there's no actual conflict.

Hey I've uploaded a review patch which fixes up some of the documenation. The doc of `_ford_fulkerson_chronicle` will still need to be standardized following [the conventions page](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/conventions.html).

As for the potential conflect with #14136, I was able to apply this after but has some fuzz. All that means is it will need a `qrefresh` to be run.

Also the first patch is missing a commit message. Let me know when these are done and I can give it another code review. I'd prefer if someone else (Frederic) can give this a math review.

Best,

Thanks a lot for the comments, Travis!

I've uploaded a new patch [trac_14131-greene_shape_v2.patch], which contains both of our changes and a few more. I've standardized the docstring of the Ford-Fulkerson chronicle, though it wouldn't harm to check whether standardized really means standardized. I've also added a (very simple) method to permutations.py to compute the permutation poset of a permutation, and while being there fixed a couple typos in the RSK docs (the changeset isn't very informative, but what I've done is replacing some "right" by "left" in the doc).

I'm not sure what "fuzz" exactly means; is it something like "the line numbers have shifted, but it's kinda clear where the changes belong"?

I don't know how to add a commit message...

Thank you for the review! There were some stupid doc blunders *oops*. 

I agree with all of your changes except maybe two:

- You replaced range by xrange -- wasn't xrange supposed to be deprecated? (Do let me know what you think, as my other patches have the same situation at times.)

- I'd replace ```s`` -- the source vertex of `G`` by ```s`` -- a vertex of `G`, to be used as the source vertex` and similarly for ```t```. This is to avoid the false impression that ``s`` needs to be a source in the sense of having no arrows going to ``s`` (that's not required).

I don't expect a switch in the short run. Yet I try to avoid using 2.0-only "features" without a compelling reason (but I certainly am unknowingly using some).
