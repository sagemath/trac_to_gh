Ticket retargeted after milestone closed (if you don't believe this ticket is appropriate for the Sage 8.8 release please retarget manually)

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).

In case you have time, could you check whether #27310 works?

Passes all doctests. This seems to be good to go.

In `build/pkgs/fricas/checksums.ini` maybe change:


```diff
-tarball=fricas-VERSION-full.tar.bz2
+tarball=fricas-VERSION.tar.gz
```

why ?

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2020-08-19 16:08:14

I see:

```
upstream_url=https://github.com/fricas/fricas/archive/VERSION.tar.gz
```

I don't think this the URL of a release tarball. This is just the automatic git archive corresponding to the tag. Upstream seems to continue using sourceforge for distributing release tarballs.

Changing status from needs_review to needs_work.

In that case do we need in `checksums.ini` the following (with updated checksums):


```
tarball=fricas-VERSION-full.tar.bz2
...
upstream_url=https://sourceforge.net/projects/fricas/files/fricas/VERSION/fricas-VERSION-full.tar.bz2/download
```


Or are these Sourceforge download urls problematic?

Ideally, rebase on Sage 9.2.beta9.

Works for me on macOS.

Success on Debian too:

```
$ ./sage -i fricas && ./sage -t --optional=fricas,build,dochtml,sage --all
All tests passed!
```

Resolution: fixed

I now have problems with "sage -i fricas", which does not seem to be able to find the tarball in the mirrors..
