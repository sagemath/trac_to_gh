# Issue 27301: Cycle_basis giving wrong results in case of multiedges()

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27538

Original creator: @rajat1433

Original creation time: 2019-03-23 11:48:49

CC:  dcoudert

Keywords: cycle



```
sage: G = Graph([(1,2),(2,3),(2,3),(3,4),(1,4),(1,4),(4,5),(5,6),(4,6),(6,7)],multiedges=True)

sage: G.cycle_basis()

getting 

[[1, 4], [1, 4]]

```


It should be 

```
[[5, 6, 4], [2, 3, 4, 1]]
```

I think this discrepency is due to the is_forest function which in turn is calling is_tree function and in it following lines of code is written to return the found cycle:



```
            if self.has_multiple_edges():
                if output == 'vertex':
                    return (False, list(self.multiple_edges(sort=True)[0][:2]))
                edge1, edge2 = self.multiple_edges(sort=True)[:2]
                if edge1[0] != edge2[0]:
                    return (False, [edge1, edge2])
                return (False, [edge1, (edge2[1], edge2[0], edge2[2])])
```

Problem is due to



```
sage: G = Graph([(1,2),(2,3),(2,3),(3,4),(1,4),(1,4),(4,5),(5,6),(4,6),(6,7)],multiedges=True)

sage: w=G.subgraph(edges=[(1,4,None)])
sage: w
Subgraph of (): Multi-graph on 7 vertices
sage: w.edges()
[(1, 4, None), (1, 4, None)]

```


Subgraph is returning with multiple edges instead it should have an edge 1 time(maybe).

Also I am not sure of the definition should the answer for this graph be 


```
[[5, 6, 4], [2, 3, 4, 1]]
```


OR


```
[[5, 6, 4], [2, 3, 4, 1],[1,4],[2,3]]
```

Graphs should be simple and unweighted :P

Concerning `.subgraph`, the result you get is what is documented

```
        - ``vertices`` -- a single vertex or an iterable container of vertices,
          e.g. a list, set, graph, file or numeric array. If not passed (i.e.,
          ``None``), defaults to the entire graph.

        - ``edges`` -- as with ``vertices``, edges can be a single edge or an
          iterable container of edges (e.g., a list, set, file, numeric array,
          etc.). By default (``edges=None``), all edges are assumed and the
          returned graph is an induced subgraph. In the case of multiple edges,
          specifying an edge as `(u,v)` means to keep all edges `(u,v)`,
          regardless of the label.
```


There is a mistake in the documentation. It is documented that `output` can be `'vertex'` or `'edges'`, but

```
sage: G.cycle_basis(output='edges')
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)

   4557         if not output in ['vertex', 'edge']:
-> 4558             raise ValueError('output must be either vertex or edge')
   4559 
   4560         if self.allows_multiple_edges():

ValueError: output must be either vertex or edge
sage: G.cycle_basis(output='edge')
[[(1, 4, None), (4, 1, None)], [(1, 4, None), (4, 1, None)]]
```


I don't know how to fix the issue.

Replying to [comment:3 dcoudert]:
> Graphs should be simple and unweighted :P

but in the examples of cycle_basis following is given:
here G is non simple 


```
For undirected graphs with multiple edges:

sage: G = Graph([(0, 2, 'a'), (0, 2, 'b'), (0, 1, 'c'), (1, 2, 'd')], multiedges=True)
sage: G.cycle_basis()
[[0, 2], [2, 1, 0]]
sage: G.cycle_basis(output='edge')
[[(0, 2, 'a'), (2, 0, 'b')], [(2, 1, 'd'), (1, 0, 'c'), (0, 2, 'a')]]

```

It was a joke. Our life would be much easier without multiedges...

Comment by @rajat1433 created at 2019-03-25 09:46:38

Haha it really would be...

Comment by @abhayptp created at 2019-03-28 18:16:05

It will work fine if instead of this line in cycle_basis()

```
return [self.subgraph(edges=T + [e]).is_forest(certificate=True,
                                                           output=output)[1]
                    for e in self.edge_iterator() if not e in T]
```

we use

```
return [Graph(edges=T + [e]).is_forest(certificate=True,
                                                           output=output)[1]
                    for e in self.edge_iterator() if not e in T]
```

Since self.subgraph(e) includes multiple existing copies of e as mentioned above in comment and, if two copies of e = (x,y) are in graph and suppose e got included in T, then there is a cycle including (x,y) always in subgraph(T+[e]), which is returned.
So, to avoid that we should use the above method.
But it will require extra overhead of creating Graph multiple times, maybe we can use this method only when G has parameter multiedges=True.

Comment by @abhayptp created at 2019-03-28 18:53:58

For, example this works right.

```
sage: G = Graph([(1,2),(2,3),(2,3),(3,4),(1,4),(1,4),(4,5),(5,6),(4,6),(6,7)],multiedges=True)
sage: T = G.min_spanning_tree()
sage: [Graph(T + [e],  multiedges=True).is_forest(certificate=True, output='vertex')[1] for e in G.edge_iterator() if not e in T]
[[4, 3, 2, 1], [6, 5, 4]]

```

Though, it will not return some cycle of length 2(resulting from multiple edges between two vertices) when multiple edges e gets included in T because 'if not e in T' evaluates to False then.

Comment by @rajat1433 created at 2019-03-28 19:24:38

I think the answer should be 


```
[[5, 6, 4], [2, 3, 4, 1],[1,4],[2,3]]
```


according to definition of cycle_basis.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_basis


---

Comment by @abhayptp created at 2019-03-28 19:42:18

Yes.
I think it fixes this.

```
sage: G = Graph([(1,2),(2,3),(2,3),(3,4),(1,4),(1,4),(4,5),(5,6),(4,6),(6,7)],multiedges=True)
sage: T = G.min_spanning_tree()
sage: H = G.copy()
sage: H.delete_edges(T)
sage: [Graph(T + [e],  multiedges=True).is_forest(certificate=True, output='vertex')[1] for e in H.edge_iterator()]
[[1, 4], [2, 3], [4, 3, 2, 1], [6, 5, 4]]
```

I have sent diff #27563 for it by mistake instead of sending diff on this ticket.
Please review it.\\
I have imported Graph from sage.graphs.graph in cycle_basis() function to create instance of Graph.


---

Comment by dcoudert created at 2019-03-29 10:07:53

I suggest to move the branch from #27563 to this ticket and mark #27563 as duplicate. The motivation for that is that the discussion is in this ticket.

Some comments on the branch:
- instead of calling `is_forest`, you should call `is_tree`. Indeed, at this point of the code, you know that the graph is connected, so there is no need to check that again in `is_forest`. Actually, method `is_tree` will also check if the graph is connected.
- align `output=output` below `certificate=True`
- add a doctest with the example of this ticket

Comment by @rajat1433 created at 2019-03-29 11:05:03

`@`gh-abhayptp can you make the requested changes, then we can move that branch to here. If you require any help let me know.


---

Comment by @abhayptp created at 2019-03-29 13:58:37

Added doctests and made the required changes.\\
There were some extra whitespaces at 4 places in the file which have also been removed. My editor automatically did that :p \\
I can undo that change if anyone wants.

In sage we follow pep8 style:
https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

```diff
-            sage: H = Graph([(1,2),(2,3),(2,3),(3,4),(1,4),(1,4),(4,5),(5,6),(4,6),(6,7)],multiedges=True)
-            sage: H.cycle_basis()
-            [[1, 4], [2, 3], [4, 3, 2, 1], [6, 5, 4]]
+            sage: H = Graph([(1, 2), (2, 3), (2, 3), (3, 4), (1, 4), (1, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (4, 6), (6, 7)], multiedges=True)
+            sage: H.cycle_basis()
+            [[1, 4], [2, 3], [4, 3, 2, 1], [6, 5, 4]]
```


Also you can add a Wikipedia reference explaining cycle_basis just after its definition


```diff
+        See the :wikipedia:`Cycle_basis` for more information.
```

```
            return [Graph(T + [e], multiedges=True).is_tree(certificate=True,
                                                            output=output)[1]
                    for e in H.edge_iterator()]
```


instead of creating a new graph again and again you can create a single graph from T and then you may add and delete edge e in H.edge_iterator to that graph.


---

Comment by dcoudert created at 2019-03-29 16:41:42

That's right, you can do something like:

```
from sage.graphs.graph import Graph
T = Graph(self.min_spanning_tree(), multiedges=True, format='list_of_edges')
H = self.copy()
H.delete_edges(T.edge_iterator())
L = []
for e in H.edge_iterator():
    T.add_edge(e)
    L.append(T.is_tree(certificate=True, output=output)[1])
    T.delete_edge(e)
return L
```

Note that T is a list. So you can't use add_edge in that. You need to construct a graph from T first 


```
T = Graph(self.min_spanning_tree(), multiedges=True, format='list_of_edges')
```

Yeah. I missed that. I don't get why tests went silent. Maybe, I didn't do ./sage -br?


---

Comment by dcoudert created at 2019-03-29 17:50:05

I usually do `./sage -btp --long src/sage/graphs/generic_graph.py`.

For me this patch is now good to go. Thanks.

Comment by @rajat1433 created at 2019-03-29 17:51:48

A few improvements:

- Note that Networkx implementation of cycle_basis also does not work for directed graphs so we can check that at the start of the code and return the appropriate error there only.

- A small grammatical error ;)

```diff
-        a dictionary associating an unique vector to each undirected edge::
+        a dictionary associating a unique vector to each undirected edge::
```


- Since the copy parameter of Networkx graph has been deprecated(ticket:27491) you may remove it:

```diff
-        cycle_basis_v = networkx.cycle_basis(self.networkx_graph(copy=False))
+        cycle_basis_v = networkx.cycle_basis(self.networkx_graph())
```
