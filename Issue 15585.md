Just found this while experimenting with my own semirings:


```
sage: T = TropicalSemiring(QQ)       
sage: T.infinity() ** 2
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-28-b94a4a077331> in <module>()
----> 1 T.infinity() ** Integer(2)

TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for '*': 'Integer Ring' and '<type 'NoneType'>'
```


Here is a way to solve this (sage/rings/semirings/tropical_semiring.pyx):


```
    def __pow__(base, exp, dummy):
        """
        Return ``self`` to ``exp``.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: T = TropicalSemiring(QQ)
            sage: elt = T(2)
            sage: elt**3
            6
            sage: elt**-2
            -4
            sage: elt**(3/7)
            6/7
            sage: elt**0
            0

            sage: elt = T.infinity()
            sage: elt**0
            0
            sage: elt**(1/2)
            +infinity
            sage: elt*33
            +infinity
        """
        cdef TropicalSemiringElement self, x
        self = base
        if self._val is None:
            if exp > 0:
                return self
            elif exp == 0:
                return self.parent().one()
            raise ZeroDivisionError("Tropical division by infinity")
        x = self._new()
        x._val = exp*self._val
        return x
```


Is this good? (I cannot upload branches from here -- git fails authorization?)

LGTM. I'll post a branch tonight if you haven't been able to do so by then.

Thank you! I'm back home so here's a branch.

Something weird is happening: the branch shows as already merged?

Anyway, the branches public/combinat/15822 and public/combinat/15822new are identical and both contain the fix I proposed + a few minor edits to the docstring. If you can give them a pos_rev that'd be great!

Branch you posted is just the latest beta version and doesn't contain any changes beyond that. (Also could you delete the branch you don't end up using? Thanks.)

Ah!! I forgot to reattach the head somehow.

EDIT: old branch deleted.

I made a few other minor (doc)tweaks. Mainly I wanted to not use zero/one() but instead additive/multiplicative_identity() to make it less likely to cause confusion. pos_rev if your okay with my tweaks.

Yes I am. Thanks again!

Actually, I now believe it would be useful to have a method that takes a tropical semiring element into the corresponding element of the base ring. Do you think so too?

This is now #15823.
