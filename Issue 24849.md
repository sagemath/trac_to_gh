# Issue 24849: Add DESTDIR support for nauty

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25086

Original creator: embray

Original creation time: 2018-04-03 09:51:59

Keywords: destdir nauty

Here the use of `sdh_configure` is not really necessary, but I use it for the built-in error handling.
