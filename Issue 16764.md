A couple very minor issues and one major issue.

- you should wrap the overlong line in the _fast_polys example

- ' = ' in the _fast_eval example

- At the moment, these functions are not actually being used. You need to implement _call_() as well (see projective_morphism)

I took a quick look at this conflict and it seems very bad to me. Something went quite wrong with merging in the latest beta. There are numerous conflicts throughout sage when I try and merge in the latest beta on my machine into this branch. I'm not sure how to fix something like this other than resetting back to 7d04713 and redoing the merge (which results in just a conflict in affine_morphism, the original problem he was trying to fix with the merge).

Could someone with more git experience make a suggestion here as 'undoing' a commit is typically a bad course of action.
