A couple very minor issues and one major issue.

- you should wrap the overlong line in the _fast_polys example

- ' = ' in the _fast_eval example

- At the moment, these functions are not actually being used. You need to implement _call_() as well (see projective_morphism)

I took a quick look at this conflict and it seems very bad to me. Something went quite wrong with merging in the latest beta. There are numerous conflicts throughout sage when I try and merge in the latest beta on my machine into this branch. I'm not sure how to fix something like this other than resetting back to 7d04713 and redoing the merge (which results in just a conflict in affine_morphism, the original problem he was trying to fix with the merge).

Could someone with more git experience make a suggestion here as 'undoing' a commit is typically a bad course of action.

The first thing to try is `git reset --hard HEAD^` to back up one commit, then retry the merge, and then push it to a new branch name on trac (perhaps a forced push is okay since the current branch is broken essentially broken, or if no forced push, delete the current branch).

If that doesn't work, then I would create a new branch and `git cherry-pick` the commits from the current branch which correspond to work on the ticket (there's 2 such commits from looking at the log: `8a900a7` and `7d04713`).

Since this is now merging cleanly, it looks like the merge with beta4 is now successful.

The functionality works as expected.
