Hellooooooooooooo !!!!

Here is a small patch that attemtps to change that :


```
sage: map(type,graphs.HoltGraph().vertices()[0])
[<type 'sage.rings.finite_rings.integer_mod.IntegerMod_int'>, <type 'sage.rings.finite_rings.integer_mod.IntegerMod_int'>]
```


Into the more natural product of integers. In order to avoid very weird bugs later on `:-)`

It also changes the layout into something slightly different.
