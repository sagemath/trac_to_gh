1. The sage-local artifact has one tar file per stage/node. There is a lot duplication, leading to a huge artifact (6GB). Two possible improvements:

    (a) Use separate artifacts for each stage. For example sage-local-ii would contain sage-local-ii-*.tar but not sage-local-i-*.tar. 

    (b) Only store modified/added files that were not in the previous stages. (Then extracting should be done in order.)

2. The ci-cygwin*.yml files right now are the result of copy+paste. It should really be generated. 

  (a) A simple macro language should do. m4 can do the job. Or write the generator in bash or python. 

  (b) Extra credit for automating the splitting into nodes and stages from package dependencies and compilation time data. This is a stochastic scheduling problem with precedence constraints.
