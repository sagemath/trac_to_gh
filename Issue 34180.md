Things look fine up until the `fast_map_common_subexp()` call in `singular_polynomial_call()` in `src/sage/libs/singular/polynomial.pyx`. Either the arguments are set up wrong somehow, or it might be a Singular bug?

I'm not sure what's going on, but I wasn't able to reproduce the problem directly in singular:


```
sage: singular_console()
> ring R = (integer,9),(x,y),dp;
> poly f = x^2*y;
> subst(f,x,3,y,1);
0

Thanks for fixing this! I looked at the singular code, but couldn't understand it, so didn't know what was wrong or how to fix it.
