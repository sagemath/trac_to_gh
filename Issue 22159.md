```
sage: A.<n> = AsymptoticRing('ZZ^n * n^ZZ', ZZ, default_prec=3)
sage: 1/(1+n)
n^(-1) - n^(-2) + n^(-3) + O(n^(-4))
```

vs.

```
sage: 1/(QQ(1)+n)
n^(-1) - n^(-2) + n^(-3) - n^(-4) + n^(-5) - n^(-6) + n^(-7) - n^(-8) + n^(-9) - n^(-10) + n^(-11) - n^(-12) + n^(-13) - n^(-14) + n^(-15) - n^(-16) + n^(-17) - n^(-18) + n^(-19) - n^(-20) + O(n^(-21))
```
