# Issue 19139: fixing the hidden doc in geometry

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: chapoton

Original creation time: 2015-10-08 18:19:46

CC:  ncohen

Keywords: doc

A few docs of underscore methods in /graphs are broken.
They can be found using
sage -docbuild -u -k reference/geometry html

Most of them are in schnyder.py, where doc needs a general clean-up.

Let us fix that.

Frédéric,

Could you help us by reviewing #19061?

Thanks,

Nathann

Thanks Nathann.

Sorry, but I am not convinced by #19061.. I do not like the additional decorators, and the additional layer of complexity.

You are free to think so, but by not reviewing it nothing gets solved. I expect a reviewer to discuss the implementation if (s)he does not like it.

So if you want to see this problem solved (a thematic index that stays up to date, no branch conflict when two guys update it simultaneously, and making sure that all functions appear in the index) you are quite welcome to review the ticket by saying what you do not like and how you think it should be done instead.

Otherwise, well. All we have is a 'needs_review' ticket that nobody likes.

And that will have to be rebased from time to time.

Nathann

Seems that this other patch is about to be reviewed. So if you think that the design is bad now is the time to say it.
