CC:  @kcrisman @ptigwe @drvinceknight @dimpase

Keywords: Game Theory, Normal Form Game, Degenerate

Degenerate games can cause problems for many algorithms resulting in strange and conflicting output. This ticket would add a method `game.is_degenerate()` to test for such behaviour.

Could you add a test where the row players payoff is given as

[[3, 0],
[0, 3],
[1.5, 1.5]]

This shows an example where the game is degenerate in mixed strategies, but not in pure.

Unless if I've gone wrong some where, the following game shouldn't be degenerate.


```
A = [[1, 0], [0, 1], [0, 0]]
B = [[1, 0], [0, 1], [0.7, 0.8]]
g = NormalFormGame([A, B])
g.is_degenerate()

Instead of passing the payoff matrix into the `best_response` function, could you make it such that the player index i.e. either 1 or 2 (or 0, 1. I don't remember which is officially used in the documentation or if we actually have a documented indexing of players) is passed in place if the payoff matrix. This way you can then retrieve the payoff matrix from the given player. Next, could you make this function locked to two players.

I've also changed some of the documentation slightly to make use of the normal form game catalog that is now in `develop` (see #17392).

In the examples for the `best_responses` function, the second example for the second player actually calculates the best response for the first player.


```
sage: g.best_responses((1/2, 1/2), player=0)
```


Also, I think a value error should be raised when `player` is greater than 1. Currently the following happens.


```
g = NormalFormGame([matrix.identity(3)])
g.best_responses([1, 0, 0], 2)
.....
UnboundLocalError: local variable 'payoff_matrix' referenced before assignment
