How about "upstream" for the name of the bikeshed? That would still make sense if we ever move to e.g. github.

`trac` is the fixed name of the remote for the `git-trac` command. 

The change here on the ticket is so that developers who create another sage source tree by unpacking a source distribution can immediately use `git trac` on it without having to go through `git trac config` (https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/git_trac.html#git-and-trac-configuration)
