When compiling the doc with --warn-links (pretty nice thing, by the way), some broken links appeared in the doc of graphs/ and numerical/. I fixed all I could `:-)`

Fill in your reviewer names, kids ;-)

Oh, right. By the way, couldn't we have triggers automatically adding the name of the committer of the branch as the author, in case that it is empty ? I think it's rather safe. I mean, if we only set it when the field was empty and when the branch is first defined on the ticket.

Perhaps we could also script something that sets the reviewer's name (if the field is empty) using the name of the guy who sets the ticket to `positive_review`, but that would be a trac-only thing and I don't even know if this can be done `:-)`
