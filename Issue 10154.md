Keywords: Cyclic Sieving Phenomenon

This patch implements the Cyclic Sieving Phenomenon (CSP) as described in

Reiner, Stanton, White - *The cyclic sieving phenomenon*, JCTA108 (2004)

Given a finite set S and a cyclic action cyc_act on S, the method `CyclicSievingPolynomial`( S, cyc_act ) returns the unique polynomial P of order < n such that the triple ( S, cyc_act, P ) exhibits the CSP. The method `CyclicSievingCheck`( S, cyc_act, P ) checks if this triple exhibits the CSP.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/10155

I can override only files with the same name and not delete any (is that true?). So when the name changes, or if I forget to mark the box, the file stays there forever. I am happy to learn about a way to get around that.

For both tickets, only the youngest file contains the newest version of the patch.

You should modify the header of your patch : add something like

This seems good enough. I will soon give a positive review if minor corrections are made.

1) at start of the patch, before AUTHORS, there is a broken (not complete) sentence.

2) I am not happy with the name of the procedures.

What about CyclicSieving_find and CyclicSieving_test ?

or CyclicSievingPolynomial and CyclicSievingCheck ?

or some mix of that..

3) You could use R.gen() instead of R.gens()[0] (at least twice)

4) in CyclicSieving, you can use keys to compute n, instead of calling .keys() again

5) in orbit_decomposition, there misses the OUTPUT: a list of lists, the orbits under cyc_act acting on L

6) why do you need to import QQ ? because of q-analogues ? coercion may work with ZZ, maybe..

I use it when defining the polynomial:

```
R = QQ['q']
```

Or did you think of doing that differently?

I don't know why, but the mod operation on R(f) does not work in that case. I had a quick look but didn't see the reason right away...

As the QQ doesn't really do anything negative (or does it?), I think we should just leave it.
