```
            sage: from sage.combinat.finite_state_machine import FSMTransition
            sage: t1 = FSMTransition('A', 'B', 0)
            sage: t2 = FSMTransition('B', 'B', 1)
            sage: F = FiniteStateMachine([t1, t2])
            sage: F.delete_state('A')
            sage: F.transitions()
            [Transition from 'B' to 'B': 1|-]
            sage: F._states_
            ['B']
            sage: F._states_dict_
            {'A': 'A', 'B': 'B'}
```

The last output is wrong.

I've cross-reviewed your changes. For me those are a positive-review.
