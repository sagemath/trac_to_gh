> Interesting--not sure why that would do it but okay.  But if it's not a problem on newer GCC versions maybe whatever the problem is is since fixed.

The problem is indeed fixed in GCC-4.9, see http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=56982

I don't understand why: `ob_size` still exists in Python 3.

Especially given that we cannot assign to `Py_SIZE()`, I don't really see the point.
