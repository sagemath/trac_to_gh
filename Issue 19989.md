Could you use the macro `Py_SIZE` instead of calling `py_long_object->ob_size`? In particular, it will simplify the switch to Python3. Sadly, Cython does not accept the macro expansion `Py_SIZE(my_object) = whatever` and the C-API does not document an alternative way of doing things.

I don't understand why: `ob_size` still exists in Python 3.

Especially given that we cannot assign to `Py_SIZE()`, I don't really see the point.
