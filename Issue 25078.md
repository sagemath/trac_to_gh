Unfortunately find_library doesn't work with nix (see [this](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/7307) issue) and apparently is only supposed to return the library filename (not the path) anyways.

To make it possible to use sage when find_library fails, this patch adds DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH as a fallback.

Would it be cleaner if your implementation went into the "else" block as the .so, .a extensions are only correct for "else" systems, aren't they?

Which else block? The `if sys.platform == 'cygwin'` one? If so, I wouldn't mind. But I also don't see why that would be cleaner. cygwin could make use of that fallback too and it doesn't hurt.

Yes, its just easier to detect new failures if all doctests pass. Maybe it'll be used more in the future. Having an escape hatch can't hurt either way.
