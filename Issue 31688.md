# Issue 31688: Reorganize topology

Proposal: create a directory `sage/topology` and move some of the files currently in `sage/homology`: move `cell_complex.py`, `cubical_complex.py`, `delta_complex.py`, and `simplicial_*.py`. Also move `examples.py` and rename it to `simplicial_complex_examples.py` or similar.

How do we do this and respect Sage's deprecation policy? Have deprecated versions of all of the files in `sage/homology` which just contain deprecation warnings and then import from the corresponding file in `sage/topology`? Is there another option?

I think your proposal is good. I believe we did that previously when moving files.

Okay, let's try this. The two separate commits may be easier to review than the final result.

Doctests passed for me after having done only commit [e1f4093](https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit?id=e1f4093f60c7349e740fc79302e9808057b05151), and in addition I searched for `sage.homology...`, so I think I caught all of the old references.

Turns out this way of deprecating the classes is inconvenient when user code actually tries to subclass some of these classes. I think it would have been better to use `lazy_import` instead with a deprecation
