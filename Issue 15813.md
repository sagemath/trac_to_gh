This is just a bit of cleanup+bugfixes that I've done over the past couple weeks. Notable changes:

- remove deprecations from #12719
- fix iload to actually be able to edit the loaded lines (could still be better, but would require more hacking on ipython internals; probably should just be added to upstream ipython instead)
- fix weird random bugs encountered with `InterfaceShellTransformer` (e.g. in gap, creating an error will cause future valid lines to error out) -- as far as I can tell, the code was just overthought (and had interface specific things that should belong as part of the appropriate interface)
- use the IPython shutdown hook rather than customizing `ask_exit`
- remove some dead and unused code

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16050

I would also like to move most of this code out of `sage.misc` to something like `sage.app`, but I'm not really happy with that package name. Maybe something like `sage.terminal`? Suggestions would be welcome.

Also, this is just a first step towards cleanup. Certainly more could be done (e.g. stuff surrounding the preparser), but I figured may as well do this gradually rather than as a patchbomb.

(Sorry for the force push, didn't properly copy a symlink.)

I'll make further changes in future tickets (I'll of course fix any regressions here, if they are found), so I'm marking this as needs review.

Conflicts with the already-merged (but not released) #15990.

From looking at the source it seems that this still suffers from the same problem as #16154, the sage prompt transformer ought to run first and not last. Can you fix it here, then I'll close my ticket.

Can you also fix the module path in the doctests? ;-)
