In Sage 7.2 the following important deprecation warning is displayed:


```
sage: function('f',x)
/Users/Masson/Downloads/GitHub/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/IPython/core/interactiveshell.py:2885: DeprecationWarning: Calling function('f',x) is deprecated. Use function('f')(x) instead.
See http://trac.sagemath.org/17447 for details.
  exec(code_obj, self.user_global_ns, self.user_ns)
f(x)
```


As of at least 7.3.beta4 the warning is no longer there. The likely cause is #20667. Other missing warnings were reported in sage-devel:

I guess the presence of IPython in the module name triggers one of the ignore rules - have to be more careful. Working on it!

With 7.3 imminent we probably should fix this and no user will notice the regression...

The deprecation warning I reported missing is back after this fix. Positive review from me, but would like others to test as well.
