CC:  @laisrast @kliem @tscrim jpalmieri

Keywords: polytopes, simplicial complex, days100

The boundary of polytopes are nice and relatively well-behaved cell complexes.

When the polytope is simplicial, its boundary is a simplicial complex. This ticket implements a method to return that simplicial complex.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28248

The difference will only be minor, once #27063 is done.
It's still going to be faster to just take the incidence matrix, but not by much.

Try it out `tuple(CombinatorialPolyhedron(P).face_iter(P.dimension()-1))` vs `P.incidence_matrix()`.

Be aware that the incidence matrix is cashed.

Actually no. Running `CombinatorialPolyhedron(P)` will compute the incidence matrix of `P` to initialize the `CombinatorialPolyhedron`.
`P.incidence_matrix()` is still far faster.

I know that it will compute the incidence matrix anyway.
However, I disagree that it is far faster.
Almost all the time initializing `CombinatorialPolyhedron` is spent on the incidence matrix.
To obtain all the facets (in `CombinatorialPolyhedron`) is really quick, because there is nothing to compute anymore.

Overall, I don't think your suggested change is going to make a big difference (yes it will be slightly faster).

For the `Polyhedron` class (which this method is implemented for), you can see that there is a big difference.

For your suggested method:

```
sage: P = polytopes.permutahedron(7)
sage: %time I = P.incidence_matrix()
CPU times: user 2.85 s, sys: 72.4 ms, total: 2.92 s
Wall time: 2.83 s
```



```
sage: Q = polytopes.permutahedron(7)
sage: %time I = tuple(CombinatorialPolyhedron(Q).face_iter(Q.dimension()-1))
CPU times: user 3.99 s, sys: 287 ms, total: 4.28 s
Wall time: 3.98 s
```

My suggested change is still faster since it computes less.

Anyway, since #27063 is not yet done, and since the class is `Polyhedron`, there **is** a big difference in using the `incidence_matrix` instead of `faces`.

I will replace to incidence_matrix. Once #27063 is done, the discussion may resume and check what is best, for now, `incidence_matrix` does the job.
