There should be better error handling when the user passes a group that is not finite. By wishful thinking, I thought I could do:

```
sage: P = Polyhedron(lines=[(1,0), (0,1)])
sage: T2 = MatrixGroup(matrix(QQ,[[1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]]), [[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1]])
sage: P.fundamental_domain(T2)
```

but it gives an unhelpful error:

```

    615                 yield g
    616             return
