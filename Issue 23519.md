# Issue 23519: add shape method to crystal of tableaux elements

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23756

Original creator: saliola

Original creation time: 2017-08-30 17:55:48

CC:  aschilling

Keywords: crystals, tableaux

It would be nice if the following worked:

```
sage: C = crystals.Tableaux(["A", 2], shape=[2,1])
sage: x = list(C)[0]
sage: x.to_tableau().shape()
[2, 1]
sage: x.shape() # boom! no attribute 'shape'
[2, 1]
```

Thanks for implementing this! Some crystals have spins and behave a little differently from the usual. For those one gets an error message:

```
sage: C = crystals.Tableaux(['B',2],shape=[1/2,1/2])
sage: c = C.an_element()
sage: c.shape()

    251     if attr is NULL:

```

One option might be to get the shape from the parent:

```
sage: C = crystals.Tableaux(['B',2],shape=[1/2,1/2])
sage: C.shapes
((1/2, 1/2),)
```

Alternatively, one needs to treat the spin cases separately.

Also, in general I think it might be a good idea to have the trac # as part of the branch name.

Well, for these crystals, the elements don't have a `to_tableau` method. We put the `shape` method in the same class as the `to_tableau` method. So one could define `to_tableau` for these other crystals as well. Does that make sense? Would that be part of this ticket or another ticket?

I think so too! But I didn't pick the branch name. It was what came out of the `git-trac` scripts. Here are the commands I used:

```
git trac checkout 23756       # created branch since there was none
...
git trac push
```
