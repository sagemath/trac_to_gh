So, the problem is just wrong line break.

And now the real problem starts, namely the reviewing problem: If I understood correctly, you did two commits (`Fix --new option for doctests.` and `Fix doctest doctest due to directory restructure.`) here. Has this doctest error been introduced by your two commits, or by a "dependency"---and what is a "dependency", anyway???

I am working on my desktop because my laptop is broken. Question, Robert: While trying to use the dev scripts, I found a bug. Namely: I forgot to set up my git (e.g., I didn't store e-mail and real name). This should result in an error being raised. However, I get this traceback:

Is this bug already tracked/known to the sage-git people? I think I am currently not really able to create a ticket properly, with a slow internet connection and no usable laptop.

I just ran the tests myself, got 79 files failing. Count me shocked as well.

At this point, no, it's just to fix those two (which were the only ones on the github build_system branch). Looks like there's lots of further work to do.

First problem: How do I update? `sage -dev switch_ticket 15120`? Or `git pull trac` if I am already in your branch?

Second problem: I get these errors in your branch.

```
sage -t --long src/sage/dev/sagedev.py  # 6 doctests failed
sage -t --long src/sage/interfaces/maxima_abstract.py  # 1 doctest failed

sage -t --long src/sage/doctest/control.py  # 2 doctests failed
sage -t --long src/sage/dev/trac_interface.py  # 1 doctest failed
```
Why is this a problem, git-wise? Well, I learnt on sage-git that pulling your branch means I get something that is based on an *old* version of the "master" branch, i.e., a version of "master" that is not as terribly broken as the version mentioned in comment:10 and comment:13 - but still there are so many errors.

Sorry for my lack of knowledge on git. What I did: ./sage -dev switch-ticket 15120, followed by "make". Afterwards, ./sage -dev did not work (so, I assume that the development scripts are in the master branch, but this ticket relies on a version of the master branch that predates the development scripts; correct?).

So, I am now running make ptest.

But what I don't understand is this:

```
$ git branch -v

How can I make the branch ticket/15120 point to commit e11727c?
