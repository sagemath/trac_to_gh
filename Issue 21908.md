CC:  @tscrim

Add a function to check if a lattice is Stone lattice.

Done at https://sage.sis.uta.fi/home/pub/135/ (and hence de facto needs_review), waiting for 7.6beta to be added.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22145

There is a typo `Stone algebra` and it should be `a Stone lattice` (the name is being used as an adjective, which is okay, but it still needs an article; the other way would be `A lattice is *Stone* if ...`).

Last two nitpicks.


```diff
-            if (sum([x[1] for x in factor(self.cardinality())]) <
-                atoms_n):

```

and similar. Here it is worthwhile to break the 80 char limit for readability.

Move `from sage.arith.misc import factor` below the `self.is_distributive()` check. Actually, I would argue that it should not raise a `ValueError` in this case, but instead simply return `False`. However, I've lost similar arguments before (the `is_similar` of matrices).

True, done that.

> Move `from sage.arith.misc import factor` below the `self.is_distributive()` check.

Well... Done that too. It is of course faster to `import` only when needed, but it should be a special case if the user tries to see if a non-distributive lattice is a Stone lattice. There are also functions having something like


```
import somefunction ...
if self.cardinality() < 5: return True
if somefunction(self.bottom()) ...
```


and I think having `import`s at a start is more readable.

> Actually, I would argue that it should not raise a `ValueError` in this case, but instead simply return `False`. However, I've lost similar arguments before (the `is_similar` of matrices).

Two-sided question. But then at least `skeleton()` should be changed too.

`skeleton()` is a different issue because it is not asking a boolean question, but instead constructing a new object. In that case, the correct thing to do (IMO) is raise a `ValueError`.
