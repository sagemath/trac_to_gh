# Issue 26178: py3: use sage_getargspec more consistently

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/26415

Original creator: embray

Using `sage_getargspec` instead of `inspect.getargspec` is a nice, consistent way to smooth over some Python 2/3 differences, and in particular `DeprecationWarning`s that come up from using `inspect.getargspec`.  As a bonus it will work better on more inputs, though I don't think that particularly matters in the specific cases changed here.

It might conflict with #26380.

This should be re-targeted for 8.5.
