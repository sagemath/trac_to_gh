For what it's worth, this solution from my py3 branch also works:


```diff
diff --git a/src/sage/coding/decoder.py b/src/sage/coding/decoder.py
index 1f8be03..1dad583 100644
--- a/src/sage/coding/decoder.py

 from sage.structure.sage_object import SageObject

         """
         raise NotImplementedError

-Decoder._instance_decoder_type.__func__.__doc__ = Decoder.decoder_type.__doc__
+get_func(Decoder._instance_decoder_type).__doc__ = Decoder.decoder_type.__doc__

 class DecodingError(Exception):
     r"""
```


But I agree with your patch--in this case (particularly since it's just an internal method) it's really not important to be doing this.  But you can use something like the above for future cases if applicable.
