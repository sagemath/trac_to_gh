Changing the precision of the expression makes a difference:

```
sage: (RR(pi.n(200))-pi.n(200)).n()
0.000000000000000
sage: (CC(pi.n(200))-pi.n(200)).n()

sage: (RR((sqrt(2)).n(200))-(sqrt(2)).n(200)).n()

sage: (CC((sqrt(2)).n(200))-(sqrt(2)).n(200)).n()
0.000000000000000

I'm not complaining about the problems with limited precision. I just think they should be consistent between `RR` and `CC`.

OK, both `RR(sqrt(2))` and `CC(sqrt(2))` lead to Pynac calling `PyNumber_Power(2.00000000000000,1/2)` but the first returns `1.41...10` and the second `1.41...09`.

EDIT:

```
sage: RR(2)^(1/2)
1.41421356237310
sage: CC(2)^(1/2)
1.41421356237309
```
 

So the reason is because `CC.__pow__` uses the generic `exp(log(a)*b)` instead of `mpfr_pow` as in `RR.__pow__`.
