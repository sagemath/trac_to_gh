# Issue 12980: add pattern matching vsyasm, yasm, and ytasm to .hgignore

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13152

Assignee: leif

In Sage 5.1.beta5, the hg repository in `SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/` is not clean: the executables `vsyasm`, `yasm`, and `ytasm` are not tracked. So we should add them to `.hgignore`.

`.*asm` seems to general, why not simply add the 3 executables

```
vsyasm
yasm
ytasm
```

I couldn't decide whether to use `.*asm` or just to list them, so I'm happy to switch to listing them.
