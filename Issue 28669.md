# Issue 28669: generate zlib.pc if needed, or avoid using it.

some perfectly fine implementations of zlib don't install zlib.pc (e.g. MacOS does not).

Since #26286 this problem was sleeping, until we updated `pkgconfig` on #28883, which made it throw an error on absense of `zlib.pc`.

The biggest question I here is how to find the full path to `libz` located by `AC_CHECK_LIB` or other similar macro.
This path has to be written into `zlib.pc`.

I don't quite know: I can link an executable with libz and analyse it with
`readelf` or `otool` or a similar thing, but it's not platform independent,
and I could not find a ready-made macro (I could change `AC_CHECK_LIB`, sure...)

You can use a minimal pkgconfig file like below which doesn't require the full path to the library.


```
Name: Foo
Description: description for foo
Version: 1.0.0
Libs: -lfoo
```

well, a minimal pkgconfig like this would be just a bug in waiting to bite.

I can think of one platform-independent way (well, it needs [dladdr](https://linux.die.net/man/3/dladdr), which is non-POSIX, but BSD, something that is available on most Unices, certainly on Linux and MacOS)

Write a C function that calls `dlopen()` on the library in question, and then
calls `dladdr()` on a symbol from the library; one of parts of the returned data is the full path to the shared object where the symbol is located.
That's a hell of a macro call to `AC_RUN_IFELSE` though :-)

Could someone please try if the following works on MacOS, and if yes, what's the output

```
/* save into zt.c and run as follows:
  $ cc -o zt zt.c -ldl && ./zt

  On my Debian Linux box it outputs
  /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libz.so
*/
#include <stdio.h>
#define __USE_GNU
#include <dlfcn.h>
#ifdef __APPLE__
#define EXT "dylib"
#else
#define EXT "so"
#endif
int main() {
void *z;
Dl_info  info;
int res;
void *ha;
z = dlopen("libz."EXT,  RTLD_LAZY); /* load zlib */
ha = dlsym(z, "inflateEnd");       /* get address of inflateEnd in libz */
res = dladdr(ha, &info);           /* get info for the function */
printf("%s\n", info.dli_fname);
return res;
}
```

I suggest linking the executable `zt` to `libz` so that the correct shared library is loaded.

This branch is so far only for zlib.pc

Any obvious things I missed?

Naturally, I'd appreciate it tested on MacOS.

For libpng.pc I'll probably refactor that, to make computing abstolute path to libpng/libz/libWhatever a macro.

this is a result - ugly as hell. I am not sure whether this should get in.

Would it though?  Why exactly do we _require_ pkgconfig here at all?  It's a convenience sure, but on systems that don't install .pc files for some libraries we can still get the required information another way...

I mean, if autoconf could detect a system zlib in the first place, then I don't see why would need the absolute path to the SO file itself. All that should be needed to link against that library are whatever compiler/linker flags (e.g. `-lz`) that autoconf used to detect usability of the library in the first place.

I am thinking of a library trying to detect zlib by calling pkg-config rather than 
using autoconf. 

IMHO it's better not to install a pc file at all rather than install a rather bogus one. That's why I prefer how it's done on #28883.

It's not necessarily "bogus".  But I agree--I think what you did in #28883 is more in line with what I was trying to say here.

I don't see the difference in #28883 and a minimal .pc file as in #28906#comment:5 . They do the same thing.

yes, but they do so by different means, and a pc file is much more likely to trip up someone.

I don't know if this ticket is still needed; but if it is, then it should be revised along the lines of #29082 -- do not write into SAGE_LOCAL at configure time; instead generate a rule in build/make/Makefile that generates the pc file there.

Comment by dimpase created at 2020-03-24 17:45:41

I don't recall right now all the details, why I thought it's needed. Anyhow, perhaps as a concept of how to generate *.pc files, e.g. for openblas.
