To begin, we can simplify this a little bit by taking `K = QQ`. I updated the description accordingly.

I don't think that #22333 would fix the issue as I think the conversion is getting confused. Actually, this code block in `_mpoly_dict_recursive()` seems to be where problems start:

```python
        elif not my_vars[-1] in vars:
            x = base_ring(self) if base_ring is not None else self
            const_ix = ETuple((0,)*len(vars))
            return { const_ix: x }
```

You get into a chicken-and-egg problem of needing to extract out all of your variables from the input `x`, but first you need to know there are none of your variables in `x` as a polynomial in its current form. This is what leads to the current problem, it thinks `a*y` should be treated as a constant polynomial with respect to the variables `abc`. The recurse is made and it would then extract the `y` variable, but it doesn't know what to do with the `a` because the base ring is `K`. This is what raises the error.

I feel like the problem is that the polynomial code that calls this only passes `variable_names()` rather than `variable_names_recursive()`. However, even with doing that, it doesn't extract the correct variables first due to the ordering of `variable_names_recursive()` with your variables being last. I think the code that tries to construct the mapping is making way too many assumptions about the input, especially for how general I feel this code should work.

Thus, I think two things need to be fixed. The first is that we should be using `variable_names_recursive()` when calling `_mpoly_dict_recursive` in `__call__`. The second is that the handling of variables when `my_vars` is a subset of `vars` needs to be done without assuming `my_vars` are the last variables of `vars`.

Additionally, this "works" however:

```
sage: K = QQ
sage: QQabc = PolynomialRing(K, ['a', 'b', 'c'])
sage: QQxyz = PolynomialRing(K, ['x', 'y', 'z'])
sage: Pxyz = PolynomialRing(QQabc, ['x', 'y', 'z'])
sage: Pabc = PolynomialRing(QQxyz, ['a', 'b', 'c'])
sage: Pabc(QQabc.0 * Pxyz.1)
x*b
```

because it goes through a slightly different code path. However, the result is wrong:

```
sage: QQabc.0 * Pxyz.1
a*y
```

This result is because it first matches the number of variables and does:

```
sage: QQabc(QQxyz.1)
b
```

So this may even be considered "correct" behavior, but it is deserving of a sage-devel ask and would be a separate ticket (if considered a bug).
