Keywords: NumberField, embeddings

The embeddings function for number fields just checks for roots in the argument. For example:



```
sage: K = NumberField(x^3-2, 'a')
sage: K.embeddings(GF(3))                                                                                                                                  
[

This looks good to me.  I suppose the underlying problem is that Sage is happy to coerce K.defining_polynomial() into the polynomial ring over the finite field.

Applies fine to 5.12.beta1 and tests pass.

Yeah, that coercion bothered me a bit, but I'll settle for this ticket for now.
