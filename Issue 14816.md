# Issue 14816: Number fields think they can embed into finite fields

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Keywords: NumberField, embeddings

The embeddings function for number fields just checks for roots in the argument. For example:



```
sage: K = NumberField(x^3-2, 'a')
sage: K.embeddings(GF(3))                                                                                                                                  
[                                                                                                                                                          
Ring morphism:                                                                                                                                             
  From: Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^3 - 2                                                                                                 
  To:   Finite Field of size 3                                                                                                                             
  Defn: a |--> 2                                                                                                                                           
]
```

This looks good to me.  I suppose the underlying problem is that Sage is happy to coerce K.defining_polynomial() into the polynomial ring over the finite field.

Applies fine to 5.12.beta1 and tests pass.

Yeah, that coercion bothered me a bit, but I'll settle for this ticket for now.
