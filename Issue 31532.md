# Issue 31532: RecognizableSeries: shortcut for coefficient extraction

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31769

Original creator: dkrenn

Original creation time: 2021-05-03 16:50:33

The following should work
> {{{
> sage: M0 = matrix(2,[1,2,3,4])
> sage: M1 = matrix(2,[-2,1,3,-7])
> sage: Rec = RecognizableSeriesSpace(ZZ, (0,1))
> sage: S = Rec((M0,M1), vector((0,1)), vector((1,1)))
> sage: S[(0,0,1)]
> -103
> }}}
