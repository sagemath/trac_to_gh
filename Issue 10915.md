Assignee: @gvol

Keywords: gap

The following GAP input (say in the notebook)

```
if 4>3 then
Print("You should see me.");
fi;
```
gets changed to 

```
if 4>3 thenPrint("You should see me.");fi;
```
before sending to GAP.  Obviously this fails since `thenPrint` should be two words.

It also doesn't strip comments correctly as can be seen by

```
## here is a comment
if 4>3 then
 Print("here");
fi
```
which returns nothing.

The reason they didn't send it all at once seems to be that the interface doesn't properly handle continuation prompts (it deletes enough characters for the whole prompt). Sending all on one line avoids them... except of course when it doesn't.  In particular something like

The following tests failed:

The startup.py failure is not important, and the maxima failure seems to remain even when I unapply your patch and rebuild, so I have no idea what's going on with that.
