# Issue 10135: `log(x).operator() == log` should return `True`

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Reported by Francois Maltey on sage-devel:


```
> log(x).operator() == ln # is True, yes the alias ln is better than
> the log name
> log(x).operator() == log # is False (this feature looks like the 
> binomial one)
> log(x).operator() == sage.function.log.function_log # is True
```


We should define a `__call__()` method in the `Function_log` class from `sage/functions/log.py`, to handle the base argument. Then `ln()` and  `log()` can be the same function and `log(x).operator() == log` will return `True`.

Just a minor comment: the "INPUT" description for log is now lost. Just by looking at `*args, **kwds` it is not possible to know what should be the order of the argument and the base of the log. Also, `**kwds` gives the impression that it can take in a lot of kwd arguments, whereas I think it takes only the keyword `hold=True`.

Also, my guess is that `log?` will no longer be very helpful.  I haven't tried this, though.

`@`ppurka: `log`, like `exp`, never had an "INPUT" description; the `hold` parameter is introduced informally in both cases; please open a separate ticket.

`@`kcrisman: `log?` is fine, and identical to `ln?`

Reviewer's patch addresses this patchbot failure:

```
File "src/sage/ext/fast_callable.pyx", line 1524, in sage.ext.fast_callable._expression_binop_helper.get_builtin_functions
Failed example:
    sorted(list(builtins.values()))
Expected:
    ['abs', 'abs', 'acos', 'acosh', 'add', 'asin', 'asinh', 'atan', 'atanh', 'ceil', 'cos', 'cosh', 'cot', 'csc', 'div', 'exp', 'floor', 'floordiv', 'inv', 'log', 'log', 'mul', 'neg', 'pow', 'sec', 'sin', 'sinh', 'sqrt', 'sub', 'tan', 'tanh']
Got:
    ['abs', 'abs', 'acos', 'acosh', 'add', 'asin', 'asinh', 'atan', 'atanh', 'ceil', 'cos', 'cosh', 'cot', 'csc', 'div', 'exp', 'floor', 'floordiv', 'inv', 'log', 'mul', 'neg', 'pow', 'sec', 'sin', 'sinh', 'sqrt', 'sub', 'tan', 'tanh']
```

I hazard that this small change won't need another review, so I'll set positive.

Changing keywords from "" to "log, ln, function".
