There is room for more dependencies (boost, gsl, readline, frobby, gfan, normaliz, mathsat (not in Sage)), but let us start simple.

Cocoalib compiles for me, and seems to install ok.

However, it does not install .so files, just `libcocoa-0.99564.a` (plus a `libcocoa.a` link to it, and a bunch of header files). I don't know if that is the standard way to install libcocoa.

Unfortunately, that's how cocoa works. Upstream decided to write their own custom build system instead of using more standard tools like autotools (autoconf + automake + libtool). They don't support building shared libraries.

Ok, so as far as I can tell, this should have a possitive review.

(Anna Bigatti, author of CoCoALib)

We have nothing agains building shared libraries, nor autoconf.
(just lack of time to do it and test it properly)

We had started our own configuration script a long time ago. It works pretty well, and we were suggested not to switch ;-)

We can offer support in case of need!

It seems cocoalib or libcocoa was packaged in the Sage's early days.

Can someone check whether all previous Cocoa-related tickets are obsolete?

https://trac.sagemath.org/query?order=id&desc=1&summary=~cocoa

At this point the list has four tickets from before the present one:
- #8527, #8521 are still open tickets
- #6298, #5861 are closed
