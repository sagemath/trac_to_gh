# Issue 27357: Use more of GAP API where possible

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27594

Original creator: embray

Original creation time: 2019-04-02 14:17:33

Keywords: gap

In #27094 we upgraded Sage's GAP dependency to 4.10.1. 4.10.1 added several new functions to the official libgap API, and we should try to use them as much as possible, where applicable, rather than trying to hack around the API.

For example, we should try to use `GAP_CallFuncArray` for calling GAP functions.

Trying to reimplement as much of Sage's GAP interface with the new API will in turn produce valuable feedback for the GAP developers.

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).

Changing keywords from "gap" to "gap, libgap".

This ticket isn't for tracking pexpect->libgap conversion.  It's a ticket specific to the libgap interface itself, and updating it to use more of the official API provided by libgap.

Right - do we have a ticket for pexpect->libgap conversion ? I could nor find anything but this ticket - perhaps you know where to look.
