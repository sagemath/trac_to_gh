Keywords: Steenrod algebra

For some applications one would like to work with the "odd primary Steenrod algebra at the prime 2". The attached patch introduces a new keyword "generic" that allows to do this:


```
  sage: EA=SteenrodAlgebra(p=2,generic=True) ; EA
  generic mod 2 Steenrod algebra, milnor basis
  sage: EA[8]
  Vector space spanned by (Q_0 Q_2, Q_0 Q_1 P(2), P(1,1), P(4)) over Finite Field of size 2
  sage: SteenrodAlgebra(p=2,generic=True,basis='adem')[7]
  Vector space spanned by (beta P^2 P^1, beta P^3, P^2 P^1 beta, P^3 beta) over Finite Field of size 2
```

The code seems functional now. I've also added an `is_generic` method to allow inspection of the '_generic' attribute.

One thing that might be problematic about this patch is that a few routines have changed their signature now: 'serre_cartan_mono_to_string', for example, now expects 'generic' as second argument, not 'p'. We might instead go for

    `def serre_cartan_mono_to_string(data,p,generic=None)`

which would save backward compatibility... I'm not sure if that is required, though.

Very strange: it works for me, it works for the patchbot (selmer, sage 6.3.beta1) - yet your machine (and your patch) is definitely right. I do get this error when I try to construct a subalgebra:


```

    262     else:

You're also right about the documentation, which should be improved. I'll post an updated patch when it is ready.

I've made a few small changes:

- added some doctests explicitly involving the mod 2 generic Steenrod algebra. I guess this is mostly not necessary, since the generic code gets tested well at odd primes, but I added these anyway.

- top of the file: added `# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-` so the accent in "Études" wouldn't break docbuilding.

- fixed a pre-existing bug in `_latex_term` for the "pst" basis

- changed the `__contains__` method so that elements in the ordinary mod 2 Steenrod algebra are not contained in the generic version. Is this the right thing to do?

If you're happy with these changes, it can get a positive review.
