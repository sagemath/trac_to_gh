CC:  jdemeyer vbraun

This is a follow-up on #20259, which added the `output="matrix"` argument to `restricted_automorphism_group`. It returns a `MatrixGroup`.

In this ticket, I propose to add `output="affine"` to return an `AffineGroup`.

I wonder why I didn't do that in #20259. Either I didn't know about `AffineGroup` or it was lacking in functionality.

Answering my own question: it seems that an `AffineGroup` always refers to the group of *all* affine transformations, not a subgroup.

So, as far as I can tell, the object you want to return doesn't exist in Sage (and it would be non-trivial work to implement it).

Thanks! I was already wondering why there was no method to make a subgroup (though methods `subsemigroup` and `submonoid` exist).

Shouldn't we just close this ticket for now?

I've instead created a ticket for subgroups of `AffineGroup` - #21275
