This triggers a bug:

```
sage: g = graphs.IcosahedralGraph()
sage: g.chromatic_number(algorithm='MILP')
```


The bug is in `graphs/graph_coloring.py`.  In particular, this code is bogus:

```
        # - No need to try any k smaller than the maximum clique in
        # - the graph No need to try k less than |G|/alpha(G), as each
        #   color class is at most alpha(G)
        # - max, because we know it is not bipartite
        from math import ceil
        k = max([3, g.clique_number(),ceil(g.order()/len(g.independent_set()))])
```


Somebody (see #9618) thinks that ceil returns an int, but it returns a float.  Oops.

Could it be the one that was fixed in #12389 ? `:-)`

Yep, that is one way to fix it.  I couldn't find that searching.  Oops.  I'm closing this as a duplicate.
