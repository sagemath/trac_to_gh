Yup, I see what you are talking about - e.g. 

		if (x.is_equal(_ex1))  // log(1) -> 0
			return _ex0;

Although it might be nice to stay relatively close to Ginac and fix such things on the Sage level if that's not really bad.
```

This ticket's goal is to implement one of these solutions (that is, catch this in function.pyx or in Pynac).

#10972 was closed as a duplicate. Ironic that I reported both, though in my defense, that ticket does list a few specific functions beyond log for which that happens, and it was 8 months ago :)

Actually this should have been fixed in Pynac. Now, accidentally the recent patches dealing with https://github.com/pynac/pynac/issues/7 automatically produce this behaviour. Which will be Pynac-0.4.4. The wrapper from this ticket should then be removed.
