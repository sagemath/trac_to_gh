# Issue 28590: Intermittent failures with symbolic gcd computation

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28827

This ticket is to track the issue that was being discussed at #28489, but covered up hastily because it was blocking sage on python 3. 

The solution there by flagging the problematic doctests with "known bugs" is a bad solution, since the problem of the doctests is not wrong answers but  intermittent failures. 

This ticket would welcome a real solution. The aim is not to get correct answers for all cases in symbolic gcd computation, but to avoid uncontrolled failures.

Moving tickets to milestone sage-9.2 based on a review of last modification date, branch status, and severity.

Side-ticket: #31917 to fix the typo prescripted -> prescribed.
