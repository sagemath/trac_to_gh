This ticket is to track the issue that was being discussed at #28489, but covered up hastily because it was blocking sage on python 3. 

The solution there by flagging the problematic doctests with "known bugs" is a bad solution, since the problem of the doctests is not wrong answers but  intermittent failures. 

This ticket would welcome a real solution. The aim is not to get correct answers for all cases in symbolic gcd computation, but to avoid uncontrolled failures.
