Keywords: giac

Is this a known issue?  Using sage 8.3 beta 6.


```
    sage: var('t')
    sage: integrate(exp(t)/(t + 1)^2,t,algorithm="giac")
    undef

```

But using `giac` directly, it can integrate it with no problem


```
    >giac
    // Using locale /usr/share/locale/
    // en_US.utf8
    // /usr/share/locale/
    // giac
    // UTF-8

So why did `sage` return `udef` for this result?

First time reporting bug to sage. I do not know what all the options to select from the menu below. Feel free to change as needed.

Thank you,

Regarding the bug: maybe the `Ei` in the result could not be converted to Sage?

Regarding the Trac ticket: not sure if this belongs to "interfaces" or "symbolics".

Was this fixed in another ticket? This is what I get with Sage 8.3.rc3:

```
sage: version()
'SageMath version 8.3.rc3, Release Date: 2018-07-28'
sage: t = SR.var('t')
sage: integrate(exp(t)/(t + 1)^2, t, algorithm="giac")
integrate(e^t/(t + 1)^2, t)
```

Oh, I see, instead of `undef` I got the unevaluated integral back.

Slightly better than `undef`, but if Giac can compute it we would like to get the evaluated result.

Well, with giac 1.9 which has just been allowed from the system I get

```
sage -t --long --random-seed=138683552333987748337622634611718883378 /usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sage/calculus/calculus.py

Failed example:

Got:

I haven't really checked whether it can be simplified to the previous form or not.

In fact, when you simplify the second expression, it is indeed equivalent to the first.
