(split out from #31982)

We change the function `sage.modules.free_module.element_class` so that it uses the element class `Vector_symbolic_dense` not only for free modules over the ring `SR` but also for free modules over any commutative ring whose base ring is `SR`.

In fact, we dispatch through a new method `_free_module_element_class_dense`.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31999
