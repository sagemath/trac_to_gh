Well, I thought this one was safe. Not so!

A .sage file exhibiting the problem

If you could narrow it down, that would be helpful.   I'm adding this to the description, as well as the graphic.

But I should point out that there are lots of cool examples of "simplification" actually making things simpler.  Could this just be a loss of significance error? Otherwise, try 

```
sage: plot(((x^3+4)^2-x^6)/x^3,(x,0,10^6))
```

(courtesy of the calculus text we currently teach from here).

So I'm more concerned about the left end of your graph than the right.

The attached picture actually is for #12795, but as it was the same, it's still worth posting here too.  I think they are probably both invalid, or more precisely are warnings about how rewriting expressions in different ways allows for a lot of numerical error to creep in.  Good stuff.  (Not good enough for me to want to teach a numerical analysis course, but good enough for me to want to _take_ a numerical analysis course...)
