Keywords: finite_state_machine

Inspired by the (Di)graph_generators, provide a class
`TransducerGenerators` where commonly usable transducers
performing simple tasks can be collected. As for graphs,
an abbreviation transducers is injected in the global
namespace by a lazy_import.
    
To start with, there is a Identity transducer and
a `CountSubblockOccurrences` transducer.

During the review, I rewrote parts of the docstring of the new generator file (inserted some text at the top; some minor changes). Please review those changes.

For me this is a positive review (all tests pass, docs looking fine, coverage 100%), so if someones agrees with my changes, change the status of this ticket.
