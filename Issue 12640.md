Here is the problem:

```
sage: P1 = toric_varieties.P1()
sage: print sum([P1.divisor(1)])
V(s) + V(t)
```

Which I think comes from

```
sage: print P1.divisor(1).parent()(0)
V(s)
```

Perhaps, we can allow creation of divisors by indices of rays/variables, but only in the form `P1.divisor(0)`? Since zero in the group of divisors should be just zero and other integers don't really make sense.

Hi Volker,

I looked through the code and a possible solution is to catch integers in `_element_constructor_` of `ToricDivisorGroup` instead of passing them down to `ToricDivisor`. "Catch" means replace 0 with `None` to construct the trivial divisor and raise an exception for anything else.

It is not very elegant, but keeps current functionality and `X.divisor(i)` returning the divisor of the i-th ray still seems quite reasonable to me, while `X.divisor_group()(i)` is questionable.

If you agree, I'll make the change and try to make it clear in the documentation of all the methods involved.

Why can't this go into 5.0? It is a bugfix, not an enhancement, and it is small and non-invasive.
