CC:  borassi dcoudert dimpase vdelecroix

This (very unpleasant) ticket attempts to clean a bit more the content of `Graph.__init__`.

To this end, it creates a `graph_input` modules that gathers into individual functions the different pieces of code that build a graph from <any other data>.

Admittedly, this is just one step toward a cleaner graph constructor, but we are not there yet.

Nothing smart is done in this branch: the pieces of code from `Graph.__init__` are moved to new individual functions (some variables/parameters are renamed). One from `DiGraph.__init__` is moved too.

In particular, some pieces of code from `DiGraph.__init__` may eventually be merged with the functions that this branch creates, but this will be done later.

This branch is already sufficiently long and sufficiently unpleasant to write/review `:-/`

Would it be possible in this ticket to add support for constructing a graph by `[V, E]` like this:

```
sage: V = [1,2,3,4]
sage: E = [[1,2]]
sage: Graph([V, E])
```

I know I can do it like this

```
sage: G = Graph({1:[2], 2:[], 3:[], 4:[]})
sage: G.vertices()
[1, 2, 3, 4]
```

but this is somewhat cumbersome (and doesn't work for graphs with labeled (multiple) edges). The other way I know how to do this is I have to pass the edge set, then add the vertices.

The reason I ask is because I have wanted to create immutable graphs with larger vertex sets than the connectivity of the edges and I don't want to have to waste time copying a mutable graph backend into the static backend. (As an additional reason, it also follows the basic intro to combinatorics definition of a graph.)

I should also be able to review this ticket too (and I definitely will if you make the above change).

```
sage: Graph({1:{2:['l1','l2']}},multiedges=True).edges()
[(1, 2, 'l1'), (1, 2, 'l2')]
```


See also `Graph.to_dictionary` which generates this kind of output.

- `Note: This is a internal...` -> 'an internal`?

Preliminary tests are ok and the doc build and display properly.
I'm currently running tests on `sage/graphs/`. I'll let you know soon.

well, he adds these numbers by hand. 
If you think it's OK, then it's OK with me, too.
