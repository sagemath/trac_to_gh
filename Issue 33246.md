I doubt if changes like

```diff
-#language = None
+# language = None
...
-    #'sage.misc.nested_class_test', # for test only
+    # 'sage.misc.nested_class_test', # for test only
```

are improvements. They are not genuine comments but commented-out lines to make them ineffective. If the line is uncommented later, then the single space is left and causes a trouble.
