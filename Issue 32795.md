Hi,

earlier this year I had a lot of trouble because doctest/forker.py was leaking pipes to the point that it was reaching the file handle limit.

I reported this here:
https://groups.google.com/g/sage-packaging/c/1G_3JiIcbvY

It was eventually fixed with a patch here:
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=986527#111

I'm not sure why nobody else seems to have this issue, but could the patch be applied here?

Best,
Tobias

Could you put the patch on a branch please?

I do frequently see "Too many open files" errors when running parallel tests on macOS.
