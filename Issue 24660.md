# Issue 24660: cantor_product does an infinite loop

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24897

```
sage: from sage.misc.mrange import cantor_product
sage: c = cantor_product([1])
sage: c.next()
(1,)
sage: c.next()


```


The blank line at the end is intentional as that is just what cantor_product does. It hangs. --> ctrl + c. I would expect it to rather raise a stop iteration.

same looping with

```
cantor_product([1], [1])
cantor_product([1,2], [1])
cantor_product([1], [1,2])
```

looks good to me.
Bot failures seem unrelated.
