There is a simple bug and a strange behaviour:

```
sage: import sage.combinat.diagram_algebras as da
sage: pd = da.PartitionDiagrams(2.5)
sage: pd.cardinality()
15
sage: len(list(pd))
52
sage: pd.cardinality()
15
sage: len(pd.list())
52
sage: pd.cardinality()
52
```

The implementation of `PartitionDiagrams.cardinality` is a trivial mistake, and easy to fix.  It currently reads:

```
        if self.order in ZZ:
            return bell_number(2*self.order)
        return bell_number(2*(self.order-1/2))
```
but should be

```
        return bell_number(2*self.order)
```

However, I do not understand why, after invoking `PartitionDiagrams(2.5).list()`, the method from `finite_enumerated_sets` is used, and I do not understand why this is not the case when invoking `list(PartitionDiagrams(2.5))`.

Why does this depend on #25462?

`list(foo)` calls the iterator first before `foo.list()`, so it does not set `cardinality` to `_cardinality_from_list`. This is the correct behavior and nothing strange about it. If there was no bug, you would never notice the difference.

Because after #25462 the output order changes, and there is no point in changing the doctests twice.  But if you wish, I can do this, too.

Yes, I do not know how to make this properly depend on #25462.  If you do pull in #25462, the output order will be correct.

Martin, you were the one who tweaked the `__contains__`.

Something closer to bikeshedding, but I would want changed before a positive review is splitting the lines for the `NotImplementedError` messages (to ~80 char/line) and making them more concise:

```diff
-            raise NotImplementedError("from_involution_permutation_triple is only implemented for Brauer diagrams of integer order, not for order %s" %(self.order))
+            raise NotImplementedError("only implemented for integer order,"
+                                      " not for order %s" % (self.order))
```
and same for `symmetric_diagrams`. Similar for the output in the doctests.

No, if I recall correctly, I made this ticket a dependency of #25662.  So this ticket should go in first, then #25659 (which is independent of this ticket), and finally #25662.
