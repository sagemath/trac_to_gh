# Issue 29513: Fix a bug in singular points computation of projective curves

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29750

Original creator: klee

Original creation time: 2020-05-28 12:07:25

We fix the bug revealed in:

```
sage: P2.<x0,x1,x2> = ProjectiveSpace(2, GF(3))
sage: C = Curve(x0)
sage: C.singular_closed_points()
...
ZeroDivisionError: Cannot invert 0
sage: C._singularities
...
ZeroDivisionError: Cannot invert 0
```
