CC:  nbruin mantepse

This ticket changes the default text display preference for the text-based backends `BackendIPythonCommandline` and `BackendDoctest` from `None` (unspecified) to `"plain"`. This was brought up on [sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/fXrv4JC6NEI).

This change only affects the behavior of `pretty_print`. The `pretty_print` output defaults to Latex if the text display preference is not specified, which is unsuitable for text-based backends. After setting the default to `"plain"`, the output is plain text.


```
sage: pretty_print(x^12)
\newcommand{\Bold}[1]{\mathbf{#1}}x^{12}
sage: %display plain
sage: pretty_print(x^12)
x^12
```


Besides changing the defaults, this ticket adds improvements to the documentation. In particular, the documentation of `pretty_print` now more clearly expresses what the function does. The implementation of `pretty_print` is left unchanged.

Moreover, a context manager `local_display_preferences` for temporarily changing the display preferences is added. Although not strictly necessary, this simplifies the doctests testing the behavior of text display `None` which is the default in the notebooks.

----

For reference, this is the backend hierarchy:

- `BackendBase`
    - `BackendSimple` (used for .sage scripts)
    - [✔] `BackendDoctest`
    - `BackendTest` (mock backend for testing)
    - `BackendSageNB`
    - `BackendIPython`
        - [✔] `BackendIPythonCommandline`
            - `BackendEmacs`
        - `BackendIPythonNotebook`
        - `BackendCell` (sage cell server)

The default preferences for all the other backends are left unchangend. In particular this applies to `BackendSimple`, as it is meant to be minimalistic and only supports plain text output anyway, so `pretty_print` does not use Latex output with this backend.

> How about outside of the doctesting framework? I myself do not use rich text output much. But if you do and find yourself frequently changing text preferences, doesn't it make sense to import `display_context` into the global namespace so that you do not need to import it in each session?

For interactive use, I would just use the magic `%display unicode_art` for instance, so adding `display_context` to the global namespace does not seem necessary. I have added that magic to my sage.init file and rarely change it. I have difficulty to think of a non-hypothetical use-case in library code, so I admit this is not so useful outside doctests.

For doctesting rich output textual representations, functions like `ascii_art()`, `unicode_art()` are commonly used. So I don't see a room for `display_context` there.

For the documentation of `pretty_print`, `%display` magic should be used rather than `display_context` since that is what Sage users use to change preferences. Since `%display` errors out in doctests, we need to tag it `# not tested` 

In conclusion, I don't see any real necessity or benefit of `display_context` in Sage.
