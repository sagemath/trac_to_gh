This is preparation for #18805 - `Add didactical implementation of tableau cutting planes to interactive_simplex_method`
and in fact split out from the larger patch there.

While preparing this patch, I noticed that the code in current Sage is not able to plot some LPs with irrational data (this is now #21270).
The code on this ticket does not fix this; it actually has a different failure mode for this example.


Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20570
