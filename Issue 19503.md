Shouldn't the `DEPRECATION_NOTICE` be shown only when the "default" notebook is run?

And I certainly think this ticket needs a discussion on sage-devel (I have no opinion on the matter).

Small wording suggestion: change "The default notebook implementation changed" to "The default notebook implementation has changed".

Maybe it should say "The default notebook implementation has changed to Jupyter notebooks". I would prefer it if there were a method to convert old-style notebooks to new ones and that the deprecation notice described this method. I'm not sure if this is important enough to hold up a positive review for this ticket.

What happens to the Sage app on OS X? It starts a SageNB notebook server by default. Shouldn't that change, too? And print some sort of deprecation warning? I don't even see a way directly from the app to start a Jupyter server.

Does the script decide which tickets to merge? I thought that was still done by a human, or am I wrong?

In any case, I added #21267 as dependency, which is not merged yet.

A couple initial comments:


```
Please wait while the SageNB export server starts...
[W 14:11:04.595 NotebookApp] server_extensions is deprecated, use nbserver_extensions
```

Is this a problem?

Also, there doesn't seem to be a "batch" way to convert notebooks - one could imagine someone who used worksheets for daily class and now has to convert dozens at once.  I know that the command-line interface to this should, or at least I thought I tried that out once.  Could the converter support this?  (I realize this is asking a lot.)

There is no information in the launch message as to where these notebooks are saved.  Turns out it is in the directory you launch from - dangerous for newbies to the Jupyter, especially if they have only launched with the Mac app bundle.  Also would cause that directory to get quite cluttered.

Is there a way to get output to typeset in Jupyter?  I don't know the answer.

Obviously, I get

```
NameError: name 'DATA' is not defined
```

when I rely on that.  Any solutions in mind for what to do with this folder?  Where do people using Jupyter keep data (in this case, an image file)?  I imagine there is a canonical answer to that but I'm not familiar with it.

Final comments. 
*  Interacts and even 3d stuff in the Jupyter notebook (done this way, I don't know about in general) seems ... very slow.  I think that lag explains the double images I occasionally see in interacts.  And since the only indication a cell isn't done is the little asterisk on the side, it's very different in style from sagenb.  That isn't a criticism but a comment.  I still feel ipynb is made more for power users... but anyway maybe the lag is weird.  Even `2+2` in a brand new notebook takes forever.  Maybe the issue is that the sagenb didn't start until Sage was started, but ipynb can open before the Sage kernel is "ready", Sage is notorious for taking forever to start up.

* `ERROR:root:Cell magic `%%fortran` not found.`

* I have similar problems with `%%cython` though it completes running such a cell.

----

As to the exporter itself, looks very nice. Thoughts:
*  I suspect it isn't possible to click on the "use Sage notebook" button once one has started converting, correct?  A message to that effect would be nice.
* A message for using the converter that says "your stuff will be saved in the following location" would be good - probably could be gotten on the fly from `pwd`, right?
* Ideally you'd get to click a button that says "remember my decision" for the default, but that might be too much extra work.
* More importantly, the button to the Jupyter just gives you a file listing - again, maybe not so helpful.  Ideas about what the default should be - maybe opening a new notebook with Sage kernel?

Here's why: any user who has not used the command line except to start the notebook (in particular, Mac app users) will be completely lost trying to find them if they are sent to the `pwd`.

Yeah, I would hope we could have a pretty lengthy beta period for this 8.0, even if that means a few tickets have to wait to get in as I guess 8.0 is only about this and a few attendant things.  There are a few lists I'd like to spam about testing this out once a download of a beta becomes available (preferably also a Mac app version of the download, only for testing purposes).

That should be fixable by chdir-ing to $HOME in the mac app...

Absolutely, but would have to be implemented - I don't want to ask a user who thinks dollar signs are for money to do it :-)

What happens with this in Jupyter?  Is it a supported thing (whether single or double percent)?

```
%hide

Same question for `#auto`/`%auto`.  These will be in many converted worksheets.
