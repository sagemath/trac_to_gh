Shouldn't the `DEPRECATION_NOTICE` be shown only when the "default" notebook is run?

And I certainly think this ticket needs a discussion on sage-devel (I have no opinion on the matter).

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2016-01-02 01:00:43

Small wording suggestion: change "The default notebook implementation changed" to "The default notebook implementation has changed".

Maybe it should say "The default notebook implementation has changed to Jupyter notebooks". I would prefer it if there were a method to convert old-style notebooks to new ones and that the deprecation notice described this method. I'm not sure if this is important enough to hold up a positive review for this ticket.

What happens to the Sage app on OS X? It starts a SageNB notebook server by default. Shouldn't that change, too? And print some sort of deprecation warning? I don't even see a way directly from the app to start a Jupyter server.

I would more than prefer it.

Well, I guess you can launch any terminal command from the app, but I don't think it's been updated to have a script dedicated to launching ipynb (though you can get some terminals).  Maybe at least adding this should be part of this as well as changing its launch page to note the new situation; I think it's unlikely to be good to change behavior for this audience without a clear "abort" situation and very clear instructions on how to migrate at a later time.

True, but one could presumably manually decide not to merge certain things until a certain release, eh?

Does the script decide which tickets to merge? I thought that was still done by a human, or am I wrong?

In any case, I added #21267 as dependency, which is not merged yet.

In all honesty, I think the best way to know what it's about is just to checkout this branch and run `sage -n`. One interactive web-app says so much more than 1000 words :-)

Comment by kcrisman created at 2017-03-17 18:13:17

A couple initial comments:


```
Please wait while the SageNB export server starts...
[W 14:11:04.595 NotebookApp] server_extensions is deprecated, use nbserver_extensions
```

Is this a problem?

Also, there doesn't seem to be a "batch" way to convert notebooks - one could imagine someone who used worksheets for daily class and now has to convert dozens at once.  I know that the command-line interface to this should, or at least I thought I tried that out once.  Could the converter support this?  (I realize this is asking a lot.)


---

Comment by kcrisman created at 2017-03-17 18:20:37

There is no information in the launch message as to where these notebooks are saved.  Turns out it is in the directory you launch from - dangerous for newbies to the Jupyter, especially if they have only launched with the Mac app bundle.  Also would cause that directory to get quite cluttered.

Is there a way to get output to typeset in Jupyter?  I don't know the answer.

Obviously, I get

```
NameError: name 'DATA' is not defined
```

when I rely on that.  Any solutions in mind for what to do with this folder?  Where do people using Jupyter keep data (in this case, an image file)?  I imagine there is a canonical answer to that but I'm not familiar with it.


---

Comment by kcrisman created at 2017-03-17 18:25:24

Can Sage in Jupyter plot in R mode?  E.g.

```
%%r
x <- rnorm(100)
y <- rnorm(100, mean=5)*x+rnorm(100, mean=0.1)
png()
plot(y ~ x)
abline(lm(y ~ x), lwd=2)
.silent.me. <- dev.off()
```

not sure how to/whether possible to fix this; it was hard enough to get working in the sagenb lo these many years ago.

Interacts library fails.

```
interacts.calculus.simpson_integration()
```

(To be fair, I'm not sure whether this works right in the sagenb any more either.)

For worksheets that are not in the `~/.sage` directory but are `.sws` files, you can loop over them and combine `sage -sws2rst` and `sage -rst2ipynb` commands.

Layout parameters for interacts do not seem to work properly.  E.g.

```
val1(v1,v23,v24,v34,v234,a)=v1-a*(v23+v24+v34)-v234
val2(v2,v13,v14,v34,v134,a)=v2-a*(v13+v14+v34)-v134
val3(v3,v12,v14,v24,v124,a)=v3-a*(v12+v14+v24)-v124
val4(v4,v12,v13,v23,v123,a)=v4-a*(v12+v13+v23)-v123

`@`interact(layout=[['v1','v2','v3','v4'],['v12','v13','v14','v23','v24','v34'],['v123','v124','v134','v234']])
def _(v1=[0,1],v2=[0,1],v3=[0,1],v4=[0,1],v12=[0,1],v13=[0,1],v14=[0,1],v23=[0,1],v24=[0,1],v34=[0,1],v123=[0,1],v124=[0,1],v134=[0,1],v234=[0,1]):
    html("Banzhaf values are %s,%s,%s,%s"%(val1(v1,v23,v24,v34,v234,1),val2(v2,v13,v14,v34,v134,1),val3(v3,v12,v14,v24,v124,1),val4(v4,v12,v13,v23,v123,1)))
    html("Shapley-Shubik values are %s,%s,%s,%s"%(val1(v1,v23,v24,v34,v234,1/2),val2(v2,v13,v14,v34,v134,1/2),val3(v3,v12,v14,v24,v124,1/2),val4(v4,v12,v13,v23,v123,1/2)))

Sure!  But most people's will be in that directory, and people who need this facility will not know shell script enough to loop through them.  (Interesting that the `sws2rst` and `rst2ipynb` double conversion is robust!)

JSmol menu doesn't seem to work quite right - I can get the menu with right-click, but then the second levels do not appear because of some barrier.  I know this is perhaps moot if three.js is now ready, but wanted to point this out.

(As a side note, the first time you log on the the Jupyter it asks for a token - but it doesn't want the URL for the token, it wants just the token that appears in the terminal message.  Possibly really confusing?)

Final comments. 
 *  Interacts and even 3d stuff in the Jupyter notebook (done this way, I don't know about in general) seems ... very slow.  I think that lag explains the double images I occasionally see in interacts.  And since the only indication a cell isn't done is the little asterisk on the side, it's very different in style from sagenb.  That isn't a criticism but a comment.  I still feel ipynb is made more for power users... but anyway maybe the lag is weird.  Even `2+2` in a brand new notebook takes forever.  Maybe the issue is that the sagenb didn't start until Sage was started, but ipynb can open before the Sage kernel is "ready", Sage is notorious for taking forever to start up.

 * `ERROR:root:Cell magic `%%fortran` not found.`

 * I have similar problems with `%%cython` though it completes running such a cell.

----

As to the exporter itself, looks very nice. Thoughts:
 *  I suspect it isn't possible to click on the "use Sage notebook" button once one has started converting, correct?  A message to that effect would be nice.
 * A message for using the converter that says "your stuff will be saved in the following location" would be good - probably could be gotten on the fly from `pwd`, right?
 * Ideally you'd get to click a button that says "remember my decision" for the default, but that might be too much extra work.
 * More importantly, the button to the Jupyter just gives you a file listing - again, maybe not so helpful.  Ideas about what the default should be - maybe opening a new notebook with Sage kernel?

Yes this happens sometimes. This issue randomly appears for me, which I really do not understand. Yesterday I got this problem and started working on it and then the problem suddenly disappeared and now I cannot reproduce it anymore. Really strange...

True, that's the usual Jupyter behaviour. I wouldn't change this, simply because that is how Jupyter works.

What's wrong with the Mac app bundle (I am not a Mac user)?

I was not even aware of the existence of this "interacts library". But I guess it could be fixed...

That's the way how Jupyter works and see no reason to change that.

I was not aware of the `interact(layout)` parameter (it does not appear on the many examples from the Sage interacts wiki page that I tried). I need to see if this can be ported to Jupyter.

I am really a beginner when it comes to web development. If somebody else wants to implement the user interface for this, I will gladly implement the server part of that feature.

Is it? That would be good news. And a surprise to me indeed, at least
for the second part which I still consider as a quick hack.

> What's wrong with the Mac app bundle (I am not a Mac user)?
Nothing is wrong with it (or maybe it is? I didn't test it yet), but people who had used it would be completely clueless as to this since they wouldn't have been exposed to command line at all, in principle, much less having to save it somewhere.
> > ... %%cython
> What do you mean? Which problems do you have?
The cell runs, but then I can't use the function defined in it.  `%%fortran` is not recognized; `%%r` works but no graphics.
> I was not aware of the interact(layout) parameter (it does not appear on the many examples from the Sage interacts wiki page that I tried). I need to see if this can be ported to Jupyter.
That is very understandable, as it is not used there much, more in later things.  I do know a fair number of people who have used it, and if it can't be emulated it means multi-input interacts become far less useful (because too hard to see all the controls at once).
> I am really a beginner when it comes to web development. If somebody else wants to implement the user interface for this, I will gladly implement the server part of that feature.
Hmm, I guess I am even more of a beginner there :) What I would say is that the UI at a very minimum could have a warning the top saying something like "Want to export several worksheets at once?  Click here for precise instructions on how to do this." and then have said precise instructions, including giving them the custom path to use with the scripts in question.  

Otherwise one would have to implement checkboxes, some sort of GET (?) operation, and then have an interface for where to save them (presumably not ALL at once in the usual directory, but a sub-directory) and now you're getting complicated.  Plus then one wouldn't have the once-off "click on this worksheet to export it" feature, which is very nice, unless you separated _that_ from the checkboxes ...

Update - works in sagenb still, though some stuff does not pretty print any more, as that was apparently not updated.

Yup.  See also #22644.

I regularly use `%%cython` myself and never found any problems with it in Jupyer.

Still, if it does not work for you, please open a ticket with more details (in particular an actual `.ipynb` file demonstrating the problem).

For batch conversion, how about just a link to download all notebooks (converted and zipped up). That would be easy to implement (ideally not on this ticket).

I'll merge this ticket when 7.6 is out...

Comment by kcrisman created at 2017-03-22 02:57:42

> kcrisman: what would be needed for you to give positive review to this ticket?

List (modulo merging this ticket and opening new 8.0 blockers for these):

* Some kind of batch conversion option (perhaps as Volker suggests), including detailed instructions as to exactly where they end up.  Opening a dialog as to where to save them would be really by far the best.  Here's why: any user who has not used the command line except to start the notebook (in particular, Mac app users) will be completely lost trying to find them if they are sent to the `pwd`.  In the Mac app that is in the midst of the bundle.
* Probably more wording on the export main page about exactly what it's doing, where things end up.  That wouldn't be too hard to get feedback on once one sends a beta out for testing.  Maybe that would include instructions on what to do to start a new notebook in Jupyter, how to get "text cells", typesetting as in the recent sage-devel post, etc.
* Testing whether this works properly with Mac app bundle at startup etc.  I have no idea how this interfaces with it (haven't had time to test that), but if we send 8.0 and basically drop GUI Mac support, that is really bad marketing.
* I would say that supporting remaining interact stuff (beyond what Jeroen has already fixed) would not be blocker, except that I think that Jupyter would be the only interface not supporting the layout parameter - is that correct?

A lot of this will be revealed in heavy testing.  We should definitely recruit _non_-Jupyter users to test this out.  Don't skimp!

I like that; it falls in a usual workflow for users, with an explicit flexibility to choose where to store the notebooks.

I don't think all that should be on the export page. "more wording on the export main page about exactly what it's doing" sounds like a good idea, but explaining everything about Jupyter notebooks not.

Yup; better link to a good existing notebook tutorial rather than duplicating one there. One option would be to link to [existing thematic tutorial](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/thematic_tutorials/tutorial-notebook-and-help-long.html) after having updated it w.r.t. the Jupyter notebook.

With Sébastien, we will be running this tutorial at the upcoming Sage Days in Montréal at the end of April; this would be a good occasion to beta test it (and work on it beforehand).

Well, to be honest, none of this can be done easily in Jupyter:

Indeed. That's why we need a round of beta test to see in practice
what's the best way to present a tutorial with similar aims but using
the Jupyter notebook.

Sure, that is fine, I didn't mean that you needed a ridiculously long first page, but making info easy to find is important.

Yeah, I would hope we could have a pretty lengthy beta period for this 8.0, even if that means a few tickets have to wait to get in as I guess 8.0 is only about this and a few attendant things.  There are a few lists I'd like to spam about testing this out once a download of a beta becomes available (preferably also a Mac app version of the download, only for testing purposes).

See #19881 which was merged quite a while ago - I have never tried that out but perhaps it would be easy to integrate with this.

Replying to [comment:63 kcrisman]:

That should be fixable by chdir-ing to $HOME in the mac app...

Absolutely, but would have to be implemented - I don't want to ask a user who thinks dollar signs are for money to do it :-)

What happens with this in Jupyter?  Is it a supported thing (whether single or double percent)?

```
%hide
```

Same question for `#auto`/`%auto`.  These will be in many converted worksheets.
