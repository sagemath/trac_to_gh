CC:  @videlec @kiwifb

The auto-generating of `src/sage/ext/interpreters/*` and `src/sage/libs/pari/auto*.pxi` should be done with a `Makefile` which has proper dependency checking.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18095

Am I correct to understand that you removed the ability to do `sage-build -b`(or `sage -b -b`, if I read the source correctly, though I don't know if this version ever was intended to work) in order to perform a more aggressive rebuild? I have nothing against removing it, but this ”feature“ was mentioned on sage-support, so perhaps its removal should be a bit more explicit.

Also, perhaps the calls to `build_sage "$`@`"` in `sage/bin/sage` should be changed to just `build_sage` (and the corresponding `shift`s removed when they serve no other purpose) for clarity.

(I only had a quick look at the changes and did not even test them.)

Do you have a link?

Shouldn't the `sage` make target depend on `csage`? Or is

```
all:
        $(MAKE) csage
        $(MAKE) sage
```
a workaround because the way `csage` is built makes it hard to set up the dependency without rebuilding `csage` every time? If that's the case, perhaps add a comment to that effect.

There is already some logic in `build/deps` such that when running `make`, then `csage` is built before `sage`.

I wouldn't call it a "workaround", it's more a separation of concerns. The default target `all` builds both, so there is no dependency issue either.

In any case: I would like to remove `csage` completely (see #17854), so this issue will disappear anyway.

The build is unfortunately *never* done in parallel (since `./sage -b` uses `scons`, `cython` and `distutils`, which are not aware of `make` arguments). That's why you're supposed to do `MAKE="make -j4" make` in Sage, the environment variable can easily be read by Sage.

In any case if you have a concern that csage and sage could be built in parallel you should make csage a dependency of sage (made need to add a `phony` for that to work since `csage` is not a file).
