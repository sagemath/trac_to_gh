Now for example `Posets.ChainPoset(500)` takes about 10 second. It does something like 1) make a list, 2) make a poset from list, checking that list really is acyclic as when read as digraph edges and 3) make a lattice from poset, checking that poset really is lattice. Phase 3 is done by really generating meet- and join-matrix.

Poset and lattice creating functions need an option that says "do not check, trust blindly".

Travis, I guess we should close this one. But to be sure:

First, if I just say `n = 500; L1 = LatticePoset((range(n), [[x,x+1] for x in range(n-1)]))` it takes about two seconds. But if I say


```
n = 500
D = DiGraph([range(n), [[x,x+1] for x in range(n-1)]], format='vertices_and_edges')
from sage.combinat.posets.lattices import FiniteLatticePoset
L2 = FiniteLatticePoset(D, range(n), FiniteLatticePosets(), True)
```


it takes only 10 or 20 millisecods. Can you confirm that this works, and so there is a way to override check "is this poset really a poset (i.e. acyclic transitive reduction of graph)"?

Second, another possibility is that the code could directly compute le-matrix, MÃ¶bius function matrix etc, and those would be very easy for a chain, diamond and so one. But that is a place for another ticket.

Third, it is unnecessary to re-compute meet- or join-matrix. But that is a duplicate of #20434 or #18776.

Do you mean only mandatory checks, i.e. `is_poset` and having a join matrix and a bottom element (or meet matrix and top), or more precomputation?

Ah, the "hasse diagram" -parameter is not Hasse diagram in a sense that `hasse_diagram.py` defines... I.e. it is just a DiGraph with some properties as an unlabeled graph. So something like this could work:


```
from sage.combinat.posets.lattices import FiniteLatticePoset
from sage.categories.finite_lattice_posets import FiniteLatticePosets
n = 10^12
Div_n = divisors(n)
D = DiGraph([Div_n, lambda a, b: b%a==0 and is_prime(b//a)])
L = FiniteLatticePoset(D, elements=Div_n, category=FiniteLatticePosets())
```


This is faster than current implementation, but could be made even faster with some thinking. Having a natural linear extension would even make some small examples better; currently `Posets.DivisorLattice(12).join_irreducibles()` will give `[2, 4, 3]`.
