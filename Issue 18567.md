This is a follow-up on #18734.

This ticket creates:
- a new class, `LPBackendDictionary` (inheriting from `LPAbstractDictionary`, would avoid InteractiveLP and rather be tied directly to the MILP backend, using tableau data query functions such as `getBInvArow` etc.
(It would be in a separate file perhaps `interactive_backend_dictionary.py`, so as not to add clutter to the didactical implementation in `interactive_simplex_method.py`.)

#18732 adds the missing functions for retrieving the data of the dictionary (for the GLPK backend) such as `getBInvARow` etc. (#18763 does the same for the COIN backend.)
#18733 provides corresponding `MixedIntegerLinearProgram` methods.

Doctests could then test that:
- A backend has implemented all the necessary methods to get tableau information.
- The information is consistent, by checking that the `LPBackendDictionary` (in this ticket) and the `LPDictionary` (created in #18734) are the same.
