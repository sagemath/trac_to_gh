Also the import of `cython_strip_string_literals` should be removed

In `src/sage/doctest/parsing.py`, do the examples under

```
Tolerance on Python 3 for string results with unicode prefix::
```

still make sense?

Changing keywords from "" to "unicode".

In `src/sage/typeset/character_art_factory.py`,
does this test still make sense?

```
    sage: from sage.typeset.ascii_art import _ascii_art_factory as factorysage: 
    factory.build_from_string('à\nbb\nccc')  # same with unicode
    à
    bb
    ccc
 
```
