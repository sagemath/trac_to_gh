# Issue 12269: singular does not respect global cxx flag

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/12441

Assignee: GeorgSWeber

singular does not fully respect the global CXX flag, we should fix this (for instance for #12426).

I've posted an spkg fixes this at
[http://wstein.org/home/ohanar/clang-port/sage-5.0.beta1-src/spkg/standard/singular-3-1-3-3.p5.spkg](http://wstein.org/home/ohanar/clang-port/sage-5.0.beta1-src/spkg/standard/singular-3-1-3-3.p5.spkg). (This is a review spkg in case there are more issues with clang down the road.)

Ooops, didn't see this ticket (as it was not listed on #2999 / #3000).

Since #12680 has meanwhile been merged into Sage 5.0.beta9, we should close this.  Sorry.

Positive review w.r.t. that this is now fixed by #12680, so *this ticket can be closed*.
