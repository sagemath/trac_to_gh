So there are some errors reported by the patchbot, but I am not sure if they are strictly due to this ticket.

Also, I bet you are probably doing things mechanically, but `if len(foo) > 0:` -> `if len(foo):` is better changed to `if foo:`. `;)`

Apparently, the failures are unrelated. I forgot to fix all the len things.. Could we please skip that ?
