Prerequisites for building on many platforms
are listed at

The empty homebrew section is not dealt with properly
and appears mixed with the next section, nix.

This is definitely better. Possible further improvements:

- adjust the display name of each distro,
  with proper capitalisation. Already done
  for Debian and for Fedora, could be done
  for Arch Linux, Cygwin, FreeBSD, etc.
- when the section is empty, add a sentence
  such as "The base distribution has all
  the necessary packages for building Sage."
- add a "copy" button near each command
  that copies the command (without prompt)
  to the clipboard; that would probably
  involve some JavaScript
- cosmetic adjustment: remove double spaces

Not necessarily for this ticket though.
