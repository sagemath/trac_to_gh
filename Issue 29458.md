Keywords: diagram algebra

We can assume that internal code is safe and so we can avoid checking that the result is a valid diagram (of the correct type). This gets approximately a 2x speedup.

With branch:

```
sage: R.<n> = ZZ[]
sage: for k in range(2,7):
....:     TL = TemperleyLiebAlgebra(k, n)
....:     B = list(TL.basis())
....:     %time TL._test_associativity(elements=B)
CPU times: user 0 ns, sys: 0 ns, total: 0 ns
Wall time: 1.28 ms
CPU times: user 16 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 16 ms

This also greatly improves the time to get the basis elements. Although the Temperley-Lieb could also benefit from a more specialized implementation of the multiplication and generation of the diagrams (see, e.g., the implementation in #29696).
