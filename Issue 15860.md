The Py2 builtin function `file()` is gone. It should be replaced with the `open()` builtin function. 

 
The type `file` is also gone. Checking for it may be replaced by `isinstance(f, io.IOBase)`

There are about 20 effected modules. 

This ticket is tracked as a dependency of meta-ticket ticket:16052.

In Python 2, `isinstance(f, file)` is not equivalent to `isinstance(f, io.IOBase)`.

I do give positive_review to the change from `file()` to `open()`.

In the few cases where `isinstance(data, file)` is used, I actually think such behaviour should be deprecated: force the user to call `foo(open(f).read())` instead of `foo(open(f))`.

Replying to [comment:7 jdemeyer]:
> The code in `lattice_polytope.py` is already deprecated anyway by #15240...

Only the `desc` parameter is deprecated there, not `data` being an instance of `file`.

Deprecation of `isinstance(data, file)` will be done in another ticket.
