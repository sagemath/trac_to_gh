# Issue 26974: Simplicial complexes: correct the documentation

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27211

Original creator: jhpalmieri

Original creation time: 2019-02-04 04:30:30

The documentation for simplicial complexes is outdated: it should say that the vertex set is determined automatically from the facets (as their union).

### Other than this, LGTM if the doc compiles (I don't have Sage installed, so I can't check) and if your claim about `maximal_faces` being a number is true (is there a doctest?).

Lines 980-981:

```
            sage: SimplicialComplex([2])
            Simplicial complex with vertex set (0, 1, 2) and facets {(0, 1, 2)}
```
