Keywords: infinite enumerated set slices

Given an infinite enumerated set `I`, I'd still expect this to work (and it's very handy):

```
sage: Partitions()[:5]
[[], [1], [2], [1, 1], [3]]
```

Hellooooooo Travis !!

Okay, this looks very cool but I have two questions:

1) Right now, if an infinite enumerated sets wants to implement `__getitem__` differently (as unrank can be VERY slow) then the slicing feature will be overwritten. Is there a way to avoid that ?

2) To me, computing the slice [:15] should call `__iter__`, which may have been overwritten too. What d you think ?

Those are probems I see with how this is implemented in your branch, but I do not know how to make it better, so I just ask. I am running all tests right now, and if they pass this branch can be set to `positive_review` if we cannot solve any of the problems above `:-)`

This kind of slices can indeed come up handy; thanks for implementing
them!

Could we put it instead in `EnumeratedSets`? This would just require updating
a bit the bound checks, possibly testing if ``self in
Sets().Infinite()``, right?

Also please make the doc read along the following lines::

```
Return the `i`-th element of ``self``, or the slice ...

INPUT:
...

.. WARNING::

    This method is only meant as a convenience shorthand for
    ``self.unrank(i)`` and ``self.foo(...)`` respectively, for casual
    use (e.g. in interactive sessions). Subclasses are hereby
    explicitly permitted to overload ``__getitem__`` with a different
    semantic, typically for enumerated sets that are naturally indexed
    by some `I` not of the form `\{0,1,...\}`.

    ... EXAMPLE HERE, typically with an infinite family ...

    In particular, generic code *should not* use this shorthand.
```


Any suggestion for the name `foo` we should use for the analog of
unrank for slices?

Cheers,
                        Nicolas

Thanks Travis!

The logic is broken for finite enumerated sets:

```
sage: F = FiniteEnumeratedSet([1,2,3])
sage: F[1:]
...
TypeError: range() integer end argument expected, got NoneType.
```

(in the current examples, `.list()` has already been called, so this piece of the code was not exercised). It might be an option to call `__getitem__` from `EnumeratedSets` to avoid duplicating the logic.

Please also add the warnings along the lines of [comment:6].

It seems to just duplicate the code of `unrank_range` for finite enumerated sets (which you made fast), and the `__getitem__` of enumerated sets will call that `unrank_range` anyway.

> I can't add crosslinks because there is no explicitly defined function unrank (at least that I could find). 

Too bad, we really should have an optional abstract method for `unrank` ...

Not much I agree. Yet, in general, unless when we really are in a critical path/section, I'd rather not start manually inlining method calls.

What about an iterator counterpart?

```
def iterator(self, start=None, end=None, backward=False):
    r"""
    Iterates over the item in this set between the rank ``start`` and ``end``.
    """
```

that would even be more useful (e.g. parallel loops).

Then we can make a cross implementation in the `ParentMethods` (i.e. `__iter__` calling `iterator` and `iterator` calling `__iter__`). Or possibly using `unrank`.

What do you think?
