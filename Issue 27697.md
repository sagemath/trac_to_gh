The current method to find the `radius` and the `diameter` of the graph calculates the `eccentricity` of the graph and them takes the `minimum` and `maximum` of all the eccentricities.

The method I have implemented here calculates the **vertex with minimum eccentricity** without computing the complete eccentricity of the graph. This information, along with the partially computed eccentricities of other nodes, acts as a `certificate` to find the radius and the diameter of the graph.

I am yet to implement the algorithm for the diameter.

I thought of doing this after implementing all the algorithms. I will be changing the functions (arguments, return values, etc.) depending on the callee methods, so I thought it'd be better to document it after implementing all the related algorithms.

And can I get a few examples of large graphs so that I can check the performance of my algorithm?

After exposing in eccentricity method, following unexpected behavior happens.I tried printing the values, there are lot of garbage values, some eccentricity are even 0.
this happens for many other graphs too.

I figured out my mistake. I was using `MemoryAllocator` for memory allocation and it was freeing all the memory on returing from function.
I am fixing that

One thing, I would like to mention. I haven't added reference [Dragan2018]_ in rst file. As we have added reference in #29715.
Do we need to add it here too?

Taking the above idea, I had done similar modification in unweighted version. Benefit of this modification is overall consistency and one less loop. Although there is slight reduction in simplicity of code, but in my opinion its not that much.\\
