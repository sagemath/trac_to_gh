CC:  tscrim

Keywords: vector, derivation

In Sage 8.7, we have

```
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M')
sage: X.<x,y> = M.chart()
sage: p = M((2,-1), name='p')
sage: TpM = M.tangent_space(p)
sage: v = TpM((-2, 3), name='v'); v
Tangent vector v at Point p on the 2-dimensional differentiable manifold M
sage: f = M.scalar_field(x*y^2, name='f')
sage: v(f)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: the argument no. 1 must be a linear form
```

Note that this works for vector *fields*:

```
sage: w = M.vector_field(name='w')
sage: w[:] = -y, x
sage: w.display()
w = -y d/dx + x d/dy
sage: w(f)
Scalar field w(f) on the 2-dimensional differentiable manifold M
sage: w(f).display()
w(f): M --> R
   (x, y) |--> 2*x^2*y - y^3
```

This issue has been reported in this [ask.sagemath question](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/46593/tangent-space-vector-mapping/).

A good general rule that you should follow is to not overwrite `__call__`. Instead, the typical thing to do is implement an `_act_on_` (or `_acted_upon_`), and let the coercion framework handle the dispatching.

Ah, I see. I saw act in the ticket and was thinking it should behave like a normal action (and be written with a binary operation such as multiplication). So sorry about that noise there. I guess this is fine since it is done on an element and not a parent. (As a side note, it is actually `__call__` that starts the dispatch to the coercion framework, not something that is dealt out from it.)

Only other thing you need to address is changing `EXAMPLES::` -> `EXAMPLES:` to get a positive review.

No problem. Actually I should have used "behave" instead of "act" to avoid any confusion (there is indeed no group action here).

For my own instruction, can you tell by which magic this is done (given that `__call__` is not redefined in the base class `Element`)?

It is `Parent.__call__` that starts the process off. However, you can explicit invoke the coercion framework by importing the `coercion_model` within your own class. There are also things like ``@`coerce_binop` as helpers too.
