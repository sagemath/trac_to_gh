In this ticket we speed up Killing form calculations for finite-dimensional Kac-Moody algebras. 

We bypass the calculation from definition (i.e. via the trace of composition of adjoint matrices) using knowledge on how root spaces are paired and the fact that the symmetrized Cartan matrix is a multiple of the Killing form.
