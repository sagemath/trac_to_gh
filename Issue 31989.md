`sage.numerical.sdp` and the backends `cvxopt_backend` and `cvxopt_sdp_backend` are underdeveloped and unmaintained to the point of being unusable. `SemidefiniteProgram`, introduced over 5 years ago, is not used anywhere in the Sage library.

Given the brittle build system of `cvxopt` (#31905, #32087, and of its dependency `suitesparse` (#30478), we will be better off making them optional instead of standard packages.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32226

I disagree. Most of Sage functionality is not used by sagelib, it's absolutely not a reason to remove it.
Besides, it's the only SDP backend we have at the moment.

A number of publications I have depend on this functionality, and perhaps more.

Note that this ticket does not remove `cvxopt`, it merely makes it `optional` - same status as `cbc` and as many other well maintained software that some people use within sage

The problem is that `standard` packages really need to build on everyone's system, and right now there are unresolved issues (linked in the ticket description).

What's the practical difference between standard-but-optional and plain optional? Is it just the default value of `--enable-<pkg>` (yes vs no)?

It's a tiny bit annoying to have to remember to `--disable-cvxopt` when I'm building a branch that doesn't use cvxopt (i.e. pretty much all of them), but I guess that's no different than most packages that disable some things but enable others by default.
