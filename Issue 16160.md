I can see how that might be surprising. :)

IIRC, that was a conscious decision to expose the print order from Pynac to !Python/Sage to be used for sorting lists, etc. where symbolic expressions occur. I guess many places in the code call `cmp()` instead of using the comparison operators.

We would need to get rid of this design for Python 3 compatibility anyway. Shall we remove support for `cmp()` and change all places where lists are returned from symbolics to explicitly call the print order?

You probably mean https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!searchin/sage-devel/cmp/sage-devel/092yBmHfXQo/4qfS_JHLJdwJ and #16537, #17175. The newsgroup thread is mainly about equality/hashing and a bit of richcmp, not the two choices above. I am just starting to read about this.
