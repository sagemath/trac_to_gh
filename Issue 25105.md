Fixed by our upgrade to pip 9.0.3 in #25051 (we have pip 18.0 since #26008).

The error reported in this ticket had to do with a configuration change at PyPI
in April 2018 which prevented to pip install packages from PyPI using macOS
and pip 9.0.1.

See the discussion at #25051#comment:19.

Sage 8.1 had pip 9.0.1 but Sage 8.2 had pip 9.0.3.

Setting to duplicate/invalid/wontfix.
