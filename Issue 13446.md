OK, this is easy, I hope. I'll work on this tonight. As far as I understand, the base ring is RDF for all the backends, expect PPL.

Actually, is it even needed to provide base_ring() in the backends that have RDF as the base ring? Can't PPL backend just overwrite it? I gather Python has such an option:

```
    class A(object):
        ...
       def a(self):
           ....
    class  B(A):
       ...
       def _A__a(self):
           ...
     
```

so B overwrites A.a() this way. Or is this wrong/not applicable?

Yes, it would be desirable to define `base_ring()` in `GenericBackend` to be RDF and only override it as needed in derived classes.

I'll hook this into the LinearFunctionsParent, patch coming...

Does anybody mind if we typeset the linear functions more like polynomials? That is,

```
sage: R.<x_0,x_1> = QQ[]
sage: 1+2*x_0+3*x_1
2*x_0 + 3*x_1 + 1
```

instead of

```
sage: p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram()
sage: x = p.new_variable()
sage: 1+2*x[0]+3*x[1]
1 +2 x_0 +3 x_1
```

I think spaces around +/- and explicit * are more readable, and would make the output more uniform.

This is not what the classic file formats for inputting LPs do, see e.g.

http://www.gurobi.com/documentation/5.0/reference-manual/node746

Designed for punchcards, I reckon :-)

Myself, I'd prefer it polynomial way though. I think, ideally, this should be customizable.

The patch now enforces that the coefficients are in the base ring. Also, pretty printing is fixed. There is also a way to change the default for the multiplication symbol if you want to.

I noticed that the `mip.show()` code doesn't use the pretty printing of linear functions but rolls its own, so its output is unchanged for now.

Example of normalizing the coefficients:

```
    sage: p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram(maximization=False, solver = 'GLPK')
    sage: p.base_ring()
    Real Double Field
    sage: x = p.new_variable()
    sage: 0.5 + 3/2*x[1]
    0.5 + 1.5*x_0

    sage: p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram(maximization=False, solver = 'ppl')
    sage: p.base_ring()
    Rational Field
    sage: x = p.new_variable()
    sage: 0.5 + 3/2*x[1]
    1/2 + 3/2*x_0
```
