# Graph Theory Roadmap

This page aims at documenting the progress of the Graph Theory component of Sage.

# Comparison with other graph theory software

* [This](Mathematica-Graph-Theory-) page aims at comparing the features implemented in Mathematica that are missing in Sage.

# Missing features

## Graph constructions

The following (families of) graphs are still to be introduced into Sage:

* ?

## Graph predicates

* Testing if a graph is distance-transitive. See http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Distance-TransitiveGraph.html

## Graph operations

The following graph operations are still missing:

* ?

## Performance improvements

Following is a list of tasks that can be done more efficiently than in the current implementation.

* Computing the list of neighbouring vertices efficiently. See ticket #13730.
