# Issue 19987: Auto-generated PARI functions sometimes return 0 instead of None

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20224

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2016-03-16 17:15:31

When removing the manual `default()` method:

```
sage: pari.default("factor_proven", 1)
0
```

This really should not return anything, which means returning `None` in Python.
