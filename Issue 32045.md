scipy 1.6 added a vendored copy of the HiGHS LP solvers. https://github.com/scipy/scipy/tree/master/scipy/optimize/_highs/src

https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/optimize.linprog-highs.html

We should start using them.

https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/hall/HiGHS/ also claims to have MIP, but this does not seem to be exposed in scipy.optimize.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32282
