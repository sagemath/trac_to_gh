CC:  @mwageringel @fchapoton

Keywords: multivariate polynomial iteration

We should take advantage of methods being able to now use `yield` in Cython and add a method to iterate over `(coefficient, exponent)` pairs as this can be useful (instead of monomials).

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29595

Okay, I might have gone a bit overboard at the end. However, some of these little methods get some major speedups. There might be some other places to optimize. Definitely converting the generic multivariate polynomials to Cython will help and/or pushing more stuff to the polydict backend.

I was actually expecting a bit more of a speedup from the libsingular iterator, but I guess that just goes to show the speed of the builtin Python iterators. However, it still gets about a ~10% speedup, which is nice, beyond the memory savings.

I saw that and I was a little hesitant about changing it as I couldn't remember if we could create polynomials with coefficients in Python types, such as `int`. However, from looking at it a bit more, it seems like this cannot happen, so I will change it.
