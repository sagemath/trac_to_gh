fixed the dehomogenization to allow for different coordinates in domain and codomain. Need dependencies fixed before functionality can be tested.

I've probably made too many changes to be the sole reviewer now. However, this ticket now looks complete to me and all functionality tests ok.

All the updates work.  All doctests pass and documentation builds.  However, I believe more documentation is needed to explain these code changes and why they improve the performance.

When I added more documentation I realized that with the updated `dehomogenize` function, the affine `homogenize` no longer worked in a similar way. That has now been updated.

added Dillon as reviewer

Conflicts with #15781 (illustrates why you shouldn't rebase)
