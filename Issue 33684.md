Example:
```py
v=vector([1.6,2.1])
round(v)
```
raises:
`TypeError: type sage.modules.free_module_element.FreeModuleElement_generic_dense doesn't define __round__ method`
Same problem occurs with a matrix of floats.

As far as I can tell, there is no method on vectors to round them. By comparison, numpy has a method for this:
```py
v = numpy.asarray([1.6,2.1])
v.round() # ==> array([1., 2.])
```
