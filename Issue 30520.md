`fedora-33-standard`, https://github.com/sagemath/sage/runs/1235092189

configure finds system `flint` but not system `arb` (headers are installed in `/usr/include/arb/`). Then compiling arb spkg results in: 

```
  [arb-2.16.0.p0]   /sage/local/var/tmp/sage/build/arb-2.16.0.p0/src/fmpr.h:25:10: fatal error: flint/config.h: No such file or directory
  [arb-2.16.0.p0]      25 | #include "flint/config.h"
  [arb-2.16.0.p0]         |          ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  [arb-2.16.0.p0]   compilation terminated.
