I am going to referee this on sage.math:

1. Extract a copy of Sage-5.0.beta7:

```
wstein@sage:/tmp/wstein$ tar xf /home/release/sage-5.0.beta7/sage-5.0.beta7-sage.math.washington.edu-x86_64-Linux.tar.gz
wstein@sage:/tmp/wstein$ mv sage-5.0.beta7-sage.math.washington.edu-x86_64-Linux sage-5.0.beta7
wstein@sage:/tmp/wstein/sage-5.0.beta7$ ./sage -br
...

```


2. Clone kini's repo (this takes about 40 seconds), build the code (over an hour CPU time), and try it out:

```
wstein@sage:/tmp/wstein/sage-5.0.beta7$ cd devel/
wstein@sage:/tmp/wstein/sage-5.0.beta7/devel$ git clone git@github.com:kini/sagelib.git sage-git
wstein@sage:/tmp/wstein/sage-5.0.beta7/devel$ rm sage; ln -s sage-git sage; cd sage-git
wstein@sage:/tmp/wstein/sage-5.0.beta7/devel/sage-git$ git checkout origin/fix-magma_free
wstein@sage:/tmp/wstein/sage-5.0.beta7/devel/sage-git$ ../../sage -br
...
sage: magma_free('2+3')
5
```


3. Once you are logged into a github account, make some remarks on the code by browsing and make some annotations.  First go to  https://github.com/kini/sagelib/compare/master...fix-magma_free  then click on the commit id.  In this example, my annotation will appear here: https://github.com/kini/sagelib/commit/691d5f194d87992591307d28cd3584b11c81121d


4. Share our changes.   Login to your github account and *FORK* the sagemath/sagelib repo here https://github.com/sagemath/sagelib by clicking on the big "fork" button. Then:


```
wstein@sage:/tmp/wstein/sage-5.0.beta7/devel/sage-git$ git checkout -b trac_12685
M       sage/interfaces/magma_free.py
Switched to a new branch 'trac_12685'
wstein@sage:/tmp/wstein/sage-5.0.beta7/devel/sage-git$ git commit -av
wstein@sage:/tmp/wstein/sage-5.0.beta7/devel/sage-git$ git push git@github.com:williamstein/sagelib trac_12685
```


Now my code is at: https://github.com/williamstein/sagelib/commits/trac_12685

And the new (combined) fix is: https://github.com/williamstein/sagelib/compare/a64feb...trac_12685
