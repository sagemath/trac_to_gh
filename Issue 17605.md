Why did you remove the doctest in `register_unpickle_override`?

Because that's a doctest for `unpickle_global` which somehow got copied into `register_unpickle_override`.

Hi Jeroen,

a naive question: Isn't that what the `debug` parameter in `unpickle_all()` is for?

Yes, except that
1. `debug` is not on by default in the doctest.

2. `debug` _returns_ a list of tracebacks that you manually have to format using the `traceback` module.

My solution is way more user friendly (and `debug` is still supported if you want that).

Fair enough - seems to be useful information to have.
