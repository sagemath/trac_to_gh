# Issue 20503: Drop return type from single-underscore arithmetic methods

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Replace

```
cpdef ModuleElement _add_(left, ModuleElement right)
```

by

```
cpdef _add_(left, ModuleElement right)
```

and similar. The return type serves absolutely no purpose.

Sounds convincing, though I would have preferred someone with stronger Cython-fu than me to review the ticket `:-)`. This does make a few generated C files a couple hundred lines smaller, but I didn't notice any significant performance change (either way).

I'm not surprised. The overhead of these checks should be small compared to the actual operation.

Thanks for the review of this and related tickets.
