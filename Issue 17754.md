sage: C = cartesian_product([ZZ, ZZ])                                                                                                                                     
sage: C
The cartesian product of (Integer Ring, Integer Ring)
sage: c = C.an_element()
sage: c
(1, 1)
sage: hasattr(c, '_sub_')
False
sage: c - c
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
RuntimeError                              Traceback (most recent call last)
...
RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded in __instancecheck__
```


implementing a ``_sub_`` method fixes the problem (such a method will be implemented for Cartesian products on a separate ticket).
