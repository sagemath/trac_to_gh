CC:  skropf

Keywords: RIF

Python's `min` and `max` are not suitable for `RealIntervalFieldElement`, as those are not linearly ordered.

This ticket implements replacement functions (also allowing more than two arguments, in contrast to the corresponding methods of `RealIntervalFieldElement`).

I think it would be more useful to have these as methods on `RIF` elements.

My reasoning for having it as a function as opposed to methods on RIF elements where:
1. There are methods `.min` and `.max` performing the operation for the minimum and maximum of two elements
2. I think that the functions as proposed here are easier to use, e.g., the infinity norm of a vector of real intervals could simply be written as `max_RIF(abs(r) for r in v)`.
Therefore, I felt that having those as functions in the module `real_mpfi` (and not importing those in the global name space) is appropriate.

Replying to [comment:3 jdemeyer]:
> I think it would be more useful to have these as methods on `RIF` elements.

I now rewrote the original methods of `RealIntervalField` to achieve what I intended with the functions.
