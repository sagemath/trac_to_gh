As discussed on sage-devel [1], the two function `Graph.to_partition` and `Poset.to_graph` do not have a very meaningful name.

As `Poset.to_graph` can be obtained from the clearer alternatives `Graph(Poset.hasse_diagram())` or `Poset.hasse_diagram().to_undirected()` it is not a problem to remove it. On the other hand, the discussion on sage-devel seemed to indicate that `Graph.to_partition` should be renamed rather than removed.

Also, as it appeared that people were more interested in the size of connected components than in the actual `Partition` object, the new function will only return a list of integers.

Hi Travis,

It was emphasized in the discussion on sage-devel that `to_graph` is ambiguous. What about `coverings_digraph` (or `to_coverings_digraph`) as an alias for `hasse_diagram` as it was proposed by Jori ?

Also it is incorrect to say that there is a "natural" conversion to graph: there is none, because there are many ways to obtain a graph/digraph. None is canonical.

Furthermore, we want to remove `to_graph` because properly named methods already exist:


```
sage: p = Poset()
sage: p.incomparability_graph()
Incomparability graph on 0 vertices
sage: p.hasse_diagram()
Digraph on 0 vertices
```


Why would we keep a misnamed function when we already have two which do the job right ?

We can already see that a Poset can be converted into a graph from the list of Poset methods. And a non-expert user who would miss `.hasse_diagram` (because it does not contain the word 'graph') will not miss `incomparability_graph`.

With all this, I am sorry that I do not understand why you would want to keep this `to_graph` function.

Hello,

Sorry, but I still do not understand why you believe that this function can be useful to anyone. If it is only to advertise that Posets can be turned into graphs, isn't `.incomparability_graph` already doing the job ?

The only new name I can think of is `.undirected_hasse_diagram`, but with `.hasse_diagram()` around we hardly need it.

It is a different graph than (in)comparability graph, but the `to_graph` is a natural construction.

Why? Because it's a one-line function? Then we should get rid of more one-line functions too. Just because you don't see the use, doesn't mean there isn't one.

> Again, the function is documented (and we have interactive documentation). It's not hurting anyone, so there's no problem; just leave it be.

I do believe that it does harm by being there. It is not a function that should ever be used in Sage or by anyone else, as other ways exist to get the same result and because its name is unclear: we could very well decide to make it return a different graph later, the function would still be correct as ".to_graph()" would still turn the Poset into "a graph". I think that knowledgeable people here (like Dima) call that 'semantics'.

While I understand that you want users to easily find out that there exists a way to get a graph from a `Poset` by looking at the list of methods, I also believe that ".incomparability_graph" does the job and that users will find it. Those who know what they are looking for will find `.hasse_diagram` quickly enough.

Somehow, I think that it all boils down to not say "the integer" but "an integer" when "the integer" is not uniquely determined. It would be nice if Sage had this level of strictness unless it really goes in the way of readability.

Would you be willing, despite everything, to let us procede with the removal of this function ? The considerations above matter to me, and also to some extent to the other persons who concurred on the sage-devel thread.

Thanks,

Nathann

Then rename the method. Here's a possibility `cover_relations_graph`.

`incomparability_graph` does not do the same thing. The `to_graph` only returns a graph by the cover relations, and it's a bad assumption that typical users will know what to do because they have not been raising hell over posets and graphs in Sage.

In short, no. I strongly believe in not removing functionality, and since you think something needs to change, then you can change the name.
