I will give it a spin when I have a bit of time later today. I would have expected the dependency to be in the other direction :)

OK, it is currently difficult to realise what the branch does since the viewer in the trac ticket header doesn't show that `matrix.pxd` is restored. Only by comparing the two branch and paying attention to the individual commits, you can see that something is happening to that file.

But it does what it is supposed to do: it compiles.
