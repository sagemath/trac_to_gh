When Sage's MixedIntegerLinearProgram class is used for solving an LP, one frequently needs to access further information about the current basis (often, the optimal basis after solving the LP), not just the numerical values of the solution; in particular, the combinatorial information: which variables are basic, nonbasic at-lower, nonbasic at-upper.

#18685 adds the necessary backend functions for the GLPK backend. This kind of information is available in every solver.

The Sage interface should, of course, be designed to work consistently across all solvers. There are some subtleties here -- not all solvers mean the same thing with "at-lower" for cases such as ranged constraints. Best to look at a source that has already sorted it all out: In the COIN open solver interface, [https://projects.coin-or.org/Osi/browser/trunk/Osi/src?order=name](https://projects.coin-or.org/Osi/browser/trunk/Osi/src?order=name) the function is called [getBasisStatus](https://projects.coin-or.org/Osi/browser/trunk/Osi/src/Osi/OsiSolverInterface.hpp#L1811)

And then there's setBasisStatus, of course. One needs this function if one wants to implement LP-based branch and bound with warmstarting.

There are other important basis-related functions: [getBInvARow](https://projects.coin-or.org/Osi/browser/trunk/Osi/src/Osi/OsiSolverInterface.hpp#L1860), getBInvRow, getBInvACol, getBInvCol -- but that's for another ticket.

Setting new milestone based on a cursory review of ticket status, priority, and last modification date.
