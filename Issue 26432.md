# Issue 26432: Error when factoring constant p-adic polynomials

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/26669

Original creator: pbruin

Original creation time: 2018-11-09 14:43:41

In SageMath 8.5.beta2:

```
sage: R.<x> = Qp(5)[]
sage: R(2).factor()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
PrecisionError: p-adic factorization not well-defined since the discriminant is zero up to the requestion p-adic precision
```

The discriminant is not useful for constant polynomials; we should just return a trivial factorisation.

This makes sense to me!
