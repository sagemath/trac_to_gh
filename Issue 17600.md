# Issue 17600: Remove redundancies from matrix_modn_dense.pyx

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2015-02-23 11:23:05

Various methods of `Matrix_modn_dense` simply class the base method of `Matrix_dense`. By inheritance, there is no point in doing that.

Do we even need the `determinant` method in the first place? Why not rely on inheritance?

Instead of

```
        if not (isinstance(b, Matrix_modn_dense_float) or
                isinstance(b, Matrix_modn_dense_double)):
```

you might have used

```
        if not isinstance(b, (Matrix_modn_dense_float, Matrix_modn_dense_double)):
```

which is handled in the exact same way by cython.

I will try to use the nice unpickle_override for #17824.

Overlaps with #10734.

What is this transition "needs work -> closed"!?

On the other hand, I don't understand why the mere _existence_ of ticket #10734 would be a reason for needs_work.

Obviously, I just didn't think of that. It doesn't really matter anyway...

Because there is a large amount of work on ticket #10734 that uses `matrix_modn_dense`. Before throwing away this work, it would have been nice to wait for the current status of this work. I am pretty sure that everything can be achieved with the LinBox classes anyway.

But _with_ or _without_ #17837, `matrix_modn_dense` is deprecated and no longer used. So if #10734 really uses `Matrix_modn_dense`, it should be changed anyway.
