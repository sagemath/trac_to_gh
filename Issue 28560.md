I've cleaned up a number of 32-bit test failures in #28795 but the following remain. I would appreciate it if one of the combinat people could have a look and fix those: 

```
sage -t --long src/sage/combinat/partition_algebra.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long src/sage/combinat/subset.py  # 3 doctests failed
sage -t --long --warn-long 129.7 src/sage/matroids/linear_matroid.pyx  # 1 doctest failed
```

I am afraid that the concept of "combinat people" no longer makes much sense. Most people formerly involved have vanished away since a long time.

The first two ones could just be tagged #random, for the moment.
