Another construction from the paper used in #16662. It is recursive as always, and the find function is, this time, very easy to write `:-)`

Unfortunately there is only one updated value in the MOLS with v<600. The second is .... 600 `:-P`

Hello Nathann,

Few modifs at `u/vdelecroix/16665`

You prefer `K.primitive_element` instead of `K.multiplicative_generator`? I used to use the former... (not very important)

Checking that `n` is a prime power and then calling `FiniteField(n)` is redundant (not very important).

Don't you prefer `raise AssertionError(msg)` instead of `assert False,msg`?

How do you know that the following is satisfied

```
    # All blocks of PG should intersect 'AG_2_3' on !=2 AG_2_3.
    assert all(len(AG_2_3.intersection(B)) != 2 for B in PG)
```

I prefer the second, because it is clearer for me. But it's not my field, if I may say.

I do.

> {{{

That's what the paper claims, and the reason why 'points' is defined as it is.

Sorry: I prefer `multiplicative_generator` and you did use `primitive_element` (in `orthogonal_arrays.py` at line 1359 and `orthogonal_arrays_recursive.py` at line 1175). We seem to agree on using `multiplicative_generator`.

But you wrote `assert False,msg` at line 1177 in `orthogonal_arrays_recursive.py`

I think I saw Volker use it somewhere, and I had not thought of it. Or maybe this "False" was something else before, I don't know.
