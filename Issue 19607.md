I'm unable to build libfplll, and it looks like it is unlinked with mpfr:

I would say that `FPLLL_WITH_LONG_DOUBLE` isn't set on Cygwin.
Indeed, the definition is guarded by `not __CYGWIN__` in `src/defs.h`.

What is strange is that the few places where `long double` specialization is to be used seem well guarded by the same `FPLLL_WITH_LONG_DOUBLE`.

Not sure why `g++` wants to create symbols for that specialization.
