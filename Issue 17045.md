Started reviewing. Done through degenerate_fibers(). Will continue later.

From docbuild:

- top of file todo block not formatted correctly

- degenerate_fibers() - `` `` instead of ` `

- is_degenerate() - # lines

- is_isomorphic() - other -> right

- lambda_plus() - examples not formatted correctly

- sigmax() - P2 x 'P2 should not have '

- orbit_phi(), orbit_psi() - input not formatted correctly


From code:

- WehlerK3Surface: check that `polys` is a list or tuple


- randomWehlerK3:
  - replace `getmon` with `xmrange([3,3])`
  - Why can we choose L to be the diagonal bilinear polynomial

WehlerK3Surface_ring:

- init():
  - get rid of ZZ(2),ZZ(2) - need to change ProductProjectiveSpace_init
  - assert all(x.parent() is ZZ for x in N) to N=[Integer(x) for x in N]
  - move TypeError check line 142 to line 135

- _morphism(): delete since it just inherits from parent

- change_ring() check not needed

- Sxa: condense the 4 lines

        AS = self.ambient_space()
        ASC = AS.coordinate_ring()
        PSY = AS[1];
        PSYC = PSY.coordinate_ring()

to 

PSY = self.ambient_space()[1]

- Lx*, Qx*, Sx* - need to check that a is a point in P^2

- Ramification_poly():
  - need to wrap return
  - need to put in definition in documentation

- is_degenerate(): delete comments line 675-677

- degenerate_fibers():
  - line 772-794: should use `rational_points` on subschemes from ticket 18008
  - line 803-825: should use `rational_points` on subschemes from ticket 18008

- degenerate_primes(): document the algorithm
  - rename: `badPrimes`
  - todo - over number fields

Here is the last bit, reviewing the degenerate fiber morphisms:

sigamX:
- 1034-35, 1047-48, 1061-62: are all exactly the same, so can be before the ifs

- 1036, 1037 - switch order so that t = w1-t1 (and in the other 2 places)

- put the T after the ifs since they are all the same

- 1078: use .divides

- 1076-1088: needs some comments

- 1116 use divides

- The whole degenerate fiber computation is badly in need of comments/explanation

all the same comments for sigmaY

```

There are a couple issues from the above lists that were not fixed and there are a few more things I found:

- is_isomorphic() - other -> right 
- sigmax() - P2 x 'P2 should not have '
- Lx*, Qx*, Sx* - need to check that a is a point in P2 
  - it would be better to check that it is the 'correct' projective space, self.ambient_space()[*]
- Ramification_poly() definition: yes that is the formula for it, but what is it?
- degenerate_primes:  Fix the formatting for the default value. (True default)  -> Default: True
  - check for other instances in the file
- some comments in lambda_plus, lambda_minus wouldn't hurt
- trailing white space in fiber()
- nth_iterate_phi, nth_iterate_psi
  - p -> P
  - n an integer (not a positive integer)
- is_symmetric_orbit: you don't just want a list of points, you want a periodic cycle...
- normalize parameter for phi, psi, sigmaX, sigmaY, orbit_phi, orbit_psi, nth_iterate_phi, nth_iterate_psi
  - use self.normalize_coordinates() to normalize (inherited from projective product)
  - when these functions are called and the base_ring is a field it should normalize in the same way init does (make the last nonzero coordinate 1)


```
PP.<x0,x1,x2,y0,y1,y2> = ProductProjectiveSpaces([2,2],GF(3))
L = x0*y0 + x1*y1 - x2*y2
Q = x0*x1*y1^2 + x2^2*y0*y2
W = WehlerK3Surface([L,Q])
H=End(W)
f=H([x0,x1,x2,y0,y1,y2])
```


- the _morphism() function is not needed since it will inherit it from its ambient space (projective product)

- The coordinates of the points need to be coerced into the base_ring

```
PP.<x0,x1,x2,y0,y1,y2> = ProductProjectiveSpaces([2,2],GF(3))
L = x0*y0 + x1*y1 - x2*y2
Q = x0*x1*y1^2 + x2^2*y0*y2
W = WehlerK3Surface([L,Q])
P=W.point([0,2,0,2,0,0],False);P
P.normalize_coordinates();P
```

This may actually be an issue from projective products.

- I have not yet run the docbuild, but I noticed a number of typos in the documentation, you should probably take a close look at the html version to catch those.

Here is what I see in the documentation:

ramification poly

* cite call silverman
* output: polynomial in coordinate ring of ambient space

canonical height

* change '-' to 'minus'

canonical height minus

* change '+' to 'minus'
* 'Use v=0 for the archimedean place' should be deleted
* add (local heights) after 'lambda minus heights'

canonical height plus

* - 'Use v=0 for the archimedean place' should be deleted
* add (local heights) after 'lambda plus heights'

degenerate fibers

* Remove the extra 'in' in 'The output is a list of lists where in the elements of lists are points in the appropriate projective space.'

degenerate primes

* only over ZZ or QQ

is_symmetric_oribt

* fix 'ps`'

lambda minus

* change '-' to 'minus'

lambda plus

* change '+' to 'plus'

nth_iterate_phi

* write out 'phi'
* quotes for `psi' is fine, but you should be consistent throughout the

documentation. This is thefirst place you've done that.

nth_iterate_phi

* write out 'psi'

orbit_phi

* Function is defined in [CaSi]

phi

* output: a point on self

psi

* output: a point on self

sigmaX

* !``self!`` - you have single quotes
* change 'while we have two points in the fiber' to 'while we can split the fiber into pairs of points'

* output: a point on self

sigmaY

* !``self!`` - you have single quotes
* change 'while we have two points in the fiber' to 'while we can split the fiber into pairs of points'

* output: a point on self

you are inconsistent with the hyphenation of bilinear and biquadratic. I think it

should not be hyphenated.

For functionality

fiber:

* add a component = 0 example
* shouldn't the last 3 cases have an else for component == 1?
