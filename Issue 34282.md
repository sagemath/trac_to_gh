# Issue 34282: Fix + extend msolve interface

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/34519

Original creator: mmezzarobba

Original creation time: 2022-09-11 17:31:30

Since #33734, msolve developers have changed (stabilized?) the output format and documented the computation of varieties over finite fields and Gröbner bases.

I don't think #31664 should be a dependency: the interface works as soon as `msolve` is available in `$PATH`, so the two tickets are independent.

I've tested it with the msolve built using #31664, working well.
Thanks a lot for your work!

Actually it looks like some `# optional - msolve` tags need to be added - https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/actions/runs/3062355276/jobs/4943236385

Thank you. I thought I had tested it without msolve as well, but apparently not with the last commit...

Wait a minute, the `msolve` module has a little bit of doc too, I should add it to the reference manual.

There's still a doctest failure: 

```
sage -t --random-seed=332544742493111522594152009856868565361 sage/misc/cachefunc.pyx  # 1 doctest failed
```

That doctest retrieves one of the changed functions' docstrings and needs to be updated
