Looks okay to me. I guess the files in `src/sage/libs/lrcalc` demonstrate that this is a build-time dependency, not just a run-time one?

It is indeed a build dependency, look at `src/module_list.py` which has

```
if is_package_installed('lrcalc'):
    ext_modules.append(
        Extension('sage.libs.lrcalc.lrcalc',
                  sources = ["sage/libs/lrcalc/lrcalc.pyx"],
                  include_dirs = [SAGE_INC + '/lrcalc/'],
                  libraries = ["lrcalc"],
                  depends = [SAGE_INC + "/lrcalc/symfcn.h"]), # should include all .h
        )
```
