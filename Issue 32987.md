On 9.5.rc3:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve(GF(257^2), [5,5])
sage: E.weierstrass_p(prec=50, algorithm='fast')
z^-2 + 256*z^2 + 36*z^4 + 86*z^6 + 107*z^8 + 126*z^10 + 119*z^12 + 4*z^14 + 54*z^16 + 216*z^18 + 212*z^20 + 185*z^22 + 100*z^24 + 85*z^26 + 3*z^28 + 10*z^30 + 53*z^32 + 26*z^34 + 163*z^36 + 144*z^38 + 176*z^40 + 121*z^42 + 163*z^44 + 241*z^46 + 82*z^48 + O(z^50)
