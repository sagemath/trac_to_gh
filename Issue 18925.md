We should provide a detailed interface for symbolic relations:
 * `bool(rel)` equivalent to `(not)(LHS-RHS).is_trivial_zero()` for ==,!= ; and an exception with maybe hint to the following for <,>,<=,>=
 * `satisfiable(rel)` returning `(Yes,example)/No/Undecidable/NotImplemented`
 * `truth(rel, (x,S1), (y,S2)...)` equivalent to `satisfiable(rel)` with quantifiers: for all `x,y...` in `S1,S2,...`
 * `solve(rel)` in case of `satisfiable=Yes` returning the full solution set
 * `prove(rel)` showing more or less steps of simplification (which is out of reach for the moment)

Tickets:
 * #19040: to take satisfiability/truth functionality out of `ex.__nonzero__` into resp. member functions
