I think we should have `CombinatorialFreeModule` take a `range` as input (well, really it means `FiniteEnumeratedSet` should), so I think we should not wrap the corresponding `range`'s in `list`'s.

ok, here is a try. The problem is that the branch triggers a large recompilation..

It's due to the change in `element.pxd`.

Thanks for fixing the `FiniteEnumeratedSet`. Could you also revert the change to `categories/modules_with_basis.py`? Once that it done, you can set a positive review on my behalf.

I thought I did that already ?

oh, the remaining one should stay, because an iterator would be emptied by the first call.

Okay. Then LGTM.

This is getting frustating... this should not be done for Cython files.
