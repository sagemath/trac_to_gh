The following produces invalid Latex output (sage-9.2, misc seems not changed since):

```
sage: A.<psi> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: B.<x> = FreeAlgebra(A)
sage: (psi*x)._latex_()
'\\psix'
sage: repr_lincomb([(x, psi)], is_latex=True)
'\\psix'
```

The fix is easy, but doctests in some other files need to be updated, so the branch needs additional work before being set to "needs review".
