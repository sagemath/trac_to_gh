The code in `optional_extension` was mostly unused and is removed in this ticket (and similarly `extension.skip_build` was nowhere else set). 
The only still used method was `is_package_installed_and_updated` which is moved to `sage.misc.package` (where also a bit of typing info is added).

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31013

I wouldn't say it's conflicting, just results in easy-to-resolve merge conflicts.
