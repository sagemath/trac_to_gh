For example:
On page http://sagenb.com/doc_browser?/const/?node72.html, reference to sage/modular/dims.py would be a hyper link to the actual code.
On page http://sagenb.com/doc_browser?/prog/?node15.html, reference to SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/sage/graphs/graph.py would be a hyper link to the actual code.
