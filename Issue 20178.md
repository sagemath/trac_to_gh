This is a follow-up on #20301.
#20296 provides a way to select a suitable solver by its `base_ring`.

`Polyhedron.to_linear_program` should do that. 

Note, for exact polyhedra, this will change the behavior of `to_linear_program` from inexact computation to exact computation, which will be much slower. To restore the old behavior, the user would need to pass an explicit `base_ring=RDF` argument to `to_linear_program`.
