After applying the patch I get an import error for sage.modular.periods.periods in the file sage/modular/modsym/space.py
I think this is simply a problem with a missing \_\_init\_\_.py file in the periods/ directory

Also, I think that the formula for the exponential integral in the cited book  (Lemma 10.4) has the wrong sign (easy to check in the case alpha=i, n=1 and m=0). This is simple to fix by initializing sgn=-1 instead of 1.

I'm surprised the exponential integral is not efficiently implemented elsewhere already. Note, however, that you could compute this more efficiently by keeping track of the single value (sgn*alpha_pow*denom) which changes by a constant factor of -1/(alpha * t) each iteration (if this is a bottleneck). Doctests on these functions might be useful as well.

I have made a new patch, just cleaning up things a little bit.

for the bot: apply only trac_13093_period_v2.patchâ€‹
