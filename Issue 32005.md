In the description of #29024, a few problems are listed as prerequisites for accepting a system installation of Singular. Basically, they ask that we either use singular in a less crazy manner, or find a way to make our existing hacks work with a system copy of singular.

One of those issues is that the `sage/interfaces/singular.py` is using an environment variable `SINGULARPATH` to guess at the location where Singular's Info file is installed, so that it can be manually parsed.

In the interest of using Singular in a less crazy manner, I propose we add the standalone GNU "info" as a new package, and use it to read Singular's documentation from wherever it is configured to do so. This eliminates two of the problems in #29024.

Singular renders its own interactive help using "info" or one of its alternatives: https://www.singular.uni-kl.de/Manual/latest/sing_16.htm

I don't think they can give us an API without making "info" a dependency of Singular itself.

```
sage: from sage.interfaces.singular import get_docstring                        
sage: get_docstring("Preface")

The current branch oversimplifies a bit here too, checking only that the parent node is "Functions", but you can pass a series of (sub)nodes to `info` to ensure that you're navigating to where you think you are.

It looks like we also install info files for maxima and giac. So not only would having "info" installed allow you to run the interactive help in a `singular_console()`, but it may help somebody read the maxima and giac docs, too.

There is no problem with making `info` a standard package.

One final point for GNU Info:

The Singular manual is now 11MB in singular-4.2.1. The existing implementation loads the entire thing (not just the function documentation, as I've shown) into a global variable that lives forever. This permanently wastes roughly the same amount of memory:


```
sage: from sage.interfaces.singular import generate_docstring_dictionary        
sage: get_memory_usage()                                                        
6467.30859375
sage: generate_docstring_dictionary()                                           
sage: get_memory_usage()                                                        
6479.34765625
```


And that will get worse as the Singular manual grows.

> By the way, this ticket does not solve the original problem at all. If we want to use system Singular on a system that does not have `info`, then the installed `info` from the proposed SPKG does not have information regarding the info file location. So you are only shifting the problem of locating the info file from runtime to build time; *and* you are introducing a new non-Python dependency for the sagelib runtime.

While it's possible to put the info files *anywhere*, we can stick a colon on the end of `$INFOPATH` to have the SPKG try the default list as fallbacks: https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/texinfo.git/tree/info/filesys.h#n70

If we manage to find a system that both doesn't have GNU Info and yet still goes out of its way to install info files in a crazy location... then I guess at that point we could use DEPCHECK to ensure that the Singular SPKG gets built on that system.

We could always make GNU Info an optional package, and take the same approach to


```
sage: singular.<function>?
```


that we take to


```
sage: singular_console()
> help <function>;
```


That is, it doesn't work unless you have Info installed. The docstring for the sage object would suggest the optional package if it's not available.

This is only a solution if you insist on keeping our lame python implementation and all of the problems it comes with. It'll get the job done, but I won't be the one to do it.

It's now completely optional. When "info" is not installed, you'll be prodded to install it:


```
sage: singular.align?                                                           
Signature:   singular.align(*args, **kwds)
Type:        SingularFunction
String form: align
File:        ~/src/sage.git/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/sage/interfaces/singular.py
Docstring:  
This function is an automatically generated pexpect wrapper around the
Singular function 'align'.

EXAMPLES:

   sage: groebner = singular.groebner
   sage: P.<x, y> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
   sage: I = P.ideal(x^2-y, y+x)
   sage: groebner(singular(I))
   x+y,
   y^2-y

The relevant Singular documentation will be shown here if you install
GNU Texinfo, the stand-alone GNU Info program, or the SageMath "info"
SPKG.
