This works:

```
sage: gap.load_package('grape')
sage: gap.eval('GG:=JohnsonGraph(5,2);');
sage: gap.eval('AutGroupGraph(GG);')
'Group([ (3,4)(6,7)(8,9), (2,3)(5,6)(9,10), (2,5)(3,6)(4,7), (1,2)(6,8)(7,9) ])'
```

whereas

```
sage: libgap.eval('GG:=JohnsonGraph(5,2);');
sage: libgap.LoadPackage("grape")
true
sage: libgap.eval('GG:=JohnsonGraph(5,2);');
sage: libgap.eval('AutGroupGraph(GG);')
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

As [reported](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-support/Pix8mSwxYEE/vCUbhT58AAAJ) on sage-devel.

I suspect it's a simple issue of passing around the correct path.

Is it due to "blacklisting" of /tmp, or something else?
