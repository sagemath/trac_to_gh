The compiler/linker check from #15580 prevents documentation build on mark/skynet: http://build.sagemath.org/sage/builders/%20%20slow%20Skynet%20mark%20%28SunOS%205.10-32%29%20full/builds/0/steps/compile_2/logs/stdio

You don't need gcc to build the docs, so either remove the check or source sage-env to set up the paths that it finds our own gcc.

Did #15580 really change something? If it did, I don't understand why.

And why documentation? This surely has nothing to do with documentation.

I'm not saying there is not a problem here, just trying to understand it.

The error occurs during "make doc-html-mathjax" (see log), thats why I said that its during documentation. I'm not 100% sure that its the fault of #15580, but it seems likely. We did change where sage-env is sourced in e03f296685f986f89e1e12974f4c5ead9a9ff440, thats the likely culprit.
