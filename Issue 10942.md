Robert, did you even test this?   It seems to fail doctests all over the place.  E.g.,

```
sage -t  devel/sage/sage/calculus/riemann.pyx

Exception raised:

ImportError: No module named riemann

It seems like using LazyImport in any nontrivial way always results in serious breakage that is revealed by doctests.  I hit this numerous times myself.  Hmmm.
