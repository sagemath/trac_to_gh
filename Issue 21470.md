`sage-env` is used by both Sage-the-distribution while building packages,
and by Sage at runtime.

It should be split into two separate scripts.
- `sage-build-env` should go into `build/bin` and not be installed.
- `sage-env` should be installed by `src/setup.py` (thus very late in the build process), rather than by `build/make/Makefile`. 

(`sage-env` will be very short and at some point hopefully disappear, if we want sagelib to become a standalone Python library - #21507)

This is a step towards the cleaning of `src/bin` as described in #21569, #21570, #21559.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21707

I agree.

Consider a slight alternative: Rewrite sage-env as a Python script.  This would give it much more flexibility and probably more legibility, including some command-line options for different environments (`--build`, especially).

The output would of course be the shell commands to actually set the variables. So rather than `source sage-env` one would `eval $(sage-env)`.  My one concern is that it would be slower, but ideally it's something that shouldn't happen frequently anyways, but rather only when not already in sage-env.

 I have thought about it often. Of course that really means that you'll have to removing all the build time stuff. But in sage-on-gentoo where I ship a very simplified sage-env (in /etc as well) they are virtually doing the same thing, one in shell, the other in python.

More likely parts of it would be static, and other parts could be generated, but yes, what I meant above in terms of rewriting `sage-env` in Python was that it would not (by default) involve environment variables at all.

But it's still useful for interacting with other tools, especially for build purposes, as well as dropping into `./sage -sh` to be able to set environment variables, which is why I suggest a mode to output a list of variables that can be read from the shell.

As-is this is going to conflict with tickets like #27825 that are adding still more environment variables needed at build-time to sage-env-config.

For the sake of a bit more terseness I wonder if we could call it just `sage-env-build.in` and `sage-env-build`.  The only reason for the `-config` in the other one is to distinguish it from plain `sage-env`.

Now that I look I'm not even entirely sure we need to separate `sage-env-config` from `sage-env`.

I think we could probably have a `sage-env.in` produce `sage-env` and get rid of the separate `sage-env-config` entirely, though it's possible there's some subtlety to that that I'm missing.

The run-time environment variables of sage could as well be configured by a Python module `src/sage/env_config.py` - see #29022.

As an extension of this, there could be `sage --buildsh SPKG`, which would set up the environment in which `spkg-install` runs. This could be useful for testing new versions of packages.

Not sure if this is the right place, but I would suggest to use the refactoring process to also convert the environment variables to configuration files. 

The idea would be to have a `toml` file (or `yaml` or whatever you prefer) in some predefined folder (say `src` for the start). This file could be generated e.g by the `configure` script. This config file is then parsed and wrapped by a python class (natural candidate would be the current `sage_conf.py`). The python class also provides reasonable default values in case the config file doesn't exist. 

This has several advantages in my opinion:
- More transparent, as one sees on one glance which variables influence sage.
- Easily editable by the user/developer.
- Local (e.g. think about multiple virtual environments with different configs).
- Type-safe, i.e, it is ensured when parsing the toml file that the types of the config variables is correct.
- Easier for downstream package managers, since they only need to provide a proper config file.
- (Higher security as one cannot inject arbitrary python code, which would be the case if `sage_conf.py` should be edited.)

What do you think?

`sage_conf` defines an interface already - and the plan is indeed to get rid of dependencies on environment variables using this interface.

How `sage_conf` obtains the configuration is orthogonal to the defined interface.

I am not interested in defining configuration files at the moment.  There is just too much potential on wasting energy on discussions regarding the "best" config file format.

From the discussion in #32904 regarding `sage_conf` at build time (with pip's build isolation) vs. runtime:
- pip specifies "ignore-installed" while constructing the build environment and thus will build sage-conf twice. https://github.com/pypa/pip/blob/main/src/pip/_internal/build_env.py#L221
- The PyPI version `sage_conf` (from #29039) keys the `SAGE_ROOT`/`SAGE_LOCAL` that it creates in `~/.sage` to the version of `sage_conf`
- So if the `sage_conf` version is not completely pinned in the `sagemath-standard` build and install requirements, then different versions (and thus `SAGE_ROOT`s) may end up being used at build and install of `sagemath-standard`
