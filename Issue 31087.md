The circle S1 with polar coordinates doesn't specify an orientation at the moment. It is also not possible to call `set_orientation` with the polar chart as argument, since this throws an error that the chart doesn't cover the whole manifold.

So I guess to fix this one would need to introduce a set of polar coordinates to get a bona-fide atlas.

Indeed, by default `S1` is endowed with a single chart and without any orientation:

```
sage: S1 = manifolds.Sphere(1) 
sage: S1.atlas()                                                                                    
[Chart (A, (phi,))]
sage: S1.orientation()                                                                              
[]
```

I think this is bad; the minimal atlas shall contain enough charts to cover the entire manifold. There is the same issue with all the spheres. 
One has to invoke stereographic coordinates to get some orientation:

```
sage: S1.stereographic_coordinates()                                                                
Chart (S^1-{NP}, (y1,))
sage: S1.atlas()                                                                                    
[Chart (A, (phi,)),

This is on purpose! The orientation must cover the entire manifold, otherwise a non-orientable manifold could mistakenly seen as orientable. Take for example the Moebius strip.

Polar coordinates do *not* yield an atlas for S^1, there is a slit missing.

So, this behavior is perfectly fine.

If you want to use polar coordinates for orientation stuff, you must restrict everything to the open subset `A`, i.e. `S^n` without a slit.

Strictly speaking, it suffices to specify the orientation (i.e. a norm-one vector field) only on a dense subspace. But I guess it's probably impossible to check if a subset is dense in sage.

That's a bit the problem. With the current default atlas, S^1 is diffeomorphic to R, which of course it not correct (or in other words, what is currently returned by S1.atlas is not an atlas of S^1). I cannot say much about the implementation/performance issues, but isn't the transition map to the other polar chart not just a translation by pi?.

That's not true. The polar coordinates are defined only on `A`, which is a real subset of `S^1`. `A` is diffeomorphic to `R`, `S^1` is still not.

That's only a counterexample to the (wrong) statement that a manifold is orientable iff if it is orientable on dense subset. However, to specify an orientation it is enough to give a unit-norm vector field on a dense subset (such that the vector field extends continuously to the whole manifold).

With the current default atlas, S<sup>1</sup> is diffeomorphic to R, which of course it not correct (or in other words, what is currently returned by S1.atlas is not an atlas of S<sup>1</sup>). I cannot say much about the implementation/performance issues, but isn't the transition map to the other polar chart not just a translation by pi?.

I understand that there is a performance issue for `n` large. To circumvent this, we could add an option like `complete_atlas=True`, so that if some user does not want to construct the stereographic charts and their transition maps when initializing the manifold, he/she could set this option to `False`.

For the records, 'large' already means n ≥ 4. I think, the initialization should run fast enough at least for n≤7.

The current implementation is, imho, a good compromise between performance and accuracy. Like I said, the topological data is not lost and can easily be retrieved. Besides,


```
sage: S1 = manifolds.Sphere(1, coordinates='stereographic')
```


initializes the sphere with stereographic coordinates and has therefore the same effect as your suggestion.

I don't see a need for a change here; apart from making stereographic coordinates the standard set of charts, but due to performance issues I'd not recommend it.

By the way, the intention is not to get the charts by using the atlas but rather calling `stereographic_coordinates()` etc, which then constructs the charts (and orientation!) on demand.

Travis, what do you think?
