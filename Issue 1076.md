Report it to trac. I've noticed the same problem and it really
bugs me.  In fact, just toggling the output on and off doesn't
behave correctly anymore, e.g., clicking on the left makes the output
totally disappear instead of showing a little horizontal bar.  Etc.

The same problem here on Epiphany, Debian unstable. It's kind of annyoing. :) 

But otherwise the notebook rocks.
