# Issue 14008: add optional "names" argument to absolute_ideal

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: mmanes

Original creation time: 2013-03-01 22:19:16

Assignee: davidloeffler

Keywords: absolute ideal, absolute field,

The absolute_ideal method uses 'a' as the name of the generator of the absolute_field, which may conflict with a user-chosen generator for the absolute_field (if that has already been done) or with some other variable that's in use.

This small fix adds an optional "names" argument so that a user can force agreement between the absolute_ideal and absolute_field if it was already constructed.  If no name is passed, the default 'a' is used.

Several of the functions are missing either INPUT: OUTPUT: or both.  Besides that it looks good.

You need to add some examples that use the new functionality and get tested.

However, my mind has been changed as this now does not work on ANYONE's machine.

It installed, passed doctests. 

I tested functionality on the examples provided and a few others of my own and it works as it's supposed to.
