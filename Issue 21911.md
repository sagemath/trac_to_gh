CC:  akoutsianas @mckenziewest

Keywords: S-unit equation

This is a generalization of #19887.

We would like to incorporate functions to find all solutions to some classes of linear equations in the S-units of a number field.  This builds on code by Christopher Rasmussen, Beth Malmskog, and Angelos Koutsianas, with contributions by Christelle Vincent, Alejandra Alvarado, and Mckenzie West.  Based on work by Baker, Smart, de Weger, Yu, and others.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22148

```

1) This is not a correct syntax (around True):

```
+    - ````True`` or ``False``
```

2) `..NOTE`, `INPUT:`, `OUTPUT:` and `REFERENCES:` should also be followed by a blank line, so this is wrong, for example:

```
+    ..NOTE::
+        The numerator should be as close to 1 as possible, especially as the rank of the `S`-units grows large
```

Also the next lines should then be indented if and only if the block command ends with `::`

3) `+    Example::` should rather be `EXAMPLES::`

4) `COMMENT:` is not a standard block command, use nothing or `ALGORITHM:`

5) every single function must have a non-empty `EXAMPLES::` block with useful doctests

6) comparison to None should not use `prec == None` but rather `prec is None`

7) once again, you should build the doc, and look at it, until it is completely fine !

8) This is lacking `::`

```
+    Use CRT to check the output
+
+        sage: CRT(2, 2, 18, 27)
```

as well as here:

```
+    The order of the moduli matters.
+
+        sage: len(compatible_vectors(a, 18, 12))
```
