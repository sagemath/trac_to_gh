# Issue 24801: Use sage-dist-helpers for curl and gc

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25038

Original creator: embray

Original creation time: 2018-03-27 10:13:16

Keywords: destdir curl gc

This was originally done in #24025 but later excluded to prevent that ticket from conflicting with tickets that upgraded these packages.  I don't believe there is any conflict now.
