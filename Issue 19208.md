In the documentation of `lfsr_sequence` 

http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/cryptography/sage/crypto/lfsr.html#sage.crypto.lfsr.lfsr_sequence 

it should read `n ≥ k`, not `n ≤ k`

While-we-are-at-it (i.e., I saw it in the diff) is `int(L0[i + k])/p` suppose to be division or treated as floor division and be `int(L0[i + k])//p`? Also `R(1)` -> `R.one()`.

For the division, I have no idea. Apparently the expected result is a rational. And the doctests in this file are passing on python3.

Then it makes those `int` calls a little strange. Anyways, if that is a tangent, then it is unimportant now. LGTM, thanks.
