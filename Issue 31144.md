If `G` is a digraph, the documentation of `G.graphviz_string` says the following work:


```
sage: f(x) = -1 / x
sage: g(x) = 1 / (x + 1)
sage: G = DiGraph()
sage: G.add_edges((i, f(i), f) for i in (1, 2, 1/2, 1/4))
sage: G.add_edges((i, g(i), g) for i in (1, 2, 1/2, 1/4))
sage: print(G.graphviz_string())
digraph {
  node_0  [label="-1"];
  node_1  [label="-1/2"];
  node_2  [label="1/2"];
  node_3  [label="-2"];
  node_4  [label="1/4"];
  node_5  [label="-4"];
  node_6  [label="1/3"];
  node_7  [label="2/3"];
  node_8  [label="4/5"];
  node_9  [label="1"];
  node_10  [label="2"];

  node_2 -> node_3;
  node_2 -> node_7;
  node_4 -> node_5;
  node_4 -> node_8;
  node_9 -> node_0;
  node_9 -> node_2;
  node_10 -> node_1;
  node_10 -> node_6;
}
```

Indeed, it works:

```
sage: TikzPicture.from_graph(G).pdf()
```


At the end of `G.graphviz_string` documentation, the following is suggested:


```
We now test all options:

    sage: def edge_options(data):
    ....:     u, v, label = data
    ....:     options = {"color": {f: "red", g: "blue"}[label]}
    ....:     if (u,v) == (1/2, -2): options["label"]       = "coucou"; options["label_style"] = "string"
    ....:     if (u,v) == (1/2,2/3): options["dot"]         = "x=1,y=2"
    ....:     if (u,v) == (1,   -1): options["label_style"] = "latex"
    ....:     if (u,v) == (1,  1/2): options["edge_string"] = "<-"
    ....:     if (u,v) == (1/2,  1): options["backward"]    = True
    ....:     return options
    sage: print(G.graphviz_string(edge_options=edge_options))  # random
    digraph {
    node_10  [label="1"];
    node_11  [label="2"];
    node_3  [label="-1/2"];
    node_6  [label="1/2"];
    node_7  [label="1/2"];
    node_5  [label="1/3"];
    node_8  [label="2/3"];
    node_4  [label="1/4"];
    node_1  [label="-2"];
    node_9  [label="4/5"];
    node_0  [label="-4"];
    node_2  [label="-1"];

    node_10 -> node_2 [label=" ", texlbl="$x \ { |--> }\ -\frac{1}{x}$", color = "red"];
    node_10 <- node_6 [color = "blue"];
    node_11 -> node_3 [color = "red"];
    node_11 -> node_5 [color = "blue"];
    node_7 -> node_1 [label="coucou", color = "red"];
    node_7 -> node_8 [x=1,y=2, color = "blue"];
    node_4 -> node_0 [color = "red"];
    node_4 -> node_9 [color = "blue"];
    }
```


Unfortunately, it does not work:

```
sage: TikzPicture.from_graph(G, edge_options=edge_options).pdf()
```


If we replace `'<-'` by `--`, it is not as bad, but the option is ignored:


```
We now test all options:

    sage: def edge_options(data):
    ....:     u, v, label = data
    ....:     options = {"color": {f: "red", g: "blue"}[label]}
    ....:     if (u,v) == (1/2, -2): options["label"]       = "coucou"; options["label_style"] = "string"
    ....:     if (u,v) == (1/2,2/3): options["dot"]         = "x=1,y=2"
    ....:     if (u,v) == (1,   -1): options["label_style"] = "latex"
    ....:     if (u,v) == (1,  1/2): options["edge_string"] = "--"
    ....:     if (u,v) == (1/2,  1): options["backward"]    = True
    ....:     return options
    sage: print(G.graphviz_string(edge_options=edge_options))  # random
    digraph {
    node_10  [label="1"];
    node_11  [label="2"];
    node_3  [label="-1/2"];
    node_6  [label="1/2"];
    node_7  [label="1/2"];
    node_5  [label="1/3"];
    node_8  [label="2/3"];
    node_4  [label="1/4"];
    node_1  [label="-2"];
    node_9  [label="4/5"];
    node_0  [label="-4"];
    node_2  [label="-1"];

    node_10 -> node_2 [label=" ", texlbl="$x \ { |--> }\ -\frac{1}{x}$", color = "red"];
    node_10 <- node_6 [color = "blue"];
    node_11 -> node_3 [color = "red"];
    node_11 -> node_5 [color = "blue"];
    node_7 -> node_1 [label="coucou", color = "red"];
    node_7 -> node_8 [x=1,y=2, color = "blue"];
    node_4 -> node_0 [color = "red"];
    node_4 -> node_9 [color = "blue"];
    }
```


Unfortunately, the option `'--'` is ignored:

```
sage: TikzPicture.from_graph(G, edge_options=edge_options).pdf()
```

According to the [DOT language description](http://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html), `--` is the format for an edge of a `graph` and `->` is the format for an edge of a `digraph` and nothing else.

Therefore, it is a bug in the documentation to suggest `<-` or `--` for digraph.

Moreover, according to the thread [Graphviz Dot, mix directed and undirected](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13236975/graphviz-dot-mix-directed-and-undirected) on stackoverflow, it seems that the proper way to remove the headarrow for one edge of a digraph to set `dir=none`.

Therefore, the `edge_option` should allow one to set `dir=none`.

ok.

Pour info, juste pousser une branche git n'envoie pas de mail, donc ne prévient pas les participants au ticket.

I was not paying enough attention in #31719. The result is now that the arrows are backwards rather than being an indication that the arrows should be considered as moving in the opposite direction for the layout. The key change was not adding back in this line:

```python
if edge_options['backward']:
    v,u = u,v    # <------------------------------
    dot_options.append('dir=back')
```

So implementing the deprecation message is actually giving a change in the behavior. This feature is really useful in having nicer layout for KR crystals.

The question is what to do going forward. Should we have `dir='back'` implement the old behavior or add back in the `backward` input for what will be distinct behavior?

While working on this ticket, I spent a lot of time thinking about all cases and tested all of them. To me, there was a bug in the `backward=True` code. To my opinion, the line `u,v=v,u` is changing the graph  and should not be done inside a method which just draws it. I think if the user really want to change the graph, the user should do this before drawing it.

If I well remember (it is too bad I did not copy pasted an example here), the option `backward=True` was not working at all. Because swapping u and v and setting `dir=back` was like doing nothing for showing a digraph. After this ticket, writting `dir=back` really does `dir=back` as understood by the dot language.

What happens if in #31719 you instead just removed the `backward=True` as follows?


```diff
             G = Crystals().parent_class.digraph(self, subset, index_set)
-            if have_dot2tex():
-                f = lambda u_v_label: ({"backward": u_v_label[2] == 0})
-                G.set_latex_options(edge_options=f)
             return G
```

Ok, I see. Then, it was a mistake from me. I am sorry. I think we should then add back the `backward` option.

No problem. I should have caught it when I was doing #31719. This is now #32438.
