# Issue 10934: fixes and improvements to automorphism groups of linear codes

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: rlm

Original creation time: 2011-03-25 17:46:38

Assignee: wdj

This ticket is motivated by #10994 and #11032.

The goals will be:

1. Remove automorphism_group_binary_code.

2. Fix permutation_automorphism_group as noted in #10994.

3. Make binary code structures in `partn_ref` only use minimal code words when refining.

4. Use greasing in linear binary code structures in `partn_ref`.

Once all of these goals are implemented we will also be able to delete almost all of `binary_code.pyx`, using `sage/groups/perm_gps/partn_ref` instead.

Applies fine to a 10.6.6 mac running 4.7.a1. Passes sage -testall. Code patches and docstrings in reference manual look good. 

Thanks Robert.

As a result of this ticket, we can now close #10994 and #11032. I'll leave this up the the release manager.
