This ticket is motivated by #10994 and #11032.

The goals will be:

1. Remove automorphism_group_binary_code.

2. Fix permutation_automorphism_group as noted in #10994.

3. Make binary code structures in `partn_ref` only use minimal code words when refining.

4. Use greasing in linear binary code structures in `partn_ref`.

Once all of these goals are implemented we will also be able to delete almost all of `binary_code.pyx`, using `sage/groups/perm_gps/partn_ref` instead.
