# Issue 14810: LaTeX typeseting of SR.wild should prefix $ with \

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: aginiewicz

Original creation time: 2013-08-15 08:56:39

Keywords: wildcard latex

Currently calling

```
latex(SR.wild(0))
```

results in '$0'. When using this with SageTeX, it causes issues due to special meaning of $ in TeX. I believe this call should return '\$0' instead. For now when using SageTeX I have to use something like

```
LatexExpr(latex(SR.wild(0)).replace(r'$',r'\$'))
```

I will provide patch for it later this month when I have time, unless someone does it earlier, as this should be trivial to fix (like single keystroke).

Changing keywords from "wildcard latex" to "pynac wildcard latex".

Changing priority from trivial to minor.

Right now I'm not sure if I will provide patch this month, because I wasn't aware it comes from pynac - I've never looked into pynac... yet.

I'd be happy to give this a positive review, but I think you made a typo - this ticket number is 15047, not 15048. ;-)
