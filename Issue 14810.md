Keywords: wildcard latex

Currently calling

```
latex(SR.wild(0))
```

results in '$0'. When using this with SageTeX, it causes issues due to special meaning of $ in TeX. I believe this call should return '\$0' instead. For now when using SageTeX I have to use something like

```
LatexExpr(latex(SR.wild(0)).replace(r'$',r'\$'))
```


Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15047

I will provide patch for it later this month when I have time, unless someone does it earlier, as this should be trivial to fix (like single keystroke).
