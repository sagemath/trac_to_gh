On 10.11  the errors are

    c_directives.c:739:54: error: C++ style comments are not allowed in ISO C90

Are we forcing C90 somewhere here?

Also, are there build logs for 10.12 that have the errors in them?

Also, https://github.com/cython/cython/commit/d02cc4c5d831da27cd871cbb3feaf8bea72ec0c0 should fix the C90 issues.

After applying the patches, I'm still getting failures. Log file for OS X 10.12: â€‹http://www.math.washington.edu/~palmieri/Sage/cython-0.25.2.p0-10.12.log
