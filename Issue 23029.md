# Issue 23029: Indices for Lie algebras are not always a FiniteEnumeratedSet

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23266

This causes problems based on assumptions of the PBW basis:

```
sage: gl2 = lie_algebras.gl(QQ, 2)
sage: Ugl2 = gl2.pbw_basis()
sage: prod(Ugl2.gens())  # Boom
```

Looks good to me.  Also, all tests passed and both HTML and PDF documentations build.
