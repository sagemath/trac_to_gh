There exists a new upstream version of saclib (and qepcad) that compiles on 64 bit machines at

!http://www.usna.edu/Users/cs/qepcad/INSTALL/IQ.html

Chris Brown says "Version 1.54 adds portability to 64-bit systems.  Right now, I 	can only verify that it compiles and runs properly on 64-bit 	Ubuntu ... hopefully it's also OK on other 64-bit linux distros." I have built it outside of sage on 64 bit and 32 bit Debian without major difficulty.

Also, I think there could be some improvements to the QEPCAD interface, but it would probably be better for me to open separate tickets and base them on the updated spkg.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/10224

Works fine for me. (Ubuntu 10.10)

But did you make a Mercurial update of your changes?
If I build your package I get:

Created package qepcad-1.54.p0.spkg.

    NAME: qepcad
 VERSION: 1.54.p0
    SIZE: 4.0M
 HG REPO: Unchecked in changes
SPKG.txt: Good

Btw: Version 1.55 is out, perhaps try to use the new source.

Regards,
Stefan

Could you try again with the new branch and the `sage-qepcad` command instead of `qepcad` ?

Could you also try from Sage if you get the following behaviour:


```
sage: var('a,b,c,d,x,y,z')
(a, b, c, d, x, y, z)
sage: qf = qepcad_formula
sage: ellipse = 3*x^2 + 2*x*y + y^2 - x + y - 7
sage: F = qf.exists(y, ellipse == 0); F
(E y)[3 x^2 + 2 x y + y^2 - x + y - 7 = 0]
sage: qepcad(F)
8 x^2 - 8 x - 29 <= 0
```

Helloooooooooooo,

Just leaving a note here that if you create a new-style package that replaces an old-style package (it seems to be the case for qepcad?) then somebody should ask Harald to remove the old-style package from the "optional/" folder on the mirrors, and move it to the "archive/" folder instead.

Otherwise we will be having consistency problems at some point.

Thanks,

I propose to add a "not tested" flag to those examples in order not to pollute the tutorial, and then add tests that transforms the string to a set of substrings so that we can test equality. Does it makes sense ?

So, be both have meaningful user-friendly examples and the doctest are still executed and partially checked. Hence, if i replace `# not tested` with `# random` in the `EXAMPLE:` section, those tests will be run twice and take longer. I do not mind doing this, but i do not see the point since any test is already run at least once. Tell me.

OK, I see your point.

One reason to still have `# random` is to make it more explicit that the output of the test is random. When a test says "not tested", it is not clear why it is not tested. At the very least, write something like `# not tested (random order)`.

How much time do those tests take? If we're talking about a few seconds, then I would just use `# random`.

And the reviewer name is still missing.
