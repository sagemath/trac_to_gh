Keywords: SymmetricGroup

The following doesn't seem right to me.  I tried this on sage 4.5.3 and 4.6.  My impression is that the SymmetricGroup function can take a list of distinct integers X as an argument and give the symmetric group S_X.  However, we can try the following.

sage: f=SymmetricGroup([1,2,4])
sage: for i in f:
....:     print i
....: 

()
(2,3)
(1,2)
(1,2,3)
(1,3,2)
(1,3)
sage: f[3]
(1,2,3)
sage: f[3](4)
4
sage: f[3](3)
1
sage: f.set()
(1, 2, 4)

Thus, it seems that f.set() returns that right support, but in fact the support for the group is 1,2,3.  This suggests to me that S_X = S_{1,2,3}.
