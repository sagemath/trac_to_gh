`@`vdelecroix Do you know where to find or how to generate a clean list of builtin functions (for gap 4.8.3 or later) ?\\
`dir(gap)` alone seems to return more stuff than needed (constants and the like). \\

There is a list from gap's jupyter syntax highliting ([here](https://github.com/gap-packages/JupyterKernel/blob/master/etc/gap-mode/gap.js)).
Should we include function names from gap packages or rather do like gap's jupyter syntax highliting ? (Only 1823 new function names in the later case).

I did not investigate anything. This is just empirical constatation.

I think that this list could be obtained directly from GAP/libGAP (at execution time).

This is also fixed since #27911.
