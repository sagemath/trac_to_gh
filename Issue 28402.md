Keywords: polyhedron, normaliz

This ticket implements a method to initialize a cone from vertices, rays, inequations and equalities.

This method can be useful to unpickle a saved instance of `Polyhedron_normaliz`, where the normaliz cone has been removed. Also it can be used to set up a polyhedron with normaliz with given `Vrepresentation` and `Hrepresentation`.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28639

I have set up doctests to test whether the cone is correct. Are there critical/important examples missing there?

I'm also a bit puzzled that it states that the equations are not precomputed from the data (see EXAMPLE block in the code). However, not giving the equations will lead to errors.

I fixed the alignment error and also at the place, where I copied it from.

The method is not being used yet. I added a branch to #26363, which uses it in order to fix pickling/unpickling.
Initializing from both `Vrep` and `Hrep` does not work yet. Eventually, we should open a new ticket and allow it at least when converting to backend normaliz.
