True, thankfully this is a trivial fix if we assume there are no spaces in compiler path.

By default scons searches the system and to set up its environment, if you specify tools it skips this search and just sets stuff up with the given tools. Currently all this does is speed up the configuring process, but this can be used to make sage respect the CC, CXX, LD, AR,... variables.

The SConstruct file doesn't work.  First make a symbolic link "gplusplus" to "g++".  Then:

```

So, I think

Should be fixed now, although sage still doesn't build with clang (although I'm fairly confident this is due to other spkgs at this point).

I also threw in something to test for suncc, but I can't test it, so if you can let me know how it works, that would be great.

Related, and equally important:

If `CFLAGS` are set (even to `""`), Python's `CFLAGS` are dropped, which include `-fno-strict-aliasing`, which means that you currently always have to manually add `-fno-strict-aliasing` when setting/modifying `CFLAGS` (and building with GCC), since otherwise invalid code is generated for (at least some) Cython modules.

(`-fstrict-aliasing` in contrast is *enabled* by most of GCC's `O`-levels.)

Luckily, if you build Python with `CC` or `CXX` set, the Sage library just picks up these settings, so I personally never had trouble with the main topic of this ticket, while other spkgs (like Lcalc, ratpoints, zn_poly and even Singular!) still suck...
