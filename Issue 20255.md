In `module_list.py`, `cblas_libs` should be a list. However, under cygwin, it is a string, leading to

```
TypeError: can only concatenate list (not "str") to list
```

Looks ok to me. If you say it makes things works on cygwin that's enough for me.

I have encountered this as well and meant to fix it.  I was looking into a deeper fix to allow blas libs to be handled through pkg-config on Cygwin, which should be possible now. But this fix obviously was needed in the meantime.
