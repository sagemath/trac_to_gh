# Issue 25015: Complex arithmetic/exponentiation hang (or very slow)

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25252

Original creator: @aerusso

Original creation time: 2018-04-26 17:17:06

CC:  rws

Debian unstable (either downloaded directly or from the Debian repositories), running 8.1. Trying to multiply

(1+exp(i*pi/4))*exp(i*pi/4)

does not terminate (in a reasonable amount of time)

exp(i*pi/4)+exp(i*pi/4)*exp(i*pi/4)

on the other hand, resolves fine.

Sorry if this is a duplicate bug.

It's OK in Sage 8.1.beta5 and all previous versions of Sage:

```
sage: (1+exp(i*pi/4))*exp(i*pi/4) 
-(1/4*I + 1/4)*sqrt(2)*(-(I + 1)*sqrt(2) - 2)
```

It hangs in Sage 8.1.beta8. So the bug was introduced between Sage 8.1.beta6 and 8.1.beta8.

Fixed in pynac-0.7.17 (#24838). See also #24768. This ticket should add a doctest.
