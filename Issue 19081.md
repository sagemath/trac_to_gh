This (small) patch allows one to compute the inverse of a unit in an `IntegerModRing`. It provides the following functionality:


```python
sage: R = IntegerModRing(10)
sage: R(7).inverse_of_unit()
3
sage: R(4).inverse_of_unit() # 4 is not a unit in ZZ/10ZZ
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ZeroDivisionError: Inverse does not exist.
```

Why do we need this? You can use `^-1` for the same result.

That's right... I did not think to try to use `^-1` and I found weird not to have an `inverse` function for these rings. And using `^-1` is actually faster than my code! So it makes no sense to include my code within Sage. Yet, since many rings implement a method `inverse_of_unit`, it may add some unity (or consistency) to have one here too. So please let me know what you think is more appropriate between:

* simply marking this ticket as "won't fix" and not providing the method `inverse_of_unit`;
* replacing my code by something like `return self^-1` to provide a method `inverse_of_unit`.

Note that both are fine to me, I do not have a real preference for any of the two solutions.

As this `inverse_of_unit` does not implement a special algorithm to compute the inverse, it should not be a method of `IntegerModRing`.

I advise you to ask in Sage support or Sage devel first if you think you found something missing in Sage.

I will mark this ticket as "won't fix"
