It would be nice to have a function which converts algebraic numbers to symbolic expressions using radicals, at least for those cases where this is possible (i.e. the cases where the minimal polynomial of the algebraic number has a degree less than 5). For the quadratic case, I have a code snippet to illustrate what I'm asking for:


```
def AA2SR(x):
    x = AA(x)
    p = x.minpoly()
    if p.degree() < 2:
        return SR(QQ(x))
    if p.degree() > 2:
        raise TypeError("Cannot handle degrees > 2")
    c, b, a = p.coeffs()
    y = (-b+sqrt(b*b-4*a*c))/(2*a)
    if x == AA(y):
        return y
    y = (-b-sqrt(b*b-4*a*c))/(2*a)
    assert x == AA(y)
    return y

def QQbar2SR(x):
    x = QQbar(x)
    return AA2SR(x.real()) + I*AA2SR(x.imag())
```


These functions could then be applied to vectors or matrices over algebraic real or complex numbers in order to obtain an exact description of the relevant values using radicals.

This request is a spin-off from [my question on Ask Sage](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/2209/radical-expression-for-algebraic-number).

I think the feature you are looking for sort of exists. But it is available for elements of number fields, not algebraic numbers. And it is pretty inconvenient to use with algebraic numbers because `alg.as_number_field_element()` returns `alg` as an element of an abstract number field (plus an embedding of that number field into `QQbar` or `AA`), while conversion to symbolic expressions expects a number field with a registered embedding into `CC` or `RR`.

Yet, with the example from your question on AskSage, one can do:

```
sage: a = N[0][0]
sage: nf, val, nf2alg = a.as_number_field_element()
sage: approx = CC(nf2alg(nf.gen()))
sage: embedded_nf = NumberField(nf.polynomial(), 'a', embedding=approx)
sage: nf2nf = sage.rings.number_field.number_field_morphisms.NumberFieldEmbedding(nf, embedded_nf, embedded_nf.gen())
sage: SR(nf2nf(val))
1/5*sqrt(5)
```


So I disagree with the approach you take in your patch: IMO, we should make something like the above example work automatically and share the actual conversion code between algebraic numbers and number fields instead of implementing essentially the same feature twice.

I notice that in real world applications, the check for `self == QQbar(res)` takes excessively long. Example:

`QQ[x](16*x^6 - 392*x^4 + 133*x^2 + 900).roots(AA, False)[-1].radical_expression()`

It gets stuck in several layers of `exactify`, but eventually the keyboard interrupt ends up here:

Even as it stands, having the `as_radical_expression` method is better than not having it. So this comment here should be no reason not to merge the branch, in my opinion.

{
    "body": "The problem is, an expression like this:\n\n```\n(2/9*I*sqrt(443)*sqrt(3) + 53/27)^(1/3)\n```\n\nhas (at least) 3 possible values. You need to specify branch cuts to single out a particular value in, say, CC. Algebraically, `sqrt(443)`, `sqrt(3)`, and `I` have the same problem. So when you first construct this element you are making essentially the ring\n\n```\nQQ[x,y,z,w]/(x^2-443,y^2-3,z^2+1,w^3-(2/9*z*x*y + 53/27))\n```\n\nwhich is of rather high degree.\n\nThe other elements you add to this will just add to the degree, since the next time a `sqrt(443)` is encountered, it is not algebraically clear that this is supposed to be the same as the one designated by `x`. The complex embedding that comes with AA or Qbar specifies some of the ambiguity (e.g., the branch cut of `sqrt(443)` will ensure the \"positive\" root always), but once you start taking roots of complex numbers, the cuts might not even do what they algebraically are supposed to (e.g., `-(z)^(1/3) != (-z)^(1/3)` ).\n\nWhile in the expression for `b` that you give, it is exactly the same expression that you are taking the cube root of repeatedly, one can only see this after careful inspection. For a human it's clear you're meaning the \"same\" cube root every time, but the computer has no immediate way of finding that out. A priori, all the choices made by `sqrt...` and `(...)^(1/3)` are considered as algebraically unrelated and only with laborious computations using the embedding in `CC` does one rediscover those relations. If instead you do\n\n```\nu=Qbar(sqrt(-3))\nv=Qbar(sqrt(443))*u\nw=Qbar( (2/9*v+53/27)^(1/3))\n```\n\nand then construct b from that, you should already get a little faster results.\n\nThe problems you are running into are fairly well-understood and real. Symbolic notation as you use it fails to express the full algebraic relations once you start repeating related expressions.\n\n**EDIT:** apologies.

The problem is, an expression like this:

```
(2/9*I*sqrt(443)*sqrt(3) + 53/27)^(1/3)
```

has (at least) 3 possible values. You need to specify branch cuts to single out a particular value in, say, CC. Algebraically, `sqrt(443)`, `sqrt(3)`, and `I` have the same problem. So when you first construct this element you are making essentially the ring

```
QQ[x,y,z,w]/(x^2-443,y^2-3,z^2+1,w^3-(2/9*z*x*y + 53/27))
```

which is of rather high degree.

The other elements you add to this will just add to the degree, since the next time a `sqrt(443)` is encountered, it is not algebraically clear that this is supposed to be the same as the one designated by `x`. The complex embedding that comes with AA or Qbar specifies some of the ambiguity (e.g., the branch cut of `sqrt(443)` will ensure the "positive" root always), but once you start taking roots of complex numbers, the cuts might not even do what they algebraically are supposed to (e.g., `-(z)^(1/3) != (-z)^(1/3)` ).

While in the expression for `b` that you give, it is exactly the same expression that you are taking the cube root of repeatedly, one can only see this after careful inspection. For a human it's clear you're meaning the "same" cube root every time, but the computer has no immediate way of finding that out. A priori, all the choices made by `sqrt...` and `(...)^(1/3)` are considered as algebraically unrelated and only with laborious computations using the embedding in `CC` does one rediscover those relations. If instead you do

```
u=Qbar(sqrt(-3))
v=Qbar(sqrt(443))*u
w=Qbar( (2/9*v+53/27)^(1/3))
```

and then construct b from that, you should already get a little faster results.

The problems you are running into are fairly well-understood and real. Symbolic notation as you use it fails to express the full algebraic relations once you start repeating related expressions.

**EDIT:** apologies. The fact that the value didn't match was due to a missubstitution on my part. I've corrected the result below. The value `b` computed does match what it's supposed to be:

```
sage: u=QQbar(sqrt(-3))
sage: v=QQbar(sqrt(443))*u
sage: w=(2/9*v + 53/27)^(1/3)
sage: b = -1/1296*((9*u*w + 9*w - 37*u/w + 37/w + 18)*(9*u*w + 9*w - 37*u/w + 37/w - 12) - 3456)*sqrt(-9/2*u*w - 9/2*w + 37/2*u/w - 37/2/w + 6)
sage: b
4.904821984561304? + 0.?e-16*I
sage: 16*b.minpoly() #still takes a long time
16*x^6 - 392*x^4 + 133*x^2 + 900
```

The fundamental problem remains, though: the symbolic version doesn't quite carry the same information. In addition, some of the slowness might be due to ``QQbar` itself, since:

```
sage: t=(-9/2*u*w - 9/2*w + 37/2*u/w - 37/2/w + 6)
sage: t.minpoly() # this is fast
x^3 - 18*x^2 - 891*x + 2916
sage: r=sqrt(t)
sage: r.minpoly() # this is quite slow
x^6 - 18*x^4 - 891*x^2 + 2916
sage: b = -1/1296*((9*u*w + 9*w - 37*u/w + 37/w + 18)*(9*u*w + 9*w - 37*u/w + 37/w - 12) - 3456)*r
sage: b.minpoly() #this is now pretty quick
x^6 - 49/2*x^4 + 133/16*x^2 + 225/4
```

so QQbar is slow exactifying an element `r` for which it has all relevant algebraic information (it's the square root of `t`, which has a known minimal polynomial)

Computer algebra systems such as maple have their own symbolic ways of dealing with the ambiguity introduced by defining elements as "roots" of polynomials:

```
> lprint(solve(x^5+4*x+1));
RootOf(_Z^5+4*_Z+1,index = 1), RootOf(_Z^5+4*_Z+1,index = 2), RootOf(_Z^5+4*_Z
+1,index = 3), RootOf(_Z^5+4*_Z+1,index = 4), RootOf(_Z^5+4*_Z+1,index = 5)
```

which allows it to simplify `RootOf(_Z^5+4*_Z+1,index = 1)-RootOf(_Z^5+4*_Z+1,index = 1)` to 0 but leave `RootOf(_Z^5+4*_Z+1,index = 1)-RootOf(_Z^5+4*_Z+1,index = 2)` alone. This doesn't capture the algebraic dependencies between the roots, but at least allows identification of each root individually.

Even with #16651 fixed, there are several reasons why I'd consider the detour via `NumberFieldElement` to be inferior to my approach here.

1. In case of no exact solution, `NumberFieldElement` will use an approximation, while my idea here is to never loose precision. So you'd have to either declare all uses of approximation in `NumberFieldElement` to be undesired as well, or add some flag to suppress approximate solutions. Or detect them after the fact, and hope I get it right this time around.

2. In some cases, the degree used for the conversion to a number field element is much bigger than that of the minimal polynomial. In [one case](https://gist.github.com/gagern/7fc8ebccfdff9b545771) I've seen the number field to have a dense defining polynomial of degree 24, while the minpoly only had even degrees up to 6. This might of course well be considered a bug in its own right.

3. My code can deal with a situation where the number of distinct roots found by the symbolic solver does not equal the degree of the polynomial. `NumberFieldElement` will give up in that situation. I don't know yet whether we might encounter polynomials with multiple roots, and I don't know how likely it is for the solver to find only a subset of all roots. But with a too high degree and the use of `to_poly_solve=True` I consider both likely.

4. I'm not sure I trust the root matching in `ambient_field=ComplexField(53)`. There are cases where the different roots cannot be distinguished in this field, and I believe that in these cases the approach of “taking the closest root” is unreliable at best.

If you are confident that most of the issues raised above should be fixed for `NumberFieldElement` as well, then I'll investigate options to share code between both implementations.

With `AA` resp. `QQbar` the computation is available for *any* element of the field, and is *always* based on the minimal polynomial (for the sake of consistency), even for cyclotomic elements. For `NumberFieldElement` the computation is only performed for the generator, and only for non-cyaclotomic fields, so the code we're talking about is one of may possible cases in a larger control flow structure. What is more, the cast from `NumberFieldElement` to `AA` resp. `QQbar` is easy and cheap.

Replying to [comment:38 jdemeyer]:
> I think it's much more natural to combine code the other way around: implement everything on the level of `NumberFieldElement` and then call that code from `AA`/`QQbar`.

I disagree. With `AA` resp. `QQbar` the computation is available for *any* element of the field, and is *always* based on the minimal polynomial (for the sake of consistency), even for cyclotomic elements. For `NumberFieldElement` the computation is only performed for the generator, and only for non-cyaclotomic fields, so the code we're talking about is one of may possible cases in a larger control flow structure. What is more, the cast from `NumberFieldElement` to `AA` resp. `QQbar` is easy and cheap. The converse has quite a bulky syntax, as you can see in comment:3, and can be quite costly, as I mentioned in comment:26 item 2.

Or, to put it differently, this is not about converting number field elements. This is about converting the *generator* of a number field, which itself is an algebraic number, into a symbolic expression. This involves finding solutions of a symbolic polynomial, comparing isolating intervals (which is a thing of algebraic numbers not number field elements), and if that fails, casting to an algebraic number and comparing the result for equality. Seems to me a lot closer to algebraic numbers than to number field elements.

No, it was a very general comment of the form "don't work around bugs". If you say "I implemented this by doing B instead of the more obvious A, since A is broken", then that's a sign that you should fix A first and then use A.

In my opinion it makes sense to have the special case for cyclotomics in number field element. Take the example from the doctest:


```
sage: K.<zeta> = CyclotomicField(19)
sage: SR(zeta) # indirect doctest
e^(2/19*I*pi)
```


Yes, this is a conversion of a number field generator to the symbolic ring, so it should be the output of a conversion from number field to symbolic. On the other hand, this is *not* a radical expression, therefore it would be unsuitable for `AlgebraicNumber_base.radical_expression()`. That's the reason I didn't move that code.

Of course, you could argue that we should have `AlgebraicNumber_base.symbolic_expression()`. But I'd still like to keep access to the radical expressions, for those cases where both make sense. Example:


```
sage: K.<z10> = CyclotomicField(10)
sage: a = z10 + z10^9
sage: SR(a)
-(e^(1/5*I*pi) - 1)*e^(2/5*I*pi) + 1
sage: AA(QQbar(SR(a))).radical_expression()
1/2*sqrt(5) + 1/2
```


The first thing makes sense if you are explicitely working in a cyclotomic field, where the symbolic expression for `z10` is something you can reasonably expect in your output. If, on the other hand, you work with algebraic numbers, you shouldn't have to care about the internal representation. Hiding the different internal implementations behind a common interface therefore felt good. *Every* algebraic number has a minimal polynomial. So I'm using that as the basis for my conversion. Special-casing the cyclotomics in qqbar would be a lot harder. It would depend on the actual descriptors, which in turn depend on the number fields used in their leafs, which in turn makes this conversion closer to number fields than what I did with the radical expressions.

So if I can convince you, I'd like to keep the current split as it is in my commits, and suggest a follow-up ticket for `AlgebraicNumber_base.symbolic_expression()`, where the best approach to implement that might still be subject to discussion.

Thanks for the rationale from comment:35. Can you add test cases for each of these benefits? I see you already wrote one for the case where the generator has no radical expression. So far none of the existing test cases covers the other two benefits, though, since none had to be changed.

Since you removed the caching of symbolic expressions in the `__symbolic` member of the number field element, I think you should also remove said member from the `number_field_element.pxd` since it is without use now.

I'm still not happy that now we'll have to fix two other issues before we can evaluate what you did here and see whether the (quite valid) gains are worth the performance penalty due to the removal of caching. Or, to be more precise, I'm unhappy that my own modifications are blocked together with this.

I also have some doubts about the `refine_embedding` approach. As far as I can see, the refined embedding *should* get cached in the number field, but I'd prefer to see that verified by a test case.

I understand your unhappiness, but consider that #17495 should be quite easy to fix and that #16964 is very much in need of a fix anyway (for various reasons, not just this ticket).

Perhaps, but those comments really belong to #17495.

However, it fails in cases where we are unable to find a radical expression for the element even though we would have been able to find one for the generator. Case in point:


```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(QQ['x']([6, -65, 163, -185, 81, -15, 1]), embedding=4.9)
sage: b = a + a^3
sage: SR(b)
120.55238677055798?
sage: b.polynomial()(SR(a))
1/8*((sqrt(4*(1/9*sqrt(109)*sqrt(3) + 2)^(1/3) - 4/3/(1/9*sqrt(109)*sqrt(3) + 2)^(1/3) + 17) + 5)^2 + 4)*(sqrt(4*(1/9*sqrt(109)*sqrt(3) + 2)^(1/3) - 4/3/(1/9*sqrt(109)*sqrt(3) + 2)^(1/3) + 17) + 5)
```


Not sure how to proceed here. One approach would be to try conversion of the non-generator element first, and if that fails (as evidenced by `x.radical_expression().parent() != SR`) try again for the generator and plug that into the polynomial.

Looking back to comment:3 I find that for the example from comment:67 that approach is able to find a radical expression on the level of the algebraic numbers, without knowledge of the original number field:


```
sage: c = AA.polynomial_root(b.minpoly(), RIF(120,121))
sage: nf, val, nf2alg = c.as_number_field_element()
sage: val.polynomial()(nf2alg(nf.gen()).radical_expression())
1/8*((sqrt(4*(1/9*sqrt(109)*sqrt(3) + 2)^(1/3) - 4/3/(1/9*sqrt(109)*sqrt(3) + 2)^(1/3) + 17) + 13)*(sqrt(4*(1/9*sqrt(109)*sqrt(3) + 2)^(1/3) - 4/3/(1/9*sqrt(109)*sqrt(3) + 2)^(1/3) + 17) + 1) + 52)*(sqrt(4*(1/9*sqrt(109)*sqrt(3) + 2)^(1/3) - 4/3/(1/9*sqrt(109)*sqrt(3) + 2)^(1/3) + 17) + 1) + 10
```


So in a certain sense, `as_number_field_element` makes it easier to find a symbolic expression for a given algebraic number, even though the expression found in this way may be more complicated. I wonder whether I should include that into my `radical_expression` method. Probably with a switch to allow disabling it.

That introduces regressions: stuff that used to convert to SR in the past will fail to do so once this gets merged. I'd prefer to avoid such breaks in backward compatibility, even if it means less elegant behavior.

What's the status here? We have a bunch of other tickets developing from this one here, but we shouldn't forget about this here. Could I convince you to keep the backwards compatible fallback with the generator conversion for number field elements? Do you have any doubts about the rest of the code? Should I push a forced update to my branch, dropping that `via_nf` stuff and instead adding some comments about the fact that finding roots using maxima is preliminary until #17516 gets addressed? Anything else you need to give this your approval?

But then, the exact root of unity depends on the embedding... and I do not see how to avoid going to `QQbar` (or using in an ugly way interval approximations).
