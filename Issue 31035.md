Is that more than a typo? Were you planning to add more to that sentence and/or did the next line accidentally get deleted? If just a typo, I would delete ``a, b` and add a period.

Actually, that was my previous attempt that I thought I had removed as I felt the line the preceding paragraph was a more natural place.
