# Issue 33003: Demote all import error to warning for now

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33240

The test for all imports currently fails for all tickets and thus hides new linting issues introduced in that ticket. Until these imports are fixed, demote the error to a warning.

Yes, since there was a real error hidden under the flood of these import issues. Since it was trivial to fix, let's do it also as part of this ticket.

This is a good solution. Didn't know about the "error: false" feature

the linter is still broken, for all tickets based on 9.6.b1

This is unrelated to this ticket and a consequence of the `six` import introduced in #25633 and/or #33284.
