# Issue 30210: Implementing point reductions to finite topological spaces

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30447

Original creator: @jcuevas-rozo

Original creation time: 2020-08-26 23:00:54

CC:  jhpalmieri

Keywords: Finite topological spaces

This is a continuation of the work started in ticket #30400. It is expected to add functionalities to identify beat points, weak points, the core of a finite space and functions related to techniques preserving (weak) homotopy types in finite spaces.
