CC:  @vbraun @dimpase @jdemeyer konrad127123

Keywords: destdir gcc

This does a few things:

* Updates the gcc SPKG to support DESTDIR installation so that it can now be uninstalled as well

* This includes a patch (adapted from Debian) to make gcc install libraries to `${prefix}/lib` instead of `${prefix}/lib64` on Linux (this does not appear to be a problem on Cygwin, macOS, or FreeBSD that I'm aware of).

* Additional refactoring to reduce duplication between the gcc and gfortran SPKGs: This includes the patches from gcc as the can also be relevant to gfortran.

I've tested this a good bit on Linux (being able to uninstall gcc now is nice), but it needs more testing on other platforms, particularly macOS since it's the primary case for installing this package in the first place, and involves additional workarounds.

This would also fix #26996 for the case of installing gfortran on Linux.

Actually that's a large part of why I pinged you.  Although this was motivated by fixing an issue on Linux, OSX is the primary reason we package gcc and gfortran at all.  And since this reworks those packages a bit it needs OSX testing.  Plus, whatever disagreements we've had in the past, your reviews are always thorough and thoughtful.

Sorry, I misread something in the ticket description so I thought it didn't apply.

I don't know if I will have the time. I have installed gfortran on all of my OS X machines precisely so I don't have to build Sage's gcc each time I build Sage, so I would have to temporarily hide gfortran, build with and without this branch, making sure everything works as advertised. If I stumble on some free time soon I will try to do it, but it may not happen.
