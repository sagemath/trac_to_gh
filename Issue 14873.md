Keywords: matrix constructor

Here is the bug


```
sage: S.<t> = LaurentSeriesRing(ZZ)
sage: MS = MatrixSpace(S,1,1)
sage: MS([t])
[1]
```


(The reason is the following: Sage makes a confusion between `t` and its list of coefficients and hence do as there was written `MS([This is the Trac macro *1* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#1-macro))`.)

The attached patch fixes this. I hope that it breaks nothing else.

Rob, what do you think? Allow any iterable or insist that it is list/tuple/vector? The former is more general but can lead to surprising effects...
