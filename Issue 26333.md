These look fine to me, but I'm curious why the changes are necessary.  Aside from whitespace, it looks like you're changing `sqrt(blah)` to `blah.sqrt()` and `round(blah)` to `blah.round()`.  Is there a reason the former aren't okay in python 3?

Pyflakes is complaining about `sqrt` not being used:

```
src/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/padic_lseries.py:727: 'sage.functions.all.sqrt' imported but unused
```

No special reason for sqrt.

In python3, the function round(x) calls the method x.__round__() that sage does not have. Sage only has x.round() with a slightly different semantic.
