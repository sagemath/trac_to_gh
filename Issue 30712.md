Currently we have `SAGE_SPKG_DEPCHECK([sqlite libpng bzip2 xz libffi], ...)`, which causes system python3 to be rejected on many systems.

We should review whether this can be made more fine-grained.

`SAGE_SPKG_DEPCHECK` is specifically for checking whether we are going to install a shared library that may interfere with a system-provided version of the same shared library that the package is linked against.

**Package `sqlite`** - done in #30559

Here we follow up to address the following dependencies:

**Package `libpng`**.....

```
$ grep libpng build/pkgs/*/dependencies
build/pkgs/brial/dependencies:boost_cropped m4ri libpng | pkgconf
build/pkgs/cryptominisat/dependencies:$(PYTHON) m4ri zlib libpng | cmake sqlite boost_cropped
build/pkgs/freetype/dependencies:libpng bzip2
build/pkgs/giac/dependencies:readline libpng $(MP_LIBRARY) mpfr mpfi ntl gsl pari glpk curl
build/pkgs/libgd/dependencies:libpng freetype
build/pkgs/libtheora/dependencies:libogg libpng
build/pkgs/m4ri/dependencies:libpng
build/pkgs/python3/dependencies:zlib readline sqlite libpng bzip2 xz libffi

build/pkgs/tachyon/dependencies:libpng
```


**Package `bzip2`**......


```
$ grep bzip2 build/pkgs/*/dependencies
build/pkgs/cbc/dependencies:readline zlib bzip2 $(BLAS)
build/pkgs/cmake/dependencies:curl zlib bzip2 xz
build/pkgs/freetype/dependencies:libpng bzip2
build/pkgs/pcre/dependencies:bzip2
build/pkgs/python3/dependencies:zlib readline sqlite libpng bzip2 xz libffi
build/pkgs/r/dependencies:$(BLAS) gfortran iconv readline bzip2 xz pcre curl | pkgconf
```


**Package `xz`** represents both the shared library `liblzma` and the `xz` binary.  #30948

**Package `libffi`**....

```
$ grep libffi build/pkgs/*/dependencies
build/pkgs/ecl/dependencies:$(MP_LIBRARY) readline gc libffi
build/pkgs/python3/dependencies:zlib readline sqlite libpng bzip2 xz libffi
```
