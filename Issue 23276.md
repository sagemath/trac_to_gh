#23204 introduced a regression for `is_injective`/`is_surjective`. These method are not widely implemented yet but we could improve their performance:

```
sage: V1 = QQ^2
sage: V2 = QQ^3
sage: phi1 = (QQ^1).hom(Matrix([This is the Trac macro *1, 1* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#1, 1-macro)), V1)
sage: phi2 = V1.hom(Matrix([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]), V2)
sage: from sage.categories.map import FormalCompositeMap
sage: c1 = FormalCompositeMap(Hom(QQ^1, V2, phi1.category_for()), phi1, phi2)
sage: %timeit c1.is_injective()
100000 loops, best of 3: 4.88 µs per loop # before
10000 loops, best of 3: 41.9 µs per loop # after
```
