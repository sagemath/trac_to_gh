All looks fine apart from this:

```
-    dlist = sum([v for h, v in iteritems(discriminants_with_bounded_class_number(K.degree(), proof=proof))], [])
+    dlist = sorted(Df for v in discriminants_with_bounded_class_number(K.degree(), proof=proof).values() for Df in v)
```

whose syntax looks suspicious to me.

Hmm. Why suspicious ? The "sorted" is the only real change we are making here. If my understanding of the mathematics involved is ok, this should not be a problem.

Or maybe you are troubled by the double for ? This is a perfectly valid python syntax. We can chain the "for", the second one depending on the argument of the first. Here the effect is to flatten a list of lists.

Thanks for the lesson!  I had never seen a double for so thought it was a mistake (and did not have time to check).
