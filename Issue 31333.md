in the spirit of python3

There is still room for improvement in this method. One could try to cache the maximal chains below any given element.

Not that this needs to be changed, but you could have done

```diff
-if partial is None or not partial:
+ if not partial:
```

since `not None` is `True`.

This ticket is merged, but i think that the Py3thonic way is not to name things `*_iterator`, just keep the names, and users are able to do `list(*)` if they need, this has been discussed a few times on sage-devel.
