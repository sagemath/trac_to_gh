# Issue 21339: Some `weight_enumerator` for linear codes

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21576

Keywords: linear_code, beginner

In `linear_code.py` there is some code mess with the use of `spectrum` vs `weight_enumerator`. Also `grs.py` overrides `weight_enumerator` for no reason and provides a poorer interface.

Hi Johan,

I agree with your fix. `src/sage/coding` doctests also pass.
