# Issue 24866: Minimal polynomials of elements in p-adic fields

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25103

If `a` is an element in a finite extension `K` of `Qp`, the call `a.minimal_polynomial('x')` returns the minimal polynomial of `a` over `K` (which is always a polynomial degree `1`) although it should return the minimal polynomial of `x` over `Qp`.


```
sage: K.<a> = Qq(5^3)
sage: a.minimal_polynomial('x')
(1 + O(5^20))*x + 4*a + 4*a*5 + ... + 4*a*5^19 + O(5^20)
```

Maybe the easiest thing to do is to build a linear relation between the powers of `x` using linear algebra tools. But for this, we need to wait for ticket #23486.

I didn't really review this as all the changes from #23218 are mixed in here but I think that the `ground` parameter should probably be called `base`, at least that's what I have seen in some other places.

`ground` was the name which was used before this ticket but I agree with you.

Similarly, I would be in favour to change `name` to `var`.

For each of review, I've attached a diff with #23218.

I just made the merge with #24843.  Looks good!

Great!

Just a question: don't we address Julian's comment (which was to replace `ground` by `base`)?

Good point.  I've pushed that change and am rerunning doctests.
