I think if someone is using these functions, they know what they are doing and will either find this ticket or can `grep` their way around. So we do not need to do any hand-holding old code with moving these functions. (I'm just justifying to any future readers of this ticket why we did not deprecate moving these functions.)

LGTM.

Indeed. These are very technical things, not meant for ordinary users.
