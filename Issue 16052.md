# Issue 16052: Fix ZZ.cartesian_product(...)

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16289

Original creator: nthiery

Original creation time: 2014-05-04 23:29:18

CC:  sage-combinat ncohen vdelecroix

This fails due to an inadvertent change introduced by #12959:

```
sage: ZZ.cartesian_product(GF(2), NN)
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
AttributeError: type object 'sage.rings.integer_ring.IntegerRing_class' has no attribute 'CartesianProduct'
```

This ticket reverts this change and adds a doctest.

This branch apparently includes #16269 as a dependency... But perhaps that is not a problem anyway as it is already reviewed ?

........................... and this branch also depends on the commit labeled with "rac 16269 (or follow up)" which is actually not #16269 but #16288...

(I set the dependencies that appear in the branch, please update it if you rewrite the branch as some of these dependencies are not necessary. But of course possibly we don't care for as long as everything gets reviewed)

There actually is a small semantic dependency upon #16269 since it changes the output of one of the doctests of this ticket. For #16288, oh well. Let's just keep the branch as it is. As you say we don't really care since everything is positive reviewed or close enough to be so.

Yoooooo !

Looks totally nice... Do you have any idea why there was a `__class__` there ? It does not make any sense to me `O_o`

Go figure ... This looks a bit more like a call to a class method rather than a call to a usual method, since we pass explicitly `self` as first argument. So maybe the point was to emphasize that? Anyway we don't need it, so it's as good without it.

Yep it seems clearer this way.... `O_O`

Okay, good to go... I need to calm down a bit. I just "reviewed" #16246.

Did you check the doctests ?

Yup, all long tests passed for me!

Okay, so positive review and I will check the docstest again on my office's computer again just in case, now that Leandro turned it on again.
