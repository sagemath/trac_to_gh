The main part of your changes LGTM, it is good to have this extra flexibility. I just have some issues with the docstring you changed.

For the first paragraph, I am not a fan of giving implementation details to the more casual user in the docstring. If they care about such details, then they almost certainly are already looking at the code. I know it was there previously, but now it has been given more prominence. So I think the first paragraph about the function being a factory should go last (although I really would like to remove it altogether).

The second paragraph is good (I am not counting the one-line description as a paragraph).

I don't really understand the third paragraph, even what you are trying to  say. My thought is that it will be far too technical and likely should be removed. Although it would be worthwhile to state that iterating through the object returns the values rather than the keys.

I don't understand the second part of the fourth paragraph. I think I know what you are trying to say, but that is not anything that belongs in this documentation. It seems like a code comment for within the category. I don't think the first sentence is even necessary (this is true for nearly every object in Sage).

I would change `.. NOTE::` -> `.. WARNING::`.

Unfortunately I don't see how that is in the documentation (beyond the `.. WARNING::`; also ``__iter__`` -> ```__iter__``` in there). Nor does that seem to be true that is is `values()`:

```
sage: F = Family([1,1,1])
sage: F
Family (1, 1, 1)
sage: F.cardinality()
3
```

The `__len__` also redirects from `cardinality()` by default (from the category). Or perhaps that is your point, that it is different than what you would expect as a set (of values). Since this is a mapping, it is a set of pairs `(k, v)`, so the cardinality for me is consistent.

Okay, I think I understand better what you want to say. I think you can say the same thing as

```
Note that for most set operations, this is considered as the set
of values; for instance, containment. There are some it is considered
as a map, such as its cardinality.
```

No, it just means that the interpretation that a Family "is" a function makes no sense.

Here's a mathematical definition of a family that's better for us (= the programming context in which Family is used):

It "is" a set which "has" additionally a map from a (possibly ordered) set of keys onto it.

The comparison with C++ STL map is not very useful. Its elements are pairs. Calling `iterator` gives pairs.

Python `dict` does not have this behavior. Calling `iter` iterates through its keys.

And `Family` has neither behavior of the two. Calling `iter` iterates through values.

This sounds like it would introduce a major inconsistency: Two things are equal (by taking the set-of-values) with different cardinalities! If we are not going to replace it by `ImageSubset`, then we are going to have to live with some inconsistency. It is a much smaller one to simply state that iteration and containment is done on its values.

Additionally, `Family` doesn't have an `_element_constructor_`, nor does it support the `__call__` syntax (it raises a `NotImplementedError`). It uses `F[x]` instead of `F(x)` to be used as a `dict` replacement.

So this doesn't count:

```
[(k, F[k]) for k in F.keys()]
```

which is just a slight modification of

```
[(k, d[k]) for k in d]
```

for a `dict` `d`?

A `dict` only has one thing that returns the pairs, which is `items()`. The key-value pairs are also implicit in the equality comparison; more explicitly when it not a lazy family (comparing the `_enumeration` or `_dictionary`).

It has a very similar API to `dict` with an easy way to produce key-value pairs. With Python3, this is less useful for `dict` (as it doesn't create a new list of values but simply iterates over them), but `Family` was not written in that era.

That doesn't have anywhere near such precise definitions. All that is required is those methods are implemented. I don't think there is any consistency requirements. There are natural ones we impose, such as the length of the result of `__iter__` is the same as `__len__`, but note that both have to be implemented by the programmer.

OK then, I propose the following. I revert the changes to the `values()` method so that it is not an `ImageSubobject` as proposed but gives an iterable that runs parallel to `keys`. (I can also throw in an `items()` method.)
