Keywords: gcc wrapper rpath

This ticket aims to implement a gcc wrapper that will change gcc/ld/... arguments before passing them on to the underlying compiler binaries. The most current version is at 

https://bitbucket.org/vbraun/gcc-wrapper

Right now, the wrappers
* remove any extra rpath that is set
* set the rpath to `$ORIGIN/../lib`. This makes the sage binaries look for their libraries in `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib` and no `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` hacks are necessary.
* some gcc optimization settings are removed on itanium and gcc 4.4.1. See also #10430.

The wrapper is implemented in pure C++ and does not depend on any Sage component.

TODO:
* Make the underlying ld binary independently configurable - this will simplify building Sage on Solaris.

I think this is a particularly bad idea. Also be aware that whilst Sage has only ever been built with gcc, there are advantages in building it with the Sun compiler. In fact, in the case of R, it will be necessary on Solaris x86 to build that component with the Sun compiler for a 64-bit build. The R manual states R has never been built 64-bit on Solaris x86 with the GNU compiler. 

What happens if the compiler is not gcc? 

So please don't go making assumptions about compilers and linkers. Bear in mind Solaris system may have gcc configured to use either the GNU or Sun linker.  

This whole idea of the ticket gets a -1 from me. It will make further porting efforts more difficult.

I think your negative attitude towards this ticket is probably a misunderstanding. I believe that the gccwrapper does not only work with gcc (the name compiler-wrapper might have been a better choice).

I would use the autoconf-detected binaries for the compiler/linker there.  But the idea of this ticket certainly gets a +1 from me.

`SPKG.txt` needs to get updated... ;-)

IMHO also the ticket's description;  there are at least two rather orthogonal problems the compiler wrapper is supposed to fix:

1. Clashes between system and Sage's libraries.

2. Relocation issues, i.e., "dead" (hard-coded) `RPATH`s in binaries (shared libraries and executables) created by Sage, upon moving the installation (which includes installing a pre-built / binary distribution).

3. (Even more unrelated to both of the above:)  Broken compiler versions / tool chains;  work around by messing with (e.g.) optimization flags, depending on the present compiler and its known issues.

It's nice to be able to test some crazy combination and having the possibility to do so by setting one or two envvars rather than hacking into the code.

And SAGE_INSTALL_GCC will not treflect what it does anymore.

You have to build the wrapper at the very beginning of the build process to be sure to avoid issues on Cygwin.

I've attached a patch to fix a little typo and take care of PATH as well, feel free to integrate it upstream.

Thanks.

In fact we also need to patch the Sage repo to define SAGE_ORIG_PATH there IIRC.
Unfortunately I don't have access to the disk where I developped this part right now.
The patch should be up later today.

I've gitified the ticket without making it a standard package (basically, Volker's hg patch).
I think should definitely make it optional at least.

And I give positive review to what Volker done, except for maybe not making the package standard, at least now...

I think its good to have it as an optional/experimental package, let's see if it turns out to be useful.

The SPKG.txt is incorrect in that the upstream repo is git now, but that is trivial.

I don't think its the final answer to our LD_LIBRARY_PATH / relocation woes, I'm working with the hashdist developers on a bullet-proof solution.

Is it? I actually had a look to check if you updated the code but did not even notice it was not bitbucket anymore... or just ended up on the old bitbucket repo, who knows.

Sure, but at least it lets Sage build (quite) easily on platforms where PATH/LD_LIBRARY_PATH will always be a mess like Windows.
