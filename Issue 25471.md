# Issue 25471: Rename SBox methods for difference_distribution_matrix and similar to _table

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25708

Original creator: asante

Original creation time: 2018-06-29 16:31:45

CC:  ruhm

Keywords: sbox, ddt/lat/bct, days94

The `SBox` class defines three methods (`difference_distribution_matrix`, `linear_approximation_matrix` and `boomerang_connectivity_matrix`) that are typically called `..._table` in the literature.

IMO we should adjust these names (and correctly deprecate the old names, of course).

Hi Friedrich,

You forgot to apply similar changes for `autocorrelation_matrix`.

Hi Friedrich,

So far looks good to me. There is only one thing left. The documentation of  `crypto/mq/sr.py` mentioned `difference_distribution_matrix`. I think that too needs to be replaced.

Setting to positive review, as Rusydi was fine with it and I only fixed the merge conflict.
