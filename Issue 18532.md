# Issue 18532: Implement affinization crystal and allow KyotoPathModel to use extended weight lattice

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: tscrim

Original creation time: 2015-06-22 22:51:01

Assignee: sage-combinat

Keywords: crystals

Currently the Kyoto path model only uses KR crystals, and as such, does not allow for the extended weight lattice to be used. This ticket will implement the affinization crystal of KR crystals and use them to construct the Kyoto path model.

Turns out the Kyoto path model was not computing its weight correctly as it was not adding in the contribution from the remaining highest weight crystal not appearing in its representation.

I found some typos, failed documentation builds, and failed doctests.  These have all been fixed and now tests pass and documentation looks good.  More to the point, the weight function seems to have the desired behavior and the affinization crystal looks good.  

One comment:  the weight function in `kyoto_path_model` was displaying the affine weight in a weird way.  For example, one output was `-delta + Lambda[0]` when one would usually expect `Lambda[0] - delta`.  I fixed the doctests so they pass, but I did not attempt to change the display of the weight so that it would come out (for example) as `Lambda[0] - delta`.  If this still bothers anyone, then it will have to be fixed.  

...Otherwise, it looks good to me.  Any other comments?

Best,
Ben

I thought I ran the doctests and they passed...makes me slightly worried that the output of the weight is machine dependent. I will test again on my machine (once it's done recompiling the version bump). I have no comments otherwise and up to the check, I'd be happy setting a positive review. Anne, do you have any comments?

I get `Lambda[0] - delta` and the sorting of the keys doesn't raise an error. So they should be sorted, and I don't see why there would be a machine dependency (even more so since it looks likes the key for `Lambda[0]` is a python `int` and according to python specs, it falls back to comparison of the types).

Why do you call it an "Affinization crystal"? Shouldn't it be the affinization *of* a crystal?

We could change `AffinizationCrystal` --> `AffinizationOfCrystal`.  What do you think?

I think that would be better. Also, in the documentation there are a couple of places where it would be good to make such a change!

I made that change and I think all places in the documentation that needed it. I also change the output of the one doctest back (I am curious as to why Ben is getting a different output for those ones in particular).

Hmmm... I just ran the test again (with the latest develop branch) and I'm still getting `-delta + Lambda[0]` instead of `Lambda[0] - delta`.  Ideas?

I get the same as Ben

Hmm...That is completely strange, but it seems to be something related to using OSX (the patchbot agreed with the doctest). You don't get the same failure when testing the other crystal files, right? What's your output for the following:

```
sage: cmp(int(0), 'delta')
-1
sage: cmp('delta', int(0))
1
sage: cmp('delta', 0)
1
```


I also fixed another error from the name change (I missed one).

Hi Travis,

Here is my output (which is different from yours):


```
sage: cmp(int(0), 'delta')
-1
sage: cmp('delta', int(0))
1
sage: cmp('delta', 0)
-1
```

Okay, so here's the difference (and why this test is failing):

```
sage: B = crystals.KirillovReshetikhin(['A',2,1], 1,1)
sage: P = RootSystem(['A',2,1]).weight_lattice(extended=True)
sage: C = crystals.KyotoPathModel(B, P.fundamental_weight(0))
sage: x = C.module_generators[0].f_string([0,1,2])
sage: [type(_) for _ in x.weight().support()]
[<type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>, <type 'str'>]

sage: B = crystals.LSPaths(['A',1,1],[1,0])
sage: b = B.highest_weight_vector()
sage: [type(_) for _ in b.f(0).weight().support()]
[<type 'int'>, <type 'int'>, <type 'str'>]
```

Looking into why the type suddenly changes (which I think is an easier fix and better for consistency at this point, although perhaps on some ticket we should make it so that the comparison between a Sage integer and a `str` works the same as an `int` and a `str`).

Okay, so the issue is that we are creating `fundamental_weight(0)`, where `0` is a Sage integer, which is then cached. So I'm reworking the doctests to call `fundamental_weights` for consistency. Since this is not an issue in terms of usage, just print representations, I'm just suppressing this minor machine dependency/inconsistency.

There we are. Now everyone should get the same answers.

I get the same answers, doctests pass, documentation builds (including PDF), and the math looks correct.  Thanks, Travis!
