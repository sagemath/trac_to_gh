Keywords: crystals

Currently the Kyoto path model only uses KR crystals, and as such, does not allow for the extended weight lattice to be used. This ticket will implement the affinization crystal of KR crystals and use them to construct the Kyoto path model.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18769

Turns out the Kyoto path model was not computing its weight correctly as it was not adding in the contribution from the remaining highest weight crystal not appearing in its representation.

I found some typos, failed documentation builds, and failed doctests.  These have all been fixed and now tests pass and documentation looks good.  More to the point, the weight function seems to have the desired behavior and the affinization crystal looks good.  

One comment:  the weight function in `kyoto_path_model` was displaying the affine weight in a weird way.  For example, one output was `-delta + Lambda[0]` when one would usually expect `Lambda[0] - delta`.  I fixed the doctests so they pass, but I did not attempt to change the display of the weight so that it would come out (for example) as `Lambda[0] - delta`.  If this still bothers anyone, then it will have to be fixed.  

...Otherwise, it looks good to me.  Any other comments?

Best,
Ben

I think that would be better. Also, in the documentation there are a couple of places where it would be good to make such a change!
