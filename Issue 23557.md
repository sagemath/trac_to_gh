It really feels like we should have a default `__ne__` in `SageObject` because of all of these trivial `__ne__` methods... Anyways, LGTM.

I would argue that it's _Python_ which should handle this better. I think it's good that all individual rich comparison operators can be implemented independently, but it's annoying that Python doesn't do any obvious fallbacks like `__ne__ = not __eq__` or `__le__ = __eq__ or __lt__`.
