# Issue 24910: Add DESTDIR support for boost_cropped

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25147

Original creator: embray

Original creation time: 2018-04-11 15:40:11

Keywords: destdir boost

Doesn't touch the full `boost` package for now since it's only optional (granted, all the more reason it should be uninstallable), but it's also a whole different beast that will require some more testing...

I believe this issue can reasonably be addressed for Sage 8.4.

Retargeting some of my tickets (somewhat optimistically for now).
