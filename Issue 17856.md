Hellooooooo Jeroen,

I know, I sit just behind you but this software is open, so let's keep the communication on this channel `:-P`

As I always try to make sentences "short and efficient", I removed some of the text, believing that what is already there is sufficient for our purposes. Is that okay with you?

Also, about the first sentence: when I began rephrasing some parts of the doc, Karl-Dieter opposed some of my changes by saying that the manual did not only need to be "short and efficient", but also welcoming to potential developpers. Soooooooo well. For this purpose, I believe that the way the first sentence was phrased (as a definition of 'deprecation') would be more helpful to them, just in case they would wonder whether a deprecation is some technical thing they should have heard about.

If you have something against the current phrasing, could we change the new text so that this becomes a 'definition' again?

My commit is at public/18093

Thanks,

Nathann
