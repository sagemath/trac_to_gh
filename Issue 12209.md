Looks good but there is a parenthesis missing in your doctest `:-)`

I confirm. Either of you can put a positive review once the ) is added, and it is confirmed (e.g. by the buildbot) that the test pass.

Done.  Once patchbot confirms tests pass then everything is good.

Ping! The patchbot does indeed confirm that tests pass, so are we done?

I think so, but I can't give my own patch a positive review....
