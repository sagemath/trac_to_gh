https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.05432 gives a construction of SRG(65, 32, 15, 16), which can be built as follows:

```
a=PermutationGroup([
 '(0)(1,17,2,18)(3,6,4,5)(7,31,8,32)(9,25,10,26)(11,14,12,13)(15,24,16,23)(19,22,20,21)(27,29,28,30)(33,35,34,36)(37,61,38,62)(39,55,40,56)(41,43,42,44)(45,53,46,54)(47,63,48,64)(49,52,50,51)(57,59,58,60)',
 '(0)(1,20,32,6,9,27,23,13,2,19,31,5,10,28,24,14)(3,8,22,18,11,15,29,25,4,7,21,17,12,16,30,26)(33,37,52,63,41,46,60,55,34,38,51,64,42,45,59,56)(35,39,58,53,44,47,49,62,36,40,57,54,43,48,50,61)'])
oe=[(0,1), (1,2), (1,6), (1,7), (1,9), (1,11), (1,14), (1,21), (1,24), (1,36), (1,38), (1,40), (1,42),
 (1,44), (1,47), (1,48), (1,50), (1,52), (1,54), (1,55), (1,56), (1,58), (1,62), (1,63), (1,64), (33,35),
 (33,38), (33,46), (33,47), (33,49), (33,51), (33,57), (33,61)]
ee=reduce(lambda x,y: x+y, map(lambda o: a.orbit(o,action='OnSets'), oe))
ggg=Graph(ee,format='list_of_edges')
ggg.is_strongly_regular(parameters=True)
# (65, 32, 15, 16)
```


we should add this construction.

yes, this doctest missed a fix, now added in comment:12. But I don't understand

because this can only happen if a test in lines 2966-8 of `src/sage/graphs/generators/smallgraphs.py`,
where this construction is added, also fails.

For me now `--long` tests pass (merged over 9.3.beta8), so I'm setting this to  positive review. Hopefully this will just work, and we don't need to dig deeper.

Note that `make graphs-clean && make graphs` fails to download the package and in particular it don't try to use the specified `upstream_url` (why ?).  So I downloaded it manually and then all tests pass.
