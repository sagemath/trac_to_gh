The Sun assembler chokes when large files are sent to it via a pipe.  Singular by default builds with the -pipe option causing trouble.

In the spkg below, I also add a fix for #12311.

**spkg**: [http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/singular-3-1-3-3.p5.spkg](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/singular-3-1-3-3.p5.spkg)

The change here makes sense, although I don't remember seeing a problem with singular on Solaris before. This builds on one OpenSolaris machine, and I'm currently building it on a (slow) Solaris machine. It also works on OS X (as tested in #12369).

Dave, can you take a look at this?

Jeroen, in case Dave doesn't have time, do you have suggestions about how to test this?  On the skynet machine mark, I can try setting the path so that it uses

```
export PATH=/usr/local/gcc-4.5.1/sparc-SunOS-ultrasparc3-sun-as-ld/bin:$PATH

```
with corresponding settings for `SAGE_FORTRAN` and `SAGE_FORTRAN_LIB`. Will that use the Sun assembler? (By the way, with the default PATH etc. on that machine, I have troubles building libpng...)

No, the assembler/linker executables are hardcoded when GCC is compiled.  You can see this by:

```
jdemeyer@mark:~$ gcc -print-prog-name=as
/usr/local/binutils-2.20.1/sparc-SunOS-ultrasparc3-gcc-4.4.3/bin/as
```
This means that gcc will always use that assembler, which is the GNU assembler:

```
jdemeyer@mark:~$ /usr/local/binutils-2.20.1/sparc-SunOS-ultrasparc3-gcc-4.4.3/bin/as --version
GNU assembler (GNU Binutils) 2.20.1.20100303
Copyright 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
This program is free software; you may redistribute it under the terms of
the GNU General Public License version 3 or later.
This program has absolutely no warranty.
This assembler was configured for a target of `sparc-sun-solaris2.10'.
```

I encountered the problem on this ticket while testing #12369.  The default `as` in the PATH is

```
jdemeyer@mark:~$ which as
/usr/ccs/bin/as
jdemeyer@mark:~$ as -V
as: Sun Compiler Common 10 Patch 05/06/2005
```

So, when compiling GCC, that assembler will be used by default.  This can be overridden using the `AS` environment variable (similarly `LD` for the linker).

The issues with mark seem to have cleared themselves up somehow. My findings:

- With hawk, the spkg here builds while the old one doesn't.

- With mark and mark2 (Solaris on sparc), both seem to build.

So I think this can get a positive review.
