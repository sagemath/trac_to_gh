sage: P = QQ^10
sage: t = type(P())
sage: t.__new__(t, P);
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* module has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off().
Python will now terminate.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

The main change is to initialize the `_entries` of the vector in the `cdef _init()` method. This ensures that `__new__` creates valid objects.

See #21658 for more context. This branch doesn't add doctests for `__new__`, since it will be tested by #21658.

Is there a reason why `_init` has an `int` return value? AFAICS, it doesn't return anything, which I guess defaults to 0? I feel we should be a bit more explicit and put a `return 0` if we do need a return value (I think we do to handle exceptions).

I get this question *every time* that I do this `cdef int ... except -1` trick. The return value is only for exception handling. Mentally, you should think that it returns `None` (that is also why I don't want to add `return 0`, that would be even more confusing).

Personally, I think that Cython should have a special data type for "an `int` used only for exception handling", like they already have `bint` for "an `int` used as boolean".  But they don't like the idea.
