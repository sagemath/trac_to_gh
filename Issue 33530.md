# Issue 33530: Inconsistent default argument between is_circular and is_circular_planar

Defaults argument are
- `is_planar(set_embedding=False)`
- `is_circular_planar(set_embedding=True)`

They ought to be the same (and `set_embedding=False` makes more sense).

I agree that setting the default to `False` would be better.

The hard question is : how do we proceed?

With a deprecation warning to indicate that the default value will change ?

But we don't want to raise a warning when `set_embedding=True` or `set_embedding=False` explicitely. One option is

```
def is_circular_planar(set_embedding=None):
    if set_embedding is None:
        deprecation_warning(33767, 'default will change from False to True')
        set_embedding = False
```

OK. From `True` to `False` might be better.
