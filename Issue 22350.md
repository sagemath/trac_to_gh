Since there have been a number of important updates to the Three.js template, it's time to update the existing examples. One of them has severe problems with transparency which is now corrected.

These examples are generated automatically so there's not much need to read the code. There are several very long data lines that should remain in place, mostly because they'll get overwritten every time the examples are updated again. This ticket just needs someone to build the documentation in `reference/plot3d` and verify that the examples render.

I'd really like to get this into 7.6 so that the public documentation is corrected.
