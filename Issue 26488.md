Hooray! Let's get this into 8.5 -- for the last 3 months I have had to use a customized Sage since I needed features and many bugfixes which 2.11.0 lacked.

Not really "needs review" because it's only a pre-release.

John: it would still be good if you test this to see whether this fixes the problems that you were having.

I was planning to test this but have had a very busy week so only got as far as putting it on my to-do list, sorry.
