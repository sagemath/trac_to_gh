I get test errors in `matrix2.pyx`, line 6935 which calls scipy on these tasks:

```
A = matrix(RDF, [[1, -2], [3, 4]])
B = matrix(RDF, [[0, 7], [2, -3]])
D, P = A.eigenmatrix_left(B)
(P * A - D * P * B).norm() < 1e-14
```

(and a similar at line 7151 (for _right rather than _left).

And it's not just numerical noise:

```
sage: (P * A - D * P * B).norm()
12.951156314021555
sage: P * A - D * P * B
[ 1.1102230246251565e-16     -12.951156314021551]
[-2.7755575615628914e-17 -3.1086244689504383e-15]
```

the 1st of two gen. eigenvectors is wrong.

```
sage: A.eigenvectors_left(B)
[(-2.1075759441619084, [(-0.9905315991237724, 0.1372849268394109)], 1),
 (-0.3922809560592623, [(-0.9668186179746967, 0.2554638133620835)], 1)]
```

vs. the previous version (1.8.1), correct one:

```
sage: A.eigenvectors_left(B)
[(1.8208523846306908, [(-0.5400711566794881, -0.8416193591659354)], 1),
 (-0.39228095605926194, [(-0.9668186179746967, 0.2554638133620835)], 1)]
```


This can be traced down to scipy call:

```
sage:         v, eig = scipy.linalg.eig(A.numpy(),
....:                                   B.numpy(),
....:                                   right=False, left=True,
....:                                   homogeneous_eigvals=False)
sage: v
array([-2.10757594+0.j, -0.39228096+0.j])
sage: eig
array([[-0.9905316 , -1.        ],
       [ 0.13728493,  0.26423138]])
```

vs, correct, previous version:

```
sage: v
array([ 1.82085238+0.j, -0.39228096+0.j])
sage: eig
array([[-0.54007116, -1.        ],
       [-0.84161936,  0.26423138]])
```

I can reproduce this with "plain" scipy on Gentoo (installed as system Gentoo package)


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2022-10-31 10:46:23

This is !Gentoo/Sage-specific. If instead of system- (or Sage-)built scipy I use binary wheels from pypi, everything is fine.

The next test will be to try building Sage's scipy on a non-Gentoo system.

Comment by dimpase created at 2022-10-31 11:57:16

cc-ing Gentoo people. On Gentoo-built scipy 1.9.3, one gets incorrect generalised eigenvectors.


```

Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import scipy, numpy

>>> B=numpy.array([[ 0.,  7.],[ 2., -3.]])
>>> scipy.linalg.eig(A,B,right=False, left=True, homogeneous_eigvals=False)
(array([-2.10757594+0.j, -0.39228096+0.j]), array([[-0.9905316 , -1.        ],
       [ 0.13728493,  0.26423138]]))
```

instead of correct

```
(array([ 1.82085238+0.j, -0.39228096+0.j]), array([[-0.54007116, -1.        ],
       [-0.84161936,  0.26423138]]))
```


pip-installing binary wheels for numpy ans scipy from PyPI (same versions) produces correct results.

On Fedora 34, everything is fine (with openblas 0.3.19, not sure whether it matters)


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2022-10-31 13:53:23

Building Sage's OpenBLAS (Gentoo provides an older OpenBLAS, 0.3.20) appears to fix the problem.
Should we ban 0.3.20 ? Anyhow, Gentoo has to fix it.

upgrading to pip 22.3 does not help

on intel macOS 13 with Homebrew, I get meson complaining about perfectly OK `gfortran`.

------

update - in fact, Apple's command line tools didn't update themselves, and that was the reason for this error. Sorry for noise.

On OS X M2, `scipy` fails some tests in its test suite, but installation succeeds anyway, not sure why.

Test suite passes on OS X Intel.

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2022-11-22 23:07:52

One of them may be https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/16926


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2022-11-22 23:10:09

I would prefer that a failing test suite meant a failed installation, but maybe `python3 -c 'import scipy; scipy.test()'` doesn't return a nonzero code if it fails.


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2022-11-22 23:11:27

I agree, we should fix this.


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2022-11-22 23:18:01

Maybe we should merge this now and patch things up in follow-up tickets, since I (for one) can't build the most recent beta without this. Are there other issues that should be addressed on this ticket?


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2022-11-22 23:18:45

(I took a quick glance at the `scipy` code, and it looks like it's trying to return different exit codes. It was only a very quick glance, though.)

There is a problem on `archlinux-standard` related to scipy; that is unchanged by this upgrade. That's #34779


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2022-11-23 07:34:28

The other Linux platforms look fine.
