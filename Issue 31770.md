Keywords: gsoc2021 posets boolean-lattice lattice

The elements for `posets.BooleanLattice(n)` are given labels `0, ..., (2^n)-1` but this does not provide information about the elements as subsets. C.f. #28261

I made some changes to the implementation to use more Python objects (so faster) and not going through the Cartesian product to drastically reduce the number of edges being built:

```
sage: X = Subsets(10)                                                                                                
sage: X.cardinality()
1024
sage: cartesian_product([X,X]).cardinality()
1048576
```

This implementation is essentially the same implementation as using the integers (which I cleaned up slightly by avoiding redundant information).

If my changes are good, then positive review.
