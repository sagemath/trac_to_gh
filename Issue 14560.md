# Issue 14560: Let Mathematica free integration work with definite integrals

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14764

Original creator: kcrisman

Assignee: burcin

See [this ask.sagemath question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/2706/how-to-use-algorithmmathematica-free-to-calculate).  Apparently

```
sage: integrate(x^2,x,algorithm='mathematica_free')
1/3*x^3
sage: integrate(x^2,x,0,1,algorithm='mathematica_free')
1/3*x^3
```

so that would be useful to fix.  Since it currently returns an indefinite integral when we ask for a definite one, I'll classify this as a defect.

This seems fixed in recent Sage versions. IN 9.2.beta0:

```
sage: integrate(x^2,x,0,1,algorithm='mathematica_free')
1/3
sage: integrate(sin(x),x,0,pi,algorithm='mathematica_free')
2
sage: integrate(sqrt(x),x,0,1,algorithm='mathematica_free')
2/3
sage: integrate(sqrt(x),x)
2/3*x^(3/2)
```

Needs doctest if these aren't already tested (which they may be).

Replying to [comment:6 kcrisman]:

Right. Putting this to `needs_work`.

Added relevant doctests to src/sage/symbolics/integratin/external.py, which pass for me.

Aaaarghhh!!! Sphinx is exceedingly prone to punctuation errors.

I'm on it.

I think it was fixed in #25501
