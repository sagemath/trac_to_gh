See [this ask.sagemath question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/2706/how-to-use-algorithmmathematica-free-to-calculate).  Apparently

```
sage: integrate(x^2,x,algorithm='mathematica_free')
1/3*x^3
sage: integrate(x^2,x,0,1,algorithm='mathematica_free')
1/3*x^3
```

so that would be useful to fix.  Since it currently returns an indefinite integral when we ask for a definite one, I'll classify this as a defect.
