# Issue 17777: is_ribbon on skew tableaux and skew partitions don't really check for ribbonness

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18014

Keywords: ribbon, partition, skew partition, tableau, sage-combinat, days64

Being a ribbon means not just containing no 2x2 squares; it also means being connected.


```
sage: SkewPartition([[3,1],[2]])
[3, 1] / [2]
sage: _.is_ribbon()
True
```

OK, the method *is* used, in the `to_ribbon` method. That's a method which takes a skew tableau, checks if it is ribbon-shaped (incorrectly), and if so, transforms it into a `RibbonShapedTableau`, which is a class in `sage/combinat/ribbon_shaped_tableau.py`.

We can fix this, of course. But I am wondering if we really need `sage/combinat/ribbon_shaped_tableau.py`. There is very little functionality in that file, and apart from the iterator for standard ribbon shaped tableaux (which is easy -- they corresponds to permutations in a given descent class), it can be easily reimplemented in the general tableaux class. I don't think `sage/combinat/ribbon_shaped_tableau.py` is used anywhere...

I think it's used in the LLT polynomials, but IDK offhand.
