Keywords: GraphicsArray, Graphics, matplotlib

Because it isn't, one cannot, for example, overlay `text()` onto a `GraphicsArray()`, or use any of the other `Graphics()` functionality.

`GraphicsArray._repr()` could (but doesn't) return a matplotlib `Figure`, so perhaps this can be resolved with the help of #5128.

See the post at asksage about [this issue](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/308/can-i-convert-a-graphicsarray-object-to-a-graphics) for more details.

It would be cool if we could incorporate the graphics_array functionality into a Graphics object using matplotlib's gridspec to do the layout.  Recently, some new capabilities for drawing arrays of
graphics have been added (in matplotlib 1.0.0).  Here are some links to

The code proposed in #27866 addresses some of the issues discussed here. In particular, it allows for the overlay of `text()` onto a `GraphicsArray`, via the new method `GraphicsArray.inset()`. The output is no longer a `GraphicsArray` but pertains to the more general class `MultiGraphics`.
