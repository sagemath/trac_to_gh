... hence, provisioning the build environment for each package from the stored wheels. 

Fallback will be to `--no-build-isolation --no-deps`.

Why does `tomli` require `no-build-isolation`? Also, a comment like "Our new default" is going to become dated. Maybe "The default as of Sage 9.7" instead?

To clarify, build with isolation is the default in `pip`, right? So it makes sense for us to switch to this, except in cases where necessary. If that's correct, feel free to set to "positive review" on my behalf.

(Sage builds, including lots of optional packages, with this branch.)

Yes, it's the default in pip.
