Why does `tomli` require `no-build-isolation`? Also, a comment like "Our new default" is going to become dated. Maybe "The default as of Sage 9.7" instead?

To clarify, build with isolation is the default in `pip`, right? So it makes sense for us to switch to this, except in cases where necessary. If that's correct, feel free to set to "positive review" on my behalf.
