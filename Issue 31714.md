Keywords: ellipsis, multiline, repl

Using ellipsis syntax `[a .. b]` or `(a .. b)`
interferes with multiline block continuation
in Sage REPL input.

For reference, after entering the first two lines
below and hitting enter, the prompt is extended
with an (auto-indented) third line, as expected:

```
sage: for n in range(4):
....:     m = 2*n
....:
```

and the input is evaluated only once the user
either manually unindents (e.g. with ctrl-A ctrl-K)
and hits enter, or hits enter twice.

By contrast, in all cases below, hitting enter
at the end of the second line evaluates the code
typed so far, preventing to type a third line:

```
sage: for n in (1 .. 3):
....:     m = 2*n
sage: for n in [0 .. 3]:
....:     m = 2*n
sage: for n in range(4):
....:     m = (2*n .. 3*n)
sage: for n in range(4):
....:     m = [2*n .. 3*n]
```

Further problems, not really serious, but it shows problems that one can run into:

The problem is that one needs to cleanup the syntax in `input_transformers_cleanup` instead of

I made a few stylistic fixes. Feel free to revert any part if you think irrelevant.

The patch works well, looks good. 
One comment on the `syntax_only` argument: It is not clear what *Sage's special syntax* the argument is for. What is the criterion? Isn't this `R.0 -> R.gen(0)` Sage's special syntax?

`R.0` is fixed as well.

There is correct python syntax. Then ipython has some special syntax, like `%time`.
Then sage has some special syntax.

I would say that special syntax is anything, that gives a `SyntaxError` without modification. So replacing `2` by `Integer(2)` is not special syntax.
Replacing `2^3` by `2**3` is also not special syntax (and we need really to avoid doing it twice).

I don't know what is a better name for it, but this is really what the bug boils down to:

`IPython.input_transformer_manager.check_complete` checks the syntax as well, which means it must have access to all our special syntax rules.

As I understands it, your code does (added) Sage syntax preparsing down in "token level"(`input_transformer_manager` level) keeping out problematic transforms indicated by `syntax_only`, and then does Sage syntax preparing second time after "token level". Am I right? 

Then wouldn't it be more safe and efficient to do the transforms (ellipsis and generators) that are necessary to kill the bug in the token level and leave the other transforms after that?

You are right. It would be better to cleanly seperate those two steps.

However, I can't figure it out. It's such a mess...

We could also clean this all up and do it more ipython style instead of string replacment.

This would simplify a lot of things. E.g. the tokens treat multiline strings as one line, without further interaction. They also treat implicit and explicit line continuation almost the same.

In this case I would try to replace the `preparse` function in the interactive shell and then as a last step replace preparse by the appropriate steps in ipython, so that loading a file `*.sage` is really the same thing as parsing it all in sage.

The major changes are the following:

- Instead of worrying about `quote_state`, we require that all the lines are given at once into `preparse_multiple_lines`.
- We add `preparse_multiple_lines` to `cleanup_transformers`.
- We remove `preparse` from `input_transformers_post`.
- The following are now handled via token transformers instead:
  - Backslash division `B \ C`.
  - Generator construction `K.<a> = QuadraticField(2)`.
  - Calculus like function assigment `f(x) = (x + 1)`.

We add a couple of deprecations.

Thing is that almost all our changes affect the syntax and need to be done before `input_transformers_post`. We could do all of them just in `cleanup_transformers`, but that makes it difficult resolving things like #30953.

I made some commits based on your latest work.

My main concern with your work was that it introduced some nontrivial regressions regarding `.sage` files (not working `time` and `load/attach` in file, for instance) by deprecating old `preparse` stuffs. My commits recover regressions.

It works well for me. I am positive on your work. But I think the patch still needs extensive tests.

I have no idea what this is used for or who uses it. It should definitely undergo questions in sage-devel, whether this can be deprecated or whether this needs to be adapted.

`time` is working in `.sage`. What isn't working anymore is automagic. But automagic isn't meant for multiline things and thus is really a strange concept for files. Line- and cell-magic should be working just fine. (Cell-magic is also a bit strange, as it cannot be exited.) Line-magic wasn't working before in `.sage`-files.

But yes, this is a regression.

Fixing #30953 seperate from this ticket, will not work without extra work, as the following doctest already assumes that ipythons preparse detected the implicit line continuation:


```
        sage: preparse("a \\ b \\") # There is really only one backslash here, it is just being escaped.
        'a  * BackslashOperator() * b \\'
```


```
        sage: preparse('''

```


So, I would argue that it makes sense to introduce the following classes during this ticket:
- `SageBackslashTransformer`,
- `SageGenConstructionTransformer`,
- `SageCalculusTransformer`.

Sorry about the mess.

This is a much simpler fix. It just creates a second input manager that does Sage's preparsing to check correctness of Sage's syntax. It does not behave as desired with magics, e.g.

```
sage: ip = get_ipython()
sage: ip._check_complete_transformer.transform_cell("%time 8^^1")
"get_ipython().run_line_magic('time', 'Integer(8)^Integer(1)')\n"
```

which means it would preparse things after `%time` twice, but it's sole purpose is to check the correctness of syntax, for which it works just fine.

With the new approach I would like the following follow ups:
- close #4545 with a doctest
- have preparse and preparse_file call `ip.transform_cell`, which means the code will behave exactly as if parsed into the interactive shell (move the code from preparse to a helper function then)
- #30953: do generator construction and calculus like assignment with token transformation

It all depends on what we want. The branch `public/31951-new2` is a minimalistic fix to the reported bug. As far as I see, it does not have regressions. So I would propose closing the current ticket with this fix and provide a quick fix to users.

We can move the previous work to a new ticket (or new tickets). However, I realized that our approach does not work well with automagic, e.g.

`time 8^1` and `time 8^^1` should be equivalent to `%time 8^1` resp. `%time 8^^1`, but I did not accomplish this. Did you?

There are a number of phases that the transformation undergoes:

1. `get_ipython().input_transformer_manager.cleanup_transforms`: Things like cleaning the prompt as I suggested.
2. `get_ipython().input_transformer_manager.token_transformers`: Things like IPythons line magic.
3. `get_ipython().prefilter_manager`: Things like IPythons automagic.
4. `get_ipython().input_transformers_post`: Currently Sage's `preparse`.
5. `ip.ast_transformers` (Optional additional changes).

Anything that you enter undergoes all 5 steps. However, when checking whether multi-line input is complete, only the first two steps are checked. It makes sense to execute our preparser at step 4, so it works nicely with automagic. It should be executed at step 2 or later to work nicely with (non-auto) magic.

My latest solution to this ticket is to leave Sage's preparser at step 4, but overwrite `check_complete` with the method from a different input manager that applies Sage's preparser at step 1. Things will be modified before checking whether this is magic, but this should not bother us.

I quickly scanned your fixes and I think they make sense. When executing a file, it should behave exactly as when typed into the shell, so this could be done via `ipython_preparse` or similar (which calls `get_ipython().transform_cell()` (steps 1 and 2) and not `get_ipython().input_transformer_manager().transform()` (steps 1 to 4).

If you agree, you could put your branch on #30953 and we leave the minimalistic fix here. Because of the problems with automagic, I think sage's preparsing should stay at step 4 however (except for checking completeness).

No. I didn't know that. There is no other problem with our approach except this one.

I investigated this. The reason is that ipython applies `cleanup_transforms` **several** times to the input string for automagic. Hence `time 8^^1` becomes `time 8^1` and again `time 8**1`.

So the solution is to make this code

```
    # Use ^ for exponentiation and ^^ for xor
    # (A side effect is that **** becomes xor as well.)
    L = L.replace('^', '**').replace('****', '^')  
```

also to a token transformer(named perhaps `SageCaretTransformer` or `SageExponentiationTransformer`?).

With another token transformer, our approach(my branch containing your work) fixes all problems.

> If you agree, you could put your branch on #30953 and we leave the minimalistic fix here. Because of the problems with automagic, I think sage's preparsing should stay at step 4 however (except for checking completeness).

As I said above, we can provide one branch solving this ticket and #30953 (and #4545?). All these tickets are just different manifestations of a single problem. Then why separate the solution?

No, just making it idempotent is not enough.

Instead of trying to find a workaround for all these problems, we could just leave our preparsing at step 4 and just modify `check_complete`. Even the backslash transformation is probably best left for step 4.

Not working. The problem is that `8^^1` is preparsed twice. Automagic is hard to detect and depends in fact on whether a variable of a specific name is defined.

At the moment I really see two ways of doing it:
- Have an artificial input manager for `check_complete`.
- Do the preparsing in steps 1 and 2 except for single-lines, when we keep doing the preparsing at step 4.

`quote_state` needs not to be a global in `interpreter.py`.

The problem here is that automagic will still have the 3 token replacement. I'm not on your new branch, but you will see a failure similar to

```
sage: ls | grep \f
/bin/bash: -c: line 0: syntax error near unexpected token `('
/bin/bash: -c: line 0: `ls -F --color | grep * BackslashOperator() * f'
```


On develop this works just fine.

So the token replacements should not be applied in case of single lines, but then need to be added to `SagePreparseTransformer` again (to be applied to single lines). We could also remove the backslash token and put it back into `SagePreparseTransformer`, but this wouldn't fix the following:

Now:

```
sage: del maxima
sage: maxima f(x)=2

Before:

```
sage: del maxima
sage: maxima f(x)=2

If we do it like this then `preparse_calculus` and `preparse_generators` should be deprecated.

As a follow up ticket we could try to have magics in `preparse_file`, when it is preparsed within ipython.

```
-    L = ';%s;' % L.replace('\n', ';\n;')

+    counta = 0

+            countb += 1
+        elif L[i] == ']':
+            counta -= 1
+        elif L[i] == ')':
+            countb -= 1

I'll push changes, once I tested it (and we can always reset, if we don't like it).

`IPython` is surely imported whenever you parse something. Because the token transformer needs IPython.

Whenevern you run

`sage -c "print('hello')` or similar, this will call `preparse`, which imports whatever it needs to run. In our case we added the dependency to `IPython`.

Now the new fix just slightly modified the develop branch to obtain the same output, so I don't know why to use tokens, if a slight modification works just as well.

I think the slight increase of the startup time is acceptable. I cannot clearly explain the increase, but I guess this is caused by increasing time of parsing Sage startup scripts.

Otherwise I am positive with the new simpler fix.
