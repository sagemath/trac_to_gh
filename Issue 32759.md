Hm, maybe this should not be papered over in the doctest:


```
$ gp -q
? L = lfuncreate(x^2 - 2);
? lfun(L,0)
0
```

sage converts 0 to floating point before passing it to pari:

```
> gp -q
? L = lfuncreate(x^2 - 2);
? lfun(L,0)
0
? lfun(L,0.0)
  *** lfun: Warning: normalizing a series with 0 leading term.
0
```

The warning is gone in pari/gp git HEAD. Of course we can keep the `...` to support pari-2.13.3 from the system.
