I can definitely attest to the Python prereq!

Do Debian and Redhat not require you to install Python, e.g. is it already on the system by default?  If so this looks good, except I can't attest to the redhat perl necessity so someone should.

Every modern distro installs Python by default; E.g. a number of the system administration tools on !Redhat/Fedora/Centos are written in Python. OSX includes it by default, too. The perl-ExtUtils-MakeMaker thing is true.

Always has, I guess, but not all OSX has a _recent enough_ Python for this prereq.

I believe it!  I just can't review it, if that makes sense?  I'll leave that to someone with access to redhat.

I guess the documentation won't be updated, then

You think no one else might have access?  I just feel a little uncomfortable giving an okay since I don't have any Linux access at _all_.  I know that might seem picky.   Jeroen?

I'm not a Debian or Redhat user either (I use Gentoo).

However, I'm willing to give Volker the benefit of the doubt that those commands do what they need to do. The patch adds "Python 2.6" as general dependency, which is a good thing. Finally, as Volker likes to remind us, "perfect is the enemy of the good".

True dat.  But at least you use Linux ;-)
