Keywords: cartesian_product

`GF(5) x GF(5)` does not know that the multiplication is commutative!

```
sage: GF(5).cartesian_product(GF(5)).category()
Join of Category of rings and
  Category of Cartesian products of distributive magmas and additive magmas and
  Category of finite monoids and
  Category of Cartesian products of monoids and
  Category of Cartesian products of commutative additive groups and
  Category of Cartesian products of finite enumerated sets
sage: GF(5).cartesian_product(GF(5)) in Magmas().Commutative()
False
```

It would be reasonable to expect that the category is `Category of Cartesian products of rings`.

One thing is still strange: `CartesianProducts` and `Finite` does not seem to commute... (consequence: I had to duplicate some `extra_super_categories`).

As discussed with Nicolas the huge list of categories is only a presentation problem. The fix for 

```
sage: GF(5).cartesian_product(GF(5)) in Magmas().Commutative()
False
```

should be much shorter. There is no need to implement empty `CartesianProducts` classes inside categories.
