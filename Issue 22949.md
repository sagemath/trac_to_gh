Keywords: sd86.5

Currently, this fails

```
sage: QQ.coerce_map_from(ZZ).is_surjective()
NotImplementedError
```


To fix this, we could change this on the category level by telling a morphism of rings whose domain is `ZZ` that it is surjective iff its codomain is `ZZ` or `Zmod`.

You should never, ever give information about specific objects at the category level.

However, you can impart this information in the `Z_to_Q` morphism class.

Why not do that at the category level?

Because to do something at the category level, you should be doing something for all objects in that category, not for one specific object (in a specific implementation). Now, if you wanted to have something in `Rings` checking if a morphism to `ZZ` was surjective returning `True`, then that would be good because it is true for all rings (of characteristic 0). Although `map` has a concrete implementation of `is_surjective`, which is a technical detail that would need to be worked around (which that method probably should be lifted to the category of set morphisms).

The fix LGTM.
