Keywords: py3, graph

Done in this ticket:
- add parameter `sort` to `blocks_and_cut_vertices`. The default algorithm, `Tarjan_Boost` don't sort vertices in each block or the list of cut_vertices. The new parameter `sort` is set to `False` by default.
  An alternative is to simply remove the sortings...

- PEP8 cleaning up to method `blocks_and_cuts_tree`.
