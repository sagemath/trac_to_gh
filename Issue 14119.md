Why wait for rc0 to fix this? We know the problem and we know the fix.

Imagine we don't fix this before sage-5.9.rc0. The problem on this ticket is causing random strange failures, so for every multiprocessing-related problem that people report, we would need to check whether this ticket fixes it.

And the fix is at #14039.

I'll be happy to tell every one of them that this is their own fault for not reviewing #14039. 

Maybe David can tell us how long it'll take...
