In my opinion, the original tanslation (first attachment) was too literal, and it is important that the translation sounds Spanish (I'm a native Spanish speaker, I'm from Argentina)

Here is my new versiÃ³n (by mistake I've uploaded an old one)

Please close this ticket and merge it with #10165
(ignore the uploaded files, I'll upload a patch to #10165 when I've finished reviewing Luis V. 
translation with all the files in the tutorial).

Although this never was actually closed, just for clarification this should _not_ be closed since #10165 is still more of a metaticket.

This has been included in #10165 and probably could be closed now.
