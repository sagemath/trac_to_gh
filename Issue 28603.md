This definitely fixes the issue with #28789. Let's see what happens with doctests...

I have been using this version in sage-on-gentoo since mid-july without any doctesting issue. I am putting this on positive review but feel free to change it if you do spot a problem.

The only doctest failures I got were `src/sage/rings/padics/padic_lattice_element.py` and appear to relate to #23505, which is weird because that ticket is closed.

That's weird, we need more details. Can you post the failure you get?

Oh hmm, I'm getting these same failures on a clean build of 9.0beta7 also. So I'll let the positive review stand, but someone should revisit #23505 (or maybe #26576).
