# Issue 19212: If a `Poset` `is_lattice`, then how do I make it into a `LatticePoset`?

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19449

What the title says, essentially. Not only is there no clear way to do this, but I don't even see a tricky way to do this. The input structure for `LatticePoset` is weird, and not in a good way.

Youuuuuuu type `LatticePoset(your_poset)`?...

Wow, so it works. Thank you.

I have no idea why this didn't work earlier on my work computer. Maybe it's an issue that just got fixed (my work machine has beta0, here at home I've just built beta1). Maybe I was just half asleep and called `LatticePoset` of the hyperplane arrangement instead of its intersection lattice. Anyway, sorry for the spam!

It is worth mentioning that in current version `if is_lattice(P): L=LatticePoset(P)` will compute meets and joins twice. So if you need speed, you should do `try: L=LatticePoset(P) except: . . .`.
