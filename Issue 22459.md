If we want all doctests to pass with `SAGE_DEBUG=yes`, we need to disable debug messages from `cysignals`.

Note that not yet all doctests in Sage actually pass with `SAGE_DEBUG=yes`, but most do.

Are you aware of any others that aren't passing?  Last I tried, I think all were working except those affected by this issue.  Unless there are different issues related to cysignals in debug mode that I hadn't encountered yet due to this issue.
