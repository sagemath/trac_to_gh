Keywords: lattice polytope

The lattice automorphism group forgets its point labels if the polytope is not full-dimensional.


```
sage: from sage.geometry.polyhedron.ppl_lattice_polytope import LatticePolytope_PPL
sage: lp = LatticePolytope_PPL((1,0,0),(0,1,0),(-1,-1,0))
sage: lp.lattice_automorphism_group(point_labels=(0,1,2))
Permutation Group with generators [(), ((0,1),(1,0)), ((-1,-1),(0,1)), ((-1,-1),(0,1),(1,0)), ((-1,-1),(1,0),(0,1)), ((-1,-1),(1,0))]
