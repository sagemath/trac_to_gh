I've made the swap. This caused doctests to fail in `AbstractLinearCode.zeta_function` since it relied on the order of x and y, so I modified that implementation so doc-tests pass again.

I've also removed a special `weight_enumerator()` from GRS codes: this was **already** removed in #21576, and I have no idea how it got back! Git blame didn't tell me anything useful.

Lastly, I've added some tests which demonstrate that the special `weight_distribution()` for GRS codes and Golay codes actually correspond to that returned by the generic algorithm. These tests were sorely missing before.
