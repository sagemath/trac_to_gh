CC:  @fchapoton stefan @wdjoyner

This bug has been noticed by Frederic in #15285 :

```
sage: IncidenceStructure([0,1,2],[[0,1],[0,2],[1,2]]*15).is_block_design()
(True, [1, 3, 2, 15])
sage: IncidenceStructure([0,1,2],[[0,1],[0,2],[1,2]]*15).parameters()     
(2, 3, 2, 15)
```

Turns out that the code of `is_block_design` was rather unclear, and rather... Costly. Here is a simpler, faster and more correct version in which the bug in solved.

Before: 

```
sage: D = IncidenceStructure(range(44),designs.steiner_quadruple_system(44))
sage: time D.is_block_design()                                              
CPU times: user 99.26 s, sys: 0.06 s, total: 99.32 s
Wall time: 99.40 s
(True, [3, 44, 4, 1])
```

After:

```
sage: D = IncidenceStructure(range(44),designs.steiner_quadruple_system(44))
sage: time D.is_block_design()                                              
CPU times: user 0.06 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.06 s
Wall time: 0.06 s
(True, [3, 44, 4, 1])
```

Secondly, `IncidenceStructure.parameter` has a very tricky behaviour :

```
sage: D = IncidenceStructure(range(44),designs.steiner_quadruple_system(44))
sage: D.is_block_design()                                                   
(True, [3, 44, 4, 1])
sage: D.parameters()                                                        
(2, 44, 4, 21)
```

This is because `parameters()` take `t` as a parameter, and sets it to `2` by default. That's.... surprising `:-P`

This patch adds a deprecation warning when this parameter is not set, and we will make it mandatory... in a while.

Here it is !

Hello,

Nice job !

Do you still need to use `self.blocks()` instead of `self.blcks` ? You have replaced some of them, but there remains one.

Looks good to me.

One last detail : there lacks a space after "2" in "2is used when none is provided"

Then you can set a positive review.
