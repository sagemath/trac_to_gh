# Issue 7731: knoboo --> codenode optional spkg transition

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/7731

Right now an old knoboo spkg is available here:

    http://sagemath.org/packages/optional/

It would be much better obviously if the knoboo package were deleted and a new codenode was available here.
