# Issue 24733: py3: fix sage.tests.cmdline

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24970

To be clear, as noted in the commit message, this doesn't mean all of this module passes on Python 3 yet since some of the individual tests can fail.  It just fixes running the the subprocesses (and fixes _most_ of the tests in this module as a result).
