Hellooooooo !!!

> I have the following issues when installing the patch with 5.0.beta14

Argggggg !! Of course, I forgot to add 12872 as a dependency !

> Also, the file ``distances_all_pairs.pxd`` is not part of this patch.
-_-

And of course I removed beta13 and installed beta14 since. Well, at least this file is short. It happened once to me when I rewrote the whole GLPK backend. I sent the patch without adding the file to mercurial, and I deleted the branch. 

Patch updated ! `:-)`

I'm now able to install the patch and all tests pass.

I have a warning in docbuild:

```

```


Also, in sage/graphs/pq_trees.py, you could put '**Authors**'.

Last, I have corrected the dependencies ;-)

Sorry about that.

In function is_comparability, you have:

```
    EXAMPLE:: 
```

I suppose you can remove one :


In function is_permutation, you have:

```
        ...          break

    Then with MILP::

    Trying random permutations, first with the greedy algorithm::

        sage: from sage.graphs.comparability import is_permutation
```

Removing "Trying random permutations, first with the greedy algorithm::" solves the docbuild problem.

Apparently, indentation can also be improved in many places in the file, but I don't know how critical are the spaces before the ``sage: blah`` in examples and tests.

The documentation is now build without warnings and is well displayed.
However, I found some typos.

In comparability.pyx
* "incmparable" -> "incomparable"
* "paralell" -> "parallel"
* "thee two edges" -> "the two edges" or "these two edges"
* "tranitive" -> "transitive"
* "i.e" -> "i.e."
* "cocomparability" -> "co-comparability"   (x2)
* In the documentation, the sentence "But the Bull graph is" appears without ":" at the end, but the sentence "The 5-cycle or the Petersen Graph are not transitively orientable:" has. This is certainly due to white space between "But the Bull graph is" and "::" in the source code.
* "Beware, for this implementation is unable to return negative certificates" -> "Beware, this implementation is unable to return negative certificates !"
* "returned indeed create the expected" -> "returned indeed creates the expected" ?


Some methods have examples but no tests. Are examples handled as tests when applying tests to the module ?


In graph.py
* lines 2500 - 2502 could be put in 80 cols
* line 2514 - ... : why are your using lists that are later converted to sets? shouldn't you directly use sets ?
