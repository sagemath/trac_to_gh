Could you please tell me which buildbot this is? I am asking because I have never seen this error before and I want to make sure that doctesting didn't actually become slower.

Obviously, the patch makes sense, but it's strange that this error suddenly appears.

I've seen it once so far. I don't remember which buildbot but one of the UW machines. I think there were a lot of background jobs running.
