perhaps, it should have a caveat emptor about ports, firewalls, and give a link to ssh docs (say, to https://www.ssh.com/ssh/tunneling/example). Something like

```
Note that we assume that a firewall which might be present between
server and client allows connections on port 8888. See details on port forwarding 
on the Internet, e.g. https://www.ssh.com/ssh/tunneling/example
```

Thanks for the suggestion. I have added it. As this was a minimal change, I will set this ticket back to positive.
