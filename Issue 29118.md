CC:  @dimpase @jhpalmieri @kiwifb @orlitzky @vbraun

This directory contains executables needed during building sage-the-distribution only. It should only be added to `PATH` by `sage-build-env` (see #29052 for `sage-build-env-config`).

This will require changes to some scripts in `src/bin`:

```
src/bin/sage-pkg

Anyway, I have:


```
sage: import os                                                                 
sage: os.environ['SAGE_NUM_THREADS']                                            
'1'
sage: os.environ['SAGE_NUM_THREADS_PARALLEL']                                   
'8'
```


positive review!
