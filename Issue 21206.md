Keywords: maxima

As reported on both [Ask](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/34723/error-with-solve-on-mac-os-x-10116/) and [sage-support](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-support/FDticzVa0ro), the precompiled binaries for Mac OS X are encountering errors when calling Maxima with `solve()`.

The solution for the Ask user was to install the Command Line Tools and delete the hidden `/.sage` directory, but this should not be necessary for precompiled binaries.

The same error appears to have [occurred](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-support/wj4ObDhv_xE) a couple years ago and was fixed by #17375.
