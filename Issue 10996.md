# Issue 10996: Ideal with no generators for univariate polynomial rings

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/11139

Original creator: mraum

Consider the following (Sage 4.7alpha1) :

```
sage: P.<a> = QQ[]
sage: P.ideal([])
Booom!
```


The issue is twofold: The ideal method in rings/rings.py is called and does not accept an empty list. But also the univariate polynomial rings should call a specialized method just like the multivariate ones do.

I make this a block, as it worked in earlier versions (like 4.2 or so) and is a construction that easily comes up as a corner case.

The patch attached solves the issue, but it is a patch created in 30 seconds. I am sorry that I currently don't have time to deal with this.

I'm happy with this.  Here's a new patch with a few doctests illustrating that the problem has been fixed.

I'm going to mark this as "needs review"; it wouldn't hurt to have someone else look it over.

What do you think of this alternative patch?  IMHO, it has better logic.

I think that indeed the logic is much better. Though it might be confusing to beginners. But this improvement brings my attention to a problem, that has been there before:

```
R.<x> = QQ[]
R.ideal((x for _ in range(2)))
```


This is an instance of GeneratorType, that is called with len.  So either we exclude the GeneratorType (no change to the situtation before) or correct it.  Also, mind that a ring element might be an instance of GeneratorType.  In that (very exceptional) situation, the new logic would cause trouble.

Any experience with similar code at other places in Sage?

Replying to [comment:4 mraum]:

I would say _not_ to check for `GeneratorType`.  I have added a new patch for this.  I still have to test it thoroughly.

Alternative patch, apply only this

Patch tested, all tests passed.

Changing priority from blocker to critical.

Any reviewers?

I think, since I haven't written this ultimate patch, I am a legitimate reviewer. All tests pass and also the patch bot does not complain. Although we have changed the logic, backward compatibility is preserved.
