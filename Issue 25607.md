Keywords: remove, package, pycrypto

In short: pycrypto is no longer maintained, but also no longer used in Sage.

We should stop shipping it.

If needed, pycryptodome could serve as a replacement.

More detail below.

In this [sage-packaging discussion](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-packaging/rynI5UjHFqs/discussion), FranÃ§ois Bissey, who maintains
Sage-on-Gentoo, reports that

> pycrypto is dead upstream and contains unfixed security bugs.

and considers removing it for Gentoo.

Antonio Rojas, who packages Sage for Arch Linux, says it was already
removed from Arch Linux:

The [latest pycrypto on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pycrypto/#history)
is release 2.6.1 from 17 Oct 2013.

+1 I don't think we should even provide a replacement.  There shouldn't be packages in Sage-the-distribution that aren't even used by Sage, directly or indirectly.

It's an optional dependency, and I think we're actually removing openid from sagenb as well, since it no longer works on Python 3.

If it wasn't used in sage in the first place and just stuff in `build` is modified, it shouldn't make a difference to packagers either way. We (at least I and pretty sure the others too) don't use anything from `build/pkgs`.

That doesn't mean I have anything against including this in 8.3, just clarifying.

Well in Gentoo python-openid doesn't depend on it. May be it is an optional runtime dependency?
In any case I am all for removing it now. Shaves a few bytes from the release tarball, smaller build/pkg folder what's not to love :)

Yeah I agree. In nix the `python-openid` package wasn't accepted into the main tree anyways. It is only used as a dependency for sage(nb), since it has the same problem `pycrypto` has (unmaintained, known problems).
