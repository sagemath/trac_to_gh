Wish I understood John's problem immediately I would have made a single ticket. Can you try this John?

Wrong John. I think John Cremona had a problem with pkg-config and Justin Walker had a problem with Python.

Sorry, what was I thinking. Yes but that's the second ticket I open in a few hours to edit the same line. I could have had a ticket about getting the dependencies of `brial` right in one go.

Testing this becomes much easier with #19101. I did

```
make distclean
./sage -i brial
```

and it worked!

True, that was me.  I cannot test on the same machine since Iinstalled the appropriate package system-wide, but I have a similar one and will test there.
