In [this ask.sagemath question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/943/in-sage-plot-fill-the-area-under-a-curve-between), the issue is raised whether

```
sage: f = x*(x-1)*(x-2)+1
sage: p = plot(f, 0.5, 1.5, fill=True) + plot(f, 0, 2)
```

should be doable in a single command, such as with a `fillxmin`/`fillxmax` keyword (or some better name).

This is great that you are working on this!  I don't see any obvious problems in the code, though I won't be able to look at it more carefully right now.  My first thought, though, is what happens with parametric plots?  Somehow their fill "magically" works right, and I'm wondering what the behavior might be with this keyword.

Look at the following interesting behavior.

```
sage: plot([x^3,x^2,x], xmin=0, xmax=4, fill={0:[1], 1:1, 2:1-x}, fillxmin=1, fillxmax=2)
```

It's definitely obeying the `fillxmax` but not in the way one might expect.

Similarly, I'm not sure that

```
sage: plot((cos(x),sin(x)), xmin=0, xmax=2*pi, parametric=True, fill=True, fillxmin=0.5)
```

is behaving as expected.

And I'm completely flummoxed as to why

```
sage: plot((cos(x),sin(x)), xmin=0, xmax=2*pi, parametric=True, fill=True, fillxmin=1)
<boom>
KeyError: 'text/plain'
```

due to the new display hook stuff!

One possible workaround would be to disallow the custom fill (for now) in parametric plots (i.e. raise an error) and make that a new ticket.  I do think that the first 'bad' example should be dealt with, though.

the problem is probably that the plot object is invalid (it can't actually show a plot). Because there is insufficient validation this only causes issues later when you actually try to plot it.
