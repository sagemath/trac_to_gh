Thanks for the review. The dockets pass, the issue with the `g` is that I often start typing "git" before the os has fully switch from the editor to the console. I should definitely be more careful, but they are tricky to catch as I have run all tests before I use git.

I'll try and implement the biplane now, otherwise I will end up forgetting.

in any event, it makes sense to implement https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruck%E2%80%93Ryser%E2%80%93Chowla_theorem
to rule out sets of parameters for symmetric BIBDs - so far it is only done in Sage for

If I interpret the pyflakes report correctly, it complains about ".block_design.BlockDesign imported but unused".
That's wrong as `BlockDesign` is used at line 227. However, I think we could (and should) use `BalancedIncompleteBlockDesign` there.

I fixed the pycodestyle errors, but I personally believe that code (especially the 10 lines of if ... else if ...) looked better before.
