Keywords: CartanType relabel

Currently, relabelled Cartan types lack some methods such as cartan_matrix():


```
sage: A3r = A3.relabel({1:2,2:3,3:1})
sage: A3 = CartanType("A3")          
sage: A3.cartan_matrix()             
[ 2 -1  0]
[-1  2 -1]
[ 0 -1  2]
sage: A3r = A3.relabel({1:2,2:3,3:1})
sage: A3r.cartan_matrix()            
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)

/space/ga98mup/sage-5.4-linux-64bit-ubuntu_12.04.1_lts-x86_64-Linux/<ipython console> in <module>()

AttributeError: 'CartanType' object has no attribute 'cartan_matrix'
```


This should be solved by adequate calls to CartanType._abstract._add_abstract_superclass().
