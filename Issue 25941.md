While cleaning the linbox interface at #24544 we encountered some issues with an innocent type change. The sage-linbox interface is  using `LinBox::DenseVector<Givaro::Modular<unsigned int>>` while it would be more natural to deal with `LinBox::DenseVector<Givaro::Modular<int64_t>>`. Though some strange compilation failures were present on macOS X, see discussion from the discussion at #24544.
