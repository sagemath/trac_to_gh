The installation script for the optional package GAP3 is broken. According to `@`​jdemeyer, this happened in #20692, the "cd src" should NOT have been removed:


```
diff --git a/build/pkgs/gap3/spkg-install b/build/pkgs/gap3/spkg-install
index a91ab6f..cf76e22 100755
--- a/build/pkgs/gap3/spkg-install
+++ b/build/pkgs/gap3/spkg-install
@@ -17,20 +17,6 @@ echo "GAP3_DIR = $GAP3_DIR"
  echo "INSTALL_DIR = $INSTALL_DIR"
