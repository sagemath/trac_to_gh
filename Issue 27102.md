DiGraph.edges() fail for some examples because it try to sort but does not successed.
For example:

sage: g = DiGraph([(0,1,0),(0,1,'a')], multiedges=True)
sage: g.edges()

raise an errors.
I suggest to remove the default value sort=True for this method to avoid this problem.

The problem is everywhere (I have edited the ticket description accordingly) and I'm surprised it has not been detected by any doctest...

It could be a side effect of recent changes in the coercion / richcmp model ?

I'm ccing many people because it seems a serious issue.

Yes, this looks like it is from #22029, which makes the behavior in Sage closer to that of Python3. So this is bringing more to the front the Python3 issues with graphs.

Not many doctests mix types like that. The few ones that do apparently don't call `vertices()` or `edges()`.

Sorry, but I don't see why this ticket is duplicate of #22349. For me we have a new bug with python2. It's independent of the will to stop sorting vertices/edges.

We changed many many doctests for py3, certainly hiding the issue.

But now `.vertices()` and `.edges()` in Python2 don't...

At least the example in this ticket is an `Integer` (which is not an `int`) and a `str` comparison.
