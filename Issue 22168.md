Since Python dictionaries print with spaces only after colons and not before, I think we should do the same. Please remove the spaces before colons.

I think you're going a bit too far in breaking lines. Keeping lines to about 80 characters isn't a strict limitation, it's just meant to make reading easier at the command line. You might want to revert a bunch of the line breaks you put in on the second commit.

One line I would definitely like reverted is this one:

`return np.array_equal(vert1, tpath.vertices) and np.array_equal(code1, tpath.codes)`

If you're working primarily on documentation, try not to alter the code outside of examples. That could lead to problems, and introducing new variable names (`b1` and `b2`, here) just to add line breaks makes the code less readable.

Documentation builds and looks good, doctests pass. If you're done reverting line breaks we can set this to positive review.
