```
FF = IntegerModRing(29)
tester = FF._tester()
list(tester.some_elements(CartesianProduct(FF, FF, FF)))
```

This should give a list of 3-arrays of elements of Z/29. Instead I get:

```
sage: FF = IntegerModRing(29)
sage: tester = FF._tester()
sage: list(tester.some_elements(CartesianProduct(FF, FF, FF)))

And 29 is the smallest number where this seems to throw this error; also, it doesn't fail if I only take the cartesian product of two copies of the field.

I get a similar error if I do `CartesianProduct(FF, FF).unrank(3)`, and this has been around for a while (not just since beta4):

ValueError: first letter of variable name must be a letter
```

So it seems that both bugs are due to the fancy `R[x]` syntax for polynomial rings conflicting with the `R[i]` syntax for the i-th element of an enumerated set `R`, and #8389 didn't cause the error, but at most exposed it better.

I think the bug is in unrank, not in the fact that rings use `__getitem__` in a funny way. The problem is that a Cartesian product can easily be constructed from iterables, and then should probably be iterable itself, but iterables are not necessarily indexable:

```
sage: V={1,2,3}
sage: CartesianProduct(V,V).unrank(2)
TypeError: 'set' object does not support indexing
sage: [i for i in CartesianProduct(V,V)]
[[1, 1], [1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 1], [2, 2], [2, 3], [3, 1], [3, 2], [3, 3]]
```

The function "unrank" should only be applied to indexable cartesian products, i.e., cartesian products of indexables. That's not the same as iterables. In particular,

So the problem is really in `tester.some_elements`. Indeed, the offending code:

```
        try:
            n = _len(S)
            if n > self._max_runs:
                from random import sample
                S = sample(S, self._max_runs)
        except (TypeError, AttributeError):
```

tries `sample` on `S`, which apparently leads to calls of the type `S[i]`. As you can see, the code is prepared to fail, but doesn't expect that to happen with a `ValueError`. I think this just shows that it's a bit callous to just try and index a structure and hope for the best.

Hmm. So Sets are not required to define getitem in a reasonable way? Good to know.

Comment by mmezzarobba created at 2014-03-12 12:07:35

Nicolas Thi√©ry suggested deprecating `R[n]` in favor of `R.unrank(n)` at least when `R` is a ring (see http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/8389#comment:13), and I tend to agree. If you don't, could you please leave a comment at #15885?

Comment by darij created at 2014-03-12 13:39:26

I agree too if we can do this quickly enough. This is causing problems in #10963...

Comment by nthiery created at 2014-03-13 12:47:45

The above branch takes a first step toward using more systematically the unrank protocol, in that case in `CartesianProduct`. This should improve the situation and could be deemed good enough for now, but is certainly not a final solution. Also, the unrank function I introduced might be too paranoid: it makes CartesianProduct.unrank work only with lists, tuples, Parents, xranges; there might be other inputs that are used around. All tests pass though (haven't tried long tests yet).

I agree with Nils though: the sampling in the TestSuite should not be using [i] to do unranking, and probably should just assume that the object is iterable, and not necessarily unrankable. I'll have a look unless someone beats me to it.

The third alternative, explored by Darij in his branch, is to reinstate temporarily the notation FF[i] for unranking for IntegerModRing and friends.

What do you think?

Hey Nicolas,

I've expanded upon what `unrank` can accept (all iterables, even if not in enumerated sets, should now work). I agree the sampling should not use `[i]` to do unranking, but should we push that to another ticket?

Not a review, just a tiny remark: the colon before the doctest in `cartesian_product.py` should be doubled.

Hi Travis!

Thanks for the improvement! I made one further step, in particular to
avoid trapping too many exceptions; typical situation: a parent L that implements
unranking as L[i] and raises an "out of bound" value error.

I am still unhappy about the `unrank(ZZ,i)` returning something completely wrong (Integer Ring). In case a parent is iterable, I wonder if I would not prefer to prefer the Iterable strategy, and only use `__getitem__` if everything else has failed.

Cheers,
                                        Nicolas

+1. Let's focus here on what's needed for #10963.

Ah shoot, the sampling issue actually occurs with #10963.

At this point I am tempted to remove the sampling altogether in
InstanceTester.some_elements, and instead have it always return a list
(or iterator?) of the first max_run elements (or less if `S` does not
have that many). Then, the only requirement on `S` would be to be
iterable.

The code would then just be:

```
    def some_elements(self, S=None):
        if S is None:
            if self._elements is None:
                S = self._instance.some_elements()
            else:
                S = self._elements
        import itertools
        return list(itertools.islice(S,0,self._max_runs))
```


I am now running the tests with #10963 and this change.

Cheers,
                                     Nicolas

With just this change (and not the rest of the stuff in this branch), #10963 passes all tests.

At this point, I am tempted to split this ticket into two tickets:
- One about fixing TestSuite/InstanceTester.some_elements to not use indexed access (sufficient for #10963)
- One toward using the unrank protocol more systematically (in that case in CartesianProduct)

What do you think?

Comment by tscrim created at 2014-04-26 05:11:17

(Much) More of me says this change to `InstanceTester.some_elements()` is significantly better (and might even be faster for things that are hard to repeatably iterate over like crystals) than loosing the possibility that (over enough repeated tests) we get "most" elements of a very large finite set (and without calculating `__len__()`, which also might be expensive or error catching). So I'm saying let's make this change, the question is where. I'd be happy doing it right here.

I'd say the problem with `ZZ` is that it is not in the correct category, which is now #16239. I've also made some very minor doctweaks, so I'm pos_rev with the current state (up to where to make the change above).

Best,

Travis

Ok, glad to see we are on the same line. I have created #16244 for
just this piece. I'll push my little change there later.

Ok, I am happy with your change. So I guess this can be positive reviewed. There remains to update the description of this ticket to better reflect what has actually been done, and refer to the other ticket for the actual solution of the original issue.

The only thing that somewhat worries me is the speed. Before:

```
sage: T = range(20)
sage: C = CartesianProduct(T,T,T)
sage: %timeit C.unrank(3)
100000 loops, best of 3: 15 ¬µs per loop
```

After:

```
sage: T = range(20)
sage: C = CartesianProduct(T,T,T)
sage: %timeit C.unrank(3)
10000 loops, best of 3: 35.5 ¬µs per loop
```

(These timings are fairly independent on the 20 and the 3...)

I don't know how often this unranking is used, though, and whether these ¬µs add up...

Ah good point; the `isinstance` and `in EnumeratedSets` checks cause a little
overhead which is non negligible for inputs that have super fast
unranking (like lists).

My impression is that this unranking is not used much. If it really
became a bottleneck, a reasonable fix would be to have
CartesianProduct build unranking functions once for all upon the first
unrank (I started toying with this in
u/nthiery/15919-unrank-unrank-from), so that the above checks would be
done only once.

Besides, things should eventually resolve by themselves as CartesianProduct gets
progressively replaced by cartesian_product (for which the inputs are
parents, or coerced into parents), and parents implement more
systematically the unrank protocol.

So altogether, in this balance between overhead and correctness, I
would lean here toward correctness. What do you think?


---

Comment by darij created at 2014-04-28 00:03:53

I am not suggesting to go against correctness! My original idea on this ticket was to de-prioritize the notation `R[x]` for a polynomial ring or a subalgebra generated by `x`, because that notation is really syntactic sugar. So it's speed vs. convenience. But looking at Travis's posts I am no longer sure if this would have fixed all issues. Anyway, since unrank and CartesianProduct aren't very much used together, this is not an issue.

> I am not suggesting to go against correctness!

Oops, sorry if my wording involuntarily implied this :-) I just meant
that I was ready paying a little speed overhead as a price for a
solution of the problem. And I agree the problem worked on this ticket
(being cleaner with unrank versus `__getitem__`) has deviated from the
original one. Not so bad since I believe this + #16244 fixes
reasonably the original problem.

Unless someone raises an objection now, this is good to go!

Thanks to both of you.
