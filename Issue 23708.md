Keywords: Weil polynomial, sd91

We are adding a function that tests whether a given polynomial is a Weil polynomial for a given prime power q, i.e., whether its complex roots all have absolute value `sqrt(q)`.

One easy way to do this would be to combine the "inverse reciprocal transform" from #23947 with the existing `all_roots_in_interval` method of polynomials (which wraps Pari's implementation of Sturm sequences).

I fixed the issue with the doctests. Also, I don't like redefining `self` within a method definition.

All tests now pass on k8s. Since I touched the code last, someone other than me should check my work and then set a positive review.
