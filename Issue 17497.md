# Issue 17497: RealNumber constructor from integer literal ignores rounding mode

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17734

Original creator: f.poloni

Original creation time: 2015-02-05 13:40:40

The RealNumber constructor does not respect the specified rounding mode when constructing from an integer literal:

```
sage: a = 1.5
sage: RealNumber(a, rnd='RNDU').parent()
Real Field with 53 bits of precision and rounding RNDU
sage: RealNumber(1.5, rnd='RNDU').parent()
Real Field with 53 bits of precision and rounding RNDU
sage: RealNumber(2, rnd='RNDU').parent()
Real Field with 53 bits of precision
```
