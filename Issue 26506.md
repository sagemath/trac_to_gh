# Issue 26506: cyclotomic_part should not include powers of x

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/26743

Original creator: kedlaya

Original creation time: 2018-11-22 15:40:42

Keywords: polynomials, cyclotomic part

The `cyclotomic_part` function that I introduced in #20263 needs a tweak:

```
sage: P.<x> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: f = x*(x-1)*(x+2)
sage: f.cyclotomic_part()
x^2-x
```

Namely, the factor of `x` should be removed.

That looks fine. As soon as you can verify that it builds and passes doctests, give it a positive review on my behalf.
