Assignee: Vincent Delecroix

CC:  sstarosta slabbe tmonteil

Keywords: word, factorial language, symbolic dynamics

1) Implement a data structure (similar to a tree with label on edges) for finite factorial language which extends the actual SuffixTrie and SuffixTree in sage/combinat/words/suffix_tree.py (a "RauzyCastle").

2.a) Use it in a static version for the implementation of finite factorial language

2.b) Use it in a dynamical version for the implementation of some lazy languages (square free, cube free, overlap free, finite defect, ...)

dependencies: #12224

Nice ticket!

Hi Sebastien,

> Nice ticket!

Thanks! It now needs work!

> Related to this, I want to add that I want to remove the class and the file `nfactor_enumerable_word` from Sage. Currently, only Finite Word class inherits from it. So it would be easy to fix by just moving the methods to the Finite Word class. I am sorry for having introduced this class into Sage : it was an error. This job must be done inside of the appropriate Language class... I still haven't created the ticket for it, but I definitively will.

I have some patch almost ready for it. It is just an update of suffix_trie into a prefix_suffix_trie. The data structure I used is perhaps not optimal (many dictionnaries that points toward other dictionnaries). It would be very nice to have a low-level implementation as the one used in Graph as well as a sparse and a dense version (certainly another ticket).

Before submitting a patch, I want to fix #12224 (Use Parent/Element and GradedEnumeratedSets for Language).

I have a questions for you : do we remove suffix_trie and use this new class instead ? (I made some timings and it seems that mine is twice slower, which is not so good or not so bad) Anyway, if yes, it is for another ticket.

Indeed...

Well, I would say not to delete it first. Just add a new implementation beside it. And, for some time, one could choose the algorithm or implementation. Later, we could delete the initial implementation.
