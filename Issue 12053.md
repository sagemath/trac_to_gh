# Issue 12053: Finite and some lazy factorial language

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/12225

Original creator: vdelecroix

Original creation time: 2011-12-23 10:50:39

Assignee: Vincent Delecroix

CC:  sstarosta slabbe tmonteil

Keywords: word, factorial language, symbolic dynamics

1) Implement a data structure (similar to a tree with label on edges) for finite factorial language which extends the actual SuffixTrie and SuffixTree in sage/combinat/words/suffix_tree.py (a "RauzyCastle").

2.a) Use it in a static version for the implementation of finite factorial language

2.b) Use it in a dynamical version for the implementation of some lazy languages (square free, cube free, overlap free, finite defect, ...)

dependencies: #12224

Nice ticket!

Related to this, I want to add that I want to remove the class and the file `nfactor_enumerable_word` from Sage. Currently, only Finite Word class inherits from it. So it would be easy to fix by just moving the methods to the Finite Word class. I am sorry for having introduced this class into Sage : it was an error. This job must be done inside of the appropriate Language class... I still haven't created the ticket for it, but I definitively will.

Hi Sebastien,

> Nice ticket!

Thanks! It now needs work!

I have some patch almost ready for it. It is just an update of suffix_trie into a prefix_suffix_trie. The data structure I used is perhaps not optimal (many dictionnaries that points toward other dictionnaries). It would be very nice to have a low-level implementation as the one used in Graph as well as a sparse and a dense version (certainly another ticket).

Before submitting a patch, I want to fix #12224 (Use Parent/Element and GradedEnumeratedSets for Language).

I have a questions for you : do we remove suffix_trie and use this new class instead ? (I made some timings and it seems that mine is twice slower, which is not so good or not so bad) Anyway, if yes, it is for another ticket.

Indeed...

The data structure I used is perhaps not optimal (many dictionnaries that points toward other dictionnaries). It would be very nice to have a low-level implementation as the one used in Graph as well as a sparse and a dense version (certainly another ticket).

I once rewrote the code of suffix_tree and was able to improve timing (something like 40%) just by choosing better data structures (dict instead of list or vice versa). My patches does not apply anymore because of conflicts but it is here : http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/slabbe/patches/ (starts with suffix_something). I did not push it any further, because I wanted instead to rewrite suffix tree code in cython, which we did for the suffix tree. But this construction is quadratic in the length of the (finite) word, and I want it to be linear. So, my next step was to implement the suffix_trie in cython, but I never did...

Well, I would say not to delete it first. Just add a new implementation beside it. And, for some time, one could choose the algorithm or implementation. Later, we could delete the initial implementation.


```
sage: w.factors(algorithm="first slow python implementation")
sage: w.factors(algorithm="cython implementation")
```
