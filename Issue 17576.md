To obtain help within git you do "git help CMD". If you do for example "git branch help" then it would create the branch help. This beahvior is very gitish.

One possible fix would be that by default, there is a confirmation step: "you are about to create a new ticket called XYZ on trac, please confirm [Yes/no].". This confirmation could be removed by adding something from the configuration files.

There are numerous duplicates, by construction of git. At least, with the latest version of git-trac, `git trac create -h` now shows help, rather than to create a ticket. So, I hope I will not accidentally create further tickets (no promise, though).

There are shorter command lines with worse effects, how about `sudo rm -rf /`

Fun fact: that actually doesn't delete your files. At least with current coreutils. As I found out while trying to intentionally destroy a VM for testing purposes ;-)

At least that command makes it harder to accidentally Trac tickets.
