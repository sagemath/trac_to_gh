Keywords: classical lie algebra to_vector

Reproducible bug explained by the following example:


```
sage: LM = lie_algebras.sp(QQ, 4, representation='matrix')
sage: e1, e2, f1, f2, h1, h2 = LM.gens()
sage: h1.to_vector()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

What I did was make the generic `to_vector` call `monomial_coefficients`. Now the `NotImplementedError` raise by `monomial_coefficients` is a more general safeguard when the dimension is not known to be finite. However, fixing that is a separate issue IMO.
