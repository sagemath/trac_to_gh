# Issue 10550: DisjointUnionEnumeratedSets should not always define Element and _element_constructor_

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/10603

Original creator: hivert

Original creation time: 2011-01-12 18:32:56

Assignee: sage-combinat

CC:  sage-combinat

Keywords: DisjointUnionEnumeratedSets Element

When the argument `facade` is set to `True` the attributes `Element` and `_element_constructor_` are defined by the class `DisjointUnionEnumeratedSets`. This is a bad idea because it prevents a super class like a category to define them. The following patch fixes this problem.

I leave the patch as needs work because there is some dependency on another non finished patch (#10193).
