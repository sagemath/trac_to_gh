Keywords: DisjointUnionEnumeratedSets Element

When the argument `facade` is set to `True` the attributes `Element` and `_element_constructor_` are defined by the class `DisjointUnionEnumeratedSets`. This is a bad idea because it prevents a super class like a category to define them. The following patch fixes this problem.
