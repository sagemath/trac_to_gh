The doctest, introduced in #25656 to check that sage can perform a particular integral with giac, can break depending on the version of giac used.

The integral is expressed as

```
integrate(exp(t)/(t + 1)^2, t, algorithm="giac")
```

With giac 1.7 the returned result is

```
(t*Ei(t + 1) + Ei(t + 1) - e^(t + 1))/(t*e + e)
```

and with giac 1.9 it is

```
((t + 1)*(1/(t + 1) - 1)*Ei(-(t + 1)*(1/(t + 1) - 1) + 1) - Ei(-(t + 1)*(1/(t + 1) - 1) + 1) + e^(-(t + 1)*(1/(t + 1) - 1) + 1))/((t + 1)*(1/(t + 1) - 1)*e - e)
```

Both answers are equivalent and applying `full_simplify` to both expressions gives

```
((t + 1)*Ei(t + 1) - e^(t + 1))/(t*e + e)
```
