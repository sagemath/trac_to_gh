CC:  @JohnCremona

Ticket #17792 implemented the solution for the word problem for congruence subgroups of (P)SL2(Z). However, the element represented by the output word sometimes differs from the original element by at most one generator.

Here is an example:

```
sage: G = Gamma0(10)
sage: F = G.farey_symbol()
sage: g = G([-701,-137,4600,899])
sage: word = F.word_problem(g, output = 'syllables')
sage: g1 = prod(F.generators()[i]**a for i,a in word)
sage: g == g1 or g * G([-1,0,0,-1]) == g1
False # Should be True
```


This ticket solves this. I have ran the code below to test:

```
for N in range(2,500):
    G = Gamma0(N)
    print "N = %s"%N
    gens = G.generators()
    F = G.farey_symbol()
    i = 0
    I = G([1,0,0,1])
    E = G([-1,0,0,-1])
    while i < 200:
        c = ZZ.random_element(1000)
        d = ZZ.random_element(1000)
        if gcd(c*N,d) > 1:
            continue
        i += 1
        _,a,b = xgcd(d,-c * N)
        g = G([a,b,c*N,d])
        wd = F.word_problem(g, output = 'syllables')
        g1 = prod(gens[j]**n for j,n in wd)
        assert g * g1**-1 ==  I or g * g1**-1 == E
```

(and also a modification to check Gamma_1(N).

In fact, this was not the exact problem. You are misplacing the ::

They should be as follows in your case.

TESTS:

some text here::

    sage: 2 + 2
    4
