Why have you removed this doctest?

```
-            sage: F = algebras.FreePreLie(QQ, ZZ)
-            sage: elts = F.some_elements()[:-1] # Skip the last element
-            sage: TestSuite(F).run(some_elements=elts) # long time
```

Having an infinite generating set looks like a reasonable use case to me. If the test suite fails for stupid reasons, then I'm still in favor of manually testing some computations with elements.

Other than this, LGTM with my little review commits.

that I would rather write
