Why have you removed this doctest?

```
-            sage: F = algebras.FreePreLie(QQ, ZZ)
-            sage: elts = F.some_elements()[:-1] # Skip the last element
-            sage: TestSuite(F).run(some_elements=elts) # long time
```
Having an infinite generating set looks like a reasonable use case to me. If the test suite fails for stupid reasons, then I'm still in favor of manually testing some computations with elements.

Other than this, LGTM with my little review commits.

that I would rather write

```

But one needs to check that the doc builds in either way..

I think you should make the variable names truly optional by setting a default value `names=None` in `__classcall_private__`. Subsequently, it does not make sense to have a non-`None` `self._alphabet`. I feel it mixes the two cases.

What about changing to use `normalize_names` and passing `names` to the `Parent.__init__` (CFM now handles them properly, so there should be no need to work around it)? In particular, doing something like

```
try:
