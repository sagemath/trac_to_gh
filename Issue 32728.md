That's not testing anything related to the ticket because I have not changed `.github/workflows/tox.yml`

OK, testing this now.

I wonder, by the way, whether it's possible to give docker images created meaningful names, and not these automatically assigned `romantic_chebyshev` etc.

The images are already tagged with names such as `sage-docker-centos-7-devtoolset-gcc_11-standard-with-targets`. Probably you mean containers. The ones created as a side effect of building the images in `tox` do not matter.
If you run one of the built images in a new container using `docker run -it sage-docker-centos-7-devtoolset-gcc_11-standard-with-targets:9.6.beta0-16-g9c8f6dbbb8-failed` or such, you can use an option `--name` to give a name to the container.

Well, they matter for debugging,say. And figuring this out by names might be a good idea.

No, these containers are dead. They have been committed to tagged images already. For debugging purposes, you run a new container from that image.

OK, it works
