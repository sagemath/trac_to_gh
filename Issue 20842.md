Harald, since I was unsure as to how ReST as implemented here handles relative links, I left links as absolute with the new subdomain. Hope this isn't too much to review at once, but it should take care of every old link in the repository.

This looks good to me. Although it touches many files, it's essentially just a very simple string replacement and code is only touched inside comments or strings.

Volker will reject this because of missing reviewer name.
