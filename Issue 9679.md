Keywords: vmware readme

This readme file has not kept up with the times.  Only a few changes are needed: the hard drive requirements are closer to 4.5GB than 2.5GB, and the Sage notebook can now be started by clicking an icon.  Also, we should change SAGE to Sage throughout.

I haven't read the whole readme, but can we shorten it a bit? Also, is there some info where to get help/support?
