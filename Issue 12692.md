# Issue 12692: Inaccurate description of 'sage -preparse'

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: itaibn

Original creation time: 2012-04-21 02:12:43

Assignee: mvngu

CC:  tscrim

Keywords: preparse

`sage -advanced` gives the following description for the option `-preparse`:

```
  -preparse <file.sage> -- preparse file.sage and produce corresponding file.sage.py
```

Testing this, preparsing a file `$file.sage` creates a file `$file.py`, not `$file.sage.py`. The documentation should be fixed to take this into account.

If you're going to fix the documentation, then you should also fix the file SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/doc/en/reference/options.rst.

Ticket #11821 is also related.

The doc is correct, the created file from "file.sage" is really "file.sage.py". This ticket can be closed.
