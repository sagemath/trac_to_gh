It is indeed not ready to review. Switching to French Julien. 

Il est vrai que changer le nom de fichier ne suffit pas. Mon commentaire a deux instructions:
* changer le nom
* executer le script "./sage -sh sage-fix-pkg-checksums" qui va recalculer les checksums d'apres les fichiers que tu as deja telecharge.

Renommer un tar.gz en tar.bz2 n'est pas une bonne idee, decompresser et recompresser ne donneras pas la meme checksum, si la version de bzip2 n'est pas completement identique le bzip2 serat legerement different.

I also had a look at the branch to see how the patches looked like : there is a strange chunk on src/doc/common/multidocs.py with a test on whether the sphinx version is less or above 1.2... which makes no sense if we're upgrading to 1.2.2!

So I would say : rebase the branch, fix the tarball issues (name, checksum), remove the chunk mentioned above, fix the doctests and it will be good to review and close!

PS: in fact, I may give git-trac a try and push a patch fixing the doctests this evening... if I manage to.

See http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16396#comment:8 but like I said we are not strongly attached to it.

For sagenb you can open a ticket on their github [https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb](https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb) and yes we'll need a new release.
