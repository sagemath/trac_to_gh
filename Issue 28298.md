# Issue 28298: Fundamental group of simplicial sets with trivial 1-skeleton

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28535

Usually, the fundamental group of a `SimplicialSet` is returned as a `FinitelyPresentedGroup`:


```
sage: T = simplicial_sets.Torus()
sage: T.fundamental_group()
Finitely presented group < e0, e1 | e0*e1^-1*e0^-1*e1 >
}}} 

However, for the case where there is no 1-skeleton, the trivial group is represented as a `GapGroup`:

{{{
sage: S2 = simplicial_sets.Sphere(2)
sage: S2.fundamental_group()
Group( <identity> of ... )
}}}

For consistency, it should also be a `FinitelyPresentedGroup`

Did you mean to delete the branch?

No. There should be an attached branch. The patch is just a one line change, plus the corresponding doctest.

Here is one minor change. If it's ready for review, I will give it a positive review.

Some tests fail in the patchbot, but they seem completely unrelated to the changes made in this branch. Maybe they are related to the fact that the patchbot uses python3?

I agree that those failures are unrelated to this ticket. We can ignore them.
