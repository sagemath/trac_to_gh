# Issue 29247: spkg-configure.m4 for linbox

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29484

Original creator: mjo

Original creation time: 2020-04-09 16:10:13

Opening this ticket now so that we don't forget to (attempt to) lower the bound on fflas-ffpack in its spkg-configure.m4. If we can accept an older system linbox that itself uses an older system fflas-ffpack, that would be nice.
