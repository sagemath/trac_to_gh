Ticket #27912 was resolved by adding the PackageManager package to the gap_packages spkg.  The PackageManager, by default, installs the packages in ~/.gap.  That is an excellent choice, at least for the purpose of the Sage_macOS app, since it does not require writing into the app bundle and thereby corrupting the code signature.  However, packages installed that was are only usable with libgap.eval().  Neither gap.load_package nor the gap_console() know to look for packages in that directory.  This is easily corrected by adding a -l option to the command used to start gap.  I will attach a patch.

Perhaps it would be better to use ~/.sage/gap in place of ~/.gap .  This would presumably require modifying the `PackageManager` package, however.
