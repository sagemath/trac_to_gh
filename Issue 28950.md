# Issue 28950: Mathematica hangs on multiline input

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29187

Original creator: @mwageringel

Original creation time: 2020-02-12 10:08:29

Keywords: mathematica

The following hangs indefinitely:

```
sage: %%mathematica
....: 1 + 2 +
....: 4
```

This format does not work either:

```
sage: %%mathematica
....: (1 + 2
....: + 4)
```

Moving tickets to milestone sage-9.2 based on a review of last modification date, branch status, and severity.

Moving this ticket to 9.4, as it seems unlikely that it will be merged in 9.3, which is in the release candidate stage
