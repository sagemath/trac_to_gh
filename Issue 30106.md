Oops, I rushed this out...
I think I'll remove #29886 from the dependency chain and update all tickets.
Once we decide on something for #29886, I'll make a quick patch.

With the latest commit (5367858) I changed all such error messages.
Now the above should read:

```
ValueError(("generalised octagons of order (q, q^2) "
            "are known only for q odd powers of 2"))
```

There should be no space before colons

This is a typography rule.

And importing something from sagenb does not look right, as sagenb is plain dead.
