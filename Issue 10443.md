Keywords: generic call map

The documentation of `sage.categories.map.Map.__call__` states:

```
- If ``x`` can be coerced into the domain of ``self``, then the 
  method ``_call_`` (single underscore) is called after
  coercion.
- Otherwise, it is tried to call the method ``pushout`` to ``x``
  (which may be provided in subclasses); in that way, ``self``
  could be applied to objects like ideals.
```


However, in the code, we had

```
            if not PY_TYPE_CHECK(x, Element):
                return self._call_(x)
            elif (<Element>x)._parent is not self._domain:
                try:
                    x = self._domain(x)
                except TypeError:
                    try:
                        return self.pushforward(x)
                    except (TypeError, NotImplementedError):
                        raise ...

```


Hence, there is a typo in the documentation (it is pushforward, not pushout):

1. If the argument is no element, one should expect that `pushforward` rather than `_call_` is called. This is a problem if the argument happens to be a sub-module. Sub-modules are no elements (this is incontrast to ideals). Hence, currently, module morphisms have to implement a custom `__call__` method.

2. In contrast to the statement of the documentation, the code is only about conversion, but not about coercion. I think this is a problem, as in the following example. There is no coercion from the abstract number field to the embedded number field, but no error is raised when calling the coerce embedding of the embedded field with an element of the abstract field:

```
  sage: K.<a>=NumberField(x^2-3,embedding=1)
  sage: L.<b>=NumberField(x^2-3)
  sage: K.has_coerce_map_from(L)
  False
  sage: K.coerce_embedding()(b)
  1.732050807568878? 
```


3. I was told that in the `_call_` (single underscore) and `_call_with_args` methods one can assume that the argument belongs to the domain of the map. This is, however, not the case, since an argument that is not an element (like a python int, for example!) will not be converted into the domain before passing it to `_call_`.

I propose the following:

* If `parent(x)` does not coerce into the map's domain, `pushforward` is called on `x` together with the additional arguments. If it is not implemented or produces a `TypeError`, proceed with the next step.
* Try to convert `x` into the domain; this is now either a coercion, or it is a back-up solution for the failing pushfoward. If the conversion fails, raise an error that mentions the pushforward method.
* Call `_call_` resp. `_call_with_args`.

There is a new doc test, demonstrating `_call_`, `_call_with_args` and `pushforward`. Apart from that, only small changes were needed in the doctests: Some error messages have changed.

I have no idea about the proper component. I hope "coercion" is fine.

I approve of the design and goals, but I'm worried about the implementation speed.  The current implementation does not introduce much overhead over `_call_`, but 

```
if not self._domain.has_coerce_map_from(parent_c(x)): 
    if hasattr(self,'pushforward'): 
```

are both pretty costly calls.  I think you need to add some fast pathways for common cases, such as `x` actually lying in the domain.

Similarly, use `PY_TYPE_CHECK` in cython files, rather than `isinstance`.

Replying to [comment:2 roed]:
> I think you need to add some fast pathways for common cases, such as `x` actually lying in the domain.

Right, I'll do so. Note that I use `parent_c` (copied from `sage.structure.parent`) in order to speed things up.

What common cases, apart from `parent_c(x) is self._domain`, do you have in mind?

> Similarly, use `PY_TYPE_CHECK` in cython files, rather than `isinstance`.

My patch introduces only one "isinstance", namely in the call method of `Set_Python_class`. The updated patch (hopefully being submitted in an hour or so) will use `PY_TYPE_CHECK` instead.

A propos: I was not aware of that Cython alternative to `is_instance`. Can you point me to a documentation of these and similar `PY_...` Cython functions?

I also found another way to speed the generic call method up: The current implementation does

```
if len(args) == 0 and len(kwds) == 0:
    return self._call_(x)
```

Using `timeit", I found that `if not(args) and not(kwds)` would be much faster:

```
sage: args=tuple(ZZ.random_element() for i in range(3))
sage: kwds=dict((i,ZZ.random_element()) for i in range(3))
sage: args0=()
sage: kwds0={}
sage: timeit("if len(args)==0 and len(kwds)==0: a=2")
625 loops, best of 3: 3.37 µs per loop
sage: timeit("if len(args0)==0 and len(kwds)==0: a=2")
625 loops, best of 3: 6.76 µs per loop
sage: timeit("if len(args0)==0 and len(kwds0)==0: a=2")
625 loops, best of 3: 7.21 µs per loop
sage: timeit("if not args and not kwds: a=2")
625 loops, best of 3: 129 ns per loop
sage: timeit("if not args0 and not kwds: a=2")
625 loops, best of 3: 275 ns per loop
sage: timeit("if not args0 and not kwds0: a=2")
625 loops, best of 3: 597 ns per loop
```


So, I'll change the patch accordingly.

I updated my patch. Here are some timings for different situations.

With the patch:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]; phi=R.hom([y,x])
# Element in domain
sage: timeit("a=phi(y)")
625 loops, best of 3: 32.3 µs per loop

sage: timeit("a=phi(D)")
625 loops, best of 3: 119 µs per loop
# use pushforward
sage: I = R*[x^2*y^4-2*y^2, 3*x*y-y^3]
sage: phi(I)

sage: timeit("a=phi(I)")
625 loops, best of 3: 164 µs per loop
```


The same examples without my patch:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]; phi=R.hom([y,x])
sage: timeit("a=phi(y)")
625 loops, best of 3: 32.3 µs per loop

625 loops, best of 3: 37.1 µs per loop
sage: D={(0, 2): -1, (0, 0): -1, (1, 1): 7, (2, 0): 1/3}

```


Hence:

* If the argument has the right parent, it is as quick as before.
* If the argument coerces into the domain, it is slower. That is no surprise, because "not doing coercion" is certainly faster than "doing coercion", but "not doing coercion" is a bug IMO.
* If the argument is not an element and is not dealt with by pushforward but converts into the domain, my patch fixes a bug (it is now added as doctest).
* Calling pushforward works a lot quicker with my patch.

So, I do think that overall it is a progress. I am now starting doctests, but I think it is ready for review again.

I think there is yet another way to speed things slightly up.

If there is coercion then there is a coerce map. Hence, rather than testing "self._domain.has_coerce_map_from(P)", one could directly request "caller=self._domain.coerce_map_from(P)", and then do "caller(x)" if it is not None. That should be faster than doing "self._domain(x)", because the call method of "self._domain" would request a coerce map as well!

I'll test a bit later. So, it will be "needs work" for two hours or so.

Here are the same tests again, with the updated patch:


```
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]; phi=R.hom([y,x])
sage: timeit("a=phi(y)")
625 loops, best of 3: 33 µs per loop
sage: timeit("a=phi(5)")
625 loops, best of 3: 39.2 µs per loop
sage: D={(0, 2): -1, (0, 0): -1, (1, 1): 7, (2, 0): 1/3}
sage: phi(D)
-x^2 + 7*x*y + 1/3*y^2 - 1
sage: timeit("a=phi(D)")
625 loops, best of 3: 121 µs per loop
sage: I = R*[x^2*y^4-2*y^2, 3*x*y-y^3]
sage: phi(I)
Ideal (x^4*y^2 - 2*x^2, -x^3 + 3*x*y) of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field
sage: timeit("a=phi(I)")
625 loops, best of 3: 163 µs per loop
```


I think that are acceptable timings: No significant slowdown, but a significant speedup in one case, and some bug fixes. Back to "needs review", modulo passing doctests...

Looks good in general.  I'm traveling today, but once I have a bit of time I'll take a look at your changes.

Looks good to me.  You asked about documentation for PY_TYPE_CHECK earlier; I'm not sure where to find documentation, but the functions are included in `sage/ext/stdsage.pxi` and you can find a list of them there.  The other files in that directory are also worth looking at, especially if you're dealing with python objects.

Anyway, positive review.
