It builds fine for me on Mac OS X.

An answer to an Ask [SageMath](SageMath) question here claims that qhull is included with scipy: http://ask.sagemath.org/question/10254/how-does-one-use-the-qhull-optional-package/

Also there is this ticket: #12352

Indeed

- http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.ConvexHull.html
- http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.Delaunay.html
- http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.Voronoi.html

But scipy does not seem to ship the binaries... But however their interface is pretty good and that's actually what we should use!

which is rather disjoint.

Right, for polymake (#20892) we do need the binaries.
Could you update the SPKG.txt to include info about scipy?

for info: got a reply from upstream (Brad Barber). The next version of the Makefile will contain the target dependencies and there will be a configurable `make install`. However, it seems hard to get a configure to work on all platforms...
