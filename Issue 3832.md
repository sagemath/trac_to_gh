# Issue 3832: [with spkg, needs review] add experimental Quantlib.spkg and Quantlib-SWIG.spkg to the repo

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Quantlib and its Swig bindings are available at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/release-cycles-3.1/alpha2/quantlib-0.9.6.spkg
http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/release-cycles-3.1/alpha2/quantlib-0.9.6-swig.spkg

Caution: Building the spkgs only works on Linux (and potentially Solaris), takes about 2 hours CPUTIME, 1.9+ GB disk space and about 2GB RAM. Not for the faint of heart. This also requires the experimental boost-1.34_1.spkg.

Cheers,

Michael
