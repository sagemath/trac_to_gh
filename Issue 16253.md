Yo !

You put cvxopt before gurobi in the ordering of LP solvers: this list is meant to be "use the fastest solver available installed on this computer". Is CVXOPT faster than Gurobi ?

Besides:

1) It is useless to put anything after a solver which is installed by default

2) PPL cannot really be a "default solver" as it misses the important feature of being able to solve integer linear programs.

This list for making the most suitable for the task solver the default. For the duration of a Sage session. E.g. it can be PPL, if you need to solve badly conditioned LPs with huge coefficients, or it can be CVXOPT, if you need an interior point solver as opposed to a simplex algorithm solver.

huh?

We have discussed this in April:
let me quote your email dated 22.04.14:

If CVXOPT is the second, and as it is available by default, then none of the others will ever become the default.

No, this list is a linear ordering that makes Sage's default the first solver that can be called and that appears in the list. If CVXOPT is the second, and as it is available by default, then none of the others will ever become the default. And unless you tell me that CVXOPT is faster than gurobi it should appear afterwards.

I don't see what you intend by quoting me against myself. Just read the code :


```
    if solver is None:

        if default_solver is not None:
            return default_solver

        else:
            for s in ["Cplex", "Cvxopt", "Gurobi", "Coin", "Glpk", "Ppl"]:
                try:
                    default_mip_solver(s)
                    return s
                except ValueError:
                    pass
```


If CPLEX is available, Cplex will be used. If CVXOPT is available, it will be used. And CVXOPT is always available, so none of the others LP will ever be used.

If you want to be able to make CVXOPT the default solver all you need is this part of your branch

```
    elif solver == "Cvxopt":
        try:
            from sage.numerical.backends.cvxopt_backend import CVXOPTBackend
            default_solver = solver
        except ImportError:
            raise ValueError("CVXOPT is not available. Please refer to the documentation to install it.")
```


Touching the list changes the "automatically defined" default solver of Sage. And as the code shows, by puting cvxopt second you may as well remove anything that appears after it. Similarly, it's useless to put anything after Glpk. In the current state the function will only test Cplex and CVXOPT.

```

here the problem is that the output does not match the doctest, as in the doctest the order of solvers is different : CVXOPT and Gurobi are swapped.

The best way to create a proper docstring is to run the command, in this case `default_mip_solver("Yeahhhhhhhhhhh")`, at the Sage prompt and then paste the output into the source.

) fixes all the problems, except this one (indeed, it doesn't even touch the cvxopt backend). Please look into it.

set_variable_type is cont. by default and cannot be changed. I fixed the doc for that. The solve method in the backend returns 0 if everything went ok and the solve in mip.pyx returns the actual value. Therefore this is  anormal behavior (see the ppl or glpk backends for further info) I also changed the doc for set_verbosity (does not apply for the cvxopt backend).

Regarding `solve()` in the backend returning 0, Nathann writes so much Sage code that he forgets what he wrote himself, e.g. in the GLPK backend... :-)

yeah, this line in the doctest

```
0: -7.3165e+00 -2.3038e+01  6e+00  0e+00  2e+00  1e+00
```

should be removed, as it is just output of the log of the convergence towards a solution, nothing important.
