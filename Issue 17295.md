Hello!

It appears that the convexity properties module gives incorrect results. The hull (geodetic) number of the Petersen graph is 4 while Sage says it is 3.


```
sage: G.convexity_properties().hull_number(value_only=false)
[4, 7, 8]
sage: G.convexity_properties().hull([4,7,8])
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```


I have implemented a corrected version of the hull number algorithm that I believe to be faster as well. I'd suggest we make these two function part of the graph class instead of having a separate convexity module.

What do you guys think?

Hello !

I don't get it: I look at Petersen's graph, I look at vertices 4,7,8, and to me their convex hull is the whole graph. If you want to convince me that the answer is not correct, you have to tell me which vertex among the 10 is not in the convex hull of 4,7,8.

Actually, here is how it works for me:

4,7,8 are in the convex hull of 4,7,8

3 is the only neighbor of 4,8, so it is inside
2 is the only neighbor of 7,3, so it is inside
5 is the only neighbor of 7,8, so it is inside
9 is the only neighbor of 4,7, so it is inside
6 is the only neighbor of 7,9, so it is inside
1 is the only neighbor of 2,6, so it is inside
0 is the only neighbor of 4,1, so it is inside

As a conclusion, the hull number of Petersen's graph cannot be 4 `:-P`

I have verified the result in 4ways

1. By implementing a different algorithm and getting 4 as an answer
2. By drawing the  solution given by sage and seeing that it does not give the whole graph
3. Arguing as follows. In the Petersen graph any pair of vertices is connected by a UNIQUE shortest path and has diameter 2. Hence 3 vertices give you a hull of size at most 3+ (3 \choose 2)*1 = 9
4. By checking this paper http://ajc.maths.uq.edu.au/pdf/26/ajc_v26_p011.pdf where it says that the Petersen graph has hull number 4.

Best,

Jernej

The paper you cite talks about the geodetic number, not the hull number. The computation that you do in 3 is only correct for the geodetic number. Thus I tend to think that the same reason explains 1 and 2 as well.

More seriously, in one case you take a set S, and add to it all points that are on a shortest uv-path, where u,v\in S.

In the second case, after having added those vertices you repeat the procedure again with the extended set S, then again, then again, then again, until you don't add anything new.

This second (larger) set is the convex hull of your initial set of points.
