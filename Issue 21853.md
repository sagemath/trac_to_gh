Gosper summation is a subset of summation, i.e., it can handle only hypergeometric expressions (or sums of such). If one wants to use it in `sum` then if `gosper_sum` can't solve it, we would call Maxima's sum. The known bugs using Maxima's sum:

```
sage: (1 / (n^2 + sqrt(5)*n - 1)).sum(n,0,m)
-1/3*(m^3*(3*sqrt(5) - 7) - 3*m^2*(sqrt(5) - 1) - 2*m*(3*sqrt(5) - 2) - 6)/(m^3*(sqrt(5) - 3) - 3*m^2*(sqrt(5) - 1) - m*(sqrt(5) + 3) - 2)
sage: ((n*(n+a+b)*a^n*b^n)/factorial(n+a)/factorial(n+b)).sum(n,1,m)
-(a^(m + 1)*b^(m + 1)*factorial(a + 1)*factorial(b + 1) - ((a^2 + a)*b^2 + (a^2 + a)*b)*factorial(a + m)*factorial(b + m))/(factorial(a + m)*factorial(a + 1)*factorial(b + m)*factorial(b + 1))
sage: F(n, k) = binomial(n,k) * factorial(n) / factorial(k) / factorial(a-k) / f
....: actorial(a+n)
sage: (F(n+1, k) - F(n, k)).sum(k,0,m)
-sum(-(binomial(n + 1, k)*factorial(a + n)*factorial(n + 1) - binomial(n, k)*factorial(a + n + 1)*factorial(n))/(factorial(a - k)*factorial(k)), k, 0, m)/(factorial(a + n + 1)*factorial(a + n))
```

The last is clearly not solved. The first two seem correct.

I do not claim to add new functionality with this, just the starting point for speed optimizations and for Wilf-Zeilberger, which WOULD be new functionality.

Done. Does that plugin also check the output of Sage itself?
