`sage.numerical.backends` depends on very little from Sage and should become a separate Cython package. This would make it easier to reconfigure it when new solvers are installed and eliminate some optional extensions from sagelib.

Details:
- `get_solver` uses base_ring
- GLPKBackend depends on `sage.libs.glpk`, which should also become a separate Cython package (see https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/GLPK/Python for a list of other glpk bindings)

Can you be more precise on your plans.

These backends are used in graphs. So what will happen if linear programming backends are in a separate package ?

In my plan, the backends would be a standard package of the sage distribution, and the cython modules it provides would be automatically imported when MixedIntegerLinearProgram is used.

for coin, there is a verssion mismatch. On pypi and in the ticket description the minor version is b9, in build/pkgs/ it is b10, the latest on github is b12 :-)

So I took b12 from github, renamed the tarfile (arrgh), bumped up the version,

Where are the tests from now gone `sage/numerical/backends/coin_backend.pyx` ?
Are they all being run while installing with `SAGE_CHECK=yes` ?

The macOS installer of Gurobi adds the following symlinks:

```
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  40 Apr 28  2016 /usr/local/bin/gurobi.env -> //Library/gurobi651/mac64/bin/gurobi.env
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  admin  39 Dec 24 12:11 /usr/local/bin/gurobi.sh -> //Library/gurobi900/mac64/bin/gurobi.sh
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  admin  39 Dec 24 12:11 /usr/local/bin/gurobi_cl -> //Library/gurobi900/mac64/bin/gurobi_cl
```


See https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage-numerical-backends-gurobi/blob/master/README.md (just updated) - 
I am using gurobi.sh to do all the build configuration. 
Does this work on Linux?

I see, on Linux it's not an installer but just a tgz.

There's a new version of the gurobi package now. I have done some testing on Linux now, but I could not do a full test with a Gurobi license because it does not like to generate license keys on a Docker container. I have revised thee installation instructions to include Linux:

Thanks a lot! I was briefly looking into this before I created the new packages, but was discouraged by various warnings on this page that seemed to imply one needs control of all packages sharing a namespace simultaneously. But I want the packages to work also with versions of sagelib that are already released.
Which of the three approaches mentioned on the page do you specifically recommend?

The tests are run when you install the new packages with `sage -i -c`.
