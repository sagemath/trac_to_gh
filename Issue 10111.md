As noted at #10111 and 

http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/6e8d6f28c915830d?hl=en

`random_prime()` is not well documented. 

But `random_prime()` is also broken for some erroneous input. Programs should always handle poor input properly, which is the case of Sage probably means generating an error message. 


```
sage: random_prime(0,True,-1) # Hangs
sage: random_prime(0,False,-1) # Hangs
sage: random_prime(1,0,-23) # Hangs
sage: random_prime(-12,0,-12) # Hangs
sage: random_prime(0, proof=False, lbound=-12) # Hangs
```


Having a negative lower bound can cause the function to hang, but this is not always the case, as the example below shows. Here an error message is generated. 


```
sage: random_prime(-12,0,-4)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)

/export/home/drkirkby/sage-4.6.alpha3/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/rings/arith.pyc in random_prime(n, proof, lbound)
   1144     n = ZZ(n)
   1145     if n < lbound:
-> 1146         raise ValueError, "n must be greater than lbound: %s"%(lbound)
   1147     elif n == 2:
   1148         return ZZ(n)

ValueError: n must be greater than lbound: -4
```

Mike, 
thank you for fixing this. I'll try this later today, but here's a few comments from reading the patch only - I've not tested it in Sage yet. 

Should the example on line 1127 be

`random_prime(200, proof=False, lbound=100) ` ? 

Currently it's the same as the previous example. 

One thing that would be nice is if you did like John did at #10105 and have doctests for the commands that currently hang Sage. Then if there are any regressions, and the bug(s) get back in, this will be detected. 

Perhaps I'll get bored of running my little script that supplies junk to commands to see what ones crash sage (like #10113) or hang Sage like this ticket, #10108 and #10105.

The patch deals with the cases listed.  But there are other cases which hang, like

```
sage: random_prime(8, lbound=8)

and some that almost do, like

```

They can be very easily dealt with.  The additional patch does this.

Those two patches are a definite improvement, so I'm giving it a positive review.

I've opened #10277 for another issue with `random_prime`

Sage's implementation is also incredibly slow compared to Mathematica. After 20 minutes of CPU time on a 3.33 GHz machine I was unable to generate one up to 10<sup>1000</sup> with Sage. Yet Mathematica can do that in 7 seconds!

Clearly looking at the code, fwclarke's change is correct, since the test before the error message is `if n < lbound`. Therefore n=lbound is permitted by the code, so the correct error message should be *n must be at least lbound*

If there is no agreement to merge the two patches here, I'll create one patch which just fixes the above 3 documentation problems and add that to #10111. Does that make sense?
