Two comments here:

- fixing the issues in the posted branch took a while because there are many `try - except` clauses in the doc-building which eat up all of the useful tracebacks.
- I think the remaining issues are just WARNINGS that breaks the docbuild because we decided at some point in the past to consider WARNINGS as errors (which is fine). I base this observation on some hacky modifications I did in the `src/sage_setup/docbuild/sphinxbuild.py`. To confirm this, do you know if there is a way to build sage documentation by considering warnings just as warnings?

Warnings one keeps getting are errors in processing function arguments, i.e. in introspecting Python code. Ignoring them would give you a broken doc.

I think the problems come from a new(ish) sphinx which is run as a backend for our custom docbuilder, and anyway the move from Python 3.6 to 3.7 was somewhat big as far as utf-8 support is concerned.

I really think that fully supporting 3.6 is hard, and we have better things to do. Python has solved this problem by moving to 3.7, let's not reinvent the wheel here.

There are 2 things I don't understand here:

- 4774 is an integer which is larger then the length of the string of the doc of `complete_primary_decomposition` method


```
sage: len(sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_ideal.MPolynomialIdeal_singular
....: _repr.complete_primary_decomposition.__doc__)                             
3284

With the current branch with no hacky changes, I can build the documentation with the flag `--keep-going`:


```
MAKE='make -j8' make build
MAKE='make -j8' ./sage --docbuild --no-pdf-links --keep-going all html
```


I am now trying to see what is wrong with the output doc...
