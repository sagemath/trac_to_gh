We're a bit behind the current release.  Here's an updated zeromq package (no changes, just update the src directory):  http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jason/zeromq-4.0.3.spkg

Hi,

i didn't see this ticket earlier, zeromq (and pyzmq) is now packaged with the new git layout, and updated to version 4.0.4, see #16455, so perhaps should we close this ticket as duplicate ?
