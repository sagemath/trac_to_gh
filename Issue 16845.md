Well, a couple things here. This passes all the long tests, and the functionality change seems ok.  However, there are two things that should be fixed.

- There is an indentation issue with the new example you added.

- you seems to restrict to number fields or ZZ. If it is ZZ the code changes the ring to QQ so that .lift() works. Why can't you do this for any number field ring (change to its field of fractions)?
