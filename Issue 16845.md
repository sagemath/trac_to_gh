Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17082

Original creator: jdefaria

After checking the math, saw that there is no reason to restrict to QQ or ZZ only, fixing checks at start to reflect this.

This fails doc tests ('Not Implemented Error' spelled wrong) and needs a numberfield example

Well, a couple things here. This passes all the long tests, and the functionality change seems ok.  However, there are two things that should be fixed.

- There is an indentation issue with the new example you added.

- you seems to restrict to number fields or ZZ. If it is ZZ the code changes the ring to QQ so that .lift() works. Why can't you do this for any number field ring (change to its field of fractions)?

I opened the documentation, didn't see any problems there, everything else is fixed, needs review
