As the title says, this patch implements a data structure atop of the current "static sparse graphs" which can be used as a backend for a Sage Graph. Smaller in memory, and faster.

I obviously chosed the "Thou shalt not add a vertex to an immutable graph".

I change my mind so often that I wouldn't put it beyond reach. But just to please you I fixed it `:-P`

Well, I defined the "INPUT" where it was not, but usually the outputs are pretty clear... Not to mention that those are rather meant to Sage developpers.

It's a poetic license.

That it uses static sparse graphs as a data structure. By the way, the link and the name did not match. I rephrased it.

There were arguments there before I learnt that Sage existed, and it is because this method can also be used through `G.copy(whatever)`. This being said, I don't see why one should get a mutable graph as a copy of an immutable one. Copying a tuple certainly does not make it a list, and it would produce rather unexpected behaviour `O_o`

You have no idea how many hours I wasted on that. Unfortunately, you are right. I reversed those modifications and both keywords can now be used.

Patch updated !

Hello! 

As promised I peeked at the code!! In general the patch looks good to me with the exception of the above comments.


* Can we use xrange instead of range when we only iterate over something?

* Can we raise a ValeError in  *'in_neighbors* if u is not in the graph as to be consistent with how out_degree works? 

* In the function **iterator_in_edges** why do we need the call to iter in the following line ?


```
            for x in iter(self.iterator_out_edges(vertices, labels)): 

```

Cython detects "for i in range(n)" loops and replaces them with a C loop. So there is no point in using xrange.

Cooooooooooool ! `:-P`

Volker beat me to this one.

> * Can we raise a ValeError in  *'in_neighbors* if u is not in the graph as to be consistent with how out_degree works? 

`T_T`

You are right. Fixed.

> * In the function **iterator_in_edges** why do we need the call to iter in the following line ?

Because I am an idiot. It actually explains a lot of things `:-P`

Fiiiiiiiiixed !
