Once #16571 and #7298 get merged, it is time to add support for animapted PNGs (APNG) to the `Animation.show()` and `Animation.save()` methods, and also to update the doctests to use `show(format="png")` for these.

Do not reuse `OutputImagePng`, that is for non-animated png.

Another basic output format should be a sequence of PNG, which can easily be displayed in a web browser with javascript (embed images as necessary). Perhaps the easiest animation format.

Replying to [comment:9 vbraun]:
> Another basic output format should be a sequence of PNG, which can easily be displayed in a web browser with javascript (embed images as necessary). Perhaps the easiest animation format.

I'm not sure how much such a format would suffer from HTTP overhead, particularly for a large number of small frames. I guess it depends on the network connection (for the cloud in particular) whether that factor outweights the overhead of concatenating all PNGs to a single APNG file.

But if you are willing to use custom JavaScript code for animations, you could also use [existing code](http://www.devthought.com/projects/mootools/apng/) which provides APNG support on browsers which don't support it natively.
