A grep of the word `deprecation` in the source code indicates that there are many functions which have expired and may be removed.  We will remove those deprecations which have been in Sage for at least one year.

-1 to this ticket. There is no reason to just remove all deprecations like that. Those deprecations *may* be removed, that's true. But does this imply that it's the right thing to do? Not always. I doubt that any one person really understands all the deprecated code in Sage and you obviously should not remove deprecations that you don't understand.

Besides that, this ticket is simply too broad. If you want to remove specific deprecations, just remove those. But not all at once.

NOTE: whenever `deprecated_callable_import()` is used (as opposed to other kinds of deprecation), you should only remove the functionality from the global namespace but not remove it completely.

For example, `TransitiveIdeal` itself is not deprecated, it's just deprecated within `src/sage/combinat/all.py`. Especially since the deprecation warning says "This class soon will not be available in that way anymore", nothing indicates that the whole class will be removed.

> nothing indicates that the whole class will be removed.
I can restore it if you (or Nicolas or Florent) think that it should remain, however I was following the instruction:

```
-- Once the deprecation has been there for enough time: delete
-  ``TransitiveIdeal`` and ``TransitiveIealGraded``.
```

that was in the file.  Note that I did not delete `SearchForest` for that reason.

No, they were not. From #6637 (emphasis mine):

Those classes should have been deprecated in #16352, but they weren't.

1) Why are we deprecating `RestrictedPartitions`? From the way it looks, this functionality is not implemented elsewhere in its full strength (i.e., fixing both a set and a length).

2) Why are we undeprecating `TransitiveIdeal`? Not deleting it is fine, but removing the deprecation warnings?

3) I have just realized that `CyclicPermutations` of a multiset misbehave: e.g., the cardinality method is inherited from `Permutations` and thus disagrees with the list method. What should we do about this?

4) Another lost child:

```
sage: Permutations(["c","a","t"])[0]
['c', 'a', 't']
sage: _ in Permutations()
False
```

(Yet, the class of `Permutations(["c","a","t"])[0]` inherits from `Permutations`.)

You may be right about this.  There is a warning note that I may not have heeded carefully and I can restore those functions if the current `Partitions` function doesn't have this functionality.  I will check carefully and restore it if need be.

> 2) Why are we undeprecating `TransitiveIdeal`? Not deleting it is fine, but removing the deprecation warnings?

The deprecation warnings were only an indication that the function is being removed from the global name space since there were previously no deprecation warnings if you just imported the functions and started using them.  I restored a comment that `TransitiveIdeal` and `TransitiveIdealGraded` do need to be deprecated.

> 3) I have just realized that `CyclicPermutations` of a multiset misbehave: e.g., the cardinality method is inherited from `Permutations` and thus disagrees with the list method. What should we do about this?

Yes.  I agree that both of these are problems.  I tested:

```
sage: len(CyclicPermutations(range(4)))==CyclicPermutations(range(4)).cardinality()
False
```
