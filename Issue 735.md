Were any of these ideas ever implemented? I am occaisonally messed up
by the worksheet quietly restarting without my realizing it. (In that
regard I believe there is a minor bug: when the notebook restarts, it
does not add the red bars on the left to indicate an un-executed
cell.)  I used to use the auto_restart option on a long enough setting
that I could intermittingly work on it all day without a restart
(80000 seconds or so).  Will that option be added back in at some
point?
