I'm opening this ticket because of nbruin's suggestion for my answer https://ask.sagemath.org/question/9277/preparser-state-for-regexs/?answer=42530#post-id-42530

There I shared code for an IPython extension which registers a cell magic which disables the Sage preparser (by toggling the state of the global variable sage.repl.interpreter._do_preparse before and after running the cell).

Before I create a branch, I'd like to get feedback on the following:

Does the name %%noparse work, or should I change it to something else?

I was thinking of adding the magic to the end of the class SageMagics in sage/repl/ipython_extension.py . Any objections?

Anything else for a first-time contributor to keep in mind?

I decided to use the name `%%nopreparse` instead.

no_preparse seems to be more in line with the accepted Python code style.
