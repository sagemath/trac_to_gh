Keywords: gsoc2021

Currently there are several old deprecation warnings in dynamical systems on projective space. They are:

- deprecation of the keyword embedding in sigma_invariants (4 years old, #23333)

- deprecation of rational_periodic_points method (2 years old, #28109)

- deprecation of rational_preperiodic_points method (2 years old, #28213)

We remove these old deprecations in this ticket.

It should become an error if `embedding` is passed.

+        if not embedding is None:
+            raise ValueError('the embedding keyword is deprecated, see :trac:`32205`')
```

this makes no sense - "deprecated" means that it still works 


Also note that changes like this:

```
-    def sigma_invariants(self, n, formal=False, embedding=None, type='point'):
+    def sigma_invariants(self, n, **kwds):
```

make an incompatible change to the signature -- after the change, it is not possible any more to pass these arguments as positional arguments.

This is something to keep in mind when creating new code -- if arguments are meant to be keyword-only, they should be marked as such.


Also a comment on the ticket description:
> We remove these old deprecations in this ticket.

One does not "remove deprecations" -- one removes deprecated features or deprecated code.

This is getting a little circular now.

The signature is changed because you asked for the embedding keyword to be accepted so that an error could be raised. This particular function has never accepted the embedding keyword. The function it replaced was deprecated 2 years ago. That replaced function accepted an embedding keyword until 4 years ago. So adding an embedding keyword to this function just to raise an error does not seem like a good choice.

What should have happened is that after the embedding keyword was deprecated that change was followed-up on before the whole function was deprecated and replaced. However, that's not where we are today.

So, should Alex continue and adjust the error message to be better phrased and leave the code as is or go back to the original solution which seemed to most logical based on the current situation?

Since you have strong opinions about this particular issue, I'm happy to back off and let you handle the review.

No, actually ​90f8798 had kept the parameter and removed the warning and the documentation of the parameter - so effectively the function would silently accept this parameter.

I asked for it to become an error to pass the previously deprecated parameter. 

Normally one would just remove the parameter from the function signature. Then it becomes an error to pass the parameter just by the fact that passing an unknown keyword argument is an error in Python.

However, you have the problem that these functions also accept these arguments as positional arguments. By just removing the `embedding` parameter, you are changing the signature -- a previous call of `.sigma_invariants(n, False, None, 'point')` would no longer be valid.

The current change, to `**kwds`, makes all calls like `.sigma_invariants(n, False)` invalid too. This is an incompatible change and should not be done without deprecation.

This is an excellent point I had not thought about.

If we change the code to throw an error when an `embedding` parameter is passed, then we have reached a dead end where `sigma_invariants` has a useless parameter which must be documented as useless, indefinitely. This seems sub optimal, and confusing for a user.

Is there some way to avoid having to maintain a useless parameter? I can't think of one short of deprecating the entire function and creating a new function with a new name but identical functionality.

If there isn't a way to avoid maintaining a useless parameter, I'm inclined to leave `embedding` as deprecated. That way it is at least clear why `embedding` is still accepted, and if we add a note referencing this ticket, hopefully no one will make my same mistake.

Yes, it is an unfortunate situation that comes from the fact that Sage was stuck in Python 2 for too long, in which the syntax for marking keyword-only parameters was not available. It is affecting many interfaces in Sage.

> Is there some way to avoid having to maintain a useless parameter? 

I'm not aware of a satisfactory mechanism really. We have a `@`rename_keyword decorator, but (as far as I know) not a decorator that would make it an error to pass the keyword - without changing the positional signature.

> I can't think of one short of deprecating the entire function and creating a new function with a new name but identical functionality.

Well, a possible way forward would be to decide to deprecate passing certain parameters as positional arguments. In the example of `sigma_invariants`, I would guess that you would be OK to make all arguments except `n` keyword-only at some point in the future.

So along the lines of the discussion in #16607, one could introduce this deprecation.
Unfortunately this may lead to rather complicated code. So ideally it would be implemented using a decorator instead of doing it one by one in every function that needs it.

After that deprecation has expired, one would finally be able to remove the parameter completely.


> If there isn't a way to avoid maintaining a useless parameter, I'm inclined to leave `embedding` as deprecated. That way it is at least clear why `embedding` is still accepted, and if we add a note referencing this ticket, hopefully no one will make my same mistake.

Yes, I think this is a simple reasonable solution; but instead of calling `deprecation`, you could as well raise an error.

Documentation does not match the implementation. `embedding` is not ignored.
How about something like this:
