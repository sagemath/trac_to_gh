We'll have to check how to keep the colors black for the default wherever this is used in graphs, unless it shouldn't be.

Okay, I ended up making some doc prettier and adding graph plotting to the reference manual (although it's added to two .rst files, there is only one additional html file created in the manual).  I believe that this correctly addresses the original problem while keeping graphs looking the same, but I'd appreciate any reviewer really comparing the "live" doc for a significant number of plotted graphs in the reference manual.

Looks good to me.  Test pass.  Lots of plots I plotted look good, etc.  And I like the patch.

This needs to be rebased to sage-5.1.beta1:

```
applying trac_12605-circle-color-graphplot-doc.patch
patching file sage/graphs/graph_plot.py
Hunk #2 FAILED at 106
Hunk #4 FAILED at 139
Hunk #5 succeeded at 151 with fuzz 2 (offset 0 lines).
2 out of 20 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file sage/graphs/graph_plot.py.rej
```

Also, you might want to fix the trailing whitespace the Patchbot reports.

Okay, I didn't realize how that worked before.  My editor doesn't actually show this or remove it, though it at least never introduces tabs :)

kcrisman: I guess a different ticket would be changing rgbcolor to just color.  None of the colors I saw in the patch were actually R,G,B tuples...

Well, you might be right that this is totally inconsistent.  I think that that was a design decision a looooong time ago, and I don't quite know where we all use rgbcolor versus color.   Reminds me of the difference between alpha (2d) and opacity (3d) which is sort of silly.  Anyway, I'm not thinking about this today.
