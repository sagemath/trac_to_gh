Okay, I ended up making some doc prettier and adding graph plotting to the reference manual (although it's added to two .rst files, there is only one additional html file created in the manual).  I believe that this correctly addresses the original problem while keeping graphs looking the same, but I'd appreciate any reviewer really comparing the "live" doc for a significant number of plotted graphs in the reference manual.
