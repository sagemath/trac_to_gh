but maybe the lgtm warning need a better fix than just removal of `KeyError`

Travis, your opinion please on this "KeyError" removal ?

I believe the idea was to guard against the case the indices also do not index the generators. This either worked previously or never did and it was the dreams of fools and madmen. This change is okay as it never worked (at least in Python3), so any code in the wild will continue to work (or not work) with your change.

Of course, we could change it to what I recall the intended behavior was: add another `try-except` block to return the tuple if another `KeyError` occurs. If you don't want to bother with it, you can set a positive review.
