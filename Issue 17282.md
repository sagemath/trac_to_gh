# Issue 17282: PARI bindings for Galois theory

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17519

Original creator: gagern

Original creation time: 2014-12-17 15:26:57

Working on #17516 I found that there is no Sage binding for the following PARI functions:

* [galoissubfields](http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/dochtml/html.stable/Functions_related_to_general_number_fields.html#galoissubfields)
* [galoissubgroups](http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/dochtml/html.stable/Functions_related_to_general_number_fields.html#galoissubgroups)
* [galoisisabelian](http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/dochtml/html.stable/Functions_related_to_general_number_fields.html#galoisisabelian)
* [galoisisnormal](http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/dochtml/html.stable/Functions_related_to_general_number_fields.html#galoisisnormal)
* [galoispermtopol](http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/dochtml/html.stable/Functions_related_to_general_number_fields.html#galoispermtopol)

Adding them along the lines of existing bindings is easy.

The code looks good to me.  However, all new code is required to have documentation and tests; could you add this (maybe partly using the GP documentation)?

The reviewer patch only makes a number of changes to the formatting and phrasing of the docstrings.  If you agree with these, feel free to set this ticket to positive review.

I changed some things as well. Mostly a missing colon in some method reference. But while I was at it I unified formatting of lists, to have the flag distinctions match input parameter descriptions. I'll leave throwing the review switch to you now.
