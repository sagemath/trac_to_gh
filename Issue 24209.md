# Issue 24209: Fix is_interval() on graphs

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Unify `certificate=True`: in every function return a pair where first element is a Boolean.

Also add definition of interval graph and a link to Wikipedia page.

Three lines to code, several to docs. Easy to review.

I changed this test:


```
sage: n = 8
sage: count = [0]*(n+1)
sage: for g in graphs(n, augment='vertices',property= lambda x:x.is_interval()): # not tested -- 50s
....:     count[g.order()] += 1                                                  # not tested -- 50s
sage: count                                                                      # not tested -- 50s
[1, 1, 2, 4, 10, 27, 92, 369, 1807]
```


I think it is not a good _test_, even if it is good way to generate interval graphs.

Some comments

You should
- move `See :wikipedia:`Interval_graph` for more information.` to the SEEALSO block. 
- add link to `is_chordal`, `IntervalGraph`, `RandomIntervalGraph` in see also block

- `The Petersen Graph is not chordal, so in can't` -> `The Petersen Graph is not chordal, so it can't`

- `Enumerate all small interval graphs::` -> `Enumerate all small interval graphs (see :oeis:`A005975`)::`
- then remove `Compare to A005975 in OEIS.`

- I'm not sure of the interest of the line `sage: print(d)`

you may remove some `[ ]` in the code, for instance: 
* `set([])` -> `set()`
* `dict([(v, (beg[v], end[v])) for v in self])` -> `{v: (beg[v], end[v]) for v in self}`

Replying to [comment:6 dcoudert]:

> - move `See :wikipedia:`Interval_graph` for more information.` to the SEEALSO block. 

Of 21 Wikipedia links on the doc page only one, `is_self_complementary`, has the link in SEEALSO block. So I think this should discussed on sage-devel and to be done in all functions.

I will do other changes.

What' wrong with my links? References seems to be broken.

(Patch contains a non-related colon in `is_immutable()` doc.)

It should be `:meth:` and not `:func:`, right?

I'm always having difficulties with links to methods. Here the last 2 don't turn to links in the html doc. Don't know why.

I tried that too, no help.

Frédéric, what's wrong with my links?

Sorry, I have no idea either, and I usually don't build the doc.

This form is working for me !!!

```
            - :meth:`~sage.graphs.graph_generators.GraphGenerators.IntervalGraph`
            - :meth:`~sage.graphs.graph_generators.GraphGenerators.RandomIntervalGraph`
```



If you follow the links, you may discover another issue: in the html file `.../graphs/graph_generators.html` the name of many methods is preceded by `static`, like `static IntervalGraph(intervals, points_ordered=False)`. Don't remember if it was the case before. May be a side effect of some recent change ? or it's due to the call to `staticmethod` ?

Thanks David!

I mark this as needs_review, because I think that the case for Wikipedia links should be handled for all functions, if at all.
