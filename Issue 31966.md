From an email:

```
sage: Square = CubicalComplex([([0,1],[0,1])])
sage: EdgesLTR = CubicalComplex([([0,0],[0,1]),([0,1],[1,1]),([1,1],[0,1])])
sage: EdgesLBR = CubicalComplex([([0,0],[0,1]),([0,1],[0,0]),([1,1],[0,1])])
sage: Square.homology(subcomplex=EdgesLTR)
{0: 0, 1: Z, 2: Z}
sage: Square.homology(subcomplex=EdgesLBR)
{0: 0, 1: 0, 2: 0}
```

The homology should be zero in both cases.
