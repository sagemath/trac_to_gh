When either system `polymake` is present (#31527) or `--enable-polymake` is in use, this script package would be automatically required.

It will have `jupymake` as a dependency, but otherwise not install anything.

Adding script packages of this type will be the general mechanism to activate modularized distributions of the Sage library. 
For example, presence of `tdlib` will make `sagemath_tdlib` required, etc.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32741

if a package A has to trigger install of package B, this I think can be done in spkg-configure.m4 of A by setting the appropriate variable to `yes`, which
can be checked in spkg-configure.m4 of B.
Assuming A is a dependency of B, declared in its spkg-configure.m4 to make sure A is configured before B.

Any need for the more elaborate scheme?
