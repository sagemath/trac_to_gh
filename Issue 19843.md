I would like to mention `sphinxify.py` which is currently part of `sagenb` but should be moved to inside `sage` proper ASAP. `sphinxify` is called from `sage/misc/sagedoc.py` both at doc building time and run time.

I'm open to PRs, as this seems pretty reasonable - docbuild shouldn't depend on sagenb, though we would still want the doc to work from within it.
