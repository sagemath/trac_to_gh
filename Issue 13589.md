I begin implementation of some Hopf algebra: FQSym, and WQSym PQSym.
(And some quotients: PBT, Baxter, Stalactic)
I try to follow the NCSF-QSym design.

Hello,

I'm sorry, I have to do that post since long time.

Rémi Maurice (Univ. MLV, France) and I have develop a library of combinatorial Hopf algebras. That one contains M-R, Loday-Ronco and some other.

M-R is clean (I think).

The two previous files contains tutorial about how to use the library.

(There is two way to notify to sage where is the lib: one with export and an other with the file "init.sage"... You just have to use one.)

Cool! And I see you've implemented dendriform algebras... this was on my (farther) plans.

But I can't get the library to run (5.11beta3):

Are you assuming #10963? Or the whole sage-combinat queue?

This is a very large and ambitious undertaking, so we're going to try and split it up into more manageable tickets, adding only a few features at a time. I just want to make sure that I have the right idea about what order things should be tackled in, dependencies, and that they're broken up into small enough pieces before I create new tickets.

- Adding 'connected' to graded_hopf_algebras_with_basis.py as one ticket

- Dendriform_algebras/dendriform_coalgebras/bidendriform_bialgebras as one ticket.

- Operator_tools.py as one ticket.

- Ordered_set_partition, packed_words, and quasi_shuffle as one ticket.

I believe those four tickets would all be independent of each other, and all further features will depend on them.

- Next would be implementing the framework which within this ticket is located in combinat/hopf_algebras/categories/ (dialgebras, diese product, polynomial realization, quadrialgebras, scalar_product). This would probably be broken up into a few tickets, but I don't know enough about them yet to know which ones go together).


Once all of the previous framework has been added, then we can implement individual CHAs, which would probably each be their own ticket, and rely on all the previous tickets.

- Implementations for FQSym and WQSym are included in this ticket.

- PBT already has its own ticket (#13855) and I believe it includes an implementation.

- There are a few more where code exists as part of the external CHA package, but have not yet been integrated into any Trac ticket (FSym, PQSym, WSym).

Hello,

Thank you very much about your work! :-)


Replying to [comment:25 kdilks]: 
> - Ordered_set_partition, packed_words, 


I have created a ticket about packed words and ordered set partition : #15611

> and quasi_shuffle as one ticket.


and an other one about quasi-shuffle #15597.

> - Next would be implementing the framework which within this ticket is located in combinat/hopf_algebras/categories/ (dialgebras, diese product, polynomial realization, quadrialgebras, scalar_product).

I don't know enough too about dialgebras, diese product and quadrialgebras to be sure that this code is essential... The notion of polynomial realization should generalized the realization in Sym and QSym...

Thanks!!

I wouldn't hold your breath. When I said "flexible start date", I'm thinking anytime 2018/2019, though if someone very suitable wanted to start now I'd of course take him/her.
