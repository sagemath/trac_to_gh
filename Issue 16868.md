Keywords: complex interval, CIF

In contrast to `RealIntervalFieldElement`, `ComplexIntervalFieldElement` did not implement `__nonzero___`.

`RealIntervalFieldElement.__nonzero__` returns `True` if it is not known to be exactly zero.

This patch implements the same for `ComplexIntervalFieldElement`.
