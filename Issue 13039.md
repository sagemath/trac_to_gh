From the GAP website:  "The current version is GAP 4.5.5 released on July 17th, 2012."

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-08-27 02:51:58

And of course the random number generator (random group element) in GAP changed, yay!


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-08-27 02:51:58

Changing keywords from "" to "rng".

Comment by mmarco created at 2012-08-27 09:39:46

It could also be a good moment to include as many gap packages as possible in the gap_packages spkg. I made a list with the licenses of some packages [1] and a spkg with those  packages that have gpl license and i was able to make install seamlessly [2].

It was all for 4.4.12 version, but should be easily ported to 4.5

No this is not a good moment to add features to gap. Make a separate ticket.

indeed, that can be done later. Let's upgrade first. 
By the way, did you take care of #13341?


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-08-27 13:49:14

I've based it on #13341 and tried to not touch any cygwin stuff. Though its probably save to say that cygwin broke, I don't have a Windows machine to test on.

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-08-27 14:17:21

Also the new gap prints escape codes on Fedora 17, I've communicated this to the GAP devs here:

```
[vbraun@laptop ~]$ echo '1+1;' | sage -gap -q | od -c
0000000 033   [   ?   1   0   3   4   h   2  \n
0000012
```

Here are test failures on my `OpenSUSE` laptop.

Most of the tests fail because of changes in the random generator or because of slightly changed error messages or because of changing documentation in GAP or simply because of testing against the version number.

Here are more serious problems:

```
File "/home/simon/SAGE/prerelease/sage-5.2.rc0/devel/sage-main/sage/interfaces/gap.py", line 1330:

In sage/coding/linear_code.py are a few crashes, like this:

```

Note the crash in the last example. A similar crash is:

```


Several tests in latin.py fail, probably because of changes in the random generator. Couldn't one test instead whether the squares really _are_ latin?

A strange one:

```
File "/home/simon/SAGE/prerelease/sage-5.2.rc0/devel/sage-main/sage/tests/cmdline.py", line 359:
    sage: out

```

I've isolated a test case for the gap crashes and sent it to the GAP developers.


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-08-30 17:52:34

Changing keywords from "rng" to "".


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-08-30 17:52:34

The crashes are all due to a GAP garbage collection bug in Z/2Z-specific code. I've fixed all other doctest errors. The only remaining ones are

```
sage -t  -force_lib devel/sage/sage/coding/code_constructions.py # 1 doctests failed
sage -t  -force_lib devel/sage/sage/coding/linear_code.py # 3 doctests failed
```

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-09-02 11:28:21

I received a patch from the upstream developers, to be included in gap-4.5.6. I've updated the gap spkg with the fix, now the Sage testsuite runs without errors. I also updated the gap_packages spkg with a fix for a function name clash in braid-1.1 that broke the GAP testsuite (i.e. SAGE_CHECK=yes). So as far as I'm concerned we are good to go.

I would appreciate a speedy review of this ticket *nudge* *nudge*


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-09-02 11:28:21

Changing status from new to needs_review.


---

Comment by SimonKing created at 2012-09-02 14:20:11

Installing the gap-4.5.5 spkg, the new gap packages and database gap spkgs worked fine on `openSuse` with `SAGE_CHECK=yes`. Now I'll start the Sage test suite.


---

Comment by SimonKing created at 2012-09-02 15:49:40

The Sage test suite passes as well. `hg status` has nothing to complain, in any of the three packages. And `SPKG.txt` is updated in all cases. Hence, from my perspective, it is a positive review. However, I'll repeat on bsd.math, and perhaps someone else can repeat on `openSolaris`.


---

Comment by SimonKing created at 2012-09-02 15:51:17

PS: Unfortunately most test of the to-be-reviewed latest version of my p_group_cohomology spkg fail with the new versions of Singular and GAP. But I guess that's my own problem...

Comment by rbeezer created at 2012-09-02 18:29:46

Dear Volker and Simon,

Thanks very much for your work on this one.  I've been becoming a lot more familiar with the GAP interface this summer and getting undergraduate students involved, so I really appreciate your work getting this organized and reviewed.

Wow. That's not good. I suppose that there are a lot of further errors. If `gap(3)` breaks then I guess most other gap stuff will break, too.

FWIW, make ptest worked on my laptop and make ptestlong worked on bsd.math. The spkgs look fine, in terms of `hg status` and `SPKG.txt`.


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2012-09-03 05:36:13

That is the only error, actually. I did `make ptestlong` and everything else passed.


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2012-09-03 05:53:52

A little more data: I can only get the doctest to fail if the system is somewhat loaded (for example, doing parallel doctests). If the system is idle, the doctest passes consistently; if it's loaded, the doctest fails consistently.

(In more detail: I am remotely logging into the machine in my office at the university, and I know that no one else uses the machine. Running 'make ptestlong` gives a failure, running `./sage -tp 2 devel/sage/sage/interfaces/` gives a failure, running the doctest while I'm also building another installation of Sage gives a failure, while it passes when running the doctest by itself. It's quite repeatable.)

This is where Ctrl-C is tested, for the record.

Edit: where automatic restarting of the GAP interpreter is tested.

You mean this one?

```
        The following tests against a bug fixed at trac ticket #10296:

            sage: a = gap(3)
            sage: gap.eval('quit;')
            ''
            sage: a = gap(3)
            ** Gap crashed or quit executing '$sage...:=3;;' **
            Restarting Gap and trying again
            sage: a
            3
```

Does it fail in the first or in the second instance of `a = gap(3)`? Why does it report a user interrupt, when either nothing has happened at all (first instance) or GAP was not running (second instance)?


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-09-03 10:42:37

I could reproduce this in repeated testing on Linux. You actually need to scroll up a bit higher:

```
            sage: gap.interrupt(timeout=1) is not None
            True
            sage: gap._eval_using_file_cutoff = cutoff

        The following tests against a bug fixed at trac ticket #10296:

            sage: a = gap(3)
```

and it dies in the first `gap(3)`. Because our `interrupt()` method is crap, it sends the wrong quit string and GAP/readline interferes with Ctrl-C. 

The updated patch fixes this. I still find a ~1% chance of failing `sage.interfaces.gap` doctests in random places, but thats probably on par for any pexpect interface.


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-09-03 11:41:38

Also `gap_console()` was broken. Fixed it and added a meaningful doctest.


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2012-09-03 17:42:44

On OpenSolaris, I am getting doctest failures in interfaces/expect.py. The failures are not always the same, but here is a sample:

- http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/palmieri/misc/EXPECT1.log
- http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/palmieri/misc/EXPECT2.log
- http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/palmieri/misc/EXPECT3.log

I don't know what these have to do with this ticket, but they certainly seem to be caused by the spkg here.

--------

By the way, the new library patch seems to fix the issues on OS X.

It looks like there is space to me, but which disk should I be looking at? I don't understand why after installing the spkg here, if I then do `./sage -f spkg/standard/gap-4.4.12.p7.spkg`, the doctest passes, and then if I do `./sage -f gap-4.5.5.spkg`, it fails again. Does the new version of GAP create temporary files somewhere new, compared to the old version?

I didn't change anything. All temp files should go to `$DOT_SAGE` as before.

I'd need to repeat without all the other patches, though, to be on the safe side.

OpenSolaris: I tried setting DOT_SAGE to /tmp/palmieri, and I still see the same failures with the new spkg, no failures with the old one. Any ideas?

The error is reproducible, with just the new spkg and the doctest fix patch applied. That must be a really nasty side effect, because in an interactive session `gap(2)` returns 2.

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-09-05 14:20:27

I took some time to understand the gap pexpect interface. Altogether, I think it would be better to base it on the normal interface which seems to be more stable and definitely has more exposure. But we are using the package mode (`gap -p`) and that is neither documented (apart from the source) nor does it behave particularly well when you send Ctrl-C. But that is definitely for another ticket. 

I did add more checks after `interrupt()` that the pexpect interface is in a sane state, and restart gap if it is not. I ran 500+ iterations of the doctest and do not get any failures anymore. I'm pretty confident that this is at least as good as we had before, so please review.


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-09-05 16:25:22

There was one doctest error is `sage/interfaces/expect.py` where there is a synchronization method for the expect interface. Since it doesn't know about the GAP package mode it actually desynchronizes the gap interface ;-) Fixed in the updated patch.

On skynet machine mark (Solaris on sparc, Sage built with `SAGE_INSTALL_GCC=yes`), this version of Gap doesn't work:

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-09-05 19:06:17

I'm not surprised that it doesn't work on SPARC. I'll send the authors a bug report. But since its not a primary platform it shouldn't stop us from shipping the new GAP version.


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-09-06 13:55:49

I've investigated the SPARC issue and received a patch from the GAP developers. I've updated the spkg, now builds and tests fine on mark.

Naturally, nobody dared to review this ticket. So GAP released the next version in the meantime. Updated to gap-4.5.6.

http://www.stp.dias.ie/~vbraun/Sage/spkg/gap-4.5.6.spkg has uncommitted changes in `SPKG.txt`
and the spkg itself is not compressed, making it over 50MB instead of under 10MB.

I get the following errors on Mac OS X 10.4 PPC.  I think they are all about the seed for random tests.  Notice that they did pass in the past, and they are neither the old nor the new versions of the expected results from the patch here.  Could the little/big-endian have any impact on this?  I assume not, but otherwise it seems odd that they worked in the past and don't now.  Of course, they ARE "random"...

In `sage.misc.randstate.pyx` there is a method `set_seed_gap()` that checks for big endian-ness and flips bytes around in that case. It could be that GAP's new random number code is actually big endian clean. Can you modify `set_seed_gap()` and see if that fixes things?

Well, what do you know!  I didn't think Sage had any custom code for big endian...  I'll try this now.  It certainly sounds likely.

It does fix the problem in randstate.pyx, so I think you're right about the others.  Testing now.

Oh dear, now I see why it felt like good deja vu  : see #9867. Nice moldy bitrotten ticket.  
It was never merged when the current ticket was prepared. 

I've put #9867 up for review. Please close it and merge it here somehow...

I have added the patch from #9867 here.

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-09-26 09:58:17

Changing status from needs_work to positive_review.


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-09-26 09:58:17

I've rebased it on #13123 (that is, on the as-of-yet unrelease sage-5.4.beta2) and folded in the endianness patch.


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2012-09-26 10:04:09

I don't think it depends on #13123 _twice_.


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2012-10-05 09:20:10

It seems the endianness patch is included in the other patch...

When testing this in a from-scratch built Sage, I got

```
sage -t  -force_lib devel/sage/sage/tests/cmdline.py
**********************************************************************
File "/release/merger/sage-5.5.beta0/devel/sage-main/sage/tests/cmdline.py", line 408:

**********************************************************************
```

On subsequent tests, I did not get this message.

Looking at the GAP sources, this seems to be caused by a lack of memory...

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2012-10-05 13:51:44

Also, I somehow ended up with orphan GAP processes running:

Its not lack of actual memory, it is a lack of swap space. GAP reserves addressing space and  corresponding swap space such that the addressing space could be actually used (potentially by swapping) if GAP were to use that much memory. If the initial workspace is too large, it tries with half the size iteratively until it succeeds. The "halving pool size" is harmless but cannot be disabled.

The `printf()` could be patched out... if it's harmless.

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-10-05 14:16:23

I've written upstream about this issue, hopefully it'll be fixed in a future release.

I'm not entirely happy with our allocation strategy, if you are running multiple sage processes (e.g. on a server) then you quickly reserve most of swap. I'll add a patch to tweak the pool size.


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2012-10-05 19:06:28

In any case, something needs to be done about the `cmdline.py` doctest failure due to that "error" message which isn't even an error.

Also: after running all doctests again, I ended up again with an orphaned `gap` process.

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-10-08 20:49:48

I've fixed the "halving pool size" doctest error and changed the workspace allocation to default to 1/10*(available swap). This should give you enough workspace without reserving all swap when you run a server (or parallel doctests).

I can't reproduce any gap orphans. I verified that the gap pid is correctly written to `spawned_processes` so even if Sage gets kill -9'ed the sage-cleaner will get rid of orphans. Maybe sage-cleaner has some issue on your setup, Jeroen?

The additional trac_13211_pool_size.patch needs review... Dima? ;-)

I haven't looked at the code, but are you sure gap is started only from one place in Sage?  Maybe the command line helps:

```
/release/merger/sage-5.5.beta0/local/gap/latest/bin/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc-default64/gap -m 24m -l /release/merger/sage-5.5.beta0/local/gap/latest -r -b -p -T -o 9999G /release/merger/sage-5.5.beta0/local/share/sage/ext/gap/sage.g
```



---

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-10-08 21:17:16

I spend quite some time today trying to find any change that might change where or how gap is started, but I didn't find any. I ran various doctests and tried to kill -9 the sage process, but never managed to produce any orphans that weren't cleaned up.

Concerning the orphaned process: could it be that they appear during the *build* as opposed to when running Sage?  Typical command line:

```
/release/merger/sage-5.5.beta2/local/gap/latest/bin/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc-default64/gap -m 24m -l /release/merger/sage-5.5.beta2/local/gap/latest -r -b -p -T -o 6271720243 /release/merger/sage-5.5.beta2/local/share/sage/ext/gap/sage.g

Oh, OK, this is a missing dependency, I think. GAP depends upon MPIR now, as it uses (pseudo)GMP. I'll attach a patch in a second.

The question is not why are there GAP orphans, but why is the sage-cleaner not killing them once the parent Sage process quits?

I'll shortly add a patch to run gap with `prctl --unaligned=silent` on itanium, this will get rid of the offending alignment warnings.

Positive review to dima's dependency patch.

I've also added the patch to suppress the itanium warnings. I haven't tested it on itanium yet (building sage-5.4.rc3 first). But I've verified that the `prctl` call gets rid of the warnings.

PS: The GAP command line includes `-o 6271720243`, this is clearly from `trac_13211_pool_size.patch` and not a process created during build.

I can reproduce this neither on Debian x86_64 nor on OSX 10.6.8. Specifically, I cd to SAGE_ROOT and start
`./local/bin/sage-starts` there.
I even tried to remove `~/.sage/`, no difference.

It looks like we need more details on the system you see this. (Preferably, access to it...).

OK, got it. I need to issue several `local/bin/sage-starts` within a short period of time on Debian x86_64. Then I get the orphans! Otherwise, not. A race condition, of sorts?

Oops, no, in fact, these are not orphans, in the sense that they are not staying running forever. They all finish within 20-30 seconds. A typical process looks as follows (very similar to Jeroen's case):

```
dima     17195     1 93 19:24 ?        00:00:25 /usr/local/src/sage/sage-5.4.rc3/local/gap/latest/bin/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc-default64/gap -m 24m -l /usr/local/src/sage/sage-5.4.rc3/local/gap/latest -r -b -p -T -o 872851456 /usr/local/src/sage/sage-5.4.rc3/local/share/sage/ext/gap/sage.g

Jeroen, so you say that for you these processes don't finish by themselves?

Big there's still the obvious question: what is that `gap` process doing and why does it keep running for a while?


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2012-11-03 12:27:42

Running `strace` on such a `gap` process shows:

```
getrusage(RUSAGE_SELF, {ru_utime={97, 710000}, ru_stime={0, 200000}, ...}) = 0
write(1, "@!", 2)                       = -1 EIO (Input/output error)
getrusage(RUSAGE_SELF, {ru_utime={97, 740000}, ru_stime={0, 200000}, ...}) = 0
write(1, "@!", 2)                       = -1 EIO (Input/output error)
getrusage(RUSAGE_SELF, {ru_utime={97, 770000}, ru_stime={0, 200000}, ...}) = 0
write(1, "@!", 2)                       = -1 EIO (Input/output error)
getrusage(RUSAGE_SELF, {ru_utime={97, 800000}, ru_stime={0, 200000}, ...}) = 0
write(1, "@!", 2)                       = -1 EIO (Input/output error)
getrusage(RUSAGE_SELF, {ru_utime={97, 830000}, ru_stime={0, 200000}, ...}) = 0
```

[...]

getrusage(RUSAGE_SELF, {ru_utime={116, 940000}, ru_stime={0, 200000}, ...}) = 0

--- SIGSEGV (Segmentation fault) @ 0 (0) ---

It looks like it's stuck in an infinite loop until it finally segfaults, which is almost certainly not what's supposed to happen.

Replying to [comment:106 jdemeyer]:
> Big there's still the obvious question: what is that `gap` process doing and why does it keep running for a while?

that it's the same GAP process as the one that gets started during the "normal" Sage startup.
And it does the following things, as you can see by uncommenting `LogTo` line at the end of `sage.g`. 

```
gap> LoadPackage("ctbllib");
true
...
gap> SaveWorkspace("/var/folders/qW/qWY+4Ku1GF0WXrOsV+IDvk+++TM/-Tmp-//dotsageKTXveD/gap/workspace-8046660130267724445");
true
gap> 
```

`LoadPackage()` things are OK, it's just loading GAP's packages.
The tough thing is `SaveWorkspace()`, which dumps GAP's workspace into a binary file; which can be loaded back --- well, not in this case of course, cause we are invoked with --nodotsage, so it goes to waste.

So I suppose that's what gets stuck, and crashes, for some reason (e.g. not enough disk space?).

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-11-03 14:10:15

Whats the content of your `~/.sage/tmp/<hostname>/<pid>/spawned_processes` file?


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-11-03 14:17:14

PS: Writing the workspace dump succeeds as you can see from Jeroen's strace. 

We don't specifically close down GAP afterwards, but just close the stdin/out pipes. This sends GAP into at tizzy, and it keeps trying to read from stdin after getting EIO (why would you do this?). Still, the real question remains: why is GAP not killed by the sage cleaner?


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2012-11-03 14:27:35

Now I see ENOSPC errors (I think not before):

```
open("/tmp/dotsagewHCJJ1/gap/workspace-5368401171496622154", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, 0644) = 4
write(4, "GAP workspace\0004.5.6\00064 bit\0\10\7\6\5\4"..., 100000) = -1 ENOSPC (No space left on device)
```


But this doesn't make sense as there is plenty of space on `/tmp` and I can create large files manually there:

```
jdemeyer@sage:sage-5.5.beta0-gap$ dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/dotsagewHCJJ1/gap/workspace-5368401171496622154 bs=1024 count=100000
100000+0 records in
100000+0 records out
102400000 bytes (102 MB) copied, 0.158741 s, 645 MB/s
```


I am lost...


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2012-11-03 14:30:24

Could the ENOSPC be related to the fact that this a tmpfs and that GAP reserves all the memory for itself?


---

Comment by ppurka created at 2012-11-03 14:31:36

Does gap create lots of small files in `/tmp`? If so, are you running out of inodes? You can check using `df -i`.


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2012-11-03 14:34:19

`/tmp` is as good as empty:

```
jdemeyer@sage:~$ df -h /tmp
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
tmpfs            16G   25M   16G   1% /tmp
jdemeyer@sage:~$ df -i /tmp
Filesystem     Inodes IUsed  IFree IUse% Mounted on
tmpfs          524288  1253 523035    1% /tmp
```


(looking at the trace, gap doesn't create a lot of files in `/tmp`)


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-11-03 14:49:00

Possibly kernel bug? From 2.6.38 changelog: "tmpfs: fix spurious ENOSPC when racing with unswap". GAP puts pressure on swap since it locks address space (and hence reduces the available swap).

I've added a patch to explicitly quit Gap after writing the workspace. 

The sage-cleaner indeed looks in `.../temp/...`, but `SAGE_TMP` is in `.../tmp/...` so the cleaner is currently broken. Thats the fault of #13579

After running some doctests again with this patch, I see a lot of orphan gap processes again.
The strace is as before:

```
[...]
getrusage(RUSAGE_SELF, {ru_utime={9186, 870000}, ru_stime={6, 120000}, ...}) = 0
write(1, "@!", 2)                       = -1 EIO (Input/output error)
getrusage(RUSAGE_SELF, {ru_utime={9187, 210000}, ru_stime={6, 120000}, ...}) = 0
write(1, "@!", 2)                       = -1 EIO (Input/output error)
getrusage(RUSAGE_SELF, {ru_utime={9187, 550000}, ru_stime={6, 120000}, ...}) = 0

That's *a* question, I don't think it's *the* question.  Sage should clean up for itself and `sage-cleaner` should only be a last resort.


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-11-09 17:58:23

I agree, but since you are the only one who is able to get the orphans (possibly in conjunction with a kernel bug) I'd be perfectly happy to let sage-cleaner handle this corner case.


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-11-09 17:59:09

On an unrelated note, the interleaved getrusage / write strace probably means that GAP is running something in the internal profiler.


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-11-09 18:05:04

Can you confirm that the offending gap process still doesn't include the "-L ...gapworkspace.." command line switch? This probably means that the processes originate when creating the workspace. Is this on a file system that disallows simultaneous writes from multiple processes to the same file?


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-11-09 18:34:55

Also, can you post a strace for the hanging GAP process? With trac_13211_quit_after_workspace.patch the 'gap_reset_workspace()' command quits correctly, so I suspect your problem is at a different place now.


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2012-11-12 10:11:55

To better test this, I disabled the cleaner (by putting `sys.exit(0)` in `sage-cleaner`).

Example strace of segfaulting process is attached.

I'm also seeing a lot of `ENOMEM` errors in the trace.  Could these be caused by the huge pool size?


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2012-11-12 10:44:23

There is a potential infinite loop with `_eval_line` in `gap.py`: when it crashes, it keeps trying again over and over:

```
    def _eval_line(self, line, allow_use_file=True, wait_for_prompt=True, restart_if_needed=True):
        [...]
        try:
            [...]
        except (RuntimeError,TypeError),message:
            if 'EOF' in message[0] or E is None or not E.isalive():
                print "** %s crashed or quit executing '%s' **"%(self, line)
                print "Restarting %s and trying again"%self
                self._start()
                if line != '':
                    return self._eval_line(line, allow_use_file=allow_use_file)
                else:
                    return ''
            else:
                raise RuntimeError, message
```


Is this intentional? Probably the number of retries should be limited.

(this seems unrelated to this ticket but I thought I should mention it)

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-11-12 16:26:35

Did you apply `trac_13211_pool_size.patch`? Unless your machine has exabyte-sized swap it shouldn't even try to allocate such a large pool.

That explains why you get the ENOMEMs. But gap tries smaller and smaller mmaps until it succeeds, so this is not a real problem. It will eat the available swap space and put much more pressure on the virtual memory system, though. I'll report this issue upstream.

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-11-12 21:47:05

I've updated the patch to use `gap -o <number>m` for a specific number of megabytes instead of specifying the pool size in bytes. This should avoid the argument parsing overflow.

OK, I am testing this on the culprit machine (sage on sagemath UW cluster), and not able to see any staying up GAP processes. I'll try a bit more, and unless I succeed, I'll make it positive review...

[attachment:gap.10799] shows the strace of a hanging process. At some point, the trace stops, it seems no further system calls are done.

I don't see the EIO errors and segmentation faults anymore, perhaps that was caused by ENOMEM?

I tried applying the patches (and the spkg) on this ticket to Sage 5.4.rc4, and running `make ptest`. I have not got any `gap` processes left after it has finished. Have you been doing something else, something nonstandard?

Where is .sage/ used in these calls to GAP? AFAIK there is no `/release/merger/sage-5.5.beta2/home/`, yet they list GAP workspace files `/release/merger/sage-5.5.beta2/home/.sage/gap/workspace-1647326966196298359`.

Weird. Could it be the reason for them to hang?


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2012-11-13 15:08:33

`/release/merger/sage-5.5.beta2/home` is a temporary `$HOME` directory for the merger. It's similar to using the `--nodotsage` command line option to `sage`.

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-11-13 22:09:32

I still don't understand why you get EIO. This means something is seriously foobared, no? When sage quits the other end of the pipe should be closed, resulting in EPIPE.

My theory is the following: the Sage expect interface can use temporary files to redirect stdin/out and this is where the problem lies. If you run with `sage --nodotsage`, this temporary file is on `/tmp` (see `SAGE_TMP_INTERFACE`). The tmpfs on sage.math has some bug that is triggered when you put pressure on the virtual memory, when most of the swap is locked in anonymous mmaps.


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-11-14 04:03:24

I ran some more doctests and GAP is not the only process that ends up in a write loop with EIO until it segfaults. E.g. Maxima does it, too. I guess your problem is that GAP does **not** segfault under certain circumstances.


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-11-14 04:05:13

The glibc manual says: _EIO also occurs when a background process tries to read from the controlling terminal, and the normal action of stopping the process by sending it a SIGTTIN signal isn't working. This might happen if signal is being blocked or ignored, or because the process group is orphaned. See section Job Control, for more information about job control, and section Signal Handling, for information about signals._

I doubt that `/tmp` has anything to do with it. The filedescriptor giving EIO is a deleted pseudo-terminal, not a temporary file. This can be seen from `/proc/$PID/fd`:

```

Somewhere near the end of  `sage/ext/gap/sage.g`
there is a commented out line `LogTo("/tmp/gapsage.log");`
Could you uncomment it and try to reproduce such a hanging GAP process, with this log on?

As well, perhaps add some debugging prints into each of the GAP functions in the file.
Something like `AppendTo("/tmp/sageg","OperationsAdmittingFirstArgument\n");`
where `OperationsAdmittingFirstArgument` is the function name, and "tmp/sageg" the name of the log file...

My guess that the problem is in `$SAGE.NewPager()`, which tries to get `$SAGE.tempfile` and fails, either during this interaction, or upon attempting to open it.

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2012-11-14 15:06:49

I am seriously debugging GAP now to check for the problem.


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2012-11-14 16:03:34

I'm pretty sure I found the bug. The culprit is the following from `src/sysfiles.c`:


```
/* utility to check return value of 'write'  */
ssize_t writeandcheck(int fd, const char *buf, size_t count) {
  int ret;
  ret = write(fd, buf, count);
  if (ret < 0)
  {
    ErrorQuit("Cannot write to file descriptor %d, see 'LastSystemError();'\n",
               fd, 0L);
  }
return ret;
}
```


If the pseudo-tty is closed, then `write()` fails with EIO, causing GAP to write an error message. We then get an infinite loop of failing to write the error message.


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2012-11-14 16:37:45

It seems that `ErrorQuit` could just write to `stderr` in this case. Although in general it's not clear to me how to deal with it, for such a plug perhaps could break the ability of the interpreter to recover from errors.
Is it actually possible to reliably check that the pty is closed?

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-11-14 19:25:02

You'd still get a EPIPE if the process wasn't orphaned. Also, the problem is that GAP is **not** segfaulting in some circumstances when it is orphaned. If it would segfault you wouldn't get an orphan.

The underlying problem is that the expect interfaces don't always clean up processes before quitting Sage, hence leading to orphaned processes to start with. Only after the process is orphaned you get EIO's.

I doubt that pseudo-terminals can cause an EPIPE (at least in Linux).  Even if they would, you should also get a SIGPIPE signal, killing the process.

> Also, the problem is that GAP is **not** segfaulting in some circumstances when it is orphaned.
I would not say that this is the problem. There is a bug in GAP which may or may not lead to a segfault. Relying that it will cause a segfault is silly.

> The underlying problem is that the expect interfaces don't always clean up processes before quitting Sage, hence leading to orphaned processes to start with. Only after the process is orphaned you get EIO's.
True. So either we fix GAP or we fix the Sage interface, and preferably both.

Just for the record, other programs Segfault after running into EIO for a while as well. I dare say that most interactive binaries are not meant to be run as orphans. I don't see much point in making sure that the GAP command line interface can be run without controlling terminal.

Indeed, it seems ECL has exactly the same bug. But that doesn't mean the GAP bug (or the Sage bug controlling GAP if you want) shouldn't be fixed.

And the problem isn't limited to terminals: as I showed, it can also occur for example when writing to a filesystem which is full.

This is not the complete story. First off, you need to run with -T, which is meant to suppress the usual interactive behavour, and this is the option using which the orphans in question arise. In fact, it is because `stderr` is full, not because `stdout` is full.

```
(sage-sh) dima@sage$ gap -T >/dev/full
Error, Cannot write to file descriptor 1, see 'LastSystemError();'

Error, Cannot write to file descriptor 1, see 'LastSystemError();'

Error, Cannot write to file descriptor 1, see 'LastSystemError();'

Error, Cannot write to file descriptor 1, see 'LastSystemError();'

Error, Cannot write to file descriptor 1, see 'LastSystemError();'

Syntax error: ; expected
^
Error, Cannot write to file descriptor 1, see 'LastSystemError();'

(sage-sh) dima@sage$
```

Thus if the `stderr` is OK, it sort of works (the `Syntax error;` is quite weird though, and might be an indication of a "more real" bug).
By the way, `gap-4.4` just hangs in this situation.

As we talk about the situation with -T on, we can patch, say, `ErrorQuit` for this case to print to `stderr` and quit immediately. This will not fix this completely, but at least it will make sure that with -T option the behaviour is as it should be.

An alternative is to change Sage so that GAPs `stderr` does not get redirected. I don't know how well this will work, though.

The patch makes `gap &>/dev/full` hang. (Well, this is consistent with GAP 4.4 behaviour). At least this is good enough, I suppose, to fix the orphans issue. I mark this as positive review, with understanding that orphans, which I can't reproduce anyway, are no longer there. I hope GAP people will fix this good and proper.

Of course it "hangs", since it's waiting for user input. It's still an interactive GAP session, you can hit CTRL-D to exit.

There is something wrong with the pool size patch. On the buildbot machine "snapperkob" (Ubuntu 12.04 x86_64), gap is started with "-o 53m" which is too few. It gives

```

yes, I was just reading your patch. It's my fault that I missed this potential problem before (I am aware of a "modern" school that teaches that swap is dead, as there is so much RAM nowadays...).

Let me test it now.

no, you have set it to `75*1024**3`, which is 75**GB**!
You should do `75*1024**2` instead.

I also think that 

```
   suggested_size = max(int(mem.available_swap() / 10),  
 		                         int(mem.available_ram()  / 50),   # in case you run without swap 
 		                         75 * 1024**2 )      # about 75MB is the minimum to run GAP 
```

is way too much for machines with a lot of RAM. E.g. I tried this on sage.combinat and got 3.6GB as the `suggested_size`.
I'd rather propose

```
   suggested_size = min(150 * 1024**2, 
                               max(int(mem.available_swap() / 10),  
 		               int(mem.available_ram()  / 50),   # in case you run without swap 
 		               75 * 1024**2 ))      # about 75MB is the minimum to run GAP 
}}} 
for 150MB is certainly good enough, but would not lead to problems if you have a hundred instances of Sage running on the same machine.

Would it make sense, in `spkg-install`, to either remove the old GAP installation or (probably better) to move it to `local/gap/gap-4.4.12`?


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-11-17 05:38:00

Thanks, fixed the MB... its been a long time that I've seen computations not finish because of `O(1024^2)` bytes of storage missing ;-)

I've also added the appropriate `# 64-bit` vs `# 32-bit` to the offending doctest.

The pool size is **NOT** allocated ram, it is an anonymous mmap and will only be used if necessary. 150MB is definitely not enough for serious computations. If you want hundreds of Sage instances then thats fine, you just need enough swap. Or, if you prefer, you can set up your desktop without swap. Then the pool will be backed by actual RAM, but you hopefully were aware of that when you decided not to have a swap partition.

Finally, I don't see any benefit in moving/deleting the previous GAP install. We'll just run into unintended consequences.

Why do we need to set '-o' at all? GAP can perfectly start with only '-m' (i.e. the initial amount of memory) set only.
'-o' is meant to set the maximal amount of RAM to be available, at least according to GAPs [docs](http://www.gap-system.org/Manuals/doc/ref/chap3.html).


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-11-17 13:37:18

If you don't specify '-o' then gap will just chose a pool size for you. The virtual memory pool address space can't be changed after GAP has started. The actual memory used can expand and contract. Of course the actual memory used is bounded by the pool size.

OK. Still, what about limiting the suggested_size to something (say, 500MB) - I agree that 150MB I suggested above is on a low side. 

Anyway, we should put somewhere in the documentation a remark that by default such-and-such max amount is allocated, but if you need more, then do `set_gap_memory_pool_size()` before doing any GAP stuff. 

By the way, can one terminate, from Sage, all the running GAP subprocesses?

I'm against absolute limits, it should be a fraction of the available resources. Otherwise you'll end up on record with "640kb is enough for everyone".

> Anyway, we should put somewhere in the documentation a remark that by default such-and-such max amount is allocated, but if you need more, then do `set_gap_memory_pool_size()` before doing any GAP stuff. 

Its in the `set_gap_memory_pool_size` docstring already.

The Sage expect interface does not keep a list of started subprocesses, so no. That would be a nice enhancement to the whole expect stuff, but please in another ticket.

I propose a limit that can be explicitly overwritten, not something absolute. The reason is that on big machines a fraction of the resource can be too big to be meaningful, and will make sharing the machine very hard, as the first few processes will grab an enormous chunk of swap, and the remaining ones will suffer.
I propose a limit that one would not even notice on a typical desktop (OK, if you think 500MB is too small, make it 750MB, or 1GB). 
And if you come to a super-duper machine to compute something huge then OK, please tell the system explicitly how much memory you might need.

As a matter of fact, I do not understand why GAP needs to **reserve** any swap at all. Just does not make sense to me. What is so special about GAP here?


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-11-24 16:12:02

By "absolute" limit I mean a fixed size (as opposed to relative to available resources). 640kb (or any other fixed amount) is not going to be good enough in the future.

The current GAP in Sage does soak up all the available swap and I don't see anybody complaining about it. It does make my desktop slow down to a crawl whenever the patchbot hits GAP, though. Maybe this patch is not the ideal solution, but its a vast improvement over what we currently have. 

As for the rest, read the mmap manpage. You either reserve swap or you get SIGSEGV when you run out of memory. And GAP is not written in a way what would handle that signal.

I had accidentally dropped the workaround for the `gap -o 3*2^31` option parser overflow, its back in the trac_13211_pool_size.patch now.

Also, seems like the reporter on sage-release didn't get GAP orphans with the old version after all.

These are cases where the hardcoded minimum for the GAP memory pool is used (since they have insufficient swap space). I'll try to find a minimal value that is sufficient to run the long doctests, not just to start up GAP.

Turns out we need 76MB for the long doctests, but we hardcoded 75MB. I've increased the minimum to 100MB to give us some headroom for future doctests. I'll see if I can reproduce the OpenSolaris bug on OpenIndiana (if anybody with access to hawk can debug it go for it, but I don't have an account). But that shouldn't stop us from shipping the update.

I am having trouble building 5.5.rc1 on hawk. It errors out for no obvious reason.

The most glaring bug is of course that OpenSolaris is a fully supported platform. https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-devel/nRVBUQtL_d4/discussion

Another unrelated issue is that setting `SAGE_DEBUG=yes` doesn't correctly set `-O0`, as it's overwritten later in the command line by an `-O2`:

```
$ SAGE_DEBUG=yes ./sage -f gap-4.5.6.p0.spkg
[...]
gcc -I. -I../.. -DCONFIG_H  -I/release/merger/sage-5.6.beta0/local/include -D__GMP_MP_RELEASE=50002 -O0 -g3 -DDEBUG_MASTERPOINTERS -DDEBUG_GLOBAL_BAGS -DDEBUG_FUNCTIONS_BAGS -Wall -g -O2   -o intfuncs.o -c ../../src/intfuncs.c

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2012-12-20 11:37:38

The "`Special Update/Build Instructions`" are quite unclear to me. I'm trying to update the package to GAP-4.5.7 but it's difficult to understand what all this means:

```
This is a stripped-down version of GAP.  The databases, which are arch
independent, are in a separate package and doc and tests are removed.

** IMPORTANT **:
   When you update this package, be sure to put the guava package
   in the package directory!!

Delete some of the documentation:
  cd doc
  rm *.bbl *.aux *.dvi *.idx *.ilg *.l* *.m* *.pdf *.toc  *.blg *.ind
  rm */*.bbl */*.aux */*.dvi */*.idx */*.ilg */*.l* */*.m* */*.pdf */*.ind */*.toc */*.blg

DATABASES (separated out to database_gap.spkg) except GAPDoc which is required:
  rm -rf small prim trans
  cd pkg
  rm -rf !(GAPDoc*)

Stuff that isn't GAP sources:
  rm -rf bin/*
  cd extern
  rm -rf !Makefile.in
```

somehow, guava, the favorite GAP package of DJ, used to enjoy a special deal. But not anymore, for a while already. This needs to be updated. 

GAP packages (a selection) go to gap_packages optional package.

I hope the rest is clear.

It's not.

When updating the sources is non-trivial, it's best to create a shell script (called `spkg-src`) which downloads and prepares `src/`.

Attachment

I have a new spkg ready which includes two patches: [attachment:cflags.patch] and [attachment:siginterrupt.patch]. The latter one fixes the OpenSolaris issue and has also been reported upstream.

Somebody else should really clarify `SPKG.txt` on how to update `src` or write a shell script to do so.


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-12-20 13:16:21

Call me an optimist, but I'm still hoping that upstream will clean up their build system and dist tarball. The layout of their dist tarball and the required packages are also in a flux, so I don't see the value of a shell script. Having said that, the instructions are written in a manner that you just have to cd into the gap* source directory and execute them. E.g. there are directories `gap4r5/small`, `gap4r5/prim`, and `gap4r5/trans`. Then by "`rm -rf small prim trans`" I mean to check that the directory layout hasn't changed and then delete these directories.

Not quite. I don't know what `rm -rf !(GAPDoc*)` is supposed to do:


```
jdemeyer@sage:~/spkg/gap-4.5.7.p0/src/pkg$ rm -rf !(GAPDoc*)
bash: !: event not found
```


Besides, if you're writing out the commands in `SPKG.txt`, you might as well create an actual shell script which is easier to use than copy/pasting the code and putting the right "cd" statements in between.

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-12-20 14:16:11

You don't like extended shell globs? Then there is no concise way to match with exceptions, I think. 

```
shopt +extglob
```

Both the mercurial and subversion bash completion scripts enable this by default.

At least some packages might have been changed (this is not in sync with the GAP releases, AFAIK).

Also, after updating with Jeroen's spkg, I still get gap.version 4.5.6, not 4.5.7.

Me, too. I verified that the upstream tarball shows the correct version (4.5.7) upon startup, so something is wrong with the spkg sources.

The `gap/latest` symlink is not correctly created, which is why the old version is still used if you installed gap-4.5.6 previously. I'll fix that, too.

I see, the by far largest computation with GAP is actually in combinat and not in the group theory stuff %-) We actually need about 220 MB, so I increased the minimum to 250 MB. I checked that make ptestlong runs without any further errors.

Dima, running the command twice probably uses values that were cached in Sage.

But I don't care very much since it seems to pass doctests...
