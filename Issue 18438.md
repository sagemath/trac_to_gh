What does `GradedConnectedHopfAlgebraOfInteger` mean? It seems like a terrible name to me. I would suggest changing it, or if not, explaining the terminology. From the name, it sounds like there is one Hopf algebra element (`t^n`) for each integer `n`. If this element is placed in degree `n`, then since `n` can be any integer (given name of the algebra), it is not connected.

I have another issue with this: the coproduct does not define a graded Hopf algebra. In a graded Hopf algebra, the Koszul sign convention comes into play, so the coproduct on `t^2` is `(1 tensor t + t tensor 1)^2 = 1 tensor (t^2) + (t^2) tensor 1`: the two `t tensor t` terms cancel. You should grade it instead by putting `t` in degree 2.

A typo: in the method `one_basis`: `EXAMPLES::r`. Delete the "r".

You should grade it instead by putting `t` in degree 2.

I agree that the name could be clearer, but I don't understand the relation to the Koszul sign convention. This example is testing the functionality of graded connected Hopf algebra and demonstrates how an example of this category should be implemented (a free combinatorial Hopf algebra with one primitive generator in degree one).  What you are describing is a quotient of the Hopf algebra that is implemented here.

I have a few more edits that I will push shortly.

When you compute `(1 tensor t + t tensor 1)^2`, there is a term `(1 tensor t) (t tensor 1)`. When these are multiplied, you have to apply the twist map (interchanging the middle two terms). That has a sign involved: `(-1)^{(deg t) (deg t)} = -1`. So you get a summand `- t tensor t` in the coproduct. This cancels with the term `(t tensor 1) (1 tensor t)`.

That is, in the main diagram defining a bialgebra, [like the first one here, for example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bialgebra), the twist map `\tau` has a sign in the graded case.

I don't think that this is an axiom of graded connected Hopf algebras since most of the ones that I work with don't have this property (e.g. symmetric functions).  Can we call it a subcategory that satisfies the additional axiom that `f \otimes g = (-1)^{deg(f) deg(g)} g \otimes f`?


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2015-09-21 18:09:12

I don't think it can be a subcategory because, unless the algebra is evenly graded, it can't satisfy both `\tau(f \otimes g) = g \otimes f` and `\tau (f \otimes g) = (-1)^{deg(f) deg(g)} g \otimes f`. We seem to have two conflicting notions of what a graded Hopf algebra is. My version comes from topology and dates back to the 1950s. The version without the sign looks to be much more recent, mainly arising (as far as I can tell) in combinatorics. In "[Hopf algebras in combinatorics](http://web.mit.edu/~darij/www/algebra/HopfComb-sols.pdf)" by Grinberg and Reiner, they at least refer (Definition 1.11, equation (1.7)) to the sign, although they have decided to omit it, saying that one can artificially double all degrees to deal with this issue.

I really will insist that this sign be one of the axioms of a graded Hopf algebra, unless you can provide citations that convince me otherwise. Your version could be called "unsigned", maybe? `UnsignedGradedHopfAlgebrasWithBasis`? `GradedUnsignedHopfAlgebrasWithBasis`?

To put it another way, one of the motivating examples (the motivating example, really) of a graded Hopf algebra is the cohomology of a Lie group. The cohomology of S<sup>1</sup> looks like H=k[t]/(t<sup>2</sup>) as an algebra, and the only way for this to become a Hopf algebra is with the sign axiom: otherwise, although t<sup>2</sup>=0, the coproduct on t<sup>2</sup> is not zero in H \otimes H.

To follow the conventions we currently have, your Hopf algebras should be called "Hopf superalgebras" or "super-Hopf algebras". Symmetric functions, as well as most other combinatorial Hopf algebras we currently have, cannot inherit from that class, due to them satisfying the sign-free bialgebra axiom. (Unless we double their degrees, but that is a totally new can of worms and incompatible with existing combinatorial literature.)

John: Please see almost any paper on combinatorial Hopf algebras for an example of signless graded Hopf algebras being used. See, for example, Theorem 3.8.3 in http://preprints.ihes.fr/2006/M/M-06-40.pdf , or Proposition 4.4 in http://home.gwu.edu/~wschmitt/papers/iha.pdf , or Theorem 5.6.4 in Radford's "Hopf algebras", or Example 2.3 in http://www.math.cornell.edu/~maguiar/a.pdf . Generally, I rarely see people double a `ZZ`-grading to make an even object work with the Koszul rule; instead they usually drop the Koszul sign rule. IMHO it is also not a good idea to require `Z`-graded superobjects to have their `Z`-grading refine their `Z/2`-grading.

And we will have super (Hopf) algebras once #18044 is finalized.

It is ridiculous if the cohomology of a Lie group is not a graded Hopf algebra. You can call it a Hopf superalgebra, but that is going against 50 years of usage, and using an unsigned version as the definition of a graded Hopf algebra will confuse many mathematicians.

When I did an internet search on "graded Hopf algebra", most of the results included the sign. (See [here](http://preprints.ihes.fr/2006/M/M-06-40.pdf) and [here](http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~mityab/bloch-hopf/), and of course there is Milnor and Moore's Annals paper.) Based on that and my own experience, I really think that we cannot use `GradedHopfAlgebra` to mean an unsigned version. It's obviously fine to implement the mathematical concept, but don't call it a graded Hopf algebra.

I'm not so keen on the use of `UnsignedGraded/GradedUnsigned` because outside of this thread it is just unclear what about a Hopf algebra is signed, but perhaps `GradedCombinatorialHopfAlgebra` vs. `GradedTopologicalHopfAlgebra` are more descriptive terms.  It seems equally strange to me to not call the symmetric functions a graded Hopf algebra (although I can totally get on board with `GradedCombinatorialHopfAlgebra`).  Here I thought that a graded Hopf algebra was just a Hopf algebra which is graded...surprise!

John: It is far from clear that Cartier uses your convention. He does state some properties of super-Hopf algebras, without ever giving them a name. Then, in ยง3, he defines a Hopf algebra in a way that does not involve any super-structure. Maybe it is implicit in the twist map, but I don't see much of a reason to assume it. In ยง4.1, Cartier gives an example of "a graded Hopf algebra which is both commutative and cocommutative", which only works if he does not use the Koszul sign rule. (Or does he ever mention that he doubles degrees? As far as I understand, he does not, and `Ch_1` is understood as the degree-1 component.)

I am not sure whether topologists are assuming the Koszul sign rule all the time or only when they like it. But Hopf algebras haven't just been the topologists' game for at least 20 years now. If you asked me for an authoritative source on Hopf algebras, I'd probably come up with Sweedler, Radford, Abe (in some order). Neither of them seems to impose the Koszul sign rule on graded Hopf algebras.

I can't speak for all topologists, but when I've seen graded Hopf algebras, the sign convention has always been used.

> But Hopf algebras haven't just been the topologists' game for at least 20 years now.

You're making my point for me. I'm not saying that Hopf algebras are just the topologists' game. Instead I'm saying that Hopf algebras are not just the combinatorialists' game, and so we need to use the terminology in a way that excludes nobody. Don't just use the combinatorial language and ignore the Koszul sign rule. Mike's proposal (`GradedCombinatorialHopfAlgebra`, `GradedTopologicalHopfAlgebra`) is a good solution.

Some comments about this last push.
(a) side note: [I had issues with compiling and pushing on the same copy of sage](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/sage-devel/JMlLXGDCAy4).
(b) I could not make the line `S(x) := -\sum_{x^L\neq x} S(x^L) \times x^R` work so I changed it to `S(x) := -\sum_{x^L!=x} S(x^L) \cdot x^R`.  For some reason the latex interpreter does not recognize `\neq` or `\times`...I fought with it for over an hour and just gave up.
(c) I was not able to make `\begin{dcases*}...\end{dcases*}` work so I changed it to `\begin{cases}...\end{cases}`.
(d) When I added the example to the categories section of the reference manual I noticed that the `finite_dimensional_algebras_with_basis` example was not in the list so I added it as well.
(e) I changed the name of the example Hopf algebra from `GradedConnectedHopfAlgebraOfInteger` to `GradedConnectedCombinatorialHopfAlgebraWithPrimitiveGenerator`.  We could yet add an example of a `GradedConnectedTopologicalHopfAlgebra` to the same file.

Missing an "r" at the beginning of the quotes for the docstring? If so, then the `\t` in `\times` would be interpreted as a tab, `\n` in `\neq` as a newline.
