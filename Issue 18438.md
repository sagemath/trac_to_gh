What does `GradedConnectedHopfAlgebraOfInteger` mean? It seems like a terrible name to me. I would suggest changing it, or if not, explaining the terminology. From the name, it sounds like there is one Hopf algebra element (`t^n`) for each integer `n`. If this element is placed in degree `n`, then since `n` can be any integer (given name of the algebra), it is not connected.

I have another issue with this: the coproduct does not define a graded Hopf algebra. In a graded Hopf algebra, the Koszul sign convention comes into play, so the coproduct on `t^2` is `(1 tensor t + t tensor 1)^2 = 1 tensor (t^2) + (t^2) tensor 1`: the two `t tensor t` terms cancel. You should grade it instead by putting `t` in degree 2.

A typo: in the method `one_basis`: `EXAMPLES::r`. Delete the "r".

I can't speak for all topologists, but when I've seen graded Hopf algebras, the sign convention has always been used.

> But Hopf algebras haven't just been the topologists' game for at least 20 years now.

You're making my point for me. I'm not saying that Hopf algebras are just the topologists' game. Instead I'm saying that Hopf algebras are not just the combinatorialists' game, and so we need to use the terminology in a way that excludes nobody. Don't just use the combinatorial language and ignore the Koszul sign rule. Mike's proposal (`GradedCombinatorialHopfAlgebra`, `GradedTopologicalHopfAlgebra`) is a good solution.

Some comments about this last push.
(a) side note: [I had issues with compiling and pushing on the same copy of sage](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/sage-devel/JMlLXGDCAy4).
(b) I could not make the line `S(x) := -\sum_{x^L\neq x} S(x^L) \times x^R` work so I changed it to `S(x) := -\sum_{x^L!=x} S(x^L) \cdot x^R`.  For some reason the latex interpreter does not recognize `\neq` or `\times`...I fought with it for over an hour and just gave up.
(c) I was not able to make `\begin{dcases*}...\end{dcases*}` work so I changed it to `\begin{cases}...\end{cases}`.
(d) When I added the example to the categories section of the reference manual I noticed that the `finite_dimensional_algebras_with_basis` example was not in the list so I added it as well.
(e) I changed the name of the example Hopf algebra from `GradedConnectedHopfAlgebraOfInteger` to `GradedConnectedCombinatorialHopfAlgebraWithPrimitiveGenerator`.  We could yet add an example of a `GradedConnectedTopologicalHopfAlgebra` to the same file.

Missing an "r" at the beginning of the quotes for the docstring? If so, then the `\t` in `\times` would be interpreted as a tab, `\n` in `\neq` as a newline.
