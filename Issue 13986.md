Keywords: @cached_method

Some functions in schemes.elliptic_curves.ell_rational_field.py that implement caching were written before the ``@`cached_method` decorator came to be, for example the `modular_degree()` method: 


```
def modular_degree(self, algorithm='sympow'):
    r"""
    ...
    """
    try:
            return self.__modular_degree
       
    except AttributeError:
        ...
```


This patch would rework those functions to use ``@`cached_method` and eliminate the unnecessary try/except clauses etc.

On discussion with WAS we decided that the current caching methods in ell_rational_field.py exist for a good reason, and should not be changed.
