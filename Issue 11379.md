Keywords: pari

In both Windows XP and Window 7 it is now possible (again) to build Sage on Cygwin.  However, Sage has a segmentation fault in Pari upon startup.  

This happens in initalizing the Pynac i (`init_pynac_I` in sage/symbolic/pynac.pyx), but the final thing is that the mpfr number 1.00000000000 causes the segfault upon running the `._pari_()` method.  Suggestions as to why that would be - and a potential fix - are welcome.

hmm, you should be able to just copy the thing with your mouse and paste...

perhaps, running in an better terminal window, such as mintty : http://code.google.com/p/mintty/

Well, building on Cygwin is not exactly straightforward, and (at least for me) extremely time-consuming, so I wanted to make sure I had as bleeding-edge of code as possible to catch potential problems.

I put in print statements at every conceivable place.  Here is as far as it gets:

```
    def _pari_(self):
<snip comments/docs>
        sig_on()
        if mpfr_nan_p(self.value) or mpfr_inf_p(self.value):
            raise ValueError, 'Cannot convert NaN or infinity to Pari float'

        # wordsize for PARI
        cdef unsigned long wordsize = sizeof(long)*8

        cdef int prec
        prec = (<RealField_class>self._parent).__prec

        # We round up the precision to the nearest multiple of wordsize.
        cdef int rounded_prec
        rounded_prec = (self.prec() + wordsize - 1) & ~(wordsize - 1)

        # Yes, assigning to self works fine, even in Pyrex.
        if rounded_prec > prec:
            self = RealField(rounded_prec)(self)

        cdef mpz_t mantissa
        cdef mp_exp_t exponent
        cdef GEN pari_float

        if mpfr_zero_p(self.value):
            pari_float = real_0_bit(-rounded_prec)
        else:
            # Now we can extract the mantissa, and it will be normalized
            # (the most significant bit of the most significant word will be 1).
            mpz_init(mantissa)
            exponent = mpfr_get_z_exp(mantissa, self.value)
 
WE GET HERE AND NO FURTHER
           
            # Create a PARI REAL
            pari_float = cgetr(2 + rounded_prec / wordsize)
            mpz_export(&pari_float[2], NULL, 1, wordsize/8, 0, 0, mantissa)
            mpz_clear(mantissa)
            setexpo(pari_float, exponent + rounded_prec - 1)
            setsigne(pari_float, mpfr_sgn(self.value))
        
        cdef PariInstance P
        P = sage.libs.pari.all.pari
        return P.new_gen(pari_float)
```
Since 

```

    # level1.h (incomplete!)
    
    GEN     cgetg_copy(long lx, GEN x)
    GEN     cgetg(long x, long y)
    GEN     cgeti(long x)
    GEN     cgetr(long x)
    long    itos(GEN x)
    GEN     real_0_bit(long bitprec)
    GEN     stoi(long s)
```
so `cgetr` is indeed from level1.h, which is where the `sage -gdb` backtrace ends up before raising the interrupt.   What would get that to have problems?

Also attaching screenshot of the traceback.

A little further "print"-ing revealed that that cgetr is the problem.   By the way, `2 + rounded_prec / wordsize = 2 + 64/32 = 4`.

What does 

```
cgetr (x=(value optimized out))
```
mean?  Does this mean that the Pari float will always have the same precision no matter what?

```
rings/qqbar.py:5800:    QQbar_I_nf = QuadraticField(-1, 'I', embedding=CC.gen())

which also causes the identical problem.

And `_init_qqbar` in `sage/all.py` seems like a fairly big thing to try to work around, even in testing.   But commenting this out as well does allow Sage to start!

Some things to try:

1. The new PARI spkg from #11130.
2. Compiling PARI with SAGE_DEBUG=yes and posting a backtrace again.

First "result" (i.e., I don't know yet why `pari_error()` is called at all, but see below):

Debugging this *bottom-up*, according to your nice screen shot the segfault originates from:

```C
static void
err_init(void)
{
  /* make sure pari_err msg starts at the beginning of line */
  if (!pari_last_was_newline()) pari_putc('\n');
  pariOut->flush(); /***** THIS SEGFAULTS *****/
  pariErr->flush();
  pariOut = pariErr;
  term_color(c_ERR);
}
```

So obviously `pariOut` (and most probably also `pariErr`) aren't properly initialized at that point. (Note that line 885 in the vanilla PARI sources is the assignment statement, but we patch `src/src/language/init.c` such that we get an offset of +2 lines.)

PARI error number 14 is "`errpile`" (i.e. heap / [PARI] stack error), which is most probably raised for the same reason, namely because the PARI stack apparently isn't [yet] initialized when `cgetr()` gets called.

For the moment, it's up to someone else to donate his/her 2 ct or more... ;-)

I have no idea why `real_mpfr`[`.pyx`] shouldn't initialize [the] PARI [library] (i.e., the `pari_instance` variable defined in `sage/libs/pari/gen.pyx`), but you (Karl-Dieter) could verify it gets initialized by putting some print statement(s) into `PariInstance`'s `__init__()`, preferably (also) around `pari_init_opts()`, to make sure the latter really gets called, because of

```python
        if bot:
            return  # pari already initialized.
```

There are a few things that might be relevant here:

* Cython doesn't support C `enum` constants (here e.g. `INIT_DFTm`), therefore one has to declare them as `cdef extern int`s, but I don't think that's the problem here.

* `bot` is a very bad name for a global variable (of a *library*!), i.e. some other library / module might use the same for a different purpose, such that the one supposed to be PARI's may actually already have some non-zero value despite PARI not yet being initialized.

It's not far enough along to try these, but here's something naive.

```
        cdef GEN pari_float
<snip>
        else:
<snip>
            # Create a PARI REAL
            pari_float = cgetr(2 + rounded_prec / wordsize)
 <snip>
        cdef PariInstance P
        P = sage.libs.pari.all.pari
        return P.new_gen(pari_float)
```
So it looks like the GEN gets defined before the PariInstance - is that a problem for some reason?  Again, this is totally naive, and probably wrong since this works everywhere else.

I don't know how you managed that ;-) but you should be able to just reinstall the "old" PARI (2.4.3.alpha.p7) at least (assuming you also have a Sage branch without #11130's patches applied, though these only change doctests IIRC).

If you think something may get mixed up with a previous installation, you can also

```sh
$ rm -rf $SAGE_ROOT/local/include/pari/
$ rm $SAGE_ROOT/local/lib/libpari*
$ rm $SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/{libpari,gp}*
```
before reinstalling the PARI package.
(And perhaps also run `./sage -ba-force` after you've reinstalled it.)

> I didn't know what the `#0` error was, so I just started at `#1`, which at least I could interpret [...]


No idea what the `#0` and `#1` refer to... 




> So it looks like the GEN gets defined before the PariInstance - is that a problem for some reason?


No. The weird trailer just explicitly uses the one and only global "`PariInstance`" `pari_instance` alias `P` alias `sage.libs.pari.gen.pari` alias `sage.libs.pari.all.pari` (which should get initialized as soon as you import from that module (`sage.libs.pari.gen`), which is done far above in `real_mpfr.pyx`), because `new_gen()` is only available as a member function (or "method") of an instance, for whatever reason.

```
  if (x > (avma-bot) / sizeof(long)) pari_err(errpile);

Okay, inserting appropriate print statements gives

```
Got to first line of PariInsstance init
Got beyond 'if bot' of PariInstance init instead
Got beyond 'pari_init_opts'
Got here
Got to just before pari_float

which can be interpreted as
* Pari was initialized

by either the new PARI added in 4.6 or the new interrupt handling 
code.  I have a clean backtrace for this, but I haven't delved into it 
yet. 
```
I wonder whether it would be possible to easily remove the "new interrupt handling code" from a current installation.  Or worth it...  I wouldn't even attempt to build 4.5.x with all other spkgs 'correct for Cygwin', as there probably would be nasty dependency issues...

`bot == 0` is certainly very bad and is surely the cause of the segfault.  It would be great if you could figure out why `bot` is set to zero.

Hmm, okay.  So here is what I discovered so far: 
* The PariInstance init is called well before the Pynac initialization.
* In the PariInstance init, the actual deep copy is called three times, and all is well.
* I am able to insert a statement like 

```
print "bot is now", bot
```
   in `real_mpfr.pyx`.
* I am **not** allowed to do this in other files where PariInstance is imported, such as `matrix/matrix_integer_dense.pyx`.  On the very reasonable grounds that 

```
undeclared name not builtin:bot
```

Well!  So why the heck is `real_mpfr.pyx` allowing me to insert this print statement in the first place?   It seems like this is why bot is causing problems - it shouldn't even be defined.  Nowhere else in that file is bot used, other than in my print statements, as far as I could tell.

Anyway, in integer.pyx, Cython doesn't complain about this, and to my surprise bot is already 0 there!

Let's look at the relevant order in sage/all.py:

```
<snip>
from sage.libs.all       import *  # here is where Pari gets imported, and hence the PariInstance

from sage.rings.all      import * # here is where integer.pyx presumably is initialized and bot is already zero
from sage.matrix.all     import *

# This must come before Calculus -- it initializes the Pynac library.
import sage.symbolic.pynac # here is where the symptom turned up while initializing the square root of -1
```

I'll try to look into this a little more now, otherwise more tomorrow.

Okay, here is what happens in a normal Sage build (OS X, Sage 4.7):

```

So somehow Pari is initialized, bot is created, and then other stuff happens including doing integer.pyx **all before we actually get to the top of `complex_double`**, even though we are importing from `complex_double`!

I think this is because the C file generated by Cython imports a lot of stuff ahead of translating the things that actually happen from `complex_double.pyx`.  But at this point I'm out of my depth.  

Can someone look in `complex_double.c` to see where Pari would first be initialized (and then where integer.pyx/integer.c would be invoked, precisely ONCE)?    For instance, close to the top there is 

```

#include "pari/paricfg.h"
#include "pari/pari.h"
#include "pari/paripriv.h"
#include "stdsage.h"
#include "interrupt.h"
#include "complex.h"
#include "ntl_wrap.h"
#include "ZZ_pylong.h"
```
but I have no idea whether that is relevant.  There is also more than one place where I see

```
* cdef class PariInstance(sage.structure.parent_base.ParentWithBase):             # <<<<<<<<<<<<<<
```
in things coming from other files which are imported, I guess.  The stretch around 1430 seems most likely

You're "allowed" to print `bot` in some of the Cython files because they include `.../pari/decl.pxi` which declares it, e.g.:

```sh
$ grep "pari/decl" devel/sage/sage/rings/*
devel/sage/sage/rings/complex_double.pxd:include '../libs/pari/decl.pxi'

The value of `bot` (the lower / start address of PARI's stack) seems quite large, both on Cygwin and MacOS X.

`init_stack()` has some flaws, but these shouldn't be the cause of your problem.

The assignments to `pariOut` etc. and the `pari_free()` call are harmless; they don't allocate anything and cannot fail.

You can try to start `sage` with `-min` (bypassing a lot of imports), do

```
sage: from sage.libs.pari import *
```
and play with the PARI library, to see if that works.

Btw., `complex_number.pyx` doesn't import `sage.libs.pari`[`.all`] although it uses it.

Sorry, not of much help I guess.

Just curious, do you run Cygwin on a 32-bit Windows / machine?

Also, `bot==0` isn't sufficient to cause the stack overflow, since `(avma-0) / sizeof(long)` should certainly be larger than `x` in `new_chunk(size_t x)` (unless `avma` is that large that it is interpreted as a negative number), so apparently `avma` gets corrupted as well (as `bot` and `pariOut` appear to).

But it would perhaps be helpful to print `bot`, `top` and `avma` after `init_stack()` has been called (in `gen.pyx`).

Maybe we should just fix the buggy `init_stack()`, though that doesn't explain why `bot` gets zero (and perhaps `sage_pariOut` also corrupted). I also wonder why this doesn't cause problems on other systems.

Yes, I saw that comment, but I'm still fixing the old builds to try to test this.  `./sage -ba-force` takes a long time on a VM, and I don't want to comment out "I" and "qqbar" on the newest build where I have all the print statements to try to fix this bug.

However, that said, I don't recall that being one of the files that caused problems when I tested before (with no maximalib/ECLlib and no I or qqbar).

Well, I guess it's 64-bit but not 64-bit

```
  64-bit Kernel and Extensions:	No
```
So the processor is 64-bit, but not the kernel (whatever that difference is), and I don't have 64-bit on.  In any case, the Parallels is running XP, and I checked and it is definitely a 32-bit version of XP.

I assume `top` and `avma` are 2121924616 + 16000000 = 2137924616, or `bot` is 2105924616; otherwise this would be the first error.

Just before the `0`s appear, the 'deep copy to Python heap' is called and avma goes down to ...600 instead of 616.  The others are the same.  

Then we have zeros, also in the other things while importing CDF. 

But the next time the deep copy in gen.pyx is called, avma is back to normal, down to 588 (later up to 592 when a `new_gen` is created).

So it seems that it might indeed be happening one of those places where `avma` is reset in `complex_double.pyx`?  Presumably not the special function ones.

---
Random?  But why is it so reliable then, and on different computers/versions of Windows?    (Unless the importing of randstate did it, but I don't think that's what you meant, and I don't think this has `avma` or `bot` or `top`.)

---
The real problem is that I can't dump values of these variables while the pyx files are being imported, because editing the pyx file `complex_double` won't do that until after they are all imported.  And I can't dump them from places where they aren't defined - precious few, really.    

Really needing that import hook thingie.

these global variables in Windows DDLs... IMHO they need a special treatment: search for "global" here:

AFAIR, I saw this on my 32-bit Win7, too. IMHO, it's a Cygwin improvement that is to credit.

By the way, I have strange problems with my new 64-bit Win7, Sage install does not get past bzip2. Or is bzip2 supposed to come from Cygwin natively? Perhaps the toolchain is broken?

I use the latest Cygwin. Does it still need a manual fix in that libtool or autoconf or what was that?

I don't know... the problem was that updating from the gcc4 default package (4.3.stg) to the 4.5.stg "forgot" to update some pathes in configuration files in the postinst script.
The latest 4.5 package seems to be from october 2011, so I doubt the problem has been fixed.
