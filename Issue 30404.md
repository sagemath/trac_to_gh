So far, `G.edges()` returns a sorted list of edges. So the test `E == F` is simply a lexicographic comparison of lists, omitting the time to extract and sort the list of edges. The reporting time comparison is therefore not completely fair.

Furthermore, since the switch to Python3, we can no longer rely on sorted list of edges (vertices and edge labels may be of different types, leading to an error when trying to sort the list). One objective is to deprecate this behavior.

I think that the only way to speed up the test `G == H`, is to speed up the test `other.has_edge(...)`.

But of course it would be better to improve the backends to get faster edge iterator, edge membership tests, equality test, etc.

To check whether one `CGraph` is contained in another one can store a translation array at the beginning. If you can guarantee that the vertices match, you can of course skip this step.

After this initial step is pretty much the same as #30665. Just that you check `has_arc_unsafe` of other instead of yield. Things are a bit more complicated for multiple edges.

If you can guarantee the vertices to match, things should be really fast for dense graphs, but of course only, if you are somewhat dense (e.g. if `n <= 64`). Here you can just immediately compare to vertices.

Things are improving, I think.

IMO what would still improve things here:
- better heuristics for vertex translation to `int`,
- factor out the backends to standard backends and backends with vertices in `range(n)` (we could still have active vertices or not, but all vertices need to be in `range(n)`, if you add a new vertex that is too large, you will get a memory problem, but that is your problem),
- implement specialized versions of `is_subgraph` and `subgraph_given_vertices` for dense graphs over `range(n)` (we need a good name for this graph backend yet), this should be much faster than the current methods

So instead of just `CGraphBackend` we would have `CGraphBackend`, `CGraphVertices` and `CGraphRangeVertices` (not good names yet). `DenseGraphBackend` as we know it would have to inherit from `CGraphBackend` and `CGraphVertices` and `DenseGraphBackendRangeVertices` would have to inherit from `CGraphBackend` and `CGraphRangeVertices`. Likewise for sparse and static sparse.

Does this sound plausible?

Does anyone have good suggestions for a naming scheme?

Btw, dense graphs should really use bitsets. I don't understand why it isn't. Eventually this might be sped up with intrinsics. E.g. an iterator over a bitset should be much faster with an improved leading zero count (`_lzcnt_u64`).

I don't know if it's better to use bitsets for dense graphs. In case, we can use `src/sage/data_structures/binary_matrix.<pxi|pxd>`.

This is how `DisjointSet` (union-find data structure) is implemented in Sage.

```
def DisjointSet(arg):
cdef class DisjointSet_class(SageObject):
cdef class DisjointSet_of_integers(DisjointSet_class):
cdef class DisjointSet_of_hashables(DisjointSet_class):
```

in the sense that `DisjointSet_of_integers` uses directly the internal representation and `DisjointSet_of_hashables` uses maps from integers in range(n) to the hashable objects and vice versa. See https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/develop/src/sage/sets/disjoint_set.pyx

I don't know if the naming scheme `_of_integers` and `_of_hashables` I chosen at the time is good or not.
