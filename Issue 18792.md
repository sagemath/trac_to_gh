This includes Booleans at the moment:


```
sage: True, False
(int(True), int(False))
```

Yep. `bool` is a subtype of `int`. One should replace `isinstance(obj, int)` with `type(obj) is int`.

Too many doctest failures to fix in one go. Probably need
* way to switch it on/off per directory
* a doctest marker `# pyint` to allow python ints
Also, do we really want to print ints differently; Maybe only in doctest mode?

Note that the switch can easily be done with `sage -fixdoctests`.

+1 for doctest mode only. There are a lot of very used Python functions/methods that will still return Python int

```
sage: [1,2,3,1,2,1].count(2)
2
sage: len([1,1,1])
3
sage: "hahaheho".find("he")
4
```

It would be too verbose to me to have `int(...)` everywhere.

`int(1)` is consistent with the fact that you can rebuild objects from the string with `sage_eval`. That suggests a lighter marker: `1r`. What do you think?

Agreed.

But what that would mean? That the developer writes a testable example like


```
sage: foo()
int(42)
```


and the user will try `foo()` and get `42`? For a beginner it would be confusing. And for advanced user maybe irritating.


---

Comment by kcrisman created at 2015-08-14 19:12:51

Oh, what I meant was that end users should not see the `int(42)` at all unless they are testing.  But that may be an uninformed point.

Comment by ncohen created at 2015-08-15 07:34:18

Scuse me but is there any motivation for doing this for int only? What about long? What about float? Why would we only have a specific policy for int and not for other numerical python types?


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2015-08-15 17:52:02

Float should be treated analogously, but not on this ticket.

`long` is gone in Python 3 so its going to go solve itself eventually.

BTW I don't think that we always have to return Sage ints; E.g. if a Python int/float is used as a label then I don't really care. But Sage functions that *count* something should return Sage integers as that number has a combinatorial / number theoretic meaning. Similarly, Sage functions that perform a machine-precision floating-point computation should return RDF.

... which already goes wrong on a rather fundamental level with a `__len__` (which _counts_ the number of elements), which is mandated in python to return a machine-length integer to fit in the protocol it is for, and for efficiency reasons should return an `int` to avoid an extra conversion when `len(...)` is used.


```
sage: class A(object):
....:     def __len__(self):
....:         return 10^40
....:     
sage: a=A()
sage: len(a)
OverflowError: Python int too large to convert to C long
sage: a.__len__()
10000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```


I think this makes is rather hard to formulate a clear rule for when an `Integer` should really be returned.

So should this ticket be closed as wontfix? And maybe add something to developer manual.

To avoid that this ends in nothing. What about
- adding an something like --show-pyint / --show-pyfloat as an option for doctesting (not enabled by default) and maybe
- adding to the developer guide "you are encouraged to return Sage integers (instead of Python integers) unless ..... . The option --show-pyint might be useful."

That will just cause doctest failures, so it's a bad idea.

Not by default. And at least one can test individual files if they are fine.

It will still cause doctest failures not by default, so it's still a bad idea.

Should this be closed as wontfix? The basic problem seems to be that we have no common view of what to do.

(Except that I had made an error where `X.foo()` returned python int `1` when `X` was a special case and Sage Integer `n` otherwise. It was catch by ncohen. For this I think we all have same view: output type should be same in both cases.)

As mentioned above, I would be very happy to be able to turn it on on request, so that I can check my new code gives the types I intended. Since a doctesting-option seemed to be refused; any other ideas how this could be achieved?

Hmm... Is it possible to have some kind of debug mode, so that every output would be started with type? But I can see no easy way to do it. A decorator over `__repr__` somehow?

Of course for a one function you could have a test block


```
g1 = Graph({})  # Empty
g2 = Graph({1:[2]})  # Not empty
type(g1.order()) == type(g2.order())
```


and so on. But the basic question remains: is it an error to have, for example, poset `width()` and `height()` return a different type? Should every `cardinality()`-like function return Sage Integers, and if so, what to do with `len` etc.?

I think the only sensible option is to have doctests like

```
sage: a = my_function()
sage: a
42
sage: parent(a)
Integer Ring
```

OK. And because three months have gone, I suggest that we close this ticket. Click to positive_review if you agree.
