Hi Nathann,

I am not sure I would be able to do the full review. Nevertheless, you can can speed up **a lot** the function `find_wilson_decomposition` using the fact that if a TD(k,n) exists then we have the inequality `k <= n+1`. Here is a sample version of what can be done:

```
def find_wilson_decomposition(k,n):
    # we can start from k-1 since we need a TD(k+1,t)
    for t in range(max(1,k-1),n-1):
        u = n%t
        # We ensure that 1<=u and
        # u <= k-2 since we need a TD(k,u)
        if u == 0 or u <= k-2:
            continue

        m = n//t

        # k < m+2 since we need a TD(k,m)
        if k >= m+2:
            break

        if (transversal_design(k  ,m  , availability=True) and
            transversal_design(k  ,m+1, availability=True) and
            transversal_design(k+1,t  , availability=True) and
            transversal_design(k  ,u  , availability=True)):
            return k,m,t,u

    return False
```


You can check that there is no stupid call to `find_wilson_decomposition` with the following

```
sage: from sage.combinat.designs.orthogonal_arrays import find_wilson_decomposition
sage: find_wilson_decomposition(7,71)
(7, 8, 8, 7)
sage: find_wilson_decomposition.get_cache() # get the list of cached values
...
```

Hi Nathann,

Brett Stevens is in sabatical in Bordeaux and explains me in full details the Wilson construction. Good news: I have enough background to starts seriously the review.

1) There is a much simpler construction than the Wilson one, often called the Kronecker product, which from a TD(k,t) and a TD(k,n) builds a TD(k,nt) (this is basically the case u=0 in Wilson construction). We found that Wilson construction does not apply to a TD(3,6) but the Kronecker product does! Do you prefer opening a new ticket or including it in this one?

2) The programming design with TD calling OA is very bad. In OA there is a nice `EmptySetError` which has an important mathematical meaning. But if you ask for a transversal design you get instead a `NotImplementedError` which is much less informative

```
sage: designs.orthogonal_array(6,3)   # this is great
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
EmptySetError: No Orthogonal Array exists when k>=n+t
sage: designs.transversal_design(6,3)  # this is bad
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
NotImplementedError: I don't know how to build this Transversal Design!
```

In the ideal world, Sage would only return a design or raise an `EmptySetError` with a meaningful message mentionning a theorem. And I learned from Brett that there exist several situations where we know mathematically that a TD(k,n) does not exist. When `availability=True` it would be nice to get a troolean: True (means yes), False (means no), Unknown in `sage.misc.unknown` (means I do not know). And then, you might change the name `availability` to `existence`.

3) The loop where you test the Wilson construction is 2.86 seconds on my (dual core) computer. I am not sure it deserves a `# long time`.

4) Could you mention the following reference as a todo
- AUTHOR = Colbourn, Charles J. and Dinitz, Jeffrey H.
- TITLE = Making the MOLS table
- BOOKTITLE = Computational and constructive design theory
- SERIES = Math. Appl.
- VOLUME = 368
- PAGES = 67--134
- PUBLISHER = Kluwer Acad. Publ., Dordrecht
- YEAR = 1996
They have a slightly improved Wilson construction for u=1, 2 that requires less material (ie not four full smaller TDs)... and hence gives more cases where the construction applies.

Cheers,
Vincent

Good news: I have enough background to starts seriously the review.\n\nAhahaha. Well you must have more background that I have then, I am jealous `:-P`\n\n> 1) There is a much simpler construction than the Wilson one, often called the Kronecker product, which from a TD(k,t) and a TD(k,n) builds a TD(k,nt) (this is basically the case u=0 in Wilson construction). We found that Wilson construction does not apply to a TD(3,6) but the Kronecker product does! Do you prefer opening a new ticket or including it in this one?\n\nI would say open a new ticket because this ticket does not only implement Wilson's construction, it also adds some \"availability\" flags to constructors and thus this ticket is a dependency for several others. Hence if we implement it in another ticket the other ones can be reviewed in the meantime.\n\nI also got word from Julian Abel that the Wilson Decomposition I implemented was not the best one, and that some variants may be useful.

Yo !

> Brett Stevens is in sabatical in Bordeaux and explains me in full details the Wilson  construction. Good news: I have enough background to starts seriously the review.

Ahahaha. Well you must have more background that I have then, I am jealous `:-P`

> 1) There is a much simpler construction than the Wilson one, often called the Kronecker product, which from a TD(k,t) and a TD(k,n) builds a TD(k,nt) (this is basically the case u=0 in Wilson construction). We found that Wilson construction does not apply to a TD(3,6) but the Kronecker product does! Do you prefer opening a new ticket or including it in this one?

I would say open a new ticket because this ticket does not only implement Wilson's construction, it also adds some "availability" flags to constructors and thus this ticket is a dependency for several others. Hence if we implement it in another ticket the other ones can be reviewed in the meantime.

I also got word from Julian Abel that the Wilson Decomposition I implemented was not the best one, and that some variants may be useful. I copy/paste what he told me here (he probably will not mind)


```
I note from  your list of  known MOLS that you've used Wilson's theorem with 1 truncated group, but not more.  The next most important variants are
where there are (1) 2 truncated groups (2) 1 spike block or 1 truncated group and a spike. These variants are as follows:

Theorem 1: If  there are k+2 MOLS(t),    and k MOLS(s) for s=g, g+1, g+2, u_1, u_2,  where 0 \leq u_1, u_2 \leq t, then there are k MOLS(gt + u_1 + u_2).
Theorem 2: If  there are k+x MOLS(t),     and k MOLS(s) for s=g, g+1, g+x,  g+x,  where 0  \leq u_1,   u_2 \leq t, x> 0 then there are k MOLS(gt +  x).
Theorem 3: If  there are k+x+1 MOLS(t),  and k MOLS(s) for s=g, g+1, g+2, g+x, u_1,  where 0 \ leq  u_1  \leq t, x > 0, then there are k MOLS(gt + x + u_1).

For instance, Th. 1 gives 6 MOLS for v=106 = 7. 13 + 7 + 8.  Theorem 2 gives 7 MOLS(v) for v=155 = 8.19 + 3. And Theorem 3 gives 6 MOLS(v) for v=148= 7.19 + 6 + 9.

Actually, the product construction is what you are doing in #16227. You can see it as a particular case of Wilson construction.

I would better say not calling OA appropriately. line 79

```
    elif orthogonal_array(k,n, check = False, availability = True):
       ...
```

I still found that having half of the implementation in TD and half of the implementation in OA is very confusing.

It is. You do not know your troolean algebra !?

I will jump in here.  Julian Able's other versions of Wilson's construction are the ones discussed in the Colbourn and Dinitz reference.  I was wrong about the details when I chatted with Vincent: I said they simplified when $u$ was a nice value, but your posted email from Julian reminds me that these are multiple truncations.  I do not think these need to go into a first round.  I would advocate getting the basic Wilson's theorem into the official Sage release and then adding more intricate variations

With regards to the product construction, I think that when Wilson's construction is passed $u=0$ then it should not check that TD$(k+1,t)$, TD$(k,u)$, TD$(k,m+1)$ exist at all.  It should check that TD(k,t)$ and $TD(k,m)$ exist and call the product construction.  Then in your find_wilson_decomposition you should also include $u=0$ in the search loops

I am waiting for sage to compile, then I will get the new commit and look more closely at the code.

Here are some additional thoughts that apply to the whole TD/OA enterprise rather than just this patch (If I should be discussing these things somewhere else because they are more general comments then please let me know and point me to where to have this discussion)

- (anticipating ticket #16231) the OA/TD/MOLS object should have a single internal format and then constructor operations to output other equivalent objects.  I think OA is the most general since it can have arbitrary $t$ (Which TD does not) and arbitrary $\lambda$ (which MOLS cannot have), etc.  I think all internal operations should be done on OAs; that is all constructions are as OAs.  Then the object should be able to output a TD or MOLS as alternatives.

Yes. It is possible to have that in #16227: we can replace the two functions with one. But I am not sure it would be faster/clearer.

True. But on the other hand
- it is very hard to see what belongs to the OA/TD/MOLS and in few times it will be hard to understand what happens to your input
- the `EmptySetError` raised in OA would also makes sense inside the TD. It is better to do trivial check on the input before digging for a construction. So if we want efficient code, we will have to copy paste all sanity checks

I do not think it is abstraction for abstraction’s sake to have an single internal format. When this gets turned into a class of its own with internal methods, etc. (later, not now) then it will need to have a single internal data structure.  For example incidence structures (and by extension, designs) are stored as their sets of sets.  The incidence matrix is equivalent but it is not a separate object with its own construction methods distinct from incidence structures.  In addition to Vincint's comments, a single internal format allows

- a single place to check all known non-existence results

- future ease in making this a class

In principle I do not mind if the constructions that you have implemented for TDs stay as they are but are wrapped by OA->TD translation TD construction followed by TD-OA translation.  It can be left as a possible future task to clean this up.

It is true, but if it means that implementing constructions becomes harder, this is too much to pay. Really, give it a try. Today is a holiday, and I have been implementing constructions since I woke up. It is *HARD* and painful.

What if both functions could be called in two ways:

1) with just parameters (like Wilson is now) , in which case the program checks if the relevant TD/OAs exist and uses them

2) with the relevant TD/OAs passed to the routine (as Product is now), in which case the program checks that they are correct and have the needed parameters and uses them if they are.

Python and thus Sage, is good at this kind of flexibility in function calling and in design theory we often want to use specific "ingredients" with property $P$, in a construction and hope/prove that the resulting object had property $P$ as well.

Yepyep, we can make the designs be optional parameters indeed ...

Really I don't mind but I am writing construction code and there is a lot of work to do. If you want features like that, would you mind implementing them ? It is not a lot of work, you just have to add optional parameters in Wilson's construction equal to None, and if they are set to None Sage will find the designs itself otherwise it will use those that are provided.
