Keywords: function field

Several methods in the new function field code (Trac #22982) can be profitably moved to superclasses, including:

- divisor, divisor_of_zeros, divisor_of_poles methods for both elements and ideals

- place and is_prime methods in ideals

- space_of_differentials method in FunctionField

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/26991

Most of the changes I proposed in the ticket description have already been done, but the element methods haven't been refactored, so that's all this ticket is now.  It's important to get it done, though, because I have another ticket that depends on this refactorization.

I didn't make any changes to `is_prime`; even though I think it should throw `NotImplementedError` for classes where it isn't implemented.  Maybe that's another ticket.
