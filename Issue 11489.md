Answer from upstream:

```
Dear Jeroen,

Thank you for telling us about this. We will take care about this in 
the GAP 4.5.2 (aka 2nd beta) on which we're working now. 

Actually, these files only make sense in the Windows binary distribution,
so the source distro does not need to have them at all.

Best wishes,
Alexander
```

Well, although the first commit message contains the second, the second doesn't contain a ticket number, and the last changeset isn't tagged, positive review, since the permissions are "fixed" now, though this IMHO was a non-issue (cf. upstream reply), not worth a blocker.

The spkg is a mess anyway.

Replying to [comment:4 leif]:
> this IMHO was a non-issue (cf. upstream reply), not worth a blocker.

Probably true, but I did not realize this when making this ticket.  I simply checked all non-world-readable files in the Sage install.  I can proudly say that now *all* installed files all world-readable (at least if the umask allows this).
