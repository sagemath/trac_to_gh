Original creator: jdemeyer

`libfplll` is configured with

```
./configure --prefix="$SAGE_LOCAL" --libdir="$SAGE_LOCAL/lib" --includedir="$SAGE_LOCAL/include/fplll"
```

leading to the double subdirectory `local/include/fplll/fplll`.

Naïve question: what is the mechanism to delete the old headers when upgrading the package?

There is really no need to delete the old headers, but it could be using `rm -rf $SAGE_LOCAL/include/fplll`.
