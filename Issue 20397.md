# Issue 20397: Do not trigger automake in brial

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20634

Since #20381, `brial` compilation requires `automake` in some settings. This is cured by touching suitable files in `spkg-install`.

I haven't tested it directly, but LGTM in principle.  Maybe should be a comment there explaining why the `touch` is needed.

sage-7.2 hasn't been released already has it?  If so this should go in there, otherwise sage 7.2 can't be built without automake.

Sage 7.2 has been released.

But this problem does not trigger always, otherwise we would have seen many more reports. I for one cannot reproduce it. It might be filesystem or OS-dependent.

I encountered this issue building Sage 7.2 from source on SciLinux 6.7 (an RHEL 6 derivative).  Sebastien's patch fixed the problem for me!

Great. I was waiting for feedback before setting it to needs review.
