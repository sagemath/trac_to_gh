In this ticket, we implement Lex DFS traversal as described in [this](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~krueger/papers/unified.ps) paper. Also, we rewrite the code for Lex BFS to follow the pseudocode in the paper which is easier to understand.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27928

Long time ago, we tried to implement the linear time algorithm for LexBFS, but it's not finalized. See #11736. It could give you some ideas. At least a working and clean LexBFS is a great improvement.


Some comments:

- You should let a brief description of the algorithm and add a reference in `src/doc/en/reference/references/index.rst`

```diff
-        This algorithm maintains for each vertex left in the graph a code
-        corresponding to the vertices already removed. The vertex of maximal
-        code (according to the lexicographic order) is then removed, and the
-        codes are updated.
+        The algorithm used is described in
+        `this <http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~krueger/papers/unified.ps>`_ by
+        Derek G. Corneil and Richard Krueger.
```


- no need for this empty line

```diff
+
+        nV = self.order()
```


- unless I missed something

```diff
-            edges = [(id_inv[i], id_inv[pred[i]]) for i in range(self.order()) if pred[i] != -1]
+            edges = [(id_inv[i], id_inv[pred[i]]) for i in range(nV) if pred[i] != -1]
```


- instead of lambda, it might be better to use a def

```diff
         l = lambda x: code[x]
+        def l(x):
+            return code[x]
```



- in `lex_DFS`, instead of defining `add_element = (lambda y: value.append(id_inv[y])) if not reverse else (lambda y: value.insert(0, id_inv[y]))`, you should always do `value.append(id_inv[y])` and after the while loop reverse the list if `reverse` is true. Indeed, inserting at the beginning of a list is costly.

- in the code, is it possible to insert at the end of the list and use a different comparison function ? I'm not sure it is a good idea. At least think about it.

- I did not check carefully if the 3-sun graph is already defined in our graph constructors...

- both methods are defined in `generic_graph.py`. What happen if `self` is directed ?

I don't think that a directed graph can cause any problem. The algorithm should work for both directed and undirected graphs.

which method ?

If you use boost, the best is certainly to add the method to `boost_graph.pyx`

Unfortunately, the current lex BFS method does not work with DiGraphs, the reason being that to get the neighbors of a vertex `v` it examines the `v-th` **column** of the adjacency matrix whereas it should examine the `v-th` **row**.

The code prior to this comment was not using the adjacency matrix, and we have iterators to get the neighbors, out neighbors, etc. So I don't understand this comment.

It's never bas to have 2 methods, even if very similar, to check the correctness of the new one.

In the `Cython code`:
- instead of creating `adjacency_list` with `vector`, you could use static sparse graphs. See for instance in `distances_all_pairs.pyx`
- the test `if nV == 0:` should be done before feeding other data structures
- `cdef dict int_to_v = dict(enumerate(G))` -> `cdef list int_to_v = list(G)`
- `cdef u_int, v_int` -> `cdef int u_int, v_int`
- for `pred`, why not using an integer array instead of a list ?

May be we should create a new file names `graph_traversals.pyx` to host lexBFS, lexDFS, lexM, etc.

When all of these methods are created I will add them to this new file.

Oups, my fault. So yes, it's not good for digraphs.

I have edited the code and pushed to a new branch in `public/` so that we can both edit it.

More precisely, I did the following
- rebase on `8.9.beta1`

- in `generic_graph_pyx.pxd`, remove (no longer needed here)

```diff
+from libcpp.vector cimport vector
+
+
```

- in `generic_graph_pyx.pyx`, remove 

```diff
+import collections
```


- in `generic_graph.py`: use alias to methods instead of extra frontend method. It's shorter and more efficient this way.

- in `traversals.pyx`
  - change file header, add table of methods and copyright
  - extend one line description of methods
  - put proper bibliographic reference
  - add missing deallocation of short digraph
  - make the graph simple if it allows loops or multiple edges.  In general, **DO NOT MODIFY INPUT GRAPH**. This is strictly forbidden ! Either we raise an error, or use `to_simple` to make a copy without loop/multiedges. Here, instead of checking if the graph effectively has loops or multiedges, I directly make a copy. I think it's more efficient like that, but may be not...


What remains to be done:
- add tests for corner case (empty (di)graph, etc.)
- try other (di)graphs, in particular a symmetric digraph to check if it's working well
- Check if further improvements are possible
- BFS and DFS are iterators. Can't we turn LexBFS and LexDFS to iterators as well ? it might not be possible when `reverse=True`.

As `lex_BFS` is exposed in `Graph`, there is no need for this change

```diff
-        sage: Graph(1).lex_BFS(tree=True)
+        sage: from sage.graphs.traversals import lex_BFS
+        sage: lex_BFS(Graph(1), tree=True)
```

So you should use `G.lex_BFS()` and `G.lex_DFS()` in all doctests.

For the test with symmetric digraph, you can do:

```
G = Graph([(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (5, 6)])
D = DiGraph(G)
G.lex_BFS() == D.lex_DFS()
