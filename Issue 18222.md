4ti2 version 1.6.4 was just ​released. 

Just released a new version of the mathematical software 4ti2. Version 1.6.4 is a minor update, which improves error checking while reading zsolve input files.

It also corrects a mistake in the test-suite introduced in version 1.6.3 released last month, which is included in Sage at the moment and which might scare some users. (There was no actual bug.)

The manual has been updated to include a reference to commands and their options and a reference to the C API. All commands now support --help; and long options are now available on Mac OS X. 


Should update the package to get these improvements; the updated manual may make it easier to support 4ti2's features in Sage (#18325) or perhaps to develop a library-based interface to 4ti2.

Download the 4ti2 tarfile from ​http://www.4ti2.de/version_1.6.4/4ti2-1.6.4.tar.gz to
SAGEROOT/upstream, checkout the git branch and do sage -f 4ti2 to try the new package.

HMmmmmm.. If I make no mistake we dropped the "changelog" section of `SPKG.txt` when we switched to new-style packages. This, because the changelog is part of Sage's git tree.

IMHO one needs to specify what should be in the "main" commit message on such a ticket (do you often do multi-line commit messages?), otherwise this is not a sufficient replacement for SPKG.txt...

I do not see any reason why packages should be handled differently from the rest of Sage's source code. How can you defend a SPKG.txt file for packages, and regular git logs for everything else?

Regardless of that, I am only telling you that the standard now is apparently to strip changelogs. So expect it to happen in the future, if somebody eventually touches this package.

Jeroen, wat is aan de hand,  since when are you allowed to override  collective decisions of making a package optional?!
