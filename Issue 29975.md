# Issue 29975: Fix tkz-graph and tkz-berge links: altermundus.com is gone

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30212

Original creator: slelievre

Original creation time: 2020-07-24 14:20:59

CC:  slelievre

Keywords: beginner

The `_latex_` method of a graph checks for two LaTeX packages,
tkz-graph and tkz-berge. If not found, it prints a warning referring to
the "Altermundus" website. The LaTeX tutorial also refers to it.

The Altermundus website is gone, its tkz page is archived at:

- https://web.archive.org/web/20181228055702/http://altermundus.com:80/pages/tkz/

The links should be updated to point to the relevant CTAN pages:

- https://www.ctan.org/pkg/tkz-berge
- https://www.ctan.org/pkg/tkz-graph

Changing status from new to needs_review.

We need reviewers able to read English, French, German, Portuguese, and Japanese. Actually, for Japanese, we need also need someone able to write it.

French and English OK for me, I cannot comment on other languages.

I slightly corrected the German version, English is fine -- and I cannot comment on the others. :-)

The Portuguese translation seems OK, according a Brazilian student of my team.

Here is what I could do with the Japanese version. I will ask someone I know to double-check.

I had a native speaker friend of mine check the Japanese version. Now it is more natural.

Comment by slelievre created at 2020-09-01 01:47:18

Please add author and reviewer names as appropriate,
and someone give this positive review.


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2020-09-01 01:49:38

added my name. Once other people have added the appropriate names we can switch to positive review.


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2020-09-01 01:58:11

We still need reviewer names for German and portuguese unless Travis can vouch for them.

Comment by tscrim created at 2020-09-01 02:06:19

I can only say the Portuguese seems right coming from my knowledge of Spanish. I would not rely on that however. `;)`

Reimundo Heluani validated the Portuguese version on sage-devel:

The German part looks correct, but difficult to understand.

There was a dash missing between `PGF` and `Bibliothek`. In German you cannot just put to nouns like this in row, but have to combine them (either as new word or with a dash). This might explain funny English spelling of German natives.

Do I see correctly that there is not hint here, how to get the PGF library? (It's probably somewhere else or obvious anyway).


```diff
-Um kombinatorische Graphen darstellen zu können, wird eine aktuelle
-Version der PGF Bibliothek, die Datei ``tkz-graph.sty`` (verfügbar
-via https://www.ctan.org/pkg/tkz-graph), sowie die Datei
-``tkz-arith.sty`` und vielleicht auch ``tkz-berge.sty``, jeweils verfügbar
-auf der Seite https://www.ctan.org/pkg/tkz-berge, benötigt.

I like your simplified version more than mine as well. Would you push it?

You are right. I don't think that it is necessary to give more details here; it is not so difficult to find information about pgf (in my opinion).
