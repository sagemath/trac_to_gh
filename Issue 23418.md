# Issue 23418: Improve calculus intro page

Issue created by migration from Trac.

The calculus intro reachable from the refman main page just is an unordered list of links. Moreover it lacks a few necessary sentences for the beginner.

It all worked out with `sage -docbuild reference` but `make doc` fails miserably. Why?

So I am pretty sure why it is not working is because the files are not known to sphinx because it is looking for files in a `.. toctree::`. So I mimicked what asymptotics do; give this a try and let me know if it works and you like it.

OK, I think we'll take your solution.

Lol Well, I think mine is a little better in terms of layout, but I like your hidden toctree. Can you make a hybrid branch?

(Addendum: sorry, I didn't mean to change the branch.)

You should really check once more if it builds for you after a `make doc-clean` because here it doesn't and with the patchbot it won't. This is really peculiar because in `prep/Quickstart...` there are links to a level higher that work. It would be interesting if it builds for you always.

This will compile for me, so let's make it the branch.
