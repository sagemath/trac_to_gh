The default `len(C)` where `C` is some `LinearCode` instance is really slow.

```
sage: RS = ReedSolomonCode(15,3,GF(16,'a'))
sage: timeit('len(RS)')
5 loops, best of 3: 1.06 s per loop
```

Attached patch fixes this by defining a `__len__` method.

```
sage: RS = ReedSolomonCode(15,3,GF(16,'a'))
sage: timeit('len(RS)')
625 loops, best of 3: 3.09 Âµs per loop
```
