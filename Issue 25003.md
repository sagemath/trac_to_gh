# Issue 25003: Chebyshev and Lattes maps should be created as dynamical systems

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25240

Original creator: bhutz

Original creation time: 2018-04-24 13:53:05

When creating maps from Cheybshev polynomials or Lattes maps of elliptpic curves, they are created as endomorphisms of the affine of projective space. The typical use scenario is to use them for dynamics. This was missed when the dynamical systems code was moved out of the schemes folder.

another typo:

```
+        OUTPUT: an dynamical system on this projective space.
```

should be "**a** dynamical system"

once done, you can set to positive
