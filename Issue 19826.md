The documentation of `restricted_automorphism_group()` of a polyhedron states:

```
   First, let the linear automorphism group be the subgroup of the
   Euclidean group E(d) = GL(d,RR) ltimes RR^d preserving the
   d-dimensional polyhedron. The Euclidean group acts in the usual way
   vec{x} |-->  Avec{x}+b on the ambient space.
```

However, this group is usually called the [affine group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_group). The [Euclidean group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_group) is something else, containing the *orthogonal* transformations and translations.

Of course the linear automorphism group of a full-dimensional polytope is contained in the Euclidean subgroup of the affine group. And the restricted automorphism group is just a trick to really talk about the full-dimenisonal polytope case, so the definition works with either ambient group. Still, the wording should be consistent.

No, it is not! This method really looks for affine transformations, not just Euclidean transformations.

Ok I forgot the "up to conjugation": the linear automorphism group of a full-dimensional polytope is conjugate to a subgroup of the Euclidean group.
