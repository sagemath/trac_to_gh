Should be easy since `mathjax` is a Sage package now.

ok, but where to find the mathjax directory ?

*EDIT* : Found it, in sage/local/share/mathjax/

The changes make sense. I'm changing the milestone to 8.2: this is not crucial for the 8.1 release.

Ah, thanks for fixing this. I didn't find it before since it wasn't in the "python3" component, but this should save some hassle.
