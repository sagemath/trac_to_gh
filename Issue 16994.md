# Issue 16994: LatticePoset: join and meet of several elements

Enhance `join()` and `meet()` to accept a list as an argument. If empty list is allowed, return the top/bottom element.

Hello !

I do not understand why you do

```
i, j = map(self._element_to_vertex, (x,y))
return self._vertex_to_element(self._hasse_diagram._meet[i,j])
```

and not only

```
x=(x,y)
```


Short of that, you updated the docstring of "join" but did not do the same for "meet".

AAAannd I think that it is all `:-)`

I do not understand what you don't understand. `:=)`

I the function get an element of the lattice as an argument, say `'a'`, it must convert it to "element" of the Hasse diagram, get meet and convert back. Maybe instead of `map` it would be better to have just


```
i = self._element_to_vertex(x)
j = self._element_to_vertex(y)
```


Or do you mean to remove part I marked as "Handle basic case fast" to comments?

> Short of that, you updated the docstring of "join" but did not do the same for "meet".

True. Must correct this.

Hello !

Well, I thought that you could save some time but now I do not see it anymore `O_o`

It feels a bit weird to compute the top element, and compute its meet with something else given that you already know the result but well, it does not matter much I guess.

Good to go !
