There was a small bugfix release of PolyBoRi.

Here is my first attempt to bundle it:
http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/dreyer/spkg/polybori-0.7.1.p0.spkg

Perhaps we can revert #11019

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/11261

I added a small patch, that makes PolyBoRi compatible with upcoming M4RI release: http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/dreyer/spkg/polybori-0.7.1.p1.spkg

It also fixed the issue that the while site-packages directory was recompiled.
(Both backported from upcoming PolyBoRi 0.8.)
