We can imitate the changes in #30593. Here is a patch to do that. It works, but is there a better way?

`aclocal.m4` has hand-written macros with C/C++ programs calling `exit()`, and not including `stdlib.h` (which, by right, must be done, according to `man 3 exit`) - I suppose it is from there.

Once Apple in its infinite wisdom allows the download of Xcode 12 on my machine to complete, I'll have a look (assuming it is reproducible on macOS 10).
