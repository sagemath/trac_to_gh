The `configure` script for `ecl` fails with Xcode 12, with this kind of error in `config.log`:

```
conftest.c:4:3: error: implicitly declaring library function 'exit' with type 'void (int) __attribute__((noreturn))' [-Werror,-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
  exit(0);
  ^
conftest.c:4:3: note: include the header <stdlib.h> or explicitly provide a declaration for 'exit'
1 error generated.
```

We can imitate the changes in #30593. Here is a patch to do that. It works, but is there a better way?

> this seems to come from an autoconf macro, not from `configure.ac` itself, but which one needs to be dug up.

`aclocal.m4` has hand-written macros with C/C++ programs calling `exit()`, and not including `stdlib.h` (which, by right, must be done, according to `man 3 exit`) - I suppose it is from there.

Once Apple in its infinite wisdom allows the download of Xcode 12 on my machine to complete, I'll have a look (assuming it is reproducible on macOS 10).

Is this on macOS 10, or only on  Big Sur?

Changing priority from blocker to critical.

should not be a blocker, as only beta tools are affected.

I've provided a PR for ecl to fix this: https://gitlab.com/embeddable-common-lisp/ecl/-/merge_requests/231
