What should be the name of this (and the dual function for join-semilattices)?

Tickets still needing working or clarification should be moved to the next release milestone at the soonest (please feel free to revert if you think the ticket is close to being resolved).

I think `submeetsemilattice` would be a better name since it is a subobject that is a meetsemilattice. The current name could be interpreted as the meet in a subsemilattice.
