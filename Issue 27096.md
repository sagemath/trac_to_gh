In the course making last minute tweaks to #27230 I apparently still broke its functionality on Cygwin without testing it.

Confirmed it definitely works now.  Setting positive review on my own ticket since it's just a minor fix to an already merged ticket #27230, and the best thing to do here was to just confirm that it works now.

It is good to have at least someone else take a look at it. `;)`
