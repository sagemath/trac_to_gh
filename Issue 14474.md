In case the changes in the other file risk to create conflicts with existing tickets, I am fine droping them / having them moved to those other tickets.

Hey Nicolas,

Looks good. While we are at it, I've also fixed the line continuations over to the new format in a review patch.

Best,

Travis

Oh, I thought I had done this as well. But maybe only in the original file. Thanks!

Is that a positive review?

It's a positive review for your patch :-) I let you setup the positive review on the whole thing.

Done. Almost forgot to put my name as the reviewer.

This should be rebased to sage-5.9 or later.

Replying to [comment:9 jdemeyer]:
> This should be rebased to sage-5.9 or later.

In fact it's on advance on its time rather the converse :-)

I added the dependency upon #14014.

Still doesn't apply for me, with or without #14014:

```

The problem was that the patch on trac was (slightly) different than the patch in the combinat queue (by marking a test a long), which is what I based my review patch on. This was what was causing the conflict. Nicolas, I've updated both patches in the queue.
