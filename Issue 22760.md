Keywords: integrate, interfaces, giac

If `integrate(..., algorithm='giac')` does not find a solution, Sage should return an unevaluated expression. 

For example, consider `integrate(exp(-x^2)*log(x), x, algorithm='giac')`.

It returns either

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NotImplementedError: Unable to parse Giac output: integrate(ln(x)*exp(-x^2),x)
```

or

```
integration(e^(-x^2)*ln(x), x)
```

depending on the user's locale settings (EN and FR respectively). 

OTOH, both Maxima and SymPy return `integrate(e<sup>(-x</sup>2)*log(x), x)`.

my fault, thanks for pointing it out. 

> I though I had that ticket merged when I tested things here, but apparently not, or else I would have noticed the conflict. #22833 is now in `8.0.beta7` and so this will have to be rebased. 


there's something that i don't understand. i do:

```
(in t/mforets/22997) $ git rebase develop
(... solve the merge conflict manually ...)
(in t/mforets/22997) $ git add src/sage/symbolic/integration/external.py
(in t/mforets/22997) $ git status
rebase in progress; onto 7a36941
You are currently rebasing branch 't/22997/22997' on '7a36941'.
  (all conflicts fixed: run "git rebase --continue")

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

	modified:   src/sage/symbolic/integration/external.py
(in t/mforets/22997) $ git rebase --continue
Applying: parse result in giac_integrator
```

up to now everything seems to work fine, locally. however i try to push to the remote branch and it breaks:

```
(in t/mforets/22997) $ git push trac HEAD:u/mforets/22997
To trac.sagemath.org:sage.git
 ! [rejected]        HEAD -> u/mforets/22997 (non-fast-forward)

hint: counterpart. Check out this branch and integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g. 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
```

it also breaks if i use the automatic command:
