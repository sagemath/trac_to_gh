# Issue 16686: L-series for holomorphic modular forms for Hecke triangle groups

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16923

Keywords: L-series L-function modular forms hecke triangle Dokchitser

Support for L-series of holomorphic modular forms for
Hecke triangle groups for all n=3, 4, 5, ... , infinity.

The implementation is based on Dokchitser (from pari).

In the arithmetic cases n=3, 4, 6, infinity the conductor
is 1, 2, 3, 4 respectively. In the non-arithmetic cases
the conductor is irrational.

The ticket depends/is based on #16883.
