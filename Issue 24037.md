This is bad:

```
except:
```

One should always catch specific exceptions instead.

This seems to cause problems with fricas (see patchbot) likely due to no longer catching an `AttributeError` (it's a little too late in the evening in Australia for me to think enough to find the exact problem, but I will do so tomorrow).

I'm afraid that the fricas issues are more fundamental. They appear on other tickets too for the same patchbot.

Do you happen to know whether only this patchbot has a problem with fricas?

It seems so, but I don't know why...

I am unable to reproduce the fricas failures locally on my machine. Everything else LGTM.
