Keywords: hecke triangle group

The goal of this ticket is to provide a non-stub implementation
for Hecke triangle groups.

The matrix elements are over Z[lam], an order in the number field Q[lam],
given by the minimal polynomial of lam=2*cos(pi/n).
A corresponding default embedding into AA(2*cos(pi/n)) is selected for lam.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16936
