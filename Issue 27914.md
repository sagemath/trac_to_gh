R 3.6.1 is [out](https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-announce/2019/000643.html). And the usual reasons push towards pulling it in Sage...

The upstream tarball is here : http://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-3/R-3.6.1.tar.gz

On 8.9.beta2 compiled with Python2 : builds and passes `ptestlong` with no error whatsoever.

==> `needs_review`

With Python 3 : see the [romancero](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/QgD6xb3oCEU) on `sage-devel`

After a [waltz](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/QgD6xb3oCEU/uB3A0yydBwAJ) around the `git trac` problem, `make ptest-python3` gets exactly the same results with the present patch as with R 3.6.0.

===> still `needs_review`...
