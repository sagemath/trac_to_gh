# Issue 16449: parametric_plot ignores xmin and xmax axis limits

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16686

Original creator: tcoffee

Original creation time: 2014-07-20 01:19:09

Keywords: parametric plot axes options

Try for instance:


```
sage: parametric_plot((sin, cos), (0, 2*pi), xmin = -2, xmax = 2, ymin = -2, ymax = 2)
```


The xmin and xmax limits are ignored, while the ymin and ymax limits are not.

This is not a bug in `parametric_plot`. It _was_ a deliberate decision made in `plot`; I don't know why it was done this way. See #13368
