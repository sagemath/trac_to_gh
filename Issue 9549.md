# Issue 9549: InfinitePolynomialRing_sparse.is_field lacks `proof=...` option

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/9549

The class `InfinitePolynomialRing_sparse` defines two methods called `is_field()`. The second definition rejects keyword arguments. This prevents from creating polynomial rings over infinite polynomial rings:

There is a similar issue with ``is_integral_domain``, too.

I have now replaced it with the correct file. (It seems that for some reason, unprivilegied trac users are allowed to replace attached files but not to delete them??!)

You probably don't want the line


```
print "coucou" 
```


in the patch.

Sorry--I was sure I had double-checked that it wasn't in the patch after uploading it... :-/ Thanks for spotting my blunder.

In is_integral_domain, we should pass on the keywords to self._base.is_integral_domain() so that that can take a proof option.
