we use a macro for autoconf archive to test the version

Works for me on Gentoo but it's a little scary to have the check for boost implicitly be the check for boost_cropped. It would be nice if the new macro result was cached -- then we could just repeat the check -- but I don't think it is.

Maybe check `HAVE_BOOST` as a safety net against changes to boost_cropped? I dunno.

No distro I tried allowed for
an incomplete install of boost.

I guess it is a historical artefact that Sage has these two packages

Sage needs `boost_cropped`, not all of `boost`. The `boost` tarball is ten times the size, `boost_cropped` took 8 seconds to build on my machine, and `boost` took 21 minutes. So if by "historical" you mean before this ticket, I guess "historical arfifact" is accurate.

I don't know how `boost_cropped` was created, at least `spkg-src` provides no clue.

I don't know a modern Linux distro that supplies such a "cropped" thing.

According to `spkg-src`, `boost_cropped` is obtained from `boost` by just taking the subdirectory `boost` (i.e., `boost_1_66_0/boost`).

I'm almost positive the cropped version is a pure Sage invention, to cut down on size and to speed up building.

I think I see what happened. The sage library doesn't need boost at all, the boost spkg is optional. But the spkg-configure.m4 for boost causes it to be installed whenever a system copy is not present.

Instead, I think we should leave boost alone (why is it an optional package to begin with?). The spkg-configure.m4 for boost_cropped should look for a full version of boost, like it does now. And then if someone decides to install the optional boost spkg... who cares what happens.

I don't understand what I am supposed to reproduce. I think an optional package only gets installed if its installation is explicitly triggered by `make` or `sage -i`, and not merely because `./configure` was not able to find a system copy.

we have a number of optional and experimental packages with spkg-configure.m4 already, and nothing like this was ever reported.

Ok, I'm going to put it back to positive review then. I'm not willing to delete boost at the moment to see what happens.

The check for boost_cropped now looks even more correct to me, since that's the standard package. My comment about boost's spkg-configure.m4 no longer applies, it isn't standard and doesn't need to be detected.

Sorry, false alarm: I tested with some other packages. If I uninstall the optional gp2c, for example...


```
./configure
...
checking SPKGs to install... 
    ...
    gmp-6.1.2 will not be installed (configure check)
    gmpy2-2.1.0b1
    gp2c-0.0.10.p0
    ...
```


That sure looks like gp2c will be installed from the spkg. That message combined with John's comment made me think for a minute that a full copy of boost was being installed in addition to (or in lieu of) boost_cropped.

Yikes, that ax_boost_base.m4 is scary. I hope I never have to debug anything in it.  But if it works it works, and I imagine (?) it's well tested.
