Boost has a "visitor" concept.  Basically, you pass a graph traversal method an object.  As the graph traversal function goes through the graph, it invokes functions from your object.  So it's easy to do a depth-first something, for example.  It applies to stuff beyond depth-first and breadth-first too, for example, creating a spanning tree, etc.
