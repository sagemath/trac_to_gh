Linuxbrew (https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-on-Linux) is available on Docker at https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxbrew/linuxbrew/tags

It likes to install into `/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew`. If installed into other prefixes, it cannot use its binary packages.

The branch is on top of #29104, which adds the homebrew package information.
