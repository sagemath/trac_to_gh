Before:

```
sage: QQi.<i> = QuadraticField(-1)
sage: mat = matrix([[1, i], [i, 2]])
sage: %timeit mat + mat
The slowest run took 23.26 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
100000 loops, best of 3: 7.95 µs per loop
```

After:

```
sage: QQi.<i> = QuadraticField(-1)
sage: mat = matrix([[1, i], [i, 2]])
sage: %timeit mat + mat
The slowest run took 11.31 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
100000 loops, best of 3: 2.21 µs per loop
```
