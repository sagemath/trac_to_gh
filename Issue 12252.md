# Issue 12252: OS X Lion: symmetrica doesn't work

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Keywords: symmetrica darwin lion osx

With the default compiler in XCode 4, OS X Lion, the symmetrica spkg apparently builds successfully and passes self-tests, but the file `devel/sage/sage/libs/symmetrica/schur.pxi` fails doctests: it hangs and times out.  One possible fix: compile the spkg with optimization turned off; then schur.pxi passes tests in under 3 seconds.  (Another possible solution: compile with `/usr/bin/gcc-4.2` if present.  If you try to compile with clang, the build fails.)

The spkg here checks for /usr/bin/gcc-4.2.  If present, it uses it; otherwise, it turns off optimization when compiling.

I think this should be closed, since building gcc (#12369) allows symmetrica to build without problems.
