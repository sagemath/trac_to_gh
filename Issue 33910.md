Keywords: quantum Clifford

This works for sufficiently large roots of unity: when q<sup>2k</sup> != 1. We provide a new implementation/basis when this q<sup>2k</sup> = 1.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/34147

A bit of refactoring to have some good programming practices. I also fixed a bug in the inverse not taking into account the coefficients and will use the (new-ish) general inverse code to check the generic case.

I couldn't figure out which exceptions to actually catch, so I decided to just let it fail.

(BTW, this type of catching is done elsewhere in Sage. What is your suggestion for catching exceptions when you want to catch basically all of them?)
