The flint spkg currently does not respect the global CC and CXX flags, we should fix this (for instance for #12426).

I've posted an spkg at [http://wstein.org/home/ohanar/clang-port/sage-5.0.beta1-src/spkg/standard/flint-1.5.0.p11.spkg](http://wstein.org/home/ohanar/clang-port/sage-5.0.beta1-src/spkg/standard/flint-1.5.0.p11.spkg).
