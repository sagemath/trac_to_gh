# Issue 25740: A Goppa code class

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25977

CC:  dimpase asante klee

This ticket presents a first implementation for Goppa codes. It contains a class goppa.py that can construct the parity matrix from a generating polynomial and a defining set.

Ticket retargeted after milestone closed (if you don't believe this ticket is appropriate for the Sage 8.8 release please retarget manually)

first things first 

- add yourself to the list of authors

- make sure the only lines that are longer than 80 characters are input/output of doctests, but not elsewhere in the documentation

Done. Fixed the line length in a new commit.

oops, src/sage/coding/goppa.py is in MSDOS format. This makes diffing painful, so let's keep it in this format for review, and once done, we'll run `dos2unix` on it...

OK, so let's work on the "public" branch, so that we both can push into the same place.

I've edited a part of the goppa.py file, in particular using 

```
stuff like `u` - for maths (LaTeX)

stuff like ``self`` for Python variables etc
```


Please fix the rest of it, as well as things marked by `???`.

Then, for functions and classes the 1st line of the multilibe doctring has a special
meaning, it should be short, and followed by an empty line (for indexing).

I probably fixed all of the latter already.

To see my chnages, check out the branch and do `git diff HEAD^ -w` (`-w` is needed to ignore whitespace changes, as I converted the file to the Unix format...)


As well, please try building Sage docs with these changes - it's important that all the
spaces are at the right places, as `rst` is a tricky forrmat...

Tickets still needing working or clarification should be moved to the next release milestone at the soonest (please feel free to revert if you think the ticket is close to being resolved).

Please inspect the results of docbuild in the browser, by opening `file:///<SAGEROOT>/share/doc/sage/html/en/reference/coding/sage/coding/goppa.html`
(where you need to replace `<SAGEROOT>` by the full path to your Sage install)

Things inside TeX markers should be proper TeX maths, e.g. `F_{p^m}` rather than `F_p^m`.
I've started on doing needed changes:

I'll push the commit for the latter, just a moment.

I fixed all the TeX formatting. Also noticed that there was a badly formatted list in the parity check matrix documentation bit and fixed that too.
