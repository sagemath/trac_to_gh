Currently sage doesn't install any files other than `.py` and compiled cython code. Headers and other auxiliary files that are necessary to the good functioning  of sage are kept in the `src` directory and we rely on its presence. Since #18027 we also rely on the presence of sage's build directory. It would be good if sage could just work without relying on the presence of it source and build directory.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18494

I wouldn't copy stuff to `SAGE_SRC`. The build system should treat the source directory as read-only as much as possible.

When you talked about "an installed `interrupt_api.h`" in [comment:10], which installation location did you mean?

I disagree. include dirs being the same in `setup.py` and `cython.py` is on the nice to have list but there is no compelling reason why install time and runtime absolutely have to match. In this particular case having the same list in `cython.py` has in `setup.py` means that you want to use the source instead of the installed files at runtime. I don't find that compelling. I cannot really accept a cythonize/"install headers"/build/"final install" routine which could put the two in agreement. I think that's undue complication an breaking of standard building procedures.

So what the current branch does:
* clean up the "cythonized" path from `pxi.h`
* clean `cython.py` so it use installed include directories rather than source ones. Prune useless directories as well and use python mechanism as much as possible rather than path "knowledge" (potentially help python2.3 as well)
* add cythonized include path in `setup.py` so that `pxi.h` can find the generated include files at build time
* add sections to `setup.py` to install header files under `sage/ext` including the generated headers. Also install all `.pxi` and `.pxd` files
* also replace one instance of path knowledge by python mechanism in `source.py`

There is more that could be done but I don't want to extend the scope of the ticket. I have bled a little on one extra file as it is.

I would still like to use as much as possible the same headers in `src/setup.py` and in `cython.py`. You could make a function

```
@cached_function
def sage_include_directories(sage_lib_dir):
    """

    """
    import numpy   # not a global import!
    return [.......]
```

returning the include directories for `cython()` if `sage_lib_dir` is `SAGE_LIB` and returning the include directories for `src/setup.py` if `sage_lib_dir` is `SAGE_SRC`. I haven't thought about is that much, but I think that's the right direction to go.

And I do indeed agree that `sage/gsl` should be removed.

That would be clever. I'll try that.

It is actually quite hard to work out which `.pxi`/`.pxd` will never be used which why I included the `padics` files. There is no other python sources in that directory so to package them I either have to do it as a `data_files`  or introduce a special case in `package_data`. Any chance of them being obsolete?

I cannot really say but I see the last dependency of #17854 is getting rid of something NTL related.
Our NTL wrapping code is really terrible with regards to what Cython can now do and we should definitely rewrite it all using actual C++ bindings.
This is not so difficult but very time consuming...

I agree completely with the above statement. Note that #18367 doesn't really clean-up the NTL interface, it just moves it from `c_lib` to the Sage library.

It seems to need re-basing but #18367 seems to be clean and ready for a run on the patchbot as far as I can see.

Yes very strange conversation I have to agree. Upstream think their reasons are obvious. Unfortunately while I am sure you don't care it makes my other life a bit too "interesting".

Actually, `env.py` sounds like a good suggestion. You'll need to move `SAGE_INC` (currently defined in `setup.py`) also to `env.py`.

Ok I initially did that and reverted because it broke a doctest (`sage/repl/interpreter.py`) but I have no objection to making it absolute and fixing the doctest instead.

I agree and what you did is not quite what I had in mind: the point is that the `ext/interrupt` should be *computed* from the `os.path.join(SAGE_CYTHONIZED, 'sage', 'ext', 'interrupt', 'interrupt.h')` part.

Two remarks, in `setup.py` you have

```
include_dirs=sage_include_directories(True)
```

It should be 

```
include_dirs=sage_include_directories()
```

In `giacpy.pyx` why would you need `from sage.env import *`? What do you need from this?

I have tried with and without True and got the same pb. But removing
from sage.env import * doesn't help my original program, I have just tried to obtain a small code with the same error message.

Yes, I understood that. I'm saying that, regardless of earlier Sage versions, the best way forward is to use #18494 anyway.
