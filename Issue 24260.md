All tests pass on quasar.

The only thing I'm not sure about is the change in `modular/modform_hecketriangle/graded_ring_element.py`. Can you explain the rationale?

The former result changes quite a bit, I think because small changes are enlarged by substitution into a polynomial. I tried to preserve the assumed spirit of the test, i.e. a nonzero real part of the result, but to make it more robust. Of course I may be wrong with my assumptions.

Passes tests on sardonis (ppc64le) too.

I kept the test but adjusted the answer. Does that work for you?

So you see how useless the test is in this form. I'm replacing it with my version.

It's just a test.

Not useless. We just need to increase the tolerance.
