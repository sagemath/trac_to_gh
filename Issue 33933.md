I can just make it known to the linter. Here or on a separate ticket?

but toctree appears in other places, and I have not seen any other problem with it elsewhere

maybe the problem here is just before the content is not indented correctly ? (NO.)

EDIT: in fact, it's really the only occurrence of toctree in src/sage

BUT there are many toctree in src/doc ; by the way should we validate them too ?

Replying to [comment:4 chapoton]:
> EDIT: in fact, it's really the only occurrence of toctree in src/sage

I've added it to the list of known directives

I've opened #34178 for this.
