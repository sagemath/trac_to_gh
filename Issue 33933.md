but toctree appears in other places, and I have not seen any other problem with it elsewhere

maybe the problem here is just before the content is not indented correctly ? (NO.)

EDIT: in fact, it's really the only occurrence of toctree in src/sage

BUT there are many toctree in src/doc ; by the way should we validate them too ?
