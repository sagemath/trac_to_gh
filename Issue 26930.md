# Issue 26930: py3: fix doctest in distance_all_pairs.pyx

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27167

Original creator: dcoudert

Original creation time: 2019-01-29 16:24:17

Keywords: py3, graph

again the error is due to the difference of ordering of the keys of dictionaries in py2 and py3. So we mark the doctest with `# py2` and `# py3`.
