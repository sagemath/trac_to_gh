# Issue 8605: upgrade SageTeX spkg to 2.2.5

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/8605

Original creator: ddrake

Original creation time: 2010-03-25 12:43:19

Assignee: tbd

I've made a couple improvements to SageTeX in the last few months, and it's time for an upgrade. The new version automatically falls back to making PNGs if making EPS or PDF files fails, and includes Nicolas Thi√©ry's sageexample environment. Please review and test!

spkg available at http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/drake/code/sage/st/sagetex-2.2.5.spkg

Things seem to work as advertised.  The new example.tex contains documentation for the new features and the pdf output seems to be exactly what is wanted.

Looks good to me.
