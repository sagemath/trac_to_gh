The building was this time success with the proposed change.

Please, see the log which came to the terminal with many warnings, however not relevant to this ticket:

I think these warnings are coming from bad practices used in third-party packages.

Please, see the autogenerated log which confirms that there were no errors in building Sage with the change proposed by Volker Braun:
