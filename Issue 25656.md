What do you mean with "sphinx warnings"?

Comment by chapoton created at 2018-07-21 16:02:38

There are currently around 27 warnings similar to

```
[dochtml] [manifolds] /home/u1/chapoton/sage/src/doc/en/reference/manifolds/index.rst:4: WARNING: undefined label: tensors-on-free-modules (if the link has no caption the label must precede a section header)
```

when building the html doc. This ticket reduces their number to 16.
