Flint had that issue some time ago. This is caused by the hardening of the toolchain. Look at what has been done for flint here

The culprit is this line

```
Makefile.subdirs:       $(QUIET_CC) $(CC) $(ABI_FLAG) -Wl,-r $^ -o $@ -nostdlib
```
Change `-Wl,-r` to plain `-r` should get you in business. Can someone also please update `SPKG.txt` with upstream location? Where did you get that tarball from? Has it been processed before being put on the mirror?
