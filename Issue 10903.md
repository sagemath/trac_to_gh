Keywords: simplify_full

Here is an example from the french sagebook to compute the laplacian in polar, that no longer works with version 4.6 of Sage


```
sage: x, y, r, t = var('x, y, r, t'); f = function('f', x, y)
sage: F = f(x = r*cos(t), y = r*sin(t))
sage: d = (diff(F,r,2) + diff(F,t,2)/r**2 + diff(F,r)/r)
sage: d.simplify_full() 
---------------------------------------------------------------
NotImplementedError           Traceback (most recent call last)

NotImplementedError: arguments must be distinct variables
```


With older versions, you got it :


```
sage: d.simplify_full()
D[0, 0](f)(r, t) + D[1, 1](f)(r, t)
```

Changing keywords from "simplify_full" to "simplify, maxima, symbolic derivative".

I don't know that this is necessarily a regression so much as having made some choices about what is 'allowed' to be a symbolic derivative.  We don't allow (for reasons that are unclear to me, because I still don't understand why we changed how we represent symbolic derivatives) arguments that are not just variables, unlike here where they are expressions.

It's the conversion to Maxima that is failing, by the way.

```
sage: d.simplify() 
---------------------------------------------------------------
NotImplementedError           Traceback (most recent call last)

NotImplementedError: arguments must be distinct variables
```


This even happens with trying to simplify (send to Maxima)

```
sage: diff(F,r).simplify()
<boom>
```


This is at least tangentially related to #6840 and #6756, though probably not directly.

AFAIK, #7377 improves the conversion of derivatives to maxima. It might fix this as well.

This seems to work for me in 5.0:


```

sage: x, y, r, t = var('x, y, r, t')
sage: f = function('f', x, y)
sage: F = f(x = r*cos(t), y = r*sin(t))
sage: d = (diff(F,r,2) + diff(F,t,2)/r**2 + diff(F,r)/r)
sage: d.simplify() 
(sin(t)*D[1, 1](f)(r*cos(t), r*sin(t)) + cos(t)*D[0, 1](f)(r*cos(t), r*sin(t)))*sin(t) + (sin(t)*D[0, 1](f)(r*cos(t), r*sin(t)) + cos(t)*D[0, 0](f)(r*cos(t), r*sin(t)))*cos(t) + (sin(t)*D[1](f)(r*cos(t), r*sin(t)) + cos(t)*D[0](f)(r*cos(t), r*sin(t)))/r - ((r*sin(t)*D[0, 1](f)(r*cos(t), r*sin(t)) - r*cos(t)*D[1, 1](f)(r*cos(t), r*sin(t)))*r*cos(t) - (r*sin(t)*D[0, 0](f)(r*cos(t), r*sin(t)) - r*cos(t)*D[0, 1](f)(r*cos(t), r*sin(t)))*r*sin(t) + r*sin(t)*D[1](f)(r*cos(t), r*sin(t)) + r*cos(t)*D[0](f)(r*cos(t), r*sin(t)))/r^2
sage: d.simplify_full()
D[0, 0](f)(r*cos(t), r*sin(t)) + D[1, 1](f)(r*cos(t), r*sin(t))
sage: diff(F,r).simplify()
sin(t)*D[1](f)(r*cos(t), r*sin(t)) + cos(t)*D[0](f)(r*cos(t), r*sin(t))
sage: diff(F,r).simplify_full()
sin(t)*D[1](f)(r*cos(t), r*sin(t)) + cos(t)*D[0](f)(r*cos(t), r*sin(t))
```



Although I'm too lazy to bisect to find out when it started working again, it'd probably be a good idea to add a doctest to make sure that it stays that way.  Not quite sure where to put it, though.

Hmm.  On second thought, I may have spoken too quickly:

    D[0, 0](f)(r*cos(t), r*sin(t)) + D[1, 1](f)(r*cos(t), r*sin(t))

and

    D[0, 0](f)(r, t) + D[1, 1](f)(r, t)

are a little different.  Not incompatible, because the functions are abstract, but still not the same.  Do we want to recover the original representation?

Replying to [comment:8 dsm]:
>     D[0, 0](f)(r, t) + D[1, 1](f)(r, t)
Wow, Sage before 4.6 was just plain wrong. We'll excuse casamayou, since superficially it looks like what one would sloppily write in a calculus book (the coordinate transformation implicitly assumed).

The formula for d is the expression for the laplacian in polar coordinates, so it should be equal to

```
(diff(f,x,x)+diff(f,y,y)).subs(x=r*cos(t),y=r*sin(t))
```

which is what 5.0 verifies.

I'm pretty sure #12796 fixed this, since this kind of computation was the point of that ticket.
I think this ticket can be closed. Add a doctest if you think the current tests are insufficient.
