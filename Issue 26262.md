You mean downgrading the spkg to optional? Is that actually possible already?

Could someone with python3 sage test this?

Sorry, no, not yet. I forgot about #25837.

There is no need to test with python3: I know that launching sagenb will fail when trying to import "email" module. I would say that py3-compatibility of sagenb has never been closer, but there is still work, and no worker to handle the task..

admittedly, docs are packed with few short autogenerated .rst files; if anyone is willing to tell me how to use sphinx to generate these, be my guest, I can fix this then.

I presume sagenb should now also depend on sphinx, there may be transitive dependency from something else but it is not visible.

Indeed. Thanks for pointing this out. Fixed in the last commit.

How was the "source tarball" â€‹https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/releases/download/1.1.0/sagenb-1.1.0.tar.bz2 created? It doesn't correspond with the github repo. In particular, the repo does not contain a bundled mathjax (as it should be), while the "source tarball" does.

Please comment at #26641.

I assume that the "source tarball" from this ticket was created from a non-clean checkout of the sagenb repo. I'll fix that on #26641.

It has been created using the standard procedure as explained in sagenb hacking docs and uploaded to [GitHub](GitHub).

Naturally it is not quite the same as what you have in [GitHub](GitHub) report.
