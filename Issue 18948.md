When typing several times in a row the following command (which is indeed incorrect)

```
sage: %crun -s cumulative 1+1
```
Sage ends up crashing. That's apparently because the timer is started but not stopped (because of the exception).

This very small branch fixes the problem, and may possibly also fix the other occurrences of a crash due to this function. It happens from time to time on my computer, though the previous example at least is deterministic.

I do not know how exactly I should doctest it, though.
