Could you rebase this on #29754 - which removes several Py2 packages this ticket touches.

Actually #29669 did and is already on Volker's branch.

Sorry,

there is a mistake I believe.


```diff
-        tox_packages_factor: [minimal-gcc_spkg, standard-gcc_spkg, standard-python2-gcc_spkg]
+        tox_packages_factor: [minimal-gcc_spkg, standard-gcc_spkg, standard]
```

This third option should probably go completely.
