This:

```
sage: bool(exp(x)>=0)
True
```

unexpectedly uses Maxima, and gets it wrong, too (the already known complex domain problem, see e.g. #14305).

Since Pynac can now assign info flags to function expressions the possible cases for `abs`, `factorial`, `binomial`, `real`, `imag`, `step` should be implemented in Pynac (this is https://github.com/pynac/pynac/issues/78) and the cases like above handled in Pynac.

The repercussions are not limited to such comparisons. The more expressions have info flags set the more expressions with more complicated structure can be decided and more questions answered.

Turns out that, additionally, an explicit `nonzero` info flag is needed in Pynac because without a `nonzero` flag the above test in the reals is always delegated to Maxima, as well. https://github.com/pynac/pynac/issues/79

EDIT: remove nonsense

To fix the Maxima-related problem, as a solution to the complex/real domain issue is not expected it might be possible to use only Pynac with relations, and use both with equality questions.

If Pynac should take over all questions on relations then it must be able to also answer this:

```
            sage: (x > 2).assume()
            sage: bool(x > 0)
            True
```

because it's impossible do separate domain-only questions from more general ones. That means the workaround mentioned in comment:8 depends on https://github.com/pynac/pynac/issues/227
