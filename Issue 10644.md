What do you mean by "fix"? Is it ok now? That was a lot of work for just removing "[mq]: " (of which I don't know where it came from or what it means).

Yes, it looks okay now.  The [mq] stands for "Mercurial queue".  By default the commit message comes from the argument to `hg qnew`.  But in Sage, we like to have "proper" informative commit messages (also, including the ticket number on the first line).

Why was it a lot of work, what did you do?

log in to a machine that has Sage, copy patch location, hg qimport, hg qapply, [comment:3 hg qrefresh -e], remove "[mq]: " from the commit message, hg export, copy patch to office pc, log in to trac, upload patch, tick needs_review, click Submit

All that to remove four characters from a commit message.

Why couldn't I just edit the patch to remove those 4 characters? Would it have screwed up some kind of checksum?
