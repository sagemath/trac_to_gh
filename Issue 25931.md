Please, 
the loop functions in the title are parallelized.
Please review this ticket.

For one instance of `Parallel computation::`, a blank line is missing after it.

Doc does not build

missing empty line here:

```
+        Parallel computation::
+           sage: Parallelism().set('tensor', nproc=2)
```

The doctests regarding the change of basis in `src/sage/tensor/modules/free_module_tensor.py` are not valid because the tensor components are cached. One must introduce a copy of the tensor `t` to trigger a new computation of the components in the basis `f`, i.e. one shall write something like

```
sage: Parallelism().set('tensor', nproc=2)
sage: t2 = v*w  # identical to t but initialized only in basis e
sage: t2.display(f)
v*w = -6 f_1*f^1 - 20/3 f_1*f^2 + 27/8 f_2*f^1 + 15/4 f_2*f^2
sage: t2[f,:] == t[f,:]  # check of the parallel computation
True
sage: Parallelism().set('tensor', nproc=1)  # switch off parallelization
```

But then `t2.display(f)` results in

```
ValueError: Cannot pickle code objects from closures
```


The doctest in `display_comp()` is also not valid, but I suggest to simply remove it because it is redundant with that in `display()`.

Replying to [comment:16 egourgoulhon]:
There was an error in the parallel function: it is corrected.
I also applied the suggested changes in the doctest 
thank

Could you remove that doctest?

Thanks. I've tested the changes both in python2 and python3. Everything is OK and I thing it is ready to go. Thanks for this improvement!
