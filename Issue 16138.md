# Issue 16138: Typo in libGAP's spkg-install

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16375

Original creator: leif

```sh
# location of the corresponding gap installation
# only used for the testsuite
CPPFLAGS="$CPPFLAGS"'-DSYS_DEFAULT_PATHS=\"'"$SAGE_LOCAL/gap/latest"'\"'
```


There's obviously a space missing, which can lead to arbitrary errors.

Not really an upstream issue as the `spkg-install` is in Sage.

Although I'd have added the space to the first string...

W.r.t. upstream: that was rather a joke, as I was considering you upstream.
