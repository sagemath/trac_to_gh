# Issue 18470: Implement LaTeX code for all diagram algebra elements

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Currently, a diagram algebra element can only display its LaTeX code if the element is a basis element. This is a minor fix that I have already implemented for myself, so this code should be added to the Sage source.

I think a better solution might be to move the `Element._latex_` to `DiagramAlgebra._latex_term`, which takes an index of a basis element as input, as `CombinatorialFreeModuleElement` has a built-in `_latex_` that should do the job (and so we don't duplicate the logic).

Wow. I did not know about that feature of `CombinatorialFreeModule.` Thank you for suggestion. Does that look better?

Code-wise it looks a lot better. One minor thing is you should mark the `latex(P([[1,2],[-2,-1]]))` as `# indirect doctest`. One trivial thing (albeit not introduced by this ticket) is to remove the unneeded parenthesis on the if statements. I.e., `if (conditions):` should be `if conditions:`. Otherwise I think this should be good.
