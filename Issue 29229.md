# Issue 29229: Add kwds to __classcall__ of MatrixSpace

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29466

Original creator: soehms

Original creation time: 2020-04-05 10:59:15

CC:  tscrim

Keywords: matrix space classcall

most `__classcall__` methods of parent classes pocess a generic `**kwds` in their list of arguments, but `MatrixSpace`doesn't. Thus currently, you can't use additional options constructing an instance of a class inherited from `MatrixSpace`. The aim of this ticket is to make this possible.

On Python 2:

```
File "src/sage/matrix/matrix_space.py", line 487, in sage.matrix.matrix_space.MatrixSpace.__classcall__
Failed example:
    MS2 = MyMatrixSpace(ZZ, 2, my_option=False)
Exception raised:
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/var/lib/buildbot/slave/sage2_git/build/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/doctest/forker.py", line 681, in _run

        return cls.classcall(cls, *args, **kwds)
    TypeError: unbound method __classcall__() must be called with MyMatrixSpace instance as first argument (got ClasscallMetaclass instance instead)
```

Actually, I am more surprised that is not an issue on Python3.

Here is the fix:

```diff
             sage: class MyMatrixSpace(MatrixSpace):
+            ....:     @staticmethod
             ....:     def __classcall__(cls, base_ring, nrows, ncols=None, my_option=True, sparse=False, implementation=None):
```

Also, I missed this on the first go-around:

```diff
-        Check that :`29466`is fixed::
+        Check that :trac:`29466`is fixed::
```

You can set it back to a positive review once done Sebastian.

Test with Python 2 is working, right now.
Thanks again!
