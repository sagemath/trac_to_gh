Actually, I am more surprised that is not an issue on Python3.

Here is the fix:

```diff
             sage: class MyMatrixSpace(MatrixSpace):
+            ....:     @staticmethod
             ....:     def __classcall__(cls, base_ring, nrows, ncols=None, my_option=True, sparse=False, implementation=None):
```

Also, I missed this on the first go-around:

```diff
-        Check that :`29466`is fixed::
+        Check that :trac:`29466`is fixed::
```

You can set it back to a positive review once done Sebastian.
