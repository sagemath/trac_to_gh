mforets, is this ready for review? Don't forget to set to `needs_review`.

Hi slelievre,
thanks for the reminder. Yes I think it is ready, I just set it for review.

I have not been updating my tickets from sagetrac for a while now; i don't have much extra time this year.

Best, Marcelo.-

Note that #27296 changes one of the same lines in `src/sage/interfaces/giac.py`,
fixing the spelling of "independent" (currently in its French spelling "independant")
so maybe coordinate that ticket and the present ticket.
