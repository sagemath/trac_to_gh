# Issue 29402: Bug in initialization of vector field with rational components

Keywords: vector field, manifold

Initializing the components of a vector field with a rational number as first component leads to an error:

```
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M')
sage: X.<x,y> = M.chart()
sage: v = M.vector_field(1/2, -1)
...
IndexError: index n (=1) out of range; it must be 0
```

while providing the components as a list is OK:

```
sage: v = M.vector_field([1/2, -1])
sage: v.display()
1/2 d/dx - d/dy
```

This is due to `Rational` class having a `__getitem__()` method and  `Tensorfield._init_component` (introduced in #27581) testing its input by 

```
    if hasattr(comp0, '__getitem__'):
```

Replacing the above line by 

```
    if isinstance(comp0, (list, tuple)):
```

makes the test more robust and fixes the bug.

The fix proposed in comment:1, namely use of 

```
    if isinstance(comp0, (list, tuple)):
```

failed if `comp0` is an object created by `vector(...)`, as revealed by a failed doctest in `vectorfield.py`. In the latest commit (comment:4), this is replaced by 

```
    if hasattr(comp0, '__len__') and hasattr(comp0, '__getitem__'):
```

This returns `True` (as it should) for `list`, `tuple` and `vector` and `False` (as it should) for a `Rational`.

This will work. (Note that matrices also fall under this criteria, but I don't know of a (reasonable) field that would. Number fields, p-adics, polynomials, etc. have a `__getitem__` but not a `__len__`.) Generally I would prefer something more explicit, but I am okay with the generality.

Replying to [comment:7 tscrim]:

That's a good point; it's nice that it works for matrices too. 

> but I don't know of a (reasonable) field that would. Number fields, p-adics, polynomials, etc. have a `__getitem__` but not a `__len__`.) Generally I would prefer something more explicit, 

Me too, but I could not think of something better in that case... 

>but I am okay with the generality.

Thank you for the review!
