The attached patch adds the Degree Negative Lexicographical term order (`DegNegLex`) to Sage 5.1.

It is defined as follows: x<sup>**a**</sup> < x<sup>**b**</sup> if and only if deg(x<sup>**a**</sup>) < deg(x<sup>**b**</sup>) or deg(x<sup>**a**</sup>) = deg(x<sup>**b**</sup>) and there exists 1 <= i <= n such that a<sub>1</sub> = b,, 1,, , ... , a,, i-1,,  = b,, i-1,,, ..., a<sub>i</sub> > b<sub>i</sub>. 

It is a native term ordering of `PolyBoRi` ("`dp_asc`") which Sage does not support yet. But Sage uses it internally to implement `DegRevLex`-ordered `BooleanPolynomialRing`s by reverting  `.gens()`. It is useful for Sage to distinguish between the original `dp_asc` and `DegRevLex`. It will help to fix some design issues discovered when fixing #13202.

Singular supports this as `(a(1:n),rp(n))`. The patch also includes the patches for the interfaces `libSingular` and Singular-pexpect.

Replaced the patch, there was a wrong Singular ordering in the back.

The patch looks good, i.e., reading it revealed no issues. So if doctests pass I say it's good to go.

Please reload the patch. (There was an intermediate patch, was this was wrong.)

Alright, let's see what the patchbot has to say about the current one then :)

Fixing that trailing whitespace issue (understanding how patch-bot works).

The patchbot green-lighted, so we have positive review here?
