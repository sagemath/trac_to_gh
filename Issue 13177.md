Thanks to the GCC spkg, most uses of the SAGE_FORTRAN and SAGE_FORTRAN_LIB environment variables are not needed anymore.  So I propose to continue supporting them for now, but deprecate their usage.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13349

I'd replace *"not every Sage package recognizes this"* by *"not every Sage package recognizes this **yet**"*.

Not sure whether that's still true; at least all standard spkgs should respect `CC` (and `CXX`) [meanwhile or soon] -- Andrew Ohana and me opened tickets for all spkgs (we were aware of) which didn't a while ago.

I'd also keep the `SAGE_FORTRAN` and `SAGE_FORTRAN_LIB` entries for now, just stating that these are deprecated (or, more precisely, obsolete), and shouldn't be used anymore (with a reference to `FC` and `FCFLAGS`).




Not directly related to this ticket, but `CPP` and `CPPFLAGS` should IMHO be mentioned as well.

I don't like that, because it sounds too much like a promise.  If in 2 years, still not all packages support `$CC`, it will look ridiculous. The current sentence is simply an informative statement of fact.

> I'd also keep the `SAGE_FORTRAN` and `SAGE_FORTRAN_LIB` entries for now, just stating that these are deprecated (or, more precisely, obsolete), and shouldn't be used anymore (with a reference to `FC` and `FCFLAGS`).

If they shouldn't be used anymore, what's the point?

> Not directly related to this ticket, but `CPP` and `CPPFLAGS` should IMHO be mentioned as well.

I think we should only mention the most important ones, namely CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS and FCFLAGS. Otherwise, there is an essentially endless list of environment variables...

If `FC` is unset, it will default to "gfortran" anyway, see how the `sage_fortran` script is created.

Well, `CPP` and `CPPFLAGS` are closely related, and one or two more entries don't make the list endless.  In addition, there seem to be quite many people confusing `CPP*` with `CXX*`.

If it should not be used, why should it be documented?  The message when doing `make` states clearly what should be used *instead*.

There are references to `SAGE_FORTRAN` in the following packages:
1. atlas (only in a "print" statement)
2. cliquer (which doesn't have Fortran code)
3. libgcrypt (which doesn't have Fortran code)
4. lrcalc (which doesn't have Fortran code)
5. rubiks (which doesn't have Fortran code)
6. sqlite (which doesn't have Fortran code)

So, as far as I can see, no package actually directly *uses* the value of `SAGE_FORTRAN`.

I was mainly concerned about ATLAS, for example, telling people to set `SAGE_FORTRAN` when that variable has been deprecated. It also looks like sqlite might print "annoying messages" if `SAGE_FORTRAN` is unset.

I guess sqlite is not a problem.
