Thanks to the GCC spkg, most uses of the SAGE_FORTRAN and SAGE_FORTRAN_LIB environment variables are not needed anymore.  So I propose to continue supporting them for now, but deprecate their usage.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13349

I'd replace *"not every Sage package recognizes this"* by *"not every Sage package recognizes this **yet**"*.

Not sure whether that's still true; at least all standard spkgs should respect `CC` (and `CXX`) [meanwhile or soon] -- Andrew Ohana and me opened tickets for all spkgs (we were aware of) which didn't a while ago.

I'd also keep the `SAGE_FORTRAN` and `SAGE_FORTRAN_LIB` entries for now, just stating that these are deprecated (or, more precisely, obsolete), and shouldn't be used anymore (with a reference to `FC` and `FCFLAGS`).




Not directly related to this ticket, but `CPP` and `CPPFLAGS` should IMHO be mentioned as well.

I don't like that, because it sounds too much like a promise.  If in 2 years, still not all packages support `$CC`, it will look ridiculous. The current sentence is simply an informative statement of fact.

If they shouldn't be used anymore, what's the point?

I think we should only mention the most important ones, namely CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS and FCFLAGS. Otherwise, there is an essentially endless list of environment variables...

If `FC` is unset, it will default to "gfortran" anyway, see how the `sage_fortran` script is created.

Documentation.  In a couple of years, we can certainly remove it.

Well, `CPP` and `CPPFLAGS` are closely related, and one or two more entries don't make the list endless.  In addition, there seem to be quite many people confusing `CPP*` with `CXX*`.

At least in the long run, we should get rid of the `sage_fortran` script as well.

This all looks okay to me. I haven't thoroughly tested that SAGE_FORTRAN_LIB can usually be omitted (although I've tried that on one or two platforms and it's worked), and I don't know how to test that when it cannot be omitted, using LIBRARY_PATH or LD_LIBRARY_PATH is the right solution.

Do we need followup tickets to take care of references to these variables in spkgs, or will that work itself out over the months/years?

There are references to `SAGE_FORTRAN` in the following packages:
1. atlas (only in a "print" statement)
2. cliquer (which doesn't have Fortran code)
3. libgcrypt (which doesn't have Fortran code)
4. lrcalc (which doesn't have Fortran code)
5. rubiks (which doesn't have Fortran code)
6. sqlite (which doesn't have Fortran code)

So, as far as I can see, no package actually directly *uses* the value of `SAGE_FORTRAN`.

I was mainly concerned about ATLAS, for example, telling people to set `SAGE_FORTRAN` when that variable has been deprecated. It also looks like sqlite might print "annoying messages" if `SAGE_FORTRAN` is unset.

I guess sqlite is not a problem.
