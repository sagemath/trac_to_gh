CC:  @egourgoulhon

It seems that `\ZZ` is undefined in MathJax:

```
Zn=IntegerModRing(6)
Zn
```
gives `Ring of integers modulo 6`.
But after `%display latex`, this gives

<span style="color:red">\ZZ</span>/6<span style="color:red">\ZZ</span>

This is on [SageMath](SageMath) 9.5 (for 9.6rc0 see https://groups.google.com/g/sage-support/c/NWGRB50xXNk).

Strange. It works well with me both with 9.6rc0 (on my desktop) and 9.5 (on Cocalc).

With 9.6rc0, what do you get from `print(html(Zn))`? I get

```
<html>\(\displaystyle \newcommand{\ZZ}{\Bold{Z}}\ZZ/6\ZZ\)</html>
```

I did experiments again, and now I can confirm that `Zn` shows

```
\Boldùëç/6\Boldùëç

and `print(html(Zn))` shows

```
<html>\(\displaystyle \newcommand{\ZZ}{\Bold{Z}}\ZZ/6\ZZ\)</html>

I don't know what happened with me before...

The patch redefines the code to add macro definitions recursively.
