Assignee: @roed314

CC:  @saraedum

Keywords: polynomial representation

If $K$ is an unramified extension of $Z_p$ whose generator is $a$, this patch implements a method `polynomial` which takes as input an element $x$ in $K$ and outputs a polynomial $P$ with coefficients in $Z_p$ such that $P(a) = x$.

```
sage: K.<a> = Qq(5^3)
sage: a.polynomial()
(1 + O(5^20))*x + (O(5^20))
```

Ok. Looks good. I fixed a few very minor documentation issues. I also wrote a unit test for expansion and it fails for some instances. This is likely only a error in the documentation:

```
sage: K=Qp(2)
sage: K(2).expansion()
[1]
sage: K(2).expansion(n=0)
0 # should return 1?
sage: K(2).expansion(n=1)
1 # sould return 0?
```
That's at least how I understand the expansion() docstring. Is the current behaviour intended?

Yeah, this is intended.  When you pass in a value for `n` it gives you the coefficient of p<sup>n</sup>, rather than the `n`th term in the list.  I've updated the test (but haven't pushed yet).

The docstring says that (since this is not a field) summing these with powers of pi should return the original element, i.e., `(1 + O(2<sup>19))*2</sup>0 == 2`.
