Assignee: roed

CC:  saraedum

Keywords: polynomial representation

If $K$ is an unramified extension of $Z_p$ whose generator is $a$, this patch implements a method `polynomial` which takes as input an element $x$ in $K$ and outputs a polynomial $P$ with coefficients in $Z_p$ such that $P(a) = x$.


```
sage: K.<a> = Qq(5^3)
sage: a.polynomial()
(1 + O(5^20))*x + (O(5^20))
```

Yeah, this is intended.  When you pass in a value for `n` it gives you the coefficient of p<sup>n</sup>, rather than the `n`th term in the list.  I've updated the test (but haven't pushed yet).

The docstring says that (since this is not a field) summing these with powers of pi should return the original element, i.e., `(1 + O(2<sup>19))*2</sup>0 == 2`.
