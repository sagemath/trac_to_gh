Conflicts with #23707 and #22391. I'll try again with the next beta.

In `matrix/special.py`, there is also `from .matrix import is_Matrix`. Should that also be replaced?

Replying to [comment:6 tscrim]:

Sure. Although I don't understand why this wasn't causing doctest failures...

Since this was reviewed before, I'm setting this back to positive review.

I would have been happier with a patchbot check.

Patchbot check passed.

This is not what I would call deprecation...

```
sage: from sage.matrix.matrix import Matrix
/opt/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/IPython/core/interactiveshell.py:2881: DeprecationWarning: the module sage.matrix.matrix is deprecated, import from sage.structure.element instead
See http://trac.sagemath.org/24096 for details.
  exec(code_obj, self.user_global_ns, self.user_ns)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
