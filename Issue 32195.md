# Issue 32195: Modularization of sagelib: Break out a separate package sagemath-polyhedra

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32432

Original creator: mkoeppe

Original creation time: 2021-08-28 17:49:41

CC:  @kliem tscrim aschilling

We define a superset of `sagemath-categories` that is large enough to work with rational polyhedra, including running most doctests

In:
- `install_requires` on `pplpy`

Out:
- symbolics

Initial draft. Needs more work to get integers/rationals to work, and need to include vectors/matrices

One of the next issues is use of `Matrix_integer_dense` in `combinatorial_polyhedron.list_of_faces` etc.

This version compiles now (I had to butcher `combinatorial_polyhedron` a bit)
and is able to run (but not pass) doctests

The try...except importing can be replaced by the new abstract base classes from #32566

This slowly starts to make sense.

Next few issues:


```

But that's enough for today.
