# Issue 19823: binomial of polynomial should be polynomial

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20060

Original creator: chapoton

Original creation time: 2016-02-15 21:45:29

CC:  rws

Keywords: binomial

This is *very* inconvenient:

```
sage: x=polygen(QQ,'x')
sage: binomial(x,3).parent()
Symbolic Ring
```

Note that the function from `sage.arith.misc` is good

```
sage: x = polygen(ZZ)
sage: sage.arith.misc.binomial(x,3)
1/6*x^3 - 1/2*x^2 + 1/3*x
sage: parent(_)
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field
```

It is the symbolic wrapper which is to blame...

it seems to work now.

is there a doctest for the correction in #20312 ?

Not in `symbolic/function.pyx` but where it is used. But you are right.

so maybe the branch here is useful ?
