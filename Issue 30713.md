Is this necessary? I'm not sure how to test, but here's what I did: with #29719 (new flint), I used

```
$ ./configure --with-python=/usr/bin/python3 --enable-download-from-upstream-url --with-system-flint=no
$ make flint
```
`flint` was downloaded properly. Since that worked, I tried a pip package:

```
$ ./sage -i biopython
```
That also worked. What should I be testing?

Edit: hold on, trying again after editing `build/bin/sage-system-python`.

I may be too optimistic, and it may depend, for example, on the version of OS X. Does the version of Python 3 depend on the version of Xcode, or the OS version, or something else? Anyway, this testing was done on Big Sur, although the same version of Python (3.8.2) is present on 10.15.7. The previous problems were reported with Python 3.7, I think.

I don't set any environment variables with names starting "SAGE".
