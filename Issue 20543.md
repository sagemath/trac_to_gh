When working with preimage trees it is usefull to compute more than just the first preimages of a given point. The ticket is to add a parameter to rational_preimages() to specify how far back to find preimages.  I.e. find all points Q with `f^k(Q) =P` for specified `k`.

I think this looks good. The code makes sense and appears to work as intended. I just found some really minor things:

-algebraic_scheme.py
- line 2780 - change TypeError message to all lowercase
- Old issues present before this ticket that maybe could be addressed here:
- line 2680 - ``False`` to ```False```
- line 2711 - some spacing in ProjectiveSpace calls and in lists of defining polynomials

-projective_homset.py
- line 182 - the sorted() function takes any iterable and returns a list, so it shouldn't be necessary to convert rat_points to a list first

-projective_morphism.py
- line 3920 spacing around '>'
- lines 3790 - 3793, formatting issues: ```k``th` and ``k`th` don't seem to render well, and perhaps
  ``P`` and ``Q`` should be replaced with ```P```, ```Q```.
- some ProjectiveSpace calls in examples of rational_preimages don't have any spacing in the arguments
