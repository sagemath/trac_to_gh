CC:  @embray @kiwifb @mkoeppe @dcoudert

By default, TLS (aka Thread-Local Storage) is enabled in flint.
However, it contradicts to NTL configured without threads (`NTL_THREADS=off`), and in particular non-GNU linkers might refuse to link flint
(actually happens on FreeBSD).

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27764

Moving this to 9.3.
