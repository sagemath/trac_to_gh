there is a wrong http://ftp.kaist.ac.kr/sage/spkg/upstream/e_antic/e-antic-0.1.8.tar.gz - found on attempt to install. 
So the tarball https://www.labri.fr/perso/vdelecro/e-antic/e-antic-0.1.8.tar.gz
has to be manually downloaded.

Weird?

Looks like some server misconfiguration:

I have asked this mirror to be removed - https://github.com/sagemath/website/issues/200

That is weird that KAIST would not be interested in hosting Sage any more.  Do we have any contact info?  I know someone there, though I do not think he uses Sage nor their web servers, but I could ask him to poke around.

It's nothing Sage-specific: the KAIST mirror is down: https://ftp.kaist.ac.kr currently says

Let's discuss mirror at https://github.com/sagemath/website/issues/200
and e-antic update here.

The problem is that they are delivering this error message with HTTP status 200 OK - which is wrong

Tests at â€‹https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/actions/runs/191867544 (ci-#27952-#29766-#3360).

Changing status from new to needs_review.

Comment by dimpase created at 2020-08-03 11:13:20

are these GH actions with `./configure --enable-e_antic` ?

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2020-08-07 17:22:30

The workflow titled "Test optional packages with tox" runs the optional packages.
It's right next to the one I linked, at https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/actions/runs/191867540

Changing status from needs_review to positive_review.

LGTM. It doesn't seem to break `normaliz`, which is all that we use it for. According to https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/actions/runs/201953190 the installation also works, not just for me.
