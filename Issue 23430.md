See [this ask.sagemath question](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/38486/build-error-when-uploading-notebooks-in-sage).  _Apparently_ if you try to use sagenb to upload a zip of notebooks after starting it via the export app something goes haywire.  Given the details on the post (namely, the exporter stops working at all once this happens) I'm not going to test it myself, but hopefully this will give enough details to know what is happening.
