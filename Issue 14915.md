IPython allows running Tkinter (and many other GUI toolkits) so that the GUI doesn't block the IPython interpreter.  In Sage 5.10 and earlier this worked in Sage's interpreter as well as vanilla IPython.  However, in Sage 5.11 it only works in vanilla IPython.  A minimal example (for both Linux and OS X) is:


```
sage: import Tkinter
sage: root = Tkinter.Tk()
```


Pre version 5.11, this brings up a small window titled "tk"; in Sage 5.11 it does nothing.  In 5.11 you can manually start the Tk gui via:


```
sage: root.mainloop()
```


but you don't get a new interpreter prompt until you quit the Tk GUI.  

I strongly suspect the issue is the new IPython inputhook (in "sage/misc/inputhook.pyx") that was added in Sage 5.11 as part of #14523.

I should have mentioned the following work-around in my initial report: 

```
sage: %gui none
```

or what is essentially equivalently 

```
sage: import IPython.lib.inputhook as ih
sage: ih.clear_inputhook()
```

This is why I think the new inputhook is the source of the change in behavior.
