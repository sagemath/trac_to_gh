There are also test failures for this file when compiled with the default XCode compiler.  See [this comment](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/11881#comment:54) for details.  See also [this comment](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/11881#comment:70).

In fact, there are failures *only* when using XCode 4.  When I reported this ticket, I accidentally compiled the Sage library with Apple's compiler.  With #12369, interrupts work.
