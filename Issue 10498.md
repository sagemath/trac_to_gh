There is a bug with axes_pad. Even when set to 0, there are a few pixels on the right of the figure that are padded. Attached is an image to show this behaviour.

Although axes_pad is set to 0, some padding can be seen on the right.

> What was the command used to create that graphic?


```
matrix_plot([[2,1,0]], axes_pad=0)
```


This also happens with this:

```
matrix_plot([[2,1,0],[2,1,0]], axes_pad=0)
```

This appears to be fixed now. It can be closed after adding doctests.
