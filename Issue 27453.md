This looks like a very interesting addition. But I will be on holidays until next week, so can't review it until then.

This is impressive. I would argue this looks a little better than its plot:

```
sage: B = BraidGroup(5)
sage: K = Knot(B([-1,2,3,3,-2,1,1,1,2,-3,4,2,1,3]))
sage: unicode_art(K)

One question, would it be possible to make this work for links as well?

I will not do much more work on this. It may be doable for links, but I will not do that.

I confirmed that this does not work OOTB for links. This is good with me. Thanks.
