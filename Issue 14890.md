# Issue 14890: cleanup of matchpoly.pyx

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15127

Original creator: chapoton

Original creation time: 2013-08-30 11:42:32

CC:  ncohen

Keywords: matchpoly

The file matchpoly.pyx sometimes appear in failing doctests for unrelated tickets.

This tickets aims to

* clean the code (pep8 standard)
* make the long test on trees a bit shorter (up to 11 vertices instead of 12)
* make sure that the test on trees give more information when it fails
* removed useless lines (on binomials) in the tests

Helloooooo !

Why would you replace `[1..9]` by a call to range ? I wrote that so that users could learn this different way of writing code.. And that's in a test, not in Sage's code `O_o`

I don't see the point of writing in 3 lines a test that is clearer with 2 lines, only to have longer messages when it fails, as it is not supposed to fail anyway `O_o`

I wrote this patch because this `f******` matchpoly.pyx makes the tests fails in the patch #12186, and in some other places, sometimes, even if #12028 is closed.

I would like to try to help solving this issue, but I am not able to do much..

By curiosity, is `ellipsis_range` python code or sage code ?

Yoooooooo !

I do not understand to which test you refer. What is it that you included in this patch, and which fix a problem from #12186 ? Or do you just mean that you worked on this file because of a bug in #12186, and that you just fixed some lines in it while you were at it ?

As for `ellipsis_range`, I'd say that it is ours :


```
sage: import_statements(ellipsis_range)
from sage.misc.misc import ellipsis_range
```


But I have no idea of what it means `O_O;;;`

Hello Nathann,

I am referring to this failure:

http://patchbot.sagemath.org/log/12186/Fedora/19/x86_64/3.10.4-300.fc19.x86_64/desktop/2013-08-22%2001:08:17%20+0100?short

I would rather think that #12186 is not the cause of the problem, but something inside matchpoly.pyx is the cause.

And yes, I worked on that in the hope that the next time that matchpoly.pyx is failing in some seemingly unrelated ticket, one would get better error messages.

Then I started putting things into pep8, for no special reason.


Concerning the use of [1..5], I do not like it, because it only works through the preparser, which transform it into ellipsis_range. But well..

What should we do with this ticket:
* close it as invalid ?
* replace it by something simpler, just moving the import a few lines down in the tests ?
* or by something just trying to get better info in case a failing test in the "trees" ?

Oh.

Okayyyy...

Well. I don't know what this `ellipsis_range` thing is, but this `[1..5]` is pretty clear when it is written, and I use it when I want to show code in such a way that it can be easily understood. `range(5)` is something that you have to explain.

> What should we do with this ticket:

Well, I was about to give it a positive review, so you tell me `^^;`

Well. Basically this patch does nothing but cosmetic changes. Why don't we just merge it ? It doesn't do anything bad.

Hello Nathann,

oh. I thought that you were rather opposed to this patch, that's why I proposed to close it or to simplify the patch. If you are not, then of course I would be happy if you give a positive review.

Well. The additional lines in the test make it thicker and harder to read, but well if you needed it at some point that's a sufficient reason. And I remember that I wrote this `[1..5]` thing to advertise this notation to new users but it's not a very bad thing anyway, and I can still do it at other places `:-P`

Anyway, let's get this in `;-)`

Good niiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight !
