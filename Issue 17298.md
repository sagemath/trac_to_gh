# Issue 17298: Homogenize failes for affine space over function fields

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17535

Original creator: bhutz

Original creation time: 2014-12-21 13:42:39

Assignee: bhutz

The following code fails


```
K.<c> = FunctionField(QQ)
A.<x> = AffineSpace(K,1)
f = Hom(A,A)([x^2 + c])
f.homogenize(1)
```


The issue appear to be that the the LCM of the denominators is the integer 1 in this example, so the substitution fails. Coercing that LCM into the base ring fixes at least this particular example. More testing is needed to determine if there are any other issues with function fields.

fixed and added the doctest for dynatomic polynomials that uncovered this.
