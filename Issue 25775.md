# Issue 25775: Fix bug concerning restrictions of tensorfields

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/26012

Original creator: @FlorentinJ

Original creation time: 2018-08-06 15:19:49

CC:  egourgoulhon

Keywords: restriction, extension, tensorfield, manifold

The attributes `_restrictions_graph` and `_extensions_graph`, introduced in #25417 were not affected by the method `_del_derived`, whereas `_restrictions` was, causing some issues.

Do you have an explicit example where something was going wrong? If so, could you add it as a test to some `TESTS::` block with a message saying something like ```_restrictions_graph`` and ``_extensions_graph`` was not changed (see :trac:`26012`)::`
