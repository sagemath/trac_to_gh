# Issue 21508: Standardize modulo operator % on real numbers

Issue created by migration from Trac.

For any subset of the real numbers we change the modulo operator to be

  x%y is the unique x' between [0,y) of the form x + ny with n integer

This affects in particular QQ and RR that previously implement other operations.
