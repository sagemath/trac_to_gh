SHRX is a BMI2 instruction, only available in Intel Haswell and later processors. This makes Sage crash on startup on previous models. Looking at ./src/build/cythonized/sage/libs/singular/polynomial.cpp we see that the build system picked up the host's instruction sets:

```
        "extra_compile_args": [
            "-fPIC",
            "-mmmx",
            "-mpopcnt",
            "-msse",
            "-msse2",
            "-msse3",
            "-msse4.1",
            "-msse4.2",
