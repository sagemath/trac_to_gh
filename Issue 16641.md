# Issue 16641: faster is_prime

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16878

Original creator: vdelecroix

Original creation time: 2014-08-25 10:31:53

CC:  nochen

Right now to test if a Sage integer is prime it is faster to call `prime_range` rather than `.is_prime()`...

```
sage: timeit("bool(prime_range(121,122))", number=10000)
10000 loops, best of 3: 1.09 µs per loop
sage:  timeit("bool(prime_range(1009,1010))", number=10000)
10000 loops, best of 3: 1.2 µs per loop
```

versus

```
sage: timeit("121.is_prime()", number=10000)
10000 loops, best of 3: 5.3 µs per loop
sage: timeit("1009.is_prime()", number=10000)
10000 loops, best of 3: 4.19 µs per loop
```


The patch do some tiny modifications in `integer.pyx` and we get

```
sage: timeit("121.is_prime()", number=10000)
10000 loops, best of 3: 812 ns per loop
sage: timeit("1009.is_prime()", number=10000)
10000 loops, best of 3: 730 ns per loop
```

I would prefer not to include stuff from `pari/pari.h` directly, but instead use the declarations from `src/sage/libs/pari/decl.pxi`. And please rebase this over #15767.

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2014-08-25 10:51:23

Can you also change the value of `PARI_PSEUDOPRIME_LIMIT` (see PARI docs) to `2^64` and use `mpz_fits_ui()` before calling `mpz_get_ui()`


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2014-08-25 10:53:10

Instead of changing `_pari_()` to `_pari_c()` everywhere, wouldn't

```
cpdef _pari_(self)
```

accomplish the same thing?


---

Comment by vdelecroix created at 2014-08-25 11:05:37

Thanks for the remark. One question: are we sure that 2<sup>64</sup> fits into an unsigned long on any platform? Otherwise we can not safely call `uisprime` and `uisprimepower`. If not I will use a double check

```
if mpz_cmp(PARI_PSEUDOPRIME_LIMIT, v) > 0 and mpz_cmp_ui(v, ULONG_MAX) < 0:
     # use uisprime or uisprimepower
```

`10000000000000000 != 2^64` :-)

I don't think we should lower `PARI_PSEUDOPRIME_LIMIT` because it's also used in places where it's not bounded by `ULONG_MAX`, see `next_prime()` for example.

Personally, I would assume that `ULONG_MAX` < `2^64` and just use `mpz_fits_uint_p()`.

This is bikeshedding I know, but wouldn't

mpz_ui_pow_ui(PARI_PSEUDOPRIME_LIMIT, 2, 64)
```

be easier to understand?

Great! I especially like that now `isprimepower` is accessible.

In my last commit, I added the keyword `certificate` to `is_prime_power` in order to get back the pair (n,p) such that the integer is p<sup>n</sup> (following pari convention). I think it is worth it!

Note the treatment of 1 is different in`is_prime_powers` and `prime_powers`... either we fix it in that ticket or it can wait #16880.

I like the idea, but I'm not sure that I like the interface with the `certificate` keyword.

How about a separate method `write_as_prime_power()` (raising `ArithmeticError` if it's not a prime power) or something?

Note that there is already `factor` that does the job. Moreover, having two methods (`is_prime_power` and `write_as_prime_power`) with the exact same code looks bad as well. From my implementation, it is clear that the `certificate` keyword only modifies the output.

My design choice also comes from the fact that this `certifcate` keyword is already in use (see `sage.graphs` or `sage.combinat.designs`). I am not particularly happy with it but I find it better than having two functions.

On the other hand, treating a Python exception takes time, and this `is_prime_power` is the kind of function that I might use in time critical code.

This takes about a second before this ticket and really long after this ticket:

```
sage: with proof.WithProof('arithmetic', False):  
....:    sage.rings.arith.is_prime_power((10^1000 + 453)^2)
```

In fact, it get so slow that the ARM buildbot times out in 

```
sage -t --long src/sage/rings/finite_rings/constructor.py
    Timed out
**********************************************************************
...
sage: k = FiniteField(10^1000 + 453, proof=False) ## line 230 ##
sage: k = FiniteField((10^1000 + 453)^2, 'a', proof=False)      # long time -- about 5 seconds ## line 231 ##

very strange indeed

False
sage: sage.rings.arith.is_prime_power((10^1001 + 453)^2)  # very fast
False
sage: sage.rings.arith.is_prime_power((10^1000 + 453)^2)
... <still waiting> ...
```



---

Comment by vdelecroix created at 2014-09-07 08:33:12

I see... seems to be because we do not care about the flag `proof=True` or `proof=False` anymore in `is_prime_power`. We should still rely on `is_pseudoprime_small_power` when `proof=False`.

And by the way, in `is_pseudoprime_small_power` the choice of the keyword to return `(n,p)` is `get_data`. I guess we should change the `certificate` in `is_prime_power` to `get_data` as well.

In `is_pseudoprime_small_power`, the fixed exponent bound of 1024 is clearly not acceptable.

The PARI implementation of `isprimepower()` is as follows: first do trial division by small primes up to 100. If we do not find a divisor, then find out if the number is a perfect power. This is now a lot cheaper since the exponent can be at most `log(n)/log(p)`, where `n` is the number to check and `p` the smallest prime that we didn't check in the trial division.

But overall, I would prefer PARI to add a new function `ispseudoprimepower()` such that Sage can interface it.

Me too. I saw that you already submit the question [http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/archives/pari-dev-1409/msg00011.html](http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/archives/pari-dev-1409/msg00011.html)...

On the other hand, we need a reasonable fix in order to get this ticket in.

Comment by vbraun created at 2014-09-23 11:26:47

Jeroen, did you end up writing a pari patch? Maybe we can use the current `is_pseudoprime_small_power` until there is a better implementation?

Not yet, but it would be trivial to do that. I will add it to #16997.

Turns out adding the PARI patch to #16997 was the easiest (since there would have been merge conflicts otherwise). It's now done.

Hi,

Good news: Karim recently committed a `ispseudoprimepower` in pari ([commit 0f20474](http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=pari.git;a=commitdiff;h=0f20474)).

I'm doing various fixes, like remove `is_pseudoprime_small_power`.

I think it would be better to rebase #17852 on this ticket, since this ticket removes lots of things that #17852 fixes.

Fine for me.


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2015-02-26 10:58:26

I would also like to switch around the `get_data` result: when given `p^n` as input, I would find it more natural to return `(p, n)` instead of `(n, p)`. What do you think?


---

Comment by vdelecroix created at 2015-02-26 11:07:40

gp is doing the other way around: it returns `k` as the main argument since it is compatible with the boolean answer. But doing `(p,n)` will be consistent with `Integer.perfect_power` so I would go for it.

1. Now `arith.is_prime_power` and `arith.is_pseudoprime_power` do not handle negative powers anymore (i.e. rational numbers `p^-n`). This is different from previous versions.

2. In `Integer.is_prime_power` why did you use a `long` for `n` and `p` instead of an `unsigned long`. Is pari `uisprimepower` not able to handle up to `ULONG_MAX`?

Yes, this was discussed on `sage-devel` and the former behaviour was considered to be a bug => no deprecation needed

> 2. In `Integer.is_prime_power` why did you use a `long` for `n` and `p` instead of an `unsigned long`. Is pari `uisprimepower` not able to handle up to `ULONG_MAX`?
I assume that `pari` can handle it, but `smallInteger()` for the result takes a `long`.

True, I forgot about here and it is [this thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/v6s2RI4dd1Q).

I see... I do not like the fact that we avoid pari `uisprimepower` for the range between `LONG_MAX` and `ULONG_MAX`. Especially because otherwise we import the `proof` module which takes some non negligible amount of time. We can either get rid of `smallInteger` (that would be bad if either `p` or `n` would be below `256`) or add a `smallunsignedInteger`

```
cdef inline Integer smallunsignedInteger(unsigned long value):
    """
    This is the fastest way to create a (likely) small positive Integer.
    """
    cdef Integer z
    if value <= small_pool_max:
        return <Integer>small_pool[value - small_pool_min]
    else:
        z = PY_NEW(Integer)
        mpz_set_ui(z.value, value)
        return z
```


What do you think?


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2015-02-26 13:02:49

To be honest, I think introducing `smallunsignedInteger` is just overkill. I don't think it makes a big difference if the limit for a fast `is_prime_power` is `2^63` or `2^64`.
