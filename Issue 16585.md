Most of those came from the change of what `sl2` means. It also showed an inconsistency with the index set of the classical Lie algebras not being a `FiniteEnumeratedSet` (well, really something having a `cardinality`).

Math looks good, documentation looks good, all tests passed on my machine, and all documentation builds.
