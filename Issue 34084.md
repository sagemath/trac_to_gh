In `src/sage/combinat/sf/macdonald.py`, you let a space before `(`

```diff
+        self.register_coercion( phi)
```


In `src/sage/combinat/sf/witt.py`, why not removing the spaces after `self` (several places)

```diff
+            self   .register_coercion(self._p._module_morphism(self._p_to_w_on_basis, codomain=self))
```
