Numpy is having trouble with OpenBLAS 0.3.12 - https://numpy.org/devdocs/release/1.19.4-notes.html

So we should probably wait before we make updates to OpenBLAS

This ticket looks good to me.

There are a few occasions where https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/actions/runs/433187403

fails, but it looks like github related failures (running out of disk space etc). I can't discover any new failures and I checked that the doctests still look good.
