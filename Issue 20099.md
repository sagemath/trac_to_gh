I can't comment to much on the code itself since it is outside of my expertise. However, I can make some comments on formatting:

- Instead of `$` for latex, you should use ```. (We do support the former, but it is not as well-supported as the latter.)
- Instead of `\mathbb{F}_2`, you should use the macro `\GF{2}` for consistency with the rest of Sage.
- Error statements are not sentences, and as such, should not start with a uppercase letter nor have a period. This is also to be consistent with Python.
- The input block should be formatted like this:
  {{{
        - ``b`` -- either an integer or a tuple of `\GF{2}` elements of
          length ``self.n``
  }}}
- Remove the unnecessary parentheses here: `return (self.differential_uniformity() == 2)`.
- It is better to use `\mathrm{wt}` or `\operatorname{wt}` instead of `\text{wt}` (this is a latex thing having to do with spacing rules).
- You should use `.. MATH::` and have the equation indented on a separate line (with a blank line inbetween).
- Try to keep lines less than 80 characters long
- `autocorrelation_matrix` should be a ``@`cached_method`. Also make sure it returns an immutable matrix.
- All parentheses are extraneous here: `if ((m & 1) == 0):`. At least the outer ones are.
- I prefer `EXAMPLES::` even when there is only one example; more maybe added later and this is for consistency.
- In the doc, do ```TypeError```.

Otherwise the doc and coding style looks good. I could try to review the code if no one else steps forward.

Also is this your first contribution to Sage?

Hi,

Thanks, I have updated it according to the initial comment. And yes, this is my first contribution to SAGE.

Welcome to Sage! This is a very well-done submission.

Now that you are using ``@`cached_method`, you don't need the `_autocorrelation_matrix` attribute and can remove this code:

```
        try:
            return self._autocorrelation_matrix
        except AttributeError:
            pass
```

(similarly for the `linearly_approximation_matrix`).

Martin, will/can you be doing a review of the math parts?
