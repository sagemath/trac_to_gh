# Issue 26207: Use maximal cliques iterator for line graph

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Use a maximal cliques iterator in method `root_graph`, and use `root_graph` instead of line graph forbidden subgraph search in method `is_line_graph`. This was a long standing request to speed up the method.

Two little nitpicks: `not x in C` -> `x not in C` and you don't need the `\` in `add_edges` because of the parentheses. Once fixed, you can set a positive review on my behalf.

This should be re-targeted for 8.5.
