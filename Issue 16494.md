Hello, sorry, I could not resist to make a few small changes:

* make sure that the imports are only one per line
* removed two unused variables found by pyflakes
* add doc to one function

If you agree with that, you can set a positive review on my behalf.

Removing unused stuff is good, but just commenting out dead code and leaving it like a shit stain in the living room is bad ;-)
