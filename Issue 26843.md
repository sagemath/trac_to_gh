# Issue 26843: Draw ribbon graphs

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27080

Keywords: tete-a-tete graphs, graphs, combinatorial, geometr, draw,y

The goal is to implement a method in the class RibbonGraph that draws the thickening of the ribbon graph and the ribbon graph inside as a spine. 

We also aim to implement a method that draws cycles in the graph. In this way we can visually see the action of the monodromy given by a TatGraph on the homology of the surface.

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).
