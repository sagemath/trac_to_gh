now everything needed is already in GAP's tarball.

There is also no more copyright-induced hassle of having database_gap
separate and optional, although gap_packages still need a look at the respective copyrights (if we wish to make it standard)

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/26856

Is there a particular reason to merge `database_gap` into `gap_packages`?

```

historically, there were several reasons to have separate gap, database_gap and gap_packages, and do not install all the possible GAP packages

* largish sizes of downloads
* licensing issues---stuff in database_gap is not GPL-compatible before GAP 4.9 or 4.10
* non-working with libgap GAP kernel extensions

the 1st one, if we decide not to re-package original GAP tarball (and I am very much for not re-packaging), would be gone.

the 2nd one is (completely, from the point of view of GAP's LICENCE file) fixed since GAP 4.10 (or even 4.9).

the 3rd one is fixed by #22626, although this has to be verified.

Without `database_gap` in optional, everything passes. The trouble is that the failing tests are not tagged as optional, i.e. it should not matter whether `database_gap` is passed or not. 

Needless to say, these tests work at the Sage prompt just fine.

My hunch is that it might be related to the recent #25706, which unfortunately mixes `libgap` and `gap`. (Even if this were true, it would not take away the general flakiness of Sage's doctesting framework...)

In many cases, the mysterious failure of doctests is due to some changing interaction with the Python garbage collector. For example, adding an extra test might change the time when the garbage collector kicks in, causing these strange failures. This is especially true when weak references are involved. And the failing test involves the coercion model, which is using weak references.

I thought that we should remove `build/pkgs/gap/patches/nodefaultpackages.patch`, but this breaks pexpect interface to GAP. Note that `database_gap` and `gap_packages` do not not attempt to change the GAP package autoloading settings, so we should leave them as they are (it does not seem to be easy to fix).

It does not really matter. We can modify stripts starting `gap_console()` to enable autoloading (or not)...

I'm currently going for the minimal thing: get gap_packages spkg working the way it was.
We never had io package there, as it was breaking libgap in a bad way.
(there are open tickets about io package).

Does this sound like a good plan to you? We can postpone io package, it's not needed to be ready by the Debian freeze deadline.

and instead of `F_{\\alpha_{1}}` at few places it outputs `F\n1` - probably some unfortunate combination of escape sequences, dunno... (needless to say, the output at the sage prompt is fine).

I'm inclined to mark these as `# known bug` and deal with them later...

In the case of the "grape" package, ISTM the only actual "compiled" part is not technically part of the package at all, but rather it builds its own copy of nauty.  It ought to be able to use the nauty that's already included in Sage.

I probably won't stress about it too much in the short time that we have, but this should probably be fixed later.

I'm not so sure about that.  I don't think the doctest framework is doing that, but I'll look into it later.

Might be a "noisy line" thing - but why only while doctesting? Anyhow I have opened #26924 to deal with it.

I get these warnings when loading the relevant GAP packages in a vanilla GAP source tree, so I suppose they're normal and/or expected, or at least not indicative of any specific bug on our part.  But we probably need to at least temporarily silence them for the purposes of the code and tests they affect.

The one exception being the error about "qpa-version".  The name of the package is just "qpa", but its source directory is unusually named "qpa-version-<x.y>", so there's some code that's making an invalid assumption about GAP package names :sigh:

Yes, atlasrep does this.
However, you might have a stale libgap workspace. I saw this warning, and then went away after I wiped the workspaces out.

This one feels like a bug in the GAP and/or the QuaGroup package to me, but I confirmed that this is in fact the output provided by GAP and not a bug on our end, so for the time being there's nothing to be done (other than possibly report it upstream)

This is one of the problems with GAP objects not having a real string representation that isn't tied to how exactly they're printed to the screen :|

```

I see now, the output splitting is indeed done by default by GAP.  Again, this is no good, especially since it can depend on terminal width.  I haven't found yet exactly where GAP determines this, but I need to figure out a way to force it to just not do this at all, if possible.  That might be something to do as part of #22626 or as a follow-up.

the latest commit fixes these failures, which are two-fold:
missing dependencies and weird `-version`-part which one should strip.

I should still figure out how to suppress these `#I ...` lines...

By the way, I tried installing IO package in the same way as this ticket builds packages needing compilation, but this fails due to a "missing" header (not sure what goes wrong):

looks like the corresponding `-I` arguments all have an extra `/src` suffix, something that prevents this header to be found.

Lucky you, you don't read news. :-)
Gatwick was shut down for ~36 hours due to some not yet caught folks flying a largish drone over it several times, 700+ flights cancelled, 100s diverted. We were able to book an even cheaper flight, via Berlin, and get a full refund. They are open since this morning, and in fact the airline rebooked us for tonight, but we were in the full panic mode and got the other flight already...

they pass for me, both with and without `--long`, on Linux and on OSX.

I'd try `rm -rf local/share/gap local/include/gap` followed by `./sage -f gap gap_packages` followed up by `make build`, and then testing...

(and wiping out `~/.sage/gap/` too)

Nevermind, that was my fault.  Nevertheless, this still won't work: The outcomes of these tests depend on whether or not `gap_packages` is installed, so if it isn't then these will give different results.  I'm not sure what to do: Maybe these tests should be rewritten to be more flexible, or the code that's being tested needs to be rewritten to be less sensitive to what GAP packages are installed (if that's even possible...)

for transition from several to one package it's OK, I think.

For the remaining problematic tests I was able to fix them by manually calling (with some explanation in the prose) `libgap.set_seed(0)` before them (and modifying the expected output to correspond to that random seed).

It's unfortunate but possibly necessary, since the state of the PRNG can seem to depend on which packages were loaded and when, and for whatever reason those tests just happened to be very sensitive to this.

The issue here again seems to have something in part to do with the random number generator state in GAP.  In the case of:


```
sage: MG = GU(3,2).as_matrix_group()
sage: PG = MG.as_permutation_group()

Yes, this ticket gets rid of database_gap (everything there will be a part of gap package), so this is taken care of here.

I've also fixed the build failure here, so it's ready for review, I think.

I think they are.  I originally meant, as part of #22626 to deprecate these modules and disable their tests, but I forgot to add that to the work items.

While we're at it I'll go ahead and mark the tests to be skipped, and will handle the deprecation later, perhaps as part of #26959.
