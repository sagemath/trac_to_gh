CC:  @bhutz @pfili

Keywords: matrix action, scheme morphism

Created a left and right action by matrices on affine and projective polynomial scheme morphisms. The following examples now works:


```
sage: P.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(ZZ, 1)
sage: H = Hom(P,P)
sage: f = H([x^2 + y^2, y^2])
sage: matrix([[1,2], [0,1]]) * f
sage: f* matrix([[1,2], [0,1]]) 
```

Additionally, added conjugation by a matrix for affine dynamical systems. 

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23813

Here are some comments for the code syntax

- Examples:: -> EXAMPLES::

- blank line after EXAMPELS in __init__

- isinstance(, ) #space between args

- all functions should have one line description before examples

- def funct(, ) #space between parameters

- blank line at end of action file

- I don't think you use the AlgebraicScheme import in matrix_space


Now some issues from functionality testing

endomorphisms do not remain endomorphisms

```
P.<x, y> = ProjectiveSpace(QQ, 1)
H = Hom(P, P)
f = H([x^2 + y^2, y^2])
m = matrix([[1,1], [0,1]])
f.is_endomorphism(),(m*f).is_endomorphism(), (f*m).is_endomorphism()
```


Affine scheme morhisms don't have the action function

```
P.<x, y> = AffineSpace(QQ, 2)
H = Hom(P, P)
f = H([x^2 + y^2, y^2])
m = matrix([[1,1,1], [0,1,0],[1,0,0]])
f*m, m*f
```


I think it would helpful to separate the errors

```
P.<x, y> = ProjectiveSpace(QQ, 1)
H = Hom(P, P)
f = H([x^2 + y^2, y^2])
m = matrix([[1]])
f.as_dynamical_system().conjugate(m)
```


When the matrix ring is contained in the morphism base ring it can't work out the parent

```
P.<x, y> = ProjectiveSpace(CC, 1)
H = Hom(P, P)
f = H([x^2 + y^2, y^2])
m = matrix(QQ,[[1,1], [1,0]])
m*f
```

even more troubling

```
P.<x, y> = ProjectiveSpace(RR, 1)
H = Hom(P, P)
f = H([x^2 + RR(sqrt(2))*y^2, y^2])
m = matrix(QQ,[[1,1], [1,0]])
m*f
```


Acting on a dynamical system gives back a projective morphism instead of a dynamical system

```
P.<x, y> = ProjectiveSpace(QQ, 1)
H = Hom(P, P)
f = H([x^2 + y^2, y^2])
m = matrix([[1,1], [1,0]])
fd=f.as_dynamical_system()
m*fd
```

I didn't see a new commit, but the conflict seems to be worked out. However, the code doesn't work


```
sage: K.<w>=QuadraticField(5)
sage: P.<x, y> = ProjectiveSpace(K, 1)
sage: f = DynamicalSystem([x^2 + 2*y^2, y^2])
sage: m = matrix(QQ,[[1,1], [1,0]])
sage: f.conjugate(m,minimal=True)
NameError: global name 'number_field_elements_from_algebraics' is not defined
```


I think this is probably better as a separate function as I can see more uses for this. Then conjugate can call that function based on the minimal parameter.

I'm also tempted to separate that out from matrix actions and make it its own ticket. What do you think?

The functionality of the action looks good, but there are few things to do here:

- MatrixPolymapAction: functions need description + INPUT

- affine_morphism: delete multiplier function (the deprecated function was removed in #27900)

- careful with #23174 as I get a duplicate definition of M when both branch branches are merged in. I don't think you need 975 redefining M since you already have that defined as N on 969. Then the for loop on 976 should be with N.

- conjugate is giving a TypeError and the action a ValueError with bad matrices. These error types should match.

- I seem to be getting two doc test dehomogenization failures, affine_morphism and projective_morphism that are minor and need to be addressed
