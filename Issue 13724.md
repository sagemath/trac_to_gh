My computer has no processor, and that's because `sage -tp 4` refuses to test any file whose path contains the string `"/."`. That's a problem, for on my machine `SAGE_ROOT=/home/ncohen/.Sage` and all files get filtered. This patch removes this test, hoping that it was totally useless in the first place, which sounds.... unlikely `O_o`

Apply the patch to SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/

That's not a bug (skipping files in directories starting with `.`), but a feature.

The real bug is the exception raised (if no files to test remain).

Maybe the test shouldn't filter the absolute path, but the path relative to `SAGE_ROOT`. I don't see why we should skip directories starting with `.` if they are not in the Sage library (if I want to test some random collection of files in one of my own directories, why can't the directory start with a `.`?).

I use a computer on which I am not root, I can only write stuff to my home directory, and I have many things to install. So I don't want to see then when I do "ls" in my home directory. Happened to me thousands of times.

Then what's the problem with filtering the `/.` that appear in SAGE_ROOT ?

Perhaps there's a middle way that satisfies both leif and nathan: I can see why filenames starting with a "." should be skipped during discovery and recursion, but if a dotted filename gets explicitly included in the pathname, the user is clearly asking for testing that file, so why not?

Compare the behaviour of `ls -R <path name>`, for instance. It won't list/recurse into any dotted files *within* `<path name>`, but it will happily work if any of the components of `<path name>` have a dot in them.

I don't know where/how `make ptest` gets a list of to-be-tested files, but I'd think that you want to filter out dotted files there (i.e., when you're discovering new leafs/nodes), rather than when you've assembled a full path name already. That basically means: let `populatefilelist` do the hard work, not `skip` (in fact, shouldn't everything of skip be absorbed in there?)

(But really ... why *would* you want to install software in a dotted directory? Do you want to hide it from your sysadmin?)

Anyway, your current patch is fragile and not an improvement (other than that it apparently fixes your particular problem). Any time you require a `realpath` you're probably doing something wrong.

Create some [visible] subdirectory that contains all the stuff that you don't want to see?

(On [other people's] Windows for example, the first thing I usually do is to create a `Deskbottom` folder, to move the useless things to... :-) )

I'm not sure what you mean by that.  Of course RCSs' directories can be located anywhere, not just below `SAGE_ROOT`, and even for the latter aren't necessarily [just] Mercurial's `.hg` directories.

Sounds good to me.

I agree about using the path as presented by the user. Note though that `realpath` is used several other places in the file, for example line 308:

```
if os.path.realpath(appendstr).startswith(BUILD_DIR):
```

where `BUILD_DIR` was also defined using `realpath`. So if it's problematic, other parts of the file need to be fixed (as does the [Python documentation](http://docs.python.org/2/library/os.path.html?highlight=realpath#os.path.realpath), unless they're using the word "canonical" in a, ahem, noncanonical way).

I think he means, what's wrong with just filtering subdirectories of `SAGE_ROOT` (and its subdirectories) which start with `.`? This would be consistent with Nils' suggestion.

`O_o`

It's my home folder. Not Sage's. It's there because I invited it, but it's not about to make rules there `:-P`

> I'm not sure what you mean by that.  Of course RCSs' directories can be located anywhere, not just below `SAGE_ROOT`, and even for the latter aren't necessarily [just] Mercurial's `.hg` directories.

Oh. I mean that we could ask Sage to ignore the `/.` that belong to SAGE_ROOT, and not the other ones. Let us assume that my SAGE_ROOT variable contains a `/.` (it does). Then SAGE_ROOT/subfolder/ will *not* be ignored, but SAGE_ROOT/.subfolder/ would !

This way, no problem with .hg folders located in SAGE_ROOT. But I can type `make ptestlong`.

Well, we used `realpath()` and the like in a few places (mostly to check whether two filenames actually refer to the same file), but never fully "expanded" `SAGE_ROOT` "from the beginning", i.e., in the main `sage` script.  I recall you implemented the latter, so it's IMHO fair to say (or assume) you were in favour of doing so...

Since then, nearly no Sage component ever sees what the user specified (or is willing to use), hence presents the user only and always the fully dereferenced form, which is certainly annoying to a couple of people (and also causes some technical trouble, as mentioned earlier).

This is not true, go and read the patch at #5852 and notice that

```
SAGE_ROOT=`realpath    "$0" 2> /dev/null` || \
```

was already there.

Hi Nathann,

It looks like this will be superseded by the work at #12415: at least, the patches there completely remove the file sage-ptest. So I think we should close this and you should take the discussion there. Note that there has been a lot of activity on that ticket lately – it has not stagnated – and putting in a patch here would just cause them to rebase. Also, they may still be ignoring paths containing "/.", so you should intervene if you want that changed.

Okay, I was wrong. It looks like #12415 will ignore files in directories starting with "." within the Sage library, but they will have no problem testing files if the entire Sage directory is contained in "/home/user/.Sage/...". So I propose we don't work further on this ticket and just wait for #12415 (or help with it, if that's possible).
