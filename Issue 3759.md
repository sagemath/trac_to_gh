0.png through 9.png and all the .db files are generated by graph_database.py, which Emily is working on right now.

This just leaves `sage.png`, `sage0.png`, `sage1.png`, `sage2.png`, `sage3.png`, `sage4.png`, `sage5.png` and `sage6.png`.

This does not completely resolve issue.  We need to open a new ticket.   See #3871
