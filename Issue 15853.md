# Issue 15853: Set() should return an empty Set

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16090

Original creator: mathzeta2

Original creation time: 2014-04-07 21:35:27

Keywords: set, days57

`Set` with no argument is currently an error. It should be changed to follow what Python's built-in container constructors do: return an empty container.

(After a fix to the time machine:) I think it is.

You might argue what the default value should be. It probably should not be `None` because of #16092.

I would have taken an empty tuple, but it does not matter much I guess..
