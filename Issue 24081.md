# Issue 24081: Conversion failure CBF -> CDF

Issue created by migration from Trac.

It should be possible to convert complex balls to a complex double

```
sage: RDF(RBF(1))
1.0
sage: CDF(CBF(1))
1.0
sage: CDF(CBF(1+I))
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: can't convert complex ball to float
```

(it works perfectly with `ComplexField`)
