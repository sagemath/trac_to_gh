# Issue 33169: Automatic image build is broken on GitLab

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33406

Currently, images for https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/sagemath/sagemath are not built automatically anymore. The main issue seems to be that there are no dedicated runners registered there anymore.

There are likely other problems since the [GitLab](GitLab) Pipeline has not been running for ages now.

(I am not planning to do anything about this at the moment. There does not seem to be a real interest in using [GitLab](GitLab) for [SageMath](SageMath) development. I just needed an issue to reference in the README on Docker Hub.)
