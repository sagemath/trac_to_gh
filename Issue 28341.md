There are many doctest failures:

```
sage -t --long src/sage/manifolds/differentiable/mixed_form_algebra.py  # 10 doctests failed
sage -t --long src/sage/manifolds/differentiable/mixed_form.py  # 125 doctests failed
```

Ah yes, damn it. I fixed it during the merge into the metaticket #28519 and forgot to adapt it here, too. I'll perform a new doctest as soon as possible.
