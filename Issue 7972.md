`show_identifiers` works fine on the command line, but not in the notebook.

```
When I use show_identifiers() from the command line, the behaviour is
as described.  But if I use it from a notebook, then it returns an
array with 1746 elements, even if I call reset().  The first few
elements are

['paretovariate', 'is_MPolynomial', 'cartan_matrix',
'is_NumberFieldElement', 'elliptic_curves', 'sleep',

Would it be more sensible not to display these omnipresent
identifiers?  It's hard to find my own variables in the mess!
(I'm on 10.6, core 2 duo, running 4.3, if this is a bug)

Cheers,
Felix

When I use show_identifiers() from the command line, the behaviour is
as described.  But if I use it from a notebook, then it returns an
array with 1746 elements, even if I call reset().  The first few
elements are

['paretovariate', 'is_MPolynomial', 'cartan_matrix',
'is_NumberFieldElement', 'elliptic_curves', 'sleep',

Would it be more sensible not to display these omnipresent
identifiers?  It's hard to find my own variables in the mess!
(I'm on 10.6, core 2 duo, running 4.3, if this is a bug)

Cheers,
Felix

I can replicate this on Linux (the machine mod.math). With a notebook
session of Sage 4.3.1.rc0, issue "show_identifiers()". Then issue
"reset()" and execute "show_identifiers()" again. This time, I
received a NameError:

Traceback (most recent call last):
 File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
 File "_sage_input_7.py", line 4, in <module>
   open("___code___.py","w").write(_support_.preparse_worksheet_cell(base64.b64decode("c2hvd19pZGVudGlmaWVycygp"),globals())+"\n");
execfile(os.path.abspath("___code___.py"))
 File "", line 1, in <module>

NameError: name 'base64' is not defined
