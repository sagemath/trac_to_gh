Versioning the directory name is a good idea, but I'm not sure about hard-coding it `sage-env`.  There is no obvious pointer that this would need to be updated when updating the IPython/Jupyter versions in Sage.  This will inevitably bit-rot.  Instead it should read the package version from somewhere else.

I'm thinking each spkg should have its own "sage environment setup participant hook"--i.e. "here is a bash snippet *specific* to this package that should be sourced during `sage-env`."  That would go a long way toward making `sage-env` more comprehensible, and keeping spkgs better self-contained.

I don't think it makes sense for Sage to document **all** environment variables used by **all** packages of Sage. It should document Sage-specific environment variables, not those of packages inside the Sage distribution.

> But definitely needs work because you're not exactly hardcoding the folders; if a user happens to have them already set in his/her environment, this is asking for trouble.

No, if the user has them already set in his environment, we assume that the user knows what he is doing. I see the `JUPYTER_CONFIG_DIR` in `sage-env` simply as a reasonable default that users should still be able to override.

We don't document variables that are solely set and used internally, but those the user may want to set or modify, those that Sage sets and a user/developer may find to be valuable to use, and those that we change *although the user is likely to expect we honor his/her setting*, for example `MPLCONFIGDIR`.

Besides that your assumption is presumably wrong in most cases, then "hardcoding" is the wrong term.

`IPYTHONDIR`  as well?  `PYTHONPATH`?  `PYTHONHOME`?  What else?

(Btw., `CC`, `CXX` etc. get overridden in case Sage's GCC is installed; why don't you respect a user's setting there as well?)

If you really want to create more of such pitfalls, the need to document this is even greater, i.e., it needs to get mentioned in more prominent locations such as READMEs as well, and a warning should get issued unless it is totally clear the user did intentionally override one of these "default" settings.

Only a tiny percentage of the Sage users will even know these environment variables exist, what their meaning is, and whether they're perhaps (unintentionally) set in their environment.

Even "Sage *developers*" are mostly mathematicians, and not all of them have computers, operating systems, shells etc. as their beloved hobby.

`JUPYTER_CONFIG_DIR` what this ticket is about. It is perfectly fine if users don't know about this variable.

... that already violates the general convention of Sage to not modify anything outside `$SAGE_ROOT`, `$DOT_SAGE` (by default `$HOME/.sage/`), besides `$TMPDIR`.

Other exceptions are for example `$SAGE_BUILD_DIR`, but

* that's well-documented,
* it defaults to some location below `$SAGE_ROOT`,
* the user has to explicitly set it,
* there can't be any confusion (or unintentional collision) because the variable name starts with `SAGE_`, so (hopefully) isn't used by any other application,
* we don't store persistent things, especially no configuration, there,
* ...

But you of course missed the more important point.

Well, you're just not willing to get the point, instead quoting just subsentences and asking for details regarding less important things.  Which part of *"accidentally"*, *"unintentionally"* or *"not set by the user itself"* did you *not* understand?

The bare fact that `IPYTHONDIR` is (already) set means nothing, and especially not that it was set for the (same) version of IPython Sage ships and uses.

(And you didn't answer either why in your opinion in contrast `SAGE_PORT=yes` is necessary, `CC` needs to get overridden, why you force some compiler flags regardless of the context, or why `MAKE="$MAKE -j1"` should be necessary just because you personally once did get a failure without it.

I just don't understand how environment variables can be set *accidentally*.

Well, we only override `CC` if the GCC package was installed. That makes sense because it means that the system `CC` was not good enough.
