Almost all of them seem to be trivial from the change in iteration order (`an_element()` uses the first few iterated elements). However, the one to be careful about is

```

```

Most likely the elements chosen are just a bit too complicated for the doctest.

This works, although I am wondering a bit if we should use the information from the category and just update the doctests and update the Heisenberg group test (I can take care of this). It seems like it should be a faster code path, although I am not sure exactly how to test this...
