# Issue 33818: Remove "ssl" target from Makefile

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/34055

`make ssl` is broken because it tries to install `pyopenssl`, an old-style package. A comment says that "This is necessary for running the secure notebook," but I believe that this was intended for use with SageNB rather than Jupyter. So let's remove this broken and outdated target.
