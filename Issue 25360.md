CC:  mantepse rws

As reported on [this ask question](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/42626/translating-gamma-from-fricas-to-sage-causes-exception/), onevariate `gamma` is correcly interfaced with Sage:


```
sage: fricas.Gamma(3/2)
      3
Gamma(-)
      2
sage: fricas.Gamma(3/2).sage()
1/2*sqrt(pi)
```


but not bivariate `gamma`:


```
sage: fricas.Gamma(3/2,2)
      3
Gamma(-,2)
      2
sage: fricas.Gamma(3/2,2).sage()
NotImplementedError: The translation of the FriCAS Expression Gamma(3/2,2) to sage is not yet implemented.
sage: gamma(3/2,2)
gamma(3/2, 2)
```

hi, FYI, these are additional integrals which also generate NotImplementedError error. I did not know if you need to include these in this bug or open a new bug for them. Here are the commands to use to produce the errors



```
var('x')
fricas.setSimplifyDenomsFlag(fricas.true)
integrate(sqrt(x + sqrt(x + 1))/((x^2 + 1)*sqrt(x + 1)),x, algorithm="fricas")
```



NotImplementedError: The translation of the FriCAS Expression 



```
var('x')
fricas.setSimplifyDenomsFlag(fricas.true)
integrate(sqrt(x + sqrt(x + 1))/(x^2 + 1),x, algorithm="fricas")
```


NotImplementedError: The translation of the FriCAS Expression 

I can find more if needed. Both of these integrals work OK using Fricas directly.
Thanks you,

This depends on what `RootOf` means. Does Sage's `complex_root_of` suffice?

I am no expert on Fricas nor on Sage. But a quick check shows these are not the same.
in sage: 



```
c = complex_root_of(x^6 + x + 1, 1); c
       complex_root_of(x^6 + x + 1, 1)

c.n()
-0.790667188814418 + 0.300506920309552*I
```


But in Fricas, there is no definition for rootOf which takes a polynomial and an integer

There is one unexposed function called rootOf :

```
   [1] (SparseUnivariatePolynomial(D1),Symbol) -> D1
            from AlgebraicFunction(D4,D1)
            if D1 has FS(D4) and D4 has Join(COMPAR,INTDOM)
```


So using 



```
rootOf(x^2 + x + 1, 1) 
```

 

similar to sage's complex_root_of gives error



```
(3) -> rootOf(x^2 + x + 1, 1)
 
   Cannot find a definition or applicable library operation named 
      rootOf with argument type(s) 
                             Polynomial(Integer)
                               PositiveInteger

```


But this works in fricas  



```
rootOf(x^3 + x + 1, x)
```



So I think it is best to ask the experts in FriCAS group to find what is the best way to translate Fricas rootOf to sage syntax. https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/fricas-devel
as I am not qualified to answer.

The 2 argument Gamma function is the incomplete Gamma function http://functions.wolfram.com/GammaBetaErf/Gamma2/  

From http://fricas.github.io/api/FunctionalSpecialFunction.html 



```
Gamma: (F, F) -> F
Gamma(a, x) returns the incomplete Gamma function applied to a and x
Gamma: F -> F
Gamma(f) returns the formal Gamma function applied to f

```


So I think it will be safe to translate Fricas Gamma(a,x) to sage's gamma_inc(a,x)



```
Type:           Function_gamma_inc
String form:    gamma
File:           /home/sc_serv/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/functions/gamma.py
Docstring:     
      The upper incomplete gamma function.

      It is defined by the integral

         Gamma(a,z)=int_z^infty t^{a-1}e^{-t},dt

```
