# Issue 33000: membership testing for ideals of quotient rings

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33237

Original creator: lorenz

Original creation time: 2022-01-28 07:56:21

Currently, the following code fails with a `NotImplementedError`:

```
sage: 1 in Zmod(15).ideal([3,5])
```


This patch implements ideal membership testing for quotient-ring ideals.

You might be better/faster to `extend()` the list rather than using concatenation. Otherwise LGTM.
