Sage does not contain cryptography based on Quasigroups. It is based on string transformations with Quasigroups.This offers multi-level encryption.Please refer Danilo Gligorosoki's "Multivariate Quadratic Quasigroups based Cryptography,American Conference on Applied Mathematics,Harvard University,2009."
