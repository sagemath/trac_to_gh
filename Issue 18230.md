Keywords: polynomial degree quo_rem

In Sage 6.7, the following is correct:

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: z = R.zero()
sage: z.degree()
-1
sage: q, r = z.quo_rem(x)
sage: q.degree()
-1
```
The following (`QQ` -> `RR`) is not:

```
sage: S.<x> = RR[]
sage: z = S.zero()
sage: z.degree()
-1
sage: q, r = z.quo_rem(x)
sage: q.degree()
-2
```
The last result should be `-1`; the given answer implies for example

```
sage: q == z
False
```
which is nonsense since `q` and `z` are both the zero polynomial.

Looks fine to me! A minor comment: It seems that people prefer not referring to ``self`` in the documentation, so you could replace the documentation of this function by

```python
Return the quotient with remainder of this polynomial by ``other``.
```

If you really insist I can change it, but I personally prefer `self` over `this polynomial` (see comment:5:ticket:13442).

There was some recent discussion on a related question, namely whether `self` should be documented in `INPUT` sections of methods.  On that question I agree with most people that it should not.

Actually, I was referring to (the beginning of) [this discussion](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/sage-devel/self/sage-devel/58RUzV32vI0/rf4Mldr60JkJ). Yet there does not seem to be a consensus. And I do not have a strong opinion on this... so I do not insist!
