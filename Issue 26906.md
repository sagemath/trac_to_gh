# Issue 26906: Add option to `as_permutation_group` to initialize the seed for pseudo random results via libgap

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27143

Original creator: soehms

Original creation time: 2019-01-27 12:01:11

CC:  embray tscrim

Keywords: as_permutation_group, seed

This is a follow up ticket to #26903. The aim is to realize the suggestion given there in comment 9.

Furthermore, as an example the missing doctest of that ticket should be added!

I use the new option to modify existing doctests and add a note citing the GAP documentation. Furthermore, I add the doctest concerning #26903.

I would just pass `seed` to `libgap.set_seed` or explicitly cast it to an `int` or `Integer` (whichever is more appropriate and let the error fall out from that. IMO, the traceback would provide sufficient information and this would allow things that to convert to `ZZ` to work (well, at least in the latter case).

The reason, why I didn't just pass it, is:


```
gap> Reset(GlobalRandomSource, "something");
[ 45, [ 66318732, 86395905, 22233618, 21989103, 237245480, 264566285, 240037038, 264902875, 9274660, 180361945, 94688010, 24032135, 106293216, 27264613, 126456102, 243761907, 80312412, 2522186,

gap> State(GlobalRandomSource);
"so"
gap>
```


I have no idea, what this should mean (this use of the argument is not described in the GAP-documentation).

But I agree to your suggestion to cast the argument!
