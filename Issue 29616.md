This is called in the very low level `get_unsafe`, and there is no reason to go through the (Python) parent to get what is something ultimately done by the backend.

With the branch:

```
sage: K.<a> = GF(2^4)
sage: A = random_matrix(K,100,100)
sage: %timeit [A[i,j] for i in range(100) for j in range(100)]
3.82 ms ± 24.1 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)
sage: K.<a> = GF(2^13)
sage: A = random_matrix(K,100,100)
sage: %timeit [A[i,j] for i in range(100) for j in range(100)]
4.94 ms ± 26.2 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)
```

before:

```
5.35 ms ± 10.2 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)  # 2^4
6.59 ms ± 27 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)  # 2^13

Thus we are seeing a speedup of ~25% via `__getitem__`. Isolating it to a direct `get_unsafe` call:

Without the extra overhead, we see a speedup of ~35%.

```

This should fix the doctest failres. I also found some places that I could make some additional optimizations.

With the updated branch, I get additional major speed improvements:

```
673 µs ± 2.87 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000 loops each)  # 2^4
1.33 ms ± 8.11 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000 loops each)  # 2^13
```

So it is roughly a 3x speedup versus the previous commit.

Running with NTL:

```
4.42 ms ± 11.9 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)  # 2^4
4.94 ms ± 34.5 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)  # 2^13
```

versus vanilla with NTL:

```
8.28 ms ± 49.2 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)  # 2^4
9.03 ms ± 103 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)  # 2^13
```
