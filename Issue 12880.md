Having a Cholesky decomposition is equivalent to being positive definite.  With #13035 this is a cheap feature and a cheap computation, and will maintain feature sets with the exact case.

And I am having the same problem as the patchbot applying it - something is wrong with dependencies?

No, there really is a conflict with William's referee patch at #13035. Shouldn't be too hard to fix up.

*Without* the referee patch from #13035 (which does not affect functionality), I get some numerical noise on 64-bit Ubuntu 10.04:

```
sage -t  devel/sage/sage/matrix/matrix_double_dense.pyx

File "/home/drake/s/sage-5.1.beta0/devel/sage-main/sage/matrix/matrix_double_dense.pyx", line 3537:

Expected:
    [1.0, 4.0, 460.0, 27936.0, 82944.0]
Got:
    [1.0, 4.0, 460.0, 27936.0, 82943.9999998]

That's from an integer matrix, so putting a `round()` in there will not harm anything.

Thanks, Dan and Andrey.  v2 patch is standalone patch.

* Rebased with missed reviewer patch from other ticket.
* Double "square" is gone.
* `round()` on all integer determinants and output reformatted

Thanks for all your work on the Cholesky stack!
