# Issue 14493: System-wide GCC picks Sage's libraries on Cygwin

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14697

Keywords: cygwin gcc path

On Cygwin, libraries are stored in "bin" together with executables.
As we add Sage's bin directory to PATH (to be able to use the executables we generated!), the system-wide GCC may pick up some Sage's libraries (e.g. gmp, mpfr or mpc) rather than the system-wide ones it is supposed to if versions are identical.
Unfortunately, this may raise incompatibilities: I experienced a bunch of segfaults when building different spkgs.
