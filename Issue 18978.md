Wait until #13744 is fixed. Wrap `is_prime()` on graphs to `is_series_parallel()` on posets. Maybe also wrap `modular_decomposition()` as `is_series_parallel(certificate=True)`.

Do we agree that being series-parallel is not at all equivalent to being prime in the sense of modular decomposition?

Arghs, `is_prime()` was not what I think. So maybe there is no direct function to wrap. But anyway, if `modular_decomposition()` ends "withot any Prime", then the corresponding poset is N-free.

Thanks for correcting.

Now we have both pieces for decomposition. Next, what should be the return type be? `modular_decomposition()` of a graph returns a tuple of tuples of tuples etc. But is there some tree class ready for this?

"Horizontal decomposition", i.e. `connected_components()` is commutative, but "vertical decomposition" of course is not. But I guess we don't have a tree for this specific situation. Maybe Frédéric can comment on this.

I made at least the boolean (and maybe slow) version of this function. Anyways, better than nothing; a reviewer can check the documentation etc.
