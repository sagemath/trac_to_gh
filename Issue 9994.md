## Hardware and software
 * IBM [RS/6000 7025 F50](http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/pseries/v5r3/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.pseries.doc/hardware_docs/rs6000_7025f50series.htm)
 * 4 x 332 MHz 32-bit PowerPC CPUs
 * 3 GB RAM
 * A fairly wide mixture of disks sizes (3 x 9 GB, 1 x 18 GB, 2 x 36 GB and 1 x 73 GB)
 * DDS-4 tape drive 
 * AIX 5.3 (A POSIX certified operating system)
 * gcc 4.2.4 downloaded from [pware](http://pware.hvcc.edu/)
 * sage-4.6.alpha1 (which has python-2.6.4.p9)

## The problem

Python believe the compiler is broken, but it looks to me as if it is searching for an IBM compiler, not gcc. This is based on the contents of config.log, which are attached.

I'll test this with the latest Python and see if it works any better.

config.log generated by Python. It looks like its using the wrong compiler.

Attachment

This is quite easy to fix - Python just needs to configure option `--with-gcc="$CC"` added. See attached patch.

I'll attach the patch later!!

I don't believe anyone's been maintaining support for AIX or HP-UX for some time.  Putting in sage-wishlist for now in case there is still a desire for it out there, otherwise these tickets should be closed (most of them are probably no longer relevant in any case but I have no obvious way to check this).

Changing status from new to needs_review.

We should close this ticket as outdated.
