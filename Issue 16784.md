1. Move the code of `_construct_word` into `__call__` method.

2. Create `finite_word_list` methods which are shortcuts for `__call__` when we know the datatype.

Here are some benchmarks:

list:


```
sage: W = Words()
sage: L = range(1000)
sage: %timeit W(L)
10000 loops, best of 3: 45.5 µs per loop
sage: %timeit W.finite_word_list(L)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.29 µs per loop
```


str:


```
sage: W = Words()
sage: s = 'a'*1000
sage: %timeit W(s)
10000 loops, best of 3: 45.2 µs per loop
sage: %timeit W.finite_word_str(s)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.27 µs per loop
```


tuple:


```
sage: t = tuple(L)
sage: %timeit W(t)
10000 loops, best of 3: 46 µs per loop
sage: %timeit W.finite_word_tuple(t)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.39 µs per loop
```


char (why creation is so longer than str, tuple or list?):


```
sage: W = Words([0,1,2])
sage: L = [0,1,1,2]*1000
sage: type(W(L))
<class 'sage.combinat.words.word.FiniteWord_char'>
sage: %timeit W(L)
1000 loops, best of 3: 336 µs per loop
sage: %timeit W.finite_word_char(L)
1000 loops, best of 3: 246 µs per loop
```


BEFORE:


```
sage: W = Words(range(5))
sage: %time L = list(W.iterate_by_length(7))
CPU times: user 4.6 s, sys: 54.7 ms, total: 4.66 s
Wall time: 4.68 s
```


AFTER:


```
sage: W = Words(range(5))
sage: %time L = list(W.iterate_by_length(7))
CPU times: user 940 ms, sys: 80.4 ms, total: 1.02 s
Wall time: 1.02 s
```

Hello,

1) what is the point of

```
+        word_classes = self._element_classes
+        cls_str = 'FiniteWord_list'
+        return word_classes[cls_str](parent=self, data=data)
```

instead of

```
+        return self._element_classes['FiniteWord_list'](parent, data)
```


2) Calling directly `.finite_word_tuple()` or `.finite_word_list()` from the methods in `FiniteWord` is bad. Doing that you impose the return type to be `FiniteWord_list` or `FiniteWord_tuple` (you might prefer a `FiniteWord_char` sometimes). Instead of using directly those, I would rather introduce a `check` argument in `__call__` and do not use them in methods of `FiniteWord`.

Okay, I see and agree.

But still `__call__` is much slower because it guesses the datatype. I will check with a check argument whether it is better...

Not if `datatype` is properly set in input, no? You can assume that with a `check=False`, if the datatype is provided then there is no need to check that the data fits.

What do you think if we do the following (automatically use char instead of list)?


```diff

I already proposed that and you answered: "and what if I really want a `Word_list`?" If you want to go that way, we can even remove all the classes and always return `Word_char` whatever the input is. It is definitely the simplest but of course only concerns alphabet included in [0,255[.

Hello,

Much cleaner than before! Great!

Are you sure this is worth it

```
sage: W = Words([0,1,2])
sage: l = [0,1,0]*100
sage: timeit("w = W(l, datatype='list', check=False)", number=2000)
2000 loops, best of 3: 2.17 µs per loop
sage: timeit("w = W._word_from_list(l)", number=2000)
2000 loops, best of 3: 1.55 µs per loop
sage: cls = W._element_classes['FiniteWord_list']
sage: timeit("w = cls(W,l)", number=2000)
2000 loops, best of 3: 717 ns per loop
```

Having 20% gain with a method that is twice slower than calling the class constructor looks useless. If you want speed, use the classes themselves.

The name `_word_from_list_or_char` is more than confusing. For me `from` is about the input not the output. I have nothing against a method `_word_from_list` which return whatever it wants, but I would expect it to raise an Error if the input is not a list.

Sometimes you use `MyWordClass(parent=self, data=data)` and sometimes `MyWordClass(parent, data)`. Is there a reason why?

Hi Sebastien,

I added a commit which removes some trailing whitespaces and allow to use `Word_char` when the input data is a tuple.

If you are happy with it, set to positive review.
