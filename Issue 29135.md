# Issue 29135: optional packages should not be enabled automagically

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29372

When running the configure script, `--enable-foo` and `--disable-foo` should be used to control the installation of optional packages. With respect to the system-package support, this means that `./configure` should not try to find any optional packages that I don't want, and it shouldn't tell me to install them. For example,


```
$ ./configure
...
Checking whether SageMath should install SPKG gp2c...
checking installing pari? ... no
checking for gp2c... no
configure: using pari/gp from the system, but building gp2c
configure: one might prefer to install a system-wide gp2c, instead
configure: and re-run configure.
configure: gp prefix is /usr 
configure: pari.cfg is /usr/share/pari/pari.cfg 
configure: no suitable system package found for SPKG gp2c
using Sage's gp2c SPKG
...
gp2c-0.0.10.p0:                              no suitable system package; optional, use "./configure --enable-gp2c" to install
...
configure: Hint: The following SPKGs did not find equivalent system packages:
configure:   cbc gp2c libsemigroups
checking for the package system in use... gentoo
configure: Hint: Installing the following system packages is recommended and may avoid building some of the above SPKGs from source:
configure:   $ # install the following packages: sci-mathematics/gp2c
```


I guess this is partly due to the default of `if_installed` for `--enable-foo` (which I think is a bad default, but that's another matter), but the same thing happens if I explicitly pass `--disable-gp2c`.

To clarify, they are not "enabled". But the hints certainly make no distinction between enabled and non-enabled packages.

This ticket overlaps with #29363 - "At the end of configure, indicate which optional/experimental packages are configured to be installed". Help on this is very welcome!

Yes, the fact that an existing installation in SAGE_LOCAL influences configure's defaults is, of course, a quirk of Sage.
We should not change this because it has a long tradition; but it would be good to have an additional configure option to disable it and obtain more standard configure behavior.

I think it's reasonable to use an existing spkg if one exists, and I guess that's why `if_installed` was chosen as the default. But someone doing `sage -i foo` and someone just happening to have `foo` installed on the system express two very different intentions. This will become more apparent as we support more and more optional packages via spkg-configure, and they're all enabled by default.

No, `if_installed` means "if installed as an SPKG in SAGE_LOCAL."

"Enabling" an optional package really just means to make sure it is installed as an spkg if the system does not provide it already.

Oh, OK. That's less crazy to me, then. But in that case, `./configure` definitely should not be looking for those system packages and telling me to install them (since I've told it to use those packages only if they're installed as SPKGs).

Yes, I agree that the hint should not be issued for disabled optional packages. Would you like to work on this improvement?

Testing for the system packages, on the other hand, is a bit trickier because they might be dependencies of an enabled optional package.
