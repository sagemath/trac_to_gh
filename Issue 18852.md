Building freetype fails with:

```

It appears `HB_SET_VALUE_INVALID` is defined in the `harfbuzz` library and the version shipped with scientific linux 7.1 (0.9.20) doesn't have it (0.9.38 in gentoo does).

Setting `--with-harfbuzz=no` in `spkg-install` is somehow insufficient.

The option does work I had a stray `"` in `spkg-install` branch to follow in a bit.

Ready for review. Note that freetype checks to see if `harfbuzz` is higher than `0.9.19` but it is obviously too low.

Didn't mean to pull #18437, I will have to redo the branch. Reported upstream:

I can't test that it fixes the problem, but at least the fix makes sense.

It is probably a rare condition as you need to have the development packages for harfbuzz in the first place. And you need to have just the "right" version from 0.9.19 to 0.9.21.
