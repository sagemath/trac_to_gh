# Issue 17077: Poset: interval vs. closed_interval

Issue created by migration from Trac.

There is no need to define both `interval()` and `closed_interval()` defined on finite posets. Only one is needed and other might be an alias for it.

This changes how `closed_interval` plays with inheritance, and I'd consider this a "regression" (I'm using that term very loosely here). See https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/8bs7SlY4fNs.

Is there a class in which `closed_interval` is overshadowed differently than `interval`? If so, I second Travis's comment.

AFAIK, there's no such class in Sage, but I think my (possibly somewhat contrived) example in sage-devel of private code is a possibility. Also it's net gain of some 16 lines and a function call, so IMO there's no gain from this change. If you're at the point where you need to optimize out a function call, you're reading the source code and would just make the swap `closed_interval` -> `interval`.

I was not thinking about speed. It just seems a little confusing for me to have documentation with two functions, both with examples and so, that actually does same thing. Alias would correct that.

But if it would make other problems, then this should not be done. In that case I suggest having docstring of other to be only "Alias for <link>xxx()</link>".

Ok, let us forget about that, then.
