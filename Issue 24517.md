Okay. It bothers me a bit that `eval_on_operands` is being moved and becoming a private function. I agree with the change; it just speaks to Sage's lack of a consistent "public API".  In this case it always should have been a private function.

Slight nitpick that you can fix only if you feel like:


```
+                            [Expression], eval_methods, prepend_cls_bases=False)
```


while using a list for the bases certainly works, it's just kind of unidomatic, as opposed to using a tuple (since internally it's stored as a tuple).  But for the purposes of the constructor it doesn't really matter...
