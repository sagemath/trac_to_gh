File "src/sage/rings/real_mpfr.pyx", line 713, in sage.rings.real_mpfr.RealField_class._coerce_map_from_
Failed example:
    RR['x'].get_action(ZZ)
Expected:
    Right scalar multiplication by Integer Ring on Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Real Field with 53 bits of precision
Got:
    <repr(<sage.structure.coerce_actions.RightModuleAction at 0x153843e50>) failed: RuntimeError: This action acted on a set that became garbage collected>
**********************************************************************
