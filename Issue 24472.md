Failed example:
    RR['x'].get_action(ZZ)
Expected:
    Right scalar multiplication by Integer Ring on Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Real Field with 53 bits of precision
Got:
    <repr(<sage.structure.coerce_actions.RightModuleAction at 0x153843e50>) failed: RuntimeError: This action acted on a set that became garbage collected>
**********************************************************************
