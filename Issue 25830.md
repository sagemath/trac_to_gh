Speed up `//` for multivariate polynomials over ℤ after the regression discussed at #24735#comment:7. See also #25313.

#24735:

```
sage: P.<x,y> = ZZ[]
sage: p = 3*(-x^8*y^2 - x*y^9 + 6*x^8*y + 17*x^2*y^6 - x^3*y^2)
sage: q = 7*(x^2 + x*y + y^2 + 1)
sage: %timeit p//q
The slowest run took 43.99 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000 loops, best of 3: 278 µs per loop
```

sage: p = 3*(-x^8*y^2 - x*y^9 + 6*x^8*y + 17*x^2*y^6 - x^3*y^2)
sage: q = 7*(x^2 + x*y + y^2 + 1)
sage: %timeit p//q
The slowest run took 44.73 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.

For fairness, do you have timings before #24735?

Also, are the functions `p_MDivide` and `pMDivide` different? Should the latter be removed?

According to upstream [0], p_Divide returns 0 when the division is not exact. I have no idea what __floordiv__ should return for polynomials with integers coefficients given that it's not an Euclidean domain, but are you sure that this is what you want?

Then all of [commit 9ffa9998](https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit/?h=197ac562304611d9f946337332349bff9fa0d05d&id=9ffa9998f5739e010b607070ab1c0e2c41880a1c) is a typo? It is saying there is a `p_MDivide` function unless I am misunderstanding something.

After this patch both versions are used in Sage, so neither should be removed",

```
sage: P.<x,y,z,t> = ZZ[]
....: f = 1 + x + y + z + t;
....: p = f^20;
....: q = p*(p + 1);
....: %time _ = q//p
