This needs to be either rebased or closed as "wontfix". Honestly, if you care about filenames, you shouldn't be using temporary files.

Why not using directly some chronological info in the filename, so that you do not have to maintain a global counting variable, for example to know how many microseconds happen since epoch, you can do (if i am not wrong):


```
sage: import datetime
sage: datetime.datetime.now().strftime('%s.%f')
'1422815002.028631'
```

Of course that could be done, but the question is: _should_ it be done?

I propose to close as wontfix. Really, don't base your workflow on assumptions about Sage's temp files. They are called temporary for a reason. Its wrong on so many levels, I don't even know where to start. Let me just mention that on some file systems you can't open files that are opened by another process.

Ok, close it. I was not doing it for me anyway, because I was not using this feature myself. I only knew two users of Sage who were using Sage a lot for experimentation involving drawing things for a temporary use and both independently told me about the fact that it stopped to work when the temp file name changed to complete random. Anyway, I did not do the follow up close enough on this ticket and did not convinced much people for it. So, I will tell them it was a Spacebar Heating feature of Sage. They will understand.

And if they don't understand they'll be better off without knowing it.
