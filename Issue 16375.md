Why not using directly some chronological info in the filename, so that you do not have to maintain a global counting variable, for example to know how many microseconds happen since epoch, you can do (if i am not wrong):


```
sage: import datetime
sage: datetime.datetime.now().strftime('%s.%f')
'1422815002.028631'
