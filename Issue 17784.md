CC:  jamespropp tscrim jessicapalencia kdilks vinceknight jcampbell

Keywords: days64, gyration, alternating sign matrix

In class :class:`AlternatingSignMatrix` (and later FullyPackedLoop): 
* add a method for returning the list of gyration orbits

For method :meth:`AlternatingSignMatrix.gyration`
* optional parameter k (default k=1) to indicate how many times to gyrate on the ASM
* add gyration method to :class:`FullyPackedLoop` ?

See Ticket #17988 (implementing FullyPackedLoop class)

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18021

Here are my comments:

- I don't like the `count` option to `gyration`. You are much better writing a simple `for` loop which applies the sequence of gyrations to avoid the unnecessary complexity.
- Rename `obtain_gyration_orbit` to `gyration_orbit`.
- Use ``@`cached_method` for `gyration_orbits` (and you should not say anything about its internal representation). Also have it return a tuple instead of a list.
- Don't cache `gyration_orbit_sizes` since the previous caching will keep this fast (and definitely do not hardcode them).

Also, do you want this to depend on #17988? If so, I should be able to do that review this week.

I did all the changes you asked except for the very last comment "Don't cache gyration_orbit_sizes".

To clarify, do you mean I should remove these lines from gyration_orbit_sizes?
        if self._gyration_orbit_sizes:
            return self._gyration_orbit_sizes

And remove the "self._gyration_orbit_sizes"?
