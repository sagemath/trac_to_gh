# Issue 22537: Deprecation warning message should guide a user to import lcm from sage.arith.all.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22774

As of Sage 8.0.beta, the location of lcm has changed from `sage.arith.misc` to `sage.arith.functions`, and the deprecation warning warns that lcm should be imported directly from `sage.arith.functions`. But the close friend gcd is still in `sage.arith.misc` and an ordinary user would expect  gcd and lcm found in the same package.

From the user point of view, everything should be 
imported as 

`from sage.arith.all import gcd, lcm` 

and the warning message should guide a user to import lcm from `sage.arith.all`.

I got the following deprecation warning

```
sage: from sage.rings.arith import gcd
sage: gcd(2,3)
...:2881: DeprecationWarning: 
Importing gcd from here is deprecated. If you need to use it,
please import it directly from sage.arith.all
See http://trac.sagemath.org/19879 for details.
  exec(code_obj, self.user_global_ns, self.user_ns)
1
sage: from sage.rings.arith import lcm
sage: lcm(2,3)
...:2881: DeprecationWarning: 
Importing lcm from here is deprecated. If you need to use it,
please import it directly from sage.arith.all
See http://trac.sagemath.org/19879 for details.
  exec(code_obj, self.user_global_ns, self.user_ns)
6
```

And `sage.arith.functions` is not mentioned.

I guess that is a different deprecation message. Try `from sage.arith.misc import lcm`. But you will still not see the warning message as this is already imported at startup. To see that, write a short script.
