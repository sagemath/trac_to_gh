CC:  @videlec

As of Sage 8.0.beta, the location of lcm has changed from `sage.arith.misc` to `sage.arith.functions`, and the deprecation warning warns that lcm should be imported directly from `sage.arith.functions`. But the close friend gcd is still in `sage.arith.misc` and an ordinary user would expect  gcd and lcm found in the same package.

From the user point of view, everything should be 
imported as 

`from sage.arith.all import gcd, lcm` 

and the warning message should guide a user to import lcm from `sage.arith.all`.

I guess that is a different deprecation message. Try `from sage.arith.misc import lcm`. But you will still not see the warning message as this is already imported at startup. To see that, write a short script.
