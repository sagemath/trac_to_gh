A `ConvexHPolyhedralSet_base` is defined by finitely many linear equations and linear inequalities, some of which may be strict.

Example: { (x,y) : x >= 0, y >= 0 } \ (0,0) = { x>=0, y>=0, x+y > 0 }


A `ConvexVPolyhedralSet_base` is generated by finitely many convex/conic generators; some generators may restrict their coefficients to be strictly positive.

Example: (0,0) u { (x,y) : x > 0, y > 0 } = { a (1,0) + b (0,1) + c (1,1), a>0, b>0, c>=0 }

Next: Make `LatticePolytope`, `ConvexRationalPolyhedralCone` subclasses of `ConvexHPolyhedralSet_base` too
