Reading the summary of this ticket made me remember a problem I was having with the attach command : Can we attach a file already in the sage tree that we are editing? I already tried, but I stopped using it because sometimes the changes in the file were not considered and I have been stopping sage and running sage -br ever since then.

Maybe I was doing something bad or maybe this ticket solves the problem or maybe it is not possible at all to do this...??

I've attached a combined "sagelib" patch.  It depends on 4.3.alpha1, SageNB 0.4.6 (#7625), #7483, and #7482.

Out of curiosity:  What if we "overload" `import` by keeping a stack of all imported modules.  When a watched file changes, we reload it and all modules loaded since the watched file was first loaded?  Would this be useful in some situations?

I noticed

```python
sage: f = 1
sage: save(f, 'f')
sage: attach('f.sobj')
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
ValueError: argument (='f.sobj') to load or attach must have extension py, sage, or pyx                             
sage: attached_files()
['f.sobj']
```


Questions about loading/attaching Cython files:

* Can they only be loaded once, if they haven't changed?  For example: If `zzz.pyx` contains `print 'Zzz!'`, I see

```python
sage: load('zzz.pyx')
Compiling zzz.pyx...
Zzz!
sage: load('zzz.pyx')
sage: load('zzz.pyx')
sage: # Now I edit zzz.pyx
sage: load('zzz.pyx')
Compiling zzz.pyx...
Awake!
```


* Can they access existing objects?  For example: If I put

```python
try:
    b += 1
except:
    b = 10
print b
```


    in a .pyx file, loading the file always sets `b` to 10, even if it's already defined.

Disclaimer:  I'm still quite ignorant about Cython.

The attached patch (sagenb-7514-rebase-part3.patch) should:

1. Fixed this: "When I load/attach a .(s)pyx file in the notebook, _code.py appears in the cell's output HTML."

2. Fixed this: "Typing f??<TAB> for a function f defined in the notebook shows its docstring but not its source code."  Actually, this wasn't exactly broken... the last line of the docstring was missing.  I've added a newline to the end of the input file, and now the problem is gone.
