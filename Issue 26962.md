[this was reported to me by Emmanuel Thom√©]

The following never returns with Sage 8.5:

```
sage: n=16262093986406371
sage: f=ECM()
sage: f.factor(n,B1=10)
```

Note that n factors as `1009^2 * 1733 * 3023 * 3049`, with a square.

The top-level ECM.factor seems correct, and deals with exact powers.

But for some reason, the B1=10 argument is not passed to find_factors, which uses B1=2000. This is too large, and with all seeds sigma, all factors are found simultaneously, and the loop which calls find_factors loops indefinitely.

It is important to remove all small factors before calling ECM (and not only consider the size of the input).

As a rule of thumb, when using ECM with say B1=2000, all factors below B1 should have been removed.

There seem to be places where B1 is actually overridden in the glue code.

The intended semantics of e.g. `ECM(1000).factor(n, 2000)` are not very clear to me.

    479         except ValueError:
    480             # output does not end in factorization

```

In this case, all prime factors are hit by the ECM curve, thus the input number is found.
The code should be modified so that if `factors` contains only one element, it should return `[ZZ(1), n]` like in the `ValueError` case.
