After building Sage, in the first run, Sage spends some time building the "lazy import cache".

This whole mechanism (from #8456, modified in #11924, #12670) is currently only used for a total of 3 re-imports with deprecation. They could be easily be rewritten by just listing all symbols instead of using "*"; but it turns out that the deprecations have all expired already (#19150, #26370, #27337), so we can remove them.


```
$ git grep '^lazy_import.*[*]'
src/sage/combinat/lyndon_word.py:lazy_import('sage.combinat.words.lyndon_word', '*', deprecation=19150)
src/sage/rings/invariant_theory.py:lazy_import('sage.rings.invariants.invariant_theory', '*', deprecation=26370)
src/sage/tests/all.py:lazy_import('sage.tests.arxiv_0812_2725', '*', deprecation=27337)
```
