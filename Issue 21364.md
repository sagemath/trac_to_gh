Done this. The code is just a direct dual. To test try


```
n = 30; seed = 42; p = 0.999
set_random_seed(seed)
L = Posets.RandomLattice(n, p)
L_ = L.dual()
for e in L:
    if L.canonical_joinands(e) is None and L_.canonical_meetands(e) is None:
        continue
    if sorted(L.canonical_joinands(e)) != sorted(L_.canonical_meetands(e)):
        print("ERROR")
        break
else:
    print("OK")
```
