If the return value is of type `int`, it is inconvenient to subsequently apply usual methods attached with `Integer` like `factor()`. So it is preferable to return `Integer`.

We add a section to the developer manual recommending this convention.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32200

I think something should be explicitly mentioned about `__hash__` being a definite exception.

More in the bikeshedding category: I think this would be better placed before the `IMPORTING` section as it is more minor than hashing and coercion.

`__len__` and `__int__` are other examples, I think. Should we try to be exhaustive here?

I think so if they are implemented common enough in Sage. If there are too many exceptions, then perhaps the rule should not be a rule.
