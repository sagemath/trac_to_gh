The error message `Impossible inverse modulo` is a little strange to me, and moreover from the ticket description, it does not seem correct. Could we instead change it to

```
raise NotImplementedError("unable to compute the inverse modulo this ideal")
```


On #28969, it would have been good to also remove that period at the end of it in order to follow Python's error message convention. Oh well, that already has a positive review...
