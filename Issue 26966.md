# Issue 26966: py3: fix 8 doctests in generators/families.py

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27203

Original creator: dcoudert

Original creation time: 2019-02-02 11:47:08

Keywords: py3, graph

We fix doctests in
- `FurerGadget`: use `key=str` to sort vertices and edges
- `CaiFurerImmermanGraph`: use `key=str` to sort vertices and edges
- `FuzzyBallGraph`: use parameter `vertices` when calling `adjacency_matrix` and `laplacian_matrix`

Remaining failing doctests are in `petersen_family` (due to the bug reported in #26800) and `MathonPseudocyclicStronglyRegularGraph` (I don't understand the example)
