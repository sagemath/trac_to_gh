This is quite a nice improvement. So it would be good to add `[DGH20]` to the master references file (as `[DGH2020]`) and then cite it as `[DGH20]_` (or with the changed name `[DGH2020]_`). Other than that, a few PEP8 space around operators:

```diff
-if k < n/2:
+if k < n / 2:

-k = n-k
+k = n - k

-while d < k-1:
+while d < k - 1:

-if n-1-m==0:
+if n - 1 - m == 0:

-B = (B * (k-1-i))//(n-1-m)
+B = (B * (k-1-i)) // (n-1-m)

-D[k-1] = n+r+k-1-B
+D[k-1] = n + r + k - 1 - B
```

and these can be simplified:

```diff
-D = [0 for i in range(k)]
+D = [0]*k

-d = d + 1
+d += 1

-i = i + 1
+i += 1

-n = n - 1
+n += 1

-r = r - B
+r -= B

-m = m + 1
+m += 1

-j = j + 1
+j += 1
```

Also would it be possible to keep the same variable names as before? While I doubt anyone is explicitly calling it with `n=foo`, it is still good in terms of being fully backwards compatible. Plus I feel it would be better to define `n0 = n` instead of the other way around.
