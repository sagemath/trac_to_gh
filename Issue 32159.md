Currently, the `abs` operator cannot be applied to scalar fields:


```
sage:             sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M', structure='topological')
....:             sage: X.<x,y> = M.chart()
....:             sage: f = M.scalar_field({X: x*y}, name='f', latex_name=r"\Phi")
....: abs(f)
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: bad operand type for abs(): 'ScalarFieldAlgebra_with_category.element_class'
```


In this ticket, we add this feature.

I don't have any strong preference. `abs` sounds more inline with other function names in Sage, while `|.|` is closer to mathematical notation, so I would slightly prefer the latter. Travis, what do you think?

Alright, I changed it to `abs` with small letters. I find it a strong argument to say that this follows general Sage convention.
