Sigh. So I have to upgrade the group cohomology package earlier than I thought. I'll see what I can do (after grading some exam).

The ticket description prominently tells that the group cohomology package is failing, but the title of the ticket is about upgrading Singular.

So, just to be sure about the topic of this ticket:
- Is this ticket about upgrading Singular, which means that a new ticket for upgrading the group cohomology package needs to be created? If this is so, which of the tickets should depend on the other?
- Is this ticket only about upgrading the group cohomology package? Looking at the commits, I suppose that this is not the case.

It is `backport_std.patch`

I see. I thought that the "p something" patch level is Sage's addition of patches, not Singular's.

It seems Singular 4-1-2 is out, see the GitHub "releases" page and
one official sources directory at uni-kl:

So far no mention on the Singular home page or download page:

Relevant changes: system("stest") and system("freegb") are no longer a thing. There is a stest function now, but it's marked static so not accessible from outside the library.

Any replacement for freegb?

Indeed, `std`/`twostd` can be used for this, but one needs to work over a polynomial ring constructed via [`freeAlgebra`](https://www.singular.uni-kl.de/Manual/4-1-2/sing_794.htm), so that certain attributes like the degree bound are set for the computation.

However, I do not see how to make the `degrees` option work, as Singular's `freeAlgebra` function does not allow for block orders:


```
sage: F.<a,b,c> = FreeAlgebra(QQ, implementation='letterplace', degrees=(1,2,3))
sage: F.commutative_ring().term_order()
Block term order with blocks:
(Degree reverse lexicographic term order of length 3,
 Lexicographic term order of length 1)

sage: from sage.libs.singular.function_factory import ff
sage: A = ff.freegb__lib.freeAlgebra(F.commutative_ring(), 5)
...
RuntimeError: error in Singular function call 'freeAlgebra':
only for rings with a global ordering of one block
```


This is with Singular 4.1.2p1 (`freeAlgebra` does not exist in the Singular version that is currently in Sage).

The other failing doctests seem mostly harmless.

Regarding the `degrees` option of letterplace algebras, Singular should support weighted degree orders naturally now, so Sage's workaround using slack variables should not be necessary anymore. However, I have difficulties to reproduce the old results with Singular's new implementation. The example from `letterplace.pyx`:


```
sage: F.<x,y,z> = FreeAlgebra(QQ, implementation='letterplace', degrees=[1,2,3])
sage: I = F * [x*y+z-y*x, x*y*z-x^6+y^3] * F
sage: I.groebner_basis(Infinity)
...
sage: F.degbound()
22
```


The maximum degree was 22, so the following Singular code should compute the same, as far as I understand, but it fails with an error:


```
LIB "freegb.lib";
ring r = 0,(x,y,z),wp(1,2,3);
def R = freeAlgebra(r, 22);
setring R;
ideal I = x*y+z-y*x, x*y*z-x^6+y^3;
ideal J = twostd(I);
//   ? degree bound of Letterplace ring is 22, but at least 23 is needed for this multiplication
```


Is this a bug in Singular? I think Singular should make sure not to go beyond the degree bound in this computation.

Viktor Levandovskyy has sent a response to the problem, which was very helpful. The ordering I was trying to use is not actually supported. Also, some of the orderings Sage was using in the letterplace computations were not actually supported and, apparently, were silently ignored by Singular. As a consequence, results obtained with the new Letterplace API (which now supports some of the orders) may be a bit different than before. In the case of non-standard `degrees`, a `deglex` ordering seems to give similar results as before.

Here is a tentative branch that makes Sage's letterplace functionality work with Singular 4.1.2p1. I followed Antonio's suggestion from comment:35 and his [downstream patch](https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/tree/sagemath-singular-4.1.2.patch?h=sagemath-git) about implementing a variable shifting method, and implemented a workaround to call Singular's `twostd` with a letterplace polynomial ring constructed via `freeAlgebra`. Of course, this should only be seen as a short-term solution, to maintain backward compatibility where possible.

There is one remaining problem for upgrading to Singular 4.1.2p1. The tests in `src/sage/rings/polynomial/plural.pyx` sometimes produce the segmentation fault reported in comment:22, which I do not know how to resolve. For me, the segfault usually occurs during `make ptestlong`, but not always when testing the file standalone.

Any help with this is appreciated.

the stupid thing tries to load a plugin from a previous install rather than the one it just compiled.

Tests pass on a machine with singular removed but it is annoying.

I have updated the branch to fix the doctests for Singular 4.1.2p4. The changes are mostly harmless:

- sign changes in the representatives of fraction field elements

- minors now include zero elements (which agrees with the [Singular documentation](https://www.singular.uni-kl.de/Manual/4-1-2/sing_298.htm))

- rational points are returned in a different order

- intersection of ideals does not return a Gröbner basis anymore: Neither Sage nor [Singular](https://www.singular.uni-kl.de/Manual/4-1-2/sing_271.htm) clearly state that the result should be a Gröbner basis, so this change seems fine, but it might be worth checking whether this change was intentional.

The only remaining failing doctests are in `asymptotics_multivariate_generating_functions.py`. It would be nice if the authors or anyone familiar with asymptotics could take a look.

Some of these are caused by different representatives being chosen modulo an ideal, which should be fine. However, the relative error does not get small anymore which suggests that there might be a bug on the Sage side.

Probably not. There are still failing doctests related to asymptotics. Someone should look into that.

But even then, it might be better to merge this in the next release cycle in order to give it some time to get tested.

Now this makes all the doctests pass with Singular 4.1.2p4, so this is ready for testing. The optional packages in particular still need to be tested.

I can't reproduce that.

I checked out the ticket on top of 9.1.rc0 and run `make` according to the ticket description but all tests of `src/sage/rings/polynomial/plural.pyx` passed.

Thanks for taking a look. There is some randomness to this bug. With the current branch, it consistently occurs for me, but has been appearing only from time to time while working on this ticket. If I copy the offending doctest to the top of the file to better isolate the problem, it disappears. I am not even sure if it is really caused by this upgrade – the underlying problem might already exist in Sage without being noticed.

Yes, I get that as well. Apparently upstream forgot to change that version number.

That's not good looking!

I tried to reproduce it on another machine (running under Linux Mint 19.1 and Sage with Python 2) but without success, again.

> If I copy the offending doctest to the top of the file to better isolate the problem, it disappears.

Does it disappear if you let it in on its position but supress some of the previous doctests, as well?

In my experience such segmentation faults are mostly caused by a previous call of some C-function with no prototype and a wrong number of arguments or some usage of a non initialized variable.
Anyway, I think this bug will be very difficult to find!

There was #13447 dedicated to having proper refcount for libsingular rings. If I recall correctly, the problem is that refcounting in Singular ONLY happens for rings in the interface, i.e. there is no refcount when polynomials are created.  However, there is an internal ref counter in Singular that sometimes in very few places in the Singular code is used.

Anyway, perhaps it makes sense to revive that other ticket and finally try and get the refcount problem done.

This is some side-effect in the Singular pexpect interface that appears since #29543 and seems to be harmless. I have updated the doctest.

I have also removed the `shift`/`_cycle` method, as it can be replaced by the action of permutations on polynomials.

We now seem to have a candidate version that compiles also on `cygwin-standard` - Hans Schönemann made major changes to the build system and I contributed a few PRs, which are merged already. 

(See https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/actions/runs/630821695 for a `cygwin-standard` run; this is on top of several tickets that fix unrelated Cygwin build errors).  `cygwin-stage-iv` built `sagelib`; and `cygwin-stage-v-a` is running `make ptest`.

I have asked upstream whether they plan to make a new release with these fixes soon.

In the meantime, I hope someone can take a look at whether this version is suitable on our other platforms. The relevant test run is https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/actions/runs/630821698, which shows a number of doctest failures, for example on `ubuntu-bionic` (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/2053003522?check_suite_focus=true):

I think this one may be coming from `make dist` not building a complete package - this would be fixed by an official source release by the Singular people, or we would have to fix up the tarball by hand somehow.

Regular release of singular includes a tarball with documentation files and that includes this particular one. I am just surprised you don't get any complaints at install time that it is missing. May be the install procedure can deal with the fact that the tarball is missing for out of release testing. 

I must say I have a separate issue with that tarball that I have been meaning to send upstream - when you install as root the ownership are all wrong. This is due of a behavior of tar which by default disregard original ownership when used by normal user but preserve it when invoked as root.

The answer is kind of outrageous. There is no guarantee that will be the case now or in the future. The fix is also simple, I can submit a PR for that.

I'll have to make do with that. It also looks like I missed the 4.2.0_p1 release.
