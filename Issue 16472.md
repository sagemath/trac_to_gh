A Good Old ILP for a NP-Hard problem. Reminds me of the early days of Graphs in Sage `:-P`

LGTM.

By the way, I noticed weirdness in `designs.steiner_quadruple_system` -- these guys aren't `Incidence system`, they are just dumps of tuples...

PS. one ought to have .covering() too, not only .packing().

Well, write a ticket if you care (I will review it), otherwise I'll do it someday. I was against it some time ago, but that was before Vincent's patch to renovate the incidence structure code. It used to be buggy and unmaintained, but now it is on a better road. Let's use it.

Same here, write a patch if you care (like for packing it only takes 10 lines of LP) otherwise it will be done someday. Though I hit packing problems much more often than covering ones, so it may not be tomorrow `:-P`
