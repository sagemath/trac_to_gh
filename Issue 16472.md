Well, write a ticket if you care (I will review it), otherwise I'll do it someday. I was against it some time ago, but that was before Vincent's patch to renovate the incidence structure code. It used to be buggy and unmaintained, but now it is on a better road. Let's use it.

Same here, write a patch if you care (like for packing it only takes 10 lines of LP) otherwise it will be done someday. Though I hit packing problems much more often than covering ones, so it may not be tomorrow `:-P`
