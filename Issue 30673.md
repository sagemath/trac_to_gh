It should only run on tags, like the other workflows

Currently it dies if a system package does not exist - even for optional packages - https://github.com/sagemath/sage/runs/1368397973?check_suite_focus=true

I don't think `texlive-plain-generic` is the right package. We use latex, not plain tex

I'm also not sure, but looking at https://packages.ubuntu.com/bionic/texlive-generic-extra it looks like `texlive-generic-extra` is a (deprecated) wrapper around `texlive-plain-generic`.

(The dependency might actually be there not for the pdf/latex docs but for the html docs, which requires bibtex to generate the aux.)

I think I would go for `texlive-latex-extra` - https://packages.ubuntu.com/groovy/texlive-latex-extra
