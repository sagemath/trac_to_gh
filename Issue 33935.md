I don't understand these:

```

sage/misc/sagedoc.py:670:1: RST214 Inline literal start-string without end-string.
```

They seem to come from ```noreplace```: if I change the text "noreplace" to anything else, the error goes away. I can make the change ```noreplace`` -> ``"noreplace"``` to "fix" it, but I don't know what's going on.

noreplace seems to be our own directiev, as explained in the very same file.

Best solution should be to exclude this file from the rst validator.

Does the validator use any of Sage's code, or does it just use `flake8-rst-docstrings`? I really don't understand why `noreplace` is causing problems. (And the actual documentation looks fine.)
