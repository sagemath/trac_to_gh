Btw, do any of these need to be reported upstream?

burcin is pynac upstream, do you mean the ginac upstream from pynac?

Replying to [comment:2 kcrisman]:
> Btw, do any of these need to be reported upstream?

If upstream = GiNaC: No, these are all messes we created. :) GiNaC does not have coefficients in `GF(2)` or infinities. Our printing methods are also different.

I've uploaded an updated spkg using the tarball Burcin provided at
http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jpflori/pynac-0.2.6.spkg

I've not run the whole testsuite yet, only the symbolic directory, but there seems to be problems left with parenthesis around exponents (#13262), let's hope I messed something.

Ok, my bad, my patch queue was not completely pushed :)

What is missing for this ticket to be positively reviewed? Things works fine for me provided that I apply #13262 to fix the latex output in doctests.

I am putting this to positive review. It can go in with #13262 independently of the other 2 as far as I can see.

It is indeed missing from the summary. Jean-Pierre Flori made a spkg. Now linked in the summary.

Yes. It needs to be applied at the same time as #13262 which does fix that. Not sure why it was split. Sorry for losing your time by not updating the ticket description clearly enough.
