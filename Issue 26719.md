```
x = polygen(ZZ)
one_n = RealField(64, rnd="RNDN").one()
one_d = RealField(64, rnd="RNDD").one()
one_u = RealField(64, rnd="RNDU").one()
c = AA.polynomial_root(x^3 - x, RIF(0.99,1.01))
print one_n == one_d == one_u  # True as expected
print c <= one_n               # True as expected
print c <= one_d               # True as expected
print c <= one_u               # BUG: gives False
```
