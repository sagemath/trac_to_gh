Of many functions there are two versions with the same name---in `sage/arith` and in `sage/functions`, examples are `binomial` and `factorial`. On startup the latter versions overwrite the former because of order of import. That creates problems both with documentation, different interface, and different behavior expected. For example in #14723 the problem of `binomial(Qp(5)(8),2)` could not be resolved with the `sage/functions` version (because there the arguments have restrictions), although the `sage/arith` version would have worked perfectly. OTOH the arith version can not handle `binomial(x,y)` but the symbolic function version can.

The logical solution would be for all cases to
- make the arith version the default by removing the import in `sage/functions/all.py`; the arith version will no longer be overwritten
- dispatch calls to the arith version with symbolic arguments to the symbolic function version
- copy some symbolic documentation to arith because that docstring will be shown now 

The issues #22314, #17489 depend on this.

Why should there even be two versions of every function in the first place? Shouldn't we be able to support all use cases in one function?

I mean you implemented the symbolic function machinery, and it's fine if you step back and say, let others go ahead now. But you could at least review attempts to fix your design decisions.

This should resolve #17489 and #22314 in one go.

Doctests pass in arith and all the  symbolics and function directories but let's see.

Remaining issues like merging of documentation and deprecation of the obscure `binomial._binomial_sym`, `binomial._eval_`, `binomial._evalf_` is stuff for other tickets.

Please review.

I agree with Vincent. Keep the fast functions as they are now.

Nothing wrong with a fast arithmetic function version taking integer arguments, for special needs (and that's why they needed to be imported for some time now). Note that `arith.misc.binomial` does a lot of dispatching attempts and parent queries that do not match what you just argued.

Because the global entry functions in `functions.other` restrict the argument type, an unrestricted version is needed. Like as in `log` this can be put right next to the function class as a Python function. This would then carry a documentation overview.
