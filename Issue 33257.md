Each time a file using bit sets is compiled, we have the following: 

```
[sagelib-9.6.beta5] ./sage/data_structures/bitset_intrinsics.h:184:9: warning: expression result unused [-Wunused-value]
[sagelib-9.6.beta5]     for(i; i + (2*LIMBS_PER_64 - 1) < limbs; i +=2*LIMBS_PER_64){
[sagelib-9.6.beta5]         ^
[sagelib-9.6.beta5] ./sage/data_structures/bitset_intrinsics.h:190:9: warning: expression result unused [-Wunused-value]
[sagelib-9.6.beta5]     for(i; i < limbs; i++){
[sagelib-9.6.beta5]         ^
[sagelib-9.6.beta5] ./sage/data_structures/bitset_intrinsics.h:395:9: warning: expression result unused [-Wunused-value]
[sagelib-9.6.beta5]     for(i; i < limbs; i++){
[sagelib-9.6.beta5]         ^
```
