Keywords: sympy, maxima

In the very special case, where there are no equations and no variables to solve for, maxima and sympy don't agree on the number of solutions that exist:

```
sage: len(solve([], [], algorithm="maxima"))
1

sage: len(solve([], [], algorithm="sympy"))
0
```


Maxima is correct here; i.e., we should have

```
sage: solve([], [], algorithm="sympy")
[[]]
```

and 

```
sage: solve([], [], algorithm="sympy", solution_dict=True)
[{}]
```

How does sympy's `solveset` behave in this case? See #31935

The documentation for the [Input API of solveset](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/solvers/solveset.html#input-api-of-solveset) suggests it can handle more than one equation and more than one variable, but there are no such examples in the docstrings, and the following output from [https://live.sympy.org](https://live.sympy.org) suggests otherwise:

```
>>> solveset(x, x)
{0}

>>> solveset([x], x)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: [x] is not a valid SymPy expression

>>> solveset(x + y, [x, y])
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: [x, y] is not a valid SymPy expression
```


Upon further searching, I found a place in the documentation that explicitly states that the input must be a single equation [https://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/solvers/solveset.html#sympy.solvers.solveset.solveset](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/solvers/solveset.html#sympy.solvers.solveset.solveset)
