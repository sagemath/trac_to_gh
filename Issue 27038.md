seems ok at first sight.. Erik, do you approve ?

Comment by embray created at 2019-02-21 11:10:27

I'm not sure.  I don't think `bytes_to_str` should be used in doctests if it can be helped, but that's more of an arbitrary stylistic choice.  Let me look at whether there's a nicer way.

Comment by embray created at 2019-02-21 11:18:14

Couldn't we instead modify the `copy_text` function to call `bytes_to_str` on the return value?  AFAICT this code isn't even used anywhere in Sage, but it would probably be nicer that way regardless.

I will try that.

`@`embray I don't see drawback with your solution, let's try this.

Just one other minor nit to pick (with the existing tests before this ticket):


```diff

index e3e7671..43279a7 100644
--- a/src/sage/libs/readline.pyx

     sage: with interleaved_output():

     ....:     print('cursor position: {}'.format(get_point()))
     output

```


with the Python 3 `print()` function (which I believe we are using in most modules on Python 2 as well), there's no need for explicit string concatenation with `+`.  The prints() in this test could be written like `print('current line:', blahblahblah)`.  I think we should promote more idiomatic code (even if in relatively minor tests that most users won't look at).

But don't bother unless you feel like it.

Similarly the line `print('cursor position: {}'.format(get_point()))` could just be written simply


```
print('cursor position:', get_point())
```

Oh thanks ! That's good to know.

I will make these little modifications.

Did you test this?  When you do `print(a, b)` it automatically inserts spaces, so I think now you have an extra space.

Be careful with `print` on Python2:

```
>>> print('a','b')
('a', 'b')
```

versus Python3:

```
>>> print('a', 'b')
a b
```

So I would not use the comma version in order to be Python2/3 compatible.

I think i have. But i am not sure anymore. And i don't understand why the last patchbot is green. I am currently doing more tests.

Well that's pretty strange even if with python2 you get that in sage console:

```
sage: from sage.libs.readline import *
sage: replace_line('foobar', 0)
sage: set_point(3)
sage: print('cursor position: ', get_point())
('cursor position: ', 3)
```


The doctest 

```
sage: print('cursor position: ', get_point())
cursor position: 3
```

still pass.

And for python3 the doctest framework doesn't seem to care if there is one or two spaces between `cursor position:` and `3`.

Even if it pass i think it's more clear and consistent to rollback to the `format` syntax.

We're using `from __future__ import print_function` almost everywhere.  If there's a module that's not using it that's a mistake.

I'm not sure why it is because that's wrong.

For the doctests we are using the Python 3 print() function where possible.

Ok that explain things !
But is it a good thing to use the `print('a', 'b')` syntax right now ?
Travis comment and mines show that it's confusing if you are not aware of #23551.

Comment by embray created at 2019-02-22 13:04:33

I think for miscellaneous doctests where it's really beside the point, I think it should be fine, and better to use future-proof best practices.  It's just in tutorials and other educational documentation for beginners where one needs to be a little more careful about this (or better yet, teach the difference!)

I hope we can move toward using the print function in the REPL even on Python 2 before long...

Rebased on 8.7.beta4 and fix doctests with `print('a', 'b')` syntax with automatically inserted spaces taken into account.
