Is there a reason why you changed some of them to list comprehension and some to `list(map(foo, bar))`? I understand the ones with `lambda` functions, but there are some that changed seeming arbitrary. I just am curious if there was a reason.

no special reason. I turned things into list comprehension when it was easy and quick, and went to the simple but ugly solution otherwise.

That's something what I figured, but thought I'd check just to be sure.
