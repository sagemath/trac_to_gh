# Issue 12171: Cleanup unexisting methods after #10263

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/12343

Original creator: lftabera

Original creation time: 2012-01-23 13:39:25

Assignee: tbd

CC:  aapitzsch mariah

Keywords: regression, factorization

In ticket #10623, some methods for integer factorization were moved to a separated file. Still, the sage library still calls some of them

_factor_trial_division in integer.pyx function squarefree_part

_factor_cunningham in finite_field_base.pyx and element_base.pyx

These methods should call to the proper functions in factorint.pyx

Line 1002 in *sage/rings/finite_rings/integer_mod.pyx* is too long.

In the same file:

```
sage: a.nth_root(2,False,True,'Johnston',False)
```

should probably be

```
sage: a.nth_root(2,False,True,'Johnston',True)
```

to use cunningham.

```sage -i cunningham_tables``` without version number
is enough.

Please, also remove trailing white spaces about which patchbot is complaining.

```
12343.patch
    12343.patch:14 +        sage: from sage.rings.factorint import factor_cunningham $
    12343.patch:65 +          factorization of ``n`` is computed. If cunningham is set to ``True``, $
Trailing whitespace inserted on 2 non-empty lines.
```

I suppose this is ready for review.

All tests passed including the `-only_optional=cunningham` ones.

Looks good to me!

I wanted to check the compiled docs before setting it ready for review but you were faster :)
