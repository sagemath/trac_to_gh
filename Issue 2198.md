Issue created by migration from Trac.

This increases compilation time and we need to verify that those packages build everywhere, but it seems like the right thing to do.

Cheers,

Michael

To release manager - I recommend this ticket be closed as as duplicate.

To be precise, this is a duplicate of #6532, where there is a much better discussion (as opposed to none here).

As there is a patch (and will be an spkg soon) for #6532, this should be closed.
