# Issue 18333: Cache the result of have_dot2tex

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Keywords: dot2tex

Currently, `have_dot2tex` is not cached and tests for dot2tex by executing a dot2tex command on required functionality, causing unnecessary slowdown. We cache this result.

No, I have one which is below 30 seconds. Frédéric Chapoton had a ticket fixing a one-letter typo `:-P`
