# Issue 29232: Have method is_unit of QuotientRingElement and PolynomialQuotientRingElement return True in more cases

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29469

Original creator: soehms

Original creation time: 2020-04-05 19:58:20

Keywords: quotient ring, polynomial,  is_unit, invert

In the case of both classes there are examples where `is_unit` raises a `NotImplementedError` even though the answer `True` could easily be given:


```
sage: P.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: Q = P.quo([1-x*y])
sage: Q.inject_variables()
Defining xbar, ybar
sage: ybar.is_unit()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NotImplementedError:
```


but:


```
sage: ~ybar
xbar
```


or:


```
sage: Z16x.<x> = Integers(16)[]
sage: S.<y> =  Z16x.quotient(x^2 + x + 1)
sage: S(3).is_unit()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NotImplementedError: The base ring (=Ring of integers modulo 16) is not a field
```


but:


```
sage: Z16x(3).is_unit()
True
```


This will be improved here. Se also this [sage-devel thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/Jc3t8zCSBAs).
