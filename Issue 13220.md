# Issue 13220: Remove GNUTLS-related packages

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: kini

Original creation time: 2012-08-23 13:48:05

Assignee: tbd

Remove the following SPKGs:

 * python_gnutls
 * gnutls
 * opencdk
 * libgcrypt
 * libgpg_error

Furthermore, as I understand it, our switching to OpenSSL had already made GNUTLS useless in Sage when we started shipping the Flask notebook (Sage 5.2), so we can get rid of GNUTLS and related SPKGs at the same time.

See also #13385.

This looks good. Sage builds and all tests pass on several different platforms.

Changed the author field on the patch back to me, since Jeroen had changed it to himself for some reason, I assume by accident.

I think `notebook.setup()` uses `certtool` from `gnutls` and with these packages gone it is no longer sufficient to run `sage -u openssl pyopenssl` to start using a secure notebook. (I've installed gnutls system-wide and it works now.)
