```
Keywords: python3

The old syntax no more supported by Python 3.

Changes according to `lib2to3/fixes/fix_tuple_params.py`:

```
Fixer for function definitions with tuple parameters:
Replace
    def func(((a, b), c), d):
        ...
with
    def func(x, d):
        ((a, b), c) = x
        ...

It will also support lambdas:
    lambda (x, y): x + y -> lambda t: t[0] + t[1]
    # The parens are a syntax error in Python 3
    lambda (x): x + y -> lambda x: x + y
```
