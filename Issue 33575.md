Currently **sagemath-categories** distributes a superset of **sagemath-objects**, and both distributions include a copy of the doctester for their doctesting. We remove this duplication by declaring install-requires and extras-require.

**sage-setup** currently calls into the Sage package that it installs by manipulating the load path. We replace it by an install-requires on **sagemath-environment**.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33812

Now that we are testing **sagemath-objects** with the stuff now in **sagemath-environment** stripped away, dependencies become apparent that need to be removed.

It seems a provision to avoid `ImportError` in the situation when `sage.misc.lazy_import` is used when `sage.features` package is not present...
