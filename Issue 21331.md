Does not work, because there is a line `list = []` in `src/sage/plot/plot3d/implicit_surface.pyx`.

Btw, `list=[1,2,3,4,5]` on `src/sage/misc/functional.py` should be changed too. Found by


```
egrep 'sage:.+[^a-z_0-9A-Z.]list ?=' src/sage -R
```

You have done much more, so thanks to you.

Works now. I suppose you forgot to mark this as needs review, and mark this as positive review.
