At least the following needs to be fixed:

```
sage -t --long --random_seed=151058820726654196682836430928254760259 src/sage/sets/finite_enumerated_set.py  # 1 doctest failed
```

I added a `# random` tag to the example that failed in comment:1 (and also added a basic doctest `S.random_element() in S` to the `random_element()` method of `FiniteEnumeratedSet` ). I tried a few various seeds and have not seen any other doctest failures.

After submitting the PR, I noticed that #29935 suggests `S.random_element().parent() is S` as a doctest, but I don't think that will work here:

```
sage: S = FiniteEnumeratedSet([1,2,3])                                                   
sage: a = S.random_element()                                                             
sage: a                                                                                  
2
sage: a.parent()                                                                         
Integer Ring
sage: S.random_element().parent() is S                                                   
False
```

I think it is important to implement fuzzing of the doctests, so I will try to look at some of the other tickets in #29935 too. Thanks very much for your extensive work on this project!! (and thank you for the review of this ticket)

Thanks.

Well there is #29954, which is pretty annoying and made me slow down a bit. This needs to be taken care of.
