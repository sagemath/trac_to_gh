I added a `# random` tag to the example that failed in comment:1 (and also added a basic doctest `S.random_element() in S` to the `random_element()` method of `FiniteEnumeratedSet` ). I tried a few various seeds and have not seen any other doctest failures.

After submitting the PR, I noticed that #29935 suggests `S.random_element().parent() is S` as a doctest, but I don't think that will work here:

```
sage: S = FiniteEnumeratedSet([1,2,3])                                                   
sage: a = S.random_element()                                                             
sage: a

sage: a.parent()

I think it is important to implement fuzzing of the doctests, so I will try to look at some of the other tickets in #29935 too. Thanks very much for your extensive work on this project!! (and thank you for the review of this ticket)
