Keywords: r-project graphics interfaces

The now-current freetype library has problems with newer fonts. This forbids its uses in some applications on machines having system fonts not supported by this version.

This was diagnosed on sage's R (see [this thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-support/FnTEcpfg6wE)) by Volker Braun.

A stopgap measure would be to upgrade freetype to a more forgiving version of freetype, hence this ticket.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15561

freetype 2.5.2 installs flawlessly IFF libpng12 is patched to avoid a test for setting up error catching via setjmp in libpng12 (which freetype 2.5.2 does anyway).

The resulting sage passes make ptestlong and is able to draw a curve (from sage -R in console). So I think that this ticket is ready for review.

Since it installs a newer version of a standard package and paches another onte, I think that it should be reviewed on various system (at least Mac OS X and/or Cygwin, which seem to be the most difficult cases) before clearing it.

I have two problems with this branch :

1) I seem to be unable to get this code back on an sage tree on another machine :


```
sage -dev checkout --ticket 15561
sage -dev diff
```

gives me an empty diff...

2) I added a new freetype tarball in upstream and deleted the previous one. None of this appears in the branch, at least as displayed on the trac page.

I'll have to beg some help on sage-support...

Ahiii ! That's the snag in libpng that triggered me to patch pngconf.h. How can i check that this patch has been applied ? This error (horror ?) originates in a code section that I #defined around...

Edit, Dec 25 : I see *another* build problem with PIL and freetype. but I could diagnose it only by creating a new sage tree and git'ing !#15661 directly : adding #15561 to an already compiled tree does not force recompilation of PIL.

The problem :Â 


```

[ ... ]
```

This happens twice (PIL attemps compilation with and without Tkinter support). This is caused by the fact that the directory containing freetype headers is no longer local/include/freetype but local/include/freetype2.

Since Pillow is now accepted in the next sage, my plan is :

* start a new tree
* fetch the Pillow branch (for rebase ?)
* fetch !#15561 and adjust it.

Your thoughts ?

> You should always merge (and never rebase) branches that are already published on trac, since somebody else might have used that already as a base for their own branch. 

Okay. Can't say I fully understand it yet, but I did that.

Is it possible that buildbot's freetype compilation might pickup an unpatched (possibly system's) pngconf.h ? If so, how to prevent this from happening ?

Looking at build/deps, the freetype package does not depend on libpng so will potentially build at the same time. Might be a race condition.

Ouch ! Freetype depends on libpng, but libpng needs to be patched *first*, which means it can't be patched by freetype's branch, if I understand that correctly. The only way out I see is :

1. create a new branch patching libpng in a ticket #xx
2. wait for #xx to get reviewed and getting to state "fixed", and
3. modify #15561 to depend on #xx.

I don't see how this can be made in one ticket. Do you have different thoughts ?
