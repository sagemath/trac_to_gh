`log` is not a symbolic function but only wrapper def that calls various methods. We move it to `sage.misc.functional` so that non-symbolic uses of it do not pull in symbolics.

Similar to #32717 for `sqrt`.

It would be a little cleaner if the import in `combinat/words/finite_word.py` were `from sage.misc.functional import log`.

I kept this one (in `topological_entropy`) as an import from `sage.functions.log` because a symbolic result is expected, as the doctests illustrate
