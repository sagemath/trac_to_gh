When saving a 3D object to a PNG file, the options passed to `save` are not taken into account:


```
sage: g = sphere()
sage: g.save("sphere.png", aspect_ratio=[1, 1, 0.5], viewer='tachyon')
```

None of the above options is effective: the output file is generated with Jmol (instead of Tachyon), with an aspect ratio of [1,1,1]. Actually, the options are not passed to `save_image` (which is invoked by `save`):

```
g.save_image("sphere.png", aspect_ratio=[1, 1, 0.5], viewer='tachyon')
```

produces the expected result.

This ticket corrects this and updates the documentation of `Graphics3d.save`
