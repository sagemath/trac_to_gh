This is not a matter of tool, but a matter of respecting fully the pep8 standard of code.

There is no need to force the modification of all existing headers, but one can move forward in newly introduced headers, and from time to time modify some older ones.

PEP8 says "However, know when to be inconsistent -- sometimes style guide recommendations just aren't applicable."

But of course there is no reason to miss the one space asked by pep8. It will help running pep8-tool a little bit. And I can't see reason to not do the change.

I think that our header will be slightly uglier with the extra space. But really, I don't want to discuss further. If you feel like the header must be changed, just do it.

How? Tools help if used correctly; in this case it means to use as a tool giving hints, not as a tool giving rules.

For some discussion about pep8 see #24076.

I mark this one as positive review.

+1 to this but that is not what you are doing here.

You are contradicting yourself: on the one hand, you say that it just gives hints. On the other hand, you think that our header file must be changed (IMHO, made uglier) because the tool tells you to.

IMO the header is just as beatiful before and after this patch. This is of course a matter on opinion.

The less we got warnings, the more we can concentrate on the warnings we see. This is a very tiny step to that direction.
