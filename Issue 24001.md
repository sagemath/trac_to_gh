if sympy is not yet built, the docbuilding might fail.

Looks good to me. It explains a few messages around the mailing list and is an appropriate fix.

I think the fact that the documentation depends on a sympy is a recent regression. I think it might be solved by #24067 which would be a better solution. I'm setting this to sage-pending to check that.

In fact, #24067 does fix this ticket in a better way, so I suggest to close this one.

I do not get how #24067 would solve the issue on this ticket. `sympy` **is** a dependence of docbuilding.

Yes, and that's the bug that #24067 fixes. It shouldn't be a dependency.

Anyway, given that #24067 is stalled, we should merge this anyway. And since it breaks building Sage, it should even be a blocker.
