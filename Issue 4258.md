Just for the record: Burcin came pretty far during SD16 and IIRC Cl√©ment then too over?

see #4260 for ongoing work. Shall we close this as a duplicate?

Martin suggested to close this ticket as a duplicate of #4260, and I agree. So, I'm inserting Martin as a reviewer and change it into a positive review (with the suggested resolution "duplicate").
