# Issue 11277: Do not make sage-env executable

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/11449

`sage-make_devel_packages` should not make `sage-env` executable.  Merged ticket #10469 changed the permissions of `sage-env` to non-executable and `sage-make_devel_packages` should be changed accordingly.

Er, why is `sage-make_devel_packages` modifying permissions on these files anyway (lines 139-141)? Aren't they already all tracked by the `$SAGE_ROOT/local/bin` repository?

I also wondered about that.  Since I don't really know why, I decided to leave those `chmod`s in.  In any case, that can be dealt with on a different ticket.

Well, this is a mystery for sage-devel. I posted there. Hopefully we can just get rid of that in this patch - there's no reason to make two patches for such closely related issues, and over only three lines of code, IMO...

Applied patch to sage-4.7.1.alpha2, did 'sage -sdist', built and tested source with 'make testlong'.  All tests passed.  Positive review!

Thanks for taking the time to do that! Can we resolve the other issue as well? Or should I make a new ticket about it?

I think that should be on a different ticket.
