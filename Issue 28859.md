CC:  @embray @dimpase @jhpalmieri

It is unnecessarily confusing that `build/bin/sage-spkg` transforms the template `spkg-install` to an executable script that is *also* called `spkg-install`.

This ticket renames all `build/pkgs/SPKG/spkg-*` of packages other than `type=script` (which are regular executable shell scripts already) to `build/pkgs/SPKG/spkg-*.in`.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29096

They are already distinguished by the fact that they are not marked executable.  If you really want to make a distinction, you can have the files output by `sage-spkg` have a different name, but that's not much clearer.  It's nice when debugging a build directory to have the output `spkg-install` just work.

In fact, come to think of it, these files are not even *templates*.  The *template* is the code in `sage-spkg`:


```

    local script="$1"

    if head -1 "$script" | grep '^#!.*$' >/dev/null; then

        exit 1
    fi

    local tmpscript="$(dirname "$script")/.tmp-${script##*/}"

    cat > "$tmpscript" <<__EOF__
#!/usr/bin/env bash

export SAGE_ROOT="$SAGE_ROOT"

        echo >&2 "Error: failed to source \$lib"

        exit 1
    fi
done

__EOF__

    cat "$script" >> "$tmpscript"

```


That's the template.  The files in `build/pkg/*/spkg-*` are not templates.  They are snippets that are interpolated into that template.

The files could just as well be generated by configure. The only thing that's missing for that is a line

```
@SPKG_SCRIPT@
```

on top of each of the .in files. I'm not proposing to do that in this ticket. But I hope this explains why the files now have the .in extension.

there are `build/pkgs/*/spkg-install` files which are proper shell scripts (for spkgs which are of type `script`).
One should make them namewise-distinct from templates, e.g. as done on this branch, or by appending `.sh` to them.

It would be less invasive but accomplish the same thing (wouldn't it?) if we kept the `spkg-install` files as they are, but had `sage-spkg` create new scripts `spkg-install.sh` in the build directories.

If you have a better word for this, I'll be happy to change the documentation.
Autoconf just calls these files "input files" (hence .in)

You are using the word "invasive" differently than the rest of us, I think. I just mean: it touches a lot of files.
