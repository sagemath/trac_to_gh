Note: The attached ReST file needs to be added as part of a new "it" subdirectory in the documentation dir of the Sage library.

I have incorporated your last version. Are you happy with it ? Please check by clicking on the green link in the branch field on top of the page. If yes, I think I can set this to positive review.

I can't get the PDF version of this to build without patching Sphinx: I get the error

```
! Package babel Error: I cannot switch `"' on or off--not a shorthand.

See the babel package documentation for explanation.
Type  H <return>  for immediate help.
 ...                                              
                                                  
l.145 \shorthandoff{"}
                      
? 
! Emergency stop.
 ...                                              
                                                  
l.145 \shorthandoff{"}
                      
!  ==> Fatal error occurred, no output PDF file produced!
Transcript written on a_tour_of_sage.log.
make: *** [a_tour_of_sage.pdf] Error 1
Error building the documentation.
```

If I patch Sphinx (in particular the file `sphinx/writers/latex.py`) with the change

```diff
--- latex.py	2014-07-29 21:44:05.000000000 -0700
+++ latex_new.py	2014-07-29 21:45:30.000000000 -0700
`@``@` -100,7 +100,7 `@``@`
 class ExtBabel(Babel):
     def get_shorthandoff(self):
         shortlang = self.language.split('_')[0]
-        if shortlang in ('de', 'sl', 'pt', 'es', 'nl', 'pl', 'it'):
+        if shortlang in ('de', 'sl', 'pt', 'es', 'nl', 'pl'):
             return '\\shorthandoff{"}'
         return ''
```

then it works. Or am I missing something?

Babel version 3.9k: `\ProvidesPackage{babel}[2014/03/24 3.9k The Babel package]`

Edit: and `[2014/03/29 v1.3k Italian support from the babel system]`
