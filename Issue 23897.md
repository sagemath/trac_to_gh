In a few cases, `obj.iteritems()` does not get special cased by Cython if Cython is not aware that `obj` is a dict.

Replying to [comment:2 chapoton]:
> What about itervalues and iterkeys ?

As far as I know, there is no `itervalues()` or `iterkeys()` to be fixed.

There is still an issue in `coerce_dict.pyx` with `iteritems()` but I'm fixing that in #24135.
