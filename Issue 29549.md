LGTM.

As for testing, I rebuilt cython files in sage.rings on my machine and `sage -t --long src/sage/rings/` passes.

Sorry, the last commit was supposed to go to a different ticket.

```
src/sage/misc/sageinspect.py:121:1 'sys' imported but unused
```


I guess as you touched the file, the warning shows up.

Comment by @kliem created at 2020-06-13 18:59:29

I tested it again and the bots are happy. I would propose removing this unneeded import and then you can put it back on positive review.
