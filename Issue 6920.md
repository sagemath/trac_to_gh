I just ran the following on sagenb.org (so the latest release):

PP.<x,y,z,w> = ProjectiveSpace(3,QQ)
f = x^3 + y^3 + z^3 + w^3
R = f.parent()
I = [f] + [f.derivative(zz) for zz in PP.gens()]
V = PP.subscheme(I)
V.irreducible_components()

The output is:



[
Closed subscheme of Projective Space of dimension 3 over Rational
Field
defined by:
 w
 z
 y
 x
]

[
Closed subscheme of Projective Space of dimension 3 over Rational
Field defined by:
 w
 z
 y
 x
]


I think that the problem is that normally Proj(R) is defined to be all
prime ideals that do not contain

sum_{d > 0} S_d

where R is a graded ring graded by non-negative integers, and S_d is
the ideal generated by homogeneous elements of degree d.  I glanced at
irreducible_components and it just returns all of the prime ideals
coming from the primary decomposition.  In the case that the ambient
scheme is projective, it should exclude some.

P.S. I wrote this code, so I think it's OK for me to call this stupid.  -- William
