Assignee: @nthiery

Keywords: beginner, sd40.5

Currently, dir(RIF), and probably a few others, contains duplicates:


```
sage: A = dir(RIF)
sage: B = set(A)
sage: for b in B: A.remove(b)
sage: A
['__doc__', '_sage_src_lines_', 'is_field', 'is_integrally_closed']
```


The attached patch fixes this problem.

Yeah.  But I didn't mark it as needs work since I wanted another opinion.  And since I haven't compared the performance of the two options.

Is dir() actually used in a performance critical spot?  I had just assumed it was basically for introspection.
