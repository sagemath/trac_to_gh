The paper has appeared in IMRN. It might be a good idea to update the reference!

I've fixed the typo and updated the reference as best I could. Anne, do you have any other bibliographic information for your paper with Jennifer I should add?

Thank you.

It might be a good idea to add a doctest to check that the map is indeed a crystal isomorphism. Right now the method `is_isomorphic` just returns True without checking anything.

Is this good to go ? You can set a positive review on my behalf, if yes.

I am ok with it, as long as someone else runs the tests again. I currently cannot do that.

The patchbots are happy (except librae which is currently broken). So I allow myself to
put this to positive review.
