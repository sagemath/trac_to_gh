Keywords: upgrade, dot2tex

A straightforward upgrade, which includes support for Python3. I also fix something in `spkg-check` to use the Python installed by Sage.

I haven't tested it yet, but otherwise this looks fine to me! Thanks Travis. I got hit by that lack of support for Python3 two days ago!

I tested this both on Python2 and 3 (in part because I wrote the dot2tex port PR). I completely forgot to do this upgrade ticket until today when I was upgrading my python3 build. `:P` Sorry it was a little late for you.

Could you give some instructions on how to test your changes? Get your branch and then install the tarball?

You will need to get the branch and download the tarball from the link in the description,  putting it in the `$SAGE_ROOT/upstream` folder. Then just run `make build` or `sage -i dot2tex`. You can also run `sage -i -c dot2tex` if you want to run the spkg's test suite.

Ok, thanks! Now that I could finally build sage again, I tried out your updated dot2tex package and it seems to work great.

Please also run self-tests when upgrading a package.
