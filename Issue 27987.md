The latest commit fixes a weird build bug I was getting.
Namely, if `LCALC_INCDIR_NOLIBPREFIX==''` the build was failing.
So I made it to always be something non-empty and OK for gcc (7 and 8.3, neither worked).

Needs final review now.

I mean a reasonable behavior out of the box when the variable is unset. (ie. if some distro renames the header dir or the lib name, not setting the variable should use the upstream name)
