CC:  ncohen nthiery

We implement three missing methods in `sage.sets.cartesian_product.CartesianProduct`:
- `__hash__`
- `is_finite`
- `cardinality`

No. The order of enumeration of a cartesian products is lexicographic. So a cartesian product of infinite enumerated sets should even **not** be an enumerated set!

    TESTS::

       sage: 1+1
       2
    """
```

this is not considered as a doctest. But if instead I do

```
class A:
    my_string = (
        r"""
        TESTS::

            sage: print "Is this a test?"
            Of course not
        """
    )
```

then it is considered as a doctest!!

The algorithm used to detect doctests is clearly wrong!

As we discussed on the phone with Nicolas: I removed the abstract methods: `is_empty`, `is_finite` and `random_element` from `Sets`. For the first two, we might not want to call `cardinality` as this can easily lead to loop (e.g. #18400). As a rationale: a less specialized method should not try to call a more specialized one. For random_element: adding an optional abstract method would pollute the namespace.

- unrank: `IndexError` is what is uniformly in `categories/*` and also in `combinat/cartesian_product`.
- I moved is_empty from `Magmas.FinitelyGenerated.Unital.ParentMethods.is_empty` to `Magmas.Unital.is_empty` and everything looks fine
- random_element: tuple removed

I will add a second commit for `order` vs `cardinality` in `Groups`.

Hello,

For `cardinality` vs `order` here is the list of files I had to change:

- algebras/quatalg/quaternion_algebra.py
- algebras/steenrod/steenrod_algebra.py
- groups/abelian_gps/abelian_group.py
- groups/abelian_gps/dual_abelian_group.py
- groups/additive_abelian/additive_abelian_group.py
- groups/group.pyx
- groups/indexed_free_group.py
- groups/matrix_gps/coxeter_group.py
- groups/old.pyx
- groups/pari_group.py
- groups/perm_gps/permgroup.py
- groups/semimonomial_transformations/semimonomial_transformation_group.py
- libs/coxeter3/coxeter.pyx
- modular/abvar/finite_subgroup.py
- modular/abvar/torsion_subgroup.py
- modular/arithgroup/arithgroup_generic.py
- modular/dirichlet.py
- rings/contfrac.py
- rings/finite_rings/finite_field_base.pyx
- rings/finite_rings/finite_field_ext_pari.py

- rings/polynomial/infinite_polynomial_ring.py
- rings/polynomial/polynomial_quotient_ring.py
- rings/qqbar.py
- rings/rational_field.py
- rings/ring.pyx

In particular it concerns not only groups but:
- (multiplicative) groups
- additive (Abelian) groups
- rings

At least Sage is able to start but I am not sure it fits exactly the purpose of the ticket. If you do not mind I will push that commit in #18410.

;-) I agree with Nathann that it is perhaps not the best default. Though, let us keep it independent of this ticket. My motivation for the rationale was to avoid loops like

- is_finite asks cardinality
- cardinality asks is_finite before starting to iterate

(which is exactly the problem with projective scheme).

On the other hand, there is sometimes nothing else to do than going through the list of elements to get the cardinality. And you know it: `sage.graphs.independent_sets.IndependentSets`.

This is exactly what I did:

```
class EnumeratedSets:
    class ParentMethods:
        def is_empty(self):
            try:
                iter(self).next()

                return False
            else:
                return True

> - _sets_keys(): do we really want an `IntegerRange` rather than a `range`? I would imagine `IntegerRange` could be faster for containment testing and slower for iteration, so again a tradeoff.

It is **much** faster for containment test and it is currently the only way it is used in `sage.sets.cartesian_product` (the method `cartesian_projection`). If the iteration is slower, then we should just make it faster in `IntegerRange`!

>  In any cases, I'll be busy all day and don't have a strong opinion on either of the above points. So please make the choice you feel right. And then I consider this as good to go.

I am running the long tests and will set positive review if everything is fine.
