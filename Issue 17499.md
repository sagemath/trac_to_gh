```
sage: a = var('a')
sage: b = (1/a).fraction(QQ)
...
TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for '/': 'Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field' and 'Univariate Polynomial Ring in a over Rational Field'
```

The `1` apparently gets coerced into the `x`-ring, so we need to ensure equal rings somehow.

Looks good to me. A potential feature request could be to allow the user to specify the ordering of variables, but perhaps that's overkill?

I'm not so familiar with algebra. Would you suggest specific orderings or is there a convention?

Hi, sorry for not being clear:

I merely meant the ordering of variable (names), where you currently call `sort()`. But as I said: it's an optional feature request which could go into a separate ticket.

Of course, arbitrary term ordering ("lex" and "deglex" etc.) could also be considered. But I'd say a user should do the conversion by hand perhaps in this case.
