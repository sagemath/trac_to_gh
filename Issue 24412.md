The printed name directly depends on the `name=` keyword in the function initialization which itself must match a `set_name` call inside Pynac. The best way to proceed, instead of accompanying a new Pynac release with a sizeable doctest patch, would be to add a separate (small) Pynac patch to a ticket, either this or separate, depending on reviewer's convenience.
