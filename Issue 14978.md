Matrices inherit from `RingElement` even if they are not square.  Their parents do behave correctly.

```
sage: A = Matrix([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
sage: A.parent() in Rings()
True
sage: A.parent() in Modules(ZZ)
True
sage: isinstance(A, RingElement)
True

sage: B = Matrix([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
sage: B.parent() in Rings()
False
sage: A.parent() in Modules(ZZ)
True
sage: isinstance(B, RingElement)
True
```

The same happens with `Algebras(ZZ)` and `AlgebraElement`.

Square matrices over a ring `R` should be made to inherit dynamically from `AlgebraElement`; non-square matrices should only inherit from `ModuleElement`.

_Motivation:_ Multiplication of matrices over a commutative ring _R_ is in general only a bilinear map between _R_-modules (in general three different ones).  Only if the matrices are square of the same size _n_ can this be described as the multiplication map on an _R_-algebra, namely Mat<sub>_n_</sub>(_R_).

I propose to close this as a duplicate of #804.
