I know this is bikeshedding, nobody will probably ever really read this file, and C++ does not have nearly the same style uniformity that Python has. So you can completely ignore this. Yet, IMO, most C++ programmers have their opening `{` on the same line that starts the block (and it is more Python-esque). So I do not quite agree with this:

```diff
diff --git a/src/sage/ext/ccobject.h b/src/sage/ext/ccobject.h
index 6753a0a..c6cadb9 100644
--- a/src/sage/ext/ccobject.h
+++ b/src/sage/ext/ccobject.h
`@``@` -114,15 +49,18 `@``@` static CYTHON_INLINE PyObject* ccrepr(const T& x)
 #endif
 }
 
+
 /* Arrays */
 template <class T>
-static inline T* Allocate_array(size_t n){
-  return new T[n];
+static inline T* Allocate_array(size_t n)
+{
+    return new T[n];
 }
 
 template <class T>
-static inline void Delete_array(T* v){
-  delete[] v;
+static inline void Delete_array(T* v)
+{
+    delete[] v;
 }
 
 #endif
```

However, if you prefer it in even the slightest (including out of laziness), then just set a positive review. Likewise, if you undo this change, you can set a positive review on my behalf.

Google agrees with you: http://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Function_Declarations_and_Definitions

GNU agrees with me: https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/standards.html#Formatting

I'll go for the "lazy" option and keep this branch as is.
