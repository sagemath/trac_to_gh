Ticket #19619 has deprecated method `size_of_alphabet` of `Words`, causing the following errors (not seen before due to missing doctests):

```
sage: digraphs.DeBruijn(2,3, vertices='integers')
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)
...
AttributeError: 'Words_n_with_category' object has no attribute 'size_of_alphabet'
sage: digraphs.Kautz(2,3, vertices='integers')
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)
...
AttributeError: 'Words_n_with_category' object has no attribute 'size_of_alphabet'
```


We fix these bugs and add the missing doctests.
