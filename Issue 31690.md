`is_included_in` is only defined by `RealSet`. We deprecate it and replace it by `is_subset`.

The spelling `issubset` is used in Python sets. `is_subset` is widely used in Sage. Sympy provides both spellings (see #31926)

For symmetry, we also introduce `is_superset`/`issuperset` etc.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31927

Can you also open a followup ticket (or on the original tickets or here) some quick fixes of some little things I missed during my previous reviews (sorry!):

- #31880 Add `# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-` to the top of `piecewise.py`.
- #21243 Remove the `itertools` import.
