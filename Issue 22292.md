with Sage 7.5.1:

```
sage: reset()
sage: quit

NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

----> 1 quit

NameError: name 'quit' is not defined
```

I believe reset() should restore exactly the initial state when starting Sage, including the `quit` function.

I don't see that these are set anywhere, even from notebook imports. What about `__DIR__`? I can't find it either.
