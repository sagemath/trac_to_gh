# Issue 22292: reset does not restore "quit"

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: zimmerma

Original creation time: 2017-03-06 14:09:37

with Sage 7.5.1:

```
sage: reset()
sage: quit
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
/localdisk/tmp/sage-7.5.1/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/all_cmdline.pyc in <module>()
----> 1 quit

NameError: name 'quit' is not defined
```

I believe reset() should restore exactly the initial state when starting Sage, including the `quit` function.

Near-dup of #16704.

Will something as naive as

```
diff --git a/src/sage/misc/reset.pyx b/src/sage/misc/reset.pyx
index bd7c94b..21e1587 100644
--- a/src/sage/misc/reset.pyx
+++ b/src/sage/misc/reset.pyx
`@``@` -7,7 +7,7 `@``@` import sys
 
 # Exclude these from the reset command.
 # DATA, base64 -- needed by the notebook
-EXCLUDE = set(['sage_mode', '__DIR__', 'DIR', 'DATA', 'base64'])
+EXCLUDE = set(['sage_mode', '__DIR__', 'DIR', 'DATA', 'base64', 'exit', 'quit'])
 
 def reset(vars=None, attached=False):
     """
```

do the job, or are there other ramifications that need to be addressed?

I was wondering about that solution, too. It seems to work in my very superficial testing. I also wonder if we should delete 'DIR', 'DATA', and 'base64' from `EXCLUDE`.

Another idea: can we use the reset command from IPython? Type `%reset` at the command-line to try it. It removes `sage_mode` but preserves `exit` and `quit`.

Oops, no, `%reset` also kills `Integer` and other sage imports.

Maybe use `%reset -s`, or `%reset -s -f` to skip the confirmation. The command `%reset_selective REGEXP` will reset any names matching `REGEXP`:

```
sage: a = 3
sage: a2 = 5
sage: %whos
Variable   Type       Data/Info
-------------------------------
a          Integer    3
a2         Integer    5
sage: %reset_selective a
Once deleted, variables cannot be recovered. Proceed (y/[n])?  y
sage: %whos
Interactive namespace is empty.

sage: a = 3
sage: a2 = 5
sage: %reset_selective -f ^a$
sage: %whos
Variable   Type       Data/Info
-------------------------------
a2         Integer    5
```

I don't see that these are set anywhere, even from notebook imports. What about `__DIR__`? I can't find it either.

Not correction above.

When I search for these terms in the Sage tree, I see no hits (except for this one line in `reset.pyx`) for `__DIR__`, and nothing apparently relevant for `DIR`, `DATA`, or `base64`. `sage_mode` is used in `src/sage/all_cmdline.py` and `src/sage/all_notebook.py`.

the patch proposed in comment [comment:2] fixes the issue for me.

Changing status from new to needs_review.

I left `__DIR__`, `DIR`, `DATA` and `base64` in place as I found some reference to these variables in the `sagenb` code. Feel free to alter.

Branch pushed to git repo; I updated commit sha1. New commits:

seems fine to me. However someone should check it works in the notebook too.

Looks good to me. As far as I can tell, `exit` and `quit` don't do much in the old Sage notebook. They function as they should in the Jupyter notebook. Without this branch, `reset()` kills them, and with this branch, it does not, and they continue to function.

So how do we deal with #16704? I don't see a `dup` or some other appropriate button. Perhaps positive review there too?

you should modify that other ticket as "resolved as duplicate".
