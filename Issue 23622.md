This is really nice.  I don't know why I don't know when that was added ... can you put an interlink to where there is more documentation on the color function needing to be between 0 and 1?  Otherwise as long as the patchbot is happy I think all your formatting etc. is right.

I am not sure that there is any other place where this [0,1] constraint is explained. It even does not appear in the other similar examples of plots.

I must say that I do not have much more time and energy to spend on that.
