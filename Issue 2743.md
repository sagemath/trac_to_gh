It would be nice if the following worked:


```
sage: f = x>3
sage: f(2)
False
sage: f(4)
True
```

original

```
sage: var('x y')
(x, y)
sage: eq=x<y
sage: %timeit eq(x=2, y=3)
10 loops, best of 3: 54.6 Âµs per loop
```



After

```
sage: var('x y')
(x, y)
sage: eq=x<y
sage: %timeit eq(x=2, y=3)
10 loops, best of 3: 78.9 ms per loop
```

While there currently is callable functionality, it is broken.  See the doctests in the patch for several breakages of the current functionality.

This patch hands all the work off to symbolic matrices.  That makes it really slow, but it works.  The next thing to do would be to write the functionality directly into this class.

Yep, this works well for me. It looks like the matrix is used to ensure that substitutions are to the correct variables, and that works well.
