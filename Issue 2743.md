sage: f(2)
False
sage: f(4)
True
```

While there currently is callable functionality, it is broken.  See the doctests in the patch for several breakages of the current functionality.

This patch hands all the work off to symbolic matrices.  That makes it really slow, but it works.  The next thing to do would be to write the functionality directly into this class.
