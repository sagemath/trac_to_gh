Several places in Sage refer to graphviz.

We should add it to the distribution, either as a script package just to link it to system package information, or as a normal optional package.

Current versions of `graphviz` seem to be licensed under the Eclipse Public License 1.0, which is a free software license but GPL-incompatible. https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/blob/master/LICENSE

So probably we should not make it a standard package.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31177

`graphviz` build seems brittle: Failing here on macOS because `ps2pdf` is not available and PDF manual build cannot seem to be disabled.

Perhaps it's best to just make it a script package that provides system package info after all.

I don't know if I have tested it enough (did a few tests on graphs), but it seems ok to me.
