Since #10038, we can do :


```
sage: sin(x).exponentialize()
-1/2*I*e^(I*x) + 1/2*I*e^(-I*x)
```


"The competition", however, goes a bit further :


```
sage: arcsin(x)._sympy_().rewrite("log")._sage_()
-I*log(I*x + sqrt(-x^2 + 1))
sage: mathematica.TrigToExp(arcsin(x)).sage()
-I*log(I*x + sqrt(-x^2 + 1))
```


This ticket extends `.exponentialize` to reciprocal trig/hyperbolic functions.
