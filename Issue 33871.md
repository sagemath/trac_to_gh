# Issue 33871: Extend exponentialize to reciprocal trig/hyperbolic functions.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/34108

Original creator: charpent

Original creation time: 2022-07-03 07:57:22

Since #10038, we can do :


```
sage: sin(x).exponentialize()
-1/2*I*e^(I*x) + 1/2*I*e^(-I*x)
```


"The competition", however, goes a bit further :


```
sage: arcsin(x)._sympy_().rewrite("log")._sage_()
-I*log(I*x + sqrt(-x^2 + 1))
sage: mathematica.TrigToExp(arcsin(x)).sage()
-I*log(I*x + sqrt(-x^2 + 1))
```


This ticket extends `.exponentialize` to reciprocal trig/hyperbolic functions.

First attempt. Passes its own doctest, and `ptestlong` without specific failures (but I got new failures reproduced in `develop`, see [this post](https://groups.google.com/g/sage-release/c/JZ5WOz2BNvA/m/WHT6rJ_JAQAJ)).

==>`needs_review`.

Sorry for the typo...

Starting on line 6078, I think all of the doctests should be indented one more level.

Done (I hope).

Sorry for the noise (typo in pushing...).
