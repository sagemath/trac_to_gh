Currently implicit_plot does not allow you to plot the zero sets of complex functions. It would be nice if one could do this. (This was mentioned in an [email thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-support/dZg1Fz25fyY) last year but I haven't found any other work on it.)

I think this would be solved by switching `contour_plot` to use `fast_callable` instead of `fast_float`, as was done for `plot` in #15030.

This is probably fixed by #8450, but bugs in `contour_plot` are getting in the way (#21042).

The following modification of the email example `z - |z|` works after #8450:

```
sage: x,y = SR.var('x,y')                                                       
sage: z = x + I*y                                                               
sage: f = (z - abs(z)).real()                                                   
sage: implicit_plot(f + 0.2, (0,1), (0,1))
```

First, you have to take the real part of the answer, since the plotting functions are expecting a real result. But then to avoid the issue in #21042, we have to perturb the whole thing (by 0.2, in my example).

If we are willing to accept the need to add `real()` onto the example, then I think we can consider this fixed by #8450, and deal with the `contour_plot()` zero issue on its own ticket.
