There are some minor issues with documentation for toggling/rowmotion/birational rowmotion methods that live in categories/finite_posets.py , because they refer to the methods order_ideal_toggle() and order_ideal_toggles() as if they live in the same file (but they actually live in categories/posets.py).

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25960

There are lots of other similar issues where reference to other methods/classes/etc. aren't properly formatted. I may try to handle a bunch of those in a future ticket, now that I know what's not working, how to fix it, and that I can build the doc with a --warn-links flag to point out where they exist.

Ready for review, should only be three lines changed, review should pretty much only entail building the new doc and making sure that the reference links exist. I believe the doc may need to be built from scratch, it does not appear that incremental documentation builds recognize this minor of a change.
