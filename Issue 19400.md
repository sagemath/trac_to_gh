This fixes optional doctests for coxeter3 that come from changes made in #17798. As part of the fix, this implements a `__ne__` for `CoxeterMatrix`, and now actually tests for `==` (which I missed after the refactoring).

Looks good. Fixes the optional doctests I reported on sage-release (sage-6.10.beta5 thread).
