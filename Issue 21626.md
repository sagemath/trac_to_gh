Thanks for the revival. If all test pass, would you agree on a positive review?

Well, almost.

- I am not fully happy with the test for type "str" to check if the color is a color or a coloring. Maybe we should rather check for type "dict" to recognize colorings ?

- I would still like to add a reference to [Livi1993] (which gives a nice presentation of knots colorings)

Fine. I will try to work on it during the weekend.

I have made the changes that I wanted to do. I will now launch my bot. If it comes back green, it will be ready for your approval.

Bot is green. I am ok with the code. If you too, please set to positive.

Now that I look at it, I am not completely sure that the result of `is_colorable` is mathematically correct in general: it relies on `coloring_matrix`, which takes the next prime of the passed number. So in the case of prime numbers, that is correct, but for non-prime, we are actually saying if it is p-colorable for the next prime p.

Maybe it is ok if we just calrify this in the documentation? Or should we write more complete code to check that there actually exist solutions over the integers mod n for non prime n?

I also have one doc nitpick: `n` should be in code formatting.

I am happy with things as the added documentation does clarify what Sage does, but I want to wait to see if Miguel has any additional comments.

I added a check for next prime also in `colorings`, so it is now totally clear that we only cover the case of prime number of colors. Maybe we should support also non prime number of colors, but that requires slightly more sophisticated algorithms, so it should be better done in another ticket.

If you are ok with these last changes, positive review.
