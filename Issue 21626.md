Well, almost.

- I am not fully happy with the test for type "str" to check if the color is a color or a coloring. Maybe we should rather check for type "dict" to recognize colorings ?

- I would still like to add a reference to [Livi1993] (which gives a nice presentation of knots colorings)

Now that I look at it, I am not completely sure that the result of `is_colorable` is mathematically correct in general: it relies on `coloring_matrix`, which takes the next prime of the passed number. So in the case of prime numbers, that is correct, but for non-prime, we are actually saying if it is p-colorable for the next prime p.

Maybe it is ok if we just calrify this in the documentation? Or should we write more complete code to check that there actually exist solutions over the integers mod n for non prime n?

I added a check for next prime also in `colorings`, so it is now totally clear that we only cover the case of prime number of colors. Maybe we should support also non prime number of colors, but that requires slightly more sophisticated algorithms, so it should be better done in another ticket.

If you are ok with these last changes, positive review.
