It all looks good to me, thanks! May I ask, is there a reason why this was done? Is it part of the modularization process?

Thanks for the review!

Yes, sorry, I should have put it in the ticket description: It is for modularization - see â€‹https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/packaging_sage_library.html#module-level-runtime-dependencies
