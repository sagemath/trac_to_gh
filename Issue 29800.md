# Issue 29800: Added a construction for BIBDs from symmetric BIBDs

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30037

Given a symmetric `(v, k, lambd)`-BIBD one can build a `(v-k, k-lambd, lambd)`-BIBD by removing a block from the former.

to test this recursive builder, it would be nice to have a (maybe internal) function to build all the 2-designs known to Sage with at  most v points and with lambda in a given range.

Please do what I propose in comment:3 on another ticket.
As an example of such a test, cf. `_check_database()` in `sage.graphs.strongly_regular_db`.
