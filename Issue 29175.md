# Issue 29175: Deprecate cotangent methods named "cotan" to "cot"

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29412

Original creator: @DaveWitteMorris

Original creation time: 2020-03-26 22:04:33

Keywords: cotangent, complex

Most of sage uses `cot` for the cotangent function `1/tan(x)`, but the classes `ComplexNumber` and `MPComplexNumber` have methods that are called `cotan`, instead. To eliminate a bug caused by this inconsistency, ticket #29409 renames these methods to `cot`. 

For backward compatibility, ticket #29409 defines `cotan` as an alias for `cot` in these two classes. This ticket deprecates those aliases.

FWIW, Maple uses `cot` and Mathematica uses `Cot`.

To avoid a merge conflict, I merged with #29409, but that makes no changes to the files in this branch. (The lines that changed in #29409 are exactly the ones that this ticket replaces with deprecations.)

Batch modifying tickets that will likely not be ready for 9.1, based on a review of the ticket title, branch/review status, and last modification date.
