# Issue 12983: Boolean Multivariate Ideals should not have negative dimension....

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13155

The dimension of an ideal cannot be negative (it would be mathematically incoherent). Yet, in SAGE, it is possible to create Boolean Ideals of dimension -1..... 


```
sage: n=11
sage: R = BooleanPolynomialRing(n, 'x')
sage: R2 = PolynomialRing(GF(2), n, 'x')
sage: I = ideal([ R(f) for f in sage.rings.ideal.Cyclic(R2, n).gens() ])
sage: I.dimension()
-1
```


In fact, all the BooleanPolynomialIdeal's should have dimension zero. Thus I suggest to overload the dimension() method to just return zero....

Looks good except for one minor detail


```
TESTS:: 
    # check that Ticket #13155 is solved 
```


should be rewritten as:


```
TESTS:

Check that :trac:`13155` is solved::

    sage: ...
```


So there's an empty line between `::` and the Sage tests (which I believe is required) and it uses the `:trac:`foo`` directive.

Sorry for being picky but there's still an issue there. The `::` indicates that the code block follows (which is then used for doctests. You have two of those one after TESTS and one after the sentence. You need to drop the one after TESTS

I will eventually learn to do this right on the first try... Patch updated.
