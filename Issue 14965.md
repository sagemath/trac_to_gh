Only the first commit should have been shown here, I've emailed Andrew to fix the commit hook.

Since OS X doesn't include X11 headers (at least by default), this doesn't build on OS X. Here's a revised version. This also adds `CHomP` to `build/deps` and `build/install`. I also noticed that this doesn't include the `homchain` program for homology of chain complexes. Was that an intentional omission? Or is that supposed to now be taken care of by `chomp-matrix`?

Can someone provide a valid URL for the tarball? I get "404 Not Found" with the listed one.

Note also a new version at https://github.com/shaunharker/CHomP.

The new version uses cmake so it would be difficult to make it a standard package... Though its mostly headers, maybe they just need to be installed.

This is missing the file `pkgs/chomp/type`, so I added it. I get some failing doctests, so maybe it should be `experimental` for now. It built for me, but I do have `cmake` installed on this machine (OS X).

There is a `cmake` experimental package now, you can depend on that.

"matrix_complex.pyx" is a misleading name: it sounds like it has to do with matrices over the complex numbers.

I was able to build this with #20754, so I'm setting that spkg as a dependency. I've also added boost to the dependencies file and added CMake as a dependency to the `SPKG.txt`.

Is this ready for review? If not, what more needs to be done?


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2016-11-14 22:54:43

Oh, I see. CHomP builds this way, but Sage's CHomP interface is broken.

A part of this breakage is that `homchain` is not installed---perhaps it's just gone in the new version?
