Approximately all modules cite Cohen's book. But each of them has its own reference!

In the main index, there is a section `Number Theory, Algebraic Geometry`. But many modules that you added are in `rings` (like `sage/rings/bernmm`, `sage/rings/bernoulli_mod_p`, `sage/rings/contfrac`, `sage/rings/factorint`, `sage/rings/fast_arith`).

I did some changes and cleaning in number fields. Tell me if you like. I can also try to reorganise the ring section.

I really would prefer to keep these improvements for another ticket, in order to keep the current  “add missing modules...” tickets independent of each other. It will be much easier to make changes that span several of them once all modules that need to appear in the reference manual appear somewhere!
