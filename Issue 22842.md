Keywords: genus, elliptic curve

Hello,

When creating an elliptic curve over a finite field the attribute _genus is not initialized.

eg:


```
E = EllipticCurve(GF(3), [0, -1, 0, -346, 2652])
E.genus()
...
AttributeError: 'EllipticCurve_finite_field_with_category' object has no attribute '_genus'
```



Cheers,
Edgar

I suggest adding a method genus() to EllipticCurve_field.  For curves over Q it works already but not over number fields, since the genus is actually begin computed somewhere.  This is silly since the EllipticCurve constructor already checks for nonsingularity so will never construct an object whose genus is not 1.

There are lots of missing "trivial" functions like this.  For example

```
sage: ZZ[I].class_number()
1
sage: ZZ.class_number()
...
AttributeError: 'sage.rings.integer_ring.IntegerRing_class' object has no attribute 'class_number'
```

I believe we just need to set  `self._genus = 1`  when constructing the elliptic curve.

I agree this is a trivial function, but there are methods inherited from hyperelliptic curves over finite fields that use the self.genus() call, for example, `self.frobenius_polynomial_matrix()`
