Little thing, in `combinat/sf/schur.py` we could change:

```diff
-                    zipped_beta_list = list(zip(beta_list, range(1, ns + 1)))
-                    zipped_beta_list.sort(key=lambda a: (- 1 - a[0]) % n)
+                    zipped_beta_list = sorted(zip(beta_list, range(1, ns + 1)),
+                                              key=lambda a: (- 1 - a[0]) % n)
```
If the patchbot comes back green, then positive review.
