Assignee: jason, was

Keywords: plot, CIF

I have a particular CIF (see values below) and calling `a.plot()` leads to an `IndexError`. For many other values, I did not encounter any problems.


```
sage: a=CIF(RIF(1.0760324885501113,1.0760324885504933),RIF(-1.9888595303771060e- 18, 1.9888595303771060e-18)) 
sage: a.plot()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
IndexError: index out of bounds
```
