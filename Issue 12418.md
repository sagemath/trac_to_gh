# Issue 12418: IndexError in CIF.plot()

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/12590

Assignee: jason, was

Keywords: plot, CIF

I have a particular CIF (see values below) and calling `a.plot()` leads to an `IndexError`. For many other values, I did not encounter any problems.


```
sage: a=CIF(RIF(1.0760324885501113,1.0760324885504933),RIF(-1.9888595303771060e- 18, 1.9888595303771060e-18)) 
sage: a.plot()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
IndexError: index out of bounds
```


This problem was reported by Clemens Heuberger on [sage-support](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/a83f0ea4caa215f3/de1b9d0f7200aba8).

Presuming these are all correctly reviewed as either duplicate, invalid, or wontfix.
