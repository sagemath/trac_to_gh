Follow-up from #32234.

After #32234, `sage.ext.fast_eval` only contains the function `fast_float`, a thin wrapper around `fast_callable`.

We deprecate this module and switch all uses of `fast_float` to direct calls to `fast_callable`.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32268
