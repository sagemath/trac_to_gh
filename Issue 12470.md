Just like #10499, http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/calc/ is broken again from sage:

sage: magma_free('2+3')
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
IndexError: list index out of range
```

That was interesting to see! As coded, it seemed a bit fragile. The replacement code should be less likely to throw errors. It will likely return junk when the site changes again, though.

Of course.  I noticed that there is an "interesting" typo in the code "resluts", i.e., "re - sluts". I've posted a referee patch that fixes that typo.
