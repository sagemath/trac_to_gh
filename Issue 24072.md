# Issue 24072: more characteristic for quotients

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: vdelecroix

Original creation time: 2017-11-30 20:03:30

Some quotients should be able to compute their characteristic

```
sage: kk.<a,b> = GF(2)[]
sage: k.<y,w> = kk.quo(a^2+a+1)
sage: k.characteristic()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NotImplementedError: 
```


See also #24308 that fixes a consequence of the above.
