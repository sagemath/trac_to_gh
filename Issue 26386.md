CC:  @novoselt

When working with graphs, we have a nice tab-completed list of common graphs that we can construct; for example,


```
sage: graphs.BuckyBall()
Bucky Ball: Graph on 60 vertices
```


More and more, I find myself wishing we had the same thing for convex cones, particularly in test cases. I have constructions for all of the following and use them regularly:

* The nonnegative orthant.
* The full ambient space.
* The schur cone that induces the majorization ordering.
* The permutation-invariant "rearrangement" cone.
* The trivial cone, since `trivial_cone(n)` looks a lot nicer than `Cone([], ToricLattice(n))`.

et cetera; I'm sure I can think of more. Each of these makes sense in any dimension `n`.

I'm wondering if you think this would be a useful feature to make available as e.g.


```
sage: cones.nonnegative_orthant(5)
5-d cone in 5-d lattice N
```


They should all probably take a "lattice" argument too now that I think about it.

They certainly should take a lattice argument! From a toric perspective it is probably more natural to have these as methods of lattices, i.e. something like

```
ToricLattice(n).trivial_cone()
```

although of course this makes it impossible to use `ZZ^n`. And perhaps even more natural is to have not cones, but associated toric varieties which are already available:

```
sage: toric_varieties.A(5).fan().generating_cone(0).rays()
N(1, 0, 0, 0, 0),
N(0, 1, 0, 0, 0),
N(0, 0, 1, 0, 0),
N(0, 0, 0, 1, 0),
N(0, 0, 0, 0, 1)
in 5-d lattice N

I think from a design standpoint, that's where the method belongs, but there are two things that bug me about it.

First: in many cases, the user won't care about the lattice and will want "the default." This is basically what happens when you do `ToricLattice(n).nonnegative_orthant()`, but it feels a little weird to specify a particular lattice when you don't care about it. By analogy, the `Cone()` function should also be a method on a `ToricLattice` object. A lot of the time you just don't care though, so it's nice to be able to get a sensible default without having to construct a generic lattice of the correct size first. On the other hand, I like that this eliminates the `n` and `lattice` parameters from the cone-creating functions. And it would ensure that (for example) if you only create one lattice object, then you can intersect any two cones created by methods on it. I'll have to think harder about this but it may be the way to go.

Second: tab completion on `graphs.<tab>` is so nice. Having a list of twenty or so cones interspersed in the tab-completion list for lattices would be bad for both people who want to see lattice methods and people who want to see predefined cones.

(Might we have something like `lattice.cones.<tab>` where `lattice` is some `ToricLattice`?)

My main objection to this is that I'm not smart enough to implement it or remember which cone is associated with which toric variety =)

Having the code above be the implementation for `nonnegative_orthant(5)` would be fine with me though.

I have another question. There are a few vector spaces associated with each cone, that can be thought of as cones themselves:

* The span of the cone K.
* Its orthogonal complement, (span(K))-perp.
* Its lineality space (the largest subspace it contains).

The span of the cone and its lineality space are already available as,


```
sage: K = Cone([(1,1),(0,1)])
sage: K.span()
Sublattice <N(1, 0), N(0, 1)>
sage: span(K)
Free module of degree 2 and rank 2 over Integer Ring
Echelon basis matrix:
[1 0]
[0 1]
sage: K.linear_subspace()
Vector space of degree 2 and dimension 0 over Rational Field
Basis matrix:
[]
```


But none of those return cones directly. Having a cone is handy when you want to compute e.g. the intersection of one of these things with some other cone.

If we were to add similar methods that return cones, how would you prefer to do it? We could either...

1. Add methods to the cones themselves, for things like `K.span_cone()`, `K.lineality_space()`, `K.orthogonal_complement()`
2. Add them as part of the new `cones.<whatever>` interface, with something like `cones.span_of(K)`.

The first one seems more correct to me, but risks polluting the namespace with a bunch of methods that all look the same but return different things.

The second one does make it obvious that you're going to get a cone back, but only if people know to look there for what should in principle be a method on the cone itself.

```

Option 3:

For the span and the orthogonal complement, we could sensibly add a `cone()` method somewhere in the module hierarchy, like


```
sage: K.orthogonal_sublattice().cone()
```


which would be a wrapper around


```
sage: Cone( c*g for g in K.orthogonal_sublattice().gens() for c in [-1, 1] )
```


The problem with that is, when starting from a cone and passing through a vector space, the lattice information is lost. If I start with a cone in a lattice `M`, take its `linear_subspace()`, and then turn it into cone...


```
sage: K = Cone([(1,0,0),(-1,0,0),(0,1,0)], ToricLattice(3,'M'))
sage: Cone(K.linear_subspace().gens())
1-d cone in 3-d lattice N
```


it should live in the same lattice as the original cone. I don't see how to fix that immediately.

Oof, it looks like I'm missing trac emails again.

It would just be nice to have the cone methods available on subspaces. For example, Corollary 1 in these notes,

http://michael.orlitzky.com/notes/on_z-operators_and_viability_theorems.pdf

is very easy to test as the intersection of a closed convex (dual) cone and a subspace. If span(x) is a cone, and if its orthogonal complement is a cone, then I can use the cone intersection method that we already have to test it.

Another example is the "maximal angle between two convex cones." This is a newish concept (from 2016), and I've implemented it as a method on cones. However, the "principal angle between subspaces" is a classical idea going back to the 1950s, and they turn out to be equivalent for cones that are subspaces. If subspaces can be treated as cones, then I can use the same method that I have on cones to compute principal angles between subspaces. And so on.

The reason `Cone(c.span())` "hangs" is because it carefully enumerates every element of the vector space.

I think there's plenty of work to do just to get the trivial cone, nonnegative orthant, and a few others implemented and documented. I'll focus on that and worry about the other questions later.

It would be more pleasant to provide only one input argument: either a number to get the cone in the default lattice of that dimension, or a lattice and get a cone in that lattice.

But that's exactly how `Cone()` works, and `Cone()` is the function that underlies all of these convenience methods.

The additional check is not strictly required; it serves only to provide a more relevant error message. For example, if I were to delete the check and then pass a lattice of the wrong rank to `Cone()`, I would get


```
sage: M = ToricLattice(2)
sage: Cone([(1,-1,0),(0,1,-1)], lattice=M)
...
TypeError: cannot convert (1, -1, 0) to Vector space of dimension 2 over Rational Field!

```


If you know the generators of (say) the Schur cone, then you might be able to figure out what that error message means. But, if you don't know what those generators are off the top of your head, then an error message complaining about converting `(1,-1,0)` to a rational vector space could be confusing. That said, I'm not too attached to the additional sanity check and error message, and would be happy to remove them.


> It would be more pleasant to provide only one input argument: either a number to get the cone in the default lattice of that dimension

I don't think this is workable, since in applications we often want to intersect the dual of some cone (which will live in a non-default lattice) with e.g. a nonnegative orthant.


> only one input argument...  a lattice, and get a cone in that lattice. 

This is the best API, but as a user-interface is pretty annoying to use. The "pass a lattice, but only if you don't want the default one" approach of `Cone()` is IMO a good compromise. Having to do e.g.


```
sage: cones.trivial(ToricLattice(3))
```


is even worse than


```
sage: Cone([], ToricLattice(3))
```


In the common case, the user is left wondering why he has to type `ToricLattice(n)` all the time instead of just `n`. The default is usually fine until you start doing complicated stuff.

Some minor comments.

- Your `INPUT` item all end with a period
- You describe twice (after `INPUT` and after `OUTPUT`), when errors are being raised.
- You misspelled `rearrangenent` at least once.
- Please provide doctests for `_preprocess_args`.
- `nonnegative_orthant`:
  - Can you be more precise with the reference?

```
+    REFERENCES:
+
+    - [BV2009]_
```

  -
- `rearrangement`:
  - `"rearrange,"` (comma in quotes)
  - again the references are rather unspecific except for `[Jeong2017]_` (is there any way to obtain `[Jeong2017]_`?)
  - I would formulate the statement exactly the other way around. I guess figuring out the Lyapunov rank of the nonnegative orthant or a halfspace is the easy part.

```
+    Jeong's Corollary 5.2.4 [Jeong2017]_ states that if ``p`` is
+    either one or ``ambient_dim``, then the Lyapunov rank of the
+    rearrangement cone in ``ambient_dim`` dimensions is
+    ``ambient_dim``. Moreover for all other values of ``p``, its
+    Lyapunov rank is one::
```

- Isn't this clear from the definition anyway?

```
+    Jeong's Proposition 5.2.1 [Jeong2017]_ states that the rearrangenent
+    cone of order ``p`` is contained in the rearrangement cone of
+    order ``p + 1``::
```

    So maybe just the following would suffice

```
+    The rearrangement cone of order ``p`` is
+    by definition contained in the one of order ``p + 1``::
```

  -

```
+    The generators for the rearrangement cone are given by [Jeong2017]_
+    Theorem 5.2.3.
```

    Maybe it's more useful for the reader to specify the generators concretely here.
- `schur`
  - Please provide a definition.
  - Again the references would be more helpful with concrete information (such as sections etc.)

A few comments for now.

- I would suggest using commas here:

```diff
+globally-available ``cones`` prefix, to create some common cones:
+
+- The nonnegative orthant,
+- the rearrangement cone of order ``p``,
+- the Schur cone,
+- the trivial cone.
-   globally-available ``cones`` prefix, to create some common cones:
-
-- The nonnegative orthant
-- The rearrangement cone of order ``p``
-- The Schur cone
-- The trivial cone
```

- The warning at the beginning should include mentioning, that any import will be imported at startup.
- If you lazy import `Cone` and `random_cone` than the bots will be fine with the number of startup modules. Also this should be done anyway, shouldn't it?

Thanks, I added the commas, and expanded the warning at the beginning of the module.

As for the bots: I don't think they're complaining about `Cone` or `random_cone`:

1. Both of those are loaded by `sage.geometry.all` anyway.

2. Those import statements aren't executed until you run one of the functions in the `cone_catalog` module, so importing them is essentially "lazy" even if you're using sage as a library and not interactively.

Instead, I think the bots are pointing out that `sage.geometry.cone_catalog` is now loaded into the global namespace as `cones`, but that's almost unavoidable since that's the whole point. However, it is indeed slower than the lazy import of the class was, should you decide not to use it.

There may be some clever way to delay even *that* import, while still retaining the name "cones" along with its tab-completion list. For example, if I give a top-level variable name to the module, and then import that object lazily... e.g. this seems to work in cone_catalog.py


```
import sys

# A python object that can be imported lazily with lazy_import(...).
cones = sys.modules[__name__]

def __dir__():
    # Don't expose any global imports or variables to tab-completion.
    return ['nonnegative_orthant',
            'rearrangement',
            'schur',
            'trivial']
```


if I then do


```
lazy_import('sage.geometry.cone_catalog', 'cones')
```


in sage/geometry/all.py. But that's veering dangerously close to "too clever" to save a few microseconds in my opinion.

This is actually the documented way to get sphinx to create an "em" dash in the HTML output. It's displaying correctly for me in the built docs.

Clever =)

But, the extra imports are "free", so I don't think it's worth changing them around again at this point.

You are right... `ToricLattice` isn't a class.


> - I think we are supposed to use double quotation marks for error messages:

Is that written down anywhere (for my future reference)? I don't care either way, I changed them to double quotes.


> - Missing semicolons:

Hmm.. someone has updated the developer's guide without fixing the existing docstrings or mentioning it to anyone. I tried to conform to the new examples in the guide.

This one works!

Other languages/projects have a standard location to document the exceptions that can be raised, but as far as I know, we don't. We probably should. I think it's nice to mention that a function *can* fail in the OUTPUT docs, just to be on the safe side in case the user skips the INPUT docs. But to me it feels like the relationship between the inputs belongs in the INPUT block. My mind could be changed on this, if everyone could agree to do it consistently.

Added spacing throughout.

Thanks, I don't like that the function would silently return nonsense if you pass in e.g. `p=1.5` I've added another error check to that cone.
