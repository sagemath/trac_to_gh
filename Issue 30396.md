Could you check your sympows as follows:

```
$ sympow -curve [1,-1,0,-79,289] -analrank
$ sympow -curve [0,1,1,-2,0] -analrank
```


I believe the 2nd test, but not the 1st, should crash on your system sympow 1.023.

If so, we can add this test to the one we already do on #30147.

you cannot in general just cut and paste from an m4 file into a shell. m4 files are preprocessed by autoconf, into ./configure (in m4 `[` and `]` have special meanining,
so they have to replaced by ``@`<:`@`` and ``@`:>`@``, respectively). In the latter you can see

```
      { $as_echo "$as_me:${as_lineno-$LINENO}: checking whether sympow works well (cf. :trac:30147)" >&5
$as_echo_n "checking whether sympow works well (cf. :trac:30147)... " >&6; }
      sympow_rank_test=`echo "[1,-1,0,-79,289]" | sympow -analrank | grep ^"Analytic Rank is 4"`
      if test x"$sympow_rank_test" = x; then :

          { $as_echo "$as_me:${as_lineno-$LINENO}: result: no; cannot use system sympow" >&5
$as_echo "no; cannot use system sympow" >&6; }
          sage_spkg_install_sympow=yes

```


Could you check the output of this in `config.log`. If the test succeeds, one should get something like

```
configure:32210: checking whether sympow works well (cf. :trac:30147)
configure:32221: result: yes; use system sympow
```

there (line numbers might differ)

oups, ok, I see.

On the machine running Ubuntu 18.04, I did
`make sympow-clean`
to remove the sage spkg I installed earlier. Then, I did `./configure`. Then


```
$ grep sympow config.log
## Checking whether SageMath should install SPKG sympow... ##

configure:32569: result: yes; use system sympow
configure:32579: will use system package and not install SPKG sympow
configure:38100: result: sympow-2.023.6:                              using system package; SPKG will not be installed

$ /usr/bin/sympow -version

so it seems that sympow version 1.023 is passing the test, whereas it should not.

> so it seems that sympow version 1.023 is passing the test, whereas it should not.

In fact, sympow 1.023 does pass the test written with the "echo" way:


```

Why not try it and see?  BTW, I definitely identified a bug, so if this isn't the cause of this particular problem, it will likely cause someone else problems down the road.

Okay, so maybe it should be part of another ticket, since the bug described in the current ticket is already fixed by the proposed branch.

see #12858, more precisely 
https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/12858#comment:16
I gather this is Debian "upstream", with this bug still in.
 
I agree that this is an upstream bug, and the problem is to identify the upstream...

There is no branch I know of that contains this patch.  You will either have to hack the source code yourself, or wait until someone else puts it into a branch.

It looks like another fix was committed a while ago.  While the other fix wasn't technically correct, it should nevertheless have solved this issue.  So most likely this won't fix your particular problem.  Sorry.

I've proposed your change to upstream in https://gitlab.com/rezozer/forks/sympow/-/merge_requests/4

So it will eventually be fixed.
