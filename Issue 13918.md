Some remarks:
* Returns the De Bruijn diraph with parameters `k,n`. -> Returns the De Bruijn digraph with parameters `k,n`.
* in both functions, the statement `g = DiGraph()` should be after the test on n
* Returns a tournament `n` vertices.  -> Returns a tournament on `n` vertices.   (twice in patch)
* for i in range(n) -> for i in range(n-1)
* d = {i:(i,0) for i in range(n)} \\
  g.set_pos(d)\\
  -> `g.set_pos( {i:(i,0) for i in range(n)} )`
