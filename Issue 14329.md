Keywords: braid group, plot

Currently, when plotting a braid, all the strands are in the same color. For `plot3d()`, even choosing a different color is unavailable.

The attached patch adds the ability to give each strand a different color. This is done for `plot()` and `plot3d()`.

Few notes:
* I changed the default coloring scheme, so instead of blue strands, the braids are in different colors.
* The color option can be one of: single color, which is backwards-compatible; "rainbow", the default; A list or a tuple of colors.
* Some of the plot options are "global" for the entire plot (e.g. aspect ratio and axes), but some should be "local" for a specific strand (e.g. color, thickness or alpha). Maybe there should be another ticket for this, as I just needed different colored strands.
* When testing if the `color` is a list or a tuple I used the idiom `isinstance(color, (list, tuple))` which is of prevalent use in Sage. Should we use `isinstance(color, collections.Sequence)` instead, with the downside that we need to check `isinstance(color, types.StringTypes)` first?

Two examples:

```
B6.<a,b,c,d,e> = BraidGroup(6)
z = a^-1*b*c^3*e^-2*a*b^2*a^-3*d^5*c*a*b*c*d*e^2*d^-1*c^-1*b^-1*a^-1
bp1 = z.plot(orientation="left-right")
```

```
from sage.plot import colors
B3.<f,g> = BraidGroup(3)
z2 = g^-1*f^2
bp2 = z2.plot(orientation="top-bottom",
            thickness=4,
            color=[colors.red.lighter(), colors.red, colors.red.darker()])
```

Thanks for your review. I had a trivial whitespace nitpick I added in [attachment:trac_14533_braid2.patch]. I think it's OK now.

This is new to me; Who should set the review status now?
