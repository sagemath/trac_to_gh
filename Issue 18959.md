# Issue 18959: LatticePoset: add is_dismantlable()

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19196

Original creator: jmantysalo

CC:  kdilks chapoton

Add `is_dismantlable()`, maybe with `certificate` -option, to `LatticePoset`.

Wait until #19191 gets reviewed, and then crosslink them at #19190, and add to index of functions.

Changing status from new to needs_review.

Here it is. This seems to be quite fast, but I am sure that `H.is_connected()` can be changed to some digraph function checking if `upper` is reachable from `lower`. Optimization can be made later, so I mark this as _needs_review_.

Everything seems to be already done in graphs... I CC Nathann because I just noticed at #19118 the function


```
g.subgraph(vertices=g.cores(k=2)[1])
```


So propably there is some very easy way to make this.

Forget. Sorry for the noice.

(Even if `.cores()` does kind of similar thing, it is not actually useful here. So back to original algorithm and back to needs_review.)

Hmm... If a lattice is _not_ dismantlable, then it contains a "crown". Should `certificate` return it?

Needs merge, but I'll wait #19123 to be accepted (or rejected) first.

As #19123 is stalled, I merged this. Maybe I got at least some code into next release.

​​​Frédéric? Someone? This is quite easy one.

Would be nice if at 2016-01-07 I could say that this will be at Sage version 6.10. I will mention dismantlable lattices then in a little talk.

ok, good to go. I have put the code into pep8 standard.

If you approve my small changes, you can set to positive review.

By the way, please avoid the final underscores in your branch names, as it makes rather hard to copy/paste. Better to keep the branch names short and simple, I would say.

I did, and also put your name to reviewer field.

That this was generated name from `git trac`, I guess. I will try to use better names from now on. And maybe some day I will remember to use PEP 8 standard...

Thanks - for this, and for many other reviews.
