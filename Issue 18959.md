CC:  kdilks chapoton

Add `is_dismantlable()`, maybe with `certificate` -option, to `LatticePoset`.

Wait until #19191 gets reviewed, and then crosslink them at #19190, and add to index of functions.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19196

Here it is. This seems to be quite fast, but I am sure that `H.is_connected()` can be changed to some digraph function checking if `upper` is reachable from `lower`. Optimization can be made later, so I mark this as *needs_review*.
