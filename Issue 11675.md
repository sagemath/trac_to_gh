Keywords: degree, polynomial, singular

Singular assumes the standard grading when predefined orderings such as `lex` and `degrevlex` are given, but infers a grading of a ring from the first row of a specified matrix ordering. This can confuse users (and has confused some developers!) who expect to work in a standard grading, and will not expect this behavior:

```
sage: R.<x,y,z> = PolynomialRing(QQ,'x',3,order=TermOrder(matrix([3,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0])))
sage: (x^2*y).degree()
6
sage: x.degree()
3
sage: x.degree(x)
1
```

This confusion is compounded by the fact that the term *degree* carries different meanings, depending on the context (degree wrt grading, degree wrt exponents, degree of a monomial, degree of a variable).

Sage has an `exponents()` command that behaves somewhat closer to what a user unfamiliar with graded rings might expect:

```
sage: (x^2*y).exponents()
[(2,1,0)]
```


The documentation should inform users of this behavior. It would also be nice to add a function that computes the total degree wrt the standard grading for the user.

This patch adds a note and a test to `degree()` to inform the user of the behavior. It also adds a new function, `total_degree_ungraded()`, which returns the total degree without respect to a grading. Doctests pass for me on sage 4.7.2alpha2.

> I don't see natural use cases for total_degree_ungraded() when one use non-default grading with a polynomial ring.

I discovered the problem when the grading changed while working with a matrix term ordering. It appears whenever one uses a matrix ordering, and `total_degree()` is not an uncommon tool.

> The name is also confusing.

One goal was that the user find it easily when performing tab-completion, **and** would see that there are two different notions of *total degree* in play, prompting her or him to read the docstring. With that in mind, I aimed for a name that would be clear. It slipped from my mind that the ring is never ungraded, so I agree that this is a very, very bad name.

I had toyed with `total_degree_exponents()` as well. I could see `exponent_total_degree()`, but thought that harder for a user to find using tab-completion.

> On the other hand, exponent(x) method, which Maarten suggested, would be useful and essential.

Actually, I suggested that name. :-) Maarten didn't suggest a particular name, but that there should be a different set of functions for ungraded degree. I originally set out to do as you suggest, but as I thought about it, several considerations presented themselves:

1. The method `degree(x)` already exists, and does the same.
2. It seems unwise to deprecate `degree(x)`, which is probably used in a lot of code by a lot of people. (*I've* used it a lot, anyway.)
3. The patch could leave `degree(x)` alone, and introduce `exponent(x)` (or whatever name) which merely replicates the behavior. I'm not opposed to that, but I wanted someone else's input first. I recall there was discussion of a similar duplication of methods in linear algebra some years ago (see e.g. `eigenvectors_right` and `right_eigenvectors`).
4. I'd *prefer* to change `degree()` to behave as if the ring had the standard grading, and define `degree_in_grading()` (or something similar) to behave the way Singular defines it. Again, that could have an impact on how people have already been using `degree()` in code.

These thoughts prompted me to start with an incremental patch initially, which could be modified according to comments.

> Moreover you can make exponent() to return the sum of all exponents of the variables in the monomial, making total_degree_ungraded() redundant.

**That** would be confusing to me; I've never seen *total degree* referred to as *exponent*. I would prefer a different name if we take that route, such as `exponent_total_degree()` or `total_degree_exponents()`. Or even something clearer.

I would never change the behavior of degree(),degrees(),total_degree(), which should return the standard things as Simon said, except of course bug fixes.

For exponent(), exponents(), total_exponents(), I would expect

```
sage: f=x^3+x*y+1
sage: f.exponent(x)
[3,1,1]
sage: f.exponents()
[(3,0),(1,1),(0,0)]
sage: f.total_exponent()
[3,2,0]
sage: f.exponent()
[3,2,0]
sage: g=x*y
sage: g.exponent(x) % convenient behavior for a monomial
1
sage: g.exponents()
(1,1)
sage: g.total_exponent()
2
sage: g.exponent()
2
```


Then even in a polynomial ring with the default grading, the two sets of methods will play different roles.

I would object names mixing "degree" and "exponent" in any way.

We could also add a keyword "use_grading" to the degree methods.

Note that whathever we do, we should not do the combination of:


```
sage: f.exponent(x)
[3,1,1]
sage: g.exponent(x) % convenient behavior for a monomial

```


Such a function will be very hard to use since this behaviour will make you write ugly code like:



```
deg = f.exponent()
if f.is_monomial():
    do_something(f)
else:
    do_something_else(f)

Simon would think the "use_grading" keyword redundant because degree methods must always use grading. Perhaps keyword "use_default_grading" is more sensible. Anyway, using a long keyword is an overkill.

I think degee methods are for polynomials while exponent methods are for monomials. So it should be more convenient to use exponent methods with monomials. It would even be reasonable to raise an error if f is not a monomial in f.exponents(), though I admit the current behavior 

```
sage: f=x^3+x*y
sage: f.exponents()
[(3,0),(1,1)]
```

is surely a convenient extension, if used carefully.

Using a keyword is a great idea. What about calling it `standard_grading` or (if that's too long) `std_grading`? For reasons of compatibility, the default would be `False`; when `True`, it uses the standard grading to compute `degree()` and `total_degree()`.

There's a strong case to be made for using monomials (efficiency, for example) but I also think that's a separate discussion, for a separate ticket. AFAIK Singular doesn't distinguish the two.

> So it should be more convenient to use exponent methods with monomials. It would even be reasonable to raise an error if f is not a monomial in f.exponents()...

I would prefer not to deprecate old ways of doing things unless they were actually wrong or demonstrably dangerous. I don't think that's the case here, but maybe I'm wrong.

I think the implementation is fine (i.e., I read the patch) so for me all that is needed is to check the formalities (applies, tests pass, docs look okay, etc.)

I was unaware that 4.8.alpha1 was out... have to pay better attention to `sage-devel`.

IIRC, I checked that box only because Simon had mentioned that someone could discuss this behavior with the Singular developers at the then-upcoming Sage days; see the discussion at

    http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/fc6959dc18d6cda1/

I don't know if anyone actually talked about it with them, though -- Simon didn't seem perturbed. As far as I can tell, the bug (if any) was in our documentation, not theirs. Given that this assertion was controversial, I classified this as "an enhancement".

If you think it's okay, I'd prefer removing the "report upstream", and change it to "None of the above; see trac for reasoning". I've done that already, so change it back if you think that's inappropriate.

Yes, and I did talk with people there. So, it is reported upstream. If I remember correctly, the Singular folks somehow agreed that it would be nice to have, but on the other hand it didn't seem easy to them to implement it, given their data structure.

So, I don't think that if it will soon be fixed/enhanced/whatever in upstream.
