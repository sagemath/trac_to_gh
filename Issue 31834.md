While working on #32069, I got these errors triggered by `pip install`:

```
[jupyterlab] sagemath-standard 9.4b3 requires scipy<1.6,>=1.5, but you have scipy 1.6.3 which is incompatible.
[jupyterlab] sagemath-standard 9.4b3 requires sphinx<3.3,>=3, but you have sphinx 4.0.1 which is incompatible.
[jupyterlab] sagemath-standard 9.4b3 requires sympy<1.8,>=1.6, but you have sympy 1.8 which is incompatible.
```

The upgrade tickets #31647, #31696, #31008 forgot to update the version ranges. We fix it in this ticket.
