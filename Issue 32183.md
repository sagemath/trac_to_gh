sympy 1.9 will include a change to `heaviside` (https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/21452), defining it at 0.

Question: Will this require changes on our side (other than adjusting doctest output - waiting for possible printing changes in sympy https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/21945)?

The sympy 1.9 release is imminent

The change to `heaviside` in sympy is also being discussed in https://groups.google.com/g/sympy/c/54iwY7KxlMA/m/lX-RlDfjBQAJ

The Heaviside printing issue in SymPy has been resolved and the printing change was reverted in SymPy master and the 1.9 release branch:

I've opened #32564 for the more general issue of expression conversions involving `heaviside(0)`
