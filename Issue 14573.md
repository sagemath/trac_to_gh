Hey Austin,

There are two minor things I see:

- Line 16803 should be:
  {{{
  Ensure that :trac:`14777` is is fixed::
  }}}
  in order for the autolinking to work.

- Line 16812 should be:
  {{{
  if self.num_verts() == 0 and other.num_verts() == 0:
  }}}
  there was a second `=` missing from the second part.

Once these are fixed, this should be a positive review.
