There should at least be a comment that (building) CVXOPT does **not** depend on matplotlib; if upstream fixes the tests (e.g. by skipping some in case matplotlib is not [yet] available), this dependency should get removed again.

Also CVXOPT's `SPKG.txt` should get updated accordingly (*"Dependencies"* and *"Special Update/Build Instructions"* sections).

See #12784 for a trivial-to-review followup.

Adding a comment to cvxopt's SPKG.txt should perhaps also be done. The same could be said for sagetex's SPKG.txt, which doesn't explain that testing the package will fail unless basically all of Sage is installed first. Someone else can deal with those.

I don't think there is anything to be "fixed" upstream.
