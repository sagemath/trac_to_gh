The `LazyImport` objects suffer several problems

1. `copy` and `deepcopy` are broken

```
sage: from sage.misc.lazy_import import LazyImport
sage: sage.all.foo = [1, 2]
sage: lazy_foo = LazyImport('sage.all', 'foo')
sage: a = copy(lazy_foo)
sage: a
[1, 2]
sage: a[0] = 18
sage: a
[18, 2]
```


2. Most doctests use `lazy_import` rather than `LazyImport`. The former modifies the namespace so that the name actually points to the object afterwards. Compare

```
sage: lazy_import('sage.rings.all', 'ZZ', 'lazy_ZZ')
sage: type(lazy_ZZ)
<class 'sage.misc.lazy_import.LazyImport'>
sage: _ = lazy_ZZ(3)
sage: type(lazy_ZZ)
<class 'sage.rings.integer_ring.IntegerRing_class'>
```

    with

```
sage: from sage.misc.lazy_import import LazyImport
sage: lazy_ZZ = LazyImport('sage.rings.all', 'ZZ')
sage: _ = lazy_ZZ(3)
3
sage: type(lazy_ZZ)
<class 'sage.misc.lazy_import.LazyImport'>
```

    In the former version, any code that uses more than once the lazy object actually uses it only once.

3. Calling `__module__` triggers `get_object` whereas we could return what is contained in the `_module` attribute. This would solve #31643 but it is likely to be a bad idea as the module from which an object is imported is not necessarily the module in which it is defined.

I don't see why all those doctests need to be `assert`. If they fail, they just give a longer traceback with no meaningful information.

They don't need to. It is just more condensed.

What do you mean by traceback? I don't understand your point.

> Also, I don't understand what point 2 is trying to make.

That the following doctest was not testing `LazyImport`

```
sage: lazy_import('sage.all', 'foo')
sage: type(foo)
<type 'sage.misc.lazy_import.LazyImport'>
sage: del foo[1]  # still lazy
sage: print(foo)  # not lazy anymore
```

I agree that this was not a problem in the doctests.

However, they output too much when they do fail (see below), they obscure (very) slightly that the test should be `True`, and the `assert` tests could (in principle) be disabled as they are meant for serious errors during debugging.

> What do you mean by traceback? I don't understand your point.

You get something like this:

```
File "partition.py", line 7, in sage.combinat.partition
Failed example:
    assert False
Exception raised:
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/home/uqtscrim/sage/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/sage/doctest/forker.py", line 714, in _run
        self.compile_and_execute(example, compiler, test.globs)
      File "/home/uqtscrim/sage/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/sage/doctest/forker.py", line 1133, in compile_and_execute
        exec(compiled, globs)
      File "<doctest sage.combinat.partition[0]>", line 1, in <module>
        assert False
    AssertionError
```

which is a lot of noise for something that is not `True`.
(I just add this to the start of `partition.py`:

```
EXAMPLES::

    sage: assert False
```


Because of these points, I think they should follow the standard doctest practice of checking against output.

I see. Thank you for the explanation.
