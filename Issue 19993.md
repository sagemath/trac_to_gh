# Issue 19993: Rational -> long should truncate instead of floor

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20230

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2016-03-18 09:16:58

This should be made consistent:

```
sage: long(-13/7)
-2L
sage: long(float(-13/7))
-1L
```
