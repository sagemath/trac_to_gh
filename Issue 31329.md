we modified the if condition so that it doesn't throw an error when working with dynamical systems over function field, the actual code of the function is not changed(except the if condition) because it works on dynamical systems over function field

Why are you checking the base ring and not the ring `R`?

Yes, you should be checking R to save an extra call of .base-ring()

You also need to add at least one example.

Changing component from algebra to dynamics.

Merge conflict on the latest release.

Also, the example should include a t, so that the map is properly defined over the function field.

The latest release also throws an unnecessary ValueError when minimal=False over function fields. This can be fixed in this ticket or a separate ticket.
