Keywords: combinatorial polyhedron, cone, lattice polytope

#28743 and #28766 implemented the incidence matrix for lattice polytopes and cones.

We use the incidence matrix to
- accept a cone as input of `CombinatorialPolyhedron`,
- process a lattice polytope as input more easily.

In both cases the `CombinatorialPolyhedron` can be obtained without previously calculating the face lattice (avoiding the method `facets`).
