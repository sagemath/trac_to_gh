Some points that needs enhancement :

 * correct typos in the doc :

   * missing space before k=1Â 
   * there is a 'gives' at the end of first sentence
   * give more precise reference (journal, etc)
   * say that default value of k is 1

 * change name of procedure to something more descriptive

Well, the bot is happy at last.. The doc does not look quite good, but I am not able to correct it. If somebody there is able to check that, this would be nice.

Ok, I have taken care of the doc. I will give a positive review when the bot turns alive and green again.
