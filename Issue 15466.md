This is a follow up to: #9290.

Refactor CoxeterMatrixGroup and WeylGroup to make the later a subclass of the former, and lift as many features as possible from WeylGroup to CoxeterMatrixGroup. This includes:
- Building the matrices from a root lattice realization
- Implementing the following methods:
  {{{
  sage: W = CoxeterGroup(['H',3])
  sage: W.domain()
  }}}

As a prerequisite, implement root spaces and weight spaces for non-crystallographic Coxeter groups.

Sage Days 47 in Cernay will be a good occasion to work on this.

I believe I'm taking care of the inner product on the root space in #15384 (which I  called `symmetric_form()`). Also for a followup ticket, we should implement/refactor things for symmetrizable and the non-symmetrizable types (for when we get the hyperbolic types done).

Very good!

Just a small suggestion: I would call the function "bilinear_form". Although it is true that we deal with symmetric forms so far...

I adapted the TODO list in relation with the latest changes I just pushed. The script joined allows you to create the pictures and do some tests...

Now we have to work!!
