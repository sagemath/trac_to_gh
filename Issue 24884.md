CC:  @seblabbe @nthiery

graphviz color format should be one of the following
- HSV triple such as `".08396, 0.4862,0.8549"`
- RBG triple such as `#DA70D6`
- name such as `orchid`
As a consequence the following is broken

```
sage: G = Graph([(0,1)])
sage: G.set_latex_options(edge_colors={(0,1): (0.3, 0.9, 0.0)})
sage: view(G)
```

To make it coherent with matplotlib options as in

```
sage: plot(x, color=(0.3, 0.9, 0))
```

we convert 3-tuples in RGB format using the `to_hex` function from matplotlib.

```

Why do you do this?

```
+to_hex = None   # overriden when needed in graphviz_string
```


to gain some time at start up?

```
sage: %time from matplotlib.colors import to_hex
CPU times: user 60 ms, sys: 12 ms, total: 72 ms
Wall time: 70.7 ms
```


Then why not lazy import it?
