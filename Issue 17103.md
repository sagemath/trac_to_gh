# Issue 17103: can't plot immutable graphs

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: kcrisman

Original creation time: 2014-11-13 19:50:52


```
sage: sage: Graph({0:[0]},immutable=False).show()
NotImplementedError: An immutable graph does not change name
```

Apparently the code for plotting makes some graph that is supposed to be a copy of it, but then with a new name, which is verboten.
