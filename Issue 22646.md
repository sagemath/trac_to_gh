We implement the Lie algebra (co)homology for finite dimensional Lie algebras by constructing the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex.

The doc of ChainComplex ( http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/homology/sage/homology/chain_complex.html ) says that the syntax you're invoking ChainComplex with ("a list/tuple/iterable of the form [d0,d1,d2,...] where each di is a matrix") only makes sense if degree is 1; but your degree is -1. Are you sure that this is legit? (I don't know ChainComplex well, so this is just a question.)

The doc for cohomology uses left g-modules, whereas you have defined the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex for right g-modules. Of course, g being a Lie algebra, there is a 1-to-1 correspondence between those, but signs may get messed up. This is not a problem when the module is trivial, but it's worth checking that we aren't making something that will be a pain to deprecate.

Another reference: 10.1.3--10.1.6 of Loday's Cyclic Homology. He uses the opposite signs, though. Convention differences?

The module case is waiting for a framework for Lie algebra modules, or do we have that already?

Apart from my previous comments, by the way, the patch is fine with me.

PS. Do you know of an example where the Betti numbers aren't symmetric around the middle? I'm a bit paranoid about the degree; such an example would help ensure that we aren't secretly computing the dual complex and getting our homology and cohomology mixed up...

Do not use .iteritems, please (for python3 compatibility).

I am not doing that. `chain_data` is a `dict`.

Of course, g being a Lie algebra, there is a 1-to-1 correspondence between those, but signs may get messed up. This is not a problem when the module is trivial, but it's worth checking that we aren't making something that will be a pain to deprecate.

Since we do not currently support anything but the trivial module, this won't be a problem to change at a later point. However, there is a slight technical issue of left vs. right in that the _co_homology should be a left *g*-module, but the homology is a right *g*-module. This would be something that would eventually be taken care of when general coefficient modules are implemented.

I added options to compute using sparse matrices (as I believe the matrices for the chain complex will generally be sparse) and to do the differential computation in parallel.

Convention difference. The differential can always be multiplied by any (invertible) scalar as `d(d(ax)) = d(a(dx)) = a d(d(x)) = 0` and scaling by a constant is homotopic to the identity map on chain complex (i.e., the resulting homology groups are isomorphic).

I do not, but I will try to construct such an example.

That is for a `vector` instance (and not a `dict`), so it is a well-defined method (for now).

Green patchbot.

`@`darij I could not construct an example that was not symmetric. However, I think we are okay. The left/right difference comes from the fact that we should be taking a dual module, but we don't see that for the trivial representation. So the care will have to be taken when that implementation is done, but I don't think we have to (or even can) worry about that here.

From https://mathoverflow.net/questions/184590/poincare-duality-for-cohomology-of-lie-algebras, a 2-dimensional Lie algebra for which the integral betti numbers do not satisfy `\beta_k = \beta_{2-k}`:

```
sage: d = {('x', 'y'): {'y': 2}}
sage: L.<x,y> = LieAlgebra(ZZ, d)
sage: L.cohomology()
{0: Z, 1: Z, 2: C2}
```

I've added John's example from comment:18 (and its homology).
