# Issue 30596: sage.env._get_shared_lib_filename: Fix for MULTIARCH

(from #30371)

On distributions that use the multiarch installation scheme, python provides the `MULTIARCH` sysconfig variable. 

We modify `sage.env._get_shared_lib_filename` to use it.
(Currently it tries to use `MULTILIB`.)

The code using `MULTILIB` was introduced in #27230.

As noted in #27230, another version of this code is in `find_library` in `src/sage/misc/compat.py`, which claims to provide better platform compatibility compared to `ctypes.util.find_library` (on Cygwin and macOS). It should be checked whether this code (introduced in 2017, for Python 2.7) is still necessary.

I have a few questions:
1. Should `MULTILIB` still be used?
2. If yes, what's the correct way to use it? In https://github.com/sagemath/sage/commit/edfb14de609040b990546bd07331add3bb0711fc the behavior was changed: before it was appended to `usr/lib` but after this commit it is appended to `SAGE_LOCAL/lib`. Was this change on purpose?

On a quick search, I have not found any evidence for the existence of the `MULTILIB` variable, and on the ticket where it was introduced there is no discussion of testing on any specific multiarch platforms. My guess is that this was never working. Let's get rid of it and then just test it on our supported platforms.

Too many changes on one ticket - interface, implementation, ... 

This places an unnecessary burden on reviewers.

Also, it seems that this ticket tries to establish a new convention `get_...` for things in `sage.env`, including a new function `get_sage_local`. 

As I said on another ticket - we already have a place for more structured access to system information - that's `sage.feature`.  Please don't create another place in `sage.env`

I'm sorry that the changes are bigger. However, I mostly rewrote the `_get_shared_lib_filename` method, and the other changes are only a consequence of these changes. For example, the new implementation returns only a path that exists, so the additional check in `singular.pyx` is no longer necessary. I honestly don't know how I can split this ticket into smaller pieces.

For the `get` functions, do you suggest to go back to the variable approach? My reason for the get functions was that this access the file path, and thus having getter functions potentially leads to better startup time (e.g. if you don't initialize singular). If you prefer I can of course revert to using variables. For `get_sage_local`, that was only a minor refactoring since I used it in multiple places. I can make it a private function if desired.

Replying to [comment:9 gh-tobiasdiez]:
> My reason for the get functions was that this access the file path, and thus having getter functions potentially leads to better startup time (e.g. if you don't initialize singular).

That's a concern that is orthogonal to this ticket, so please don't do it on this ticket.

I've now extracted some of the changes to #30901, so that this ticket is now only about the change of interface from variables to methods.
