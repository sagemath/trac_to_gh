Full log attached, testsuite errors start with:

```
make  check-TESTS

This is with our own gcc, it works with clang.

Any chance this will be fixed by #17214? (I can't test it on an OSX 10.10 machine right now.)

No, same with gsl-1.16 (see comment:1)

Can reproduce failure on Linux x86_64 with `CFLAGS='-O2 -fPIC -mtune=corei7'`

I see the same failure on OSX 10.9 (with Sage 6.4.rc1, and probably with any version with gcc 4.9.x).

This works on three different OS X machines. I haven't tested it on other architectures, but since it's an upstream patch, I think that's good enough.
