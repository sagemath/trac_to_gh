Merge conflict.

I also need to go through it again and check I respected the design decision in #29935.

This looks good to me. I have fixed one more test of a property which, according to its documentation, only holds for `k>=3`.

We could also remove the calls of `set_random_seed(1337)` in `lwe.py`, though either way is fine with me. You can set a positive review on my behalf.

Thank you.

I think we should remove those `set_random_seed`'s as a follow up to #29935.

Ok, that sounds good to me.
