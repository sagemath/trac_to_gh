# Issue 26612: Unit groups for p-adic fields

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/26849

Original creator: roed

Original creation time: 2018-12-06 20:37:00

Features include

* Finding generators and orders (both overall and modulo p^n) for the unit group
* Expressing arbitrary elements in terms of the generators and relations
* Working with subgroups (as a step toward constructive local class field theory).  In particular, the input required for some of Monge's algorithms are maps to Fp vector spaces that define the subgroup.
