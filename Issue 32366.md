The pytest does not go through for me, but it's possible that my installation is messed up

I think the issue was that symengine_py was not rebuilt. I've bumped the version to trigger a rebuild

The issue persists. The reason is that the doctest look at files in `$SAGE_ROOT/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/symengine/tests/` but when Sage tests a spkg, it only installs the spkg AFTER the test succeeds. So, if you install the spkg first and then install/test the spkg, currently what is tested is the previous installation.

So, changing package version may not fix the issue. In `spkg-check.in`, we should ask the testing framework to test files in `$SAGE_ROOT/local/var/tmp/sage/build/symengine_py-0.8.1/src/symengine/tests` not in `$SAGE_ROOT/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/symengine/tests/`

By the way, looking at `symengine.py-0.8.1/bin/test_travis.sh` (in the tarball), it seems that tests from `pytest` and tests from `test_python.py` are not the same (both are run one after the other), so we should perhaps test both.

Not really. They check that the tests run fine on inplace builds and on installed symengine.
Since sage is not doing inplace builds, it doesn't matter.

Thanks for the info. I'll try to fix this.

At this point where is symengine_py installed to?

That's not true. Take a look at `build/bin/sage-spkg`: `spkg-check` is run after the staged installation has been copied to the final installation directory.

(Also note that since #32361, Python packages are not actually staged using `SAGE_DESTDIR` any more. We just build and then install a wheel. This happens before running `spkg-check`.)

I'm confused as to how the issue mentioned by `@`tmonteil happens then.


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2021-10-03 18:28:07

In #32595 I am currently running portability testing on GH Actions, including this ticket. We'll see if these tests can reproduce the issue.

This has run successfully on https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/actions/runs/1298853742; so I am setting this to positive review
