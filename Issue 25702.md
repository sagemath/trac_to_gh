# Issue 25702: error in Well's algorithm for canonical height

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: bhutz

Original creation time: 2018-07-26 16:48:19

The following example fails


```
sage: P.<x,y>=ProjectiveSpace(QQ,1)
sage: f=DynamicalSystem([2*( -2*x^3 + 3*(x^2*y)) + c*y^3,3*y^3])
sage: f.canonical_height(P(1,0))
```

The issue appears to be that the resultant is check to be > 1, as opposed to absolute value > 1, so the loop is never entered.
