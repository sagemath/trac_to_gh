```
sage: SR0 = SR.subring(no_variables=True)                                                                                                                               
sage: SR0                                                                                                                                                               
Symbolic Constants Subring
sage: SR0.I()

sage: _.parent()

```

Compare with:

```
sage: SR0.pi()                                                                                                                                                          
pi
sage: _.parent()

The "Updated [SageMath](SageMath) version to 9.5" commit is killing the merge, but otherwise this is OK. You can set it to positive review on my behalf whenever it merges and the patchbot is clean.

One patchbot green, one other has an unrelated failure.

Thanks for reviewing!
