# Issue 24526: Run scripts with sage-python23

Building the documentation on Python 3 fails immediately because `./sage --docbuild` runs the `python` program which is Python 2.

There are a few more places in `src/bin/sage` where `python` is used. This should be replaced by `sage-python23`.

I intended to to do same for other scripts too, but this is obviously fine.

+1 I already have this for most scripts in my branch; just haven't gotten around to making a ticket for it yet since it's pretty trivial.
