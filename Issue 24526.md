Building the documentation on Python 3 fails immediately because `./sage --docbuild` runs the `python` program which is Python 2.

There are a few more places in `src/bin/sage` where `python` is used. This should be replaced by `sage-python23`.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24763
