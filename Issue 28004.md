The abs_val function from NumberField is incorrect : for a complex place it computes the square of the absolute value, and not the absolute value.

It looks likes for every of these tests, it is enough to replace wrong result by the new one given by sage after introducting my change, and it's ok.
But I understand nothing to what is done by S_unit_solver.py, so I would'nt be able to say if the new values are really correct.
