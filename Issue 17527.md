Keywords: discrete gaussian lattice sampler gram-schmidt

Briefly, DiscreteGaussianDistributionLatticeSampler produces vectors which are much too large when the matrix is given over RDF.  It behaves as expected if the same matrix is given over QQ.

For any lattice L of dimension n, the norm of a sampled vector should be > sqrt(2*pi)*sigma*sqrt(n) with probability no greater than 2<sup>-2n</sup> (essentially never).  

[Reference: Lemma 2.8 of A Toolkit for Ring-LWE Cryptography, Lyubashevsky, Peikert, Regev, quoted in turn from Banaszczyk, New bounds in some transference theorems in the geometry of numbers.]

Here's a simple example of the behaviour.

```
n = 10
sigma = 30.0

from sage.stats.distributions.discrete_gaussian_lattice import DiscreteGaussianDistributionLatticeSampler

M = Matrix(ZZ, n, n)

for i in range(n):

  M[i, i] = i+1

D = DiscreteGaussianDistributionLatticeSampler(M, sigma)

want = RR(sqrt(n)*D.sigma)
have = mean([D().norm().n() for _ in range(10000)])

want, have, want/have
```

output:

(94.8683298050514, 92.3605709689830, 1.02715183340422)

If we alter the lonely ZZ to RDF, we get

(94.8683298050514, 564.835099977431, 0.167957568162534)

I discussed this with Martin Albrecht, and I think the most useful thing I can do is quote something he wrote about this:

I think the issue is this difference in behaviour:

```
sage: n = 5
sage: M = Matrix(ZZ, n, n)
sage: for i in range(n):
....:         M[i, i] = i+1
....:

sage: M.gram_schmidt()[0]
[1 0 0 0 0]
[0 2 0 0 0]
[0 0 3 0 0]
[0 0 0 4 0]
[0 0 0 0 5]

sage: M.change_ring(RDF).gram_schmidt()[0]

[ 1.0 -0.0 -0.0 -0.0 -0.0]
[ 0.0  1.0  0.0  0.0  0.0]
[ 0.0  0.0  1.0  0.0  0.0]
[ 0.0  0.0  0.0  1.0  0.0]
[ 0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  1.0]
```

In particular, the following comment from the documentation of gram_schmidt:

* "orthonormal" - default: "False" - if "True" the returned orthogonal vectors are unit vectors.  This keyword is ignored if the matrix is over "RDF" or "CDF" and the results are always orthonormal.

The sampler calls the gram_schmidt() routine during setup and hence you're
running into your unexpected behaviour.

My documentation is a bit fuzzy: it one the one hand claims only integer
matrices are supporter) but also claims that anything where matrix(B) works is
supported which is clearly not true.
