[Arxiv preprint 2005.08243](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.08243) of Gunnar Brinkmann describes an algorithm for computing the genus of a graph. Professor Brinkmann sent me the C source code and gave permission to include it in sage. (I will paste the permission email into a comment so we have in on record.) This ticket will incorporate Brinkmann's algorithm into sage, either replacing or complementing the current algorithm.

In my limited command-line testing (and the testing reported in the preprint) it can be orders of magnitude faster than the algorithm that is currently in sage. For example, sage would take hours (or days?) to calculate the genus of the complete graph on 7 vertices (see `sage.graphs.genus.simple_connected_genus_backtracker?`), but Brinkmann's algorithm seems instantaneous for this graph. In fact, Brinkmann's algorithm is still instantaneous for complete graphs on 11 vertices, and takes only a few seconds for 13 vertices.

Sure, the program is attached. It reads multi_code. The format is very
easy and described in the attached txt file.

Feel free to use it in sage or in any other way where it can be useful.

Best wishes,

Gunnar

As mentioned in Professor Brinkmann's email message, the command-line version of the program reads `multi_code` input. This format is described in the documentation of `gconv` by Thomas Harmuth.


```
4) multi_code_old
   This code is binary. The first entry is the number of vertices.
   Vertices are numbered 1,...,n. To each vertex x there is a list of
   neighbours with higher numbers than x (like in reg_code_old), followed by a zero.
   The last list is always empty (no neighbours of n with a higher number than n),
   so the last "list" is not followed by a zero.
   After the last byte the next graph follows.
        ...
7) multi_code
   See 4), but with the header at the beginning. The header is one of the following:
   >>multi_code<<
   >>multi_code le<<
   >>multi_code be<<
   where "le/be" stands for little endian/big endian.
```

This PR puts the unaltered (but renamed) original source file into the `src/sage/graphs/` directory. It can be compiled for command-line use, by using the instructions at the start of the file.

Todo: 1. Implement an interface with sage. 2. Incorporate this into sage's `genus` method. I do not expect either of these to be difficult.

This is certainly a good idea to add an interface to this code, but, I think the right way to do it is to make an optional package, as we have for `tdlib`, `bliss`, etc.

Not sure of the right link to get complete instructions to do that, but you can start with https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/packaging.html and https://wiki.sagemath.org/SageMathExternalPackages
