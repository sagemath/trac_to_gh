# Issue 29133: Add implementations of remainder trees and smooth part

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29370

Original creator: roed

Original creation time: 2020-03-19 19:35:42

Dan Bernstein has a paper from 2004 with an algorithm for computing the smooth parts of a bunch of integers.  I recently implemented a simple version of it (without much effort toward optimization) which can still be useful when used on long lists.

Batch modifying tickets that will likely not be ready for 9.1, based on a review of the ticket title, branch/review status, and last modification date.

Some quick comments:
- The branch needs to be rebased.
- The patchbot has a couple of complaints about docstring formatting. Maybe also remove the spaces around `=` in examples like `n.smooth_part(B = 10)`.
- I think your product tree algorithm requires commutativity. If that's indeed the case, it should be documented and/or checked (or improved).
- I don't understand what this block is for:
  {{{
  +        if not isinstance(x, Integer):
  +            x = Integer(x)
  }}}
- I don't like that there are no tests covering 0, 1, and negative inputs.
