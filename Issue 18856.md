# Issue 18856: bug in units conversion

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19093

Original creator: schymans

Original creation time: 2015-08-26 13:40:47

Keywords: units

The .convert() function converts units to their base units, e.g.


```
sage: (units.energy.joule).convert()                            
```


```
kilogram*meter^2/second^2
```

The units of heat capacity are joule/kelvin/kilogram and since joule is not a base unit, it should be possible to convert them to base units. However, this throws an error:


```
sage: (units.energy.joule/units.temperature.kelvin/units.mass.kilogram).convert()
```


```
Traceback (click to the left of this block for traceback)
...
ValueError: Cannot convert
```


This seems to be the case whenever something is divided by temperature.

Goodness, did I really create this ticket only 3 weeks ago? Just googled it again and found the same issue asked by myself 2 years ago with a proposed workaround by Eviatar Bach:
