Two new strongly regular graphs for our database. With a cool and short construction for the 276 instance found by Dima (I'd still be trying otherwise).

typo:

also, I wonder about using `sum()` to join lists - should you import it from `__builtin__` to overwrite Sage's (symbolic) default?

The typo is fixed, and you will notice that it had nothing to do with this branch. Next time you spot a typo in a function which is not related to ticket X, instead of having the author of X fix it for you it would be better manners to add a commit yourself if you care.

About sum: by default in a .py file the 'sum' is Python's sum. The symbolic sum would have to be imported manually, which I did not do.

well, I didn't have time for this then...

same in .pyx ? OK; it seems I'd remove some such imports I did... OK, not here, certainly.

Otherwise, looks good to me.
