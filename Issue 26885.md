Keywords: Intrinsics, SIMD, Polyhedra, FindPoly

In #26887 we are constructing a class that makes fast computations of combinatorial data of Polyhedra.

Can we add the extra compile argument `-march=native` in `build/cythonized/setup.py`?


```
if os.environ.get("SAGE_FAT_BINARY") != "yes":
    extra_compile_args.append('-march=native')
```


This would speed up those calculations depending on the architecture:

- `f_vector` of `polytopes.permutahedron(8)` takes 1.6 seconds with intrinsics and 4.8 seconds without.
- `f_vector` of a 20-dimensional counterexample of the Hirsch-conjecture takes about 3 minutes with intrinsics and 9 minutes without (the polytope contains 353,731,266 faces).

As we are setting up a database `FindPoly`, which shall contain a lot of polytopes, we would like calculations to be done as fast as somehow possible. The project does not depend on this happening, but still it would be nice.

looks OK - not sure whether converting version to `float()` is normal practice, but that's minor.

I'm also not sure whether this will pass the argument to Cython, or it needs

`# distutils: extra_compile_args = -march=native`

in `*.pxd` files.

I believe it works, but I'm not entirely sure.

This seems to state that `sage/stats/distributions/discrete_gaussian_integer.pyx` was compiled with `-march=native`.

I have not set it with `CFLAGS`, in that case it would have appeared twice on the list.

Thanks for the comment by the way. It makes sense to me.

I'm just very busy at the moment and didn't have time to see how that could be handled by the configure script.

For example, I think we already check for a suitable version of gcc to see if we need to build our own. And we include an autoconf macro (m4/ax_c_check_flag.m4) that will try to compile a file using `-march=native`, and then report back if it worked or not.

Thanks. I basically did it like this.

I also added `-O0`, `-O2` and `-g` according to `SAGE_DEBUG`. This helps clean up a lot of code (basically every package sets those flags manually).

Finally, I used `src/bin/testcflags.sh` to remove unsupported flags.

The package `ecm` still adds `-march=native` on top of `CFLAGS` unless a similar flag is present.

Some packages prefer `-O3` over `-O2`, so I left the flag `-O3` as it is.

With this branch all tests passed on my end (ran distclean and installed all packages I touched).

Ok. Took a while, but it seems to work now. The test `sage -t --long src/sage/interfaces/psage.py` only worked on retry, but I guess this is fine.

What I did was basically the following:


```
$ make distclean
$ ./configure $(./configure --help | grep -oP '\-\-with-system[^ =]+' | sort | uniq | sed 's/with/without/' | grep -v gfortran | past -sd " ")
$ make build; ./sage -i openssl; ./sage -f python3; ./sage -i pyopenssl; make build
$ ./sage -i $(./sage --optional | awk -F\. '{print $1}' | grep -v warnings | grep -v package |  grep -v gfort | grep -v buckygen |grep -v database | grep -v polymake | grep -v jupymake | paste -sd " ")
$ sage -i sage_numerical_backends_coin
$ make
$ sage -t --long --all
```

(install gcc)


```
$ make distclean
$ ./configure $(./configure --help | grep -oP '\-\-with-system[^ =]+' | sort | uniq | sed 's/with/without/' | grep -v gfortran | grep -v gcc | past -sd " ")
$ make build; ./sage -i openssl; ./sage -f python3; ./sage -i pyopenssl; make build
$ ./sage -i $(./sage --optional | awk -F\. '{print $1}' | grep -v warnings | grep -v package | grep -v gfort | grep -v buckygen |grep -v database | grep -v polymake | grep -v jupymake | paste -sd " ")
$ sage -i sage_numerical_backends_coin; make; sage -t --long --all
```

(use system gcc)

I'm often having trouble with openssl and I don't exactly understand the problem (but the workaround seems to work), so I guess you can ignore that part.

I would suggest the following for others to test it:

- Pull ticket.
- Unset `CFLAGS` etc.
- `make distclean`
- configure to compile as you would usually do, plus add the following:

```
$ ./configure --help | grep -oP '\-\-with-system[^ =]+' | sort | uniq | sed 's/with/without/' | grep -v gfortran | grep -v gcc | past -sd " "
```

  so e.g. one would configure to compile with clang as follows:

```
$ CC=clang CXX=clang++ FC=flang ./configure $(./configure --help | grep -oP '\-\-with-system[^ =]+' | sort | uniq | sed 's/with/without/' | grep -v gfortran | grep -v gcc | past -sd " ")
```

- make sage
- install optional packages

```
$ ./sage -i $(./sage --optional | awk -F\. '{print $1}' | grep -v warnings | grep -v package |  grep -v gfort | grep -v buckygen |grep -v database | grep -v polymake | grep -v jupymake | paste -sd " ") sage_numerical_backends_coin
```

- test everything with `sage -t --all --long`

Report any (unusual) trouble you are having.

Can someone please help me with the following issue.

- conda-forge and homebrew-macos

```
  `/bin/sh: ../../src/bin/./testcflags.sh: No such file or directory`
```

  The following line seems to be a problem:

```
+opt := $(shell export CC=$(CC) && ../../src/bin/./testcflags.sh $(opt))
```


Otherwise things are looking good, I would say.

Things have improved "by themselves" (of course not):

Now the current ticket (with #29087 merged) runs as smooth as the current beta [https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/actions/runs/65613035](https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/actions/runs/65613035). However many tests got cancelled due to exceeding 6 hours.

Some strange fail in (debian-bullseye, standard):

This appears to be #28800. I'm currently using the original settings for
- pari (to fix this segemtation fault),
- fflas_ffpack,
- gfortran.

I'll push something, once I have more luck.

It seems that my approaches for disabling `-march=native` for certain packages don't work.

For ubuntu-trusty it tried to compile `gfortran` with `-march=native`, but I tried to disable that.

For linuxmint-19, python 2 I'm still getting the segmentation fault when building the documentation. So I'm suspecting that `pari` was build with `-march=native` against my wishes.

https://github.com/kliem/sage-test-27122/runs/622915243?check_suite_focus=true

What kind of options should I add for this?

Something like `--disable-sse --disable-sse2 --disable-sse3 --disable-ssse3 --disable-sse41 --disable-sse42 --disable-fma --disable-fma4 --disable-avx --disable-avx2`? However, I'm not sure that this will be used anywhere.

I don't think this is where it belongs. I'm setting flags for building any package.

This is usually done in `configure.ac` and is so already. If you don't set `CFLAGS` then `AC_PROG_CC()` will set `CFLAGS` to `-g -02` (or different order).

sure, you are setting compilers' flags, and this is done in the files I pointed to.
E.g. in `build/pkgs/gcc/spkg-configure.m4` we have

```
    # Modify CXX to include an option that enables C++11 support if necessary
    AX_CXX_COMPILE_STDCXX_11([], optional)
```

which adds if needed something to `CXXFLAGS`, etc.

AC_PROG_CC only is called early in `configure.ac` to ensure general sanity.
As you might know, `build/pkgs/*/spkg-configure.m4` are collected by `./boostrap` and used to
generate `./configure` from them and `configure.ac`. We have moved a lot of compiler-specific stuff into  `build/pkgs/*/spkg-configure.m4` when the latter were instroduced, and for a good reason.

And back to the old problems again.

https://github.com/kliem/sage/actions/runs/140694723

There are sementation faults when building the documentation e.g. in ubuntu bionic.

However, I disabled `march=native` for pari and all packages depending on `pari` and that still didn't seem to fix the issue (according to the logs this seemed to work).

Something isn't thread safe from above probably as in #28800. I have no clue, about that and I'm left with disabling `march=native` for random packages and hoping that I have luck.

Or does anyone know how to get a meaningful log of the documentation build?

permutahedron. Looks like stuff linked to cddlib, it says so in the code. I don't remember cddlib to be so sensitive to optimisation. Heck, I use `-march=native` in my sage-on-gentoo builds and I am fine.
But `pari` is definitely sensitive to optimisation. When I was working on enabling clang, I also tried the Intel compiler. `pari` needed to be compiled at `-O0` with it. Any optimisation with icc would break it. That was the only package that I remember with that issue.

This old run, didn't have the new doctest failures.

So try disabling `-march=native` for `pari` and maxima`?

As far as I understand, Maxima build process does not involve anything but a Lisp compiler, ECL in the case of Sage. And ECL compiles directly into object files, as far as I know.

So this is probably a red herring.

The last commits don't make a difference as far as I can tell. But the new mac failures seem to be real random. They are also present here (which is a completely different ticket):
- local-macos (homebrew-macos-python3_pythonorg, minimal) https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/785733405?check_suite_focus=true

I personally guess the new errors on mac are either random or caused by something else (some package updated maybe). That would also explain why on homebrew-macos-python3_xcode there are so many new failures for standard, but not for minimal. (As this ticket here is supposed to influence minimal much more than standard.)

Something is going on either way, as even on 9.2.beta1 we have many time outs in `plot` and `manifolds`. So if I get an extra error in `sage -t src/sage/plot/plot3d/shapes.pyx`, I don't even know if this is really bad or just random.

Basically, I see the following options now:

- revert the last two commits or not (independent of the other options):

  I don't see an advantage in disabling `-march=native` for `pari`, but maybe that is really something we should do.
- decide that the macos failures are either random or acceptable
- disable `-march=native` for clang (but it is not said that things would improve for mac then)
- someone has an educated guess about what I could do about the mac failures

It is possible however that some of the new mac failures are caused by the fact that the default `CFLAGS` is now `-g -O2` instead of just empty.

For an updated comparison, I started a mac only test on the current develop again:

Until now, every build of sage would pick up `CFLAGS`, `CXXFLAGS`, `FCFLAGS` and `F77FLAGS` again from the environment. This is strange especially now that we have seperated `make` from `configure`.

With this ticket the flags will be picked up on `configure` (if set) and will overwritten for `make` according to their set up (this is what `sage-build-env-config.in` does). They are also mostly respected now. Until now, if you set `CFLAGS` to `-O0`, every package `spkg-install.in` would just overwrite that (or add `-g -O2`, which in practice overwrites it I think). Now many (but not all) packages will just respect that.

I think it needs very little change to implement autotools semantics of "precious variables" `CFLAGS` etc. from here, but I'm not sure exactly how to do this.

Yes you can still set `SAGE_DEBUG`. However, if you configure with the option `--enable-debug=...`, it will override this variable.

Note also that this must now be done at configuration time.

The problem is that what `SAGE_DEBUG` mostly does is to set `CFLAGS` accordingly. If we configure this stuff in `configure` then it feels like doing everything twice. Unless we ignore `SAGE_DEBUG` mostly in `configure` and wait for this until `sage-build-env-config.in`. There we could do

```
export SAGE_DEBUG?="@SAGE_DEBUG@"

and then build together all the flags according to `SAGE_DEBUG`.
