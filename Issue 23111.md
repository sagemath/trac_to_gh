#15246 is fun, but unfortunately [untested is broken](http://sagecell.sagemath.org/?q=mrxlvy) - it doesn't use `pretty_print`.  Should be very easy to fix.

(In fact, this should probably return an `HTMLFragment` or something which the display hook then takes care of - ?

Hi,

I just tried to fix this in the latest develop version but found it was already fixed by #22673 . See the diff at https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit?id=5881692d6a4b8a8d4f5675a326173f7a381e435a .

Thanks for the update!  I had only tested it in the previous master (e.g. on Sage cell server) because I only happened to see it and it wasn't very serious :)

Closing tickets in the sage-duplicate/invalid/wontfix module with positive_review (i.e. someone has confirmed they should be closed).
