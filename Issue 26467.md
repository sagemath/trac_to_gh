Please add documentation and doctests to the new `__getitem__` method.

It would be the same doctests as those of `__getslice__`. \\
What do you think is the most appropriate ? :
1. Leave as it is.
2. Add documentation.
3. Add documentation and doctests and then have the sames tests two times.

either duplicate the doc or add a doctest for when the argument is not a slice but just one element

My bad.\\

And my newest tests won't work in py2 as `sage: ft[0]` return `'\xc3\xa9'`.
