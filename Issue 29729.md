From https://ask.sagemath.org/question/50885/is-there-a-way-to-integrate-sqrtxsqrtx-in-sage/, the command

```
sage: integrate(sqrt(x + sqrt(x)), x, algorithm='giac')
```

returns

```

This was not fixed by #28913.

Changing keywords from "" to "integral".

Changing keywords from "integral" to "integral, giac, pari".

Now returns

```
2*(2*((1/6*sqrt(x)+1/24)*sqrt(x)-1/16)*sqrt(x+sqrt(x))-1/16*ln(abs(2*(sqrt(x+sqrt(x))-sqrt(x))-1)))
```

abs inside the ln was ineffective

Do we know the version of some release of giac which will solve the bug?

The current version with the bug is:

```
$ sage -standard | grep giac
giac....................................1.5.0.87p2.p1 (1.5.0.87p2.p1)
```

Moving to 9.4, as 9.3 has been released.

Parsing warnings from giac would make sense. Do they always are of the form

```
Warning, {msg}\n
```

This fails with giac 1.7:

```
File "/usr/lib/python3.9/site-packages/sage/symbolic/integration/external.py", line 247, in sage.symbolic.integration.external.giac_integrator
Failed example:
    giac_integrator(sqrt(x + sqrt(x)), x)
Expected:
    1/12*(2*sqrt(x)*(4*sqrt(x) + 1) - 3)*sqrt(x + sqrt(x))
    - 1/8*log(abs(2*sqrt(x + sqrt(x)) - 2*sqrt(x) - 1))
Got:
    1/12*(2*sqrt(x)*(4*sqrt(x) + 1) - 3)*sqrt(x + sqrt(x)) - 1/8*log(-2*sqrt(x + sqrt(x)) + 2*sqrt(x) + 1)
```

I've opened #32449 for this
