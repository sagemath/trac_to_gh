Our maxima SPKG requires(?) a custom patch called `undoing_true_false_printing_patch.patch` that reverts this upstream commit:

https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/code/ci/f5e9b0f7eb122c4e48ea9df144dd57221e5ea0ca

Our patch was introduced in sage commit 91990e962b to ease the upgrade to maxima-5.29.1. Since upstream has no plans to revert that commit (and distros won't either), we'll have to work around it before we can use maxima from the system.

I'm not getting too far with this, but the problem lies somewhere between when the `retrieve` function receives its `msg` argument in `interfaces/maxima_lib.py` and when it is printed to the console. The `msg` we receive is


```
((MTEXT) Is  $_SAGE_VAR_a  an  EVEN   NUMBER ?)
```


but when printed out it looks like


```
Is _SAGE_VAR_a an even\ number?
```


Our copy of `retrieve` is out-of-date, but the upstream one has the same issue. I tried setting the global value of `linel` to `1000` in case it was a word-wrap issue in one of the display functions, but no luck there.

If we need to do a little bit of work on that string to make it look nice (like unescape spaces) then we should. So I think what should happen is:\n\n* confirm that unpatched maxima normally asks the question without a backspace in it.\n\n* update our monkey-patched `retrieve` to include the string in its error message as produced by unpatched maxima. Ideally we'd do that by using the same rendering to a string that maxima does to the IO stream, but it may be that the different streams aren't fully compatible. In that case, we may want to do some post processing on the string. This is certainly a cleaner solution than (monkey-)patching an additional internal routine.\n\nI think you may want to reconsider the final goal of using an unpatched system maxima, though: we build `maxima.fas` through a [custom extension](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/a89f81d7783df2d4e4a187bf209e94d128301f83/build/pkgs/maxima/patches/maxima.system.patch) of the maxima build system. Maxima normally does not build it, because its build process is set up to produce an *application* not a *library*. Our build instructions are ECL-specific (and indeed, it's not immediately clear that all lisps would support something like this), so I don't think that you'll find much traction pushing this change upstream, much less getting distributions to build Maxima/ECL this way. You'd basically have to make a separate package `maxima-ecl-fas.rpm` or something like that.\n\nI expect we're stuck with a custom-built maxima for that reason already: maxima_lib is NOT a \"supported\" way of using maxima.\n\nSo it's nice to clean up patches like the one on this ticket for general code maintainability, but I think it's futile to try and move to a \"standard\" maxima. (I hope that a sage install that uses the system ECL without write permission on the system ECL library can somehow adapt ECLs search paths to also look in a location that sits in the sage tree)",

If it helps anything, I suspect the backslash insertion may be coming from [this patch](https://github.com/andrejv/maxima/blob/b11405d303f657766060c6d725474ccdcacf9c2a/share/contrib/unicodedata/grind-patch.lisp). Note that `grind.lisp` has its own [slash](https://github.com/andrejv/maxima/blob/b11405d303f657766060c6d725474ccdcacf9c2a/src/grind.lisp#L168), but it looks like both should backslash a space. Looking at the `MTEXT` you get, the double space suggests the object is `( ... "EVEN " "NUMBER" ...)` or `( ... "EVEN" " NUMBER" ...). Also, these may be symbols that have attributes on them that tell `grind/displa` how to render them to strings (internationalization in maxima already??). 

The line where the mtext gets constructed is [here](https://github.com/andrejv/maxima/blob/b11405d303f657766060c6d725474ccdcacf9c2a/interfaces/emacs/imaxima/imaxima.lisp#L552).

Quite frankly, is maxima normally is happy with the backslashed space in the string it constructs (because their printer strips out the backslash then again, presumably) we should be happy with it too. The only thing we're doing in `maxima_lib` is monkey-patch `retrieve` to raise an error with the question string rather than ask the question. If we need to do a little bit of work on that string to make it look nice (like unescape spaces) then we should. So I think what should happen is:

* confirm that unpatched maxima normally asks the question without a backspace in it.

* update our monkey-patched `retrieve` to include the string in its error message as produced by unpatched maxima.

In that case, we may want to do some post processing on the string. This is certainly a cleaner solution than (monkey-)patching an additional internal routine.

I think you may want to reconsider the final goal of using an unpatched system maxima, though: we build `maxima.fas` through a [custom extension](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/a89f81d7783df2d4e4a187bf209e94d128301f83/build/pkgs/maxima/patches/maxima.system.patch) of the maxima build system. Maxima normally does not build it, because its build process is set up to produce an *application* not a *library*. Our build instructions are ECL-specific (and indeed, it's not immediately clear that all lisps would support something like this), so I don't think that you'll find much traction pushing this change upstream, much less getting distributions to build Maxima/ECL this way. You'd basically have to make a separate package `maxima-ecl-fas.rpm` or something like that.

I expect we're stuck with a custom-built maxima for that reason already: maxima_lib is NOT a "supported" way of using maxima.

So it's nice to clean up patches like the one on this ticket for general code maintainability, but I think it's futile to try and move to a "standard" maxima. (I hope that a sage install that uses the system ECL without write permission on the system ECL library can somehow adapt ECLs search paths to also look in a location that sits in the sage tree)

If maxima upstream strongly rejects the idea, then in the long term, I think we should revert back to a supported interface (but expect lots of disagreement on that) rather than require a custom patched maxima on most systems for the rest of eternity.

> I hope that a sage install that uses the system ECL without write permission on the system ECL library can somehow adapt ECLs search paths to also look in a location that sits in the sage tree

We already support system ECL and this works because you can point ECL to the maxima library directly if you've just installed the maxima SPKG and know where it lives.

OK, I think I found what the problem really is. If I capture what `msg` is actually passed to `retrieve` (that is to say: I monkey-patch retrieve to store the message in a global variable), I get:

```
sage: ecl_eval("*RET_MSG*")

```

The vertical bars note the enclosed string is actually the name of a *symbol*, not a string. So it passes the space as a *symbol*. And apparently when this gets processed by maxima and sent to a string-backed stream rather than STDOUT, this gets rendered as "\ " rather than " ". There may be fancier options, but as long as this is the only problem we have, a plain work-around is to manually replace space symbols by strings before processing. Updated "retrieve":

```
ecl_eval(r"""
(defun retrieve (msg flag &aux (print? nil))
  (declare (special msg flag print?))
  (setq msg (mapcar #'(lambda (x) (if (eq x '| |) " " x)) msg))
  (or (eq flag 'noprint) (setq print? t))
  (error
      (concatenate 'string "Maxima asks: "
      (string-trim '(#\Newline)
      (with-output-to-string (*standard-output*)
      (cond ((not print?)
         (setq print? t)
             (format-prompt t ""))
        ((null msg)
             (format-prompt t ""))

        (t
             (format-prompt t "~M" msg)
         (mterpri))
      ))))
  )
)
""")
```

This should work with an unpatched `msize-mtext`.

*FOR POSTERITY*

To help people hack ecl/maxima from sage/python in the future: The key to capturing the message was to do a

```
ecl_eval(r"""(defvar *RET_MSG* NIL)""")
```

and then stuff the following somewhere at the start of `retrieve`:

```
(setq *RET_MSG* msg)
```

This can all be done interactively from the sage prompt by a judicious use of `ecl_eval` statements, because LISP is just about as dynamic as PYTHON is. For posterity, the command sequence to get the offending error message:

```
var('x,a')
assume(a>0)
assume(a,'integer')
limit(x^(a),x=0)
```

I don't think I opened a ticket. I did investigate a bit, and found the upstream bug:

https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/bugs/2596/

The patch was introduced in #13973 to fix a failing doctest. There is apparently a workaround within maxima by enabling "ratmx" for the exponentiation, but I don't think there's a sage interface for that. We could always mark the doctest `# known bug` and link to the upstream issue.

I opened #32898 so that removing `matrixexp.patch`
has its own ticket.
