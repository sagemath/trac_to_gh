I made a few small reviewer changes (after a trivial rebase). If my changes look good, then you can set a positive review.

Actually, one other small thing: Could you add a reference?

Please put all references in the master bibliography file, `SAGE_ROOT/src/doc/en/reference/references/index.rst`, and just put citations to them in docstrings. Also, references should be formatted as `[Bir1975]`. (See `local/share/doc/sage/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html` from an up-to-date version of Sage for details.) I would also be inclined to not put a wikipedia entry in the references and just cite it directly in the docstring: I would change `(see [WPLG]_)` to `(see :wikipedia:`Link_group`)`.
