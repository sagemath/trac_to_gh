This bug was fixed in GiNaC 1.5.x but pynac forked off the 1.4.x branch. See

Translated to sage syntax from the GiNaC 1.5.x unit tests:

G # Singular gets it correct: u^4*z^2

g = gcd(e, e.diff(x)) # pynac falls into an infinite loop 
# also there is potential for a wrong answer



```

So, it appears as if we need to use Singular or sync to at least GiNaC 1.5.8 .

If there isn't a straightforward way to adopt the patch that went into GiNaC 1.5.x, I don't think it's worth the time to sync the gcd code in pynac with the latest version in GiNaC.

Multivariate gcd is a hard problem. IMHO, we should have a single, well-tested, fast implementation and use that everywhere in Sage, rather than rely on the efforts of each upstream developer team to implement their own with a unique set of bugs.

Using Factory as a library doesn't look too hard:

http://www.singular.uni-kl.de/svn/trunk/factory/examples/gcd.cc

The README file is helpful, although I'm not sure if there is any other documentation available:

http://www.singular.uni-kl.de/svn/trunk/factory/README

I'm quite sure we would get good feedback from the current developers if the issues are discussed at the libsingular-devel list:

http://groups.google.com/group/libsingular-devel

It seems that once the necessary changes are made in pynac to use Factory for gcd's, it would be straightforward to plug in another library, perhaps giac, later.

and similarly with other transcendental numbers and trig and so forth. AFAIK, Singular would throw an error about QQness instead of determining that Pi - 1 was the greatest common factor.

There is a lot to like about Singular too, which is probably why William wrote those things in TODO.txt and the docstrings. Some of that seems to have changed in the last couple of years though.
