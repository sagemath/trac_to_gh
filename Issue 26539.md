Some useful micro-optimizations can be done to how `MonoDict` and `TripleDict` uses `KeyedRef`:

1. Replace `isinstance(x, KeyedRef)` by `type(x) is KeyedRef`.

2. Replace `PyWeakref_GetObject` by `PyWeakref_GET_OBJECT`.

We also add an inline function `is_dead_weakref` for `isinstance(x, KeyedRef) and PyWeakref_GetObject(x) is Py_None` which appears in many places.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/26776

Reviewing some of this code makes me wonder whether we really need all those checks for dead `KeyedRef`s in `get()`. Shouldn't the eraser ensure that no dead references occur?

In more detail: if we find a dead weakref in `__getitem__` (or `__contains__` which is similar), `lookup()` guarantees that the `id()` of the key in the dict matches the given key. If it's really the same key, then the weakref should not be dead since we have a live reference (passed as argument to `__getitem__`). If it's not the same key, then it must be a recycled `id()`. But that can only happen once the original key has been freed from memory, which happens after the weakref callback, which should remove the entry from the dict.

So I don't see any scenario how a dead weakref could be found in `__getitem__`, but I might be missing something...
