Keywords: Nonsymmetric Macdonald

Existing code for nonsymmetric Macdonald polynomials in Sage (#2708) is in ns_macdonald.py.
It uses the HHL algorithm and is limited to Type A. The patch at hand will extend this to arbitrary
Cartan types using Demazure-Lusztig operators. An initial patch was written at ICERM by
Nicolas Thierry consulting with Daniel Orr. Others proposing to work on this project are Ben Brubaker,
Daniel Bump, Anne Schilling and Mark Shimozono.

Anne and Nicolas,

The family returned by NonSymmetricMacdonaldPolynomials should possess a method
that gives direct access to the affine Hecke representation of which it is a basis.

I would like to add symmetric Macdonald polynomials to this patch.
It should be straightforward, especially if the AHA representation is at hand.

Hi Mark,

> that gives direct access to the affine Hecke representation of which it is a basis.

Do you mean that you want the operators

```
        T   = KL.twisted_demazure_lusztig_operators     (   q1, q2, convention="dominant")
        T_Y = KL.demazure_lusztig_operators_on_classical(q, q1, q2, convention="dominant")
```

directly available? Or in which format do you want the Hecke algebra representation? You can get

```
sage: E = NonSymmetricMacdonaldPolynomials(["A",2,1])
sage: E._KL
Group algebra of the Ambient space of the Root system of type ['A', 2, 1] over Fraction Field of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in q, q1, q2 over Rational Field
```


Best,

Anne

Anne,

The methods I wanted were hidden in the _T and _T_Y attributes.

Why does twisted_demazure_lusztig_operators use classical().dual().affine().dual()?
I believe this is correct for untwisted root systems but why do
we know this is correct for twisted root systems? If this is a bug it only affects the
zero-th Hecke operator.

Ok. Feel free to add whichever accessors you might think relevant.

Well, it's not a bug, since we get the correct results :-)

More seriously: The cartan type as specified here is actually not really used, except for testing for the relations. It indeed looks dubious and should at some point be rewritten using the "other_affinization" method and the like. We must have been lucky to specify a type
that gives the same Coxeter group.

So, if you have a short way to specify the cartan type which you believe is more correct, please go ahead. Otherwise I think this can wait until someone reimplements T0_check in a less ad-hock way.

Do you know of an independent way to compute the nonsymmetric Macdonald polynomial
for twisted root systems, not just the t=0 specialization?
How was this verified?

The code currently checks that the results (i.e. the nonsymmetric Macdonald polynomials) are indeed eigenvectors of the Y operators. These conditions are not easy to satisfy. For types `A_n^{(1)}`, `B_n^{(1)}`, `BC_n^{(2)}` and `BC_n^{(2)}`-dual the NSMs were carefully compared against Bogdan Ion's hand and maple computations. If you are worried, I can ask him to confirm type `A_{2n-1}^{(2)}` as well.

Nicolas, 

I added symmetric macdonald polynomials, fixed the parabolic root system stuff,
and edited the docs for nonsymmetric macdonalds rather extensively.
I already folded my review patch onto the given patch.
Please have a look and if it is ok, replace the above exported patch (I don't have sufficient

Hi Mark!

Thanks a lot for yor work. The documentation reads much better now.
Here are a couple questions about your changes:


```
 - sage: w = W.from_reduced_word([2,3])
 - sage: w.quantum_bruhat_successors([1,3])
 - Traceback (most recent call last):
 - ...
 - ValueError: s2*s3 is not of minimum length in its coset of the parabolic subgroup
 - generated by the reflections [1, 3] 
```

Was there a reason for removing this test?


```
- This implementation, based on the general recursion formula,
- covers all affine types including untwisted, twisted, `BC` and its
- dual.
+ This implementation covers all reduced affine root systems.
```

The phrasing certainly can be improved, but I think it is useful to briefly state the method used.


```
The extended affine Hecke algebra contains the Y's
```

Do we really need to mention the extended affine Hecke algebra? The Y's that are implemented are obtained by compositions of the T's and indexed by (co)roots.


```
629 + if len(index_set) == 0:
630 + return [] 
```

Was there a reason for this test in positive_roots? For now I removed it.

I removed the method for sums of parabolic positive roots. Do we still really need "is_parabolic_root"?

I did a couple changes in a review patch which I am about to push.

One remaining thing: I noticed that you changed "non-symmetric" to "nonsymmetric". If this is really what we want, then for consistency we should rename the class to NonsymmetricMacdonaldPolynomials (and its file accordingly). But that would not be consistent with the e.g. NonCommutativeSymmetricFunctions. 

Cheers,
                                     Nicolas

A couple further comments:

About symmetric macdo:

- Could you add a couple tests comparing them to the other implementation in type A?
- Do we have other potential consistency checks? Maybe test that they are indeed symmetric?
- We should make sure that, in the current way they are calculated, the caching happens properly. I.e. when we sum over the orbit, we want that e.g. T_{1,2}(f) reuses T_{1}(f).

Other than that, I would be in favor of extracting the changes about "positive roots" to a separate ticket, since they are mostly unrelated to macdonald polynomials (or are they not?).

I got a doctest error I didn't understand (stupid reason):
the tester was producing a blank line that wasn't matching the doctest string.

I can add that (or rather put it back in).

If only coroots are involved then no. I can take that out.

It is not needed (I added it during debugging before finding that the initial set of
simple roots needed to be changed before the search).
 
> I removed the method for sums of parabolic positive roots. Do we still really need "is_parabolic_root"?

That sum method should be thought of as analogous to the computation of rho.
This fixed quantity (depends only on the root system and subset of index set)
gets used many times over in the computation of the parabolic quantum Bruhat graph
(which we then use to make KR crystals).
That is why I decided not to delete it. 
There is a method in root_systems/root_space.py called quantum_root that requires this sum as well.

is_parabolic_root is probably not really needed.

Not really. I'm generally against unnecessary hyphenation.
(By the way I like NoncommutativeSymmetricFunctions better than the alternative.)

It's used many times there indeed, but if I remember well calculated
only once at the beginning of the method.

Ok. If I recall correctly my review patch has taken it out.


May I let you implement the little things on which we agreed, and
possibly reinstate sums_of_parabolic_positive_roots, with a cache and
documentation, if you think it's really worthwhile?

> I'm generally against unnecessary hyphenation.

I see your point.

Not totally consistent.

> (By the way I like NoncommutativeSymmetricFunctions better than the alternative.)

On the other hand NCSF has been the traditional shorthand for a while ...

Hmm. Here is what we have in Sage currently:

    NonCommutativeSymmetricFunctions 	NonDecreasingParkingFunction
    NonDecreasingParkingFunctions 	NonNegativeIntegerSemiring
    NonNegativeIntegers 	NonSymmetricMacdonaldPolynomials
    NonattackingFillings

There is a bias, but it's not perfectly consistent.

Do we need to make a poll on sage-devel?

Nicolas,

Right now the quantum bruhat graph is twice broken; I will repair it.

The quantum_bruhat_successors method in categories/weyl_groups (element method)
gets called repeatedly (once for each element of the parabolic quotient)
to generate the quantum Bruhat graph. Each time this function is called, 
it needs to loop through the set of positive roots that are NOT in the 
parabolic subsystem; each such root could lead to a quantum arrow.
For this reason I'm going to reinstate the function that
constructs the non-parabolic positive roots. At this point I don't see a reason
why one should also not remember the sum of these roots (rather than recompute it
repeatedly).

Also the quantum_root method (in root_systems/root_space.py), which is called
by quantum_bruhat_successors, requires the same sum.

I'll put the failing doctest back in. I couldn't match the exception message, which started
with a <BLANKLINE> rather than Traceback. Maybe you can match it.

I pushed another review patch after Nicolas' review patch.

I figured out the doctest issue.

There is a direct formula (see Cherednik's 2009 book, formula (3.3.15)) 
for the symmetric macdonald as a linear combination of
nonsymmetric Macdonalds (with complicated rational function coefficients),
which someone else can program when they feel inspired.
This is the same kind of chore as writing a function for the precise eigenvalues in the
nonsymmetric Macdonald recurrence.

Hi Mark and Nicolas,

Thank you both for your review patches. I looked them both over and in principle it is fine with me to fold them in (I made some minor fixes to Mark's review patch).

Regarding the naming, I agree with Mark that it is nicer to remove the hyphens. However, can we nonetheless leave the name of the class as NonSymmetricMacdonaldPolynomials in accordance with NCSF and most other classes? I do not mind this convention in sage since the real meaning is in (non)symmetric and not the non. But if you really want to change it, that is fine with me as well.

Best,

The patch depends on #10963 and Nicolas probably has not yet uploaded that patch yet on trac. Oops and #13589 is also a prerequiste. So I put this into the dependencies.

Hi!

I checked Anne's little review patch.

I replaced here my "old" patch by yours.

I just posted on trac the latest #10963 patch (it indeed needed some rebasing on top of the reviewer's patches for #13589)

Cheers,
                                   Nicolas

Nicolas, I updated the patch on the combinat queue since there was a subtle bug in the symmetric macdonald polynomials having to do with caching and the order of searching a Weyl orbit.
Didn't export it to trac.

Again I forgot to make a separate review patch. There is a doctest change in 
symmetric_macdonald polynomials and a change in the orbit method of root_lattice_realizations,
to calling TransitiveIdealGraded instead of TransitiveIdeal.

Do you have Coxeter3 installed? This might account for the first error (in which case, it is an unrelated error I need to fix). The latter two errors seem to be reordering, and if so, likely comes from the version bump of GAP.

Hi!

Thanks to Jean-Baptiste's mac, I have been able to reproduce and
analyze the bug reported by Volker. At the end of the day, it's a
combination of:

- CombinatorialFreeModule still computing hash values for elements
  from their _repr_ (yikes)

- CombinatorialFreeModule being somewhat lax in input checking,
  leading to things like mixes of int's and Integer's in the support
  of elements.

- The root system code introducing those int's and Integer's in the
  first place

- sort giving different results for mixed lists containing strings and
  integers, depending on whether some of those integers are int's or
  Integer's

Thus the odds of things going wrong were low, which is why this
remained unnoticed for so long. Why did this only appear on certain platforms?
Well, the result of

```
    sage: sorted([int(0), 'delta', 1])
    [0, 1, 'delta']
```

is not the same on my Linux and Jean-Baptiste's Mac.

Probably, with some other doctests, the problem would have instead
appeared on my machine and not on others.

I assume that (finally!) implementing a proper hash function for
CombinatorialFreeModule elements should do the job. But that will be
for another day. Yawn ....

In any cases, no worry to have: as I expected this has nothing to do
with #10963.

Cheers,
                           Nicolas

Hi Anne, Travis,

Thanks for merging in the latest dependencies! I have proofread the changes, and am happy with them,
up to one point: in FiniteEnumeratedSets I'd rather stick to the lazy import. The methods are potencially called repeteadly and reimporting Integer each time could waste time, whereas the lazy import should be resolved only once. I haven't done a benchmark though.

Once this detail is settled, we can go back to positive review!

Cheers,
                          Nicolas

Hi Nicolas,

Please change the import in FiniteEnumeratedSets (Travis changed this, right?).

Thanks!

Anne

Done!

For the record, here is the result of a quick benchmark I made out of
curiosity. For a trivial function, we get a factor of 10 in speed. Of
course it's not really representative since in our current use case
the methods are not quite as trivial.


```
"""
Comparative benchmark between lazy importing and importing inside a method

    sage: from test_lazy_import import f,g
    sage: %timeit f(i)
    1000000 loops, best of 3: 197 ns per loop
    sage: %timeit g(i)
    1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.65 µs per loop
"""
from sage.misc.lazy_import import lazy_import
lazy_import('sage.rings.integer', 'Integer', 'LazyInteger')

def f(i):
    return LazyInteger(i)

def g(i):
    from sage.rings.integer import Integer
    Integer(i)
```


Btw: it would be nice if pyflakes knew about `lazy_import`.
