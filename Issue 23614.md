I confirm that I get the same errors when run alone:


```

I am sorry, I do not know what happened with my run of `make ptestlong` which said `All tests passed`. I rechecked the log file of ptestlong.log, and I confirm that I got `All tests passed`:

What is apparently happening is that commit bf22de0 (see comment:2) causes the quadratic field of discriminant -3 to be garbage-collected more often.  This is in principle a good thing, but every time the field is constructed again, the computed generator of the unit group may be different than the previous time.  This also happens if you run

```
K = nfinit(y^2 + 3); nfbasistoalg(K, nfrootsof1(K)[2])

several times in GP; the result varies randomly between `1/2*y + 1/2` and `-1/2*y + 1/2`, the two roots of unity of order 6.

Commit 55a59ff (see comment:7) reduces the randomness in the number of times that `K` is constructed.  Experimentally it seems to work; I ran doctests in `polynomial_quotient_ring.py` 128 times with this commit applied and got no failures.

These new changes are just showing that the doctests were fragile to begin with. There's a bunch of things you can do to check the result is correct:
- look at the norms
- verify they and their inverses are S-integral (factorize the denominator)
- hard-code an S-unit basis and check that these occur as a power product of the computed set.
It's a pain, but I don't think we really have another option.
(I guess the answers only differ in some sign choices, so you could just construct the set of all sign choices and check your answer lies in there. That would be a reasonably strict test and will probably take a little longer before it breaks again)

One argument for caching a method is when it takes long time to compute which is not the case here:


```
sage: %time nf = NumberField(x^2-5,'a')
CPU times: user 1.12 ms, sys: 97 µs, total: 1.21 ms
Wall time: 962 µs
sage: %time nf.absolute_field('b')
CPU times: user 9 µs, sys: 1e+03 ns, total: 10 µs
Wall time: 13.8 µs
Number Field in b with defining polynomial x^2 - 5
```


Is there another reason why `absolute_field` should be cached?
