# Issue 16563: PPL MILP solver: improve handling of equalities

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16800

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2014-08-12 07:38:51

The PPL MILP backend treats a constraint `A == B` as 2 constraints `A <= B` and `A >= B`, which is much less efficient.
