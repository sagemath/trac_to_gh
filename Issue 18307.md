We get the expected warning, but then a very bizarre `KeyError` as well.  This is annoying and unhelpfully covers up the warning.

```
sage: plot(x,(x,1,100),linestyle='foo')
FormatterWarning: Exception in text/plain formatter: WARNING: Unrecognized linestyle 'foo'. Possible linestyle options are:
{'solid', 'dashed', 'dotted', dashdot', 'None'}, respectively {'-', '--', ':', '-.', ''}
  FormatterWarning,
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
KeyError: 'text/plain'
```
