Keywords: sd87

Currently, fixed modulus elements always print a precision

```
sage: ZpFM(5)(1)
1 + O(5^20)
```

For consistency with floating point p-adics and to save screen real estate, I think that they should not print their precision.

```
sage: a = ZpFM(5)(1); a
1
sage: a.precision_absolute()
20
```
