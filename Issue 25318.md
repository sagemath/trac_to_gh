In a few places in Sage, there are statements(!) of the form

```
A._coerce_(x)
```

where the result is not used.

The purpose is to check whether a coercion exists from `parent(x)` to `A`. Instead, this should be replaced by `has_coerce_map_from`. This is needed for porting to the new coercion model.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25555
