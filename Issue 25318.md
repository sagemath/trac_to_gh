# Issue 25318: Replace calls to _coerce_ for checking coercion by has_coerce_map_from

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25555

Original creator: jdemeyer

In a few places in Sage, there are statements(!) of the form

```
A._coerce_(x)
```

where the result is not used.

The purpose is to check whether a coercion exists from `parent(x)` to `A`. Instead, this should be replaced by `has_coerce_map_from`. This is needed for porting to the new coercion model.

looks good. If a patchbot turns green, you can set to positive on my behalf.

#23719 passes the testsuite, so I'll assume that this one also does.
