I think this probably qualifies as a "long time" test:


```
File "src/sage/manifolds/differentiable/tensorfield.py", line 4296, in sage.manifolds.differentiable.tensorfield.TensorField.dalembertian
Warning, slow doctest:
    De = e.dalembertian(); De
Test ran for 19.05 s
```



Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32967
