As the summary says. If I run "make numpy" on a system without its own pkg-config, the build fails. If I install Sage's `pkgconf` first, it works.

Shouldn't rather `pkgconfig` depend on `pkgconf`?

Logically that makes sense, but I only see the problem with numpy. (`pkgconfig` doesn't need `pkgconf` or a system-wide `pkg-config` to build, but it needs it to do anything.)

Right. Because `pkgconfig` is a very small package, I don't think we need to distinguish its build-time and run-time dependencies. Adding the dependency there is clearer, even if right now only numpy exposes the problem.
