Hi Preston. For your patch, references should go in a separate references section. See [this part](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/conventions.html#documentation-strings) of the Developers' Guide for details on how to do so.

Sorry... look at hecke.patch, not 12538.patch. The first one I posted accidentally includes some unrelated code that I've been working on.
