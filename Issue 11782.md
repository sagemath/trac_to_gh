# Issue 11782: improve the documentation of sage/misc/cython.py

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jhpalmieri

Original creation time: 2011-10-25 21:55:44

Assignee: jason

Various functions in cython.py have no documentation. The attached patch improves this. Note that after apply the patch, `sage --coverage cython.py` does not report 100%, because some multiline strings are interpreted as undocumented functions/classes/methods by the coverage script.  Also, the function `cython` has no doctests.  Suggests for that?

This also adds cython.py to the reference manual.

(This is a follow-up to #11887.  In that ticket, we changed the documentation from the `cython` function from being completely empty to being "TODO: document this function!")

Did you open a ticket for that? ;P

It might actually be covered by #7716, but I haven't tested it.

Apply trac_11954-cython-doc.patch, trac_11954-review.patch

Here's a new patch which makes various cosmetic changes to the Sphinx formatting. I wasn't sure what the mysterious `"sagobject_name"` was supposed to mean in the docstring of the cython lambda function and the doctests weren't too helpful on that point; I'm guessing it's a typo for `sage.object_name`.

If you're happy with my reviewer patch, that's a positive review.

I'm mostly happy with the reviewer patch -- thanks for your work on this, it looks much better now. However, I don't like line 314:

```
'``Compiling <filename>...``'
```

The quotes don't look good after running Sphinx. Maybe it should be ```'Compiling <filename>...'```? Or maybe the single quotes should be dropped? Or drop the double back quotes instead?
