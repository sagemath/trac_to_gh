Keywords: banner help

This arose from some of the discussion at #12421. In summary: we don't need to mention `license()` in the Sage banner.  Instead, we should mention the `help()` command.  I also added basic information about using `less` with introspection to the help message.

I like this.  jhpalmieri *always* knows how to add actual helpful documentation that is not too verbose.

This changes the help message after `sage -br` ~~but for some reason it doesn't actually change the banner~~ and now I read comment:2.  

As for the quotes, I don't have a strong opinion either and this seems reasonable.  I guess if we get emails asking for how to use help we'll need to change it!

All the sage/misc/ tests pass, and so although I'm going to run all of them now I'll put this as positive review.

By the way, do you know a way to use hg queues to import the same named patch, replacing the current one?  I always have to hg qremove it, which is annoying because they have long hard-to-type names.
