#### Moving Sage to Git

These changes are being tracked at #13015
 * Migrate Sage to a Git repository, with all spkgs combined into one git repo
 * Set up gitolite on boxen
 * Install the Git plugin on [http://trac.sagemath.org/experimental]
 * Write trac plugins for
  * allowing a trac user to upload a public SSH key
  * showing the branches
 * New cython for cycache: #13029, #13031
 * ccache and f90cache: #13032


#### Doctest and regression framework

 * Finish the changes at #12415


#### CFLAGS and CPU architectures

Fork MPIR's CPU-detecting code to determine correct CFLAGS for building MPIR (and other parts of Sage).
Add code to actually run the instructions which are supposed to be supported by the CPU to solve the VirtualBox problem.
