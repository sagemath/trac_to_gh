Keywords: representation, RIF


```
sage: RIF(1.84e13).exp()
6.817557048799520?e-1915670837
```

is wrong (`sage: exp(1.84e13)` gives `6.81755704879952e7991018467019`).

It seems that only the representation of the number is wrong, since

```
sage: (RIF(1.84e13).exp()).log()
1.840000000000000?e13
```

and

```
sage: 7e7991018467019 > RIF(1.84e13).exp() > 6e7991018467019
True
```

give the correct result.
