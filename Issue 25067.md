Changing keywords from "" to "sdl".

Is this still a problem with current Sage?

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2020-04-23 03:31:24

Is this the same as #25996?

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2021-09-25 19:53:44

Changing status from new to needs_review.

Outdated: It now fails in a different way (when tested with `tox -e docker-debian-stretch-i386-minimal-gcc_spkg` gives "Error building gcc-10.3.0").
Let's close this ticket.
