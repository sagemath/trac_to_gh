Keywords: pynac

There are several bugs like:


```
sage: arccoth(float(1.1))
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)
AttributeError: type object 'float' has no attribute 'precision'

The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:

SystemError                               Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-1-96f50dbce315> in <module>()
----> 1 arccoth(float(RealNumber('1.1')))

    993             res = self._evalf_try_(*args)
    994             if res is None:

    996                         *args, coerce=coerce, hold=hold)
    997

    487             res = g_function_evalv(self._serial, vec, hold)
    488         elif self._nargs == 1:
--> 489             res = g_function_eval1(self._serial,
    490                     (<Expression>args[0])._gobj, hold)
    491         elif self._nargs == 2:

SystemError: <built-in function __import__> returned a result with an error set
```


This is due to an unhandled exception elsewhere in `numeric.cpp`.  This is a problem on Python 2 as well, but by luck the exception is cleared later before it becomes a problem (whereas Python 3 is more aggressive in checking for unhandled exceptions when going into a function call).

Typically, pynac releases quickly after a bug-fix so we should wait for that.

Yes, that one is completely different.

Usually we use bug report tickets that are fixed in Pynac for adding doctests but, since it came from a doctest, it's practically a duplicate of a yet-to-be-opened Pynac upgrade ticket. Alternatively, you could add your PR as patch here. The Pynac upgrade will then just remove it.
