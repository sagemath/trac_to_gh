This ticket fixes some errors in Sage 9.4 reference manual arising from recently merged code. This regards
- missing `::` before a doctest block
- incorrect hyperlinks
- docstring started by `"""` instead of `r"""`, so that `\theta` is interpreted by Sphinx as a tabulation + `heta`. 
- an ill-placed `.. NOTE::` (cut-and-paste typo)
