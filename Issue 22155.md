We should have

```
            sage: from sage.rings.asymptotic.asymptotic_ring import AsymptoticRing
            sage: class MyAsymptoticRing(AsymptoticRing):
            ....:     pass
            sage: A = MyAsymptoticRing(growth_group='x^ZZ', coefficient_ring=QQ)

            sage: C = CyclotomicField(3)
            sage: P = C['z']
            sage: type(P(2) * A.gen())
            <class '...MyAsymptoticRing_with_category.element_class'>
```

but the element returned is has type `AsymptoticRing` (without the `My`).
