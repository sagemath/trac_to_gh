The challenge with upgrading Normaliz and PyNormaliz one basically has to rewrite `_cone_from_Vrepresentation_and_Hrepresentation` in `backend_normaliz.py` (and then pickling fails again), as initialization from precomputed data of normaliz cones works a bit different now.

I have mostly figured out how to do this, I think. So unless someone want to, I would like to take care of that part.

`@`Winfried: I'm having trouble with the new version of normaliz for the following reason:

When initializing a cone from precomputed data, it asks me to specify `generated_lattice`. However, sometimes we do not have access to this (e.g. when we want to change backends and have never done the computations in normaliz or when combinatorially obtaining the new double description is much cheaper).

How do I obtain `generated_lattice` from `extreme_rays` and `maximal_subspace`? (Or even as a cone property from any normaliz cone).

I'm puzzled for example how I could obtain the 2-dimensional permutahedron e.g.. The following doesn't seem to work:


```
sage: import PyNormaliz
sage: cone = PyNormaliz.NmzCone(
....:     dehomogenization=[[0, 0, 0, 1]],
....:     extreme_rays=[
....:         [1, 2, 3, 1], [1, 3, 2, 1], [2, 1, 3, 1],
....:         [2, 3, 1, 1], [3, 1, 2, 1], [3, 2, 1, 1]],
....:     generated_lattice=[[1, 0, -1, 0], [0, 1, -1, 0], [0, 0, 6, 1]],
....:     maximal_subspace=[],
....:     support_hyperplanes=[
....:         [-1, -1, 0, 5], [-1, 0, 0, 3], [0, -1, 0, 3],
....:         [0, 1, 0, -1], [1, 0, 0, -1], [1, 1, 0, -3]])
```


It initializes the empty cone for some reason. (At least Dimension of this thing is -1.)

How do I modify the generated lattice to make this work?

I have done a terrible job in commenting this (it took me a while to figure out, why I did this) and you are right, a doctest might make sense.

The question is simply: Is the far face a facet or not? If it is a facet, we need to add an inequality to the normaliz cone. The lines don't make a difference with regard to that question.
