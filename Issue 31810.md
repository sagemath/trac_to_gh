CC:  @darijgr @kliem

Create a module that computes

(1) the kth Elser number of a graph G

(2) the nucleus complex of a graph G for every subset of the vertices

(3) Betti numbers of these complexes

For definitions of these objects, see: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcta.2020.105364

As a side-effect of these computations, also define functions of possible general interest

(4) is_vertex_cover determines if L is a vertex cover of G (returns a boolean)

(5) all connected subgraphs of a graph G

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32047

Some remarks.

Your method `connected_subgraphs_of` suffer several problems.
- It has a strange name : I would simplify to `connected_subgraphs`.
- More importantly, there is an undesirable collision with `connected_subgraph_iterator` where a connected subgraph means a subset of vertices on which the induced graph is connected.
- I would rather implement an iterator rather than returning a list (this is quite standard that Python functions tend to return iterators rather than lists)
- Finally, such function could be optimized a lot using backtracking

Also in `nuclei_by_size`, why do you sort them by size? The size is easily recovered with `len(G)` (which is much faster than `len(G.vertices())`). If you just implement `nuclei` then the dictionary can be reconstructed in two lines

```
sage: G = # whatever
sage: by_size = {i: [] for i in range(len(G))}
sage: for N in G.nuclei(): by_size[len(N)].append(n)
```

Also, if I am not mistaken, to make your sum you don't need that dictionary as the Elser number is

```
return (-1)**(len(G)+1) * sum((-1)**len(N) * len(N)**k for N in G.nuclei())
```

Actually, the connected subgraph part deserves a separate ticket. It's a significant amount of work and it's easier to review / correct / improve smaller tickets.

The difference with `connected_subgraph_iterator` is that you want all connected subgraphs and not only the induced connected subgraphs. So an option could be to add parameter `induced` to `connected_subgraph_iterator`, and then to switch to the appropriate method.
And it's true that `connected_subgraph_iterator` could be renamed `connected_subgraphs`.
