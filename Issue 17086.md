# Issue 17086: Implement "primes_of_bad_reduction" to work over Number Fields

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17323

Original creator: jdefaria

Original creation time: 2014-11-12 17:10:52

The current code uses grobner basis, as such, there is no reason to restrict to QQ and ZZ only

Need to fix merge issues.
1302 - need blank line before example
1331 - trailing white space
1323-1336: code needs optimization

The functionality appears correct.

umm..something is messed up here with the branch. You have only the last two commits. Probably something messed up with the merge. As it is just a few lines to code, it is probably best simply to re-implement them.

A couple things:

- you still need to check if projective space so that this won't run for subschemes

- you can streamline the check for numberfields and number field orders, but just doing the check on the fraction field.

- I'd like to see a comment that differentiates the two methods (number field versus QQ)

This if/else is causing every doctest over QQ or ZZ to fail


```
        if K in NumberFields() and K != QQ:
            F = copy(self)
            F.normalize_coordinates()
            return (K(F.resultant()).support())
        else:
            raise TypeError("Base Ring must be number field or number field ring")
```
