The following should work, but doesn't, because reversion is not lazy enough:

```
sage: L.<t> = LazyPowerSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: f = L.undefined()
sage: f.define(1+(t*f).revert())
```

In this case, `f` should have the coefficients of https://oeis.org/A067145.

This one is harder because of the nature of the tests being done. Nothing can be promised about the coefficients of the undefined series. It comes down to how much we want to promise that the code will not break on bad input. I am thinking we can change

```diff
-        if not coeff_stream[1]:
+        if coeff_stream._approximate_order > 1:
             raise ValueError("compositional inverse does not exist")
-
-        if coeff_stream[0]:
-            raise ValueError("cannot determine whether the compositional inverse exists")
```

Then we run into an issue with computing the exact order in `Stream_cauchy_invert`. So we are doing too many things not lazily enough. (For the invert, we can make `_ainv` a ``@`lazy_attribute` to fix this easily.)

In principle, I think it is more important that `define` works reliably when the input is valid than having helpful error messages.  However, silently wrong output is probably equally bad as failures on good input.

For the issue at hand, I think we can rewrite

```diff
-        # TODO: shift instead of (self / z) should be more efficient
-        g.define(z / ((self / z)(g)))
+        # the following is mathematically equivalent to
+        # z / ((self / z)(g))
+        # but more efficient and more lazy
+        g.define((~self.shift(-1)(g)).shift(1))
```


Here is my thinking:

* in `__invert__`, and `shift(-1)` it is correct to fail on `LazyPowerSeries` with positive valuation (in contrast to `_div_`).  In particular, `f * ~ z` is actually bad input for `LazyPowerSeries`

* I don't see how we can (without great effor) avoid the order computation in `Stream_cauchy_invert.__init__`, when we have no upper bound on the valuation of the input, because it's negative is passed to `super().__init__`.  In our Aldor implementation, Ralf and I created a new domain which allowed computation with "unknowns".  I am not sure whether we want this.

In general, it does not work to access `_approximate_order` in `lazy_series`.  For example, in `LazyLaurentSeries.revert` in line 3790, we had (now commented out)

```
        if coeff_stream._approximate_order > 1:
            raise ValueError("compositional inverse does not exist")
```

This does not work, for example, for

```
sage: L.<t> = LazyLaurentSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: f = L.undefined(valuation=0)
sage: f.define(1+(t*~f).revert())
```

More precisely: the above mentioned access to `_approximate_order` eventually triggers the computation of `(~f)._approximate_order`.  Since `f` is a lazy Laurent series, this triggers the computation of `f.order()`, which fails at this point.

There are two occurrences, in `LazyCauchyProductSeries.__invert__`, `LazyCauchyProductSeries._div_` which I cannot exploit for a failing example, yet.

This is at the beginning of `__invert__`, line 2826-2829:

```
        P = self.parent()
        coeff_stream = self._coeff_stream
        if P._minimal_valuation is not None and coeff_stream._approximate_order > 0:
            raise ZeroDivisionError("cannot divide by a series of positive valuation")
```

and when checking whether to construct a fraction field in `_div_`, line 2988-2994::

```
        if (P._minimal_valuation is not None
            and left._true_order
            and left._approximate_order < right._approximate_order):
            F = P.fraction_field()
            num = F.element_class(F, left)
            den = F.element_class(F, right)
            return num / den
```


I can imagine that both of these are actually OK, but I'd like to see a stringent argument.

I am catching the recursion error now where it first occurs (in `Stream_cauchy_invert`).

This is certainly not optimal, because it will only be triggered when accessing the degree 1 part:

```
sage: L.<z> = LazyLaurentSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: s = L(lambda n: 2 if n == 0 else 3 if n == 1 else 0, valuation=0); s
2 + 3*z + O(z^7)
sage: f = s.revert()
sage: f[0]
0
```

However, I don't see how to make this much better.
