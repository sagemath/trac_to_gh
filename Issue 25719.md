A crystal structure was recently introduced on rigged configurations when the underlying root system is associated to a Borcherds-Cartan matrix.  See http://www.mat.univie.ac.at/~slc/wpapers/FPSAC2018/20-Salisbury-Scrimshaw.pdf.  In particular, this ticket will modify the definition of the crystal operators on rigged configurations so that diagonal entries of the Borcherds-Cartan matrix not equal to 2 will have an appropriate impact on the crystal structure.
