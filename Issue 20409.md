# Issue 20409: gsl and linbox underlinked in sage-7.2

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20646

Original creator: mjo

Original creation time: 2016-05-21 13:33:15

When building sage-7.2 with `LDFLAGS="--as-needed"`, the result is underlinked:


```
from sage.rings.complex_double import CDF
ImportError: /home/mjo/src/sage.git/local/lib/libgsl.so.19: undefined symbol: cblas_sdsdot
```


That first error can be avoided by adding `-lcblas` to the gsl LDFLAGS, but a more intelligent approach is probably provided by this patch:

https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/gentoo.git/tree/sci-libs/gsl/files/gsl-2.1-cblas.patch

After that's fixed...


```
File "sage/libs/linbox/linbox.pxd", line 7, in init sage.matrix.matrix_integer_dense (/home/mjo/src/sage.git/src/build/cythonized/sage/matrix/matrix_integer_dense.c:52635)
ImportError: /home/mjo/src/sage.git/local/lib/liblinboxsage.so.0: undefined symbol: certSolveRedMP
```


That one can be fixed by appending `-liml` to the LDFLAGS for linbox. Appending it to LIBS should work, too.

So should we add `-liml` in LinBox's `spkg-install`?

Or patch LinBox in that way?

FWIW, Sage-on-Gentoo (see:`https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/blob/master/sci-libs/linbox/linbox-1.3.2-r2.ebuild`) does this by appending `-liml` to the `LIBS` variable and not by patching.


---

Comment by leif created at 2016-08-08 19:45:26

Third option:

Add

```
# distutils: libraries = iml
```

to `src/sage/libs/linbox/linbox.pxd`.

That's what I've been doing. But I noticed that the newer version of linbox (https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/tree/master/sci-libs/linbox) doesn't have the same "append-libs" hack, so if it's easier, an upgrade to linbox-1.4.1 probably fixes it as well.

Comment by mjo created at 2016-08-08 19:51:52

On the one hand, it looks like updating linbox will NOT be easier (see ticket #17635); on the other, it looks like a lot of the work has already been done.

I was just going to say that.

#17635 is basically ready, modulo a rebasing and fixing minor platforms (32bit). I'd like to add that `libgsl` is underlinked upstream on purpose. In their opinion it is the responsibility of people downstream or writing their applications to provide a `cblas`.

It is our choice to provide extra linking. In that context I am not sure the gentoo patch as it is the way to go.

The people in the gentoo science overlay (including me) have not drunk the whole Kool-aid of their blas infrastructure when it comes to `gsl`. The reality is `gsl` should be split in `gslcblas` and `libgsl`. Then `libgsl` could just use `pkg-config` to find `cblas`. You still need to remove `libgslcblas.la` everywhere but you avoid adding a custom macro.


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2016-10-22 22:45:09

Is it still relevant now that the new `linbox` stack has been merged.


---

Comment by strogdon created at 2016-10-24 15:34:38

I'm now unable to reproduce any of the issues associated with this ticket. Things implemented:
* export export LDFLAGS="-Wl,--as-needed"
* rebuild (sage -f) `sagelib, gsl, linbox` (`gsl` was probably not necessary)

`sage: from sage.rings.complex_double import CDF`

does not fail and rebuilding `linbox` also rebuilds `iml` and `fflas_ffpack`. I don't know if using `atlas` will be a problem.


---

Comment by mjo created at 2016-10-24 15:46:22

The linbox issue should be gone, but I don't know about gsl. I guess I'll have to recompile from scratch.


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2016-10-24 20:07:19

Well `libgsl.so` is still underlinked as upstream intended, but anything linking to libgsl should also have been properly linked to a cblas library.

Yep, this is what I see. When there is linking with `libgsl.so` there also appears linking to `openblas`. Something like `-lgsl -lm -lopenblas`. And when `atlas` was used in say, `7.4.beta4` the linking would typically appear as `-lgsl ... -lm -latlas -lcblas`. I suspect everything is now OK.

Interesting my install in sage-on-gentoo shows

```
readelf -d /usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/sage/rings/complex_double.so

Dynamic section at offset 0x46c00 contains 29 entries:
  Tag        Type                         Name/Value
 0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libgsl.so.19]
 0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libpari-gmp-2.8.so.0]
 0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libm.so.6]
 0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libopenblas_threads.so.0]
 0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libpython2.7.so.1.0]
 0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libc.so.6]
```

So I have openblas here. It could be a library order problem. When `complex_double.so` is linked, is `-lopenblas` before `-lgsl`? Since this is a shared library it is legal to underlink. May be you should try a build with `-Wl,--no-undefined` to catch funny stuff.

Hum my own log for vanilla 7.4 show that the order is correct at least here

This is what I've got in my sagelib log:


```
gcc -pthread -shared -L/home/mjo/src/sage.git/local/lib -Wl,-rpath,/home/mjo/src/sage.git/local/lib -Wl,-O1 -Wl,--as-needed -L/home/mjo/src/sage.git/local/lib -Wl,-rpath,/home/mjo/src/sage.git/local/lib -Wl,-O1 -Wl,--as-needed -march=native -O2 -pipe build/temp.linux-x86_64-2.7/home/mjo/src/sage.git/src/build/cythonized/sage/rings/complex_double.o -L/home/mjo/src/sage.git/local/lib -L/home/mjo/src/sage.git/local/lib -lgsl -lpari -lgmp -lm -lopenblas -lpython2.7 -o build/lib.linux-x86_64-2.7/sage/rings/complex_double.so -lpari -Ddummy
```


The difference that stands out to me is `--as-needed`... won't it refuse to link OpenBLAS into the result if `complex_double.so` fails to use its symbols directly?

but shouldn't the linking be with `g++`?

Comment by mjo created at 2016-10-30 23:09:35

I'm also using gold instead of the default BFD linker, if that turns out to matter. On gentoo the switch amounts to


```
$ sudo binutils-config --linker ld.gold
```



---

Comment by strogdon created at 2016-10-30 23:47:05

Rebuilt `sagelib` here using `LDFLAGS=-Wl,-O1 -Wl,--as-needed` instead of `LDFLAGS=-Wl,--as-needed`, just in case; still no issue. I am using gentoo default BFD linker.

It usually does with matter regarding `--as-needed` in my experience.


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2016-11-01 08:44:19

Somehow I had another comment that escaped posting :( The gold linker has a more strict interpretation of `--as-needed` and in this case `libgsl` would need to be linked to `cblas` itself.

It could be interesting to try adding `-Wl,--no-allow-shlib-undefined` as an additional `LDFLAGS`.

I didn't notice anything different, with a clean build of 7.5.beta1, it dies when it tries to build the docs at the end of compilation:


```
$ LDFLAGS="-Wl,-O1 -Wl,--as-needed -Wl,--no-allow-shlib-undefined" CFLAGS="${CFLAGS}" make -j4
...

Makefile:1063: recipe for target 'doc-html' failed
```


I don't see anything unusual in that same spot in the sagelib build log either, but I don't really know what I'm looking for. I think the additional linker flag should have made it fail?


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2016-11-01 20:45:51

Failure to link would have been my minimal expectation.

So the option we have:
 * link `libgsl.so` to the selected cblas (openblas or atlas) when it is built.
 * add a `-Wl,--no-as-needed` flag to all files linking to `libgsl.so` in the sage library.

The first one may be achieved by adding

```
LIBS=`pkg-config --libs-only-l cblas`
```

to the configure line of `gsl`'s spkg-install. I think.

The second one may be achievable by alteration of `gsl.pc` by manually adding the flag we want. Possibly by patching `gsl.pc.in` before building `gsl`.

Pick your poison.


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2016-11-01 20:49:30

Hum, `$(BLAS)` is currently in `gsl`'s dependency but is not in fact used.


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2016-11-01 20:58:58


```
./configure --prefix="$SAGE_LOCAL" --libdir="$SAGE_LOCAL/lib" \
   LIBS="`pkg-config --libs-only-l cblas` -lm"
```

`-lm` is needed for some reason. Possibly setting `LIBS` interferes with it being added, `libopenblas.so` is certainly properly linked to it.

Do you think the order of where `-lm` appears is important? I always see `-lgsl ... -lm -lopenblas ...` in the `sagelib` log. I'm not sure where the order is set.


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2016-11-01 22:12:55

I don't think the order is important in that case, because openblas doesn't need it according to ldd and readelf. It certainly would be important if libopenblas wasn't linked to libm. Then it would have to be after. And even so, with gold, if the stuff you link doesn't use libm directly, it won't appear in the final shared object and you will be in the same situation as with gsl needing cblas.

It seems to me that altering the `gsl.pc` file is like a SoG build with `USE=cblas-external`. And this approach will require a change in the configure of `gsl` resulting in increased package maintenance on the Sage end. But doing it would remove undefined `cblas` symbols in `libgsl`.

When I first encountered this, I thought the fact that GSL wasn't linked to CBLAS was a bug, but then you pointed out that upstream leaves it that way on purpose. What's the benefit of doing so in Sage, where we know that everything is going to transitively link to the same CBLAS anyway?

Requiring consumers to fill in your missing symbols still seems backwards to me, but I don't want to judge it wrong too quickly.


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2016-11-03 03:13:33

`@` Steve adding -lopenblas won't work. It is not the only thing we do.

`@` mjo, underlinking is legal but no distro leave it way I think. The wheels come of for shared objects such as those used by python, bfd linker does ok but gold doesn't want to cater to that case I think. Not their goal. I'd rather link gsl in sage, the dependency is there already.

If there are no hidden pitfalls, then this is simple and unobtrusive and has my vote.

The way I outlined is indeed simple and not intrusive. Downside, `libgslcblas.so` is probably unusable. Not sure we care that much, but there should be a warning somewhere.

In concrete terms I am not sure which cblas you are getting when linking with it.

With my default BFD linker and extra linker flags `-Wl,-O1 -Wl,--as-needed` I have no linking to `cblas`.

Probably a bad manipulation on my part then. It will be present for people not using `--as-needed` though. I'll post a branch later. I may also revamp the description a bit.

I think this fixes things

```
readelf -d local/lib/libgsl.so

Dynamic section at offset 0x23ab08 contains 28 entries:
  Tag        Type                         Name/Value
 0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libopenblas.so.0]
 0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libm.so.6]
 0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libc.so.6]
 0x000000000000000e (SONAME)             Library soname: [libgsl.so.19]
 0x000000000000001d (RUNPATH)            Library runpath: [/64bitdev/storage/sage-git_develop/sage/local/lib]
```

with `--as-needed` added to `LDFLAGS`. But I was wrong before, so `@`mjo (Michael) should probably push the button since I don't use the offending `gold` linker.

Looks good, and I even remembered to run it this time. Thanks!
