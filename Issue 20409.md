```
When building sage-7.2 with `LDFLAGS="--as-needed"`, the result is underlinked:


```
from sage.rings.complex_double import CDF
ImportError: /home/mjo/src/sage.git/local/lib/libgsl.so.19: undefined symbol: cblas_sdsdot
```


That first error can be avoided by adding `-lcblas` to the gsl LDFLAGS, but a more intelligent approach is probably provided by this patch:

https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/gentoo.git/tree/sci-libs/gsl/files/gsl-2.1-cblas.patch

After that's fixed...


```
File "sage/libs/linbox/linbox.pxd", line 7, in init sage.matrix.matrix_integer_dense (/home/mjo/src/sage.git/src/build/cythonized/sage/matrix/matrix_integer_dense.c:52635)
ImportError: /home/mjo/src/sage.git/local/lib/liblinboxsage.so.0: undefined symbol: certSolveRedMP
```


That one can be fixed by appending `-liml` to the LDFLAGS for linbox. Appending it to LIBS should work, too.

So should we add `-liml` in LinBox's `spkg-install`?

Or patch LinBox in that way?

FWIW, Sage-on-Gentoo (see:`https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/blob/master/sci-libs/linbox/linbox-1.3.2-r2.ebuild`) does this by appending `-liml` to the `LIBS` variable and not by patching.

It is our choice to provide extra linking. In that context I am not sure the gentoo patch as it is the way to go.

I'm now unable to reproduce any of the issues associated with this ticket. Things implemented:
* export export LDFLAGS="-Wl,--as-needed"
* rebuild (sage -f) `sagelib, gsl, linbox` (`gsl` was probably not necessary)

`sage: from sage.rings.complex_double import CDF`

does not fail and rebuilding `linbox` also rebuilds `iml` and `fflas_ffpack`. I don't know if using `atlas` will be a problem.

Somehow I had another comment that escaped posting :( The gold linker has a more strict interpretation of `--as-needed` and in this case `libgsl` would need to be linked to `cblas` itself.

It could be interesting to try adding `-Wl,--no-allow-shlib-undefined` as an additional `LDFLAGS`.

I didn't notice anything different, with a clean build of 7.5.beta1, it dies when it tries to build the docs at the end of compilation:


```
$ LDFLAGS="-Wl,-O1 -Wl,--as-needed -Wl,--no-allow-shlib-undefined" CFLAGS="${CFLAGS}" make -j4
...

Makefile:1063: recipe for target 'doc-html' failed
```


I don't see anything unusual in that same spot in the sagelib build log either, but I don't really know what I'm looking for. I think the additional linker flag should have made it fail?

Failure to link would have been my minimal expectation.

So the option we have:
* link `libgsl.so` to the selected cblas (openblas or atlas) when it is built.
* add a `-Wl,--no-as-needed` flag to all files linking to `libgsl.so` in the sage library.

The first one may be achieved by adding

```
LIBS=`pkg-config --libs-only-l cblas`
```

to the configure line of `gsl`'s spkg-install. I think.

The second one may be achievable by alteration of `gsl.pc` by manually adding the flag we want. Possibly by patching `gsl.pc.in` before building `gsl`.

Pick your poison.

Do you think the order of where `-lm` appears is important? I always see `-lgsl ... -lm -lopenblas ...` in the `sagelib` log. I'm not sure where the order is set.

It seems to me that altering the `gsl.pc` file is like a SoG build with `USE=cblas-external`. And this approach will require a change in the configure of `gsl` resulting in increased package maintenance on the Sage end. But doing it would remove undefined `cblas` symbols in `libgsl`.

When I first encountered this, I thought the fact that GSL wasn't linked to CBLAS was a bug, but then you pointed out that upstream leaves it that way on purpose. What's the benefit of doing so in Sage, where we know that everything is going to transitively link to the same CBLAS anyway?

I think this fixes things

```
readelf -d local/lib/libgsl.so

Dynamic section at offset 0x23ab08 contains 28 entries:
  Tag        Type                         Name/Value
 0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libopenblas.so.0]

with `--as-needed` added to `LDFLAGS`. But I was wrong before, so `@`mjo (Michael) should probably push the button since I don't use the offending `gold` linker.
