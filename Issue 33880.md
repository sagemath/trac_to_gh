With Sage 9.6 on macOS 11.6.5, I get:

```
sage: K = CyclotomicField(5)
sage: A = matrix(K, [[1, 2], [3, 4]])
sage: A.charpoly()
[...]
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred.
```
This problem seems specific to `CyclotomicFields` and does not occur for `QuadraticFields` or even `NumberFields` that are obviously isomorphic to a `CyclotomicField`. There is specialized code in the cyclotomic case, in `sage.matrix.matrix_cyclo_dense.pyx:_charpoly_multimodular`:

```
sage: K = CyclotomicField(5)
sage: A = matrix(K, [[1, 2], [3, 4]])
sage: A._charpoly_multimodular()
[...]
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred.
```


This problem does not occur with Sage 9.6 on Linux, but does manifest in Sage 9.5 on macOS.

This crash occurs in primecount.  A stack trace is shown below.

Indeed, on both Sage 9.6 and 9.7.beta3 the following command produces a segfault:

```
sage: prime_pi(5)
```

(EDITED) Also, passing a large value to prime_pi does not produce a segfault, as one might guess from the fact that the crash occurs in pi_cache"


```
sage: prime_pi(1000000)
78498
```

According to the "Counting Primes" documentation page:\\
  Dima Pasechnik (2021): removed buggy cython code, replaced it with calls to\\
  primecount/primecountpy spkg

In order to obtain the stack trace below I patched cysignals to make it not catch the SIG_SEGV signal.  While I agree with all of the invective in the cysignals code about how Apple screwed things up by requiring extra permissions to use a debugger, I do not agree with the way cysignals handled this screw-up.  While it is not possible for sage to run gdb to generate a stack trace after a segfualt, if the segfault is processed by Apple's handler, instead of cysignals' no-op handler, at least a crash dump is logged (sometimes).  An unreliable crash dump is a huge improvement over an immediate exit with no information.  So I think cysignals should stop handling SIG_SEGV on macOS.

In `PiTable.cpp` the static table PiTable::pi_t is a

```
/// Compressed PrimePi(x) lookup table for x < 64 * 240.
```

I note that 64*240 = 15360 lies between 15000 and 16000.  So it would appear that any lookup into that table produces a segfault.

I also notice that the signature of py_cache allows passing negative indices into the table.

```
int64_t pi_cache(int64_t x, bool print = is_print());
```

Of course passing a negative value would produce a segfault regardless of the signature.
However I notice that any negative value, even one with large absolute value like -1000000, produces a segfault.  So that suggests that all negative values are used directly as indices into the pi_cache table without checking the sign.  That seems unwise.

As I said, the build for the Sage_macOS binary distribution is very careful to use NO external libraries whatsoever.  Both primecount and primesieve and everything else, including gfortran, is built from source as provided in the Sage repository.

```

```
sage % cat build/pkgs/primesieve/package-version.txt

They do link against `libc++`, so conceivably that could be a homebrew version rather than the system one.  With Marc's build, I see:

```
$ otool -L libprimecount.dylib
libprimecount.dylib:
	@rpath/libprimecount.7.1.dylib (compatibility version 7.0.0, current version 7.1.0)
	@rpath/libprimesieve.9.dylib (compatibility version 9.0.0, current version 9.6.0)
	/usr/lib/libc++.1.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1200.3.0)
	/usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1311.0.0)
```
