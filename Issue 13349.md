Assignee: jason, was

CC:  @kcrisman

Keywords: plot bessel

The `Bessel` class defined its own plot method which is called e.g. when you run


```
sage: plot(Bessel(0,'J'), 0, 10)
```


but it doesn't pass along extra keyword parameters to the top-level plot function:


```
sage: plot(Bessel(0,'J'),0,10,color='red')
TypeError: plot() got an unexpected keyword argument 'rgbcolor'
```
