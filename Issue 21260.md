In the following example, the modular symbols are cuspidal but Sage says that they are not:

```
sage: M = ModularSymbols(Gamma0(3),weight=22,sign=1)
sage: N = next(S for S in M.decomposition(anemic=False) if S.hecke_matrix(3).trace()==-128844)
sage: N.is_cuspidal()
True
sage: [g.is_cuspidal() for g in N.gens()]
[False, False]
```

It seems that the underlying issue is that the code checks whether `g` is cuspidal by checking whether `g==M.cuspidal_submodule()(g)`.  This test returns false because Sage can't find a common parent of `N` and `M.cuspidal_submodule()`.

It should be
