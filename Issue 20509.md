Isn't it a bit drastic to declare `AA` to be the pushout rather than to create a suitable number field?  I think a better solution would be to use the existing `composite_fields()` method, which respects embeddings:

```diff
--- a/src/sage/rings/number_field/number_field_base.pyx
+++ b/src/sage/rings/number_field/number_field_base.pyx
@@ -350,3 +350,7 @@ cdef class NumberField(Field):

+        if (isinstance(other, NumberField) and self._embedded_real and
+            (<NumberField>other)._embedded_real):

```

This makes the examples in the current branch work just as well (you can see the numerical values after coercing into `AA`).

```

This coercion has its advantages:

- makes it possible to do arithmetic operations with elements with two different `NumberFields` as parents. Right now returns a TypeError:


```
    sage: J = NumberField(x^2 - 2,'s')
    sage: s = J.gens()[0]
    sage: K = NumberField(x^3 - 2,'t')
    sage: t = K.gens()[0]
    sage: s * t
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for *: ...
```

- It is lazy, it does have to compute the join.

Depending on the usage, one may want to get the join of the fields using `composite_field`, this introduces another variable and is order dependant. I guess that if one wants to do computations on the long run with that field, one would already use the right field from start.

IMHO, this ticket already fixes an operation that one would naturally want to have at hand. So, I would make this a positive review.
