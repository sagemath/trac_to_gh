```

sage: x = PolynomialRing(QQ,'x').gen()
sage: f = Piecewise([[(-2, 2), 2 * x^0]])
sage: g = Piecewise([[(0, 2), 3/4 * x^0]])
sage: n = f.convolution(g)

sage: n
Piecewise defined function with 3 parts, [[(-2, 0), 3/2*x + 3], [(0, 2), 6], [(2, 4), -3/2*x + 6]]
```

But the middle piece should be 3, not 6, apparently.

See the original report at [this ask.sagemath.org question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/965/convolution-got-the-wrong-result).

The fix is to fix the following

```
    cmd1 = "integrate((%s)*(%s),%s,%s,%s)"%(i1,i2, uu, a1,    tt-b1)    ## if a1+b1 < tt < a2+b1
    cmd2 = "integrate((%s)*(%s),%s,%s,%s)"%(i1,i2, uu, tt-b2, tt-b1)    ## if a1+b2 < tt < a2+b1
    cmd3 = "integrate((%s)*(%s),%s,%s,%s)"%(i1,i2, uu, tt-b2, a2)       ## if a1+b2 < tt < a2+b2
    cmd4 = "integrate((%s)*(%s),%s,%s,%s)"%(i1,i2, uu, a1, a2)          ## if a2+b1 < tt < a1+b2
    <snip>
    if a1-b1<a2-b2:
        if a2+b1!=a1+b2:
           h = Piecewise([[(a1+b1,a1+b2),fg1],[(a1+b2,a2+b1),fg4],[(a2+b1,a2+b2),fg3]])
```

to have `f2` instead of `f4`. There is a parallel part as well in the other branch of the if, where `fg2` should be `fg4`, it appears.

This should be fixed quickly, but should also be checked to make sure it really does do the right thing! The code is not really commented enough to show what is going on with all these different mini-convolutions, one has to really think about it.

The two curve parts before addition look like this
<img src="http://s18.postimg.org/uptxg06pl/tmp_hd_MODX.png" 300px>
A working implementation should make sure that, when they are added, only three intervals remain.

```
sage: f = Piecewise([[(0, 1), -1/2*x^2 + x],[(1, 2), 1/2],[(2, 3), 1/2*x^2 - 3*x + 9/2]])
sage: g = Piecewise([[(-1, 0), 1/2*x^2 + x + 1/2],[(0, 1), 1/2],[(1, 2), -1/2*x^2 + x]])
sage: f+g
Piecewise defined function with 4 parts, [[(-1, 0), 1/2*x^2 + x + 1/2], [(0, 1), -1/2*x^2 + x + 1/2], [(1, 2), -1/2*x^2 + x + 1/2], [(2, 3), 1/2*x^2 - 3*x + 9/2]]
