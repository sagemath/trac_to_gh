# Issue 18555: side effect from Pari verbose mechanism in factor()

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: zimmerma

Original creation time: 2015-06-26 12:01:13

I did try to factor some large integer with `factor(n, 8)`, and since it did not succeed I did abort with Ctrl-C.

After that, with `is_prime(p)` for some (say) 20-digit prime p, I had plenty of verbose message from Pari.

I guess Pari uses some global variable for the verbose level, which is not properly restored in case of Ctrl-C.

I was not able to reproduce the problem, but maybe someone will.

I guess you meant `factor(n, verbose=8)`??

yes sorry. Here is how to reproduce:

sage: factor(2^512-1, verbose=8)
<abort by Ctrl-C>
sage: is_prime(14666663183052632232119)
