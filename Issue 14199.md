see [sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/71d76cd072fe17eb?hl=en).
Not good:

```
sage: a=matrix([[x,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0],[0,0,1,0],[0,0,0,1]])
sage: charpoly(a)
0
```

Also not good

```
sage: var('y')
sage: b=matrix([[y^(1/2),0,0,0],[0,1,0,0],[0,0,1,0],[0,0,0,1]]) 
sage: charpoly(b)
Error
```

Both can be solved by doing something more along the lines of

```
V=SR('crazy_varname')
cp=self._maxima_(maxima).charpoly('crazy_varname')._sage_().expand()
SR[var](list(cp.coefficient(V,i) for i in range(self.nrows()+1))) 
```

in `a.charpoly`.

OK, here is an attempt to address this.

I modified the `charpoly` method to always use a unique variable name. I found no ready-to-use utility function to achieve this, but I expect there might be, so if you know one please let me know and I'll update my code. So far I simply append numbers to the letter `x` until the resulting string is not among the list of variable names used inside the matrix. The resulting variable name will *always* be used for the cached polynomial, and will *by default* be used for the returned polynomial.

If the caller overrides the variable name, there is no check to ensure that this name does not conflict with the names used in the matrix. I'm unsure myself whether I'd consider this behavior a bug or a feature, i.e. what intended behavior for that case should be. If you want I can add a piece of code to perform that check before the `change_variable_name` call, and throw an error on conflicting variable names.

I've kept the `expression.polynomial(None, ring=SR[var])` approach, and not used the `expression.coefficient(var, i)` version suggested in the ticket report. Instead, I adjusted the conversion of expressions to polynomials to only treat those variable powers as possible monomials where the variable itself corresponds to one of the variables from the target ring. All other expressions are treated as coefficients, even if they are powers of a symbolic variable. This avoids the conversion to integers for these cases, and hence the error mentioned in the ticket. This fix might be useful to other applications as well.

There is in fact a way to generate unique variable names; just call `SR.symbol()`. This will ensure that there are no collisions.

That's true, but that generates ugly symbol names, which might be confusing to read in a long characteristic polynomial. I like the solution proposed in the patch a little better. For example, here is what I get from `SR.symbol()`

```
sage: SR.symbol()
symbol160
sage: SR.symbol()
symbol163
sage: SR.symbol()
symbol166
```

Is there some general way of asking for the "next" symbol given some pattern? Essentially, emulating what a part of this patch does. Something which behaves like this:

```
sage: SR.next_variable('x') # suppose x, x0, x1 are already defined
x2
sage: SR.next_variable('x2')
x3
sage: SR.next_variable('x0y') # suppose that x0y is not yet defined.
x0y
```

I must confess I don't understand the difference. In my understanding, both the approach via `coefficients` and the one via `expression.polynomial` are intended to turn an expression representation of a polynomial into an element of the polynomial ring. I don't see *why* there is a difference in performance or robustness, but I can at least confirm a quite significant difference in performance.

Someone who does please confirm my assumption. Sounds like there were a central store of assigned variables, which I hadn't anticipated. Haven't looked at the SR sources yet.

In my setup, the variable name only depends on the matrix itself, not on any symbols used in other parts of the code, and more importantly not on the order in which characteristic polynomials are computed. I thought of trying a list of well-known symbol names first, like `['x', 'y', 'z', 't', 'mu']`, but decided against it for now since it doesn't seem worth the effort.

There is no strong reason to use the same name in the maxima computation and for the symbolic ring. The original ticket used `'crazy_varname'` for one and `var` for the other. On the other hand, I don't feel like relying on the fact that `'crazy_varname'` will be unlikely to occur in the matrix. I feel safer using a variable name which is certainly unique.

My patch keeps the improvements for the `expression.polynomial(…)` method. Even if `charpoly` does not depend on it, being able to correctly convert a larger number of use cases seems worthwhile. If you'd prefer that as a separate commit, please let me know.

Just look up the source code of `expression.polynomial`; you'll quickly see it's not a routine you want to call unless you really have to. The difference is that we already know with respect to which variable we want to collect the terms. The routine `polynomial` tries to recognize the thing as a polynomial in whatever variables (hence the problems with `y^(1/2)`)

>  Sounds like there were a central store of assigned variables, which I hadn't anticipated. Haven't looked at the SR sources yet.

Correct. This is the case in both maxima and in SR and necessarily permanently so in the translation layer between them (we cannot monitor the lifetime in both simultaneously)

> There is no strong reason to use the same name in the maxima computation and for the symbolic ring. The original ticket used `'crazy_varname'` for one and `var` for the other. On the other hand, I don't feel like relying on the fact that `'crazy_varname'` will be unlikely to occur in the matrix.

How about `do_not_use_this_name_in_a_matrix_youll_compute_a_charpol_of` then? It saves you digging through all the variables occurring in the matrix unnecessarily.

> I feel safer using a variable name which is certainly unique. And if I do the work to find such a vriable name, I might as well use the same for the computation in maxima and for the presentation as a polynomial. After all, *always* using `x` as the variable name by default feels plain wrong if the matrix itself does contain an `x`. That kind of overloading is bound to cause confusion.

For me, explicit is better than implicit: If I'm going to do something with a charpol, I need to know in what variable it has been expressed, so the system choosing a relatively unpredictable name is no good.

For one thing, one might expect that

```
charpol(A)*charpol(B) == charpol(block_diagonal(A,B))
```

but that's not necessarily the case if sage varies the default variable name used.

The reason why I'd have considered `polynomial` to be potentially faster than the approach based on `coefficient` is that the former has to traverse the expression only once, whereas the latter has to do one pass per power.\n\n> How about `do_not_use_this_name_in_a_matrix_youll_compute_a_charpol_of` then? It saves you digging through all the variables occurring in the matrix unnecessarily.\n\nPossible for the computation, but we very certainly don't want this variable occuring in the result. Since I still maintain that we have to find a unique and readable name for the generator of the polynomial ring for the result, would there be any win in always using this name for the computation? Would this reduce memory leaks? I guess it might, so I'll include this in my next patch, but I'll wait for some answers to questions below first.\n\n> For me, explicit is better than implicit: If I'm going to do something with a charpol, I need to know in what variable it has been expressed, so the system choosing a relatively unpredictable name is no good.\n\nI disagree. The explicit approach is always possible, i.e. you can always specify the variable name in the invocation. But if you only want to have a look at the polynomial, it doesn't matter that much what the variable is, as long as you can recognize it and can distinguish it from other variables. And if you want to do some subsequent computation, chances are that you don't care for the name of the variable at all, but only for the list of coefficients.\n\n> For one thing, one might expect that\n> {{{\n> charpol(A)*charpol(B) == charpol(block_diagonal(A,B))\n> }}}\n> but that's not necessarily the case if sage varies the default variable name used.\n\nI don't think I'd share that expectation. What I'd expect is\n\n```\nA.charpoly('t')*B.charpoly('t') == block_diagonal(A, B).charpoly('t')\n```\n\ni.e. if you explicitely name the variable, then the polynomials should agree. If you don't name the variable, and the default name of `x` appears in one of the matrices but not the other, then raising an error instead would be acceptable to me, like what my patch would cause:\n\n```\nTypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for '*': 'Univariate Polynomial Ring in\nx1 over Symbolic Ring' and 'Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Symbolic Ring'\n```\n\n\nWhat exactly is it you propose for the visible result of this method, when called without a variable name?\n\n* If you want a default of `x` in all cases, then you accept strange cases where the printed result will contain two flavors of `x`, one the generator of the polynomial and the other a variable from the symbolic ring. I consider this highly confusing. And it might cause even more trouble later on, particularly if this polynomial would get passed to some other system in text form, where the distinction would get lost.\n* If you want the `do_not_use\u2026` name to leak into the result, reading the polynomial directly would be a real pain.\n* If you want to raise an exception whenever `x` occurs in the matrix, I'd consider this unneccessarily annoying. Particularly for cases where the user didn't call `charpoly` directly, but some other computation uses it.\n* If you want to have an automatically chosen and non-conflicting name, then this would be something along the lines I proposed, so any important difference in what you have in mind to what I did should be made more explicit.",

> The routine `polynomial` tries to recognize the thing as a polynomial in whatever variables (hence the problems with `y^(1/2)`)

Not with my modification, but the speed difference remains. The reason why I'd have considered `polynomial` to be potentially faster than the approach based on `coefficient` is that the former has to traverse the expression only once, whereas the latter has to do one pass per power.

> How about `do_not_use_this_name_in_a_matrix_youll_compute_a_charpol_of` then? It saves you digging through all the variables occurring in the matrix unnecessarily.

Possible for the computation, but we very certainly don't want this variable occuring in the result. Since I still maintain that we have to find a unique and readable name for the generator of the polynomial ring for the result, would there be any win in always using this name for the computation? Would this reduce memory leaks? I guess it might, so I'll include this in my next patch, but I'll wait for some answers to questions below first.

> For me, explicit is better than implicit: If I'm going to do something with a charpol, I need to know in what variable it has been expressed, so the system choosing a relatively unpredictable name is no good.

I disagree. The explicit approach is always possible, i.e. you can always specify the variable name in the invocation. But if you only want to have a look at the polynomial, it doesn't matter that much what the variable is, as long as you can recognize it and can distinguish it from other variables. And if you want to do some subsequent computation, chances are that you don't care for the name of the variable at all, but only for the list of coefficients.

> For one thing, one might expect that
> {{{

I don't think I'd share that expectation. What I'd expect is

```
A.charpoly('t')*B.charpoly('t') == block_diagonal(A, B).charpoly('t')
```

i.e. if you explicitely name the variable, then the polynomials should agree. If you don't name the variable, and the default name of `x` appears in one of the matrices but not the other, then raising an error instead would be acceptable to me, like what my patch would cause:

```
TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for '*': 'Univariate Polynomial Ring in
x1 over Symbolic Ring' and 'Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Symbolic Ring'
```


What exactly is it you propose for the visible result of this method, when called without a variable name?

* If you want a default of `x` in all cases, then you accept strange cases where the printed result will contain two flavors of `x`, one the generator of the polynomial and the other a variable from the symbolic ring. I consider this highly confusing. And it might cause even more trouble later on, particularly if this polynomial would get passed to some other system in text form, where the distinction would get lost.
* If you want the `do_not_use…` name to leak into the result, reading the polynomial directly would be a real pain.
* If you want to raise an exception whenever `x` occurs in the matrix, I'd consider this unneccessarily annoying. Particularly for cases where the user didn't call `charpoly` directly, but some other computation uses it.
* If you want to have an automatically chosen and non-conflicting name, then this would be something along the lines I proposed, so any important difference in what you have in mind to what I did should be made more explicit.

Indeed, `x`, because that is already the default in sage anyway.

```
sage: P.<x>=QQ[]
sage: M=matrix(2,2,[x,1,1,x])
sage: M.charpoly()
x^2 - 2*x*x + x^2 - 1
```

You'd have to come up with a naming solution that works across sage structures, which sounds pretty hopeless to me.

It should definitely not leak! Then it can find its way back into a matrix and cause real havoc.

Exactly. I agree.

I think choosing a non-conflicting name is too difficult and confusing (since the problem is not confined to just SR), so I'd accept a default that likely clashes as the best compromise. Conversion to other systems is indeed dangerous: don't do that :-).

How many rings are there? How many of them have elements which you can name? While I agree that this might require considerable effort, I do have hope and would consider such an endeavour worthwhile.

FWIW, I agree with Nils that it is""common sense" to use a standard variable name. There is no need to complicate the implementation by searching for variables.

If we decide to use a new variable name, the procedure to do this should be constant time. Enumerating variables in a matrix/ring and finding a new name is too complicated.
