- in the terminal, viewing graphics silently does nothing

```
sage: polytopes.cube().show()
Launched html viewer for Graphics3d Object
sage: polytopes.regular_polygon(5).show()
Launched png viewer for Graphics object consisting of 7 graphics primitives
```


- (from #33103#comment:31) the configuration of VS Code (from #30677) should be improved. It seems to start up using the wrong interpreter (not `venv/bin/python3`), and also one needs to manually select the right Jupyter kernel.

- The scipy folks have some good documentation and configuration (â€‹https://scipy.github.io/devdocs/dev/contributor/quickstart_gitpod.html), perhaps we can lift something from there.

Ticket branches are often based on an older beta version. Given that we build on top of the Docker image for the current beta version (`dev`), shouldn't we attempt to merge the branch into the base of the Docker image and build that?

Isn't this what the prebuild at gitpod is essentially doing?

No, it's not merging. It's building the top of the branch.

Then I don't understand what you mean. The docker image used by gitpod is the same for all branches.

Yes, it is, and it is based on the latest beta.

The branch that is being tested, however, may be based on a much older beta. When building this branch, it will downgrade packages to the versions recorded in that older beta.

Yes, that's the current behavior, right? So what are you proposing to improve there?

As I said in comment:18, to merge the current branch into the branch from which the Docker image has been built.

So you want to merge the `develop` branch into the branch that is open in gitpod?

Note also that gitpod prebuild the branch when a new commit arrives. Thus the docker image used is the one that had been published when the branch had its last commit.

Technically not the `develop` branch but the ref from which the Docker image has been built. Most of the times, that's the same.

Yes, that's fine.
