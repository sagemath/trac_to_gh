```
sage: integral(sqrt(x-1)*sqrt(1/x-1/4))
integrate(sqrt(x - 1)*sqrt(1/x - 1/4), x)

sage: integrate(sqrt(-1/4*x^2 + 5/4*x - 1)/x^2)
-sqrt(-1/4*x^2 + 5/4*x - 1)/x + 1/2*arcsin(-2/3*x + 5/3) + 5/8*arcsin(5/3*x/abs(x) - 8/3/abs(x))

I believe this description is wrong, as 

`sqrt(x-1)*sqrt(1/x-1/4)`

is **not** equal to (note the `x^2` outside of the square root)

`sqrt(-1/4*x^2 + 5/4*x - 1)/x^2`

but it is equal to

`sqrt((-1/4*x^2 + 5/4*x - 1)/x)`

where `x` is inside the square root (and not the other way around).

According to Mathematica, `sqrt(x-1)*sqrt(1/x-1/4)` integrates to a complicated function that involves elliptic integrals.

That's right. Elliptic E and F functions with argument containing inverse trig function may already appear as solution to `integral(1/sqrt(a+b*x^3), x)`.

Changing keywords from "" to "integral".

Setting new milestone based on a cursory review of ticket status, priority, and last modification date.
