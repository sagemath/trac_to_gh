one can create `PermutationGroup_generic_with_category` acting on a domain with 0, but creating its individual elements (moving 0) is broken.

It was not a meaningful error report. The command `PermutationGroupElement("(0,2)")` is not working (as expected). And it has nothing to do with the computation of automorphism group of graphs.

there was some code, meaningful or not, that used to produce errors.

are these errors fixed?
