LGTM except you have one doctest failure:

```
src/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/isogeny_class.py
```

due to this change:

```diff
@@ -798,7 +798,7 @@ class IsogenyClass_EC_NumberField(IsogenyClass_EC):
             sys.stdout.flush()
         isogenies = E.isogenies_prime_degree(degs, minimal_models=self._minimal_models)
         if verbose:
-            sys.stdout.write(" -actual isogeny degrees: %s" % Set([phi.degree() for phi in isogenies]))
+            sys.stdout.write(" -actual isogeny degrees: %s" % set(phi.degree() for phi in isogenies))
             sys.stdout.flush()
         # Add all new codomains to the list and collect degrees:
         curves = [E]
```

I would just let it use `Set` for the error message for the better formatting.
