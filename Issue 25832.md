LGTM except you have one doctest failure:

```
src/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/isogeny_class.py
```

due to this change:

```diff
@@ -798,7 +798,7 @@ class IsogenyClass_EC_NumberField(IsogenyClass_EC):
             sys.stdout.flush()

I would just let it use `Set` for the error message for the better formatting.
