Likely since #31716,

```
P = Frac(ZZ['x,y'])
a = P(1/2)
ZZ(a)
```

raises an `ArithmeticError` (instead of a `TypeError` before), so that `a in P` fails.

Your diagnosis is correct. I would argue that the `ArithmeticError` should be raised in more situations when something is not a unit (a la `inverse_of_unit()`). Anyways, LGTM.
