# Issue 31841: `a in P` broken for some FractionFieldElements

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32078

Original creator: mmezzarobba

Original creation time: 2021-06-28 19:48:02

Likely since #31716,

```
P = Frac(ZZ['x,y'])
a = P(1/2)
ZZ(a)
```

raises an `ArithmeticError` (instead of a `TypeError` before), so that `a in P` fails.

Your diagnosis is correct. I would argue that the `ArithmeticError` should be raised in more situations when something is not a unit (a la `inverse_of_unit()`). Anyways, LGTM.
