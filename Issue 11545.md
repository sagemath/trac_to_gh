I do not really understand why, but the initialization of *sage.schemes.generic.scheme* takes a bit to run:


```
$ time ./sage --startuptime|grep ' scheme:'
         scheme: 0.027 (spec)
```


The attached patch improves this:

```
$ time ./sage --startuptime|grep ' scheme:'
         scheme: 0.000 (spec)
```


The overall improvement is, of course, relatively small:

```
$ time for in in `seq 100`;do ./sage --startuptime>/dev/null;done
real    1m28.181s
```

vs.

```
$ time for in in `seq 100`;do ./sage --startuptime>/dev/null;done
real    1m27.629s
```
