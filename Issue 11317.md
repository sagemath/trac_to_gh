The html <iframe> pair is a quick way to imbed a web page into Sage.  A new python function iframe(url) would make it easier (and cleaner) to bring existing web pages into a Sage notebook.  This started as a why to bring GeoGegbra worksheets into Sage, but in fact it could be used for other web based software.
