# Issue 11317: iframe command

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/11489

Keywords: geogebra

The html <iframe> pair is a quick way to imbed a web page into Sage.  A new python function iframe(url) would make it easier (and cleaner) to bring existing web pages into a Sage notebook.  This started as a why to bring GeoGegbra worksheets into Sage, but in fact it could be used for other web based software.

combined the two patches into trac_11489-iframe.reviewer.reviewer.patch.  Also changed docstring to be a rawstring.  Tests pass, and functions correctly and code looks good.  Positive Review.

I'm not sure it was really necessary to combine the patches, but OK :) Thanks for the review! For future reference, you should generally use the more complete "git format" patches - put this in your `~/.hgrc` to enable them:


```ini
[diff]
git = yes
```
