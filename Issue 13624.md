# Issue 13624: Clean up arguments to all plotting functions

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13828

Different plot commands have different arguments or keywords for achieving the same final effect. This is very confusing.

This ticket aims to go through the plot functions one by one and fix the arguments so that the Sage interface remains consistent and uniform across all the plot commands irrespective of what the underlying plotting method used (currently matplotlib).

It is conceivable that the changes could be extensive (there are many plot functions) - then the changes can be broken up into other tickets and made a dependency of this one.

Is there an example of this? Also, how should we determine what keywords should be used as the standard ones?

Unfortunately, there are quite a few such examples. One such I was fixing in #12798 (I intend to break out the color changes to a separate ticket and make that a dependency of this one), there are discussions in #13830, #8570, #13834, and all of this when we haven't even started to look at all the commands in detail.

(I am quite preoccupied for a couple of weeks, so it will take a while before I can come back to all these tickets, and start looking at them in detail.)

Another one mentioned in sage-support:

```
> When desperate, I add invisible points and use show(). (Unfortunately 
> invisible points depend on your plot type since alpha=0 is for 2d and 
> opacity=0 is for 3d...HINT to developers to change this...)
```

From [here](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/10657#comment:7):

 Somewhere in this set of related tickets we should also unify the usage of
 `figsize` between graphics objects and graphics arrays.  Maybe graphics
 arrays need to be a separate file eventually..

Let's add some dependencies.

How about #13576 too?  Not that any of them have patches.

Adding #15002 to the list. It arises out of the examples provided by `@`kcrisman in #13576.
