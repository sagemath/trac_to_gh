CC:  rudi

Keywords: breadth first search distance

There is no way to get the edge distance with a custom neighbor function. 

breadth_first_search() does not report distance, and shortest_paths() does not give the option to specify a neighbor function.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16470

I do not understand your problem, but do you know `g.distance(by_weight=True)` ? A BFS with a distance on the edges is called "Dijkstra's algorithm", and it is implemented in Sage.

I need BFS to report the distance as well, the minimum number of edges/arcs to be traversed for every vertex. The shortest_paths method implements this, but it does not have any option to specify a neighbor function, which is possible in the breadth_first_search method.

My commit is a small modification that does implement this.

I have made a review commit. I still need to check that the doc builds, otherwise thinks look good to me.

Can you have a look at my changes, and see if you agree with them ? They are mostly typographical.

Thank you for reviewing. 

The author of this patch was my student Florian Oosterhof, who worked on this code as a part of his bachelor thesis. I'm not sure if he is still active on the sage trac, so I added his name in the author field on his behalf.
