# Issue 12126: minor CallableSymbolicExpressionRing display bug.

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: gbe

Original creation time: 2012-01-11 21:14:25

Assignee: gbe

CC:  kcrisman

Keywords: beginner

When a CallableSymbolicExpressionRing is created with only one variable, arguments is still plural and an extra comma is printed.

Correct, #variable > 1:

```
sage: CallableSymbolicExpressionRing([var('q p')])
Callable function ring with arguments (q, p)
```


Incorrect:

```
sage: CallableSymbolicExpressionRing([var('q')])
Callable function ring with arguments (q,)
```


The extra comma, I _suspect_, is because the repr returns something like "... arguments (%s)" % variable_tuple. This is what would be expected of a singular tuple.

This looks fine but needs doctests.

Adds doctests and introduces minor coding style changes.

Thanks.  Given that you are making these changes, should we fix any other little changes like that and add this file to the reference manual?  See e.g. [here](http://hg.sagemath.org/sage-main/file/9519a7bb2f42/doc/en/reference/calculus.rst#l1).  Though perhaps that should be based off of #6495 rather than interfere with that very big patch...

We could sure do that. We'll have to find an appropriate place to add this. I'd be glad to hear your suggestion, but at the moment, I am inclined to add it just after `sage/symbolic/function` (equivalently, just before `sage/symbolic/integration/integral`).

See patchbot result.

```
sage -t  -force_lib devel/sage-12298/sage/modules/free_module_element.pyx
**********************************************************************
File "/scratch/sage-5.8.beta4/devel/sage-12298/sage/modules/free_module_element.pyx", line 3900:
    sage: w.base_ring()
Expected:
    Callable function ring with arguments (x,)
Got:
    Callable function ring with argument x
**********************************************************************
```

Should be easy to fix.  Maybe you can add this to the reference manual at the place you suggest, too.

Otherwise this is fine, though if you're already doing it you may want to switch to Python 3 string formatting - up to you.
