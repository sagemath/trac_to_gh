# Issue 12898: Make notebook tab-completion in R evaluation work right

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13070

Keywords: R r-project

From [this stackoverlow post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10775775/the-bug-in-sage-math-notebook-when-using-r) and [this ask.sagemath post](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/1400/may-there-is-a-bug-in-notebook), the same question:

```
I know that when calls R with Sage,the dot will convert to underscores.But even when I set the "system" to R with combo box above in notebook,the dot will convert to underscores,and that is the problem. Is there any solution?
```


I'm not sure if this is an upstream ticket or not, but it seems like we should address this if possible.

Proposing to close all sagenb tickets as outdated, so that all remaining open tickets in the notebook component are about the Jupyter notebook.
