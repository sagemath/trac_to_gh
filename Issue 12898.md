From [this stackoverlow post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10775775/the-bug-in-sage-math-notebook-when-using-r) and [this ask.sagemath post](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/1400/may-there-is-a-bug-in-notebook), the same question:

```
I know that when calls R with Sage,the dot will convert to underscores.But even when I set the "system" to R with combo box above in notebook,the dot will convert to underscores,and that is the problem. Is there any solution?
```


I'm not sure if this is an upstream ticket or not, but it seems like we should address this if possible.
