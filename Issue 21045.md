[This answer](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/34071/is-there-a-way-to-use-non-english-symbols/?answer=34513#post-id-34513) to an ask.sagemath question point out that

```
plot(sin, 0, pi, axes_labels=(ur'Ось абсцисс $x$', ur'Ось ординат $y$'))
```

doesn't work.  Apparently before #21008 was resolved it was worse.  Maybe we can fix this?

This is purely a matplotlib problem with the default font. There is nothing to be fixed here. As explained in the doc of axes_labels in sage/plot/graphics.py, unicode characters are already accepted and transmitted correctly to matplotlib.

Well, it didn't, apparently, in this case.  So is this an upstream problem to report there?  I think it would be reasonable to put this as an example that doesn't work in our doc, even, if upstream won't/can't fix it.
