I found some more numerical noise in this doctest in the hidden markov model stuff:

Replying to [comment:3 vbraun]:
> Tesla GPGPU card (of course not used in the doctest)
would be Ã¼ber-cool though...

> running Ubuntu 11.10 i386(!). Taking the less beaten path with a 32-bit OS (don't ask).
Interesting that I haven't seen this failure on Skynet cicero (Fedora 15 i386, Pentium 4).

Cicero is running Fedora 16, for the record.

The i7 has more SSE ops, if the compiler used those instead of FPU then that would easily explain the slightly different precision. GCC on tesla is 4.6.1.
