This works, but how about getting rid of the use of `tmp_dir` in this file (see #33213)?

Also:

```
+    subprocess.check_call(f'gcc -o {runmefile} ' + os.path.join(tempdir, '*.c ') +
```

Because this command is processed by the shell, `runmefile` should be run through `shlex.quote`

```
+                          os.path.join('$SAGE_LOCAL', 'lib', 'libTIDES.a') + ' $LDFLAGS ' +
+                          os.path.join('-L$SAGE_LOCAL', 'lib ') + '-lmpfr -lgmp -lm  -O2 -w ' +
+                          os.path.join('-I$SAGE_LOCAL', 'include '),
+                          shell=True, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
+    subprocess.check_call(tempdir / 'runme', shell=True, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
```

`tempdir / 'runme'` can be replaced by `runmefile`

now using `shlex.quote`

still using `tmp_dir`, to be changed rather in another ticket

```
+    subprocess.check_call(f'gcc -o {quote(runmefile)} ' + os.path.join(tempdir, '*.c ') +
+                          os.path.join('$SAGE_LOCAL', 'lib', 'libTIDES.a') + ' $LDFLAGS ' +
+                          os.path.join('-L$SAGE_LOCAL', 'lib ') + '-lmpfr -lgmp -lm  -O2 -w ' +
+                          os.path.join('-I$SAGE_LOCAL', 'include '),
+                          shell=True, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
```

Likewise `tempdir` (but not "*.c") needs to be shell-quoted. 
And strings with trailing space such as `'lib '` should really not be passed to os.path.join

better now ?


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2022-10-17 17:14:23

Yes, better, but there's still another one of these:

```
+                          os.path.join('-I$SAGE_LOCAL', 'include '),
```
