Um, while this will fix this example, what stops someone from using `K.zero()` instead of `K(0)` in the future code?..

You are very free to use `K.zero()` (and you should). You are not allowed to use the C-API and modifies it. And nobody prevents it! This is indeed a (minor) problem in Cython code.

It does. Asking for imaginary part in a complex field (`K`) returns a value in a real field (`K13`). And it needs to be this precise `K13` with `sqrt13` as variable name. I changed the doctest to reflect this fact. Without the branch the second `K13.zero()` fails.
