Are you sure you want `\mathbf` and not `\mathbb`? After all, the mistaken latex code is supposed to denote the projective line, which I have only seen printed as `\mathbb P^1`, not `\mathbf P^1`.

Both notations are common, the rest of the docs (e.g. the following line in the diff) uses  `\mathbf{P}` already.

OK. I thought it would be more likely that `\mathbbb` is a typo for `\mathbb`, not for `\mathbf`.

That, too ;-)

You could also use `\Bold`. From the developer's guide:

```
The Sage LaTeX style is to typeset standard rings and fields like the integers 
and the real numbers using the locally-defined macro \\Bold, as in \\Bold{Z} 
for the integers.
```

Projective space isn't a standard ring or field, so this style doesn't quite apply, but it's an option.

As far as current usage in Sage:

```
sage: len(search_src('Bold{P}', interact=False).strip().split('\n'))
1
sage: len(search_src('mathbf{P}', interact=False).strip().split('\n'))
10
sage: len(search_src('mathbb{P}', interact=False).strip().split('\n'))
132
```

So `\mathbb{P}` is the most popular choice, for what that's worth.

The documentation builds fine with this branch and the one from #15562.

By the way:

```
sage: len(search_src('mathbb P', interact=False).strip().split('\n'))
1
sage: len(search_src('mathbf P', interact=False).strip().split('\n'))
7
sage: len(search_src('Bold P', interact=False).strip().split('\n'))
1
```

So, 18 bold votes against 133 blackboard votes. Should we try to generally replace `mathbf` by `mathbb` when it is about the projective line, while we are at it? Apart from this question, it is a positive review.

Feel free to open a separate ticket if you want to make the docs more consistent. I don't think that every bold P stands for projective space, but you can figure that out elsewere. This ticket is about making the documentation actually build, which it does not right now.

It does now! At least when merging the branches from #15562 and from here. Positive review, and I hope you don't mind that I name you as author...

PS: It seems that the trac plugins need to be fixed. Almost all plugins complain about your branch (claiming that it adds new modules at startup etc), for no apparent reason.

Resolution: fixed
