# Issue 31633: plot(..., stylesheet="bmh") doesn't work

I'm not sure how to use the `stylesheet` option for plots. The documentation https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/plotting/sage/plot/plot.html#sage.plot.plot.plot suggests this should work, but I don't see an example. When I try `plot(sin(x^2), (x, 0, 2*pi), stylesheet="bmh")` I get a stacktrace.

expected: this works and there is an example in the docs.

workaround:


```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.style.use('bmh')
plot(sin(x^2), (x, 0, 2*pi))
```

Changing keywords from "" to "plot, matplotlib, stylesheet".
