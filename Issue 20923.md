The method `sage.categories.Homset.identity` should not try to bypass the `_element_constructor_`... as a consequence of the current behavior

```
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: A = AffineSpace(R)
sage: Ai = A.Hom(A).identity()
sage: f = A.Hom(A)([1,2])
sage: f * Ai
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: right (=Identity endomorphism of Affine Space of dimension 2 over Rational Field) must be a SchemeMorphism to multiply it by Scheme endomorphism of Affine Space of dimension 2 over Rational Field
  Defn: Defined on coordinates by sending (x, y) to
        (1, 2)
```


(Vincent): I think that this `IdentityMorphism` should just not exist. There is no such thing as `OneElement` and `ZeroElement` that is spoiled all over Sage for the zero and one of algebraic structures...
