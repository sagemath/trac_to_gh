# Issue 32750: Deprecate sage.misc.misc.sage_makedirs

As noted in #29093, in py3, `os.makedirs` learned an `exist_ok` option that makes `sage_makedirs` entirely redundant.

Since then we have dropped py2 support, so we can deprecate `sage_makedirs` and replace all uses in the library.

It works well. 

I see two doctest failures with `src/sage/tests/cmdline.py`, but these seem related with `pytest` issues, not with the current branch.

This was already positively reviewed, but LGTM too after rebasing.
