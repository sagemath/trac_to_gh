# Issue 28555: SageNB, message about deperecation

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28792

Currently starting SageNB fails with `"ImportError: cannot import name 'smtp' from 'twisted.mail'`. Add some nice message instead of that, like "SageNB has been deprecated starting from [SageMath](SageMath) 9.0."

There has been a deprecation notice for a while: #25852. I think you mean a better error message, not a deprecation message. (It's not just deprecated, it won't work at all with a default build of Sage 9.0.)

I suppose that in the event one could have a very special custom error message for this particular situation - the current 9.0 beta is Python 3 by default, right?  But I don't know how feasible that is.

Yes, my bad. Corrected.

About special message: maybe not worth it. We can just hard-code this to the code. Or at least remove the function and command line parameter.

Better, but should we have the same error message also when calling `notebook()`?

I think `notebook()` will in the future default to either the exporter or just Jupyter, so probably not - people can confirm if I am correct about that.

If so, then this can be marked as positive review.

ping ?

I guess Jori is happy if someone can confirm that the default on py2 and py3 for `notebook()` is to do something useful even if sagenb is not installed.  I cannot check this currently, though I believe it to be the case.

In any case this is an improvement, so positive review.

Under Python 2, both `./sage -n sagenb` and `notebook()` result in

```
ImportError: No module named sagenb.notebook.notebook_object
```


--------------------

With Python 3 and without sagenb, `./sage -n sagenb` gives

```
CRITICAL:root:trying to use old notebook under Python 3
old notebook not working under Python 3, use Jupyter notebook
see https://wiki.sagemath.org/Python3-Switch
```

whereas `notebook()` produces

```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'sagenb.notebook'
```


If sagenb is installed under Python 3, with `notebook()` we get

```
ImportError: cannot import name 'smtp' from 'twisted.mail' (unknown location)
```


These messages seem fine, except for the last one. Though, considering that sagenb does not get installed anymore now that Python 3 is the default, this does not look like a big problem.

I think in a perfect world, the first message (the one with Python 2) would suggest running "./sage -i sagenb" or "make sagenb".

I'm not objecting to the current ticket, though.

Agreed.

I do wonder whether `notebook()` should launch Jupyter, but maybe that is not technically feasible?  I feel like we discussed this a few years back.

Resolution: fixed

a followup to this is #29195 (do not lazy-import sagenb on python3)
