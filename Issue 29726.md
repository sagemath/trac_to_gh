This is not based on #29936 anymore.

Note that #29936 fixes a sign error in `geometry/hyperbolic_space/hyperbolic_geodesic.py`.

If we want to make this independent of #29936, we need to change the objective.

It is just not based on #29936 to avoid constant merge conflicts. However, #29936 needs to be taken care of or we need to mark those things as known bugs.

If the issue with `src/sage/geometry/hyperbolic_space/hyperbolic_geodesic.py` is taken care of in another ticket, then the branch on this ticket can go in. It does not have to wait. I would suggest to downgrade the goal of this ticket to what the branch does.
