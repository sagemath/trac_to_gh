In #8998 there was some incorrect documentation added to Cusp.galois_action . This ticket is to fix the documentation.  It is also to fix the following error, since in some cases the galois action is not even a permutation. For example the following:


```
N=5
G=Gamma1(N)
for i in G.cusps():
    print [j.galois_action(2,N).is_gamma1_equiv(i,N)[0] for j in G.cusps()].count(True)
```

Outputs:


```
2
1
0
1
```

I was using this function recently and unfortunately the documentation makes incorrect claims for its applicability!    Being based on Steven's book, it works for *some* congruence subgroups of level N, but *not all* of them.

The example I have is this.  I have a subgroup of level 13, index 91, consisting of matrices in PSL(2,Z) whose mod-13 reduction lie in a subgroup of PSL(2,13) isomorphic to A4.  Under the action of A4 the 84 cusps of Gamma(13) form 7 orbits of size 12 each.    But the action of (t mod 13) is only well-defined for t=1,5,8,12 (i.e. the cubes mod 13).  I could give examples of 2 cusps c1,c2 which are A4-equivalent but the results of c.galois_action(2,13) for c=c1,c2 are not A4-equivalent.  This can be explained by looking carefully at Stevens' proof of his proposition, which relies on the field of modular functions for the group in question being generated by by functions whose Q-expansions have rational coefficients.
