In #8998 there was some incorrect documentation added to Cusp.galois_action . This ticket is to fix the documentation.  It is also to fix the following error, since in some cases the galois action is not even a permutation. For example the following:

```
N=5
G=Gamma1(N)
for i in G.cusps():
    print [j.galois_action(2,N).is_gamma1_equiv(i,N)[0] for j in G.cusps()].count(True)
```
Outputs:

```
2
1
0
1
```

I think I incorporated all your comments.

I was using this function recently and unfortunately the documentation makes incorrect claims for its applicability!    Being based on Steven's book, it works for *some* congruence subgroups of level N, but *not all* of them.

The example I have is this.  I have a subgroup of level 13, index 91, consisting of matrices in PSL(2,Z) whose mod-13 reduction lie in a subgroup of PSL(2,13) isomorphic to A4.  Under the action of A4 the 84 cusps of Gamma(13) form 7 orbits of size 12 each.    But the action of (t mod 13) is only well-defined for t=1,5,8,12 (i.e. the cubes mod 13).
