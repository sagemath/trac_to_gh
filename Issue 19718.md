# Issue 19718: QQbar cleaning 2

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: vdelecroix

This is a follow up of #19954 where we:
 - make `ANRoot` be a descriptor for roots of *irreducible* polynomials with *rational* coefficients
 - get rid of `ANUnaryExpr` and `ANBinaryExpr` and use the code from #18356 for addition/subtraction/multiplication/division

This is part of the task #18333.

Hi Vincent,

I think you told me that you no longer wanted to do that, and I agree. It would be nice to have a way of computing directly on `ANRoot`s using resultants (in addition to the version using `union()`, I think, rather than as a replacement), but `ANUnaryExpr` and `ANBinaryExpr` should either remain or be replaced by a more general polynomial descriptor as suggested in #18106 (or perhaps merge with `LazyAlgebraic`, #24503?)

→ wontfix?

#24503 is indeed what I intended to do first. That is moving the numerical part of polynomial root evaluation to the real/complex lazy fields.

And on the other hand, computing with resultants is by far too slow if you work with a fixed number field of degree < 10.

Looks reasonable to me.

Presuming these are all correctly reviewed as either duplicate, invalid, or wontfix.
