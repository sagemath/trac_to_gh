Currently DiGraph constructor works in following manner

```
sage: m=Matrix([[0,1],[0,-1],[0,0]])
sage: G = DiGraph(m,format='incidence_matrix')
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
ValueError: there must be two nonzero entries (-1 & 1) per column
```

It should be able to handle incidence matrix containing column with all zero entries by dropping that column and returning a Digraph which will be loop less version of that incidence matrix


Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29276

- the test should be `if not NZ:`

- add a `TESTS:` block like

```
TESTS:

Handle incidence matrix containing a column with only zeros (:trac:`29276`)::

    sage: m = Matrix([[0,1],[0,-1],[0,0]])
    sage: m
    [ 0  1]
    [ 0 -1]
    [ 0  0]
    sage: G = DiGraph(m,format='incidence_matrix')
    sage: list(G.edges(labels=False))
    [(1, 0)]
