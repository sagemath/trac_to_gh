I'm probably not going to bother.  Somebody else is welcome to take my branch and continue the work off it.  I've wasted enough time on this.

Andrey, referring to https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/5GXnV4tlMXw, could you check that this interface works for you?

Yes, I've started yesterday's version last night and it did go through experimental package installation. So I am for merging this although it would be good if someone else glanced at details.

In `sage-logger` you have `+    SED=cat` and this should be `SED="cat"`, no?

The documentation for `-y` should be more verbose about dangers of it, namely: 

  * breaking the installation
  * accepting whatever licenses the package is under

The mixture of spaces and TABs to indent is annoying: #21792. Please review!
