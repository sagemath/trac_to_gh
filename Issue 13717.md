Keywords: pari gp debug

On bsd.math (hence, Darwin), there is a problem with the GP executable when building Sage (or: only the pari/gp spkg) with SAGE_DEBUG=yes.

As Jeroen found, a crash occurs as follows:

```
$ ./sage --gp
? factor(-70665476079756004438844153774)
```

With gdb, one then gets

```
Program received signal EXC_BAD_ACCESS, Could not access memory.
Reason: 13 at address: 0x0000000000000000
0x00007fff8a66cfc1 in dyld_stub_binder ()
(gdb) bt
#0  0x00007fff8a66cfc1 in dyld_stub_binder ()
#1  0x000000010040e398 in  stub helpers ()
```

A smaller testcase is `? factor(10356613*10694706299664611221)`

According to Jeroen, the problem vanishes with Apple's gcc.

It seems to be an upstream bug, either in pari/gp or in gcc. But who is upstream? How to contact them?

I am building GCC-4.7.2 to see whether that solves the problem.
