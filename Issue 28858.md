With this fix, everything works fine at runtime with sphinx 2.2. Building is a different topic (#28856)

When docbuilding I also see warnings

```
RemovedInSphinx30Warning: function based directive support is now deprecated. Use class based directive instead.
```

but those can be fixed on another ticket. (This is with Sphinx 2.3.1, which is what is available at https://pypi.org/project/Sphinx/#files.)
