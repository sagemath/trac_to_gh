#18211 added support for computing Ehrhart polynomials of lattice polytopes.

LattE integrale has many more features that should be exposed in Sage:

counting integer points in rational polytopes,
computing Ehrhart series of rational polytopes, 
computing multivariate generating functions of integer points in polyhedra, 
integration (of polynomials over polytopes), 
volume computation (for polytopes).

(See manual at https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~latte/software/packages/latte_current/manual_v1.7.2.pdf)

(The manual reveals that LattE has some other features that, however, require Maple as a subroutine; I omitted them in the list above.)

All of these features are available from the command-line, so this is independent of #18190 (library bindings to LattE).
The command-line interfacing can be adapted from #18211 sage.geometry.polyhedron.Polyhedron_ZZ::ehrhart_polynomial

Setting new milestone based on a cursory review of ticket status, priority, and last modification date.
