First of all, it should be possible to have access to both shuffle and stuffle product in the motivic algebra of MZV.

Next, the evaluation `Z: y_s -> ζ(s)` extends in two distinct algebra morphisms to divergent MZV, eg including ζ(1). In other words, these two extensions do not satisfy the relation

```
Z_stuffle(y_s1 stuffle y_s2) = Z_shuffle(y_s1 shuffle y_s2)
```

which is valid on convergent symbols `s1` and `s2`. However, there is a simple way to go around that as explained in [Ihara-Kaneko-Zagier (2006)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/compositio-mathematica/article/derivation-and-double-shuffle-relations-for-multiple-zeta-values/5DD6B349C751EE191011123287B3C031).

BEWARE : I am not sure if it is known whether the motivic MZV satisfy the double shuffle relations. What is known is that their images by the period map do.

I remember some work by Soudères on the question, that one should check.

Apparemment le travail de Soudères porte sur les MZV motiviques à la Goncharov, moins fines que celles à la Brown.

Donc on ne peut pas conclure, sauf si quelqu'un d'autre a fait le boulot depuis.

Setting new milestone based on a cursory review of ticket status, priority, and last modification date.
