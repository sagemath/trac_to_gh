Our current version of ipython is pretty out of date, and it's causing some problems with our singlecell project.  It would be good to upgrade to 0.10.2.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/11460

Fernando said we shouldn't upgrade to 0.11 whenever it comes out (wait for 0.12), so chances are it will be a while before we can upgrade past 0.10.2, so it's probably worth the effort to upgrade to 0.10.2 (as compared to just waiting until 0.12).

Thx, 0.10.2 works well in sage-on-gentoo, it seems to be a no brainer as far as I can see. I am taking notes about 0.11 (still it will be tested).

I probably won't be able to work on a new spkg until Monday. You put it for 4.7.1 is it somewhat urgent?

A few quick comments:

- in SPKG.txt, the descriptions of the patches should be deleted, since they are no longer used.
- if you feel like it, you could change SPKG.txt so the lines are all < 80 characters.  (There are two areas: several lines in the "description" section, and one line in your part of the Changelog.)
- along the lines of the spkg-install file in #11665, it might be best to build IPython first, using `python setup.py build`, then if there were no errors, remove the old version (along with printing a message that you're doing it), and then finally install the new one with `python setup.py install`.

I'm testing on a few systems now.  What exactly should I test with `sage -gdb` on OS X?

Two comments:

- This also doesn't look great, but it's exactly the same behavior as with IPython 0.9.
- With the patched version, at least once I've been able to run `sage -gdb` without any errors at all.

So I think the patch should be there, at least to maintain the status quo.  I'm posting a link to a new spkg, based on yours, which reinstates the patch.  I'm attaching the hg patch for the Mercurial repo for the spkg, so you can see what's been changed.  I'm also posting logs of what happens when you run `sage -gdb` with the current 0.9.1.p0 spkg, with your 0.10.2 spkg, and with my 0.10.2.p0 spkg.  (Notice how much longer the logs are for spkgs which use the patch: they seem to process many more libraries.  The logs for 0.9.1.p0 and 0.10.2.p0 are identical, except for the paths involved.)
