Since it causes doctest failures when `database_gap` is installed, I'm making this a blocker.

is the swapping of `sage()` and `__str__()` in the patch just the matter of style, or it does change the behaviour?

Yes, it changes the behaviour. That's the whole point of this ticket.

All tests passed for me.

How come failures in optional packages are blockers?

Also, reviewer name missing

well, by right, an optional package with test failures must be downgraded to experimental...

You're the release manager. If you disagree, just change the priority...

In any case, it's not only an optional test failure. The doctest just exposes a more general issue: certain conversions of libGAP strings to Python strings are wrong. It's also a recent regression (since #19597), so we might not be able to judge how bad the issue is.
