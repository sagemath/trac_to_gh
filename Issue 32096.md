Keywords: series precision

In http://trac.sagemath.org/18416, the method `set_default_prec` of power series rings was marked deprecated, and the warning states that the default precision should be set at construction. This was done before in #16201 for Laurent series.

The point of those changes was to ensure that power series and Laurent series rings are immutable.

I suggest to replace `set_default_prec` with a method `change_default_prec`, which would return a copy of `self` with the wanted precision. It would be similar to how `change_ring` works, for example.

For an application, see the following example:


```
sage: Pow.<x> = PowerSeriesRing(QQ, default_prec=5)
sage: Laur = Pow.fraction_field()
sage: f = Pow(1).add_bigoh(100); f
1 + O(x^100)
sage: f.parent()(1/(1+x))*f # forgetting about the ring Laur
1 - x + x^2 - x^3 + x^4 + O(x^5)
```


To get the correct precision, one would need something like


```
sage: R = f.parent() 
sage: S = PowerSeriesRing(R.base_ring(),R.gen(),default_prec=100)
sage: S = S.fraction_field() 
sage: S(1/(1+x))*f  
1 - x + x^2 - x^3 + x^4 + ... + x^99 + O(x^100)
```


The idea would be to replace that with:


```
sage: S = f.parent().change_default_prec(100)
sage: S(1/(1+x))*f  
1 - x + x^2 - x^3 + x^4 + ... + x^99 + O(x^100)
```

Oh, right, that didn't work.

Okay, I made the changes and I added implementations for power series (univariate and multivariate) and Laurent series. I tried to pass all relevant parameters to the constructor, but some are just lost after the initialization (for instance `implementation`). `change_var` and `change_ring` do not seem to care, so I guess if it is a problem, it's a problem for another ticket?

Oops.
