CC:  @vbraun

Certain Linux kernels have a security feature which prevents debugging: [https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/security/Yama.txt](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/security/Yama.txt)
This breaks the `sage-CSI` script.

With the `prctl` system call, debugging can be allowed again.
