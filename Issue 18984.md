This ticket implements a new construction of BIBD from a desarguesian projective plane. This gives us the (232,8,1)-BIBD needed for the database of strongly regular graphs, as well as some others.

Denniston's construction needs an irreducible binary quadratic form GF(q), for q power of 2. It is not 100% trivial, IMHO (well, I am not a number theorist), and 
GAP knows how to do it, that's why.

I see thanks for the clarification!

Though, the complaints about coordinates (as in [#16552 comment:4](http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16552#comment:4)) is still valid. If we change the way the Sage Desarguesian plane is labeled, this code will not be valid anymore.

Because it apparently does not break anything that was claimed previously by its documentation. Also, because it is clearly an improvement.

If I remember correctly, the explanation to that lies in the running times.

well, as you know, even Sage library code used the implementation's labellings in some 
places, instead of doing this via ground_set()...

Indeed, it's 50 times faster on PG(2,16). I wonder why...

Whaaaat? I don't know what makes you think that. `labels=False` makes sense to me. There is nothing in that word that says 'user-defineable' or anything. If you want to change the labels, `.relabel` is there for you.

> Calling a set of labels chosen by the implementation `labels` is unhelpful and uninformative, to say the least.

It just means that the structure is not integer-labelled. Any way I cannot care less: if you chose to overlook that all our functions will have as many ways to call the same thing (labels, coordinate, ... do you see this end?) then I will not fight again, it's your win anytime because you are the reviewer and by Sage's laws you can make my life hell until I give up.

So add a commit.

Surprising. Might be because we are multiplying the elements of the ground set using Sage, which is always slow for ... well, everything. Perhaps the way `PG` is called changed in the meantime, I do not remember. If you feel bad about it you can write a ticket, it's always good to see speed improvements.

well, `.relabel()` does relabel things in a user-defineable way (at least it has this option).

I merely say that `coordinates` is more informative name for this parameter.
Do you agree? If yes, I will change this on #19226, to make it uniform with ProjectiveGeometryDesign.

I agree that it is more informative, and I disagree that it is what should be used here. Because of the reason I mentionned earlier, i.e. having the same thing that goes under different names in different functions.

`vertices="blah"` is a good one, it's right to the point. Perhaps `point_coordinates=T/F` would be even better than `coordinates=T/F` in our case. But `labels=T/F` is not clear at all: indeed what is being labelled, and how, can only be read in the docs...

Replying to [comment:32 ncohen]:
> It's probably just that I am dead tired of typing `G.is_strongly_regular(parameters=True)`, just before getting an error because it should be `return_parameters=True` and to do the very same mistake in the other direction with `is_t_design`. I do this 10 times a day at least, no joke.

The solution is to have proper names for methods, not random (and not tab-discoverable) keyword arguments to change the output to contradict the method name:

```
sage: obj.is_foo(parameters=True)
(42, 'cherry')
```

What does that tell me without reading the docs? Nothing. VS:

```
sage: obj.enumerated_fruit()
(42, 'cherry')
```

Probably. What should we do?

`designs.DesarguesianProjectivePlaneWithHomogeneousCoordinates`?

Look great.
