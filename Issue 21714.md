Do you have a script to test it? I mean, the total number of such graphs is known for small values of  n (cf. https://oeis.org/A007085) and so it's possible to run it many times and see whether you can get anywhere close to a uniform distribution.

By the way, there are few trailing spaces in the branch.

Hmm, this algorithm does not generate only 3-connected graphs.

It seems that the sequence of numbers is not in the OEIS:

```
sage: resu = {i: set() for i in range(1,6)}
sage: liste = []                           
....: for n in range(1,6):
....:     for k in range(6600):
....:         g = graphs.RandomBicubicPlanar(n)
....:         h = g.copy(immutable=True)
....:         resu[n].add(hash(h))
....:     liste.append(len(resu[n]))
sage: liste
[1, 3, 17, 103, 642]
```


Probably a better way to check would be to return also the root edge, so that the number of different possible outputs is given by Tutte's formula in A257.

Right - but you could drop ones that are not 3-connected,
and also drop the marked (root) edge and count the results up to an isomorphism, and this would give you the OEIS sequence.

Here is at least a way to check that it generates
A000257: Number of rooted bicubic maps: a(n) = (8n-4)*a(n-1)/(n+2)

A procedure to faithfully encode the rooted map in a digraph:

```
def bicubic_dual_grand(g):
    G = DiGraph()
    for a, b, c in g.edges():
        ac = a + (c,)
        bc = b + (c,)
        G.add_edge((ac, bc))
        G.add_edge((bc, ac))
    for vert in g:
        if vert[0] == 'i':
            clef = (0, 1, 2)
        else:
            clef = (1, 0, 2)

        A, B, C = [vert + (c,) for c in clef]
        G.add_edge(A, B)
        G.add_edge(B, C)
        G.add_edge(C, A)

    op_root = [u for u in G.outgoing_edge_iterator(('n', -1, 0))
               if u[1][0] == 'i']
    G.delete_edge(op_root[0])
    return G
```

then

```
sage: resu = {i: set() for i in range(1,6)}
sage: liste = []                           
....: for n in range(1,6):
....:     for k in range(400*n):
....:         g = bicubic_dual_grand(graphs.RandomBicubicPlanar(n)).canonical_label()
....:         h = g.copy(immutable=True)
....:         resu[n].add(h)
....:     liste.append(len(resu[n]))
sage: liste
```

Checking uniformity should be doable similarly.

Increasing bound to 4000*n gives
