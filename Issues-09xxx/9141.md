Well... I do not work with spectral theory very often (perhaps read about it once or twice...) but I can check this is correct :-)

From the look of it though, there seems to be an interest in the spectra of very small graphs, as enumerating all the graphs is admissible. One question though : what would you think of "graph_set" instead of "test" ? It sounds a bit wide to me otherwise :-)

Today, I was thinking about some future patches (when all these dependencies will have disappeared). They would be methods taking as an argument a list of graphs, and returning, depending on the flags, the set of minimal elements of this list according to subgraph containment, induced subgraph containment, or minor containment.

I was also thinking of a function taking as an argument a graph and a lambda function (lambda representing a property), and returning one smallest (or all the smallests) subgraphs (possibly induced, or minors) of the graphs given as an argument satisfying the property given by lambda. We could then "clean" it with the functions mentionned before. Well, I just thought, considering this function, that this also may be of interest to you !

Since "test" can be either a function or an iterable object, I don't think graph_set is a good name.  I thought "test" could have two meanings: 1. a test function, 2. a set of graphs to test.  This covers the two possible inputs.

If you can think of a more natural way to have these sorts of inputs, please let me know!

That sounds fantastic!

Definitely!  I've done much of my research in minimal forbidden subgraphs, so these types of functions are definitely of interest!

I still have a problem with "domain", since it still indicates a set rather than a function restricting the set (at least to me).  If test=function, then it is a restriction on graphs with "vertices" vertices.  If test=iterable, then it is a domain or graph_set.  I guess I just don't see either graph_set or domain having the double-meaning that "test" has.
