This patch:
* flips the matrix so that it is right side up, and flips the y-axis to correctly label the rows, unless origin='lower' is specified.
* Adds matplotlib's vmin and vmax parameters, which control the scaling
* Adds matplotlib's norm parameter, which also controls the scaling

#2189 is related, though I don't know if this fixes all the issues mentioned there (i.e. labeling).

Before:

* axes=True was the default, so typically there were lines on the far right and far bottom of the plot going through the first row and first column of the matrix

* matrices were plotted upside-down, where the first row was on the bottom of the matrix.

Huh, that is weird, because I definitely didn't have that experience.

Attached is a screenshot of what I get.  The top row is all the powers of 1 mod 7 (which are all 1), and the left row is all the 0th powers of a mod 7 (which are all 1).  The right row is Fermat's Little Theorem, that the 6th powers are also 1 mod 7.  The matrix itself is

```
sage: p=7
sage: matrix(p-1,[mod(a,p)^b for a in range(1,p) for b in srange(p)])
[1 1 1 1 1 1 1]
[1 2 4 1 2 4 1]
[1 3 2 6 4 5 1]
[1 4 2 1 4 2 1]
[1 5 4 6 2 3 1]
[1 6 1 6 1 6 1]
```
I feel like I must be missing something.

Looks fine, diagonal is from upper left to lower right, like the matrix. 0 (lowest input) is black, 1 (highest input) is white, I think this is as usual.  With cmap='jet' I get something I like :)  What do *you* get for this one?

Yikes!  Two issues.  First, it is definitely flipped.  Second, what's up with the colors?  I get white for the off-diagonal zeros and blue for the diagonal.  My diagnosis: something going on with all that special code for sparse matrices.

And now I see what you mean about the axes showing up.  I thought that was just part of the frame because my matrices tend to have blue or black around the edges, since the values are one!  Good catch with making axes=False in the future.

Got it.  And sure enough, in my top directory (i.e., above my user account) there is one, probably placed there eons ago by some primitive Sage installation, with

```
image.origin : upper             # lower | upper
```
Is that it?

I hate to be picky, but I have another question.

```
Generally matrices are plotted with the (0,0) entry in the upper 
right.  However, sometimes if we are plotting an image, we'd like 
the (0,0) entry to be in the lower left. 
```
Should the first word in the second line be 'left'?  And if not, please explain.

Explain `axes_integer`.  Also, the options for the locators weren't always

```
locator_options=dict(nbins=9,steps=[1,2,5,10],integer=axes_integer)
```
in all cases - will this make anything different, particularly the `steps` addition?  That stuff should have been a separate ticket, or maybe on #9221 ;)

Explain

```
limits[k]-=0.5
```
I assume this makes it so that the matrix has `0,1,2,3` as opposed to putting entries between `0-1`, `1-2`, etc.  I can't check this because the branch I'm making for this decided to rebuild documentation, which takes a while... sigh.

Good catch on the complex guys.

Okay, I think that these two things combine to make this happen, after reading [this](http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/api/ticker_api.html#matplotlib.ticker.MaxNLocator) again.

Two things, which perhaps should still be addressed - what do you think?

First, the error message with the `matrix_plot(A,marker=',')` is not very helpful when you choose a different marker (for instance, '<' works (and is cool with small matrices) but ';' doesn't).  I realize this isn't part of the ticket per se, so maybe this should be a followup.
