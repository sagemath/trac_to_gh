The new ellap (which replaces the sea.gp script in sage) is seriously buggy, evidently.  Sometimes it works, but the first example I tried fails miserably.  

```

? ellap(ellinit([1,2,7,4,3]),nextprime(10^20))
%1 = -4070602678
? ellap(ellinit([1,2,3,4,5]),nextprime(10^20))

? ellap(ellinit([1,2,3,4,5]),nextprime(10^25))
%2 = 1231939791654
? ellap(ellinit([1,2,3,4,5]),nextprime(10^30))

  *** ellap: bug in PARI/GP (Segmentation Fault), please report

```

NOTE: To use ellap for big p, you *must* put the extracted data from seadata.tgz/data/*  in local/share/pari, as explained here: http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/packages.html

I'm reporting this bug upstream now.

Anyway replacing lgeti by (long)cgeti as would be done by pariold.h works
like a charm.

polun, polx, zero and un were all defined in pariold.h but are not anywhere
anymore in pari-2.4. I cannot track the definition of gi in anything from 
pari-2.3, anyone knows where that come from and what it should be replaced with?
There is a line in pari-2.3 headers mentioning it but not a definition of it 
as far as I can see:

```
#define is_universal_constant(x) ((GEN)(x) >= gen_0 && (GEN)(x) <= gi)

this is in paristio.h form pari-2.3.5.

Lots of doctests simply fail because ideals have different generators:
"Fractional Ideal (a)" is the same ideal as "Fractional Ideal (-a)" but of course this makes doctests fail.

Simpler symptom:
 nffactor(polcyclo(21,y), x^2-y^7);

This is actually unrelated to #1070. It was due to an nf being replaced
by nf.pol --- because we use Trager's trick in that range instead of a
direct relative factorization, and don't need the nf data ---.
Unfortunately, a branch of the code later tried to acces nf.index, thus
accessing a random coefficient of the defining t_POL instead of the
relevant nf data.

Fixed in svn.

Cheers,

   K.B.
```
so we now have another reason for upgrading the source in the spkg.

We *really* need to release sage-4.5, so that somebody can get started with the next alpha (4.5.1).

That's pretty harsh.   Anyway, the pari upgrade is higher priority, so in fact it will be the other way around.

I think I just had a small break-through:

The gp command now has the so-called "breakloop" on by default.  This means the following: if Sage executes a command through the gp interface which gives errors, the following will be displayed in the pseudo-tty (invisible to the Sage user):

```
? 1/0
  ***   at top-level: 1/0
  ***                  ^--
  *** _/_: division by zero
  ***   Break loop: type 'break' to go back to GP
break>
```

Now gp just waits for user input.  Since that input will never come, it just sits there forever.

I have a temporary workaround for this:
in the directory SAGE_ROOT/local/bin, move "gp" to "gp-real".  Then create the following shell script called "gp":

```
!/bin/bash

mkdir -p $HOME/sage_debug
export HOME=$HOME/sage_debug
echo "breakloop = 0" >$HOME/.gprc

# Remove --fast option
exec $SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/gp-real --emacs --quiet --stacksize 100000000
```

This changes $HOME and makes a .gprc file in it which disables the break loop.  It then runs gp without --fast, so that the .gprc file is read.

Certainly, yes.  That's why I called my solution a "work-around".  What you want to do is every time a gp process gets started, the first line should be

Sorted,  I added one line (line 170) in sage/interfaces/gp.py which says

```
        self._eval_line('default(breakloop,0);')
```
to get the command run everytime a new gp instance is created.  Now we get

```
sage: gp.eval('1/0')
'  ***   at top-level: 1/0\n  ***                  ^--\n  *** _/_: division by zero'
```
(followed by a new sage: prompt) and also

```
RR(gp(exp(1)))
2.71828182845905
sage: 
```
with no problems.

Apologies for this outburst.  I did waste time, but only because of my inferior gp-script debugging skills.  Thanks to Jeroen there is a much simpler fix for what was troubling me!

The answer is at #7092:  because of a failure to build pari with gcc-4.4.1 as distributed by Fedora 11, on ALL Linux systems the OPTFLAG is set to -O1 instead of -O3.  Is there not a way to detect that particular compiler-distro combination?  Otherwise all Linux users suffer!

Note there is an error in spkg-install on the first line, which displays as:

In fact, I'm surprised that works at all.

This will not install for me.

## Build environment
* Sun Ultra 27 3.33 GHz Intel W3580 Xeon. Quad core. 8 threads. 
* 12 GB RAM
* OpenSolaris 2009.06 snv_134 X86
* Sage 4.5
* gcc 4.4.4

One likely cause of a problem is the `Dynamic Lib linker` does not include the -m64 flag (it should be included if SAGE64 is "yes").

I found out how to exclude a test from being run with test-all (there's a list in src/config/get_test) and the next version of the spkg will patch that file appropriately.

Replying to [cremona](#comment%3A72):

The type at the start of spkg-install is in the current version of pari. I'm puzzled it works at all, but it seems to. 

I was mistaken on the LINKER FLAGS, as that include CFLAGS, so the -m64 will get there from that. 

However, this still thinks gmp is broken. The version of Pari in Sage at the moment reports:

```
Checking for optional libraries and headers...
...Found libgmp in /rootpool2/local/kirkby/sage-4.5-hacked-for-64-bit-solaris/local/lib
...Found gmp header in /rootpool2/local/kirkby/sage-4.5-hacked-for-64-bit-solaris/local/include
Using GNU MP, version 4.3.1
...Found libX11 in /usr/openwin/lib
...Found X11 header files in /usr/openwin/include/X11
```

compared to this version, where I see: 

```
Checking for optional libraries and headers...
...Found libgmp in /export/home/drkirkby/sage-4.5/local/lib
...Found gmp header in /export/home/drkirkby/sage-4.5/local/include
ld.so.1: solaris-ix86-rlv23868: fatal: libgmp.so.10: open failed: No such file or directory
./Configure[79]: .: line 38: 24072: Killed
### Your version of GMP is too old for PARI. Please upgrade
### Building without GNU MP support
Hi-Res Graphics: none
...Found libreadline in /export/home/drkirkby/sage-4.5/local/lib
```

So something has changed for the worst. 

This version from svn wants bison too, so you will have to generate the files, since bison is not a prerequisite for Sage, and is not included in Sage.

Hi, 
John or someone else can perhaps convey this to the Pari developers. Would it be possible for them to add the -fPIC option on at least all Solaris systems. (Both SPARC and x86). If code goes into a shared library, it should be compiled position independent. It is unreliable if this is not done. There's some relevant information about this here. 

http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.5.0/gcc/Code-Gen-Options.html#Code-Gen-Options
http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.5.0/gcc/Link-Options.html#Link-Options

I believe it would be more reliable to build with -fPIC when the code is going into a shared library - irrespective of the platform. What one should ensure though is there is not a mixture of PIC and non-PIC code, as that can be unreliable too. 

I've not had a chance to look at the other issues, but as far as I can see, this update completely breaks a 64-bit build on Solaris or OpenSolaris. 

I've also noticed that Pari reports that *readline* is not working on Solaris systems. Yet the *readline* is definitely working in my Sage builds on Solaris. Several parts of Sage link against readline (Pari, gap, Singular, ECL, Python ...). None of them believe that *readline* is broken, but Pari does.

I was planning to do this (report upstream).  On the positive side, they just put in a patch which obviates the need for 2/3 of our patch to the header files paripriv/paridecl.h.

I think we will have a better chance of a positive reaction if we could report to pari a failure to build of pari as such and not pari-in-Sage, since they would reasonably reposond that as we patch some files they cannot be responsible.  For this, just copy the src directory of the most recent spkg (or wait until I put up p5 later today) and try it directly, after ./Configure <whatever-params> and make whatever.

John,
 
I'm going to attach to the ticket a failure observed with the Pari source code directly - outside of Sage. No compiler flags were set. 

The hack of mine in Sage (adding `-fPIC`) resolves this, but it would be better if it could be fixed upstream. The file was actually 5.1 MB in size, as there are over 95,000 error messages. I've reduce the filed to 23 KB, but removing tons of very similar looking messages. See the file:

`Pari-trunk-failure-on-OpenSolaris_x64.log.txt`

There are similar issues on Solaris 10 SPARC. I can attach a log if needed, or someone can just try to build on 't2' outside of Pari. You will see very similar. 

I believe this should be applied on all platforms, as it will be more reliable. The code should be position independent if you are building shared libraries. 

Dave

I mean someone could try this on 't2.math.washington.edu' without using Sage. I'm sure William would set up an account for a Pari developer. They only need the Pari source - no Sage code to reproduce this error.

Not yet. I think William is upstream for genus2reduction. 


I thought it should be attached to that ticket. I haven't seen any other

you are probably right that they should have separate ticket but they should

Amazing discovery -- the script spkg-install is VERY broken, even the one currently distributed with sage 4.5!

There are several lines like 

```
# pjeremy: fix for FreeBSD: #7825
cp "$TOP"/patches/get_kernel config/
```
which should say

```
# pjeremy: fix for FreeBSD: #7825
cp "$TOP"/patches/get_kernel src/config/
```
(note the missing "src").

If I am right, how come anything works?  I mean, if these patches are supposedly essential, but are in effect not being applied, maybe they are not so essential after all?

I can change these to be "correct";  but am more tempted to delete them and see what happens...thoughts?

I think you are mistaken John. Further up the script is 

```
cd src
```

so another `src` would be an error. 

I do sometimes think it is better to perhaps consider deleting all patches. I have just updated 'GSL' (#9533). GSL is a much simpler package I admit. I removed all patches. The new GSL package has built and passed all self-tests on Cygwin, Linux, HP-UX, OpenSolaris, OS X and Solaris. (Sage does not build fully on HP-UX, but enough of it builds to prove that GSL passes all tests). 

I hope at some point you are going to test on 't2'. I simply do not have the time to test everyones updates on 't2'.

You are right -- I cross-poseted to sage-devel where this was pointed out to me.

I did a complete from scratch build of sage-4.5.1 with the new patches and did a long doctest.  I got some more errors than John:

```
        sage -t -long devel/sage-test/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/heegner.py # 7 doctests failed
        sage -t -long devel/sage-test/sage/rings/number_field/number_field.py # 18 doctests failed
        sage -t -long devel/sage-test/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_point.py # 2 doctests failed
        sage -t -long devel/sage-test/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_generic.py # 1 doctests failed
        sage -t -long devel/sage-test/sage/rings/number_field/number_field_rel.py # 3 doctests failed
        sage -t -long devel/sage-test/sage/rings/number_field/number_field_element.pyx # 2 doctests failed
        sage -t -long devel/sage-test/sage/rings/number_field/number_field_ideal.py # 17 doctests failed
        sage -t -long devel/sage-test/sage/rings/number_field/number_field_ideal_rel.py # 3 doctests failed

        sage -t -long devel/sage-test/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_rational_field.py # 1 doctests failed
```

Some are probably because John did not do "long" doctests, but also in some cases I get PariError: not enough memory.  For example:

```
File "/usr/local/src/sage-newpari-4.5.1/devel/sage-test/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_generic.py", line 2646:
    sage: [t[1] for t in EllipticCurve(GF(10^60+3201),[0,a,0,b,0])._p_primary_torsion_basis(2)]
Exception raised:
[...]
    PariError: not enough memory (28)
```

I will have a look at these errors and see what I can fix.

For more on the bison issue see the pari-dev thread here: http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/archives/pari-dev-1007/msg00011.html

It seems that we should not use an svn source grad in our distribution but a "proper PARI tarball".  An explanation of how to create such a thing is I hope forthcoming on that thread.

I'll try it if I get a chance over the next couple of days.

As I see it there are now two main issues:

1. Make sure that the other spkgs which use the pari library still work.  I think someone said that genus2reduction and lcalc have problems.
2. Rebase to 4.5.2.

I tried it on OpenSolaris. There are a few error messages:


Here's the first

```
Checking for optional libraries and headers...

...Found gmp header in /export/home/drkirkby/sage-4.5/local/include

./Configure[79]: .: line 38: 10904: Killed
### Your version of GMP is too old for PARI. Please upgrade

```

**This is a new bug first seen in Pari 2.4.3 and does not appear in Pari 2.3.5**

And another. 

```

...Found libgmp in /export/home/drkirkby/sage-4.5/local/lib
...Found gmp header in /export/home/drkirkby/sage-4.5/local/include

./Configure[79]: .: line 38: 10904: Killed
### Your version of GMP is too old for PARI. Please upgrade
### Building without GNU MP support
```

I've seen this before, but it is very odd, as other packages in Sage use the readline, and clearly readline is used when Sage runs - i.e. I have edit the command line, recall previous commands etc. 

And another problem with that package. 

```
../src/test/dotest[30]: cat: /../patches/status: cannot open [No such file or directory]
```

** This is new to pari-2.4.3.svn.p6.log and does not appear in earlier pari 2.4.3 packages which have been posted on this ticket**


IMHO, it would be good if the package number included the snv snapshot - in this case 12541.

Have the other issues that are circumvented by hacks to spkg-install been reported upstream? Such as:

```
# These two are needed so that Sage can catch pari's error signals. 
cp "$PATCHED/init.c"  src/language/init.c
cp "$PATCHED/mp.c"    src/kernel/gmp/mp.c 
```

Then's these this not very clearly documented patch

```
cp "$PATCHED/get_dlld" config/
```

And another, this time a bit better documented, though no trac number. 

```
# mabshoff: This patch is to get around problem in PPC 32-bit Linux build
# (but it is ok on any other machine)
cp "$PATCHED/get_dlcflags" config/
```
(That is probably the -fPIC issue which will soon be able to be removed)

```
# pjeremy: fix for FreeBSD: #7825
cp "$PATCHED/get_kernel" config/
```

Then this. 

```
# cwitty: disable -rpath
cp "$PATCHED/get_ld" config/
```

And another. 

```
# This is needed or there are weird locale problems involving rpath
# with building Sage.
LC_ALL=C
export LC_ALL
LANG=C
export LANG
```

And another

```
    if [ "$UNAME" = "CYGWIN" ]; then
        # There are weird bugs in PARI's build process on Windows XP
        # under Cygwin.
        # Passing in this extra flag gets around the bug.
        $MAKE GMPINCLUDE=-I$SAGE_LOCAL/include EXTRADLLDFLAGS=-lgmp gp
    else
        $MAKE gp
    fi
```

And another


```
        # Also another patch since paripriv.h won't compile right on OS X
        # when used by client Sage code.  So we replace it by a slightly
        # modified version.
        cp -pf "$PATCHED/paripriv.h" "$SAGE_LOCAL/include/pari/paripriv.h"
```

That's a lot of patches to one program. How many of these issues have been raised? Personally, I would be very tempted to remove these, and find what fails. Otherwise maintenance of the package is going to be very difficult.

Hi Dave we have some of these patch as well in Gentoo (and I mean in the distro
itself not just sage-on-gentoo). So I can fill in some gaps.


get_dlld: we have this

```
	# propagate ldflags
	sed -i \
		-e 's/-shared $extra/-shared $extra \\$(LDFLAGS)/' \
		config/get_dlld || die "Failed to fix LDFLAGS"
```
We add -fpic on all platforms when building the library but not gp or static libraries. 

But we have a patch I think originating from Debian to add support 
for linux ppc 32 bits.

get_ld: when gp is compiled it uses libpari and is compiled -rpath to hardcode the libray location. I am not sure this is strictly necessary.



Not sure about the CYGWIN and OS X stuff.

I got this email  from Bill Allombert on the `Bug#1078: Pari, -fPIC and Solaris` thread:

```

```

So it seems we should remove the -fPIC patch for PPC Linux, and the -fPIC patch for Solaris will be able to be removed later, but not yet. 

IMHO, it would be better to remove all the patch (or just comment them out for now), and put them back as and when they are needed, taking care (where possible), to check if the bugs they are supposed to fix reoccur. This is one of the more messy spkg-install files I've seen - though the ATLAS one is pretty messy too!

I applied the p7 spkg fine to 4.5.2.alpha0, and the (two) extcode patches above, and the new sagelib_9343_combined3.patch .

Very impressed that the latter applied without any merge problems -- thanks, Jeroen.  I will test and fix what I find in elliptic_curves (except perhaps the failures in heegner.py).

Why do you chose that name? The .p7 should only be integrated into Sage where there are 7 previous versions of 2.4.3. Since the software says 

```
Shall we try to build pari 2.4.3 (development svn-12543) now (y/n)? [n]
```

I think a better name would be

```
pari-2.4.3.svn-12543
```

as that is the version of Pari that it is based upon. Then, assuming this version was merged, subsequent updates in Sage would be called pari-2.4.3.svn-12543.p0, pari-2.4.3.svn-12543.p1, pari-2.4.3.svn-12543.p2 etc. 

Certainly, the first revision put into Sage should not have a patch level of 7. 

http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/patching_spkgs.html

says *If the upstream package is taken from some revision other than a stable version, you need to append the date at which the revision is made, e.g. the Singular package singular-3-1-0-4-20090818.p3.spkg is made with the revision as of 2009-08-18. *

However, I think in this case, the fact the upstream does have a version number (in this case 2.4.3.svn-12543), that should be used rather than a date.

There's one test failure in ell_rational_field (extraneous warning output from eclib) which will go away if the patches from #9247 are applied, so I think there is no need to do anything about this at present.

I wish I could say I was as impressed with the installation on OpenSolaris:

```
Checking for optional libraries and headers...
...Found libgmp in /export/home/drkirkby/sage-4.5.2.alpha0/local/lib
...Found gmp header in /export/home/drkirkby/sage-4.5.2.alpha0/local/include
ld.so.1: solaris-ix86-rlv7589: fatal: libgmp.so.10: open failed: No such file or directory
./Configure[79]: .: line 38: 8207: Killed
### Your version of GMP is too old for PARI. Please upgrade
### Building without GNU MP support
```

The version currently in Sage works fine - this is broken. 

This does not seem an upstream problem, as it builds fine outside of the Sage environment. 

Dave

Allright, maybe I was a bit too quick by the excitement of having fixed these!  I just uploaded new versions (with the same filenames).

Now I am doing a complete from-scratch build of Sage with the new spkg's.  This will be a build without any trace of an old version of PARI.  Let's wait and see...

I've found what the problem with the GMP and Readline are on Solaris. Setting CFLAGS to include -m64 flag is not sufficient, but setting 

CC="$CC -m64"

works. 

I also made a few other improvements to spkg-install. 
* Allow one to set SAGE_DEBUG=yes to set no optimisation. Primarily for debugging purposes, but would also be useful if people (like on Fedora once) found gcc mis-compiled Pari. 
* Check SAGE_ROOT actually exists as is required in the Sage Developers guide
* Allow the setting SAGE_TUNE_pari=yes to get increased performance, at a cost of letting Pari do the tuning. 

I changed the filename to show the actual svn version - you can see this reported when you run configure. 

New package at 

http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/patches/pari-2.4.3svn-12543.spkg

That now does build properly on OpenSolaris. 

Dave

What I had been planning to say about the spkg's name is:  All the various pari-2.4.3.svn.p?.spkg on this ticket up to now have been alpha things which were never intended for anyone other than those working on this ticket;  and we should give the spkg a proper name (to which further patch levels could be applied later, after this becomes the Sage standard spkg) once we reached something like a beta level, or even after the authors on this ticket were all happy with it.

The latest version may or may not be the final one!  But it gets better every time.

[I may have a little time later today but then I'll be travelling.  In any case, it will soon be time to mark the ticket "needs review" and prod likely suspects to thoroughly test it!]

Even for alpha releases, as it's obvious then if its based on a different version of the upstream source code. Those editing this ticket will be in no doubt if the source has changed or not. \n\nFor actual packages in Sage, the Developers Guide says to have the date on SVN snapshots, but since we can get an actual number, that seems more sensible to me. Also, I've found if one puts a date, what often happens is someone updates the package and instead of putting .p0, then just change the date. At that point, the date bears no resemblance to what's in the upstream code on that date. \n\nAnyway, http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/patches/pari-2.4.3svn-12543.spkg \n\nwill build properly on OpenSolaris. \n\nI managed to get a core dump when tuning it, but that's less of an issue. I will report that upstream. I've found Bill very helpful. I've just reported the CC/CFLAGS bug upstream, though have got no feedback yet. \n\nI can see tuning Pari is slow. I can build Pari in 33 seconds on this machine, but it was 24 minutes until I got a core dump when tuning. So I don't know how long tuning would take. But it seems sensible to give the user that option if they are blessed with lots of computer power or lots of patience. Looking at some of the timing data, it looked like the differences in algorithms was significant, and so worth optimising if you want to make a lot of use of Pari. \n\nBTW, the source code in that package is the same as created by jdemeyer, and is not the latest upstream code as I write. But I chose not to change the source code - just spkg-install, so it will work properly on OpenSolaris. \n\nDave \nDave",

Replying to [cremona](#comment%3A133):
> What I had been planning to say about the spkg's name is:  


I would think it worth keeping the svn snapshot number in there at all times. Even for alpha releases, as it's obvious then if its based on a different version of the upstream source code. Those editing this ticket will be in no doubt if the source has changed or not. 

For actual packages in Sage, the Developers Guide says to have the date on SVN snapshots, but since we can get an actual number, that seems more sensible to me. Also, I've found if one puts a date, what often happens is someone updates the package and instead of putting .p0, then just change the date. At that point, the date bears no resemblance to what's in the upstream code on that date. 

Anyway, http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/patches/pari-2.4.3svn-12543.spkg 

will build properly on OpenSolaris. 

I managed to get a core dump when tuning it, but that's less of an issue. I will report that upstream. I've found Bill very helpful. I've just reported the CC/CFLAGS bug upstream, though have got no feedback yet. 

I can see tuning Pari is slow. I can build Pari in 33 seconds on this machine, but it was 24 minutes until I got a core dump when tuning. So I don't know how long tuning would take. But it seems sensible to give the user that option if they are blessed with lots of computer power or lots of patience. Looking at some of the timing data, it looked like the differences in algorithms was significant, and so worth optimising if you want to make a lot of use of Pari. 

BTW, the source code in that package is the same as created by jdemeyer, and is not the latest upstream code as I write. But I chose not to change the source code - just spkg-install, so it will work properly on OpenSolaris.

`make test-all`

will always fail with just the upstream source unless some of the tests are disabled, since they rely on one or more databased that are not in Sage unless optional components are installed.

The last patch fixes the tanh() issue, it was caused by RR(0.0)._pari_() creating an invalid GEN (it took me a very long time to figure this out).

I added a debug() function to gen objects calling dbgGEN() from the pari library, example:

```
sage: pari('[1/2, 1.0*I]').debug()  # random addresses
[&=0000000004c5f010] VEC(lg=3):2200000000000003 0000000004c5eff8 0000000004c5efb0
  1st component = [&=0000000004c5eff8] FRAC(lg=3):0800000000000003 0000000004c5efe0 0000000004c5efc8
    num = [&=0000000004c5efe0] INT(lg=3):0200000000000003 (+,lgefint=3):4000000000000003 0000000000000001
    den = [&=0000000004c5efc8] INT(lg=3):0200000000000003 (+,lgefint=3):4000000000000003 0000000000000002
  2nd component = [&=0000000004c5efb0] COMPLEX(lg=3):0c00000000000003 00007fae8a2eb840 0000000004c5ef90
    real = gen_0
    imag = [&=0000000004c5ef90] REAL(lg=4):0400000000000004 (+,expo=0):6000000000000000 8000000000000000 0000000000000000
```

Apart from that, a lot of cleanups, and some more doctests.

As far as I can tell, everything works now on my system, apart from some doctest failures in elliptic_curves (again, I do not plan to look at this).

I am testing on a 32-bit Linux system.  The build went fine, there seem to be a few doctest errors though: we might need to special-case 32 vs. 64 bits in some places.

Now that sage-4.5.2alpha1 is released, I will check whether the patches still apply properly.

Fair enough, but I may as well report that all was good on 64-bit ubuntu except 

```

        sage -t  -long local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sagenb-0.8.1-py2.6.egg/sagenb/misc/sageinspect.py # 1 doctests failed

To be more precise, 12543 was ok, 12549 failed all tests. What bugs has 12577 introduced? 

Is there any chance of convincing the Pari developers to actually make a well-tested stable release? The Pari developers can make commits to svn more rapidly than Sage developers can test the code. That's 34 different source versions in 13 days. Would anyone like to try to convince me these are well tested?

We might discover bugs in PARI itself as well, which hopefully would get fixed upstream (quickly in the svn, but probably not immediately in a [new] stable version). I though would prefer to base the new spkg on an "official", i.e. stable version, too.

> Personally, I'd revert to the svn which underwent a fair amount of testing. 


I think since it seems a whole release will be dedicated to updating PARI, there will be enough testing anyway. But of course we'll have to freeze our snapshot at some point, when the appointed Sage release date/cycle comes close(r).

> Well, I agree that we shouldn't upgrade the source all too often.  But if the PARI developers fix a bug that we found, that is a good reason to update (and that is also why I updated to 12577).

I've changed the title to reflect more accurately what the ticket is. It's **not** an update to version 2.4.3 of Pari. Version 2.4.2 has not even been released - only an alpha of that is available

http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/pub/pari/testing/pari-2.4.2.alpha.tar.gz

This is an svn snapshot, but the ticket title implied something quite different. 

Note the developers guide says the date the snapshot was downloaded should be in the package name. However, that seems to cause confusion to me, as when people update the package, they keep changing the date, rather than adding .p0, .p1, .p2 etc. In any case, different snapshots can exist on the same day. Putting the actual snapshot number seems more sensible to me. So I think it would be better if this was called pari-svn12577.spkg, to reflect that fact it is a snapshot, and not a stable release as the package name would imply. Otherwise follow the developers guide. IMHO, this should not be called pari-2.4.3. 

When 2.4.3 is released, it would seem sensible Pari is updated to a stable release. But that's less likely to happen if people see from the package name that we already have the latest release. 

Of course, if the snapshot that's used gets updated, then that should be reflected in the ticket title! 

BTW, before thinking about updating the snapshot once again, take a read of of the book [The Mythical Man-Month](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month) in particular one of the authors points [that in a suitably complex system there is a certain irreducible number of errors. Any attempt to fix observed errors tends to result in the introduction of other errors.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month#The_tendency_towards_irreducible_number_of_errors) I've certainly experienced this before many times - including a previous snapshot on this very ticket.

elliptic_curves/ell_rational_field.py:  I checked that the new output from the doctest is as valid as the old one (there is just a slightly different LLL-reduced basis, which is a reasonable side-effect of changes to the pari library which does the LLL reduction).

John, could you try reinstalling the "old" lcalc p1 package (by `./sage -f ...`)?

Perhaps this would show the error #9592 (Jeroen's new lcalc spkg) is intended to fix.

I did that and it does not show the error.  Note that Jeroen's patch at #9592 just changes one source file (src/Lcommand_line_elliptic.cc) and in that file changes 

```
    F[1] = lgeti(BIGDEFAULTPREC);
```
to

```
    F[1] = (long)cgeti(BIGDEFAULTPREC);
```
and 4 similar lines.  It is possible that during our work on this ticket some change in Pari means that old version works again.  So I think that we can cancel #9592 and remove the new spkg from the instruction on this ticket.  I will try that and report back.

Yes. I could reproduce the build error of the old lcalc spkg with new PARI; John's new one (p2) at #9592 (Jeroen's p1 rebased on Sage's current one) builds.

The number (and type) of warnings I get by doing so (building lcalc) though is IMHO a shame. Besides other annoying warnings, there are twelve deprecation warnings (with gcc 4.4.4). (Of course many warnings have the same origin, but that makes fixing them even easier. This isn't meant as an offense, but rather a suggestion.)

Exactly the same on Ubuntu 9.04 x86_64 (Core2, gcc 4.3.3, native code, O2), except that I did run `testlong` instead of `ptestlong` because the machine was already heavily loaded.

(The lcalc build warnings are the same, too, btw.)

Perhaps for #9592. If only all (severe) warnings originated from upstream...


P.S. to the build and test reports:

I do get a Sphinx warning:

```
docstring of sage.libs.pari.gen.PariInstance.read:8: (WARNING/2) Literal block expected; none found.

I looked into the failures in heegner.py in extreme detail, and the problem is entirely because of the following.  

```
CURRENT SAGE:

Wall time: 1.97 s
[(5207, -2829, -1845), (-5207, 2829, 1845)]

NEW SAGE (with NEW PARI):

sage: Q = QuadraticForm(QQ,3,[ 8657345368, 12759737420, 29300965980,4701524895, 21592798720, 24792432640 ])

Wall time: 1.85 s

The difference is just that the vectors with given norm output by pari are now in a different order.  This causes some output to be slightly different in Sage, but is not a bug.   So it is 100% safe to change the output in heegner.py to match what gets output now. 

---

Regarding the error in ell_rational_field.py -- the *only* remaining issue -- this is a doctest that John Cremona introduced for trac 4525: http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/4525

The difference is that "a" LLL reduced basis is now slightly different.  This seems extremely plausible, since PARI's LLL code was completely changed in this new version (I recall Bill A. telling me they incorporated a version of fplll into PARI).  So very likely that doctest is fine too.  John C is the one who should sign off on it though, not Robert B (you're in the clear).

I've taken the liberty of posting a patch that fixes the heegner.py tests, and also the one LLL test in ell_rational_field.py (though I'd like to hear from John C. about that).

Can you also fix the Sphinx warning?

In case this ticket gets merged soon, we should also address #9722 (Fedora 13 FLTK issue, at least the linker error) *here*. (Though I haven't yet checked if it is still present in our current svn snapshot; will do that later.)

`s/optinal/optional/`

There are some back-ticks (and double back-ticks, e.g around `True`) missing in docstrings.

Normalizing "PARI"/"Pari"/"pari" (and e.g. <code>\`L\`-function</code> vs. `L-function`) would be nice, too... :)

Yes: from http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/ we see:

```
    * PARI is a C library, allowing fast computations.
    * gp is an easy-to-use interactive shell giving access to the PARI functions.
    * GP is the name of gp's scripting language.

The official name of MATLAB is MATLAB, but still the Sage has:

*Mission: Creating a viable free open source alternative to Magma, Maple, Mathematica and Matlab.*

I've tried suggesting we call MATLAB by its official name, but that fell on deaf ears. 

In general, I'd rather call programs by their official name, though in same cases, the programs themselves are not consistent!

Also passed `ptestlong` on Fedora 13 x86 (Pentium 4 Prescott), with and without optimization (i.e. `O2` in "global" `CFLAGS`), native code.

The version prior to this, i.e. without William's patches (but John's reviewer patch), passed all long tests on Ubuntu 7.10 x86 (Pentium 4, gcc 4.2.1, native code, O2), too.

I just tried the steps outlined at the top. 

* Pari installed ok
* genus2reduction installed ok
* lcalc installed ok. 
* extcode_9343_combined3.patch patch to data/extcode installed ok. 
 
Then when I tried to apply the library patches, I was less than successful. I'm not sure though if the 

```
hg qpush -a
```
was the right thing to do after `hg qimport` of the library patches. So I could have made a mistake, but this is what I did, and this is what results I got. (This is an OpenSolaris system, which apart from some numerical noise issues, and a totally busted `sympow` otherwise passes all the doc tests.)

You're applying the patches in the wrong order.  I usually do

```
$ hg qimport <patch>
$ hg qpush
$ hg qimport <patch>
$ hg qpush
...
```

which should work fine.  Maybe there is a better way, I don't know much about Mercurial.

Announce on sage-release? ;-)

Btw, Mitesh is currently compiling [Sage 4.5.3.alpha1](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/query?group=component&order=priority&col=id&col=summary&col=status&col=owner&col=type&col=priority&col=milestone&merged=~4.5.3.alpha1) (which includes the new Singular, a new libm4ri and an updated PolyBoRi package, and some bug fixes).

But I did not type 

`hg qpush`

but instead 

{{{hg qpush -a}}

Looking for help on that:

```
drkirkby@hawk:~$ hg qpush -h
hg qpush [-f] [-l] [-a] [-m] [-n NAME] [PATCH | INDEX]

push the next patch onto the stack

    When -f/--force is applied, all local changes in patched files
    will be lost.

options:

 -f --force  apply if the patch has rejects
 -l --list   list patch name in commit text
 -a --all    apply all patches
 -m --merge  merge from another queue
 -n --name   merge queue name

use "hg -v help qpush" to show global options
```

I interpret that is meaning all of them would be applied. 

Dave

Sure -- what is (possibly) counter intuitive is the *order* in which they are applied, which is the reverse of the order they were imported.  For this reason I find "hg qpush -a" rarely useful.

I decided to test the http://cage.ugent.be/~jdemeyer/sage/sage-4.6.prealpha0.tar on my OpenSolaris machine. Sage has never passed all the doc tests on OpenSolaris, so I did not expect it to. I'll list the failures and what I think they are due to. There's one unexecpted failure. 

A better test would be on 't2', but that takes forever to build Sage. This is an order of magnitude quicker. 

```
The following tests failed:

	sage -t  -long devel/sage/sage/lfunctions/sympow.py # 13 doctests failed
	sage -t  -long devel/sage/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_quotient_ring.py # 1 doctests failed
	sage -t  -long devel/sage/sage/modular/abvar/abvar.py # 1 doctests failed
	sage -t  -long devel/sage/sage/modular/hecke/submodule.py # 1 doctests failed
	sage -t  -long devel/sage/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_rational_field.py # 17 doctests failed
	sage -t  -long devel/sage/sage/stats/hmm/chmm.pyx # 3 doctests failed
	sage -t  -long devel/sage/sage/symbolic/expression.pyx # 2 doctests failed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Total time for all tests: 1913.9 seconds
```

1) `devel/sage/sage/lfunctions/sympow.py` SYMPOW is the worst code I've ever seen in Sage and is broken on Solaris x86 (#9703), Cygwin (#9166) and reportedly ArchLinux too. The examples at http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/sage/lfunctions/sympow.html do not work if you try them on sage.math, so I we can ignore this failure. The code in SYMPOW is so bad, I can't really be bothered to try to fix it. 

2) `devel/sage/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_quotient_ring.py` **An unexpected failure.** 

3) `devel/sage/sage/modular/abvar/abvar.py` Caused by SYMPOW. So we can ignore that. 

4) `devel/sage/sage/modular/hecke/submodule.py` Again, caused by SYMPOW, so we can ignore that. 
 
5) `devel/sage/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_rational_field.py` Again, caused by SYMPOW, so we can ignore that. 

6) `devel/sage/sage/stats/hmm/chmm.pyx` This is numerical noise, #9735, which will hopefully be merged soon. 

7) ` devel/sage/sage/symbolic/expression.pyx` Again numerical noise (#9689  & #9693). 

So the unexpected failure I see was this one:

Maybe rather than directly testing the answer, one could do something like this:

```
sage: x = [calculation]; abs(x - 2.975975720740376676146967119) < 10^(-27)
True
```
That would be less dangerous, while still allowing the necessary flexibility.

The first question I personally need answering is should the number be real or complex? 

I might guess the small imaginary component should not be there at all, but would my guess be right? I'm not a mathematician. 

Only when I know the answer to that question do I feel able to comment on a test. 

Given the number of digits that are printed (> 16), this would suggest to me that arbitrary precision maths is being used, and not just a floating point processor. If so, the answer should be the same irrespective of whether the machine is 32-bit or 64-bit. Rounding errors occur in floating point processors - they do not on integer arithmetic if done properly. 

If this is being done with just an FPU, then printing these number of digits is a bit pointless.

It is real.  The list is the list of values of `z^2` as z runs over the roots of `f = x^5 + x + 17`, which has exactly one real root, listed first.  Apart from precision the output should be the same as 

```
sage: [z[0]^2 for z in f.roots(CC)]
[2.97572074037668, -2.40889943716139 + 1.90254105303505*I, -2.40889943716139 - 1.90254105303505*I, 0.921039066973047 - 3.07553311884578*I, 0.921039066973047 + 3.07553311884578*I]
```
The function being tested is rather general, so one could not expect the function's code to test for this special case (I think).  Still, it is disappointing that the imaginary part is not a better approximation to zero than it is.

It is a complex embedding, so the output is a [ComplexNumber](ComplexNumber), ideally with real part zero. The precision is 100 bit. This indeed makes 10^{-27} a bit disappoint.

Whilst the doctest can be changed to make this pass, is a real bug being covered up? 

Can anyone explain why a calculation performed with integers should differ depending on whether the program is compiled 32-bit or 64-bit? Since to me, of the arbitrary precision maths is implemented correctly, they should give the same result. I never get any issues like this with the MPFR tests.

> Whilst the doctest can be changed to make this pass, is a real bug being covered up? 

I would rather say on the contrary.  The problem was that we were computing the roots of a polynomial with complex non-exact roots.  I.e.: instead of computing the roots of x^5+x-17, we were computing the roots of (1.0 + 0.0*I)*x^5 + ...  I changed that in my patch.

This is not always true because the precisions might be different.  In PARI, the precision is always a multiple of the machine word size.  If you try to compute with 90 bits of precision, you will get 96 bits of precision on a 32-bit machine but you will get 128 bits of precision on a 64-bit machine.

If might be possible to change this such that PARI always uses a multiple of 64 bits of precision (I have been thinking about this), but it's not so easy.

OK, fair point. Now I understand. I was under the impression 100 bits were being used. 

After applying Jeroen's patch

All tests passed!

```

I've set this to positive review. 

I copied all the authors to reviewers, as I think everyone that has wrote part of it has reviewed part of it. I also added Leif and Fran√ßois as reviewers, as they have contributed too. But I've not done an extensive search to see who should be on the reviewer and the author list. I suspect there are some missing.

powerpc-apple-darwin8-gcc-4.0.1 (GCC) 4.0.1 (Apple Computer, Inc. build 5367)

Is somebody else able to test this architecture?  Just in case the problem is with the machine and not with PARI (I know essentially nothing about Darwin, I just asked a collegue to test it on his machine).

Perhaps add `-fno-common` to `DLCFLAGS` in `config/get_dlcflags` if `$osname` is `darwin`.

Just a guess, I don't play with apples.

I'm pretty sure this will fix it. In PARI 2.3.x, we patched `get_dlcflags`:

```sh
_dl_list="DLCFLAGS"
if test -n "$__gnuc__"; then
  # Some architectures need -fPIC for building dynamic lib
  # *-i?86|*-sparc*|*-powerpc|*-s390|*-mips) DLCFLAGS=
  case "$osname-$arch" in
    *-hppa|*-ia64|*-alpha|*-arm|*-m68k|*linux-ppc) DLCFLAGS=-fPIC ;;
    *-x86_64|*-sparc*|*-amd64) case "$sizeof_long" in
              8) DLCFLAGS=-fPIC;;
              esac;;
    darwin-*) DLCFLAGS=-fno-common;;
  esac
else
  case "$osname-$arch" in
    hpux-*) DLCFLAGS=+z;;
    solaris-sparc*) case "$sizeof_long" in
              8) DLCFLAGS=-KPIC;; # assume sun cc
              esac;;
  esac
fi

echo "C compiler is          $CC $CFLAGS $DLCFLAGS"
```

(Note the `darwin-*`. A number of other changes has been dropped...)

I forget who it was, but someone proposed something like this SAGE_THREADS_$packagename where the '$packagename' would be lower case. I think that's quite a reasonable idea. It potentially allows the name to be automatically generated.

I notice this message when pari is being installed:

```
To sage build time, Pari will not be tuned for your systems
If you want higher performance, at the expense of a slower build
set the environment variable SAGE_TUNE_pari=yes by typing the following
before building Sage (or at least before building Pari)
```
Aside from the lack of punctuation (a very minor point), I think there is a word missing in the first line: should it say "To *minimize* sage build time" or something like that?

Also, if you're introducing the environment variable `SAGE_TUNE_pari`, you should also document it in the Sage installation guide -- see the section on environment variables in SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/doc/en/installation/source.rst.

When were these dropped - since I tested this on OpenSolaris, or are these other changes? I can't keep up with the changes on this ticket! 

Without trying to build in HP-UX I don't know for sure what will be needed, and I don't have time to try that now.

In that case, it's pointless worrying about them now. Sage will not build with SunStudio and does not build on HP-UX. These are two things I'd like to fix (especially the former), but they are not critical to this ticket. Any issues like that can go on another ticket.

This needs work now.

* If the files in {{{patches/files}} directory are not supposed to be under revision control, then the directory should be added to .hgignore. But it's hard to understand why the files should be present, but not under revision control.

On sage.math at least, if I don't tell it to tune, then everything builds and all tests pass.  On the mac, everything builds, but it hasn't finished testing.

I'm attaching a patch which reports:

```
Pari will be tuned for your system since you set SAGE_TUNE_pari="yes". This can take a long time.
WARNING: Tuning Pari is VERY unreliable. You may find your build
of Pari fails, or Pari does not work properly once built.
```

or 

```
To minimize Sage build time and to ensure the best relieability,
Pari will not be tuned for your system. Experience shows tuning
is unreliable - see
http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/9343
If you wish to test the tuning code, set the environment
variable SAGE_TUNE_pari=yes by typing the following
before building Sage (or at least before building Pari):
SAGE_TUNE_pari=yes
export SAGE_TUNE_pari
```

depending on whether `SAGE_TUNE_pari` i set to "yes" or not.

I can confirm what John found on 't2.math' - this package is now broken on Solaris 10 SPARC in at least 32-it mode. 

This is on my own personal machine, a Sun Blade 1000 with a pair of 900 MHz UltraSPARC III+ CPUs. It runs the very first release of Solaris 10 (March 2005), whereas t2.math runs a quite recent version. 

I think we are seeing the problems of working with unstable snapshots. An updated Pari was working on 't2' a few weeks ago - I posted the list of test failures above. Since then, the snapshot has been updated, which no doubt fixes one problem, but creates another. Last I noticed, the upstream snapshot was being updated three times per day on average. Clearly the snapshots are not well tested, yet we are using them, and doing the tests ourselves.

I suggest that we report this, and try to get a fix. But rather than download the latest snapshot, we just apply the fix we actually need. Otherwise we have to go thought a lengthly test cycle again. I'm sure it will be tempting to update to the latest snapshot to get even more bugs fixed, but how many will be added? 

Worth reading is a book by Fred Brooks called The Mythical Man-Month. 

Of particular note here is is point that [that in a suitably complex system there is a certain irreducible number of errors. Any attempt to fix observed errors tends to result in the introduction of other errors.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month#The_tendency_towards_irreducible_number_of_errors)

To report something *positive*, I've successfully - **without** PARI tuning - built and tested (`ptestlong`) the prealpha1 on:
* Fedora 13 x86 (P4 Prescott, gcc 4.4.4, native code with `O2`, parallel build with 6 jobs)
* Ubuntu 9.04 x86_64 (Core2, gcc 4.3.3, native code with `O3`, parallel build with 32 jobs)
* Ubuntu 9.04 x86_64 (Core2, gcc 4.5.0, native code with `O3`, parallel build with 16 jobs)

Btw, FLTK-devel was installed (and almost all X11 developer packages); PARI correctly did **not** attempt to build with this (since we configure with `--graphic=none`).

I think I've found the culprit of #9722 (PARI attempting to use FLTK for no reason):
**Lots** of "local" variables used in the PARI scripts aren't reset/initialized.

Try, e.g.:

```sh
$ export with_fltk=yes
$ ./Configure --graphic=none
```
in the PARI source directory, or

```sh
$ export with_fltk=yes
$ unset PARI_EXTRA_OPTS
$ ./sage -f pari-2.3.5.p2 # or the appropriate PARI version, e.g. 2.4.3.svn-12577.p2
```
in `$SAGE_ROOT`.

Jeroen, the last changes to p3 (`SPKG.txt`, `patches/README.txt`) aren't yet committed.

Thanks for setting up the Wiki page.

I'm working on #9722 btw, still hoping that it will make it into 4.5.3, since I don't believe 4.6 will be ready in time, and/or don't expect people to install a brand new major release (despite the ".0" missing) right before a new semester starts.

I'll take a closer look at p3 later; I don't think `PARI_EXTRA_OPTS` is yet documented though.

Jeroen, IIRC 4.6.prealpha1 is based on 4.5.3.alpha**0**, and doesn't contain all of the latest (#9343) changes, so perhaps update/correct the Wiki page s.t. people will test the lastest PARI(-related) spkgs and patches, not the old one(s) contained in the complete Sage distribution.

Please excuse if I'm wrong here...

(In case you prepare a new one, I think it should be prealpha2 to avoid confusion with the previous one.)

<a id='comment:2'></a>
I found out what prevents PARI/GP from compiling on Solaris.  The problem is that `/bin/sh` from Solaris doesn't know about `test -e <filename>`.
So there are two solutions:

**Solution 1**: In `Configure`, replace

```
#! /bin/sh
```
by

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash
```

**Solution 2**: In `config/Makefile.SH`, replace all occurances of

```
test -e
```
by

```
test -f
```

Using either of these solutions makes PARI/GP compile.

Since Sage assumes the existence of `bash`, we might as well apply the first solution anyway.  I will report this upstream.

It was not necessary to include #9703 and #9735 for Sage to pass all doc tests on Solaris 10 (SPARC), which is the only currently supported version of Solaris on Sage. Both of those tickets only affect x86 versions. They will not do any harm, but they were unnecessary. 

However, since #9703 has been merged, I would request that anyone that builds sage-4.6.prealpha3.tar, that they report on ticket #9703 of the success or failure of these three tests:

```
	sage -t  -long devel/sage/sage/modular/abvar/abvar.py # 
	sage -t  -long devel/sage/sage/lfunctions/sympow.py # 
	sage -t  -long devel/sage/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_rational_field.py 
```

#9703 still awaits positive review, so clearly evidence it is working on many systems will add to the confidence that the ticket is valid. Just adding a quick comment like "The three tests passed on <your system>" would be useful. 

Neither are those two tickets sufficient to cause all doc tests on Solaris 10 on x86 or OpenSolaris on x86, though they will reduce the number of failures. A couple more tickets need to be merged to get all doc tests to pass on Solaris 10 x86 - these are #9689 and #9693.

I would just keep my eye on the list of blockers for 4.5.3. There is a way of getting that list, but I don't know the link.

If you have little patience, I'll backport the changes from #9722 to #9343, perhaps a little bit cleaner regarding the messages/graphics detection when no graphics support was requested (I'd like to keep that, i.e. not completely disabling it). In addition, we should catch illegal parameters to `--graphic=`.

I don't know if you plan to make further changes to the PARI spkg.

From a first glance, the graphics detection in svn-12577 is cleaner, so the changes regarding that will be, too.

It's still not robust, and needs the same fixes as PARI 2.3.5, e.g.
* add `libstdc++` for `plotfltk`,
* handle libraries in `.../lib64` directories,
* make sure FLTK include directory really exists,
* less annoying/clarified messages.

I haven't yet dealt with graphics support using Qt, which can break the build, too. I.e., the detection should be improved to either give an error earlier or disable Qt in case not all required components are available.

Most of the other changes (`spkg-install`) still apply. In addition, there are superfluous tests of `$?` at the end which I had not removed in 2.3.5.p4 (but added comments to remove them).

No, I don't.  As far as I can tell, #9722 is the only remaining issue.

If you would like to port #9722 to #9343, go ahead and do it.  Otherwise, I can also do it (for me it's the same).

4.6.prealpha3 (with `PARI_EXTRA_OPTS` *not* set) also passed `ptestlong` on 32-bit Fedora 13.

On 64-bit Ubuntu 10.04 LTS the build failed in the first place (MPIR and Tachyon); simply rerunning `make` the build succeeded, and all long tests passed.

Perhaps another missing dependency that only rarely comes into play in parallel builds. (This never happened before, and 4.5.3.alpha2 built fine with the same settings). I'll have to inspect that further.

I though get three new Sphinx warnings:

```
docstring of sage.libs.pari.gen:136: (WARNING/2) Literal block expected; none found.
docstring of sage.libs.pari.gen.gen.nfbasis:8: (WARNING/2) Definition list ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.

Try sage -docbuild reference html.  Or look in the build log?  I think that "make" does not build the docs (I may be wrong on that) but "make testlong" does, so it might be in the test log.  Anyway, if you touch the offending files and do docbuild reference html it will presumable process them again.

Well, installing Tachyon actually did *not* fail; I hadn't looked at the whole log.

It first tries a 32-bit build (prepending `-m32` to `CFLAGS`), which indeed fails with a `make` error. But this is catched by some Tachyon script I think, followed by an attempt to do a 64-bit build, which then succeeds. Quite odd, though the whole process of installing the Tachyon spkg takes less than four seconds for me (on that machine)...

The MPIR failure seems to be due to a race condition:

I haven't looked at MPIR's Makefile(s); perhaps some dependency is missing there.

Leif, 

you should open a ticket for this Tachyon problem. Put what info you have and *cc* me. I'd like to know of anything that adds `-m32` as that sort of thing could screw up on any system, but particularly might screw up on systems were we add `-m64` as we do on 64-bit Solaris builds. As you say, it's well off topic for this ticket, which is already very very long. 

Dave

Any idea which patch from 4.6.prealpha3 could cause this?  I don't think MPIR or ECM depends on PARI/GP.

Nope. I'm not competent to track this down. But since the file containing the failing example also has a 9343-patched doctest (different *result* only), the code obviously (indirectly) uses PARI.

No, but the code depends on them.

I guess John C. will know. I just wonder *where* we should address such issues; #8664 (with #5847 mandatory) is likely to go into the 4.6 series. (Though perhaps not 4.6.0, I'm not the release manager.)

I think my guess (that you would know the code) was right. :-)

It's exactly the two **long** doctests you added at #8319 (as part of a regression doctest) that individually both segfault with MPIR 2.1.1 and ECM 6.3, in `EllipticCurvePoint_number_field.height()`.

OK, here's one way of testing this (perhaps).  I made an input file for gp which computes that same example:  http://www.warwick.ac.uk/staff/J.E.Cremona/pari-test.gp

To test this save the file and run it using `sage -gp pari-test.gp`.  If nothing goes wrong it should output some stuff ending with

I'm not that sure I made it right, but except for the number following "%", the output looks ok to me.

The segfaults when doctesting happen in `libgmp.so`, `mpn_submul_1()`, which is (indirectly) called by `__gmpn_divexact()` (gdb stack), but the origin/cause seems to be `sage/libs/pari/gen.pyx`, `gen.__setitem__()`, or its caller `EllipticCurvePoint_field.__getitem__()`... I don't recall when I last used debuggers... ;-)

The last output from running the doctest example (copied to a `.sage` file, activating `pdb` right before `Q.height()`) in gdb is:

I was actually thinking (fearing) it was a Sage/Cython bug, but can meanwhile reproduce the segfault with a GP script; going to sort out if it's PARI's or MPIR's fault.

I'm **not** able to reproduce this problem.  I'm using vanilla MPIR 2.1.1, vanilla PARI svn-12577 and using PARI's --with-gmp feature and setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH to use my newly compiled MPIR.  This is using gcc (GCC) 4.6.0 20100705 (experimental) on a Gentoo Linux x86_64 system.  I run the gp script provided by John and it just works.

Well, I wrote *"**a** GP script"*; John's doesn't resemble what Sage actually does.

Try `ellorder(E,Q)`...

With true [GMP](http://gmplib.org/) 5.0.1 (and ECM 6.3), Sage 4.6.prealpha3 passes all tests for me; I'll try later on further machines. 

I've put a remark on the [NewPARI Wiki page](http://wiki.sagemath.org/NewPARI), and will revert #8664 to "needs work".

My script was intended to make the pari library do exactly what is does in that Sage example, i.e. it calls ellheight with the same point and curve.

Yes, and **that**'s what crashes with MPIR 2.1.1.

Sage's `EllipticCurvePoint_number_field.height()` first calls `self.has_finite_order()`, which in turn calls `self.order()`, which uses PARI's `orderell()` (deprecated, `ellorder()` in the GP interpreter).

The large number of doctests without errors for sage-4.6.prealpha3 seem to indicate that the patches are fine.

I also would very much like somebody to have a look at #9400, because it also touches a lot of PARI code (the patch for #9400 has been included in 4.6.prealpha2 and 4.6.prealpha3).

I actually expected a 4.5.3 release candidate rather than an alpha2, and 4.5.3 released earlier. 4.6.prealpha3 is still based on 4.5.3.alpha1, but as far as I know the only changes in 4.5.3.alpha2 are fixing numerical noise in doctests, and #9722, which I am porting to the new PARI; Mitesh will know better.

> What is to stop that happening now?


Regarding this ticket, the only things I'm aware of are:
* preparing a PARI 2.4.3.svn-12577.p5 spkg, with the fixes from #9722, and in addition disabling the use of GMP internals by PARI by default (with an *option* to make PARI use them)
* fixing Sphinx warnings
* adding more documentation (strings) and doctests to (at least) `sage/libs/pari/gen.pyx` (cf. [this comment](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/9343#comment:250) and the [corresponding attachment](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/attachment/ticket/9343/pari-gen.pyx-coverage.txt)).

I don't know if further (new?) PARI functions should be wrapped; I only came across the deprecated `orderell()`.

IMHO other things (e.g. Lcalc spkg improvements; I've commented on Mike's follow-up #9775) should be addressed during the normal 4.6 release cycle.

I guess an official 4.6.alpha would be tested by far more people, on a broader variety of systems. Same for 4.5.3 (final). If any problems arise with the latter, they should be fixed during the preparation of 4.6 alphas, not in our inofficial prealphas.

Replying to [jdemeyer](#comment%3A356):

Yes. Unfortunately the MPIR 2.1.1 issue took too much of my time and resources; I now consider it (more or less) "resolved", and continue the work on the PARI 2.4.3.svn-12577.p5 spkg.
    
> The large number of doctests without errors for sage-4.6.prealpha3 seem to indicate that the patches are fine.


Hopefully. It might also indicate a lack of (appropriate) doctests... ;-)

(E.g., despite the obvious bug in MPIR 2.1.1, Sage 4.5.3.alpha2 and 4.6.prealpha3 - with PARI *not* using GMP internals - both passed all long tests on two systems with it. There have been similar cases in the past.)

I'll release a 4.5.3.rc0 later today (or possibly, tomorrow) which, if there are no new blockers, will become Sage 4.5.3 a week later.  Soon after that, I'll start merging positively-reviewed (PR) tickets (listed at reports {11} and {32}) into 4.6.alpha0.

If the essential PARI upgrade tickets are

* Not PR at that time, I'll merge other PR tickets into 4.6.alpha0 and leave the PARI tickets for 4.6.alpha1 (or later).

Either way, I don't plan to release Sage 4.6 (== 4.6.0) until it's sufficiently stable.

No idea what else they changed. Without further knowledge, I'd prefer staying with "our already well-tested" 12577, but don't insist on that. I'll leave the decision to the others.

Btw, as Mitesh mentioned, we need a (formal) positive review to get this into Sage 4.6.


> Leif, how is the progress on p5?


Ongoing... ;-)

I currently have some hardware issues I cannot solve until tomorrow, but will post a p5 either later today or latest by tomorrow evening.

I think that would be a bad idea. It's difficult to say for sure without knowing what was changed in all 11 different svn snapshots, but given these are only snapshots with little testing, I think you have a reasonable probability of hitting another bug. 

Not only that, but people have spent a lot of time testing this. Their appetite for testing might diminish. 

Where do you stop?

I think you didn't get Dave's point. He wants the fixes and only the fixes. If we 
take another snapshot we get the fixes and who knows what else.

We just have to be ready to pick up the pieces in 4.6.1.

New prealpha4: [http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/dist/sage-4.6.prealpha4.tar](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/dist/sage-4.6.prealpha4.tar)

Tested successfully on `sage.math.washington.edu`, more testing underway.  Also tuning and spkg-check worked:

```
env SAGE_CHECK=yes SAGE_TUNE_pari=yes ./sage -f pari-2.4.3.svn-12577.p5.spkg
```

As far as I know, there are no remaining issues, so I will be bold and set this back to positive review.

The prealpha4 passed `ptestlong` on Ubuntu 10.04 x86_64 (Core2) and Fedora 13 x86 (Pentium 4 Prescott), too. Installing the package with `SAGE_CHECK=yes` also works.

Tuning now doesn't give an error on the former, but still hangs on the latter (see previous posts).

The patch to `tune.c` from svn 12588 is a one-liner btw.

Having produced a tar file for people to test, it would have been wise to get some more feedback before setting it to positive review. 

I'm going to build it now on OpenSolaris. Nice thing about that is that's it's very quick. Downloading the tarball is less so!

If so, you could try reinstalling the PARI package with `PARI_EXTRA_OPTS="--graphic=auto"` or e.g. `X11`; best once with X11 development files present, and once in addition without (a functional) `xmkmf`. (I don't know what X11 [development] packages OpenSolaris provides.) :-)

Is the 

`PARI_EXTRA_OPTS="--graphic=auto"` 

just an environment variable I should set? If so, that will be trivial. I'm actually building two copies of Sage at the minute on this machine, so its under a heavy load, but I'll try this later

I see your point elsewhere about Qt. I have some Qt libraries on here, which come as part of Mathematica. Not sure if I should set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include them. Let me know.

Yes, that's passed (verbatim) to PARI's `Configure` by Sage, so do

```sh
export PARI_EXTRA_OPTS="--graphic=X11"
```
(`--graphic=auto` will pick X11 if it's found, otherwise try FLTK and Qt.)

That would be nice.

I don't think Mathematica ships with Qt *development* files... (But there should be such OpenSolaris packages. If you choose X11, PARI will just use "plain" X11.)

W.r.t. #9603, my main machine is still headless... :/

It also hangs with `CFLAGS=-O0`, and also if I do

```
.../pari-2.4.3.svn-12577.p5/src$ ./Configure --graphic=none --kernel=gmp --tune
```
(which uses the system's GMP, which is version 4.3.1), regardless of `CFLAGS` settings. (gcc is version 4.4.4.)

It doesn't always hang at *exactly* the same point (of output), but this might simply be due to unflushed buffers; the point where it "stops" only differs by some lines (different size / threshold for the same function, when attempting to tune `REMIIMUL_LIMIT` if I understand correctly).

```
^C  ***   user interrupt.

```
but continues compilation (which of course fails).

On a Pentium 4 (Northwood), PARI self-tuning works, and `make test-all` apparently passes all tests except those few that require extra data files, though the self-test also ends with

```
+++ [BUG] Total bench for gp-sta is 585030

I'm not sure what that's intended to mean.

This is with gcc 4.2.1 and GMP 4.3.2 though.

Oh, it *might* be the (CPU) time in ms the test(s) took (sum about 20 minutes), but the *"[BUG]"* next to it is quite irritating.

Btw, tuning also works on the Pentium 4 **Prescott** with GMP **4.2.4** and gcc **4.3.3**, so perhaps there's a bug in GMP; a bug in gcc (4.4.4) is IMHO rather unlikely.

It also hangs with GMP 5.0.1 ("plain" PARI, gcc 4.4.4 as before, in tuning `REMIIMUL_LIMIT`).
 
> It doesn't always hang at *exactly* the same point (of output), but this might simply be due to unflushed buffers; the point where it "stops" only differs by some lines (different size / threshold for the same function, when attempting to tune `REMIIMUL_LIMIT` if I understand correctly).

prealpha4 worked fine for me on 32-bit and 64-bit linux.

Now that 4.5.3 has been released it would be great of we could get this as the beginning of an actual 4.6.0 series.

It should, since `test -e ...` is POSIX (2004).

Dave, what shell is `/bin/sh` there?

`/bin/sh` is a borne shell, but it is **not** POSIX compatible, since to make it POSIX compatible would break backwards compatibility in Solaris. 

There are however other shells, such as `/usr/xpg4/bin/sh` which are POSIX compatible. Hence there is a need to work around the Solaris shell `/bin/sh`, and do not assume that it is POSIX compatible, since it is not.
