Worked for me and behaves consistently with similar functions such as zero_matrix().  The sparse matrix option is not too useful here (since the matrix gets filled with ones), but I guess it's best to be consistent with similar functions, which the patch is.

When applying this to sage-4.6.1.alpha0, I get

```
patching file sage/matrix/constructor.py
Hunk #1 succeeded at 1348 with fuzz 2 (offset 363 lines).
```
So the patch succeeds, but it's probably better if it gets rebased properly.
