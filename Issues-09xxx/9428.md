I have moved the translation of the description strings and group strings to the html generation function so as to be able to dynamically change the language.

The new package (at the same url) removes conf_lcma.py.

Hi,

There is a new package version at the same url: http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/timdumol/sagenb-0.8.2-dev-i18n.spkg

The error regarding the missing locale directory was a bug. The new patch fixes this, and addresses your issue regarding "XX <time units> ago".

The new translations are found in `sagenb.po`.

Hi, thank you for the patch

1. Installs fine, works as expected

2. sage -t -sagenb passed

3. I was not able to configure selenium tests, got errors like "unable to start browser". Do I need to run these tests to give a positive review to this ticket?

4. It seems that the issue "XX <time units> ago" has not been resolved. The workseet.py still contains

```
    def _saved_by_info(self, x, username=None):
        try:
            u = self.__saved_by_info[x]
            return ' '+_('ago by %s', username)%u
        except (KeyError,AttributeError):
            return ' '+_('ago', username)
```
and I do not have possibility to put internationalized text on the front of the number, like 
"pred 10 sekundami". But no matter, can be resolved later on a ticket which adds Czech translation which is also finished.

{
    "body": "<a id='comment:11'></a>\nI observed that if I click in worksheet to Undo button, the Last Edited field does not contain the name of the author, but the word \"ago\". Switching languages does not change the string in the field Last Edited. The string is always in the notebook default language.\n\nDo you have the same behavior? Do you know how to fix this? I think that there should be no strings for translation in the function _saved_by_info, since the whole phrase is translated in the function snapshot_data. Is this right?\n\nIf you prepare new version, could you add the directory cs_CZ and the file from \nhttp://user.mendelu.cz/marik/sage/sagenb.po ?\n\nI tested extensivelly the last version of the sagenb package and everything works fine, with one exception in Last Edited field described above.\n\nIt seems that the welcome page and registration process must be in the default language of the notebook right now. Could this be improved in some later versions?\n\nStill trying to make selenium tests work in order to finish review of this ticket... \n\nMany thanks for working on i18n!",

I observed that if I click in worksheet to Undo button, the Last Edited field does not contain the name of the author, but the word "ago". Switching languages does not change the string in the field Last Edited. The string is always in the notebook default language.

Do you have the same behavior? Do you know how to fix this? I think that there should be no strings for translation in the function _saved_by_info, since the whole phrase is translated in the function snapshot_data. Is this right?

If you prepare new version, could you add the directory cs_CZ and the file from 
http://user.mendelu.cz/marik/sage/sagenb.po ?

I tested extensivelly the last version of the sagenb package and everything works fine, with one exception in Last Edited field described above.

It seems that the welcome page and registration process must be in the default language of the notebook right now. Could this be improved in some later versions?

Still trying to make selenium tests work in order to finish review of this ticket... 

Many thanks for working on i18n!

Looks fine for me, instals fine, works fine, no problems found when using it for a longer time and for many various things.

Very very important patch, thank you.

I observed the follow issues:

- When we create a new user the language for them is the default one (as
we expected). But when we go to the page "Settings > Account Setting" of
this user we see "en_US" as the user language and not the default one,
beside the pages are actually in the default one.

- The language for the JavaScript code is in the default one and not in
the user one. For example, if the default language is "en_US" and the
user language is "pt_BR", then when we click on the link "Esvaziar
Lixeira" (Empty Trash) at the page "Lixeira" (Trash) the message appears
in English and not in Portuguese.

- When we change the default language the language for the JavaScript
code is still the old one. We need to restart the Notebook to update the
language for the JavaScript code. By the way, I think that the language
for the JavaScript should be the same as the user.

- When we set a "simple" challenge for account registration the question
in the registration process is in the default language as we expected,
but we have to give the answer in English. For example, if the default
language is "pt_BR" and we answer the question "Quanto é 2 mais
3?" (What is 2 plus 3?) with "cinco" (five) we get an error. But, if we
answer that question with "five", we don't get an error. So, the
question is in Portuguese but we have to give the answer in English.

- The messages in the "Last Edited" column at the pages "Home" and
"Published" are wrong. Each message is in two languages: the first half
is in the default language and the second half is in the user language.

I updated the pt_br locale files. I made some corrections and I translated the new strings. Please, add this to the next sagenb package:

Thank you for solve those issues!

But, it seems we have another new ones:

- When we click on the link "New Worksheet" at the "Home" page, the
new worksheet is created with a title in the default language and not in the user one. So, if the default language is "en_US" and the user one is "pt_BR", then when we click on "Nova Planilha" (New Worksheet) the worksheet will have the title "Untitled" and not "Sem título".

- When we plot a surface (using the function plot3d), the text "Get Image" (at the side of the plot window) and "To save this image (...)" (that appears when we click on "Get Image") are in English no matter what is the user language or default language.

Even for a "skilled person", I think is more comfortable to use a software in your native language.

And you're assuming that a "skilled person" is someone that knows English, but it isn't necessarily true.

You're making a great job, Tim Dumol! All the last issues are solved.

But, unfortunately I realize more three (minor) issues:

- The text "evaluate" below the first cell in a worksheet is in the default language and not in the user one.

- We have two more strings to translate:

* data/sage/html/notebook/base.html, line 71: "Click to rename this worksheet"

* data/sage/html/notebook/base.html, line 112 -> "Select an attached file"

We are not using the function gettext() in these strings.

- It's not a big deal, but the date below the title of a worksheet (at the worksheet page) is in English.

I updated the pt_BR localization files. Please add this to the next package:

http://sites.google.com/site/lcmaquino/sage/sagenb_pt_BR.tar.gz?attredirects=0&d=1

Robert Marik, could you update the cs_CZ localization files to translate the new strings?

I think that after solve these issues we are ready to ask for another localization files! I hope that sage will be available in a lot of languages very soon!

Here is an updated .pot file:

https://sites.google.com/site/lcmaquino/sage/sagenb.pot?attredirects=0&d=1

I can generate it running pybabel on Ubuntu 10.04 without problem.

But, we have to take care about the .js files. In the new version of the package we are translating the .js files using the dictionary "translations" (defined in "data/sage/js/localization.js"), so we can't extract these strings using pybabel because it looks for "gettext()", "ngetttext()" and "_()" functions. Maybe we can implement a dummy "_()" function, as we did before.

Hi Tim,

It seems you updated the package. I tried to install it and I got some errors. To solve them, I changed the files:

#sagenb/notebook/template.py, line 142

From: 

```
env.filters['_'] = lambda x: return x
```
To:

```
env.filters['_'] = lambda x: x
``` 

#sagenb/data/sage/js/localization.js, line 5

There is a open comment tag "{#", but there isn't a close comment tag "#}". So, I typed "#}" in the line 7.

I notice that you forgot to put the strings "Problem inserting new input cell before current input cell." and "Problem inserting new text cell before current input cell." in the files localization.js and translated-messages.js.

After install, I notice that the date below the title of a worksheet (at the worksheet page) appears as "None". To solve it, I changed the file:

#sagenb/notebook/worksheet.js

line 4166: I commented this line.

line 4168 (solve an 'exceptions.UnicodeEncodeError' in Czech and the text "None" below the title of a worksheet):

From:

```
time.strftime(month+' %d, %Y %I:%M %p', time.localtime(float(t)))
```
To:

```
return month + time.strftime(' %d, %Y %I:%M %p', time.localtime(float(t)))
```

After all, it seems that the issues pointed in above comment 26 are solved! :)

I updated the pt_BR localization files (translating the name of months) and the .pot file. Please add this to the next package:

http://sites.google.com/site/lcmaquino/sage/sagenb_pt_BR.tar.gz?attredirects=0&d=1

https://sites.google.com/site/lcmaquino/sage/sagenb.pot?attredirects=0&d=1

By the way, please remove the file "sagenb/notebook/conf_lcma.py" (as you did before).

I think we're ready to ask for another localization files! What do you think?

It installed ok. But, you didn't comment (or remove) the line 4166 in "sagenb/notebook/worksheet.js". Without this change, I got an error when I tried to save a new worksheet. The last messages about this error were:

```

By the way, you forgot to put the strings in the files "localization.js" and "translated-messages.js" as pointed above.

When we finish the work with this package, how do you think to instruct another user to add new localization files? Do you think to ask them to send to you the localization files and then you add it to the package?

We should implement the solutions pointed in comments 28 and 30 and update the package. But, where you read "sagenb/notebook/worksheet.js", please understand "sagenb/notebook/worksheet.py".
