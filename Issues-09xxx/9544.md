This looks good, but since it's applied universally and not just on FreeBSD I am hesitant to give it positive review.  Jeroen, did you try this out on some of the buildbots?

Also, is there even an "upstream"?  This is a five-year-old program, and some searching indicates that maybe a newer version is included in flint itself?  Anyway, I figure that the age makes reporting upstream inappropriate.

I don't know, that's why I asked!  Extra imports in Python sometimes cause all kinds of circularity issues or slowdowns, and I don't know enough about C to say either way.

But since you just repackaged this, I think it's appropriate for you to be a reviewer as well.  And I checked that the package is well-formed and installs on OS X.

I also notice that you included stdint after stdlib, while Stephen does the opposite in his patch [here](http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/ports/math/sage/files/spkg-patch-flintqs-20070817.p6_-_patches_TonelliShanks.h.patch?rev=1.1;content-type=text%2Fplain).  I assume this also doesn't matter?  Sorry for the very stupid questions.

It also shouldn't matter. The way I did it looked more natural, but there's really no reason.

Ok. 

I'm even having trouble finding where this is used.  `sage -grep` with various upper/lowercase of flintqs does nothing, it's not in `module_list.py`, in `spkg/standard/deps` it only has dependencies...  and I'm going to need CPU firepower in a few minutes, can't do a full doctest right now.  Weird.

Great, thanks.  That passes long tests, so since there really isn't any reason anything should be bad, we are good to go.  (Yes, I did `sage -b`.)

Since p7 is also 5.1, tentatively putting it there, but feel free to do whatever is convenient.
