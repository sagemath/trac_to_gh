Sage currently cannot compute L-functions of elliptic curves over function fields. Chris Hall and I have developed Cython code so that Sage can make use of our ELLFF (elliptic curve L-functions over function fields) library (written in C++ with NTL). The next step is to patch this into Sage.

Keywords: **elliptic curves, L-functions, function fields**
