We currently have separate single and multi-threaded Sage doctest scripts.  In particular, `sage -t ...` invokes `SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/sage-test` and `sage -tp ...` invokes `sage-ptest`.  These files share many lines of almost functionally identical identical code.  Unifying these scripts should make it easier to maintain and extend the Sage doctest system.

<a id='comment:1'></a>It seems the merger is overdue, although I doubt I can work on it in the immediate future, e.g., before #8641 closes.

What if we start with mapping `sage -t ...` to `sage -tp 1 ...`?

This sounds great to me. It immediately removes the code duplication and is very easy to implement. Perhaps it's worth asking on sage-devel about this, in case anyone knows of a substantive difference between "-t" and "-tp 1", but I think this is a good idea.

  if ol!="" and (not ol.isspace()):
        if (ol[len(ol)-1]=="\n"):

Why is that not

```
  if ol and not ol.isspace():
    print ol.rstrip()
```
? There is some strange stuff in sage-ptest.

Sqlalchemy (a standard package in Sage) has a set of self-tests which rely on 'nose'. I did ask on sage-devel a few weeks back if that should be included in Sage, but what response I did get was negative. 

I'm keen we have more testing of the individual components of Sage. At the minute, few have spkg-check files, and as I say, at least sqlalchemy will not work without nose. 

#9281 has a list of all the standard packages and whether they have an spkg-check file. The number is depressing small - about 20% of them.

At least for the *temporary* files, I think the name of the subdirectory should also contain the hostname and the PID of the parent process (just like `sage-ptest` now manages this, cf. #9739), to support e.g. running `make testlong` simultaneously from different machines sharing the same filesystem, i.e., sharing the `DOT_SAGE` directory or whatever `SAGE_TESTDIR` might be, and also running different instances of e.g. `make testlong` or `sage -t ...` *on the same machine* at the same time.

(At least Dave requested this feature, cf. [comment:ticket:9739:19 his comment here] and [comment:ticket:9739:21 here], and [comment:ticket:9739:83 my suggestion].)

Timings should perhaps have their own, persistent directory. Either we accept the possibility of race conditions there, or we should add e.g. the hostname and the time (the former reasonable anyway), eventually also the PID, to the filenames.

Yep, that's odd. We have a whole bunch of `tmp` / `temp` subdirectories all around.

Right, my intention was, by default anyway, to create such a temporary directory inside SAGE_TESTDIR.  Or we can have separate environment variables for the (parent of the) testing directory and the directory containing timing files, etc.
