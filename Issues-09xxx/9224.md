We currently have separate single and multi-threaded Sage doctest scripts.  In particular, `sage -t ...` invokes `SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/sage-test` and `sage -tp ...` invokes `sage-ptest`.  These files share many lines of almost functionally identical identical code.  Unifying these scripts should make it easier to maintain and extend the Sage doctest system.

It seems the merger is overdue, although I doubt I can work on it in the immediate future, e.g., before #8641 closes.

What if we start with mapping `sage -t ...` to `sage -tp 1 ...`?

This sounds great to me. It immediately removes the code duplication and is very easy to implement. Perhaps it's worth asking on sage-devel about this, in case anyone knows of a substantive difference between "-t" and "-tp 1", but I think this is a good idea.

I'm looking at this, and it might be a bit trickier than I thought. Doing "sage -tp 1 ..." tests to see if Sage starts, which we don't want. That's easy to fix, though. What might be harder is that sage-ptest has some awful code in it. The test_file function, according to comments, is supposed to return a 4-tuple, but sometimes it returns a 3-tuple (line 122); there's a bare "except", which is probably not a good idea; the function that processes the tuples just mentioned does this:

```
  F = result[0]
  ret = result[1]
  finished_time = result[2]
  ol = result[3]
```
The "result" usually is a 4-tuple: (filename, return_code, time, some_string). But sometimes it returns a 3-tuple: (-5, 0, some_string). So the code above sometimes gets a filename for F, and sometimes gets the integer -5. Then there's this:

```
  if ol!="" and (not ol.isspace()):
        if (ol[len(ol)-1]=="\n"):
            ol=ol[0:len(ol)-1]
        print ol
```
Why is that not

```
  if ol and not ol.isspace():
    print ol.rstrip()
```
? There is some strange stuff in sage-ptest.

I do like the idea of merging sage-test and sage-ptest.

Your Doctester API seems reasonable at first glance; there might have to be minor changes when it's actually implemented, but it's surely basically sound.  (I mean that it has to be possible to split sage-(p)test into pieces, one of which implements your Doctester API, and one which calls it.)

Merging sage-doctest into the same code seems trickier, especially if you mean it to also run in the same process.

I'm afraid I'm not giving very good feedback... "sounds like a good idea, but it might be hard" :)  The problem is that at the moment I don't understand sage-test, sage-ptest, and sage-doctest well enough to give more detailed comments.

Sqlalchemy (a standard package in Sage) has a set of self-tests which rely on 'nose'. I did ask on sage-devel a few weeks back if that should be included in Sage, but what response I did get was negative. 

I'm keen we have more testing of the individual components of Sage. At the minute, few have spkg-check files, and as I say, at least sqlalchemy will not work without nose. 

#9281 has a list of all the standard packages and whether they have an spkg-check file. The number is depressing small - about 20% of them.

Some random comments:

1. If we keep `SAGE_TESTDIR` as a subdirectory of `DOT_SAGE`, we should call it `DOT_SAGE/testing/` instead of `DOT_SAGE/tmp/`.  This describes the directory better, and the directory can contain timing files, for example, which are intended to persist, not be temporary.

2. Note that the script `sage-test` creates `SAGE_TESTDIR` as `DOT_SAGE/tmp`, and then creates a further subdirectory `tmp` of this.  I don't think there is any reason for this subdirectory to exist.

3. Note also `sage-maketest` which writes files to `SAGE_TESTDIR`.  (It also has a different default setting for this variable.)  This script may not require any modification, but it's another one to keep an eye on.

Timings should perhaps have their own, persistent directory. Either we accept the possibility of race conditions there, or we should add e.g. the hostname and the time (the former reasonable anyway), eventually also the PID, to the filenames.

Yep, that's odd. We have a whole bunch of `tmp` / `temp` subdirectories all around.

Right, my intention was, by default anyway, to create such a temporary directory inside SAGE_TESTDIR.  Or we can have separate environment variables for the (parent of the) testing directory and the directory containing timing files, etc.
