Hi,

The patch is no longer needed and should be removed. The test in the src/Bio/Wise/__init__.py has been improved to test if the test is being run from a tty. The tests now passes when run using export SAGE_CHECK="yes".

I just ran the tests and got the old failures from the Wise module, so this doesn't seem to be fixed after all unless I'm missing something.

Unfortunately, I haven't been able to duplicate that. I get:

```
test_Wise ... skipping. Install Wise2 (dnal) if you want to use Bio.Wise.
test_psw ... skipping. Install Wise2 (dnal) if you want to use Bio.Wise.
```
but I think this is expected as I don't have Wise2 installed. I also get:

```
Bio.Wise docstring test ... ok
Bio.Wise.psw docstring test ... ok
```
What I did was to run the commands:

```
export SAGE_CHECK="yes"
sage -f biopython-1.55.p0.spkg
```
I noticed that that previous installed version was not overwritten. I then removed the directory and did the install again. This time the new file was present. The tests again passed. 

How did you run the tests?

I have had this sort of problem with python distutils before. Old versions are not written over even though the files have changed. My guess is that the root of the problem is that the old version is not removed first. It is very easy to end up with an install that is a mixture of versions this way.
