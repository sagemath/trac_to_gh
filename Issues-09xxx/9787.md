I would propose something like:

```
seqpoints = Sequence([self.base().an_element()]+list(points))
points = [seqpoints.universe()(p) for p in points]
```

That way we make sure that all the operations happen in the right parent (be it the base ring of the parent, or some other parent where both the input and the parent fit)

Do you mean that `R.lagrange_polynomial()` should potentially return an element of a different ring than `R`?  That would be unnecessarily confusing in my opinion.

Well, you could have that even now:

```
sage: R.<x>=QQ[]
sage: R.lagrange_polynomial(((1,1.75),(2,0.2),(3,1.5)))
1.42500000000000*x^2 - 5.82500000000000*x + 6.15000000000000
```

You can either catch that and raise an exception (which is probably the mathematically strictly correct), or be more flexible and allow situations like the previous (which, i think, can be useful in several cases).

In this case, i would vote for the second option, but i understand it is a matter of opinion.

Actually, with this branch, you get

```
sage: R.<x>=QQ[]
sage: R.lagrange_polynomial(((1,1.75),(2,0.2),(3,1.5)))
57/40*x^2 - 233/40*x + 123/20
```
This is not ideal from my point of view (I would prefer to use `coerce` to put the coefficients into the base field of `R`, so this example would raise an error), but a doctest in a published book unfortunately depends on it.
> You can either catch that and raise an exception (which is probably the mathematically strictly correct), or be more flexible and allow situations like the previous (which, i think, can be useful in several cases).

I see that this could be the expected behaviour given the general permissiveness in Sage with respect to extending parents, but I would still find it strange if `R.lagrange_polynomial()` did not return a value in `R` but in a different ring depending on the input.  It would mean that `lagrange_polynomial()` basically had no relation to `R`.

Hello,

On sage-6.5 at least, I got the right answer.

```
sage: R.<x>=GF(101)[]
sage: R.lagrange_polynomial([[1,0],[2,0]])
0
```
It would be cool to add it to the documentation since it was the initial purpose of the ticket.

Thanks for pointing the example! Once again the symbolic ring is wrong

```
sage: f(x) = 4 * sin(x) - exp(x) / 2 + 1
sage: f(1.2)
3.06809788250063
sage: parent(_)
Symbolic Ring
```
Parent should be `RR` as it is already the case for

```
sage: parent(exp(1.2))
Real Field with 53 bits of precision
sage: parent(sin(1.2))
Real Field with 53 bits of precision
```
But

```
sage: f(x) = x
sage: parent(f(1.2))
<type 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression'>
```

Indeed; compare

```
sage: f(x) = exp(x)
sage: parent(f(1.2))
Symbolic Ring
sage: parent(exp(1.2))

Should we set a dependency and use `.coerce`? If you feel that it is too much, this ticket is good to go as it is.

If I understand #18092 correctly, it will only make `f.evaluate(x=1.2)` return an element of `RR`, while `f(1.2)` will remain a symbolic expression.  Hence I think #18092 would not automatically (transparently) solve this issue.

I interpret this as a positive review, correct me if I'm wrong.

I thought that `.evaluate` would be a modification of `.subs`!! With functions, this behavior would be **wrong**. It should be what it has to be

```
sage: f(x) = 2*x
sage: f.subs(x=3)
x |--> 6
```
In other words `f.evaluate(x=3)` should be a constant function!

Perfect!
