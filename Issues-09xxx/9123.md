Schur algebras are used in the description of the representation theory of GL_n.  I plan to implement them, and use them to calculate the characters of the irreducible modules of GL_n (in characteristic p).  

A nice reference is Green's book "Polynomial representations of GL_n".

I made a bunch of major revisions:

- I changed the indexing set for `SchurAlgebra` be tuples rather than words since it was not using any properties of words and was incurring for it.
- I changed `TensorSpace` to `SchurTensorModule` (although I'm quite open to better names).
- `SchurTensorModule` inherits from `CombinatorialFreeModule_Tensor`. This makes it behave like a tensor product with respect to things like `tensor()`.
- I implemented the actions of the symmetric group (well...permutations), the symmetric group algebra, and the Schur algebra as actual actions using `_acted_upon_`. I also cached the Schur action morphism and implemented the permutation actions directly.
- Renamed `GL_n_irred_character` to `GL_irreducible_character`.
- Added documentation and doctests for full coverage.

The net result of my changes is over a 30x speedup to `GL_irreducible_character`, which allowed me to remove the `# long time` from those tests. If someone (Hugh, Frederic, ?) could review my changes, then I think we can set a positive review.

I have made a review patch.

There is still something missing : the doc for SchurTensorModule is almost void. Nowhere
one can see anything about the commuting actions. I think one should at least illustrate
both actions.
