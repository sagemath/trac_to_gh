See my talk:
*  http://wiki.sagemath.org/days24/schedule?action=AttachFile&do=view&target=stein-cython.pdf
* http://sagenb.org/home/pub/2256/

Basically, this sucks:

```
sage: n = 20110000038209
sage: timeit('trial_division(n)')
125 loops, best of 3: 2.75 ms per loop
```

Even in pure python one can easily implement this so it runs in about 650microseconds.  In C, it takes only 6 microseconds!
