The relevant file is `SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/sage-sage`.

Huh, this was fixed at some point in the recent past.   At any rate, it is in the released 4.7.1.

```
  -maxima [...]       -- run Sage's Maxima with given arguments
  -mwrank [...]       -- run Sage's mwrank with given arguments
  -python [...]       -- run the Python interpreter
  -R [...]            -- run Sage's R with given arguments
  -scons [...]        -- run Sage's scons
```
In fact, it even shows up in `./sage -help`.
