<div id="comment:0"></div>

It was discovered in #8059 , that the parallel build of the Singular 3-1-1-4 packages still breaks in rare cases (many CPU cores, slow hard disk).

There are two patches which should fix this issue upstream:
http://www.singular.uni-kl.de:8002/trac/ticket/250, see

```
svn diff -r 13112:13110 http://www.singular.uni-kl.de/svn/
```

## Release manager
Merge just this package:

I will add a small patch to this ticket. While I worked on the Gentoo ebuild
I discovered that parallel make is disabled itself (jobserver not available using -j1) on libsingular and the test because make is called directly as "make" and not $(MAKE) or ${MAKE}.

So while it looks all fine and dandy you are actually not building libsingular in parallel, feel free to forward upstream as I don't have an account with them.

Then I missed something because I just checked spkg-install from the latest available spkg in #8059 and it does build libsingular by calling the top makefile:

```
build_libsingular()
{
    cd $SRC
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
        echo "Unable to change to directory $SRC"
        exit 1
    fi

    make libsingular
```

Installs ok with `MAKE="make -j16"` on an already loaded system (Sage 4.5.3, Ubuntu 10.04, Core2). I haven't had any problems previously with parallel builds though, and I don't have slow harddisks... ;-)

Unrelated:
* Any reason to look for `bison` (despite `--without-bison` btw.), but then hardcoding `bison` instead of using `@BISON@`?

Could you fix this:

```sh

```
?

The names shouldn't, they're standard. *How* a package uses them might differ, i.e. *some* flags might intentionally get overridden, but they should never be ignored. Also, some packages won't e.g. use `LDFLAGS` because they use `libtool` or use the C compiler driver for linking.

? If this refers to (the use of) `CPPFLAGS`, these are the flags for the C preprocessor, `cpp`. The preprocessor is rarely used directly, but in the other case one should either pass them directly to the compiler driver as well, or e.g. prepend them to `CFLAGS` and `CXXFLAGS`.

I haven't noticed that (but haven't inspected that either).

In that case, `CXXFLAGS` should have been used (when compiling C code with e.g. `g++`), but that's not the case. I can give more details on which files were compiled only using `CPPFLAGS` later. (To see which flags are actually used, simply `export CFLAGS=-DHONORS_CFLAGS` etc.)

Now I understand: there are *compiled* targets in Singular, for instance the .og files, which do obey `CPPFLAGS`, but neither `CFLAGS` not `CXXFLAGS`.
I think, these files are intentionally compiled with other options than "ordinary" targets. For the .og files there is a `CXXFLAGSG` in the `Makefile.in`, but it is not managed by the `./configure` script.

Is there a best practice for such special targets?

For the purpose of Sage (I think) we should anyway compile with `-g` (and not build the "special" targets).

`CXXFLAGSG` should perhaps simply be `"$CXXFLAGS -g"` (or `-g` replaced by the appropriate option, depending on the compiler used), if `CXXFLAGS` do not already contain that. Otherwise one could drop the ".og" targets, or just build those; a matter of taste.

If nothing else than adding debug symbols differentiates the normal targets from their ".og" versions, one should simply build **once** *with* debug symbols, copy the generated files, and create "non-.og" versions by stripping the made copies, then installing both (if requested).

I haven't yet looked at the sources (`configure`, `Makefile.in` etc.) though.

Or perhaps just the list of files isn't complete.

Though ignored, should probably be fixed upstream, too.

<div id="comment:54" align="right">comment:54</div>

I've now built this 110 times, on the following hardware: 

* Sun Ultra 27
* 3.33 GHz Intel Xeon processor
* 12 GB RAM
* OpenSolaris 06/2009. 
* Local hard drives using 128-bit ZFS file system. 

The method used was: 

* Use 4 previous builds of Sage (different, but fairly recent versions)
* Copied the `singular-3-1-1-4.p2.spkg` package to `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/standard`
* Created a script to run ` sage -f singular-3-1-1-4.p2.spkg`
* set MAKE="make -j2" in one directory
* set MAKE="make -j12" in two different directories. 
* set MAKE="make -j30" in another directory. 

I did *'not*
* Test the package with `SAGE_CHECK=yes`
* Run any doctests. 

So at any one time, 4 builds of singular would take place, each in parallel, with either 2, 12 or 30 threads. The load average of the machine changed from around 9 to 11, but averaged about 10.  Each build took just over 6 minutes, but since 4 builds were taking place in parallel, this was an average build time of about 1.5 minutes/build. 

So there does not appear to be any parallel build issues. 

So positive review.
