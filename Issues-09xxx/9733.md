I will add a small patch to this ticket. While I worked on the Gentoo ebuild
I discovered that parallel make is disabled itself (jobserver not available using -j1) on libsingular and the test because make is called directly as "make" and not $(MAKE) or ${MAKE}.

So while it looks all fine and dandy you are actually not building libsingular in parallel, feel free to forward upstream as I don't have an account with them.

Then I missed something because I just checked spkg-install from the latest available spkg in #8059 and it does build libsingular by calling the top makefile:

```
build_libsingular()
{
    cd $SRC
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
        echo "Unable to change to directory $SRC"
        exit 1
    fi

    make libsingular
```

Installs ok with `MAKE="make -j16"` on an already loaded system (Sage 4.5.3, Ubuntu 10.04, Core2). I haven't had any problems previously with parallel builds though, and I don't have slow harddisks... ;-)

From the Makefiles there's no restriction, so the dependencies of each of which can be build in parallel. But there may be dependencies, that that there is no parallel build in fact.

As fbissey said, this should not cause problems here.

I repeated the three 50-run tests above.  The new package fixes the ranlib problem for me.

Could you fix this:

```sh
$ hg stat
? patches/kernel-Makefile.in.orig
? spkg-install~
```
?

If this refers to (the use of) `CPPFLAGS`, these are the flags for the C preprocessor, `cpp`.

Replying to [AlexanderDreyer](#comment%3A31):
> Sure, I can report this to Singular's trac.


Thanks, that would be nice.

> [...] For the flags, I need some additional information; The meaning (and names) of flags highly depend on the build system of a given software.


The names shouldn't, they're standard. *How* a package uses them might differ, i.e. *some* flags might intentionally get overridden, but they should never be ignored. Also, some packages won't e.g. use `LDFLAGS` because they use `libtool` or use the C compiler driver for linking.
 
> So, each spkg-maintainer does need this knowledge for the system he/she maintains anyway.


I agree an spkg maintainer should know the upstream's build process... ;-)

> But `CFLAGS` and `CXXFLAGS` would be more standard-conforming, right?


? If this refers to (the use of) `CPPFLAGS`, these are the flags for the C preprocessor, `cpp`. The preprocessor is rarely used directly, but in the other case one should either pass them directly to the compiler driver as well, or e.g. prepend them to `CFLAGS` and `CXXFLAGS`.

> BTW Singular compiles a lot of C-like code using the C++ compiler. This may result in the observation, that the `CFLAGS` were ignored.


I haven't noticed that (but haven't inspected that either).

In that case, `CXXFLAGS` should have been used (when compiling C code with e.g. `g++`), but that's not the case. I can give more details on which files were compiled only using `CPPFLAGS` later. (To see which flags are actually used, simply `export CFLAGS=-DHONORS_CFLAGS` etc.)

Now I understand: there are *compiled* targets in Singular, for instance the .og files, which do obey `CPPFLAGS`, but neither `CFLAGS` not `CXXFLAGS`.
I think, these files are intentionally compiled with other options than "ordinary" targets. For the .og files there is a `CXXFLAGSG` in the `Makefile.in`, but it is not managed by the `./configure` script.

Is there a best practice for such special targets?

For the purpose of Sage (I think) we should anyway compile with `-g` (and not build the "special" targets).

`CXXFLAGSG` should perhaps simply be `"$CXXFLAGS -g"` (or `-g` replaced by the appropriate option, depending on the compiler used), if `CXXFLAGS` do not already contain that. Otherwise one could drop the ".og" targets, or just build those; a matter of taste.

If nothing else than adding debug symbols differentiates the normal targets from their ".og" versions, one should simply build **once** *with* debug symbols, copy the generated files, and create "non-.og" versions by stripping the made copies, then installing both (if requested).

I haven't yet looked at the sources (`configure`, `Makefile.in` etc.) though.

This is looking good. Built this package 50 times so far without failure.

I've now built this 110 times, on the following hardware: 

* Sun Ultra 27
* 3.33 GHz Intel Xeon processor
* 12 GB RAM
* OpenSolaris 06/2009. 
* Local hard drives using 128-bit ZFS file system. 

The method used was: 

* Use 4 previous builds of Sage (different, but fairly recent versions)
* Copied the `singular-3-1-1-4.p2.spkg` package to `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/standard`
* Created a script to run ` sage -f singular-3-1-1-4.p2.spkg`
* set MAKE="make -j2" in one directory
* set MAKE="make -j12" in two different directories. 
* set MAKE="make -j30" in another directory. 

I did *'not*
* Test the package with `SAGE_CHECK=yes`
* Run any doctests. 

So at any one time, 4 builds of singular would take place, each in parallel, with either 2, 12 or 30 threads. The load average of the machine changed from around 9 to 11, but averaged about 10.  Each build took just over 6 minutes, but since 4 builds were taking place in parallel, this was an average build time of about 1.5 minutes/build. 

So there does not appear to be any parallel build issues. 

So positive review.

Would you believe it. I committed the latest patch to the sage-on-gentoo tree 3 hours ago and 1 hour ago about one of our users reported a new parallel make failure at -j2 on x86.... in libfac this time.
