It was discovered in #8059 , that the parallel build of the Singular 3-1-1-4 packages still breaks in rare cases (many CPU cores, slow hard disk).

There are two patches which should fix this issue upstream:

I will add a small patch to this ticket. While I worked on the Gentoo ebuild
I discovered that parallel make is disabled itself (jobserver not available using -j1) on libsingular and the test because make is called directly as "make" and not $(MAKE) or ${MAKE}.

So while it looks all fine and dandy you are actually not building libsingular in parallel, feel free to forward upstream as I don't have an account with them.

But that's actually not a problem for the spkg, because the `spkg-install` does not call these target from the top-level `Makefile`.

Then I missed something because I just checked spkg-install from the latest available spkg in #8059 and it does build libsingular by calling the top makefile:

```
build_libsingular()
{
    cd $SRC
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
        echo "Unable to change to directory $SRC"
        exit 1
    fi

    make libsingular
```

Installs ok with `MAKE="make -j16"` on an already loaded system (Sage 4.5.3, Ubuntu 10.04, Core2). I haven't had any problems previously with parallel builds though, and I don't have slow harddisks... ;-)

Unrelated:
* Any reason to look for `bison` (despite `--without-bison` btw.), but then hardcoding `bison` instead of using `@BISON@`?
* `CFLAGS` and `CXXFLAGS` are *partly* ignored. (Instead [only] `CPPFLAGS` are used for compiling C and C++ code.)

From the Makefiles there's no restriction, so the dependencies of each of which can be build in parallel. But there may be dependencies, that that there is no parallel build in fact.

As fbissey said, this should not cause problems here.

Could you fix this:

```sh

?

The names shouldn't, they're standard. *How* a package uses them might differ, i.e. *some* flags might intentionally get overridden, but they should never be ignored. Also, some packages won't e.g. use `LDFLAGS` because they use `libtool` or use the C compiler driver for linking.

? If this refers to (the use of) `CPPFLAGS`, these are the flags for the C preprocessor, `cpp`. The preprocessor is rarely used directly, but in the other case one should either pass them directly to the compiler driver as well, or e.g. prepend them to `CFLAGS` and `CXXFLAGS`.

I haven't noticed that (but haven't inspected that either).

In that case, `CXXFLAGS` should have been used (when compiling C code with e.g. `g++`), but that's not the case. I can give more details on which files were compiled only using `CPPFLAGS` later. (To see which flags are actually used, simply `export CFLAGS=-DHONORS_CFLAGS` etc.)

Now I understand: there are *compiled* targets in Singular, for instance the .og files, which do obey `CPPFLAGS`, but neither `CFLAGS` not `CXXFLAGS`.
I think, these files are intentionally compiled with other options than "ordinary" targets. For the .og files there is a `CXXFLAGSG` in the `Makefile.in`, but it is not managed by the `./configure` script.

Is there a best practice for such special targets?

For the purpose of Sage (I think) we should anyway compile with `-g` (and not build the "special" targets).

`CXXFLAGSG` should perhaps simply be `"$CXXFLAGS -g"` (or `-g` replaced by the appropriate option, depending on the compiler used), if `CXXFLAGS` do not already contain that. Otherwise one could drop the ".og" targets, or just build those; a matter of taste.

If nothing else than adding debug symbols differentiates the normal targets from their ".og" versions, one should simply build **once** *with* debug symbols, copy the generated files, and create "non-.og" versions by stripping the made copies, then installing both (if requested).

I haven't yet looked at the sources (`configure`, `Makefile.in` etc.) though.

I was in the process of answering. It has to be applied after SingularSvn13111-13112.patch because it touches a neighboring area of code.

Or perhaps just the list of files isn't complete.

Though ignored, should probably be fixed upstream, too.

I've now built this 110 times, on the following hardware: 

* Sun Ultra 27
* 3.33 GHz Intel Xeon processor
* 12 GB RAM
* OpenSolaris 06/2009. 
* Local hard drives using 128-bit ZFS file system. 

The method used was: 

* Use 4 previous builds of Sage (different, but fairly recent versions)
* Copied the `singular-3-1-1-4.p2.spkg` package to `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/standard`
* Created a script to run ` sage -f singular-3-1-1-4.p2.spkg`
* set MAKE="make -j2" in one directory
* set MAKE="make -j12" in two different directories. 
* set MAKE="make -j30" in another directory. 

I did *'not*
* Test the package with `SAGE_CHECK=yes`
* Run any doctests. 

So at any one time, 4 builds of singular would take place, each in parallel, with either 2, 12 or 30 threads. The load average of the machine changed from around 9 to 11, but averaged about 10.  Each build took just over 6 minutes, but since 4 builds were taking place in parallel, this was an average build time of about 1.5 minutes/build. 

So there does not appear to be any parallel build issues. 

So positive review.

François, could you add your patch to #9946?

I'm going to release 4.6.alpha1 with #9946 as a known problem, since alpha1 *is* an alpha and we need more real-world tests.
