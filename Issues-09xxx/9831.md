It seems that ``Permutation(list)`` requires that the elements of list are exactly 1, 2, ..., n, but this is not clearly documented. Other values of ``list`` are accepted without error and lead to strange behaviours later.

When ``list`` contains 0:

Yes, Permutation should check the input. Moreover, it should be better documented.


In cycle notation:

```
sage: Permutation([(1,2),(3,4),(1,3)])
[3, 1, 1, 3]
```

which is not a permutation.

Would you mind if I resolve failing doctests? I am new to the Sage development, so I am not sure whether someone is working on this issue right now.
