It would be really nice if this plotted an arrow from (1,2) to (3,4):

```
sage: v=vector([1,2])
sage: u=vector([2,2])
sage: plot(u,start=v)
```

or maybe the option should be "base" or "origin"

To fix this, just change the plot method in `devel/sage/sage/modules/free_module_element.pyx`

I think "start=list/tuple/vector" is the best convention for this option.

This patch causes an amusing error, which does not occur in the vanilla Sage:

```

sage: plot(vector([1]))
ERROR: An unexpected error occurred while tokenizing input
The following traceback may be corrupted or invalid
The error message is: ('EOF in multi-line statement', (2, 0))

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ArithmeticError                           Traceback (most recent call last)
<snip>
ArithmeticError: Cross product only defined for vectors of length three or seven, not (3 and 1)
```
I think I can fix this, so patch hopefully coming up.

I think I have it fixed.  However, the bizarre error messages remain for one-dimensional arrows, so I have created followup ticket #10925 for that.

Okay, positive review on this nice addition from the original patch.  

The reviewer patch still needs review; it fixes the problem by extending the one-dimensional start as well, and adds/spruces up some documentation.  Reviewer should check things work, doctests, and that documentation looks ok.
