It would be really nice if this plotted an arrow from (1,2) to (3,4):

```
sage: v=vector([1,2])
sage: u=vector([2,2])
sage: plot(u,start=v)
```

or maybe the option should be "base" or "origin"

To fix this, just change the plot method in `devel/sage/sage/modules/free_module_element.pyx`

I think "start=list/tuple/vector" is the best convention for this option.

Okay, positive review on this nice addition from the original patch.  

The reviewer patch still needs review; it fixes the problem by extending the one-dimensional start as well, and adds/spruces up some documentation.  Reviewer should check things work, doctests, and that documentation looks ok.
