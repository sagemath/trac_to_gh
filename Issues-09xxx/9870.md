The `spkg-install` file for Cliquer could do with a lot of cleaning up. Some examples of the problems are:

* There are flags set for the C++ and Fortran compilers, though the code is only C. 
* There's code to check for a mix of Sun and GNU compilers, which is pointless since there is only 1 compiler used.
* Lots of unnecessary environment variables are set.
* Use `make` instead of `$MAKE`.
* Runs tests in `spkg-install` instead of `spkg-check`.

**None of these issues are currently causing any problems, but should be resolved at some point**

Depends on #14349

To tranquilize Dave :-)

I've made several comments at tickets related to Cliquer, e.g. #9833 and #9871.

I think this should then be a follow-up of #9871, despite the numbers.

Hello !

> There is one technical question you can however answer. Do we need the binary file "cl" so it can be executed from the command line, or is the library libcliquer.so sufficient?

No, the cl file is not used, and this is precisely what the Sage code included in cliquer is useful for : directly calling the library's functions with a Graph object using the Graph structure it expects to find, without having to create an ugly temporary file to call the executable on it `:-)`

<div id="comment:14" align="right">Comment 14</div>

Don't know why trac was not able to merge the branch as I encountered no conflicts when merging it.

I've made a few changes to make the script more like the "new" scripts as described in the dev guide, you may not be happy with them and are very welcome to change them back.
Otherwise let's positively review this ticket.

Anyway, I'm going to autotoolify cliquer, post it in a follow-up ticket and suggest it upstream.
The Makefile is just too awful right now.

FYI, upstream has nicely answered my questions.
They don't really mind cliquer being distributed in different forms in various places and don't plan on releasing any new upstream version "in the next ten years or so (or ever?)".
