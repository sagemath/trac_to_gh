In the text version of Sage, `var('x');` does not print anything.
However, in the notebook, it prints `x`, even with the `;`
that should prevent output. This is quite annoying. Is there a reason for that?

Also, `automatic_names` does not work in the terminal version.

Changed the title to identify the underlying issue.  Note that 1+2; also prints out something in the notebook, but not in the command line.

My guess is that it is a convention in ipython, since a semicolon does nothing in just plain python:

```
% sage -python
Python 2.6.4 (r264:75706, May  6 2010, 23:38:46) 
[GCC 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5659)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 1+2;

note sure what to do with this ticket. At least we can try to list all inconsistencies between the terminal version and the notebook:

* `1+2;` does not print anything in the terminal version, but does print something in the notebook

* `__` and `____` do not work in the notebook

* `automatic_names` does not work in the terminal version

Are there any other differences?

Replying to [@zimmermann6](#comment:3):
> * `1+2;` does not print anything in the terminal version, but does print something in the notebook

The printing in the notebook is a little more different than just that:

```
1;2;
```
prints

```
1
2
```
whereas

```
1
2
```
prints

```
2
```
and

```
(1
)
```
prints nothing, whereas

```
(1)
```
prints

```
1
```
i.e., it seems that all results from statements contained entirely on the last line of the cell are printed, regardless of semicolons, and no other results are. To me this seems a little arbitrary, but resolving this is probably something for the notebook.

I've created #29888 for automatic_names in Jupyter.

This ticket can still be about differences between the terminal and Jupyter notebook, but probably should be updated for differences between that one and the terminal, not the sagenb and terminal.
