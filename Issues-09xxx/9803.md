This will vastly improve the documentation of the `random_matrix` command in common use cases (integers, rationals,...).

It will also allow for new, more specialized constructions, such as Billy Wonderly's work at #9720, #9754, #9802.

See #9720 for motivating discussion.

<a id='comment:1'></a>Patch expands the functionality of the `random_matrix` routine.  A matrix space is used to accumulate the base ring, dimensions and representation (sparse/dense).  This can then be passed to the new `random_*_matrix` routines where a matrix can actually be constructed and returned.

Documentation for previous behavior greatly expanded, notably for integer and rational matrices.  New routines are demonstrated, with clear directions (links, imports) to expanded documentation.

Had to handle density and sparse keywords in a backwards-compatible fashion, so they are "popped" out of the `kwds` dictionary and passed as before to the matrix randomize() routine.  The keywords are now required and won't work as positional arguments.  Had to adjust code in the group theory isomorphism code in a couple of modules as a result.

This code below looks like some artifact of the switch to allowing/disallowing zero entries.  I've left it in, though it *never* gets called in any of the tests (I checked).  Before my changes, `density` had a default value of 1, so you would have to consciously pass in `None` to make this happen.  It was not documented.

```
        if density is None:
            A.randomize(density=float(1), nonzero=False, *args, **kwds)
        else:
            A.randomize(density=density, nonzero=True, *args, **kwds)
```

One fix in mod n dense matrix code.  Could not figure out how `range(25)` was doing anything useful, and it was ending up in the algorithm argument, so in the end I just removed it and the affected test passes.

Thanks for your input.  I think this is much improved organized this way, and I finally did something about the documentation for the `random_matrix()` command.  ;-)
