In #8830 we worked around PolyBoRi's broken dynamic libraries by removing them after build, hence using the static ones instead. The problem was caused by improper handling of a global variable which was fixed for upcoming PolyBoRi 0.7.

The package at http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/dreyer/pb/polybori-0.6.4.p5.spkg backports this fix and reintroduces the dynamic libraries. The spkg is based on #9717 and assumes its sage-library patch to be applied. It installs, runs and passed testall on boxen.


## Remark
There's an updated skpg, which adresses the issues of #9872:
http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/dreyer/spkg/polybori-0.6.4.p6.spkg

**Assignee:** @alexanderdreyer

**CC:**  PolyBoRi @malb @wjp mvngu

**Author:** Alexander Dreyer

**Reviewer:** Martin Albrecht

**Upstream:** Fixed upstream, in a later stable release.

The SPKG looks good, I'm running installation + doctests on a few platforms right now, so far that also looks good.

A somewhat related issue (feel free to ignore): It seems scons doesn't touch for example polybori.h if that didn't change. It would thus be nice to touch this file at the end of spkg-install to inform the Sage build system that it needs to rebuild the extensions. If you agree I can provide a patch.

I built this SPKG and ran long doctests on bsd.math, sage.math and t2.math. They all worked fine, thus I'm giving this a positive review.
