```
The Pari `isprime` function is able to return a primality
certificate:

```
gp: isprime(2^31-1,1)

[2 3 1]

[3 5 1]

[7 3 1]

[11 3 1]

[31 2 1]

[151 3 1]

[331 3 1]
```
However when calling this function from Sage, the certificate is
lost:

```
sage: pari(2^31-1).isprime(1)
True
```

apparently something changed (in worse) since I reported this, since indeed we now get:

```
sage: pari(2^31-1).isprime(1)
False
```
I change the priority to "major".

by the way I notice there is no indication on how to access or change the "arithmetic proof flag" mentioned in the documentation of `n.is_prime`.

And the documentation of `get_flag` is ill-formed in the terminal version.

Attachment [trac_9401.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket9401/trac_9401.patch) by @zimmermann6 created at 2013-08-25 12:45:08

the attached patch does several things:

1) it fixes two typos in `gen.pyx`

2) it corrects the behaviour of `pari(n).isprime(1)` which incorrectly was returning `False` for prime n

3) for prime n, now `pari(n).isprime(1)` returns a tuple `(True, cert)` where `cert` is the primality certificate (currently as Pari object, I didn't figure out how to convert it to a Python object)

Comments are welcome.

In principle OK, but needs to be rebased on #15124.

Also, it would be much cleaner to call `new_gen()` instead of initialising the `gen` and resetting the stack by hand:

```python
cdef GEN x
pari_catch_sig_on()
x = gisprime(self.g, flag)
if typ(x) != t_INT:
    # case flag=1 with prime input: x is the certificate
    return True, P.new_gen(x)
else:
    pari_catch_sig_off()
    return bool(signe(x))
```
