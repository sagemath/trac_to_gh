As discussed here

http://groups.google.co.uk/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/c566520374106df3

[GNU patch](http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/patch/) will be added to Sage. This is ticket #9418. 

In order to make use of the command, the developers guide will need to be updated to reflect a new way of making patch commands. We should sort out the details as precisely as possible, so everyone uses the exact same method.

How do you like the following high-level steps, suppose we want to create sphinx-1.0.4.p3

```
1) create a directory sphinx-1.0.4.p3
2) put upstream source in sphinx-1.0.4.p3/src
For every ISSUE which needs to be patched, do the following:
    3) cp -pr sphinx-1.0.4.p3 sphinx-1.0.4.p3.patched
    4) edit sphinx-1.0.4.p3.patched/src to fix ISSUE.
    5) diff -ur sphinx-1.0.4.p3/src sphinx-1.0.4.p3.patched/src >sphinx-1.0.4.p3/patches/ISSUE.patch
    6) rm -r sphinx-1.0.4.p3.patched

After thinking about it some more, perhaps the following is better:

```
1) create a directory sphinx-1.0.4.p3
2) cd sphinx-1.0.4.p3
2) put upstream source in sphinx-1.0.4.p3/src
For every ISSUE which needs to be patched, do the following:
    3) cp -pr src src.patched
    4) edit src.patched to fix ISSUE.
    5) diff -ur src src.patched >patches/ISSUE.patch
    6) rm -r src.patched
```

To apply the patches in `spkg-install`:

```
1) cd src
2) patch -p1 <../patches/ISSUE.patch
```

<a id='comment:6'>Comment 6:</a>
So, in what order should `patches/*.patch` be applied?

It's not *that* unlikely *in principle "unrelated"* patches affect the same parts of code (or at least modify parts near to each other in the same file), such that multiple patches against vanilla upstream source won't apply smoothly in (arbitrary) sequence.

There should (in addition) be some documentation on what files are patched by what "ISSUE", I'd suggest in an `SPKG.txt` section and / or a `patches/README`[`.txt`]. (If "ISSUE" is almost self-explanatory, we don't need extra comments in `spkg-install`, but then other files should contain further details and references to the relevant tickets.)

What if some patches only have to be applied on platform XY?

I think creating `src-$ISSUE/` for each "ISSUE" and then doing `diff -ur src/ src-$ISSUE/ > patches/$ISSUE.patch` is equally valid.

And IMHO doing e.g. `cd src/ && diff -u file.orig file > ../patches/file.patch` should be valid for "simple" patches as well (then using `cd src ; patch -p0 < ../patches/file.patch`, or omitting the `-p0`), though perhaps using `diff -u src/file.orig src/file ...` (and applying them from the top level spkg directory) would be better.

So I'm not convinced there is a single best way to go in all cases.

That's up to the writer of `spkg-install`.

Agreed.  I prefer in `SPKG.txt` because then all the information about the package is contained in one file.

> What if some patches only have to be applied on platform XY?

Same as today.  Instead of a conditional `cp`, we have a conditional `patch`.

> I think creating `src-$ISSUE/` for each "ISSUE" and then doing `diff -ur src/ src-$ISSUE/ > patches/$ISSUE.patch` is equally valid.

Agreed.

I would prefer that all patches can be *applied* the same way, namely from `src/` with a `-p1` strip level.  So I disagree.

> though perhaps using `diff -u src/file.orig src/file ...` (and applying them from the top level spkg directory) would be better.

Okay for me.

Did you get anywhere with this? The issue is quite important, as currently the developers guide is still advising the use of 'cp'  and saying not to use 'patch'. 

One thing we need to be careful of is that when testing the patch, people don't overwrite the src directory. Which makes me think, should the write permissions for all files below src be removed? That would at least prevent that accident, though perhaps it would screw up some packages.

We could even check if they applied seamlessly, without fuzz (which I think should be the case in spkgs; otherwise they should get rebased).

Opinions?

Well, you usually *want (or need) to overwrite / modify* files in `src/` when applying patches from within `spkg-install`...

Note that you don't need write permissions on a file you're going to patch, but on its containing directory.

A minor typo, with "an" instead of "a". 

"so if you are writing an spkg which is not part of the standard"

Personally I would have used:

```
diff -Naur
```

which seems one of the most common ways. There's some discussion in 

http://linux.die.net/man/1/patch

of the best arguments to use. The main change is that this is recursive, so if one edits multiple files to make a change to sort out some problem, there can be one patch file to resolve the problem, rather than having to make one for each file.

http://grammar.quickanddirtytips.com/a-versus-an.aspx

says:
*The rule is  that you use a before words that start with a consonant sound and an before words that start with a vowel sound (1).*


http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_articles#Discrimination_between_a_and_an

basically says the same thing, but is less clear about it. 

The letter 's' is certainly a consonant, and not a vowel, and I don't think 'spkg' sounds like a vowel (as for example 'hour' does, despite it starting with a consonant). So I would have thought it should have been "a spkg" and not "an spkg". But it's not a big deal.

I guess 'spkg' is not a word, and I don't know if its an abbreviation for something.

Wow, great!  Looks good, applies to alpha4 fine, builds and doc looks great.  

As I said, I don't feel comfortable addressing the shell stuff, but I like this.  Here are a few tiny things.
* Syntax:

```
sage -f /URL/to/package-x.y.z.spkg
```
   Maybe, just to be pedantic, 

```
sage -f http://URL/to/package-x.y.z.spkg
```
   Or maybe that will cause more confusion than the original one...
* One actual error I found, I think.

```
matplotlib-1.0.1.p0/src/lib/matplotlib/finance.py.patch
```
   I think that should just be finance.py, right?   Should be easy to refresh the `part2.patch`, I hope.  Sorry.

* And a teensy teensy thing:

```
A main message of this section is
``` 
   should that be `The main`?  I realize this is "legacy documentation", but might as well spruce it up.

* A question, probably due to ignorance:

```
diff -u src/configure src-patched/configure > patches/configure.patch 
```
   will that make a patch that actually applies correctly?  I feel like this will produce one with a header that says

```
--- a/src/configure
+++ b/src-patched/configure
```
   that wouldn't apply, as opposed to 

```
--- a/src/configure
+++ b/src/configure
```

---
Otherwise, here are things that need to be reviewed that I don't feel comfortable doing, though I'm sure they are right.
* the argument about `diff -u` versus `diff -Naur`
* the `[This is the Trac macro *-z "$SAGE_LOCAL" * that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#-z "$SAGE_LOCAL" -macro)` change 
* Changing to `--` instead of `-` for options to commands, like `sage --pkg`.
* `cp -pR`
* `patch -p1 <"$patch"` versus `patch -p1 < "$patch"` (the latter is probably just my imagination, but I know that shell script cares about spaces at times) and in general verifying that that is the correct syntax, though I'm sure it is based on seeing various of Leif's spkgs

Anyone who uses these a lot can check them off as correct and this can go in.

---
Regarding "a" versus "an".
> The letter 's' is certainly a consonant, and not a vowel, and I don't think 'spkg' sounds like a vowel (as for example 'hour' does, despite it starting with a consonant). So I would have thought it should have been "a spkg" and not "an spkg". But it's not a big deal.

Ah, but I've never heard "spkg" pronounced other than as "esspackage".  Vowel sound.  Sort of like how different people will say "an (h)istorical" or "a historical", and both are right.

Great, thanks for catching these.  I've updated the "part2" patch.

 ```
 diff -u src/configure src-patched/configure > patches/configure.patch 
 ```

When you run "patch -p1 file.patch", it strips the file names up to the first slash ("-pN" strips up to the Nth slash), so it will patch a file "configure" in the current directory.  (So this patch command should be run after cd'ing to `src`.  I've added such a cd command to one of the examples.)

Ok, that clarifies `patch`.

I also did a *lot* of reading of man pages and searches, and the shell stuff checks out.  I agree than `diff -u` is totally appropriate for this particular context of creating spkg patches (not in general!).  

Last question (but positive review!) - why

```
[[ -z "$SAGE_LOCAL" ]]
```
and not 

```
[ -z "$SAGE_LOCAL" ]
```
since it seems like in this situation (no 'and's) they behave identically?
