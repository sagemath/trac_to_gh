```
In the following list `l`, some elements repeat quite often:

```
sage: l = [ SphericalDistribution(dimension=2).get_random_element() for _ in range(1000)]
sage: uniq = []
sage: for x in l:
    if x not in uniq:
        uniq.append(x)
....:
sage: len(uniq)
34
```

The output is not random. For example, the first line is repeated ~30 times in the 1000 lines of output. It works fine if SphericalDistribution is only instantiated once!

Depends on #9958

The bug is not unique to the spherical distribution; rather, it has to do with whether the distribution is instantiated prior to the use of the random element method.  The worksheet above illustrates the same behavior with the Gaussian and uniform distributions.

Oh, wow.  This is because of the lines

```
            self.seed = random.randint(1, 2^32)
```

2 xor 32 is 34.. and the `^` vs. `**` bug strikes again.

Urf.  Probably (?) we can simply replace `2**32` here with sys.maxint, but I can't be sure because I can't reproduce.

Emailed a guy who I know has access to a solaris box :-) but haven't heard back.  If anyone with an account on hawk could report the results of a cut-and-paste of the following

```
preparser(False)
import random, sys

nn = [2**31, 2**32, sys.maxint]
for n in nn:
    for d in -1, 0, 1:
        print n, d, n+d, repr(n+d), type(n+d)
        try:
            seed = random.randint(1, n+d)
        except Exception as err:
            print err
        try:
            random.seed(n+d)
        except Exception as err:
            print err
```

from within Sage, that would test whether I understand what's going on.
