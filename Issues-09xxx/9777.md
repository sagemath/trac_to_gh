p-adics should be included, perhaps at "level 0"?

The following "level 1" rings are not included in `sage.rings.tests`:

* power series rings

* Laurent series rings

* multivariate power series rings (implemented in #1956)

* infinite polynomial rings

Also, it's not clear that "level n" testing occurs for `n > 1`; e.g. multivariate polynomial ring in 3 variables over Laurent series ring over finite field of size 29, etc.

Quotient rings are also not included, but should be.  There are probably more to be included than this list indicates.

Is this doctest checking the right function?

```patch
+
+def padic_field():
+    """
+    Return a random p-adic field modulo n with p at most 10000
+    and precision between 10 and 100.

+

+    """
+    from sage.all import ZZ, Qp

+    p = ZZ.random_element(x=2, y=10**4 - 30).next_prime()

```

In any case, it would be nice to avoid adding *new* tests that require a specific random seed. We're pretty close to making all testing random testing.
