I was working on the Ribet-Stein book, and a computation that is trivial in Magma, and must have been trivial in Sage until recently is now impossibly hard.

```
sage: M = ModularForms(1,512)
sage: time M.hecke_matrix(5)
[[takes a very, very long time indeed.]]
```
This is very sad, since M has dimension only 43. Also, it is easy to get the answer directly --from start to finish in less than a second! -- as follows:

```
sage: time B = victor_miller_basis(512,5*43+1)
CPU times: user 0.21 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.21 s
Wall time: 0.21 s
sage: time t5 = hecke_operator_on_basis(B, 5, 512)
CPU times: user 0.61 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.61 s
Wall time: 0.61 s
```
