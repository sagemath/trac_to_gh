[http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/palmieri/SPKG/python-2.7.p0.spkg](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/palmieri/SPKG/python-2.7.p0.spkg)

John (jhpalmieri) reports that this builds but Sage does not on sage.math, and "packages for
twisted, zodb, pygments, and numpy don't build correctly."

Apparently the fix for [http://bugs.python.org/issue7491](http://bugs.python.org/issue7491) causes some of these problems.

On the numpy/scipy lists Ralf Gommers says "Numpy 1.5 should work with Python 2.7 and 3.1 and not be too far off. In August hopefully". 

So it looks like [https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/9808](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/9808) should fix the numpy issues.

This fix has been included in python-2.6.5 onwards. We are using 2.6.5 which includes this fix and everything builds (haven't tried 2.7 yet). The only problem we have is with [http://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/issues#issue/1](http://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/issues#issue/1) so I think it is unfair to single out this issue as the source of problems.

It will happen at least in sage-on-gentoo as we are following the system python.
I have a couple of things in our tree to fix problems with python-2.6.5 and 2.6.6
we are looking into 2.7 now. I should post any patch to have it working here.

We are not talking about using the new capabilities just porting, I imagine my
counterpart in Mandriva does the same.

I attached a log of test failures with 4.7.alpha4 (+ #7377). It is mostly number of decimals and messages. I added PYTHONWARNINGS=default to sage-env so I collected extra messages. The most important one being the deprecations of "sets".

There are 3 tests killed reason currently unknown. And a few that may need special attention.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred in Sage.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* component of Sage has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off(). You might
want to run Sage under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
Sage will now terminate.

I think that one is OK, just a change of order but a second opinion would be nice.

Finally there are still three tests killed in libsingular's id_delete because a ring has been garbage collected even so there are some precautions in place for it:
[http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/8c165c887d6b9e54](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/8c165c887d6b9e54)

Next we need an updated python spkg so that more people can play and even try the patchbot on it.

Hi Karl,

I am mainly developing from sage-on-gentoo at the moment. I need to make a current python-2.7.1 spkg to match. I will update the description and give the patch order when there is a spkg (feel free to make one). The patch have initially been made against 4.7.1.alpha0 and the current version works against 4.7.1.alpha1. You would get failures against a 4.7 because #7377 finally landed.

I think the best course of action will be to start from scratch, it may even be useful to host an alternative tarball somewhere because the change in python version will be extremely messy. I don't know if we can do it without breaking sage -upgrade or being overly complicated.

In the meantime you could have a look at #11244 (which I need to update for 4.7.1.alpha1 because of #10334). 

Francois

My friend Steven Trogdon made some quick and dirty spkgs. His early tests indicate that setuptools needs to be updated. This is now #11363 it also revealed that I missed something in misc/cython.py watch out for an updated patch sometimes this weekend.
There were also a few things that needed to be done in two other patches which I refreshed yesterday.
I have a python-2.7.1 spkg ready to be uploaded probably sometimes today.
If you want fun before that you can always use Steve's spkg (they are not in a reviewable state) at:

Didn't take long. I have been naughty and committed two changes to patches that needed touching after my first commit of python-2.7.1 so the log will show 3 entries for just the one SPKG.txt entry. They were minor changes.
I dropped a number of patches because they were applied upstream. However in the case of two patches I dropped them because the upstream has changed in a way they don't apply anymore but I don't know if patching is still necessary for the underlying issues. If so new patches will need to be developed. The issues are
* readline on itanium
* multiprocessing on solaris

As promised I will give a patch order. The next to last one needs updating as stated earlier and the last one is really optional. The patches do not have to be taken n that order as they don't overlap.

Did you rebuild cython after the python upgrade? In fact I have now added a list of package that needs to be rebuild after the python upgrade. Not all of them are necessary for building sage (scipy could be done after) but cython, numpy, matplotlib and pynac really need to be rebuilt.

Once you have done that apply all the patches with build in their names:
* [attachment: trac_9958-build_setuppy.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9958/trac_9958-build_setuppy.patch.gz)

That should help sage build but will not correct many of the doctests. To fix most of the doctests apply the patches in #11244 as well as the one in the description of this bug. I have made a list now, have you seen it?

I may have made mistakes, but I tried to do this, starting with sage-4.7.rc4:

- install the new python spkg
- install the new setuptools spkg (from #11363)
- apply the patches from #11244 to the main Sage library
- apply the patches from this ticket with "build" in their name -- some of these didn't apply cleanly, so I had to work around that.

I used that to build a new version of Sage (using "sage -sdist ...").  The tar file is here:

On sage.math, I've been able to untar this and build Sage, although tests haven't run yet.  You can also try upgrading, although I haven't tested this at all: run

```
$ sage -upgrade http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/palmieri/misc/python2.7/sage-4.7.rc4-python2.7/

I have tried to keep abreast of everything so the patches are based on 4.7.1.alpha1 there are enough differences that a lot of patches for 4.7 would need rebasing.

So I decided to go straight for the bleeding edge. I am doing some more work on the "build" patches, I am trying to do something smarter with the python version number so some change could be applied independently of this ticket. The module_list,py patch definitely won't apply cleanly on 4.7.rc mainly because of #10334. What's more #11264 and #11236 which are needed here are merged in 4.7.1.alpha0.

That's all a bit of hassle to start from 4.7.1.alpha, but I would have to start again if I was starting from 4.7.rc.

I am splitting the ticket again: in #11376 we make sage building system smart and work out the python version by itself. If we get this in the next alpha that will make testing easier as you won't need a patched sage spkg to build against python-2.7.1. One will still need to patch the doctests afterwards and any other issues but it will build.

In #11377 I put the clean up of module_list.py this is not necessary for python-2.7.1 per see but it would be a huge favour to me if it was going in (it makes work on sage-on-gentoo and sage-prefix much easier).

It didn't seem to fix things (and I did check the md5 sum).  I'm now starting a build from scratch, having replaced the python and sage spkgs.  

By the way, now that 4.7.1.alpha1 is "official", one may have to upgrade the drop-in spkg.

Were you using the new setuptools from #11363? If so it may be worth trying a newer twisted from #8741.

python testing is difficult. Even in gentoo the procedure is complicated. I'll have a look at it but I cannot make promise. There may be modules that we shouldn't build in the first place (nothing useful to sage, don't worry).

We have this for example in the ebuild:

```
	if use berkdb; then
		ewarn "\"bsddb\" module is out-of-date and no longer maintained inside dev-lang/python. It has"
		ewarn "been additionally removed in Python 3. You should use external, still maintained \"bsddb3\""
		ewarn "module provided by dev-python/bsddb3 which supports both Python 2 and Python 3."
	fi
```

gdb, gdm, dbm and tk require extra things on the host system so they may very well fail without. Actually according to the ebuild distutils and gdm are known to fail.

Just for the record:

https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/8664#comment:33 gives an example on how to automatically rebuild packages that depend on a newly added spkg (here: Python).

(Artificial version bumps aren't necessary, and simply `touch`ing `spkg/installed/<spkg-that-others-depend-on>` alone doesn't work.)

In general:
1. Copy the new spkg(s) to `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/standard/`.
2. `export SAGE_UPGRADING=yes`
3. (Optionally set `MAKE` and `SAGE_PARALLEL_SPKG_BUILD`, perhaps `SAGE_CHECK`.)
4. Run `make` (or better `make build`) rather than doing `./sage -f ...`
5. Apply patches to the Sage library.
6. Run `./sage -b` (or `./sage -ba-force` in case not all dependencies are covered by `module_list.py`, which in general I'd consider a bug, but this might be necessary upon a Python upgrade)
7. Run tests or whatever.

Note that Sage switches to the "main" branch whenever the Sage spkg gets reinstalled.

Of course patches to the build system are usually a bit trickier, but as far as I can see Francois already sorted these out.

I tried this (new python spkg plus all of the patches, then built from scratch) and I'm seeing a bunch of doctest failures.  Are some of these due to #11339?

```
The following tests failed:

        sage -t  -long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/categories/finite_crystals.py # 1 doctests failed
        sage -t  -long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/rings/morphism.pyx # 0 doctests failed
        sage -t  -long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/rings/integer.pyx # 3 doctests failed
        sage -t  -long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/rings/homset.py # 0 doctests failed
        sage -t  -long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/rings/padics/padic_capped_relative_element.pyx #  1 doctests failed
        sage -t  -long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/combinat/e_one_star.py # 1 doctests failed
        sage -t  -long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/combinat/words/nfactor_enumerable_word.py # 2 doctests failed
        sage -t  -long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/geometry/polyhedra.py # 1 doctests failed
        sage -t  -long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/schemes/generic/scheme.py # 0 doctests failed
        sage -t  -long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/symbolic/callable.py # 5 doctests failed
```
I think I did everything right.  I put together a Sage distribution with the python spkg and the patches, based on 4.7.2.alpha1:

- [http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/palmieri/misc/9958/sage-4.7.2.9958.tar](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/palmieri/misc/9958/sage-4.7.2.9958.tar)

Upgrade path:

Any failures from #11339 gives you a killed doctest, so

```
sage -t  -long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/rings/morphism.pyx
sage -t  -long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/rings/homset.py
sage -t  -long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/schemes/generic/scheme.py
```
could all be, a verbose run would help figure it out. By nature #11339 is somewhat random, not everyone see the same failures but all these are familiar.

Just checking the others with my current list.

* sage/categories/finite_crystals.py is a new one introduced in 4.7.2 where the error message has changed slightly when using python-2.7.
* sage/rings/integer.pyx is definitely python-2.7 related but not patched yet because I am not sure what should be done there.
* sage/rings/padics/padic_capped_relative_element.pyx same thing
* sage/combinat/e_one_star.py I had a patch but it became to fuzzy haven't done a new one.
* sage/combinat/words/nfactor_enumerable_word.py python-2.7 two successive results are inverted, I want someone else to look at that one to make sure we can just do the obvious thing.
* sage/symbolic/callable.py new in 4.7.2 change in the error message because we are running python-2.7
* sage/geometry/polyhedra.py never seen that one before, can you re-run it and give more info on the failure?

As you can see a few more patches are needed and apart from #11339 which is a big show stopper because of the crashes at least two other tests point to some potential problems that should be looked at.

The failures newforms.pyx, real_mpfr.pyx and intlist.pyx are all of the form:

```

These tests do not fail on amd64 because "long int too large to convert to int" is returned as the OverflowError instead of "Python int too large to convert to C long".

Here is one of the killed ones (not a timeout, I'm surprised):

```

The doctested process was killed by signal 10

Could this be an unrelated 4.7.2.alpha1 issue on my platform?

I am particularly interested in the killed/crashed tests. And also those for which there is already a patch.

```
sage -t -long "devel/sage/sage/libs/cremona/newforms.pyx"
sage -t -long "devel/sage/sage/rings/real_mpfr.pyx"
sage -t -long "devel/sage/sage/stats/intlist.pyx"
```
are the 32/64 bits message difference already mentioned by Steve.

The timeouts are the regular suspect on ppc if I am not mistaken.

The transcendental.py doctest you are quoting is worrying me. It is patched in [attachment: trac_9958-fixing_numericalnoise-part1.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9958/trac_9958-fixing_numericalnoise-part1.patch.gz) but you have a slightly different result again (one less digit on the last number). We may have to consider 
a different patch.

All killed/crashed doctest are candidates for #11339 but you'll have to run sage -gdb on them to be sure.

Almost anything with "polynomial" in its name is likely to use singular (and crypto/mq/mpolynomialsystem.py is no exception), signal 10 is apparently a user defined signal so it could be anything. 

We'll have to wait for the hurricane to move on before Karl can answer us on any of this points.

Looking back at you list Karl I am also very curious about

```
sage -t -long "devel/sage/sage/structure/sage_object.pyx

sage -t -long "devel/sage/sage/misc/randstate.pyx"

two of these have already been patched (sage_object and randstate) in this ticket so I am quite curious about what's wrong with them.

So, I did test this with Sage 4.7.2.alpha2 on my "last" 32-bit machine, a Pentium4 Prescott (which has SSE3) running Ubuntu 9.04; my other Pentium4 (Northwood, without SSE3 / PNI) recently died, and I won't revive it in the near future.

The good news are: The patches all still apply to 4.7.2.alpha2, though many hunks with partially large offsets, but no fuzz.

The bad news: I expected some numerical noise because of 32-bit architecture with (there rather rare) SSE3 (`-mfpmath=sse`), but also experienced at least one segfault (in `sage/rings/homset.py`). I'll have to investigate the rest, for now just:

I was also surprised by the polyhedra.py additional weirdness.  Anything I can do to help identify it?  Warning: I'm planning on building and testing alpha2 *without* Python 2.7 now, which will tie up most resources on this machine for a couple days.

Here the fix_transcendental patch fixed the associated test on x86 but now the test fails on amd64:

This is odd! I wonder what changed? Previously this test must have returned ...67 and not ...63 for it to pass.

It's my fault for not noticing this difference between 32 and 64 bit results. It was there before but I didn't notice it. I thought the last number was the only thing different so when I truncated the last number to the common digits I dropped the difference between 32 and 64 bit. So it is entirely my fault.

Just for reference, on the PPC machine all tests pass with alpha2 except three timeouts which are long-standing (I didn't bother to set `SAGE_TIMEOUT_LONG` but I've seen these many times).

So all the rest are due to this ticket or #11339.  

Would it be helpful for me to do #11339 on this new build (without Python 2.7), or is that in limbo right now anyway?  Alternately, is there any way to decouple this ticket from that one?

sage: int(n)
9223372036854784000L
sage: hash(int(n))
-9223372036854767616
```
Furthermore in both case:

```
sage: type(n)
<type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>
sage: type(int(n))
<type 'long'>
```
So I would expect different hashes naively.

Well, we did take the patch from Python upstream, but IIRC there are further changes to `spkg-install`, and the new spkg needs the previous one to be mentioned in `SPKG.txt` anyway (to pass the merger's sanity check).

sage-5.0 is probably more realistic. Thanks for the useful comments, I hadn't seen the warnings in the documentation, this probably could be spun out of this ticket as it is probably a problem in the existing doc - just silent with the current python. I really would like to go to 2.7.3 when it comes out but I'll make a stop 2.7.2. I have a heavy workload this week but I'll try to put the spkg together.

I am surprised at the "latin-1" encoding I am defaulting to UTF-8 and even my Changelogs now come correct everywhere.

We need someone with the know how to look at #11986.

Especially since William essentially *defined* sage-5.0 as the release which will contain this ticket.

> I hadn't seen the warnings in the documentation, this probably could be spun out of this ticket as it is probably a problem in the existing doc - just silent with the current python.

True, but I have no idea how Python 2.7 has changed this particular doctest.  It could also be that something changed inside Sphinx or Cython because of Python 2.7.

> I am surprised at the "latin-1" encoding I am defaulting to UTF-8 and even my Changelogs now come correct everywhere.

And now you're punished for the rest of your live as a developer because your name is not ASCII (and please don't write "Francois", that just looks very wrong).

> We need someone with the know how to look at #11986.

I *might* have a look, but I don't want to promise anything.  In any case, once #11986 is really the only remaining issue, it will certainly get fixed.

All right. Very busy week so far. I am removing the last patch and will spin it in a separate ticket because Steve did more testing and it appears that the test is somewhat random and was only working everywhere the same with python 2.6 by sheer luck. 

Steve had a few interesting suggestions for replacing the test but that's clearly another ticket on which we'll forward people who touched that file for comments.

I finished updating the spkg to 2.7.2 in a moment of freedom. I called it 2.7.2.p0 as it has some patches in it. Hope all the permissions are right this time. And SPKG.txt is UTF-8 now.

I will need to update one patch and I think add a new one. At least relative to 4.7.2, I am so bogged down in work that I haven't been working at all on 4.8.0 which may require new patches.

Mhy guess would be that `spkg-install` is trying to run Mercurial or something, which obviously fails because Mercurial has not been compiled yet (and it can't since it depends on Python).

Never used symbolic mode of chmod, always octal. But this looks like it is more effective to get the directory permissions right. Darn spkg-check.

Thanks for the tips. Sorry for being a pest at times.

I haven't tested the spkg from scratch on OSX I did on linux x86_64 and 4.8.alpha2.
I will see what happens on my 10.5 machine later. 2.7.1 worked from scratch there i am sure. That looks very strange, can you link the full python building log?

I need a kind soul with 32 bit linux system to explore the suffix tree issue, the doctest is as follow:

```
            sage: from sage.combinat.words.suffix_trees import ImplicitSuffixTree, SuffixTrie

            sage: t = ImplicitSuffixTree(W("aba"))

            True
```
It would be helpful to get the values of "W", "t" and "t.trie_type_dict()" on python-2.6 and 2.7. Then we can make a decision on whether the answer we get with python-2.7 is equivalent to the current output or not.

Does vanilla Sage build and run on that same machine with the same compiler?  Be sure to try a different gcc version, Linbox seems to be sensitive to that.

I now understand why you removed the transcendental patch Jereon some bits ended in my revised trac_9958-fixing_numericalnoise-part1_p2.patch when they shouldn't have. That's what is happening to Steve. I will rectify that. 

I removed the gsl bits because of #12047 so that has to be redone.

And I haven't had time to try vanilla yet but it is on my TODO list and I suspect g++ too.

This first failure is not a problem. The iterator here is extracted from a
dict of dict so it is not unexpected to have a random order. Fixing the test
of marking it at random should be ok. This test is an explanation for the
user, the real feature is tested further in the file.

```
{(4, word: a): 1, (0, word: b): 5, (0, word: a): 3, (5, word: a): 2, (3, word: b): 4}
{(4, word: b): 5, (0, word: a): 4, (0, word: b): 3, (5, word: a): 1, (3, word: a): 2}
```

This one is more tricky: As far as I understand, both result are perfectly
legible: the second is the same as the first after applying the following
cyclic permutation (3,4,5). The numbering is random. So (again as far as I
understand), the problem in only created by the cross-platform non-determinism
of the set/dict data structure. I'm not sure here what is the best fix.

Cheers,

Florent

Hi,

I just read randomly sage-devel (I was away from sage development for several weeks) and saw that the discussion about upgrading to 2.7 was having problem with some files I am related with (suffix_tree.py nfactor_enumerable_word.py). I still don't understand the dict problem for suffix tree (one minute was not enough). I will look into that to avoid similar problem in the future. If something else pops up in those file, I can do the fix next time.

OK, #9958 + #11986 + #12124, all tests pass here on 32bit and 64bit machines. Is it too early for champagne?

Hi,

I just look at the suffix tree code (written not by me but by Franco Saliola). The method `trie_type_dict` is not used anywhere in the file neither in `sage/combinat/words` neither in all Sage I would guess. So, it's kind of difficult to guess what the result should be (input and output blocks are absent in documentation). I think that method was used by Franco to compare the implementation of `ImplicitSuffixTree` with that of `SuffixTrie` but not seriously because the output is not practical (one can't create a `DiGraph` out of it).

Anyway, there are two loops in that method that both go through `.iteritems()` of a dictionary... Integer indexes present in the result depends on the ordering of those two loops. So, it is possible that a third different result is obtained in some other machine or system today or later. I just made a patch which should be more durable in the long term.

For the nfactor enumerable file, the fix is perfect.

Could you post the log for the build of python somewhere? scipy and rpy are built after sage (or at least they can be since they are runtime and not buildtime dependencies) so it is possible you were building sage itself at the same time. Is there a log for the sage spkg (in spkg/log)?

I posted the install.log here: http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jason/sage-4.8.alpha4-python2.7-install.log.bz2

If you search for "Error building Sage", you'll see the multiple times I restarted the build (that message appeared after each time I restarted the build).

Here's the list of spkg logs I have:

That's a shot in the dark so far. But the building of sage never started as there is no log for sage itself.

I digged a little bit more before posting it looks like R fails to build so I want to see r-2.14.0.p0.log but that may be a separate issue from python. matplotlib seems to fail to build too so I want matplotlib-1.0.1.p0.log and now we are talking real potential python trouble.

Interestingly, Scipy and R are definitely (right now) building before Sage.  And they usually do not, for sure not Scipy, on my ancient older Mac.  

Scipy has successfully installed, as has matplotlib.  R takes forever but so far is fine.  Maybe it was "just a race condition"?

Fairly standard each time we bump matplotlib or almost.

You R package definitely broke the first time around. I am fairly sure this is a parallel make issue. I have seen at least one instance that I suspect is parallel make on Gentoo. Of course given that it stop because of

```
make[6]: gcc: Resource temporarily unavailable
```
I think, we may have something else altogether. It should go into a separate ticket.

Plus, then you don't have to worry about getting those four extra colormaps :)  Anyway, I feel this is easier and more reasonable just to get this in 5.0.alpha0 (or whatever release is next for such a big spkg change as this ticket).",

What about just making a patch upgrade with [the 1.5-liner](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/commit/e4a34df93f6) rather than making a whole new package which would require even MORE testing?  Plus, then you don't have to worry about getting those four extra colormaps :)  Anyway, I feel this is easier and more reasonable just to get this in 5.0.alpha0 (or whatever release is next for such a big spkg change as this ticket).

I took jhpalmieri's original tarball, applied the patch from #11915 myself, built it with these settings:

```
SAGE_MATPLOTLIB_GUI=yes
SAGE_PARALLEL_SPKG_BUILD=yes
MAKE=make -j12
SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS=yes
```

on Ubuntu 10.04.  Everything built fine, and make ptestlong passed all tests. Yeah!
