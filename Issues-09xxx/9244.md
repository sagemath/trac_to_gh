I was working on doctesting `sage/rings/number_field/class_group.py`, and I was unable to resist the temptation to rewrite it. (There were all sorts of failures and inconsistencies caused by the fact that `ClassGroup` derived from `AbelianGroup`, but `FractionalIdealClass` didn't derive from `AbelianGroupElement`.) 

I have a patch for this, (which used to depend on #9242 but no longer does), which I will upload as soon as someone explains how to squash the `_test_category()` error.

These are definite improvements, well implemented, and doctests pass.  Just one remark:

The eventuality envisaged in the comment at line 95 of the patchedÂ `class_group.py` (which should be referring to ideal classes rather ideals) ought to have its own doctest, such as:

```
sage: K.<a> = QuadraticField(-23)
sage: L.<b> = K.extension(x^2 - 2)
sage: CK = K.class_group()
sage: CL = L.class_group()
sage: [CL(I).list() for I in CK]
[[0], [2], [4]]
```

Jim and I have looked at this too (we are working on #9332) and think this is nearly good to go.  (We could not see any random doctests!)

This is the only failure (we tested all of sage/rings/number_fields):

I've double-checked the failure. It's just a different choice of generators for the class group ( C250 x C2 for those keeping track)

```
sage: i = C(C.number_field().gen(),7)                
sage: j = C(C.number_field().gen(),17)

Since this sorts out the failure that John and Jim found (but which I can't reproduce), it's a positive review.

Attachment: **[trac_9244_ver4.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9244/trac_9244_ver4.patch.gz)**

Nothing wrong with the code, just my brain, apparently. It should have been

```
K.<a, b> = NumberField([x^3 - x + 1, x^2 + 26])
```
which has class group `C_6 x C_3`, but I copied and pasted the wrong lines, and the #random flag hid that. I've uploaded a fourth attempt with this correction.

Apologies for the complete mess I have been making of this ticket from start to finish.
