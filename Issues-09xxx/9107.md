In the following class tree:

```
class Bla(UniqueRepresentation):
    class Bla1(UniqueRepresentation):
        class Bla11:
            Pass
    class Bla2:
        class Bla21:
            Pass
```
The names are set to

```
        sage: Bla.Bla1.__name__
        'Bla.Bla1'
        sage: Bla.Bla2.__name__
        'Bla.Bla2'
        sage: Bla.Bla2.Bla21.__name__
        'Bla.Bla2.Bla21'
```
But

```
        sage: Bla.Bla1.Bla11.__name__
        'Bla1.Bla11'
```
whereas one would expect `'Bla.Bla1.Bla11'`
This breaks a lot of doc in categories and in particular in functorial constructions.

I think we should make this depend on #12808, because it cythonises nested classes.

Here is my analysis:

1. In sage.misc.nested_class.modify_for_nested_pickling, only those attributes of a class are (recursively) renamed that are instances of type or of `ClassType`. However, ironically, instances of `NestedClassMetaclass` are ignored.
2. It is verified that the name of the to-be-changed class is identical with its name as an attribute of the calling class. But the renaming breaks the identity.

I think the attached patch solves the problem. I get:

```
sage: class Bla(UniqueRepresentation):
....:     class Bla1(UniqueRepresentation):
....:         class Bla11:
....:             pass
....:     class Bla2:                   
....:         class Bla21:   
....:             pass
....:         
sage: Bla.Bla1.Bla11
<class `__main__`.Bla.Bla1.Bla11 at 0x46e7808>
```

The change is in `modify_for_nested_pickle`, which is called recursively. The idea is that the function should have an extra argument `first_run`, that is True by default. If the extra argument is False, then it is assumed that it is not applied for the first time.

Here: Since Bla.Bla1 is an instance of `NestedClassMetaclass`, `modify_for_nested_pickle` is called on `Bla.Bla1.Bla11`, resulting in `Bla.Bla1.Bla11.__name__=='Bla1.Bla11'`. However, since Bla is an instance of `NestedClassMetaclass` as well, the function is applied to `Bla.Bla1` and thus recursively to `Bla.Bla1.Bla11` another time.

Now, without my patch, in the second run, `modify_for_nested_pickle` would be confused by the fact that `Bla.Bla1.__dict__` lists `Bla.Bla1.Bla11` under the name `Bla11`, but `Bla11.__name__=='Bla1.Bla11'`. With my patch, `modify_for_nested_pickle` expects exactly that naming scheme, and is thus changing `Bla.Bla1.Bla11.__name__` into `"Bla.Bla1.Bla11"`.

Much BlaBla, but I think it works...

**__Potential problems__**

```
sage: module = sys.modules['__main__']
sage: getattr(module, 'Bla1.Bla11')                      
<class `__main__`.Bla.Bla1.Bla11 at 0x46e7808>
sage: getattr(module, 'Bla.Bla1.Bla11')
<class `__main__`.Bla.Bla1.Bla11 at 0x46e7808>
```
Hence, Bla.Bla1.Bla11 is listed in the module under two different names. If you think it is bad, then one could probably modify the function when first_run is false, such that the name given in the first run is erased from the module.

Moreover, the reviewer will likely find a speed regression, when excessively creating nested unique representations. But that's hardly realistic...

Even #11768 does not solve the problem.

Shall that be dealt with on a different ticket? Or in one go?

Probably on a different ticket, since I just find that even source inspection for A1 (which has a usual name) does not work...

Aha, here is an example:

The docstring of `sage.categories.algebras_with_basis.AlgebrasWithBasis.CartesianProducts.ParentMethods.one_from_cartesian_product_of_one_basis` is as follows:

```
            @cached_method   # todo: reinstate once #5843 is fixed
            def one_from_cartesian_product_of_one_basis(self):
                """
                Returns the one of this cartesian product of algebras, as per ``Monoids.ParentMethods.one``

                It is constructed as the cartesian product of the ones of the
                summands, using their :meth:`.one_basis` methods.

                This implementation does not require multiplication by
                scalars nor calling cartesian_product. This might help keeping
                things as lazy as possible upon initialization.
...
```

Could this simply be a misspelling? Note that it is written

```
:meth:`.one_basis`
```
but should certainly be

```
:meth:`one_basis`
```

If that's the case for the other warnings as well, then my patch would just uncover mistakes that happened earlier.

I think the dot is simply wrong - or is it ignored by Sphinx?

Actually here it is even worse. The text is documentation of a functorial construction, but refers to a parent method - that can't possibly work without an explicit reference to the method which must include the class which the method belongs to.

Applying this patch causes the PDF docbuilder to hang after it's done building all documents. All documents are built but there are still 6 (I'm building with `MAKE="make -j6"`) child processes which are stuck in the `multiprocessing.Pool` code. Interrupting those child processes simply causes new child processes to start which are then stuck again. It might be a bug in `multiprocessing.Pool` which is somehow triggered, I have no idea...

Yes, I did not consider the pdf docs.

If I understand correctly, we have two problems. The first problem is that with this patch, `LaTeX` is produced that can not be processed because it is two deeply nested. The second problem is independent, namely if latex fails, then the docbuilder hangs.

Do you have any clue what object is being processed when things hang?

Three questions:

1. Why is it bad? I don't see why latex should have a problem with it.
2. Isn't the "good" output without my patch just plain wrong? After all, we do have

   ```
   sage: sage.categories.sets_cat.Sets.WithRealizations.ParentMethods.Realizations.__bases__
   (sage.categories.realizations.Category_realization_of_parent,)
   ```
   and also `sage.categories.sets_cat.Sets.WithRealizations.ParentMethods.Realizations` is certainly *not* simply an alias of `WithRealizations.ParentMethods`.
3. Can you also point me to the code that created the latex output?

That was my question: Why does `latex` not compile it correctly?

And we should keep in mind that the old output has simply been wrong.

I think that the first line in the LaTeX error message is correct:

```
! LaTeX Error: Too deeply nested.
```
I think that there are too many levels of nesting of lists (from the `fulllineitems` environment). If I comment out the `Verbatim` environment that it's complaining about, I don't get an error message any more.

Please, where is the nesting? I suppose by "comment out the `Verbatim` environment that it's complaining about", you mean one of two `Verbatim` environments that were cited in[comment:28](#comment%3A28).

The first is

```
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYG{g+gp}{sage: }\PYG{k+kn}{from} \PYG{n+nn}{sage.categories.realizations} \PYG{k+kn}{import} \PYG{n}{Category\PYGZus{}realization\PYGZus{}of\PYGZus{}parent}

\PYG{g+go}{The subset algebra of \PYGZob{}1, 2, 3\PYGZcb{} over Rational Field}
\PYG{g+gp}{sage: }\PYG{n}{C} \PYG{o}{=} \PYG{n}{A}\PYG{o}{.}\PYG{n}{Realizations}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{p}{)}\PYG{p}{;} \PYG{n}{C}
\PYG{g+go}{Category of realizations of The subset algebra of \PYGZob{}1, 2, 3\PYGZcb{} over Rational Field}
\PYG{g+gp}{sage: }\PYG{n+nb}{isinstance}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{n}{C}\PYG{p}{,} \PYG{n}{Category\PYGZus{}realization\PYGZus{}of\PYGZus{}parent}\PYG{p}{)}
\PYG{g+go}{True}
\PYG{g+gp}{sage: }\PYG{n}{C}\PYG{o}{.}\PYG{n}{parent\PYGZus{}with\PYGZus{}realization}
\PYG{g+go}{The subset algebra of \PYGZob{}1, 2, 3\PYGZcb{} over Rational Field}
\PYG{g+gp}{sage: }\PYG{n}{TestSuite}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{n}{C}\PYG{p}{)}\PYG{o}{.}\PYG{n}{run}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{p}{)}
\end{Verbatim}
```
the second is

```
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]   %% PROBLEM IS THIS LINE %%
\PYG{g+gp}{sage: }\PYG{n}{A} \PYG{o}{=} \PYG{n}{Sets}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{p}{)}\PYG{o}{.}\PYG{n}{WithRealizations}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{p}{)}\PYG{o}{.}\PYG{n}{example}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{p}{)}\PYG{p}{;} \PYG{n}{A}
\PYG{g+go}{The subset algebra of \PYGZob{}1, 2, 3\PYGZcb{} over Rational Field}
\PYG{g+gp}{sage: }\PYG{n}{A}\PYG{o}{.}\PYG{n}{Realizations}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{p}{)}\PYG{o}{.}\PYG{n}{super\PYGZus{}categories}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{p}{)}
\PYG{g+go}{[Category of realizations of sets]}
\end{Verbatim}
```

I suppose `%% PROBLEM IS THIS LINE %%` in the second environment was Jeroen's addition.

So, what is "too deeply nested"? I can't believe that such a short piece of text has even enough characters to nest too deeply for latex!

Hey Nicolas and Simon,

The problem comes from the fact that there is a 4 level deep class nesting with a method (which is 5 levels deep) in the `Sets.WithRealizations.ParentMethods.Realizations.super_categories`. I've tried moving this subclass into a separate class, and this solves the pdf build issue but introduces some doctesting errors. I don't think there is a  to extend the nesting level since that is a latex thing, nor do I think we should try since 4 nested classes is a lot IMO. I'm guessing beforehand because of the improper naming, latex did the environments differently...?

Anyways the fix for the pdf build is to remove a level (or two) of class nesting.

Best,

Travis

Edit: Here are the errors I get when I move `Sets.WithRealizations` out as a separate class and then assign it into `Sets`:

```

What exactly are we talking about? `Sets.WithRealizations.ParentMethods.Realizations`?

Thanks much Travis for investigating!

I agree that there should be a recommendation for not nesting classes
too deep, for the sake of readability. But having a hard arbitrary
limit -- especially that small -- is annoying. Shame on LaTeX. Of
course, one can always spin off a subtree of nested classes into a
separate tree, but there are cases where one has a deep tree with very
few lines and no natural splitting point. For example, #10963
introduces

```
    DistributiveMagmasAndAdditiveMagmas.AdditiveAssociative.AdditiveCommutative.AdditiveUnital.AdditiveInverse
```

Hmm. Altogether, I would call this a LaTeX arbitrary hard
limitation. Luckily there seems to be an easy solution to increase
this limitation to something large enough to cover our current use
cases, namely to use the package enumitem [1]. By itself, it brings
the nesting level to 6, and we could even increase it further (10
should be really safe) using \setlistdepth{9}.

I have attached the little latex file I used for testing.

What do you think? Shall we add enumitems to the list of latex
packages loaded by Sphinx? Is this standard enough, or shall we add
enumitem.sty to the Sage distribution?

Cheers,
                                     Nicolas

Hi Nicolas,

What exactly did you do? Change sphinx.sty, as in the source you are giving? Or change doc/common/conf.py and misc/latex.py, as advised by Travis in[comment:47](#comment%3A47)?

Could it be that the following comment from [the page you are citing](http://mail.scipy.org/pipermail/ipython-user/2012-May/010144.html) applies?

```
However this requires version 3.0 of enumitem, which doesn't yet ship
with many linux latex distributions.

I changed conf.py which properly added it to the generated

Hm. Then, we are back to the question: What the heck is going wrong? Could we
perhaps ask on some `LaTeX` forum about the problem? I mean, if we have a tex
file that does not compile, even though nesting should not be the problem any
more, then I think `LaTeX` people should be made aware.

You are missing a : at the end of TEXINPUT to let latex use its own library (report.cls is a standard class). 

Or you can just be lazy and put the categories.tex file in the directory 

```

OK, after getting a more recent version of the enumitem package, I first get a "too deeply nested" error on [attachment:categories.tex]. However, after doing

```
\setlistdepth{10}
```
(and not just depth 9), it compiles fine.

So, in other words, the problem *can* be solved. But I really wonder about the requirement that the user has to have a latex installation with a very recent enumitem. Can this be really required? Or would we be allowed to ship enumitem.sty with Sage?

What? Really? I thought I had tried that. Ah, I see, the level that
you have to put seems to actually have nothing to do with the actual
depth of your itemize. Now I can compile the full categories
documentation, but that requires `\setlistdepth{275`}!!! There
must be something wrong in the depth-counting logic of enumitem ...

I would vote for shipping enumitem.sty if that's easy. Jeroen/Volker/..., can we just throw it in
`/opt/sage-dev/local/share/texmf/tex/generic` ?

There seems to still be some compilation issue, but I guess they are just due to more stuff getting compiled, hence catching glitches that had gone unnoticed so far. I'll check this out tomorrow.

Gosh, it turned out that using `\setlistdepth{275}` was not sufficient
anymore: I had to use `\setlistdepth{2000}`! This meant the problem
would just keep going to be worst and worst with time.

So I investigated a further and got lucky this time: if we replace
list by trivlist in the customized Verbatim defined by `sphinx.sty`,
then our documenation compiles smoothly, without even using enumitem.

I proposed this fix upstream:

https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/sphinx/issue/777/latex-output-too-deeply-nested

For the time being, I tweaked our conf.py to redefine and fix sphinx's
Verbatim.

Ok, now there just remains to check that all tests pass, and this will
be a needs review.

Cheers,
                              Nicolas

Ah, that's nice: modifying standard spkgs is much simpler now that we have a single repository. Thanks!

> Although I think your pull request is based on v1.2 (but it still applied (for me) to our current v1.1). Could someone check to make sure I created the patch correctly (and tell me what I should do instead if it isn't right).


It seems to apply as it's supposed to (modulo trivial line offset).

I have made some minor improvement to the patch description.

I am a bit nervous about the removal of the former change log in SPKG.txt. But if someone can confirm that this is the right thing to do, that's ok for me.

Other than this, this sounds good to go!

Thanks again,
