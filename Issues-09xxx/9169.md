On Cygwin, the following test hangs:

```

            sage: @cached_function
            ... def oddprime_factors(n):
            ...     l = [p for p,e in factor(n) if p != 2]
            ...     return len(l)
            sage: oddprime_factors.precompute(range(1,100), 4)
```

The above is very fast on any other platform. 

This results in a doctest file failure:

```
sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/misc/cachefunc.py"                
*** *** Error: TIMED OUT! PROCESS KILLED! *** ***
*** *** Error: TIMED OUT! *** ***
 [361.6 s]

This same test still fails, though for me it is because of forking errors and an inability to start Singular at times (presumably for that reason).

Are you working on a 32-bit Windows? I've given up on attempting to use Cygwin on 32-bit systems.

Anyhow, this test works for me too. Let's close this one.
