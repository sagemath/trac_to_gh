Consider the following two notebook cells. Semantically, the input is the same in both examples. The only difference is that the second one has a line break inside a bracket.

First one prints the result of the last expression (line) in the cell:

```
(x+1)
///
x + 1
```

But the second one doesn't:

```
(x+
1)
///
```
