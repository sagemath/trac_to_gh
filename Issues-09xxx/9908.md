The parsing of Maxima's output is not good enough to handle this:

```
var('n')
sum(((2*I)^n/(n^3+1)*(1/4)^n), n, 0, infinity)
```
gives an exception

```
TypeError: unable to make sense of Maxima expression 'f[4,3]([1,1,-(sqrt(3)*I+1)/2,(sqrt(3)*I-1)/2],[2,-(sqrt(3)*I-1)/2,(sqrt(3)*I+1)/2],I/2)' in Sage
```
which is - i think - a f_43 hypergeometric function.

one additional example by omologos on irc:

```
var('x n')
f=(-1)^n/((2*n+1)*factorial(2n+1))
sum(f,n,0,oo)

This should be 

```
var('x n')
f=(-1)^n/((2*n+1)*factorial(2*n+1))
sum(f,n,0,oo)
```
If I'm not mistaken, this might be related to #2516, in the sense that we should be parsing hypergeometric functions correctly and that would be part of that ticket.

This also causes a similar problem in #4102:

```
sage: f = bessel_J(2, x)
sage: f.integrate(x)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: cannot coerce arguments: no canonical coercion from <type 'list'> to Symbolic Ring
```

In that case, Maxima is returning `hypergeometric([3/2],[5/2,3],-x^2/4)`.

#2516 has all the examples above in it, with the exception of the ones mentioned in the comments.
* One would want to be able to do

```
b=var('b')
integral(1/(x^b+1),x)
```
  without using W|A; apparently `1/(a^b+1)` would yield `2F1(1,1/a,1+1/a,-a^x)`.
* Apparently 

```
sum(x^(3*k)/factorial(2*k),k,0,oo)
```
  would also be doable with hypergeometrics.

Replying to [kcrisman](#comment%3A11):
> #2516 has all the examples above in it, with the exception of the ones mentioned in the comments.

What I get with #2516 is

```
sage: integral(1/(x^b+1),x)
integrate(1/(x^b + 1), x)
sage: sum(x^(3*k)/factorial(2*k),k,0,oo)
sqrt(pi)*x^(3/4)*sqrt(1/(pi*x^(3/2)))*cosh(x^(3/2))
```

Not really worth keeping open, as even Maxima does this.

Interestingly, this works in vanilla Sage as well.  Maybe there weren't any hg functions to begin with there.  I assume it was fixed with #16224 - earlier it gave yet another (wrong) answer.

So I nominate to close this ticket.

Even more interestingly, this is not as simple as just `cosh(x^(3/2))` (which is correct) but I'm not going to repurpose this one for that.
