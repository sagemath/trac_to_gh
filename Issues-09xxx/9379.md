Sage built on skynet/cleo (ia64-Linux-rhel) 
fails the following test when run on 
skynet/iras (ia64-Linux-suse):

./sage -t -long "devel/sage/sage/plot/plot3d/tachyon.py"

The reason is because tachyon is being
built with cc rather than gcc.

The attached mercurial patch causes tachyon 
to be built with gcc rather than cc.

It might be better to somehow use the CC environment variable!

```

flat:~ wstein$ sage -sh

Starting subshell with Sage environment variables set.
Be sure to exit when you are done and do not do anything
with other copies of Sage!

Bypassing shell configuration files ...

Yes, I would agree - using of the CC environment variable would be preferable. 

If $(CC) does not work, try ${CC}. The target does not have 'gcc' in the name, so there is no reason to hard-code gcc.

This looks good to me, and I tested the spkg to confirm it fixed the issue.

Possibly it would be a good idea to remove some more of the `"CC=..."` statements (there are *many*) from `Make-arch`, but it's hard to say for which ones it would be useful. The only ones currently used by sage that set `CC` to `cc` instead of `gcc` are `macosx` and `macosx-64`, in any case.

Is this really true?  I would like to know how using a different compiler can cause a doctest to fail.  What is the doctest error?  Maybe changing `cc` to `gcc` fixes the issue, but is that really the right fix?

Running the tachyon built with cc on cleo causes a floating point exception on startup on iras. (Even when running tachyon without parameters to get the help.)

Incidentally 'cc' is also gcc on cleo, but a different one than the gcc in the PATH.

The issue is that binaries compiled on cleo with cc contain a `.gnu.hash` ELF section (the "new" type), while the dynamic linker on iras only understands `.hash` ELF sections (the "old" type).

Compiling on cleo with cc and `-Wl,--hash-style=both` produces binaries that also work on iras.

But this is just background info, and not related to the real bug of overriding CC in tachyon's build system.

I checked that tachyon is the only package that actually calls `cc` (by placing a non-working `cc` in the path). So thats good, at least only one place to clean up.

The gcc wrapper from #10572 automatically 
1. calls gcc when cc is invoked, and
2. adds the `--hash-style=both` option.
I double checked that this allows one to build `tachyon` on cleo, copy `tachyon` to iras, and successfully doctest on iras.

Nevertheless, we should fix the Tachyon `Make-arch` to not overwrite `$CC`. Its build system is somewhat baroque, but I made changed all GNU compiler targets to not override `$CC`, `$AR`, and `$RANLIB`. All of these variables are already provided in the Sage environment. For the record, I will attach a copy of `Make-arch` to this ticket.

But while we are at it, we should update to the newest upstream package. This ticket will be resolved by #5281.

Be careful. Both Intel and Sun/Oracle produce compilers for x86 that are not called 'gcc'. On other platforms compilers can have all manner of names - aCC is one I can think of.
