You don't need to do that, i.e you can simply run `make install-data && make test-all` after copying `patches/files/get_tests` to `src/config` and configuring with some temporary installation directory.

Are you really sure it's the same bug? What happens when you compile [attachment:krasner.i] with `-O3`?

I would prefer to fix the `spkg/install` script which detects GCC versions and decides whether or not to build GCC.
