<div id="comment:2" align="right">Comment 2</div>

This is caused by:

```

readline-6.0.p1/src/doc/readline.dvi
tar: Skipping to next header
tar: Archive contains obsolescent base-64 headers

bzip2: Data integrity error when decompressing.
        Input file = (stdin), output file = (stdout)

It is possible that the compressed file(s) have become corrupted.
You can use the -tvv option to test integrity of such files.

You can use the `bzip2recover' program to attempt to recover
data from undamaged sections of corrupted files.

tar: Read 3272 bytes from spkg/standard/readline-6.0.p1.spkg
tar: Child returned status 2
tar: Error exit delayed from previous errors
```

I tried using "sage -pkg_nc" instead of "sage -pkg", which produces a non-bzip2 compressed tarball spkg.  This completely fixed the above problem.  So there is so some subtle issue with bz2 compression and tar on OS X 10.4.   Crazy.

Here is the non-bzip2'd readline spkg:

   http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/wstein/patches/readline-6.0.p1.spkg

It's 6MB instead of 2MB.  I'm just going to leave this here for the record.    I'm not proposing this be merged into sage.
