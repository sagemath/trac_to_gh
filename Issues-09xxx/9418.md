As discussed here:

http://groups.google.co.uk/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/c566520374106df3

[GNU patch](http://www.gnu.org/software/patch/) is to be added as a standard package to Sage, to allow the use of 'patch' to be used to make patches, rather than to us 'cp' as now. 

A new package may be found here

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/patch-2.5.9.spkg

In order to test this spkg, you could also try installing a new Sphinx spkg using *patch*: [http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/sphinx-1.0.4.p3.spkg](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/sphinx-1.0.4.p3.spkg) (there is a corresponding .p1 using *cp*, see #10118 for the Sphinx upgrade).

Once this is done, the [Sage Developers Guide](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/) will need to be updated to reflect a new method to create patches. A separate ticket #9419 has been opened for that.

I do not think that would be a good idea. Every time someone wants to add a patch, they would need to create one for 'deps' too. A lot of people don't know how to use that file. Note even my initial comments I noted there were several tickets touching 'deps' and these would need to be coordinated. To make matters even more complicated, the 'deps' file is not under revision control, which make s updating that file more problematic. 

If the `patch` package took a long time to build, then I could see it would slow the build of Sage, as it introduces a sometimes unnecessary dependency. But for a package which takes less than 4 seconds to build **and** run all the self tests, I think it is better to add it to 'deps' now, so every package could use it now. 

It also avoids the very real risk someone will create a patch, which will work on their system since either
* patch has already benn built.
* There's a suitable version of patch on their system.

The patch would fail to install on another computer, because patch is not built at that point in time. Since the order of building packages is not fixed. 

IMHO, `patch` should be built early, so it can be used with the minimum amount of effort.

I built it on OpenSolaris OK. There's a `make check` which I had created. 

However, the version you have now used has no test facility, so `make-check` should simply be removed. The developers must have added the facility to test on more recent versions only. 

I've created a version at 

http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/older/patch-2.5.9.spkg

which has the spkg-check file removed, and so notes to say not to update to 2.6 or 2.6.1. I will add a Mecurial patch in a minute.

I've checked the version at 

http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/older/patch-2.5.9.spkg

installs OK on 

* OpenSolaris 06/2009 (my machine hawk).
* Solaris 10 SPARC (t2.math)
* Solaris 10 x86 (fulvia on skynet)
* Linux (sage.math)  
* OS X 10.6 (bsd.math)
 
I can confirm that 2.6.1 did fail to install on Solaris 10 on SPARC (t2.math)

Should we ask Microsoft if we can make `paint` a standard spkg as well?

---

Stop environmental pollution...

We already have nice environment variables like "`R`" and "`PYTHON`"; can we rename it to e.g. `GNU_PATCH` in `spkg/install` and `spkg/standard/deps`?

---

P.S.: Why not add the `patch` spkg to `$(BASE)` (and make it depend on the previous three `$(BASE)` packages)?

As is, **all** standard spkgs will get rebuilt on an upgrade (to a version of Sage with `patch` "newly" included) anyway. (Therefore I would actually prefer adding `patch` as a dependency selectively. `spkg/standard/deps` will be under revision control soon...)
