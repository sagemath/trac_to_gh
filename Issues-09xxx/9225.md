This is an umbrella ticket for various improvements to the Sage doctesting framework.  For example:

  When we doctest several files in parallel or in sequence, it might be helpful to print stats relating to the test suite's progress, e.g.,

```sh
$ sage -t monoids/
sage -t  "monoids/monoid.py"
 1/10    1.9 s / 1.9 s
sage -t  "monoids/free_monoid.py"
 2/10    2.0 s / 3.9 s
[...]
```
  What other columns would be useful?  Coverage?

Please see the comments for more ideas.  Suggestions are welcome!

Related: #838, #4294, #7493, #8385, #9224, #9739, #10458.

Other possibilities, probably mentioned before and probably for other tickets:

* "Librarify:" Make it possible to doctest files and objects from the Sage command-line or notebook, e.g.,

```python
sage: doctest('file.sage', long=True, optional=['axiom', 'magma'])
sage: doctest(os.path.join(SAGE_ROOT, 'devel', 'sage', 'sage', 'monoids'), processes=4)
sage: stats = {}     # Collect errors, counts, timings, etc.
sage: doctest(['foo.py', 'bar.pyx'], stats=stats)
sage: def f():
....:     """
....:     sage: f()
....:     1
....:     """
....:     return 1
....: 
sage: doctest(f)
```

* Doctest the doctesting framework!  I think we could include [comment:ticket:9449:13 this example], at least.

* An option to run an individual `file.py`'s "examples" (i.e., the files `example_*` functions) in parallel.

Yes, but with the option of giving a name if one wishes to. It will make problems easier to manage if people did give a name + email, but certainly make it optional.

That's why I inserted "at least," but I should have more specific.  We'll need to upgrade to Python 2.7 to use [argparse](http://docs.python.org/library/argparse.html#module-argparse) readily.  [argparse](http://code.google.com/p/argparse/) used to be an independent project.

#10458 improves cut & paste of doctest code & output from an actual Sage session, in that it allows also "`....: `" for line continuations. (Previously, for some reason only "`...`" was supported in docstrings; also the confusion with an ellipsis intended to mean arbitrary **output** should be reduced by this ticket.)

Another problem still has to be addressed: The original (non-preparsed) source code of continuation lines gets "lost", i.e. doesn't end up in the end-of-line comments of the generated test files (`.doctest_*`) as it does for ordinary lines, hence also won't be shown on doctest errors or when one doctests in verbose mode.
