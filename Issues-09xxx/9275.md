Hi.

I was recently trying to use the Simple Sage Server API as described here:
http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/sagenb/simple/twist.html
I am using the opensuse-64bit build of Sage-4.4.

Well it didn't work (always got an error when I tried to compute
something), so I started to follow the error.

On my way I found to Bugs:

File sage.server.notebook.worksheet, Line 3497, in def preparse(self, s)
replace:   s = preparse_file(s, magic=False, do_time=True,
ignore_prompts=False)
with   :   s = preparse_file(s)
(The arguments magic and do_time do not exist in preparse_file)

File sage.server.notebook.worksheet, Line 2871, in def
start_next_comp(self) before:    input +=
'sage.server.notebook.interact.SAGE_CELL_ID=%s\n'%(C.id())
insert:    input += 'import sage.server.notebook.interact\n'
(You need to import the module before using it)

When I applied those two patches the tutorial worked out for me.

greetings,
David Poetzsch-Heffter

The simple server does not currently work at all; however, the [Sage cell server](https://github.com/sagemath/sagecell) should fit most of those needs.
