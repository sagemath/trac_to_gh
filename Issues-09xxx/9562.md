It's not passing the tests properly on 64-bit OpenSolaris, and I doubt anywhere where SAGE64 needs to be set to yes. The -m64 flag is not getting passed when running the tests, so whilst it builds a 64-bit library, it looks like it tries to create 32-bit objects and link to that 64-bit library. 

I have not investigated this in any detail, but they were my initial observations. I would try building on 't2' with SAGE64 set to yes. Not all of Sage will build 64-bit without some hacks, but it should be fairly easy to get enough of Sage built to build this library.

It passed all self-tests on 64-bit OpenSolaris (x64) and 64-bit Solaris 10 (SPARC). Since neither platform has a stable version of Sage yet, running the doctests is pointless. 

A few questions:

* Has there been an agreement to add this library? If so, can you provide a link to it. 
* Why is it not in another package, rather than added to the libm4ri package? 
* Do the self tests pass on Linux? 
* Do the doctests pass on Linux? 
* Do the self-tests pass on 32-bit SPARC?  (Note my point above about there being a 4.5.1 in /usr/local on t2)
* Do the doc tests pass on 32-bit SPARC? 
* Do the self-tests pass on OS X? 
* Do the doctests pass on OS X?

No decision on [sage-devel] has happened yet. However, the Sage developers here at Sage Days 24 seem to be in favour of adding it.

It makes maintaining the thing easier for all sides: I'm the maintainer of both libraries for both upstream and the SPKGs. It isn't even decided yet whether the two libraries might get merged in the future. Finally, William asked me to not add a new SPKG but to add the M4RIe extension to the M4RI package.

Yes.

Yes.

Note my point above about not being able to use it.

No clue.

If the packages does get positive review, there should be a note to the release manager(s) not to merge it until there has been an agreement. Though in this case, it looks like getting a vote seems a formality.

Your point above says that's probably because you have an old version. 

But I said above, there is the latest version on there - (`/usr/local/sage-4.5.1-Solaris_10_SPARC-sun4u-SunOS.tar.gz` is a pre-built copy of the latest version of Sage on 't2').  If that does not work, let me know - I'd be very surprised if it does not. Otherwise, you could just build Sage from source.

See point above.

The reason it is there is that the version of gcc shipped with Solaris is 3.4.3, so there are no recent gcc libraries. The compiler is not built with Fortran support, so there is no libgfortran at all. One needs recent run-time libraries, with fortran support, so I added them to the Sage binary. 

It may be that deleting (making a copy first) of those .la files will solve the problem. Otherwise, editing them to point at the location of the libraries in $SAGE_LOCAL/lib will almost certainly solve it. 

If that does not work, just build Sage from source. It does not take too long if you build packages in parallel.

Since there doesn't seem to be any movement on this ticket, I took the liberty to update the patch and to prepare a new SPKG:

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/malb/spkgs/libm4ri-20100817.spkg

Just as before this ticket depends on #9717 which was merged in 4.5.3.alpha1.

I successfully built and doctested the SPKG + the patch on:

* **sage.math**: 64-bit Linux, Intel CPU, pass
* **redhawk**: 64-bit Linux, AMD CPU, pass
* **bsd:** OS X, pass
* **t2**: Solaris, pass (I failed to build R thus those doctests failed)

I also took a sage-4.5.3.alpha1.tar, replaced the M4RI SPKG and applied the patch. Then I built Sage from scratch on sage.math and ran make ptestlong. All doctests passed.

PS: This new SPKG runs some tests to detect the L1 and L2 cache sizes, thus it compiles a little bit longer than older SPKGs for M4RI. The gained performance is well worth the wait on e.g. modern Intel CPUs where it is better to detect how much memory is fast for random access than to rely on the actual L2 cache size.

Whatever checks are being used to determine the cache size is not working very well. First it reports the L1 cache size is 0, then it spends a couple of minutes on a 3.33 GHz Xeon, to determine the cache size (I thought it had hanged). It's also producing some NaN in the calculation of the cache size - is that not a bug?  

The CPU is an Intel Xeon W3580 and the operating system OpenSolaris.

I disagree, it works fine as far as I know but it is slow. For your machine I'd assume that 65536:8388608 indeed gives pretty good performance. If you want to check whether this hunch is correct let me know and I can tell you how to patch and test M4RI for various cache size configurations.

That's probably because I don't know how to ask Solaris for the right information, however the tuning performed now is the better strategy anyway.

> then it spends a couple of minutes on a 3.33 GHz Xeon, to determine the cache size (I thought it had hanged). 

Tuning takes a while as described above. Some shells don't seem to print intermediate outputs, I don't know how to fix that. If you do, let me know. Also, I couldn't get reliable information if I lowered the time spent on tuning, if you have any ideas, let me know. 

> It's also producing some NaN in the calculation of the cache size - is that not a bug?  

No, the delta from the first element with respect to the previous element is not defined.

Series of failures, for all such doctests:

Is something not inheriting properly?  This method seems to be defined in Sage, and similar doctests in the rest of the matrix/ folder pass (in fact, all other tests in crypto and matrix pass other than one unrelated one from something I did on this installation).

This is the new file and class 'sage.matrix.matrix_mod2e_dense.Matrix_mod2e_dense' as indicated above.  Since the tests for `_multiply_classical` work in other files, something isn't working about the inheritance.

If I could just squeeze an extra request (not counting for review): could you tag a corresponding release of m4rie on bitbucket? That way I could make a gentoo ebuild from the bitbucket release rather than pulling the spkg.

Yeah, sorry I was a bit lazy:

1) There will be an official 20110715 release of both M4RI and M4RIE. I put together the SPKGs to test whether they work with Sage. So perhaps I shouldn't have set "needs review"

2) Yes, I gave in to the demand to split them. I should have mentioned it.

The reason is that "A*c" relies on a slow generic implementation.

I am sure that your library has a fast way to multiply a row respectively a matrix with a scalar. But you should overload `_lmul_` (please not `_rmul_`, according to the documentation), so that the user can benefit from it.

No. When I tried first, I simply did `qpush` after the qimport, and `sage -br`, but found that `_lmul_` was missing.

When one qimports a patch, then it is stored in the folder `.hg/patches`. When one qdeletes it, it is also removed from the folder.

And when I qimported your new patch, a file with the given patch name was created in `.hg/patches`, but that file did *not* contain the string "lmul".

That never happened to me before today.

The timings have clearly improved:

```
sage: MS = MatrixSpace(GF(64,'a'),5000,5000)
sage: K = MS.base_ring()
sage: c = K.random_element()
sage: A = MS.random_element()
sage: %time A*c
CPU times: user 0.68 s, sys: 0.02 s, total: 0.70 s

sage: B = MS1.random_element()
sage: %timeit B*c
625 loops, best of 3: 88.3 µs per loop
```

That is good enough, I'd say.

Or perhaps not. The new polybori spkg from #11261 is installed, and so is the new M4RI spkg and the corresponding patches.

I have to leave office now. But it seems that either #11574 or this ticket are causing the problem.

<a id='comment:88'>Comment 88:</a>
Finally, the tests on 32 bit solaris (mark on skynet) are finshed. They passed, modulo the usual timeouts. The long tests pass on my machine. If I understand the discussion above, it builds on 64 bit solaris and on Cygwin as well, and of course on linux and os x.

Moreover, it provides a very impressive speedup compared with old Sage matrices over GF(2<sup>e</sup>). If I am not mistaken, it is even faster than Magma.

So, it is almost a positive review.

But there remain a few things to do.

1. David Kirkby noted that we are adding a new standard spkg here. So, there should be a voting on sage-devel. So, that's "needs info".

2. I found some issues with the "randomize" methods. 

   i) The randomize method in sage/libs/ntl/ntl_mat_GF2E.pyx is not documented (thus, also has no tests), and it lacks the usual optional arguments `density` and `nonzero`.

   ii) The doc of Matrix_mod2e_dense.randomize gives no use cases for the optional arguments. Actually, the behaviour when passing the optional arguments is clearly not what we want:

  ```
  sage: MS = MatrixSpace(GF(64,'a'),100,100)
  sage: A = MS.random_element(densitiy=0.3)
  sage: A.density()
  4913/5000
  sage: B = MS.random_element(nonzero=True)
  sage: B.density()
  2469/2500
  sage: C = MS.random_element(nonzero=True, density=1)
  sage: C.density()
  2461/2500
  sage: D = MS.random_element(density=0)
  sage: D.density()
  983/1000
   ```

3. The doc of many methods needs some polishing.

   * It would be nice to have a reference to research articles. I had never heard of Travolta tables before. Strassen-Winograd and Karatsuba may be better known, but still, a reference could help.

   * _matrix_times_matrix is not documented.

   * `__init__`, `__cinit__` do not specify their arguments.

   * `_lmul_`, `__neg__`, `__richcmp__`, `__invert__`, `__reduce__`, `set_unsafe` and `get_unsafe` do not state what they do, and the method names do not occur in the example (so, it should be marked as an indirect doctest). 

   * cdef'd methods such as rescale_row_c or add_multiple_of_row_c or swap_rows_c and so on may not be as easily visible by the user than Python methods. However, as a courtesy to developers who actually read the source file, the arguments of those methods should be specified.

   * "echelonize" should state what it does and what its optional arguments are. If I am not mistaken, it changes the matrix inplace, and that should be documented.

   * When I read "Classical cubic matrix multiplication.", I first understood that the matrix is cubic. But perhaps I'm a bit square here...
 
So, that's "needs work" for now.

Since there should be a vote on sage-devel anyway, we might also ask whether it should be included in the docs. I am still not sure: On the one hand, I think a reference manual should be thorough. On the other hand, all "new" methods that are no cdef'd methods and do not start with an underscore overwrite methods from super-classes that are documented elsewhere.

P.S.: This would perhaps even allow specifying cache sizes manually, though the proper way would be something like

```sh
$ export M4RI_EXTRA_OPTS="--L1-cache-size=32 --L2-cache-size=1024" # passed to M4RI[E]'s 'configure'
$ sage -i m4rie
```
(And similar options for other cache parameters like the cache line sizes.)

Specifying these may at least *speed up* the tuning (by omitting a lot of tries); don't know if you could skip tuning, given these, in whole.

Storing and using tuning parameters analoguous to GMP's `gmp-mparams.h` (including defaults for a couple of platforms / processors) wouldn't be bad either; then [optionally] bypassing self-tuning would really make sense.

[Disclaimer: Haven't looked at the spkg at all, so there might be better or other ways to achieve this.]

Looks like you're currently not trying to query any of

```C
    _SC_LEVEL1_ICACHE_SIZE
    _SC_LEVEL1_ICACHE_ASSOC
    _SC_LEVEL1_ICACHE_LINESIZE
    _SC_LEVEL1_DCACHE_SIZE
    _SC_LEVEL1_DCACHE_ASSOC
    _SC_LEVEL1_DCACHE_LINESIZE
    _SC_LEVEL2_CACHE_SIZE
    _SC_LEVEL2_CACHE_ASSOC
    _SC_LEVEL2_CACHE_LINESIZE
    _SC_LEVEL3_CACHE_SIZE
    _SC_LEVEL3_CACHE_ASSOC
    _SC_LEVEL3_CACHE_LINESIZE
    _SC_LEVEL4_CACHE_SIZE
    _SC_LEVEL4_CACHE_ASSOC
    _SC_LEVEL4_CACHE_LINESIZE
```
(with `sysconf()`). At least some of these values aren't available on every platform, but if they are, you could perhaps use them.

AFAIK you'd have to set some feature test macro before including `unistd.h` on Solaris, although I doubt it supports any of the above.

There is no research article on Travolta tables yet since I made them up for M4RIE. But for the other ones I can add references.

This is an internal method which is part of the standard matrix interface. I'd say it is hence understood what it does.

Okay.

These are special methods where either Python or our Matrix classes define what they do. I'd say it is hence understood what they do.

I'd much rather add a note to the reference manual which lists which library drives which base field?

The updated patch + updated SPKG should address the comments above. Simon, as an added bonus the new SPKG also contains the faster scalar product.

I did `sage -f http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/malb/spkgs/libm4rie-20110821.spkg`, I removed the old version of `m4rie_for_sage.patch`, qimported the new one, checked that my computer was really downloading the new version, did qpush, and `sage -br`.

However, I get

```
sage: MS = MatrixSpace(GF(64,'a'),800,800)
sage: A = MS.random_element(densitiy=1)
sage: RR(A.density())
0.984492187500000
sage: A = MS.random_element(densitiy=0.001)
sage: RR(A.density())
0.984167187500000
```
I verified (by `A.randomize?`) that the new patch is applied.

Do you have any clue why that happened?

So, perhaps `MS.random_element(...)` is calling `randomize(...)` in a wrong way.

* spkg-check does not seem to work. After opening the package and working in a sage shell, I get

```
$ ./spkg-check 
./spkg-check: Zeile 30: cd: build/m4ri: Datei oder Verzeichnis nicht gefunden
Testing the M4RI library
make: *** Keine Regel, um »check« zu erstellen.  Schluss.
Error testing M4RI
```

* Have you already implemented the ideas for storing the cache size information, so that installation of the package does not take so long? Or will that be in a future release?

* You said you'd much rather add a note to the reference manual which lists which library drives which base field. Did you do so? I can not find it in the patch.

__Done__

* The long doctests in doc/ and sage/ pass on my machine. The doctests in sage/matrix pass on 32 bit solaris.

* Randomize seems to work fine.

* Scalar multiplication has improved:

```

sage: MS = MatrixSpace(GF(64,'a'),5000,5000)
sage: K = MS.base_ring()
sage: c = K.random_element()
sage: A = MS.random_element()
sage: %time A*c
CPU times: user 0.05 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 0.06 s
Wall time: 0.06 s
5000 x 5000 dense matrix over Finite Field in a of size 2^6
sage: MS1 = MatrixSpace(GF(64,'a'),1,5000)
sage: B = MS1.random_element()
sage: %timeit B*c
625 loops, best of 3: 51.5 µs per loop
```

* The docs are now almost fine from my point of view. We only have

and I suggest that I add a referee patch that simply adds a "indirect doctest" in the appropriate places.

__Conclusion__

I put it "needs work", but that's only since I'd like to create a referee patch. If you did not add the information on which library drives which base field yet, I can do so as well.

Please check in the changes to the hg repository, or "hg ignore" them. Please fix the self tests (or tell me why my attempt to call spkg-check did not work).

I guess you'll first have to build, which also creates the directory and the Makefile there.

Did you try `env SAGE_CHECK=yes sage -f ...`?

If you've run `sage -i` also with `-s`, entering the build directory and doing `./spkg-check` should also work.

I'm not so sure about this. They are fairly independent. I suggest each is reviewed independently and whichever gets in later is re-based accordingly.

I'd say M4RIE:
* the M4RIE interface has been around for months and months
* I'm willing to debug any issue that might come up because I'm quite invested in this ticket.
* Many people have looked at M4RIE over the time.
* The LinBox switch-over has not received a single review yet.
* You reported some speed issues with the new LinBox interface
* It is unclearly whether the new LinBox interface works/builds on anything besides 64-bit Linux.

This clearly needs work since M4RIE does not add the appropriate -msse2 flag if M4RI was built with it.

I've released a new version of M4RIE, 

cf. https://bitbucket.org/malb/m4rie/wiki/M4RIE-20111004

which fixes bugs, deals with M4RI SSE2 flags correctly, implements asymptotically fast Gaussian elimination and triangular system solving, has a new Travolta table creation which is much much faster ...

The attached patch also takes care of any work issues I am aware of.

I've tested this code (patch + SPKG) on cicero, sage.math, bsd. I'm currently testing on iras.

It seems to me that all previous complaints are addressed in the new spkg and patches.

In particular, if one has opened the spkg, starts a sage shell and does ./spkg-install, then ./spkg-check works, with all tests. passing.

hg status in the spkg is fine, and SPKG.txt looks fine as well (except a typo in the last line, should be "split from", not "split form" - but please leave that error, since the Gods don't like perfection among the mortals :)

Moreover, `sage -coverage sage/matrix/matrix_mod2e_dense.pyx` is OK.

All doc tests pass as well, and I think the original problems with t2 had been dealt with.

Thus, I hope all participants agree that it is a positive review!
