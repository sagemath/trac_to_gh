A couple of comments:

1. Why is modular_decomposition.c included in the patch?

2. The comment at the top of modular_decomposition.pyx indicates it is a copy of code, but is it rather a Cython interface to C code?

3. It wouldn't hurt to give a very brief explanation of what a modular decomposition of a graph is in the docstrings

Hello !

1. Because I wasn't paying attention

2. I mean by this that the lines of the code building the graph according to the format used in the .c file, along with the ones reading the decomposition once it is computed, can be found in the .c files too. I copied those and Cythonized them, but the "real" code is still contained in the .c file.

3. Indeed.

4. I think so, too ! Especially in C, and in mlog(n) :-)

I will update the patch once the software is "officially" GPL2, which could mean next week.
