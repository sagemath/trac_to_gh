When trying to get some timings for #7795, I did

```
sage: R.<x,y,z> = QQ[]
sage: p = R.random_element()
sage: p
-x^2 + 1/3*x*y + 7/2*y + 2*z
sage: timeit('q=p^(2^10)')
```
which might be stupid. 

Anyway, it was impossible to interrupt the computation with ctrl-C, which I think is a bug.

<div id="comment:3" align="right">Comment 3</div>

The problem is the following:

When an interrupt is caught, the program acts as if `_sig_on` returns the value 0.  So, when using `_sig_on`, functions should be declared `except 0` and not `except -1`, which is what the Singular functions do.

The attached patch is purely proof-of-concept showing some improvement (but it doesn't fully fix the problem).
