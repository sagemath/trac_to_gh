In install.log, we often see:

```
drkirkby@hawk:~/f/sage-4.5.alpha3$ grep sage-banner install.log
grep: can't open /export/home/drkirkby/f/sage-4.5.alpha3/local/bin/sage-banner
grep: can't open /export/home/drkirkby/f/sage-4.5.alpha3/local/bin/sage-banner
grep: can't open /export/home/drkirkby/f/sage-4.5.alpha3/local/bin/sage-banner
grep: can't open /export/home/drkirkby/f/sage-4.5.alpha3/local/bin/sage-banner
sage_scripts-4.5.alpha3/.hg/store/data/sage-banner.i
sage_scripts-4.5.alpha3/sage-banner
drkirkby@hawk:~/f/sage-4.5.alpha3$ 
```

I think this is probably due to some code in sage-sage

```
if [ "$1" = '-v' -o "$1" = '-version' -o "$1" = '--version' ]; then
    cat "$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage-banner" | grep -i "version" | sed "s/\| //" | sed "s/ *\|//"
    exit $?
fi
```

This will obviously fail if sage-banner does not exist. 

Also
* There is an useless use of 'cat'. Perhaps the author was hoping to get a [Useless Use of Cat Award](http://partmaps.org/era/unix/award.html) (Well worth a read - it's both funny and educational.) 
* There is an an unnecessary use of double-quotes around 'version'. 

The following will save a few bytes of disk space and a few CPU cycles, as it will invoke one less process. 

```
    grep -i version "$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage-banner" | sed "s/\| //" | sed "s/ *\|//"
```

More importantly, we should check that sage-banner exists before doing this, so it does not produce potentially confusing error messages.

Well, reading carefully, your error messages can't come from `sage-sage`... (I know you haven't had much sleep... ;-) )

Btw, there are more superfluous quotes.

If you want to save another "redundant" process invocation (there are in general many), at the expense of losing some parallelism, substitute

```
... | sed "s/\| //" | sed "s/ *\|//"
```
by

```
... | sed -e "s/\| //" -e "s/ *\|//"
```

(The whole line could be replaced by a single invocation of `sed`.)

Just for the record:

Hi leif
* I was not aware of that shorter sed sequence. I just found the 'cat' a bit amuzing. 
* Yes, there are loads of unneeded quotes in this bit of Sage. 
* Interesting that you don't see this error message - I'm not the only one that gets it. I forget who posted the log with this, and commented on it, but someone did. 

I'll have to look at this, but its not exactly the most serious Sage bug.

Yes, though I love cats. One of my favorites is:

```sh
sed -n "/[Vv]ersion/s/ *| *//gp" $SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage-banner
```
(Spaces in `$SAGE_LOCAL` are forbidden, otherwise we'd need quotes there.)

Note that the original version gives two lines for non-finals; it does **not** remove the vertical bars (nor the whitespace) because the pipe symbol is "superfluously" escaped: :)

```sh
leif64@portland:~/Sage/sage-4.5.alpha4-serial$ ./sage -v
| Sage Version 4.5.alpha4, Release Date: 2010-07-06                  |
* Warning: this is a prerelease version, and it may be unstable.     *
```

More important, the discussion is still somewhat off-topic or off-ticket, since - as mentioned - the error messages do not originate from `sage-sage`, so the issue has to be fixed elsewhere.

> I'll have to look at this, but its not exactly the most serious Sage bug.

Obviously, I agree.

Since sage-spkg is in spkg/base and in sage_scripts, while sage-banner is only in sage_scripts, you should see this message for any spkgs installed before sage-scripts.  In the most recent version of Sage, deps should install sage_scripts right at the beginning:

```
BASE = $(INST)/$(PREREQ) $(INST)/$(DIR) $(INST)/$(SAGE_BZIP2)

# Also install scripts before we continue with other spkgs
BASE += $(INST)/$(SAGE_SCRIPTS)
```
So I hope this problem has already been taken care of.  Installing sage_scripts itself looks like the only possible problem.

Here's an attempt at fixing this.  Three comments: 

- It stores the current Sage version in SAGE_ROOT/VERSION.txt, as suggested by Leif -- see #9922.
- Right now, upgrading just adds the new version to the top, with "Updated from" and then the old version, so if you've somehow managed to update 6 times, the file will have 7 lines in it, recording the full update history.
- It uses cat.  Sorry, Dave.

Hmmm, besides I don't like the date format string (which is *local* time), I don't think `$SAGE_RELEASE_DATE` is available (i.e. set) in `sage-upgrade`.

Do you intentionally export `OLD_VERSION`?

A non-existing `$SAGE_ROOT/VERSION.txt` could be handled as well.

I'd prefer having *"Sage version: ... [Last] Upgraded from: ..."* on a single line (at least in the log).

I can see from your other reasons that we need to update the version number earlier so my solution won't work, but I see no reason, a priori, not to call `sage` in `sage-upgrade`, after the upgrade process has completed, apparently successfully.  It actually tests further whether the upgrade succeeded.

> Also, `sage-spkg` is run before `sage-upgrade` updates `VERSION.txt`, so (just) the old version would be logged. (I consider the files in `spkg/installed/` also logs, though they have no `.log` extension.)

That makes sense.

> Rather than omitting `VERSION.txt` from the `sage_scripts` spkg, I would put the code to update (or better: not overwrite) an existing `VERSION.txt` in its `spkg-install`.

Why?  In general, copying over all *.txt files is a little dangerous, and is part of the reason that the file sage-README-osx.txt appears in the wrong places and isn't currently tracked in any repo.  I think if we want to include a file, it should be tracked.  If it's automatically generated, I don't see any reason to include it in a repo.  If #9433 ever gets reviewed and merged, then all of the *.txt files in SAGE_ROOT will be taken out of the scripts repo in any case.

Right.

> We'd have to extract the new version from some newly downloaded file. (This only works for later Sage versions anyway, unless we handle it in `spkg/install`, too.)

How about extracting it from VERSION.txt?  I'm attaching a patch which does this, perhaps not in the optimal way, but I think it should work.

`sage-upgrade` isn't "the end" of the upgrade process (it's called by `sage-sage`),
and calling the "new" Sage there can potentially cause more trouble than we want. So since it's not necessary, I would leave it.

This is done later, and finally calling the new Sage should be up to the user, e.g. indirectly by building the documentation.

I didn't say copy `*.txt` (otherwise checking the presence of an existing `$SAGE_ROOT/VERSION.txt` wouldn't make much sense). But having it there (*not* in the repo, i.e., in `.hgignore`) we can easily extract it before that spkg gets installed, because a new scripts repo is always there, is relatively small and gets created by `sage -sdist` anyway, where the new version and release date are known.

See above.

Well, `VERSION.txt` shouldn't be under revision control.

Extracting the file from the file itself? You misunderstood me. I meant we could extract `VERSION.txt` e.g. from the scripts repo, with `tar`.

I'll take a look at it.

Although I'm aware of the [ISO 8601](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) date format, for humans to read, having the month (Jan, Feb etc) and day (Mon, Tue etc) is useful. It's obvious that 2001 is the year, but things like 2010-05-06 are not so good for human readability. Is that the the 5th of June or the 6th of May? It's more confusing, as different parts of the world use different order for the month and day. 

One other thing, that I'll mention though this is perhaps not the best ticket for it, is  #8447, which was a suggestion of mine to detect when the Sage version is old.

BTW John, I've nothing against the use of `cat` as sometimes it is needed, but things like 

`cat filename | grep foobar`

are a bit silly when 

`grep foobar filename`

will work, is shorter, and does not create an extra process. 

I've got to submit a job application today, so doing lots with Sage is not on my priority list today. Hence I wont be reviewing things for the rest of the day.

Detecting such is easier with the date format we have. ;-)

But I'm strongly against nagging or annoying users, especially since the default is to print the Sage banner when Sage starts up, which shows the release date.

If we nagged users their version of Sage was very old, we would not have the problems there are with the Debian distribution, and some other distributions of Sage. I think more than a year old and you do seriously need to nag them!

Where?  sage-upgrade gets called twice in sage-sage, but that's basically all that happens when you run "sage -upgrade", isn't it?  I guess running it twice means that VERSION.txt may end up being wrong; I'll have to fix that.

VERSION.txt is written to SAGE_ROOT by sage-sdist, so it's present in the Sage tarball.  It will therefore also be available in the upgrade path.

Although we can't get the release date from it, we could also use the *file name* for the main Sage repo, for example.

(See above: the file VERSION.txt gets written to SAGE_ROOT by sage-sdist, so it will be there.)

> The code is a *bit* complicated though.

It's straightforward, but long: first you extract the old version from VERSION.txt, then you download the new VERSION.txt and extract the new version, then you produce the updated VERSION.txt.  I need to check whether the new version matches the beginning of the old version, in case this is the second time sage-upgrade is run.  

Finally, I think having "UTC" at the end of the date looks a little silly when it's just a date, no time, but I've included it.

Here's a new patch.

(The "try ... except" block is probably not necessary except on Windows, but it feels safer this way, and who knows, we might eventually support Windows.)

I've created two upgrade paths which include this (one, version "V0", to test upgrading from anything else to this, and then the second, version "V1", to try upgrading from version "V0"):

- [http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/palmieri/misc/sage-4.6.1.V0/](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/palmieri/misc/sage-4.6.1.V0/)
- [http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/palmieri/misc/sage-4.6.1.V1/](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/palmieri/misc/sage-4.6.1.V1/)

We can open up a new ticket with a formally attached patch if this seems like the right approach.  I won't have much time to work on this, though: I have to focus on grading exams and getting ready for next quarter's classes.

3) I would copy using `cp -p`.

Okay.

Good idea.

I'm attaching two patches, one of which just fixes these issues.  The other patch, which could be applied on top of the others, does a little miscellaneous clean-up in sage-update, using `os.path.join(x,y)` instead of `"%s/%s" %(x,y)`.  Feel free to ignore the second patch completely; it is entirely optional right now.
