To build ECL with `SAGE_PARALLEL_SPKG_BUILD="yes"` on Mac OS X, we need to add, e.g.,

```sh
MAKEFLAGS=
export MAKEFLAGS
```
to the package's `spkg-install`.

Please see #8306 about building spkgs in parallel.  For `MAKEFLAGS`, see [the GNU Make manual](http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Options_002fRecursion.html).

Here's a new spkg based on #9474:

 http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mpatel/trac/9187/ecl-10.2.1.p1.spkg

It works for me with 4.5.rc0 + #7379 on sage.math, but I have not yet had a chance to test it on bsd.math.

I think you test results will be very useful, as there is a distinct lack of direct evidence for this working on Linux. There is evidence it is working on OS X and Solaris. 

You also need to export MAKE, with something like

$ export MAKE="make -j6"

or however many threads you want. Do not put a space between the 'j' and the '6'.

That's odd, since Sage's Boehm GC includes a patch for MacOS X 10.6.

I agree we should open a *new* ticket for that and perhaps include a p2 spkg in 4.5.rc2(?), 4.5.final or 4.5.1.

The package has to be cleaned up anyway, and perhaps we switch back to ECL 10.**4**.1.

Please open a ticket and make a p2 with only these changes. I think it's too late for 4.5.

Ticket up at #9493.
