To build ECL with `SAGE_PARALLEL_SPKG_BUILD="yes"` on Mac OS X, we need to add, e.g.,

```sh
MAKEFLAGS=
export MAKEFLAGS
```
to the package's `spkg-install`.

Please see #8306 about building spkgs in parallel.  For `MAKEFLAGS`, see [the GNU Make manual](http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Options_002fRecursion.html).

I've put a new spkg at

(Or should it be p1?)  This is based against the package mentioned in [comment:ticket:8951:10 this comment] at #8951.

Unfortunately, there are two spkgs on #8951 and neither have the patches from #8089 and both claim in SPKG.txt to have things they do not. 

I intend creating a 10.4.1 package which has this, and all other relevant fixes in the one package. Since no ecl-10.4.1.spkg has been merged, this should be called ecl-10.4.1.spkg. The patch levels start at 0, not 1, but in this case as nothing has been merged, there is no need to increment the patch level. 

Please see #9264, which will have these changes, those which are listed as being in #8591 but are not, and also that at #8089

There is evidence it is working on OS X and Solaris. \n\nYou also need to export MAKE, with something like\n\n$ export MAKE=\"make -j6\"\n\nor however many threads you want.

I think you test results will be very useful, as there is a distinct lack of direct evidence for this working on Linux. There is evidence it is working on OS X and Solaris. 

You also need to export MAKE, with something like

$ export MAKE="make -j6"

or however many threads you want. Do not put a space between the 'j' and the '6'.

John, 

I'm not sure if you mis-understood me there. 

`$ export MAKE="make -j 10"`

will not work as well as it could do. The .spkg's will build in parallel, but when it gets to building the Sage library, that will only build serially. You should use 

`$ export MAKE="make -j10"`

I assume you are aware you also need a library patch

http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/raw-attachment/ticket/7379/trac-7379-decorator-defaults.patch

(only the library patch, not the sagenb patch on that ticket). Only part of #7379 got merged into 4.5.rc0

I think this ecl-10.2.1.p1.spkg can be merged into rc1, but could you MacOS X testers check which version of Boehm GC is used during install (i.e., the one shipped with Sage or the one included in ECL)?

```sh
$ grep -i boehm spkg/logs/ecl-10.2.1.p1.log | head -n 2
```
should show soemthing like

```
checking whether we can use the existing Boehm-Weiser library ... yes
checking if we need to copy GC private headers ... checking if we use Boehm-Demers-Weiser precise garbage collector... yes
```
or

```
checking if we use Boehm-Demers-Weiser precise garbage collector... yes
configure: Configuring included Boehm GC library:
```
(The latter is from Dave's install log on bsd.math/MacOS X 10.4.0.)

On my OS X box, it says:

I'm not an expert in these things, but in src/src/configure, it says:

which leads me to believe that on OS X, it will be a little work to use Sage's installation of boehm_gc.  I think this should go on a follow-up ticket, and it should probably be done in coordination with the ecl people.

That's odd, since Sage's Boehm GC includes a patch for MacOS X 10.6.

I agree we should open a *new* ticket for that and perhaps include a p2 spkg in 4.5.rc2(?), 4.5.final or 4.5.1.

The package has to be cleaned up anyway, and perhaps we switch back to ECL 10.**4**.1.

Please open a ticket and make a p2 with only these changes. I think it's too late for 4.5.

Ticket up at #9493.

I unfortunately cannot upload an spkg because I don't have an account on sage.math.

(Perhaps I'll ask again someone to upload it from an e-mail attachment, but it's still fairly large.)
