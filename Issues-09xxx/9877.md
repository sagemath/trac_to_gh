```
Add 3 methods to `sage/combinat/words/finite_word.py`:

1. sturmian_desubstitute_as_possible
2. is_sturmian_factor
3. is_tangent

Add a protecting `is_tangent` method to `sage/combinat/words/paths.py`.

```
sage: w = Word('01110110110111011101',alphabet='01')
sage: w.is_tangent()                  
True
```
Depends on #8739.

I'm testing your patch in the next two hours. Before testing it explicitly, just some comments:

1. Could you add a reference where one can find the proof that a word is finite sturmian if and only if you can desubstitute it to the empy word?
2. As I told you when you were in Montreal, I think I prefer the name `is_finite_sturmian` (or just `is_sturmian`) over the name  `is_sturmian_factor`. I feel that the last one implies an argument like in `w.is_sturmian_factor(u)` and it seems to be used in many articles (just googling it, you find a big list).
3. Not very important, but there are two comment `# print <something>` that should be removed from the code in the function `is_sturmian_factor`.

I'm waiting for sage-combinat to install and I'll test and look more thoroughly at your code.

There is another problem with your function:

I think this shouldn't be the case. In fact, this is interesting, because it raises another problem I had when working on another patch. What I suggest is that you could first verify if the parent has size 2 and, if it's not the case, you check if its *real* alphabet has size 2 by using the expression

I think the clean solution would be to replace the deprecated function `alphabet()` by a new one that would compute the *real alphabet* in question, so that there would be two kinds of alphabet:

1. The one corresponding to the parent of the word (for instance `aaab` might be a word defined on the alphabet `{a,b,c}`).
2. The one corresponding to the alphabet realized by the word `Alph(aaab) = {a,b}`

The first one is called by `w.parent().alphabet()` while the second one would be obtained from `w.alphabet()`. But this is for another ticket.

What I suggest is that you simply add the `len(set(w)) == 2` condition to your code and we'll clean it eventually.

Since it is explained in the documentation, this is not a bug but a feature ;)

I was thinking about this alphabet problem, and i am willing to write a ticket about that issue. I think that such a decision should be made for the whole word directory, with its whole community. Here are some bits.

If i start to do such tests in such a method, then almost every method of the FiniteWords class will have to do it as well, and the faster parent().alphabet() method will become useless. So there is a problem of code replication.

Another problem is that a test like `len(set(w)) == 2` takes probably a linear time whereas `size_of_alphabet` is just looking into the parent, which is constant time. 

Some programmer (user) should know where his/her words are living and should be warned if not. Making "friendly code" does not mean to pass over dirty programmer's inconsistencies, because then it won't detect the clean programmer's mistakes anymore. Fore those lazy ways of programming, we can imagine a global option which tells how the methods should care about the alphabet, so that both kinds of behavior are possible.

As for me, this may look Bourbachist (in particular not `bash`-ist ;), but i would like the empty word defined on a 2-letter alphabet to be recognized as a factor of a Sturmian word and not necessarily the empty word defined on a three letter alphabet (or at least to be warned if i do so). This may be, a contrario, an argument to make a difference between `is_sturmian_factor` (or `is_finite_sturmian`) and `is_balanced(1)`.


If in some very few occasion, the user will indeed need to use such a method on some words defined on some non-two-letter alphabet, but then there should be some general coerce methods like `redefine_alphabet` or `minimize_alphabet_to_actually_used_letters` that s-he can use in his/her code.

Another example of why the alphabet question deals with the whole `word` directory, and why there should be an overall policy is the following:

```
sage: words.LowerMechanicalWord(1/sqrt(2)).parent()
Words
sage: words.CharacteristicSturmianWord(1/sqrt(2)).parent()
Words over Ordered Alphabet [0, 1]
```

Hi, Thierry !

Sorry if I haven't been available lately (busy, you know, the usual justification...).

If I'm not mistaken, there were last minor issues with your ticket that haven't been completely solved. To recap:

1. Cleaning some commented code.
2. Adding the `len(set(w)) == 2` condition. I understand your point of view that this should be done by many other functions in Sage, but for now, it will be cleaner if we do so.
3. Finally, I agree with you about keeping the name `is_sturmian_factor`.
4. Providing a reference for the theorem that desubstituting as possible to the empty word is equivalent to being Sturmian.
 
This is pretty much it!

Hi Alexandre,

i started to work back on this ticket. This new patch is supposed to solve your four points. 

Since the `is_tangent()` method can now be applied to a word with more than 2 letters, i added a protection in the `FiniteWordPath_all` class into the file `paths.py` so that `is_tangent()` could not be applied for such word paths. Indeed, there is an extended definition for them, which is not yet written (see the paper).

Also, concerning a previous comment on using existing sage code, i looked for some "run" method and the only similar code i found was the `_delta_iterator()` method in the `Word_class` class. I tried to use it, but it seems that the use of the `groupby` itertool followed by `len` makes a slower code:

```
from itertools import groupby

def runs_groupby(self):
    for letter, run in groupby(self):
        yield letter, len(list(run))

def runs_homemade(self):
    try:
        previous_letter = self[0]
    except IndexError:
        return
    current_run_length = 0
    for i in self:
        if i == previous_letter:
            current_run_length += 1
        else:
            yield previous_letter , current_run_length
            current_run_length = 1
            previous_letter = i
    yield previous_letter , current_run_length

timeit('for i in runs_groupby(words.FibonacciWord()[:1000]):\n    print i')

timeit('for i in runs_homemade(words.FibonacciWord()[:1000]):\n    print i')

```

The first takes 28.6 ms per loop whereas the second takes 18.2 ms per loop. The problem is that the first method, though more low-level, is like passing twice on the word, which seems to be slower than the second (high-level) one-pass method.

Ciao,
Thierry

Salut Thierry,

1.

> Since the `is_tangent()` method can now be applied to a word with more than 2 letters, i added a protection in the `FiniteWordPath_all` class into the file `paths.py` so that `is_tangent()` could not be applied for such word paths. Indeed, there is an extended definition for them, which is not yet written (see the paper).

Why? Can you explain more? I don't think the protection is needed.

2. 

The patch is having the following lines::

```
w_isolated = W(l_isolated,datatype='letter') #the word associated to the isolated letter
w_running = W(l_running,datatype='letter') #the word associated to the running letter
```

I remember I suggested you to use datatype = 'letter'. But I realized today that this was supported only for the old sage words objects saved in the pickle jar. So, by introducing it now in this patch, we would have to keep it. So we need to make a decision if we keep it or not. If we don't keep it, you can do the following instead:

```
w_isolated = W([l_isolated]) #the word associated to the isolated letter
w_running = W([l_running]) #the word associated to the running letter
```

3. I think we should redefine the function alphabet for finite words and return the letter occuring in the word and caching the result (I can post a patch for this). And so, the function `is_tangent` could look if this method return a two letter alphabet when the parent don't.

Hello,

Some comments to motivate the author of the patch.

1) The problem with datatype=letter may be fixed by the following. At the begining of the function, create a dictionnary "word_from_letter" with keys the two letters and values as words of length 1. It is the best way to do as a call to the parent for the creation of an object is always time consuming. With that done, all tests pass on sage-5.0.beta7.

2) It would be nice to put a "reverse engineering" example (random or not) as follows:

```
sage: s1 = WordMorphism('a->ab,b->b')
sage: s2 = WordMorphism('a->ba,b->b')
sage: s3 = WordMorphism('a->a,b->ba')
sage: s4 = WordMorphism('a->a,b->ab')
sage: W=Words('ab')
sage: w=W('ab')
sage: for i in xrange(8): w = choice([s1,s2,s3,s4])(w)   
sage: w
word: aabaaabaabaaabaabaabaaabaabaabaaabaabaaa...
sage: w.is_sturmian_factor()
True
```

3) There is still the doctest problem mentionned in comment: 17

It would be great to have this patch integrated in sage-5.0!

* line 5179: "desubstitution consist" -> "desubstitution consists"
* lines 5190, 5340, 5419: self is **not** a part of the input
* is_tangent doc: the word tangent, where it is defined, must be bold (put the word between two *). The definition is not very english, I suggest: A binary word is said to be *tangent* if it can appear in infintely many cutting sequences of a smooth curve, where each cutting sequence is observed on a progressively smaller grid.

Best,
