The attached patch allows customization of printing of elements in the class `CombinatorialFreeModuleElement`.  It also adds documentation to `CombinatorialFreeModule` spelling out these options (and all of the other options, I think).

Apply only trac_9370-module-elt-repr-all-in-one.patch.

Hello John,

I like your ideas. I have a few quick comments for you now.

Comments on the docstring for `CombinatorialFreeModule`:

```                                                                             
    - ``basis_keys`` - list, tuple, family, set, etc. defining the 
      basis of this module
```
basis_keys provides the indexing set for the basis, not the basis itself.
 

```
    - ``element_class`` - the class of which elements of this module
      should be instances (optional, default None)
```
I understand that the default argument is None, but it would be nice to
have a description of the class used in that case since elements are not 
instances of None.
 

```
    - ``prefix`` - prefix used for printing elements of this module
      (optional, default 'B').  With the default, a monomial indexed
      by 'a' would be printed as ``B['a']``.
 
    - ``latex_prefix`` - prefix used in the LaTeX representation of
      elements (optional, default same as 'prefix').  With the 
      default, a monomial indexed by 'a' would be printed as
      ``B_{a}``.  If this is the empty string, then don't print
      monomials as subscripts: the monomial indexed by 'a' would be
      printed as ``a``, or as ``[a]`` if ``latex_bracket`` is True.
```
It doesn't say here, but it seems that prefix and latex_prefix are supposed
to be strings. Or anything that concatenates with a string (for example, I
think any instance of LatexExpr will work).
 

```
    - ``repr_bracket`` - whether to print a bracket when printing
      elements (optional, default True).  If it is one of "[", "(", or
      "{", use it and its partner as brackets.  If this is any other
      string, use it as both brackets.
```
Please describe what bracket gets used with the default option. Also, the 
code sets the default to None, not True.

And perhaps a method called print_options might be useful (instead of pointing the user to an "internal" attribute). With no arguments, it will return _print_options and otherwise it will set the appropriate option. For example,

```
sage: A.print_options(repr_bracket="|") # to change repr_bracket
```
What do you think?

I've documented that they should be strings.  It's true that a `LatexExpr` will work, but I don't think we need to spell that out.

I've expanded on the explanation here.

Good idea, I've implemented this.

```
sage: F = CombinatorialFreeModule(QQ, [1,2,3], prefix='x', repr_bracket=["_{", "}"])

Hi John,

Sorry for letting this patch rot ... I like it much though! Thanks! As you, I am bothered by the current interaction between unique representation and printing customization, but don't have a good solution at this point.

I just went briefly through it. Three minor suggestions:
- The logic in print_options could be factored out using something along:

```
    for option in ['latex_prefix',...]:
        if option in kwds: 
            args = True 
 	    self._print_options[option] = kwds[option]
```

- The documentation of set_print_options duplicates that of the constructor. Could one of them just refer to the other? ``for the options ... see ...``. Actually, maybe the constructor should call set_print_options?

- Could we find something better than _repr_asterix? That is that would refer more explicitly to scalar multiplication? In MuPAD it was timesDot, but it's not great either.

Hi Nicolas,

Thanks for the feedback.  I've changed the code in print_options the way you suggested, and I shortened the docstring there.  I wasn't comfortable having the constructor call print_options, so I didn't change that.

I agree that "repr_asterisk" is a bad name, so I rethought the names.  We already had "prefix" to which I added "latex_prefix".  In parallel with this, I changed "repr_bracket" to "bracket" (to go with my addition, "latex_bracket").  That means that there is no reason for "repr_asterisk" to have "repr" in its name anymore.  I changed that to "scalar_mult".  I think this is better:

```
    - ``scalar_mult`` - string to use for scalar multiplication in
      the print representation (optional, default "*")
```
What do you think?

Hi,

I will fold #10852 in here, if that's okay.

I like the multiple options! I gonna have a more detailed look for a review; here are two first comments:

1. Why do you handle the old prefix option extra? Wouldn't it be enough to keep the prefix method and return to print_options()[\'prefix\'], rather thank keeping _prefix. A complete doctest provided by the buildbot can then check if _prefix is used anywhere.

2. in lines 155p, multiplication is set to ast. Isn't there a way to give this argument to the repr_lincomb method? Otherwise, we get the following:

```
sage: A = CombinatorialFreeModule(QQ,['+','*'],scalar_mult='@@')
sage: A.an_element()
2@@B['@@'] + 2@@B['+']
```

Best, Christian

I would not even try to enforce setting latex_prefix. Whenever the
prefix does not contains specific math code, it would be an
unnecessary burden to have to set both latex_prefix and prefix.

<div id="comment:19" align="right">Comment 19</div>

The Steenrod algebra code at #10052 revealed a small bug in the `_latex_` method: when replacing a trailing "* 1" in latex code via

```
if x[len(x)-l-1:] == ast_replace+"1": 
     return x[:len(x)-l-1] 
```
if `ast_replace` is the empty string, this will just remove any trailing 1, for example from "x \otimes 1" or from "31", etc.  So I'm changing the test to

```
if l > 0 and x[len(x)-l-1:] == ast_replace+"1": 
     return x[:len(x)-l-1] 
```
so it only does the replacement if the length `l` of `ast_replace` is positive.  (I also find the letter "l" hard to distinguish from the number "1", so I'm changing it to "ln".  Then we can pretend it's the natural log and we're doing calculus instead of algebra.)
