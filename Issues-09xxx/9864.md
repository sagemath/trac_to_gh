<div id="comment:2" align="right">comment:2</div>

I would triple-check that all objects are built with position independent code (PIC), using the -fPIC option. There are three problems with PIC.

* Libraries built without PIC run a bit more slowly. 
* You can often get away without compiling PIC
* Building shared libraries often works if one does not use PIC.

Because of this, sometimes people don't build PIC code. The GNU manual implies you should, but is not very clear about it. The Sun linker manual is absolutely clear - shared libraries should be built with PIC. 

I've also found that some libraries that should be position independent, do not appear to do so according to the link editor. See #9840 

I know of 2 possible issues that can arise. 

* If the objects are compiled with -fPIC, but there's assembly code that is not  position independent then the resulting library may not work reliably. 
* If shared libraries are created with the wrong options, which is the case with #9833, though only Solaris will be affected, as the options are only wrong on Solaris. 

but there are others. 

I'm aware of three libraries which show problems related to this on Solaris or OpenSolaris in 64-bit mode, but two of them might be an issue on all platforms. 

* PolyBori 
* Cliquer (will only affect Solaris or OpenSolaris)
* ECL

If the system has the `elfdump` command, you might try this:

```
$ elfdump -d ./build/libecl.so |  grep TEXTREL
```

At least on Solaris, that should produce no output. If it does, it indicates a problem with the library.

I just noticed something else - this is using the wrong python:

```
/usr/local/lib/libpython2.6.a: could not read symbols: Bad value
```

I've seen this problem before - see #9209. In fact, perhaps this should be marked as a duplicate of #9209.

Note however that 
* The above example
* My Solaris failure on #9209
* The Redhat Linux failure I link to on #9209 -  http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/37a67ce63e68d55b?hl=en-GB

**all** had the directory `/usr/local/lib/libpython2.6.a` involved. 

I suspect there might be some packages which look under /usr/local/lib, before whatever is specific in Sage.

Yes. 

There's some things in `patches/setup.py` which look odd to me, though since I don't know what SAGE_BINARY_BUILD is, I can't say for sure. 

```
       #
        # add standard directories

        if not SAGE_BINARY_BUILD:
            add_directory(library_dirs, "/usr/local/lib")
            add_directory(include_dirs, "/usr/local/include")

            add_directory(library_dirs, "/usr/lib")
            add_directory(include_dirs, "/usr/include")

        #
```

I think they should be removed from the pil package.

Who knows if at all the indentation is correct? The comment **below** apparently refers to the (closed) `elif`-Darwin branch. `/usr/local/lib` is added *again* later (in the code, in the snippet Dave gave above), **after** `SAGE_LOCAL/lib` and `/usr/lib`, but since it's already in the path, the Sage directory ends up in the middle.

I guess you meant *"**with** PIC"* (`-fpic` or `-fPIC`). (In general that depends on the architecture, and how the code is used.)

Did you report *that*, too? (Ticket?)

$ elfdump -d ./build/libecl.so |  grep TEXTREL

There's also `nm`, binutils' `objdump`, and `readelf`.

For what it's worth, in Tachyon's `spkg-install`, there's an example of retrying an spkg installation after an initial failure:

```sh
if [ $UNAME = "Linux" ]; then
    GCCVERSION=`gcc -dumpversion`
    case $GCCVERSION in
      4.2.4* | 4.3*)
        export GCCFIX="-fno-crossjumping -fno-reorder-blocks";;

    esac
    make linux-thr
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
        echo "Maybe your system is 64-bit; trying again."
        if [ `uname -m` = "ia64" ]; then
          echo "ia64"
          make linux-ia64-thr

```python
            add_directory(library_dirs, "/usr/local/lib")
            # FIXME: check /opt/stuff directories here?
```

If I comment out this `add_directory` line, PIL builds successfully on rosemary.  The doctests that didn't pass previously -- in `plot/plot3d/base.pyx` -- now pass.

Does anyone see a reason to keep this line for any platform?  Has it not caused problems on other systems, because the systems haven't had a `/usr/local/lib/libpython2.6.a`?


> Who knows if at all the indentation is correct? The comment **below** apparently refers to the (closed) `elif`-Darwin branch. `/usr/local/lib` is added *again* later (in the code, in the snippet Dave gave above), **after** `SAGE_LOCAL/lib` and `/usr/lib`, but since it's already in the path, the Sage directory ends up in the middle.

Indeed, with the original line, I get

```python
['/usr/local/lib', '/home/buildbot/build/sage/rosemary-1/rosemary_full/build/sage-4.6.1.alpha2/local/lib', '/usr/lib']  # library_dirs
['libImaging', '/home/buildbot/build/sage/rosemary-1/rosemary_full/build/sage-4.6.1.alpha2/local/include', '/usr/local/include', '/usr/include']  # include_dirs
```
but without it, I get

```python

['/home/buildbot/build/sage/rosemary-1/rosemary_full/build/sage-4.6.1.alpha2/local/lib', '/usr/local/lib', '/usr/lib']  # library_dirs
['libImaging', '/home/buildbot/build/sage/rosemary-1/rosemary_full/build/sage-4.6.1.alpha2/local/include', '/usr/local/include', '/usr/include']  # include_dirs
```

Yes please, can you create a patch such that we can close this ticket after month of deep thinking?

If new failures occur, we can open another ticket (I'm hopefully not cc'ed on ;-) ).

I've added a spkg link to the description and attached an SPKG patch.  The main changes:

* Comment out the `/usr/local/lib` line [pointed out by Leif](#comment%3A15).
* Use `patch` to apply the patch.

The package installs successfully and the long doctests pass for me on bsd (OSX 10.6-32), eno (Fedora 13-64), hawk (OpenSolaris 06.2009-32), redhawk (Ubuntu 10-64), rosemary (RHEL 5.5-64), and sage.math (Ubuntu 8-64).

Thanks for the work on this ticket, I will do some more testing

About using `patch`: for sake of consistency, please follow the following instructions from [https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/9419#comment:5](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/9419#comment:5):

```
1) create a directory pil-1.1.6.p2
2) cd pil-1.1.6.p2
3) put upstream source inpil-1.1.6.p2/src
For every ISSUE which needs to be patched, do the following:
    4) cp -pr src src.patched
    5) edit src.patched to fix ISSUE.
    6) diff -ur src src.patched >patches/ISSUE.patch
    7) rm -r src.patched
```

To apply the patches in `spkg-install`:

```
1) cd src
2) patch -p1 <../patches/ISSUE.patch
```

I'm having issues with PIL 1.1.6p2 (the release version) not finding its JPEG libraries. These are located in /usr/lib64 on CentOS 5.5 / OpenSuse, however the default library path only considers /usr/lib. Adding /usr/lib64 as a library path fixes the problem in my stand-alone PIL build.

Is it essential to have the JPEG libraries? If not, then they should be excluded when `SAGE_FAT_BINARY=yes`, otherwise we risk breakages if people install a Sage binary on a system without these libraries. 

I'm puzzled why it should be necessary to so add `/usr/lib64`. Has someone mis-configured the system? 

On every system that I know, that is able to build both 32-bit and 64-bit libraries, the runtime lnker will always search for the 64-bit ones when building 64-bit code. On Solaris the 64-bit libraries are in `/usr/lib/sparcv9` or `/usr/lib/amd64`, depending on the CPU type. But the run time linker knows that, and will search for them:One never needs to put `/usr/lib/sparcv9` or `/usr/lib/amd64` in any sort of PATH (LD_LIBRARY_PATH etc). 

```
-bash-3.00$ crle    

Default configuration file (/var/ld/ld.config) not found
  Default Library Path (ELF):   /lib:/usr/lib  (system default)
  Trusted Directories (ELF):    /lib/secure:/usr/lib/secure  (system default)
-bash-3.00$ crle -64

Default configuration file (/var/ld/64/ld.config) not found
  Default Library Path (ELF):   /lib/64:/usr/lib/64  (system default)
  Trusted Directories (ELF):    /lib/secure/64:/usr/lib/secure/64  (system default)
-bash-3.00$ 
```

It's a complely different matter in directories like `/usr/local/lib/sparcv9` since the run time linker does not to search there. 

I know this is true on HP-UX too. 

On AIX, the libraries are in an archives containing both 32-bit and 64-bit libraries in the same archive. But again, the run-time linker knows how to find them. 

Clearly if the system is mis-configured, we should not work around the problem. 

I think we should ascertain if someone has mis-configured the system before proceeding to patch Sage

P.S.: PIL 1.1.7 adds a `find_include_file()` function, but still won't find a library in `/usr/lib64`, so I think we should fix that, not sure if on this ticket though.
