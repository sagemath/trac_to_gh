Readline builds, but then if we look at the libraries, one has the wrong extension.

I don't know AIX well, but I suspect the .a is a static library here, and the .so is a shared library. But AIX uses .a for shared libraries. (I don't know what it uses for static libraries - it might be .o). 

This is probably a mis-configuration in Sage.

".so" linux style shared libraries are allowed with recent linkers of AIX (I don't know if it extends as far back as AIX 5.3 it is definitely in 6.1) but you need to know the extra linking flags to use them "-G" and "-brtl" depending on the case. It is all pretty dangerous and it is best to leave the task of making the libraries to libtool if possible.
