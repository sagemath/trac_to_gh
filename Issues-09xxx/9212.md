After #8276, the top-level identity_matrix and zero_matrix functions return immutable matrices, which is a backwards-incompatible change that is inconvenient in many cases (when code starts with those matrices as the base and then modifies them).

This patch makes these matrices mutable.

I posted a call for a vote to sage-devel:

because clearly if the confusion above stemmed from a discussion on sage-devel, the appropriate place to resolve things is on sage-devel.

Hey Jason,

Following test in sage/misc/sagedoc.py (line 1089) is now broken.

```
sage: browse_sage_doc(identity_matrix, 'rst')[-60:-5]
```

You did run full tests before posting this, didn't you?  ;-)  More commentary in the morning.

No, I didn't run full doctests before posting the patch, so thanks for catching this!  I believe I tested the matrix directory, though.

When you say you have a review ready to go, do you mean that you have a reviewer patch to fix the doctest error, or should I do that?
