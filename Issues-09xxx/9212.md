```
After #8276, the top-level identity_matrix and zero_matrix functions return immutable matrices, which is a backwards-incompatible change that is inconvenient in many cases (when code starts with those matrices as the base and then modifies them).

This patch makes these matrices mutable.

No, I didn't run full doctests before posting the patch, so thanks for catching this!  I believe I tested the matrix directory, though.

When you say you have a review ready to go, do you mean that you have a reviewer patch to fix the doctest error, or should I do that?
