After #8276, the top-level identity_matrix and zero_matrix functions return immutable matrices, which is a backwards-incompatible change that is inconvenient in many cases (when code starts with those matrices as the base and then modifies them).

This patch makes these matrices mutable.

Hey Jason,

Following test in sage/misc/sagedoc.py (line 1089) is now broken.

```
sage: browse_sage_doc(identity_matrix, 'rst')[-60:-5]

You did run full tests before posting this, didn't you?  ;-)  More commentary in the morning.

No, I didn't run full doctests before posting the patch, so thanks for catching this!  I believe I tested the matrix directory, though.

When you say you have a review ready to go, do you mean that you have a reviewer patch to fix the doctest error, or should I do that?
