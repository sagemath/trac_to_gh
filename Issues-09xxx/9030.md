'rubiks' has code to attempt to build it 64-bit, but that does not seem to be fully functional, as parts are built 32-bit and parts are built 64-bit.

When we check files, I note some are built 32-bit and some are built 64-bit.

drkirkby@hawk:~/sage-4.4.2$ file local/bin/optimal
local/bin/optimal: ELF 64-bit LSB executable AMD64 Version 1, dynamically linked, not stripped
```

I expect this would happen on any platform where the default is 32-bit, suggesting to me this never even worked 64-bit on OS X systems where 32-bit was the default.

Replying to [@robertwb](#comment:3):
> As this is never linked in directly, there is no need (or advantage, as far as I can tell) to build this 64-bit for a fully functional Sage. 

I agree there is no technical advantage in using rubiks 64-bit. 

However, it seems rather unprofessional to have 4 out of the 6 binaries building 64-bit, and two of them building 32-bit. Having all rubiks binaries made 64-bit allows one to quickly find any binaries from any packages that are not being built properly, using a command like

```
$ find local -exec file {} \; | grep 32-bit
```

as such, I believe it's desirable that a 64-bit build on OpenSolaris, Solaris or any other operating system for that matter creates only 64-bit objects.

A revised package, which add the -m64 flag to the makefile is at 

http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/patches/rubiks-20070912.p11.spkg

There were a lot of files not in the repository (I believe this was my fault months ago), which I've checked in. As such, the patch is a lot longer than it needs to be to fix this particular problem. 

The following line:

```
CFLAGS = -O -DLARGE_MEM -DVERBOSE
```
gets be changed to:

```
CFLAGS = ${CFLAG64} -O -DLARGE_MEM -DVERBOSE
```

using 'sed'. 

$CFLAG64 is then set to -m64 if building 64-bit, so the -m64 gets added to the makefile. 


After building **all** the rubiks binaries are 64-bit. i.e.

```
drkirkby@hawk:~/sage-4.4.2$ file local/bin/size222 
local/bin/size222:	ELF 64-bit LSB executable AMD64 Version 1, dynamically linked, not stripped, no debugging information available
drkirkby@hawk:~/sage-4.4.2$ file local/bin/dikcube
local/bin/dikcube:	ELF 64-bit LSB executable AMD64 Version 1, dynamically linked, not stripped, no debugging information available
```

Previously both were being built 32-bit (see the output of the find command shown above, where clearly there was a mix of 32-bit and 64-bit objects). 

This has been compiled on sage.math and bsd.math as well as my own Sun Ultra 27 running OpenSolaris.
