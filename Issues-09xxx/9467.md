This is a first attempt at merging the code William and I wrote during Sage Days 22 to compute p-adic L-series associated to modular Jacobians.

Below is an example of a p-adic L-series associated to the rank 2 Jacobian of a curve (level N = 188) in 
"Empirical evidence for the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjectures for modular Jacobians of genus 2 curves" (Flynn, Leprevost, Schaefer, Stein, Stoll, Wetherell).

I realize the naming isn't quite right (this is the L-series of a
curve whose Jacobian is a certain quotient of J_0(N) ...), but here's the main function:

```

sage: J = J0(188)
sage: L = J.padic_lseries(7)
sage: f = L.series(5)
```
