The behavior is somewhat unpredictable and depends on the user's system configuration, the following is **just luck**:

I was wondering the same thing myself. I suspect 

```
$ /path/to/doggy/script 
```
would not work, as the script would not execute properly, but

```
$ sh /path/to/doggy/script 
```
will work, as the first line is just a syntax error.

Anyway, its good it's fixed.

```

> would not work, as the script would not execute properly,

Well, unless the loader interprets the first bytes as indicating something else, the script is fed to the default interpreter (which need not be a shell). (Some shells might interpret the header by themselves first.)

(Btw, `sage-spkg` does this:

```sh
...
chmod +x spkg-install
...
else # not Debian
    time ./spkg-install
fi
...
```
)

> but


```
$ sh /path/to/doggy/script 
```
> will work, as the first line is just a syntax error.

That depends on whether you have the programs `B1` and `2000` installed (or likewise defined a shell alias/function).
