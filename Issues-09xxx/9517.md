Below is an example of the strange behavior in sage 4.4.4.

```
sage: PR1=PolynomialRing(QQ,'x');PR2=PolynomialRing(QQ,1,'x')
sage: PR1;PR2
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field
Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field
```

I've searched for similar problems but only #9220 seems vagely related but is a real different problem.

It's not a bug it's a feature :)

From the documentation of PolynomialRing:

```
``PolynomialRing(base_ring, name, sparse=False)`` returns a univariate polynomial ring; also, PolynomialRing(base_ring, names, sparse=False) yields a univariate polynomial ring, if names is a list or tuple providing exactly one name. All other input formats return a multivariate polynomial ring.
