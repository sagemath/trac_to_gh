Random element in fraction fields is broken. The current behavior is to take two random elements from the base and return its quotient. Having bad luck, that might return division by zero.

Example code:

```
sage: R = GF(3)['t']
sage: f = FractionField(R).random_element()
```
The attached patch fixes the bug.

Hi Ralph,

Are you sure you are running the latest version of Sage? Â It seems to me that the line numbers of the file your patch refers to are different and furthermore that the code of the latest version is actually correct.

Best regards,

Johan
