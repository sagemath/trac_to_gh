"sage -sh" is intended to start a subshell of the user's preference (as per $SHELL) with the local Sage environment configured in it.

In order to prevent the environment being altered by the user's shell RC scripts, local/bin/sage-sage passes an argument to $SHELL which is intended to disable RC processing.  Unfortunately, it assumes that 'sh' is 'bash' and passes '--norc' - which is not legal for POSIX shells.

Whilst this appears to be ignored by Solaris /bin/sh and /usr/xpg4/bin/sh (which is at variance to the man page), it is rejected by FreeBSD /bin/sh - which reports "Illegal option --".

The fix is not clear because Cygwin, Linux and OpenSolaris (at least) all install bash as /bin/sh - though experiments show that at least bash-4.1.7 will not run any RC script when invoked as sh.

Is this still an issue?

(The script btw. has meanwhile been renamed / moved to `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/bin/sage`.)

The relevant part of the script says

```sh
        sh)
            # We don't really know which shell "sh" is (it could be
            # bash, but this is not guaranteed), so we don't set
            # SHELL_OPTS.
            if [ "$color_prompt" = yes ] ; then
                PS1="$(tput rev)(sage-sh)$(tput sgr0) $USER@`hostname -s`:\${PWD##*/}$ "
            else
                PS1="(sage-sh) $USER@`hostname -s`:\${PWD}$ "
            fi
            export PS1
            ;;
```
So it doesn't look like this ticket is relevant any more.
