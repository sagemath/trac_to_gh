When did we hijack the sum function? Based on the documentation there, I have (today alone) had four different people come up to me and ask why something like the following doesn't work:

```
sage: sum(Integer(x), x, 0, 9)
```

I know the reasons this shouldn't work, but newbies definitely don't. It should say something about how to do

```
sage: sum( Integer(x) for x in range(10) )
```
before "getting all symbolic."

    "body": "<a id='comment:14'></a>\nOkay, I'm going to ask for one final thing.  Probably it isn't appropriate to have this warning be before one even sees the INPUT block!  Can you put this after the first few examples, and then have some wording indicating \"now back to the examples\" in a not-informal way?  Otherwise we'll have the opposite problem of everyone avoiding this function :)\n\nAlso, another nit-pick - try to put the `sum()` in double back ticks so that it typesets properly as code.

Okay, I'm going to ask for one final thing.  Probably it isn't appropriate to have this warning be before one even sees the INPUT block!  Can you put this after the first few examples, and then have some wording indicating "now back to the examples" in a not-informal way?  Otherwise we'll have the opposite problem of everyone avoiding this function :)

Also, another nit-pick - try to put the `sum()` in double back ticks so that it typesets properly as code.  And... is there any general reference for the Python sum, or are all of them version-dependent?  (I think the latter, just checking in case you know).

Thanks! Sorry this is an incremental review but it will be more awesomer soon.
