When did we hijack the sum function? Based on the documentation there, I have (today alone) had four different people come up to me and ask why something like the following doesn't work:

```
sage: sum(Integer(x), x, 0, 9)
```

I know the reasons this shouldn't work, but newbies definitely don't. It should say something about how to do

```
sage: sum( Integer(x) for x in range(10) )
```
before "getting all symbolic."

https://docs.python.org/{2,3}/library/functions.html#sum is the link, technically.  I won't hold it up for that, though, since they can just click on "sum" from the big list at that location.  Doc looks good now.
