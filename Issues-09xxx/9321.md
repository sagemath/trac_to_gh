When did we hijack the sum function? Based on the documentation there, I have (today alone) had four different people come up to me and ask why something like the following doesn't work:

```
sage: sum(Integer(x), x, 0, 9)
```

I know the reasons this shouldn't work, but newbies definitely don't. It should say something about how to do

```
sage: sum( Integer(x) for x in range(10) )
```
before "getting all symbolic."

Nice first step.  I would also add some actual examples as the original reporter suggests - maybe with an explicit example showing what does and doesn't work along these lines.

Otherwise we'll have the opposite problem of everyone avoiding this function :)

Also, another nit-pick - try to put the `sum()` in double back ticks so that it typesets properly as code.  And... is there any general reference for the Python sum, or are all of them version-dependent?  (I think the latter, just checking in case you know).

Thanks! Sorry this is an incremental review but it will be more awesomer soon.

https://docs.python.org/{2,3}/library/functions.html#sum is the link, technically.  I won't hold it up for that, though, since they can just click on "sum" from the big list at that location.  Doc looks good now.

:-)  Sorry for the delay; I definitely have been having to cut back even on review time the past few months.
