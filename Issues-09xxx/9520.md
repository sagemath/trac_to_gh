`wrong ELF class:` messages mean an attempt was made to link a mixture of 32-bit and 64-bit object files. 

But the build process still goes on to report that scipy_sandbox-20071020.p5 has installed OK. 

What is odd, is that `spkg-install` looks to be OK to me. 

```
python setup.py install

if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Error building arpack \n"
    exit 1
fi

cd ..
cd delaunay
python setup.py install

if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Error building delaunay triangulation code \n"
    exit 1
fi
```

Has anyone got any ideas? Could it be that the _configtest tries various ways to compile, so despite these being errors, this is actually OK? I somewhat doubt that is the case, but I don't know. 

Like a very similar issue with scipy (#9519), I'm not sure if this is an upstream bug or not. I suspect it is.
