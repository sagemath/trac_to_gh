Note that Richy's suggestion about using `x=y^2` doesn't work either in ginsh.
Does anybody know how maxima resolves this issue?

Anyway, perhaps that's not relevant.   There's a pretty relevant followup to the discussion referenced above:

```

Oh, you're so right! Actually, that's because the result of 
series(sqrt(x^2),x==0,3) is not necessarly x: it could just as well be 
-x. The presence of the branch point makes it more tricky.

Sorry for not being able to help.
```

That doesn't resolve things here.  My guess is that the current behavior in Ginac could actually be considered correct, so that we should just add some documentation saying so?

We should probably fix pynac/ginac to not give an error.  From the referenced ginac-devel thread, the correct response to series(x^{1/2}} at 0 is a Puiseux series and:

> The Puiseux expansion of sqrt(x) is, well, x^(1/2).

which ginac is not currently able to do, but which maxima in fact returns correctly as x^(1/2).
Also, here's maxima on the series of x^2 at 0:

(%i1) taylor(x^2,x,0,3);
                                   2
(%o1)/T/                          x  + . . .

which again looks to be correct.  So far there is not much response to the referenced thread on ginac-devel so we may have to fix this ourselves, and we might start by understanding how maxima recognizes Puiseux conditions.  Towards that end I've started reading maxima's series.lisp code but, being a newbie to maxima development, pointers from the maxima experts would be very helpful.

The `taylor()` method is cruft left over from pre-pynac symbolics. We should depreciate it in favor of the `series()` method. It's perfectly acceptable to give Puiseux series as a result of a call to `.series()`. I expect this to be done in #6119, where we add an `algorithm=` option to `.series()`. The default behavior can be to call pynac and fall back to maxima if that returns an error.

This ticket can then be about fixing pynac/ginac to allow these series expansions, in which case, it should be moved to the issue tracker on bitbucket:

I don't know if I'd go that far.  I think that especially the top-level `taylor()` (which calls `SR.taylor()`) is very useful; having the top command be `series()` is more confusing, as there are lots of series out there.

That said, `SR.taylor()` should probably be calling Pynac at this point, probably just the `.series()` method (without Puiseaux).   I agree that the code itself is cruft, just not the name :)

It would cause problems in the future if that ever changes. We should also add some doctests to make sure it only returns Taylor expansions.\n\nThis can also be done as a part of #6119.

OK. I can see the educational appeal of a `taylor()` method.

> That said, `SR.taylor()` should probably be calling Pynac at this point, probably just the `.series()` method (without Puiseaux).   I agree that the code itself is cruft, just not the name :)

This would work, given the current behavior of Pynac/GiNaC's `series()` function. It would cause problems in the future if that ever changes. We should also add some doctests to make sure it only returns Taylor expansions.

This can also be done as a part of #6119. Then, instead of a deprecation message we give an error pointing to the `.series()` method.

Sounds good.
