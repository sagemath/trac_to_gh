desolve_system sometimes generates a Maxima result that includes temporary variables that Sage does not parse correctly.

```
sage: t = var('t')
sage: x1 = function('x1', t)
sage: x2 = function('x2', t)
sage: de1 = (diff(x1,t) == -3*(x2^2-1))
sage: de2 = (diff(x2,t) == 1)
sage: desolve_system([de1, de2], [x1, x2], ivar=t)
...
TypeError: unable to make sense of Maxima expression 'x1(t)=ilt(-((3*laplace(x2(t)^2,t,?g1543)-x1(0))*?g1543-3)/?g1543^2,?g1543,t)' in Sage 
```

On [ this Maxima list thread] we get the original system in Maxima notation - thanks to Stavros Macrackis:

```
de1: diff(x1(t),t)=-3*(x2(t)^2-1);
de2: diff(x2(t),t)=1;
desolve([de1,de2],[x1(t),x2(t)]);
```
He also provides a simpler example which does this:

```
desolve([diff(f(x),x)=f(x^2)],[f(x)]);
```
The suggestion is that the ilt should be replacing the `?g1234` type variables (which are indeed dummy variables, but native Lisp ones) by Maxima-type ones, so I am putting to reported upstream, developers acknowledge bug.  However, my feeling is that we should fix this by parsing these things as well, should they come up again.

This is now fixed (probably due to upstream upgrade) :

```
sage: x1, x2=function("x1, x2")
sage: de1=x1(t).diff(t)==-3*(x2(t)-1)
sage: de2=x2(t).diff(t)==1
sage: Sol=desolve_system([de1, de2],[x1(t),x2(t)],ivar=t) ; Sol
[x1(t) == -3/2*t^2 - 3*t*x2(0) + 3*t + x1(0), x2(t) == t + x2(0)]
```

==> invalidation of the bug and review query in order to get this bug closed.
