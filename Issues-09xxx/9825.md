desolve_system sometimes generates a Maxima result that includes temporary variables that Sage does not parse correctly.

```
sage: t = var('t')
sage: x1 = function('x1', t)
sage: x2 = function('x2', t)
sage: de1 = (diff(x1,t) == -3*(x2^2-1))
sage: de2 = (diff(x2,t) == 1)
sage: desolve_system([de1, de2], [x1, x2], ivar=t)
...
TypeError: unable to make sense of Maxima expression 'x1(t)=ilt(-((3*laplace(x2(t)^2,t,?g1543)-x1(0))*?g1543-3)/?g1543^2,?g1543,t)' in Sage

<div id="comment:1" align="right">Comment 1</div>

On [ this Maxima list thread] we get the original system in Maxima notation - thanks to Stavros Macrackis:

```
de1: diff(x1(t),t)=-3*(x2(t)^2-1);
de2: diff(x2(t),t)=1;
desolve([de1,de2],[x1(t),x2(t)]);
```
He also provides a simpler example which does this:

```
desolve([diff(f(x),x)=f(x^2)],[f(x)]);
```
The suggestion is that the ilt should be replacing the `?g1234` type variables (which are indeed dummy variables, but native Lisp ones) by Maxima-type ones, so I am putting to reported upstream, developers acknowledge bug.  However, my feeling is that we should fix this by parsing these things as well, should they come up again.

Replying to [@rwst](#comment%3A15):
> This now returns `[x1(t) == ilt(-(3*g3390*laplace(x2(t)^2, t, g3390) - g3390*x1(0) - 3)/g3390^2, g3390, t), x2(t) == t + x2(0)]` so it becomes an issue to fix our Maxima interface.

According to the documentation of `inverse_laplace` this is probably more or less correct. We might want to do something about "ilt" so that it is more closely tied to `inverse_laplace`, though.

<div id="comment:17" align="right">Comment 17</div>

This is now fixed (probably due to upstream upgrade) :

```
sage: x1, x2=function("x1, x2")
sage: de1=x1(t).diff(t)==-3*(x2(t)-1)
sage: de2=x2(t).diff(t)==1
sage: Sol=desolve_system([de1, de2],[x1(t),x2(t)],ivar=t) ; Sol
[x1(t) == -3/2*t^2 - 3*t*x2(0) + 3*t + x1(0), x2(t) == t + x2(0)]
```

==> invalidation of the bug and review query in order to get this bug closed.
