}
```
When the numerator of a (negative) symbolic expression happens to be `1` (and only then), the sign is dropped in its LaTeX representation (but not its string representation):

```
sage: latex(-1/x) 
\frac{1}{x}
sage: latex(1/-x) 
\frac{1}{x}
```

Origin of the new doctest failure in `sage/graphs/generic_graphy.py`, introduced with Sage 4.4.3.alpha0.

---

**Update:**

Actually, though I tested many other cases, the same (still) happens if both the numerator and denominator are (symbolic) variables (see also https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/9086#comment:12):

```
sage: var("x y")
(x, y)
sage: latex(-x/y)
\frac{x}{y}
sage: latex(x/-y)
\frac{x}{y}
```

But since it was discovered after the patch that fixes the first issue had been merged, the latter bug is now https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/9314.

The patch to the pynac spkg is long, but is logically nearly trivial.  I just copied some code for printing a sign, which Burcin forgot.

The patch to the sage library is merely to test that this is fixed.

Sorry, i've changed the description and couldn't revert the change.

Indeed. Despite the ticket's name, I think this second case should be addressed on another ticket, since this one had already been merged.
