```
When the numerator of a (negative) symbolic expression happens to be `1` (and only then), the sign is dropped in its LaTeX representation (but not its string representation):

```
sage: latex(-1/x) 
\frac{1}{x}
sage: latex(1/-x) 
\frac{1}{x}
```

Origin of the new doctest failure in `sage/graphs/generic_graphy.py`, introduced with Sage 4.4.3.alpha0.

---

**Update:**

Actually, though I tested many other cases, the same (still) happens if both the numerator and denominator are (symbolic) variables (see also http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/9086#comment:12):

```
sage: var("x y")
(x, y)
sage: latex(-x/y)
\frac{x}{y}
sage: latex(x/-y)
\frac{x}{y}
```

But since it was discovered after the patch that fixes the first issue had been merged, the latter bug is now http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/9314.

The patch to the pynac spkg is long, but is logically nearly trivial.  I just copied some code for printing a sign, which Burcin forgot.

The patch to the sage library is merely to test that this is fixed.
