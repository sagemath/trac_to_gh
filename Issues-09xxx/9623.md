Finished porting most of the examples to the sage library. There are some remaining issues:

* `practice_differentiating_polynomials` - mixups with the states happen
* `trigonometric_properties_triangle` and
* `special_points` - drawing the items doesn't always work as it should. 

If there is somebody who sees the bug, please correct it ;)

Apart from that, they are now conveniently accessible via `interacts.calculus.[TAB]`, `interacts.geometry.[TAB]` and `interacts.statistics.[TAB]`. Maybe I implement some additional ones from the wiki, too... (and it probably doesn't hurt to add a h2 header and some introduction text to each example)

Thanks for nice patch, I'll look at it. First ideas: practice_differentiating_polynomials does not work as expected, so I think that it could be removed. 

I think that it is better to enter limits from keyboard for trapezoidal and Simpson integration rather than input from slider. I also think that it is better to use html.table in Newton method and it is worth to include option which puts computation fot trapezoidal and Simposon integration in a table. Also newton_method and secant method should have similar input forms (presicion is negative power of ten in one of the interacts and positive in the other). 

In the integrals, dx should be TeX-ed as \mathrm{d}x

I am collecting these ideas and include then in a reviewer patch which comes (hope) in few days.

I know, it's something odd about the state transitions and I just did not have enough patience ...

Ok, well, I like the range slider better. It's a matter of taste but the reason for that is that I tried to make it as intuitive as possible and that includes using mouse handles than having to type in numbers.

I'm fine with your other comments.

On the other hand, with sliders you cannot integrate from 0 to 1. I changed the interacts for trapezoidal and simpson rule and they accept both input from slider and keyboard. I hope, this is intuitive enough. 

I tested all interacts and give a positive review (removed practice_differentiating_polynomials which does not work as expected)

Added interact for bisection, since it is close to secant method and newton method.

Added interact for definition of Riemann integral, which is close to trapezoidal rule and Simpson formula, removed. 

Fixed one deprecation warning. Added titles to (most) of the interacts. Added tables for computation related to Simpson and trapezoidal rule.

Positive review for 9623-interact-examples.patch! Thank you for the patch. I wonder if the layout parameter in interact can be used also with library_interact.

I included reviewer patch in 9623-interact-examples2.patch. Could you or someone else review my changes?

Btw: The interact for riemann integral is a part of work which has been supported by the grant 131/2010 of the [FRVŠ](http://www.frvs.cz/)

Known problem for trapezoidal and simpson integration: bad rendering of the computation if we integrate negative function: minus sign follows dot or plus sign.

<a id='comment:30'>**Comment 30:**</a>
I am really glad I looked at these.  In general, they are really nice, and ready for prime time - and SO much easier to use than sifting through the wiki!

But oh my goodness... SO many minor things that still had to be taken care of.  I apologize for not creating a new diff - I had already started making the changes quite a bit when I realized I should have just made a reviewer patch.  I tried to make the commit message maximally informative, though.  There is already too much stuff on here to try to avoid the patch bomb; in retrospect, we should have added these a little more incrementally so as to avoid this situation.

So, **very** unfortunately, I must still ask for review on this.  There are too many changes.  **BUT** I feel like many of them are ones which would have impacted the professionalism pretty significantly.   Read on.

Things I fixed:

* We needed to import `fast_callable` for the Julia set one, for whatever reason.

* I removed the hemisphere, tried to improve the wording of the coin as well as I could - it's a nice example, in fact.

* Many formatting things, $, ticks in doc, confusing wording, bad parenthesis in label of difference quotient, etc.

* Fixed bad thing in function tool where deprecation warning appeared because of `f(x*a)`-type stuff in the code.

* The two formulas on the Simpson one were on top of each other in Safari (not FF).  Since the author used the equals sign incorrectly in any case, I added some words to clarify it was an approximation, and that fixed it.  I think Safari may not like math without words between math (see below for another possible example).  Same on trapezoid.

*  In fact, the entire "Area" line in the trigonometry one was gone on Safari, probably because of `\text`, which I removed.  Also note the triangle was called `A`, not `ABC` as it should have been.

PS - I love the fact you can sage -b while the notebook is still running.  This would have been impossible otherwise.

Things I did not fix:

* Really annoying thing where using these seems to reset my worksheet every so often - I mean it just stops and returns me to the top.  This could be because I had the worksheet open in FF and Safari at the same time.  (?)

* Annoying thing that I could not access the documentation for an interact in the notebook once I had already viewed that particular interact.   This might be a general interact bug.

* I could not easily figure out how to get this in the reference manual; I think I have to create a new directory and a .rst file that will somehow autogenerate, but I don't know how to do this (though I'm sure it's easy).  The original patch of Harald's did not work for me.

* Polar prime spiral consistently complains about failing to evaluate the function at various points.  I had no idea how to fix this, since there are so many functions I couldn't easily identify which one wasn't evaluating, though perhaps it's one of the parametric plots (makes most sense).

* Trig properties angle and circle and text ALL fail to format properly in Safari (not FF). 

* The unit circle one should somehow have formatted `pi`, but I still don't know how to do that.

* Julia set thing doesn't zoom when you zoom, unless you zoom a lot.  Instead it just cuts off the picture for the zoom area.  Maybe it needs a simultaneous plot point uppage?  Incidentally, this one could REALLY use an 'update' button.

* Julia and Mandelbrot ones look kind of sad compared to easy-to-download apps available nowadays, even at max plot points.  I suppose this is the limit of what we can do with an interact of this kind.

* Some of these definitely need a teacher to interpret for someone who is brand new to things.  That's not a bug, but worth pointing out, especially if there is a way to get these in the reference manual.  For instance, the trig on a triangle one is a little weird, because you're putting points on a unit circle labeled by degree.  Okay, but then there are still tick marks labeled on the axes!  So we're sending a mixed - and weird - message with that.  Not a game-stopper, but still somewhat rough.
 
* Quad. Eq. one stacks a little too close in the formatting even in the opening gambit.

* Some of the graphers need more flexible ranges.  I'm not sure how to do this conceptually, though, since we have to hardcode something in with the interacts, and too big a range will make it too hard to zoom.  I guess my point is these are not universal.
 
* Trapezoid and simpson didn't always immediately respond to the 'from keyboard' change.  Maybe you have to click that first, before doing any keyboard changes, or it doesn't like it?

* To me, trig isn't calculus, but I'm not arguing that it can show up there, so I left that one in both calculus and geometry.

So tickets that should be opened after someone (*please*! unless I missed something) gives this positive review:

* Fixing the problem with buttons in multiple rows Jason mentioned.
 
* Putting the hemisphere plot back in, if we want to.

* Polar prime spiral plot point issue.
 
* Figure out how to get this in the manual

* Figuring out how to truly doctest them.  For instance, there could at least be a search for deprecation warnings, or even random input typed... but at least more than just checking that an html block is formed.

This is an example of the kind of not-really-necessary thing that really delays tickets.  When it was written, it was 2010!

But now that you did it, I will have to say 'needs work'.  Although Harald put it in writing, since Lauri Ruotsalainen is the one who came up with many of these in her thesis, it seems inappropriate to not put her in the author listing at the top where you added Harald.

A question for anyone who contributed to this ticket: the file `library_cython.pyx` has this code in it:

```
cpdef cellular(rule, int N):
    '''
    Cythonized helper function for the callular_automata fractal.
    Yields a matrix showing the evolution of a Wolfram's cellular automaton.
    Based on work by Pablo Angulo.
    http://wiki.sagemath.org/interact/misc#CellularAutomata
    
    INPUT:

        - `rule` -- determines how a cell's value is updated, depending on its neighbors
        - `N` -- number of iterations

    TESTS::

        sage: from sage.interacts.library_cython import cellular
        sage: rule = [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]
        sage: N = 3
        sage: print cellular(rule, 3)

    '''
```
Note that the output from the last line of the doctest is missing.  Since the docstring is enclosed in triple single quotes instead of triple double quotes, doctesting skipped this altogether.  At #8708, there is a patch which will now run doctests within triple single quotes, in which case this file has one failure.

So the question is: what is the output supposed to be?  When I run this command, I get

```
        sage: print cellular(rule, 3)
        [[0 0 0 1 0 0 0]
         [0 0 0 1 0 0 0]
         [0 1 0 1 0 1 0]]
```
Is this right?  I don't know what the mathematics here is trying to do, so I really have no idea...

There's also a typo - "callular" isn't an adjective I'm familiar with in Wolfram's work :)  And `N` is not actually used in the rule.

See [this MathWorld site](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ElementaryCellularAutomaton.html) for the descriptions.  The rule is given by binary, so this rule is `2+4+32+128=166`.  It looks like there is in fact an error; I'm having a lot of trouble getting the rules to do what they should with things like rules 1 or 2.  

Here's the problem:

```
        for k in range(N-j, N+j+1):
```
instead of 

```
 for k in range(0,2*N):
```
as on the wiki.  Someone thought they'd be smart and only update the cells that "need" updating... but that totally screws it up, as ALL cells might need updating if e.g. the rule has the final binary digit = 1.  

I'm opening a ticket for this.  Thanks a lot for catching this, John.

This is now #11871.  John, if you want that ticket to "fix" the quoting issue as well, you can put that there; if it doesn't matter because of #8708, then no matter.
