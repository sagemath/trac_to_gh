shows a way of finding out any libraries that executables link to, where there are no references to what's in the library. 

ECL would appear to have 3 in the current version of Sage, though it is reduced to 1 in the latest `git` snapshot of ECL I downloaded yesterday:

```
drkirkby@hawk:~/ecl$ ldd -r -u build/bin/ecl
libecl.so =>build/libecl.so
libdl.so.1 => /lib/libdl.so.1
libm.so.2 => /lib/libm.so.2
libsocket.so.1 => /lib/libsocket.so.1
libnsl.so.1 => /lib/libnsl.so.1
libintl.so.1 => /lib/libintl.so.1
libc.so.1 => /lib/libc.so.1
libgmp.so.10 => /usr/local/gcc-4.5.0/lib/libgmp.so.10
libmp.so.2 => /lib/libmp.so.2
libmd.so.1 => /lib/libmd.so.1
libscf.so.1 => /lib/libscf.so.1
libgcc_s.so.1 => /usr/local/gcc-4.5.0/lib/libgcc_s.so.1
libuutil.so.1 => /lib/libuutil.so.1
libgen.so.1 => /lib/libgen.so.1
libsmbios.so.1 => /usr/lib/libsmbios.so.1

   unused object=/lib/libintl.so.1
```

Note the unused library

```
unused object=/lib/libintl.so.1
```

ECL should only link to these libraries if it needs them, which I expect it does with some options. There were no options given to configure here.
