At the moment, GLPK is the solver used regardless of the presence of CBC or CPLEX. This is just because of a line written ten lines too high in the file !

I applied your patch, but while trying to solve an MIP without specifying a solver, I've got an AttributeError, since the attribute '_default_solver' was not defined.
I just fixed this by adding a line stating that _default_solver = None.
If you agree with my changes, I think the patch can be said to be reviwed.

Excellent ! Thank you very much for your help :-)

Both apply fine and in the end, it works... Now the annoying part is #8880 because CPLEX is called by next-to-any method in the LP library XD
