Hello !!!

Nice patch ! Nothing to complain about, and they bring nice additions to Sage `:-)`

I uploaded a (very short) patch with very small modifications. As usual, I give a positive review to your patch, and you can change the status of this ticket if you like mine `:-)`

(btw, don't forget to set your tickets as "needing review" when you have uploaded your patch !)
