Attachment: **[trac_9053_fixes_pivots.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9053/trac_9053_fixes_pivots.patch.gz)**

The bug was a single line in _echelon_form_PID which returned the wrong pivot element for matrices of one row. The attached patch should fix that.

While doctesting all of Sage I received two errors (that seem unrelated?):

```
The following tests failed:

        sage -t  -long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/gal_reps.py # Time out
        sage -t  -long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/interfaces/sage0.py # 2 doctests failed
```

The first apparently also came up during discussions on [#9390](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/9390). The doctest failure in sage0.py "randomly" appeared or not when I reran the test mutiple times. I'm not quite sure what to make of this...
