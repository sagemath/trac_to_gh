In #7154, the rename_keyword deprecation decorator has an extra argument.  Right now, it's:

```
@rename_keyword(deprecated='Sage 4.6', deprecated_option='thickness', thickness='width') 
```

but should just be

```
@rename_keyword(deprecated='Sage 4.6', thickness='width') 
```

My bad for not catching this in the review stage.

**Assignee:** jason, was

Just for the record, this then also needs to be fixed:

```
sage -t -long "devel/sage/sage/geometry/polyhedra.py"       
**********************************************************************
File "/home/leif/Sage/sage-4.6.alpha1/devel/sage/sage/geometry/polyhedra.py", line 1270:
    sage: p1.projection().show() + p2.projection().show() + p3.projection().show()
Expected nothing
Got:
    doctest:4555: DeprecationWarning: (Since Sage 4.6) use the option 'width' instead of 'thickness'
    <BLANKLINE>
**********************************************************************
1 items had failures:
   1 of  14 in __main__.example_66
***Test Failed*** 1 failures.

Leif: is that the only failure in all long doctests (i.e., ptestlong or similar?)

If not, I'll run ptestlong to check.

Replying to [jason](#comment%3A2):
> Leif: is that the only failure in all long doctests (i.e., ptestlong or similar?)


The only one related to this (`DeprecationWarning`) with the *unreleased* 4.6.alpha1.

If you put the deprecation warning into the doctest ("expected"), don't forget to not hard-code the line number (from `ncadoctest.py`!).
