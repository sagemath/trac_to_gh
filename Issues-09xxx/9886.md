Sage 4.5.3, 2.6GHz Opteron, Linux

This is ok:

```
sage: R = Integers(3^20)
sage: u = R(2)
sage: timeit("z = u.lift()")
625 loops, best of 3: 351 ns per loop
```

This is not:

```
sage: timeit("z = ZZ(u)")
625 loops, best of 3: 37.9 Âµs per loop
```

Wow. See also #9885 for a not-quite-as-insane version of this.

The patch at #9887 should fix this, but it doesn't.  I'm not sure why.

I figured out why.  Hashing for R is slow, and ZZ._convert_map_hash needs to compute hash(R) to get the appropriate morphism.  See #10130 for a patch fixing this.
