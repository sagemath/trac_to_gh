Sage 4.5.3, 2.6GHz Opteron, Linux

This is ok:

```
sage: R = Integers(3^20)
sage: u = R(2)
sage: timeit("z = u.lift()")
625 loops, best of 3: 351 ns per loop
```

This is not:

```
sage: timeit("z = ZZ(u)")
625 loops, best of 3: 37.9 Âµs per loop
```

Wow. See also #9885 for a not-quite-as-insane version of this.

The patch at #9887 should fix this, but it doesn't.  I'm not sure why.

Similar relative result here. (However, my times are 3x slower with 3GHz AMD Phenom, fascinating).
