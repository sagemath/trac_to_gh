There is a correspondance between groups of Dirichlet characters and Galois groups of abelian fields (over Q). We implement here three functions

* the conductor of an abelian field

* the set of Dirichlet characters of an abelian field

* the fixed field of a Dirichlet character

Apart from the above the patch here also introduces the function `is_abelian` and improves `is_galois` for number fields. Subfields of abelian fields inherit both.

There are a few minor things that could be improved at a later state (which I write down here so that I won't forget) :

* The 2-part of the conductor needs adjustment

* We can prove that a field is NOT abelian even if we can not decide that it is Galois, by finding that a prime congruent to 1 modulo the hypothetical conductor that does not completely split.

* Is there some effective Chebotarev that can be used to prove that a field is Galois ?

This would all be a very useful enhancement.  I have a few comments, mostly minor.

The patch applies ok to 4.6.rc0 (with a little fuzz) and all doctests in rings/number_fields pass.

There are some spelling mistakes in the docstrings...

#9400 is now merged: does that help?

How hard is it to get the 2-part of the conductor?  If it is really hard, why not just honestly return the odd part (and change the name, or something)?

I am a bit worried about the 53-bit precision used to compute the polynomials.  Do you now that it always enough (surely not!), or is that wishful thinking?  Is it much too slow to use the appropriate cyclotomic field?

Maybe, I did not think about it.

I don't know. Right now it give the right thing quite frequently, but not always. I would have to think harder to see if one can put the 2-part in as well. I won't do that, I fear.

It is really very very slow with cyclotomic fields. To be honest, I do not think anyone wants to construct a field of the size that would require higher precision in this computation. But that is not an argument to improve this.

I think the computation of fixed field polynomials can be made fasterusing Gauss's formula for the products of periods; see Disquisitiones §343 and/or van der Waerden §54. The formula involves only the exponents of $\zeta$ in the cyclotomic field $\QQ(\zeta)$, so the computation can be carried out computing only with integers (so any concerns about precision are avoided). 

The code with which I've been testing this follows. I've removed the requirement that the order d is prime, which is unnecessary, and dealt separately with the easy cases d = 2 and f = 1.

```
def fixed_field_polynomial_new(self):
    ZZ = IntegerRing()

    n = ZZ(self.conductor())
    if not n.is_prime():
        raise NotImplementedError, 'the conductor %s is supposed to be prime' % n
    
    d = self.order()
        
    # check that there will be such a field of degree d inside QQ(zeta_n)
    if euler_phi(n) % d != 0:
        raise ValueError, 'No field exists because %s does not divide %s=phi(%s)' % (d,euler_phi(n),n)
    f = euler_phi(n)/d

    S = PolynomialRing(ZZ, 'x')

    if f == 1:
        return cyclotomic_polynomial(n, S.gen())
    
    if d == 2:
        if n.mod(4) == 1:
            s = -1
        else:
            s = 1
        return S([s*(n + s)/4, 1, 1])

# Using the notation of van der Waerden, where $\zeta$ is a primitive 
# $n$-root of unity,
# $$
# \eta_i = \sum_{j=0}^{f-1}\zeta^{g^{i+dj}},
# $$
# is represented by eta[i] as the list of exponents.  
# 
# gen_index is a dictionary such that gen_index[r] = i if the exponent r 
# occurs in eta[i].  Thus $\eta^{(r)} = \eta_i$ in van der Waerden's 
# notation.

    R = IntegerModRing(n)
    g = R.unit_gens()[0]
    gen_index = {}
    eta = []
    for i in range(d):
        eta.append([])
        for j in range(f):
            r = g**(i + d*j)
            eta[i].append(r)
            gen_index[r] = i

# Using Gauss's formula
# $$
# \eta^{(r)}\eta^{(s)} = \sum_{j=0}^{f-1}\eta^{(r+sg^{dj})}
# $$
# (with $r=1$), we construct the matrix representing multiplication by
# $\eta_0=\eta^{(1)}$ with respect to the basis consisting of the $\eta_i$.
# Its characteristic polynomial generates the field.  The element
# $\eta^(0)$=f=-f\sum_{i=0}^{d-1}\eta_i$ is represented by eta_zero.

    V = FreeModule(ZZ, d)
    eta_zero = V([-f]*d)
    m = []
    for j in range(d):
       v = 0
       for e in eta[j]:
            try:
                s = V.gen(gen_index[1 + e])              
            except KeyError:
                s = eta_zero
            v += s
       m.append(v)
    m = matrix(m)

Thanks to the suggestion of Francis Clarke above, I could improve this patch now. I substituted his suggested algorithm, which is indeed better.

As for the clumsy implementation of the conductor. I rewrote it a little bit. I did not look into the issue how to get the right power of 2; nor if there is a better algorithm (as this is all I will need for my work).

I believe #9400 does not help to make it better.

All tests pass (including long). I did not take the time to check the algorithms. Documentation and code (aside from the actual algorithms) looks good. Here are some comments:

* "`'the conductor %s is supposed to be prime' % n `", what do you mean by
  "supposed to be"? Do you mean the following?
  `"fixed_field_polynomial is only implemented if the conductor is prime, and %s is not" % n`

* an example
  {{{
  sage: G = DirichletGroup(37)
  sage: psi = G.0^36; psi
  Dirichlet character modulo 37 of conductor 1 mapping 2 |--> 1
  sage: psi.fixed_field_polynomial()
  NotImplementedError: the conductor 1 is supposed to be prime
  }}}
  Why not add a simple check for this case to get the following?
  {{{
  sage: psi.fixed_field_polynomial()
  x
  sage: psi.fixed_field()
  Rational Field
  }}}

* "`if euler_phi(n) % d != 0: `"
  This never happens: d is in a group of order `euler_phi(n)`, hence has order dividing that number

  {{{
  if f == 1: 
      from sage.misc.functional import cyclotomic_polynomial 
      return cyclotomic_polynomial(n, S.gen()) 
  }}}
  It would be good if this check is also added to `fixed_field()`, so that the output could be a `NumberField_cyclotomic`

* when constructing a field from a character, you write
  {{{
  K.is_abelian.set_cache(True) 
  K.is_galois.set_cache(True) 
  }}}
  Why not add K.conductor.set_cache(self.conductor())
 
* "`This assumes that `K/\mathbb{Q}` is an abelian extension;`" add "`even with check_abelian=True`"? Also, I think the developer's guide says something about how to typeset QQ, RR, ZZ etc. in the documentation, I think it is `QQ`.

* "`.. warning: The 2-part of the conductor might be too big.`". Too big for what? Or do you mean that it is incorrect? Add an example and change the first line to "`Computes the conductor of the abelian field `K` up to a power of 2.`"

* In the documentation of `dirichlet group`, "`a abelian`" should be "`an abelian`",
  and can you find a better word for "corresponding"? 

* `# d could be improve to be the exponenent of the Galois group rather than the degree, but I do not see how to how about it already. ` I can't read this: not grammatical

* "`Tough`" should be "`Though`"

* "`Given a number field `K` of conductor `m` and degree `d`,`" add the word "abelian"

And then only the algorithms need to be checked.

I converted this into a git branch and changed the fixed_field_polynomial functionality to use pari instead as discussed on https://github.com/LMFDB/lmfdb/issues/3994 , thanks to Aurel Page for the Pari code.

I have left the old code for fixed_field_polynomial intact, although it only works for prime conductor and order characters I like the idea of having a second easily viewable implementation in the source, to verify against if necessary.

typos:

"poynomial"

"Give a Dirichlet"

some dirichlet missing their D capital in the documentation

`f = euler_phi(n)/d` could use exact division `//`

`fixed_field_polynomial` should have doctests for all three algorithms: sage, pari and banana
