The output from `print()` functions in `libpari` is directly written to `stdout` and is not caught by Sage.  For example, the following doctest fails:

```
def printhello():
    """
    sage: printhello()
    hello
    """
    pari('print("hello")')
```
It gives

```
File "/home/jdemeyer/paritest.sage", line 3:
    sage: printhello()
Expected:
    hello
Got nothing
```

Luckily, `libpari` provides ways to redirect the output.  There should be a small Cython wrapper to direct the PARI output to Python's `sys.stdout.write()`.

Dependencies: #9661, #9343

```
cdef extern: 
    PariOUT defaultOut 
    PariOUT defaultErr 

```
should perhaps migrate to `sage/libs/pari/decl.pxi`, too.

**Positive review** from me though. Robert, anything to complain about?

I wonder when Cython will support `const`...
