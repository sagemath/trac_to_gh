I doubt that it is intended that the names of the variables of a polynomial ring can affect the parent of the result of evaluating such a polynomial:

```
sage: R=QQ['x']
sage: S=QQ['x','y']
sage: h=S.0^2
sage: parent(h(R.0,0))
Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field

sage: R=QQ['x']
sage: S=QQ['u','v']
sage: h=S.0^2
sage: parent(h(R.0,0))
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field 
```
I would expect the result of the second example in both cases.

John Cremona mentions #8502 as fixing a different but similar issue.

I think I've found the culprit in:

```
built-in method __call__ of sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_libsingular.MPolynomial_libsingular
```
Indeed, it tries to coerce the evaluation values into the polynomial ring. Perhaps it should try to coerce into the base ring of the parent instead?

```
        if l != parent._ring.N:
            raise TypeError, "number of arguments does not match number of variables in parent"

        try:
            x = [parent._coerce_c(e) for e in x]
        except TypeError:
            # give up, evaluate functional
            y = parent.base_ring()(0)
            for (m,c) in self.dict().iteritems():
                y += c*mul([ x[i]**m[i] for i in m.nonzero_positions()])
            return y

```
If I were to fix this code, I'd simply always do the code under the "except", but someone probably had a good reason for doing it the way it's done. Probably because `singular_polynomial_call` is more efficient? I see several options:

* Ask the coercion system for a common overring of the base ring of parent and all the parents of x. If that is parent, then coerce and use singular_polynomial_call. Otherwise just multiply out manually.

* see if the parent of all members of x is equal to parent (due to the lax coercion rules, *coercible into* isn't good enough)

* just always evaluate by multiplying out

The first one is the "proper" one in that it uses the coercion system to figure out if a more efficient option is available. The second option should be cheap and catch the case where most speed-up should be attainable. The third option wouldn't waste any time on checking parents, but would need coercion calls for each coefficient-monomial multiplication.

<a id='comment:3'>**Comment 3:**</a>
Indeed the present code does seem to address real overhead:

```
sage: R=QQ['x']
sage: S=QQ['x','y']
sage: h=S.0^2
sage: timeit('h(R.0,0)')
625 loops, best of 3: 269 µs per loop
```
but

```
sage: R=QQ['x']
sage: S=QQ['u','v']
sage: h=S.0^2
sage: timeit('h(R.0,0)')
625 loops, best of 3: 523 µs per loop
```
so option one or two above is probably the proper one.

Attached patch is efficient when evaluation point has the same parent. I guess previously some efficiency was gained when a point was in the base ring as well (the result was subsequently recognised as a constant and coerced back?) by used libsingular evaluation directly. This is lost with attached patch. This probably means that this patch solves #8502 independently as well.

<a id='comment:13'>**Comment 13:**</a>
Some docstring things:
- Please use auto-trac linking <code>:trac:\`9220\`</code>
- For `common_parent()`, I would recommend:

```
Computes a common parent for all the inputs.

This is essentially an `n`-ary canonical coercion except it
can operate on parents rather than just elements. 

INPUT: 

- ``args`` -- a set of elements and/or parents

OUTPUT: 

A :class:`Parent` into which each input should coerce, or raises a 
``TypeError`` if no such :class:`Parent` can be found. 
```
  In particular, there is should not be an indent on the `INPUT:` and `OUTPUT:` blocks.

Thanks, 

Travis

The rebased version worked for me. I've attached a small reviewer patch which just does the minor tweaks to the docstrings. Jeroen, I hope you don't mind me setting this back to a positive review.
