When we test

`/path/to/foo.py`,

`sage-doctest` writes

`SAGE_TESTDIR/.doctest_foo.py`,

runs the new file through `python`, and deletes it.  This can cause collisions when we test in parallel multiple files with the same basename, e.g., `__init__`, `all`, `misc`, `conf`, `constructor`, `morphism`, `index`, `tests`, `homset`, `element`, `twist`, `tutorial`, `sagetex`, `crystals`, `cartesian_product`, `template`, `ring`, etc.

There's a similar problem with testing non-library files, which `sage-doctest` first effectively copies to `SAGE_TESTDIR`.

See [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/0239f712a39fce4a/367bfc0d83c0e9b8#367bfc0d83c0e9b8) for background.

This ticket may help with some of the doctesting problems discussed on the Sage mailing lists.  Related tickets: #9224, #9225, #9449.

There's now a meta-ticket for all doctest-related issues / tickets, #11337.

I don't know much about this, so don't feel able to work on it. 

But for those that do, perhaps a sub-optimal solution is a better temporary measure than a complete industrial strength bullet-proof solution. 

Normally I don't like "quick fixes" that don't do the job properly, but in this case it seems if something is not done, then the problem will remain open forever, as nothing has actually been done on it for 7 months. 

Sometimes I feel that trac tickets get held up for unnecessary long periods due to a reviewer being over pedantic and wanting things outside the scope of the original ticket, which would be better put on another ticket.

Could we use the tempfile module instead of using SAGE_TESTDIR.  The
tempfile module makes files and directories by default that are unique
and are *designed* to live on a fast filesystem, which gets cleaned
regularly.

sage: import tempfile

Hmmm, I'm not sure if people will like substituting the filename with the whole test command everywhere. (I have a wide screen, but...)

Can we please stop creating "hidden" doctest files? To me that doesn't make sense at all; especially but not limited to files in `~/.sage/*/`.

Does the *"For whitespace errors, see ..."* still work (i.e., print the correct filename)?

The notion of *"absolute filenames relative to ..."* is a bit weird... (But thanks for renaming `abs()`. :) )

The rest seems ok; I've yet only looked at the patch though.

What happens if you (re)move `SAGE_LOCAL/bin/.hg/hgrc`?  The problem might be that when you're in `SAGE_LOCAL/bin`, you're invoking `./hg`, instead of `/usr/local/bin/hg`.

Has there been any more thoughts on this? 

I had a doctest failure today on my OpenSolaris machine *hawk*, which is almost certainly a result of this bug. This is using sage-4.6.rc0.

```
The following tests failed:

	sage -t  -long local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sagenb-0.8.2-py2.6.egg/sagenb/notebook/misc.py # 0 doctests failed
	sage -t  -long devel/sage/sage/plot/plot.py # 5 doctests failed
```

The likely reason for the first of these failures can be seen if we look further up the log. 

```
sage -t  -long local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sagenb-0.8.2-py2.6.egg/sagenb/misc/misc.py
         [2.9 s]
sage -t  -long local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sagenb-0.8.2-py2.6.egg/sagenb/notebook/misc.py
python: can't open file '/export/home/drkirkby/.sage//tmp/misc.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory

         [0.2 s]
```

The log clearly shows a file `misc.py` being tested, followed by a second test with a different file also called `misc.py`. That file is then not found. It seems almost inevitable one test deleted the file needed by another test as they were both called `misc.py` and both tested around the same time. 

Note this is the same machine on which the buildbot passed all doctests. 

http://build.sagemath.org/sage/builders/hawk%20full/builds/8/steps/shell_6/logs/stdio

so it seems to be an intermittent problem. (I've also had all tests pass on this). 

These doctests issues are really annoying, as one never knows if its a real Sage bug, or a doctest bug.

There is another problem, which could exist even if every file had a different name. 

If one tests multiple instances of Sage serially, then since they both write to $HOME/.sage, failures can occur even if the file names of the doctests are unique to any one copy of Sage. They need to be unique for any number of instances of Sage. I think testing under $HOME/.sage is a bit silly myself - it would be better to test under the directory where Sage is installed. 

I found that testing `devel/sage/sage/libs/fplll/fplll.pyx` (see #10195), would generate problems when I was testing two copies of Sage at the same time (slightly different versions). I don't know if this patch can handle that situation, but it would be good if it could.

Well this would definitely be a **user error**. You can always set `DOT_SAGE` or `SAGE_TESTDIR` (or whatever it is called) if you want to run multiple tests simultaneously in different shells, even in / with the *same* Sage installation.

> They need to be unique for any number of instances of Sage. I think testing under $HOME/.sage is a bit silly myself - it would be better to test under the directory where Sage is installed.

Definitely not, since this wouldn't work for site installations, where users usually have no write permissions under `SAGE_ROOT`.


> I don't know if this patch can handle that situation, but it would be good if it could.

One could use Sage's PID, user and machine parameters etc. to try to create unique directories, or generally create "random" directories with `mktemp (1)` or `mkdtemp()`, but I think this would be an overkill, since the user can itself do such by setting one of the above variables.

I didn't say that, but it IMHO suffices to have unique names in the namespace of a ptest run.

As I said, you can automatically set up unique test directories by setting one of the above variables e.g. based on the "login" shell's PID, one per terminal / shell.

If multiple machines share the same filesystem, simply add e.g. the hostname, too.

I'm not sure if you are agreeing with me or Leif there Robert - perhaps you can clarify. 

I was going to suggest that we should be using /tmp, but I did not since I can see a disadvantage of it. NFS file systems have caused problems with doc tests failing, especially if they are mis-configured. As such, it would be better if a user tested Sage on the file system where it will be used. By using /tmp they might get a false sense of security. That said, using /tmp for temporary files has been the norm for years. 

I personally think where reasonably practical, we should stop multiple instances of running Sage tests interfering with each other. Although Leif considers this a user error, it is one that a user might easily make. 

But if it possible to avoid creating temporary files, then that should be done. But I would imagine that requires more changes than just adding a pid or hostname.

Agreeing with drkirkby, we should use temp directories.

True, and this ticket has been opened for far too long.

It's not ready for review.  I don't think I have the time to work on this in the next several days, so if you'd like to help, please do!

I think we can make a temporary directory for each run in `sage-(p)test` and pass it to `sage-doctest`, which should ensure the temporary files under the directory are unique.

Using both a hostname and a PID should mean the filename is practically unique if people test on more than one computer using a shared drive. I don't think 'mktemp' will be unique on NFS shared drives, though the probability of a collision would then be very small indeed. But adding a hostname would reduce it even further. 

But we need to be careful if using mktemp. Whilst many systems have it, the implementation is not the same on every system. I know Solaris works a bit different to Linux or OS X (I forget which). I know using something on Solaris with mktemp which would not work with Linux or OS X. (I forget which OS it was though). It seems HP-UX and Solaris differ too.

To me it would -- at least for the moment, or this ticket -- be totally sufficient to have unique filenames by mangling the relative path into the temporary filename.

If someone wants to test multiple Sage installations at the same time, he can simply set `SAGE_TESTDIR` to different locations in each shell.

Doctesting in (or below) `$DOT_SAGE` (which is usually `$HOME/.sage/`) is IMHO a bad idea anyway, not only because `/tmp/` is much more likely to be [on] a local filesystem than `/home/`. (It is usually also faster and auto-cleaned.) Creating a unique temporary directory there shouldn't be a problem.

For the sake of *"For whitespace errors see ..."*, failing files could still be copied elsewhere (to a perhaps more persistent location) at the end of the doctest process.

The only "race condition" that can occur in what I suggested above is in the creation of `SAGE_TESTDIR` itself (if it doesn't already exist), and that can easily be catched.

Still, the best thing is to not create temporary files at all.

(And only dump what would have been written in case of doctest errors, once at the end, with the "same problems", though identical filenames would there be even more unlikely, and could easily be numbered.)

But that's probably for another ticket; we should IMHO here only *quickly* fix the most prominent errors, namely identical filenames within the *same* `ptest`[`long`] instance. If we also allow simultaneous testing of the same or different Sage installations, that's ok, but a pretty minor issue, because -- in contrast to the former -- you can trivially avoid race conditions between such concurrent `ptest` runs. (And a normal user wouldn't do the latter either.)

Amen? Also, unless it uses a local filesystem, I don't think it will work with NFS.

>  Also, if we want to doctest outside of `$HOME/.sage`, is `/tmp` always the best place?  The mkstemp function doesn't always create files there, so I'm not convinced we should.

It simply (in contrast to Sage) respects the commonly used `TMP` (`TEMP` on M$ Windows) and `TMPDIR` environment variables.

Btw, on typical machines `/tmp` does not even really exist on a drive, it's just in memory (and if that's exhausted, swap space will be used transparently). If it is a real partition on a drive, you either use an SSD or at least use that area of a conventional hard drive that is fastest (same for swap).

At least at the moment, we're dealing with `ptest*` only here, so that's another matter (if you want to run multiple `testlong`s for example using the same temporary directory). So `sage -t ...` wouldn't create any directories at all.

The whole collection of doctest scripts needs an overhaul (or redesign) in the long run...

P.S.: We can use `tempfile.gettempdir()` in case `SAGE_TESTDIR` isn't set if that makes you happy.

That was my opinion; Dave earlier requested extensions to allow *simultaneous* testing (including `make test`[`long`] etc.) of *multiple* (possibly the same) Sage installations in the "same" directory (`SAGE_TESTDIR`), i.e. without having to manually set `SAGE_TESTDIR` in different shells.

As further enhancements, we should perhaps print the location at the beginning, and also at the end if any doctest errors occurred. (I'm right now not sure if `GLOBAL_ITER` etc. get printed, I only recall we should also print **either** `SAGE_TIMEOUT` **or** `SAGE_TIMEOUT_LONG`, whichever is appropriate, as many people seem to misunderstand the meaning and perhaps also don't know the defaults, which are btw. *wall* time and not CPU time -- perhaps subject to change later as well... :) .)

(A few `print` statements wouldn't complicate the patch *here* though. And if we print `SAGE_TESTDIR` anyway, we could at the same time change its default to a sensible value as well.)

Hmmm. Mitesh fixed some other things as well, so we should somehow make sure the changes don't get lost once this ticket is merged / closed. (I remember having reviewed them last year, before he updated the patch again though IIRC. I think Robert was also ok with his changes, except for the creation of directories / the temporary files' names and locations.)

Unfortunately, there are meanwhile *many* "concurrent" tickets dealing with the doctest scripts.

I'd of course also like to see my comments from the [inline patch to `sage-ptest` above](#comment%3A32) in it... ;-) (Just the comments, which are FIXMEs / TODOs, not [necessarily] the `flush()`s.)




I'll apply and take a look at your second patch later.

Hence underscores, which I originally thought of?

It doesn't make sense to copy [only] each single non-library file to doctest to the temporary directory anyway, as it might import other files located in the original directory.

We could either just `cd` to the original directory, or -- IMHO much better -- add the original directory to `PYTHONPATH` or `sys.path`, both methods solving the mangling issue in `from ... import *`, as well as saving useless copying. (We of course still have to create temporary preparsed files in `SAGE_TESTDIR/.../` for `.sage` and `.spyx` files though.)

Well, the host name could contain all sorts of characters in it, couldn't it?  Same for the directories in the path to the file, especially since we're talking about files not in the Sage library.  Doing some sort of regexp search and replace is a lot of work for perhaps minimal gain.  It certainly doesn't have to do with the issue on this ticket.

Outside the scope of this ticket.  If we leave that part alone, we're not creating a new bug, just leaving a less-than-perfect implementation in place.

Meanwhile, if you want to add in some print statements, comments, some of the relevant parts of Mitesh's patch, or anything else, go ahead.  I have to work on some other things for at least a few days.

Well, you don't have to mangle the name in the `import` statement at all (and the hostname is part of the *directory* name, not a filename, anyway).

> It certainly doesn't have to do with the issue on this ticket.

Of course it does. You tried to also mangle the `import` name to avoid name clashs, but that's simply not necessary. Just prepend the original (source) directory of the file to test to `PYTHONPATH`, and keep the [base]name of the file in `from ... import *` unmodified (and of course without a path). 

For files of the Sage library, we strip that path (at least Mitesh did), since all necessary (root) directories are already in `PYTHONPATH`.

The only "problem" are files that have to be preparsed (`*.sage`), at least if we don't want to create the intermediate, preparsed `.py` files at the original location, preferably just once.

For these files, we simply can do almost what Mitesh did, namely create a temporary file with an "arbitrary" (Python module name-conforming) but unique basename and the extension `.py` in `SAGE_TESTDIR` (from the perspective of `sage-doctest`, i.e. already containing the hostname and the pid of the parent process), using either `tempfile.mkstemp()` [which is safe here] or preferably just `sage-doctest`'s PID, import *that* in the `doctest_*` file, and also append it to `tmpfiles`:

```python
    # We are in "sage-doctest",
    # SAGE_TESTDIR is already ".../${hostname}-${ppid}/"
    ...
    if not library_code: 

        if ext in ['.pyx','.spyx']: 
            s += "cython(open('%s').read())\n\n" % file_name

        elif ext in ['.py', '.sage']: 

            source = file_name # full name with path
            target_name = "%s_%d" % (name, os.getpid()) # like 'name', but unique
            target_base = os.path.join(SAGE_TESTDIR, target_name) # like 'base', also unique

            if ext == '.sage':
                # Unfortunately, "sage -preparse <file>.sage" doesn't have any
                # output options and always creates <file>.py in the same
                # directory, so we first copy the *source* into SAGE_TESTDIR:
                os.system("cp '%s' %s.sage" % (source, target_base))
                # Now create SAGE_TESTDIR/<target_name>.py:
                os.system("sage -preparse %s.sage" % target_base)
                # Remove the copy of the original (.sage):
                # (We could also just add it to 'tmpfiles'.)
                os.system("rm -f %s.sage" % target_base)

            else:
                # Plain Python file (".py"), just copy it:
                # (If we added source's directory to PYTHONPATH,
                # we wouldn't have to copy the file, but then also
                # would have to import from 'name' instead of 'target_name'.)
                os.system("cp '%s' %s.py" % (source, target_base))

            s += "from %s import *\n\n" % target_name

            tmpfiles.append(target_base + ".py") # preparsed or copied original
            tmpfiles.append(target_base + ".pyc") # compiled version of it

    ...
```




A better solution, as Mitesh noted in the `TODO` comment, is to preparse the file into a string, and directly write that string into the `doctest_*` file where we currently have the `from ... import *`.

*That enhancement* is most probably a thing to do on a follow-up ticket, but not supporting (i.e. avoiding name clashes for) non-library files would be a regression w.r.t. Mitesh's patch.

See above. I there just copy the "main" file, which we still can change later.

As I said, I would have preferred having your patch based on Mitesh's, since there are a couple of changes that could have been kept, just changing the "mangling".

I can add a reviewer patch for *my comments* (and perhaps a few `print` statements) later; rebasing Mitesh's would be a lot of work and so I don't know if I'll do that.

Here is a patch based on Mitesh's; the "delta" patch shows the changes; these changes include your in-line patch.  This does not change SAGE_TESTDIR to `tempfile.gettempdir()`: we store timing information in this directory, so it should not be temporary.  It might be a good idea to change `TMP` (as used in `sage-ptest`) to a temporary directory, but I didn't make this change either, just added a comnent about it.

The changes: 
- the filename mangling uses the full path of the file rather than `tempfile.mkstemp`; this should be good enough, especially since we work in a directory with name determined by the pid and the hostname.
- there was one situation in which the temporary files stored in `tmpfiles` needed to be deleted but weren't; this was the case before any of the patches.
- there are now messages printed about the doctesting directory, and then deleting it at the end.

Who cares? ;-)

The odd thing with that is that we then again produce potential race conditions for the timing files. I think we'd have to use locking then (which can also cause headaches), perhaps on a follow-up.

Ok, see above; at least documented.

This doesn't help when simultaneously testing the same file from one `sage-ptest` instance (`SAGE_TEST_ITER`, `SAGE_TEST_GLOBAL_ITER`) if I'm not wrong; we could mangle **`sage-doctest`'s** PID into the *filename*, too, as I suggested above.

For readability, I'd move the `print` statements (*"Removing the directory ..."*, which hopefully don't raise exceptions) out of the `try` block.

Also, `sage-ptest` should know whether tests failed (or doctesting was interrupted), in which case we don't have to issue a warning since keeping the failed doctest files is intentional (and the left files should have been mentioned in previous messages).

So I wouldn't try to remove the directory if any doctests failed, unless they were [all] interrupted by Ctrl-C (in which case `sage-doctest` should immediately remove all temporary files belonging to the aborted doctest, which it currently doesn't).

---

Btw., unrelated to *this* ticket: `sage-doctest` shouldn't sleep for 0.1 seconds (and not continually poll the state of the child process) if the timeout is in seconds anyway; instead, it should use `signal.alarm()` and `wait()`.

True, theoretically, but I've never heard of this coming up.  I don't think these files are open for very long, so race conditions should be very rare.  I agree it should be dealt with on a follow-up, if at all.  (Instead of locking, we could perhaps use a "try ... except" block, since if two processes are trying to write to the same timing file, it's not a disaster if we just completely discard one of those.)

> IMHO these files also shouldn't be "hidden", and could live in or below `DOT_SAGE`

I thought about this when working on the most recent patch, but it was too much work for too little gain to make it backwards compatible (if `.ptest_timing...` exists, then read it, otherwise, look for `ptest_timing...`, etc.).  It could be done on another ticket.

That's a good point.

I can do that, or we can use `mkstemp` instead of or in addition to the path.  Opinions either way?

I wouldn't care much about backward compatibility in this case.

I'd prefer `sage-doctest`'s PID, appended (separated by an underscore) as [above](#comment%3A62).

The deletion upon Ctrl-C in `sage-doctest`; I just wouldn't try to remove the directory in `sage-ptest` if any error occurred (along with a perhaps confusing warning message).

I don't think we'll ever reach this, also because the addition of new features will never stop. So Sage's version number won't converge.

Do we also need to add this PID to the output from `filename_mangler`, in case someone is doctesting the same file in the Sage library several times simultaneously?

Regarding the timing files: I'm not touching that code, although I've added some comments.

Regarding deleting files on interruption: it's not clear how to easily determine whether there was an error before the interruption — do you need to use `post_process`? — so I'm just adding some comments and not touching the code.

Yes; you apparently already did so in the new patch.

But we actually don't have to mangle any path into the filename if we do that, since every file is tested by its own `sage-doctest` instance, in a directory unique to the host and the `sage-ptest` instance.

I can remove the pathname from the mangling. If we're just adding the pid, I may discard the function `filename_mangler` and deal with it like this:

```diff
-        f = os.path.splitext(filename_mangler(file))[0] + '.py'
+        f = os.path.join(SAGE_TESTDIR, "doctest_%s_%s.py" % (os.getpid(), name))
```
`filename_mangler` only gets used in this one place anyway.

Well, some library files can take a long time to doctest, so I can imagine someone doctesting a file, seeing that it fails and then interrupting it, but wanting to keep the temporary file for some reason.  (As I said, I'm not planning on modifying this code anyway.)

I'd prefer having the name first, then the PID; then we can also drop the `doctest_` prefix (because e.g. `1_module` is not a valid Python module name).

I think this way it's easier to locate a file (with `ls` or some file manager), since the files will be in alphabetical order, sorted by their original name (as opposed to some random PIDs).

> Shouldn't doctests delete the files they create afterwards anyway?

Examples in Sage code can create files anywhere in the filesystem, but they *should* only create temporary files or delete files after they're finished with them.  The directory SAGE_TMP gets cleaned up automatically, so it's a good choice, as opposed to SAGE_TESTDIR.

Replying to [@nexttime](#comment%3A77):
> Some minor things:

Okay. We seem to have used "%d" elsewhere in the file, not sure why I didn't this time.

>    * I think we should also (already) support the proper long option format, `--verbose`, there.

Oh, right, I misunderstood `opts`: I thought it was just the string of options instead of a list.

> * I would omit the "*Warning:*" in case (we know that) doctest errors occurred, since it is the desired behaviour to keep at least the failing files in that case.

Okay.

Looks like an enhancement for another ticket.

Ok. Just in case you were bored... Btw, it wouldn't be bad to put the full path of the original file into a comment of the generated doctest file either.

Ok.

I think we should create the same temporary directory (`$SAGE_TESTDIR/$hostname-$pid`) in `sage-test` as well (on this ticket), and export this in `SAGE_TESTDIR` for `sage-doctest`.

Also wouldn't be bad to put such common code into a separate module, before we "unify" (or unite) `sage-test` and `sage-ptest`.

Sorry for the delay.

I started testing the v2 yesterday, also with `make testlong`, which took ages, the latter unfortunately right before you made the v3, and later made a mistake when wanting to test v3, retesting v2 again... 8/

I've now also tested v3, with both sequential doctests (since we've modified `sage-doctest`, but not yet `sage-test`, except for a comment), and parallel tests with up to 128 threads.

I've reviewed the code already, so I can -- hopefully finally -- give this a **positive review**. (At least until something unexpected happens; I must admit I haven't tested the latest versions with non-library code yet.)

Thanks for spending so much time on this.

Well, Dave wanted this (the former), at least when we started here last year... ;-)

I've added a comment there w.r.t. also using unique directories when testing sequentially, since there might be multiple instances running at the same time.




> I really don't want to add any more to this ticket unless there is an extremely good reason to do so.

Ok, agreed. This ticket has really been dragging enough.




By the way, you were right; `opts` is a *string* (of the concatenated options) there, as opposed to a list of strings, so `"-verbose" in opts` would have been enough. But it works this way, too, and is IMHO nothing worth fixing again *here*.

Also, or on the other hand, I don't think anybody will ever use `--verbose` when doctesting in parallel, since the output would be totally messed up, unless one uses `sage -tp 1 ...` (or `make NUM_THREADS=1 ...`, which is also useful in some cases.
