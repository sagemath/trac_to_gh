**NOTE:** This ticket has been replaced by #12299 

Ready for testing.

For inclusion in new Flask notebook see [enhanced Jmol in Flask](http://code.google.com/r/gutow-flask/). Note that all fixes and enhancements to the Jmol interface from SageDays 31 are in the Flask version and not this ticket. The Jmol changes for the Flask notebook should be included in the Flask spkg soon. See #11080.

Setting this up on your own copy of Sage requires two steps.  Starting with a clean Sage 4.6.2 (for 4.7+ skip step 1): 


1. Patch for Jmol at the command line (not for 4.7+). See [#9232](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/9232).
2. Apply the .spkg to get the new Jmol ` ./sage -f "http://www.uwosh.edu/faculty_staff/gutow/Jmol_for_SageNoteBook-1.1.6.spkg"`
3. Apply the following patches in order (not necessary for Flask): [attachment: trac_9238_interactive_js.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9238/trac_9238_interactive_js.patch.gz), [attachment: trac_9238-add-help.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9238/trac_9238-add-help.patch.gz) , [attachment: trac_9238_jmol_lib_async.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9238/trac_9238_jmol_lib_async.patch.gz),  [attachment: trac_9238_memory_IE.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9238/trac_9238_memory_IE.patch.gz) and [attachment: trac_9238_nice_IE_warnings.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9238/trac_9238_nice_IE_warnings.patch.gz). These are best applied using the hg_sagenb.apply(...) command within sage.
4. Apply the patch (not necessary for 4.7+) [attachment: Trac_9238_script_extension.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9238/Trac_9238_script_extension.patch.gz) using the hg_sage.apply(...) command within sage.   Exit sage and run a ` ./sage -b`.

I have addressed the following issues (let me know if I've missed anything): 


* Addition of the ability to hide the "advanced controls".
* Fix so that the advanced controls are hidden when the applet is asleep (no accidental calls to nonexistent applets).
* Fix to issue of not properly loading all applets when a worksheet  with a lot of applets is reopened (please check this one carefully).
* Fixes to vocabulary and labels to make things clearer.
* Hidden the  div with the State in it.  (Still there b/c I hope to be able to  recreate the way the user left it on close, rather than starting fresh  each time.)
* Fix to loading pages with many Jmols hanging. (FF on MacOS just doesn't work reliably or reproducibly so I put up a warning and suggest they switch to Chrome).
* Workaround for bug in MacOS Safari that causes hang when trying to get a static image to sleep an applet if more than 9 applets in a worksheet (I believe this is a memory leak problem).
* Tested extensively on Linux with FF and Chromium and on MacOS with Safari, Chrome and FF.  Works well with both linux browsers and with Chrome on MacOS.  MacOS/Safari is usable, MacOS FF is not.
* Lowered memory requirements for Jmol.  This improves performance in Safari for many applets.
* Many advanced controls do not work with IE/win.  Provide warning and suggest using Chrome, which does work.  Those that fail do so quietly.  Sleeping and controlling function color do work.

Happy testing and thank you to those who do test!

Jason,

Thanks!!! I forgot about that.  Yes, for all of this to work you need to use Jmol 11.8.  The latest release.  Should I add a .zip of the necessary applet files to the trac?

Is that file still needed?  I think it probably makes jmol work from the command line for us.

No, you won't - pesky "someone else has already edited this page"!!!

Jonathan,

Sweet.  Great work!

Some comments upon a very small amount of testing (which is all I have time for right now).  I apologize for their telegraphic nature.

Popup 3dviewer is great.

Functions tab did not immediately have something in it, I had to click "request...", which is nonintuitive.  I understand if that step is necessary, but the message could be better; as it is, the person using it wouldn't necessarily realize that this would give mesh etc. info for each object (nice to do it separately, so so so nice).

Colorpicker in Functions tab: awesome.  

Initial size Small might be good for iPhone (if Jmol even works there?) but is a little on the small side for normal laptop/PC web browsing.   Can the browsing thing be detected for this?

There is an awful lot of space given to the info, not so much to the actual graphic.  Would it be possible to put that stuff below the image as opposed to on the right?  In fact, that stuff should not necessarily resize with the graphic...

State is cool for those of us who might want to access it, but it should default (when clicked upon) to creating a slider or something, or "click here for full" or something like that.  Otherwise the potential for really upsetting work flow is there, it changes the window size so much.

Sleep/Wake works great, might be nice to CSS those words into something less \texttt{}-ish.  Note that "Arbitrarily resizable in own window Get static image to save" looks like one command; maybe some <ul></ul> useful here?

Didn't break any old worksheets, though they all have this new little Jmol double window now, which makes sense.

This may be unrelated, but the axes seem to be in the wrong spots, at least in 

```
var('y')
P=plot3d(x^2+y^2,(x,-3,3),(y,-3,3))
Q=plot3d(sin(x^2+y^2),(x,-3,3),(y,-3,3))
show(P+Q)
```

I did *not* get to test having billions of applets open at the same time, unfortunately, but will be happy to do so if no one else can over the next week or two.  

One really interesting thing is this.  We had complaints about the snappiness of 3D interacts recently, but now I get almost instantaneous recomputation with 'small', which is great.  However

```
TypeError: Result of expression '(stateStr.match(re_modelinline))' [null] is not an object.
```
occurs if I change the size in an interact, and then move the slider.  Obviously, other things don't stay the same with an interact - say if I change one function to green, it goes back to blue after moving the slider, but there shouldn't be the error message (ideally).

But thank you!  This would be a big improvement.  Looking forward to being able to evaluate it properly - clearly a big change needs big testing.

You are correct that I could not originally get the information from Jmol on load because of timing issues.  I have an idea about this and will work on it a little.  In the meantime, I think you are correct that we need better instructions in this tab.

We use it for other Jmol stuff, but it was originally inspired by the needs of SAGE.

That is likely to be a SAGE python bug as Jmol just draws lines where SAGE tells it to.  I will double check the parsing, but since the axes look correct for everything I've tried, I'm guessing something funny is passed to Jmol.

This is because I switched to using the incrementally loaded applet.  Thus only the parts needed are loaded.  This significantly reduces load time.

Is that completely reproducible?  I've seen it occasionally when javascript gets executed before the applets are completely loaded.  However, I've never seen any ill effects since things get reset later.  If it causes problems and you can pin it down, let me know.

Thanks for the initial testing.

Please check to see if the following two files are in the directory
sage/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sagenb-0.8-py2.6.egg/sagenb/data/jmol

Jmol.jar & Jmol (a shell script).

If they are not then try downloading the .spkg again to see if that fixes it.

If the files are there then there is something we don't understand or the path in the Jmol shell script is wrong.

I've figured out how to make an spkg that only changes the files pertinent to Jmol.  Using this .spkg we should be able to test it against different versions of the notebook.  The only notebook specific file that is change is notebook_lib.js.  If using a notebook with changes to this file since Sage-4.4.3 a merge should be performed rather than a straight .spkg install.

I've have tried to address some of the issues mentioned above.  I still suggest installing to a test system.  A public example of this will also be available on my server (link to follow, once installed).

Version 1.1 of Jmol for Sage.  Install with command

sage -f http://www.uwosh.edu/faculty_staff/gutow/Jmol_for_SageNoteBook-1.1.spkg

or

./sage -f http://www.uwosh.edu/faculty_staff/gutow/Jmol_for_SageNoteBook-1.1.spkg

depending on your command line syntax.

I'm also updating the ticket to show this instead of the first version.

You beat me to finishing the update to the trac ticket.  Everything has been moved to the notebook google site.  This will not work with the latest release as the location of the notebook code has changed.  This .spkg will not properly update 4.6.1.

See http://code.google.com/p/sagenb/issues/detail?id=1  for details of what works with 4.6.1.  I will now finish updating this trac.

I have to say, though it now works, I'm still a little mystified, because the 'click to own 3d window' just gives a blank window (the Jmol doesn't appear, except brief Jmol logo), and if you click 'wake up' when it's already awake, it disappears too.  I wonder if they are related.  

But this will make it quite easy to review, at any rate, and hopefully that is just something silly I did.  This was with 4.6.2.alpha0.

Here's a totally random (well, almost) question related to Jmol...  currently, I don't think we have a way of arranging several Jmols (or indeed any 3D graphics) in an array of some sort.  See [this ask.sagemath.org question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/335/multiple-3d-plots-in-one-panel-graphics_array-and).

Well, of course it would be best if you could update the sagenb package.  But if you aren't familiar with HG, you shouldn't necessarily have to do this.  

The problem is that after sagenb became its own spkg, for a while there was a lot of activity and it was easy to update, but now the sagenb folks are much more dormant (with respect to sagenb, not in general) so one has to do this on one's own.  I hope to get some help making this spkg, though, and get people to test it/test it myself.

   * All changes are committed.
   * .hgignore and MANIFEST.in are current.
   * The patch queue is clear.
   * The notebook runs.
   * The doctests pass: sage -t -sagenb
   * Test for ability to install without internet connection.
     Any dependencies that must be downloaded can be added in ./spkg-dist and in
serted
     in setup.py. Dependencies of dependencies need not be put in setup.py, but
     need to be put in ./spkg-dist.
   * The Selenium tests pass (optional, for now).

   Then,

   * Update the version in setup.py and commit this change.
   * Run spkg-dist.
   * Install and test the new spkg: sage -f dist/sagenb-*.spkg

Jason,

Thanks for all the comments.  I am still running a time deficit at the moment.  So probably cannot address any of these immediately.  Which are blockers?  If I know what to start on I may be able to squeeze a little time in between reviews and grading this week.

1)I think I know how to fix the issue with clicking links with sleeping applets.
2) The firefox problem cannot be fixed until the notebook passes information properly.  A number of things work poorly in FF on MacOS because the twisted server adds some html header information to files that are not html.  I've reported this as a bug long ago.  I don't know enough about the server to fix it easily.
3) Except for putting things in the right click menu most of your interface requests are doable.  How about a button that changes between an advanced options interface and a minimalist interface, rather than making them part of the right click menu?

I developed this on Linux, so this will work on Linux installs with a JVM that Jmol works in.  We only test against the Oracle/Sun JVM.

> * at least SOME testing with a VM, if possible before release (?)
> * A new sagenb package, though that wouldn't be needed for positive review of this, it would just be needed for actually incorporating it :)

OK.  Thanks for testing.  Two things:
1) I'm grading exams this weekend, but will try to look at this.
2) In order to look at what you are looking at I need to understand how I get things out of the mercurial system.  On a linux distro what would I need to set up?  

On the command line stuff.  We've had trouble because different operating systems use different protocols for opening java applications.  If you actually have a copy of the Jmol.jar (not JmolApplet.jar) then I will need more details about OS and so on.  This may relate to the fact that the location of the notebook code has changed.  I will look at that.

OK, I've traced the path issue with Jmol not launching from the command line.  There is an error in the path in the .jmol file created by SAGE.  Does anybody remember where in the code this is generated for the command line (not notebook)?  The issue is that  extra /'s are put into the path. (eg. ~/.sage//temp/..." instead of ~/.sage/temp/...".  If I can find where this is done in the code I can fix it.

I'm not sure, but I think that 

```
sage: P = point3d((1,0,0))
sage: P.export_jmol?
```
might have what you are looking for.  I don't think it's the whole story, because I don't see the type of filename (including the size 500) that Jason is reporting, but at least it's a start.

Oh, and 

```

sage: search_src('jmol','size')
plot/plot3d/base.pyx:988:           figsize[0]. This is ignored for the jmol embedded renderer.
plot/plot3d/implicit_surface.pyx:69:# vertex_color/jmol_color), and output of size about n^2.
plot/plot3d/shapes2.py:750:        return ["draw %s DIAMETER %s {%s %s %s}\n%s" % (name, int(self.size), cen[0], cen[1], cen[2], self.texture.jmol_str('$' + name))]
server/notebook/cell.py:2246:                # If F ends in -size500.jmol then we make the viewer applet with size 500.
server/notebook/cell.py:2266:                #script = '<script>jmol_applet(%s, "%s");</script>%s' % (size, url, popup)
server/notebook/cell.py:2269:                script = '<div><script>jmol_applet(%s, "%s?%d");</script></div>' % (size, url, time.time())
```
suggests that maybe it's in server/notebook/cell.py, which is a little surprising, but line 2259 pretty much seals the deal:

```
                    jmol_script = jmol_script.replace('defaultdirectory "', 'defaultdirectory "' + self.url_to_self() + '/')
```
That looks like what you are describing.  Why is this called for non-notebook usage?

            # We need a script to load the file
            f = open(filename + '.jmol', 'w')

Somehow the building of "archive_name" is getting messed up.  I'm suspicious of 
 filename = sage.misc.misc.tmp_filename()
near the top or
 base, ext = os.path.splitext(filename)
in the viewer=='jmol' block.

Yeah, we had this problem with some of the temp files in e.g. R interface before.

As to the Python temp files, this is the system-wide `SAGE_TMP`, so you'd have to ask whoever wrote that why they didn't use builtin Python stuff - probably William or Tom or someone in prehistory...

I successfully used os.path.join, but to no avail when it comes to the zapping.

In fact, after much playing around with this, I don't think it's the issue.  Remember the error message:

```
unrecognized file format for file /Users/grout/.sage/temp/<MYCOMPUTERNAME>/79036/tmp_0-size500.jmol

set defaultdirectory "/Users/grout/.sage/temp/<MYCOMPUTERNAME>/79036//tmp_0-size500.jmol.zip"

script SCRIPT
```
So jmol, while running, clearly resolves the // to /, otherwise it wouldn't give the correct error message.  (When the directory no longer existed, I got a !java.io.FileNotFoundException, quite different.)   And the directory that pops open when you use the open button is the correct directory.

So perhaps it's the 'unrecognized file format' that's the problem, in the sense of an unrecognized file format.   I'm continuing to dig; it seems that jmol's file recognizer/resolver is where the exception is thrown.

{
    "body": "<div id=\"comment:91\" align=\"right\">Comment 91</div>\n\nUnfortunately, I can't afford to spend any more time on this, knowing as little about Jmol and Java as I do.

<div id="comment:91" align="right">Comment 91</div>

Unfortunately, I can't afford to spend any more time on this, knowing as little about Jmol and Java as I do.  Here is some of the investigating I did, which *may* be useful - hopefully it will be.  I suspect that there is something very subtle that changed in the newer Jmol (there have been changes) to this resolving business, and somehow the difference between the applet being used and just the standalone Jmol viewer must be involved.  

The changes made in `EMBEDDED_MODE=True` and the notebook code should not make a difference; the only substantive ones are that there is something random in the filename for the notebook, and the notebook rewrites the .jmol file to get the full url for the cell (as opposed to the full path to the file in the other case).  Neither of these should make a difference, right?

* When Jmol looks to resolve the file, it 'smartly' actually reads the file and looks at the contents to see if it's one of a variety of accepted formats.
* The code for this is [here](http://prodata.swmed.edu/CASP9/evaluation/jmol/src/org/jmol/adapter/smarter/Resolver.java), among other places (hopefully this isn't too old of a version - sadly, the sourceforge site requires one to download code, not browse, so this could all be based on something incorrect).
* The only place there that this message occurs is in the following code, which means the !determineAtomSetCollectionReader has returned something with a newline character:

```
    } else {
      atomSetCollectionReaderName = determineAtomSetCollectionReader(
          bufferedReader, true);
      if (atomSetCollectionReaderName.indexOf("\n") >= 0)
        errMsg = "unrecognized file format for file " + fullName + "\n"
            + atomSetCollectionReaderName;
<snip>
    if (errMsg != null) {
      bufferedReader.close();
      return errMsg;
    }
```
* Since the error message which is returned is the thing that Jason cut and pasted for us, you'll notice that the contents of our .jmol file itself is the output of the !determineAtomSetCollectionReader - so no surprise there is a `\n`, since after going through all the possible things, it returns the first several lines of the file, with `\n` in between lines.

```
    return (returnLines ? "\n" + lines[0] + "\n" + lines[1] + "\n" + lines[2] + "\n" : null);
```
* Of course, why this would work fine in the notebook AND when loading from the open window is completely mystifying to me.

But I think that we try not to track them because they are all binaries and we can't directly access them - hence the new spkg.\n\nOn  my machine I set it up to have hg track those files.  The patch I made does list them as being added or changed, but the binaries are not included, just the file names.  Thus the patch won't work.  I gather from what you are saying, an .spkg is the only way.  I can do that.  It will take a little time to reconfigure so that it is only updating the binary files.  The rest can be put in as a patch so it will be tracked properly.

Any ideas as to what was going on with that?\n\nThere was a bug in the version of Jmol things were originally written for, which meant the default lighting was fullylit (despite being documented as otherwise).  To update SAGE to a newer Jmol this needs to be accounted for.  The fix I put in is temporary.  I would like use a more complete and up-to-date file format for the generated .jmol files, but first I want to have basic stuff working.

> Hmm, those files are not being tracked by HG.  Otherwise any changes would be recorded, even binary ones.   But I think that we try not to track them because they are all binaries and we can't directly access them - hence the new spkg.

On  my machine I set it up to have hg track those files.  The patch I made does list them as being added or changed, but the binaries are not included, just the file names.  Thus the patch won't work.  I gather from what you are saying, an .spkg is the only way.  I can do that.  It will take a little time to reconfigure so that it is only updating the binary files.  The rest can be put in as a patch so it will be tracked properly.  (I'm getting less enthusiastic about hg...svn would  handle this with no problem).

> If the `isosurface fullylit; pmesh o* fullylit; set antialiasdisplay on;` stuff is just to fix the lighting in general, we could get that in a lot more quickly by simply opening another ticket, since it doesn't require a new SageNB package.  I *have* noticed that the top of surfaces was not well lit, as opposed to the bottom... but only in the notebook, not the command line, weirdly.  That part of this patch fixes that.  Any ideas as to what was going on with that?

There was a bug in the version of Jmol things were originally written for, which meant the default lighting was fullylit (despite being documented as otherwise).  To update SAGE to a newer Jmol this needs to be accounted for.  The fix I put in is temporary.  I would like use a more complete and up-to-date file format for the generated .jmol files, but first I want to have basic stuff working.  Notebook vs command line depends on which version of the jmol_lib.js you have.  This fix is also in there.

Changing the extension doesn't work out-of-the-box because of bugs in some versions of Jmol.  12.0.35 is the first 12.0.x series I could get this working with.  There are some newer versions, but the menu system has been damaged, so I am avoiding anything newer until we get that fixed.

Attachment: **[trac_9238_interactive_js.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9238/trac_9238_interactive_js.patch.gz)**

Ready for testing, but requires two steps.  Starting with a clean Sage 4.6.2:

1. patch for Jmol at the command line. See [#9232](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/9232).
2. Apply the patch trac_9238_interactive_js.patch above.

I have addressed the following issues (let me know if I've missed anything):

* Addition of the ability to hide the "advanced controls".
* Fix so that the advanced controls are hidden when the applet is asleep (no accidental calls to nonexistent applets).
* Fix to issue of not properly loading all applets when a worksheet with a lot of applets is reopened (please check this one carefully).
* Fixes to vocabulary and labels to make things clearer. 
* Hidden the div with the State in it.  (Still there b/c I hope to be able to recreate the way the user left it on close, rather than starting fresh each time.)

Happy testing and thank you to those who do test!

Okay, I experimented, and the change from angstrom to square root of umlaut O (which I think causes the problem) happens during the exporting of a patch.  See the sample I'm uploading next.  SO what needs to happen is for the sagenb package to 'manually' add this file, rather than by importing a patch, I guess?

Given Jonathan's comments, this could be some kind of Unicode bug on Mac...

It appears that there are still some java memory issues if you have a lot of applets open and try to use the popup window that gives you a resizing view.  One possibility might be to sleep all applets in the main window when this is used.  I see this problem as not displaying the functions if the window is too big.

This is on Mac OS X.  With Safari 5.0.4 it doesn't seem to work at all, and does nothing bad.  With FF 3.6 it works, but has the same problems I mention somewhere above regarding the images not really fitting properly into the window.

I think this is a small enough issue - only for certain window sizes and shapes - that it shouldn't block anything.

However, on FF if I pop it out, sometimes nothing at all shows up.  And in fact, just now it completely froze FF - as far as I know there weren't too many applets open, I just asked for it to pop up one too many times, maybe.

Is it possible that the extra applets from resizable pop-up windows could hog more Java memory than is supposed to be allowed? 

Sorry, that's the thing you just mentioned in your last comment.   Yes, I agree that something should be done with that.  It seems reasonable to perhaps sleep all applets in the main window except the same one, or maybe the last two.  

In fact, I wouldn't mind reducing from five 'awake' applets to four.   Anyway, this needs to be at least somewhat resolved, so 'needs work' for now.

Replying to [@kcrisman](#comment%3A120):

I'm inclined to just remove the pop-up window initially.  I can keep working on it, but here are the issues:

* I haven't been able to get anything working reliably in FF 3.X (and 4.0) on MacOS if the user is logged in.  I only get reliable applets that load if the worksheets are published.  I did a little sniffing around and found that the twisted server appends html header information to the script files with MacOS FF when the user is logged in.  I would need to do more investigating to provide a detailed bug report.  You can reproduce this by going to the example ([3-D Jmol examples](http://141.233.197.45:8888/home/pub/0)) and logging into the Test account (password: testing). I don't think this is the cause of the pop-up problem. 
* The pop-up symptoms imply a JavaVM memory problem.  If you shrink the popup window down you will eventually get to a size where the image will display.  Unfortunately, different systems have different amounts of memory for the JavaVM, so it is very hard to predict how things will work.  I may be able to plug into the applet available memory information, but that will be somewhat involved, so not a rapid fix.
* In short the server needs to be fixed before I can chase FF on MacOS problems.  I can address problems for FF on linux and windows, Webkit browsers (Safari) on MacOS, linux and windows.

Okay, here are my recommendations.
* To ensure good memory usage for many systems, reduce the number of 'awake' applets at any one time by one, to four.  Eventually this could be user-customizable, I suppose.
* Remove the pull-down menu that says "3-D display size:" with different pixel sizes, as it either doesn't work or produces poor results.  In addition, at least in my testing on your server just now, I can't get the applet to sleep after I use that menu!  Pop-out still works in that case, though.
* If it's not too hard, you could have the applets in main window sleep when you do a pop-out, except for the one you popped out (an instructor might want that smaller view immediately available after closing the pop-out window).

Otherwise I'm fine.

I think the pop-up windows are ok, actually.  It's a nice feature.  I have no problems making them when logged in.

I'm going to test this on Safari again now, on an older Mac with FF, and then with IE and FF on my Windows Parallels.

OK, I now see something like this in FF if I have lots of things (not just applets) open in FF 3.6.  I'm guessing another browser memory issue.  Doesn't reproduce in FF 4, which was just released.

Uh-Oh!  This is inconsistent behavior please post your MacOS, FF and JavaVM version #'s.

What I am seeing now is extra things appended to the filename sent to Jmol (I'd have to start a sniffer to check out the header stuff I've seen before).  So instead of a filename like "/home/Test/0/cells/1/sage0-size500.jmol" being passed to Jmol something like this is passed "/home/Test/0/cells/1/sage0-size500.jmol?1300976412".  So Jmol cannot find the data as that file doesn't exist.  Are you sure you don't see blank Jmols when you open the examples in FF when logged in to my example server?

Proper behavior is what I've seen with webkit browsers on MacOS and Linux.  Things work fine with FF on Linux as well.

The change in placement of the "on" checkbox for color can be changed.

Hmm.  I have 10.6.7, FF 3.6.13, Jmol menu says I have Apple Java !1.6.0_24.

This time, it just totally froze FF.  Yes, blank Jmols.  But like I said, that didn't happen an hour ago.

On the very old slow one (<1 GHz, FF 3.6.14), it was achingly slow, but no problems.

Until I requested a function or something weird too early.  There must be some bad memory handling on FF 3.6 on Mac, maybe.  But the thing you are describing is not what I am seeing; certainly not trouble finding the Jmols themselves.

> But now we're both seeing that logged in users can't use FF (by the way I've seen this problem for a number of years even without any updates to Jmol or the notebook).  Can we recommend against using FF on MacOS as it doesn't work reliably anyway?

No.  Way too many users default to FF on Mac OS, IIRC.

I tested this again on your server on two different Macs.  On the very old slow one (<1 GHz, FF 3.6.14), it was achingly slow, but no problems.  On my nice new one, I actually keep being able to freeze FF 3.6.13 with a wrong click here or there, but in general it worked; I didn't have empty Jmols.

In fact, the only empty Jmols I saw were ones that were just waiting to be seen; once I waited a little bit, they appeared.  Until I requested a function or something weird too early.  There must be some bad memory handling on FF 3.6 on Mac, maybe.  But the thing you are describing is not what I am seeing; certainly not trouble finding the Jmols themselves.  Can you borrow a colleague's Mac with FF to test this?

> I'm testing against 10.6.6, but otherwise the same as you. (also just tested FF 3.6.14-same results). This gives me a little to go on, but I fear if we choose to call this a blocker we will be waiting for a significant notebook rewrite.  I could put in a browser check that pops up an alert for MacOS users telling them to use Safari if they have problems.

I think that's not a bad idea.   As soon as a Java/Jmol is detected, if one has FF+Mac, the script for Jmol to the browser gives a little alert.  This shouldn't be default; lots of people use Sage without ever touching 3D plotting, and it could be confusing.

Makes sense.

> I tested this again on your server on two different Macs.  On the very old slow one (<1 GHz, FF 3.6.14), it was achingly slow, but no problems.  [snip. Can you borrow a colleague's Mac with FF to test this?

I'm in charge of about 30 computers for my department.  I've tried it on many of them with the same results.

> > I could put in a browser check that pops up an alert for MacOS users telling them to use Safari if they have problems.

So here are my priorities:

1. Lower # of live Jmols (easy, I've got a place to do that.)
2. Check Browser/OS combination before launch of first Jmol.  Pop alert if FF+MacOS.  Should I only do this for logged in users or always?
3. Sleep all (or all but one) Jmol applet when pop-up Jmol is activated.

I'm just about to the end of my school break so I want to work on the highest priority things now.  Things will proceed much more slowly starting next week.

<div id="comment:1" align="right">Comment 1</div>

This really bothers me.  It is very inconsistent.  I did find a MacOS machine running FF3.3.  It sort of works.  Shows the same problem with the resizing applet, but will load most of a multiapplet notebook page when logged in.

If I can get the browser check working properly I will hide the pull-down menu only for the MacOS FF combination, since I don't think we've seen problems with it in any other cases.

I'll try to do some checking on some of our IE equipped machines tomorrow.

Yeah, I think my Safari problems with the pull-down menu must have been memory problems.

IE 7 doesn't work at all with Jmol, but even on XP it was no problem to upgrade to IE 8 and it worked ok there, except the "Toggle Advanced Controls" button didn't work at all.  Which means the functionality is the same as it was before, which is ok, I guess.

<div id="comment:133" align="right">Comment 133</div>

The IE problem probably reflects IE not using standard javascript.  MS programmers seem to think they should use a different syntax than the  one agreed upon in the standards.  I will look into that.

I've sort of reproduced the Safari problem.  I've traced it to a js call in the standard Jmol.js package, which is rather odd.  That stuff is very well tested.  One possibility is that I've lost track of the appropriate applet names somehow in jmol_lib.js.

Some ideas for using less memory and getting more success loading multiple applets:

* Don't turn on the antialiasing of the display.  Convert to an option in the applet tab with a warning that it uses more memory which may cause problems when lots of applets are used on one worksheet. (Displays will not be as nice, but uses about 1/2 the memory.  Static images will still be pretty).
* set repaintWaitMs >1000 to allow more time for complex images to be drawn by applet.
* set undo FALSE to save memory used for undo/redo in the console
* make rough estimates of memory usage based on # of surfaces and size of each applet.  Use this to decide how many applets to keep alive...probably wouldn't help with the Safari problem which seems to occur after some amount of memory has been given to applets, even when later freed up.

I didn't even realize there was an undo/redo function.  Maybe we could turn it off, since there probably isn't a huge amount of scripting going on with Sage 3d plots.

Things are a little bit of a mess because of the potential for flask changeover in SageNB.  What do people think of this?
1. #9232 is used just for adding Volker's patch.  No sagenb change needed.
2. Jonathan's patches there for the menu, help, and surface lighting/spt files are moved to this ticket.
3. All the stuff here become part of the flask notebook changeover, and henceforth the property of those doing that :)

+1 to turning off antialiasing (which is what we have currently with our old version of Jmol, right?) until we figure out that white sparkle issue with gridlines.

In Sage, you have jqueryui; I wonder if using a toggle button from jqueryui might be more cross-platform, if we're not using it now.

I cannot get everything working in IE.   I don't think we should hold things up for that.  I've made all the advanced features available in IE, some just fail quietly.  IE users get a dialog suggesting they use Chrome or FF until this is fixed.  IE (8 at least) is doing something funny.  Things that work once on a page often don't work again!

So I suggest this is ready for review.  I have had to change the patch sequence a little bit because of things removed from ticket #9232.  During testing please try this on a clean 4.6.2 to make sure I didn't miss anything.

-* To just play with and comment on the changes to the Jmol interface in the notebook go to: [3-D Jmol examples](http://141.233.197.45:8888/home/pub/0).  If you want to try your own you can log into the one account on this wimpy server (!username:Test, password: testing).
 
 Setting this up on your own copy of Sage requires two steps.  Starting with a clean Sage 4.6.2 (for 4.7+ skip step 1): 
 
 
 1. Patch for Jmol at the command line (not for 4.7+). See [#9232](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/9232).
 2. Apply the .spkg to get the new Jmol ` ./sage -f "http://www.uwosh.edu/faculty_staff/gutow/Jmol_for_SageNoteBook-1.1.6.spkg"`

Some nitpicks with spkg-install in http://www.uwosh.edu/faculty_staff/gutow/Jmol_for_SageNoteBook-1.1.7.spkg

1. Delete all the commented out code from spkg-install.  It is *not* comments, but code that makes no sense now.  It just makes it harder to read spkg-install.  The original code is in the hg history, anyways.

2. You use "cp -v" near the bottom, but this is not POSIX compliant, e.g., on Solaris we have:

```
wstein@t2:~$ touch a
wstein@t2:~$ cp -v a b
cp: illegal option -- v
Usage: cp [-f] [-i] [-p] [-@] f1 f2
       cp [-f] [-i] [-p] [-@] f1 ... fn d1
       cp -r|-R [-H|-L|-P] [-f] [-i] [-p] [-@] d1 ... dn-1 dn
```

(Yep, I learned something from David Kirkby.)

I don't think that's dense.  It is confusing.  This ticket reflects the development before the Flask notebook.  As I was told we were switching over to Flask ASAP, I stopped working on things in the old version of the notebook.  However, I think this ticket belongs for people who want to incorporate an updated Jmol into pre-Flask versions of Sage.  Plus, I think it is good to lead people to the Flask version.

The .spkgs here would not install Jmol properly for setups that have made modifications as per #11503.  Should we say something about that?

I think that having instructions (for instance, that #11503 can be done after this, but not the other way around) would be appropriate...

I've tested some of the features of this ticket on vanilla sage-4.7.2.alpha2 and I have some questions. I installed Jmol_for_SageNoteBook-1.1.6.spkg and applied the patches

<div id="comment:173" align="right">Comment 173</div>

First, take note of the first paragraph of this ticket.  Because this involves working with the notebook interface all development since June 2011 has been on the Flask notebook version.  That means the package and patches here have not been updated since about 4.7.1.  They are up primarily so that people using 4.7.1 and older can get the controls that allow changing the display of surfaces.  Development has been limited to the Flask version of the notebook.  I have very limited time to work on this (I'm a chemistry professor), but if the Flask notebook is going to be severely delayed could try to package a version to work with the older notebook.  If you really want to test this you should test it in a Flask install (see the appropriate tickets).

That said your concerns about the patch warnings are valid.  I did not know that any of it had been folded into 4.7.2.  This is odd.

The pop-up warnings are because your server connection is relatively slow.  The notebook now allows about 15 seconds for an applet to load.  If it hasn't loaded by that time, one of these warnings pops up.  The idea is to provide some feedback when it takes a long time to load.  The reason for the async load code is that worksheets with lots of applets in them can overwhelm the browsers if too many applets try to load simultaneously.  This code requires them to load sequentially and limits worksheets to 4 running Jmol applets at a time.  Those that are not running are replaced with a picture and a button to wake them.  The primary reason for this is constraints on the memory available for applets within browsers.  The async code is for all browsers.  There are warnings associated with specific browsers that we have had difficulty with (e.g. MS IE and certain versions of FF and Safari).

If your worksheets worked without the async code, that suggests you were: 1) lucky; 2) had only one or very few applets in your worksheet.  If your worksheet did not work at all with the async code could you package it up so that we could test it in the latest code? Thanks.

Does this answer your questions?  I think the key message is that without more work on my part the enhanced Jmol interface may be tied to the Flask notebook.

Replying to [@gutow](#comment%3A173):

> First, take note of the first paragraph of this ticket.  Because this involves working with the notebook interface all development since June 2011 has been on the Flask notebook version.  That means the package and patches here have not been updated since about 4.7.1.  They are up primarily so that people using 4.7.1 and older can get the controls that allow changing the display of surfaces.  Development has been limited to the Flask version of the notebook.  I have very limited time to work on this (I'm a chemistry professor), but if the Flask notebook is going to be severely delayed could try to package a version to work with the older notebook.

No problem relative to time since things are rather busy here now too.

I did not know that any of it had been folded into 4.7.2.  This is odd. The pop-up warnings are because your server connection is relatively slow.

```
x,y=var('x y'); plot3d( 4*x*exp(-x^2-y^2), (x,-2,2), (y,-2,2) )

I get four active applets and six that are sleeping. However, things are faster without the patch. The following code

I would be nice to know if the same behavior is present in the flask-notebook. I could do this but it would take some time. Hopefully, the code I've provided can be easily tested by someone that has the flask stuff in place.

Thanks for your feedback. It has caused me to look more carefully at what I've been doing. FWIW, the jmol issue surfaced in using the sage-on-gentoo port of Sage. There jmol has been outside the notebook for some time. But only recently, with jmol-12.0.45 and the patches of this ticket, have things started to act up. There is, not yet, a flask-notebook in sage-on-gentoo. And I'm guessing it won't be in sage-on-gentoo until it appears in Sage first. Therefore my ramblings here have been an attempt to determine whether vanilla Sage with the present notebook has the same issues as I have with sage-on-gentoo. It seems it does.

Thanks for the code snippets.  I have run them through a system with most of our latest patches in the flask version.  They do not seem to be problematic.  I had no trouble with a worksheet using your second (no-frame) example with 12 duplicates in a worksheet.  It does take a while to work its way back to the top from the 12th applet (about 25 seconds using my slow home connection).  This was a relatively severe test as the whole connection is encrypted as well, which slows things down further.  I did get a warning pop-up while the system was waiting for me to OK trusting the applet over the encrypted connection when I evaluated the first cell.  Once this was done things worked rapidly each time I evaluated an additional cell, because the applet was cached.

Does that sound like I checked everything?

Based on this test, I think I need to try to create a version of the patches that match the latest changes incorporated into the flask notebook, but can be applied to 4.7.2. I may have time this weekend.

I just found something.  Is this what you are describing?  I don't see it all the time, but I did manage to make it happen once, so should be able to trace it.  

1) Make a worksheet with lots of cells that evaluate to produce a jmol plot.

2) Do either of the following:

    a) select "delete all output", then select "evaluate all"

    b) select "evaluate all" without first deleting the output

3) What I see sometimes is that one of the applets does not load and then many of the cells do not evaluate to a jmol applet.  They can be recovered by manually clicking the evaluate button.
