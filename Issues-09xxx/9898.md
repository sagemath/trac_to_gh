Ok, I've now also tested this with Sage 4.6.alpha1 and #9876 (PARI 2.4.3.svn-12577.p7) on Ubuntu 9.04 x86 and Ubuntu 10.04 x86_64 (both `ptestlong`).

Patch is up-to-date, so positive review.

I've (of course?) not checked if all functions really come from the PARI source files they're claimed to come from. ;-)

It's up to you to convince Mitesh to merge it into 4.6.alpha2. :)

Done.

I don't think that is so relevant (those files would not look that much different for other SVN snapshot numbers). Besides, people can still look at the ticket #9343 for more information.

Btw, is [08-15](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/08/15) a [*symbolic*](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/08/15_%28Redewendung%29) date?

Positive review for the second patch, too.
