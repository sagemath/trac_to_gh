After exposing the symbolic zeta function at the top level in #8864, we get:

```
sage: zeta(1)
zeta(1)
```

We should return unsigned infinity in this case.

See also #5739.

Attachment: **[trac_9878-zeta_infinity.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9878/trac_9878-zeta_infinity.patch.gz)**

With the new pynac package at #9201, we have:

```
sage: zeta(1)
Infinity
```

[attachment: trac_9878-zeta_infinity.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9878/trac_9878-zeta_infinity.patch.gz) adds doctests for this change.

The pynac package includes patches for #9394, #9834, #9879, #9881, #9900 as well as this ticket. See the ticket description of #9901 for the list (and order) of patches associated to the new version.
