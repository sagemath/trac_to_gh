Using the host 'fulvia'

* Dell Optiplex 755
* 2.4 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core Q6600 
* 8 GB RAM
* Solaris 10 x86 (update 5, 5/08)
* gcc 4.5.1 configured to use the Sun linker and GNU assembler from binutils-2.20.1. 
* 64-bit build. 

iconv failed to build. See the attached log file. 

An identical issue was seen on disk.math using OpenSolaris, but I assumed that was because the tool set was rather old on disk.math - see #9405.

I've built iconv both 32-bit and 64-bit on several machines OK.

* iconv seems to failed on older versions of Solaris/OpenSolaris and not the more recent versions.

I've not get any feedback from the iconv developers, but Ralf Wildenhues, a libtool developer, was most helpful when I posted this to the libtool mailing list. libtool <at> gnu.org. 

With a few tricks it is possible to iconv to build the library, though it requires hacking of an auto-generated file, and to run modified commands manually, which may be difficult to implement as a Sage patch. 

A failed build log, which was created outside of Sage, can be found at

Ralf Wildenhues, who is a **libtool** developer kindly took a look at this for me - iconv uses libtool. The solution is to use:


```
CC="gcc -m64"
```

rather than have 

```
CC=gcc
CFLAGS=-m64
```

(Of course, gcc and -m64 should not be hardcoded - use $CC and $CFLAG64 in place). But the basic problem is that setting -m64 in CLFAGS does not work for some packages, and iconv is one of them. `Numpy` `Pynac` and `Libfplll` are other packages which will not build properly if only `CFLAGS` is set. 

I will add the necessary changes to #9603, which initially started off as a very small fix to install iconv on HP-UX, but has now generated into an almost complete redesign of the iconv package. 

The solution Ralf found has been posted to the libtool mailing list, but I'll get it put in the iconv one too, so others hopefully don't hit this problem. 

I'm cc'ing Leif, so he knows why the change will need to be made to #9603.

I have come across the problem before I must admit. Strange thing is though, this works OK on:

* OS X 64-bit
* Numerous Solaris systems - see above table. 

I'll create a patch and add it to the HP-UX patch, #9603.

I'm attaching a file showing this now building fully on `fulvia` at Skynet  - the machine where `iconv-1.13.1.p2` had failed before. 

Since SAGE_CHECK was set to "yes", the test suite is run. Note there are 3 core dumps, but these are to be expected, and documented in messages printed to the screen. 

```
Running the test suite.
If you see 3 core dumps, do not be too alarmed. See
https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/8270
This is a Solaris bug and can be safely ignored
http://bugs.opensolaris.org/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6550204
It will probably be fixed in later releases of Solaris 10
It was fixed in build 66 of OpenSolaris.
```

As such, I consider this issue is now resolved. A patch will be attached to #9603.
