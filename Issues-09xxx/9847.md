A preset `R_PROFILE` variable can cause some R packages to fail to build/install and interfere with doctests.

Georg Grafendorfer [reported this problem on sage-release](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-release/browse_thread/thread/b2827cba9319bfed/41eab313614e6d2a#41eab313614e6d2a).

For `R_HOME`, this yields a doctest failure if set:

<a id='comment:1'>**Comment 1:**</a>
From around line 180 of `SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage-env`:

```sh
if [ -z "$RHOME" ]; then
    RHOME="$SAGE_LOCAL/lib/R" && export RHOME
fi
```
Should we add a similar test for `R_PROFILE`?

#9906 (R 2.10.1.p5) does this now.

In that case, you should also give *this ticket* positive review, such that the release manager will close it, with "resolution: duplicate".

If issues with `R_PROFILE` should (re)arise unrelated to (the installation of) the R spkg, i.e., which would have to be fixed elsewhere, we can still reopen *this* ticket.

(IIRC some of the problems showed up *during doctesting*, but because `R_PROFILE` had been set *during installation*, so are now fixed by the new spkg. If there needs to be done more w.r.t. this -- which I don't think -- this can be addressed at #9906 as Karl-Dieter suggests.)

Note that this ticket already has #9906 as its dependency.

Correct.  I just wanted to make sure :)  Great.

Yeah, I'm pretty sure that was the issue, or more precisely that `R_PROFILE` was *not* (re)set.
> Note that this ticket already has #9906 as its dependency.

Well, that wouldn't be necessary with a duplicate/wontfix one.

See you at #9906, eventually (when I get time to do all the many tests on that).

Looks good, based on the various discussions in question.

And the `R_HOME` and `R_PROFILE` will be "reset" after one exits the Sage shell, correct?  I do know that some people use their own custom R packages (or try to) but I guess that isn't supported behavior, given the structure of Sage.

In that case, applies and presumably works (I certainly can't test this, but based on all the above) so we should get this in, at long last.

Sure, although nothing is really "reset", you just get your old shell back which never saw `sage-env`.
