<a id='comment:1'></a>This example illustrates the effect of this patch:

```
sage: time GF(next_prime(10^40)^5,'a')
CPU times: user 0.51 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.52 s
Wall time: 0.52 s
Finite Field in a of size 10000000000000000000000000000000000000121^5
sage: proof.arithmetic(False)
sage: time GF(next_prime(10^40)^5,'a')
CPU times: user 0.07 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.07 s
Wall time: 0.07 s
Finite Field in a of size 10000000000000000000000000000000000000121^5
```

Unfortunately, it does *not* address this problem that David Harvey mentioned.  However, it has a similar "flavor":

```
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(Integers(16219299585*2^16612 - 1))
```

I didn't write the attached patch, but I polished it up, so it would be good if somebody else could sign off on this.  I'm OK with it, as is.
