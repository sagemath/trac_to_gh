It's amazing how slow our graph generator is:

```
sage: %time gg=list(graphs(7))
CPU times: user 12.31 s, sys: 0.10 s, total: 12.41 s
Wall time: 12.87 s
```

Compare this to nauty's C implementation (with approximately the same algorithm)

```
sage: %timeit hh=graphs.nauty_geng('-q 7')
5 loops, best of 3: 171 ms per loop
```

Notice that the vast majority of the time is spent in some python calls, which presumably could be much, much faster if we instead used the underlying C structure via Cython.

```
sage: %prun gg=list(graphs(7))

Every time I ask about "yield" statements in Cython, I always get the same response: very close, not there yet. It will be very easy for me to fix this, once they are implemented. Until then, it's probably ten times the work...
