## Hardware & associated software

* Sun Blade 1000
* 2 x 900 MHz UltraSPARC III+ CPUs
* 2 GB RAM
* Solaris 10 03/2005 (first release of Solaris 10)
* gcc 4.4.3 (uses Sun linker and assembler)

## How gcc was configured

```
drkirkby@redstart:~$ gcc -v
Using built-in specs.
Target: sparc-sun-solaris2.10
Configured with: ../gcc-4.4.3/configure --prefix=/usr/local/gcc-4.4.3 --with-mpfr=/usr/local/gcc-4.4.3 --with-build-time-tools=/usr/ccs/bin --with-gmp=/usr/local/gcc-4.4.3 --enable-languages=c,c++,fortran
Thread model: posix
gcc version 4.4.3 (GCC) 
```

 == Sage build process ==
This used Sage 4.4.3.alpha0, but with numerous patches to allow a 64-bit build. At that point, only the zlib and fortran packages had changes for 64-bit and were built. SAGE64 exported to "yes", so it was a 64-bit build. 

This is the first time I've **seriously** tried a 64-bit build on Solaris 10 SPARC. 

## The problem
I get an error with linbox:

```
checking whether GMP is 4.0 or greater... yes
checking whether GMP was compiled with --enable-cxx... yes
checking for NTL >= 5.0... found
checking for GIVARO >= 3.2.10... found
checking whether to compile the sage interface... yes
checking for C interface to BLAS... not found
checking for others BLAS... not found

*******************************************************************************
 ERROR: BLAS not found!

 BLAS routines are required for this library to compile. Please
 make sure BLAS are installed and specify its location with the option
 --with-blas=<lib> when running configure.
*******************************************************************************
Error configuring linbox

real    0m32.070s
user    0m15.156s
sys     0m12.915s
sage: An error occurred while installing linbox-1.1.6.p3
```

No such error occurs when building linbox on OpenSolaris in 64-bit mode. 

This looks to me like it might be an error in spkg/standard/deps, as there is nothing there as far as I can see 

```
$(INST)/$(LINBOX): $(BASE) $(INST)/$(MPIR) $(INST)/$(NTL) $(INST)/$(GIVARO) $(INST)/$(GSL) $(INST)/$(ATLAS)
        $(SAGE_SPKG) $(LINBOX) 2>&1

```

to make linbox dependent on BLAS. The BLAS library is not failing to install - it does not try to install.
