Sorry Alex for this. 

It is annoying that the default is "algebra". It would be better if there was no default, and someone had to chose something.

Not a problem, I was just doing some cleaning.  The simplest solution might be to add a new component called "aaa-misc" that would catch the tickets where the component has not been set.  Then once in a while we can sift through that and classify tickets, without "algebra" getting polluted.

I imagine you must get this quite a lot, which is a bit of a waste of your time. To be honest, I might have left this at "algebra" deliberately, as ATLAS is an acronym for "Automatically Tuned Linear Algebra System". But I know I do occasionally leave things at "algebra" by mistake. 

As a non-mathematician, I often have difficulty in knowing what best to classify something under. 

It's arguable if this should go under "linear algebra" rather than "packages". I really don't know half the time. To me, "packages" seems a bit too wide. 

I think it would be useful if there were tick boxes, and one could tick a few. The other one to get ATLAS working on HP-UX (#9815) could reasonably be in "linear algebra", "packages" and "porting".
