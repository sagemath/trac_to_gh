As I mentioned in the numpy upgrade bug we are moving to networkx-1.2.
So this bug may be invalid. Check have to be done against networkx-1.2 not 1.0.1.

It should have been closed invalid. Numpy-1.4.1 and networkx-1.0.1 don't go along
very well together. But it doesn't matter since next sage release will use networkx-1.2 which works well with numpy-1.4.1. I am changing it to "invalid".
