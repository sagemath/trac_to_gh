The Dancing Links class defines a bunch of random integer variables (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN, ROOTNODE) and exports these to the global namespace. This is kind of sloppy and unprofessional:

I was a bit worried about the edge_coloring method for graphs which uses this algorithm, but it is still working after this patch is applied : no (related) failure in sage -testall ! 

Thankssssssssss ! `:-)`
