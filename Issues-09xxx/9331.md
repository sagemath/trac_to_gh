```
In Sage 4.4.4, I can't build the PDF version of the reference manual,
even though the HTML version builds fine. Here is the error messsage:

Overfull \hbox (41.96407pt too wide) in paragraph at lines 73487--73489
[]\T1/pcr/m/n/10 MyClass2.__classcall__() \T1/ptm/m/n/10 should re-turn the re-
sult of \T1/pcr/m/n/10 UniqueRepresentation.__classcall__()
[890]
! TeX capacity exceeded, sorry [input stack size=5000].
\reserved@a ->\def \reserved@a
                               *{\ttl@assign@i {\@tempskipb }}\reserved@a
l.73597 ...{UniqueRepresentation}} and unpickling}

!  ==> Fatal error occurred, no output PDF file produced!
Transcript written on reference.log.
make: *** [reference.pdf] Error 1 
```
This is traced to ticket #9106.
