Sometimes it would be nice to have the ability to plot one-dimensional things easily, like solutions to an inequality or something.  This would have just one (horizontal) axis and have options allowing plotting of individual points (perhaps if input is a list) or find a way to plot inequalities (maybe via thicker lines and/or tick marks at appropriate places).  

Ideally, this would add with a 2D `Graphics` object by putting it below it and have the axes align, but this might be too hard to do with matplotlib.

<a id='comment:2'></a>From a participant in a workshop:

```

Say, if I want to show the multiples of 5 on the number line. How should I do that in SAGE?

For example: points([(5*n,0) for n in [-3..3]]) gives me the y-axis which I don't want
```

jason says, regarding possible solutions,

```
I would just turn axes off and make your own line:

points([(5*n,0) for n in [-3..3]],axes=False)+line((-3,0),(3,0))

You'd have to do your own ticks, though.  You might also set ymin and ymax to something small (ymin=-.01,ymax=.01)

It would be pretty straightforward for us to make an option that turns off axes selectively.  I could imagine an interface like:

axes=False # turn off all axes
axes=True # turn on all axes
axes=[True,False] # turn on horizontal axis, turn off vertical axis

or maybe it should be:

axes='horizontal' # turn on only horizontal axis
axes='vertical' # turn on only vertical axis.
```
