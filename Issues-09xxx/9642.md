```
Subject: can sage -testall use threads?

That is, without setting NUM_THREADS or something.  I tried

./sage -testall -p 8

but I just get lots of error messages in addition to my test output.
I guess I have the same question about sage -tnew as well.

It seems the `sage -testall` and `sage -tnew` operators invoke `SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage-maketest` and `sage-test-new`, respectively.  To run the tests, both scripts use `sage -t`, which calls the serial doctest runner `sage-test`.  Moreover, `sage-test-new` does not pass along command-line arguments.
