I think #9086 isn't completly fixed:

 ```
 sage: var('x y')
 sage: latex(-x/y) 
 \frac{x}{y}
 sage: latex(x/-y) 
 \frac{x}{y}
 ```

The new spkg installed fine for me on 4.5.rc0 (+patches at #7379), then the patch applied fine and tests pass ( itested the whole library but without -long).  So, while I cannot tell whether the four lines of C++ added to ginac/mul.cpp are correct, this is certainly an improvement and enough to make me give it a positive review.
