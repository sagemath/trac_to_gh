An integral divisor class should lift to an integral divisor. But:

```
sage: rays = [(1, 0, 0), (-1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1), (2, -1, -1)]
sage: cones = [(0, 2, 3), (0, 2, 4), (0, 3, 4), (1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 4), (1, 3, 4)]
sage: X = ToricVariety(Fan(cones=cones, rays=rays))
sage: X.rational_class_group().gen(1).lift()
-1/2*V(z0) + 1/2*V(z1)
```
The attached patch fixes this and any doctest fallout.
