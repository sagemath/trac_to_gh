With sage-on-gentoo it is possible to compile Sage with custom CFLAGS/LDFLAGS. One common LDFLAG on gentoo is "-Wl,--as-needed" which has some advantages when it comes to upgrading a program's dependencies (see http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/qa/asneeded.xml for a good explanation).

The following patch is needed to enable Sage to be compiled with --as-needed; even if one does not do so the patch should not hurt.
