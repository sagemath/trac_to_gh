Simon King mentioned that sometimes his code crashes/leaks/etc.  So make it so one can do:

```
@fork
def f(x,y,z,...):
    ...
```
and then f gets computed in a blocking forked process, and the result is returned via pickling. This is 100% to thwart mem leaks, segfaults, and guaranteed timeout possibility.   This could be basically just a light wrapper around `@`parallel(1).  Also, make a global flag to turn this off, so `@`fork does nothing.

The code is a little longer than necessary, since:


* I improved the documentation and doctesting to get coverage to 100% (it wasn't really before).

* I implemented an option to not kill the interfaces, but it's not used.  It could be useful for some users.
