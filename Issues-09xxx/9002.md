The expected value doesn't matter in that sense.  It is just creating a box which contains a certain graphic, and the last few digits are completely irrelevant (try the pictures).  E.g., 

```
sage: from sage.plot.plot3d.parametric_surface import MobiusStrip
sage: M = MobiusStrip(.0000000000007,.00000000000003,2)
sage: M.bounding_box()
((-7.3000000000000002e-13, -7.0049870840325469e-13, -2.9940801852848143e-14), (7.3000000000000002e-13, 7.0049870840325469e-13, 2.9940801852848143e-14))
```
and you can also check by looking at the graphic that the box is correct (though the formatting of the numbers could be better, which is a separate issue).

Now, that doesn't mean that somewhere there isn't some evil bug lurking.  But tracking down where the discrepancy comes from in this code would mean following a *lot* of branches, for no real purpose.  Most likely it is the fact that `MobiusStrip` has an `eval()` method that uses `math.sin` and `math.cos` a lot, which presumably will be very slightly different on different architectures.

David, I realize this is a decision regarding how far back to look for numerical consistency, and I agree than for things like `gamma(2.3)` it would be very good to ensure maximum consistency.  But here the whole point is a heuristic to get a box that encloses the figure, and differences at that level of accuracy are irrelevant and take resources away from other badly needed improvements to Sage.  So it is unfortunate that we won't track it down, but it is reasonable, I think.

Georg, when you review this, you might as well try the example in this comment, to make sure that it looks right, but if it does then just do a normal review.

Do you have a PPC Mac box to test this on?  I think we still need Georg or someone else for that.

I'm happy to give this a positive. We know what result it was producing, and your fix should allow that to pass. I can't possibly see how this can make the situation any worst, even in the **very** unlikely even it does not cure the problem. 

I've tested on SPARC (Solaris 10) and x86 (Linux) processors.

Have you made that comment on the wrong ticket? I see

`# User crisman@Crismans-Computer.local`

in the patch.

Thinking about that more, that more, your point is valid, as that is not a full name. I can understand someone not wanting their full email address. Just in case the person does not know the format, a .hgrc which adds a name and email address would be:

```
drkirkby@hawk:~$ cat .hgrc
[ui]
username = Forename Surname <your.address@yoursite.com>

[extensions]
# Enable the Mercurial queue extension.
hgext.mq =
