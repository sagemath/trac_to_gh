It seems that in the Sage library code, the usage of some "Lfunction"
library from the lcalc package was newly introduced. On my Mac, both
the (half-built) Sage-4.5.2 and the older (fuly working) Sage-4.5.1
have under local/lib/ some library "libLfunction.so". But on a Mac
under OS X (OS X 10.4 at least), this would need to be
"libLfunction.dylib" to be usable ... 
```

```
for the "Lfunction" issue, the relevant tickets are #5396 resp. #4793.
It seems to be as I thought --- the lcalc spkg (#4793) never built a
correct dynamic (".dylib") library on OS X. But this was not relevant
or did break anything, until the interface between Sage and lcalc was
changed from using pexpect to using this library directly (#5396,
introduced in Sage-4.5.2.alpha1). 
```

Related: #4793, #5396.

The "bsd.math" Mac runs with OS X 10.6 using Apples version of GCC 4.2, and obviously this one knows how to handle ".so" dynamic libraries in addition to ".dylib" ones. I suspected so earlier, but since I work almost exclusively with OS X 10.4 (and thus Apples version of GCC 4.0.1), I couldn't tell, or know, for sure. So OS X 10.6 is "out of the game" for the time being.

But how about OS X 10.5 (I think it also still uses GCC 4.0.1)?
Any results on this platform anybody?

    "body": "<div id=\"comment:9\" align=\"right\">comment:9</div>\n\nIn the meantime, I had a look on the \"p0\" spkg build system (makefile and such). All seems fine, except that \".so\" is hardcoded as suffix. Usually, one has something like $(SO_SUFFIX), and this defaults to so on Linux, dylib on Mac OS X, and dll under Windows. No surprise that in the spkg-install, it is said that this lcalc spkg does not work under Cygwin ...\n\nBut otherwise, OS X is taken care for in the build system, e.g. using \"dynamiclib\" as an option instead of \"shared\". So I duplicated under /local/lib/ the file \"libLfunction.so\" to another file \"libLfunction.dylib\" and, oh wonder, everything works fine.

*This* ticket is about OS X 10.4, and although the difference between p0 and p1 is a quick and dirty hack --- it's exactly the one I myself had in mind ...

Let's open up a new ticket for the Cygwin issues (resp. there probably is already one), and close this one. Because I'm giving it a positive review (I just tested it OK).

lcalc as included does not need mpfr. Mike has experimental code which uses mpfr.

OK since I am redirected here.
Yes the lcalc spkg cleaning should happen in another ticket.
But does the lcalc wrapper in sage really need mpfr if lcalc
doesn't? From the new module_list.py:
{{{    Extension('sage.libs.lcalc.lcalc_Lfunction',
              sources = ['sage/libs/lcalc/lcalc_Lfunction.pyx'],
              libraries = ['m', 'ntl', 'mpfr', 'gmp', 'gmpxx',
                           'Lfunction', 'stdc++'],
              include_dirs = [SAGE_ROOT + "/local/include/lcalc/"],
              extra_compile_args=["-O3", "-ffast-math"],
              language = 'c++'),
}}}
As a matter of fact I don't think it depends on gmp and gmpxx either.
Those are added when you use mpfr.
Actually at the moment Lfunction.so is never ever linked against mpfr, gmp,
gmpxx and pari. Only the lcalc executable is. The same could be said for ntl,
which isn't a dependency of lcalc at all.
So unless the wrapper itself needs any of these I suggest they should go.

Francois
