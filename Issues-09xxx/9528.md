If you have any version of sage < version 4.5, and you try to upgrade to sage-4.5, the addition of a file pipestatus in #8306 means that your upgrade will instantly and totally break.

My first idea to fix this is to modify the script `spkg/install`, which *does* get updated on "sage -upgrade" so that it checks for the file pipestatus, and if it isn't there, then it downloads it. 

Unfortunately, `install` is a shell script, not a python script, so grabbing a file is harder.  But it could call python.

This is going to be a little ugly though.

I disagree -- It's 33 lines long, and  I read it for 2 minutes and didn't fully understand it.

Hi,

I rewrote a script based on your idea (but not using your code).  I tested it by:

 (1) taking sage-4.5 and move spkg/pipestatus to spkg/pipestatus.orig
 (2) typed "make", then control-c in a few seconds
 (3) Do diff spkg/pipestatus spkg/pipestatus.orig and observe that the diff is just a single blank line.

Please review.  Since spkg/install is pulled in by SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/spkg-update, this should fix the problem.

> Please review.  Since spkg/install is pulled in by SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/spkg-update, this should fix the problem.

I just noticed I had written `spkg-install` instead of `spkg/install`... :/

Of course I prefer generating a version-specific `pipestatus`, but if it is a temporary solution, I'm ok with omitting it.

I'd though at least fix `pipestatus`'s parameter checking as I did in my second version:

```sh
...
  cat > pipestatus <<EOF
#!/usr/bin/env bash

if [ \$# -ne 2 -o -z "\$1" -o -z "\$2" ]; then
    echo "Run two commands in a pipeline 'CMD1 | CMD2' and exit"
    echo "with the exit status of CMD1, *not* that of CMD2."
    echo "\$0 cmd1 cmd2"
    exit
fi
...
```

Dropping the parentheses around `(set -o pipefail; eval "\$1 | \$2")` is optional, but you should remove `-n` from the `echo` in your `install`.

We cannot yet test upgrading from e.g. 4.4.4 though, can we?

(I've tried your `install` there, it's ok when `deps` etc. get updated, too.)

In any case, add a

```sh
    chmod +x pipestatus
```
after the `cat`...

Those builds' long doctests also pass, as do those for a completely serial build of "4.5.1" from scratch on sage.math.

I'm attempting to upgrade from a 4.3.0.1 binary on t2.  I'm also building 4.4.4 on bsd.math so that I can test `sage -upgrade`.

But so far, my review is positive.

Upgrading from 4.4.4 also works for me on bsd.math.

On t2:  It seems the 4.3.0.1 binary is too old to upgrade.  (LinBox doesn't build, possibly because part of the toolchain has changed since 4.3.0.1 was built.)  But upgrading from "4.5" to "4.5.1" works, after deleting the former's `pipestatus`.

I'm still building 4.4.4 on t2, but I think we're ready for the real 4.5.

Can someone check that the small changes made from `install` to `install.2` are OK?

The upgrade from 4.4.4 to "4.5.1" on t2 is now working on Singular --- the Sage and Gap packages remain.  No problems so far.  I need to sleep soon; I'll report again as soon as possible.

Also, "4.5.1" also builds from scratch on bsd.math.  The long doctests pass.
