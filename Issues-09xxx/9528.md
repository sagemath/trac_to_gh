My first idea to fix this is to modify the script `spkg/install`, which *does* get updated on "sage -upgrade" so that it checks for the file pipestatus, and if it isn't there, then it downloads it. 

Unfortunately, `install` is a shell script, not a python script, so grabbing a file is harder.  But it could call python.

This is going to be a little ugly though.

I disagree -- It's 33 lines long, and  I read it for 2 minutes and didn't fully understand it.

Hi,

I rewrote a script based on your idea (but not using your code).  I tested it by:

 (1) taking sage-4.5 and move spkg/pipestatus to spkg/pipestatus.orig
 (2) typed "make", then control-c in a few seconds
 (3) Do diff spkg/pipestatus spkg/pipestatus.orig and observe that the diff is just a single blank line.

Please review.  Since spkg/install is pulled in by SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/spkg-update, this should fix the problem.

I just noticed I had written `spkg-install` instead of `spkg/install`... :/

Of course I prefer generating a version-specific `pipestatus`, but if it is a temporary solution, I'm ok with omitting it.

I'd though at least fix `pipestatus`'s parameter checking as I did in my second version:

```sh
...
  cat > pipestatus <<EOF
#!/usr/bin/env bash

if [ \$# -ne 2 -o -z "\$1" -o -z "\$2" ]; then
    echo "Run two commands in a pipeline 'CMD1 | CMD2' and exit"
    echo "with the exit status of CMD1, *not* that of CMD2."
    echo "\$0 cmd1 cmd2"
    exit
fi
...
```

Dropping the parentheses around `(set -o pipefail; eval "\$1 | \$2")` is optional, but you should remove `-n` from the `echo` in your `install`.

We cannot yet test upgrading from e.g. 4.4.4 though, can we?

(I've tried your `install` there, it's ok when `deps` etc. get updated, too.)

In any case, add a

```sh
    chmod +x pipestatus
```
after the `cat`...

Upgrading from 4.4.4 to 4.5 works for me on sage.math with [attachment:install.2].  The long doctests pass.  This is with `MAKE="-j12"` and `SAGE_PARALLEL_SPKG_BUILD="yes"`.  A separate, completely serial upgrade with MAKE unset is still running.

Starting with "4.5" on sage.math, I copied [attachment:install.2] to `spkg/` and made a new source distribution with `sage -sdist 4.5.1`.  This builds with `MAKE="-j20"` and `SAGE_PARALLEL_SPKG_BUILD="yes"`.  The long doctests pass.  Another build with just `MAKE="-j16"` is still running.

Thanks again for fixing this.

I'm attempting to upgrade from a 4.3.0.1 binary on t2.  I'm also building 4.4.4 on bsd.math so that I can test `sage -upgrade`.

But so far, my review is positive.

Upgrading from 4.4.4 also works for me on bsd.math.

I'm still building 4.4.4 on t2, but I think we're ready for the real 4.5.

Can someone check that the small changes made from `install` to `install.2` are OK?

The upgrade from 4.4.4 to "4.5.1" on t2 is now working on Singular --- the Sage and Gap packages remain.  No problems so far.  I need to sleep soon; I'll report again as soon as possible.

Also, "4.5.1" also builds from scratch on bsd.math.  The long doctests pass.
