```
Currently, the edge_incident method of generic graph calls edge_boundary which first take a lot of time and secondly does not work

```
sage: G = Graph(loops=True)
sage: G.add_edge(0,0)
sage: G.edges()
[(0, 0, None)]
sage: list(G.edge_iterator(0))
[(0, 0, None)]
sage: G.edges_incident(0)
[]
```

The ticket also aims to reduce multiple calls (edge_boundary does not call directly edge_iterator as it should).

It is also the occasion to add some doc and correct some typos.

Your patch is very nice, applies fine and everything.. I would just like to append a short line, because of a missing "if". If you agree with this, let's say this ticket is positively reviewed ! :-)
