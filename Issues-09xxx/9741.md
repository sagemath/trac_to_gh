This patch adds a "key" argument to allow custom sorting of the output of the graph method vertices().  It adds to the documentation to make it clear that vertices will not always have a default sort order.

Hello !!!

Would it be possible to make a 

"Return the list of vertices"

out of your

"Return a list of the vertices, usually as a sorted list" (Why "usually as") ?

When key=None, it is sorted using the "default" order...  And anyway your docstrings make it perfectly clear later `:-)`

Yes, new v2 patch has this change.  My original goal was to make the default sorting behavior more obvious, but you are right that the doctests should do the job of explaining that.

I made a graph with polynomials as vertices.  The discriminant is a function on polynomials that I used as the key in a sort, to demo the new sorting capability of this ticket in the doctests.

Did something change elsewhere?  This was passing tests before.

I could change this to something different.  I'm traveling with family right now, but could work on it tomorrow night.  How urgent is a fix?

Ticket #4000 implements fast polynomial arithmetic over the rationals via FLINT1.  It removes the class `Polynomial_rational_dense` but "replaces" it with `Polynomial_rational_flint`.  

Would `dsc = lambda x: x.discriminant()` work in the sorting test?  If it does, it could shield the test against changes to a lower-level API.

> I could change this to something different.  I'm traveling with family right now, but could work on it tomorrow night.  How urgent is a fix?

It's not very urgent, though we're hoping to merge #4000 in 4.6.alpha2, which I plan to release at least a week from now (alpha1 is not yet out).  Currently, however, there's a more serious build error at #4000.

Mitesh,

Thanks for the explanation and suggestion.  I'll try to get something up in the next 12-24 hours.

Thanks, Rob.  This ticket is actually already in the released 4.6.alpha1, so we probably just need to change the key function in a small patch at #4000.  I apologize for not being clear about this.

Mitesh,

Sorry - not thinking clearly.  I got it now.  I thought carefully about messing with the ticket status - shoulda known not to!  

I'll attach a fix to #4000 then.  Maybe later tonight.

Thanks,

Mitesh,

It would appear the `dsc = lambda ...` change would certainly fix this.  But looking at the doctests, I remember now why I did what I did.  All the other tests have keys made from lambda functions.  I wanted to show how you could write out the fully-qualified name of some function (I could have imported it, as well) and use that as the `key` function.

Would it be so bad to just adjust the modules to the new names?  I could add some documentation to make it clear why this construct looks a bit odd.  But I think it would be educational for people not 100% familiar with Python having functions as first-class objects.

No, that's sounds good to me.  Thanks for your explanation.

Patch to fix this, with a bit more explanation, up at #4000.

Thanks, Mitesh, for guiding me through this one.  First time I've had a mid-release conflict to resolve.
