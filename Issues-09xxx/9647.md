I can't comment on the correctness, obviously, but if the formatting works out right, this is exactly the kind of thing I was envisioning.  Great documentation and explanation - I hope someone reviews it soon!

Hello !!! Everything seems nice, but could you please add in the example one or two inequalities ? All the constraints in this case are equalities, which is a bit unusual with LP... Anyway people would understand that it is indeed possible to write an equality with two inequalities, while the opposite is not true... :-)
