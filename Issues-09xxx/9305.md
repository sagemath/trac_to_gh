R is one of the many standard packages in Sage (see #9281 for a list), which do not have a spkg-check file. This means that if one builds Sage with the environment variable SAGE_CHECK set to "yes", no self-tests of the package will be run. This is silly, as R has a test suite.

After adding the file spkg-check

```
make check
```

will be run which is the documented way to test R. 

On a Solaris system I tested on, running the test suite uncovered errors.
