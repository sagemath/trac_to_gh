All arithmetic operations on `QuotientRingElement` return a new `QuotientRingElement`, which is not the desired result for derived classes. Instead one should use `self.__class__` to return an instance of the actual type:

```
sage: from sage.rings.quotient_ring_element import QuotientRingElement
sage: class Q(QuotientRingElement):
...    pass
...
sage: P.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(QQ, 'x, y')
sage: Pquo = P.quo(x^3)
sage: q = Q(Pquo, x)
sage: type(q)
<class '__main__.Q'>
sage: type(q^2)
<class 'sage.rings.quotient_ring_element.QuotientRingElement'>
```

Expected behaviour: `q^2` should have the same (derived) type as `q`.

I am running into this issue because I want to express cohomology classes on toric varieties as derived classes of `QuotientRingElement`, see #9326. I'll write the obvious patch and attach it later today.

I think that the coercion system is great and we should try to use it and comply with it as much as possible, especially in new classes.

Naturally, `q^2` in your example will be of type `QuotientRingElement` since this is what the parent of `q` constructs as its elements.

We should eventually port this to the new coercion model, but it seems to be a bigger effort. I don't want to wait with the current toric varieties code until this is done. So I'd like to go ahead with the "wrong" coercion in #9326, and leave this ticket for later.
