All arithmetic operations on `QuotientRingElement` return a new `QuotientRingElement`, which is not the desired result for derived classes. Instead one should use `self.__class__` to return an instance of the actual type:

```
sage: from sage.rings.quotient_ring_element import QuotientRingElement
sage: class Q(QuotientRingElement):
...    pass
...
sage: P.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(QQ, 'x, y')
sage: Pquo = P.quo(x^3)
sage: q = Q(Pquo, x)
sage: type(q)
<class '__main__.Q'>
sage: type(q^2)
<class 'sage.rings.quotient_ring_element.QuotientRingElement'>
```

Expected behaviour: `q^2` should have the same (derived) type as `q`.

I am running into this issue because I want to express cohomology classes on toric varieties as derived classes of `QuotientRingElement`, see #9326. I'll write the obvious patch and attach it later today.

I think that the coercion system is great and we should try to use it and comply with it as much as possible, especially in new classes.

Naturally, `q^2` in your example will be of type `QuotientRingElement` since this is what the parent of `q` constructs as its elements.

Hi Volker,

I think I need to clarify my position a bit. I think that the coercion system is great and we should try to use it and comply with it as much as possible, especially in new classes. However it is not yet implemented everywhere and "fixing" existing files sometimes leads to a lot of problems, which may have a simple solution, but it is not necessarily obvious.

We should eventually port this to the new coercion model, but it seems to be a bigger effort. I don't want to wait with the current toric varieties code until this is done. So I'd like to go ahead with the "wrong" coercion in #9326, and leave this ticket for later.
