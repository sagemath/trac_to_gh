Potential interface:

```
    sage: W = SymmetricGroup(5)
    sage: P = W.parabolic_subgroup((1,3,4))
    # TODO: add desired features here
    sage: TestSuite(P).run()
```

```
    sage: P = W.reflection_subgroup(<a list/family of reflections>)
    sage: TestSuite(P).run()
```
Proof of concept attached.
