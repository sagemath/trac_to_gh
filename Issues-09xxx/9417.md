In 4.4.4 the following Tamagawa number gets evaluated as 2:

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2+18*x+1)
sage: E = EllipticCurve(K, [0, -36, 0, 320, 0])
sage: E.tamagawa_number(K.ideal(2))
2
```

According to Magma this should be 4.

As the author of both Sage's and Magma's code for Tamagawa numbers, I have been tracking this one down. It turns out to be due to a bug in how elements of the rings of integers are mapped into residue fields:

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2+18*x+1)
sage: P = K.ideal(2)
sage: F = K.residue_field(P)
sage: R = PolynomialRing(F, 'x')
sage: R([0, a, a, 1])
x^3 + abar*x^2 + abar*x
sage: F(a)
1
sage: a.minpoly()
x^2 + 18*x + 1
sage: F.gen()
abar
sage: F.gen().minpoly()
x^2 + x + 1
```
The polynomial `x<sup>3+a*x</sup>2+a*x` reduced modulo P=(2) wrongly to `x<sup>3+abar*x</sup>2+abar*x`. Although the generator of the residue field F is suggestively called abar, it it *not* the reduction of a mod P (which is 1 mod P).

I will open a new ticket for that, and try to fix it. This ticket can probably then be closed, so watch this space.

The patch applies the simple workaround described at #11055.  Now we correctly get

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2+18*x+1)
sage: E = EllipticCurve(K, [0, -36, 0, 320, 0])
sage: E.tamagawa_number(K.ideal(2))
4
```
and a doctest has been added.
