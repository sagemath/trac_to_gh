When executing a PARI command from Sage, a value of 0 is returned when None would be expected.  For example, in a gp shell (say, started with sage -gp):

```
gp> kill(x)   /* No output */
```

But in Sage:

```
sage: pari('kill(x)')
0
```

It should be possible to fix this by checking for `gnil` (PARI's concept of None) as return value.

It's exactly as you say, new_gen() calls _sig_off.
