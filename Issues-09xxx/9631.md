We merged #9501 in Sage 4.5.2.alpha1 but backed it out entirely in 4.5.2.rc0 (cf. #9616), because a Network File System (NFS) problem on the Sage cluster gives frequent doctest failures.

Please see #9501 and #9616 for discussion.

<a id='comment:1'>**Comment 1:**</a>
After the recent changes on the Sage cluster, I still see failures on sage.math with 4.6.alpha2 + #9501's v2 patch:

```python
sage-4.6.a2$ env DOT_SAGE="$HOME/.sage" ./sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/parallel/decorate.py
sage -t -long "devel/sage/sage/parallel/decorate.py"        


------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred in Sage.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* component
of Sage has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
or is not properly wrapped with _sig_on, _sig_off.
You might want to run Sage under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
Sage will now terminate (sorry).

I believe the `Unhandled SIGSEGV` is expected.

The actual workings of the fork decorator look good. Positive review.

Explicit, but perhaps a bit inconvenient. Didn't apply it, only looked at the patch.

Yep, sorry. (I actually *edited* your patch and then made a diff just for displaying.)

In principle one can extract inline patches from mail notifications (or "reply" to the comment just to copy parts), but since I also changed context lines, the patched patch wouldn't apply anyway.

I was just going to upload a v5 (no code changes btw., just in comments), but somehow managed to totally mess up the patch (and apparently also the files themselves) such that I now have two mixed versions with *both* having some of your and some of my changes... 8/

Trying to fix this, then I'll upload a "real" v5 patch; I made more changes than in the comment above.

Ok, attached a v5 patch, and a diff between William's v4 and my version.

Take a look at it, haven't updated the description yet.

Hope I didn't miss something, as I had to redo almost all from scratch, because some very weird things must have happened. Not only did the editor confuse files, presumably due to renaming and symbolic links, but also my first committed and exported version completely vanished from the Mercurial repository, which must be some weird bug related to cloning  and rebuilding a branch.
