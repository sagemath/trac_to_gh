We merged #9501 in Sage 4.5.2.alpha1 but backed it out entirely in 4.5.2.rc0 (cf. #9616), because a Network File System (NFS) problem on the Sage cluster gives frequent doctest failures.

Please see #9501 and #9616 for discussion.

After the recent changes on the Sage cluster, I still see failures on sage.math with 4.6.alpha2 + #9501's v2 patch:

```python
sage-4.6.a2$ env DOT_SAGE="$HOME/.sage" ./sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/parallel/decorate.py
sage -t -long "devel/sage/sage/parallel/decorate.py"        


------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred in Sage.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* component
of Sage has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
or is not properly wrapped with _sig_on, _sig_off.
You might want to run Sage under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
Sage will now terminate (sorry).

I believe the `Unhandled SIGSEGV` is expected.

Explicit, but perhaps a bit inconvenient. Didn't apply it, only looked at the patch.

Yep, sorry. (I actually *edited* your patch and then made a diff just for displaying.)

In principle one can extract inline patches from mail notifications (or "reply" to the comment just to copy parts), but since I also changed context lines, the patched patch wouldn't apply anyway.

I was just going to upload a v5 (no code changes btw., just in comments), but somehow managed to totally mess up the patch (and apparently also the files themselves) such that I now have two mixed versions with *both* having some of your and some of my changes... 8/

Trying to fix this, then I'll upload a "real" v5 patch; I made more changes than in the comment above.

Ok, attached a v5 patch, and a diff between William's v4 and my version.

Take a look at it, haven't updated the description yet.
