With the attached patch multinomial_coefficients(m,n) becomes faster
than the unpatched version as m increases

Sage-4.5.1
sage: %timeit w = multinomial_coefficients(int(20),int(5))
5 loops, best of 3: 4.91 s per loop

with patch:
sage: %timeit w = multinomial_coefficients(int(20),int(5))
5 loops, best of 3: 1.05 s per loop

I think I got an even faster implementation.
I'm sorry but I don't have a development Sage handy for the next days, so I just put the code here.
If you want to make a clean patch with this, go ahead; otherwise, I will do it in some days when I'm back home.

```
def multinomial_coefficients(m, n):
    if m == 2:
        return binomial_coefficients(n)
    t = [n] + [0] * (m - 1)
    r = {tuple(t): 1}
    if n:
        p0 = 0 # leftmost nonzero position
    else:
        p0 = m
    # enumerate tuples in co-lex order
    while p0 < m - 1:
        # compute next tuple
        j = p0
        tj = t[j]
        t[j+1] += 1
        if j:
            t[0] = tj
            t[j] = 0
        if tj > 1:
            p0 = 0
            start = 1
        else:
            p0 += 1
            start = p0
        # compute the value
        v = 0
        for k in xrange(start, m):
            if t[k]:
                t[k] -= 1
                v += r[tuple(t)]
                t[k] += 1
        t[0] -= 1
        r[tuple(t)] = (v * tj) // (n - t[0])
    return r

I've tested this, and confirmed that the "even_faster" patch is indeed significantly faster and delivers correct results.  It's *almost* a positive review, except for two minor things:

1. Erroneous results are returned if `m` is zero. E.g.,

   * 

```
sage: multinomial_coefficients(0, 3)
{(3,): 1}
```

To be consistent with `multinomial([])`, which returns `1`, `multinomial_coefficients(0, n)` should return `{(), 1)}` if `n` is zero, and `{}` otherwise.

2. I don't understand the comment "`the very first step was mixed above"`, the word *mixed* in particular.

One other thing that might be worth changing would be to allow `multinomial` to take a tuple as its argument.  Then `multinomial_coefficients` could have a doctest like

```
sage: r = multinomial_coefficients(4, 3)
sage: all(multinomial(k) == v for k, v in r.items())
True
```

I attached a patch to be applied after the 'even_faster' one.

It corrects the behavior for `m=0`. It also change the comment.
I just wanted to say that the initialization of v (which is part of the computation of the value) is done within the code for enumerating the tuples.

Regarding the modification of `multinomial`, I leave this for another ticket.
