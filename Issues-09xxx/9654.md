Both

```
implicit_plot(x^2 +  y^2-1,(x,-1,1),(y,-1,1),aspect_ratio=1,color='red')
```

and

```
implicit_plot(x^2 +  y^2-1,(x,-1,1),(y,-1,1),aspect_ratio=1,color='red')
```

do not produce a red circle as would be expected. matplotlib's cmap options don't get it quite good.

This appears to be a simple fix for this issue. Do I need to add anything more than the doctest?

You should raise an error if both `color` and `rgbcolor` are given akin to

```
sage: x,y = var('x,y')
sage: plot(x^2 - 2, rgbcolor=(0,1,0), color='red')
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
RuntimeError                              Traceback (most recent call last)
...
RuntimeError: Error in line(): option 'color' not valid.
```
Although I think `RuntimeError` is not the correct error, nor should `plot` go through so much to error out either. However that is a separate issue. The correct error is a `ValueError` in this situation.

I've updated the branch to raise a `ValueError` for conflicting input, as well as added a doctest.

The error in `plot.py` appears to arise from this line:

```
@rename_keyword(color='rgbcolor')
```

Once we agree on how to handle the two arguments here, I can remove that line and update the code accordingly.

Which error where? I don't see any doctest failures.
