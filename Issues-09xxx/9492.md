I think these are interesting because they are used in benchmarks for factoring and irreducibility testing.  See
  http://www.shoup.net/ntl/doc/tour-time.html

The sdpoly3 function computes the 10th Swinnerton-Dyer poly of degree 2^10=1024 in < 20 seconds. 

```

I just adapted sdpoly3 to use a binary tree. The result is called sdpoly5, see file sd2.sage. I found sdpoly5 to be slightly faster than sdpoly3 in the tests that I have run.

When using naive polynomial multiplication, the algorithms sdpoly3 and sdpoly5 are asymptotically equivalent. As soon as FFT quasi-linear polynomial multiplication is implemented for interval arithmetic and examples become large, the algorithm sdpoly5 should be the faster one (quasi-linear).

```
sage: time sdpoly5(12)

Thanks.  But just a remark -- the Sage prod command already uses a binary tree, at least if the input is a list or of length < 1000.    See the file

   devel/sage/sage/misc/misc_c.pyx

which Robert Bradshaw wrote.   So putting 

```
  prod(list( ... ))
```
instead of 

```
  prod( ...)
```

in sdpoly3 might be another approach.

I'm at a Singular conference, so I decided to try this problem using Singular polynomial quotient rings.  It's pretty good, though it doesn't beat interval arithmetic speed-wise.

```
def sdpoly6(n):
    R = PolynomialRing(QQ,n+1,names='x')
    x = R.gens()
    v = primes_first_n(n)
    I = R.ideal([ x[i]^2-v[i] for i in range(len(v)) ])
    S = R.quotient(I)
    x = S.gens()
    C = cartesian_product_iterator([[-1,1]]*n)
    f = prod([ x[-1] + sum(s[i]*x[i] for i in range(n)) for s in C])
    return f
```

Some timings:

```
sage: time a = sdpoly6(8)
Time: CPU 0.71 s, Wall: 0.71 s
sage: time a = sdpoly6(9)
Time: CPU 3.44 s, Wall: 3.47 s
sage: time a10 = sdpoly6(10)
Time: CPU 29.03 s, Wall: 29.19 s
```

Very impressive for something non-numerical, IMHO...
