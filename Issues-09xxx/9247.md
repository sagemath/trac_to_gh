I'm wondering if by default, E.saturate() shouldn't print all that stuff from `mwrank`. Oddly, it doesn't show up in doctests, since it goes straight to the terminal.

There are also still failures in:

```
sage -t -long "devel/sage-main/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_rational_field.py"
sage -t -long "devel/sage-main/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/padics.py"
```

John, Can you give some opinion on those?

Looks good and applies to 4.4.4.alpha0.  I am currently testing all sage/schemes/elliptic_curves.

One point about the (good) new rank_bound parameter for the point_search function:  is it not rather inefficient to saturate completely after every point found?  In my code (in eclib's points own search function) I only partially saturate after each point, using a bound (i.e. max_prime) of 19.  Then one the rank bound is reached (or at the end, if rank_bound is None) so a complete saturation.

I also think we should have an option for this function to not do the saturation step (which also discards all points found and replaces them for a Z-basis for their saturation), and just returns a list of the raw points actually found.  If you agree, we should open a new ticket.  (Obviously the current behaviour would be the default, for backward compatibility).

Test failure in sha_tate: 

```

and similar in padics:

```

but I have no idea what in the patch could have caused this!
And finally:

I do agree!

E.modular_symbol() now uses eclib if the sign is +1, for efficiency purposes. It is probably what is causing all the failures... I'm not sure whether this is practical or not, but it definitely sped up E.sha().p_primary_bound(p) in the cases I was looking at.

More specifically, with the patch here applied to `sage-4.4.4.alpha1` the following doctest illustrates the printing I'm talking about:

```
sage: EllipticCurve([0, 0, 1, -79, 342]).regulator(proof=False)  # long time (seconds)
Saturation index bound = 265
WARNING: saturation at primes p > 100 will not be done;  
points may be unsaturated at primes between 100 and index bound
Failed to saturate MW basis at primes [ ]
*** saturation possibly incomplete at primes [ ]
14.7905275701311
```

When I do this from the command line, that is exactly what I get. However, when I run long doctests in `ell_rational_field.py` the following part appears in the terminal from which I'm running the tests, and is a little misleading:

OK, so the problem is that the warning output from the regulator call appears in the wrong place in the output -- right?

I have solved this by avoiding it as follows.  The gens() function uses mwrank_lib (default) or mwrank_console to do a two-descent after constructing the mwrank_EllipticCurve C.  But it was failing to call the saturate function on C.  Some default saturation is done by the gens() call (on C), but the default saturation bound is rather low (100, set in eclib).

So I added a new parameter sat_bound to the gens() function in ell_rational_field, default 1000, and made sure that both mwrank_lib and mwrank_console option use it.
Now we have

```

sage: E = EllipticCurve([0, 0, 1, -79, 342])
sage: E.gens()
[(-10 : 11 : 1), (-39/4 : 105/8 : 1), (-8 : 21 : 1), (-7 : 23 : 1), (-6 : 24 : 1)]
```

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve([0, 0, 1, -79, 342])
sage: E.gens(algorithm='mwrank_console')
[(-10 : 11 : 1), (-39/4 : 105/8 : 1), (-8 : 21 : 1), (-7 : 23 : 1), (-6 : 24 : 1)]
```
compared with

```

sage: E = EllipticCurve([0, 0, 1, -79, 342])
sage: E.gens(sat_bound=100)
Saturation index bound = 265
WARNING: saturation at primes p > 100 will not be done;  
points may be unsaturated at primes between 100 and index bound
Failed to saturate MW basis at primes [ ]

[(-10 : 11 : 1), (-39/4 : 105/8 : 1), (-8 : 21 : 1), (-7 : 23 : 1), (-6 : 24 : 1)]
```
I will post an additional patch in a minute.
