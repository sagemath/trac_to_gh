------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGFPE: An unhandled floating point exception occurred in Sage.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* component
of Sage has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
or is not properly wrapped with _sig_on, _sig_off.
You might want to run Sage under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
Sage will now terminate (sorry).

The code dos not check if the element to be inverted is zero or not and does not handle the exception that ocurred in the c extension.

There is a trivial patch that checks if the input is zero or not. I am not sure if the sourronding code should have some _sig_on _sig_off to made it more robust. _sig_on _sig_off would avoid the sage crash but would raise a RunTime exception.
