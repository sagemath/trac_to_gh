sage: binomial(3,k)

This is a bug since

```
sage: binomial(x,k)
binomial(x, k)
```
works.

Good catch; I was pretty sure we had rewritten that at some point, but I have trouble following the imports.

> This still needs work, since the files `sage/functions/other.py` and `sage/rings/arith.py` don't pass doctests yet. 


> We need to improve the speed of numerical approximation using the `gamma` trick from `sage.rings.arith.binomial` and change `sage.symbolic.pynac.py_binomial()` to handle large integers.

Is that part of this ticket?  Are you saying that the numerical approximation has slowed down dramatically from the `rings.arith` version?

The funny thing is, it appears the global definition of `Polynomial` now missing is in `power_series_ring_element.pyx` which was indirectly and illogically imported in `polynomial_ring_element.pyx` before the author's patch.

Evidently he should have submitted the import cleanup separately.

Offhand, I'm not able to fix this, any takers?
