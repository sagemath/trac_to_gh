It would be great if we could do

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve([0,0,0,3,0]) # curve with CM by Q[I]
sage: (1 + I) * P([1,2])
```
This wouldn't be very hard for CM elliptic curves over QQ, since the necessary functionality is there in PARI's `ellpow`; see #6327. CM elliptic curves over number fields might be a bit harder.

I have an important mathematical question though: given an elliptic curve E, how can we see whether it has CM and if yes, for which discriminant?
