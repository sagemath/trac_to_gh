In ticket #8263, we missed these:

- SAGE_DOC_JSMATH - should force docs to be built using jsMath

- SAGE_DOCBUILD_OPTS - passed as an argument to `sage --docbuild` in the main Sage makefile.

TODO:
* Add `PARI_EXTRA_OPTS`, which is passed to PARI's `Configure` when building Sage / installing the PARI spkg.
* Add `CPPFLAGS`, `LDFLAGS`, `CXXFLAG64`?, `LDFLAG64`? `LD`?
* Document that (e.g.) `export CFLAGS=""` has not the same effect as `unset CFLAGS`.
* Add note on not putting a space between `-j` and `NUM` in the description of `MAKE`, because doing so has a "completely" different meaning...
* Add warning to (setting) `SAGE_CHECK`, since this currently breaks most builds. This will (or should) be fixed in future releases though; there's afaik a ticket adding more options to the value of this variable...
* Add a note on / reference to `sage-env`.

Also, the description of some variables is incomplete, not current (in its use in all spkgs, e.g. `SAGE_DEBUG`), misleading, or even wrong (`SAGE_TIMEOUT*`).

I think the various variations of `SAGE_T[E]MP[[_]DIR]` are missing. (I wonder where e.g. `TMP` and `TMPDIR` are / may be used instead, or as a fall-back / default.)

`SHELL` might be relevant, too.

The `*ITER*` variables for (parallel) doctesting are missing.

I'm currently not sure if we have a similar section in the *Developer's Guide*, but some variables like `SAGE_ROOT` and `SAGE_LOCAL` should be documented (there?), too.

I'm still pretty sure even more variables are missing... ;-)

There is a ticket for the latter to be better, and the former is now in good shape.

Indubitably.

It is actually used for docbuilding in the top-level `Makefile`. So it ought to be documented.

> Needed?

Doesn't seem to be used, but some other variables are used in Pari's spkg-install file. I've documented those (just copying from spkg-install, basically).

> > * Add `CPPFLAGS`, `LDFLAGS`, `CXXFLAG64`?, `LDFLAG64`? `LD`?

> Needed?

I added a bit about them.

> > * Document that (e.g.) `export CFLAGS=""` has not the same effect as `unset CFLAGS`.

> Needed?

Same here.

> > * Add note on not putting a space between `-j` and `NUM` in the description of `MAKE`, because doing so has a "completely" different meaning...

> Needed?

I don't know, this isn't Sage specific. I think we can skip it.


> > * Add a note on / reference to `sage-env`.

> Needed?

Done.

> > Also, the description of some variables is incomplete, not current (in its use in all spkgs, e.g. `SAGE_DEBUG`), misleading, or even wrong (`SAGE_TIMEOUT*`).

> Needed?

I noticed that the documented value for SAGE_TIMEOUT was wrong. Beyond that, I don't know what Leif meant by this. If he wants to expand on it at some point, he can open another ticket and clarify.

> > I think the various variations of `SAGE_T[E]MP[[_]DIR]` are missing. (I wonder where e.g. `TMP` and `TMPDIR` are / may be used instead, or as a fall-back / default.)

> Needed?

I don't think there are such variables anymore. There is a variable SAGE_TMP used while running Sage, but it's not user-customizable and it's not an environment variable. So I don't think we need to document it.

> > `SHELL` might be relevant, too.

> Needed?

Why? Let's skip it. What does it have to do with Sage?

> > The `*ITER*` variables for (parallel) doctesting are missing.

> Needed?

I added something about them.
