The purposes of this ticket are to

* Identify what standard packages have an spkg-check file present. At the time the ticket was opened, only 19 packages had spkg-check files out of 98 packages. (Some don't need them, such as where the package just copies a database)
* Document whether the package passes tests when Sage is built with SAGE_CHECK="yes" on OpenSolaris x64. (Currently, neither Maxima or R build on OpenSolaris, and the resulting build is very unstable - segfaulting just trying to run it). 
* Document whether the package passes tests when Sage is built with SAGE_CHECK="yes" on Solaris 10 on SPARC, compiled as 32-bit.
* Document whether the package passes tests when Sage is built with SAGE_CHECK="yes" on Solaris 10 on SPARC, compiled as 64-bit. (Currently, the 64-bit build of Sage needs various patches, and is rather unstable)
* Add any **brief** notes - giving a reference to a ticket number if possible. 

The aim of this ticket is not to give details about build issues for the packages. The aim is to show what packages have spkg-check files, and collect data on what the results from the tests are.

I think we should separate the *presence* of `spkg-check` from testsuite results, i.e. create a single platform-independent ticket that lists spkg improvement progress.

In addition, some packages might do self-tests during build unconditionally, others do not even have a `check` or `test` Make target or some equivalent. This should be recorded, too.

I strongly suggest extending `sage-spkg` s.t. Sage *build* failure on *testsuite* errors gets optional, and an option to continue with installation until all packages have been processed, then reporting in summary which packages were tested and which had failures, similar to the doctesting.

More complicated, but nice, would be to separate testsuite logs from install logs. (`spkg/installed/PKG_NAME` currently at least shows when a self-test was *successfully* performed, but if it failed, the file is of course removed, since this is considered a *build*/installation error.)

I seriously think we should consider running the self-tests unconditionally on packages where this takes very little time. Some packages take less than 10 seconds to run the self-tests.

Yes, that sounds logical. If you know something builds, you can run ` make -k` I guess, and continue past errors when testing.

I would have thought that easier than producing a summary myself. I don't believe that can be rocket science.

I meant tests unconditionally performed by upstream (i.e. implicitly, without "make check" or alike).

> > I strongly suggest extending `sage-spkg` s.t. Sage *build* failure on *testsuite* errors gets optional, and an option to continue with installation until all packages have been processed, then reporting in summary which packages were tested and which had failures, similar to the doctesting.

;-) `sage-spkg` currently treats testsuite failures as build errors, so `make -k` would not get (much) further if other packages depend on the "failed" ones; rerunning `make` just *deletes* their previous builds, *again unpacks* these packages and starts *rebuilding them from scratch*(!) - again "failing", unless one **manually** touches `spkg/installed/$PKG_NAME`, which `sage-spkg` just has deleted...

It's not rocket science (if you consider that complicated), but Sage's current build process is rather unsuited for such. Though one could of course *post*-process the spkg install logs, where also testsuite output ends up.

In contrast, "ignoring" testsuite failures (even if `SAGE_CHECK=yes`) and printing a summary report is almost trivial, the biggest "problem" being choosing new appropriate environment variable names or extending the "range" of existing ones with additional values (like `SAGE_CHECK_KEEP_GOING=yes` vs. `SAGE_CHECK=keepgoing`; `SAGE_CHECK=ignore` e.g. would be rather ambiguous, and we unfortunately have to keep some backwards compatibility).

The biggest problem more or less unpredictable (and embarrassing) interference with other tickets... ;-)

But I'll do.

> Personally I think:

I'd suggest:
* `SAGE_CHECK=yes` - yes, deprecation warning, equivalent to `abort_on_failure` I think
* `SAGE_CHECK=abort_on_failure` - immediate build error
* `SAGE_CHECK=keep_going` - treat them as (build) errors, but try finishing the build first
* `SAGE_CHECK=ignore_failures` - really ignore, just give warnings, report *build* success
* `SAGE_CHECK=no` - do not run testsuites at all (same as empty or unset?)

 The purposes of this ticket are to
 
 * Identify what standard packages have an spkg-check file present. At the time the ticket was opened, only 19 packages had spkg-check files out of 98 packages. (Some don't need them, such as where the package just copies a database)
-* Document whether the package builds on OpenSolaris x64
 * Document whether the package passes tests when Sage is built with SAGE_CHECK="yes" on OpenSolaris x64.
+* Document whether the package passes tests when Sage is built with SAGE_CHECK="yes" on Solaris on SPARC, compiled as 32-bit.
+* Document whether the package passes tests when Sage is built with SAGE_CHECK="yes" on Solaris 10 on SPARC, compiled as 64-bit.
+* Add any **brief** notes - giving a reference to a ticket number if possible. 
 
-The following lists:
+The aim of this ticket is not to give details about build issues for the packages. The aim is to show what packages have spkg-check files, and collect data on what the results from the tests are.
 
-* The standard packages in Sage
-* Whether the package builds on OpenSolaris x64
-* Whether the package has an spkg-check file
-* Test results when running 'make' while SAGE_CHECK="yes" on OpenSolaris x64
-* Notes, with ticket number if needed for resolving test issues.

I thought about this some more. I can't see what is wrong with using this ticket to have a simple yes/no whether the package has a `spkg-check` file. If not, just provide a trac number to where that particular spkg-check file is being discussed. For gsl for instance, we have 

"Yes, but broken #9531"

So people interested know that more details of the issue can be found at #9531.  

If you feel the need to have longer comments, or more columns devoted to the status of `spkg-check` then another ticket would be better. 

When you look at the `spkg-install` and `spkg-check` it is worrying how many simple ignore errors. Sometimes they get reported, but don't exit with 1. Other times they are just ignored.

No, you misunderstood me. There's nothing wrong with your ticket, I just thought we should *in addition* collect spkg information, e.g. on another ticket. I haven't opened a new one yet, though what you collected so far is already worth stealing.
