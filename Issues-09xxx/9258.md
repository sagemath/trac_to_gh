Fricas seems to have an api change which breaks a few tests in fricas.py.

```
def _sage_domain(self):
        """
        A helper function for converting FriCAS domains to the corresponding
        Sage object.
        
        EXAMPLES::
        
            sage: fricas('Integer').sage() #optional - fricas
            Integer Ring
            sage: fricas('Fraction Integer').sage() #optional - fricas
            Rational Field
            sage: fricas('DoubleFloat').sage() #optional - fricas
            Real Double Field

        """
```

These now give either a different return value or simply results in raising a NotImplementedError.
