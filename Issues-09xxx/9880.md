b = [var('b_%s'%i) for i in range(4)]

precomp = (2^b_2 + 2)*(2^b_1 + 2^(-b_1) + 2^b_1*2^b_0 - 2^b_1*2^(-b_0)

The following patches are for the Sage library to enable access to the PyNaC order and randomly test that it is a SWO:

```

The bug happened because of the comparison functions which are used in a call to std::sort.

I have finally looked at the comparison functions and exchanging :

```
cmpval = seq[0].coeff.compare(other.exponent);
```
by

```
cmpval = -seq[0].coeff.compare(other.exponent);
```
in mul::compare_pow (mul.cpp:1265) seems to prevent the above bug from happening.

It seems to fit better with the change made by William Stein in power::compare_same_type (power.cpp:951).

However it doesn't mean the problem is completely solved...

I'll try to take a deeper look at the comparison functions at some point.

I tested the above fix with pynac 0.2.1.

We've been working on a patch to fix the issue.

Original discussion is here:

http://groups.google.com/group/pynac-devel/browse_thread/thread/a36020bf9208bf08/abdf6671ef0b926a#abdf6671ef0b926a

Burcin produced a patch restoring GiNaC original order for internal use and using the new ones only for printing ; thus fixing the bug.

I then worked on top of it to get a more consistent order.

You can test them using pynac 0.2.1 from [#9901](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/search/opensearch?q=ticket%3A9901) ("cd spkg/standard/pynac-0.2.1/src/" then "hg import" both patches and build/install, you should "./sage -b" if upgrading from a previous version of pynac).

I don't consider that version as definitve, but would like to get some feedback on the order used for printing.

I don't use everything pynac provides so it is more than probable that some expression are not correctly printed now.

Do not hesitate to report it.

I'd like to test this at some point, but have two problems. 

- There is too much C++ for me to review it properly, unless a lot of it really is just reverting.  Is there an easy way to figure out what is actual new code, and what is going back to something more-or-less Ginac?

- I am not sure exactly what sort of expressions would not be properly printed.  Can you give any kind of example of what sort of bad behavior to look for with testing (perhaps randomized)?

<a id='comment:10'></a>I guess there are two main parts in this ticket, I did not have a look for a long time, so all this should be taken carefully :

- Burcin patch which (more or less) revert the internal ordering in Pynac to the original one in Ginac and create new methods to use a different order for printing. We could maybe only apply the part reverting the internal order to Ginac original one to get the bug solved and close this ticket.

- However, it is not a solution to use Ginac order for printing because it is quite random and unpredictable, it depends on variable order creation among others.

- I think there is still work to do regarding expressions manipulation (see #9989)

- I don't really have an idea of what could get misprinted with Burcin+my patch applied. You could try multivariate polynomials to check it follows degrevlex, then such expressions times exponentials and let me know what you feel.

* indeed the specific instance of the bug mentionned here is no longer present
* however, it does not mean that the bug is solved because:
  * nothing changed in pynac (IIRC)

By the way, the problem of different ordering on different architecture should still be present (10187#!comment:39).

```
The expression for f should get (a little bit) simplified.

For example, there are different summands where the only symbolic expressions used are (2!<sup>b_2)!</sup>-2 and they should get automatically gathered when pynac creates the object.

In fact calling expand() method on f gives you the right expression, but if things were working correctly you should not have to do this.

    "body": "<a id='comment:17'></a>The detailed description of the segfault mentionned here is available in the discussion mentionned in the ticket description.\n\nI'll put it here so that everybody finds it:\n\n* the segfault happens in a call to std::sort() in a call to compare() because the ordering used by pynac is not a strict weak ordering. so it is kind of random. and I think youre bug is completely unrelated.\n* the piece of code in the ticket description do not produce the segfault anymore since sage 4.6.1 (still present in 4.6.0), however the order was not changed, so it could still happen with other pieces of code, so here is a backtrace produce with a previous version of sage: \n\n!#0 \u00a0GiNaC::power::compare (this=0x449be20, other=...) at !power.cpp:899 \n !#1

<a id='comment:17'></a>The detailed description of the segfault mentionned here is available in the discussion mentionned in the ticket description.

I'll put it here so that everybody finds it:

* the segfault happens in a call to std::sort() in a call to compare() because the ordering used by pynac is not a strict weak ordering. so it is kind of random. and I think youre bug is completely unrelated.
* the piece of code in the ticket description do not produce the segfault anymore since sage 4.6.1 (still present in 4.6.0), however the order was not changed, so it could still happen with other pieces of code, so here is a backtrace produce with a previous version of sage:

`std::sort` with anything but a strict weak ordering is a receipe for disaster. It is expected to crash, and it does in the example. So you are saying that we must never use GiNaC internal order for sorting.

I take it that `expair_is_greater_degrevlex` does implement a strict weak ordering, so it is safe to use with `std::sort`?

Is the patch in this ticket still relevant or has this been fixed elsewhere?

AFAIK the two patches here are still necessary, the segfault disappeared (!?!) but i still get some problems with automatic simplification as shown in http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/9880#comment:15.

- the first patch (by Burcin) reverts the original GiNaC ordering for internal use (e.g. to be used in call to std::sort) in pynac and use the modified order only for printing (it should also be uesd at some point for operands access and so on).

- the second one (by me) should be applied on top of the first one and tries to polish the order used for printing so that is looks more like degrevlex.

It should not be much more difficult to implement other orders for printing (and operands access).

I have no idea why GiNaC order is not an SWO, my point was just to link that page where the GiNaC devs state it is not one.

However I never had problems with it so far, so maybe it is a SWO and the statement in GiNaC doc is just wrong.

We should post on GiNaC mailing list to get more info on that one. Maybe Burcin knows also.

What is definitely sure is that the modified order used in pynac is not correct. Because of it the result of a call to std::sort is flawed. This can be not too harmful (e.g. automatic simplification does not occur because terms which should be adjacent in the internal structure are not) but can also lead to segfaults (even if that dramatic side effect seems to depend on something mysterious, potentially on the gcc version used as you stated).

So at least for me, using the original GiNaC order solves many problems.

Calling the _cmp_ method of an expression should give you access to pynac internal ordering (i.e. with the patched spkg, it is GiNaC original ordering; with the old one you would get the modified order currently used by pynac).

For example (with the new spkg):

```
sage: var('a b')
(a, b)
sage: x._cmp_(a)
1
sage: a._cmp_(b)
1
sage: a+b
a + b
sage: x+a
a + x

```
In GiNaC order, vars are ordered according to creation order iirc. So here we have x (automatically created) > a > b.

For printing, we use lexicographic order a > b > x and print bigger terms first.

To check it the only current way is to look at what gets printed, the internal ordering is used for everything else.

I'll try to post a minimal patch to have access to that order in sage.

I don't think this order and the old one will coincide and a lot of doctests will have to be fixed if we use it.
I'll try to have a look at all of this soon, I must admit I did not touch that code since my last post here.
> * Don't we also need to modify the operand access functions (at least the one in Sage - not the .op() function of ginac) to return the operands in the sorted order, not the stored (somewhat random) order?
 
I think you are right.
I did not test it but it should return unexpected values with the new code.
I'll include that when the new order seems consistent.
> BTW, Jean-Pierre, I wouldn't mind at all if you want to cut the new pynac release yourself. I can provide instructions on how to do this.

Please go ahead, I'll find the time to do it.

I'm currently rebuilding everything and running some tests, but IIRC the piece of code Volker provided did not raise errors anymore.
Of course there could be other inconsistencies here and there.

<a id='comment:38'></a>I did not get inconsistencies using Volker code yet. I'll package a candidate updated spkg today so that someone can have a look at the code update in pynac.

I'll do a proper pynac release when the code is positively reviewed and Burcin tells me how to.

Here is the list of doctests failure with the new spkg:

```
I hope that all of them are trivial...

One question for Burcin: when you speak of operand access, are you thinking of #9989 or am I missing something in the current Sage code ?

<a id='comment:39'></a>A new spkg is available at http://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/~flori/sage/pynac-0.2.1.p0.spkg .

I just updated SPKG.txt and commited the changeset in comparison with pynac-0.2.1-patched.spkg .

The changes i pynac code from 0.2.1 are the result of applying:

1. [trac9880_pynac_order_burcin_original.patch](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/attachment/ticket/9880/trac9880_pynac_order_burcin_original.patch)

If you want to have access to the comparison functions used by the printing order (to stress pynac with Volker code [strict_weak_order.py](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/attachment/ticket/9880/strict_weak_order.py) for example) you must also apply the patch access_order.patch .

BTW, we should also include Volker's test script. Perhaps as a part of `sage/symbolics/random_tests.py`.

Jean-Pierre: Yes, by operand access I mean the `.operands()` and the recent `.op` from #9989.


Making a pynac release is just a matter of editing `configure.ac`, setting the version number according to the comments there and running `autoreconf` afterwards. I am not sure any more if the next pynac release should contain this. This can be pynac 0.3.0, and I will put in the patches in my queue corresponding to some of the tickets waiting on trac for 0.2.2.

Note that I imported the pynac-0.2.1 repository into bitbucket:

I hope to use the facilities there to streamline the development process.

> What remains for 'needs review' so one could review it?


Volker has changes to pynac to fix simplification of expressions involving infinity when we can't assume anything about the internal ordering.

I am trying to fix printing of `mul` objects where we get `-` right after a parenthesis, such as `-(4*cos(x)^2 - 1)*sin(x)/(-4*cos(x)^3 + 3*cos(x))`.

It might be good to update my [attachment:trac_9880-stable_operands.patch] to make it optional to use the printing order.

Then a lot of doctests need to get fixed. We also need to document that `.find()`, `.match()` and friends will not return results in a canonical order any more and that expressions constructed with `hold =True` do not print in the order provided by the user.

When building the new mul object if there is a leading minus, I think it enters an infinite loop.

And isn't there a better way to check for leading minus than to emulate printing (even at the cost of duplicating some code) ?

Since the coefficient can be any Sage type, I don't think there is any way to get that information without printing. IIRC, GiNaC handles this by defining the csgn() function appropriately, but they don't support as many types and printing styles as we do.

<a id='comment:58'></a>The latest version of the patch giving access to the internal printing functions, gives the operator() instead of the compare(...) functions.

I'm not sure this was intended, even if it is completely ok for the randomized testing.

Anyway the line using it is cmp(..) == 1, so going back to the previous semantic is also ok.

Hence I've provided a modified patch to do it.

I'll also reversed the arguments in _cmp_c_impl and get rid of the minus sign.

I do not see any reason for this choice, but if there was, please revert my change.

<a id='comment:64'></a>I've just pushed updates to my pynac patch queue that include Jean-Pierre's `numerics.patch`, a preliminary fix for `match()` and some attempts to fix the random effects of normalization of minus signs on printing. I don't expect all of these to be committed, they are work in progress.

I also uploaded a slightly changed version of Volker's doctest fix patch [attachment:trac_9880-fix_doctests_symbolic.take2.patch], and a new patch [attachment:trac_9880-fix_doctests-be.patch] fixing many more doctests which I believe to be correct.

Running the test suite on `sage/{symbolic,function}` directories after these patches shows more clearly that there is still some work to be done here. We get some random output from `.factor()`  and `.numerator()` calls (#12068), and a timeout on `sage/calculus/calculus.py` since `minpoly` doesn't terminate.


Here is my current sage patch queue in case you decide to apply the new patches:

```
trac_12068-numer_denom_ginac-fh.patch
trac_12068-denominator.patch
trac_12074-nth_root.patch
trac_9880_fix_import.patch
trac_9880_pynac_order.take2.patch
trac_9880_randomized_testing.patch

trac_9880-fix_variables_ordering.patch

I'll write to pynac-devel with more details of the remaining problems.

<a id='comment:69'></a>Attachment [trac_9880-fix_doctests-be.rebased-5.5.rc0.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket9880/trac_9880-fix_doctests-be.rebased-5.5.rc0.patch) by @burcin created at 2012-11-21 21:26:02

I rebased the patches to Sage 5.5.rc0, dropping doctest fixes that resulted in nontrivial conflicts on the way.

Volker's [attachment:trac_9880_fix_import.patch] is now on #13737.

My Sage patch queue contains Pynac 0.2.6 associated patches from #13262, #13609, #13587. The patches on this ticket might apply cleanly without those, I haven't tried.

I rebased the patches to 5.9.

Here is an example where `minpoly()` does not terminate:

```
sage: var('x')
x
sage: eqn =  x^3 + sqrt(2)*x + 5 == 0
sage: a = solve(eqn, x)[0].rhs()
sage: a
-1/2*(1/18*sqrt(3)*sqrt(8*sqrt(2) + 675) - 5/2)^(1/3)*(I*sqrt(3) + 1) - 1/6*sqrt(2)*(I*sqrt(3) - 1)/(1/18*sqrt(3)*sqrt(8*sqrt(2) + 675) - 5/2)^(1/3)
sage: QQ[a]
```
or 

```
sage: a.minpoly()
```

I think this is finally good to be tested.

There is a new Pynac spkg (it's just for testing) and updated patches on this ticket. I'm working with vanilla 5.9. Note that this ticket now depends on #13213 for the fixes to the quadratic number field ordering.

Please test and report results.

<a id='comment:72'></a>Looks fine and some hand feeded examples pass!
I guess what's left to do is:
* cleanup Volker's patch (blank lines, http://...trac... -> :trac:, becasue->because, EXAMPLE[S]: -> EXAMPLE[S]::)
* merge related paches to ease readibility for reviewers (=me?),
* add some doctests using previously failing examples: from #10833, from ticket description, from comment 15 (http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/9880#comment:15), maybe 52 http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/9880#comment:52 and 67 http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/9880#comment:67
* craft a proper spkg
* make sure it cleanly applies on 5.10.beta2 and passes all doctests
* positive review!

Burcin, are you working on this or do you prefer that I take care of correcting the doctests?
I had a look and it really looks like ordering change only, so is harmless and trivial to change.

By the way, I'm ok with all the other patches, so this should get in once we fix the doctests!

<a id='comment:77'></a>I've had a quick look at the failing doctests and think there is no real problem hidden there.

The only thing which may be a little distrubing is that now we print

```
(2*x+1)*x^2
```
rather than

```
x^2*(2*x+1)
```

This should be easily fixed in pynac hopefully, but even if not I don't think it should be a blocker.

The other disturbing thing is than fractions get automatically modified when they used not to be:

```
File "devel/sage/doc/ru/tutorial/introduction.rst", line 49, in doc.ru.tutorial.introduction
Failed example:
    k = 1/(sqrt(3)*I + 3/4 + sqrt(73)*5/9); k
Expected:
    1/(I*sqrt(3) + 5/9*sqrt(73) + 3/4)
Got:
    36/(20*sqrt(73) + 36*I*sqrt(3) + 27)
```

Apart from that we also get a lot of nicer things now (in addition to bug fixes) than before.

<a id='comment:81'></a>Thanks Burcin!
I was finally going to do it today, but you were faster than me.
At least I can give it a try on beta4 and check there is nothing else to fix (all other patches apply cleanly.

I'd really like other people (let's say at least one) to have a look at the new order before you finalize 3.0 (or if it's already finalized/tagged in your repo make a 3.1 or 3.0.1) in case we want to make minimal changes.
E.g. I don't reallylike the following, but do not really mind as well:

But it would be really better to make these changes, if we plan to make them, before merging the ticket, so that people preparing books (I'm thinking of the french book which is in the process of being published) can expect their examples to pass for a quite long amount of time (or at least not to fail in the next version of Sage).

I agree. This is the reason I set this ticket to needs review even though it was failing tests all over the library. :)

I tagged the 0.3.0 release already, but I can easily make a 0.3.1 if necessary.

Feel free to submit patches to pynac with necessary changes. I don't have time to work on this any more right now, but I can spare some minutes to make a new release with simple patches.

That said, I'd really like this ticket to go in as soon as possible. It really is not fun to maintain the patch with the doctest fixes.
