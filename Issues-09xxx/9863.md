Well, right now I can't even get it to fail when running 

```
sage -t -long "devel/sage/sage/graphs/genus.pyx"
```
by itself.  I can only get it to fail reliably if I use parallel testing, say

```
sage -tp 2 -long "devel/sage/sage/graphs/"
```
I tried running the testsuite from one window and "sage -t ... genus.pyx" in another, but that didn't fail, either.

> Could this be a bug in sage.misc.getusage.get_memory_usage?

Is it reasonable to get negative numbers for this?  

Should we change the test to

```
sage: get_memory_usage(t) <= 0
True
```
?

I know that python uses a garbage collector, I don't really know the detailed workings of the garbage collector, neither do I know all the internals of the implementation of the graphs code used here. But I do know that from first sight there might be a possibility that the garbage collector might collect some garbagage created by the second assignment to G in between the two "get_memory_usage" statements.

There is an easy way to rule out this possibilty by changing the test code to:

```
sage: import sage.graphs.genus
sage: G = graphs.CompleteGraph(100)
sage: H = Graph(G, implementation='c_graph', sparse=False)
sage: t = get_memory_usage()
sage: gb = sage.graphs.genus.simple_connected_genus_backtracker(H._backend._cg)
sage: gb = None  #indirect doctest
sage: get_memory_usage(t)
0.0
```
In this way, you don't overwrite the reference to graphs.CompleteGraph(100) so there is no possibility of accidental garbage collection.

I think a gc.collect would be a good thing to do right before both of the get_memory_usage statements. I think it's even better then my previous suggestion to just rename change the second asignment to G in H. The first collect would be to make sure the measurements don't get messed up by things that where collectable already at the first get_memory_usage() statement.

The second collect would be to make sure that objects not already freed by the reference counting, but could be garbage collected still get freed. This should be done since these objects also wouldn't account to a memory leak.
I suggest a code similar to the following.

```
sage: import sage.graphs.genus
sage: import gc
sage: G = graphs.CompleteGraph(100)
sage: G = Graph(G, implementation='c_graph', sparse=False)
sage: gc.collect()   #random
54
sage: t = get_memory_usage()
sage: for i in xrange(10000):
....:     gb = sage.graphs.genus.simple_connected_genus_backtracker(G._backend._cg)
....:     gb = None  #indirect doctest
....:     
sage: gc.collect()
0
sage: get_memory_usage(t)
0.0

```

ps. I added the for loop to make sure that if there really is a memory leak, it will be found. As shown in my first remark, the memory used by the tested class is insignificant.

I just reran the test and got `-0.25`.

gb = sage.graphs.genus.simple_connected_genus_backtracker(G._backend._cg)
to something else.


The observed difference in precision is probably because of the way that python prints floats.

`prstat` is **never** used on Linux - only on Solaris. To my knowledge, prstat does not exist on anything other than Solaris. 

`top` used to be commonly used on SunOS then Solaris systems, though it was never part of the operating system. But it has become increasing less useful with modern systems, so on Solaris at least, it is considered unreliable. 

The bit of code in Sage which uses `prstat` is only run on Solaris (aka SunOS) is:

```
   elif U == 'sunos':
        # Sun's 'prstat' command appends K, M or G depending on whether 
        # the memory usage is in KB. MB or GB. So we need to strip off 
        # the letter, and convert to a consistent unit of MB. 
        memory_in_KB_MB_or_GB = top().split()[3]
        if memory_in_KB_MB_or_GB.endswith("K"): 
            m = float(memory_in_KB_MB_or_GB.strip("K")) / 1024
        elif memory_in_KB_MB_or_GB.endswith("M"):
            m = float(memory_in_KB_MB_or_GB.strip("M"))
        elif memory_in_KB_MB_or_GB.endswith("G"):
            m = float(memory_in_KB_MB_or_GB.strip("G")) * 1024
```

I wrote that bit, since `top` is not standard on Solaris, and even if installed, it is not very useful with modern Solaris versions. 

These small numbers however are not going to be coming from the output of the `top` command either. 

Dave

This tests a leaky Cython function:

```python
cython('from stdlib cimport *\ndef leak(m=100000):\n    cdef double *arr = <double *>malloc(m * sizeof(double))')

def g(n=100, m=100000):
    import gc
#    import sage.graphs.genus
#    G = graphs.CompleteGraph(100)
#    G = Graph(G, implementation='c_graph', sparse=False)
    gc.collect()
    t = get_memory_usage()
    for i in xrange(n):
        leak(m)
#        gb = sage.graphs.genus.simple_connected_genus_backtracker(G._backend._cg)
#        gb = None  #indirect doctest
    gc.collect()
    return get_memory_usage(t)
```
For large enough `n` and `m`, `g(n,m) > 0.0`, but the threshold values will vary from system to system (because of `get_memory_usage`'s implementation, etc.).
