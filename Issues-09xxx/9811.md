I wanted to do some testing of Sage in a loop and would check the return code to see if what I used worked or not. But this is impossible, as Sage appears to exit with 0, even if it should not have. In the example below, I try to install a non-existent package using Sage. The return code in a case like this should be non-zero, but it is not.

The same happens if one uses `sage -i` to install a package. If it fails, the exit code is still 0. 

In contrast, if I try this with a well written command like `ls`

```
drkirkby@hawk:~/sage-4.5.2$ ls some-non-existant-package
some-non-existant-package: No such file or directory
drkirkby@hawk:~/sage-4.5.2$ $?

```

the exit code is non-zero - in this case 2.

Also on a similar theme is #9799, showing that `make` can exit with the wrong code too.

Well, you did `sage -f ...` ...

A well written command like `rm` exits with a zero status if you use `-f`:

```sh
leif@quadriga:~/Sage/spkgs/mpir-2.1.1$ rm -f non-existent-package ; echo $?
0
```

I wonder what Sage returns if you do `sage -i ...` instead... ;-)

Btw, `sage-spkg` has lots of other flaws. I'm considering writing (and using) my own version, since I doubt the bunch of changes I aim at would get merged soon... (Same for the top-level Makefile, which by the way was named `makefile`, I guess by some DOS programmer.)

Hopefully not too many people read our tickets... :D

The Sage. It still exits with an exit code of zero.

From `sage-sage`:

```sh
...

   cd "$SAGE_ROOT/spkg"
   if [ $# -lt 2 ]; then
       sage-spkg
       exit $?

   SAGE_LOGS="$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/logs"
   if [ ! -d "$SAGE_LOGS" ]; then
       mkdir -p "$SAGE_LOGS"
   fi
   for PKG in "$@"
   do
       echo "Calling sage-spkg on $PKG"
       PKG_NAME=`echo "$PKG" | sed -e "s/\.spkg$//"`
       PKG_NAME=`basename "$PKG_NAME"`
       case $PKG in
       /*)
           sage-spkg $OPT "$PKG" 2>&1 | (trap "" SIGINT; tee -a ../install.log "$SAGE_LOGS/$PKG_NAME".log)

           sage-spkg $OPT "$CUR/$PKG" 2>&1 | (trap "" SIGINT; tee -a ../install.log "$SAGE_LOGS/$PKG_NAME".log)
       ;;
       esac

       if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
          exit 1
       fi
       shift
   done
   exit $?

...
if [ "$1" = '-i' ]; then

   echo "Installing $@"
   install " " "$@"
fi

if [ "$1" = '-f' ]; then
   shift
   echo "Force installing $@"
   install -f "$@"

...
```

So once again, we get the exit status of `tee` rather than that of `sage-spkg`.
