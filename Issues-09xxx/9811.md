The same happens if one uses `sage -i` to install a package. If it fails, the exit code is still 0. 

In contrast, if I try this with a well written command like `ls`

```
drkirkby@hawk:~/sage-4.5.2$ ls some-non-existant-package
some-non-existant-package: No such file or directory
drkirkby@hawk:~/sage-4.5.2$ $?

```

the exit code is non-zero - in this case 2.

Also on a similar theme is #9799, showing that `make` can exit with the wrong code too.

Well, you did `sage -f ...` ...

A well written command like `rm` exits with a zero status if you use `-f`:

```sh
leif@quadriga:~/Sage/spkgs/mpir-2.1.1$ rm -f non-existent-package ; echo $?
0
```

I wonder what Sage returns if you do `sage -i ...` instead... ;-)

Btw, `sage-spkg` has lots of other flaws. I'm considering writing (and using) my own version, since I doubt the bunch of changes I aim at would get merged soon... (Same for the top-level Makefile, which by the way was named `makefile`, I guess by some DOS programmer.)

Hopefully not too many people read our tickets... :D

The Sage. It still exits with an exit code of zero.

So once again, we get the exit status of `tee` rather than that of `sage-spkg`.
