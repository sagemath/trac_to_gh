I wanted to do some testing of Sage in a loop and would check the return code to see if what I used worked or not. But this is impossible, as Sage appears to exit with 0, even if it should not have. In the example below, I try to install a non-existent package using Sage. The return code in a case like this should be non-zero, but it is not.

The same happens if one uses `sage -i` to install a package. If it fails, the exit code is still 0. 

In contrast, if I try this with a well written command like `ls`

```
drkirkby@hawk:~/sage-4.5.2$ ls some-non-existant-package

the exit code is non-zero - in this case 2.

Also on a similar theme is #9799, showing that `make` can exit with the wrong code too.

Well, you did `sage -f ...` ...

A well written command like `rm` exits with a zero status if you use `-f`:

```sh
leif@quadriga:~/Sage/spkgs/mpir-2.1.1$ rm -f non-existent-package ; echo $?
0
```

I wonder what Sage returns if you do `sage -i ...` instead... ;-)

Btw, `sage-spkg` has lots of other flaws. I'm considering writing (and using) my own version, since I doubt the bunch of changes I aim at would get merged soon... (Same for the top-level Makefile, which by the way was named `makefile`, I guess by some DOS programmer.)

Hopefully not too many people read our tickets... :D

From `sage-sage`:

       echo "Calling sage-spkg on $PKG"

       PKG_NAME=`basename "$PKG_NAME"`

fi

if [ "$1" = '-f' ]; then
   shift

So once again, we get the exit status of `tee` rather than that of `sage-spkg`.

Attached patch fixes the exit code (by using `pipestatus`) and a few minor things in that area of `sage-sage`.

(I haven't changed more since there are other tickets already touching `sage-sage` especially there, which may need *slight* rebasing on the patch here though.)
