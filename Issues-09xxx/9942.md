With the optional CHomP package in 4.5.3 on sage.math, I get some doctest failures:

```python
sage -t -long -only-optional=chomp "devel/sage/sage/homology/cell_complex.py"
**********************************************************************
File "/mnt/usb1/scratch/mpatel/tmp/sage-4.5.3-chomp/devel/sage/sage/homology/cell_complex.py", line 470:
    sage: S2.homology(dim=2, generators=True)  # optional - CHomP
Expected:
    (Z, [(0, 1, 2) - (0, 1, 3) + (0, 2, 3) - (1, 2, 3)])
Got:
    (Z, [-(0, 1, 2) + (0, 1, 3) - (0, 2, 3) + (1, 2, 3)])
```
