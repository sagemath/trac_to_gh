When defining a point on the Jacobian of a Hyperellptic curve, 
if a coordinate is an integer, it does not get coerced to polynomial and the following error raised:
raise TypeError, "Argument P (= %s) must have length 2."%P
For example:

```
sage: F.<a> = GF(3)
sage: R.<x> = F[]
sage: f = x^5-1
sage: C = HyperellipticCurve(f)
sage: J = C.jacobian()
sage: X = J(F)
sage: a = x^2-x+1
sage: b = -x +1
sage: c = x-1
sage: d = 0 
sage: D1 = X([a,b])
sage: D2 = X([c,d])

Those double colon lines should look like they do in the examples here:

http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/conventions.html

Without those extra newlines, it won't process correctly. Also, the code coming after a double colon should be further indented than the colons.
