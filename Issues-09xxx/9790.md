Here are some some questions and comments regarding the Sage tutorial.

1. in tour_algebra.rst "x_{i} is the displacement from equilibrium of mass i, " should it be
of mass "m_{i}" ?

2. in tour_algebra.rst:  "Several orthogonal polynomials and special functions are implemented, using both PARI [GAP]"
   the reference should be [GP]

3. In tour_plotting.rst: "In both the notebook and the REPL, ..."
What is "REPL"?

4. Also, it would be nice to include the actual plot in tour_plotting.rst

5.  In tour_numtheory.rst The sentence "Much work has been done
implementing rings of integers in (...) p-adic fields or number fields
other than . " is not complete

A dictionary is unordered, as the last output illustrates."
