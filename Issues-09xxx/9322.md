[See #15608 for a list of open simon_two_descent tickets]

[NB This is a different problem from the one on #5153]

Chris Wuthrich reports:

```
sage: K.<w> = NumberField(x^2-x-232)
sage: E = EllipticCurve([2-w,18+3*w,209+9*w,2581+175*w,852-55*w])
sage: E.local_data()
[]
sage: E.simon_two_descent(verbose=2)
```
This takes about 2.5 minutes with Sage 4.7.1 on a 1.6Ghz Core 2 Duo.

The same example runs fine in gp using the same version of the script ell.gp that Sage has (in version 4.4.4) and the same version of gp.

With 4.7.alpha1 this works fine:

```
sage: K.<w> = NumberField(x^2-x-232)                                   
sage: E = EllipticCurve([2-w,18+3*w,209+9*w,2581+175*w,852-55*w])      
sage: E.local_data()                                                   
[]
sage: E.simon_two_descent()                                      
(0, 2, [])
```
but after #11005 (which updates to a newer version of Simon's GP scripts) we run into an infinite loop:

```
 **** Warning: doubling the real precision in nfsign_s **** 76
 **** Warning: doubling the real precision in nfsign_s **** 152
 **** Warning: doubling the real precision in nfsign_s **** 76
 **** Warning: doubling the real precision in nfsign_s **** 152
 **** Warning: doubling the real precision in nfsign_s **** 76
```
which I will test on a stand-alone gp and report upstream.

I've been struggling with that bug for a few hours, and have made only little progress.
With Sage 4.7.1 and Pari 2.4.3 (development), I've noticed that Pari 2.4.3 and the version of Pari within Sage differ at `bbnf = bnfinit(rnfeq[1],1)` in `ell.gp`, where

```
rnfep[1] = x^6 + 625*x^5 + 135916*x^4 + 14984560*x^3 + 914453072*x^2 + 29502178560*x + 392635160576}}}.

Pari 2.4.3 returns {{{bbnf: [Mat(2), Mat([0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, ...}}} whereas
Pari within Sage returns {{{bbnf: [Mat(2), Mat([0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, ...}}}

However I don't know if {{{bnfinit}}} should be deterministic...

is there a way to get the output of the print commands from the ell.gp script
when it is called from within Sage? Even with a large value of DEBUGLEVEL_ell, the output
of those print statements does not appear in the Sage session, thus it is difficult to debug.

You can get a whole gp session logged to a file by setting gp=Gp(logfile=foobar.txt').  But the code in gp-simon.py creates its own gp instance without using the logfile option.  In the short term, edit line 38 of sage/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/gp-simon.py to add the logfile option.  A better long-term solution would be to have a logfile parameter to the two-descent function itself and pass that on.

By the way, there are new version of Simon's scripts which in Sage Days in March (6 months ago!) I got working in a better way, using gp2c to convert to C code.  There was some reason which I now cannot remember why there was a delay in getting this merged, and after 6 months I fear that the patches we made then would no longer work.  Damn.  Anyway, I strongly suggest if you have problem cases that you run the curves directly through ell.gp (outside Sage) using the newest version of ell.gp from Simon's web page, since you may be seeing a problem which has already been fixed.

thank you John for your advice. After trying it, I figured out that with Sage 4.7.1 on my laptop
in fact the example in the description actually works, but takes about 2.5 minutes, during which
top reports that the gp process takes 100% of the cpu time, while evaluating the command

```
ans=bnfellrank(K, [-a + 2,3*a + 18,9*a + 209,175*a + 2581,-55*a + 852]);;
```
Can someone else confirm? Maybe a problem in the Sage-gp interface?
What should we do with that ticket?

ok, I found where the problem comes from. In the file `ellQ.gp` which is also loaded by the

```
gp_simon.py}}} file, the global constants {{{LIM1, LIM3, LIMTRIV}}} have different values than
in {{{ell.gp}}}, respectively 5, 50, 50 instead of 2, 4, 2.

The slow behaviour can be reproduced with {{{sage -gp}}} if one reads both {{{ell.gp}}}
*and* {{{ellQ.gp}}}. If one only reads {{{ell.gp}}}, it is fast. Apparently {{{ellQ.gp}}} is not
needed for this computation.

Moreover the default values in Sage are again different: 5, 50, 10.

With 5, 5, 10 it takes only 1.45s (wall clock time) on my laptop.
With 5, 10, 10 it takes 2.19s.
With 5, 20, 10 it takes 11.63s.

Note that those values should be modified both in {{{ell_number_field.py}}} and in
{{{gp_simon.py}}} (the former function is critical in this example).

One should also share the default values for {{{lim1, lim3, limtriv}}} between the
{{{simon_two_descent}}} functions in {{{ell_number_field.py}}} and {{{gp_simon.py}}}.

I have implemented the above suggestions. However, it seems that the using limbigprime=0 raises errors (I found them when using gp directly) and so I have currently set it to 30 (DS's default).

When simon_two_descent() is called with default arguments, the infinite-order points change (this is expected). I have checked that the answer is still correct (in particular, the rank bounds are the same), and changed the doctests (which affected four files in total).

Now the doctests pass for everything in the schemes/elliptic_curves folder, but I haven't run all the others.

The failing example is the new doctest from #16009 in `gp_simon.py`; it now returns `(0, 0, [])`.

```
sage: F.<a> = QuadraticField(29)
sage: x = QQ['x'].gen()
sage: K.<b> = F.extension(x^2-1/2*a+1/2)
sage: E = EllipticCurve(K,[1, 0, 5/2*a + 27/2, 0, 0])
sage: E.simon_two_descent(lim1=2, limtriv=3)
(1, 1, [((-369/50*a - 1987/50)*b + 539/50*a + 2897/50 : (-27193/250*a - 146439/250)*b + 39683/250*a + 213709/250 : 1)])
```
This is reproducible inside `gp` (2.5.x) with the current version of Simon's script (as included in Sage since #11005):

```
K = bnfinit(y^4 + y^2 - 7);
a = Mod(y, K.pol);
E = [1, 0, 5*a^2 + 16, 0, 0];
LIM1 = 2;
LIMTRIV = 3;
bnfellrank(K, E)
```
This returns `[0, 0, []]`.
