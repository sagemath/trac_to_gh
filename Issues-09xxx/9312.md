Is there any way to test this package? There's no spkg-check. 

Whoever put this package together has their own unique style, with each line ending in '&&'. 

I'll try to sort out the SAGE64 stuff.

It would be better if the person that put it together looked over some other spkg-install files and the Sage Developers Guide.

<a id='comment:3'>Comment 3:</a>
Is there any good reason to use version 4.42, when the latest is 4.44? 

Would it be more sensible if I created a completely fresh package, then some others test that? 

I feel it would be simpler to start this from scratch. 

I'll be travelling later, and will not have access to any SPARC systems, but I can get somewhere with this on my OpenSolaris laptop.

I was under the same impression, but apparently that has changed. I don't think this is relevant here, since this ticket isn't even about making GLPK standard anyway! I'd mention this on sage-devel instead.

{
    "body": "<a id='comment:7'>Comment 7:</a>\nI've updated this package somewhat\n\nhttp://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/patches/glpk-4.44.spkg\n\nto fix what were quite a number of problems with how the package was put together. I've not tested this as a library. Someone more knowledgeable can test this properly. I've only tested it on Solaris and OpenSolaris to see that it builds ok and passes the self-tests in the source code.\n\nI've not changed any of the python stuff, so it should be unchanged. The major change was to disable building of the static libraries, which I doubt Python needs. \n\n## Changes made\n\n* Updated to the latest upstream code, version 4.44.\n* Added code to allow a 64-bit build on any platform.\n  If SAGE64 is set to \"yes\", the compiler flag -m64 is added\n  by default. That flag works with GCC and SunStudio, but not\n  all compilers - IBM's compiler for AIX and HP's for HP-UX\n  both use different flags to create a 64-bit build.\n  If the compiler does not use -m64 for 64-bit builds, then\n  the environment variable CFLAG64 can be set to indicate what\n  flag gets added.\n* Added a file spkg-check so the self-test code is built.\n  This includes code which will add the appropriate flag\n  for 64-bit builds if the test procedures need code to be\n  compiled. (Sometimes running 'make test' actually needs\n  the compiler flags set properly, so I do it just in case.\n  It appears to be unnecessary with this version of GLPK,\n  but might with later releases.\n* Added the configure option --with-gmp which will speed up\n  processing of large integers (see src/INSTALL)\n* Added the configure option --disable-static since there is\n  no need to build static libraries. (see src/INSTALL)\n* Added the configure option --with-zlib. Adding this allows\n  GLPK API routines and the stand-alone solver to read and\n  write compressed data files performing compression and\n  decompression \"on the fly\" (see src/INSTALL)\n* Removed linking of the 'ld' library in spkg-install, as the\n  reason for it being added was not clear.\n* Corrected SPKG.txt to indicate this code is GPL 3.\n  (see src/COPYING)\n* Added the ChangeLog section to the SPKG.txt file\n* Added zlib, python and mpir as dependencies in SPKG.txt\n* Checked that the configure script actually does configure\n  properly, if not exits.\n* Checked that 'make' does build the code properly, if not exits.\n* Checked that 'make install' does actually install the library\n* Checked that running 'python setup.py install' does actually work.\n  If this is not done, code can appear to install properly as it\n  passes 'configure', 'make' and 'make install'. So unusually there\n  are 4 cases where spkg-install can fail.\n\n == Desirable changes not made ==\n* There is a \"patch\" directory which I did not remove, as there is one file referenced there. It should be called \"patches\" and I believe from discussions on sage-devel it can perhaps be removed. \n* setup.py has no comments. \n* setup.py has lots of ../../../.. in directory entires and does not refer to $SAGE_ROOT or $SAGE_LOCAL. Since I'm not a good Python programmer, I've not attempted to fix this. \nAs you can see, if SAGE_CHECK is set to \"yes\", this passes the one self test that there is (pretty dismal IMHO)\n\n## Test system #1 (others MUST test on other hardware and test properly)\n* Sun Blade 1000\n* 2 x 900 MHz UltraSPARC III+ CPUs\n* 2 GB RAM\n* Solaris 10 03/2005 (first release of Solaris 10)\n* gcc 4.4.3 (uses Sun linker and assembler)\n* SEAGATE-ST3146807FC 2 Gbit/s 15,000 rpm fiber channel disk (FCAL)\n* UFS (not ZFS) local file system.\n* Sage 4.4.4.alpha1\n* GLPK 4.44 source code integrated. \n\n```\nRemoving /export/home/drkirkby/sage-4.4.4.alpha1/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/UNKNOWN-0.0.0-py2.6.egg-info\nWriting /export/home/drkirkby/sage-4.4.4.alpha1/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/UNKNOWN-0.0.0-py2.6.egg-info\n\nreal\t3m13.451s\nuser\t2m41.607s\nsys\t0m28.154s\nSuccessfully installed glpk-4.44\nRunning the test suite.\nGLPK will now be tested\nMaking check in include\nmake[1]: Entering directory `/export/home/drkirkby/sage-4.4.4.alpha1/spkg/build/glpk-4.44/src/include'\nmake[1]: Nothing to be done for `check'.\nmake[1]: Leaving directory `/export/home/drkirkby/sage-4.4.4.alpha1/spkg/build/glpk-4.44/src/include'\nMaking check in src\nmake[1]: Entering directory `/export/home/drkirkby/sage-4.4.4.alpha1/spkg/build/glpk-4.44/src/src'\nmake[1]: Nothing to be done for `check'.\nmake[1]: Leaving directory `/export/home/drkirkby/sage-4.4.4.alpha1/spkg/build/glpk-4.44/src/src'\nMaking check in examples\nmake[1]: Entering directory `/export/home/drkirkby/sage-4.4.4.alpha1/spkg/build/glpk-4.44/src/examples'\n./glpsol --version\nGLPSOL: GLPK LP/MIP Solver, v4.44\n\nCopyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008,\n2009, 2010 Andrew Makhorin, Department for Applied Informatics, Moscow\nAviation Institute, Moscow, Russia.

<a id='comment:7'>Comment 7:</a>
I've updated this package somewhat

http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/patches/glpk-4.44.spkg

to fix what were quite a number of problems with how the package was put together. I've not tested this as a library. Someone more knowledgeable can test this properly. I've only tested it on Solaris and OpenSolaris to see that it builds ok and passes the self-tests in the source code.

I've not changed any of the python stuff, so it should be unchanged. The major change was to disable building of the static libraries, which I doubt Python needs. 

## Changes made

* Updated to the latest upstream code, version 4.44.
* Added code to allow a 64-bit build on any platform.
  If SAGE64 is set to "yes", the compiler flag -m64 is added
  by default. That flag works with GCC and SunStudio, but not
  all compilers - IBM's compiler for AIX and HP's for HP-UX
  both use different flags to create a 64-bit build.
  If the compiler does not use -m64 for 64-bit builds, then
  the environment variable CFLAG64 can be set to indicate what
  flag gets added.
* Added a file spkg-check so the self-test code is built.
  This includes code which will add the appropriate flag
  for 64-bit builds if the test procedures need code to be
  compiled. (Sometimes running 'make test' actually needs
  the compiler flags set properly, so I do it just in case.
  It appears to be unnecessary with this version of GLPK,
  but might with later releases.
* Added the configure option --with-gmp which will speed up
  processing of large integers (see src/INSTALL)
* Added the configure option --disable-static since there is
  no need to build static libraries. (see src/INSTALL)
* Added the configure option --with-zlib. Adding this allows
  GLPK API routines and the stand-alone solver to read and
  write compressed data files performing compression and
  decompression "on the fly" (see src/INSTALL)
* Removed linking of the 'ld' library in spkg-install, as the
  reason for it being added was not clear.
* Corrected SPKG.txt to indicate this code is GPL 3.
  (see src/COPYING)
* Added the ChangeLog section to the SPKG.txt file
* Added zlib, python and mpir as dependencies in SPKG.txt
* Checked that the configure script actually does configure
  properly, if not exits.
* Checked that 'make' does build the code properly, if not exits.
* Checked that 'make install' does actually install the library
* Checked that running 'python setup.py install' does actually work.
  If this is not done, code can appear to install properly as it
  passes 'configure', 'make' and 'make install'. So unusually there
  are 4 cases where spkg-install can fail.

 == Desirable changes not made ==
* There is a "patch" directory which I did not remove, as there is one file referenced there. It should be called "patches" and I believe from discussions on sage-devel it can perhaps be removed. 
* setup.py has no comments. 
* setup.py has lots of ../../../.. in directory entires and does not refer to $SAGE_ROOT or $SAGE_LOCAL. Since I'm not a good Python programmer, I've not attempted to fix this. 
As you can see, if SAGE_CHECK is set to "yes", this passes the one self test that there is (pretty dismal IMHO)

## Test system #1 (others MUST test on other hardware and test properly)
* Sun Blade 1000
* 2 x 900 MHz UltraSPARC III+ CPUs
* 2 GB RAM
* Solaris 10 03/2005 (first release of Solaris 10)
* gcc 4.4.3 (uses Sun linker and assembler)
* SEAGATE-ST3146807FC 2 Gbit/s 15,000 rpm fiber channel disk (FCAL)
* UFS (not ZFS) local file system.
* Sage 4.4.4.alpha1
* GLPK 4.44 source code integrated.

You should put more information than just "Debian laptop". Things like version of Debian, processor, RAM, gcc version etc can all be useful. Note what I put above about my SPARC system. The only really unnecessary info was the disks and file systems, as I'd cut-n-pasted that from a ticket where it was relevant, and forgot to remove it.

I'm going to upload revised versions of 'deps' and 'deps.diff'. This removes the dependency of GLPK on Python, so GLPK can be built before Python, or in parallel with Python - it does not need to wait for Python. 

This should improve the parallel build process. I made it a dependency on Python before, since there was a call to python in spkg-install, but since Nathann has removed that, so the dependency can be removed. 

Here's the MD5 checksums of the two files. I'm just going to overwrite these on the ticket. 

```
drkirkby@hawk:~$ digest -a md5 deps deps.diff
(deps) = 8ddc6b0fcc9445ba566fa647451d871c
(deps.diff) = 5e9a409b2ec49f00039802b20a28d7cd
```

Robert can decide whether he merges it or not. 

I've also attached a diff from the deps in this package - you can see the changes are minor.

A new patch to remove the #optional GLPK from Sage's code.

I know 2 or 3 are still missing in other files, which I will remove later in another patch to simplify - now useless - code. I leave them here for the moment as touching it would conflict with other patches already written.

It looks to me as though cython should be a prerequisite for glpk in spkg/standard/deps.  From setup.py:

```
from Cython.Distutils import build_ext
```
When I tried to build Sage on sage.math (using parallel spkg building), it bombed when it got to glpk because of this issue.

Yes, and sage-4.5.alpha4 will be a very short release, so that people can actually test GLPK.

Nathann,

What are you talking about? I don't see one anywhere in the GLPK spkg that was merged into sage-4.5.alpha3.

That's what I mean ! There is no setup.py in the glpk SPKG embedded in alpha 3, and so no reason at all to make it dependent on Cython !

Nathann is saying there is no setup.py, so there should be no need for Cython. I agree with this. 

As Robert knows, I did a quick hack of a 'deps' file to 

* Add Cython as a dependency of GLPK
* Sort out the parallel building stuff. 

which I posted a link to (much to Roberts dislike). Sage built ok with that. 

Having seen Nathann's comments, I hacked this file again and removed the Cython dependency, so now the GLPK entry says:

```
$(INST)/$(GLPK): $(BASE) $(INST)/$(MPIR) $(INST)/$(ZLIB)
        $(INSTALL) "$(SAGE_SPKG) $(GLPK) 2>&1" "tee -a $(SAGE_LOGS)/$(GLPK).log"
```

i.e. it was back to what I had before. Sage still built ok. So I agree with Nathann, there seems no need for Cython to be a dependency of GLPK. Whatever the reasons for the failed build by someone, it was not a lack of Cython. 

I think until a release is made with all the parallel issues resolved, building will be unrelieable in parallel, and may throw up some 'red herrings'. What appears to be due to X, might in fact be due to Y.
