I think the problem is that the _indices list was created before input sorting, so after the sort its elements pointed to the wrong locations. For example in the case ["a", "b", "a", "b"] indices looked like [0, 1] what corresponds to the original data (0->a, 1->b), but after the sort the content of _s was ["a", "a", "b", "b"], so 0 and 1 both pointed to "a".
