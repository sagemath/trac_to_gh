This is inconsistent

```
sage: Rational(3)%Rational(-1)
ZeroDivisionError: Inverse does not exist.
```

but

```
sage: 3%(-1)
0

This is caused by the following simpler bug:

```

sage: a=Integer(3)
sage: b=Integer(-1)
sage: a.inverse_mod(b)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ZeroDivisionError                         Traceback (most recent call last)
...

ZeroDivisionError: Inverse does not exist.
```
which is easy to fix.  In `sage.rings.integer.Integer.inverse_mod` there is special case for modulus n=1 but not for -1.  Either ass this special case, or replace n by abs(n).

The patch looks right and I tested that it works (but did not yet test the whole library).

BUT you need to add a doctest to show that the bug has been fixed.  There's a similar doctest in the same function, so just add something similar.

Then I'll look at it again.
