Currently, one has to do something like one of these.

Yes.  You could define your own function :) (see 
http://sage.cs.drake.edu/home/pub/2/, for example).  Also, mpmath and 
numpy/scipy can get numerical values for the coefficients, I believe. 
Maxima also can construct a lagrange polynomial (load the 'interpol' 
package) 
sage: maxima.load('interpol') 
"/home/jason/sage-4.4.2/local/share/maxima/5.20.1/share/numeric/interpol.ma c" 
sage: maxima.lagrange([[1,2],[3,4]]) 
-x+2*(x-1)+3 
```
That's too bad; we need to wrap this to make it very easy to get the interpolation from a list of points with one command from SR.

One thing to discuss would be whether one would want an approximate one if the coefficients were floats/RR, or always to try for an exact one.
