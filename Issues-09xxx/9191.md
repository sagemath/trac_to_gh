Create a file like this:

```
flat:tmp wstein$ cat a.spyx
print "hello"
```

We have:

```
flat:tmp wstein$ sage a.spyx
Traceback (most recent call last):

I'm a little concerned about why .pyx files worked before anyway.  Did it just make it to the 

```
os.execv(os.path.join(binpath, 'sage-python'), ['sage-python', fn] + opts)
```
line and `sage -python` (which is all `sage-python` is) just knew what to do with it?  And this is better for some reason for pyx files, right?

Also, any reason for making the messages print to stderr when they aren't errors?  As well as for changing things to the 'new' print statements?  I guess you did the work so I shouldn't complain :) but it always means I worry about missing some small detail.

Finally, if you're going to add pyx files to those which this command does, you should probably add a testing part to the doctest patch for that as well...

Replying to [@kcrisman](#comment%3A6):
> I'm a little concerned about why .pyx files worked before anyway.

They worked only because they were treated as plain Python files.  No Cython was involved.  Treating them like `.spyx` files is the logical thing to do.

> Also, any reason for making the messages print to stderr when they aren't errors?

These kind of diagnostic messages are often printed to `stderr` in Unix-land.  For example, `gcc -v` will output what it's doing to `stderr`.  This makes it much easier to use the output of the script non-interactively: if I want to run a `.spyx` file in a shell script, I have to manually remove the "Compiling..." line if its output to `stdout`.

I'm happy with simply removing the "Compiling..." line also.

> As well as for changing things to the 'new' print statements?

I really dislike the

```
print >>file
```
syntax in Python 2.  Besides, it doesn't hurt to be more compatible with Python 3.

> Finally, if you're going to add pyx files to those which this command does, you should probably add a testing part to the doctest patch for that as well...

I'm not sure, because running `.pyx` files from the command line is not documented.  The documentation suggests using `.spyx` files, not `.pyx` files.

Somewhat ironically, the second patch doesn't apply to Sage 5.4.beta2.  Does this depend on the patch which does or does not remove gcc optional from Sage?
