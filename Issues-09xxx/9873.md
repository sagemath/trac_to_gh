Many people want a Mac application, but so far none has appeared that was worthy of the name Sage.  This must change!  We need something which can launch terminal sessions, install spkg files, run and provide quicklook support for sage files.  Something that can be used as a MenuExtra, and optionally act as a primitive browser for the notebook.

Is such a thing even possible?  Yes!  In fact such an application is almost here!

Incorrect.  There are two READMEs in operation.

One is the one that gets bdisted to the top level of the dmg disk image, and has information like is on [here](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/attachment/ticket/5296/sage-README-osx.2.txt).  This one is more about the app bundle itself, not about how to use Sage for an absolute beginner.  

That doesn't mean they couldn't be combined, but for now they clearly address two different things.

Also, there's a typo in the comment on line 101 of the script patch.

Here is what appears when I do the bdist:

```
Sage works!
Copying files over to tmp directory
cp: *.sage: No such file or directory
Copying Sage library over
Making empty spkg's
There will be an error about x below that you can safely ignore.
mv: rename x to x/x: Invalid argument
If you wish to create a Mac Application please set
SAGE_APP_BUNDLE=yes
Creating dmg
(If you don't wish to create a disk image please set SAGE_APP_DMG=no)
............................................................
created: /Users/grout/sage-4.5.2/tmp/sage-4.4.2-i386-Darwin.dmg
Moving final distribution file to /Users/grout/sage/dist
```

1. The note about setting SAGE_APP_BUNDLE=yes should probably be deleted now, since it is done by default?

2. It'd be nice if the two other errors about moving/copying were taken care of, but they might be from other things in bdist and not be applicable to this ticket.

But the problem with that is that many people are probably not familiar with how these work, especially those new to computing in general.  Having a regular application is better.

The crap menu item is a legitimate sage script - see `sage-crap`, which apparently tests for random binary stuff or other things in a given folder.  But like many other things, it could be in an "advanced" menu.

I would definitely rename it in the menu then.  It looks very unprofessional.  Maybe "binary-test" or even just delete it.

That's it.  By default, I think we ought to start off supporting only the subset of things we think will be really useful to people.

One more problem I found.  If you delete (or move) your .sage directory, then there is a problem starting up the server since it requests an admin password.  Here is the log:

The same sort of thing happens if the notebook tries to upgrade an old notebook (pre-2009 or so).  The user is prompted to enter Y/N to whether they want to upgrade.

The first problem is definitely a problem, since every new user will have it happen to them.

We could check for existence of the .sage/sage_notebook.sagenb directory, which is where the sage notebook is stored by default.  If it's not there, then the notebook will be created and the password will be solicited.

Not very often any more, though it bit my postdoc mentor over the weekend.  My guess is that there will be a lot of people right off that never upgraded an old Sage version that will download the app and run into it.  But after that initial rush, I don't see this happening at all.

Maybe there ought to be a separate notebook_intialized() command that checks to see if the notebook is initialized.

How do I get the output from "sage --help" or "sage --advanced"?  If you remove menu items (like "crap"), then how do I execute "sage -crap"?  Could we have a menu item (like the current "Calculate" one) which just lets you type in any command line options you want?  Or it could be fancier and have a menu to choose a command-line option from the ones not already included.  Then you can eliminate "crap" but people can still use it if they want to.

If I select "Also Show Menu Extra", I don't see any difference.  (It's also not completely clear what it's supposed to do; could it say `Also show "Extra" menu` instead?)

I unfortunately have my terminal program set to close the window when the shell exits, so using the "Calculate" option is not ideal: it closes the window as soon as it is done executing, so I can't see it.  My only options seem to be to change this for all of my Terminal windows, or to not exit after running Sage.  Is that right?

+1 to having "Sage (advanced)" pop up a dialog box asking for command-line switches.


>

I guess because people don't know what a MenuExtra is.  Maybe changing the option to "Menu Bar Control" would be clearer?

I think we ought to delete the Calculate option.  I don't see a valuable purpose for it.

Actually, this check would take care of the upgrade issue as well.  In the upgrade case, it sees that .sage/sage_notebook.sagenb is not available, so it tries to upgrade the old sage notebook.

So: check to see if ~/.sage/sage_notebook.sagenb directory exists.  If it doesn't, start a terminal session with the notebook (or have some way for the user to interact with Sage).  If it does exist, assume that there will be no interaction and just start up normally.

As it was I think I actually was for additional menu options before I was against them ;) but really I think that for the menu, it's not as crucial, since we didn't have that before.  I also think there was a way in Preferences to execute any old command you wanted, or?  Maybe not - that should be a high priority.  \n\n(The Calculate was also based on a request of mine, but if we're shrinking the # of options, then that should go away too for now.)\n\n> If I select \"Also Show Menu Extra\", I don't see any difference.  (It's also not completely clear what it's supposed to do; could it say `Also show \"Extra\" menu` instead?)\n\n\nI think you have to restart for ALL the things in Preferences to work, not just the ones it says; at least, that's the only way I could get them to work.  I agree with Jason's comment about the Menu Extra, as I mentioned above.  However, now that I've tried it a bit, it seems that it functions in such a way that you can have Sage not running, but then almost immediately turn it on with just a mouse flick along the top, even with the various options - is that right?  \n\nRelated to that is that I did finally get the other binary to work, by dragging and selecting; the key is that you have to actually get the ./sage file, and that's probably not obvious to those who might think the folder is the 'binary', since ./sage isn't actually a compiled binary file... anyway.  I don't know whether this comment is important.  This also seems to require a restart.\n\n> I unfortunately have my terminal program set to close the window when the shell exits, so using the \"Calculate\" option is not ideal: it closes the window as soon as it is done executing, so I can't see it.  My only options seem to be to change this for all of my Terminal windows, or to not exit after running Sage.  Is that right? \n\n\nYou can set this in Preferences; in fact, Ivan's first default behavior was not to exit.\n\nRelated to this, hooray - there is only ONE window opening now!  Thanks for fixing that.  You were right that I had to delete the TerminalEmulatorList - weirdly, since I never created any new ones.\n\nRandom: when you click on an sws file it starts the browser, but doesn't *do* anything to suggest that it can't actually open them.  That seems problematic, and I don't remember that behavior in earlier versions.\n\nI also finally looked at some of the code (some of which I even understood), and I'm really impressed that you found all those hacks and basically learned Objective-C for this project.  Really great work, even with all the minor things we are talking about.\n\nI'm going to test this on PPC in the next few minutes.

Replying to [jhpalmieri](#comment%3A37):
> First, the app looks great.  I think that if you build the app by default, people will be a little surprised.  I would suggest not building it by default but strongly encourage people to try it out (on sage-devel, for example), with the goal of distributing it by default with Sage 5.0.


This seems like a good progression.

> How do I get the output from "sage --help" or "sage --advanced"?  If you remove menu items (like "crap"), then how do I execute "sage -crap"?  Could we have a menu item (like the current "Calculate" one) which just lets you type in any command line options you want?  Or it could be fancier and have a menu to choose a command-line option from the ones not already included.  Then you can eliminate "crap" but people can still use it if they want to.


I think I was saying that all these things are in the Terminal option still; you can run the terminal.   As it was I think I actually was for additional menu options before I was against them ;) but really I think that for the menu, it's not as crucial, since we didn't have that before.  I also think there was a way in Preferences to execute any old command you wanted, or?  Maybe not - that should be a high priority.  

(The Calculate was also based on a request of mine, but if we're shrinking the # of options, then that should go away too for now.)

> If I select "Also Show Menu Extra", I don't see any difference.  (It's also not completely clear what it's supposed to do; could it say `Also show "Extra" menu` instead?)


I think you have to restart for ALL the things in Preferences to work, not just the ones it says; at least, that's the only way I could get them to work.  I agree with Jason's comment about the Menu Extra, as I mentioned above.  However, now that I've tried it a bit, it seems that it functions in such a way that you can have Sage not running, but then almost immediately turn it on with just a mouse flick along the top, even with the various options - is that right?  

Related to that is that I did finally get the other binary to work, by dragging and selecting; the key is that you have to actually get the ./sage file, and that's probably not obvious to those who might think the folder is the 'binary', since ./sage isn't actually a compiled binary file... anyway.  I don't know whether this comment is important.  This also seems to require a restart.

> I unfortunately have my terminal program set to close the window when the shell exits, so using the "Calculate" option is not ideal: it closes the window as soon as it is done executing, so I can't see it.  My only options seem to be to change this for all of my Terminal windows, or to not exit after running Sage.  Is that right? 


You can set this in Preferences; in fact, Ivan's first default behavior was not to exit.

Related to this, hooray - there is only ONE window opening now!  Thanks for fixing that.  You were right that I had to delete the TerminalEmulatorList - weirdly, since I never created any new ones.

Random: when you click on an sws file it starts the browser, but doesn't *do* anything to suggest that it can't actually open them.  That seems problematic, and I don't remember that behavior in earlier versions.

I also finally looked at some of the code (some of which I even understood), and I'm really impressed that you found all those hacks and basically learned Objective-C for this project.  Really great work, even with all the minor things we are talking about.

I'm going to test this on PPC in the next few minutes.  But after that I'll probably bow out, because actual discussion is happening, and that should soon lead to a positively reviewed final version :)

I have 10.4 support (I think), as well as paring down the menus.  I also rearranged the Preferences window.  

Looking back over the comments, I believe that I addressed all concerns raised so far except the following (which I do not have plans to fix for this ticket--unless you change my mind):
* some problems jason had with the browser (can you reproduce those) 
* Making bdist build application by default 
* the "loading" page still appears when using the system browser (I think this is best--perhaps there should be an option)
* override emulator choice per command 
  * jhpalmieri, did you want a version that would exit only on success -- you could use "%`@` && exit"
  * Perhaps we should provide an exit and a not exit version (and exit on success)
* calculate dialog

Can you open the xib files?  If you double click them what happens?  The xibs have a deployment target of 10.4 and a development target of 3.0 which is the oldest I can choose.  Perhaps I have to recreate them for an older version?

For me the only issue is when using the "Calculate" menu option, and I don't even know if that's still there.  When using this option, if the Terminal automatically closes windows when their process is done, you don't see any output from the command, which makes it pretty pointless.  So it would be nice to be able to keep the window open after running "sage -c ..." until manually closed.

With the new version, I can't run it successfully on my Intel iMac running 10.6: I see

Now that I think of it, I think I had to choose to install the 10.4 SDK.  Clearly, not everyone who wants to build it will have it though, so I'll have to figure out a way to use 10.4 if they have it, but 10.5 (or 10.6) if they don't.  In the mean time you can open up the Project Settings and change the Base SDK (at the bottom of the General tab) to build it that way.

Same thing (sadly) happens on the home computer.  Looks like all `.m` files compiled (they have a check in the build column), and nearly everything with a checkbox in the target column is checked.  Several Frameworks aren't, and of course `Sage.app` and `Sage-info.plist` aren't.  Here's the full report - the build stopped while going through `Sage_Prefix.pch`, whatever that is.

Another issue - if you start it without a binary inside, and then click to choose a starting binary, it turns out that if you choose the folder and not the "executable" (which I think means the script `$SAGE_ROOT/sage`), you never get a warning message, except in the Console.  Here is some pertinent information:

```

9/13/10 4:28:17 PM	Sage[9812]	sageBinary:(null)
9/13/10 4:28:30 PM	Sage[9812]	Not showing in Dock
9/13/10 4:30:02 PM	Sage[9812]	starting sage
9/13/10 4:30:02 PM	Sage[9812]	Running command: /Users/.../sage
```
And when I try to get a terminal (in this case, the preference was already for only menu bar item - really confusing to me that it remembers prefs, but I think that's probably "correct" behavior):

```
Last login: Mon Sep 13 16:30:05 on ttys000
/Users/.../sage; exit
$ /Users/.../sage; exit
-bash: /Users/.../sage: is a directory
logout

[Process completed]
```
But there is no check that first time that the executable actually is one if you don't have the Sage server starting automatically.  I realize this would be unusual - someone that started with some prefs - but anyway it seems like it should be checked for.

I see that that is indeed 10.5+ only.  Unfortunately, I can't find how to get Xcode to warn me of such things.  I swear I had it doing that before...  Anyway, if you could try compiling again and send me any warnings that are produced when building.  I made sure to fix all the warnings on my machine.

No, thank you for your work here.

This might be more appropriate for a further ticket, but to what extent does the app depend on a Sage installation?  It seems like it shouldn't have to depend on it at all, because of the option to select another executable.  So it might be nice to a smaller app (the current one takes over 1 1/2 gigabytes on my machine) which is just the front end: it relies on having a separate Sage installation.  On my machine, I always create a link /Applications/sage/ pointing to SAGE_ROOT for my most recent Sage installation, so if I had a small app, I would just point it at /Applications/sage/sage, and I would never have to rebuild the app.

Or maybe there is an easy way to modify the current app to make it smaller so it does what I want: can I just delete the directory Contents/Resources/sage, as long as I use an external executable?  If something like this works, we might want to document it and separately distribute a smaller app, built this way, as a front end.

> Another issue - if you start it without a binary inside, and then click to choose a starting binary, it turns out that if you choose the folder and not the "executable" (which I think means the script `$SAGE_ROOT/sage`), you never get a warning message, except in the Console.  Here is some pertinent information:


I have changed it so that you can choose SAGE_ROOT (since I think that makes sense), but also that it will keep prompting you for a sage executable (which is $SAGE_ROOT/sage) until you choose one 

> And when I try to get a terminal (in this case, the preference was already for only menu bar item - really confusing to me that it remembers prefs, but I think that's probably "correct" behavior):


It's certainly standard.  It's just that you don't usually reinstall the same application so many times :-)

Replying to [jhpalmieri](#comment%3A69):
> This might be more appropriate for a further ticket, but to what extent does the app depend on a Sage installation?  It seems like it shouldn't have to depend on it at all, because of the option to select another executable.  So it might be nice to a smaller app (the current one takes over 1 1/2 gigabytes on my machine) which is just the front end: it relies on having a separate Sage installation.  On my machine, I always create a link /Applications/sage/ pointing to SAGE_ROOT for my most recent Sage installation, so if I had a small app, I would just point it at /Applications/sage/sage, and I would never have to rebuild the app.

You can just delete that directory, or instead just build from the xcode project instead of through `sage --bdist`.  Yes we probably ought to document this.  Perhaps we could have a `sage --app-bundle` command or something that would build it?  Or yet another option to `sage --bdist`.

I added a safeguard so that the MenuExtra always shows up on 10.4 since I can't figure out how to make it optionally be a regular application (in a clean way).  It's definitely not perfect, but at least you should never be left without a UI now (as could happen before).

I also added support for determining when the server is running in the case of using the system browser and added an option to not respect `SAGE_BROWSER` since that can be quite slow as it requires running `sage -c`.

I don't think so because I don't think it would ever get used.

From discussion on sage-devel, I think we're okay here since we're already using bash instead of sh.

Did you add something in one place but not another, related to checking whether Sage is running?  It didn't build the bundle on one of my 10.4 boxes this time.  This is based off of 4.6.alpha1.

If the application doesn't show up in the dock then the windows don't belong to any application (like the Preferences window now).  I think this would be extremely confusing and nearly impossible to work with.  It's okay for Preferences because it's a single window.

Can we just change the OS X README to have a section about Sage.app and a section for the case that it's not created since it will still be possible to create a binary distribution without Sage.app?

To edit the file sage-README-osx.txt, you should edit the one in local/bin (the one in the sage-scripts repo); this should automatically be copied to the top level directory of the relevant dmg.

(As kcrisman will also tell you, the one in SAGE_ROOT shouldn't even be there in the first place. See #6938, the resolution of which was to delete SAGE_ROOT/sage-README-osx.txt.)

A few comments on sage-README.osx.txt: 

- overall, I like the changes.

- when I create the app and open up the dmg, I see two "files": README.txt and "Sage-VERSION".  I don't see anything called "Sage-VERSION.app".  When I don't create the app, I see README.txt and a **folder** called "sage". So maybe we could change

```
One is as a
"regular" OS X application named something like Sage-VERSION.app.  If
you see such an application skip to the section about Sage.app.
```
 to

```
One is as a
"regular" OS X application named something like Sage-VERSION.  If
you see such an application, skip to the section about Sage.app.  
If you instead see a folder called "sage", proceed as follows.
```

- on line 56, "holding the option" should either be "holding option" or "holding the option key".  I have a slight preference for the second of these, in which case "holding command" should be changed correspondingly.

- I don't understand the instructions

```
Therefore please use something like

SAGE_BROWSER=${SAGE_BROWSER-YOUR_VALUE}
```
 Maybe add an explicit example?

- would it be worth adding a section on how to build the app if you don't have it?  This could be combined with, or referenced from, the section on Tiger and the comment on running "sage -bdist".

From within Sage, for example:

```
sage: hg_extcode.import_patch('trac_9873_extcode_sage_deluxe.patch')
sage: hg_scripts.import_patch('trac_9873_scripts_sage_deluxe.patch')
```
Then quit Sage and do

```
$ export SAGE_APP_BUNDLE=yes
$ sage -bdist 4.6.beta0
```
(I just made up "4.6.beta0"; I don't think it matters what version you type in.)

Then after a while, you'll end up with a folder called something like `SAGE_ROOT/dist/sage-4.6.beta0-i386-Darwin/Sage-4.6.alpha2.app`.  Move this to /Applications or to ~/Desktop or someplace, then double-click on it.

No, it doesn't apply cleanly.  So the release manager would have to do the following upon positive review:

* Remove `sage-README-osx.txt` from the scripts repository

* Apply the patches here to the extcode and scripts repositories.

* Close #5296 and this ticket

* Rejoice!

I'm ready to give this positive review once Ivan explains the `SAGE_BROWSER` comment above :)

Great!   It applies fine once I remove the old file, still builds fine, and it even knows that it can't open from within the disk image (just tried that, but read-only filesystem).

VERY nice work and I hope that it all goes well with merging - I'm cc:ing the release manager, since this should be quite orthogonal to anything else (unless someone messed with sage-bdist) in 4.6.

Whatever that means, since without the ~ those are obviously under revision control.

And running hg on that file gives me

I think you're mistaken.  It's included in the scripts spkg (I'm not sure how it gets there and I don't have time to look at it now), but it's not under revision control.  If you cd to the local/bin directory and type "hg manifest", that file is not listed.

This may still "need work": if we add file to the repo but then it also gets copied there manually, that's not good.

The tilde is a common means of indicating a backup file.  It should be something like `*~` though to ignore all backup files.  But that's another patch for another day :-)

I was very confused by this for a long time, but I finally tracked it down to 

```
$ hg log -r 1370
changeset:   1370:80bc1e909378
user:        Mike Hansen <mhansen@gmail.com>
date:        Thu Nov 12 20:55:24 2009 -0800
summary:     Remove the sage-README-osx.txt file from the scripts repo.
```

Personally I think it's a bug in mercurial to not show removal of a file in `hg log`.

Thanks to everyone for clearing my confusion!

The analogue of [merger-4.6.alpha2](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/release/sage-4.6.alpha2/merger-4.6.alpha2) for alpha1 did include a line to remove the root `sage-README-osx.txt`.  I don't know why it reappeared.  It's quite possible that I made a mistake.
