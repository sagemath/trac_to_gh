There are lots of things to be improved in the interrupt handling routines in c_lib/src/interrupt.c and c_lib/include/interrupt.h.

Major changes planned:
* **DONE**: make `sig_on()` have function syntax so that we can declare it `cdef int sig_on() except 0`.  See #10115 for the syntax changes.
* **DONE**: do not save signals in `sigsetjmp()` (by giving a second argument of 0 instead of 1).  This speeds up a sig_on/sig_off loop from 382 clock cycles to 30 clock cycles on a Core(TM)2 Duo CPU T5870 `@` 2.00GHz running Linux 2.6.34 glibc 2.11.2.
* **DONE**: using `sigaction()` instead of `signal()` since that has more well-defined semantics.
* **DONE**: handle SIGINT differently from other signals (other signals are urgent and cannot be ignored.  SIGINT on the other hand does not need to handled immediately, but we have to be careful for race conditions).
* **DONE**: allow `sig_on()` and `sig_off()` to be nested.
* **DONE**: implement `sig_retry()` for retrying failed computations (this is useful for PARI, see #10018).
* **DONE**: have an interface for more general errors which are not signals.  This can then be used by PARI, NTL and possibly other C libraries (various tickets).
* **DONE**: clean up old, unused code.
* **DONE**: testing interrupt handling: #10030.
* **DONE**: fix breakage because of this patch: #10061.
* **DONE**: documentation: #10109.
* **DONE**: Block interrupts during malloc: #10258.
* **DONE**: eliminate race condition when a SIGINT arrives before `sig_on()` or during `sig_on()`.

Other potentially related tickets:
* #800 (make _sig_on and _sig_off faster when stacked)
* #9640 (Change PARI error catching mechanism)
* #9564 (libsingular exponentiation can not be interrupted)
* #7879 (Remove unnecessary signal handling for low prec mpfr operations) --- hopefully `sig_on()` and `sig_off()` can be made very fast such that this shouldn't be an issue anymore.
* #7794 (`PolynomialRing_integral_domain` ignores Ctrl-C and segfaults)
* #5313 (patch singular so that when it runs out of memory the error message says "singular" in it)
* #7702 (Handle interrupts better in the notebook)
* #3423 (Make Pari error messages more informative)
* #10126 (Fix error handing in Matrix_rational_dense._invert_pari())
* #10818 (EclLib should allow signals to make LISP code interruptable)

Alternatively, I am considering making 4.6.2 a pretty straightforward release and then putting various "big" tickets such as this one, #9433, #10572 in the next release which would then be sage-4.7.

<a id='comment:39'></a>In any case, based on your trace, it looks like everything is working correctly.  I see the following:

```
--- SIGILL (Illegal instruction) @ 0 (0) ---
rt_sigprocmask(SIG_SETMASK, [], NULL, 8) = 0
write(2, "Traceback (most recent call last"..., 35) = 35
write(2, "  File \"/home/vbraun/Sage/sage/l"..., 74) = 74
```

So, the program receives `SIGILL` and prints a Traceback, which is exactly what should happen.

I cannot understand why at some point it did not work for you...

I consider this to be a bug in PPL.  Using `sigaction()` or `signal()`, it is possible to save an existing signal handler and then restore it afterwards.
