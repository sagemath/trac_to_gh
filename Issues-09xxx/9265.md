<a id='comment:17'></a>Hi Anne,

Thanks for this. I have just uploaded a new version of the patch which applies to the very top of 5.3 (the patch does not commute with #5457, but as it is applied first that doesn't matter).

In a previous version of the patch I (not Jason) had renamed some of the tableaux classes such as

* *Tableaux_n  --> *Tableaux_size
* *Tableaux_p  --> *Tableaux_shape

etc. but the current version does not do this. Personally I think that the name on the right make more sense but I probably shouldn't change this without consulting people first.

Andrew

The patchbot appears to be applying Jason's old patch before the new patch. I don't understand why this is happening but, as far as I can tell, this is why the patchbot is saying that the patch does not apply???

Dear Andrew,

Did you actually upload the new version of the patch to the sage-combinat queue? I could not see it there. Usually trailing white spaces should be removed. But please check that the whole queue still applies (by trying hg qpush -a) in case you will post the patch there. If it causes many conflicts, it might be better not to remove them at this point.

Thanks,

Anne

<a id='comment:20'></a>Dear Andrew,

Here are a couple of comments on the ticket:

* Please add an extra line after lines 1872 and 3799
* Delete line 3271
* In line 3273 in __getitem__ EXAMPLE: should be replaced by EXAMPLES:: (there is an S and : missing)
* In lines 3491, 3769, 4022, EXAMPLE:: should be replaced by EXAMPLES:: (there is an S missing)
* In line 4029, what is p? Perhaps ``self``?

I think it would be ok if you replaced 

* Tableaux_n --> Tableaux_size
* Tableaux_p --> Tableaux_shape 

This is indeed more descriptive!

<a id='comment:21'></a>Hi Anne,

Sorry for the slow response. As you no doubt worked out I didn't push the previous patch onto the queue. I was avoiding doing this as I thought that moving the patch up in the queue, and rebasing to 5.3, would cause conflicts further down the queue.

Any way, after making in the changes that you suggested above I decided to push the new version onto the queue. I have made all of the changes that you requested. In changing the names of the classes to Tableaux_size etc I went a little further and changed self.n to self.size etc and changed the named arguments to the parent classes, although the old named arguments are still accepted.

Also, when I was fixing up the documentation error in getitem that you found I remembered that I wanted to rewrite getitem so that it supports slices. It turned out that each of the semistandard tableaux parent classes had its own getitem, so I removed all of these and added a generic getitem to the SemistandardTableaux class which supports slices (the method came from my tableaux tuple classes). To make sure that this worked I put all of the doctests from the old getitems into the new generic getitem and then added a few more. To make the new getitem work I also had to add an is_finite method to these classes -- this probably should be implemented in the (In)FiniteEnumeratedSet category, but it is not and I couldn't see were to add this there....

The new patch is both on trac and on the queue.

I suppose this is due to your renaming of the classes. Also, I am not sure, but you might have to put in deprecation warnings if certain parent classes suddenly disappear. The new deprecation syntax is available here http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/13109.

When building the docs using 

```
sage -docbuild reference html

I got the following warning, which should most likely be fixed

```

<a id='comment:25'></a>Hi Anne,

I have discovered the register_unpickle_override function. Using this I have eliminated all but the following four unpickling errors:

* _class__sage_combinat_crystals_affine_AffineCrystalFromClassicalAndPromotion_with_category_element_class__.sobj
* _class__sage_combinat_crystals_tensor_product_CrystalOfTableaux_with_category_element_class__.sobj
* _class__sage_combinat_crystals_tensor_product_TensorProductOfCrystalsWithGenerators_with_category__.sobj
* _class__sage_combinat_tableau_Tableau_class__.sobj

These error are, I think, all due to the fact that the old Tableau_class has been replaced with the quite different Tableau class. My guess is that the only way to fix these unpicking errors is to update the pickle jar. Is this right? If so, then it probably is not worthwhile including all of the register_unpickle_override statements that I have just inserted. Let me know what you think.

I will upload a patch which fixes the docbuild problem that you mentioned, together with a few typos in the documentation and most of the unpickling problems, but I will hold off deprecation and the four problems above until I hear from you.

Best,

Andrew

For the record: removing all trailing white spaces is indeed likely to produce conflicts.
So I usually just make sure in my patch to not introduce new ones (sometimes, I edit the patch directly to remove those that I introduced accidently), and to remove those that are very close to the lines I change anyway.

Now in the case at hand, you currently kind of own the tableau file, since everybody knows that you are working hard on it, and that it is thus not safe playing with it. Then, the potential conflicts are with yourself, so you are free to take whichever course of action which is practical for you. 

Thanks for your work!

There is no control flow involved. It's quite a common public constructor, but speed matters because it's used a lot at a low level in combinatorics calculations. The error message is nice and explicit. Altogether, given the discussion on sage-devel, do we agree that it's ok as such?

Ouch, that piece? Yes certainly, it's bad and should be fixed, either by using a ValueError, or better by avoiding to feed Tableau with potential garbage.

Certainly, that's the planned next step in the cleanup of tableaux :-)
And then having checks that can be disabled will really become relevant.

Then I think the best solution is adding a "check" argument to the constructor defaulting to True and doing the expensive checks only when `check` is True.

<a id='comment:58'></a>I have just uploaded the patch* trac_9265--tableaux_categories_pickles-am.patch *which adds unpickle overrides for most of the old classes that are being deprecated. This fixes all but four of the unpickle problems, however, it does not fix unpickling for *Tableau_class.* I think that because *Tableau_class does not unpickle* the following four pickles still fail:

* `sage_combinat_crystals_affine_AffineCrystalFromClassicalAndPromotion_with_category_element_class`
* `sage_combinat_crystals_tensor_product_CrystalOfTableaux_with_category_element_class`
* `sage_combinat_crystals_tensor_product_TensorProductOfCrystalsWithGenerators_with_category`
* `sage_combinat_tableau_Tableau_class`

I have tried to fix the unpickling of Tableau_class using

  `register_unpickle_override('sage.combinat.tableau', 'Tableau_class',  Tableau)`

but this does not work. My guess is that it is not possible to unpickle the deprecated *Tableau_class* objects using the new *Tableau* class objects because the underlying classes are too different.

If some one can see how to do this please let me know.
