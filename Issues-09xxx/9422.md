As it is implemented at the moment, the method is_forest creates a new graph for each connected component of the graph, then calls the is_tree method for each of them, which checks again that the connected components are....connected !

We can do it a bit faster :-)

Creating a large forest : 

```
g = graphs.RandomGNP(300,.1)
g = g.subgraph(edges=g.min_spanning_tree())
g.delete_edges([e for e in g.edges() if random()<.5])
sage: g.sparse6_string()

```

Then using two different versions of is_forest 

```
sage: %timeit g.is_forest()
125 loops, best of 3: 5.06 ms per loop

sage: %timeit g.is_forest()
5 loops, best of 3: 43.8 ms per loop
```

Short and useful... All I love ! :-)
