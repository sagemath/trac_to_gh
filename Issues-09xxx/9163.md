<div id="comment:3" align="right">comment:3</div>

Does this happen because the interface might be slow to start up?

Should we move the lines

```python
        if self._expect is None:
            self._start()
```
in `sage.interfaces.expect.Expect._expect_expr` to inside its outermost `try` block?
