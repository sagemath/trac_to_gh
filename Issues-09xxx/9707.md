We should have an option to g.laplacian() to return the signless Laplacian, which is attracting attention these days, and which is calculated by `D+A` instead of `D-A` (see p. 12 of http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/ft.aspx?id=0350-13020795011C, for example).

Thanks to Steve Butler for the feature request.

Signless laplacian is indeed gaining popularity as evident in the papers below.
So can I add the option to the current Laplacian Matrix method to return signless laplacian matrix?
