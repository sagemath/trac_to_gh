The convex optimization Python module cvxopt and the linear programming library GLPK are both standard packages in Sage 4.5.  The module cvxopt includes a python interface to GLPK, but currently cvxopt is unaware of the presence of GLPK and does not compile or include that submodule: 

```
sage: from cvxopt import glpk

<div id="comment:3" align="right">comment:3</div>

To allow cvxopt to find and use glpk there are two things that need to be done to the cvxopt spkg.

1. Modify the two setup.py files in cvxopt-0.9.p8/patches to turn on support for GLPK.  

2. Modify "spkg/standard/deps" so that GLPK has to compile before cvxopt.   See Dave Kirkby's explanation of [this](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/msg/866bb0112d4066eb?).  In particular, the cvxopt entry should look like this:

```
$(INST)/$(CVXOPT): $(BASE) $(INST)/$(FORTRAN) $(INST)/$(F2C) \ 
                    $(INST)/$(LAPACK) $(INST)/$(BLAS) $(INST)/$(NUMPY) \ 
                    $(INST)/$(ATLAS) $(INST)/$(CEPHES) $(INST)/$(GLPK) 
```

I have attached a mercurial patch for (1); as I couldn't figure out how the "deps" file is under version control, the above will have to do for (2).

just because you got `[4.1121212232455654, 4334.34]` on your computer. 

I would ask what platforms this has been tested on, as Sage does support Linux, OS X and Solaris, but it's not clear to me how this can be tested at all just now.

I just need to verify if I have the correct original to base this on. I will attach it as soon as possible. But clearly this needs work in order that we can verify that the cvxopt is able to use glpk properly on all supported platforms.

You can specify the which solver cvxopt uses via the "solvers" optional argument.   E.g. with the last example in [the current doctest](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/numerical_sage/cvxopt.html) one could follow this example with 

```
sage: sol2 = solvers.lp(c,G,h,solver='glpk')
GLPK Simplex Optimizer, v4.44
4 rows, 2 columns, 6 non-zeros
Preprocessing...
2 rows, 2 columns, 4 non-zeros
Scaling...
 A: min|aij| =  1.000e+00  max|aij| =  2.000e+00  ratio =  2.000e+00
Problem data seem to be well scaled
Constructing initial basis...
Size of triangular part = 2
*     0: obj =   0.000000000e+00  infeas =  0.000e+00 (0)
*     2: obj =  -9.000000000e+00  infeas =  0.000e+00 (0)
OPTIMAL SOLUTION FOUND
}}
Near as I can tell, all that stuff is being printed by glpk directly; I'm not sure if it's platform sensitive or not.  

There is a more direct interface to glpk as well which one could test instead --- the function names differ between cvxopt 0.9 and cvxopt 1.1, though.

I just incorporates this patch to my new cvxopt-1.1.2. (we really, really should move to 1.1.2 before doing anything to cvxopt!!!) please see

How can it be ready for review if you are not sure if it's platform sensitive or not?

Since it's only been tested on OS X, I would suggest this is not ready for review. It has to be shown to work on 
* Linux
* Solaris
* OS X. 

If someone has specific questions about building on Solaris, I will answer them if I can. But what I can't do is test everyones patches on Solaris. They will need to do that themselves. 

The page

http://www.sagemath.org/doc/numerical_sage/cvxopt.html 

has no reference to GLPK, or the use of other solvers. 

IMHO, it would be better to look at update cvxopt while you take the time to test this on multiple platforms and add some examples of how it is used. At the moment, it seems rather rushed to me.

Dave,

You're responding to my comment, but it was Dima who changed the status after he tested this patch in conjunction with #6456 (the upgrade to cvxopt 1.1.2).  Looking at Dima's current version of cvxopt 1.1.2, he simply changed the needed two lines in "setup.py" directly rather than apply the patch included here. 

The combination of #9598 and #6456 has so far been tested on OS X (me), Linux 32 (Dima), and also by shilly (OS not mentioned); see the comments in the #6456 thread.   I don't think it's been tested on Solaris, but I don't have access to any such machines and can't help with that.

I've looked at this and can't see any documentation or doctests to accompany the change to cvxopt that will allow it to use glpk. As far as I can see, this just allows cvxopt to link to the glpk library - no proof that is working properly. There's nothing to tell a user of cvxopt that they can use the glpk solver. Whilst I appreciate you and the author know that this is so, the documentation does not reflect this. Once the documentation reflects this, it can be doctested and one determine if there are any problems with the cvxopt/glpk interaction after each release of Sage. It's not clear to me how that can be done with this patch. If I'm mistaken, please correct me. 

You do have access to a Solaris machine. In fact, you have a created a directory in /scratch on 't2'. 

```
kirkby@t2:[/scratch] $ ls /scratch
dima      dreyer    gray      juanjo2   mpatel    ncohen    rishi     sergey    wstein
drake     ghitza    jason     mhansen   mvngu     palmieri  scons     sking
```

So you **can** check it. If you need help, I will try to help you if you can tell me what you done, and what problems or error messages you got.

Dave,

You're confusing me (Nathan Dunfield) with Nathann Cohen, whose scratch directory you're referring to.  You can tell us apart because Nathann has three 'n's in his first name ;-).  

As for a doctest, I think what schilly used in comment 42 of #6456 would work fine.  I've attached a patch for the documentation and also the file itself --- I'm not sure if DIma et al have also modified the docs.

Do you have an account on sage.math? If so, you can have an account on the Solaris system t2.math and test there - let me know your username on sage.math. I can point you at some instructions on how to test on t2. Testing on the Solaris system sometimes gives slightly different results from other systems, as the floating point processors are not identical.
