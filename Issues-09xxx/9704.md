This is confusing.  Refactor to fix it:

```
sage: det(matrix(2,[1,2,3,4]))
-2
sage: trace(matrix(2,[1,2,3,4]))
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
AttributeError: 'sage.matrix.matrix_integer_dense.Matrix_integer_dense' object has no attribute 'lstrip'
```

When I read the code, trace() has one purpose, not two.  Your patch will mean that the trace function has two completely different purposes, depending on the input.  That is what I'm -1 on.

If we change the trace() function so that it instead computes the trace of an object (i.e., x.trace()), then I agree that for a short amount of time, a deprecation warning should be added and trace() will have to serve two purposes.

I'm -1 on a ticket (this one) which makes the Sage trace() function have two purposes (unless it's a temporary thing that is deprecated, of course).

Sage already has `_lots_` of functions f() which do very different things depending on the type of the arguments.

How about making the trace(x) function do what others do, which is to try returning x.trace() and if that fails do what the code_trace function does?

Is there any other examples in Sage where a function does:

* mathematically meaningful stuff (which may differ, depending on the mathematical object), and returns a mathematical answer
* and also does something which is entirely non-mathematical, on a completely different level (a programming nuts-and-bolts debugging level, rather than a math level)?

The big conceptual difference between those two purposes is why I think having two functions, say `trace()` (which calls `x.trace()`) and `trace_execution()` (which does what trace does right now) is a much better design than lumping things into one function.

<a id='comment:33'>Comment 33:</a>
It seems that there is no enough consensus in changing the meaning of `trace` command, which is now commonly used to trace code execution in Sage.

At least I myself prefer to use the methods `m.det()` and `m.trace()` than the functions `det(m)` or `trace(m)`. So I would rather remove the function `det` instead of introducing new `trace` function.

Hence I close this ticket as "won't fix".
