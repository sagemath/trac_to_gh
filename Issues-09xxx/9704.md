This is confusing.  Refactor to fix it:

```
sage: det(matrix(2,[1,2,3,4]))
-2
sage: trace(matrix(2,[1,2,3,4]))
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
AttributeError: 'sage.matrix.matrix_integer_dense.Matrix_integer_dense' object has no attribute 'lstrip'

When I read the code, trace() has one purpose, not two.  Your patch will mean that the trace function has two completely different purposes, depending on the input.  That is what I'm -1 on.

If we change the trace() function so that it instead computes the trace of an object (i.e., x.trace()), then I agree that for a short amount of time, a deprecation warning should be added and trace() will have to serve two purposes.

I'm -1 on a ticket (this one) which makes the Sage trace() function have two purposes (unless it's a temporary thing that is deprecated, of course).

Is there any other examples in Sage where a function does:

* mathematically meaningful stuff (which may differ, depending on the mathematical object), and returns a mathematical answer
* and also does something which is entirely non-mathematical, on a completely different level (a programming nuts-and-bolts debugging level, rather than a math level)?

The big conceptual difference between those two purposes is why I think having two functions, say `trace()` (which calls `x.trace()`) and `trace_execution()` (which does what trace does right now) is a much better design than lumping things into one function.

No, it doesn't at the top level, and not in the same function.

<a id='comment:33'></a>It seems that there is no enough consensus in changing the meaning of `trace` command, which is now commonly used to trace code execution in Sage.

At least I myself prefer to use the methods `m.det()` and `m.trace()` than the functions `det(m)` or `trace(m)`. So I would rather remove the function `det` instead of introducing new `trace` function.

Hence I close this ticket as "won't fix".
