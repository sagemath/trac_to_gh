```
sage: V = span([[1/7,0,0] ,[0,1,0]], ZZ); V
Free module of degree 3 and rank 2 over Integer Ring
Echelon basis matrix:
[1/7   0   0]
[  0   1   0]
sage: T = matrix(ZZ,3,[1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]); T
[1 0 0]
[0 0 0]
[0 0 0]
sage: W = T.kernel_on(V); W.basis()
[
(0, 1, 0)
]
sage: W.is_submodule(V)
False
```
This is surprising, isn't it? (Patch comes up in a minute, but I need to create the ticket first.)
