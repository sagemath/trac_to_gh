There are also post-merge comments at #9665, I don't know if they should be included here or if there's even a new ticket for these.

Jeroen, could you describe in more detail which failure(s) this ticket is intended to fix (including Sage version, operating system, processor etc.)?

John Cremona has successfully installed and tested #9343 (unintentionally) **without** this new spkg, and I've also successfully installed the other to spkgs and applied the patches from #9343 on top of Sage 4.5.3.alpha0 + #9475 and #9717 on Fedora 13 x86 (Pentium 4 Prescott, gcc 4.4.4).

Of course lcalc wasn't (re)built in the above tests. (I'll try that later, currently running `ptestlong` without the lcalc package from here.)

I've changed the title and description a bit, to reflect the fact that #9343 is **not** Pari 2.4.3. 

Not even Pari 2.4.2 has ever been released - there is only an alpha of that available.

I don't know where it is. In any case, it should not be a .p2, since the current one in Sage is lcalc-20100428-1.23.p0.spkg, to a revision should be called lcalc-20100428-1.23.p1.spkg. 

I hope the 

`gcc -Wa,-W` 

(to suppress warnings from the assembler), has not got back in, as -W is not recognised by the Sun assembler and it creates an error.

Perhaps do some of the clean-up I [suggested above](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/9592#comment:8)?

There are further minor things (like the date/version at the top of `spkg-install`; `SAGE_DEBUG=yes` usually disables optimization, unquoted environment variables, etc.).

I wonder if we should add (a) further patch(es) to get rid of some of the annoying warnings (cf. https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/9343#comment:191 ff.), but we probably shouldn't do too much at this ticket.

I'm not sure if Cygwin support is required yet... ;-)

Doesn't bother **me**, but should we keep

```sh
# disable Cygwin build for now
if [ "$UNAME" = "CYGWIN" ]; then
#    cp ../../patches/Lcommandline_elliptic.cc .
    echo "Sorry, the lcalc build is currently broken"
    echo 1
fi
```
**?** (In case I by luck have looked at the current `.p2` / its current patches/diffs.)

Fortunately there's a follow-up ticket to address the rest...
