Jeroen, could you describe in more detail which failure(s) this ticket is intended to fix (including Sage version, operating system, processor etc.)?

John Cremona has successfully installed and tested #9343 (unintentionally) **without** this new spkg, and I've also successfully installed the other to spkgs and applied the patches from #9343 on top of Sage 4.5.3.alpha0 + #9475 and #9717 on Fedora 13 x86 (Pentium 4 Prescott, gcc 4.4.4).

Of course lcalc wasn't (re)built in the above tests. (I'll try that later, currently running `ptestlong` without the lcalc package from here.)

I've changed the title and description a bit, to reflect the fact that #9343 is **not** Pari 2.4.3. 

Not even Pari 2.4.2 has ever been released - there is only an alpha of that available.

I don't know where it is. In any case, it should not be a .p2, since the current one in Sage is lcalc-20100428-1.23.p0.spkg, to a revision should be called lcalc-20100428-1.23.p1.spkg. 

I hope the 

`gcc -Wa,-W` 

(to suppress warnings from the assembler), has not got back in, as -W is not recognised by the Sun assembler and it creates an error.

Perhaps do some of the clean-up I [suggested above](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/9592#comment:8)?

There are further minor things (like the date/version at the top of `spkg-install`; `SAGE_DEBUG=yes` usually disables optimization, unquoted environment variables, etc.).

I wonder if we should add (a) further patch(es) to get rid of some of the annoying warnings (cf. http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/9343#comment:191 ff.), but we probably shouldn't do too much at this ticket.

I'm not sure if Cygwin support is required yet... ;-)

Could you upload an spkg patch for your changes (except file deletions) here?

It's a bit more convenient for reviewing and adding further changes...

Rishi, do Jeroen's changes look good to you?  If they are, I suggest that we leave further changes for other tickets.

Yes; hopefully #9845 gets reviewed soon s.t. this ticket won't get merged at all (positively reviewed though), since the former contains all changes from here.

Doesn't bother **me**, but should we keep

```sh
# disable Cygwin build for now
if [ "$UNAME" = "CYGWIN" ]; then
#    cp ../../patches/Lcommandline_elliptic.cc .
    echo "Sorry, the lcalc build is currently broken"
    echo 1
fi
```
**?** (In case I by luck have looked at the current `.p2` / its current patches/diffs.)

Fortunately there's a follow-up ticket to address the rest...
