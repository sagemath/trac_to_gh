***   This ticket depends on #9499    ***

Make this work:

```

            sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]
            sage: I = R.ideal([x^2 + 1, y^3 - 2])
            sage: S.<i,cuberoot> = R.quotient(I)
            sage: 1/(1+i)
            -1/2*i + 1/2

        Confirm via symbolic computation::
        
            sage: 1/(1+sqrt(-1))
            -1/2*I + 1/2

        Another more complicated quotient::
        
            sage: b = 1/(i+cuberoot); b
            1/5*i*cuberoot^2 - 2/5*i*cuberoot + 2/5*cuberoot^2 - 1/5*i + 1/5*cuberoot - 2/5
            sage: b*(i+cuberoot)
            1
```
