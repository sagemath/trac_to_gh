I still am getting the known behavior below when exiting Sage.

```
Exiting Sage (CPU time 0m0.74s, Wall time 11m11.95s). 
Exiting spawned GP/PARI interpreter process. 
```
It's not exactly a bug, but it's also annoying and potentially 
confusing.  We should stop it.

Apply **9959_combined.patch** below and install the **new spkg**: [http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/pari-2.4.3.svn-12577.p9.spkg](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/pari-2.4.3.svn-12577.p9.spkg) (note that this spkg is *not* based on the earlier p8)

So how do we manage this?

Rewrite the class `sage.interfaces.gp.Gp` to lazily start the interpreter, or initialize `sage.interfaces.gp.gp` to `None` and explicitly do `gp = Gp()` everywhere it is used unless `gp != None`?

I believe this in `Gp.__init__` is the culprit:

```
# gp starts up with this set to 1, which makes pexpect hang: 
self.set_default('breakloop',0)
```

If this is the case, an easy solution is to add a patch to the pari spkg to set breakloop to 0 by default.

Wow, *a lot* of places where "GP/PARI" had to be changed... (well done)

We have two similar instances in the scripts repo:

```
local/bin/sage-sage:    echo "  -gp <..>      -- run Sage's GP (Pari) with given arguments"
local/bin/sage-sage.py:                     help="run Sage's GP (Pari), passing it all remaining arguments")
```
But I think we don't need to change these on this ticket.

Patches look fine, will test them later (with the new spkg of course).

If you are right (and I assumed that you did test this!) then I am wondering what else has changed, since when we started the pari upgrade it was definitely necessary to deal with this.

And by the way, the *only* reason I created a `_start` function for Gp different from the default one in PExpect was to add this line in `_start`;  so if that line is not needed, you can probably delete the while `_start` function for class Gp.

As far as I can see, we don't need it there, since `gp` will of course (re)start with the hard-coded defaults whenever `_start()` is called.

(This is different to setting it "manually" from the Expect interface each time `gp` is [re]started.) 

So we can IMHO drop `Gp._start()` completely, as John noted.

If one would add an option to `gp`, add an option for non-interactive (script) use which would also disable `breakloop` by default.  I remember I proposed this (a long time ago) to the PARI/GP developers without much success.

I suppose that from their point of view it makes no sense to use gp non-interactively, since gp is the interactive interface to the pari library!

I was just going to suggest that, too.

Note that we should have two of them, one for the interactive `gp` provided by Sage, and one for the `pexpect` interface.

Perhaps they meanwhile chnaged their minds.. ;-)

There's some stuff in it for using `gp` from Emacs or TeXmacs, but only as a *compile time* option IIRC. Also some kind of "non-interactive" `gp` use.

Does `gp` expand `$SAGE_ROOT` in the `gprc.expect` file, or does Sage do that before it starts `gp`?

`gp` does that.

The sagelib patch looks good to me.

For review, please could you give instructions for the simple-minded as to how to apply the patch which converts .p7 to .p9?  And then how to rebuild?  Thanks.

Of course, someone else who knows how to do this reliably is welcome to get in first with a review.

Well, the easiest is to install the new spkg:

```
sage -i http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/pari-2.4.3.svn-12577.p9.spkg
```

> And then how to rebuild?

I personally do not know the most reliable way to rebuild a complete Sage installation.  One thing which works for sure is the following:
* download sage-4.6.alpha3.tar and extract it so we have a clean, uncompiled sage-4.6.alpha3.
* rm spkg/standard/pari-*.spkg
* download [ttp://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/pari-2.4.3.svn-12577.p9.spkg] and and put it in spkg/standard
* now `make` Sage as usual

I made a freshly unpacked 4.6.alpha3, and replaced its pari spkg with the p9 version;  then built all Sage;  then applied the sagelib patch on this ticket;  then tested the whole library.

All passed, so here's a positive review.
