The spkg-install has the usual dumb code for building 64-bit on OS X. 

```
if [ `uname` = "Darwin" -a "$SAGE64" = "yes" ]; then
   echo "64 bit MacIntel"
   CFLAGS="-O2 -g -fPIC -m64 "; export CFLAGS
   LDFLAGS="-m64"; export LDFLAGS
fi
```

This should be easy to fix, by removing the OS X requirement.

I'm not happy with this - are reverting to needs work. It appears to be linking to a 32-bit library.
