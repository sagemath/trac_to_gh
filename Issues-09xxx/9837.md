Due to a bug in MPIR 2.1.1, combining #9343 (new PARI) and #8664 (MPIR 2.1.1) gives Segmentation Faults.  This problem is not limited to Sage.

:D Thanks, I didn't want to track this down further...

Funny, because *GMP* (5.0.1) dropped other things not part of the *public* interface, which are still available in the newest MPIR.

Yes. I intended to simply change the `#if 1` to `#ifdef PARI_USE_GMP_INTERNALS` in `mp.c`, which we already patch. (I've in fact already prepared and tested a `.svn-12577.p4.5` spkg with exactly that change; all long tests passed.)

> Note that these are actually **documented** GMP internals, so it's not as bad as it sounds.

I haven't checked this. To me, it is rather irrelevant if they are *documented* or not, but rather whether they are part of the official / **public** interface to GMP. If those features PARI uses aren't, we should IMHO disable their use *by default*. So correct me if my assumption is false; I'll perhaps later take a closer look at what PARI considers "undocumented" (but not at the moment...). The odd thing is that the `#else` branch currently contains `TODO`s (though it seems functional at least for the purpose of Sage).

> So I would prefer not to touch that code and leave PARI using documented GMP/MPIR internals as it is.

Since we already patch `mp.c`, I think it doesn't hurt to add the above change to it.

We can then easily enable or disable the use in `spkg-install` and/or by setting environment variables, which may be valuable for testing, without changing the spkg at all.

The remaining question would be whether to *enable* or *disable* it by default. With *MPIR* the Sage standard package, I preferred the latter. 

> Also, on the who-is-doing-what part: I am not doing anything with this for the moment (I do plan to release a prealpha4 when leif's done with p5).

I don't know if *"with this"* referred to the PARI *spkg*, the ticket (#9343), or PARI in general... ;-)

I'll again ask at #9343 if anyone plans to add doctests or at least missing docstrings (to the Sage library part of PARI / #9343). I am not..., only perhaps going to fix the Sphinx warnings.

This is how the MPIR documentation phrases the internals used by PARI:
> **This chapter is provided only for informational purposes and the various internals described**
> **here may change in future MPIR releases. Applications expecting to be compatible with future**
> **releases should use only the documented interfaces described in previous chapters.**

Well, it depends because in this case, using the internals means a potentially significant speed gain.

The only thing I'll do is release a new prealpha when PARI p5 is out and to fix the few remaining issues in #9400.

How did it get reported originally, because I only received the report yesterday, and since then there are five or six replies on the MPIR devel list.\n\nAnyhow, just to update, it looks like we found the bug in MPIR. Just have to patch it now.\n\nWith regard to the \"undocumented interface\", if Pari currently builds against MPIR without missing symbol errors, then it is likely that it is relying on now documented symbols in both GMP and MPIR. The disclaimer is out-of-date. It has been removed in the GMP manual, but we have forgotten to remove it in the MPIR manual.

This got filed as "reported upstream, little or no feedback". How did it get reported originally, because I only received the report yesterday, and since then there are five or six replies on the MPIR devel list.

Anyhow, just to update, it looks like we found the bug in MPIR. Just have to patch it now.

With regard to the "undocumented interface", if Pari currently builds against MPIR without missing symbol errors, then it is likely that it is relying on now documented symbols in both GMP and MPIR. The disclaimer is out-of-date. It has been removed in the GMP manual, but we have forgotten to remove it in the MPIR manual. I will make a note on the MPIR devel list to do so.

If there are missing symbol errors, then I guess it relied on undocumented functions in *GMP* but not in MPIR. That would be a different (but surprising) situation.

What does "needs review" mean? Confirming that PARI uses **documented** GMP features? Or that it's an *MPIR* bug?

I'd say we (i.e. the release manager) can close this ticket as "fixed". #8664 should not be merged until there's MPIR 2.1.2 or alike with this bug fixed; I think we agreed on that.
