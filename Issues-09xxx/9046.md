This seems a bug (note the instances of `-x^2` and `x^2`):

```
var('a b x y z')
sage: p = -a*x^3 - a*x*y^2 + 2*b*x^2*y + 2*y^3 + x^2*z + y^2*z + x^2 + y^2 + a*x
sage: p.collect(x)
-a*x^3 + (2*b*y + z + 1)*x^2 - x^2 - (a*y^2 - a)*x + x^2 + 2*y^3 + y^2*z + y^2
```

Depends on #9880

Here is the same session using GiNaC directly via `ginsh`:

```
> t= -a*x^3 - a*x*y^2 + 2*b*x^2*y + 2*y^3 + x^2*z + y^2*z + x^2 + y^2 + a*x;
x^2+2*y*b*x^2+y^2+y^2*z+a*x+2*y^3-a*x^3-y^2*a*x+z*x^2
> t;
x^2+2*y*b*x^2+y^2+y^2*z+a*x+2*y^3-a*x^3-y^2*a*x+z*x^2
> collect(t, x);
(1+2*y*b+z)*x^2+y^2+y^2*z+2*y^3-a*x^3-(y^2*a-a)*x
> u = (x^2+(y-x^2)*(y+x));
x^2-(y+x)*(x^2-y)
> collect(u, x);
x^3-(x^2-y)*x+y^2-(-1+y+x)*x^2
```

It seems that one needs to call `expand()` explicitly before calling `collect()`. I think this should just be documented in the docstring.

The problem with `-x^2 + x^2` appearing in the output is probably a bug I introduced while playing with the ordering of the terms. I will take a look at it when I find a chance. It's likely to be later than a week though.

It turns out that #11839 was opened and did the first part of this ticket, including documenting the `expand()` issue.

However, the bug remains, so I'll just change this ticket to be about it.

Burcin,

first the ticket number is wrong (13107 instead of 9046) then the input p was mangled
(ends with `a>` instead of `a*x`).
