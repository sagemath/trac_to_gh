No, we should update the developers guide. Despite this sentence, the (c)
return type of "hash" has been a long since Python 2.3 at least, so I think
this wasn't ever correct for 64-bit long machines. (What was required is
that it fit into a Python int.)

Yes, we should be using C longs here. Under the hood

Python int = C long != C int
Python float = C double  != C float

and Python longs have no (native) C equivalent.
