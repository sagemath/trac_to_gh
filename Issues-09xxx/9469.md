Currently one can do:

```
    sage: F = FreeModule(QQ,3)
    sage: F in VectorSpaces(QQ)

```

This patch implements:

```
    sage: F in VectorSpaces
    True
```

(and does a couple closeby minor improvements to the doc)

I just stumbled upon the following hunk later in the queue, and thought we might as well
fold it into this patch:
