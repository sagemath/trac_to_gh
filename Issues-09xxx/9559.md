The basic idea is that one has objects which satisfy the criteria set out in `sage/groups/perm_gps/partn_ref`. In particular, one has implemented a refinement function, a comparison function, and an equivalent-children function. Then one defines the following four functions, and the code which will appear here will do the rest.

1. Given an input object `X`, this function will return a number `k`. This is the number of augmentations from `X` to perform, thought of abstractly as the list `[0, 1, ..., k-1]`. The user will keep the data of what augmentations these actually are.

2. Given a permutation of `X` (acting on `[0, 1, ..., n-1]`), and a number `a` in `[0, 1, ..., k-1]`, outputs a number `b` in the same range, such that the augmentation represented by `a` maps to the one represented by `b` under the permutation.

3. Given a number in `[0, 1, ..., k-1]`, outputs an object `C` which realizes the augmentation.

4. Given a permutation `g`, and an object `C`, applies `g` to `C`, constructs an arbitrary parent object `P` of `C`, and returns `g^(-1)(P)`.

Function (2) will be optional. If not provided, then the list of augmentations given in (1) will have to be a set of orbit representatives.
