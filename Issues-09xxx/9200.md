Do we really need new keywords for this? And if we do, should it be `from_{right,left}`?

I think a user interface decision like this needs more input from other developers. I'll post to sage-devel with this question.

While we were discussing calculus during one of our workshop sessions, one of the participants remarked that most students learn one-sided limits as "from the left" and "from the right."

I have been using Sage for almost a year, so I would consider myself a newbie.  I'm not personally attached to this patch and if others feel that it is unnecessary bloat, then my feelings won't be hurt.

This was discussed in the thread:

http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/t/9dd6dfe26f09be93

The resulting decision was to deprecate 'above' and 'below' and add support for '+', '-', 'right', and 'left'.

I noticed while reviewing this that there are two "TEST" headers in the docstring for limit().  So I removed the second one and uploaded a new version of the "documentation" patch - only change is the removal of the header (still has Burcin's name on it too).

I'm running tests overnight and then plan to give this a positive review.  

Burcin - I'll wait for you to check-off on the one change to your patch.

Rob

Congrats to Dana Ernst on his first contribution.  Next one will probably engender less discussion.  ;-)
