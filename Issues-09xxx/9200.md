I think a user interface decision like this needs more input from other developers. I'll post to sage-devel with this question.

The idea for this came up during one of the online sessions for the MAA PREP Workshop for Sage (organized by Rob Beezer, Jason Grout, and Karl-Dieter Crisman) that I am currently enrolled in.  While we were discussing calculus during one of our workshop sessions, one of the participants remarked that most students learn one-sided limits as "from the left" and "from the right."  Rob, Jason, and Karl-Dieter knew that I was interested in getting involved in Sage development and remarked that I could add that this terminology to Sage if I was interested.  I figured that it was an easy way to get my feet wet.

I have been using Sage for almost a year, so I would consider myself a newbie.  I'm not personally attached to this patch and if others feel that it is unnecessary bloat, then my feelings won't be hurt.

This was discussed in the thread:

The resulting decision was to deprecate 'above' and 'below' and add support for '+', '-', 'right', and 'left'.

attachment:trac_9200-deprecation.patch makes the necessary changes, on top of Dana's patch.

Burcin,

Thanks for picking up the ball on this.  I was planning on attacking this in a few weeks after the initial craziness of my semester settled down.  Now, I get to cross something off my todo list:)

I noticed while reviewing this that there are two "TEST" headers in the docstring for limit().  So I removed the second one and uploaded a new version of the "documentation" patch - only change is the removal of the header (still has Burcin's name on it too).

I'm running tests overnight and then plan to give this a positive review.  

Burcin - I'll wait for you to check-off on the one change to your patch.
