I have been using Sage for almost a year, so I would consider myself a newbie.  I'm not personally attached to this patch and if others feel that it is unnecessary bloat, then my feelings won't be hurt.

<a id='comment:7'>**Comment 7:**</a>
This was discussed in the thread:

http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/t/9dd6dfe26f09be93

The resulting decision was to deprecate 'above' and 'below' and add support for '+', '-', 'right', and 'left'.

[attachment:trac_9200-deprecation.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9200/trac_9200-deprecation.patch) makes the necessary changes, on top of Dana's patch.

Thanks for picking up the ball on this.  I was planning on attacking this in a few weeks after the initial craziness of my semester settled down.  Now, I get to cross something off my todo list:)

I noticed while reviewing this that there are two "TEST" headers in the docstring for limit().  So I removed the second one and uploaded a new version of the "documentation" patch - only change is the removal of the header (still has Burcin's name on it too).

I'm running tests overnight and then plan to give this a positive review.  

Burcin - I'll wait for you to check-off on the one change to your patch.
