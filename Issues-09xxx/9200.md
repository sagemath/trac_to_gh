I noticed while reviewing this that there are two "TEST" headers in the docstring for limit().  So I removed the second one and uploaded a new version of the "documentation" patch - only change is the removal of the header (still has Burcin's name on it too).

I'm running tests overnight and then plan to give this a positive review.  

Burcin - I'll wait for you to check-off on the one change to your patch.

Congrats to Dana Ernst on his first contribution.  Next one will probably engender less discussion.  ;-)
