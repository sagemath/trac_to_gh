Currently, is_prime_power only works on integers.  The attached simple patch will allow rational numbers as input as illustrated below.

```
sage: is_prime_power(1/2197)
True
sage: is_prime_power(1/100)
False
sage: is_prime_power(2/5)
False
```

This is also the behavior of Mathematica's PrimePowerQ function.

I downloaded the most recent available sage (4.5) and made a new patch.  Does this solve the issue?  If not, what can I do?

Sorry you're having such a difficult time with your first patch -- but you have to expect the occasional patch conflict when you work in the fast-changing field of testing for prime powers :)

<a id='comment:8'></a>Code looks reasonable, doctests pass.  Positive review.

Armin, thanks for sticking with this!  To answer your questions:

(1) Opinions differ :) Sometimes it's nice to preserve the history of the patch, but it's also nice to make it easier for reviewers and the release manager by not having a whole sea of patches that they have to wade through to figure out which to apply.  In your case -- a simple rebase, where nobody will probably ever care about previous versions of the patch -- I'd say yes, replacing the old one is fine.

(2) Yes, if you think you've addressed the work issue you should remove it.

Release manager: apply only the second patch.
