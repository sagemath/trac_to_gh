The current version of GnuTLS in Sage has multiple issues, not all of which will probably be solved by this ticket, but at least of subset of them will be. 
* The current version in Sage is very old. 
* There are security issues with the current version - see #7542
* There's no `spkg-check` file - see #9308
* It fails to build on AIX - see #9974
* It fails to build on HP-UX - see  #7511
* `make` is used instead of `$MAKE`
* `-m64` is hard-coded as the compiler flag needed for 64-bit builds
* `SPKG.txt` lacks the `Special Update/Build Instructions` section.
* There's an incomplete list of dependencies in `SKG.txt`, with a remark to `FIXME`

An upgrade and attempt to clean up this package is [http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/mariah/spkg/gnutls-2.12.3.spkg](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/mariah/spkg/gnutls-2.12.3.spkg)

One more thing: `$RM` is no longer set by sage-env, so do you need to modify it in spkg-install?  If you do, should you test whether `$RM_SAVE` is nonempty before

```
RM=$RM_SAVE
export RM
```
Do you even need to export `RM` at the end, or are the changes in this script (in particular `unset RM`) just local to the script?

Ahem, restoring `RM` is useless since `spkg-install` never gets sourced. (`unset RM` is sufficient and ok.)

Some things are still in, some are new:
* `$SAGE_LOCAL` should be quoted in the first tests (both scripts).
* `-m64` is still hard-coded.
* `CFLAGS` and `CXXFLAGS` get overwritten when `SAGE64=yes`.
* `sage-check` uses `make` instead of `$MAKE`.
* If we have to `--disable-cxx` on MacOS X, why disable it on all platforms?
* Error messages should start with `"Error ..."`, and perhaps be written to `stderr`. (It would then be better to redirect *all* messages to prevent them getting out of sync.)

(Haven't yet looked at the whole spkg, just the attached patch.)

Old libraries should (if at all) only be deleted *after a successful build*.

The package apparently doesn't use (or even find) Sage's libgcrypt:

Autocrap...

According to `configure --help`, it also takes a `--with-libgcrypt-prefix=...` option, which -- sad enough -- requires in addition `--with-libgcrypt`, but apparently doesn't work (at least in `configure` itself to detect `libgcrypt`, as the corresponding `gcc` command for `conftest.c` doesn't have any `-I`s and `-L`s).

Adding

```sh
CPPFLAGS="-I$SAGE_LOCAL/include $CPPFLAGS"
CFLAGS="-I$SAGE_LOCAL/include $CFLAGS" # It's safer to add it here, too.
LDFLAGS="-L$SAGE_LOCAL/lib $LDFLAGS"
```
(which *in general* one should do to make sure Sage's version of whatsoever gets picked up first) cures this, at the same time making `--with-libgcrypt-prefix` superfluous.


Regarding the test suite, I get nice warnings during compilation (*"cast to pointer from integer of different size"*) and the following:

As expected, compiling with `-march=core2` (to which GCC is configured to default to for 64-bit builds anyway), even more tests get run and all pass, so this is just a Valgrind problem not recognizing some fancy instructions.




> Btw., the attached spkg diff is not current.


Sorry, I think there I just confused something.




John, to what does Dave's `gcc` default to?

You **might** have to add `-std=c99` (or `-std=gnu99`) or define `_POSIX_SOURCE` or alike to pull in the correct definitions from Solaris headers, but better ask Dave, as IMHO the inclusion of `unistd.h` itself already implies at least POSIX.1.

I rather meant the language standard, which I think unfortunately isn't shown by `gcc -v` (prints more than the version number), i.e. if it is an internal default on Solaris.

`gcc -E -dM -x c /dev/null` prints all preprocessor definitions, piping it to `egrep -i "std|ansi|iso|posix|gnu"` selects (also) some standard-related ones.

But you may really try with e.g. `-D_POSIX_SOURCE`, `-std=iso9899:199409`, `-std=c99`  or `-std=gnu99` (in `CFLAGS`, perhaps also `CPPFLAGS`, but the latter shouldn't be necessary).

Or, even better, search Solaris' `unistd.h` for suspicious `#if[def]`s... :-)

Funny, it does not

```C
#define __STDC__ 1
```
which might be the cause and a bug in GCC 4.5.0, so you could try adding `-D__STDC__` to `CFLAGS`.




Did you try any of the `-std=...`?

You could also try just

```sh
gcc -std=gnu99 -E -dM -x c /dev/null | egrep -i "std|ansi|iso|posix|gnu"
```
and see if `__STDC__` gets defined then.




> I could try to search `unistd.h`, but I wouldn't know a suspicious `#if[def]` if it bit me.


:) You're not familiar with the C/C++ preprocessor?

It just adds a meta-level (all directives on lines starting with `#`) and has things like `define`, `undef`ine, `if` or `ifdef`inded-`elif`-`else`-`endif` and the usual expressions in `if`-conditions, and of course also `include`.

You usually have constructs like

```C
#ifdef __IMPORTANT_MACRO_SIGNALING_A_STANDARD__

// define the constants and functions required by that standard

#elif defined(__OTHER_IMPORTANT_STANDARD__) || defined(__SOMETHING_ELSE__)

#include <file_that_accommodates_these.h>

// perhaps other C declarations and macro definitions

#else

// perhaps define things that oppose the standard(s)

#endif
```
in C header files like `unistd.h`, located in `/usr/include/` or `/usr/local/include/`.
