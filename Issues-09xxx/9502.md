There is an inconsistency in the example below for the echelonized basis of submodules with basis:

```
sage: F = FreeModule(ZZ, 3)
sage: S = F.submodule_with_basis([(1,2,3),(3,2,1)])
sage: parent(S.basis()[0])
Free module of degree 3 and rank 2 over Integer Ring
User basis matrix:
[1 2 3]
[3 2 1]
sage: parent(S.echelonized_basis()[0])
Ambient free module of rank 3 over the principal ideal domain Integer Ring
```

For automatic bases everything is OK:

```
sage: S = F.submodule([(1,2,3),(3,2,1)])
sage: parent(S.echelonized_basis()[0])
Free module of degree 3 and rank 2 over Integer Ring
Echelon basis matrix:
[1 2 3]
[0 4 8]
sage: parent(S.basis()[0])
Free module of degree 3 and rank 2 over Integer Ring
Echelon basis matrix:
[1 2 3]
[0 4 8]
```

While I was working on this patch, I expanded documentation for `FreeModule_submodule_with_basis_pid` and rewrote its constructor to fix the issue on this ticket and make its logic more clear.

I have also discovered that it avoids calling the base constructor which checks that the base ring is indeed a PID. I tried to fix, got errors, fixed one of them (thanks to Mike Hansen), but there are more with number fields and since it was not the main issue on this ticket I delegated it to #9503.

Current patch passed all tests on 4.5.alpha1.

Sure it does, implicitly - the final bit is part of 

```
cdef class SymbolicRing(CommutativeRing):
```
which is changed.   And #8562 in alpha0 did change the behavior of Fields, though it's not clear to me how that change would affect SR's ability to import...
