```
Taylor expansion of the gamma function often causes an error.  
This example works:

```
sage: taylor(gamma(1/2+x),x,0,2)
1/4*(pi^2 + 2*euler_gamma^2 + 8*euler_gamma*log(2) + 8*log(2)^2)*sqrt(pi)*x^2 - (euler_gamma + 2*log(2))*sqrt(pi)*x + sqrt(pi)
```

but this doesn't:

```
sage: taylor(gamma(1/3+x),x,0,2)
ERROR: An unexpected error occurred while tokenizing input
The following traceback may be corrupted or invalid
The error message is: ('EOF in multi-line statement', (1254, 0))

TypeError: unable to make sense of Maxima expression 'gamma(1/3)-(6*euler_gamma+pi*sqrt(3)+9*log(3))*gamma(1/3)*x/6+(12*gamma(1/3)*psi[1](1/3)+(12*euler_gamma^2+(4*pi*sqrt(3)+36*log(3))*euler_gamma+6*log(3)*pi*sqrt(3)+pi^2+27*log(3)^2)*gamma(1/3))*x^2/24' in Sage
```

This occurs because when parsing the output from Maxima we should replace all occurrences of the polygamma function psi[n](foo) by 
psi(n,foo).

I am running Sage 4.4.1 on Mac OS X version 10.6 (Snow Leopard), built from source.  But the second example also fails on Sage 4.3.5 on 64-bit Linux, built from source.  Looking at the source code suggests that the second example will fail on all platforms.

OK, sorry about that.  I uploaded 2 patches.  The first one:

trac_9217-fix-1.patch

fixes the problem with Taylor expanding gamma functions.  The second one:

trac_9217-fix-2.patch

should be applied after the first one, and fixes the AUTHOR block.
