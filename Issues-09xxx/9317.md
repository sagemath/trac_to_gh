The code looks good and applies to 4.4.4.alpha1.  There were several glitches in the formatting of the docstrings, which I have fixed in the second patch (which needs to be applied after the first).

Note:  to test the syntax of the docstrings, do "sage -docbuild reference html" which should rebuild the reference manual pages for files which have been modified.  Look out for Warnings and Errors.  Also, look at the html output to see if it looks right!

Reply to mhansen:   The capital S is standard mathematical notation.  This also matches the functions sage.rings.rational.Rational.is_S_integral and sage.rings.rational.Rational.is_S_unit (which I wrote so this is not an independent test!)

Note:  this patch was written by some of the students at Sage Days 22, and the intention is that some other students in the same group will review it on Wednesday June 23 as part of their Sage training!
