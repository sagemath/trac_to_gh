Not totally at this time, though I see some of the things it is trying to fix.  I did take a look at some things while checking out the new matplotlib, and noticed that the example with `plot(1.5/(1+e^(-x))` is not correctly formatted in the documentation, and doesn't become a live cell.  I'm sorry to make this a long process.

Okay, here are comments.  A lot of them are very similar in style, but I tried to be exhaustive within the files you modified.  I am too tired to look for problems in the other files, though they are likely there and I likely introduced them :)  But overall this is good, I just found more of the same for most (a few other errors, though).  Here we go! 

In scatterplot, there is another one of those 'these are equivalent' things, but they're not separated out.  Also, I get code{scatter_plot.options} instead of the actual code.  Should it be show() or `show()`?

In sage.plot.polygon.polygon we have something similar in the examples - somehow you only got some of them.  Again with the extra options guy, too.

Same with the equivalent in point.py, in both `point` and `points`.

In the `plot_field.py` file, why did you once add the x,y variable declaration and once not?  It doesn't really matter to me, but I wonder if there is something I'm missing.  Again with the `show()` or show(), and the equivalent.  It's not so important to me with the equivalent showing two things, but I feel like maybe you changed that one place - or maybe not.

In plot.py, ironically, just above the place where you fixed the `1.5/(1+e^(-x))` thing, there are a bunch of plots I didn't separate in my custom ticks patch.  My apologies - but there they are!  I also still get an error 'ellipsis object not callable' or something in 'add grid lines at specific positions (using lists/tuples)'.  There's an ellipsis that got stuck in there still somehow - I think you got a different one of these.

In line.py, after the cool cat there are a couple things as in the previous files - one nonseparated, one equivalent issue/show() issue.

In disk.py, maybe the disk that is parallel to the `xy`-plane should be plotted, not just its type?  Same equiv/show question.

I don't know what happened in density plot, but I think a tick is missing in the `DensityPlot` documentation - likely my fault?  This is in 'Examples'.

In contour plot, the very last example under `region_plot` should have two plots, but has one.  But they are different.

The circles also has the parallel to the `xy`-plane issue when it comes to giving the type, but not the plot.
