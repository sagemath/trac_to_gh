'tachyon' has a script called 'Make-arch' which has various architectures. But there was not one for 64-bit Solaris on x86. The code in Sage currently uses the target 'solaris-pthreads-gcc' - see below

```
if [ $UNAME = "SunOS" ]; then
    make solaris-pthreads-gcc
    finished
fi
```

That target consists of the lines:

```
solaris-pthreads-gcc:
        $(MAKE) all \
        "ARCH = solaris-pthreads-gcc" \
        "CC = gcc" \
        "CFLAGS = -Wall -O6 -fomit-frame-pointer -ffast-math -D_REENTRANT -DSunOS $(MISCFLAGS) -DTHR -DUSEPOSIXTHREADS" \
        "AR = ar" \
        "ARFLAGS = r" \
        "STRIP = strip" \
        "LIBS = -L. -ltachyon $(MISCLIB) -lm -lpthread"
```

Note there are two problems with this. 

* '-O6' is not an option for gcc. 
* There is no option to make this build 64-bit objects. 

These problems should be easily solved.

The attached patch has a new target which I called 'solaris-pthreads-gcc-64-bit'

```
solaris-pthreads-gcc-64-bit:
        $(MAKE) all \
        "ARCH = solaris-pthreads-gcc" \
        "CC = gcc" \
        "CFLAGS = -Wall -O4 -m64 -fomit-frame-pointer -ffast-math -D_REENTRANT -DSunOS $(MISCFLAGS) -DTHR -DUSEPOSIXTHREADS" \
        "AR = ar" \
        "ARFLAGS = r" \
        "STRIP = strip" \
        "LIBS = -L. -ltachyon $(MISCLIB) -lm -lpthread"

```

Note the '-O6' has been changed to '-O4' and a -m64 added. The revised spkg-install then builds tachyon differently for 32 and 64-bit builds. 

```
if [ $UNAME = "SunOS" ]; then
    if [ "x$SAGE64" = xyes ] ; then
       # There was nothing suitable for 64-bit mode with 
       # gcc, so I made a new target. David Kirkby, May 2010. 
       make solaris-pthreads-gcc-64-bit
    else
       make solaris-pthreads-gcc
    fi
    finished
fi
```

The new package can be found at:

http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/patches/tachyon-0.98beta.p11.spkg

Note:

The file patches/Make-arch.patch was a bit out of date - someone had obviously updated patches/Make-arch without changing patches/Make-arch.patch. This has now been resolved too.
