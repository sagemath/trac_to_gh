A patch at #1396 was merged in 4.5.2.alpha0, but that caused Sage to segfault when starting on t2.math. That ticket was backed out in 4.5.2.alpha1, and should be re-merged. See #9583 for discussion.

In order to be of help for anyone looking at this ticket in some months or years time, the following description of t2.math may be useful.

To summarize the lengthy discussion on #9583:

#1396 exposed a symbol clash between Singular and Pari with some linkers.

To fix this, we rename Singular's `mu` to `Kstd1_mu`. This could be done either with the SPKG at #9583 which changes only this, or with the SPKG at #8059 which upgrades Singular to a new version that includes the renamed `mu`.

The patch applies fine to 4.6.1.rc1 and doctests pass on t2, except:

```
sage -t  -long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/tests/cmdline.py # 19 doctests failed, timeouts
sage -t  -long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/parallel/decorate.py # 1 doctests failed, OSError: [Errno 12] Not enough space
sage -t  -long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/misc/trace.py # 2 doctests failed, 
```

These don't seem related to this patch.

The patch did have a positive review before and the only issue was a SIGSEGV on startup on t2. I'll thus set this patch to a positive review.
