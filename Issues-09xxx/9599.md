To summarize the lengthy discussion on #9583:

#1396 exposed a symbol clash between Singular and Pari with some linkers.

To fix this, we rename Singular's `mu` to `Kstd1_mu`. This could be done either with the SPKG at #9583 which changes only this, or with the SPKG at #8059 which upgrades Singular to a new version that includes the renamed `mu`.

The patch applies fine to 4.6.1.rc1 and doctests pass on t2, except:

```
sage -t  -long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/tests/cmdline.py # 19 doctests failed, timeouts
sage -t  -long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/parallel/decorate.py # 1 doctests failed, OSError: [Errno 12] Not enough space
sage -t  -long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/misc/trace.py # 2 doctests failed, 
```

These don't seem related to this patch.

The patch did have a positive review before and the only issue was a SIGSEGV on startup on t2. I'll thus set this patch to a positive review.
