Here is some initial shot at constructing toric varieties "by name". It might be useful to write doctests for the toric varieties. We construct the fans from generating cones and store them in a dictionary to expedite repeated requests.

This patch relies on 
* #8988 (toric varieties) 
* #8989 (CPR-Fano toric varieties)

With these tweaks there should be no need for pickling as everything should be fast enough anyway (and pickled objects are not allowed into the Sage tarball anymore, so either we will need to have an spkg constructing them, or will have to save them on the first run).

The last five names are very cryptic, but I suppose it can be OK, if they are eventually described in the docstring.

Good point!

OK!

> Once `Fan` is finished I can migrate the construction from `Fan` to `RationalPolyhedralFan` to speed things up further.


That can make things fragile and lead to extra works of putting rays into proper spaces and making them immutable. That's exactly what `Fan(..., check=False)` is taking care of, if it does it in a slow way - it is a bug that should be fixed ;-)

It may be a good idea to keep a dictionary of these named varieties, so that repetitive calls to, say, `P1xP1` will return the same object. Another option is to make `ToricVariety` to return unique varieties if they were already constructed before, but it can be quite tedious compared to affine and projective spaces.

<a id='comment:17'></a>1) Can we replace C with A whenever it refers to complex numbers, e.g. `C2` ===> `A2` with documentation "Return the affine plane `\mathbb{A}^2` as a toric variety. ..."? I know that usually one thinks of complex numbers in toric geometry (I do it always), but the default field is the rational one and I think it would be better to have "neutral" names. Note that there is already no reference to the base field in all projective spaces, which is good, I think.

2) I think the module looks better in the documentation if its description on the first line is "Library of toric varieties" without "a". Although I can't really judge how bad it is from the English point of view not to have an article ;-)

3) In general the module docstring should include more information according to http://sagemath.org/doc/developer/conventions.html#headings-of-sage-library-code-files
At the very least you should add yourself as the initial author, some description of how it works also can be nice.

4) Unfortunately, it is not very consistent in Sage, but I try to follow http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/ cited in the beginning of http://sagemath.org/doc/developer/conventions.html#python-coding-conventions in the part of having a single line "command type" description in the beginning of docstrings, i.e. in most cases "Return ..." In many cases Sage uses "Returns ..." and the example in Developer's Guide is even worse: "This function returns ..." I definitely do not require you to follow the style I have chosen, but it can be nice if you follow it anyway for consistency purposes ;-)

5) Following Developer's Guide, the input block of `Cube_deformation` should look like

```
INPUT:

    - ``k`` -- integer. The case ``k=0`` is :meth:`Cube_face_fan`. 
```

6) I think it will be good for cross-linking compiled documentation if all functions have one of these output blocks (in addition to the more mathematical description of the output which they already have):

```
OUTPUT:

- :class:`toric variety
  <sage.schemes.generic.toric_variety.ToricVariety_field>`.

OUTPUT:

- :class:`CPR-Fano toric variety
  <sage.schemes.generic.fano_toric_variety.CPRFanoToricVariety_field>`.
```

7) I think it will be good if all examples displayed rays and names of coordinates, like

```
sage: Conifold = toric_varieties.Conifold()
sage: Conifold
3-d affine toric variety
sage: Conifold.fan().ray_matrix()
[0 0 1 1]
[0 1 0 1]
[1 1 1 1]
sage: Conifold.gens()
(u, x, y, v)
```
It will make the compiled documentation more informative.

8) `check=self._check` should be passed to constructors of toric varieties as well. Once we are confident that the rest of the code is correct and set `self._check=False` by default, my hope is that there will be no "# long time" comments in this module.

9) `sage -coverage` shows doctests of private functions as possibly wrong, there should be a comment "# indirect doctest" in their examples.

10) It also shows `TestSuite` error which I propose to ignore so far. There isn't really anything to test for such a class and I don't think there is any point in pickling it. If somebody disagrees, at least it will be easy for them to track down this module and do whatever is necessary.

Let me know what you think!

<a id='comment:22'></a>Looks great!

Just a couple more little picks:

* `Cube_deformation(k)` does NOT "Construct a sequence of toric varieties with torsion in the Chow group" since for every given `k` it will return only a particular element of the sequence. In the OUTPUT block of this function, can we turn "toric variety" into a hyperlink?

* I don't quite like that other outputs will look in the documentation like "An instance of toric variety." I am totally fine without the dash in the beginning, but I'd prefer either plain-language "Toric variety." or a longer but more code-accurate "An instance of `ToricVariety_field`." given by one of these:

```
OUTPUT:

:class:`Toric variety
<sage.schemes.generic.toric_variety.ToricVariety_field>`.

OUTPUT:

An instance of
:class:`~sage.schemes.generic.toric_variety.ToricVariety_field`.
```

The second point is optional, if "An instance of toric variety." is exactly what you want, it is OK with me.
