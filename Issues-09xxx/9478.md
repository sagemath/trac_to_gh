I have just discovered the following:

```
sage: R1.<xi, x> = QQ[]
sage: print latex(xi*x)
\xi x
sage: R2.<a> = QQ[]
sage: R3.<xi, x> = R2[]
sage: print latex(xi*x)
\xix
```
Notice no space between variables on the last line. Of course, this gives an error.

Keywords: **latex, sd31**

Component: **basic arithmetic**
