The attached patch adds support for a new token-based challenge mechanism for account creation in the sage notebook.

Workflow:

The admin enables challenges, and sets challenge_type to token.

The admin generates 50 tokens (through the user management interface) and distributes these to 50 people. (Students taking some class, for example.)

Each person that receives a token can use that token (once) to create an account.
