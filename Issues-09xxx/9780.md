As noted at #9356, a change which was made to ensure `SAGE_ATLAS_LIB` worked on Solaris, is not a complete solution. On Solaris, no shared library `liblapack.so` is created, as for reasons unknown, the shared library causes problems on Solaris. 

As noted [here](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/msg/6f064c4120fe2f65?hl=en) by François Bissey, liblapack.so often fails to build. (I assume François means on Linux). He also notes that `libcblas.so`, though I think he means `libf77blas.so`. Basically building the shared libraries is problematic in ATLAS, with different issues affecting Solaris, Linux and FreeBSD. In contrast, the static libraries are relieably built. 

The changes to this code only affect the file `system_atlas.py` and make that test for the 4 static libraries and ignore the four shared libraries. Assuming the static libraries exist, links are made. 

It was also necessary to update the messages to indicate that static libraries are needed. 

It should be noted that Mathematica 7 ships with only static libraries related to ATLAS and no shared libraries. Yet Wolfram Research primarily use shared libraries. 

It may be wisest to simply not build the shared libraries at all, but that can be left for another ticket.

On OpenSolaris at least, I can build sage-4.5.3.rc0 using only links to static libraries on a previous build (sage-4.5.3.alpha2). In other words, I set {{{SAGE_ATLAS_LIB}} with a modified version of the ATLAS package, which only made links to the static libraries. 

```
lrwxrwxrwx   1 drkirkby staff         62 Sep  6 21:52 libatlas.a -> /export/home/drkirkby/6/sage-4.5.3.alpha2/local/lib/libatlas.a

```

That passed all doctests:

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 1825.6 seconds

A good sign, but I'll test that package on Linux too.

One small correction: on OS X, I don't think anything gets installed: the system's ATLAS gets used instead.  Notice these lines in `spkg-install-script`:

```
if [ `uname` = "Darwin" ]; then
    exit 0
fi
```
These happen before the call to `make_correct_shared.sh`, so any lines in the latter script actually have no effect on Darwin, as far as I can tell.

Thank you John,

In view of this, I'll delete those lines related to OS X in `make_correct_shared.sh`, as they only add confusion. 


The version I created that linked to the static libraries in /ATLAS on Solaris 10 SPARC (`t2.math`) 

```
kirkby@t2:32 ~/t2/32/sage-4.5.3.rc0/local/lib$ ls -l | grep ATLAS
lrwxrwxrwx   1 kirkby   1093          21 Sep  6 16:56 libatlas.a -> /ATLAS/lib/libatlas.a
lrwxrwxrwx   1 kirkby   1093          21 Sep  6 16:56 libcblas.a -> /ATLAS/lib/libcblas.a
lrwxrwxrwx   1 kirkby   1093          23 Sep  6 16:56 libf77blas.a -> /ATLAS/lib/libf77blas.a
lrwxrwxrwx   1 kirkby   1093          22 Sep  6 16:56 liblapack.a -> /ATLAS/lib/liblapack.a
```

failed one doc test

```
The following tests failed:

        sage -t  -long devel/sage/sage/parallel/decorate.py # 1 doctests failed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Total time for all tests: 11326.4 seconds
```

but the system had run out of swap space, as shown in the system logs. I added some swap space, then the test passed:

```
kirkby@t2:32 ~/t2/32/sage-4.5.3.rc0$ ./sage -t  -long devel/sage/sage/parallel/decorate.py
sage -t -long "devel/sage/sage/parallel/decorate.py"        
         [39.6 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 39.8 seconds
```

It also built OK on Linux (`sage.math`), though I've not run the doctests on that yet. 

I'm marking this as "needs work" as I want to remove the erroneous information about OS X that exists in  `make_correct_shared.sh` and probably in `SPKG.txt too`. 

It's very tempting to rename `make_correct_shared.sh` to something like `occasionally_make_correct_shared.sh` !!

Here's an updated package, 

http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/patches/atlas-3.8.3.p15.spkg

which uses the 4 static libraries, but add links to the shared ones too. If they don't exist, nothing is lost. This ensures the environment is the same as would be if SAGE_ATLAS_LIB was not used, and ATLAS build from scratch. 

I've tested this on sage.math, my OpenSolaris machine, and it seems to be going OK on t2.math.

IMHO it is badly named. It should have been called SAGE_ATLAS. It is very unconventional. Take a look for example at gcc's configure options:

```
  --with-gmp=PATH         specify prefix directory for the installed GMP package.
                          Equivalent to --with-gmp-include=PATH/include
                          plus --with-gmp-lib=PATH/lib
  --with-gmp-include=PATH specify directory for installed GMP include files
  --with-gmp-lib=PATH     specify directory for the installed GMP library
```

The `LIB` in `SAGE_ATLAS_LIB` is confusing, when there are include files too. 

> In particular, it should not be set to the "parent directory of liblapack.a, libcblas.a, libatlas.a and libf77blas.a".  (I probably should have fixed this in #9356.)

I can add a patch for that if you want.


I think we have a difference of opinion about what a "parent" directory is. IMHO, if we have:

```
/usr/local/ATLAS/lib
/usr/local/ATLAS/include
```

Then the parent directory of the ATLAS installation is `/usr/local`. In other words, `SAGE_ATLAS_LIB` should be the parent directory of `/usr/local/ATLAS/lib`. I think the definition at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parent_directory is reasonable. 

I thought the wording was confusing, so thought I'd try to clarify it. Obviously you think I've made it more confusing. 

Perhaps it needs an example - the one above might be reasonable. Perhaps remove the word "parent", and just do it more by example. 

Perhaps you have a better idea.

I've not got access to any machine with a "genuine" ATLAS installation. Does such a thing exist? It's not really a standard package.

I might have an old version of Mathematica I could try, but that's a lot of messing around - installing the software just to try the library. 

I don't think it's unreasonable for someone to build Sage once with ATLAS, then at a later date use that install.

That's what I'm trying right now with some skynet machines: taurus and eno (two linux boxes), mark (solaris on sparc) and fulvia (solaris on x86).

I did notice that about `readelf`. It's basically non-portable code. No such command exists as part of the POSIX Unix standard. It appears to be part of the GNU binutils package. 

IMHO, the section:

```
            s_gfortran = os.popen2('readelf -s ' +ATLAS_LIB+'/lib/libf77blas.so | grep gfortran')[1].read()
            s_g95 = os.popen2('readelf -s ' + ATLAS_LIB + '/lib/libf77blas.so | grep g95')[1].read()

            if s_gfortran !='' and not fortran.startswith('gfortran'):
                print "Symbols in lib77blas indicate it was build with gfortran \n"
                print "However SAGE is using a different fortran compiler \n"
                print "If you wish to use this blas library, make sure SAGE_FORTRAN points \n"
                print "to a fortran compiler compatible with this library. \n"
                sys.exit(2)

            if s_g95 !='' and not fortran.startswith('g95'):
                print "Symbols in lib77blas indicate it was build with g95 \n"
                print "However SAGE is using a different fortran compiler \n"
                print "If you wish to use this blas library, make sure SAGE_FORTRAN points \n"
                print "to a fortran compiler compatible with this library. \n"
                sys.exit(2)
```

is of **extremely** limited value. It is certainly non-portable and whilst there was a time when `g95` was popular and someone might have compiled ATLAS with it, those days are long since passed. William said some time ago we can remove the g95 binaries from the fortran package. 

In any case, it is testing on a shared library `libf77blas.so` which often fails to build for people on various Linux distributions. I think removing that whole section would save a few CPU cycles and a few bytes of download. 

The failure is harmless in that if `readelf` does not exist, it will never find the symbols this bit of code tests for, so both `s_gfortran` and `s_g95` remain empty. 

It is worth bearing in mind is that this ATLAS code is never installed on Cygwin or OS X. So this code will only ever be executed on Linux, Solaris and rarer Unix systems like HP-UX, AIX etc. Only Linux systems will probably have the {{{readelf}} command, though it could be installed on Solaris, AIX, HP-UX etc. 

There are several options, ranked in order of my preference. 

1. Remove that section of code above.
2. Ignore it, since the error message is harmless. 
3. Test first if `readelf` exists. 
4. Make GNU binutils a perquisite for building Sage - i.e. add it as a  standard package.

Okay, pointing SAGE_ATLAS_LIB to the "local" directory of a previous Sage installation works for me on several solaris machines (t2 and mark2: sparc; and fulvia: x86).  It also works for me on several linux machines (taurus and eno).  So I'm happy with it.  I would have liked to test it on some linux machine with a separately installed ATLAS, but it's not a perfect world.

As far as the readelf problem goes, I think we can leave it as is.  It doesn't do any harm, after all.  My second choice would be to test whether readelf exists, or at least hide the error -- just changing os.popen2 to os.popen3 will do this, so that's easy.  If course, it might be better to test whether the command produced an error, like this:

```
sage: p = os.popen3('readelf -s ' +ATLAS_LIB+'/lib/libf77blas.so | grep gfortran')
sage: p[2].read()  # stderr, so the empty string if no error
'/bin/sh: readelf: command not found\n'
sage: p[1].read()  # stdout, so the output of the command
''
```
So we could change the code

```
            s_gfortran = os.popen2('readelf -s ' +ATLAS_LIB+'/lib/libf77blas.so | grep gfortran')[1].read()
            s_g95 = os.popen2('readelf -s ' + ATLAS_LIB + '/lib/libf77blas.so | grep g95')[1].read()
```
to the following (untested):

```
            proc_gfortran = os.popen3('readelf -s ' +ATLAS_LIB+'/lib/libf77blas.so | grep gfortran')
            proc_g95 = os.popen3('readelf -s ' +ATLAS_LIB+'/lib/libf77blas.so | grep g95')
            err = (len(proc_gfortran[2].read()) > 0) or (len(proc_g95[2].read()) > 0)

            s_gfortran = ''
            s_g95 = ''
	    if not err:  # readelf is present and ran without error
		s_gfortran = proc_gfortran[1].read()
                s_g95 = proc_g95[1].read()
```
Even better, we should rewrite it using the subprocess module, to avoid the deprecation messages.  If you think that's worthwhile, I could probably do it pretty quickly.  You would probably prefer it not written in python at all, but that's a bit more work...  Completely removing the code involves more analysis of what's going on: are there any systems which execute this code from the atlas spkg, have readelf, and also use g95?

Good, the basic code seems to work.

I felt that too. Especially since I think it can be removed. I believe it's a complete waste of time to be honest. I've left it for now though. I added a message that a warning was harmless. (For reasons I do not understand, the warning is printed **before** my message, despite the code to execute `readlef` is **after** my message.) 

I addressed the other issue you had about the parent directory. See if the following makes any more sense. I've actually printed the directory where the libraries are expected to be, based on the setting of SAGE_ATLAS_LIB. I've not committed the changes yet - let me know what you think. 

```
drkirkby@hawk:~$ export SAGE_ATLAS_LIB=/some/random/directory/for/atlas
```

now prints

```
Unable to find one of liblapack.a, libcblas.a, libatlas.a or libf77blas.a
in the directory /some/random/directory/for/atlas/lib
```

Just run 'hg diff' if you want to see what I changed. 

The package is at

Thank you John,

Yes, I'm sure it's ready. I've committed the changes and updated the .spkg at 

http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/patches/atlas-3.8.3.p15.spkg

Dave 
 
 == To the release manager ==
Only the .spkg at 
http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/patches/atlas-3.8.3.p15.spkg

needs to be added to Sage  - there are no patches to apply to it, the Sage library or anywhere else. 

Dave

Just a clarification: I didn't merge p15 here into 4.6.alpha2, because p16 at #9952 is newer.  In this case, it didn't seem appropriate to close this ticket as a "duplicate."
