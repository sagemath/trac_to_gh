**This is an upstream problem with PARI/GP**

Upstream report: [http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1099](http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1099)

The "rnfkummer" test in PARI's `make test-all` fails on the following systems:
* PPC OS X 10.4
* Linux PPC 32-bit
* Solaris SPARC

For example, on a PPC Mac OS X 10.4:

```
GP/PARI CALCULATOR Version 2.4.3 (development svn-12594)
PowerPC running darwin (PPC/GMP-5.0.1 kernel) 32-bit version
compiled: Sep  8 2010, gcc-4.5.1 (GCC)
(readline v5.0 enabled, extended help enabled)
```

I get a failure in rnfkummer (both sta and dyn), I am attaching the dif and the output of Configure.

All modern SPARC systems are 64-bit. The Sun Ultra 1, which was the first 64-bit machine from Sun, was bought out in 1995 - i.e. 15 years ago, well before any Intel or AMD chip was 64-bit.

The fact John said the tests fail on 'mark' but pass on 'fulvia' does indicate it's very likely to be a big-endian issue. I have a machine running HP-UX which uses a PA-RISC processor. That is big-endian. I could try building Pari on there, though I'm not sure if it will work or not. I'd not be surprised if it failed to build on there.

Georg, perhaps you could confirm that `-fno-common` is also needed on MacOS X 10.4 **Intel** machines? (Or the opposite, but to me that's unlikely.)

It should be sufficient to just try

```sh
$ cd .../pari-2.4.3.svn-12577.p6/src
$ ./Configure --graphic=none
$ make gp
```
(with http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/pari-2.4.3.svn-12577.p6.spkg)
