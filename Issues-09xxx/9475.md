The new version improves elimination to some extent, comes with a cleaner API and has an option to suppress SSE instructions.

1. SPKG.txt under "Releases" says latest 
release is libm4ri-20100107, do you mean
libm4ri-20100701?

2. Since spkg-check exists, in spkg-install 
the commented out lines:

```
# $MAKE check
# if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
#     echo "libm4ri testsuite failed, please report upstream!"
#     exit 1
# fi
```

can be removed.

3. In spkg-install, if SAGE_FAT_BINARY is yes, then
sse2 is disabled.  What about sse3 as was the reported
problem in [#9381](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/9381)

4. This version of libm4ri does not appear under the
downloads on the [m4ri](http://m4ri.sagemath.org) web site,
thus no way to tell if the source in the spkg corresponds
to the source under the claimed version.

`SPKG.txt`:
* *Author* should be *Author**s***
* Is the given e-mail address still up-to-date?
* I'd substitute *"function names match what the function is doing now"*
  by *"function names **now** match ... is doing"*
* s/supress/su**p**press/
* s/SSE2 instruction/SSE2 instruction**s**/

`spkg-install:`
* Old typo, I guess: s/CLFAGS/CFLAGS/ twice
* The choice of the variable name `SSE2_SUPPORT` isn't that nice; I'd rather call it `DISABLE_SSE2`, but never mind.

`spkg-check:`
* Uses `make` rather than `$MAKE` (in contrast to `spkg-install`), but shouldn't be a problem.

<div id="comment:9" align="right">comment:9</div>

I'd suggest adding the (standard) section *Special Update/Build Instructions* to `SPKG.txt`, with the following:
* Remove upstream Mercurial repository (directory `src/.hg`, file `src/.hgtags`)
* Remove directory `src/autom4te.cache`, file `src/m4ri.vcproj`

I've built a p1 spkg with the above mentioned files removed: 392KB vs. 1.2MB

If there are no dependencies on Sage packages (which is the case here), we don't need to add `$SAGE_LOCAL/include` to the preprocessor search path in `spkg-install` (`CFLAGS` and `CPPFLAGS`).

Perhaps touch `src/configure`, because it has the same time stamp as `configure.*`.

Upstream notes:
* There is no target `clean`.
* `src/NEWS` and `src/ChangeLog` are **empty** files. ;-)

Tests in progress,

Leif

I've only installed the new package (dated July 13th) and applied the patch, i.e. did not build Sage from scratch, and haven't (yet) run the testsuite.

Shame on me I missed that one:

```sh
./spkg-install: line 47: [x: command not found
```

```sh
if ["x$SAGE_FAT_BINARY" = "xyes"]; then
    SSE2_SUPPORT="--disable-sse2"
else
    SSE2_SUPPORT=""
fi
```
should be

```sh
if [ "x$SAGE_FAT_BINARY" = "xyes" ]; then
    ...
```
Note that `[` is actually a *command* (namely an alias for or link to `test`, depending on the shell), and `]` is its last parameter.

---

On both of the above systems, the testsuite passed without errors.

(I reinstalled the package(s) with `SAGE_CHECK="yes"`.)

Ok, I'll create a cumulative spkg patch and a "stripped-down" p1 package in a few hours and then mail you both.

(I assume your .ac.uk e-mail address in SPKG.txt is still appropriate as upstream contact.)

Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred in Sage.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* component
of Sage has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
or is not properly wrapped with _sig_on, _sig_off.
You might want to run Sage under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.

## Note to the release managers

**Apply only [m4ri_new_version.v2.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9475/m4ri_new_version.v2.patch.gz) to the Sage library** when merging the [new M4RI spkg](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/malb/spkgs/libm4ri-20100701.p1.spkg); that patch is identical to `m4ri_new_version.patch` except for the commit message. (I don't have the power to replace Martin's attachment.)
