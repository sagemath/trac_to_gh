Sage needs a good thematic tutorial on symmetric functions. An embryo is in sage.combinat.sf.symmetric_functions, but it's quite indigent (I wrote it, and take the blame):

- Reference it from doc/en/reference/combinat/symmetric_functions.rst and highlight it as the *main* entry point for symmetric functions
- Make sure `sage.combinat.sf?` points to this tutorial
- Extend it! (for general use, but also for kschur and the like)

This ticket can be closed as soon as #14900 is merged. #5457 took care of providing a nice tutorial, and #14090 exposes it nicely in the thematic tutorials.
