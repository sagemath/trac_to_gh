OK, so I know that some people don't like my programs putting tabs into output, which I do so the output looks pretty when viewed by humans!

I suppose that one solution is to post-process the long string output by mwrank, replacing its tabs by an appropriate number of spaces.

This is just the sort of annoying triviality which makes adding doctests take so much longer than it ought!

I'll post a revised patch shortly.

Attachment: **[trac_9228-mwrank-doctest.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9228/trac_9228-mwrank-doctest.patch.gz)**

The new version of the patch does what I suggested, i.e. replaces all tabs in mwrank output by three spaces;  the doctest which failed before has been adjusted accordingly.

I could not find any other doctest which would be affected by this, and tested all sage/interfaces and sage/schemes/elliptic_curves.

I can't help noticing that you've replaced tabs with 3 spaces, but Solaris seems to replace them with 4 spaces -- so I suspect that it still won't work (groan).

Think again.  I have removed the tabs so Solaris will not need to do anything!

Here's a test:  on the solaris machine, do

```
echo 0 -1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 | sage -mwrank -v 0 -q -l > t
```
and see if the file t contains any tab characters.  If it does, then mwrank is behaving normally and the tab conversion is happening further downstream.
