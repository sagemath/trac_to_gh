So I can give Andrey's patch a positive review.

We could have added the hash codes for 32-bit systems, too, instead.

We could, but I don't know how to get those values for 32-bit systems on 64-bit ones and as I understand those numbers don't have any sense anyway and can potentially change. So these doctests just check that `hash` can be used and it returns the same value. If adding 32-bit hashes would be better, please add them.

I find it very peculiar how slow is `polyhedra.py` in this test. On sage.math most tests are a little bit faster, but this one takes only 41 second! On my quite old Mobile AMD Athlon 64 3000+ (1.8GHz) results are closer to those above, but `polyhedra.py` still tests only in 74 seconds! Is it just the difference between 32 and 64 bits?..

I thought that maybe Leif's suggestions would be preferred, but Carl Witty said (https://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/9a0f357c8ec9bbd):

```
Hmm... looks like the current state of affairs is a mess.  Looking
through the 'def __hash__' grep hits in sage/rings, there are quite a
few of each of the following:

1) no doctest at all
2) provide both 32-bit and 64-bit doctests
3) define your hash function to produce a 32-bit output that's the
same on 32-bit and 64-bit systems; doctest an instance of that output
4) doctest hash value equality without ever showing a doctest output

plus one instance where the hash output is marked "# random".

So whatever you do with this particular patch, it won't make things
much worse :) 
```
So, I'll merge this, and maybe we'll figure out a better way to test hashing later.
