## Build environment
* Sun Ultra 27 3.33 GHz Intel W3580 Xeon. Quad core. 8 threads. 12 GB RAM
* OpenSolaris 2009.06 snv_111b X86
* Sage 4.4.2
* gcc 4.4.4

## How gcc 4.4.4 was configured
Since the configuration of gcc is fairly critical on OpenSolaris, here's how it was built. 

```
drkirkby@hawk:~/sage-4.4.2$ gcc -v
Using built-in specs.
Target: i386-pc-solaris2.11
Configured with: ../gcc-4.4.4/configure --prefix=/usr/local/gcc-4.4.4 --with-as=/usr/local/binutils-2.20/bin/as --with-ld=/usr/ccs/bin/ld --with-gmp=/usr/local --with-mpfr=/usr/local
Thread model: posix
gcc version 4.4.4 (GCC) 
```

gcc 4.3.4 was failing to build iconv. 

## How the Sage build was attempted
* 64-bit build. SAGE64 was set to "yes"
* #9008 update zlib to latest upstream release to allow a 64-bit library to be built. 
* #9009 update mercurial spkg to build 64-bit.
* #7982 update sage_fortran so it can build 64-bit binaries.
* 'touch' spkg/installed/gdmodule-0.56.p7 to fool Sage into thinking gdmodule had installed, as it is failing to (see #9021)

## The problem

One can see that _socket is not being built:

```
running build
running build_ext
building '_socket' extension

/export/home/drkirkby/sage-4.4.2/spkg/build/python-2.6.4.p7/src/Modules/socketmodule.c: In function ‘init_socket’:

/export/home/drkirkby/sage-4.4.2/spkg/build/python-2.6.4.p7/src/Modules/socketmodule.c:4590: error: ‘PACKET_FASTROUTE’ undeclared (first use in this function)
building '_ssl' extension
```
This is shown later when the list of failed modules is displayed in the Sage build log. 

```
Failed to build these modules:
_curses            _curses_panel      _socket
_ssl               _tkinter           sunaudiodev
```

This then causes ipython to fail to build. 

```
  File "/export/home/drkirkby/sage-4.4.2/spkg/build/ipython-0.9.1.p0/src/IPython/iplib.py", line 71, in <module>
    from IPython.Prompts import CachedOutput
  File "/export/home/drkirkby/sage-4.4.2/spkg/build/ipython-0.9.1.p0/src/IPython/Prompts.py", line 23, in <module>
    import socket
  File "/export/home/drkirkby/sage-4.4.2/local/lib/python/socket.py", line 46, in <module>
    import _socket
ImportError: No module named _socket
Error installing Ipython

real    0m0.186s
user    0m0.136s
sys     0m0.046s
sage: An error occurred while installing ipython-0.9.1.p0
```

## Likely hints as to the cause
The following couple of links have something written about the _socket issue:

* http://www.opensolaris.org/jive/thread.jspa?threadID=5426&tstart=0
* http://www.lotuseyes.de/blog/error-installing-plone-on-opensolaris-using-the-unified-installer

As of this minute, I don't have a solution for this. 

The solution proposed at 

http://www.lotuseyes.de/blog/error-installing-plone-on-opensolaris-using-the-unified-installer 

may be workable, though I would restrict the patch to just OpenSolaris, not just any Solaris release, which is what suspect his

```
#if defined(__sun)
#  define ifr_ifindex ifr_index
#  undef HAVE_NETPACKET_PACKET_H
#endif
```

will do.
