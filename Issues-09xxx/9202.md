This spkg updates matplotlib to 0.99.3.  I've attached the patch as well (don't apply; it's just for reviewing purposes).

  Reason: Incompatible library version: ft2font.so requires version 11.0.0 or later, but libfreetype.6.dylib provides version 10.0.0
```

So somehow this is picking up my macports version of freetype.  That's a problem.

Not working on Solaris either. It still reports:

```

             freetype2: 9.7.3
```

Freetype is really confusing in that there are 3 numbers associated with a release. Then to make matters worst, sometimes it called freetype, and other times freetype2. I think they are the same. 

```

```

freetype2 9.7.3 is also known as version 2.1.8. Since Sage 4.4.3 includes freetype 2.3.5, matplotlib should report it has found freetype2 version 9.16.3 and not 9.7.3 as it does. 

Rather inconveniently, the version of freetype globally installed on sage.math and boxen.math are the same as in Sage. This makes the message from matplotlib about the version of freetype will be the same in either case.

**I think if you manage to get matplotlib to indicate it has found freetype2, but is unable to determine the version, I think you will have solved it.** At the moment matplotlib seems to be using pkg-config on Solaris and Linux (but not OS X) to look up the version, and find the directories of the include and library files.

<div id="comment:3" align="right">comment:3</div>

I forgot to add, one other change that is needed, is a revised spkg-install, to ensure matplotlib builds 64-bit. 

```
if [ `uname` = "Darwin" -a "$SAGE64" = "yes" ]; then
   echo "64 bit MacIntel"
   CFLAGS="-O2 -g -m64 "; export CFLAGS
   LDFLAGS="-m64 "; export LDFLAGS
fi
```

should be changed to:

```
if [ "x$SAGE64" = xyes ]; then
   echo "Building a 64-bit version of matplotlib"
   CFLAGS="-O2 -g -m64 "; export CFLAGS
   LDFLAGS="-m64 "; export LDFLAGS
fi
```

The best solution looks to be to get pkg-config to work properly, which requires it knows where the Sage files are to be found. That is done by setting the variable PKG_CONFIG_PATH.

I've uploaded a new spkg (same URL as in the description), and updated the patch attached to this ticket to reflect the total changes in this spkg.

Depends on #9208 and #9210 (both applied to the sage-scripts repository!) to correctly identify freetype, even after moving the Sage directory.

This version from svn is causing a problem on the following system, which we should report to the developers. 

* Sun Blade 1000
* 2 x 900 MHz
* 2 GB RAM
* Solaris 10 03/05 
 

```
/usr/include/stdlib.h:144: error: declaration of C function 'void swab(const char*, char*, ssize_t)' conflicts with
/usr/include/unistd.h:480: error: previous declaration 'void swab(const void*, void*, ssize_t)' here
error: command 'gcc' failed with exit status 1
Error building matplotlib package.
```

The Solaris header files are a lot stricter about what they do/do not declare than most systems, depending on the mode of compilation. An inspection of stdlib.h shows the problem. 

```
extern int putenv(char *);
extern void setkey(const char *);
#endif /* defined(__EXTENSIONS__) || !defined(_STRICT_STDC) ... */

/*
 * swab() has historically been in <stdlib.h> as delivered from AT&T
 * and continues to be visible in the default compilation environment.
 * As of Issue 4 of the X/Open Portability Guides, swab() was declared
 * in <unistd.h>. As a result, with respect to X/Open namespace the
 * swab() declaration in this header is only visible for the XPG3
 * environment.
 */
#if (defined(__EXTENSIONS__) || \
        (!defined(_STRICT_STDC__) && !defined(_POSIX_C_SOURCE))) && \
        (!defined(_XOPEN_SOURCE) || (defined(_XPG3) && !defined(_XPG4)))
#ifndef _SSIZE_T
#define _SSIZE_T
#if defined(_LP64) || defined(_I32LPx)
typedef long    ssize_t;        /* size of something in bytes or -1 */
#else
typedef int     ssize_t;        /* (historical version) */
#endif
#endif  /* !_SSIZE_T */

extern void swab(const char *, char *, ssize_t);
#endif /* defined(__EXTENSIONS__) || !defined(_STRICT_STDC) ... */
```

and in unistd.h

```
#if defined(_XPG4)
/* __EXTENSIONS__ makes the SVID Third Edition prototype in stdlib.h visible */
extern void swab(const void *_RESTRICT_KYWD, void *_RESTRICT_KYWD, ssize_t);
#endif /* defined(_XPG4) */
```

As such, I think your previous version, based on the stable release, rather than a SVN snapshot is preferable. 

I'm attaching the two relevant header files to this ticket.
