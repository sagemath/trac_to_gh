There are a number of tickets active at the minute with patches to ECL

* #8808
* #9187
* #8951
* #8089

none have been merged, but the patches are not consistent across all or them. 

* The option --with-dffi=no  from #8089 has not been been missed which is very important. 
* Some other less important changes (such as removing an inaccurate, but innocuous mention of building a 32-bit version) are removed. 
* There is a 10.4.1.p0 package, despite no 10.4.1 has actually been merged. 

The aim of this ticket is to update to the 10.4.1 source code, whilst ensuring all the relevant patches are applied. 

## Important

On #8951 Jason says "As a reminder here, this (i.e. #8951) should *only* be merged simultaneously with the new maxima at #8731."

Assuming Jason is correct, that gives us a problem. 

The Maxima update seems to have stalled (there are no updates on the ticket for 3 weeks). If updating Maxima to 5.21.1 and ECL 10.4.1 need to be done together, it will probably be best to create a ecl-10.2.1.p0, which has all the small changes, and actually leave updating to the latest ECL code until it can be better coordinated with the Maxima update. 

At the moment, it seems several small but important changes to the ECL installation are being held up for a non-trivial set of changes needed if Mamima is updated.

Your best chance is to see if you can give a positive review to
#8645. The maxima spkg there:

```
http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/nbruin/maxima-5.20.1.p1.spkg
```
is the same maxima that is in sage now, with minimal changes applied to let maxima build under ECL 10.4.1.

If maxima.5.20.1.p1 on ecl.10.4.1 needs work, we might as well wait until maxima.5.21 is ready to be merged, because then the problem is ecl.10.4.1.

When I tried, I couldn't get maxima to build properly under ecl.10.2 (its "ASDF" is too buggy)

I've created a new ECL package

http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/revised-patches/ecl-10.4.1.spkg

which has the following fixes applied:

* Updates ECL to the latest upstream, 10.4.1
* Applies a fix to stop ECL building in parallel, which is ticket #9187. This already has positive review. 
* Applies the fix from #8089 to disable the dynamic foreign function interface as advised by the ECL developer. This disables the use of assembly code on OpenSolaris x64, but no other platform.
* Removes files from /tmp/ECL* as soon as they are no longer needed, as failure to do so can present problems on multi-user systems. 

All changes have been checked with #8645, which has a change to Maxima which allows Maxima to build with the latest ECL. The patch on #8645 does **not** update Maxima to the latest version, as that creates problems which are non-trivial to solve. It does however fix a problem with Maxima not installing the library properly, and allows Maxima to build with the latest ECL>

As such, the attached ticket:
 
* Allows Maxima to build the library properly whilst still working with the latest ECL. 
* Remove unwanted ECL tmp files. 
* Allows spkgs to build in parallel
* Allow ECL to build on OpenSolaris x64. 

Here are the test results:

 == Testing on Solaris 10 SPARC in 32-bit mode. ==
* Sun Blade 1000
* 2 x 900 MHz UltraSPARC III+ CPUs
* 2 GB RAM
* Solaris 10 03/2005 (first release of Solaris 10)
* gcc 4.4.3 (uses Sun linker and assembler) 
* Sage 4.4.4.alpha1

## Note to Release manager
There are many tickets active at the minute for updates to Maxima and ECL. Once positively, this should be integrated with Maxima at #8645. At the time of writing, the use of the latest Maxima will cause problems with doctest failures, as Maxima's output is changed from the current version.

I have tested this ticket by building sage 4.4.3 with the following spkgs substituted:
http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/revised-patches/ecl-10.4.1.spkg
http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/nbruin/maxima-5.20.1.p1.spkg
All doctests pass on `sage.math.washington.edu`. Furthermore, the ecl-10.4.1 package looks like it does what it's supposed to. When I diff it with http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/nbruin/ecl-10.4.1.spkg there are some unexpected files and differences in binary files in the `.hg` subdir, but otherwise the packages agree.

Merging this ticket should be a good stepping stone towards #8731 (assuming the issues there haven't been resolved by the time the next release merges are made). Merging this ticket would also resolve #8645, as well as all ECL related ticket referred to.

I just noticed a small inaccuracy in the description of the hardware used to test this on OpenSolaris. It does not affect the validity of the ticket, but it is sensible to correct the error. 

The section marked *Testing on OpenSolaris x64 06/2009 64-bit mode.* states the processors are:

* 2 x 3.33 GHz quad core Intel Xeon MHz 

which is incorrect. Unfortunately, the Sun Ultra 27 does not support more than one CPU. A more accurate description of the hardware/software used to test this ECL package on OpenSolaris is:

## Testing on OpenSolaris x64 06/2009 64-bit mode.
* [Sun Ultra 27 workstation](http://www.sun.com/desktop/workstation/ultra27/)
* 1 x 3.33 GHz 64-bit [Intel Xeon W3580](http://ark.intel.com/Product.aspx?id=39723) CPU (4 cores, 8 threads, 8 MB cache). 
* 12 GB RAM
* [OpenSolaris](http://www.opensolaris.com/) 06/2009 (Last release of OpenSolaris, updated to build 134)
* [gcc 4.4.4](http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.4/changes.html) (uses Sun linker and GNU assembler)
* Sage 4.4.4.alpha1

I removed the included gmp as discussed in #9493.

Are there any other outstanding patches? I've looked through trac and there seem to be many overlapping discussions. But I could not find any outstanding bugs.

The new ecl requires also a new maxima (5.22.1 is newest upstream release), so we have to update both at the same time. I've created #10187 for a simultaneous ecl+maxima update.
