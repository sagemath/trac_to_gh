Although the units module already has a si_prefixes component, it's not very convenient, since you have to do units.si_prefixes.nano*units.mass.gram, and you get something like "gram*nano" that doesn't look very well.
This ticket is a modification that adds properties named as the components of units.si_prefixes, so that calling something like units.mass.gram.nano will create a units.mass.nanogram element and return it.

Duplicate of #9778.

Why does the new function name start with an underscore? Wouldn't it be easier to find it if was just named `si_prefix()`?

So should this be closed in favor of #9778?

Also, 

```
def _add_si_property_(prefix): 
 	    setattr(UnitExpression, prefix, property(lambda self: self._si_prefix_(prefix))) 
 
for prefix in unitdict['si_prefixes']: 
     _add_si_property_(prefix) 
```
seems to be missing a doctest in the underscore function.
