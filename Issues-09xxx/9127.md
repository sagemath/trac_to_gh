This failure seems remarkably close to #8749, which is closed as fixed, but this is the same sort of problem on the same doctest. Note, changing SAGE_TIMOUT will not change this, as it appears (to me at least), Sage is switching from one algorithm to another in a time which is independent of the processor speed or settings of any timeout variables. 

## Hardware & associated software

* Sun Blade 1000
* 2 x 900 MHz UltraSPARC III+ CPUs
* 2 GB RAM
* Solaris 10 03/2005 (first release of Solaris 10)
* gcc 4.4.3 (uses Sun linker and assembler)

 == Sage version ==
* 4.4.3.alpha0 and 4.4.3.alpha1
 
 == The test failure ==
A full log of all tests can be found at

http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/sage-4.4.3.alpha0-Sun-Blade-1000-900MHz-Solaris-10-ptestlong.log.gz

(There are 3 failures, but I believe the other two are common to more than one platform and work is progressing on them)

I would expect to see this fail the same way on 't2' as 't2' is slower on single threaded tasks than the Blade 1000.

This one confuses me.  Before I apply the patch, the file passes long tests for me (ubuntu 64-bit, on 4.4.3).  But after the patch it does not:

```

So whether or not the patch fixes things on some systems, it breaks others, so cannot be included.
