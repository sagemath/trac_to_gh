This failure seems remarkably close to #8749, which is closed as fixed, but this is the same sort of problem on the same doctest. Note, changing SAGE_TIMOUT will not change this, as it appears (to me at least), Sage is switching from one algorithm to another in a time which is independent of the processor speed or settings of any timeout variables. 

## Hardware & associated software

* Sun Blade 1000
* 2 x 900 MHz UltraSPARC III+ CPUs
* 2 GB RAM
* Solaris 10 03/2005 (first release of Solaris 10)
* gcc 4.4.3 (uses Sun linker and assembler)

 == Sage version ==
* 4.4.3.alpha0 and 4.4.3.alpha1
 
 == The test failure ==
A full log of all tests can be found at

http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/sage-4.4.3.alpha0-Sun-Blade-1000-900MHz-Solaris-10-ptestlong.log.gz

(There are 3 failures, but I believe the other two are common to more than one platform and work is progressing on them)

I would expect to see this fail the same way on 't2' as 't2' is slower on single threaded tasks than the Blade 1000.

This one confuses me.  Before I apply the patch, the file passes long tests for me (ubuntu 64-bit, on 4.4.3).  But after the patch it does not:

```
sage -t -long "sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/BSD.py"

So whether or not the patch fixes things on some systems, it breaks others, so cannot be included.

The patch results in the test passing on the Sun Blade 1000 where the test originally failed. 

```
drkirkby@redstart:~/sage-4.4.3.alpha3$ ./sage -t  -long devel/sage/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/BSD.py
sage -t -long "devel/sage/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/BSD.py"
         [135.0 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 135.0 seconds
```

I would be tempted to give it a positive review, though the fact John had a problem, it would be wise to wait and see if he has any further comments. But the changes look OK to me and it solves the problem.
