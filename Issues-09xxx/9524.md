I just ran into the following nasty bug:

```
sage: polygen(GF(49, 'a')) ; polygen(GF(9, 'a'))
x
x
sage: x = polygen(GF(49, 'a'))
sage: -x
2*x
sage: x + 0
x
sage: -x
6*x
```

This is still present in sage-4.5. 

We have to ensure two things before playing with NTL finite field elements:
* restore the ZZ_p context (characteristic);
* restore the ZZ_pE context (defining polynomial).
Restoring the latter does not automatically restore the former.

There is indeed a bunch of PY_NEW all over the place in `polynomial_template.pxi`.

Anyway IIRC the use of `PY_NEW` is hackish and one should now use the more proper `__new__` (not sure of the underscore pattern) which might be easier to override for NTL specific needs.

The problem is actually different from what was stated in the original description.

In fact, calling PY_NEw or whatever before restoring context was not the (only) rpoblem.
The main problem is that restoring the ZZ_pE context does not restore the "current" prime from the ZZ_p context.

It should be possible to define a cpp class storing the two pointers (as the current C struct) with an additional mehod calling the restore method through the two pointers in sage/libs/ntl/whatever.pxd  or .h and implement it directly in an additional sage/libs/ntl/whatever.cpp.
One would have to include the NTL directly, and maybe hack through the hackish name mangling currently done in Sage (I presume the NTL wrapper was written before Pyrex/Cython correctly supported C++).
Not sure it is worth the trouble doing that in Sage.
But this is surely worth a mail to Shoup in case he agrees to add a new method to ZZ_pEContext restoring both the modulus and the characteristic.

I've pushed a C++ solution to `u/jpflori/ticket/9524cpp` which is currently broken for two reasons:
* It adds an header in `src/sage/libs/ntl/ZZ_peContext_ptrs.h` which is found by the files needing it in the same folder, but not by files in other folders, e.g. files in the `padics` folder. As a testing hack, just copy it to `local/include`.
* python fails to import/dlopen `polynomial_zz_pex.so` (just try the ticket description test with the C++ branch) because of an undefined reference to the `restore` method of the new `ZZ_pEContext_ptrs` C++ class. Note the symbol is well defined in `ntl_ZZ_pEContext_class.so` (with the same C++ name mangling stuff, and `nm` gives a `D` for it) and can be used from there. I've not coded in C++ for some time, so I must have done somethign wrong. If any better (or just real) C++ coder can give us a clue, that would be very welcome.

Whatsoever, unless someone knows how to easily fix the above two issues, let's get the dirty plain C solution merged.

Adding

import ctypes   
flags = sys.getdlopenflags()
sys.setdlopenflags(flags | ctypes.RTLD_GLOBAL)
```
to `src/sage/all.py` solves the second issue (which was the more worrying one as far as I'm concerned).

We could also link file that needs it to the p/cython generated so file.
But I have no idea in which order cython builds the so files.
So I think the only proper C++ solution is to build an external so file with what I've put in, and install it in local/ and link to it.
Or that such a class is integrated into NTL directly.
And I think it's overkill, so I won't follow this path anymore.
