Motivated by a bug hunt for #2420, I found:

```
sage: R.<a, b> = QQ[]
sage: b._pari_()
b
sage: GF(7)(5).log()
5
sage: b._pari_()
Mod(3, 7)
```

The reason is that in the `log` method, the string

```
'b=Mod(%s,%s); if(znorder(b)!=eulerphi(%s),-1,znlog(%s,b))'%(b, self.__modulus.sageInteger,
                                                                           self.__modulus.sageInteger, self)
```
is evaluated in `pari`, so that afterwards `pari('b')` isn't doing what it should.

Since this bug is triggered whenever a GAP representation of a finite field element is created, I mark this ticket "critical". I hope "basic arithmetic" is the right component.

sage -t "devel/sage/sage/rings/finite_rings/integer_mod.pyx" passes, I now do sage -testall

Of course, I added a doctest against the bug.

This modifies exactly the same code as #9205 (which already has a positive review). Sadly I didn't spot this problem when I wrote that patch. Can you check to see if your patch applies OK on top of #9205, and if not, rebase it?

It did not apply on top of #9205. So, I replaced the original patch by one that is to be applied after the two patches from #9205.
