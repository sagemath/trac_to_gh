Though #7299 helped, graph vertices are still cut off.

We can turn off clipping of the matplotlib scatterplot and add some bbox_extra_artists to the savefig which takes those artists into account when calculating the bounding box (when bbox_inches='tight').

Here is a good example showing the problem (still):

```
a=matrix([[1,2],[3,4]])

var('x y z w')
b=matrix([[x,y],[z,w]])

a.set_immutable()
b.set_immutable()

K=DiGraph({a:[b]})
show(K, vertex_size=800)

I think this patch might take just a little to clean up.  Most of the patch is just adding comments to explain the code or reformatting long lines.  The big key is the clip=False arguments and the code to add things to the bbox_extra_artists.

I think the patch might just need some doctests and testing.  The other comments I put in above can be moved to another ticket that does a bigger revamp of graph drawing.

**Attachment:** [with-additional-padding.png](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9211/with-additional-padding.png)

Added two patches. The [first one](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9211/trac-9211-fix_cut_vertices_in_graphs.patch) is essentially the patch by jason redone to work with 4.7.2_alpha3.

The [second patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9211/trac-9211-add_padding_to_graphs.patch) adds extra padding to all graphs. The two pngs attached are the output of

```
M = matrix(RDF, [[1/3, 1/3, 1/3], [0, 1/4, 3/4], [1/2, 1/4, 1/4]])
G=DiGraph(M, format='weighted_adjacency_matrix')
G.show(vertex_size=800, edge_labels=True)
```

The file [attachment:with-additional-padding.png](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9211/with-additional-padding.png) is the result of both the patches being applied.

Graphs currently look really bad without either of the two patches. The second patch is not a panacea for all cut off graph plots since it doesn't fix all cases. But my hope is that it fixes most commonly used cases.

Uploaded new patch.

Didn't know about `-fixdoctests` (it wasn't too painful to fix because of vim)

Forget about the adding padding patch. Jason did the real fix. :)

Previous failures were:

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The following tests failed:

	sage -t  -long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/plot/scatter_plot.py # 1 doctests failed
	sage -t  -long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/plot/text.py # 5 doctests failed
	sage -t  -long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/plot/circle.py # 8 doctests failed
	sage -t  -long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/plot/plot3d/base.pyx # 5 doctests failed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Total time for all tests: 8844.0 seconds
```

New doctest on `devel/sage/sage/plot/` passes all doctests:

```
~/Installations/sage-4.7.2> ./sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/plot
...
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 520.6 seconds
```
So positive review from my side.

Your changes were a little more than just fixing whitespace, so let someone look at it to review your last patch.

Sorry---you're right about those doctests.  I shouldn't have been so sloppy as to not fix those doctests before indicating it needed to be reviewed.
