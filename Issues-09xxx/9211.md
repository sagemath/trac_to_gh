Attachment: **[with-additional-padding.png](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9211/with-additional-padding.png)**

Added two patches. The [first one](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9211/trac-9211-fix_cut_vertices_in_graphs.patch.gz) is essentially the patch by jason redone to work with 4.7.2_alpha3.

The [second patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9211/trac-9211-add_padding_to_graphs.patch.gz) adds extra padding to all graphs. The two pngs attached are the output of

```
M = matrix(RDF, [[1/3, 1/3, 1/3], [0, 1/4, 3/4], [1/2, 1/4, 1/4]])
G=DiGraph(M, format='weighted_adjacency_matrix')
G.show(vertex_size=800, edge_labels=True)
```

The file [attachment: with-additional-padding.png](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9211/with-additional-padding.png) is the result of both the patches being applied.

Graphs currently look really bad without either of the two patches. The second patch is not a panacea for all cut off graph plots since it doesn't fix all cases. But my hope is that it fixes most commonly used cases.

I wonder why you are concatenating lines in the doctest output - our docstrings are theoretically supposed to be 72 (or 79) characters wide, if I'm not mistaken, which is why they the current test results are broken into multiple lines. The doctester doesn't care about purely whitespace differences between the expected and received output.
