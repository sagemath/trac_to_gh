Though #7299 helped, graph vertices are still cut off.

We can turn off clipping of the matplotlib scatterplot and add some bbox_extra_artists to the savefig which takes those artists into account when calculating the bounding box (when bbox_inches='tight').

Here is a good example showing the problem (still):

```
a=matrix([[1,2],[3,4]])

var('x y z w')
b=matrix([[x,y],[z,w]])

a.set_immutable()
b.set_immutable()

K=DiGraph({a:[b]})
show(K, vertex_size=800)

Added two patches. The [attachment:trac-9211-fix_cut_vertices_in_graphs.patch first one] is essentially the patch by jason redone to work with 4.7.2_alpha3.

The [attachment:trac-9211-add_padding_to_graphs.patch second patch] adds extra padding to all graphs. The two pngs attached are the output of

```
M = matrix(RDF, [[1/3, 1/3, 1/3], [0, 1/4, 3/4], [1/2, 1/4, 1/4]])
G=DiGraph(M, format='weighted_adjacency_matrix')
G.show(vertex_size=800, edge_labels=True)
```

The file [attachment:with-additional-padding.png] is the result of both the patches being applied.

Graphs currently look really bad without either of the two patches. The second patch is not a panacea for all cut off graph plots since it doesn't fix all cases. But my hope is that it fixes most commonly used cases.

Just FYI, base.pyx often fails on Mac if you don't have libjpeg or libtiff in the right place - see #7344 and #7345.  If the errors look like 

```
