Though #7299 helped, graph vertices are still cut off.

We can turn off clipping of the matplotlib scatterplot and add some bbox_extra_artists to the savefig which takes those artists into account when calculating the bounding box (when bbox_inches='tight').

Added two patches. The [attachment:trac-9211-fix_cut_vertices_in_graphs.patch first one] is essentially the patch by jason redone to work with 4.7.2_alpha3.

The [attachment:trac-9211-add_padding_to_graphs.patch second patch] adds extra padding to all graphs. The two pngs attached are the output of

```
M = matrix(RDF, [[1/3, 1/3, 1/3], [0, 1/4, 3/4], [1/2, 1/4, 1/4]])
G=DiGraph(M, format='weighted_adjacency_matrix')
G.show(vertex_size=800, edge_labels=True)
```

The file [attachment:with-additional-padding.png] is the result of both the patches being applied.

Graphs currently look really bad without either of the two patches. The second patch is not a panacea for all cut off graph plots since it doesn't fix all cases. But my hope is that it fixes most commonly used cases.

> Can you try applying just trac-9211-fix_cut_vertices_in_graphs.patch and  trac_9211_digraph_clipping.patch ?
