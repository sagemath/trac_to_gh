```
Consider the following with Sage 4.4.4:

```
sage: var('a6,a5,a4,x')
(a6, a5, a4, x)
sage: e=15*a6*x^2 + 5*a5*x + a4
sage: e.roots(x)
[(-1/30*(sqrt(-12*a4*a6 + 5*a5^2)*sqrt(5) + 5*a5)/a6, 1), (1/30*(sqrt(-12*a4*a6 + 5*a5^2)*sqrt(5) - 5*a5)/a6, 1)]
```
This is fine. However:

```
sage: var('f6,f5,f4,x')
(f6, f5, f4, x)
sage: e=15*f6*x^2 + 5*f5*x + f4
sage: e.roots(x)
[(1/30*(-I*sqrt(35) - 5)/binomial(n, k), 1), (1/30*(I*sqrt(35) - 5)/binomial(n, k), 1)]
```
WTF???

Could you try this again?  After applying #8734 to 4.5.3.alpha0 (and ignoring the patch rejects), I get

```python
sage: var('f6,f5,f4,x')
(f6, f5, f4, x)
sage: e=15*f6*x^2 + 5*f5*x + f4
sage: e.roots(x)
[(-1/30*(sqrt(-12*f4*f6 + 5*f5^2)*sqrt(5) + 5*f5)/f6, 1), (1/30*(sqrt(-12*f4*f6 + 5*f5^2)*sqrt(5) - 5*f5)/f6, 1)]
```

The patch attached to #8734 indeed fixes this problem. However there are simpler solutions, and I'm not convinced that #8734 is necessary, given that #7377 could solve this in a much cleaner way. Also see the discussion linked from [#8734 comment:3](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/8734#comment:3):

http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/67f0a63d00b8d835/06557a921a582f87

In particular, Robert Dodier's suggestion to apply this patch to maxima:

```

I can confirm that adding these lines to `$SAGE_LOCAL/share/maxima/5.20.1/share/contrib/Zeilberger/testZeilberger.mac` solves this issue.

Perhaps this patch is already in a more recent version of maxima?

I confirm that with the #8734 patch applied to 4.5.3 (and ignoring the patch reject) it works
fine.

However I'm convinced by Burcin's argument. I am ready to review a patch based on this patch
applied to Maxima.

> Did I something wrong? How to install the patched spkg?

I don't have any experience with the maxima spkg. I just applied the patch in [attachment:maxima_package.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9538/maxima_package.patch)It works here, but just complains about not being able to build `maxima.fasb`:

```
cp: cannot stat `maxima.fasb': No such file or directory
```

Perhaps someone more knowledgeable can help out. Building maxima as a library is #8645.

I have the same problem with the forthcoming 4.6.alpha2, **if** I've renamed `SAGE_ROOT` since that copy of Sage was first compiled (and another installation with the previous name does not exist).  In this case, even reinstalling the included Maxima, with

 `./sage -f spkg/standard/maxima-5.20.1.p0.spkg`

triggers the behavior.  Paul, did you happen to move or rename your Sage root directory?  Does  Burcin's p1 package install successfully and fix the roots problem with a Sage that has not been moved?

Except for `SAGE_LOCAL/bin`, the files under `SAGE_LOCAL` are not under version control.  I was mainly trying to check whether Robert's fix works with an already installed Maxima in Sage.

So far, it seems the build problem is orthogonal to the problem in the description.

If it is fixed upstream, this doctest should fail:

```
sage: maxima = Maxima(init_code = ['load(simplify_sum)']) 
sage: maxima('f1') 
binomial(n,k) 
```

Then we can remove the line with the `kill` command.

For the record, this fails with maxima-5.22.1:

```

None of the patches from `maxima_package.patch` are in the updated maxima-5.22.1 package. See #10187 for the updated spgk. I take it that this is the expected behaviour and no further patches to maxima are necessary.
