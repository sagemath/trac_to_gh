Aly, would it not have been simpler to move the code of the function lll_reduce(self, points, height_matrix=None) from ell_rational_field to ell_number_field?  That function was written when we only had heights over Q but it does the same thing, essentially.

Apologies if I should have told you about that function earlier...

There may well be other functions which can similarly be moved up;  someone should go systematically through ell_rational_field functions to see which others there are.

On your patch, I see the following:  (1) no tests over fields other than Q; (2) in defining E why not just E=self?;  (3) better to use the pari library than the gp interface (when there's a choice).  Otherwise it applies and builds fine.

Knowing about the lll_reduce function and finally getting back to this ticket, I've just created a patch which simply moves the function lll_reduce to ell_number_field.  I've also included doctests over quadratic number fields.  

One note, this code isn't very robust.  For example, in many cases the height pairing matrix is *not* positive definite.  In this case 
"the output depends on the undocumented behaviour of PARI's ``lllgram()``  function", which means there is a divide by zero error.  Here's an example:

```
            sage: Qrt5.<rt5>=NumberField(x^2-5)
            sage: E = EllipticCurve([0,5-rt5,0,rt5,0])
            sage: QuadraticForm(E.height_pairing_matrix(E.gens())).is_positive_definite()
            False
            sage: E.lll_reduce(E.gens())
            Exception raised:
            Traceback (most recent call last):

all doctests pass on top of sage-4.8.alpha6.

However I suggest adding an example checking the relation between the input points, `newpoints`
and the output matrix `U`:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve([0, 1, 1, -2, 42])
sage: Pi = E.gens()
sage: Qi, U = E.lll_reduce(Pi)
sage: all(sum(U[i,j]*Pi[i] for i in range(4)) == Qi[j] for j in range(4))
True
```

And please add an example where an `height_matrix` is given, for example
(this also gives an example where the precision matters):

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve([0, 1, 1, -2, 42])
sage: Pi = E.gens()
sage: H=E.height_pairing_matrix(Pi,3)
sage: E.lll_reduce(Pi,height_matrix=H)
([(-4 : 1 : 1), (-3 : 5 : 1), (-2 : 6 : 1), (1 : -7 : 1)], [1 0 0 1]
[0 1 0 1]
[0 0 0 1]
[0 0 1 1])
```

Also, I guess "number of bits of precision of result" should read "number of bits of precision of intermediate computations" (in fact the precision of the height matrix computation, which is
given as input to Pari).

Paul

PS: the doctest coverage could be 100% if we could remove the deprecate function
`local_information`. Can this be done?

looks good to me.

I have made a review patch, mainly about details of the doc, but also removing the deprecated function `local_information`.

If the minor changes in my review patch are ok, this can be set to positive review
