Helloooooooo !!!

Well, it seemed fuxxy it my mind last time I had a look at it, and it may have been because I was trying to understand how your data structure worked.... Knowing this, I opened it again today and it seemed crystal clear `:-)`

I changed nothing since the last version of my patch, short of a new doctest in the method computing the polynomials of the complete graph, using the formula given at

http://mathworld.wolfram.com/MatchingPolynomial.html

If anybody can review my patch, this ticket is good to go !
