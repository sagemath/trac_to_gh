Right now, setting SAGE_CHECK to any nonempty string (e.g., "no") runs the test suite.  The documentation actually says that SAGE_CHECK should be "yes" for this to happen.  Fix this.

While we're at it, fix something else: in the script SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/sage-env, SAGE64 is required to be "yes", "no", or unset:

```
if [ "$SAGE64" != "yes" -a "$SAGE64" != "no" ]; then
    echo "The environment variable SAGE64 (=$SAGE64) must be either unset, yes or no."
    exit 1
fi
```
The problem is, whenever sage-env is run, output is redirected to /dev/null, so this error message isn't printed.  So for example:

```
$ export SAGE64='maybe'
$ sage
$
```
Sage fails to run and is completely silent as to why.  Fix this, too.  

---

Also, due to a bug in `sage-spkg`, successful test suite runs never get logged in `spkg/installed/<package-name>` as they should (or is intended); this is fixed by the reviewer patch.

(Note that test suite **failures** cannot be logged in these files as they get deleted on non-successful builds, which [currently] includes successful builds with failing self-tests.)

I commented on this *somewhere* where I uploaded the "first aid" patch for spaces in `SAGE_ROOT`.

Redirecting the output of `sage-env` is really bad, and the test of `$?` is almost useless, since `sage-env` is (and must be) sourced, so it must not `exit` [some value].

The `SAGE_CHECK` issue (interpreting everything except "no" as "yes") is AFAIK a historical relict; some spkgs might still run the test suite from `spkg-install` if `SAGE_CHECK` is set and set to anything but "no".

Replacing every occurrence of `exit` in `sage-env` by `return` should work (then testing `$?` makes sense); I wonder why Sage is started even if `sage-env` failed though. (I think *there* an `exit 1` is missing.)

And we should quote all occurrences of `SAGE_ROOT`...

When do you see Sage starting if sage-env fails?

I'll also take a look at #9644.  If I can give that a positive review, I'll change the patch here to make it depend on #9644.  (I may do that anyway...)  As far as changing sage-build to source sage-env, could that break things?  The other changes here are pretty inocuous.

My bad. I think this happened *after* I had replaced `exit` by `return` in `sage-env` (screen buffer):

```

(But the same happens if `source` itself fails, e.g. because `sage-env` isn't found, likewise when `SAGE_ROOT` contains spaces.)

But if the error message ever gets printed, Sage shouldn't start. We currently have:

```sh
. $SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/sage-env   1>/dev/null 2>/dev/null

if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
   echo "Error setting environment variables by running $SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/sage-env; possibly cont
act sage-devel (see http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel)."
fi

...

sage() {
    sage_setup
    sage-ipython "$@" -i
}

if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
    sage
    exit $?
fi

```


> As far as changing sage-build to source sage-env, could that break things?  The other changes here are pretty inocuous.


I guess that's just an old flaw; calling it is of little use (will only *check* some things, but doesn't change the environment at all).

So give it a try and see what happens... ;-)

(It *shouldn't*<sup>TM</sup> break anything.)

It's different for a variable like $FOOBAR, where you don't know if it might have a space or not. \n\nTo my knowledge there's nothing in Sage which checks if SAGE64 is \"no\".

> I'll also take a look at #9644.  If I can give that a positive review, I'll change the patch here to make it depend on #9644.  (I may do that anyway...)  As far as changing sage-build to source sage-env, could that break things?  The other changes here are pretty inocuous.


I agree. 

John's changes are safe - the others may be desirable, but introduce extra risk. It would be a shame if this change got bounced out because larger changes were added to the ticket. Leif can always create another ticket to fix the other issues. 

I'm keen we improve the code in Sage, but I don't think making lots of changes to a package every time someone wants to make a minor change, is a good idea. Leif knows I was pulling my hair out when all I wanted to do was get iconv to build on HP-UX on #9603. 

One point John, if you do change this patch, there's no need to quote xyes. Since you are absolutely 100% sure that the string xyes has no spaces in it, there's no need to quote it. It's different for a variable like $FOOBAR, where you don't know if it might have a space or not. 

To my knowledge there's nothing in Sage which checks if SAGE64 is "no". The only value actually tested for is "yes", so it's a bit pointless permitting "no".

There are already other tickets around touching at least some of the patched files, too.

I'd say adding the quotes around `SAGE_ROOT`, adding the `exit 1` if sourcing failed, and perhaps replacing `exit` by `return` in `sage-env` should be mandatory.

If we always postpone fixes, we'll never get far (and if one opens a new ticket for every "minor" thing at all, we'll most probably just increase the number of open tickets, with lots of rebasing being necessary if some of them finally get merged).

Just my 2 cents.

John has kindly picked up on something that's not hurting his work, but he knows is wrong. Make it too difficult, and people will in general just give up and not bother with such tickets any more. 

There's nothing wrong with having a cleanup ticket, where you can make all the changes you want - for example the Cliquer one #9870.

Replacing `exit` by `return` adds no risk if we **do** exit when `$? -ne 0`.

Note that John's initial patch also did more than necessary for the ticket (or announced by its title).

So IMHO one should either do just what's necessary to address a specific issue (and not touch other files), or do "the whole", i.e. fix most of the open issues with the files you touch, at least the "trivial" ones that do not require extraordinary testing (e.g. on all platforms).

There's e.g. still

```sh
   cd "$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/sage"
   echo "*** TOUCHING ALL CYTHON (.pyx) FILES ***"
   touch */*.pyx */*/*.pyx */*/*/*.pyx */*/*/*/*.pyx */*/*/*/*/*.pyx */*/*/*/*/*.pyx  */*/*/*/*/*/*.
pyx 2> /dev/null
```
in `sage-build`, too. (Count the asterisks!)

Yes, every. If you exit in a sourced file, the sourcing shell exits.

(We should then test the return code when/whereever `sage-env` is sourced.)

The `sage-check-64` script is a bit funny...

We should echo *warning and error messages* in `sage-env` to `stderr`, then we can redirect `stdout` ("informative" messages) to `/dev/null` in the usual case.

> Output from it is not suppressed in sage-build.  Perhaps the right place to print this message would be somewhere in sage-spkg?


`sage -b` doesn't call `sage-spkg`. We could call `sage-check-64` there, though its use isn't very clear. I either set `SAGE64` or leave it; I don't think there needs to be some extra file which sets it if it ever has been set before. Perhaps Dave can explain the use of that.

I've attached a patch to `sage-spkg` to apply on top of John's:
* Quotes more environment variables.
* Checks return code of `sage-env` and exits with an error message if non-zero.
* Fixes successful test suite runs never getting logged.
* Corrects one comment, adds some more (including on what could further be fixed on another ticket).

Sorry, just noticed the patch's name is wrong (patches `sage-spkg`, not `sage-sage`).

The only side-effect of *sourcing* `sage-env` twice is that some variables (e.g. `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`) get redundant entries.

We *could* in principle prevent such by an 

```C

analogon. But IMHO a minor issue...

I didn't plan that; therefore I've also added comments on what has to get fixed on follow-up tickets.

Testing the "exit" code of `sage-env` had become necessary because of the other patch.

I've now also attached a rebased version of my "reviewer" patch, with some more changes:

*Besides cosmetic changes (formatting, tabs, some messages), I've only*

* *added lots of comments (including TODOs/notes on future changes),*
* *quoted all necessary environment variables,*
* ''fixed a bug which caused a successful test suite run never getting
  logged (to 'spkg/installed/<package-name>').''

*So there are (still) lots of things to do, but on another ticket.*

I can of course only review John's changes (which I already did, leading to my reviewer patch, so I'm in principle ok with his changes, although I haven't tested them recently); so someone else has to review mine. (I'm going to test them with 4.6.1.rc0 again though I don't expect new, undesired behavior.)

Additional changes (other than fixes of possible mistakes introduced here) should IMHO be made on follow-up tickets; as mentioned in the commit message (and comments in `sage-spkg`), there are quite a lot things to get fixed or improved.

P.S.:

* The odd messages from `sage-check-64` when sourcing `sage-env` are already addressed elsewhere (#10303, which unfortunately had to get unmerged from rc0), so John's patch *here* intentionally (still) *does* suppress *all* messages from the former in `sage-env`, as a *temporary* solution.

* (Not) sourcing `sage-env` more than once is addressed at #10469.

* The only scripts directly sourcing `sage-env` are `sage-sage` and `sage-spkg` (both patched here to check its "exit" code), so the changes turning `exit` into `return` there are safe.

Five months ago I wrote the above comment. I could see that if we were not careful, the ticket would drag on, as more and more changes were requested that had nothing to do solving the problem raised. 

John's changes did the job and were not risky. Now the ticket has dragged on and on, with endless other changes, but still no positive review.

And there was me thinking a very small patch John submitted 6 months ago was finally going to be merged!

I think Leif should **seriously** consider the implications of the endless changes he wants on tickets like this one - changes that are not related to the problem the ticket is supposed to address. 

In many ways I wish all sage developers were as fussy as Leif, as his approach does generally result in improved quality of code. Many of the bugs in Sage would not be there if more people were fussy about code that is written. I cringe at some of the stuff I see written. But Leif's endless requested changes are slowing Sage development to a crawl. 

#9603 took a couple of months to get a positive review on what was originally a 3 or 4 line patch that was only applied on AIX. 

The cliquer package is a complete mess, so I opened a ticket to clean it up (#9870), and another (#9871) to address an important single issue for a 64-bit Solaris port. The latter took ages, due to unrelated changes requested by Leif. Then Leif decided to take ownership of the cleanup patch (#9870), but has done nothing about it in 7 months, despite a couple of reminders from me. 

Not only do these endless changes take longer to implement for the author, but it makes review so much more difficult. Whereas I would have been happy to give a positive review to John's original patch, this has become so complex it is a nightmare reviewing it.

Correction, #9603 was only applied on HP-UX. The point being a *safe* change, that was only intended to effect Sage on an unsupported platform became overly complex and dragged on for a long time. 

IMHO, this sort of thing needs to stop.

My build completed just fine.  I just tried again: I took a vanilla copy of 4.7.alpha2, applied this patch, ran "sage -sdist ...", and then built from the resulting tar file.  It has started just fine, successfully installing sage_scripts and 40 more spkgs.  The build is still ongoing, but I'm not seeing the error you saw.

Since you're not sure that this patch caused it, what can I do to help resolve this?
