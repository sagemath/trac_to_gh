CC:  @JohnCremona @kcrisman @qed777 @categorie

Due to #9330, some doctests have to be adapted (and also the documentation), simply by changing *Shafarevich-Tate* to *Tate-Shafarevich*, which is now consistently used as the group's name.

I've **not** changed the name in the references' titles of course.

## Note to the release manager

Apply **both** patches (to the Sage library).

Ooops, some kind of "recursive" doctest failure? I must have tested just those files that *previously* failed.

I can upload a second patch for that, too, which in addition fixes one occurrence (documentation only) in `.../elliptic_curves/padic_lseries.py` as well.

Just let me know if you already fixed that elsewhere.

? What do you think mine came from? ;-) Or did you mean the **absent reviewers**?
