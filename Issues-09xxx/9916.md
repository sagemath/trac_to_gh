Due to #9330, some doctests have to be adapted (and also the documentation), simply by changing *Shafarevich-Tate* to *Tate-Shafarevich*, which is now consistently used as the group's name.

I've **not** changed the name in the references' titles of course.

Ooops, some kind of "recursive" doctest failure? I must have tested just those files that *previously* failed.

I can upload a second patch for that, too, which in addition fixes one occurrence (documentation only) in `.../elliptic_curves/padic_lseries.py` as well.

Just let me know if you already fixed that elsewhere.

(I've seen those stack warnings before, but only when a doctest fails IIRC.)

? What do you think mine came from? ;-) Or did you mean the **absent reviewers**?

(Cron ignores "README_first"...)

So I'll upload a second patch in a few seconds.

For what it's worth: I was aware of the doctest errors here and that at #9924, when I merged their "parent" tickets into a trial 4.6.alpha1.  Were it not for the more serious build errors caused by #9733 and #4000, I would have announced this as alpha1 on sage-release with links to new tickets for known problems.
