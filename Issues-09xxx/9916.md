Due to #9330, some doctests have to be adapted (and also the documentation), simply by changing *Shafarevich-Tate* to *Tate-Shafarevich*, which is now consistently used as the group's name.

I've **not** changed the name in the references' titles of course.

Just let me know if you already fixed that elsewhere.

? What do you think mine came from? ;-) Or did you mean the **absent reviewers**?

(Cron ignores "README_first"...)

<a id='comment:19'></a>For what it's worth: I was aware of the doctest errors here and that at #9924, when I merged their "parent" tickets into a trial 4.6.alpha1.
