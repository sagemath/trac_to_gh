lcalc works fine for the zeta function on cygwin, evidently:

```
sage: time lcalc.zeros(4)
CPU times: user 0.00 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.00 s
Wall time: 0.19 s
[14.1347251, 21.0220396, 25.0108576, 30.4248761]
```

However, it doesn't work for computing with elliptic curves:

```
sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/lfunctions/lcalc.py"              
  ***   not enough memory
