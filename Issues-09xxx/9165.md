lcalc works fine for the zeta function on cygwin, evidently:

```
sage: time lcalc.zeros(4)
CPU times: user 0.00 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.00 s
Wall time: 0.19 s
[14.1347251, 21.0220396, 25.0108576, 30.4248761]
```

However, it doesn't work for computing with elliptic curves:

```
sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/lfunctions/lcalc.py"

These both pass and work "by hand" on XP now.  I do get warnings about the new stack size, which keeps going down from 1 MB to .981, .957, .955 with these commands, but they do *work* (as does the one in line.py) so I would suggest a different ticket for handling the stack on Cygwin.

JP, can you confirm these pass on Win 7?  Then we should be set.
