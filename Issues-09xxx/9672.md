```
Two easy improvements can be made to `Graph.genus`:

* When computing local orbit structure of face map, don't compute the entire orbits.
* Compute blocks and cut vertices, embed the individual blocks, and reconstruct them if the user wants the embedding.

Nathann,

There's a forthcoming writeup about how this algorithm works.  Robert Miller understands how it works, though we haven't had a chance to chat about this patch yet.  Either I'll get Robert to review this, or finish the writeup.  I'm more tempted to have Robert review this, since I don't believe the algorithm is novel enough to publish.
