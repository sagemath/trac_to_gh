I've attached a new `deps` and `deps.diff`.

I'm not sure whether to put Leif or Martin as the author, or both Leif and Martin.  Can someone please update the field?

Replying to [@qed777](#comment%3A1):
> I'm not sure whether to put Leif or Martin as the author, or both Leif and Martin.  Can someone please update the field?

Can you update the *"Reported by:"* field? ;-)

From PolyBoRi's `SPKG.txt`:

```
...

== Dependencies ==

 * Python
 * Scons
 * Boost
 * gd (FIXME/TODO: should be added to deps, I think. Leif, 2010-07-10)
 * M4RI/libm4ri (already included in deps)
 * png/libpng12 (accomplished because Python and gd depend on it, too)
 * libz         (accomplished because e.g. libpng depends on it)

...
```

I must admit I did not check *all* transitive dependencies, i.e. if some package that PolyBoRi (indirectly) depends on pulls in the GD dependency. Anyway, I think it's always better to add an explicit, perhaps "redundant" dependency rather than to omit it, (not only) since the deps of other packages might change over the time. (Same for explicitly linking against libraries directly used despite other used libraries - *currently* - already doing so.)

The only package in `standard/deps` that's listed to **directly** depend on GD is `gdmodule`, which in turn is only listed as a (direct) dependency of MatPlotLib (and the Sage library).

I'm pretty sure it's just good luck this ever worked. GD is one of the "early" packages, and all of these take little time to build.

I'll perhaps verify that later by forcing GD to be built very late.
