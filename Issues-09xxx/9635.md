```
sage: (n,k,j)=var('n,k,j')
sage: sum(binomial(n,k)*binomial(k-1,j)*(-1)**(k-1-j),k,j+1,n)
0
sage: (n,j)=(5,3)
sage: sum(binomial(n,k)*binomial(k-1,j)*(-1)**(k-1-j) for k in range(j
+1,n+1))
1 
```
The above sum should be 1 for n>=j and 0 otherwise.

From kcrisman:
This appears to be a bug in Maxima.

The [bug report](http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3036579&group_id=4933&atid=104933) got updated over a year ago.

In the current Sage:

```
(%i1) load(simplify_sum); 
(%o1) /Users/karl-dietercrisman/Downloads/sage-5.0/local/share/maxima/5.26.0/s\
hare/contrib/solve_rec/simplify_sum.mac
(%i2) simplify_sum(sum(binomial(n,k)*binomial(k-1,j)*(-1)**(k-1-j),k,j +1,n)); 

Is  j + 1  positive, negative, or zero?

pos;
(%o2)                                  1
```
So just need a doctest.

```
sage: (n,k,j)=var('n,k,j')
sage: sum(binomial(n,k)*binomial(k-1,j)*(-1)**(k-1-j),k,j+1,n)
-sum((-1)^(-j + k)*binomial(k - 1, j)*binomial(n, k), k, j + 1, n)
sage: assume(j>-1)
sage: sum(binomial(n,k)*binomial(k-1,j)*(-1)**(k-1-j),k,j+1,n)
1
sage: forget()
sage: assume(n>=j)
sage: sum(binomial(n,k)*binomial(k-1,j)*(-1)**(k-1-j),k,j+1,n)
-sum((-1)^(-j + k)*binomial(k - 1, j)*binomial(n, k), k, j + 1, n)
sage: forget()
sage: assume(j==-1)
sage: sum(binomial(n,k)*binomial(k-1,j)*(-1)**(k-1-j),k,j+1,n)
1
sage: forget()
sage: assume(j<-1)
sage: sum(binomial(n,k)*binomial(k-1,j)*(-1)**(k-1-j),k,j+1,n)
-sum((-1)^(-j + k)*binomial(k - 1, j)*binomial(n, k), k, j + 1, n)
```
Was the original report here wrong?  Maxima currently says that the sign of `j+1` is all that matters, which sort of makes sense
