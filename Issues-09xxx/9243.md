<div id="comment:0"></div>

Right now, sage-doctest uses these return codes:

```
# Return value in process exit code:
# 0: all tests passed
# 1: file not found
# 2: KeyboardInterrupt
# 3: doctest process was terminated by a signal
# 4: the doctesting framework raised an exception
# 100: failed doctests
```
In #8641 and #9224, we make sure that the return code gets passed on to the user, and for multiple files, we `or' the return codes together. It would be much nicer for the user if we used powers of 2 for return codes, so that it's easy to see exactly what happened. 

I recommend we change 3->4, 4->8, and 100->128 in sage-doctest.

Thanks for adding me to CC.

I like this patch. There's one more instance, though: test_file in sage-ptest uses 5 as its own internal error code for unhandled exception. We should probably change that to 32. (And keep that one reserved.)

If #9316 is rebased on top of this one (which I can do), it will use error code 64 for timeouts.

All 8 available bits are then in use, so if we want to add more error conditions after that, we'll have to re-think this, or merge some error flags together.


Meta-comment: there are now three doctest related patches that I'm aware of, and that should probably all be merged. I would suggest this order: #9243, #9316, #8641.
