At [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/c008a74ae2b3af95), I reported the following problem.

- Take a folder with many uncommitted changes in a Mercurial repository. [Example](http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&q=http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/SimonKing/Cohomology/p_group_cohomology-2.1.alpha0.tar.gz&usg=AFQjCNE362g2kL77GzI-7T5RaOBx92X0KQ).
- Run `sage -pkg` on it.
- It will hang forever while it is attempted to read from `stderr` of a subprocess.

Mitesh Patel pointed to the solution: One should use `communicate` rather than stdout/stdin/stderr!

I don't know how to doctest the issue; but I have a patch that solves the problem.
