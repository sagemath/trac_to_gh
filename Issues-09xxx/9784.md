If I give the following dictionary to `list_plot`, it seems very obvious what I want it to do:

```
{67: 1770, 52: 2735, 37: 3135, 22: 3365, 72: 1560, 57: 2550, 42: 3020,
27: 3295, 62: 1960, 47: 2880}
```
...especially since list_plot plots functions with a finite domain, and dictionaries in Python are called "mapping types"! We should make `list_plot` be able to deal with dictionaries with numeric keys and values.

Keywords: **list_plot, plotting, dictionaries**

Patch up, please review. One decision I'd like feedback on is sorting the resulting list -- I made it so that it only sorts the list when `plotjoined=True`, but maybe it would be fine to always sort the list?
