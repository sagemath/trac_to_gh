## Build environment
* Sun Ultra 27 3.33 GHz Intel W3580 Xeon. Quad core. 8 threads. 12 GB RAM
* OpenSolaris 2009.06 snv_134 X86
* Sage 4.4.2
* gcc 4.4.4

## How gcc 4.4.4 was configured
Since the configuration of gcc is fairly critical on OpenSolaris, here's how it was built. 

```
drkirkby@hawk:~/sage-4.4.2$ gcc -v
Using built-in specs.
Target: i386-pc-solaris2.11
Configured with: ../gcc-4.4.4/configure --prefix=/usr/local/gcc-4.4.4 --with-as=/usr/local/binutils-2.20/bin/as --with-ld=/usr/ccs/bin/ld --with-gmp=/usr/local --with-mpfr=/usr/local
Thread model: posix
gcc version 4.4.4 (GCC) 
```

gcc 4.3.4 was failing to build iconv.

```

The ECL library is a 64-bit library:

```
drkirkby@hawk:~/sage-4.4.2$ file /export/home/drkirkby/sage-4.4.2/local/lib//libecl.so
/export/home/drkirkby/sage-4.4.2/local/lib//libecl.so:	ELF 64-bit LSB dynamic lib AMD64 Version 1, dynamically linked, not stripped
``` 

but obviously something is wrong. Whether it is an Sage, ECL or Maxima issue I don't know.

I've tried that - the same result. 

Googling, I find this error is not specific to ECL or Maxima, but can crop up in all sort of programs. 

http://developers.sun.com/solaris/articles/about_amd64_abi.html

indicates a couple of possible workarounds, but I'm unsure what is the best course of action. I guess building with position independent code might be, as it might hopefully be fairly easy to add -fPIC to the ECL build, though I'll take advice from the ECL developer on that.

I should have added that in order to get ECL to build, I had added the option

```
--with-dffi=no
```

Without that option ECL will not build. With the option, ECL builds ok, but Maxima does not. 

I have tried compiling with position independant code, by adding -fPIC to the CFLAGS, but that did not help.

I'd agree, a lack of R will not affect these results. 

I computed results to 30 digits of precision with Mathematica

```
In[1]:= a=N[Sinh[1],30]   

Out[1]= 1.17520119364380145688238185060

In[2]:= b=N[ArcSinh[1],30]

Out[2]= 0.881373587019543025232609324980
```
That means the absolute error on the expected value is 4.5688e-16 and the absolute error on the Solaris case is -5.43117e-16. I think it's quite reasonable to attribute the `sinh()` case to numerical noise. I need to go out soon, but if you don't beat me to it, I'll open a numerical-noise ticket for this within the next 5 hours. 

The `asinh()` case is not so obvious, as while the actual error is small, the zero is missing from the start on the 64-bit SPARC case, with only `.8813735870195429` instead of `0.8813735870195429`. I find that a bit harder to explain - it is not just a numerical noise issue. Have you any ideas?

I realise this was on fulvia (Solaris 10 x86), not SPARC. Still, the same issues concern arises why does the second test not print the leading zero?
