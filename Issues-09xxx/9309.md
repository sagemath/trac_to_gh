```
The IML library is one of the many standard packages in Sage (see #9281 for a list), which do not have a spkg-check file. This means that if one builds Sage with the environment variable SAGE_CHECK set to "yes", no self-tests of the package will be run. This is silly, as the IML library has a test suite, though it only consists of two tests. 

After adding the required file, the test suite is run.

Obviously this would be out of the ticket's current scope, so we could equally well open a new one for that purpose instead.

<a id='comment:6'></a>At least [IML's home page](http://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~astorjoh/iml.html) has moved (the one in `SPKG.txt` gives a 404). From there:

  What is New?

So perhaps really worth a follow-up ticket... (But we should update the address in `SPKG.txt` *here* I think.)

Martin, what do *you* think?

Leif, 

I copied your changes to SPKG.txt to the package at: 

http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/patches/iml-1.0.1.p13.spkg

I also created #9568 to update the IML library, and improve spkg-install. We should also consider whether that can be built in parallel. Anyway, leave any comments on #9568. 

 == Note to the release managers == 

No patches need to be applied to any other Sage repositories - all changes are merged into the repository. Just replace the current IML package with this one.

http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/patches/iml-1.0.1.p13.spkg
