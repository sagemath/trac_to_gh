```
The IML library is one of the many standard packages in Sage (see #9281 for a list), which do not have a spkg-check file. This means that if one builds Sage with the environment variable SAGE_CHECK set to "yes", no self-tests of the package will be run. This is silly, as the IML library has a test suite, though it only consists of two tests. 

After adding the required file, the test suite is run.

At least [IML's home page](http://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~astorjoh/iml.html) has moved (the one in `SPKG.txt` gives a 404). From there:

  What is New?

* 2008-07-28 The current release is 1.0.3. This version incorporates a new function nullspaceMP into the library interface which computes the right nullspace of an integer matrix filled with GMP bignums.
 
* 2007-09-14 The current release is 1.0.2. This version corrects several bugs.

* 2006-11-26 The current release is 1.0.1. This version corrects several bugs as well as incorporates a new function nullspaceLong into the library interface which computes the right nullspace of an integer matrix with type long.

  [...]

So perhaps really worth a follow-up ticket... (But we should update the address in `SPKG.txt` *here* I think.)

Martin, what do *you* think?

Leif, 

I copied your changes to SPKG.txt to the package at: 

http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/patches/iml-1.0.1.p13.spkg

I also created #9568 to update the IML library, and improve spkg-install. We should also consider whether that can be built in parallel. Anyway, leave any comments on #9568. 

 == Note to the release managers == 

No patches need to be applied to any other Sage repositories - all changes are merged into the repository. Just replace the current IML package with this one.
