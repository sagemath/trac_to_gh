Cliquer failed to install due to a lack of `getopt.h` It can't determine the platform, which probably does not help the situation.

Cannot determine your platform or it is not supported
Since SAGE_PORT is set, setting SAGESOFLAGS to Linux defaults.

It's quite possible that an installation of an AIX fileset would include the file `getopt.h`, but it looks like its a header will should at least consider checking for. However, comments on #9870 suggest we do not need the Cliquer executable (only the libraries), in which case there's no need for `getopt`.

Yes, if we only (properly) build a shared library rather than the executable, we don't need it.

This will some day be fixed by #9870 I guess.

You could nevertheless report this upstream. (I think Cliquer should at least check for the presence of `getopt.h`.)
