Looks like a discrepancy in the order terms are printed.

Acccording to Dan Drake:

```
I'm seeing that on bsd.math too. This is related to #9514, which was
supposed to fix this, but evidently doesn't, on OS X at least.
```

Related: #9514.

If it's producing mathematically equal terms that only print differently, which seems to be the case here, the cause is probably some system dependency in the pynac simplification or printing routines.

Evaluating `cos(x) + zeta(x)` in Sage 4.5.2.alpha0 gives

* `zeta(x) + cos(x)` on sage.math.
* `cos(x) + zeta(x)` on bsd.math.

Is this representative of the underlying problem?

On Sage 4.4.4 on OS X 10.6:

```
sage: cos(x)+zeta(x)
cos(x) + zeta(x)
sage: zeta(x)+cos(x)
cos(x) + zeta(x)

If we decide that the actual problem (different printing across platforms) is not a regression, and doesn't have to be fixed in this release, then I've attached a patch that works around the problem (by modifying the doctest to produce an output that prints the same on my Linux box and on bsd.math).

If you do apply my patch, then either this ticket should not be closed, or another one should be opened about the printing order issue.

Yes, I couldn't see any quick fix which wouldn't effect performance. Ordering of the terms is already a big performance bottleneck in Python. I'd like to fix things properly once instead of adding kludges all around, but I don't have time to do that right now.

I've been sidetracked by other pynac problems since. Sorry for keeping quiet all this time and thanks for your efforts.
