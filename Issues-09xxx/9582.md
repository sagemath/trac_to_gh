Looks like a discrepancy in the order terms are printed.

Acccording to Dan Drake:

```
I'm seeing that on bsd.math too. This is related to #9514, which was
supposed to fix this, but evidently doesn't, on OS X at least.
```

Related: #9514.

Evaluating `cos(x) + zeta(x)` in Sage 4.5.2.alpha0 gives

* `zeta(x) + cos(x)` on sage.math.
* `cos(x) + zeta(x)` on bsd.math.

Is this representative of the underlying problem?

On Sage 4.4.4 on OS X 10.6:

```
sage: cos(x)+zeta(x)
cos(x) + zeta(x)
sage: zeta(x)+cos(x)
cos(x) + zeta(x)
sage: version()
'Sage Version 4.4.4, Release Date: 2010-06-23'

So this may have been a problem for a while?

If you do apply my patch, then either this ticket should not be closed, or another one should be opened about the printing order issue.

Yes, I couldn't see any quick fix which wouldn't effect performance. Ordering of the terms is already a big performance bottleneck in Python. I'd like to fix things properly once instead of adding kludges all around, but I don't have time to do that right now.

I've been sidetracked by other pynac problems since. Sorry for keeping quiet all this time and thanks for your efforts.
