I really have to say: is this example worth it? 

IMHO, the graph editor now shipped with Sage makes this example out of order. Use graph_editor on the chosen graph, and double click on a vertex to delete it, and you're showing the same idea, with a more strightforward interface. 

There are loads of awesome things to do with graphs in Sage. With the new patch #8631, we can do much better than this.
