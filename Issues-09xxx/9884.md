```

sage: S.<x> = PolynomialRing(R)
sage: f = S([R.random_element() for i in range(100)])
sage: timeit("L = f.list()")

That's about 29000 cycles per coefficient conversion. See also #9883.

This is sped up by about a factor of 33 by the patch at #9887.  If that's positively reviewed, I would suggest closing this ticket.

6.2.beta4, on an Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-3320M CPU `@` 2.60GHz:

```
sage: R = Integers(3^20)
sage: S.<x> = PolynomialRing(R)
sage: f = S([R.random_element() for i in range(100)])
sage: timeit("L = f.list()")
625 loops, best of 3: 166 µs per loop
```
So I only get a factor of ~7 wrt the timings reported by David Harvey.

David (Roe), can you please check if you still observe the same speedup or if there has been a regression in the meantime?

Version 7.1.beta3 - Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-4278U CPU `@` 2.60GHz

```
sage: R = Integers(3^20)
sage: S.<x> = PolynomialRing(R)
sage: f = S([R.random_element() for i in range(100)])
sage: timeit("L = f.list()")
625 loops, best of 3: 85.8 µs per loop

```

a bit faster on my slightly faster cpu.

Fast enough?
