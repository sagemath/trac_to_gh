I've tried building the source outside of Sage, both 32 and 64-bit, and neither work. A Google shows using the GNU linker will probably solve it, but that is not an acceptable solution, as the GNU linker will create its own set of problems in other packages. It is better that the issue is resolved properly.

<a id='comment:1'>Comment 1:</a>
This appears to be a bug in gcc 4.3.4. At the suggestion of the iconv developers, I used another version of gcc. I used 4.4.4 which seems to build this ok. 

This ticket can be closed.
