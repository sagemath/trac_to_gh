FreeBSD does not currently have a full C99 libm and therefore also needs cephes.  The attached patch enables cephes on FreeBSD, enables error checking and renames the long double gamma() functions in line with C99.  The latter two components are applicable to Cygwin as well as FreeBSD.

Additional comments for perusal in the future:

A number of areas still need work - in particular some of the cephes self tests have been removed and some of the other self tests fail (at least some of the failures reflect bugs in cephes).  Suitable self-tests and a spkg-check script need to be developed.  It's possible mpfr could be used as a reference library.

Are you sure about this?  Couldn't you link Cephes's `libm` against the system `-lm` (maybe you would have to rename the latter).

It looks like I found the problem.  I was building under a chroot'ed environment.  I have discovered that after I perform the 

```
chroot /usr/jail
```
I need to do

```
sh /etc/rc.d/ldconfig start

It looks like I only need to do this one time.

Regarding testing the cephes library - I don't think it is fair to
expect them to give super accurate answers.  I believe that the linux
library functions will fail in the same way.  Same with OpenBSD.

I have been working with the FreeBSD people to get the C99 math
functions into FreeBSD.  They are remarkably fussy.  I have been working
on the complex arc-trig functions casin(h), cacos(h), catan(h), and I
have written some extremely well tested and verified code which is
listed here: http://www.math.missouri.edu/~stephen/software/#catrig

Nevertheless they still won't commit my programs until I have made some
style corrections, and I don't have time right now to do this.

The only other package I know of that implements these functions well
are the boost libraries.  And even those were buggy (my bug fixes were
recently accepted by them).

Another person is working on clog.  The real part of clog(z) is
particularly hard to implement in the case that |z| is close to one.

The linux and OpenBSD libraries totally disregard the issues that give
rise to the huge errors.

And for casinh and cacosh, even the mpc libraries are badly written in
that their only saving grace is that they keep increasing the number of
internal digits until they are sure that their answer is correct.  (If
you wanted something like 200 bits of accuracy for cacosh, some inputs
can take minutes to compute.)

Anyway, all this is to say that you shouldn't hold the cephes libraries
up to any kind of high standard.  Treat them as work arounds so that
ccosh and such like will actually be compiled into sage on FreeBSD,
rather that the answers should be particularly accurate.

Hopefully that is all we are asking for!  I'm going to change the description to point out that we really just want this.

It still fails with the "complex_bsd.h" no rule message.

I looked at Jeremy's patch, and it seemed to me that it did create math_bsd.h and complex_bsd.h.  For example, it has lines like this:

```
--- cephes-2.8/patches/complex_bsd.h.orig       2010-07-26 08:25:54.654310990 +1000
+++ cephes-2.8/patches/complex_bsd.h    2010-07-26 08:25:54.658310309 +1000
```

This is a diff against a non-existent file, using the "-N" option to diff.  The patch program creates a new file.

Makefile then copies this from cephes-2.8/patches to where-ever it is needed.  I would probably change the patch so that it is created directly in the directory where it is needed.

Everything is hopefully fine now.

I've slightly modified Jeremy's approach to create (or rather modify as far as complex.h is concerned) the various headers while patching the src dir, rather than overwriting them with Makefile rules.

FreeBSD's math library does not have all the mathematics functions described in Sections 7.3 and 7.12 of the C99 standard:

```
http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1124.pdf
```
Specifically many of the complex and long double functions are missing in FreeBSD.

Cephes provides those functions that are missing from FreeBSD.  The Makefiles have been modified so that it only adds those functions missing from the version of FreeBSD in which compilation is taking place.
