A participant in the PREP program noticed that mod is not a symbolic function:

```

Hopefully it should be easy to wrap mod in a symbolic function, something like:

```
sage: def eval_mod(self, x):
....:     if isinstance(x, (int, Integer)):
....:         return mod(x,5)
....:     return None
....:
sage: f=function('f', eval_func=eval_mod)
sage: f(x)
f(x)
sage: f(13)
3
sage: f(x^2+x+1)
f(x^2 + x + 1)
sage: f(x^2+x+1).subs(x=2)
2
sage: f(x^2+x+1).subs(x=3)
3
sage: f(x^2+x^3).subs(x=1)
2
sage: f(x^2+x^3).subs(x=2)
2
sage: f(x^2+x^3).subs(x=3)
1 
```

We still don't have a good "mod".
I would suspect that this has been discussed at length in the past years.

I'm bringing this up because I'm in need of periodic piecewise functions (#21215). Using a suitable symbolic mod would be one way. 
On Mathematica, using their 3-argument Mod function seems to be the standard way for defining periodic piecewise functions - see for example here: http://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/156025
We could to the same (one possible route).
