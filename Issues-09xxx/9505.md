The following is ok:

```
sage: var('x,y,z')
sage: f=x*y*z^2
sage: f.coeff(z^2)
x*y

However the following is not:

```
sage: f.coeff(x*y)
0

I'm switching the component to `symbolics` since the problem involves symbolic expressions.

It seems that we inherited this behavior from GiNaC:

```

> f = x*y*z^2;
y*z^2*x
> coeff(f, z^2,1);

```

I will report this to the ginac-list.

Since I don't know how to fix this, at least I can point out some related facts.

Maxima does exactly the same thing as GINAC (and Sage):

```
sage: !maxima
;;; Loading #P"/Users/wstein/sage/install/sage-5.0.beta2/local/lib/ecl/sb-bsd-sockets.fas"
;;; Loading #P"/Users/wstein/sage/install/sage-5.0.beta2/local/lib/ecl/sockets.fas"
;;; Loading #P"/Users/wstein/sage/install/sage-5.0.beta2/local/lib/ecl/defsystem.fas"
;;; Loading #P"/Users/wstein/sage/install/sage-5.0.beta2/local/lib/ecl/cmp.fas"
Maxima 5.24.0 http://maxima.sourceforge.net
using Lisp ECL 11.1.1
Distributed under the GNU Public License. See the file COPYING.
Dedicated to the memory of William Schelter.
The function bug_report() provides bug reporting information.
(%i1) f : x*y*z;
(%o1)                                x y z
(%i2) coeff(f, x);
(%o2)                                 y z
(%i3) coeff(f, x*y);
(%o3)                                  0
```

Maple raises an error in this case:

```
> f := x*y*z 
> ;
                                                                     f := x y z

> coeff(f, x);
                                                                         y z

> coeff(f, x*y);
Error, invalid input: coeff received x*y, which is not valid for its 2nd argument, x
```

Mathematica does what you expect:

```
In[1]:= f := x*y*z;

In[2]:= Coefficient[f,x] 

Out[2]= y z

In[3]:= Coefficient[f,x*y]

Out[3]= z
```

Sage multivariate polynomials (hence Singular) do what you expect:

```
sage: R.<x,y,z>=QQ[]
sage: f = x*y*z^2
sage: f.coefficient(x)
y*z^2
sage: f.coefficient(x*y)
z^2
```

We might need to expand the expression before doing recursive calls to `coefficient()`:

```
sage: var('x,y,z')
(x, y, z)
sage: g = x*y*(z^2 + y*z)
sage: g.coeff(x,1).coeff(y,1)
z
```

Compare to MMA:

```
In[12]:= Coefficient[x*y*(z^2 + y*z), x*y]

          2
Out[12]= z

```

**Attachment:** [trac_9505.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9505/trac_9505.patch.gz)

attached is a temporary fix that calls coeff in turn for each term `x^n` in `s`.
In addition it checks the extra argument `n` is only used for a single symbol.
