The following is ok:

```
sage: var('x,y,z')
sage: f=x*y*z^2
sage: f.coeff(z^2)
x*y
```
However the following is not:

```
sage: f.coeff(x*y)
0
```

It seems that we inherited this behavior from GiNaC:

I will report this to the ginac-list.

<a id='comment:4'></a>Since I don't know how to fix this, at least I can point out some related facts.

Maxima does exactly the same thing as GINAC (and Sage):

```
sage: !maxima
;;; Loading #P"/Users/wstein/sage/install/sage-5.0.beta2/local/lib/ecl/sb-bsd-sockets.fas"

Dedicated to the memory of William Schelter.
The function bug_report() provides bug reporting information.
(%i1) f : x*y*z;
(%o1)                                x y z
(%i2) coeff(f, x);
(%o2)                                 y z
(%i3) coeff(f, x*y);
(%o3)                                  0
```

Maple raises an error in this case:

```
> f := x*y*z 
> ;
                                                                     f := x y z

> coeff(f, x);
                                                                         y z

> coeff(f, x*y);
Error, invalid input: coeff received x*y, which is not valid for its 2nd argument, x
```

Mathematica does what you expect:

```
In[1]:= f := x*y*z;

In[2]:= Coefficient[f,x] 

Out[2]= y z

In[3]:= Coefficient[f,x*y]

Out[3]= z
```

Sage multivariate polynomials (hence Singular) do what you expect:

```
sage: R.<x,y,z>=QQ[]
sage: f = x*y*z^2
sage: f.coefficient(x)
y*z^2
sage: f.coefficient(x*y)
z^2
```

attached is a temporary fix that calls coeff in turn for each term `x^n` in `s`.
In addition it checks the extra argument `n` is only used for a single symbol.
