Probably I used E.gens() which is a bad idea in odctests, better to enter the points manually.

No time to fix now, about to leave SD22 for home.... but thanks all the same!  Put this patch up from a coffee shop last night just before it closed (about a dozen Sagers being chased out!)

`@`cremona: You did you E.gens().  I get:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve('389a1')
sage: E.gens()
[(-1 : 1 : 1), (0 : -1 : 1)]
```

Should I change the doc test to the following?

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve('389a1')
sage: P,Q = E.point([-1,1,1]),E.point([0,-1,1])
sage: E.height_pairing_matrix([P,Q])
[0.686667083305587 0.268478098806726]
