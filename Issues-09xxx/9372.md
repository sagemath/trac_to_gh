<a id='comment:5'></a>`@`cremona: You did you E.gens().  I get:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve('389a1')
sage: E.gens()
[(-1 : 1 : 1), (0 : -1 : 1)]
```

Should I change the doc test to the following?

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve('389a1')
sage: P,Q = E.point([-1,1,1]),E.point([0,-1,1])
sage: E.height_pairing_matrix([P,Q])
