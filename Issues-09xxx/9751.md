When addition_table() was added to `AdditiveMagmas` there were scant examples of additive structures with finite closed subsets.  So there was (temporarily) very little documentation.

With the addition of integers mod n to the category framework in ticket #8562, we can document and test some additive structures.  This patch is all documentation - no code, and modeled after the documentation for multiplication_table() for `Magmas`.

This patch contains a very nice documentation page and that would be a shame not including it into sage. Ready to go.
