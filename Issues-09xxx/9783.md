Patch:

1) Adds the modules for additive abelian groups to the documentation, which builds just fine.

2) Some minor touchups and additions to the documentation.

3) I removed the note about the output format, as this seems to have been fixed.

4) I added some doctests about creating elements, since this had me very confused when I created #9695.
