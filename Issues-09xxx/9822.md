With just my part of the patch, I see a cookie_test_8000 and a nb_session_8000 cookie.  So apparently the problem is that after the patch above, we have a cookie_test_80 cookie.

Yes, please!  I've been avoiding using Sage this semester (other than for me personally) some because the cookie issue just seems to have gotten worse...

Thanks!  I may well take a break after 4.6 is out.

I'll try to reply soon on sage-devel about the possibility of waiting longer for 4.6.alpha2 or adding an alpha3.

Right now, I need to investigate a potential problem with current trial alpha2.  The current merge script is [here](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/release/sage-4.6.alpha2/merger-4.6.alpha2).
