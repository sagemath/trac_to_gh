It is insecure to let any site under the domain to access the cookie (cross-site scripting). I've made the port 443 if the notebook is secure. It also poses a problem if (in the admittedly rare case) the user decides to forward several ports to one notebook server.

`getHeader()` returns None if the header is not found, so it works either way.

In Firebug, I see I have two cookies: cookie_test_80, and nb_session_8000.  That looks wrong, doesn't it?

When I delete all of my cookies from that server, I still can't log in (same error).  After the error page comes up, and I click "Continue", I see the cookie_test_80 cookie show up in FireCookies.

Can we split this ticket into two tickets?  A very high priority one that fixes the bug I found (my fix has been working for the past couple of months for me), and another ticket which takes care of the other issues?  That way the checking-only-last-cookie error can be taken care of right away.

Yes, please!  I've been avoiding using Sage this semester (other than for me personally) some because the cookie issue just seems to have gotten worse...

Thanks!  I may well take a break after 4.6 is out.

I'll try to reply soon on sage-devel about the possibility of waiting longer for 4.6.alpha2 or adding an alpha3.

Right now, I need to investigate a potential problem with current trial alpha2.  The current merge script is [here](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/release/sage-4.6.alpha2/merger-4.6.alpha2).
