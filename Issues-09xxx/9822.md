Thanks!  I may well take a break after 4.6 is out.

I'll try to reply soon on sage-devel about the possibility of waiting longer for 4.6.alpha2 or adding an alpha3.

Right now, I need to investigate a potential problem with current trial alpha2.  The current merge script is [here](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/release/sage-4.6.alpha2/merger-4.6.alpha2).
