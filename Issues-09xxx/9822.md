It is insecure to let any site under the domain to access the cookie (cross-site scripting). I've made the port 443 if the notebook is secure. It also poses a problem if (in the admittedly rare case) the user decides to forward several ports to one notebook server.

`getHeader()` returns None if the header is not found, so it works either way.

Thanks!  I may well take a break after 4.6 is out.

I'll try to reply soon on sage-devel about the possibility of waiting longer for 4.6.alpha2 or adding an alpha3.

Right now, I need to investigate a potential problem with current trial alpha2.  The current merge script is [here](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/release/sage-4.6.alpha2/merger-4.6.alpha2).
