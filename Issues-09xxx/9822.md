> Can we split this ticket into two tickets?  A very high priority one that fixes the bug I found (my fix has been working for the past couple of months for me), and another ticket which takes care of the other issues?  That way the checking-only-last-cookie error can be taken care of right away.


Yes, please!  I've been avoiding using Sage this semester (other than for me personally) some because the cookie issue just seems to have gotten worse...

I think we should get this and the currently positively reviewed SageNB tickets at {32} into a new SageNB 0.8.3.

But I can't work on this now, as I'm a bit busy with getting 4.6.alpha2 ready to release and working on #3524.  That will put the 4.6 cycle in feature freeze, so it's likely that the new Cython, NumPy, Pynac, SageNB, and SciPy packages will have to wait for 4.6.1.

Thanks!  I may well take a break after 4.6 is out.

I'll try to reply soon on sage-devel about the possibility of waiting longer for 4.6.alpha2 or adding an alpha3.

Right now, I need to investigate a potential problem with current trial alpha2.  The current merge script is [here](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/release/sage-4.6.alpha2/merger-4.6.alpha2).
