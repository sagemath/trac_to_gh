I get the following error message in the log of my notebook when I try to show a 3d plot with jmol:

```
script compiler ERROR: se esperaba una instrucción
----line 1 command 1 of /home/admin/0/cells/30/sage0-size500.jmol?1278886612:
          >>>> <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN"> <<<<

----line 1 command 1:
         script >> "/home/admin/0/cells/30/sage0-size500.jmol?1278886612" <<
```

Jmol loads, and shows a black screen instead of the actual plot.

If I try the exact same plot in the cells in the reference manual, the plot shows perfectly and no error message appears in the log.

This seems to me rather like the opposite to #3167 in which things worked fine in the notebook but not in the help

<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

It may be important to mention that the following command does not popup a jmol window in the command line:

```
sage: a=point3d([0,0,0])
sage: a.show()
```

But, if I use:

```
sage: a.export_jmol('/home/oscar/point')
```

a zip file containing a SCRIPT file appears there, and I can use:

```
sage: !java -jar /home/cwitty/sage-4.4.4/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sagenb-0.8-py2.6.egg/sagenb/data/jmol/Jmol.jar}}}

to make jmol open in my desktop, and I can then use it to open the SCRIPT file, and it shows the point just fine.

Oscar, can you verify whether this is still happening for you?   Given how much the notebook has changed in the meantime it might be hard to track this down, and it looks like something akin to #3167 [is back](https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/issues/179).  I think this would be worth closing unless we have more information.
