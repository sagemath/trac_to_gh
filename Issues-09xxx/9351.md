The prerequisites (given in spkg/standard/deps)  for building the sagetex package are just python, but if you build Sage with SAGE_CHECK="yes", then it tries to run the test suite for sagetex, which requires that all of Sage be installed.  This will fail unless you get lucky and sagetex is installed after Sage. With the new parallel spkg building (#8306), I frequently see sagetex built before Sage.

To fix this, let's make gap a prerequisite for sagetex.  Since sage is a prerequisite for gap, this should work.  (I don't know if anything in the sagetex test suite uses gap, but it might.)

I understand how this is a problem - I'm a bit puzzled at the solution though:) 

Is there any reason not to make sage a prerequisite for sagetex directly, rather than via gap? I realise in practice it achieve the same thing, but it is far more confusing for someone to understand if they read deps. 

Would this not work, but be more informative and less confusing? 

```
# Sagetex does not require Sage in order that it may be built, but it does require 
# Sage in order that it may be tested using SAGE_CHECK=yes.
$(INST)/$(SAGETEX): $(INST)/$(PYTHON) $(INST)/$(SAGE)
241	        $(INSTALL) "$(SAGE_SPKG) $(SAGETEX) 2>&1" "tee -a $(SAGE_LOGS)/$(SAGETEX).log"
```

We might in fact find other dependencies that we don't know about. Building packages in parallel will force deps to be more accurate. There may be other packages which can only be tested after something else is built. So as we had spkg-check files, there might be other similar issues arise.

Replying to [@jhpalmieri](#comment%3A3):
> Well, I don't know if spkg-check in sagetex uses anything from gap: various calls in Sage end up calling gap in the background.  We could add sage as a dependency, but unless ddrake says otherwise, I'd like to keep gap there as well.

I've got no doubt this will work what you are proposing. But given you say the problem is sagetex calls Sage for testing, I can't understand the logic of listing gap as a dependency. Why gap? 

There is no reference to gap anywhere in the Sagetex source files

```
drkirkby@hawk:~/SAGE-4.5.alpha1/spkg/standard/sagetex-2.2.5$ ggrep -Ri gap *
drkirkby@hawk:~/SAGE-4.5.alpha1/spkg/standard/sagetex-2.2.5$ 
```

Without an explanation in the 'deps' file, one could easily envisage someone coming along one day and saying "Sagetex is a typesetting program, and does not need gap, so lets remove gap as a dependency". That would break, as the real dependency is Sage, but that fact is obscured. I would have thought it much safer to explicitly list Sage as a dependency, and adding a comment like I put above would ensure nobody updating deps would be under any illusion why Sage is a dependency. 

BTW, in SPKG.txt, it says:

```
== Dependencies ==

To install, nothing more than a standard Sage install. The
{{{spkg-check}}} script will exit without actually testing anything if
it cannot find "latex" in your path, or if it cannot find tkz-berge.sty,
a TikZ add-on required for typesetting some graphs.
}}}


again, no mention of gap. So I can't see the logic of explicitly listing gap - it just appears to add confusion, though I would agree that technically it does achieve the requirement, but via an obscure way.

And a standard Sage install includes gap.  That is, there are plenty of doctests in Sage which would fail if gap were not installed.  I don't know what would happen for the tests in sagetex if gap were not installed.

We could list both Sage and gap as dependencies for sagetex, and also put in a comment about it if you think that's necessary.  What I would really like to guarantee is that all of the other Sage spkgs have been installed before sagetex is, in order to guarantee a "standard Sage install", but I don't know how to do that.

I'm attaching new versions.

Hi John, 

I think that is pretty clear now. This looks good, so positive review. 

#9274 also updates 'deps' but is marked as 'needing work'.

I was thinking that while working on this release. It makes me wonder whether they should actually go in `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin`. Even though they don't really quite belong there, that would eliminate the need for another repo. Is it possible to have just these two files under revision control from somewhere else?

Yes, it would make a lot more sense.
