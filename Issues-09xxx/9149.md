The following message has a spelling error: `occured` should be

```
occurred}}}:
{{{
Unhandled SIGFPE: An unhandled floating point exception occured in Sage.
This probably occured because a *compiled* component
of Sage has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
or is not properly wrapped with _sig_on, _sig_off.
You might want to run Sage under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
Sage will now terminate (sorry).
