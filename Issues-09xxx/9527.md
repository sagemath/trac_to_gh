When doing `sage -sh`, the result is very, very confusing, since it has the SAGE_ROOT path displayed unlabeled, which causes confusion, and does not show the current path, which also causes confusion.  This patch adds a label and the current path, to help reduce confusion some.

The patch looks fine. I'd have preferred to have my PS1 to be embedded in the new PS1, i.e. something like this:

```
this_is_my_prompt$ sage -sh
SAGE_ROOT=/usr/local/sage-4.3
(sage subshell) this_is_my_prompt$


```
But it seems this just doesn't work (I tried). This new one is definitely an improvement thus I'll give it a positive review.

I tried too, but couldn't figure it out. This patch is meant to be a big improvement, that's all.
