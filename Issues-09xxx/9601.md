cvxopt requires C99 math functions that are not part of the base FreeBSD libraries.  #9543 uses cephes to provide these missing functions but referencing them requires that cvxopt search $SAGE_LOCAL/include.  The attached patch modified spkg-install to
include this.

This patch is local to Sage and does not need to be reported upstream.
