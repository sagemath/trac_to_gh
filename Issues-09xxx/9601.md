cvxopt requires C99 math functions that are not part of the base FreeBSD libraries.  #9543 uses cephes to provide these missing functions but referencing them requires that cvxopt search $SAGE_LOCAL/include.  The attached patch modified spkg-install to
include this.

This patch is local to Sage and does not need to be reported upstream.

Whilst I realise this should be coordinated with #6456, I thought it wise that this got positive review first, to make merging easier. 

The fix is clearly FreeBSD specific, so will not impact any other system.

Is anyone working on the FreeBSD port now? I'm not aware of Peter working on it. I think he got a bit fed up with what he called the 

"release it now, we'll make it work later" mentality.

(They are Peter's words, not mine. See #9601.)
