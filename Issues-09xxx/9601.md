cvxopt requires C99 math functions that are not part of the base FreeBSD libraries.  #9543 uses cephes to provide these missing functions but referencing them requires that cvxopt search $SAGE_LOCAL/include.  The attached patch modified spkg-install to
include this.

This patch is local to Sage and does not need to be reported upstream.

Keywords: **sd40.5**

Reviewer: **David Kirkby, Mike Hansen, Peter Jeremy**

Component: **porting: BSD**

Whilst I realise this should be coordinated with #6456, I thought it wise that this got positive review first, to make merging easier. 

The fix is clearly FreeBSD specific, so will not impact any other system.
