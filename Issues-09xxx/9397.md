Singular will not build on Solaris or OpenSolaris with x86/x64 processors, nor will it build 64-bit Solaris x64 with SPARC processors.

There are two different reasons for the two different problems, but they are both addressed by this patch. 

## Problem No. 1 Poor patching practice prevents Solaris or OpenSolaris x86/x64 builds

The first only affects x86/x64 hardware. The second affects 

One patch added the following few lines to a file 

```
ifeq ($(SINGUNAME),ix86-SunOS)
SO_SUFFIX  = so
LIBSINGULAR_FLAGS = -shared
LIBSINGULAR_LIBS = -lsingfac -lsingcf -lntl -lreadline -lgmp lomalloc
endif
``` 

but those changes subsequently got overwritten by a latter patch. An inspection of spkg-install in Singular shows the file `src/Singular/Makefile.in` being overwritten twice. See below. 

```
patch()
{
    # work-around patches
    cp patches/mminit.cc src/kernel/
    cp patches/assert.h src/factory/
    cp patches/kernel.rmodulon.cc src/kernel/rmodulon.cc
    cp patches/src.Singular.Makefile.in src/Singular/Makefile.in # FIRST
    cp patches/Singular.libsingular.h src/Singular/libsingular.h
    cp patches/factory.GNUmakefile.in src/factory/GNUmakefile.in
    cp patches/libfac.charset.alg_factor.cc src/libfac/charset/alg_factor.cc
    cp patches/kernel.Makefile.in src/kernel/Makefile.in
    cp patches/Singular.Makefile.in src/Singular/Makefile.in # OVERWRITES FIRST
    cp patches/Singular.tesths.cc src/Singular/tesths.cc

    if [ "$UNAME" = "CYGWIN" ]; then
        # Fine to make this patch on any system, because it is code that is only compiled on Windows.
        cp patches/sing_win.cc src/Singular/
        cp patches/IntegerProgramming-Makefile.in src/IntegerProgramming/Makefile.in
    fi

    #cp patches/Singular.configure src/Singular/configure
    #cp patches/Singular.configure.in src/Singular/configure.in
}
```

Removing the target `ix86-SunOS` would stop any build on Solaris or OpenSolaris with x86/x64 hardware, but would not affect SPARC builds at all. 

## Problem No. 2 Compiler flag -m64 not propagating properly throughout the Singular build process

dding the compiler flag -m64 was not sufficient to permit Singular to build fully 64-bit, as part of it failed with:

```
make[1]: Entering directory 
`/export/home/drkirkby/clean/sage-4.5.alpha0/spkg/build/singular-3.1.0.4.p8/src/Singular'
g++ -O2 -g -m64 -fPIC -pipe -I. -I../kernel

-I/export/home/drkirkby/clean/sage-4.5.alpha0/local/include

grammar.o scanner.o attrib.o eigenval_ip.o extra.o fehelp.o feOpt.o 
ipassign.o 
ipconv.o ipid.o iplib.o ipprint.o ipshell.o lists.o sdb.o fglm.o 
interpolation.o 
silink.o subexpr.o janet.o wrapper.o libparse.o sing_win.o gms.o pcv.o 
maps_ip.o 
walk.o walk_ip.o cntrlc.o misc.o calcSVD.o  slInit_Static.o mpsr_Put.o 
mpsr_PutPoly.o mpsr_GetPoly.o mpsr_sl.o mpsr_Get.o mpsr_GetMisc.o mpsr_Error.o 
ndbm.o sing_dbm.o -lkernel -L../kernel -L../factory -L../libfac 
-L/export/home/drkirkby/clean/sage-4.5.alpha0/local/lib -lsingfac -lsingcf -
lntl 
-lreadline -lgmp -lomalloc
ld: fatal: file libsingular-tesths.o: wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS64
ld: fatal: file processing errors. No output written to libsingular.so
```

Note how the first line has the -m64 flag, but the second line does not - this is despite -m64 being in both CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS. I discovered that using 

 ```
 CC="gcc -m64"
 CXX="g++ -m64"
 export CC
 export CXX
 ```

solved the problem. After sending this to the Singular mailing list, I got a response from Hans Schoenemann, one of the developers saying "That's the right way."



Hence the patch which will be attached later does two things. 
* Resolves the mess created by two patches patching the same file. 
* Ensure the compilers really are called with the -m64 flag.

I've made the changes and tested this on a number of systems. On the Sun Blade 1000 running Solaris 10, it has been tested as both the default 32-bit build, but also as a 64-bit build. 

The build logs attached show this working on
* Linux (sage.math) Default 64-bit build
* OS X (bsd.math) Default 64-bit build
* OpenSolaris 06/2009 on an Intel Xeon processors. Forced a 64-bit build 
* Solaris 10. SPARC processor. Default 32-bit build
* Solaris 10. SPARC processor. Forced a 64-bit build with SAGE64=yes

The package may be found at

This should now be fixed when a later Singular is committed, which already has positive review at #8059. So I'm setting this back to 'needs info' to save someone a wasted effort in reviewing this. 

## Note to the release manager
This ticket can be closed when the updated Singular at #8059 is merged.

I should have perhaps clarified something here. Although I wrote 9 days ago that #8059 had positive review, that has now been removed, as it was causing problems. 

So this is now up for review.
