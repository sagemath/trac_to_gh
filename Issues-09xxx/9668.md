See [this](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/b35848f099c763a9) thread on sage-support.

```
Here is how I got the optional package automap to install into a 
binary sage R. 
Go into the sage directory and edit the following files: 
local/bin/R and local/lib/R/bin/R 
and change all the hard-set user variables "/scratch/...." to the true 
locations of R_HOME_DIR, R_HOME, R_INCLUDE_DIR, R_SHARE_DIR and for 
good measure, R_DOC_DIR. Replace the default string EVERYWHERE in the 
file. 
I then exported SAGE_HOME as well (Not sure that this is needed.), and 
run local/bin/R 
Inside R, install.packages("automap") 
No more build errors, and when I restart R, automap loads using 
library. Just have to try it out from sage now. 
Any chance there's a script to find all of these hard-set strings and 
change them to correct values?

Ok, a bit more subtle than I expected (R is quite weird, failed to build inbetween), but I now have a p6 that fixes both the `R` scripts and the `pkg-config` file (`libR.pc`).

---

There was another issue with R [someone reported on sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/msg/ebb50bd73aba7d53?dmode=source) which was caused by a "complicated" setting of an environment variable, in this case `PAGER`, but that's certainly an upstream problem and rather exotic.

Almost certainly the former.

[Note to myself:]

The problem is that removing any reference to `SAGE_ROOT` and `SAGE_LOCAL` disables the script being "automatically" relocated in the first place.

I'll then have to guess `SAGE_ROOT` if none of Sage's variables are defined. We also have two copies of the R script, one in `local/bin/`, and one in `local/lib/R/bin/`.

Guessing `SAGE_ROOT` there is simply bullshit. Simply add a sanity check, pointing to `sage --R`, `install_scripts()` and perhaps `sage --sh` in case `SAGE_LOCAL` isn't defined.

Furthermore:

* Address / check the following (copied from [comment:ticket:10967:14]):

```
The problem was with hard-coded paths, not the 
permissions.  Anyway, the fix was easy.  I opened all the files listed 
above by George: 
sage/local/lib/R/bin/R 
sage/local/lib/R/bin/libtool 
sage/local/lib/R/etc/Makeconf 
sage/local/lib/R/etc/ldpath 
sage/local/lib/R/etc/Renviron 
sage/local/bin/R 
and edited obvious lines containing hardcoded paths (using find- 
replace-all at once). 
```

* Change `libR.pc` to use either `${pc_top_builddir}` or `$${SAGE_ROOT}`. (In the former case, perhaps also set `PC_TOP_BUILD_DIR` to `$SAGE_ROOT`, or prepend `$SAGE_ROOT:`, unless it is already contained.)

This problem prevents Sage from being relocatable on Solaris, or at least on the skynet machines mark and mark2: if I build Sage, then move the entire Sage directory, then run `sage` so the relocation scripts get executed, and then run `sage -R`, I get an error:

```

```
I tried just modifying local/bin/R and local/lib/R/bin/R, replacing the hard-coded paths with `$SAGE_ROOT`, but I still got an error.

```

It's easy enough to add these to the "for" loop that I added to spkg-install, so I might as well do that. For what it's worth, the binary files `Rscript` in both local/bin and local/lib/R/bin also have the path hard-coded in them, but I don't know how to fix this, or whether it's important. When are those files used?

We certainly do, although only "no spaces" is documented.

But I doubt Sage will work correctly with a directory like `/home/jdemeyer/.#|"+*=@$'` (which is a valid UNIX filename)

You sound like you're arguing that we might as well use `sed` :-)  If I wasn't lazy I'd try to grep through other spkgs to see if it's used elsewhere - I'm almost sure I've seen it in use before...

I don't like this at all:

If it works, you're probably relying on a bug. Why is it needed?

Also, the first hunk in `Makefile.in.patch` is not needed.

In any case, this needs to be rebased as R has been upgraded.

If I remember correctly, the prefix directory gets written into various of the files in `SAGE_LOCAL/lib/R/bin/`, so using `\$SAGE_LOCAL` instead of `$SAGE_LOCAL` means that "$SAGE_LOCAL" gets written verbatim to the file, instead of expanded first and then written.

I'll post a new version of the spkg when sage.math is back up. I've attached the patch. This has the effect of changing lines in `local/bin/R` (and the corresponding file `local/lib/R/bin/R`) from

```
R_SHARE_DIR=.../sage-5.8.beta4/local/lib/R/share
export R_SHARE_DIR
R_INCLUDE_DIR=.../sage-5.8.beta4/local/lib/R/include
export R_INCLUDE_DIR
R_DOC_DIR=.../sage-5.8.beta4/local/lib/R/doc
export R_DOC_DIR
```
to

```
R_SHARE_DIR="${R_HOME_DIR}/share"
export R_SHARE_DIR
R_INCLUDE_DIR="${R_HOME_DIR}/include"
export R_INCLUDE_DIR
R_DOC_DIR="${R_HOME_DIR}/doc"
export R_DOC_DIR
```
With this change, running `sage -R` and then `install.packages("automap")` seems to work.

I think that someone should confirm that with the new spkg, in the script `local/bin/R`, the variables `R_SHARE_DIR`, `R_INCLUDE_DIR`, and `R_DOC_DIR` are now defined in terms of `R_HOME_DIR` rather than being hard-coded paths as they are with the current spkg.

I can do this.

One question, though... when I move Sage back and run Sage, it doesn't change `R_HOME_DIR` back.

```
R_HOME_DIR=/Users/.../Downloads/tempR/sage-5.9.beta5/local/lib/R
```
when it should be

```
R_HOME_DIR=/Users/.../Downloads/sage-5.9.beta5/local/lib/R
```
So this was changed, presumably, when I reinstalled the spkg.  It doesn't impact installing new R packages, by the way, nor functionality of R.

In particular, moving a *different* Sage installation and starting Sage changes some things, but doesn't change the location of `R_HOME_DIR` in `local/bin/R`.    I'm not sure why that doesn't affect functionality, but presumably this should somehow be taken care of.  On this ticket?

```sh

Well, that is a Sage-specific thing, I think, but we have

```
R_HOME="${R_HOME_DIR}"
```
later on and also

```
$ ./sage -R RHOME
/Users/.../Downloads/sage-5.9.beta5/local/lib/R/
```
So all is well, I think.
