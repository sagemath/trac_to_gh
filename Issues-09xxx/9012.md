The docstring of ``sage.ring.polynomial.multi_polynomial_ideal.triangular_decomposition`` says:

```
        This requires that the given basis is reduced w.r.t. to the
        lexicographical monomial ordering. If the basis of self does
        not have this property, the required Groebner basis is
        computed implicitly.
```
however (Sage 4.4.1):

```

sage: J = Ideal(x^2+y^2-2, y^2-1)
sage: J.triangular_decomposition()

   ? error occurred in STDIN line 101: `def sage24=fglm(sage19,sage22);

The changes in the code are reasonable, it is doctested, and `sage -testall` passes.

So: Positive review!

Martin and I discussed one potential issue, namely that the method does not set `degBound=0` in Singular. But this should be on a different ticket and will involve decorators.
