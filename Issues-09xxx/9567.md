Three files with doctest failures, most look pretty harmless, different number of arguments, etc.:

The failures were

```

Several API changes:

```
sage: networkx.triangles?
Type:		function
Base Class:	<type 'function'>
String Form:	<function triangles at 0x4899b18>
Namespace:	Interactive
File:		/scratch/rlmill/sage-4.5-linux-64bit-ubuntu_8.04.4_lts-x86_64-Linux/local/lib/python/networkx/algorithms/cluster.py
Definition:	networkx.triangles(G, nbunch=None)
Docstring:
    <no docstring>
```
(triangles used to take another argument) -- `cluster_triangles()` in Sage will need to be updated to reflect this.

```
sage: networkx.clustering?
Type:		function
Base Class:	<type 'function'>
String Form:	<function clustering at 0x4899c80>
Namespace:	Interactive
File:		/scratch/rlmill/sage-4.5-linux-64bit-ubuntu_8.04.4_lts-x86_64-Linux/local/lib/python/networkx/algorithms/cluster.py
Definition:	networkx.clustering(G, nbunch=None, weights=False)
Docstring:
    <no docstring>
```
this is Sage's `clustering_coeff()`

These are both coming from the argument `with_weights` disappearing in NX.

There are also some failures related to changes in the API of cliques functionality, but since we ship cliquer standard, which is an optimized C library for just this purpose, it seems we should be using that instead anyway.

All in all, these don't look bad at all. Not nearly as bad as upgrading to 1.0.

Ben -- If you want to submit a patch, I'd be glad to review it.

Hello Ben !!!

I added a small patch containing the method cycle_basis (with a long doctest), that just calls NetworkX's. I haven't been able to properly write a cycle_space method (see http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/f99b59eaabf679a5/8bf34d54c183ab6b?lnk=gst&q=labelled#8bf34d54c183ab6b), so I tried to give a satisfying example in this docstring.

I give a positive review to your own patch for your patch/spkg, short of these two details :

* I fixed some occurences of "dictionary" in my own patch
* Your NetworkX SPKG has "uncommitted changes". Could you do a "hg commit", then upload the new version ? ( You can notice this when using the "sage -pkg" command to build spkg).

* [attachment: trac_9567-cycle_basis.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9567/trac_9567-cycle_basis.patch.gz)

to merge this ticket?

I'm changing the status to 'needs_work' for this: The first patch is missing the ticket number in the first line of its commit string.  The first line itself should also be short (< 80 characters) but stand on its own, in order to keep `hg log` listings succinct and informative.  Of course, there's no problem with extra lines that describe the changes in detail.

The second patch's commit string should perhaps be a bit more descriptive.

Also, please update the Author(s) and Reviewer(s) fields.
