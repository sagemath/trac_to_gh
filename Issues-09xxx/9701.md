The missing conversion from `NumberFieldElement` to float is the cause of this strangeness:

```
sage: RR(I*I)
-1.00000000000000
sage: float(I*I)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

TypeError: unable to simplify to float approximation
```

(I'll have a patch posted for this in a few minutes.)

Attachment: **[trac_9701-float-of-number-field-element.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9701/trac_9701-float-of-number-field-element.patch.gz)**

The attached patch adds the missing method and adds a doctest in symbolics where I originally saw the problem.

All doctests pass.
