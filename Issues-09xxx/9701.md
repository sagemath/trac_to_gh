```
The missing conversion from `NumberFieldElement` to float is the cause of this strangeness:

```
sage: RR(I*I)
-1.00000000000000
sage: float(I*I)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

TypeError: unable to simplify to float approximation
```

(I'll have a patch posted for this in a few minutes.)
