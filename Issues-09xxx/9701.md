The missing conversion from `NumberFieldElement` to float is the cause of this strangeness:

```
sage: RR(I*I)
-1.00000000000000
sage: float(I*I)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

/home/cwitty/sage-4.5.2.alpha1/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/symbolic/expression.so in sage.symbolic.expression.Expression.__float__ (sage/symbolic/expression.cpp:5205)()

TypeError: unable to simplify to float approximation
```

(I'll have a patch posted for this in a few minutes.)

The attached patch adds the missing method and adds a doctest in symbolics where I originally saw the problem.

All doctests pass.
