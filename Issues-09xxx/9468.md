From the doc:

```
        Let ``cls`` be a class in :class:`ClasscallMetaclass`, and consider
        a call of the form:

            ``x in cls``

        If ``cls`` defines a method ``__classcontains__``, then this
        results in a call to::

         - ``cls.__classcontains__(cls, x)``

        EXAMPLES:

        We construct a class which implements membership testing, and
        which contains ``1`` and no other x::

            sage: from sage.misc.classcall_metaclass import ClasscallMetaclass
            sage: class Foo(object):
            ...       __metaclass__ = ClasscallMetaclass
            ...       @staticmethod
            ...       def __classcontains__(cls, x):
            ...           return x == 1
            sage: 1 in Foo
            True
            sage: 2 in Foo
            False
```

This patch also fixes some typos and such in the documentation of ClassCallMetaclass

Florent: the documentation should really include the __*__ methods. Here, this makes the link for `__get__` wrongly point to the corresponding Python doc (with the intersphinx option).
