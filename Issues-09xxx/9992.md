As discussed [here](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/9788a6ad6fe03ab9), the Python script `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/base/sage-make_relative` is run before Python is built in Sage. On a system that do not have Python installed (like a fresh install of IBM's AIX operating system),  this generates an error message message as this script is run. 

```
Making Sage/Python scripts relocatable...
python: No such file or directory 
```

This could be quite worrying, to find that an important program like Python is missing.

The bottom of the file `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/base/sage-spkg` has this:

```sh
echo "Making Sage/Python scripts relocatable..."

cd "$SAGE_LOCAL"/bin
./sage-make_relative

echo "Finished installing $PKG_NAME.spkg" 

# It's OK if the above fails -- in fact it will until Python
# itself gets installed. That's fine. 
exit 0   
```

which indicates a failure of `sage-make_relative` is unimportant. But still it is annoying and led me to believe there was a more serious bug. 

It does not seem appropriate to let `sage-make_relative` fail, but it would be much better if `sage-make_relative` can be removed, and its functionality moved to the script that calls it, which is `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/base/sage-spkg`.

I've attached a copy of `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/base/sage-make_relative`, which I believe could be written much better. I'm attaching it, since I will want to create an external link to this file.

Or just not check if python is not run.

Yes. At the minute it tests binaries too.

That's not such a big deal.

OK, well this is easy to fix by putting an 

if [ -f '$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/python" ] ; then
   # Run the python script. 
fi

I'll leave you to modify the python script if you want to.

I think it should skip files matching `sage-*` and those whose first line already starts with `#!/usr/bin/env ...`.

> > I don't agree moving its functionality into `sage-spkg` is a good idea. (IIRC it is called by other scripts as well, and `sage-spkg` shouldn't be blown up too much.)

That's an improvement, though it is not clear if we in the near future make Python a prerequisite (or intentionally use a system Python for such if one is present).

> I'll leave you to modify the python script if you want to. 


I thought you were going to rewrite it as a shell script (which could as well be called from `sage-spkg`).

I hope we don't. 
* We rely on someone's Python working right. It was a failure of Python on William's machine which cased a headache recently with `sage_fortran`.

No, I think it will be easier to leave it untouched, but only call it if `$SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/python` exists. The script appears to work and if it is called from multiple places, I'd have to duplicate its functionality accurately - even though I think they are a bit dumb.

If we want to allow other `python`s as well, we'd have to change it to e.g.
