As discussed [here](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/9788a6ad6fe03ab9), the Python script `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/base/sage-make_relative` is run before Python is built in Sage. On a system that do not have Python installed (like a fresh install of IBM's AIX operating system),  this generates an error message message as this script is run. 

```
Making Sage/Python scripts relocatable...
python: No such file or directory 
```

This could be quite worrying, to find that an important program like Python is missing.

The bottom of the file `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/base/sage-spkg` has this:

```sh
echo "Making Sage/Python scripts relocatable..."

cd "$SAGE_LOCAL"/bin
./sage-make_relative

echo "Finished installing $PKG_NAME.spkg" 

# It's OK if the above fails -- in fact it will until Python
# itself gets installed. That's fine. 
exit 0   
```

which indicates a failure of `sage-make_relative` is unimportant. But still it is annoying and led me to believe there was a more serious bug. 

It does not seem appropriate to let `sage-make_relative` fail, but it would be much better if `sage-make_relative` can be removed, and its functionality moved to the script that calls it, which is `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/base/sage-spkg`.

I've attached a copy of `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/base/sage-make_relative`, which I believe could be written much better. I'm attaching it, since I will want to create an external link to this file.

Well, perhaps one should simply suppress (or avoid) the error message in case no Python is (yet) installed, but the script is really odd.

* It should only test (and modify) scripts that are executable.
* It "rewrites" **every** file that contains `python` and `#!` in its first line, so even already correct (and already modified) files starting with

   ```
   #!/usr/bin/env python
```
   will get rewritten.
* It makes all these files writable (but only for the owner).

I don't agree moving its functionality into `sage-spkg` is a good idea. (IIRC it is called by other scripts as well, and `sage-spkg` shouldn't be blown up too much.)

OK, well this is easy to fix by putting an 

if [ -f '$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/python" ] ; then
   \# Run the python script. 
fi

I'll leave you to modify the python script if you want to.

I think it should skip files matching `sage-*` and those whose first line already starts with `#!/usr/bin/env ...`.

That's an improvement, though it is not clear if we in the near future make Python a prerequisite (or intentionally use a system Python for such if one is present).

> I'll leave you to modify the python script if you want to. 

I thought you were going to rewrite it as a shell script (which could as well be called from `sage-spkg`).

I hope we don't.

No, I think it will be easier to leave it untouched, but only call it if `$SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/python` exists. The script appears to work and if it is called from multiple places, I'd have to duplicate its functionality accurately - even though I think they are a bit dumb.

<div id="comment:6" align="right">comment:6</div>

Attached patch only runs `sage-make_relative` if **Sage's** Python is installed (which Dave wanted).

If we want to allow other `python`s as well, we'd have to change it to e.g.

```sh
if command -v python >/dev/null; then
    ...
```

I've left the `exit 0` at the end (which is in principle superfluous since `echo` is unlikely to fail), as it clarifies that this part is (hopefully ;-) ) only reached if no errors occurred previously.
