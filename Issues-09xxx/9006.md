It is caused by sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_compiled.pyx: generic_pd and derived classes create objects having large chains of dependencies.  They make the recursively implemented methods as well as the garbage collector run out of stack space.  I decided to simply use the 'naive' method for evaluating large degree polynomials.
