Here is a method to compute the rank of elliptic curves over number fields using Simon 2-descent.

```
def rank(self,verbose=0, lim1=5, lim3=50, limtriv=10, maxprob=20, limbigprime=30):
  r"""

  This computes the rank of elliptic curves over number fields using Simon's algorithm for two-descent. If the upper and lower bounds given are the same, then we return the rank, otherwise we return the upper and lower bounds.

  INPUT: 

  The parameters are those used by simon_two_descent, and are documented there.

  OUTPUT:

  If the upper and lower bounds given by Simon two-descent are the same, then the rank has been uniquely identified and we return this. Otherwise, we return the upper and lower bounds with a warning that these are not the same.

  Note: For non-quadratic number fields, this code does return, but it takes a long time.

  EXAMPLES:

  sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2 + 23, 'a')

  sage: E = EllipticCurve(K, '37')

  sage: E == loads(dumps(E))

  True

  sage: E.rank()

  2

  Here is a curve with two-torsion, so here the algorithm gives bounds on the rank:

  sage: Qrt5.<rt5>=NumberField(x^2-5)
  
  sage: E=EllipticCurve([0,5-rt5,0,rt5,0])
  
  sage: E.rank()
  
  Lower and upper bounds differ!
  
  Lower bound being returned

  1

  IMPLEMENTATION:

  Uses Denis Simon's GP/PARI scripts from  \url{http://www.math.unicaen.fr/~simon/}.

  """

  simon_output=self.simon_two_descent(verbose=verbose,lim1=lim1,lim3=lim3,limtriv=limtriv,maxprob=maxprob,limbigprime=limbigprime)
  if simon_output[0]==simon_output[1]:
    return simon_output[0]
  print "Lower and upper bounds differ!"
  print "Lower bound being returned"
  return simon_output[0]

This is very nice -- good stuff! I have only a few tiny criticisms, mostly to do with docstring formatting.

(1)

```
1347    def rank_bounds(self,verbose=0, lim1=5, lim3=50, limtriv=10, maxprob=20, limbigprime=30): 
1348        r""" 
1349        Returns the lower and upper bounds using simon_two_descent.  The results of simon_two_descent are cached. 
```
There is a ReST syntax for cross-referencing between docstrings, which should be used here:
<code>... using :meth:\`~simon_two_descent\`. The results ...</code>.

(2)

```
1435        .. NOTE:: 
1436 
1437           Note: For non-quadratic number fields, this code does 
1438           return, but it takes a long time.
```
The output is "Note: Note: For ...". The second "Note" should go. This mistake is made in two of the three new docstrings.

(2) If it does terminate for non-quadratic fields, but it takes a long time, then throw in an example and flag it as long:

```
sage: EllipticCurve('11a').base_extend(NumberField(x^3 - 3,'c')).rank() # long time
0
```
This example only takes about 15 seconds on my machine.

(3)

```
1459        IMPLEMENTATION: 
1460 
1461        Uses Denis Simon's GP/PARI scripts from 
1462        \url{http://www.math.unicaen.fr/~simon/}. 
```
This should just be "` from http://www.math.unicaen.fr/~simon/.`" The ReST documentation parser is clever enough to spot URL's without help, and the LaTeX-style syntax you've used just gets copied into the output. This mistake is in all three of the new docstrings.
