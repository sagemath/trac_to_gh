The statistical package r fails to run if the 
libicuuc library (frequently in /usr/lib) is not
present.

libicuuc is from the International Components for Unicode
project (http://site.icu-project.org/).

Further investigation revealed that the problem only
occurs when SAGE_FAT_BINARY is used, libicuuc exists
on the build computer, but not on the computer where
sage executes.

A solution is to add "--with-ICU=no" to the configure
line in spkg-INSTALL.  A mercurial patch is attached
which does this.

The same solution _may_ work for Solaris (I have not
tested) which currently uses "--without-ICU".

In addition to providing a patch as you have done, it's normal Sage practice to put on the trac tickets a link to complete .spkg file.

According to the GNU autoconf manual:

http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/manual/autoconf.html#External-Software

"--without-package is equivalent to --with-package=no" 

I don't know anything about the SAGE_FAT_BINARY, but when I asked William if it was important, he said very so.

With Solaris, it was clear R would never build without this library, but either the library is supplied with almost all Linux distributions, or R builds without it on some systems. 

I'll raise this on sage-devel.

Given $SAGE_ROOT/README.txt says

```
3. Fat Binaries: To make a binary that will run on the widest range of
   target machines, set the SAGE_FAT_BINARY environment variable to
   "yes" before building Sage:

       export SAGE_FAT_BINARY="yes"
       make
       ./sage -bdist x.y.z-fat
```

then it seems perfectly reasonable that if one wants Sage to run on the widest range of platforms, that this library is disabled. 

If you can provide a link to a .spkg which has all the changes, then I will no doubt give this positive review.

SPKG.txt is wrong, due undoubtably due to the fact #9186 was recently merged, and took the patch level 2 number. 

```
### r-2.10.1.p2 (Mitesh Patel, June 8th 2010)
 * #9186: Set an empty MAKEFLAGS variable before "make install".  On
   OS X, at least, this fixes building multiple spkgs in parallel (cf.
   #8306).

### r-2.10.1.p2 (Mariah Lenox, 30 Jun 2010)
 * added "--with-ICU=no" to configure line of spkg-install (#9396)

### r-2.10.1.p1 (Karl-Dieter Crisman, April 12th 2010)
 * Re-enable Aqua support on OSX
```

The entry for Mariah's code should now be r-2.10.1.p3, not r-2.10.1.p2. 

I've just started a build on sage.math with this package and SAGE_FAT_BINARY=yes and will look over it. I can't see any reason this should fail, but I am going to check it. I should be back in an hour or two with a definitive decision. 

BTW, I know William has offered Mariah an account, which she has accepted, so soon she should have an account and be able to put packages on sage.math herself.

I think the problem is:

```
     if [ "$SAGE_FAT_BINARY" = "yes" ];
```

should be:

```
     if [ "$SAGE_FAT_BINARY" = "yes" ]; then
```

I've just made that change, and it at least starts to compile now. However, I don't have time to do any more on this for a few hours, since I have a chess game scheduled in a few minutes. 

There is another ticket I've just created for R (#9464), since R has Fortran code, but a Fortran dependency is not listed. I'll test these later today.

OK, here's a patch which corrects the syntax error. With this addition, R builds without the library. config.log shows R building with the option --with-icu=no. 

```
This file contains any messages produced by compilers while
running configure, to aid debugging if configure makes a mistake.

It was created by R configure 2.10.1, which was
generated by GNU Autoconf 2.61.  Invocation command line was

  $ ./configure --prefix=/home/kirkby/sage-4.5.alpha4/local --enable-R-shlib --with-x=yes --with-readline=/home/kirkby/sage-4.5.alpha4/local --with-blas=-L/home/kirkby/sage-4.5.alpha4/local/lib -lf77blas -latlas --with-lapack=-L/home/kirkby/sage-4.5.alpha4/local/lib -llapack -lcblas --with-ICU=no

## --------- ##
## Platform. ##
## --------- ##

hostname = sage.math.washington.edu
```

I was just about to ask what the connection was! When I Gooogled the error you showed, it looked more like an M4RI issue. Anyway, I'm glad it's not this ticket.
