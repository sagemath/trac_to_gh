```
The statistical package r fails to run if the 
libicuuc library (frequently in /usr/lib) is not
present.

libicuuc is from the International Components for Unicode
project (http://site.icu-project.org/).

Further investigation revealed that the problem only
occurs when SAGE_FAT_BINARY is used, libicuuc exists
on the build computer, but not on the computer where
sage executes.

A solution is to add "--with-ICU=no" to the configure
line in spkg-INSTALL.  A mercurial patch is attached
which does this.

The same solution `_may_` work for Solaris (I have not
tested) which currently uses "--without-ICU".

In addition to providing a patch as you have done, it's normal Sage practice to put on the trac tickets a link to complete .spkg file. That allows a reviewer to quickly test the revised .spkg file without making it. It also allows the reviewer to check that the repository in the package is correct (i.e. 'hg status' shows no output). However, do not attach the .spkg file - only provide a link. 

According to the GNU autoconf manual:

http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/manual/autoconf.html#External-Software

"--without-package is equivalent to --with-package=no" 

I don't know anything about the SAGE_FAT_BINARY, but when I asked William if it was important, he said very so. 


I don't know whether just disabling this library is best or not. Your patch could disable it for some people that might make use of it. With Solaris, it was clear R would never build without this library, but either the library is supplied with almost all Linux distributions, or R builds without it on some systems. 

I'll raise this on sage-devel.

Given $SAGE_ROOT/README.txt says

```
3. Fat Binaries: To make a binary that will run on the widest range of
   target machines, set the SAGE_FAT_BINARY environment variable to
   "yes" before building Sage:

       export SAGE_FAT_BINARY="yes"
       make
       ./sage -bdist x.y.z-fat
```

then it seems perfectly reasonable that if one wants Sage to run on the widest range of platforms, that this library is disabled. 

If you can provide a link to a .spkg which has all the changes, then I will no doubt give this positive review.

SPKG.txt is wrong, due undoubtably due to the fact #9186 was recently merged, and took the patch level 2 number. 

```
=== r-2.10.1.p2 (Mitesh Patel, June 8th 2010) ===
 * #9186: Set an empty MAKEFLAGS variable before "make install".  On
   OS X, at least, this fixes building multiple spkgs in parallel (cf.
   #8306).

=== r-2.10.1.p2 (Mariah Lenox, 30 Jun 2010) ===
 * added "--with-ICU=no" to configure line of spkg-install (#9396)

=== r-2.10.1.p1 (Karl-Dieter Crisman, April 12th 2010) ===
 * Re-enable Aqua support on OSX
```

The entry for Mariah's code should now be r-2.10.1.p3, not r-2.10.1.p2. 

I've just started a build on sage.math with this package and SAGE_FAT_BINARY=yes and will look over it. I can't see any reason this should fail, but I am going to check it. I should be back in an hour or two with a definitive decision. 

BTW, I know William has offered Mariah an account, which she has accepted, so soon she should have an account and be able to put packages on sage.math herself.

I think the problem is:

```
     if [ "$SAGE_FAT_BINARY" = "yes" ];
```

should be:

```
     if [ "$SAGE_FAT_BINARY" = "yes" ]; then
```

I've just made that change, and it at least starts to compile now. However, I don't have time to do any more on this for a few hours, since I have a chess game scheduled in a few minutes. 

There is another ticket I've just created for R (#9464), since R has Fortran code, but a Fortran dependency is not listed. I'll test these later today.

OK, here's a patch which corrects the syntax error. With this addition, R builds without the library. config.log shows R building with the option --with-icu=no. 

```
This file contains any messages produced by compilers while
running configure, to aid debugging if configure makes a mistake.

It was created by R configure 2.10.1, which was
generated by GNU Autoconf 2.61.  Invocation command line was

  $ ./configure --prefix=/home/kirkby/sage-4.5.alpha4/local --enable-R-shlib --with-x=yes --with-readline=/home/kirkby/sage-4.5.alpha4/local --with-blas=-L/home/kirkby/sage-4.5.alpha4/local/lib -lf77blas -latlas --with-lapack=-L/home/kirkby/sage-4.5.alpha4/local/lib -llapack -lcblas --with-ICU=no
