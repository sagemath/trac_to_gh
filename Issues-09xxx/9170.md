Cygwin has `top` now, so it's straightforward to fix.

I assume this means that 

```
sage: top()
```

will not work either. I know on Solaris, I called `prstat` rather than `top` as that is a standard part of Solaris, and `top` is not. But I thought on Linux there were some sysem calls in Sage for computing memory usage on Linux. Could it be as simple as changing

```
if [ "x$UNAME" = xLinux ] ; then 
   // Use Linux code
elif [ "x$UNAME" = xSunOS ] ; then 
  // call prstat
```

to 

```
if [ "x$UNAME" = xLinux ] || [ "x$UNAME" = xCYGWIN ] ; then 
   // Use Linux code
elif [ "x$UNAME" = xSunOS ] ; then 
  // call prstat
```

I'm not at home so I can't test on my machine, but 

```
File "/home/wstein/sage-4.4.3/devel/sage/sage/misc/getusage.py", line 30:
    sage: print "ignore this";  top()              # random output
```

looks like the line that's causing the first error to be throwing. The offending line(s) should be

```
    if U == 'linux':
        cmd = 'top -b -n 1 -p %s' % pid
    elif U == 'darwin':
        cmd = 'top -l 1 |grep "^ *%s "' % pid
    elif U == 'sunos':
        cmd = '/usr/bin/prstat -n 100000 1 1  | grep "^ *%s "' % pid
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError("top not implemented on platform %s" % U)
```

I've double checked, and cygwin *does* ship with a top, so I suspect all that needs to be done is add a few instances along the line of "or U == 'cygwin'" and these issue would be resolved.

I'll try to test this over the weekend and have a patch prepared.

Irrespective of whether Cygwin comes with top or not, using it can't be the best way to get memory usage. top is not used on Linux exept as a last resort. There are system calls to get the memory usage, which is the most sensible way to do this. If those system calls work on Cygwin, then it would be

* More accurate
* Faster
* Not require 'top' to be installed. 

`top` is not a standard Unix command. It's not defined by POSIX and will not be installed by default on Cygwin. It's better to avoid calling `top` if at all possible.

I don't know, but I thought the plan was to make an installer for Cygwin which installed the perquisites, which would include top. So it should not really fail. 

As much as I don't like the idea of using 'top', I think in the short term it is a OK. There are more significant issues causing problems on Cygwin. I would have thought this one of the lower priority ones, but that's just my opinion.

Well, `get_memory_usage` is pretty useful.  Otherwise the real question would be how to change these doctests so they pass on Cygwin, which isn't clear to me.

So I still think the best solution is not to test this on Cygwin or to expect a different result...

Or if you insist we add procps as a prereq and modify the Sage's top function implem.

Alternatively, we could modify Sage's top so that it raises an Error iff the system top is not available.
Then only the top implementation would vary, depending on the availability of top, not the doctest which would expect random output on Cygwin (0.0 if top is installed, Error otherwise).
But we would still need to deal with doctests producing different output depending on the system (let's say mark it as random Cygwin so that it will (hackingly) deal with both situation (whether procps is installed or not), rather than making it depend on the fact that it is installed which looks impossible; and expect 0.0 on other systems).
