The random_element method of univariate power series does not pass arguments to the underlying polynomial ring accurately, and the description of its second argument is inaccurate.

c.f. this [thread](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/2e4af4234e6bb33f) from sage-devel


```
sage: SQ = PowerSeriesRing(QQ,'v')
sage: SR = PowerSeriesRing(RR,'v')

sage: SQ.random_element(5,100)  # docstring promises coefficients are uniformly distributed between -100 and 100
-7/3 + 5/8*v + 37/60*v^2 + 33/8*v^3 + 77/89*v^4 + O(v^5)

sage: SR.random_element(5)  # broken
