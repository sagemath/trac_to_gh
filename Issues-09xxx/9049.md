I'm interested in computing the 0-dimensional variety of an ideal over finite field extensions of Q. I've tried the following code both on my copy (v4.4.1) of sage and online and it produces an error message. My friend tried the same code on his v4.2 sage and it worked fine. Is it possible there's a bug in the newer version?

```
S.<t>=PolynomialRing(QQ)
F.<q>=QQ.extension(t^4+1)
R.<x,y>=PolynomialRing(F)
I=R.ideal(x,y^4+1)
I.variety()
```

This produces the following error message:

```

Perhaps the example given in this ticket should be placed in the `.variety()` method of the ideal class. It is not guaranteed that we will always use the `Matrix_generic_dense` class in the future.

Thanks! That was quick. :)

I suggest to replace the check

```
if not isinstance(entries, list):
```
with

```
if not isinstance(entries, (list, tuple)):
```
instead of accepting `ValueError`s as well.

`Sequence`s are lists:

```
sage: t = Sequence([1..5])
sage: isinstance(t, list)
True
```

Explicitly checking for the condition you are testing is better than trial and error. You cannot know the meaning of the `ValueError` returned from the base rings `__call__` method, especially in such a generic setting. 

IMHO, that `try` & `except` block should be cleaned up. However it's hard to do so as it is, since this is a generic constructor, there are no doctests or specification of what the acceptable input is and doctesting the whole sage library takes hours on my laptop.
