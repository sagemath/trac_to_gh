This issue has long caused problems, although many people managed to get it fixed without actually knowing what caused it. As discussed in all detail in the following thread

http://groups.google.com/group/sage-notebook/browse_thread/thread/9191e031224a3ce9

JMol requests the data for the plot3d from the Sage backend. When it does so, on some occasions it receives a 301 Moved Permanently which Java is not following but interprets as 200 and parses the content - which then causes the error.

This is partly a client-side Java problem as Java should perhaps follow the 301 to the new location and then pass the data transparently but also Sage shouldn't provide a 301'd location in the first place.

Further details, such as the fact that this does not happen for applets which are part of a published worksheet can be found in the thread.

Can be fixed by making JMol pointing to the correct location or make Sage transparently return the data instead of a 301.

This problem occurs with both, the open IcedTea (OpenJDK) and propritary Sun Java in Firefox 3.6 on Ubuntu 10.4LTS.

On a sidenote, I assume that other people do not have this problem because they might have additional packages installed which compensate for the 301.
