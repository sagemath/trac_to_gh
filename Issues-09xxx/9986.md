Could you give MPFI's latest svn a try (outside of sage, I mean)?

I have looked at their latest sources just this morning, and it looked pretty good ; but I have no AIX box and only read the configure.ac...

Sure, my AIX box is not on now, but I'll try later. 

I later found out that .so is a permitted extension for the libraries on AIX, though all the systems libraries are .a. It appears the .a files can have both static and shared objects in the same library - I don't fully understand it, and are no AIX guru. I just have an old machine I bought long ago to ensure my code was portable. 

I'll give the svn a go later today after I've woke up properly and powered up the RS/6000. 

BTW, I'm not sure if you are an MPFI developer, but if so, and the latest svn does not work, you are welcome to have an account on the AIX box to try. Either way, on AIX, I think it would be useful if you permitted the .a extension too.

Can you please give me the command to get the latest svn snapshot. I tried googling, but can only find links to download stable versions, not snapshots.

I'm not an MPFI developper -- I just looked at it because I have things to do within sage which require good quality packages (from a portability point of view).

This will get you their most up-to-date sources :
svn checkout svn://scm.gforge.inria.fr/svn/mpfi/trunk/mpfi mpfi

Notice that as it isn't a proper snapshot but the raw code, you'll need to run ./autogen.sh, then make -- the ./autogen.sh step will build and run the configure script.

Hope this helps.
