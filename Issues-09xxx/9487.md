As has been noted several times before, the list of "supported platforms" for Sage varies depending on what particular file/web-page you read. Different sources which include a list of supported platforms include:

* README.txt
* http://www.sagemath.org/doc/installation/source.html
* http://wiki.sagemath.org/SupportedPlatforms

A proposal of mine is at 

http://wiki.sagemath.org/suggested-for-supported-platforms

which is based on the method used by Mathworks for MATLAB in their list of [System Requirements for Linux](http://www.mathworks.com/support/sysreq/current_release/linux.html). Mathworks break "supported" into two lists. 
* List systems which MATLAB is tested on, and so they can give good support. (In this case, exact version numbers are listed e.g. Ubuntu 8.04, 8.10, 9.04, and 9.10) 
* List systems on which MATLAB should work, but which they don't test. 

I generalised that to four for Sage, 

* Fully supported (Sage is always tested on **every** system in this list before a release is made) 
* Expected to work 
* Probably will not work, but porting is ongoing 
* Will not work and porting will require substantial effort 

The first two are basically the same as Mathworks use. The last two are applicable to Sage, but not for a closed source system like MATLAB. 

It would be good if the list could be maintained in such a way that there are not several different sources giving a different list of "supported" systems.
