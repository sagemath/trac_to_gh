## Build environment
* Sun Ultra 27 3.33 GHz Intel W3580 Xeon. Quad core. 8 threads. 12 GB RAM
* OpenSolaris 2009.06 snv_134 X86
* Sage 4.4.2
* gcc 4.4.4

## How gcc 4.4.4 was configured
Since the configuration of gcc is fairly critical on OpenSolaris, here's how it was built. 

```
drkirkby@hawk:~/sage-4.4.2$ gcc -v
Using built-in specs.
Target: i386-pc-solaris2.11
Configured with: ../gcc-4.4.4/configure --prefix=/usr/local/gcc-4.4.4 --with-as=/usr/local/binutils-2.20/bin/as --with-ld=/usr/ccs/bin/ld --with-gmp=/usr/local --with-mpfr=/usr/local
Thread model: posix
gcc version 4.4.4 (GCC) 
```

gcc 4.3.4 was failing to build iconv on OpenSolaris x64, suggesting it may be essential to have a very recent gcc in order to build Sage on OpenSolaris. 

## How the Sage build was attempted
* 64-bit build. SAGE64 was set to "yes"
* #9008 update zlib to latest upstream release to allow a 64-bit library to be built. 
* #9009 update mercurial spkg to build 64-bit.
* #7982 update sage_fortran so it can build 64-bit binaries.
* Run 'make -k' to find as many issues as possible quickly on OpenSolaris - see #9026 for a list of the issues known to date. 

## The problem with flintqs

<snip>
Successfully installed flintqs-20070817.p4
```

So no '-m64' flag is added to the g++ command line, so not surprisingly 'flintqs' does not build as a 64-bit binary. The output from the 'file' command confirms this:

```
drkirkby@hawk:~/sage-4.4.2$ file  local/bin/QuadraticSieve
local/bin/QuadraticSieve:       ELF 32-bit LSB executable 80386 Version 1 [FPU], dynamically linked, not stripped, no debugging information available
```

## The likely reason for the flintqs problem

spkg-install has this bit of code:

```
if [ `uname -m` = "x86_64" ]; then
    $CP makefile.opteron makefile
else
    if [ `uname` = "Darwin" -a "$SAGE64" = "yes" ]; then
        $CP makefile.osx64 makefile
    else
        $CP makefile.sage makefile
    fi
fi
```

A cursory glance would suggest the 'makefile.osx64' would work for OpenSolaris, Solaris or most other Unix operating systems, though this has not been tested yet.

The attached patch resolves this issue. A new package can be found at:

http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/patches/flintqs-20070817.p5.spkg

Now the -m64 flag is added to the compiler

```
g++ -ansi -m64 lprels.o ModuloArith.o TonelliShanks.o F2matrix.o lanczos.o QS.o  -o "QuadraticSieve" -L/export/home/drkirkby/sage-4.4.2/local/lib -lgmp

user    0m0.737s
sys     0m0.108s
Successfully installed flintqs-20070817.p5
```

and the binary is built as 64-bit. 

```
drkirkby@hawk:~/sage-4.4.2$ file  local/bin/QuadraticSieve
local/bin/QuadraticSieve:       ELF 64-bit LSB executable AMD64 Version 1, dynamically linked, not stripped, no debugging information available
