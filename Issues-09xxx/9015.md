I was looking over the shoulder of a new user as he started Sage for the first time and typed `?` on the command line. This shows the IPython help text which doesn't mention Sage at all.

We should change this to show the text displayed with `help()`.

Printing some more information when someone types `help` without the parenthesis would also be nice.

```
sage: help
<function help at 0x1d6fc80>
```

I guess there are ways to do this (see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10875442/possible-to-change-a-functions-repr-in-python), but I don't know if they're worth it. The banner when you start Sage already says

```
Type "help()" for help.
```

Positive review from me. Karl-Dieter?
