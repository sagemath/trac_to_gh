Symbolic expressions automatically evaluate themselves to simplify the data structures, representation, etc. For example,

```
sage: x+x
2*x
sage: x*x
x^2
```

The ability to disable this evaluation is a feature requested very often.

This still needs review, just because the review patch itself is so long. I've added myself as author, but obviously I didn't do much Pynac - just trying to document thoroughly - so if someone disagrees they can change that.  

Burcin, can you review this?  With this I pass all doctests.

Also, here are some issues which I believe should NOT be addressed here, but need to be on followup tickets.  My philosophy here is that mathematically correct brand-new functionality can be merged even if there are enhancements to it needed.   This ticket shouldn't be closed until new tickets are opened for these issues.

* Typesetting issues. There is nothing mathematically wrong with these (you can try it), but they are obviously confusing to users.  

```

sage: i.mul(2)
2*I
sage: i.mul(2,hold=True)
2*I*
sage: i.mul(2,hold=True).simplify()
2*I
sage: i.mul(i)
-1
sage: i.mul(i,hold=True)
-
sage: i.mul(i,hold=True).simplify()
-1
```

* `heaviside(0) != SR(0).step()` This is already true in Sage, so we don't need to address in this ticket, but it becomes obvious when trying to simplify a 'held' expression with `step()`.

* There is no way to get `Order(hold=True)` to evaluate!  Same problem with `csgn` and `step` (the latter could be fixed via the above).  This is annoying but probably they are still useful.

* Big problem, which is why I didn't make log_gamma symbolic:

```
sage: log_gamma(i).n()
-0.0219785471672303 - 0.168184318273662*I
sage: log_gamma(pari(i))
-0.650923199301856 - 1.87243664726243*I
(%i3) ev(log_gamma(%i),numer);
(%o3)             - 1.872436647262428 %i - .6509231993018556
```
So no new error has been introduced with this patch, but it exposed this Pynac difference/bug.

* Enhancement - coth, sech, csch and their arc-guys basically already are purely symbolic and hold doesn't do much for them.  For instance:

```
sage: cosh(0)
1
sage: sech(0)
sech(0)
```
So we should do something about that.  But Maxima knows:

```
sage: sech(0).simplify()
1
```

* Here is something where I was able to make it work in the doctests, but honestly don't know what is going on.

```
sage: I.log(hold=True).simplify()
1/2*I*pi
sage: var('I')
I
sage: I.log(hold=True).simplify()
log(I)
sage: restore('I')
sage: I.log(hold=True).simplify()
log(I)
```
This turns out to cause trouble in doctests.  I don't know why this happens.

I ran the doctests and looked at the patch.
Everything looks fine.
Maybe at line 392 of sage/functions/hyperbolic.py you changed "WARNING:" to ".. warning::" but Sage doc (http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/conventions.html) encourages to use uppercase, so ".. WARNING::" could be used.
Nothing important however.

Other unrelated problems, I'll try to report :

-By the way there is a problem within http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/conventions.html.
It says to use ".. NOTE:" and there is "NOTES:" in the example.
There is also nothing about "TESTS:" section which is often used.
The reccurent use of ".. blah ::", "::" and "sage: " could also be documented or point to the corresponding pages of Sphynx doc (even if looking at the examples is of course the best way to go and looking through Sphynx doc explains many things).

- In sage/symbolic/relation.py inside a warning block a "{ does }" should be replaced by "*does*"

Great, thanks!  

Do you mind putting your "real" name in the "reviewer" list, and then adding yourself to the long list of Trac users on the main Trac page?  Thanks - that helps a lot; otherwise I'm not sure how we'd track you down.

Huh - I just did `search_src('warning')` and LOTS of things came up in exactly this way.  That should probably be a global ticket, I agree.

Yes, open a ticket and cc: mvgnu and jhpalmieri on it, who both seem to understand Sphinx and would at least have comments on it.

This would have priority "trivial", I think ;)

This is now #10072, and making `log_gamma` symbolic is #10075.

Speaking of these doc issues, when reading through the doc in symbolic/expression.pyx I realized that there were some pre-existing problems in the html documentation.  This is now #10080.

11 out of 12 consecutive tickets all as followups from one ticket... this must be a good ticket ;)  Or at least well-proofread, since nearly all of these things have nothing to do with the ticket per se, but were discovered while reviewing it.
