<div id="comment:0"></div>

In some old versions of Sage, the S-unit commands returned values with the wrong parent:

```
sage: _.<x>=QQ[]
sage: L.<alpha>=NumberField(x^3+x+1)
sage: p=L.S_units([ L.ideal(7) ] )
sage: p[0].parent()
Rational Field
```
The correct output should be

```
Number Field in alpha with defining polynomial x^3 + x + 1
```

This is now fixed, so we should doctest to make sure it doesn't get broken again.
