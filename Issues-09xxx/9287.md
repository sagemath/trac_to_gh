The second patch (indep of the first) takes care of

* ell_modular_symbol
* sha_tate
* ell_torsion

See trac ticket #9313 of how to take care of padic_height.py

That is how far I will do improve the documentation so far. If someone else would like to improve it further either put it back to needs_work and continue the work here or (prefered by me) open a new ticket.
