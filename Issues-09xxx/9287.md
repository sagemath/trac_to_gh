Attachment [trac_9287.coverage_for_elliptic_curves_part2.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket9287/trac_9287.coverage_for_elliptic_curves_part2.patch) by @categorie created at 2010-06-22 17:52:15

The second patch (indep of the first) takes care of

* ell_modular_symbol
* sha_tate
* ell_torsion

See trac ticket #9313 of how to take care of padic_height.py

That is how far I will do improve the documentation so far. If someone else would like to improve it further either put it back to needs_work and continue the work here or (prefered by me) open a new ticket.
