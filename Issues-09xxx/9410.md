In 4.4.4 the following code produces a ValueError:

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2+1)
sage: L.<b> = K.extension(x^2-17)
sage: E = EllipticCurve(L, [1,1])
sage: E.local_data()
```

As a workaround, one can use absolute_field:

```
L1.<c> = L.absolute_field()
E1 = EllipticCurve(L1, [1,1])
E1.local_data()
```

This seems to have been fixed since I reported this a couple of years ago, so this ticket can be closed.  Can/should I do something to flag the ticket as such?

Choose invalid/dontfix from the Milestone menu (under "Modify Ticket").  It will the be closed.

I think it has been fixed for ages, but it hardly seems worth looking for when.  Thanks for noticing -- I'll let you follow the above instructions.

Thank you both!  I have changed the milestone as instructed.

There was no option yet to flag this as positively reviewed, so I didn't do that.  My guess is that one has to first set the ticket as "needs review" before that option becomes available.  If this should be done, please let me know.
