Actually, I found a bug: the "source editor" feature (#9512) converts line endings from Unix to DOS (so once you've edited the file, mercurial thinks every line has changed).

Given the total non-discoverability of #9512, I'm not sure this bug is worth holding up the new spkg; I'll let somebody else decide that.
