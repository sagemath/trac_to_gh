Actually, I found a bug: the "source editor" feature (#9512) converts line endings from Unix to DOS (so once you've edited the file, mercurial thinks every line has changed).

Given the total non-discoverability of #9512, I'm not sure this bug is worth holding up the new spkg; I'll let somebody else decide that.

In order to have a new SageNB package ready for 4.5.2, I've decided to change #9512's status to *needs_work* and "unmerge" it from SageNB 0.8.2.  I've included #3342, #9554, and #9580 in an updated SageNB 0.8.2, which is available at the link in the description.

Note: I haven't added a patch level (e.g., `sagenb-0.8.2p0.spkg`), but I have renamed the previous version to `sagenb-0.8.2-9572.spkg`.
