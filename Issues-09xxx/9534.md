The existing base method returned "Integer Ring" for all permutation groups as it was inherited from ParentWithBase. This new base method uses GAP's base from stabilizer chain method to return an actual base, with an optional seed.

The patch was placed in the combinat queue as it depends on Mike Hansen's domain modifications.

Does this now have to be rebased on (the rebased) #10335?

In case it does, one should set it to "needs work", otherwise the milestone should be changed to Sage 4.7.2 again.
