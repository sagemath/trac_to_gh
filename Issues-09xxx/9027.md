There are a variety of ways to use latex in Sage, which often leads to some confusion.  This new section of the tutorial will present an overview and the basics of usage from a users perspective.  However, doctests might also help developers understand how to make changes related to various aspects of tex support.

Hi Rob,

Here are some comments.  

- Overall, it looks good.  It seems to cover all of the points I would want it to.  I also think it makes sense to include this material in the tutorial.

- In general, make it more clear just how much of this is automatic?  (for example the png conversion discussed at line 237 and nearby)

- how much do we care about consistency between <code>\`\TeX\`</code> and `tex`, <code>\`\LaTeX\`</code> and `latex`?

typos:
 
- line 7: intensley synergetic --> intensely synergistic

- line 24: constructiing

- line 100: Effecting --> Affecting

- line 173: mathbb?  This might be mathbf unless you use a .. link:: directive to link it to the previous examples.  same issue on lines 183, 188, etc.

- line 235: Typset

- line 240: this class --> This class

- line 240: wwwhat

- line 240: To actual see --> To actually see

- line 262 and following, the sentence starting "So all of these components need".  Change to "So you should make sure that up-to-date versions of these are available"

- line 311: "::math" --> ".. math::"

- line 318: there is a section in the tutorial on sagetex, so you should refer to that.

The most recent patch doesn't apply cleanly, because macros.tex is no longer part of the Sage distribution.

Also, if you do `sage -docbuild tutorial html -j` to build using jsMath, then jsMath doesn't know about the command `\LaTeX`, and this causes problems.  I also couldn't get <code>\`\mbox{\TeX}\`{}shop</code> to work right, either.  So I'm attaching a reviewer's patch which changes `\mbox{\LaTeX}` to the plain-text `LaTeX`, and similarly for `TeX`.  I've also added a few links.

Possibly passable enough to review, but not good enough to create.  ;-)

Thanks for the fixes and changes.  I'll look them over soon - busy with out-of-town guests right at the moment.

You know the seasons in the Pacific Northwest, don't you?

10 months of rain and two months of visitors.  ;-)

v4 patch removes the changes to macros.tex so will now apply cleanly.

reviewer patch looks good to me, so that's a positive review on that.

doctesting patch makes a few more changes to make random-order doctesting work properly.  The general strategy is to clean-up on finishing a block (rather than always initializing on starting a block).  There are a few report of macros, preamble etc on starting a block, but that is to illustrate, rather than check.

Apply three patches in this order:  v4, reviewer, doctesting.  This all applies, builds (documentation) and passes tests (in random order!).  I'll make a mega-patch once final.

Hi Rob,

It looks like trac_9074-tkz-graph-latex-v4.patch belongs on #9074 instead of here. Can you move it there?  Is there a new version of the patch for this ticket?

The real 9027 v4 patch is here now, sorry for the confusion.  I've never been able to delete files.  Do I need some extra privileges, or can you trash 9074-v4 for me?  Thanks.
