Hi Rob,

Here are some comments.  

- Overall, it looks good.  It seems to cover all of the points I would want it to.  I also think it makes sense to include this material in the tutorial.

- In general, make it more clear just how much of this is automatic?  (for example the png conversion discussed at line 237 and nearby)

- how much do we care about consistency between <code>`\TeX`</code> and `tex`, <code>`\LaTeX`</code> and `latex`?

typos:
 
- line 7: intensley synergetic --> intensely synergistic

- line 24: constructiing

- line 100: Effecting --> Affecting

- line 173: mathbb?  This might be mathbf unless you use a .. link:: directive to link it to the previous examples.  same issue on lines 183, 188, etc.

- line 235: Typset

- line 240: this class --> This class

- line 240: wwwhat

- line 240: To actual see --> To actually see

- line 262 and following, the sentence starting "So all of these components need".  Change to "So you should make sure that up-to-date versions of these are available"

- line 311: "::math" --> ".. math::"

- line 318: there is a section in the tutorial on sagetex, so you should refer to that.

v4 patch removes the changes to macros.tex so will now apply cleanly.

reviewer patch looks good to me, so that's a positive review on that.

doctesting patch makes a few more changes to make random-order doctesting work properly.  The general strategy is to clean-up on finishing a block (rather than always initializing on starting a block).  There are a few report of macros, preamble etc on starting a block, but that is to illustrate, rather than check.

Apply three patches in this order:  v4, reviewer, doctesting.  This all applies, builds (documentation) and passes tests (in random order!).  I'll make a mega-patch once final.

The real 9027 v4 patch is here now, sorry for the confusion.  I've never been able to delete files.  Do I need some extra privileges, or can you trash 9074-v4 for me?  Thanks.
