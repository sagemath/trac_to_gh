There are a variety of ways to use latex in Sage, which often leads to some confusion.  This new section of the tutorial will present an overview and the basics of usage from a users perspective.  However, doctests might also help developers understand how to make changes related to various aspects of tex support.

Hi Rob,

Here are some comments.  

- Overall, it looks good.  It seems to cover all of the points I would want it to.  I also think it makes sense to include this material in the tutorial.

- In general, make it more clear just how much of this is automatic?  (for example the png conversion discussed at line 237 and nearby)

- how much do we care about consistency between <code>\`\TeX\`</code> and `tex`, <code>\`\LaTeX\`</code> and `latex`?

typos:
 
- line 7: intensley synergetic --> intensely synergistic

- line 24: constructiing

- line 100: Effecting --> Affecting

- line 173: mathbb?  This might be mathbf unless you use a .. link:: directive to link it to the previous examples.  same issue on lines 183, 188, etc.

- line 235: Typset

- line 240: this class --> This class

- line 240: wwwhat

- line 240: To actual see --> To actually see

- line 262 and following, the sentence starting "So all of these components need".  Change to "So you should make sure that up-to-date versions of these are available"

- line 311: "::math" --> ".. math::"

- line 318: there is a section in the tutorial on sagetex, so you should refer to that.

Also, if you do `sage -docbuild tutorial html -j` to build using jsMath, then jsMath doesn't know about the command `\LaTeX`, and this causes problems.  I also couldn't get <code>\`\mbox{\TeX}\`{}shop</code> to work right, either.  So I'm attaching a reviewer's patch which changes `\mbox{\LaTeX}` to the plain-text `LaTeX`, and similarly for `TeX`.

Possibly passable enough to review, but not good enough to create.  ;-)

Thanks for the fixes and changes.  I'll look them over soon - busy with out-of-town guests right at the moment.

You know the seasons in the Pacific Northwest, don't you?

10 months of rain and two months of visitors.  ;-)

v4 patch removes the changes to macros.tex so will now apply cleanly.

reviewer patch looks good to me, so that's a positive review on that.

doctesting patch makes a few more changes to make random-order doctesting work properly.  The general strategy is to clean-up on finishing a block (rather than always initializing on starting a block).  There are a few report of macros, preamble etc on starting a block, but that is to illustrate, rather than check.

Apply three patches in this order:  v4, reviewer, doctesting.  This all applies, builds (documentation) and passes tests (in random order!).  I'll make a mega-patch once final.

Hi Rob,

It looks like trac_9074-tkz-graph-latex-v4.patch belongs on #9074 instead of here. Can you move it there?  Is there a new version of the patch for this ticket?
