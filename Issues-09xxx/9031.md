The algebraic_dependency function currently calls Pari/GP.
For big problems fpLLL should be faster, thus there should be
an option to call fpLLL instead.

Sage's command does call fpLLL.  This ticket should be closed. 

Type

ok, but the documentation should be fixed:

```
   Note that "algebraic_dependency" is a synonym for "algdep".
sage: a=sqrt(2)+sqrt(3);algebraic_dependency(a,4)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NameError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-10-0409cbaa7642> in <module>()
----> 1 a=sqrt(Integer(2))+sqrt(Integer(3));algebraic_dependency(a,Integer(4))

NameError: name 'algebraic_dependency' is not defined
```
and:

```
   You can specify the number of known bits or digits of z with
   "known_bits=k" or "known_digits=k". PARI is then told to compute
   the result using 0.8k of these bits/digits.
```
If fpLLL is used now, `PARI` should be removed or replaced here.
