```
The algebraic_dependency function currently calls Pari/GP.
For big problems fpLLL should be faster, thus there should be
an option to call fpLLL instead.

Component: **basic arithmetic**

ok, but the documentation should be fixed:

```
   Note that "algebraic_dependency" is a synonym for "algdep".
sage: a=sqrt(2)+sqrt(3);algebraic_dependency(a,4)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NameError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-10-0409cbaa7642> in <module>()
----> 1 a=sqrt(Integer(2))+sqrt(Integer(3));algebraic_dependency(a,Integer(4))

NameError: name 'algebraic_dependency' is not defined
```
and:

```
   You can specify the number of known bits or digits of z with
   "known_bits=k" or "known_digits=k". PARI is then told to compute
   the result using 0.8k of these bits/digits.
```
If fpLLL is used now, `PARI` should be removed or replaced here.
