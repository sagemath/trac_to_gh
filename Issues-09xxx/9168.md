Some ratpoints tests fail on cygwin, e.g.:

```

sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/libs/ratpoints.pyx"               
**********************************************************************
File "/home/wstein/sage-4.4.3/devel/sage/sage/libs/ratpoints.pyx", line 57:
    sage: for x,y,z in ratpoints([1..6], 200):
       print -Integer(1)*y**Integer(2) + Integer(1)*z**Integer(6) + Integer(2)*x*z**Integer(5) + Integer(3)*x**Integer(2)*z**Integer(4) + Integer(4)*x**Integer(3)*z**Integer(3) + Integer(5)*x**Integer(4)*z**Integer(2) + Integer(6)*x**Integer(5)*z

Got:

```

What happens when the same is done manually:

```

sage: from sage.libs.ratpoints import ratpoints
sage: 
sage: for x,y,z in ratpoints([1..6], 200):
....:     print -1*y^2 + 1*z^6 + 2*x*z^5 + 3*x^2*z^4 + 4*x^3*z^3 + 5*x^4*z^2 + 6*x^5*z
....:     
0
0
0
```

So the problem is simply that less points are found.  Sounds pretty serious...
