The point of this is that if you do

```
sage foo.sage > output.out
tail -f output.out
```

and use verbose(...) in foo.sage, you'll see nothing for a while, which sucks.

I am not completely sure if the above usage corresponds well to the intended workflow of the verbose function, but this concern should at least be considered before adding the mandatory flush statement. After all, the flush statement could just have been manually added in foo.sage.
