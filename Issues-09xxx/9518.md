John Cremona remarked on #9281 that Pari had a self test that could be run from `make test-all`, so an spkg-check file should be added to do this. I will take care of it. Hopefully John can review it.

Dave, I suggest that you leave this to be done as part of the #9343 upgrade.  I have already started working on this, including reporting some issues with the testing script upstream to par-dev.

I thought you would like this plan -- and pleasantly surprised to see that after fixing bugs they add tests to the suite.

No problem. 

I actually get some failures. I'll attach the spkg-check file as an attachment, since I'd already done it. It will save you the hassle. 

I actually get some failures on my OpenSolaris machine. In fact, whilst Sage builds on OpenSolaris, it crashes at startup. So perhaps I might look at Pari as a possible source of trouble.

I note there is an error in `spkg-install` The very first line has some unwanted characters, with what displays as "B1;2000;0c". 

I leave you to sort that out!
