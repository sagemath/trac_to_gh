Dave, I suggest that you leave this to be done as part of the #9343 upgrade.  I have already started working on this, including reporting some issues with the testing script upstream to par-dev.

I thought you would like this plan -- and pleasantly surprised to see that after fixing bugs they add tests to the suite.

No problem. 

I actually get some failures. I'll attach the spkg-check file as an attachment, since I'd already done it. It will save you the hassle. 

I actually get some failures on my OpenSolaris machine. In fact, whilst Sage builds on OpenSolaris, it crashes at startup. So perhaps I might look at Pari as a possible source of trouble.

Attachment [spkg-check](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket9518/spkg-check) by drkirkby created at 2010-07-16 17:56:48

I note there is an error in `spkg-install` The very first line has some unwanted characters, with what displays as "B1;2000;0c". 

I leave you to sort that out!

 

```

For an explanation of the errors see my post to pari-dev at http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/archives/pari-dev-1007/threads.html and Karim's reply which I have not yet absorbed.

I have been compiling pari and running its tests for about 20 years...
