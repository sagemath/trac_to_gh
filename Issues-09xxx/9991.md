 == The Problem ==
rubiks is failing to install. I believe it is believing the `install` program is the `GNU install`, whereas in fact IBM provide their own on AIX, which is not compatible. 

This is the first `install` program in the PATH

```
-bash-4.1$ command -v install
/usr/bin/install
```
We can see this is not the GNU install program. 

```
-bash-4.1$ /usr/bin/install -h
getopt: Not a recognized flag: h
Usage: install [-c DirectoryA] [-f DirectoryB] [-i] [-m] [-M Mode] [-O Owner]
               [-G Group] [-S] [-n DirectoryC] [-o] [-s] File [DirectoryX ...]
-bash-4.1$ /usr/bin/install --help
getopt: Not a recognized flag: -
getopt: Not a recognized flag: h
getopt: Not a recognized flag: e
getopt: Not a recognized flag: l
getopt: Not a recognized flag: p
Usage: install [-c DirectoryA] [-f DirectoryB] [-i] [-m] [-M Mode] [-O Owner]
               [-G Group] [-S] [-n DirectoryC] [-o] [-s] File [DirectoryX ...]

```

This results in some odd permission problems when rubiks tries to install itself:

```
gcc -O -DLARGE_MEM -DVERBOSE -o sizekoc2 sizekoc2.o
size sizekoc2
sizekoc2: 48541 + 2387 + 409577660 + 2525 + 77886 = 409708999
