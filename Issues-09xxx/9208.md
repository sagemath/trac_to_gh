## Hardware & associated software
* Sun Blade 1000
* 2 x 900 MHz UltraSPARC III+ CPUs
* 2 GB RAM
* Solaris 10 03/2005 (first release of Solaris 10)
* gcc 4.4.3 (uses Sun linker and assembler)

## Sage version and relevant software in Sage
This issue was discovered with Sage 4.4.3, which includes
* Freetype 2.5.5, which is also known as version 9.16.3 (see #9202 for more information about this rather strange version numbering used). 
* matplotlib 0.99.1


## The problem
As discussed here, 

http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/1d23bf8990fe06d?hl=en

'matplotlib' will find the system version of 'freetype2', rather than the one in Sage, as it relies on the 'pkg-config' command, to determine the version of freetype2, and what compiler options need to be used to link the required freetype2 library. 

Therefore, matplolib reports it is configured with version 9.7.3, which is an old version of freetype2 installed under /usr/sfw in Solaris 10 03/05. 

```
REQUIRED DEPENDENCIES
                  numpy: 1.3.0
              freetype2: 9.7.3
```
(freetype 9.7.3 is also known as version 2.1.9)

## The solution
The solution to this problem is to ensure pkg-config looks into the directory where Sage stores it's .pc files, which is 

``` 
$SAGE_LOCAL/lib/pkgconfig
```

rather than the default system directory. 

There we find 11 packages have configuration information

This is easy to resolve, by adding the following 4 lines to sage-env, which ensure pkg-config uses the Sage directory 

```
if [ -z "$PKG_CONFIG_PATH" ]; then
    PKG_CONFIG_PATH="$SAGE_LOCAL/lib/pkgconfig"
    export PKG_CONFIG_PATH 
fi
```

The variable PKG_CONFIG_PATH is used by the pkg-config command.

## The results
Once this is done, matplotlib reports the correction version of 'freetype' 

```
Not building any matplotlib graphical backends.

There is a typo in the patch: "leasat" -> "least".

Snow leopard has pkg-config (at least, mine does, but it might just come from macports...)

Incidentally, this will also probably solve some long-standing issues with macports and Sage, and may also solve the problem that generated the libpng12 kludge that we do.

Are you suggesting this gets reviewed and incorporated into Sage and you write another patch which rewrites sage-env if Sage is moved? If so, then this still needs reviewing.

Not sage-env.  See #9210 for the patch I talked about.

Yes.  Since I practically had the same patch, but you beat me to posting it, I think the review will be easy.

I didn't check for the existence of PKG_CONFIG_PATH, though.  In what situation will we not want to overwrite that variable?

In what situation will we not want to overwrite that variable?\n> \n> \n\nI must admit, I did consider whether it was appropriate to simply overwrite PKG_CONFIG_PATH and ignore whatever the user puts. But I could see some benefits in allowing the user to set this. \n\n* If I wanted to use a later version of a library that Sage has, I would be able to do so by putting my libraries in a location of my choosing, and let Sage find them first. \n\n* in some cases one might have libraries that Sage lacks, but one wants to use with programs like matplotlib. (GTK could be an exmaple of that). \n\nAnother possibility, is to prepend Sage's path to PKG_CONFIG_PATH, so things in Sage are found first, but others that exist on the system will be found too, since according to the man page of pkg-config on Solaris:\n\n```\nUser Commands                                       pkg-config(1)\n\nNAME\n     pkg-config  -  return  meta  information   about   installed\n     libraries\n<SNIP>\n     PKG_CONFIG_PATH         A   colon-separated   (on   Windows,\n                             semicolon-separated)  list of direc-\n                             tories to search for .pc files.  The\n                             default directory is always searched\n                             after searching the  path  specified\n                             by   PKG_CONFIG_PATH.   The  default\n                             value    of    PKG_CONFIG_PATH    is\n                             libdir/pkgconfig,  where  libdir  is\n                             the lib directory  where  pkg-config\n                             is  installed.  On  Solaris systems,\n                             libdir is /usr/lib.\n\n```\n\nPKG_CONFIG_PATH is a colon separated list of paths. Simply overwriting PKG_CONFIG_PATH would make it impossible for someone to get matplotlib to use their version of GTK for example in /usr/local, if they wanted that. \n\nDoing something about the issue with PKG_CONFIG_PATH is clearly better than doing noting at all, but what is best is a bit subjective.

I must admit, I did consider whether it was appropriate to simply overwrite PKG_CONFIG_PATH and ignore whatever the user puts. But I could see some benefits in allowing the user to set this. 

* If I wanted to use a later version of a library that Sage has, I would be able to do so by putting my libraries in a location of my choosing, and let Sage find them first. 

* in some cases one might have libraries that Sage lacks, but one wants to use with programs like matplotlib. (GTK could be an exmaple of that). 

Another possibility, is to prepend Sage's path to PKG_CONFIG_PATH, so things in Sage are found first, but others that exist on the system will be found too, since according to the man page of pkg-config on Solaris:

```
User Commands                                       pkg-config(1)

NAME
     pkg-config  -  return  meta  information   about   installed
     libraries
<SNIP>
     PKG_CONFIG_PATH         A   colon-separated   (on   Windows,
                             semicolon-separated)  list of direc-
                             tories to search for .pc files.  The
                             default directory is always searched
                             after searching the  path  specified
                             by   PKG_CONFIG_PATH.   The  default
                             value    of    PKG_CONFIG_PATH    is
                             libdir/pkgconfig,  where  libdir  is
                             the lib directory  where  pkg-config
                             is  installed.  On  Solaris systems,
                             libdir is /usr/lib.

```

PKG_CONFIG_PATH is a colon separated list of paths. Simply overwriting PKG_CONFIG_PATH would make it impossible for someone to get matplotlib to use their version of GTK for example in /usr/local, if they wanted that. 

Doing something about the issue with PKG_CONFIG_PATH is clearly better than doing noting at all, but what is best is a bit subjective. I don't have a strong opinion as to what is best. 

The solution here is the most flexible, as it gives the user complete control, but that flexibility does come at some risk. I suspect the risk is quite small, as I doubt many people set PKG_CONFIG_PATH themselves. If they do, they probably know what they are doing :)
