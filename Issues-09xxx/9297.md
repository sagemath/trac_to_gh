## Hardware & associated software

* Sun Blade 1000
* 2 x 900 MHz UltraSPARC III+ CPUs
* 2 GB RAM
* Solaris 10 03/2005 (first release of Solaris 10)
* gcc 4.4.3 (uses Sun linker and Sun assembler)
* Sage 4.4.4.alpha1
* #9041 to allow Python to build _socket. (Not needed on SPARC, but it was applied)
* #9295 to permit Python test suite to build. 

## Background
Although Sage 4.4.4.alpha1 builds fully on Solaris 10 (SPARC), there are some test failures of the Python test suite, which are discovered if SAGE_CHECK is exported to "yes", and #9295 included in Sage, which allows SAGE_CHECK to work with Python. 

## Summary of test results
Here are the summary of the test results. Although there are the same number of failures as observed on OpenSolaris x64 (64-bit), the failures are not always the same - there are some unique to OpenSolaris and some unique to Solaris 10. See #9299 for the OpenSolaris x64 (64-bit) failures of Python.

If you see this thread

http://groups.google.co.uk/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/b7856076ea5aefbd/8d381b77e4d461cb

where I asked people to test their python build, **everyone** who responded had one or more failures. `test_distutils` is a bit worrying, as everyone reported that failed for them. There was a report that the clean 2.6.5 source code passes this test, but I don't know for sure if the 2.6.4 in Sage passes this test. I think it does, in which case a patch in Sage, or the Sage build environment is screwing `test_disutils` up. 

I reported the `test_float` on Solaris upstream

http://bugs.python.org/issue9069

but that was found to be a bug in gcc >= 4.4.0, but has now been fixed in the gcc source code, so the next release should have the issue resolved. 

That still leaves a few python failures on Solaris that I've not resolved. 

I think people should create individual tickets for individual test failures, as there are many different failures on many peoples systems. But `test_disutils` is common to ever single report I see.

Oops, 

I mean `test_disutils` is common to every single report I see. 

If anyone has some time and wants to work on them, then `test_disutils` is probably the best test to start with, as it effects everyone. Or is is *affects* everyone? I always have problems with those words!

Replying to [drkirkby](#comment%3A8):
> It would be good if the Linux failures could be put on another ticket. Otherwise, this ticket will be just full of test results on every conceivable system.

Ok, my post was a bit verbose, too. I only wanted to stress that `zlib` and `distutils` failing is not specific to SunOS/Solaris (or SPARC).

> I've created tickets for 32-bit SPARC (this one) and OpenSolaris (#9299) 

Perhaps we should create meta-tickets for

* "Missing bits" (they differ from system to system, I don't know which of them might be relevant for Sage)

* Python testsuite failures

The former need not be a meta-ticket, perhaps just collecting brief reports from various platforms, and informational to users who wonder if Sage's functionality can be affected. This information should be put into the Wiki and Installation Guide later.
