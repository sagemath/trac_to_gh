This patch will implement abelian groups, both additive and multiplicative, finite and infinite, under a common abstract class, using machinery for quotients of modules over `ZZ`.  This will make subgroups, intersections of subgroups, isomorphism classes, and quotient groups possible.  Generators may be of any type, so long as they support the minimal operations required.

AAG is the class of additive abelian groups.  This is an infinite group with a subgroup and a quotient.  (Typically quotients lose the generators and are "generic" but not in this example.)

```
sage: A=AAG([3,4,0])
sage: A.gens()
((2, 3, 0), (0, 0, 1))
sage: A.0.order()
12
sage: A.1.order()
+Infinity
sage: B=A.subgroup([A.1])
sage: B
Infinite additive abelian group isomorphic to Z with generator(s): (0, 0, 1)
sage: C=A/B
sage: C
Finite additive abelian group isomorphic to Z_12 with generator(s): (2, 3, 0)
```

GUN is a constructor of Groups of Units Mod n.  It employs MAG, the class of multiplicative abelian groups.  This is an intersection of two subgroups, and then a Cayley table is free (in the category of multiplicative groups).

```
sage: G=GUN(72)
sage: G.list()
[1, 65, 49, 17, 25, 41, 55, 47, 31, 71, 7, 23, 37, 29, 13, 53, 61, 5, 19, 11, 67, 35, 43, 59]
sage: G.subgroup([71,7])
Finite multiplicative abelian group isomorphic to Z_2 + Z_6 with generator(s): 55, 65
sage: K=G.subgroup([71,7])
sage: K.list()
[1, 65, 49, 17, 25, 41, 55, 47, 31, 71, 7, 23]
sage: L=G.subgroup([13,7])
sage: L
Finite multiplicative abelian group isomorphic to Z_2 + Z_6 with generator(s): 55, 61
sage: L.list()
[1, 61, 49, 37, 25, 13, 55, 43, 31, 19, 7, 67]
sage: M=K.intersection(L)
sage: M.list()
[1, 7, 49, 55, 25, 31]
sage: M
Finite multiplicative abelian group isomorphic to Z_6 with generator(s): 7
sage: M.cayley_table()
*  a b c d e f
 +------------
a| a b c d e f
b| b c d e f a
c| c d e f a b
d| d e f a b c
e| e f a b c d
f| f a b c d e
```

This is an example from the current additive abelian wrapper class.  It shows the generators keyword allowing arbitrary elements to form the group, so long as they know how to add.  GUN above is similar, but with multiplication.


```
sage: E = EllipticCurve('30a2')
sage: pts = [E(4,-7,1), E(7/4, -11/8, 1), E(3, -2, 1)]
sage: M=AAG([3,2,2], generators=pts)
sage: M.list()
[(0 : 1 : 0), (13 : -52 : 1), (4 : -7 : 1), (3 : -2 : 1), (4 : 2 : 1), (13 : 38 : 1), (7/4 : -11/8 : 1), (1 : -4 : 1), (-2 : -7 : 1), (-5 : 2 : 1), (-2 : 8 : 1), (1 : 2 : 1)]
sage: M.gens()
((7/4 : -11/8 : 1), (13 : -52 : 1))
sage: N=M.subgroup([M.1])
sage: N
Finite additive abelian group isomorphic to Z_6 with generator(s): (13 : -52 : 1)
sage: N.list()
[(0 : 1 : 0), (13 : -52 : 1), (4 : -7 : 1), (3 : -2 : 1), (4 : 2 : 1), (13 : 38 : 1)]
```

There is lots to do here still: different filenames, different class names, error-checking, doctests, comparisons, and so on.  But the code seems to be working.  I'm not 100% confident on the `__call__` method of the main abstract class and I don't know if I need some things to support coercion better.  Any advice or comments at this stage would be appreciated before I begin to clean this all up.

Will this interact at all with the class `CombinatorialFreeModule`?  I don't know what the long term plans are, or even if there are any, for connecting this with `FreeModule`, but the combinatorial version has some nice features.

Also, how do you define **R** or **Q** as additive abelian groups with this setup?

Hi John,

Thanks for the good questions.  I began this when I tried to implement a multiplicative group in concert with the work at #6449.  So I really didn't even have groups like **R** and **Q** in mind.  Truth-in-advertising would suggest I sprinkle in some "finitely generated" qualifiers in class names and filenames.

I've plugged this into the categories framework as groups, but hadn't thought about modules.  I'll go take a look at all that to see how this might fit in.  Maybe Nicolas Thiery will have some ideas as well.

I looked at these two classes.  Generally they seem to require the same ring in each "component", whereas the FGP_Module class allows for diffferent rings in each component, such as in creating something like Z_3 x Z_4.  So I don't see an abvious way to leverage these, but maybe I'm missing something.

Code is stablizing in draft 2 patch, and I'm starting to write the doctests.  Still uncertain about `__call__` and now its interactions with `__contains__`.

There are liberal comments in the code and the `units_modn` module has a rather complete demo of functionality.

We won't beat Magma, but we won't be embarassed on really small examples.  This patch does not have a `subgroups()` method yet, but could be easy to add.\n\nFull details at #10181.

Replying to [@zimmermann6](#comment%3A8):
> Question: does this patch solve #10181?

Short answer:  this could speed up `subgroups()` by a factor of 8, if my experiments are right.  We won't beat Magma, but we won't be embarassed on really small examples.  This patch does not have a `subgroups()` method yet, but could be easy to add.

Full details at #10181.  Thanks for asking.

Rob

Justin - no documentation to speak of, but look at the derived classes to get a feel for how this might work.

Any insights or ideas you might have would be helpful before I try to finish this off later this spring.

I keep plugging away at this.  Some improvement by exploiting category code.  Totally reworked, so most of my comments above are obsolete.

Draft 4 patch is very functional, with the following caveats that I cannot figure out.  Assistance greatly appreciated if you can provide advice or specific pointers.  There is quite a bit of functionality demonstrated in the module-level doctests.  Little or no error-checking yet.

1.  `_element_constructor()` works fine with module elements, which is to be expected, since it is copied verbatim from there.  I cannot seem to make it accept reasonable elements of the parent of the generators for subsequent processing without totally breaking extensive doctests.

draft-4 failed to include "__init__.py" in the patch - that has been corrected in draft-5.

David Roe helped me rework the initialization of the module class, so now the test suite is not doing additive tests on the multiplicative classes.  And I also believe I understand the problems with the element constructor (again with David's help).  So I think I'm over the hump on this one now.
