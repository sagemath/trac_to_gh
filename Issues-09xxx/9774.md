<a id='comment:2'></a>I've been experimenting a bit with `MathJax`, outside of the notebook.  Mostly thinking about how it will handle tex4ht output in jsMath mode, but here are some some observations that might be useful:

1.  Easier in most ways to structure a page to use `MathJax`.  Just insert something like

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="path-to-MathJax/MathJax.js"></script>
```

No need for a "process()" call at the end, etc.


2.  Default is to not recognize single dollar-signs as delimiters.  Alternative is  `\(..\)`.  This would be a good thing, since if a user adds text (via TinyMCE) right now jsMath tries to parse the following as math.  `$$..$$` and  `\[..\]` both work for display math.  We would break lots of old worksheets if we stopped recognizing `$..$`.

3.  There is a jsMath compatibility mode.  I believe I've found one bug in this already (reported upstream).  I'd imagine this is not a development priority, but who knows?

4.  Modes and configuration is controlled globally by  `config/MathJax.js`  which is just one huge well-commented Javascript object.  It can be overridden in a web page by adding a new version into the script block mentioned above.  Maybe we want to make this easy for users to access, or maybe it is easy already, or maybe we don't want to bother.

5.  This looks to me like the best introduction to the types of decisions we will want to make about what to cut over to:
http://www.mathjax.org/resources/docs/?configuration.html

6.  `MathJax` is HUGE.  Fonts for lots of Unicode points, I guess.  SVN checkout is 53 MB, after unzipping  fonts.zip  it all occupies  171 MB.

7.  I just noticed this morning that `html.table()` uses  `class="math"` which is a jsMath way to tag span's or div's for processing.  I haven't found how to do something similiar in `MathJax`, though this will work in jsMath compatibility mode.  A very small test would indicate that the two modes can be used at the same time.

8.  Consonant with (2) and (7), I'd love to see the notebook formatting move to something closer to rigorous XML (ie XHTML, I guess).  Certain types of processing would be easier if we did, but that is not really what this ticket is all about.

<a id='comment:14'></a>Steps that will install `MathJax` with the new Flask notebook.  

1. Install the Flask version of the notebook.
   {{{
   http://code.google.com/r/rkirov-flask/
   }}}

2. Download v1.1 of `MathJax` as zip file (from bottom of page).
   {{{
   http://www.mathjax.org/download/
   }}}

3.  Unzip the MathJax distribution into

   $SAGE_ROOT/devel/sagenb/sagenb/data

   and

   rename the new directory: `mathjax-MathJax-5a7e4d7` (or whatever)

   to be just the directory:  `MathJax`

4.  jsmath compatibility.  Edit
   {{{
   $SAGE_ROOT/devel/sagenb/sagenb/data/MathJax/config/default.js
   }}}
   by adding "`jsMath2jax.js`" as the first entry of the "extensions" list, so it becomes
   {{{
   extensions: ["jsMath2jax.js", "tex2jax.js"]
   }}}

5. Edit
   {{{
   $SAGE_ROOT/devel/sagenb/sagenb/data/sage/html/notebook/base.html
   }}}
   and change
   {{{
   <script type="text/javascript" src="/javascript/sage/jsmath.js"></script>
   }}}
   to
   {{{
   <script type="text/javascript" src="/static/MathJax/MathJax.js?config=default"></script>
   }}}


This will install `MathJax` and the notebook will use it.  But the setup is buggy, so needs work.  I'm sure there is some configuration on the Sage side and/or the `MathJax` side that will need changes.

* A mix of black and green symbols.

* Only renders on a reload - adding new TeX via TinyMCE returns with an error about not finding fonts.

* Some stray tags are being rendered, or something.

Screenshots attached:

Double Integral:

http://wiki.math.toronto.edu/TorontoMathWiki/index.php/JsMath/MathJax_%28TeX_for_Web%29

```
$$ (2\pi h)^{-d}\iint_{\{H(x,\xi) <\tau\}} dx d\xi $$
```

Matrix:

```
$\begin{bmatrix}
x^2 & y^2\\
x^3 & \cos(z)
\end{bmatrix}$
```

Yes, same situation - "old" file could be removed.

"file-add-two" should create the missing file.  Sorry about all the problems - my `hg status` is useless with the hg mess-up.

This file will require an edit when we move from CDN to spkg.

Thank-you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<a id='comment:30'></a>In the current version of [attachment:mathjax.patch], look at the top of the file for some unfinished business.  For example, the pathname at the end of doc/common/themes/sage/static/mathjax_sage.js_t might be wrong, which might break MathJax in the Sphinx documentation.

<a id='comment:31'></a>In the current state, the --mathjax  switch seems to work with a build of the html version of the reference manual.

Mathematics in the documentation is being wrapped with `\(, \)` pairs, which are the default MathJax delimiters for inline mathematics.  However these snippets are not being rendered when viewed in a browser.

In the page source of a page of the html documentation, I see a script in a file named `mathjax_sage.js` which we are not generating.  We do have `jsmath_sage.js` lying about in the doc directories, which have the full jsmath configuration information.  So this likely needs repair before an HTML documentation page with MathJax support is built properly.

<a id='comment:33'></a>In a page of the documentation, I inserted manually

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS_HTML-full">
```

and the mathematics rendered properly with MathJax.

Then I installed the mathjax 1.1a distribution alongside jsmath in the Flask notebook tree and used

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS_HTML-full">
```

which also caused the math to render properly.  (/sage/notebook is my `SAGE_ROOT`)

In both cases the fonts did not look too great to my eye.

Questions:

(a) How do we get these scripts commands to be placed properly in each page of the docs, with a proper relative path?

(b) Is there really a clean separation between Sage and the notebook if  --mathjax  mode for documentation requires the MathJax code from the notebook?

Another option would be to try to get Sphinx to write this into each html file:

```
<script type="text/x-mathjax-config">
[contents of mathjax_sage.js]
</script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="_static/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS_HTML-full"></script>

We can get the last line by specifing mathjax_path in conf.py, but I don't know how to get the first part.

I'll keep working on it...

Er, no, I don't, unfortunately. You can get such a diff by doing `hg qfinish` on my patch on top of 4.8.alpha6, then `hg up 4.8.alpha4`, then `hg qimport -P [your patch]`, then `hg diff -r tip -r [revid of my patch]` (you would probably want to `hg strip [revid of my patch]` later).

rebased patch to sage-5.1beta2.

There is however a very weird problem with mathjax, both 1.0 and 2.0 branches. The math is not rendered as long as the sagenb directory is under `DOT_SAGE`. To reproduce, try the steps below. Use any branch (mathjax-1 or mathjax-2) for instance jasongrout/mathjax (mathjax-1) in github.
1. `mkdir /tmp/a`
2. `DOT_SAGE=/tmp/a sage -n`.
3. First, note that the above command launches the nb in port 8000 instead of 8080. But if we use some other command such as the one below, then it does open in port 8080.

```
sage -n directory=/tmp/a.sagenb
```
4. Open a new worksheet, and try to print latex, for instance run the command `view('?')`. You will get a js error popup saying (in Opera 12.00RC, and Opera-11.64)

```
SyntaxError: at index 0 in "\newcommand{\Bold}[1]{\mathbf{#1}}?": invalid character escape sequence
```

In firefox-10.0.4 I simply get the error: `SyntaxError: illegal character`. This error is not present if I run sage instead as `sage -n directory=/tmp/a.sagenb`, and the mathjax output is all good.

Has he applied the mathjax patches to the sage repo? Without those patches it won't work. And these patches were not applying for quite sometime. I just updated one today.

There are more changes to make actually. `SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/doc` has lots of jsmath references, which all need to be converted to mathjax.

If you can independently confirm the behavior in comment:65 then it will be good.

The problems with the tutorial are a bit more involved, since (a) it explicitly discusses using JSMath and (b) I don't speak German.

I don't understand the matrix0.pyx problem at all, at least not yet.
