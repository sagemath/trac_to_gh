<a id='comment:2'>Comment 2:</a>
I've been experimenting a bit with `MathJax`, outside of the notebook.  Mostly thinking about how it will handle tex4ht output in jsMath mode, but here are some some observations that might be useful:

1.  Easier in most ways to structure a page to use `MathJax`.  Just insert something like

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="path-to-MathJax/MathJax.js"></script>
```

No need for a "process()" call at the end, etc.


2.  Default is to not recognize single dollar-signs as delimiters.  Alternative is  `\(..\)`.  This would be a good thing, since if a user adds text (via TinyMCE) right now jsMath tries to parse the following as math.  `$$..$$` and  `\[..\]` both work for display math.  We would break lots of old worksheets if we stopped recognizing `$..$`.

3.  There is a jsMath compatibility mode.  I believe I've found one bug in this already (reported upstream).  I'd imagine this is not a development priority, but who knows?

4.  Modes and configuration is controlled globally by  `config/MathJax.js`  which is just one huge well-commented Javascript object.  It can be overridden in a web page by adding a new version into the script block mentioned above.  Maybe we want to make this easy for users to access, or maybe it is easy already, or maybe we don't want to bother.

5.  This looks to me like the best introduction to the types of decisions we will want to make about what to cut over to:
http://www.mathjax.org/resources/docs/?configuration.html

6.  `MathJax` is HUGE.  Fonts for lots of Unicode points, I guess.  SVN checkout is 53 MB, after unzipping  fonts.zip  it all occupies  171 MB.

7.  I just noticed this morning that `html.table()` uses  `class="math"` which is a jsMath way to tag span's or div's for processing.  I haven't found how to do something similiar in `MathJax`, though this will work in jsMath compatibility mode.  A very small test would indicate that the two modes can be used at the same time.

8.  Consonant with (2) and (7), I'd love to see the notebook formatting move to something closer to rigorous XML (ie XHTML, I guess).  Certain types of processing would be easier if we did, but that is not really what this ticket is all about.

[MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org/) is very impressive looking. I like the idea the user does not have to have any fonts installed on his computer, which is a major advantage over [jsMath](http://www.math.union.edu/~dpvc/jsMath/)

Steps that will install `MathJax` with the new Flask notebook.  

1. Install the Flask version of the notebook.

    ```
    http://code.google.com/r/rkirov-flask/
   ```

2. Download v1.1 of `MathJax` as zip file (from bottom of page).

    ```
    http://www.mathjax.org/download/
   ```

3.  Unzip the MathJax distribution into

   $SAGE_ROOT/devel/sagenb/sagenb/data

   and

   rename the new directory: `mathjax-MathJax-5a7e4d7` (or whatever)

   to be just the directory:  `MathJax`

4.  jsmath compatibility.  Edit

    ```
    $SAGE_ROOT/devel/sagenb/sagenb/data/MathJax/config/default.js
   ```
   by adding "`jsMath2jax.js`" as the first entry of the "extensions" list, so it becomes

    ```
    extensions: ["jsMath2jax.js", "tex2jax.js"]
   ```

5. Edit

    ```
    $SAGE_ROOT/devel/sagenb/sagenb/data/sage/html/notebook/base.html
   ```
   and change

    ```
    <script type="text/javascript" src="/javascript/sage/jsmath.js"></script>
   ```
   to

    ```
    <script type="text/javascript" src="/static/MathJax/MathJax.js?config=default"></script>
   ```


This will install `MathJax` and the notebook will use it.  But the setup is buggy, so needs work.  I'm sure there is some configuration on the Sage side and/or the `MathJax` side that will need changes.

* A mix of black and green symbols.

* Only renders on a reload - adding new TeX via TinyMCE returns with an error about not finding fonts.

* Some stray tags are being rendered, or something.

Screenshots attached:

Double Integral:

```
$$ (2\pi h)^{-d}\iint_{\{H(x,\xi) <\tau\}} dx d\xi $$
```

Matrix:

```
$\begin{bmatrix}
x^2 & y^2\\
x^3 & \cos(z)
\end{bmatrix}$
```

Added patch to Flask notebook code to support `MathJax`, built with Davide Cervone's help.

1.  This is a hand-edited patch to recover from an hg mess-up.  I think it is OK, but be wary.
2.  Fonts are coming from `MathJax` CDN.  Comment in code indicates change for local `MathJax` installation.
3.  `<script>` tags added by Palmieri's Sage library patch need to be handled with care on notebook side, so notebook does not evaluate them.  Right now when "Typeset" box is checked, evaluated cells raise a Javascript error in `evaluate_script_tags` (or a function with a similar name).

Yes, same situation - "old" file could be removed.

"file-add-two" should create the missing file.  Sorry about all the problems - my `hg status` is useless with the hg mess-up.

This file will require an edit when we move from CDN to spkg.

The problem with the Sage notebook code intercepting (and evaluating) the contents of `<script>,</script>` tags can probably be rectified in one, or both, of the functions of the Flask notebook:

```
In sagenb/data/sage/js/notebook_lib.js:

eval_script_tags

In the current state, the --mathjax  switch seems to work with a build of the html version of the reference manual.

Mathematics in the documentation is being wrapped with `\(, \)` pairs, which are the default MathJax delimiters for inline mathematics.  However these snippets are not being rendered when viewed in a browser.

In the page source of a page of the html documentation, I see a script in a file named `mathjax_sage.js` which we are not generating.  We do have `jsmath_sage.js` lying about in the doc directories, which have the full jsmath configuration information.  So this likely needs repair before an HTML documentation page with MathJax support is built properly.

In a page of the documentation, I inserted manually

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS_HTML-full">
```

and the mathematics rendered properly with MathJax.

Then I installed the mathjax 1.1a distribution alongside jsmath in the Flask notebook tree and used

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS_HTML-full">
```

which also caused the math to render properly.  (/sage/notebook is my `SAGE_ROOT`)

In both cases the fonts did not look too great to my eye.

Questions:

(a) How do we get these scripts commands to be placed properly in each page of the docs, with a proper relative path?

(b) Is there really a clean separation between Sage and the notebook if  --mathjax  mode for documentation requires the MathJax code from the notebook?

By the way, one comment about the latest version of my patch: it fixes the problem Rob mentioned about getting the appropriate invocation to MathJax in each piece of documentation.  It does this by setting the variable `mathjax_path` to

```
file://[path to MathJax.js]?config=TeX-AMS_HTML-full,file://[path to mathjax_sage.js]
```
The paths here are absolute ones, in `SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/doc/output/html/en/_static/`.  This directory is created by `sage -docbuild website html`, so now if you build the docs with the `-j` flag (to enable MathJax), it first builds the website target, then builds whatever you requested.  There might be a better way to do this, using relative paths, but I couldn't get it to work.    For example, using 

```
    <script type="text/javascript" src="_static/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS_HTML-full"></script>
```
successfully turns on MathJax, but without the local configuration turning on the custom macros.  Using

```
    <script type="text/javascript" src="_static/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS_HTML-full,mathjax_sage.js"></script>
```
doesn't work, nor does any variation of it that I tried.  (Note that when you change the path specifying the local configuration file, you also need to change the last line of that configuration file to match it, according to [http://www.mathjax.org/docs/1.1/configuration.html](http://www.mathjax.org/docs/1.1/configuration.html).)  If we could copy the file `mathjax_sage.js` to `_static/config/local/`, then we could use 

```
    <script type="text/javascript" src="_static/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS_HTML-full,local/mathjax_sage.js"></script>
```
for the invocation, and 

```
MathJax.Ajax.loadComplete("[MathJax]/config/local/mathjax_sage.js")
```
for the last line in mathjax_sage.js.  But I don't know how to put this file in the right place: it's autogenerated, so we can't put it in the MathJax local directory ahead of time, and I can't figure out how to get Sphinx to do it when it's building the documentation.

Another option would be to try to get Sphinx to write this into each html file:

```
<script type="text/x-mathjax-config">
[contents of mathjax_sage.js]
</script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="_static/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS_HTML-full"></script>
```
We can get the last line by specifing mathjax_path in conf.py, but I don't know how to get the first part.

I'll keep working on it...

Hi John,

Are you testing with the Flask notebook?  If not, it might be easier to build what look like absolute paths to the MathJax files in the data directory of the notebook, because of the way Flask sets up paths with the "route()" command?  I can't tell if this will solve the problem you are wrestling with or not.

The `<script>` tags were being messed with by the notebook on the server side just before being dispatched.  But then the client sees two versions - wrapped and unwrapped, and totally trashes one of them to prevent running a script twice.  I thought Jason had a patch for this too, but I haven't seen it.  The symptom would be when you cycle through wrap, no-wrap, and hide for some output, then one of them is missing.  I guess we can press on and fix this eventually.

About to go off-line shortly for the long weekend, but will come back to this when I can stick with it.

I stalled working on it because of other time pressures with the single-cell, but also because I realized that the *next* version of Sphinx supports Mathjax out of the box, while I thought the current version would require patches.

I think that the implementation of MathJax in Sphinx comes from the file mathjax.py, which is available for download separately.  So my patch just adds it.

I'm attaching another version ("v2") of my patch; this one writes the MathJax local configuration file to a file in `SAGE_ROOT/local/lib/python/site-libraries/sagenb.../`, which may not be a good idea.  But it allows for a simpler invocation of MathJax.  I'm really not sure which approach is better.

The last patch involving MathJax, that I rebased from the ones here is on google code:

http://code.google.com/p/sagenb/issues/detail?id=46

Unless Jonathan Gutow did something else on top of it, this is latest work.

You don't happen to have your changes as a separate patch on top of mine, do you?  I'd love to review your changes, but it's a bit hard to see where your additions are.

If you don't have it, I'll just diff the two patches, but that's a little harder to read than a separate patch.

rebased patch to sage-5.1beta2.

There is however a very weird problem with mathjax, both 1.0 and 2.0 branches. The math is not rendered as long as the sagenb directory is under `DOT_SAGE`. To reproduce, try the steps below. Use any branch (mathjax-1 or mathjax-2) for instance jasongrout/mathjax (mathjax-1) in github.
1. `mkdir /tmp/a`
2. `DOT_SAGE=/tmp/a sage -n`.
3. First, note that the above command launches the nb in port 8000 instead of 8080. But if we use some other command such as the one below, then it does open in port 8080.

```
sage -n directory=/tmp/a.sagenb
```
4. Open a new worksheet, and try to print latex, for instance run the command `view('?')`. You will get a js error popup saying (in Opera 12.00RC, and Opera-11.64)

```
SyntaxError: at index 0 in "\newcommand{\Bold}[1]{\mathbf{#1}}?": invalid character escape sequence
```

In firefox-10.0.4 I simply get the error: `SyntaxError: illegal character`. This error is not present if I run sage instead as `sage -n directory=/tmp/a.sagenb`, and the mathjax output is all good.

Has he applied the mathjax patches to the sage repo? Without those patches it won't work. And these patches were not applying for quite sometime. I just updated one today.

There are more changes to make actually. `SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/doc` has lots of jsmath references, which all need to be converted to mathjax.

If you can independently confirm the behavior in [comment:65](#comment%3A65) then it will be good.

Fantastic news!

This was merged in the notebook at [this github pull request](https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/pull/30), just for completeness.

Since #11080 is for Sage 5.2, this should be too.

The problem with sphinxify is easy to fix. Should we delete jsmath.py, or is it still needed for something?

The problems with the tutorial are a bit more involved, since (a) it explicitly discusses using JSMath and (b) I don't speak German.

I don't understand the matrix0.pyx problem at all, at least not yet.

In the

No, we'll (I'll) do it manually. SPKGs being autogenerated is at odds with having repositories for SPKGs.

I have written scripts which at least simplify the process, though - they create a directory which can be used as the new SPKG's `src/` directory without modification of the `spkg-install` script.

Can you tell which part is "weird"? Is it the braces around ``\mapsto``? If I remove those braces, it works with both jsMath and MathJax.

I wish I could tell you!  I didn't write it.  I was just trying to point this out, in case it was clear to someone else.  If it's not clear what the problem is, maybe we leave the comment in?  Maybe Jason can explain.

Also, both representations have the braces, and braces are fine for demarcating things in TeX, so I don't think that's the issue.  hg blame says that this dates from before the symbolics switch to Pynac.

Anyway, not a huge deal, but pointing it out.

This document does not compile anymore with SageTeX

```
\documentclass[12pt,letterpaper]{article}
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
\usepackage[english]{babel}
\usepackage{sagetex}
\begin{document}
$\sage{"1 2"}$
\end{document}
```
because someone has replaced a verbatim spacer with a version that does not work, as was explicitly explained in the surrounding comment, and then deleted the comment altogether:

```diff

@@ -323,11 +323,7 @@
     # 2) wrap each line into \verb;

     lines = []

What was the motivation for this???

Do you by chance see who changed it?  If it was me, I don't recall the motivation.  So +1 to making sure things work.

It is in the jumbo patch to Sage library uploaded by Keshav, I guess it is a flattening of others. Most of it was automatic, I imagine, but this part is definitely made by hand.
