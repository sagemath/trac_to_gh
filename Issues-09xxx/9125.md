This patch adds more examples of simplicial complexes: real projective spaces (that is, RP<sup>d</sup> for any positive d), CP<sup>2</sup>, and the Poincare homology sphere.  Some of these are the minimal triangulations, some are not; see the documentation.

These are important test cases for homology and other computations which I hope will be implemented soon -- see tickets #6102 and #6103, for instance.

A very useful patch the documentation is very good.

The doc tests all run and the functionality seems correct.


I have been working on a function to generate simplicial complexes for the lens spaces. Although the implimentation is naive would it be something which would be useful to put in this patch?

Hi thank you jdemeyer this is my first time contributing directly to sage and I am not sure of all the procedures.

Is there anything else I should do?

On the same Pentium 4 system, the following test

```
sage:P4 = simplicial_complexes.RealProjectiveSpace(4)
```
takes almost 4 seconds, so that should also be # long time (and hence also the following tests involving P4).

I'll do that, but are you using specific guidelines about what constitutes "long"?  On a 2-year-old iMac, it takes about 10 seconds to doctest the whole file ("sage -t examples.py", not "sage -t -long").  That doesn't seem excessively long to me, especially since the machine isn't new, and it wasn't a top-of-the line machine even when it was new.
