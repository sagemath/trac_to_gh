This patch adds more examples of simplicial complexes: real projective spaces (that is, RP<sup>d</sup> for any positive d), CP<sup>2</sup>, and the Poincare homology sphere.  Some of these are the minimal triangulations, some are not; see the documentation.

These are important test cases for homology and other computations which I hope will be implemented soon -- see tickets #6102 and #6103, for instance.

I have been working on a function to generate simplicial complexes for the lens spaces. Although the implimentation is naive would it be something which would be useful to put in this patch?

I'll do that, but are you using specific guidelines about what constitutes "long"?  On a 2-year-old iMac, it takes about 10 seconds to doctest the whole file ("sage -t examples.py", not "sage -t -long").  That doesn't seem excessively long to me, especially since the machine isn't new, and it wasn't a top-of-the line machine even when it was new.
