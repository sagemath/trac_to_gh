<a id='comment:4'></a>Okay, one issue is that this depends on some other ticket which may or may not get reviewed.

```

    def __init__(self, f, xrange, yrange, zrange,

?  I guess someone could still pass in 'smooth', though it seems like then this should be deprecated as an option - or we should have prominent TODO to add it.  But also

```

        if smooth and gradient is None:
```
it seems like we should just get rid of this whole thing, since smooth will never be True.

Anyway, because I don't quite understand those things, I'm putting `needs_info`, but it seems good overall - and I apologize for any ignorance on my part.  

On the plus side, it does get rid of the traceback as advertised!  For some reason I don't have 3d plotting on the computer I'm checking this one (old Java?), but that's still pretty good.
