Okay, one issue is that this depends on some other ticket which may or may not get reviewed.

And I think I see why this fix works, sort of - when smooth is True, MarchingCubesTriangles calls the gradient, though presumably smooth was already False - this seems weird to me.  But why not make the change at

```

    def __init__(self, f, xrange, yrange, zrange,
                 contour=0, plot_points="automatic",
                 region=None, smooth=True, gradient=None, vertex_color=None,
                 **kwds):
```
?  I guess someone could still pass in 'smooth', though it seems like then this should be deprecated as an option - or we should have prominent TODO to add it.  But also

```

        if smooth and gradient is None:
```
it seems like we should just get rid of this whole thing, since smooth will never be True.

Anyway, because I don't quite understand those things, I'm putting `needs_info`, but it seems good overall - and I apologize for any ignorance on my part.  

On the plus side, it does get rid of the traceback as advertised!  For some reason I don't have 3d plotting on the computer I'm checking this one (old Java?), but that's still pretty good.

When I first wrote the code, I had the idea to create a direct-to-tachyon backend that would use vertex normals to create much nicer-looking plots with smaller numbers of plot_points, and laid the groundwork for this backend with the gradient and smooth arguments.

Otherwise this works (my work computer apparently has good enough Java, and I don't know why I didn't think of using tachyon last night), though I'm still mystified why having it in the `options` dict didn't work but this does.
