Okay, one issue is that this depends on some other ticket which may or may not get reviewed.

And I think I see why this fix works, sort of - when smooth is True, MarchingCubesTriangles calls the gradient, though presumably smooth was already False - this seems weird to me.  But why not make the change at

```

    def __init__(self, f, xrange, yrange, zrange,
                 contour=0, plot_points="automatic",
                 region=None, smooth=True, gradient=None, vertex_color=None,
                 **kwds):
```
?  I guess someone could still pass in 'smooth', though it seems like then this should be deprecated as an option - or we should have prominent TODO to add it.  But also

```

        if smooth and gradient is None:
```
it seems like we should just get rid of this whole thing, since smooth will never be True.

Anyway, because I don't quite understand those things, I'm putting `needs_info`, but it seems good overall - and I apologize for any ignorance on my part.  

On the plus side, it does get rid of the traceback as advertised!  For some reason I don't have 3d plotting on the computer I'm checking this one (old Java?), but that's still pretty good.

When I first wrote the code, I had the idea to create a direct-to-tachyon backend that would use vertex normals to create much nicer-looking plots with smaller numbers of plot_points, and laid the groundwork for this backend with the gradient and smooth arguments.  But I abandoned the code without writing this backend (and leaving many other parts of the code unfinished).

When William Cauchois took over and finished the code (thank you, William!), he only wrote an `IndexFaceSet` backend, that can't (currently) make use of vertex normals.  So the gradient code is currently useless.

It would make me sad, but I wouldn't object if the gradient code were removed altogether.  I do think it basically works, though, and it's still open for somebody to write a direct-to-tachyon backend, or to extend `IndexFaceSet` to support vertex normals...

I totally don't think we should get rid of good code, but I think that if this is what is going on, before we get a positive review here there should be some additional comments near where the `smooth` parameter first shows up that says approximately what you do here - what the parameter is for, where one would extend it, etc.  The `IndexFaceSet` file has one tiny TODO that mentions this, which is also not too helpful.

Otherwise this works (my work computer apparently has good enough Java, and I don't know why I didn't think of using tachyon last night), though I'm still mystified why having it in the `options` dict didn't work but this does.
