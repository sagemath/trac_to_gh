With vanilla Sage 4.5.**alpha3**, all doctests passed on that system (same with alpha4 on Ubuntu 9.04 x86_64, gcc 4.5.0; `ptestlong`).

I've copied `sagenb-0.8.1.spkg` and `zodb3-3.7.0.p4.spkg` (#9436) to `spkg/standard`, built Sage, applied #7379 (Sage library patch for sagenb 0.8.1), run `./sage -b`, rebuilt the documentation and then started the test.

I blindly guess there won't come up further errors originating from the new sagenb package.

I don't know if this is sufficient, but after forcing reinstallation of Tim's corrected SageNB package, `./sage -t -sagenb` and `./sage -t -long -sagenb` (there seem to be no `long` tests) passed all tests, especially the (only) one that previously failed.

So I can give it a **positive review**, unless somebody tells me what further tests should be performed.

I'll test it on Ubuntu 9.04 x86_64 tomorrow.

I've successfully built Sage 4.5.alpha4 with SageNB 0.8.1 and zodb3 3.7.0.p4 (#9436), both sequentially and in parallel (`SAGE_PARALLEL_SPKG_BUILD="yes", MAKE="make -j4"`).

No downloads during install, HTML documentation builds (except missing `conf.py` in `thematic_tutorials`), and all long tests passed (`make ptestlong`).

All builds/tests performed independently, i.e. from scratch.

Leaving as "needs review" since IMHO tests by others on other platforms should follow.
