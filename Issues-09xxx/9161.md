Spkg here:

 http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/wstein/patches/nzmath-1.0.0.spkg

The SPKG.txt should probably be formated more.  However, note that the nzmath0.6.0 spkg in our current repo doesn't even have an SPKG.txt!

I would like to make this available soon, so I can post a response on the number theory list.

Forgot to say this, but I think only my changes need review at this point, I'm happy with the spkg otherwise.
