There are at least two failed reports of Sage failing to build properly if there is an installation of python in /usr/local

where an installation in /usr/local of python screws up Sage. 

In my own case, the only way I could find to stop the installation in /usr/local preventing Sage building, was to execute as root

```
# chmod 000 /usr/local/lib/libpython2.6.a /usr/local/lib/python2.6
```

Clearly that is not a good method and would be unavailable to many people.
