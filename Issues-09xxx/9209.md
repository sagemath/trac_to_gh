There are at least two failed reports of Sage failing to build properly if there is an installation of python in /usr/local

* http://groups.google.com/group/sage-solaris/browse_thread/thread/5dcc7ed68d279f67?hl=en
* http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/37a67ce63e68d55b?hl=en-GB

where an installation in /usr/local of python screws up Sage. 

In my own case, the only way I could find to stop the installation in /usr/local preventing Sage building, was to execute as root

```
# chmod 000 /usr/local/lib/libpython2.6.a /usr/local/lib/python2.6
```

Clearly that is not a good method and would be unavailable to many people.
