    sage: ComplexReflectionGroup(1,1,5)
    WeylGroup of type A4

    sage: W = ComplexReflectionGroup(33); W
    returns the 33 rd exceptional group

    sage: W.diagram()
```

Note: the current implementation of Coxeter groups is in principle
designed to open the door for such generalizations; see in particular
the WeylGroup code for Coxeter groups implemented in terms of matrix
groups.
