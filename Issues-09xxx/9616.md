In 4.5.2.alpha1, we have for many people:

```
sage -t -long "devel/sage/sage/parallel/decorate.py"        


------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred in Sage.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* component
of Sage has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
or is not properly wrapped with _sig_on, _sig_off.
You might want to run Sage under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
Sage will now terminate (sorry).

Adapting the procedure in [comment:ticket:9583:47 this comment] at #9583, I've attached a patch that undoes (or should undo) all of #9501.  If the patch gets a positive review, we can open a new ticket for re-merging #9501.

Hmmm, of course a simple procedure, but we'd back out too much in my opinion...

But I can live with that. (And I'm currently too (laz|bus)y to sort out the desirable parts of the original patch.)

Couldn't resist though (simpler as expected).

Not very tested, only successfully ran `./sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/parallel/` and rebuilt the documentation without errors or warnings.
(Ubuntu 9.04 x86_64, Core2, gcc 4.3.3)

So now two concurrent patches to review... ;-)

I don't know if I'll get to leif's patch.

Since this is a rollback to a previous situation, I think this is good enough for a positive review for mpatel's patch, though.  Opinions?

You've done some good testing, and since the original patch was an enhancement, and didn't fix any bugs or failing doctests (right?), I think a positive review is warranted here.

A partial backout, since it retains only some of the changes from #9501, needs a new review, which currently, at least, we don't have.  Given the need to press forward with the 4.5.2 release cycle, I'm merging [attachment: trac_9616-backout_9501_fork_deco.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9616/trac_9616-backout_9501_fork_deco.patch.gz) into 4.5.2.rc0.

This may not be an ideal resolution, but it seems reasonable given the circumstances.  Absolutely no offense is intended.

I've opened #9631 for re-merging #9501 after we fix the NFS/doctest problem.
