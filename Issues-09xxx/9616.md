In 4.5.2.alpha1, we have for many people:

```
sage -t -long "devel/sage/sage/parallel/decorate.py"        


------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred in Sage.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* component
of Sage has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
or is not properly wrapped with _sig_on, _sig_off.
You might want to run Sage under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
Sage will now terminate (sorry).

Couldn't resist though (simpler as expected).

Not very tested, only successfully ran `./sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/parallel/` and rebuilt the documentation without errors or warnings.
(Ubuntu 9.04 x86_64, Core2, gcc 4.3.3)

So now two concurrent patches to review... ;-)

I've tested mpatel's patch on 5 machines: 4 on which the problem originally occurred (sage.math and skynet machines eno, iras, and taurus) and one machine (running OS X) which didn't have the original problem.  After applying the patch, all tests pass for the directory "parallel" on all 5 machines.

I don't know if I'll get to leif's patch.

Since this is a rollback to a previous situation, I think this is good enough for a positive review for mpatel's patch, though.  Opinions?

You've done some good testing, and since the original patch was an enhancement, and didn't fix any bugs or failing doctests (right?), I think a positive review is warranted here.

Besides the above mentioned, this would completely miss, too:

```

         pexpect interfaces are reset in the forked off 
         subprocesses.  You definitely want this, since not doing

A partial backout, since it retains only some of the changes from #9501, needs a new review, which currently, at least, we don't have.  Given the need to press forward with the 4.5.2 release cycle, I'm merging [attachment:trac_9616-backout_9501_fork_deco.patch] into 4.5.2.rc0.

This may not be an ideal resolution, but it seems reasonable given the circumstances.  Absolutely no offense is intended.

I've opened #9631 for re-merging #9501 after we fix the NFS/doctest problem.
