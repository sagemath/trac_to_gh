Because of the error reported on :

http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/b953192f3554337f

It may be good to save an user several hours of trouble because a wrong argument is silently accepted.

Done in this patch ! :-)

I don't know if testing with RR is the best way to do this, but should work. What's missing is a test for max b/c you only tested for min.

You do not begin to know how I *HATE* this RR... Is there any way to check whether a value is numerical without having to import RINGS ? :-D

Even a Python method is fine !!! The most esoteric thing that could be found there is a rational number !

I just updated my patch so that instead of ugly "try/except", a "if" is enough, thanks to Harald's suggestion. By the way, your patch still applies on top of mine, so if you are ok with these changes, let's say this ticket is positively reviewed :-)
