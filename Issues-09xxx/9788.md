When computing the variety over an extension field L of a zero-dimensional ideal of some polynomial ring K[vars], each point of the variety is returned as a dictionary whose keys are generators of L[vars]. It would be more practical to have the keys be either generators of K[vars] or plain strings.

Should `BooleanPolynomialIdeal.variety()` in `pbori.pyx` behave the same? Should other code make use of this as well, e.g. the symbolic `solve` function with `solutions_dict=True`? Should these things be handled in separate tickets?

As you implemented it as a generic programming utility rather than as part of the parent/element/coercion/... infrastructure, perhaps it should go in `sage.misc` rather than `sage.structure`?

If that's easy to do, doing at least some of what you suggest here would give `KeyConvertingDict` a bit of field-testing before it is merged...

Fine with me. Did so.

So this ticket here will remain waiting for review until then? Should I ask someone specific about this?

Did so now.

I get the feeling that if the result accepts various types to identify variables, the argument which tells `solve` what variable(s) to solve for should be auto-coerced as well. That would be a bigger and possibly more controversial change, and I don't want that in the way of this ticket here.

<a id='comment:18'></a>`PolynomialSequence_gf2.solve` currently uses `lambda x: R_origin(x).lm()` as the key conversion function. Which could lead to strange behavior if used incorrectly:

```
sage: R.<x,y,z> = BooleanPolynomialRing()
sage: sol = Sequence([x*y+z, y*z+x, x+y+z+1]).solve()
sage: sol
[{y: 1, z: 0, x: 0}]
sage: sol[0][y+z]
1
```

Should I have the conversion function verify that converting the resulting monomial back into a polynomial will result in a polynomial equal to the argument? Or should I use the rin instead of its monomials as the key domain of the dict? Or is this glitch acceptable, since it's obvious you should use a single monomial as a key here?

Just one question: what is `_no_default_provided` for? Wouldn't it be enough to do

```
return super(KeyConvertingDict, self).pop(key, *args)
```
in `KeyConvertingDict.pop()`?
