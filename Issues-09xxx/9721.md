Reported by Karl-Dieter Crisman on [sage-release](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-release/browse_thread/thread/7abfbeedb07abb53/a487f3968757f7b4#a487f3968757f7b4):

```
4.5.3.alpha0 did NOT upgrade successfully for me on OS X 10.6 from
4.5.2.  See below - though note that Sage does start up properly, and
sage -i returns (among others)

libm4ri-20100221

however the

pycrypto-2.1.0 pynac-0.2.0.p5 sage-4.5.3.alpha0

packages did then not update either, presumably.

That's apparently due to my new (stripped) PolyBoRi spkg (#9472).

I'm currently looking at this, but in principle SCons should find the
"external m4ri" (on MacOS X, too) and not try to use the (now obsolete)
copy of it that was included in previous PolyBoRi spkgs.

Note that neither the M4RI library **nor the GD library** (in the second attempt) are found, so this is not directly (or exclusively) related to removing the M4RI source tree.

It seems some SCons parameters have gotten messed up during the upgrade process. I'm currently trying to reproduce this error on Linux (though frankly speaking I expect this to be Apple-specific once again...)

Can someone try to reproduce this on other MacOS X boxes?

"Of course"<sup>TM</sup> this worked for me on Ubuntu 9.04 x86_64.
(I've built 4.5.2 from scratch, successfully run ptestlong, successfully upgraded to 4.5.3.alpha0, then again successfully run ptestlong.)

I don't think disabling/bypassing the check for a system (or Sage) M4RI library will fix Karl-Dieter's issue, since the GD library wasn't found either.

So, again,

Perhaps just his base installation was somehow broken...

For what it's worth, a 4.5.2-to-4.5.3.alpha1 upgrade also works for me.  The long doctests pass.

I'm resolving this ticket as a "duplicate" of (possibly fixed by) #9717.  Of course, we can reopen it or open another ticket, if there are new reports.
