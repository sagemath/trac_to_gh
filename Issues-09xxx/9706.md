orthogonal_polys4.py hold all changes but is not a patch yet, because it holds old code fragments,
which I have to clean up...

<div id="comment:4" align="right">Comment 4</div>

I added in the latest patch (and orthogonal_polys.4.py contains these changes also) a new symbolic evaluation method for the orthogonal polynomials: Instead of call Maxima or use of the recursion, the polynomial is evaluated just using explicit formulas from Abramowitz and Stegun. This is an O(n) algorithm of course.

a little comparison on my machine:
old version:

sage: time chebyshev_T(10,x);
CPU times: user 0.01 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.01 s
Wall time: 0.04 s
sage: time chebyshev_T(100,x);
CPU times: user 0.13 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 0.14 s
Wall time: 0.23 s
sage: time chebyshev_T(1000,x);
CPU times: user 5.01 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 5.02 s
Wall time: 6.98 s
sage time chebyshev_T(5000,x);
??? (I got no output her after 2min)

sage: time gegenbauer(10,5,x);
CPU times: user 0.01 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.01 s
Wall time: 0.05 s
sage: time gegenbauer(100,5,x);
CPU times: user 0.19 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.19 s
Wall time: 0.29 s
sage: time gegenbauer(1000,5,x);
CPU times: user 5.46 s, sys: 0.02 s, total: 5.48 s
Wall time: 7.79 s


New Version
sage: time chebyshev_T(10,x);
CPU times: user 0.01 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.01 s
Wall time: 0.01 s
sage: time chebyshev_T(100,x);
CPU times: user 0.06 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.06 s
Wall time: 0.08 s
sage: time chebyshev_T(1000,x);
CPU times: user 1.22 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 1.22 s
Wall time: 1.22 s
sage: time chebyshev_T(5000,x);
CPU times: user 27.17 s, sys: 0.15 s, total: 27.32 s
Wall time: 27.46 s

sage: time gegenbauer(10,5,x);
CPU times: user 0.01 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.01 s
Wall time: 0.01 s
sage: time gegenbauer(100,5,x);
CPU times: user 0.03 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.03 s
Wall time: 0.04 s
sage: time gegenbauer(1000,5,x);
CPU times: user 1.08 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 1.09 s
Wall time: 1.11 s

 
A little bit faster :) I also don't need to spawn an instance of maxima which makes the initialisation faster.

And now also wider symbolic evaluation is possible:

old version:
sage: var('a')
a
sage: gegenbauer(3,a,x)
...
NameError: name 'a' is not defined

new version:
sage: var('a')
a
sage: gegenbauer(3,a,x)
4/3*x^3*gamma(a + 3) - 2*x*gamma(a + 2)

The code needs now some cleanup, especially the documentations.
The complete versions for legendre_Q, gen_legendre_P, and gen_legendre_Q will not be finished
soon since the mpmath functions, don't seem to work correctly...
I only provide a call function for maxima for them now.

Sorry for the late answer, I was on holidays.

In mpmath I have probs with the legenp and legenq functions. For some inputs I get this error:

Attachment: **[orthogonal_polys.6.py.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9706/orthogonal_polys.6.py.gz)**

So now a "beta" is ready with full support of all classes.

Only the Legendre functions are still using Maxima.

some advances for the future:

-Zernike polys (this should be done in the next time, since explicit formulas are available)
-support for numpy_eval. (But this will be done, when the scipy package is updated to 0.8, else it has no sense, because the current version of scipy does not support ortho polys well, but the newer can handle them)

Now I need some people for testing this out =)

I decided to give at least some numpy support for compability reasons.
But this is a bad hack...when scipy 0.8 comes I use scipy itself, I change this to a better version :)

But it is not my fault, it seem's that it is a bug in the SymbolicFunction class.

Why is mpmath's precision used by default? Shouldn't the default be RR / CC precision? Actually, does `_evalf_` ever get called without this information?

Some complex tests would be nice.

This is a good point, and it shouldn't be a problem to change that.
But I don't think it's a big deal, because the function takes the "parents" precision, which means, if my input is RR it evals it with RR's precision.

Of course can you call `_evalf_` just with (), and then the default value is used.

I just sticked to the old's version tests, and expanded it. Of course it's possible to expand the tests. I hope I will find some time for it soon, since I have some other more urgent things todo also.

<div id="comment:25" align="right">Comment 25</div>

Since it seems that numpy-1.4.1, and scipy 0.8 should work now (see #9808) I programmed a version which uses scipy itself to evaluate the orthogonal polys for numpy arrays. 
When the new versions of numpy/scipy become merged into sage I will provide a patch for these.

Another thing I have to mention are these 2 failde doctests:
* sage -t  -long "devel/sage/sage/symbolic/random_tests.py"
* sage -t  -long "devel/sage/sage/symbolic/pynac.pyx"

```
sage -t -long "devel/sage/sage/symbolic/random_tests.py"

@kcrisman thanks for paying attention. I added now an updated patch and extended instructions.

the doctest changes in **symbolic.random_tests.py** are easy to explain: new functions are involved -> new random expressions. But I had to change
`random_expr(50, nvars=3, coeff_generator=CDF.random_element) ` to `random_expr(60, nvars=3, coeff_generator=CDF.random_element) ` or else one gets an expression generated where a division through zero occours.

As mentioned on sage-devel I repaired the doctests in **symbolic.pynac.pyx**, the trick is to enlarge the range of the for loop:
`for i in range(get_ginac_serial(), get_ginac_serial()+50):`
changed to
`for i in range(get_ginac_serial(), get_ginac_serial()+100):`
now it works. My explaination: since we have new functions we have longer to search, and then we reach our goal. What I can not explain is, that it works, when I type it in by hand.

All doctests pass now, so I think a review would be nice.

Great work Stefan. Your patch looks good overall, but it needs a lot of polish. Thank you very much for this.

Here are some quick comments after reading [attachment: trac_9706_orthogonal_polys.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9706/trac_9706_orthogonal_polys.patch.gz)I didn't try to apply and run the code yet.

* line 385-386 has this:

```

False for chebyshev_T because chebyshev_T uses clenshaw method instead...)

 I don't think this is valid Sphinx.

I give up at this point. It seems that there are similar issues in the rest of the file as well.

After you clean up the code according to the comments above, perhaps a native English speaker like Karl-Dieter or Minh can help with the documentation.

Thanks again for all your work.

Hi!

I will now retry to build the new orthogonal polynomials.
The last time I ran out of time due to my phd studies/theses
this time i will split the changes up into several patches. So it will be easier to 
apply the changes step by step, and the review process gets simpler.

Hope this time everything will work out!

The "Clenshaw method" uses a very naive method of evaluating the recursion which needs `O(n)` steps, while there is a much faster method (which compute `T_2n` and `U_2n` in function of `T_n` and `U_n`) which only needs `O(log(n))` steps.

I propose the logic for evaluating `chebyshev_T(n, x)` should be:
1. if `x` is symbolic, then use the method of the current patch.
2. if `x` is not symbolic, try evaluation using PARI.
3. if conversion to PARI fails (for example for `RIF`), use an efficient `O(log(n))` recursion algorithm.

Thank you all for the input! I think it is still a good idea that I only implement chebychev polys for now, since there are a lot of improvements out there.

@jdemeyer

`@`Bugs I will look into this. And yes I'm aware that Chebyshev Polynomials are important to number theory since there are quite interesting generalizations on general fields.

`@`Clenshaw: PARI is a good hint, I will look into this. And I already think I know how to generalize the clenshaw method, to get O(log N). 
The reason for this quite naive choice, was that the method can be applied to all ortho polys.

I will try to find an optimal way for this. (Maybe an additional switch)

-What should all SymbolicPolynomials have in common?
-What should they have concerning other general polynomials?

But it would be really good to add the ortho polys, and I really want to finish this task.

What's special about orthogonal polynomials from a **computer algebra** point of view? I can tell you that "symbolic polynomials" are special because you generally want to be able to evaluate them for any ring element (as opposed to other symbolic functions, which often only make sense in real or complex fields).

> I make the following suggestion: I will finish the OrthogonalPolynomials with the current design.

Sure...

(Matrix(2,2,[x,x^2-1,1,x])^n)[0,0]
```

While `chebyshev_U(n-1,x)` equals

Thanks for the hint. I have also an own idea to implement this. My implementation   should be optimal with respect to the flop count, but yours could be faster since matrix multiplication and powers are well optimized. I will compare both methods and use the faster one.

For reference: The method which I mean is based on the generalized recursion formula (originating from the cosine addition theorem): 
T_{n+m} + T{n-m} = 2 T_n T_m 

For T_N one can now use the binary representation of N to recursively build T_N in O(log N) time

I found an interesting paper on this topic: [http://www.mathematik.uni-kassel.de/~koepf/cheby.pdf](http://www.mathematik.uni-kassel.de/~koepf/cheby.pdf)

Maybe this could give some input to the discussion.

It states that for an expanded representation the approach I have
initally chosen (series expansion) should be the best for the symbolic
evaluation, since this is somehow that what the user expects from ohter CAS.
However, the proposed recursive/symbolic method would be interesting too.
(p16f), since it gives a more compact form for large n. Maybe a switch for 
n >= 100?

Considering rational numbers as input, the recursion formula works best, due to this paper. This should be considered too.

`@`Matrix Multiplication: It's also my favorite, but I will compare first.

Here is an implementation of the divide-and-conquer algorithm that doesn't require caching (it only makes one recursive call). It might look even nicer if one rewrites it in iterative form. I think it's also equivalent to the code in pari. It should be faster than matrix powering by a constant factor, just like the analogous Fibonacci number algorithms.

```
def chebyshev_t(n, x):
    # returns (T(n,x), T(n-1,x)), or (T(n,x), _) if both=False
    def recur(n, x, both=False):
        if n == 0:
            return 1, x
        if n == 1:
            return x, 1
        a, b = recur((n+1)//2, x, both or n % 2)
        if n % 2 == 0:
            return 2*a^2 - 1, both and 2*a*b - x
        else:
            return 2*a*b - x, both and 2*b^2 - 1
    return recur(n, x, False)[0]
```

Come to think of it, it might even be useful to publicly expose a method that returns both T(n,x) and T(n-1,x) simultaneously.

Similar code for U (using same algorithm as Pari):

```
def chebyshev_u(n, x):
    def recur(n, x, both=False):
        if n == 0:
            return 1, both and 2*x
        if n == 1:
            return 2*x, both and 4*x^2-1
        a, b = recur((n-1)//2, x, True)
        if n % 2 == 0:
            return (b+a)*(b-a), both and 2*b*(x*b-a)
        else:
            return 2*a*(b-x*a), both and (b+a)*(b-a)
    return recur(n, x, False)[0]
```

Edit: streamlined the code.

I had now a look on these regressions: The problem originates from the fact, tat the ortho polys are now symbolic functions instead of simple function call in maxima.
the symbolic functions have a lot more mechanisms concerning type coercions.

The only way around this would be a hack to chatch this coercion troubles, e.g.


```
def __call__(self,n,x):

    try:
        super(Func_chebyshev_T,self).__call__(n,x)
    except TypeError:
        return self._clenshaw_method_(n,x)
```

would work for that problem and some others. But how to catch such things correctly?
Use a try catch, or make several is_instance checks? This could get a quite long list on coercions...

I think there are only two cases: the "symbolic" case and the "algebraic" case. The latter means that we really consider the polynomial as a polynomial, not a symbolic function. In `chebyshev(n,x)`, if either `n` or `x` is symbolic, we are in the symbolic case, otherwise we're in the algebraic case. In the algebraic case, the index `n` must be a concrete integer and we use the iterative algorithm.

Thank you for the input, that's a great idea!

Based on that I propose the following switch:


```
def __call__(self,n,x):
    if n in ZZ: # check if n is integer -> consider polynomial as algebraic structure
        self._eval_(n,x) # Let eval methode decide which is best
    else:
        super(OrthogonalPolynomial,self).__call__(n,x)
```

I think that `chebyshev_T(1/2, 2)` should raise a `ValueError` (or can we make sense of this?). So, in your code there should really be 3 cases: integer, symbolic and "something else" which is always an error.

So, I would do something like

```
def __call__(self,n,x):
    if is_Expression(n):
        return super(OrthogonalPolynomial, self).__call__(n,x)
    # We consider the polynomial really as a polynomial,
    # not a symbolic expression.
    try:
        n = ZZ(n)
    except StandardError:
        raise ValueError("Index for symbolic polynomials must be an integer")
    return self._eval_polynomial(n, x)
```

I removed the logs, it is much faster now, but still slower than the recursive implementation about a constant factor of 2 (which is not much considering that we are talking about µs, but still)

No there are several other cases to consider: You can also have complex and real input values if you consider a chebyshev polynomial as extension of the Hypergeometric function 1F2 like mpmath does: [http://mpmath.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/build/functions/orthogonal.html#chebyt](http://mpmath.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/build/functions/orthogonal.html#chebyt)
That's the reason for the message in the `_derive_` method, since it would be theoretically possible to differentiate a chebyshev polynomial with respect to the index.

So the way I proposed makes sense, since this could be important for symbolic computation purposes where hypergeometric functions play an important role (eg. Zeilberger algorithm), and of course for analytical considerations.

_eval cares about evaluating the polynomial (e.g return a number if x is a number etc.)
Look into the symbolic.function module for more details
And eval is so complicated because there are several cases to consider: correct evaluation of symbolic expressions, numerical expressions and numpy arrays etc.
This is also part of the BuiltinFunction structure. And you also have to keep in mind that this method should work for all ortho polys.

If you really think the complexity is justified (I have a hard time believing that), you should add comments in the code to describe the various cases, because I'm having a hard time understanding the logic. A comment like `# A faster check would be nice...` doesn't mean much to me because I don't understand what you're trying to do.

<div id="comment:89" align="right">Comment 89</div>

I think `mpmath` should only be used for the "pure" `RealField()` and `ComplexField()` and `RDF` and `CDF`, nothing else.

This is bad:

```
sage: chebyshev_T(5,Qp(3)(2))
...
TypeError: unable to coerce to a ComplexNumber: <type 'sage.rings.padics.padic_capped_relative_element.pAdicCappedRelativeElement'>
```

and the way you use `RIF` is also kind of stupid since the computation should really be done using the recursive formula.

`mpmath` is slower than `_cheb_recur_()`, so I think `mpmath` should be only used in cases where the index is not an integer.

Perhaps the `_eval_` logic should be
1. `n` in `ZZ` => use recursion. If `x` is symbolic and `abs(n) <= 50`, `expand()` the result
2. `n` or `x` symbolic => use symbolic evaluation
3. `n` and `x` real/complex => use `mpmath`
4. anything else => `raise ValueError`

Indeed, but it's not my fault. It appears, that the BuiltinFunction calls the `_eval_numpy_` method. E.g.

```
sage: csc(Mod(8,9))
1.01075621840010
```
makes no sense either but works. Maybe we should open a ticket on this?

I have worked out now a new patch, where `_eval_` returns None, like expected, but still returns this numerical value. But it should be patched in the Symbolic function classes and not here.

One of the reasons I started this rewriting buisness, was the fact, that Maxima is very limited in respect to Orthogonal polynomials. And if we consider advanced use for symbolic methods like 'Creative Telescoping' it makes perfect sense to allow a non
Maxima conform representation, since Sage symbolic capabilities don't relie on Maxima allone.

This looks like a poor excuse to me, since Maxima can deal with Chebyshev polynomials just fine. The following works:

```
sage: maxima('chebysheb_t(n,x)')
```
The fact that the conversion to Maxima doesn't work is a fault of your patch, don't blame Maxima for that.

I'm not blaming maxima, but this never worked on the main branch in the first place:


```
maxima( chebyshev_T(n, cos(x)) )
...
TypeError: unable to convert x (=n) to an integer
```

so I did not break anything ...

You can argue that this is an open improvement, but it's definitely no regression.
Nevertheless it will be corrected in the next patch.

Is it really a good idea to replace *args and **kwds in the OrthogonalPolynomial class?

Since not all ortho polys only have 2 arguments, e.g. Gegenbauer polynomials [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gegenbauer_polynomials](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gegenbauer_polynomials) which have an additional parameter alpha
It makes perfect sense for the chebyshev polys though

I know that the base class looks strange from the point of the Chebyshev polys,
but there is some reasoning behind this =)

Ok, it's always difficult to design an interface for something you don't have an implementation for, but I made the change such that the Gegenbauer polynomials should (in theory) work.

Maybe you should have a short look ino this patch: [https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9706/trac_9706_orthogonal_polys.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9706/trac_9706_orthogonal_polys.patch.gz)
it contains already prototypes of the most ortho polys.

I have some remarks concerning your patch:


```
sage: chebyshev_T(n,Mod(0,8))
1/2*(-1)^(1/2*n)*((-1)^n + 1)
```
but this makes no sense since 1/2 is not defined in Mod(8). This was the reason for the 0 in CC check at this point.

You evaluate numerical expressions for n in NN with recursion. this is favorable for chebyshev polynomials, but not for all ortho polys you can evaluate numeric values in O(log n). You have already problems with the legendre polynomials, since the coefficients depend on n, and the recursion is not stable. Thus other evaluation methods should be used. Thats the reason why `_evalf_` with mpmath should come first.
In case of chebyshev I catched this with an explicit call of the recursion in _evalf_.

The `_old_maxima_` method is used for some oddballs, where the only useful implementation is in maxima, and for some special cases. So removing is probably not a good idea.

The reason why negative values are checked in special values, is that in later versions, or for other polys non integral negative values can be treated analogously, as in the case of their algebraic counterpart. E.g negative legendre polynomials would return associated legendre functions, but have no algebraic sense.

Another reason to allow the special values check for non symbolic input, is that e.g. (-1)^100000000 is evaluated faster, than applying the recursion, or other special points.
I use this feature sometimes to evaluate certain polynomials at the end points of an intervall e.g. [-1,1]

**Question:** Since the Legendre Polynomials already conflicts with the design in the ortho poly class, should we add legendre_P too, to get a better overview, what actually should be kept in the orthogonal poly class? then we could also add more reasonable doctests, to understand the evaluation methods better. 

I have to admit, that about 3 years have passed since I wrote the initial version, and I'm not remembering why I took some design desicisions back then, but slowly my memories are coming back.

> **Question:** Since the Legendre Polynomials already conflicts with the design in the ortho poly class, should we add legendre_P too, to get a better overview, what actually should be kept in the orthogonal poly class?

Absolutely not. The patch is already big enough now.

If the various orthogonal polynomials are so different, then perhaps the simple answer is that we shouldn't try to force a generic `_eval_` which will work for all orthogonal polynomials.

We could have a common superclass for both kinds of Chebyshev polynomials and implement `_eval_()` there. For Legendre polynomials, we could implement a different `_eval_()`. That would be a much simpler solution than making an overly complicated generic `_eval_()`.

I think this would be a good course of action, and that we should put other orthogonal polynomials in other tickets. However, I think it might be worthwhile to at least diagram/pseudocode the overall class structure we want at the end of the day. Currently I believe the proposal is something like:

```
* Orthogonal polynomials

  * Chebyshev polynomials
    - general _evel_(x, n) method

    * Chebyshev T
      - specific code (ex. _evalf_() method), recursions, ...
    * Chebyshev U
      - specific code (ex. _evalf_() method), recursions, ...

  * Legendre polynomials
    - general _evel_(x, n) method

    * Legendre P
    * Legendre Q

  * Gegenbauer polynomials
    - an _evel_(x, n, alpha) method
```
Hopefully my notation is clear

    return B
else:
    return A
```

So I personally would keep the `if/else` structure for the `if n % 2 == 0` test. And for the `n >= 0` test, I would say that

```
if n < 0:
    return B
return A
```
would be a lot better that what you did:

```
if n >= 0:
    return A
return B
```
The first feels much better to me because you put the normal case outside the `if` block and the special cases `if n == 0` and `if n < 0` would be inside `if`s.

(Of course these are all personal preferences, I'm not asking you to change this, maybe just think about it.)

First stage done. Next step: Legendre Polys.

I will keep up the new design + incorporate more doc tests next time. I guess it is important to look at the algebraic aspects too concerning doc tests.

Thank all reviewers for their hard work and the good input!
