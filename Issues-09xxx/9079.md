sage: PolynomialRing(QQ,'u_ba')._singular_init_()
...
RuntimeError: Singular error:
   ? error occurred in STDIN line 33: `if(defined(_b)>0){kill _b;};`
   ? last reserved name was `defined`
   skipping text from `)`
```

This is because the function `_singular_init_` incorrectly defines _vars.  The attached patch fixes this.
