Willem explained this one to me. Apparently opencdk is now linking libgcrypt from the wrong place, due to libtools, caused by the addition of `-lgcrypt` in #8658. The short term fix is to make sure that `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib` is included in `LDFLAGS` in the `spkg-install` script, but the longer term fix will be to figure out why libtools is linking against `/usr/lib` in the first place.

Some more preliminary results:

It seems that adding `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib` to `$LIBRARY_PATH` as `sage-env` does, might have unexpected effects:

On 64 bit gentoo:

```
$ export LIBRARY_PATH=/blah
$ gcc -print-search-dirs
[...]
libraries: =/blah/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/4.1.2/:/blah/../lib64/
```

So `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib` does _not_ end up being searched by gcc in this case. (But the non-existent `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib64` does.)


On 64 bit debian (Lenny), this is

```
libraries: =/blah/x86_64-linux-gnu/4.3.2/:/blah/../lib/
```


It looks like we're completely mis-using `LIBRARY_PATH`... Maybe it's worth considering putting `-L$SAGE_LOCAL/lib` in `$LDFLAGS` in `sage-env`.
