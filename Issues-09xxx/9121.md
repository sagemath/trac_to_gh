I actually reported [https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/9004](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/9004)
on that expression - the test has failed for a long time on sage-on-gentoo.
I didn't notice the backwardness and did something slightly different,
but the backwardness explain a lot of things.
I think you should have a look at it and mark one of them a duplicate.
