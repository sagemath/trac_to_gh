I actually reported [http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/9004](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/9004)
on that expression - the test has failed for a long time on sage-on-gentoo.
I didn't notice the backwardness and did something slightly different,
but the backwardness explain a lot of things.
I think you should have a look at it and mark one of them a duplicate.

fbissey -- you're right.  Both of our patches are wrong, but together they are right.  

Note that I'm marking this test random, since it is a comparison of types, which is architecture and sage-version dependent.
