The same holds for a=17/2 for example.

Since `n` is a shortcut for `numerical_approx`,
it should work with `numerical_approx` too. In addition,
if one uses a variable `n` is a program, it would be more
portable to use `numerical_approx`.

Is there an example when a.numerical_approx() works?

After reading the documentation on numerical_approx(), I don't think it can be used in this manner.  

Note that a.N() does not work either for your example.

a.numerical_approx() needed to be defined in sage.misc.element.pyx. However n() already defined there calls and checks if the element type already has numerical_approx(). So this would cause an infinite loop. 

So instead now it calls to see if it has _numerical_approx()

I changed all the files where a specific type defined numerical_approx to _numerical_approx and defined an "empty method" numerical_approx, which just calls _numerical_approx.

So now every type should automatically have a numerical_approx. If a specific one is defined then that is called or it simply coerces it to be a real or complex approx.

A few minor points:

You can just rename `numerical_approx` to `_numerical_approx` in `matrix2.pyx` without keeping `numerical_approx` since `Matrix` is an `element` so it inherits the default implementation of `numerical_approx`. Same for `expression.pyx`.

(On the other hand, `heegner.py` does need both.)

I would change the docstrings in `structure/element.pyx` to something shorter than the full output. Maybe the following?

```
[..., 'is_idempotent', 'is_integral', ...]
```


Is the (capital) `N()` for consistency with something, or is that new?

If I changed matrix2 and expression to not have numerical_approx then the documentation won't show up. 

changed element.pyx

And yes N() is for consistency, but I did remove them from expression since it is not needed.

All tests pass, and I would positively review this patch, except for three
documentation problems.

1) The extraneous, pre-existing example line ("a = 2/3") should be removed 
(in structure/element.pyx). It is neither an example of the use of numerical 
approximation, nor used in the remaining part of the example.

```
sage: a = 8
sage: a.numerical_approx?
...
    
       Return a numerical approximation of x with at least prec bits of
       precision.
    
       EXAMPLES:
    
          sage: (2/3).n()
          0.666666666666667
          sage: a = 2/3
          sage: pi.n(digits=10)
          3.141592654
          sage: pi.n(prec=20)   # 20 bits
          3.1416

```

2) Grammatical error in symbolic/expression.pyx:

```
sage: a = cos(3)
sage: a.numerical_approx?
...
    
       Return a numerical approximation this symbolic expression as either
```

Should be "numerical approximation of this symbolic expression...."
                                   ^^

I know these are trivial and not written by you. However, they're too trivial for their own 
patches, and would fit logically in yours.

3) When I create a symbolic expression, I now get different docstrings for "n" 
(from element) and "numerical_approx" (from expression):

```
sage: a = cos(3)
sage: type(a)
<type 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression'>
sage: a.n?
...
       Return a numerical approximation of x with at least prec bits of
       precision.
    
       EXAMPLES:
    
          sage: (2/3).n()
          0.666666666666667
...

sage: a.numerical_approx?
...    
       Return a numerical approximation this symbolic expression as either
       a real or complex number with at least the requested number of bits
       or digits of precision.
    
       EXAMPLES:
    
          sage: sin(x).subs(x=5).n()
          -0.958924274663138
...

```

I believe that this happened when you removed the re-definition of method "n" in expression.
However, that is the docstring that you want to be returned for a symbolic expression.

N has been an alias for this for a long time, so this just making it consistent -  I think this added a method, not a global function.  In a Sage version nearly a year old:

```
sage: N(5)
5.00000000000000
sage: n(5)
5.00000000000000
sage: numerical_approx(5)
5.00000000000000
sage: a=5
sage: a.N?
Object `a.N` not found.
sage: a.n
<built-in method n of sage.rings.integer.Integer object at 0x1091154e0>
```

Yes; I am precisely arguing about this method, and the pollution of the method namespace of all elements. We can't use anymore x.N to access an attribute called N in a gap record x (well, we can, but as x.__getattr__("N") which is not very convenient).

Thanks,

Do you mind running this discussion on sage-devel?

I guess someone wanting a numerical approximation on a gap element (that could well be me :-)) can afford to use g.numerical_approx(), or just g.n().

Thanks!
