I cannot *really* test this myself, because `generic_graph.py` does still not terminate on my 32-bit system, and on 64-bit it wasn't an issue...

(At least the patch doesn't introduce new failures. ;-) )

Please review s.t. this can be merged into 4.5.2.alpha1.

With the possible patch at #9584 so that doctests actually terminate, this passes on the skynet machines cleo and iras.  Should the comment also mention this ticket (both #9583 and #9584)?  If you think so, replace the current patch, no need for another review.

Positive review, in any case.

Obviously... ;-)

I simply forgot to add the "backlink" at #9593, which should fix the problem in the long run (so I mentioned only that ticket in the patch's comment; with both, the line had gotten to long).
