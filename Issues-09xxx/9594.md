I cannot *really* test this myself, because `generic_graph.py` does still not terminate on my 32-bit system, and on 64-bit it wasn't an issue...

(At least the patch doesn't introduce new failures. ;-) )

Please review s.t. this can be merged into 4.5.2.alpha1.

are these the positions of the petersen graph? the odd thing is this is tested [at line 1565 much more unspecific](http://sagemath.org/doc/reference/sage/graphs/generic_graph.html#sage.graphs.generic_graph.GenericGraph.get_pos).

I would also suggest to introduce some [iterations=some max val ](http://sagemath.org/doc/reference/sage/graphs/generic_graph.html#sage.graphs.generic_graph.GenericGraph.plot) at those plots that do not stop when doing layout.

I've reduced the problem size of the previously not terminating doctest and with the patch here applied now all doctests pass on the 32-bit system, too.

With the possible patch at #9584 so that doctests actually terminate, this passes on the skynet machines cleo and iras.  Should the comment also mention this ticket (both #9583 and #9584)?  If you think so, replace the current patch, no need for another review.

Positive review, in any case.

Obviously... ;-)

I simply forgot to add the "backlink" at #9593, which should fix the problem in the long run (so I mentioned only that ticket in the patch's comment; with both, the line had gotten to long).
