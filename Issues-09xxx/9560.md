It's convenient to assume that True and False are equivalent to 1 and 0 in Python, but this doesn't work as expected with symbolic expressions:

```
sage: SR(5) + True; SR(5) * True; SR(5) - True
2
1
0
sage: 5 + True; 5 * True; 5 - True
6
5
4
```

Probably it hasn't been reviewed for the same reason as people disagreed with it in the past - not really worth the effort :)

My favorites:

```
sage: e-True
e - 1
sage: pi+False
pi
```

Anyway, positive review.  It would have been nice to have an example with `False`, but that's not worth holding this up any further.
