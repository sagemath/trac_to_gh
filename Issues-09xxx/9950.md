Brian, a simulator for spiking neural networks, has been recently accepted as an experimental package (see ticket #9675) and [Brian's webage](http://www.briansimulator.org/)). In this ticket, it has been suggested the possibility to change it to an optional package. However, at least it should be tested in some different platforms.

Code can be downloaded by clicking [here](http://code.google.com/p/spkg-upload/downloads/detail?name=brian-1.2.1.p0.spkg&can=2&q=) or at Sage's experimental packages page: [http://www.sagemath.org/packages/experimental/](http://www.sagemath.org/packages/experimental/).

Brian has built-in tests, but they need nose to run. Ticket [#9921](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/9921) is precisely about adding nose as an optional/standard package; I installed the package provided there and runned Brian's tests by writing:

[[[
sage: import brian
sage: brian.test()
]]]

and all of them were passed. However, I didn't do an SPKG-TEST file because nose is not part of Sage yet.

This should be accepted.  It still works fine, installs fine.  Granted, perhaps one can do this without an spkg, but why not have it?

By the way, Brian is now in version 1.3.1, but that is a different issue.
