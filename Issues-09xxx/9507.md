How do you check if Python exists in a Python script? I would have thought the code to check Python exists would have relied on Python existing - a catch 22. Of course, if you happen to have a system wide Python, then you could use that to check for $SAGE_LOCAL/bin/python. But that's going to be far from reliable, since: 
* A system may have no Python
* A system Python may be too old. 
* A system Python may not work properly, which is what appears to have happened in your sage_fortran setup. 

But I guess it is more reliable than no test at all, but I can't think of a 100% sure-fire way of doing this. One could make all spkg-install's /bin/sh scripts, and use that to check for Python before calling a Python script. But that's a lot of messing around, and one probably more likely to introduce a bug than detect one.

Would it not be worth checking **all** files in the top-level directory, rather than just spkg-install? Several packages have both bash scripts and python scripts in them.

spkg-install in ATLAS is a small python script, which then calls a large bash script. What's to stop there being any packages with it the other way around, where a bash script calls a python script?

To avoid confusion to users, we should perhaps clarify in the error message that ***Sage's** Python* is not yet installed. (Otherwise I expect reports like *"I have a Python installed, but..."*.)

The comment should read `# if not, ...` rather than `# if so, ...` (or `check if ...` should be negated).

I definitely do not like this idea.  Though it seems good at first, it's really bad. 

  (1) it's hackish

  (2) It means that once python is installed, the scripts repository is always confused/corrupted/etc.   In particular, it would completely break "sage -upgrade", since the scripts repo is upgraded via `hg pull`.
