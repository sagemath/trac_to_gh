The following are three cells in a magma-mode notebook worksheet, together with output (there should be none). Each is valid magma code, but the first one produces an error. The other two examples show that shortening the line by changing its content or by placing a line break make the error go away.

If I remember correctly, my own investigation into this bug revealed that this is caused by Sage's use of temporary files for lengthy input, which causes truncations of input at wrong syntactical places. 

As you see in the first input, a temporary file is used for the first three lines, and the last line "until ..." is input separately. Both chunks of Magma codes are of course syntactically wrong. Thus Magma complains.

Here's a similar but even stranger example. This valid Magma which should return nothing, but it returns an error when evaluated in a notebook cell:

   ^

```
Apparently the last line got separated from the rest by mistake. The same sort of thing happens if I concatenate the first two commands into one line and the other two into a second line. But if I make the line even longer by concatenating all four commands together, the error vanishes!

```
MR:=MatrixRing(Rationals(),4); embed:=function(A); return MR!Matrix([[A[1][1],A[1][2],0,0],[A[2][1],A[2][2],0,0],[0,0,A[1][1],A[1][2]],[0,0,0,A[2][2]]]); end function;
///
```
I can also avoid the error by slightly shortening the third line in the original (e.g., by changing the last nonzero matrix entry to 0).

I suppose what's going on is that Sage never breaks up an individual line, but it does or does not concatenate multiple lines into the same temporary file based on length considerations. This clearly needs to be done more intelligently.

Hi,

I'm attaching a patch that fixes this issue.  It's hard to test because of other issues with the sage/magma interface being broken.  

The idea of the fix is simply that for Magma we just evaluate the input block as one big block instead of splitting things up into separate lines.      I implemented this by adding an option to the base class in expect.py.    Obviously, this same sort of bug could happen with some other interfaces, and I'm not addressing that problem in this ticket.
