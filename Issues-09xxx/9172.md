The correct answer is 2*sqrt(2), which is `2.8284271247461900976033774484193961...`  

So the expected value is `2.0239x10`<sup>-16</sup> high, and result on Cygwin is 2.9760x10<sup>-16</sup> low. So the errors on Linux/OSX/Solaris is not much lower than on Cygwin. We can't really expect any more from a floating point number. 

We could change the Expected value to `2.8284271247461...` What I don't like about that, is then much larger errors can exist and them not be detected. But this is far from the only such case, so I suggest just changing the test to `2.8284271247461...`, which will solve this.
