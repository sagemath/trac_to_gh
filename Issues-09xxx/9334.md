<a id='comment:8'></a>I generally agree with David's points. This code will be very useful for a topic begin done at SD23 (solving conics over various fields) so I am keen to get this in (suitably modified).

In generalized_legendre_symbol: (1) test P for primality first, before trying to construct its residue field. (2) instead of K(2).valuation(P) just test that n is odd. (3) don't raise run-time errors, make them ValueErrors?. (4) make the return types consistent: you return either +1 in k or -1 as a python int. I would return a Sage integer in either case. (5) you do not test if P divides self. If so, return 0 (as a Sage integer)>

Why are generalized_hilbert_symbol and _legendre_symbol in sage/rings/arith.py? I would put them both in number_fields -- where you put the even one in fact.

In generalized_even_hilbert_symbol you define but do not use iprime, so delete it. And do the simple calculation to get the coefficients of jprime**2 so you don't need to construct the quaternion algebra. (You can leave in a comment about that).

_voight_alg_6_2 has some ^ symbols which should be **. Check for others.

Do what David said about uniformizer -- just call the existing function.

Sort out the solve function.

   This is almost trivial compared to what you've already done. I have code, contact me if you have questions.

<a id='comment:15'></a>Excellent -- should it be "needs review" again then?

There must be places in Sage where Hensel lifting is done, but I do not know of any general framework for it.  You could try asking David Roe, who (I think) wrote a lot of the p-adic code.

<a id='comment:21'></a>Here are some comments have already been mentioned above:
* why aren't generalized_hilbert_symbol and generalized_even_hilbert_symbol in the same file? (e.g. both in number_field as John suggested)
* the documentation of generalized_hilbert_symbol says that the prime should be odd, which isn't necessary, in fact, it would be good to have an even example in the doctest so this functionality doesn't get broken
* the documentation of generalized_even_hilbert_symbol doesn't say that the prime must be even, which it should!

Also, generalized_even_hilbert_symbol is less powerful than the general one:

```
sage: K.<i> = QuadraticField(-1)                            
sage: O = K.maximal_order()
sage: generalized_hilbert_symbol(K(1/3), K(1), (1+i)*O)     
1
sage: generalized_even_hilbert_symbol(K(1/3), K(1), (1+i)*O)
...
NotImplementedError: inverse_mod is not implemented for non-integral elements
```
So I guess the documentation of generalized_even_hilbert_symbol should say that the input should consist of integral elements? Possibly the documentation of generalized_even_hilbert_symbol could say that this is simply an auxiliary function and the user should call generalized_hilbert_symbol instead?

All that needed to be done was wrap pari's nfhilbert function and copy Aly's doctests, but...

One of those doctests revealed yet another bug introduced by the pari upgrade. See [http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1147](http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1147)

Apply trac_9334_nfhilbert.patch once pari bug 1147 is fixed and that fix reaches Sage.

Possible future improvements:

* implement also for relative number fields by simply delegating to the absolute case

* implement also for QQ by wrapping the global function hilbert_symbol as a member of QQ

There is still a duplicate example, and a lot of examples that return 1 now that they are corrected. I think we should remove some of these, and add some -1's such as the ones in my comment 2 days ago.

Also, what is the output type now? In my patch, I converted it to Integer. Jeroen removed that conversion, but what does cdef long give us?

Finally, in my patch, I had self(a), but Jeroen turned this into a. How carefully does Pari check whether stuff is in the right field?

Please do it!

It will be Python `int`.  I see no reason to return a Sage Integer.

I only *moved* ``a = self(a)`` up in the code.

I agree -- that's horrible! It's not so generic actually: the offending code is the  method `NumberField_absolute._coerce_from_other_number_field` which just converts to a polynomial and back: 

```
f = self.polynomial_ring()(x.polynomial())
return self._element_class(self, f)
```

This is mathematically meaningless unless either the other field is isomorphic to self, or x is actually in Q. I suggest we raise this on sage-nt, and maybe open a ticket to fix it ASAP.

Python ints are fine with me, I was afraid it would be a pari object. I would have liked some uniformity, but that's missing already.

```
sage: type(legendre_symbol(3,5))
<type 'int'>
sage: type(hilbert_symbol(3,5,7))
<type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>
sage: type(jacobi_symbol(3,5))
<type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>
```
I want all symbols to behave nicely with division by Sage integers, but that's fine with `int`

```
sage: int(1)/ZZ(2)
1/2
```
