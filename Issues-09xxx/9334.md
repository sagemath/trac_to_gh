Here all the functions are better placed.  I still need to fix the code so that generalized_hilbert_symbol(a,b,P) doesn't assume a.valuation(P) and b.valuation(P) are 0 or 1.

I generally agree with David's points. This code will be very useful for a topic begin done at SD23 (solving conics over various fields) so I am keen to get this in (suitably modified).

In generalized_legendre_symbol: (1) test P for primality first, before trying to construct its residue field. (2) instead of K(2).valuation(P) just test that n is odd. (3) don't raise run-time errors, make them ValueErrors?. (4) make the return types consistent: you return either +1 in k or -1 as a python int. I would return a Sage integer in either case. (5) you do not test if P divides self. If so, return 0 (as a Sage integer)>

Why are generalized_hilbert_symbol and `_legendre_`symbol in sage/rings/arith.py? I would put them both in number_fields -- where you put the even one in fact.

In generalized_even_hilbert_symbol you define but do not use iprime, so delete it. And do the simple calculation to get the coefficients of jprime**2 so you don't need to construct the quaternion algebra. (You can leave in a comment about that).

`_voight_alg_`6_2 has some ^ symbols which should be **. Check for others.

Do what David said about uniformizer -- just call the existing function.

Sort out the solve function.

Great, I could use this.

While you are still at it, I have a small wish list as well. Could you

* Let the generalized even Hilbert symbol accept fractions (as the odd one and the QQ one do)?

   ```
   sage: hilbert_symbol(1/3, 1, 2)
   1
   sage: K.<i> = QuadraticField(-1)
   sage: O = K.maximal_order()
   sage: generalized_hilbert_symbol(K(1/2), K(1), 3*O)
   1
   sage: generalized_hilbert_symbol(K(1/3), K(1), (1+i)*O)
   NotImplementedError: inverse_mod is not implemented for non-integral elements
  ```

* Also add the Hilbert symbol for infinite places? See e.g.

   ```
   sage: hilbert_symbol(-1, -1, -1)
   -1
  ```
  This is almost trivial compared to what you've already done. I have code, contact me if you have questions.

* Correct the doc text. The doc of generalized_even_hilbert_symbol should say that P must divide 2, while generalized_hilbert_symbol should not say that P must be odd

Alyson, are you intending to fix the various points raised by reviewers here?  If not, someone else should.  Ticket #9320 is waiting on this one.

Here are the changes I've made so far: 
1. in generalized_legendred_symbol I test for primality first
2. instead of K(2).valuation(P) I just test that n is odd
3. I've changed RunTime Errors to ValueErrors
4. I return +/- 1 as sage integers
5. I test if P|self and if so return 0 (as a sage integer)
6. in generalized_hilbert_symbol I deleted iprime
7. I did the calculation and have hard coded jprime^2
8. I've replace ^ with ** where necessary in `_voight_alg_`6_2
9. Things should work for fractions
10. generalized_hilbert_symbol should also accept a,b, divisible by p

One question I have, does anyone know about hensel lifting in sage?

Excellent -- should it be "needs review" again then?

There must be places in Sage where Hensel lifting is done, but I do not know of any general framework for it.  You could try asking David Roe, who (I think) wrote a lot of the p-adic code.

Here are some comments have already been mentioned above:
* why aren't generalized_hilbert_symbol and generalized_even_hilbert_symbol in the same file? (e.g. both in number_field as John suggested)
* the documentation of generalized_hilbert_symbol says that the prime should be odd, which isn't necessary, in fact, it would be good to have an even example in the doctest so this functionality doesn't get broken
* the documentation of generalized_even_hilbert_symbol doesn't say that the prime must be even, which it should!

Also, generalized_even_hilbert_symbol is less powerful than the general one:

```
sage: K.<i> = QuadraticField(-1)                            
sage: O = K.maximal_order()
sage: generalized_hilbert_symbol(K(1/3), K(1), (1+i)*O)     
1
sage: generalized_even_hilbert_symbol(K(1/3), K(1), (1+i)*O)
...
NotImplementedError: inverse_mod is not implemented for non-integral elements
```
So I guess the documentation of generalized_even_hilbert_symbol should say that the input should consist of integral elements? Possibly the documentation of generalized_even_hilbert_symbol could say that this is simply an auxiliary function and the user should call generalized_hilbert_symbol instead?

needs_work because of the documentation issues for generalized_even_hilbert_symbol

All that needed to be done was wrap pari's nfhilbert function and copy Aly's doctests, but...

One of those doctests revealed yet another bug introduced by the pari upgrade. See [http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1147](http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1147)

Apply trac_9334_nfhilbert.patch once pari bug 1147 is fixed and that fix reaches Sage.

Possible future improvements:

* implement also for relative number fields by simply delegating to the absolute case

* implement also for QQ by wrapping the global function hilbert_symbol as a member of QQ

The pari bug resulting in incorrect outputs of nfhilbert was fixed in Pari svn revision 13063 2011-04-05 14:03:38 +0100 (Tue, 05 Apr 2011).

According to Magma V2.17-9, the following changes make the doctests correct:

replace

```
sage: K.hilbert_symbol(p,p,p*O)  
-1
```
by

```
sage: K.hilbert_symbol(p,p,p)  
1
sage: K.hilbert_symbol(p,3*p,p)
-1
sage: K.hilbert_symbol(3,p,p)
-1
```

remove duplicate

```
sage: K.hilbert_symbol(a,b,P)
-1
```
and for the remaining one, replace -1 by 1

replace -1 by 1 in

```
sage: K.hilbert_symbol(a, 2, P)  
-1  
```

Then the "various other examples" contain a lot of uninteresting 1s, of which we can remove a few.

I can't immediately figure out the cause, it is probably a bug somewhere in PARI or the Sage-PARI interface,

Do you want to close this ticket at the same time as #11130? If not, then I'll wait until I can download a version with #11130 included, and then try to fix the problems here.

Wow, even Sage doesn't check this:

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Sage Version 4.7.1, Release Date: 2011-08-11                       |

----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^3+x+1)
sage: L.<b> = NumberField(x^3+2*x+2)
sage: K(b)
a
```
so my `self(a)` was pretty useless and we may want to do this:

```
if not (a in self and b in self):
    raise ValueError, ...
```

It will be Python `int`.  I see no reason to return a Sage Integer.

I agree -- that's horrible! It's not so generic actually: the offending code is the  method `NumberField_absolute._coerce_from_other_number_field` which just converts to a polynomial and back: 

```
f = self.polynomial_ring()(x.polynomial())
return self._element_class(self, f)
```

This is mathematically meaningless unless either the other field is isomorphic to self, or x is actually in Q. I suggest we raise this on sage-nt, and maybe open a ticket to fix it ASAP.

Python ints are fine with me, I was afraid it would be a pari object. I would have liked some uniformity, but that's missing already.

```
sage: type(legendre_symbol(3,5))
<type 'int'>
sage: type(hilbert_symbol(3,5,7))
<type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>
sage: type(jacobi_symbol(3,5))
<type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>
```
I want all symbols to behave nicely with division by Sage integers, but that's fine with `int`

```
sage: int(1)/ZZ(2)
1/2
```

I could, but I wouldn't be able to test it, and it may need to be rebased afterwards: I failed to install #11130.

Positive review for the reviewer patch. I noticed that it included extra -1 examples and removed the duplicate example, and I did not find removing examples worth the trouble.

I also managed to build #11130 and found that all tests pass. I'm assuming Jeroen gives a positive review to what he didn't change, and that his reviewer patch was ready for review, so I'm setting the whole ticket to positive review.
