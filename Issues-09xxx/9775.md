Some comments (on the spkg in general, not the Cygwin changes, with the exception of quoting `$SAGE_LOCAL`):

* `$CFLAG64` and `$CXXFLAG64` should be quoted.

* `CXXFLAG64` is exported (?) twice. (It is in fact currently used in the Makefile.)

* In general, e.g. `-m64` should be added to `CPPFLAGS` as well.

* In other packages, we disable optimization if `SAGE_DEBUG=yes`, and build **with** debugging symbols (`-g`) unconditionally, i.e. independent of the setting of `SAGE_DEBUG`.

* `$MAKE` should be used instead of `make`. (Though `make` is called(!) inside the Makefile itself for the default target, `all`, which we build. See below, too.) 

* `$SAGE_LOCAL` should be quoted, too (for future support of spaces).

* The following case distinction is superfluous (and the branches are redundant as well):

```sh
if `test -d $SAGE_LOCAL/include/lcalc`; then
    rm -fr $SAGE_LOCAL/include/lcalc
    mkdir $SAGE_LOCAL/include/lcalc
    cp ../include/* $SAGE_LOCAL/include/lcalc
else
    mkdir $SAGE_LOCAL/include/lcalc
    cp ../include/* $SAGE_LOCAL/include/lcalc
fi
```
   It should simply be:

```sh
    rm -fr "$SAGE_LOCAL"/include/lcalc
    mkdir -p "$SAGE_LOCAL"/include/lcalc
    cp ../include/* "$SAGE_LOCAL"/include/lcalc
```

* I'm not sure if I should like the `success()` function (the messages are quite strange); same for the use of `set -e`.

* There's no `spkg-check`, but unfortunately the test program has been removed from the sources anyway. Should be addressed in later versions (e.g. add a comment to *"Special Update/Build Instructions"*).

* These files have been removed without telling Mercurial:

```sh
$ hg status
! patches/lcalc-1.11-constification+solaris.patch
! patches/lcalc-1.11-gcc-4.3-build.patch
! patches/lcalc-1.11-memleak-fixes.patch
```

* The *patched* Makefile (`patches/Makefile.sage`, lacking the corresponding diff) isn't much better than the original.
  It also should **not** make Lcalc link against `libmpir.so` (or its static version), but - if at all - `libgmp.so` instead, since we configure MPIR with `--enable-gmpcompat` anyway. As is, it's the **only** package that breaks building with GNU MP, unless one creates a symbolic link from `libmpir.so` to `libgmp.so`.


It would be nice to address at least some (especially the last) of these points *here*, too, since it IMHO doesn't make much sense to frequently open new tickets and create new spkgs just for minor/clean-up changes.
