There is already the operatror & for Sets intersections : S1 & S2.

There is also the operator + for submodules sum : F+G.

I propose to expand the operator & over submodules and subspaces,
and add theses lines in free_modules.py

```
## allow the "intersection" operator & for submodules.
 
     def __and__ (self, other) : return self.intersection (other)
```

Assignee: jason, was

Keywords: operator & for submodule intersection
