The decorators in sage.misc.misc should be moved to sage.misc.decorators.

In plot.misc there are also some generally usable decorators for various nice stuff. These should be moved to a general library so other modules can use them without illogically depending on plot. Simultaneously, they should be patched to use sage_wraps instead of the Python "wraps" to accommodate for Sage-specific things; e.g. the fix of Trac #9917.

I am running this through full tests as part of #6094 and a report will go there once concluded.

Commit message on the ticket itself should probably change - there is no "as before" here to compare with, and in the final log it really won't make any sense.

Do you think you could just add the work-around to the sage_wraps decorator (sage.misc.misc.sage_wraps) and convert the decorators to use it?  There are other functions that use sage_wraps, and it would be nice to have all of that work-around code in one place.

I started Trac #9919 for doing this patch in sage_wraps. I'm also thinking that, when the problems with this patch are identified, we might move sage_wraps and other decorators in sage.misc.misc into sage.misc.decorators as well.
