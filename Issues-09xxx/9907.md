The decorators in sage.misc.misc should be moved to sage.misc.decorators.

In plot.misc there are also some generally usable decorators for various nice stuff. These should be moved to a general library so other modules can use them without illogically depending on plot. Simultaneously, they should be patched to use sage_wraps instead of the Python "wraps" to accommodate for Sage-specific things; e.g. the fix of Trac #9917.

**Assignee:** @johanrosenkilde

**CC:**  @jasongrout @mwhansen

**Keywords:** generality, decorators

**Resolution:** fixed

**Author:** Johan Sebastian Rosenkilde Nielsen

**Reviewer:** Robert Miller

**Merged:** sage-4.6.1.alpha2

I'm not qualified to check out the "work-around" for classes.  But I've cc'ed Mike Hansen and Jason Grout, who I think were in on these in the first place back at #4201.

I am running this through full tests as part of #6094 and a report will go there once concluded.

Commit message on the ticket itself should probably change - there is no "as before" here to compare with, and in the final log it really won't make any sense.

Do you think you could just add the work-around to the sage_wraps decorator (sage.misc.misc.sage_wraps) and convert the decorators to use it?  There are other functions that use sage_wraps, and it would be nice to have all of that work-around code in one place.

I started Trac #9919 for doing this patch in sage_wraps. I'm also thinking that, when the problems with this patch are identified, we might move sage_wraps and other decorators in sage.misc.misc into sage.misc.decorators as well.

Rob Beezer posted the following problem with the current patch for Trac #6094, but that is actually a problem with the current patch for this trac. When testing the unpickle-function in sage.structure.sage_object, the relocation of the decorators yield problems:

The problem, as far as I can see, is simply that there is a standard pickle jar which has a pickle for all the functions etc. shipped with sage. This needs to be updated when applying this patch. Does anyone know how this is done and possibly included in the patch?

The pickle jar contains old pickles of objects that we want to ensure work in the future. For example, if you made the changes at [9907](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/9907) as the are, then possibly many pickles out in the wild would break. Instead of trying to update the pickle jar, the appropriate thing to do would be to add the following to sage/plot/misc.py

```
#For backward compatibility -- see #9907.
from sage.misc.decorators import options, suboptions, rename_keyword

```
That way, the old pickles will still work as they will still be able to find the decorators in sage.plot.misc.

Ok, thanks -- I will update the patch for #9907. I was actually wondering a bit about backward compatibility, so good to know this is the system. Does the above fix then have a one-year lifetime like for keyword-deprecation? If so, should it be flagged somehow (e.g. with the comment containing the term "backward compatibility") so it can be found and removed one year from now?
