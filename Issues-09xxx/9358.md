## Hardware & associated software


* Sun Blade 1000
* 2 x 900 MHz UltraSPARC III+ CPUs
* 2 GB RAM
* 8 GB swap
* Solaris 10 03/2005 (first release of Solaris 10)
* 147 GB SEAGATE-ST3146807FC 2 Gbit/s 15,000 rpm fiber channel disk (FCAL)
* UFS local file systems. 
* gcc 4.4.3 (uses Sun linker and assembler)
* 64-bit build - SAGE64 was exported to "yes"

## How GCC was configured
GCC can be configured several ways on Solaris. For Solaris 10 SPARC, use of both the Sun linker and Sun assembler are usually recommended, which is what was done here. 

```
drkirkby@redstart:~$ gcc -v

Thread model: posix
gcc version 4.4.3 (GCC)
```

## The problem
znpoly passes about 40 self-tests, but fails to install properly. 

```

All tests passed.

sage: An error occurred while installing zn_poly-0.9.p4
```

This looks like a problem in spkg-install, which was written to consider two Solaris/64-bit releated possibilities.

* A 64-bit build
* A Solaris build with the Sun linker. 

It does **not** cover the possibility of a 64-bit build on Solaris with the Sun linker. Clearly that was an oversight on my part. 

## Likely solution
This should be hopefully quite easy to fix. spkg-install needs to consider the possibility of a 64-bit Solaris build with the Sun linker.

You do not surprise me. 

I have a patch, but I'm working on improving `spkg-install` and `spkg-check`. Currently `spkg-install` runs a quick test suite with `make check`. That does not seem such a bad idea, so I'm not changing that.  With SAGE_CHECK unset, this takes 46 seconds to build and run the quick test suite on my Sun Ultra 27 to build. 

However, `spkg-check` currently runs the same test suite for a second time, which is clearly pointless. I'm changing `spkg-check` to run run the more extensive test suite. That increases the time to 7 minutes and 37 seconds on my 3.33 GHz Sun Ultra 27. That will probably close to hour on the Sun T5240 't2.math.washington.edu', so if you run with SAGE_CHECK=yes, bear that in mind.
