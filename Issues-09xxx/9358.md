## Hardware & associated software


* Sun Blade 1000
* 2 x 900 MHz UltraSPARC III+ CPUs
* 2 GB RAM
* 8 GB swap
* Solaris 10 03/2005 (first release of Solaris 10)
* 147 GB SEAGATE-ST3146807FC 2 Gbit/s 15,000 rpm fiber channel disk (FCAL)
* UFS local file systems. 
* gcc 4.4.3 (uses Sun linker and assembler)
* 64-bit build - SAGE64 was exported to "yes"

## How GCC was configured
GCC can be configured several ways on Solaris. For Solaris 10 SPARC, use of both the Sun linker and Sun assembler are usually recommended, which is what was done here. 

```
drkirkby@redstart:~$ gcc -v
Using built-in specs.
Target: sparc-sun-solaris2.10
Configured with: ../gcc-4.4.3/configure --prefix=/usr/local/gcc-4.4.3 --with-mpfr=/usr/local/gcc-4.4.3 --with-build-time-tools=/usr/ccs/bin --with-gmp=/usr/local/gcc-4.4.3 --enable-languages=c,c++,fortran
Thread model: posix
gcc version 4.4.3 (GCC)
```

## The problem
znpoly passes about 40 self-tests, but fails to install properly. 

```
zn_array_mulmid_fft()... ok
zn_array_mul_fft_dft()... ok
zn_array_invert()... ok

All tests passed.

sage: An error occurred while installing zn_poly-0.9.p4
```

This looks like a problem in spkg-install, which was written to consider two Solaris/64-bit releated possibilities.

* A 64-bit build
* A Solaris build with the Sun linker. 

It does **not** cover the possibility of a 64-bit build on Solaris with the Sun linker. Clearly that was an oversight on my part. 

## Likely solution
This should be hopefully quite easy to fix. spkg-install needs to consider the possibility of a 64-bit Solaris build with the Sun linker.
