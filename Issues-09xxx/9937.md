The following do not work as they should (try these examples with a freshly started copy of Sage, such that everything is default). 

This is definately a bug with the initialization of the precision:

```
# Default: 2 significant words (while we really should get only 1)
sage: pari('Pi').debug()
[&=0000000004fc9620] REAL(lg=4):0400000000000004 (+,expo=1):6000000000000001 c90fdaa22168c234 c4c6628b80dc1cd1

# Change precision and then change it back: we get 1 word
sage: n = pari.get_real_precision(); pari.set_real_precision(100); pari.set_real_precision(n);
sage: pari('Pi').debug()
[&=00000000012bf200] REAL(lg=3):0400000000000003 (+,expo=1):6000000000000001 c90fdaa22168c235
```

`set_real_precision()` seems to affect essentially only the precision for evaluating strings in PARI and not much else:

```
sage: pari.set_real_precision(50);
sage: pari('Euler')   # Precision changes
0.57721566490153286060651209008240243104215933593992
sage: pari.euler()    # Precision does NOT change
0.5772156649015328607
```

This last behaviour is actually documented in `sage/libs/pari/gen.pyx`:
> Unless otherwise indicated in the docstring, most Pari functions

In other words, the default precision is an unchangable 53 bits. I would expect `set_real_precision()` to change this.  This is also trivial to implement since the global variable `prec` is already there (and initialized once and for all to 53).

I know it is documented (although not too clearly), but the question is: does it make sense?  (In my opinion: no).
