Victor Miller reports:

```
Here's something a bit odd:

sage: F = GF(2)
sage: A = CartesianProduct(F,F)
sage: print A.random_element()

This gets a trace back and the message

TypeError: You must specify the names of the variables 
```

Here is what is happening (certainly a bug).  In the code which picks a random element from F, F is treated as a sequence and then
subscripted with a random subscript.  But (as you can verify)
evaluating F[0] or F[1] raises an error, since the `__getitem__` method of a field is used to create polynomial rings (as in F['x']).

This does not happen when you just do F.random_element() since that
has an independent implementation.

I think the fault lies in line 125 of /sage/misc/prandom.py in the
function choice() which says

```
return _pyrand().choice(seq)
```
but in your example "seq" is the field F.  It would work if that said list(seq), since

```
_pyrand().choice(F)
```
fails but

```
_pyrand().choice(list(F))
```
works.  But it would be more efficient if that choice function tried
to call a random_element() function on its  argument instead --
imagine if the field was very large, it would be stupid to construct a list of its elements for each random choice.

This works now.

And, thanks to #18411, also with the original syntax:

```
    sage: F = GF(2)
    sage: A = CartesianProduct(F,F)
    sage: print A.random_element()
    (1,0)
```

Thanks Frédéric for spotting this outdated ticket.
