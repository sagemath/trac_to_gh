This is a port of David Kohel's MAGMA code to compute dimensions of the eigenspaces for the Atkin-Lehner operators acting on spaces of cusp forms of weight 2 (see here for the original):

http://echidna.maths.usyd.edu.au/echidna/dbs/atkin-lehner/index.html

These methods do not rely on computing explicit bases of newforms, instead using formulae about the ramification points of the Atkin-Lehner operator. 

These functions use the class number method qfbclassno() from Pari/GP.

NOTES: the functions for newforms are really slow right now (much slower than MAGMA). 

The public methods supplied here are:

```
def modular_genusX0(self,w):
def atkin_lehner_eigenspace_dimensions(self):
def new_subspace_dimensionX0(self):
def atkin_lehner_new_eigenspace_dimension(self,w):
def old_subspace_dimension(self,M,R,w):
def atkin_lehner_new_eigenspace_dimensions(self):
```
Is this too many? the most important two are atkin_lehner_eigenspace_dimensions and atkin_lehner_new_eigenspace_dimension as those give the really important data about spaces of modular forms. We could make the others private if we wanted to and not lose (too) much.

<a id='comment:25'></a>This needs some serious work.

- Most of this new code is added via methods of Gamma0 modular forms space objects. However, these objects can have any weight, but the implementations here only work for weight 2, so you can type something like

```
 sage: ModularForms(1000003, 4).atkin_lehner_eigenspace_dimensions()
```
 and it will silently return wrong output. More importantly, lots of these methods (e.g. `atkin_lehner_ramification`) are computing geometric properties of the underlying modular curves, so they belong in `sage.modular.arithgroup.congroup_gamma0`. Similarly, "primitive_ideal_number" should probably be a method of order objects, not a standalone function.

- Many function names are mysterious or downright misleading, e.g. the method `modular_genus_X0` is not actually computing the genus of anything in most cases. 

- The documentation is poor. What on earth is the "(M, R)-old subspace"? What are "cyclic ideals"?  Docstrings for each method should explain what the arguments mean. The docstring for `old_subspace_dimension(self, M, R, w)` does not even mention Atkin--Lehner involutions!

- Why is a line of code in the number fields module (in `absolute_order_from_module_generators`) deleted without explanation?
