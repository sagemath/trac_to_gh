`ToricDivisor_generic.sections()` has an incorrect shortcut if the divisor is not nef. The cohomology of the divisor is computed correctly:

```
sage: rays = [(1,0,0),(0,1,0),(0,0,1),(-2,0,-1),(-2,-1,0),(-3,-1,-1),(1,1,1),(-1,0,0)]
sage: cones = [[0,1,3],[0,1,6],[0,2,4],[0,2,6],[0,3,5],[0,4,5],[1,3,7],[1,6,7],[2,4,7],[2,6,7],[3,5,7],[4,5,7]]
sage: X = ToricVariety(Fan(rays=rays,cones=cones))
sage: D = X.divisor(2); D
V(z2)
sage: D.is_nef()
False
sage:  D.sections()
()
sage: D.cohomology(dim=True)
(1, 0, 0, 0)
```
Attached one-line patch fixes this issue and adds doctest.
