This is related to #8942. The limit function can output either
`+Infinity`, `-Infinity`, or `Infinity`, the later
meaning a complex infinity. For example:

```
sage: limit(1/x, x=0, dir='above')
+Infinity
sage: limit(1/x, x=0, dir='below')
-Infinity
sage: limit(1/x, x=0)             
Infinity
```
However Sage does not distinguish `+Infinity` and `Infinity`:

```
sage: l1=limit(1/x, x=0, dir='above')
sage: l2=limit(1/x, x=0, dir='below')
sage: l3=limit(1/x, x=0)
sage: l1==l3
True
```

This is more of a problem with the equality checking rules in Sage and the coercion system than symbolics, so I'm changing the component to coercion.

If the arguments compare equal when coerced to a common parent, Sage returns `True` for the equality. In this case, the coercion goes to the `UnsignedInfinityRing`, where `+Infinity` is mapped to `unsigned_infinity`.

```
sage: UnsignedInfinityRing.has_coerce_map_from(InfinityRing)
True
sage: Infinity
+Infinity
sage: UnsignedInfinityRing.coerce(Infinity)
Infinity
```

BTW, isn't there an inconsistency in the capitalization of `Infinity`. Shouldn't it be lowercase according to Python conventions?

Sometimes it's `infinity` and others its `Infinity`. At the very least this should be consistent. Also there are other issues with infinity: #11506 #9547.

in Sage 5.11 we get:

```
sage: l1=limit(1/x, x=0, dir='right'); l1
+Infinity
sage: l2=limit(1/x, x=0, dir='left'); l2 
-Infinity
sage: l3=limit(1/x, x=0); l3             
Infinity
sage: bool(l1==l2), bool(l2==l3), bool(l3==l1)
(False, False, False)
```
however the objects returned are in SR and not in the `infinity` class:

```
sage: type(l1), l1.parent()
(sage.symbolic.expression.Expression, Symbolic Ring)
sage: p1=+Infinity
sage: type(p1), p1.parent()
(sage.rings.infinity.PlusInfinity, The Infinity Ring)
```
I propose to close that ticket, and open a new one about the above issue (or add it to an existing ticket).
