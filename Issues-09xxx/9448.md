```
When doing factor?? (either from the command line or in the notebook), the given file is in site-packages.  It should give the file in devel instead.

Example: factor??

```
Type:           function
Base Class:     <type 'function'>
String Form:    <function factor at 0x282d230>
Namespace:      Interactive
File:           /usr/local/src/sage-4.4.4/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/rings/arith.py
Definition:     factor(n, proof=None, int_=False, algorithm='pari', verbose=0, **kwds)
```

Suggested approaches during SD23 lightning talk:

Add a big note in the developer guide around where the location of the cloned branch is mentioned

Also: no source file is given for class methods, for example:
n = 60
n.factor??

```
Type:           builtin_function_or_method
Base Class:     <type 'builtin_function_or_method'>
String Form:    <built-in method factor of sage.rings.integer.Integer object at 0x428ed20>
Namespace:      Interactive
Definition:     n.factor(self, algorithm='pari', proof=True, limit=None)
Source:
    def factor(self, algorithm='pari', proof=True, limit=None):
```

In the notebook interface, n.factor?? DOES work, and it even points to the right file in the devel directory.
