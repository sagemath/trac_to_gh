Whilst there is no complete 64-bit build of Sage on Solaris x86, a sufficiently large part of Sage does build (with a few changes) on Solaris 10 x86. When built on 'fulvia', a Dell Optiplex with Xeon processors, there was a numerical noise issue - see #9099

    sage: maxima('sinh(1.0)')
Expected:
    1.175201193643801
Got:
    1.175201193643802
```

A computation with Mathematica, using 60 digits of precision gives 

```
In[2]:= N[Sinh[1],60]

Out[2]= 1.17520119364380145688238185059560081515571798133409587022957
```

The absolute error on Solaris x86 is slightly higher than seen on some other systems, but this is still a perfectly acceptable result.

This should be fairly easy to fix. I'll make a patch later today

```
or

```

Carl Witty is of the opinion this is either a Maxima or ECL bug

http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/msg/aa318e11e84afe8d?hl=en

I think its better to leave the `asinh(1.0)` case failing. It will be a constant reminder we need to get a real solution, not hack the doctest to get it to pass. 

Ultimately, I feel the doctest has discovered a bug, which is what a good test should do.
