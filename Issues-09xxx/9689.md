Whilst there is no complete 64-bit build of Sage on Solaris x86, a sufficiently large part of Sage does build (with a few changes) on Solaris 10 x86. When built on 'fulvia', a Dell Optiplex with Xeon processors, there was a numerical noise issue - see #9099

Expected:

Got:
    1.175201193643802
```

A computation with Mathematica, using 60 digits of precision gives 

```
In[2]:= N[Sinh[1],60]

Out[2]= 1.17520119364380145688238185059560081515571798133409587022957
```

The absolute error on Solaris x86 is slightly higher than seen on some other systems, but this is still a perfectly acceptable result.

This should be fairly easy to fix. I'll make a patch later today

I just realise the second failure shown on #9099

```
Expected:
    0.881373587019543
Got:
    .8813735870195429
```

is the same file (devel/sage-main/sage/symbolic/expression.pyx) as this simple numerical noise issue. Hopefully be solved too. That's a less obvious problem to solve though. 

Any ideas anyone?

It's not very pretty, but 

```
abs(float(maxima('asinh(1.0)')) - 0.881373587019543) < 1e-15
```
or

```
maxima('abs(asinh(1.0) - 0.881373587019543)') < 1e-15

work for the other test.  Or:

```
sage: float(maxima('asinh(1.0)'))

Carl Witty is of the opinion this is either a Maxima or ECL bug

http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/msg/aa318e11e84afe8d?hl=en

I think its better to leave the `asinh(1.0)` case failing. It will be a constant reminder we need to get a real solution, not hack the doctest to get it to pass. 

Ultimately, I feel the doctest has discovered a bug, which is what a good test should do.
