The version of the [GNU Scientific Library (GSL)](http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/) in Sage is 1.10, which is almost 3 years old. The latest, 1.14 was released about 4 months ago. 

There is also a large number of bugs in the `spkg-check` and `spkg-install` files
 
* `spkg-check` did not exit with a non-zero error code if the `make check` failed. It did however report the error, but it is highly likely to be missed in a large log file. This issue was reported at #9531, so that ticket can be closed when this one is closed. 
* `spkg-install` did not exit if `configure` failed to configure properly. Again the error was reported. 
* `spkg-install` did not exit if `make` failed to build GSL correctly. Again the error was reported. 
* `spkg-install` did not exit if `make install` failed to install GSL properly. Again the error was reported. 
* The self-tests were failing on some platforms, due to the fact `/bin/rm: cannot remove `libtoolT`. This was also true of the latest version, but exporting RM to "rm -f" solved that, as suggested at http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=523750



 == Note to the release managers ==

All patches are in the repository in the .spkg - nothing needs to be added to the Sage library.

I'm pretty sure we can, since I have built this multiple times on my Sun Blade 2000 SPARC with 2 threads and on my Sun Ultra 27 with 12 threads. This is outside the Sage environment, so my settings for MAKE would have been used. There were no problems building on either in parallel, so I don't think it will be a problem building with $MAKE. 

I'll test that before uploading a patch and providing a link.

In all cases, all the self-tests for GSL passed. 


I've run the doctests on sage.math. I was quite expecting to get a few failures due to different results from different algorithms that might be used in the GSL library, but to my surprise:

I'm going to upload 3 patches. The first was all the updates. The second uses {{{$MAKE}} and the final one just prints an informative message when the tests pass. Is there a sensible way of reversing these patches once they are commited, so I don't need 3 of them? Anyway, the patches are for review only. They don't need to be applied to the package. 

The first patch is quite large, as it removes a big patch.

I don't know why you want to create a single patch, but you can simply take an old vanilla GSL spkg and apply your patches in order with `hg import --no-commit ...` (or use `patch`), and after that, just do a commit.

I'll take a closer look at the package tomorrow, I think.

Yes.

Yes, good idea. It saves a few bytes.

I think its more difficult to read patches when they are very small. I'd personally rather see one patch that fixes all the problems, rather than loads of patches fixing parts of it. But I'll just add another patch here.

Leif,
I've taken your comments into account. I realised that despite what src/INSTALL says, -g -O2 were not added. So I've added them back, as they were before. I also noticed the web site I gave for the solution to the libtool problem (export RM="rm -f") was not the correct one. So I updated the web link in the description of this, and also in SPKG.txt

I also reformatted SPKG.txt so no lines are wider than 80 characters. 

I've replaced the package, so it can still be found at http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/patches/gsl-1.14.spkg

A few (more general) questions:
* Should we make sure that `$SAGE_LOCAL` is set? (in both `spkg-install` and `spkg-check`)
* Should optimization be disabled (`-O0`) if `SAGE_DEBUG` is `yes` as some other packages do?
* Anything to add if `SAGE_FAT_BINARY` is `yes`?
* I think `CFLAGS` et al. should be set in `spkg-check` as well, as `make check` usually involves compilation, too.
* Also modifying `LDFLAGS`, e.g. if `SAGE64=yes`, even if currently not directly used by upstream, should be safe.

P.S.: My intention regarding the `else ... exit 0` part was rather avoiding other people adding "dead code" below it. Looking at the (fairly small) file in whole this seems less a danger... :)

Yes, again, it may be safer to do this.

No problem. I did wonder if its best to exit a script with `exit 0` rather than just let it exit. I know you can get away without specifying an exit code, but I'm not sure if it's good practice or not.

http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/patches/gsl-1.14.spkg

It's interesting to compare compile and test times both with and without SAGE_DEBUG

* SAGE_DEBUG=yes, SAGE_CHECK unset =  30.7s
* SAGE_DEBUG unset, SAGE_CHECK unset = 50.7s
* SAGE_DEBUG=yes, SAGE_CHECK=yes 1m:24s
* SAGE_DEBUG unset, SAGE_CHECK=yes 1m:34s

So it takes 20 seconds longer to build when using optimisation. That time penalty drops to 10 seconds when the tests are run, as they obviously run quicker. (All times are measured on a 3.33 GHz Sun Ultra 27)

Well, without `exit` the script returns `$?`, which is even better, though in some cases (or bad scripts) this is not desirable.

The self-tests of GSL were successfully passed
Now cleaning up tmp files.
rm: directory /home/drkirkby/sage-4.3/spkg/build/gsl-1.14 not removed.  Cannot remove current directory
Making Sage/Python scripts relocatable...

So the GSL library has now been shown to build and pass all tests on:

I wish all the code in Sage was as portable!

You do not surprise me with regard to the doctesting framework. However, before wasting any time on them, do check to see if there are any patches recently added to trac for this, as I know there were several such patches. I'm not the release manager, but if I were, I'd get those patches in on the alpha0. If you can't rely on the test code, what can you rely on?

I think at this point in time, just merging the updated GSL is sufficient. That was the aim of the ticket. 

Other tasks, **if** we tackle them, should be on another ticket. 

There are three related issues I am aware of

* Sage ships with `blas-20070724.spkg` which is a BLAS library, and according to François Bissey, this is unnecessary, as we have ATLAS. http://groups.google.co.uk/group/sage-devel/msg/a75a7e796a5c3a91
* We should be updating ATLAS. It was agreed to update ATLAS, and I said I would do it, but it far from a trivial affair. I need to discuss with Carl Witty how to build this in parallel. ATLAS takes about 8-10 hours to build in 't2' as there are no tuning parameters for that processor. 
* I've got no idea what GSL is used for in Sage. If it's just special functions, which is quite possible, then its pointless worrying about it anyway. 

My biggest priority now is to get Sage working properly on OpenSolaris - it builds, but just dumps core as soon as one starts it. Hence I want to be able to verify the different parts of Sage are working - I'm less concerned if they are fully optimised. 

If I believe the tools on Solaris, starting Sage, before one gets to the 

```
sage:
```

prompt, there is already several memory leaks. I see the quality control issues in Sage (doctest, self-tests, memory leaks), more important than addling extra functionality, or speeding Sage up. 

Dave

Yes, I agree. I only wanted to say that regarding GSL *nothing* further has to be done - not even on a follow-up ticket.

Agree on that, too. Removing unnecessary parts or extra upstream baggage and improving the documentation are other things I consider important, the former of course less.
