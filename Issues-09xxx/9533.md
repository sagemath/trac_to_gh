The version of the [GNU Scientific Library (GSL)](http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/) in Sage is 1.10, which is almost 3 years old. The latest, 1.14 was released about 4 months ago. 

There is also a large number of bugs in the `spkg-check` and `spkg-install` files
 
* `spkg-check` did not exit with a non-zero error code if the `make check` failed. It did however report the error, but it is highly likely to be missed in a large log file. This issue was reported at #9531, so that ticket can be closed when this one is closed. 
* `spkg-install` did not exit if `configure` failed to configure properly. Again the error was reported. 
* `spkg-install` did not exit if `make` failed to build GSL correctly. Again the error was reported. 
* `spkg-install` did not exit if `make install` failed to install GSL properly. Again the error was reported. 
* The self-tests were failing on some platforms, due to the fact `/bin/rm: cannot remove `libtoolT`. This was also true of the latest version, but exporting RM to "rm -f" solved that, as suggested at http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=523750

All patches are in the repository in the .spkg - nothing needs to be added to the Sage library.

I'm pretty sure we can, since I have built this multiple times on my Sun Blade 2000 SPARC with 2 threads and on my Sun Ultra 27 with 12 threads. This is outside the Sage environment, so my settings for MAKE would have been used. There were no problems building on either in parallel, so I don't think it will be a problem building with $MAKE. 

I'll test that before uploading a patch and providing a link.

I'm convinced this is ok built in parallel. I tested it several times in parallel (outside of Sage) before you even mentioned it. But after you said this, I used $MAKE in `spkg-install` and systematically checked it on different systems

* 19 parallel builds on a Sun Ultra 27, with OpenSolaris using between 2 and 1000 threads. 
* 5 parallel builds on bsd.math, with OS 10.6, using 4 threads.
* 5 parallel builds on sage.math, with Ubunta, using 8 threads.
* 3 parallel builds on a Sun Blade 2000, with Solaris 10, using between 2 and 4 threads. (Code compiled 64-bit)
* 3 parallel builds on a Sun Blade 2000, with Solaris 10, using between 2 and 4 threads. (Code compiled 32-bit)
 
 
In all cases, all the self-tests for GSL passed. 


I've run the doctests on sage.math. I was quite expecting to get a few failures due to different results from different algorithms that might be used in the GSL library, but to my surprise:

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 1095.8 seconds
kirkby@sage:/scratch/kirkby/sage-4.5$ 
```

Here's a link to the package.

I'm going to upload 3 patches. The first was all the updates. The second uses {{{$MAKE}} and the final one just prints an informative message when the tests pass. Is there a sensible way of reversing these patches once they are commited, so I don't need 3 of them? Anyway, the patches are for review only. They don't need to be applied to the package. 

The first patch is quite large, as it removes a big patch.

I don't know why you want to create a single patch, but you can simply take an old vanilla GSL spkg and apply your patches in order with `hg import --no-commit ...` (or use `patch`), and after that, just do a commit.

I'll take a closer look at the package tomorrow, I think.

Yes.

Yes, good idea. It saves a few bytes.

I think its more difficult to read patches when they are very small. I'd personally rather see one patch that fixes all the problems, rather than loads of patches fixing parts of it. But I'll just add another patch here.

Leif,
I've taken your comments into account. I realised that despite what src/INSTALL says, -g -O2 were not added. So I've added them back, as they were before. I also noticed the web site I gave for the solution to the libtool problem (export RM="rm -f") was not the correct one. So I updated the web link in the description of this, and also in SPKG.txt

I also reformatted SPKG.txt so no lines are wider than 80 characters. 

I've replaced the package, so it can still be found at http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/patches/gsl-1.14.spkg

A few (more general) questions:
* Should we make sure that `$SAGE_LOCAL` is set? (in both `spkg-install` and `spkg-check`)
* Should optimization be disabled (`-O0`) if `SAGE_DEBUG` is `yes` as some other packages do?
* Anything to add if `SAGE_FAT_BINARY` is `yes`?
* I think `CFLAGS` et al. should be set in `spkg-check` as well, as `make check` usually involves compilation, too.
* Also modifying `LDFLAGS`, e.g. if `SAGE64=yes`, even if currently not directly used by upstream, should be safe.

P.S.: My intention regarding the `else ... exit 0` part was rather avoiding other people adding "dead code" below it. Looking at the (fairly small) file in whole this seems less a danger... :)

Yes, again, it may be safer to do this.

No problem. I did wonder if its best to exit a script with `exit 0` rather than just let it exit. I know you can get away without specifying an exit code, but I'm not sure if it's good practice or not.

I've made those changes. The package can be found here

http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/patches/gsl-1.14.spkg

It's interesting to compare compile and test times both with and without SAGE_DEBUG

* SAGE_DEBUG=yes, SAGE_CHECK unset =  30.7s
* SAGE_DEBUG unset, SAGE_CHECK unset = 50.7s
* SAGE_DEBUG=yes, SAGE_CHECK=yes 1m:24s
* SAGE_DEBUG unset, SAGE_CHECK=yes 1m:34s

So it takes 20 seconds longer to build when using optimisation. That time penalty drops to 10 seconds when the tests are run, as they obviously run quicker. (All times are measured on a 3.33 GHz Sun Ultra 27)

Well, without `exit` the script returns `$?`, which is even better, though in some cases (or bad scripts) this is not desirable.

The self-tests of GSL were successfully passed
Now cleaning up tmp files.

So the GSL library has now been shown to build and pass all tests on:

* FreeBSD

I wish all the code in Sage was as portable!

As a final change, could we clarify the ATLAS/CBLAS issue in `SPKG.txt`, i.e.
* Dependencies: **None** - GSL does currently **not** depend on any other Sage package (though ATLAS is currently listed in `spkg/standard/deps`
* Add a *"Special Update/Build Instructions"* section that mentions that GSL could **in principle** use ATLAS's CBLAS implementation rather than the one shipped with GSL (but so far never did in Sage).

Currently building Sage 4.5.1 with GSL 1.14 from scratch...

(I've already tested the spkg with 4.5 "final" on two machines, but only by forcing installation of the new package. This btw discovered even more flaws in the doctesting "frame"work regarding parallel testing and timeouts on the slower machine...)

I think at this point in time, just merging the updated GSL is sufficient. That was the aim of the ticket. 

Other tasks, **if** we tackle them, should be on another ticket. 

There are three related issues I am aware of

* Sage ships with `blas-20070724.spkg` which is a BLAS library, and according to François Bissey, this is unnecessary, as we have ATLAS. http://groups.google.co.uk/group/sage-devel/msg/a75a7e796a5c3a91
* We should be updating ATLAS. It was agreed to update ATLAS, and I said I would do it, but it far from a trivial affair. I need to discuss with Carl Witty how to build this in parallel. ATLAS takes about 8-10 hours to build in 't2' as there are no tuning parameters for that processor. 
* I've got no idea what GSL is used for in Sage. If it's just special functions, which is quite possible, then its pointless worrying about it anyway. 

My biggest priority now is to get Sage working properly on OpenSolaris - it builds, but just dumps core as soon as one starts it. Hence I want to be able to verify the different parts of Sage are working - I'm less concerned if they are fully optimised. 

If I believe the tools on Solaris, starting Sage, before one gets to the 

```
sage:
```

prompt, there is already several memory leaks. I see the quality control issues in Sage (doctest, self-tests, memory leaks), more important than addling extra functionality, or speeding Sage up. 

Dave

Yes, I agree. I only wanted to say that regarding GSL *nothing* further has to be done - not even on a follow-up ticket.

I now accept you were right over this (someone else has [confirmed you were right on comp.unix.shell](http://groups.google.com/group/comp.unix.shell/browse_thread/thread/8541f3ab19a1766b#)).  I've made what I think are all the changes you suggest now.

The package is at
