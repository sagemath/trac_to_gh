I think this is more of a documentation problem. We don't have any explanation of how to work with symbolic expressions, either traversing the tree using `operator()` and `operands()` or pattern matching with `find()` and `match()`.

I don't think adding a function like Jason suggests in[comment:3](#comment%3A3) would provide anything more than that is already there. Note that in the example worksheet Jason also doesn't use this function.

I suggest to close this ticket unless there is a more concrete suggestion.

That certainly counts as one example.   I don't know that people will know what to do with `'MTIMES'` :-)

Basically, an introduction to how to write something like this for people who don't know jack about expression trees (like me, though teaching it certainly helped) is what would be helpful here.
