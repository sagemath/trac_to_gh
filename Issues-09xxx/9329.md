The desire is to have clear documentation on how to apply (e.g.) factor() to just some piece of this, such as the exponent.

Did you have something specific in mind?  You can always get at the underlying tree with operand() and operands()

```
sage: var('n')
n
sage: g = e^((n*pi-pi*2))
sage: g.operator(), g.operands()
(exp, [-2*pi + pi*n])
```

This is what is done in expression_conversions.py

I think this is more of a documentation problem. We don't have any explanation of how to work with symbolic expressions, either traversing the tree using `operator()` and `operands()` or pattern matching with `find()` and `match()`.

I don't think adding a function like Jason suggests in [comment:3](#comment%3A3) would provide anything more than that is already there. Note that in the example worksheet Jason also doesn't use this function.

I suggest to close this ticket unless there is a more concrete suggestion.

Resurrecting the original idea because I want this for my discrete math class in a couple days and realize that even having a very basic example of how to use `Converter` to make an expression tree - say one I could plot! - would be really useful.  Right now I'm stuck with Jason's idea, which works but perhaps isn't as "Sage-ic".

```
sage: from sage.symbolic.random_tests import random_expr
sage: S = random_expr(20,nvars=2)
sage: S
sinh_integral(-sec(-4*abs(e))/((kronecker_delta(e, v1) - 52)*arctan(elliptic_kc(-2) - 2)))
sage: def tree(expr):
....:     if expr.operator() is None:
....:         return expr
....:     else:
....:         return [expr.operator()]+map(tree,expr.operands())
....:     
sage: tree(S)
[sinh_integral, [<built-in function mul>, [<built-in function pow>, [<built-in function add>, [kronecker_delta, [exp, 1], v1], -52], -1], [<built-in function pow>, [arctan, [<built-in function add>, [elliptic_kc, -2], -2]], -1], [sec, [<built-in function mul>, [abs, [exp, 1]], -4]], -1]]
```
I'm realizing it might even be useful to have a (binary) tree returned from a list of lists... but that wouldn't be here.

That certainly counts as one example.   I don't know that people will know what to do with `'MTIMES'` :-)

Basically, an introduction to how to write something like this for people who don't know jack about expression trees (like me, though teaching it certainly helped) is what would be helpful here.
