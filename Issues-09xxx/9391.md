If P is a 'kolyvagin_point' created from an elliptic curve, the doc string says

```
Definition: P.kolyvagin_cohomology_class(self, n=None)
Docstring:
       INPUT:
    
          * n -- positive integer that divides the gcd of a_p and p+1 for
            all p dividing the conductor.  If n is None, choose the
            largest valid n.
```
In fact, if "n" is None, a ValueError is thrown.

The problem happens when the conductor is 1.

```
sage: y = EllipticCurve('389a').heegner_point(-7,1)
sage: y.conductor()
1
sage: P=y.kolyvagin_cohomology_class()
BOOM
```
This is because the gcd of the empty list is 0. I do not know what to do to solve the issue.
