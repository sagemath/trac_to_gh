```
At the moment, module morphisms are only allowed between modules with bases having the same base ring.

This patch allows a wider class of codomains, namely any parent with  a base ring having a coerce map from the base ring of domain:

```
    codomain.base_ring().has_coerce_map_from( domain.base_ring() )
```
is replaced by

```
    hasattr( codomain, 'base_ring' ) and
        codomain.base_ring().has_coerce_map_from( domain.base_ring() )
```

Also, module morphisms are not restricted anymore to having codomains being modules with basis but rings are allowed as well.

Here are several examples included in the code:

module morphisms from a module with basis to its base ring

```
                sage: X = CombinatorialFreeModule(QQ,[1,-1])
                sage: phi = X.module_morphism( on_basis=lambda i: i, codomain=QQ )
                sage: phi( 2 * X.monomial(1) + 3 * X.monomial(-1) )
                -1
```

module morphisms from a module with basis to a base extension of its base ring

```
                sage: phi = X.module_morphism(on_basis= lambda i: i, codomain=RR )
                sage: phi( 2 * X.monomial(1) + 3 * X.monomial(-1) )
                -1.00000000000000
```

module morphisms from a module with basis to a module with basis over a base extension

```
                sage: R2 = CombinatorialFreeModule(RR,['x','y'])
                sage: C  = CombinatorialFreeModule(CC,['z'])
                sage: x  = X.monomial('x')
                sage: y  = X.monomial('y')
                sage: z  = Y.monomial('z')
                sage: def on_basis( a ):
                    if a == 'x':
                        return CC(1) * z
                    elif a == 'y':
                        return CC(I) * z
                ....:
                sage: phi = R2.module_morphism( on_basis=on_basis, codomain=C )
                sage: v = 3 * x + 2 * y
                3.00000000000000*B['x'] + 2.00000000000000*B['y']
                sage: phi(v)
                (3.00000000000000+2.00000000000000*I)*B['z']
```
