The current state is not ideal.  One either uses `bar_chart`, which doesn't allow any control of where the bars actually go, or `IndexedSequence.plot_histogram`, which looks sort of clunky (at least the one example in the doc).  Matplotlib has very nice bar charts and histograms, obviously, so combining the approaches of these two to unify this would be very good.  Ideally one could do labels or place bars of given height at various locations.

Note that we have `np.histogram` if you want as well.

And `TimeSeries.histogram?`

Also here is something random in some code of Willliam's: 

```
def dist(v, b, left=float(0), right=float(pi)):
    """
    We divide the interval between left (default: 0) and 
    right (default: pi) up into b bins.
   
    For each number in v (which must left and right), 
    we find which bin it lies in and add this to a counter.
    This function then returns the bins and the number of
    elements of v that lie in each one. 

    ALGORITHM: To find the index of the bin that a given 
    number x lies in, we multiply x by b/length and take the 
    floor. 
    """
    length = right - left
    normalize = float(b/length)
    vals = {}
    d = dict([(i,0) for i in range(b)])
    for x in v:
        n = int(normalize*(float(x)-left))
        d[n] += 1
    return d, len(v)
    
def graph(d, b, num=5000, left=float(0), right=float(pi)):
    s = Graphics()
    left = float(left); right = float(right)
    length = right - left
    w = length/b
    k = 0
    for i, n in d.iteritems():
        k += n
        # ith bin has n objects in it. 
        s += polygon([(w*i+left,0), (w*(i+1)+left,0), \
                     (w*(i+1)+left, n/(num*w)), (w*i+left, n/(num*w))],\
                     rgbcolor=(0,0,0.5))
    return s    
```

The point being that this should be unified.

Looks like all four patches need to be used, at least for the ticket if not for the pure functionality.

> What needs to be done for this histogram patch?

Good question.  I'd say, for one, that it would be very good to have more documentation - nobody actually plots histograms with four data points.  We would also want some examples of the multiple data sets option.  Someone to go over the code again... 

On a different ticket, we might want to change the `TimeSeries` histogram and the `RealDistribution` histograms as well to use this, I'm not quite sure what they are up to.  It's not very unified.  But that would be a second step.

This is good. I don't see any problems with this patch. It provides a basic histogram support that was missing in Sage.

Regarding `RealDistribution` - this can be done in another ticket. Regarding `TimeSeries` - the histogram function there should not be replaced with this one, because that one does not return a plot.

If there are no objections, we should do the following:

1. Merge this ticket
2. Open a new ticket for `TimeSeries` to add a `histogram_plot` method to it (or something named similarly)
3. Open another new ticket for `RealDistribution` to modify its `RealDistribution.generate_histogram_plot` to be an alias to  or call this function. That one has some additional parameters which we have to take care of.

For completeness, here are the (relevant) failing tests.

```
    g = Histogram(range(4), [1,3,2,0], {}); g
    Histogram(range(3), [10,3,5], {'width':0.7})
    g = Histogram(range(4), [1,3,2,0], {})

    TypeError: __init__() takes exactly 3 arguments (4 given)
(this is probably because they're taken from bar_chart but a histogram only takes one list)

    histogram([1,2,10])
    histogram([1,2,3,4])
    histogram([-3,4,-6,11])
(all give)
    Graphics object consisting of 1 graphics primitive
(maybe this is from the change in display hook in Ipython)

Failed example:
    histogram([-3,5,-6,11], rgbcolor=(1,0,0))
Expected nothing
Got:
    doctest:239: FormatterWarning: Exception in text/plain formatter: Unknown property rgbcolor
    None
```
Also, `get_minmax_data` doesn't even have any doctests, and one of the ones that fails now because of `g` not being defined in `_allowed_options` will need to be updated since there are a lot more options in the histograms (and this should be easy).

Wow, more to do than I realized.  http://matplotlib.org/_sources/examples/pylab_examples/histogram_demo_extended.txt is a useful resource.

But I do agree that the underlying matplotlib functionality is very likely to be awesome.  And in fact there are even more options now
