This definitely needs documentation work.  But the code seems to work okay.

Note that we have `np.histogram` if you want as well.

And `TimeSeries.histogram?`

Also here is something random in some code of Willliam's: 

```
def dist(v, b, left=float(0), right=float(pi)):
    """
    We divide the interval between left (default: 0) and 
    right (default: pi) up into b bins.
   
    For each number in v (which must left and right), 
    we find which bin it lies in and add this to a counter.
    This function then returns the bins and the number of
    elements of v that lie in each one. 

    ALGORITHM: To find the index of the bin that a given 
    number x lies in, we multiply x by b/length and take the 
    floor. 
    """
    length = right - left
    normalize = float(b/length)
    vals = {}
    d = dict([(i,0) for i in range(b)])
    for x in v:
        n = int(normalize*(float(x)-left))
        d[n] += 1
    return d, len(v)
    
def graph(d, b, num=5000, left=float(0), right=float(pi)):
    s = Graphics()
    left = float(left); right = float(right)
    length = right - left
    w = length/b
    k = 0
    for i, n in d.iteritems():
        k += n
        # ith bin has n objects in it. 
        s += polygon([(w*i+left,0), (w*(i+1)+left,0), \
                     (w*(i+1)+left, n/(num*w)), (w*i+left, n/(num*w))],\
                     rgbcolor=(0,0,0.5))
    return s    
```

The point being that this should be unified.

Looks like all four patches need to be used, at least for the ticket if not for the pure functionality.

> What needs to be done for this histogram patch?

Good question.  I'd say, for one, that it would be very good to have more documentation - nobody actually plots histograms with four data points.  We would also want some examples of the multiple data sets option.  Someone to go over the code again... 

On a different ticket, we might want to change the `TimeSeries` histogram and the `RealDistribution` histograms as well to use this, I'm not quite sure what they are up to.  It's not very unified.  But that would be a second step.

This is good. I don't see any problems with this patch. It provides a basic histogram support that was missing in Sage.

Regarding `RealDistribution` - this can be done in another ticket. Regarding `TimeSeries` - the histogram function there should not be replaced with this one, because that one does not return a plot.

If there are no objections, we should do the following:

1. Merge this ticket
2. Open a new ticket for `TimeSeries` to add a `histogram_plot` method to it (or something named similarly)
3. Open another new ticket for `RealDistribution` to modify its `RealDistribution.generate_histogram_plot` to be an alias to  or call this function. That one has some additional parameters which we have to take care of.

For completeness, here are the (relevant) failing tests.

```
    g = Histogram(range(4), [1,3,2,0], {}); g
    Histogram(range(3), [10,3,5], {'width':0.7})
    g = Histogram(range(4), [1,3,2,0], {})
    g = Histogram(range(4), [1,3,2,0], {})
(all give)
    TypeError: __init__() takes exactly 3 arguments (4 given)
(this is probably because they're taken from bar_chart but a histogram only takes one list)

    histogram([1,2,10])
    histogram([1,2,3,4])
    histogram([-3,4,-6,11])
(all give)
    Graphics object consisting of 1 graphics primitive
(maybe this is from the change in display hook in Ipython)

Failed example:
    histogram([-3,5,-6,11], rgbcolor=(1,0,0))
Expected nothing
Got:
    doctest:239: FormatterWarning: Exception in text/plain formatter: Unknown property rgbcolor
    None
```
Also, `get_minmax_data` doesn't even have any doctests, and one of the ones that fails now because of `g` not being defined in `_allowed_options` will need to be updated since there are a lot more options in the histograms (and this should be easy).  And `_repr_` makes no sense - what is an `n` datalist?  Oh, *and* we want to document the multiple dataset option.  Wow, more to do than I realized.  http://matplotlib.org/_sources/examples/pylab_examples/histogram_demo_extended.txt is a useful resource.

But I do agree that the underlying matplotlib functionality is very likely to be awesome.  And in fact there are even more options now
