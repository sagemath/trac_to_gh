If you run the code `P.random_element().complex_roots()` a few more times, you get a segfault:

```
sage: P.random_element().complex_roots()


------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred in Sage.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* component
of Sage has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
or is not properly wrapped with _sig_on, _sig_off.
You might want to run Sage under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
Sage will now terminate (sorry).

By the way, it is not clear to me why the milestone was set to sage-5.0.  I thought that was for Windows-related issues.  Please correct me if I'm wrong.

The fix works and makes sense to me (positive review for that). I've added a doctest (needs review), and rebased the original patch against 4.8.alpha5.

Unfortunately, something is wrong with exceptions at the moment:

```
sage: (a*x).complex_roots()
ERROR: An unexpected error occurred while tokenizing input
The following traceback may be corrupted or invalid
The error message is: ('EOF in multi-line statement', (1731, 0))
...
```

and that's fixed by Simon King's patch in #11900, so I've added a dependency there. The milestone update is to match #11900.
