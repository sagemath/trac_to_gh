Obviously the following code should raise an error (which is correctly given at the end), but it shouldn't be trying to `free()` non-aligned pointers.

```

TypeError: Unable to convert x (='2*a^2+6*a+6') to real number.
```
If you run the code `P.random_element().complex_roots()` a few more times, you get a segfault:

```
sage: P.random_element().complex_roots()


------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred in Sage.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* component
of Sage has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
or is not properly wrapped with _sig_on, _sig_off.
You might want to run Sage under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
Sage will now terminate (sorry).
------------------------------------------------------------
```
Environment: Sage 4.5.2 on Mac OS X 10.5.8 (32 bit).

The bug is caused by a deallocation method trying to clean up all coefficients of a polynomial, which segfaults if not all coefficients have been initialised, which in turn happens if the init gets wrong input.  The attached patch should fix this.

By the way, it is not clear to me why the milestone was set to sage-5.0.  I thought that was for Windows-related issues.  Please correct me if I'm wrong.

The fix works and makes sense to me (positive review for that). I've added a doctest (needs review), and rebased the original patch against 4.8.alpha5.

Unfortunately, something is wrong with exceptions at the moment:

```
sage: (a*x).complex_roots()
ERROR: An unexpected error occurred while tokenizing input
The following traceback may be corrupted or invalid
The error message is: ('EOF in multi-line statement', (1731, 0))
...
```

and that's fixed by Simon King's patch in #11900, so I've added a dependency there. The milestone update is to match #11900.
