Attachment: **[trac-9910_reviewer.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9910/trac-9910_reviewer.patch.gz)**

I'm OK with most of your patch. But here are some general comments:

* I don't quite understand this documentation:

```
        - ``s`` (vertex) -- forces the source of the path. Set to               
          ``None`` by default.                                                  
                                                                                
        - ``t`` (vertex) -- forces the destination of the path. Set to          
          ``None`` by default.
```
 What do you mean by "forces", etc. You need to elaborate here.

* The following code block

```
            if self._directed:
                from sage.graphs.all import DiGraph
                return [0, DiGraph()] if weighted else DiGraph()
            else:
                from sage.graphs.all import Graph
                return [0, Graph()] if weighted else Graph()
```
 is equivalent to

```
            if self._directed:
                from sage.graphs.all import DiGraph
                return [0, DiGraph()] if weighted else DiGraph()
            from sage.graphs.all import Graph
            return [0, Graph()] if weighted else Graph()
```

* You really need to start seriously writing Python code that conforms to Python coding conventions (wherever possible); see [PEP 8](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for more information.

Most of the above issues are fixed in my reviewer patch.

Hello !!!

Here is a patch to import on top of your, to fix the documentation. These options are just a way for the user to compute the "longest path leaving from s", or the "longest path ending in t", or the "longest s-t-path"

About the if/else, I knew it was not useful but I let it stay anyway thinking it would be easier to understand the code. When I look at it from afar, I like to see a If/Else with return lines at the end of both, which ensures the method ends because of this part of the code (and I like to preserve symmetry when there is no reason not to `^^;`). That's just me, if you think it's better without the "else", then let it be.

I am really sorry you had to waste time fixing my spaces and long lines. I know I never paid attention to spaces, but I will from now on, and I thought I was wary enough of long lines, which is clearly untrue. I also thought I had learned not to write ``x == None`` too... `:-/`

Here is the slight fix in the documentation you asked. If it suits you, the ticket is good to go.

Thank you for your precious help, once again !

Your improved documentation is certainly very clear to me. But note a typo in the following:

```
4384	          returns the longest path starting at ``s``). Thie argument is Set to 
```

I think you mean "The" instead of "Thie". And two more in these lines:

```
4388	        - ``s`` (vertex) -- forces the destination of the path (the method then 
4389	          returns the longest path ending at ``s``). Thie argument is Set to 
```

I think you mean the above to be about the argument "t", as opposed to repeating the documentation for the argument "s". If you fix these, then the ticket is good to go.

I care about your code and how fast it runs. That's why I suggested that you use "is not" or "is" when you do a comparison with "None", because in that case the comparison is faster than if you used "!=" or "=".

This is a comment from an outsider, so it may not make much sense: you mention in the docstring that this problem is NP-hard, and I agree there doesn't seem to be an algorithm that is polinomial in the number of edges, but:

In the paper 

http://dutta.csc.ncsu.edu/csc791_spring07/wrap/circuits_johnson.pdf

there is an algorithm to list all elementary circuits in a graph that is linear in the number of circuits. This algorithm is implemented in version 1.4 of networkx:

https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/394

Is the situation for paths instead of circuits much different? Is a MILP algorithm better than listing all elementary paths by a Johnson-like algorithm and finding the max lenght? Maybe MILP is better in practice but is it in theory?

Hello !

> Is the situation for paths instead of circuits much different?

The situation for directed graphs is not different at all : by just replacing each undirected edge by two edges, on in each direction, you transform one problem into the other. Besides, your algorithms shouldn't make much more operations than necessary because of the transformation.

>  Is a MILP algorithm better than listing all elementary paths by a Johnson-like algorithm and finding the max lenght? Maybe MILP is better in practice but is it in theory?

Let me first begin by saying that I can not *stand* complexity theory. I mean -- I like the theory, some of its conjectures, it sometimes says interesting things, and even though it is most of the times for bad reasons (see *) it motivates people to do research on maths, which is perfectly nice.

This being said, many recent results and directions of research in complexity have forgotten practice a long time ago. They are still interesting results, they are still analysis of what our modelling of "what is an efficient algorith" is, (*) but there is a point where this modelling is not representative of the reality anymore (at which point we are expected to adapt our theory).
So in theory, no there are no differences between those two algorithms. Well, perhaps there is one : it is very hard to analyse the runtime of a specific linear program, especially when it makes use of many heuristics hidden in the LP solvers (and CPLEX and GLPK may behave very differently on the same instance, even though they are given the same formulations). On the other hand, I suspect it should be possible to produce graphs for which listing all the paths before finding one of maximum length (usually you would need to enumerat them all to be sure you found the best one, but if you happen to find a hamiltonian path at some point you needn't press further) takes an exponential time.
Which means I can not prove the LP is faster than the complete enumeration. Of course -- nothing more than that -- it is probably possible to do it anyway, my ignorance hopefully being a personnal drama :-D

To answer further, there is an heuristic added to the Longest Path method in Sage. It works by randomly extending paths, for as long as possible, with some other healthy rules to go back in the exploration if bad choices have been made. It isn't the algorithm you mentionned, but it is a good way to get an idea of their relative performances without having to implement the actual enumeration.

Let me also add that if you were willing to implement this enumeration (and then again, I of course have no proof LP is better. Especially when we can put complexity analysis to death by saying -- "we are just interested in practical instances", which can not be defined. That's precisely where a simple programming trick can divide the running time by 100 even though Theory does not see the difference), using the NetworkX implementation would be a very bad choice, considering it is written in Python.

Note for myself : if I want to lead my war against complexity further, I first need to study it much more :-)
