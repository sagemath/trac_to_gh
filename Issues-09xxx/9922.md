leif suggested at #9433 that we add a file to SAGE_ROOT containing release notes

Perhaps the release notes could be produced using mvngu's [rnotes script](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mvngu/apps/rnotes/) (also available at [http://bitbucket.org/mvngu/rnotes/](http://bitbucket.org/mvngu/rnotes/).  We could in fact (with his permission) include that script with Sage, and then run it as part of the sage-sdist script.  It might be better to not automate its creation, though.

W.r.t. `VERSION.txt`: I think a single line containing the current version (perhaps also including *"[last] upgraded from ..."*) in plain format should be sufficient; cf. also #9434 and `local/bin/sage-banner`.

In sage-sdist, should we write VERSION.txt to `SAGE_ROOT`, or should we create a symlink to `spkg/standard/VERSION.txt`?

At the very least we could probably add the sum total changelog to `SAGE_ROOT`.  Which I notice is no longer on the website, only the individual changelogs...
