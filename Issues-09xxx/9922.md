leif suggested at #9433 that we add a file to SAGE_ROOT containing release notes

Perhaps the release notes could be produced using mvngu's [rnotes script](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mvngu/apps/rnotes/) (also available at [http://bitbucket.org/mvngu/rnotes/](http://bitbucket.org/mvngu/rnotes/).  We could in fact (with his permission) include that script with Sage, and then run it as part of the sage-sdist script.  It might be better to not automate its creation, though.
