factor() is extremely slow at factoring large perfect powers (with a nontrivial base).

```
sage: %time factor(next_prime(10^20)^150)
CPU times: user 0.75 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.75 s
Wall time: 0.75 s
100000000000000000039^150
sage: %time factor(next_prime(10^20)^250)
CPU times: user 2.68 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 2.68 s
Wall time: 2.69 s
100000000000000000039^250
sage: %time factor(next_prime(10^20)^500)
CPU times: user 13.19 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 13.19 s
Wall time: 13.20 s
100000000000000000039^500
```
For comparison, SymPy handles such numbers in an instant:

```
sage: from sympy import factorint
sage: %time factorint(next_prime(10^20)^150)
CPU times: user 0.01 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.01 s
Wall time: 0.01 s
{100000000000000000039L: 150}
sage: %time factorint(next_prime(10^20)^250)
CPU times: user 0.01 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.01 s
Wall time: 0.01 s
{100000000000000000039L: 250}
sage: %time factorint(next_prime(10^20)^500)
CPU times: user 0.02 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.02 s
Wall time: 0.02 s
{100000000000000000039L: 500}
```
Perfect power testing is very cheap, so it should be attempted early on for large numbers.
