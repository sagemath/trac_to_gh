Patch applied fine to 4.4.3.alpha0.  Code looks fine, and all tests in sage/rings/polynomial pass.

Note (needs another ticket?)   I do not think that this is correct:

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: R(100).squarefree_decomposition()
100
```
But it works better now than it did before by a long way, so I will give this a positive review and suggest that another ticket is opened.

Thanks! As with factoring, we don't decompose the unit part. There should probably be at least a note about this.
