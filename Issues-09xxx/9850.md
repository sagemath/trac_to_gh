A first version is now attached.  It simply sets some new colors using the customization options for the Sphinx default theme:

http://sphinx.pocoo.org/theming.html

The second attachment shows a screenshot of what this patch does.

Niles, could you later rework the patch to move the changes to

`SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/doc/common/themes/sage/theme.conf`

instead?  You can set [pygments_style](http://sphinx.pocoo.org/config.html#confval-pygments_style) to use alternate syntax highlights.  Here's a list of Pygments' builtin styles:

```python
sage: from pygments.styles import STYLE_MAP

I did try this, but I'm afraid it didn't seem to work.  I tried both uncommenting the lines that were already there, such as 

```
footerbgcolor    =  #B8B9F6
```

and also adding the dict `html_theme_options` from `conf.py`, but neither of these were recognized . . . in fact, when I change `theme.conf` and try to rebuild the documentation, I get "all targets are up to date", so maybe I need to issue a different rebuild command (rather than, e.g. `sage -docbuild constructions html`).



>

this also doesn't seem to work from `theme.conf`, but does from `conf.py`.

{{{
 #!python

I tried these out, but most of them are worse than the default (which is not the same as when I set `pygments_style = 'default'`).  `manni` comes the closest to being usable (and better), but the color of sage output is too-light gray.

The thread on sage-devel cited in the description suggested using `sage -docbuild all html -j -S -a`; the flag "-S" says to pass the rest of the options to Sphinx, and "-a" tells Sphinx to build all files, not just changed ones.  So this command should force the whole thing to be rebuilt.

(It would probably suffice for your purposes to use `sage -docbuild tutorial html -j -S -a` to just build one document instead of all of them, of course.)

ah, thanks for that reminder :)  

A little more testing and I still can't get it to work, but I'm getting closer to the issue.  Setting the `html_style_options` dict does nothing -- style reverts to usual settings.  Uncommenting the lines as I indicated above will obviously not work: `#` is the comment character!  Wrapping the css colors in quotes, as in 

```
footerbgcolor    =  "#B8B9F6"
```

does *something*, but not the expected thing.  I.e., the color changes, but not to what I indicated . . . confusing.

When (re)building documentation, I would first delete the whole output directory and then proceed with the (re)building: 

```sh
$ cd SAGE_ROOT
$ rm -rf devel/sage-main/doc/output/
$ ./sage -docbuild --no-pdf-links all html 2>&1 | tee -a dochtml.log
```

This guarantees that the documentation I'm interested in (re)building would build, regardless of whether I have made any changes.

I applied the most recent patch (by jpalmieri) and totally rebuilt the html reference manual.

It looks real good to me - the light yellow for code blocks seems to contrast well with python keywords (green), sage prompt (orangish-brown), strings (blue) and most-everything-else (black).  It seems just a slightly lighter shade than Trac uses for the description box at the top of a ticket.  No matter what, a big improvement to my eye over the previous green.

There's a few heavyweights on this ticket already, and maybe there are more additions or modifications coming (I can't see any myself).  So I don't think I'm the one to flip this to positive review, but I'm a big +1 to the whole ticket, and specifically to John's roll-up patch applying properly and to Minh's design sense with the yellow code blocks.

Thanks Niles for starting this, and thanks to Mitesh, Mihn and John for their contributions.

Thanks!  It also renders as expected with Opera on Mac.  The site [netrenderer](http://ipinfo.info/netrenderer/) provides a service rendering pages with various versions of internet explorer and returning an image; in case no one has a windows machine to test this on.  According to those images, we have the following:

* IE 8: renders the page just like other browsers do
* IE 7: same, except the sage logo (which looks fine) shows up on the right side of the page, between the "next" and "index" buttons; this happens with the  [current documentation](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/tutorial/index.html) too though.
* IE 6: same logo placement as IE 7, and transparent background shows as gray

probably none of these are show-stoppers, but worth mentioning I think.
