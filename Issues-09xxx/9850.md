A first version is now attached.  It simply sets some new colors using the customization options for the Sphinx default theme:

http://sphinx.pocoo.org/theming.html

Niles, could you later rework the patch to move the changes to

`SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/doc/common/themes/sage/theme.conf`

instead?  You can set [pygments_style](http://sphinx.pocoo.org/config.html#confval-pygments_style) to use alternate syntax highlights.  Here's a list of Pygments' builtin styles:

```python
sage: from pygments.styles import STYLE_MAP
sage: STYLE_MAP.keys()
['manni', 'colorful', 'murphy', 'autumn', 'bw', 'pastie', 'native', 'perldoc', 'borland', 'trac', 'default', 'fruity', 'vs', 'emacs', 'friendly']
```

I did try this, but I'm afraid it didn't seem to work.  I tried both uncommenting the lines that were already there, such as 

```
footerbgcolor    =  #B8B9F6
```

and also adding the dict `html_theme_options` from `conf.py`, but neither of these were recognized . . . in fact, when I change `theme.conf` and try to rebuild the documentation, I get "all targets are up to date", so maybe I need to issue a different rebuild command (rather than, e.g. `sage -docbuild constructions html`).



>

this also doesn't seem to work from `theme.conf`, but does from `conf.py`.

The thread on sage-devel cited in the description suggested using `sage -docbuild all html -j -S -a`; the flag "-S" says to pass the rest of the options to Sphinx, and "-a" tells Sphinx to build all files, not just changed ones.  So this command should force the whole thing to be rebuilt.

(It would probably suffice for your purposes to use `sage -docbuild tutorial html -j -S -a` to just build one document instead of all of them, of course.)

ah, thanks for that reminder :)  

A little more testing and I still can't get it to work, but I'm getting closer to the issue.  Setting the `html_style_options` dict does nothing -- style reverts to usual settings.  Uncommenting the lines as I indicated above will obviously not work: `#` is the comment character!  Wrapping the css colors in quotes, as in 

```
footerbgcolor    =  "#B8B9F6"
```

does *something*, but not the expected thing.  I.e., the color changes, but not to what I indicated . . . confusing.

When (re)building documentation, I would first delete the whole output directory and then proceed with the (re)building: 

```sh
$ cd SAGE_ROOT
$ rm -rf devel/sage-main/doc/output/
$ ./sage -docbuild --no-pdf-links all html 2>&1 | tee -a dochtml.log
```

This guarantees that the documentation I'm interested in (re)building would build, regardless of whether I have made any changes. In niles' case where changes were observed to not take place, I find the approach above worked for me. With that in mind, I have attached a reviewer patch with the following changes:

* Use a very pale yellow for the code background colour.
* Annotate most of the hex colour code with descriptive English names. All names were taken from [this site](http://www.perbang.dk).

See the attachment [attachment: reviewer-style.png.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9850/reviewer-style.png.gz) for a preview of the new colour for the code background. I'm OK with niles' patch. What we need now is for someone other than me to look over my changes.

I agree with this comment.  I'm attaching a patch (intended to replace the others) which does this.

I applied the most recent patch (by jpalmieri) and totally rebuilt the html reference manual.

It looks real good to me - the light yellow for code blocks seems to contrast well with python keywords (green), sage prompt (orangish-brown), strings (blue) and most-everything-else (black).  It seems just a slightly lighter shade than Trac uses for the description box at the top of a ticket.  No matter what, a big improvement to my eye over the previous green.

There's a few heavyweights on this ticket already, and maybe there are more additions or modifications coming (I can't see any myself).  So I don't think I'm the one to flip this to positive review, but I'm a big +1 to the whole ticket, and specifically to John's roll-up patch applying properly and to Minh's design sense with the yellow code blocks.

Thanks Niles for starting this, and thanks to Mitesh, Mihn and John for their contributions.

Replying to [@jhpalmieri](#comment%3A14):
> I put a copy of the tutorial [on sage.math](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/palmieri/misc/tutorial/)

Thanks!  It also renders as expected with Opera on Mac.  The site [netrenderer](http://ipinfo.info/netrenderer/) provides a service rendering pages with various versions of internet explorer and returning an image; in case no one has a windows machine to test this on.  According to those images, we have the following:

* IE 8: renders the page just like other browsers do
* IE 7: same, except the sage logo (which looks fine) shows up on the right side of the page, between the "next" and "index" buttons; this happens with the  [current documentation](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/tutorial/index.html) too though.
* IE 6: same logo placement as IE 7, and transparent background shows as gray

probably none of these are show-stoppers, but worth mentioning I think.
