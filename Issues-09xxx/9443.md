Other implementations of is_integral_domain allow an argument 'proof' whose default value is False.  Infinite polynomial ring omits this argument in its definition of is_integral_domain:

```
sage: W = PolynomialRing(InfinitePolynomialRing(QQ,'a'),2,'x,y')
sage: W.is_integral_domain()
-------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: is_integral_domain() takes exactly 1 argument (2 given)
```

same goes for is_field:

```
sage: W = PowerSeriesRing(InfinitePolynomialRing(QQ,'a'),'x')
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: is_field() got an unexpected keyword argument 'proof'
```

Thank you for working on Infinite Polynomial Rings! Why didn't you add me (as original author) to Cc? I think I am a natural candidate for being reviewer...

First of all, the patches apply cleanly, and `sage -b` does not complain.

Second, I think the patches provide a clean solution. I am sorry that I didn't use `*args` and `**kwds` in the first place.

Third, it is a formal requirement that the commit message of each patch must point to the relevant ticket. So, could you please add "#9443: " or so to the commit messages? Moreover, the attachments name a wrong ticket number (9943 rather than 9443).

Fourth, I am now running `make ptestlong` and report back whether it has worked.

Fifth, since you fix a bug, I believe the priority is certainly not "trivial". I am promoting it to "major".

All tests pass. 

So, I can give this a positive review - modulo the minor nitpicking about the commit message. This is easy to change.

I hope it is, in this case, correct to mark this ticket as "positive review" but keep the "work issues" field.

Can someone rebase the patch when it's convenient?  It might be sufficient to work from #9114.
