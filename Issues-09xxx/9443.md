Other implementations of is_integral_domain allow an argument 'proof' whose default value is False.  Infinite polynomial ring omits this argument in its definition of is_integral_domain:

```
sage: W = PolynomialRing(InfinitePolynomialRing(QQ,'a'),2,'x,y')
sage: W.is_integral_domain()
-------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: is_integral_domain() takes exactly 1 argument (2 given)
```

same goes for is_field:

```
sage: W = PowerSeriesRing(InfinitePolynomialRing(QQ,'a'),'x')
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: is_field() got an unexpected keyword argument 'proof'
```

Thank you for working on Infinite Polynomial Rings! Why didn't you add me (as original author) to Cc? I think I am a natural candidate for being reviewer...

First of all, the patches apply cleanly, and `sage -b` does not complain.

Second, I think the patches provide a clean solution. I am sorry that I didn't use `*args` and `**kwds` in the first place.

Third, it is a formal requirement that the commit message of each patch must point to the relevant ticket. So, could you please add "#9443: " or so to the commit messages? Moreover, the attachments name a wrong ticket number (9943 rather than 9443).

Fourth, I am now running `make ptestlong` and report back whether it has worked.

Fifth, since you fix a bug, I believe the priority is certainly not "trivial". I am promoting it to "major".

All tests pass. 

So, I can give this a positive review - modulo the minor nitpicking about the commit message. This is easy to change.

I hope it is, in this case, correct to mark this ticket as "positive review" but keep the "work issues" field.
