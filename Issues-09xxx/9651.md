At the moment, adding (and taking negative, substracting,...) for CombinatorialFreeModule is not done in a very efficient way.

This patch

- provides a cythonized version of a pointwise addition of dictionaries, together with multiple options

- uses this addition of dictionaries to provide fast methods for CombinatorialFreeModule

- is (indirectly) based on the patch in Ticket #9648

======================================

prerequisite:
trac_9648_modulemorphism_codomain_extension.2.patch

apply that patch and
trac_9651_CombinatorialFreeModule_Addition-cs.4.patch,
which supercedes the previously posted patches on this page.

Assignee: sage-combinat

Keywords: addition of dictionaries, CombinatorialFreeModule

Resolution: fixed

The patch still needs some doctesting (I have not yet done much, but will do more these days) - in particular, I modified CombinatorialFreeModule._apply_module_morphism and .apply_module_endomorphism. The first method is used in the code for symmetric functions: powersum.py, sfa.py and macdonald.py. Would be nice if someone could check if everything there still works well.

The patch doesn't apply cleanly to sage-4.5.3.rc0. Applying #9648 first doesn't help.

Positive review!

There is a thread about this patch in sage-combinat-devel
resulting in the latest version.

I tested this with sage-4.6.alpha3. After applying

```
trac_9648_modulemorphism_codomain_extension.2.patch 
trac_9651_CombinatorialFreeModule_Addition-cs.4.patch
```
all tests pass. I also confirmed that the test is a speedup.
