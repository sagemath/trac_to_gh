This code was added in #1148. I really think that the lines removed in my patch should be gone. The current (4.4.4) code is:

```
def valuation(m, p):
    if hasattr(m, 'valuation'):
        return m.valuation(p)
    if is_FractionFieldElement(m):  
        return valuation(m.numerator()) - valuation(m.denominator())
    if m == 0:
        import sage.rings.all
        return sage.rings.all.infinity
    r = 0
    power = p
    while not (m % power): # m % power == 0
        r += 1
        power *= p
    return r
```

Putting implementation specific to Fraction fields in a global function is bad practice. And since fraction fields have an implementation of valuation part of the above code will not be execucted. If it magicaly get's excecuted it will return bad results since it doesn't take into account the input variable "p" as it should.

Patches to apply in order:

Two questions:

* Is there any case in which any code after `return infinity` is executed and succesful?
* Is there any case in which any code after `return m.valuation(...)` is executed and useful?

Can't you remove a lot more while you are at it? The code seems to be there to catch off weird unexpected cases that don't have a valuation attribute, but

1. if the case is weird enough, then nothing guarantees that this function terminates
2. if the case happens to have a negative valuation, then the function returns 0 instead of a negative number

While you are at it, I found that the function doesn't handle the valuation attribute of power series well (because it doesn't allow you to specify the (unique) prime p).

```
x = QQ[['x']].gen()
valuation(x^2, x)
TypeError: valuation() takes no arguments (1 given)
valuation(x^2)
TypeError: valuation() takes exactly 2 arguments (1 given)
```
The first error is because `PowerSeries.valuation()` takes no arguments; the second is because the global function takes exactly 2 arguments.

How about defining the global function simply as follows?

```
def valuation(m, *args1, **args2):
    return m.valuation(*args1, **args2)
```
or

```
def valuation(m, *args1, **args2):
    if m == 0:
        return sage.rings.all.infinity
    return m.valuation(*args1, **args2)
```
I haven't tried and/or ran any doctests with this, but anything that is broken by this isn't good coding practice, as you said :) Plus this fixes my example with `valuation(x^2)`.

I guess the code underneath there is for python integers, but I'm not sure. I will look into your questions when I have the time.

ps. similar practices seem to be going on a lot in arith.py I created a discussion on sage-devel. This discussion is not so much to discuss this specific example in detail, but to find a nice general solution for dealing with the problems involved when both using global functions an class methods to do the same thing.

I guess your remark about just passing all the aruments to the class method instead of having a static signature should be of value in that discussion also.

The code is indeed for python integers, and produces the right output in that case as the following shows.

```
sage: a=344r
sage: type(a)
<type 'int'>
sage: hasattr(a,"valuation")
False
sage: valuation(a,2)
3
```

I agree with you that that code should not be excecuted on general ring elements.

It crashes on local elements of the symbolic ring for example.

```
sage: var("z")
z
sage: valuation(z^2,z)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

/Applications/sage/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/rings/arith.pyc in valuation(m, p)
    604     r = 0
    605     power = p
--> 606     while not (m % power): # m % power == 0
    607         r += 1
    608         power *= p

TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for %: 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression' and 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression'
```
.

In your remark 2. The code could also crash, for example try (1/2) % 2.
I tried to find some real examples in sage, but I can't seem to find how to localize rings in sage. Maybe it's not implemented yet. The only thing I could find is: http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/coercion.html#example.

My failing quest to find other examples than python integers lead me to believe that this code should indeed only be excecuted on python integers.

Ok so the code behaves buggy for valuation(1r,1r).  I really think we should just let sage integers handle it. I really don't like having unneccery double code. Especially if one of the two is buggy.

By the way, the problem with valuation(0r,0r) is not just a problem of this code, it also happes with valuation on sage ints. Should we report that as a bug?

```
sage: 0.valuation(0)
+Infinity
sage: 8.valuation(0)
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
...
ValueError: You can only compute the valuation with respect to a integer larger than 1.
```
ps. if you want a number to not be converted to a sage integer by the preparser you should just put an r behind the number. Or else the preparser will generate the following silly code:

```
sage: preparse("valuation(int(1),int(1)")
'valuation(int(Integer(1)),int(Integer(1))'
```
What you want is this:

```
sage: preparse("valuation(1r,1r)")
'valuation(1,1)'
```

You have added the extra arguments but have not documented them, or given any examples where they might be used.  That's not good!

For the main code, why not do

```
try:
  return m.valuation(p)
except AttributeError:
   pass
try:
   return Integer(m).valuation(Integer(p))
except (something):
   raise an error

Wasn't the whole point of the extra arguments *args1, **args2 to make the global function `valuation` also work for power series? It doesn't in the current Sage, and it wouldn't with John's suggestion, but actually, it also doesn't with Maarten's patch.

To make it work, remove p. That is, replace "`p,*args1, **args2`" by "`*args1, **args2`" or simply "`*args1`" both times it occurs in your patch.

In the EXAMPLES block, you could add

```
sage: y = QQ['y'].gen()
sage: valuation(y^3, y)
3
sage: x = QQ[['x']].gen()
sage: valuation(x^2)
2
```

This doesn't really belong to the topic of this patch, but as you are rewriting the function anyway...

I added a second patch which takes most of the comments into account. (please only apply the second patch, it got added as a second patch since I forgot to check the "replace existing file" box).

I didn't do anything with the "For the main code, why not !do:" suggestion since to me it seemed to do the same thing but then with a different coding style. (My version is the "look before you leap version", and yours the "Easier to ask for forgiveness than permission."). If there are reasons to chose one above the other I would certainly do that. I know that my code will raise an attribute error sometimes, an error that you would rewrite in your case. But I guess that error should be not confusing at all to the enduser.

You have to import "Integer" somewhere in the code:

```
sage: a=int(3)
sage: valuation(a,2)
...
--> 695         m=Integer(m)
...
NameError: global name 'Integer' is not defined
```

Add a doctest that uses an 'int' as argument to check that the previous code will work.

In the documentation, it says that valuation os zero is +Infinity but valuation with respect to zero is an error. However:

```
sage: valuation(0,0)
+Infinity
sage: K=QQ['x']
sage: x=K.gen()
sage: valuation(x,K(0))
...
PariError
sage: valuation(K(0),K(0))
+Infinity
```
