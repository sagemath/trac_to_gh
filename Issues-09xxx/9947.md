```
In some cases GiNaC leaves `numeric` objects in the terms of an `add`:

```
sage: a=(sqrt(4*(sqrt(3) - 5)*(sqrt(3) + 5) + 48) + 4*sqrt(3))/ (sqrt(3) + 5)
sage: a.imag()
sin(1/2*arctan2(0, -88* + 1))*sqrt(abs(4*(sqrt(3) - 5)*(sqrt(3) + 5) + 1))
```
See the output of the second argument of `arctan2`.

The term `-88*` is generated by the `expair` `-22*4`. This term should be moved to the overall coefficient.

See also #9913.

Depends on #11317

Looks ok.  Same comment as at #9891.

For instance, one could then allow an spkg maintainer to review the upstream fix.  But that's not exactly what we want.
