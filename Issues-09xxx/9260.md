The documentation from `RealIntervalField` says:

```
       See the documentation for ``RealIntervalField_class`` for many more
       examples.
```
However there is no documentation for `RealIntervalField_class`:

```
sage: RealIntervalField_class?
Object `RealIntervalField_class` not found.
```

Current code is actually

```

    See the documentation for :class:`RealIntervalField_class` for many more
    examples.

```

So this would just have to add a little so that users at the command line could see where to find this; in the documentation it would still look the same and have the right link.
