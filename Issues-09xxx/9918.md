The attached patch implements triangulations of point configurations in arbitrary dimensions in Sage/Cython/C++ without relying on TOPCOM. 

```
sage: points = PointConfiguration([[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[1,1],[-1,-1]]);
sage: points
A point configuration in QQ^2 consisting of 5 points. The 
triangulations of this point configuration are assumed to 
be connected, not necessarily fine, not necessarily regular.
sage: triang = points.triangulate()   # find one triangulation       
sage: triang
(<0,1,2>, <0,1,4>, <0,2,4>, <1,2,3>)
sage: triang[0]
(0, 1, 2)
sage: list( points.triangulations() )
[(<0,1,2>, <0,1,4>, <0,2,4>, <1,2,3>), 
 (<0,1,3>, <0,1,4>, <0,2,3>, <0,2,4>), 
 (<1,2,3>, <1,2,4>), 
 (<1,3,4>, <2,3,4>)]
sage: triang.plot(axes=False)                                        
```
The internal implementation covers finding a single triangulation as well as enumerating all triangulations connected to it by bistellar flips. TOPCOM is required to test for regularity and/or to find non-connected triangulations.

While not quite as fast, my limited testing shows the performance to be in the same order of magnitude as TOPCOM:

```
sage: U=matrix([
...      [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 4,-1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0],
...      [ 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0,-1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
...      [ 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0,-1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1],
...      [ 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0,-2, 1, 0, 0,-1, 1, 1],
...      [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0,-1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
...   ])
sage: pc = PointConfiguration(U.columns())
sage: pc.set_engine('internal')
sage: time len(pc.triangulations_list())
CPU times: user 23.26 s, sys: 0.02 s, total: 23.29 s
Wall time: 23.32 s
9623
sage: pc.set_engine('TOPCOM')
sage: time len(pc.triangulations_list())
CPU times: user 7.80 s, sys: 0.13 s, total: 7.93 s
Wall time: 8.37 s
9623
```

Passes tests, coverage, documentation looks good.  Nice work!  I haven't tested with TOPCOM but I don't think that's necessary since everything works without it.
