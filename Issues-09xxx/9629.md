I don't have pico installed, and hadn't set $EDITOR, so "sage -merge" bombed out; but on Debian-like systems, there's always sensible-editor, which is pretty much what you'd expect. The sage -merge script should look for that before looking for pico.

(Also, uppity free software types would argue that you should look for nano, not pico...)
