Right now the Singular spkg contains the lines:

```
# since parallel make breaks the singular build
MAKE="make"
export MAKE
```

Since Singular takes a long time to build, e.g., > 8 minutes on sage.math, and 16 minutes on my laptop, it would be nice to be able to build it in parallel.

Why precisely does parallel build not work?  Maybe it is only one component of the singular build that has trouble?  Track this down, make the parts that can work to work, and the parts that can't should be explained.

I believe this is fixed. I just ran the following on geom.math using the modified spkg-install attached to this ticket:

```sh
for i in `seq 1 16`; do 
  export MAKE="make -j$i"; 
  time ./spkg-install &> /home/malb/scratch/singular-build-log-$i; 
  tail -n 3 /home/malb/scratch/singular-build-log-$i;
done
```

The output

Attachment [trac_9497-singular-rm.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket9497/trac_9497-singular-rm.patch) by @jhpalmieri created at 2011-03-26 23:51:59

The spkg here needed to be rebased against the current one (which is also called "...p4.spkg").  I've rebased it, and then I made a further change: I changed "$RM" in the spkg-install file to "rm" -- this has been done in the spkg-install files for all of the other spkgs, and also see the discussion at #3537.  I've posted the patch files for the two new spkgs, for review purposes.  The two new spkgs are here:

- [http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/palmieri/SPKG/singular-3-1-1-4.p5.spkg](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/palmieri/SPKG/singular-3-1-1-4.p5.spkg) -- enable parallel build
- [http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/palmieri/SPKG/singular-3-1-1-4.p6.spkg](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/palmieri/SPKG/singular-3-1-1-4.p6.spkg) -- p5 and also change $RM to rm

By the way, I built p5 by applying malb's patch to the current p4.  I tested that successfully on a Mac, on sage.math, on Dave Kirkby's machine hawk (OpenSolaris), and on t2.math.washington.edu (Solaris).  I couldn't access the skynet machines, so I couldn't test on them, but this is a pretty good range of hardware.

John,

I thought the parallel builds of Singular 3-1-1-4 were fixed on #9946 - where I tested a parallel build of Singular  3-1-1-4 for 500 times, with no failures. I'm a bit puzzled why parallel builds need to be enabled in this package, when they should have been done on #9946

The problem with builds that break in parallel is that they are very hard to test properly. Just because something builds a few times, does not mean it will build 100% of the time. Failures tend to be random in nature. Martin Albrecht has tested this 16 times, which I don't think is enough really. It took me more than 16 builds of Sage to find that `boehm_gc-7.1.p6` has a race condition. 

http://www.mail-archive.com/sage-devel`@`googlegroups.com/msg42997.html

BTW, 

if you use my machine hawk, and change your path to use the compilers: 

```
/usr/local/gcc-4.5.0-delayed/bin/gcc
/usr/local/gcc-4.5.0-delayed/bin/g++
/usr/local/gcc-4.5.0-delayed/bin/gfortran
```

then set an environment variable 

```
MAX_COMPILER_DELAY_IN_MICRO_SECONDS
```

to something like 100000, then it will pause a random amount of time (in the range 0 to 100 ms) before invoking the compiler. These random delays will tend to help induce race problems, as it changes the order in which files are built. The file

```
/usr/local/gcc-4.5.0-delayed/bin/gcc
```

is just a shell script, which calls something to pause for a random time before actually compiling the C file. 

```/bin/sh 
/usr/local/bin/randomsleep
/usr/local/gcc-4.5.0/bin/gcc "$@"
drkirkby@hawk:~$ 
```

In fact, I use `/usr/local/gcc-4.5.0-delayed/bin/gcc` all the time, though I rarely have `MAX_COMPILER_DELAY_IN_MICRO_SECONDS` set. 

Perhaps you can clarify what has changed here since #9946 - I'm too tired to look now. It will have to wait until I have had some sleep. 

The changes from p5 to p6 look fine, but I've not investigated what has changed between #9946 and the p5 you have created. 

Dave

Hi Dave,

On both hawk and sage.math, I built the spkg at least 40 times with no problems at all, using a [script written by mpatel](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/8059#comment:112).  I think I'll try with your delayed compilers.

As far as what's changed, there are many instances of "make" in the spkg-install script, which the patch changes to "$MAKE".  There are a few instances which weren't changed, presumably because Martin found problems with building those parts in parallel.  In the tests I tried, the time gains were moderate, not amazing, compiling in roughly 2/3 the time when done in parallel.  But it's still an improvement.

True. It would be nice if there was some way of knowing what tests made use of Singular or any other part of Sage. 

I've not checked this, but I've just started a build with this script.

$ make && ./new.sh

where `new.sh` is:

```/bin/bash

set -o pipefail

export MAX_COMPILER_DELAY_IN_MICRO_SECONDS=5000000
export PATH=/usr/local/gcc-4.5.0-delayed/bin/:$PATH
export CC=/usr/local/gcc-4.5.0-delayed/bin/gcc
export CXX=/usr/local/gcc-4.5.0-delayed/bin/g++

JOBS=12
RUNS=500
for I in `seq $RUNS`;
do

        ./sage -t devel/sage/sage/libs/singular/ >> "$LOG"
        echo $0 run $I of $RUNS: code= $CODE

```

That might well be totally broken - no idea, and are going to bed now, so I'm not going to check it.

OK, I'm giving this positive review now, after the following were all successful.

* 266 tests with a maximum delay before invoking the compilers of 200 ms. **No doctests were performed**, but all builds were OK.
* 55 tests with a maximum delay before invoking the compilers of 500 ms. **No doctests were performed**, but all builds were OK.
* 35 tests with a maximum delay before invoking the compilers of 5 seconds. **No doctests were performed**, but all builds were OK.
* 21 tests with a maximum delay before invoking the compilers of 5 seconds. **This time the doctest `sage/sage/libs/singular/` was run after each build.**  
 

On my machine, the doctests are taking between 17  and 47 seconds (depening on machine load), which is a lot less than the time to build Singular (5 minutes or more). So with hindsight it would have been worth running the tests on each build. But I've run the doctests on 21 builds, and with a total 377 successful builds, I'm reasonably confident this is building in parallel OK. 

Of course Sod's Law says someone will get a failure, but I can't fault it myself. 

Note, the mean delays in invoking the compiler are half the maximum. The source of random numbers for determining the delays is `/dev/urandom`
