I've created a Sage package from an already existing Python package called Brian (see http://www.briansimulator.org/ for more information). The description that is provided in this webpage is the following:

*Brian is a simulator for spiking neural networks available on almost all platforms. The motivation for this project is that a simulator should not only save the time of processors, but also the time of scientists. It is easy to learn and use, highly flexible and easily extensible. The Brian package itself and simulations using it are all written in the Python programming language.*

I'm not sure whether this package should be proposed as experimental or optional. For the moment I've put it as an experimental package. However, I think it could be optional, because as a Python package it has been widely tested and works perfectly, so I don't think there'll be a lot of problems as a Sage package. Please, let me know your opinion on that.

I must say I detected some problems with Brian units related to the Sage classes 'RealNumber' and 'Integer', so I created a patch so that when Brian is imported these two classes are redefined as follows:

```
RealNumber=float
Integer=int
```

This solves the problems. 

I attach the .spkg here (I know it's better just to provide a link, but I don't have anywhere else to upload it to).

Please, let me know what you think!

What platforms does Brian work on out of the box?

And turning of the preparser via:

preparser(false)
```

would also be problematic?

This seems to build fine, the script is ok.   In terms of experimental, positive review - it didn't crash anything, and commands actually do things and give output that is consistent with it.

To release manager - what happens now?  It gets uploaded to the Sage mirrors as experimental package, maybe?  Who does that?

But in the interests of improving it - I don't see why this couldn't be an optional package, if you can find another potential maintainer (different ticket).  If so, you'd definitely want to have a SPKG-TEST file or whatever, since there are builtin tests.  But...

When I do

```
sage: import brian
sage: brian.tests()
```
I get that I'm missing `nose`.    I doubt that `nose` will be a Sage package anytime soon - or should it, if it makes tests that much easier?  Perhaps upstream would consider having a non-`nose` option for testing.

When I try the brian website examples, it tells me that the Sage matplotlib backend doesn't support `show()`.  That would be another thing to figure out.

Ok, done. Please, let me know if it's allright, it's the first time I added files to the repository and I want to be sure I did everything correctly.

I don't really know what to say about that... I don't know `nose` and haven't looked at these tests much. I'll think about it, though. However, is it really necessary to include tests on the packages, in order to be set as optional instead of experimental?

Yes, I had already seen that. The problem is not in Brian but in the matplotlib package itself... there're other ways to see the images, for example replacing the show() command for:

```
sage: savefig('figure.png')
```
which creates the file *figure.png* in the working directory. Maybe that should be specified in the documentation. What do you think?
