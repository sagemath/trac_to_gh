I've created a Sage package from an already existing Python package called Brian (see http://www.briansimulator.org/ for more information). The description that is provided in this webpage is the following:

*Brian is a simulator for spiking neural networks available on almost all platforms. The motivation for this project is that a simulator should not only save the time of processors, but also the time of scientists. It is easy to learn and use, highly flexible and easily extensible. The Brian package itself and simulations using it are all written in the Python programming language.*

I'm not sure whether this package should be proposed as experimental or optional. For the moment I've put it as an experimental package. However, I think it could be optional, because as a Python package it has been widely tested and works perfectly, so I don't think there'll be a lot of problems as a Sage package. Please, let me know your opinion on that.

I must say I detected some problems with Brian units related to the Sage classes 'RealNumber' and 'Integer', so I created a patch so that when Brian is imported these two classes are redefined as follows:

```
RealNumber=float
Integer=int
```

This solves the problems. 

I attach the .spkg here (I know it's better just to provide a link, but I don't have anywhere else to upload it to).

Please, let me know what you think!

What platforms does Brian work on out of the box?

And turning of the preparser via:

preparser(false)
```

would also be problematic?

When I do

```

I get that I'm missing `nose`.    I doubt that `nose` will be a Sage package anytime soon - or should it, if it makes tests that much easier?  Perhaps upstream would consider having a non-`nose` option for testing.

I don't really know what to say about that... I don't know `nose` and haven't looked at these tests much. I'll think about it, though. However, is it really necessary to include tests on the packages, in order to be set as optional instead of experimental?

Yes, I had already seen that. The problem is not in Brian but in the matplotlib package itself... there're other ways to see the images, for example replacing the show() command for:

```
sage: savefig('figure.png')
```
which creates the file *figure.png* in the working directory. Maybe that should be specified in the documentation. What do you think?

I apologize if I've missed it, but is there a link to the updated package?

You can download it clicking [here](http://spkg-upload.googlecode.com/files/brian-1.2.1.p0.spkg), but it's the same link I provided before (there's been no update, I just added the files to the repository).

ok, just to avoid confusions, what I mean by that is that the link is the same because I didn't change the name of the package (from brian-1.2.1.p0 to  brian-1.2.1.p1) because there's been no update. So you'll download the right file with the old link.

Okay, I checked this all out again, and now the HG is fine, and I can't find any garbage files, and it still applies fine to Sage 4.5.3, and I think this is more than ready to be an experimental package. 

If you want, you can find people to test it on a couple other platforms to make sure it's ready for optional package status - I'm not sure exactly what the protocol for that is, though it seems to me that it's more than ready compared to other denizens of http://www.sagemath.org/packages/optional/.  But that could also be another ticket.  At the very least it should get loaded up to the mirrors.  Make it so!
