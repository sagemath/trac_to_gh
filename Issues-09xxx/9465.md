The earlier upgrade is in #9354. See also #6517 for more information.

Source tarball:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/fricas/files/fricas/1.2.4/fricas-1.2.4-full.tar.bz2/download

that has to be renamed into fricas-1.2.4.tar.bz2 (and put in $SAGE_ROOT/upstream) as usual.

fricasaldor might not properly work on 64 bit machines or might not work at all.

Why are you considering 1.0.9? Above you find a link to 1.1.0. and
FriCAS progressed to 1.1.5.

However, in 1.1.5 the aldor-interface is broken. It's already fixed in trunk,
but I tend to wait till 1.1.6 is released in order to produce a new spkg.

Furthermore, quickly browsing over my spkg generation scripts, tells me,
that I will have to fix some small issues.

BTW, is it still required that FriCAS for Sage must use ECL and not SBCL?

I was just pointing out that an upgrade is needed badly.

Was it ever required? I guess it was never assumed that SBCL is installed on the system, so by default
FriCAS can fall back on ECL provided by Sage.
(This would need a trivial adjustment of the spkg-install, I suppose).

On the other hand a fast interface to FriCAS would need an embeddable Lisp, and ECL fits this bill.

I wrote the spkg-install and it at least compile on my computer... If anybody want to test it
- download the source tarball `fricas-1.2.4-full.tar.bz2`, move it to `$SAGE_ROOT/upstream` and rename it `fricas-1.2.4.tar.bz2`
- switch to the git branch provided here
- run `sage -i fricas` and then `make` (from `$SAGE_ROOT`)

I am currently trying to see whether the interface is not broken...

The project is officially on sourceforge and still under SVN. :-( But since I think git is tremendously better, I created a life mirror at github.
See https://sites.google.com/site/hemmecke/fricas-svn#fricas-devel for details.
I'd be happy if FriCAS switched completely to git, but that's not a big issue with mainly only Waldek and me commiting to the code base.

Source code of what?

Aldor: https://github.com/pippijn/aldor
fricas-aldor spkg: ummmm.... I used to have a hg repo somewhere on my sagemath account, but don't know what the computer is that I have to login. I would then try to convert it to git and put it to github.

It would be better to have a link to a stable release with a version number (i.e. "an official tarball"). Otherwise we need to artificially create one.

To create packages the documentation is very well written: http://sagemath.org/doc/developer/packaging.html (I might help for that step). Then there is the second step of having an interface within sage (I have very little experience with that).
