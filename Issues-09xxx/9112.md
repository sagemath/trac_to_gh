Sage-4.4.2, combinat/tableau.py:

Currently, the function SemistandardTableaux(p=None, mu=None) has a default maximum entry of sum(p) if p is a partition and p if p is an integer. I want to add the option to specify a maximum entry.

SemistandardTableaux(mu=[...]) returns all semistandard tableaux when it should return semistandard tableaux with content mu.

Also, the representation of the SST classes should state the maximum entry.

I'm not sure if printing the maximum entry is the best way to do it.  Once CombinatorialClasses are Parents, then that information will be accessible from the parent.

I didn't understand that..wouldn't it be convenient to have the maximum entry printed?
I have a patch for this which I was just about to attach, but does change the repr.

**Attachment:** [combinat-tableau_py.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9112/combinat-tableau_py.patch.gz)

After #8910, you'll be able to do something like

```
sage: S = SemistandardTableaux([3,2,1])
sage: s = S.random_element()
sage: s
[[2, 2, 2], [3, 5], [4]]
sage: s.parent() # after #8910
Semistandard tableaux of shape [3, 2, 1]
```

If you had a different parent such as "Semistandard tableaux of shape [3, 2, 1] with maximum entry 8" then you could get at the 8 from the parent method of the tableaux.

I see this as similar to the following example

```

sage: R = Integers(6)
sage: f = R(1); f
1
sage: f.parent().order()
6
```

Here, the element `f` does not print out that it is 1 mod 6.  It just prints out 1.

Ok, I still don't really see what is wrong with printing the maximum element. In your example, the patch would change it to:

```
sage: S = SemistandardTableaux([3,2,1])
sage: s = S.random_element()
sage: s
[[2, 2, 2], [3, 5], [4]]
sage: s.parent() # after #8910
Semistandard tableaux of shape [3, 2, 1] and maximum entry 6 # after #9112
```

But you think there should be a method which returns the maximum entry? Like:

```
sage: S = SemistandardTableaux([3,2,1])
sage: s = S.random_element()
sage: s
[[2, 2, 2], [3, 5], [4]]
sage: s.parent() # after #8910
Semistandard tableaux of shape [3, 2, 1]
sage: s.parent().max_entry()
6
```

I'm sorry -- I was confused. I thought you were suggesting printing the maximum entry with each individual tableau rather than with the parent class.  So, ignore my comments regarding that :-)

Regarding the patch, a couple of questions:

1.  Why is corners() being changed?  It seems unrelated to the ticket.

2.  4 spaces should always be used as the indentation.

3.  Any comparisons with None should be used using `is` instead of `==`.  For example, `if mu is None` or `if max_entry is not None`.  Also, tests like `not i == 1` should be `i != 1`.

4.  Instead of having -1 represent a max_entry of infinity, I think we should just use Sage's object for infinity instead.  

```
sage: type(oo)
<class 'sage.rings.infinity.PlusInfinity'>
sage: SST = SemistandardTableaux(3, max_entry=oo); SST 
Semistandard tableaux of size 3 and no maximum entry 
```

5. `raise TypeError, "mu must be of size p (= %s)"%p ` might be better as a `ValueError`.

Other than that, I'm pretty happy with the changes.

You need certain privileges to remove files.  If you just post the new one, I can delete any ones that need to be deleted.

Hello,
"trac_9112_tableau_py.patch" adds the functionality mentioned in the ticket.
There was talk of adding more features such as an option to input an alphabet...
I guess I was waiting to see what happened with that but its been a while now so I think I'll go ahead and mark this ticket as needing a review.
We can always add a new ticket later.

I've uploaded a reviewer patch which fixes some failing doctests, changes `__repr__` to `_repr_` throughout the file, improves some docstrings, and improves the efficiency of `__contains__` for semistandard tableaux.  There is a lot more that can be done with this file, but these patches make sage better and there is no reason for them not to go in right away.

**Attachment:** [trac_9112_reviewer.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9112/trac_9112_reviewer.patch.gz)

This looks good for the most part.  I've uploaded a reviewer patch which fixes some failing doctests, changes `__repr__` to `_repr_` throughout the file, improves some docstrings, and improves the efficiency of `__contains__` for semistandard tableaux.  There is a lot more that can be done with this file, but these patches make sage better and there is no reason for them not to go in right away.  I'll open another ticket for general cleanup of tableau.py.

So, in short, I give a positive review to the patch [https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9112/trac_9112_tableau_py.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9112/trac_9112_tableau_py.patch.gz) , provided my reviewer patch is applied on top of it.  So now someone (possibly the original author) needs to approve the reviewer patch, and the ticket can be marked as positive review.

The reviewer patch looks good. I've uploaded some extra very small changes:

Previously, if you called `SemistandardTableaux(max_entry=0)`, `_repr_` would print "Semistandard Tableaux".

Also, if you called `SemistandardTableaux(max_entry=oo)`, `_repr_` would print "Semistandard Tableaux with maximum entry +Infinity" when it should just be "Semistandard Tableaux".

I've allowed for the user to give `PlusInfinity` as well as anything that has type `PlusInfinity`
as an infinite max_entry.

So with trac_9112_rereviewed.patch on top of the two others I'm happy. Let me know if you're happy!

Eric

Just curious, do you know of anything that has type `PlusInfinity` other than `PlusInfinity`?  This check looks redundant to me...
