I have implemented methods is_ordinary() and is_supersingular() for elliptic curves over finite fields, together with functions supersingular_j_polynomial(p) returning a polynomial over GF(p) whose roots are the supersingular j-invariants in characteristic p, a dict storing the precomputed output of this for p<300, and a function is_j_supersingular(j) testing whether a finite field element j is a supersingular j-invariant.

A patch will be ready shortly.

I have run the tests on it. They all passed (apart from an unrelated problem) so I am willing to give a positive review.

I had a look at the code and I am confident that it computes what it claims, although I have not checked every little detail (such as the list of polynomials).

The patch `trac_9087-supersingular.patch` uses tabs for indentation, which is against sage coding conventions. I have uploaded a version with spaces instead of tabs.
