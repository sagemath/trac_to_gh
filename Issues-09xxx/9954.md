<div id="comment:0"></div>

For a polytope whose dimension is less than its ambient dimension, the f_vector outputs an extra top-dimensional cell. For example, a triangle in 3-space:

INPUT

```
Polyhedron(vertices=[[0,0,0],[1,0,0],[0,1,0]]).f_vector()
```

OUTPUT

```
[1, 3, 3, 1, 1]
```

Expected Output

```
[1, 3, 3, 1]
```

Note, this was reported by the "report a problem" form.

Shouldn't lines be added to all faces including the "empty one"? I am thinking here by analogy with equations that are "saturated" for all faces including the "full face". I agree that it is a bit weird, but I think this is correct from the point of view of dual representations.

I guess I then also want this "empty face" to have the dimension less by one then the dimension of the linear space generated by lines, by analogy to vertex - dimension 0, empty set - dimension -1. This is really weird, perhaps because in both cases "empty face" should have dimension -infinity?.. But it seems to me that "perfect duality" justifies a strange choice of dimension for a strange/empty face - if one works with such a face, he better know what he is doing. In which case, e.g. -1 is a great choice for the dimension of the empty face of a supporting polytope of a cone.

In the documentation the sentence "In the case of a full-dimensional polytope, the faces are pairs (vertices, inequalities) ..." needs some rewording - it is a bit misleading since faces are now represented by a special class (which is great, by the way!).

I didn't finish reading the patch yet, but hope to do so tomorrow.

1. It seems that you wanted to cache the face lattice but forgot - the output of `hasse_diagram_from_incidences` is directly returned.
   1. Perhaps we should rename the method to `Hasse...`?
   2. `PolyhedronFace` constructor does not describe input.
   3. I think it would be nice to be able to treat polyhedron faces as polyhedrons themselves, in the way how it is done for cones. This is feasible only if creating new polyhedra is very fast, which is not the case now, but maybe it is something to think about in the future.

Do you know what is the standard treatment in such situations?
   4. I think that new argument `faces_at_infinity` should be gone - it seems obscure to me and it is unnecessary. Currently you have replaced my line 

 ```
 head.extend(faces[frozenset([atom]), coatoms] 
     for atom, coatoms in enumerate(atom_to_coatoms))
```
 with

 ```
 for atom, coatoms in enumerate(atom_to_coatoms): 
     try: 
         head.append(faces[frozenset([atom]), coatoms]) 
     except KeyError, msg: 
         if not faces_at_infinity: 
  	    raise KeyError, msg 
```
 but you can get the same result with

 ```
 head.extend(faces[frozenset([atom]), coatoms] 
     for atom, coatoms in enumerate(atom_to_coatoms)
     if atoms_require_one_of is None or atom in atoms_require_one_of)
```
1. How about renaming `atoms_require_one_of` to `required_atoms`? I agree that your variant is more descriptive, but it sounds a bit weird as a parameter name.

I thought about adding lines to the "empty face", but I decided against it. There are certainly arguments for both. But in the end I decided against it because only lines would not be representable by a polyhedron. I don't have any reference, though. 

When I refactor the `Pohlyhedron` class for ppl then I'll try to make `PolyhedronFace` derive from it. But right now its not feasible.

I'll include your other suggestions and will post a patch in a couple of days.
