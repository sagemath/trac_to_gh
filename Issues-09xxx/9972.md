The patch is in principle ready, but while we are at it - do we want to make custom `_repr_` for such morphisms? If yes, how should they be different from the standard?

Also, the speed is far from spectacular, but it is not easy to make it better until simple polyhedra work faster - currently most time is spend on constructing them for intersection purposes and I tried hard not to intersect more cones than necessary.

I don't have any good suggestion for how to improve `_repr_`, we can always leave that for later. 

I'll rewrite the Polyhedron constructor in cython one of these days, that should fix the speed issues. Though its a good idea to minimize the number of intersections computed :)

The current version looks good for an initial shot at toric morphisms. Are you still changing things around or should I officially review it?

I like the functionality, but I'm confused about the name. Is this supposed to be a `ToricLatticeMorphism` or a `FanMorphism`? I am thinking that it would be good to split those apart, and perhaps make the latter inherit from the former. 

`ToricLatticeMorphism.make_compatible_with(fan)` doesn't make the morphism compatible with the fan, it is the other way round. So it should be either `fan.make_compatible_with(toric_morphism)` or, say,  `ToricLatticeMorphism.subdivide_domain(domain_fan,codomain_fan)`. Or see below.

Another functionality that I would like to have is to figure out the image fan from the lattice morphism and the domain. How about the following proposal:

1. separate `ToricLatticeMorphism` and `FanMorphism`.

2. `FanMorphism(lattice_hom, domain=Fan, codomain=Fan)` constructs the fan morphism. If `lattice_hom` is a matrix the corresponding `ToricLatticeMorphism` is constructed automatically. Raises `ValueError` if the fans are not compatible.

3. `FanMorphism(lattice_hom, domain=Fan)` constructs the image fan and uses it as codomain. Raise `ValueError` if not possible.

4. `FanMorphism(lattice_hom, domain=Fan, codomain=Fan, subdivide=True)` will subdivide the domain fan as necessary. 

Let me know what you think & I'd be happy to help, of course!

In particular, I didn't see how `FanMorphism` can fit nicely into Sage and I didn't even understand what it is mathematically. A fan is a collection of cones with certain restrictions, right? Then a fan morphism should be a map between sets of cones, in our case finite. But that's not what we want, we rather want a morphism between supports of fans, which is given on points of the space by a linear map. Put it another way, we want a `ToricLatticeMorphism` restricted to the support of the domain. During construction of such a morphism we have to check that everything is compatible, which can be quite expensive. During any application of this morphism to a point, we should check that this point is in the domain and this is also non-trivial (the only thing that will work for general fans is checking this point against every generating cone). So if we do have a special class for `FanMorphism`, how about this definition: \"it is a morphism between toric lattices with distinguished fans in the domain and codomain which are compatible with this morphism.\" I.e. the domain is still a whole toric lattice and there is no need for complicated checks.

I am now putting finishing touches on plotting, but then return back to morphisms.

After actually working on morphisms a bit, I had second thoughts about class organization. In particular, I didn't see how `FanMorphism` can fit nicely into Sage and I didn't even understand what it is mathematically. A fan is a collection of cones with certain restrictions, right? Then a fan morphism should be a map between sets of cones, in our case finite. But that's not what we want, we rather want a morphism between supports of fans, which is given on points of the space by a linear map. Put it another way, we want a `ToricLatticeMorphism` restricted to the support of the domain. During construction of such a morphism we have to check that everything is compatible, which can be quite expensive. During any application of this morphism to a point, we should check that this point is in the domain and this is also non-trivial (the only thing that will work for general fans is checking this point against every generating cone). So if we do have a special class for `FanMorphism`, how about this definition: "it is a morphism between toric lattices with distinguished fans in the domain and codomain which are compatible with this morphism." I.e. the domain is still a whole toric lattice and there is no need for complicated checks. One can write then

```
sage: phi = FanMorphism(lattice_morphism, F1, F2)
sage: phi.image_cone(cone_of_F1)
<some cone of F2>
sage: phi.preimage_cones(cone_of_F2)
<a tuple of cones of F1>
```

Going further, I don't think anymore that we should derive special fans for domain/codomain of morphisms between toric varieties themselves, let's call this class `ToricMorphism`. The problem I have is that a single variety can be a (co)domain of different morphisms. (I definitely need such functionality.) This can make it very inconvenient to work with divisors and classes because they will get confused which parent do they belong to, we will have to work with coercion, and the code may need to look something like this:

```
sage: fan = ...
sage: X = ToricVariety(fan)
sage: fan = X.fan() # This is already a bit strange...
sage: phi = ToricMorphism(matrix(...), X, Y)
sage: psi = ToricMorphism(matrix(...), Z, X)
sage: X_fan_codomain = psi.codomain().fan() # These two lines are plain confusing
sage: X_fan_domain = phi.domain().fan()
sage: phi.domain().rational_divisor_group() == psi.codomain().rational_divisor_group()
???
```
All four fans above are mathematically the same, the only difference is what kind of extra functionality do they get. But they will be different Python objects and associated toric varieties will be also different objects for no apparent reason, i.e. how these reasons can be explained to a user rather than a developer?

So I think that either morphisms derive their own fans for domain/codomain and use them internally without actually changing the varieties they were created for (i.e. `phi.domain().fan()` is the same as `X.fan()`, but `phi.domain_fan()` can be something specialized), or they store this information in some other way and return (pre)images taking cones of usual fans as arguments.

I recall that we already had a similar argument in the beginning, whether or not we need any kind of specialized cones, which provide clean access to new features. I just checked how many new features got added:
* TWO methods for `Cone_of_fan`: `star_generators` and `star_generator_indices`. (There were actually many new methods here originally, but others migrated to plain cones.) Still, I think that this class is justified, because these are very natural operations to perform on cones that belong to a fan. Also, a cone cannot quite belong to several fans in the sense that its internal data structures are severely tied to a fan and it is very important performance-wise. (E.g. intersection of cones of the same fan is incomparably easier/faster than for arbitrary ones, and this will remain true even when polyhedra are made fast.)
* ONE method for `Cone_of_toric_variety`: `cohomology_class`. Here I feel less convinced that it is necessary, `cone.cohomology_class()` does not feel more natural to me than `X.cohomology_class(cone)`. However, I think there are more methods added here by patches which are not applied in my queue and something else may come up during later development. If not, we should probably reconsider this class, because it would be nice to have 

 ```
 sage: ToricVariety(fan).fan() is fan
 True
```
* Hypothetical cones of (co)domain would each add one more method, but make it difficult/inconvenient to deal with multiple morphisms, while the whole point of making new classes should be making life easier...

For this ticket I propose the following:

1. Rename `make_compatible_with` to `subdivide_domain`.
2. Add to `ToricLatticeMorphism` a method like `image_fan(domain_fan)` to construct the "natural" fan in the codomain, as you have suggested.
3. Add `FanMorphism(ToricLatticeMorphism)` which mathematically is what I have said above, will live in the same Hom-space as lattice morphisms, and will behave in the same way (including `domain` and `codomain` returning toric lattices), except that it also has `domain_fan` and `codomain_fan` methods returning fans which are guaranteed to be compatible with the morphism. It also has `image_cone` and `preimage_cones`, results are cached (perhaps it is more efficient to compute them at once for all cones or even do it during compatibility check).
4. Cones of fans also get `image_cone` and `preimage_cones` methods that take as an argument a `FanMorphism` with appropriate fans.

A follow-up ticket will add `ToricMorphism` for arbitrary scheme morphisms between toric varieties and `ToricEquivariantMorphism` for those coming from `FanMorphisms`.

Let me know what you think!

    "body": "<a id='comment:6'></a>\nReplying to [novoselt](#comment%3A5):\n> \"it is a morphism between toric lattices with distinguished fans in the domain and codomain which are compatible with this morphism.\"\n\n\nYes, that is the usual definition. No restriction on the support of the underlying lattice map. \n\nOn an unrelated note, I would call \"point\" = \"0-dimensional torus orbit\" = full-dimensional cone. A toric morphism maps points to potentially higher-dimensional torus orbits. Though I do understand that you meant lattice points.\n\nI understand your issue about having multiple morphisms. But if the fans don't know about the toric morphism then they shouldn't know about the toric variety either, otherwise its confusing. So in principle I don't mind getting rid of the `Cone_of_toric_variety` class. At least this solves the dilemma `cone_of_variety.cohomology_class()` vs. `variety.cohomology_class(cone)`; since the cone doesn't know about the variety only the latter can work. But instead of adding a `cohomology_class` method, I'd rather have the `CohomologyRing` element constructor accept cones:\n\n```\n  sage: HH = X.cohomology_ring()\n  sage: HH( X.fan(2)[23] )\n```\nThis pattern works already for the divisor group and Chow group:\n\n```\nsage: Div = X.divisor_group()\nsage: Div( X.fan(1)[0] )   #  output should have been V(z0)?!?\nV(1-d cone of Rational polyhedral fan in 2-d lattice N)\nsage: A = X.Chow_group()\nsage: A( X.fan(1)[0] )\nThe Chow cycle (1, 0, 0)\n```\n\n> For this ticket I propose the following:\n> 1. Rename `make_compatible_with` to `subdivide_domain`.\n> 2. Add to `ToricLatticeMorphism` a method like `image_fan(domain_fan)` to construct the \"natural\" fan in the codomain, as you have suggested.\n\n\nIf we can agree on a hierarchy `ToricLatticeMorphism` -> `FanMorphism` -> `ToricMorphism` then  `ToricLatticeMorphism` shouldn't know about fans at all, if only to avoid circular imports. Similar to how `ToricLattice` doesn't know about `Fan`. So `make_compatible_with` and `image_fan` become special cases of the `FanMorphism` constructor. \n\nAnd instead of an `is_compatible_with` method, why not have `FanMorphism(matrix,fan1,fan2)` raise `ValueError, \"Cone <3,4,5> is not contained in any image cone\"`.\n\n>  3.

Replying to [novoselt](#comment%3A5):
> "it is a morphism between toric lattices with distinguished fans in the domain and codomain which are compatible with this morphism."


Yes, that is the usual definition. No restriction on the support of the underlying lattice map. 

On an unrelated note, I would call "point" = "0-dimensional torus orbit" = full-dimensional cone. A toric morphism maps points to potentially higher-dimensional torus orbits. Though I do understand that you meant lattice points.

I understand your issue about having multiple morphisms. But if the fans don't know about the toric morphism then they shouldn't know about the toric variety either, otherwise its confusing. So in principle I don't mind getting rid of the `Cone_of_toric_variety` class. At least this solves the dilemma `cone_of_variety.cohomology_class()` vs. `variety.cohomology_class(cone)`; since the cone doesn't know about the variety only the latter can work. But instead of adding a `cohomology_class` method, I'd rather have the `CohomologyRing` element constructor accept cones:

```
  sage: HH = X.cohomology_ring()
  sage: HH( X.fan(2)[23] )
```
This pattern works already for the divisor group and Chow group:

```
sage: Div = X.divisor_group()
sage: Div( X.fan(1)[0] )   #  output should have been V(z0)?!?
V(1-d cone of Rational polyhedral fan in 2-d lattice N)
sage: A = X.Chow_group()
sage: A( X.fan(1)[0] )
The Chow cycle (1, 0, 0)
```

> For this ticket I propose the following:
> 1. Rename `make_compatible_with` to `subdivide_domain`.
> 2. Add to `ToricLatticeMorphism` a method like `image_fan(domain_fan)` to construct the "natural" fan in the codomain, as you have suggested.


If we can agree on a hierarchy `ToricLatticeMorphism` -> `FanMorphism` -> `ToricMorphism` then  `ToricLatticeMorphism` shouldn't know about fans at all, if only to avoid circular imports. Similar to how `ToricLattice` doesn't know about `Fan`. So `make_compatible_with` and `image_fan` become special cases of the `FanMorphism` constructor. 

And instead of an `is_compatible_with` method, why not have `FanMorphism(matrix,fan1,fan2)` raise `ValueError, "Cone <3,4,5> is not contained in any image cone"`.

>  3. Add `FanMorphism(ToricLatticeMorphism)` which mathematically is what I have said above, will live in the same Hom-space as lattice morphisms, and will behave in the same way (including `domain` and `codomain` returning toric lattices), except that it also has `domain_fan` and `codomain_fan` methods returning fans which are guaranteed to be compatible with the morphism. It also has `image_cone` and `preimage_cones`, results are cached (perhaps it is more efficient to compute them at once for all cones or even do it during compatibility check).


Yes, sounds good!

>  4. Cones of fans also get `image_cone` and `preimage_cones` methods that take as an argument a `FanMorphism` with appropriate fans.


I'd rather have only `morphism(cone)` (or `morphism.image(cone)`) and `morphism.preimages(cone)`.

> A follow-up ticket will add `ToricMorphism` for arbitrary scheme morphisms between toric varieties and `ToricEquivariantMorphism` for those coming from `FanMorphisms`.


I agree, but can we use, say, `AlgebraicMorphism` and `ToricMorphism`? Toric should really always be replaceable with "torus-equivariant".

What membership exactly do you want to test?

The assumption is that there are no invalid cones of the fan, so if you want 
to check if a cone is in the fan, it is enough to check if the ambient fan of the cone is the fan in question. For checking equivalence of two cones of the same fan it is enough indeed to check that their ambient ray indices are the same, as tuples, since they are always assumed to be sorted and when they are not - it is a bug.

I don't mind adding uniqueness of cones of fan or even cones themselves for that matter (on a separate ticket, perhaps?), I just don't quite understand why do you want it. The advantages that I see are
* memory saving;
* cached data sharing;
and disadvantages
* more complicated code for construction;
* longer time for construction.
Do you have something else in mind?

Some more thoughts:
1. When there is an attempt to check if a point is in the fan, should we try to interpret this point as a ray, i.e. 1-d cone?
2. The last line of `_contains` should be replaced with the original version:

 ```
 try: 
     return data.is_equivalent(self.cone_containing(data.rays())) 
 except ValueError:  # No cone containing all these rays 
     return False 
```
 For example, if you take a fan which is a subdivision of a cone, then this cone will trickle  down to this block, but `cone_containing` will raise an exception. There probably should be a test for such a situation (although I certainly don't claim that all other places test all possible exceptions...)
3. `Fan.contains` should no longer accept many arguments after your change - let's replace `*arg` with `cone`.
4. Typo: "or a something" should be without "a".
5. Typo: "class associated to cones" should be "classes".

Otherwise looks great: the new approach allows users to create their own shortcuts and write `HH(cone)` instead of `cone.cohomology_class()`. While I like names exposed in Sage to be descriptive, I certainly don't want to force users do it in their code ;-)

I will base other patches of the ticket on top of this one.

In what sense `ambient_ray_indices` is dangerous? If ambient structures of two cones are different, there is no point to look at these attributes at all. Otherwise they are the same if and only if cones are the same.

I am definitely against moving `ambient_ray_indices` to `Cone_of_fan` because the point in having it is uniform treatment of faces of cones and cones of fans, which are pretty much the same things. In fact, even `star_generators` make sense for faces of a cone in the sense of containing facets, it just should not be called that name. So currently the main reason for a `Cone_of_fan` to exist is that terminology for faces of cones and cones of fans is a bit different.

Thats of course true, but we got that wrong in the `ToricDivisor` constructor (no check that the ambient was the same) and you didn't catch it ;-)

I'm just trying to explore options that make it impossible to make this mistake in the future. One more idea would be to force the user to pass the ambient to `ambient_ray_indices()`,

```
sage: fan1 = ...
sage: fan2 = ...
sage: fan1.generating_cone(2).ambient_ray_indices(fan1)   # fast
sage: fan1.generating_cone(2).ambient_ray_indices(fan2)   # slower
```
This would also get rid of the need for `get_cone()`

The point of the `get_cone` method is to avoid this extra branch whenever the user passes a cone that is not necessarilly within the same ambient:

```
    if is_Cone(c):
        if c.ambient()==fan
            indices = c.ambient_ray_indices()
        else:
            try:
                indices = tuple(sorted([ fan.rays().index(r) for r in c.rays() ]))
            except ValueError:
                ...
```
and instead just write 

```
    if is_Cone(c):
        indices = fan.get_cone(c).ambient_ray_indices()
```

I agree with 3.

It is not quite Python style to try to eliminate any possibility of user mistakes by making sure that everything is called properly in proper places. The assumption is that users know what they are doing ;-) These methods assume that your cone is in some fixed fan:
* `adjacent`
* `ambient_ray_indices`
* `face_lattice` (indirectly - since elements will be cones of the same fan)
* `faces` (indirectly)
* `facet_of`
* `facets` (indirectly)
* `star_generator_indices`
* `star_generators`
All of these methods are pretty important and convenient, in particular, in many cases `ambient_ray_indices` is more useful than `rays` or `ray_matrix` since it allows you to see clearly how different cones are related to each other. It would be quite annoying if for using all these methods it was necessary to mention fan explicitly.

Yes, there are bugs that appear because users make wrong assumptions, but I don't think that it is a valid reason to require users to always explicitly state all of their assumptions so that each function can check that they are correct and when possible fix them.

In addition, as you pointed out in a sample code above, passing ambient explicitly will mean that it always works correctly, but sometimes fast and sometimes slow. This sometimes slow can be sometimes significantly slow and the reason for keeping track of these ray indices and ambients is precisely code optimization, otherwise all cones could store only their rays and all fans - only their cones.

So I still think that if you have a cone and it is important that things about this cone are computed relevant to a certain fan, you are responsible for making sure that this cone "sits" in this fan and if not - trying to convert it there. I see a point in making this conversion easy, but not in making it mandatory every time you need it. Compare this

```
sage: indices = fan.ray_indices(cone)
sage: supercones = fan.cones_with_facet(cone)
```
and this

```
sage: indices = fan(cone).ambient_ray_incides()
sage: supercones = fan(cone).facet_of()
```
I think in the second case it is quite clear that

```
sage: cone = fan(cone)
sage: indices = cone.ambient_ray_incides()
sage: supercones = cone.facet_of()
```
is likely to be faster, plus it is a bit easier to read and there is only one place where an exception can occur due to `cone` being incompatible with `fan` at all.

I also think that using cones from a wrong fan is likely to be exposed very quickly in actual work due to index-out-of range exceptions, so given several month of working with current interface, I really don't want it to change...

Also, *why* did you get this mistake? Because you took a code from a place where the ambient definitely was set correctly and moved it to the place where potentially other cones maybe passed in.

After some more contemplating and checking

```
$ grep "ambient_ray_indices()" sage/geometry/* |wc
     30     179    2579
$ grep "ambient_ray_indices()" sage/schemes/generic/* |wc
     13      85    1383
```
on Sage-4.6.alpha3, I think that you may be a bit overestimating the danger. We have used this function in 43 places and so far everything is working quite well. The "mistake" you ran into got quickly caught even before the ticket got ready for a review. Also, *why* did you get this mistake? Because you took a code from a place where the ambient definitely was set correctly and moved it to the place where potentially other cones maybe passed in. Finally, *you* actually have not done any mistake, you just left a possibility for a user to make one by passing a wrong cone. (In this case, I think, the mistake would be realized quite fast even if the code did not throw up an exception.)

Adding a warning for calling `ambient_ray_indices` on the ambient itself may not work because it may be called internally in some cycles. (I didn't check but it is quite likely.) Besides, nothing is wrong with such a call. I also strongly believe that this method must be open/documented/public, because if we have used it in 43 places, it is quite important for development and therefore users who build their own structures on top of stuff shipped in Sage are likely to find it convenient in their code. I personally use it all the time when working with varieties and sometimes even regret that these indices are not the default output for cones, so when I have a list of them I need to write a cycle calling this method.

A few months ago I already suggested switching to notation like `fan.ray_indices(cone)` etc. but you opposed and pointed out that it is not in the spirit of OOP. Now I actually completely agree and think that it is very fortunate that we have not done so then. I even still see some benefits of having special classes for cones of toric varieties and morphisms (in particular, this problem would not occur ;-)) but for these cases the disadvantages overweight.

Have I convinced you yet or should I abandon any hope?-)

I meant that mistake would be realized quite fast once the code was actually used. I didn't actually use code for toric divisors yet, especially with cones from another fan. But anyway - this is all hypothetical and I may be very wrong.

My main point is not that it is difficult to replace 13 uses of `ambient_ray_indices`, but that it is a very convenient and natural function which I personally use both when developing new code and when actually using Sage interactively. I would rather not pass any arguments to it, because it is annoying for interaction and in functions it may lead to code like

```
cone.ambient_ray_indices(cone.ambient())
```
or

```
cone.ambient().ray_indices(cone)
```
which is plain confusing.

The name of the function clearly indicates that there is something ambient and cone must be aware of it, since no arguments were passed. Therefore, when using this function, the user should be sure that this something ambient is what it is supposed to be. In fact, it may be more clear for new outside users than for us, since we are used to writing code inside the class where in many cases this requirement is definitely satisfied. (How can `self` have a wrong `self.ambient()`???) And after all this discussion I will probably remember very well for a long time to make an extra check that this function is used after making sure that ambient is what it is assumed to be.

If you want to add extra functionality like `fan.ray_indices(cone)` which will be safer to use and then use this one when you want - I am fine with it. But if you insist on getting rid of `cone.ambient_ray_indices()` in its present form/namespace, we need to invite more people from sage-devel for opinions...

In an effort to be less stubborn, here is what I think I should do if we cannot live with the existing interface:

1. Keep internal fields `_ambient` and `_ambient_ray_indices` which can be related either to a cone or a fan (from the coding point of view these situations are similar and it is very convenient to treat them together - I know for sure since my initial version didn't do it).
2. Remove `ambient()` and `ambient_ray_indices()` methods. In the code we still can use attributes since they always must be set in the constructor. Also remove `adjacent` and `facet_of` methods from cones and `star_generator_indices` and `star_generators` from cones of fan. The class `Cone_of_fan` becomes completely unnecessary and should be discarded.
3. Add methods corresponding to the above ones with respect to an explicit ambient (of course, there is no analog for `ambient` itself anymore):

 ```
 sage: ambient_cone.ray_indices(cone)
 sage: ambient_cone.adjacent_faces(cone)
 sage: ambient_cone.faces_with_facet(cone)
 sage: fan.ray_indices(cone)
 sage: fan.adjacent_cones(cone)
 sage: fan.cones_with_facet(cone)
 sage: fan.star_generators(cone)
 sage: fan.star_generator_indices(cone)
```
 Cones still will cache all this stuff for their own `_ambient` in a hope that it will be useful later and that's how usually they will be called.

But I still need some voting before performing such a change.

I still think that it is convenient to have a default for "the thing before dot" above. This opinion is based on actually working with such structures, so maybe I have bad habits, but that's what I prefer. I also still think that it is natural in mathematics. E.g.

`fan(cone)` is similar to `Fan([cone])` only if your fan is called `fan` ;-) I was thinking of such format to mimic Element-Parent behaviour in Sage, but:
* currently we don't use this model for cones and fans;
* if we did, then cones must be both elements (of fans) and parents (of points), and this is not yet supported in Sage;
* I don't clearly see advantages of such a switch;
* I would like to have the same interface for "putting" cones into fans and faces into cones.
So the attached patch implements for cones and fans methods `embed(cone)`. `cone_equivalent_to` seems unclear to me despite of being long, but I am not sure if `embed` is much better - what do you think of it? Maybe `embed_cone/embed_face` would be more clear?

P.S. I also optimized `is_equivalent` for cones of the same ambient, as was suggested in http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/9972#comment:20.

I couldn't figure out whether your patch goes before or after mine, so I folded it into one and fixed everything.

I changed 

```
        # Optimization for fans generated by a single cone
        if len(cones) == 1:
            cone = cones[0]
            return RationalPolyhedralFan((tuple(range(cone.nrays())), ),
                                         cone.rays(), lattice,
                                         is_complete=lattice.dimension() > 0)
```
to `is_complete=(lattice.dimension()==0)`.

Now that we agree on this ;-) can you go ahead and remove the `Enhanced*` versions of fans and cones? Then we can go on with fan morphisms...

I have updated the main patch by adding a special branch for the image of the trivial cone and inserted your example into `preimage_cones` docstring.

Why is `preimage_cones` not the preimage of `image_cones`? This confuses me:

```
sage: cone =  f.image_cone( Cone([(1,0),(0,1)]) )
sage: [ cone is f.image_cone(c) for c in f.preimage_cones(cone) ]
[True, True, True, False, False, False]
```
I understand that it is working as documented, but it seems like it would be more useful to actually return the preimage cones. In other words, take preimage cones in the sense of fan morphisms and not in the sense of convex sets.

If one is interested in all cones mapping geometrically into a given cone one could always construct the `Fan` of the (fan morphism) preimage cones.

{
    "body": "<a id='comment:54'></a>\nI am actually not quite sure I completely understand your comments, which makes me think that method names and definitions require some adjustments. How about the following:\n* `cones_mapped_into(cone)` returning all cones of the domain fan mapped into the given `cone` of the codomain fan (this is what `preimage_cones` does now). They do form a fan, but I am not sure that it is a good idea to construct it, since we will loose connection to the domain fan then.\n* `cones_mapped_onto(cone)` returning all cones of the domain fan whose `image_cone` is equal to the given `cone` of the codomain fan. Is this what you are talking about?\nIn both cases we may add extra parameter to allow returning only maximal cones with these properties. Or we can add a function to `fan` module like `maximal_cones(cones)` that will select the maximal ones. In the case of cones of the same fan the selection process is not terribly expensive.\n\nAs for `preimage_cones`, I would say that `preimage_cone` would make perfect sense if it was just the set-theoretic preimage of a given cone, which in general is not strictly-convex and is likely to be not a part of the domain fan.

I am actually not quite sure I completely understand your comments, which makes me think that method names and definitions require some adjustments. How about the following:
* `cones_mapped_into(cone)` returning all cones of the domain fan mapped into the given `cone` of the codomain fan (this is what `preimage_cones` does now). They do form a fan, but I am not sure that it is a good idea to construct it, since we will loose connection to the domain fan then.
* `cones_mapped_onto(cone)` returning all cones of the domain fan whose `image_cone` is equal to the given `cone` of the codomain fan. Is this what you are talking about?
In both cases we may add extra parameter to allow returning only maximal cones with these properties. Or we can add a function to `fan` module like `maximal_cones(cones)` that will select the maximal ones. In the case of cones of the same fan the selection process is not terribly expensive.

As for `preimage_cones`, I would say that `preimage_cone` would make perfect sense if it was just the set-theoretic preimage of a given cone, which in general is not strictly-convex and is likely to be not a part of the domain fan. I actually compute these cones internally for generating cones of the codomain fan, but I am not sure they have much value to the end user.

Thoughts?

I think the geometric image/preimage of a cone is not particularly useful for toric morphisms. A fan morphism maps cones to cones, but does *not* define linear maps of the individual cones. One should think of it as a map from the poset of domain cones to the poset of codomain cones. Or, in geometric terms, maps of the poset of torus orbits to the poset of torus orbits. 

The usual blow-up example 

```
sage: c1 = Cone([(1,0),(1,1)])
sage: c2 = Cone([(1,1),(0,1)])
sage: domain_fan = Fan([c1, c2])
sage: codomain_fan = Fan([Cone([(1,0),(0,1)])])
sage: f = FanMorphism(identity_matrix(ZZ,2),domain_fan,codomain_fan)
sage: ray = Cone([(1,1)])
sage: f.image_cone(ray)
2-d cone of Rational polyhedral fan in 2-d lattice N
```
means, geometrically, that the orbit closure `P^1` corresponding to the cone `ray` (given by the relative star of `ray`) is mapped to the point corresponding to the `f.image_cone(ray)`. Conversely, the preimage cones of `f.image_cone(ray)` are `c1`, `c2`, and `ray`. Geometrically, this means that the preimage of the point `f.image_cone(ray)` consists of the torus orbits (north pole), (south pole), `C^*` making up the fiber `P^1`.

I kind of complained before that I don't quite understand the term "fan morphism" ;-)

From the beginning of the ticket:

Replying to [vbraun](#comment%3A6):
> Replying to [novoselt](#comment%3A5):
> > "it is a morphism between toric lattices with distinguished fans in the domain and codomain which are compatible with this morphism."

> 
> Yes, that is the usual definition. No restriction on the support of the underlying lattice map. 


So, as I understand we have a category with fans being objects. A fan is a collection of cones, each cone is a set of points. All cones of the fan sit in the same lattice, so there is also "the lattice of the fan."

Morphisms in this category are morphisms between lattices associated to fans, which map cones into cones as sets of points. So in particular they do define linear maps between individual cones as well, and I got lost when you said that they don't.

But I guess I agree that when we talk about images/preimages of cones, we should refer to the induced map between cones as a map between two finite sets, since we do not have a nice correspondence between cones as sets of points. Let me think a little more about it and post an updated patch.
