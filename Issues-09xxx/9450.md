The patch applies and works fine.  I have changed the docstring a little, added a test for factoring 0 and simplified the code in a couple of places.  I also added an example in sage/rings/arith.py since the generic factor() function now works on number field elements!

Since I changed quite a lot, I have left this as "needs review".
