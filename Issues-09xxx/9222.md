After the patch:

```
ERROR: Please add a `TestSuite(s).run()` doctest.
SCORE conway.py: 85% (6 of 7)

Missing documentation:
	 * _init(self):
```

I'm not convinced a `TestSuite` test makes sense here (and I have tried to put one in and got a pickling-related error).  Also, I'm not sure what `_init(self)` is meant to be doing, so I'm leaving it alone for now.

Looks fine to me. Tests pass and the documentation builds OK. I agree that the _init method isn't something one can reasonably doctest!
