The code in sage/libs/cremona wraps some of Cremona's modular symbols code, including Hecke operators.  The wrapping function incorrectly assumes that the function heckeop(p) only works for primes p not dividing the level, when in fact it works fine for primes dividing the level, in that case returning the matrix of the Atkin-Lehner involution.

The patch remedies this, with some tests.
