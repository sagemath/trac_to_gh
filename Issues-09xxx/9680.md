I just found this gem.  Apparently, something replaces "self" with the current classname in the documentation.  Amusingly, this almost made something comprehensible by accident.

where it should read "yourself" at the end of the sentence.

I only see this in the notebook.  The cause for the replacement lies in the file sagenb/misc/sageinspect.py, the line

```
        s = s.replace('self.','%s.'%obj_name)
```
in the function sage_getdoc.  There is an identical line in sage/misc/sageinspect.py, so I'm not sure why this doesn't show up in the command line, but I don't remember all the intricacies of how docstrings are produced in the two settings.
