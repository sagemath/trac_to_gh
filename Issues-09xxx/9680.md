I only see this in the notebook.  The cause for the replacement lies in the file sagenb/misc/sageinspect.py, the line

```
        s = s.replace('self.','%s.'%obj_name)
```
in the function sage_getdoc.  There is an identical line in sage/misc/sageinspect.py, so I'm not sure why this doesn't show up in the command line, but I don't remember all the intricacies of how docstrings are produced in the two settings.
