The relevant function seems to be `pretty_print` in `/sage/misc/latex.py`, but I don't know the right way to fix it. The function and `pretty_print_default` in same file, and the functions `displayhook` and `install` in `/sage/misc/displayhook.py` may also be relevant.

In the  ipython `displayhook` it checks to see if underscore was set explicitly and if so, it stops tracking.  We are setting it explicitly in `pretty_print`.  Maybe if we just stop doing this it will work.  Also we probably need to fix `pretty_print_default` to set it to the ipython `displayhook` instead of the default one.

```
    def check_for_underscore(self):
        """Check if the user has set the '_' variable by hand."""
        # If something injected a '_' variable in __builtin__, delete
        # ipython's automatic one so we don't clobber that.  gettext() in
        # particular uses _, so we need to stay away from it.
        if '_' in __builtin__.__dict__:
            try:
                del self.shell.user_ns['_']
            except KeyError:
                pass

I've posted a patch.  It doesn't have a test for this problem. I could make one, but it's slightly annoying since you have to do everything indirectly through an IPython shell object.
