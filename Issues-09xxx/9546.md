Given a Graph and a value associating an integer b(v) to each vertex v, this method computes an orientation of G such that each vertex has out_degree at most v, if it exists. 

The method is to use a max flow, which is explained in the patch in several lines.

Right O_o

The error comes from the ford_fulkerson algorithm. I replaced "floor(x)" by "x // 1".

I know I wrote this code myself, but when I looked at it I could only think : why on earth is our implementation of flows in Python and not Cython ? O_o

Updated ! Sorry for the trouble !

Using floor division here might be nice, but I'm concerned about the coercion model:

```

Also, floor division doesn't seem to buy you any speedup:

625 loops, best of 3: 9.33 µs per loop
625 loops, best of 3: 9.47 µs per loop

625 loops, best of 3: 9.44 µs per loop
625 loops, best of 3: 9.4 µs per loop
625 loops, best of 3: 9.4 µs per loop
625 loops, best of 3: 9.35 µs per loop
625 loops, best of 3: 9.31 µs per loop
625 loops, best of 3: 9.3 µs per loop
625 loops, best of 3: 9.4 µs per loop
```

All in all I think the better solution is to just bring floor(x) into scope from functions/other.py, as I've done in the attached patch.
