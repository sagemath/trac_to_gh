They contacted William and were considering giving one or two people access to a quick machine. But due to security issues about where the machine was hosted, it could only be one or two developers and from a couple of IP addresses.

I'm limited to AIX 5.3 due to the rather old hardware - you can see what I have listed above. 

There was some interest from IBM to semi-fund an AIX port of Sage. They contacted William and were considering giving one or two people access to a quick machine. But due to security issues about where the machine was hosted, it could only be one or two developers and from a couple of IP addresses. As such, both William and I said it was not worth bothering with. 

Then it became apparent IBM wanted us to concentrate on one specific package - it seemed to me IBM were hoping to get a specific tool working on AIX for zero cost to them. I said I'd do that bit if they paid me, but nothing came of that.
