When one build sage, the modification times of the following 3 files are changed. 

```
./README.txt
./COPYING.txt
./sage-README-osx.txt
```

Whilst not a major problem in itself, it does mean that 'make distclean' does not return the source tree to its original state. 

If one runs

```
$ 'make distclean'
$ find . -mtime -2
```
it will list all files modified in the last two days. Those files should not modified but they are. Some files created in the build process are not being removed, but they should be. That will be the subject of another ticket.

The other relevant ticket is #9083. These are two different but related problems, since

* The modification of unnecessary files. 
* Failing to remove files or directories with 'make distclean'

both result in 'make distclean' not doing what it should do.
