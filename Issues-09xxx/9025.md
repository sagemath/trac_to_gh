Attempting a 64-bit build of Sage on OpenSolaris I noticed several files are built 32-bit, even though SAGE64 is set to yes. This includes the following files. 

```
rkirkby@hawk:~/sage-4.4.2$ file local/bin/*.x | grep 32
local/bin/class.x: ELF 32-bit LSB executable 80386 Version 1 [FPU], dynamically linked, not stripped
local/bin/cws.x: ELF 32-bit LSB executable 80386 Version 1 [FPU], dynamically linked, not stripped
local/bin/nef.x: ELF 32-bit LSB executable 80386 Version 1 [FPU], dynamically linked, not stripped
local/bin/poly.x: ELF 32-bit LSB executable 80386 Version 1 [FPU], dynamically linked, not stripped
```

which are all part of 'PALP' There is nothing in the Makefile to force a 64-bit build on any platform, so I would not be surprised if only 32-bit objects were built on OS X or anywhere else where SAGE64 needs to be set to "yes" to get a 64-bit build.

Fixing this should be quite easy.

This was easily fixed by adding the flag -m64. I did this via 'sed' as it was the simplest way to change a few bytes in a large file. The revised package may be found here:

http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/patches/palp-1.1.p2.spkg

Now the files build 64-bit:

```

It is better if I do it, rather than you. Then you can review it.
