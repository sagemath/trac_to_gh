in the thread [How to deal with GAP's machine dependent random generator?] on sage-devel Simon King mentioned that GAP own random source dependes on endianness of the machine.
While Sage sort of takes care of this in misc/randstate.pyx,
it still does not fix GAP internals. So, to make it good and proper, we essentially add the fix in misc/randstate.pyx to GAPROOT/src/integer.c, and remove it from misc/randstate.pyx
The updated gap spkg is here:

http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/dima/packages/gap-4.4.12.p5.spkg

So one needs to install this spkg and apply the patch attached to the ticket. I don't seem to have access to a 64-bit big-endian system, so it would be great to test it there, just in case...
