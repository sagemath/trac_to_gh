After discussions, I realized that it is reasonable to define major_index only for the symmetric group. So I moved the method in the proper place. I also integrated all remarks and code corrections from the patch of Mike.

For Buildbot / reviewer / ... :

apply trac_9949_major_index_final-nb.patch

It is now ready for review.

Hi Nicolas,

If this only applies to symmetric groups, shouldn't it just return

```
sage.combinat.q_analogues.q_factorial(n)
```
?

This would be much more efficient than enumerating over the group.

Hy Jason

You are definitely right! I didn't know this module about q_analogues. I am going to change it and just make major_cycle point to the right q_analogue. As q_analogues is not imported by default, this ticket will just consist in building a shortcut...

Thanks for having regarded this!

Sorry if there is any confusion, but the reduction to a subset dates back from 7 weeks ago, and was already given a positive review by Jason Bandlow. I only changed the patch header from trac_9949_major_index_final-nb.patch. So I think it should be positive review.

Do you mind setting it back if we are now on the same line?

I understand everything now, but bear in mind that it is very important to write in the **ticket description** which patches have to be applied if it's not obvious.  If it weren't for the missing commit message, I would have merged all three patches instead of only the last one (and we would never have known that we did something wrong).

Sorry for all of that,

It is a 7 weeks old patch and despite I read sage-devel (and advises in sage-devel like the use of hg qrefresh -e and other patch submitting procedures), I didn't have the reflex of checking all my submitted patch to verify they are conforms. It is not the first time I am making this mistake. Sorry, I will try to be very very conscientious the next time.

And I am on the way checking all I already put in trac the last months...

Thanks for your help to all of you.
