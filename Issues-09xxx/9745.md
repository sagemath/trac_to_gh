```
The new version of PARI (see #9343) introduces a new type t_FFELT (finite field element).  Unfortunately, they pickle badly in Sage:

```
sage: gp_el = gp('ffgen(ffinit(2,3))')
sage: gp_el.type()
t_FFELT
sage: loads(dumps(gp_el)).type()
t_POL
```

A possible solution would be to implement pickling using PARI's `writebin()` and `read()`.
