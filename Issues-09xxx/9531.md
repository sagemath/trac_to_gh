The `spkg-check` file for [GNU Scientific Library (GSL)](http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/) consists of:

```/usr/bin/env bash

cd src

make check

if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
   echo "Error: make check for GSL failed"
fi
```

so the Sage build does not exit if `make check` fails. This is in contrast to virtually all other `spkg-check` files, where they would have:

```
make check

if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
   echo "Error: make check for GSL failed"
   exit 1
fi

```

The version of GSL in Sage happens to be almost 3 years old too.
