I plan to release mpmath 0.15 very soon. This will require some simple modifications to the extension code in Sage.

Some testing would be appreciated: apply the patch, replace the Sage mpmath install with an svn trunk checkout of mpmath, and check

```
sage: import mpmath
sage: mpmath.runtests()
sage: mpmath.doctests()
```

The patch doesn't support mpmath 0.14, so it can't be applied until the spkg is upgraded.

I installed the spkg and patch into 4.4.4.alpha0. "runtests" worked fine (finished in 12.9 seconds, compared to 15.7 for the mpmath shipped in 4.4.3), but "doctests" had one failure:

In 4.4.3, all the doctests pass.

Also, I think it's considered best to not post spkgs as ticket attachments -- usually you just put it somewhere on the web (your sage.math home directory is good) and post the link.

With your "fixfix" patch, the doctests pass. (This is on 64-bit Ubuntu.) The spkg looks good, although we should test it on some other platforms. I don't know enough Cython to say much about the patches, unfortunately.

I think applying the two sage repository patches to 4.5.alpha0 will fix all or nearly all of its [doctest failures](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-release/browse_thread/thread/28b187636fda282b).

At first glance (testing only the 10 files that had doctest failures), **yes**, i.e. applying these two patches to alpha0 fixes them **all** (see also sage-release).
