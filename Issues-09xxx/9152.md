I plan to release mpmath 0.15 very soon. This will require some simple modifications to the extension code in Sage.

Some testing would be appreciated: apply the patch, replace the Sage mpmath install with an svn trunk checkout of mpmath, and check

```
sage: import mpmath
sage: mpmath.runtests()
sage: mpmath.doctests()
```

The patch doesn't support mpmath 0.14, so it can't be applied until the spkg is upgraded.

In 4.4.3, all the doctests pass.

Also, I think it's considered best to not post spkgs as ticket attachments -- usually you just put it somewhere on the web (your sage.math home directory is good) and post the link.

At first glance (testing only the 10 files that had doctest failures), **yes**, i.e. applying these two patches to alpha0 fixes them **all** (see also sage-release).
