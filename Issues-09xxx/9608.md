A one-character patch! Nice.

It does get rid of the warning for me, but I'd like to understand why the docstring needs to be raw. How does that fix the unindent warning?

Not using a raw string but replacing the `\n`s with `\\n`s should also work.

Hrm, doing that doesn't fix the problem -- the function then gets a string with no newlines, but with literal "\n" bits.

I'm almost certain that making the docstring raw is the right thing to do, but I'd like to have someone who knows more about doctesting and Sphinx look at this.
