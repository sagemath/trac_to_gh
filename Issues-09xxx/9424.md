Symbolics sums returned from maxima cannot be numerically evaluated, since they don't define an `_evalf_()` method.

This was reported by dirkd on sage-support:

```
Why is evaluating this expression problematical?

y1(x)=x^2;y2(x)=5-x;
a0=1;an=3;Delta=(an-a0)/n;p(k)=a0+(k-1/2)*Delta;
I(n)=sum(abs(y2(p(k))-y1(p(k)))*Delta,k,1,n);
N(I(10))

SAGE respons:
<snipped traceback>
  File "expression.pyx", line 3797, in
sage.symbolic.expression.Expression.n (sage/symbolic/expression.cpp:
17022)
TypeError: cannot evaluate symbolic expression numerically
```

Your problem is threefold: 1. you use `n` both as sum endpoint and variable, 2. Sage `sum` is only intended with symbolic endpoints, and 3. the need to use Python summation may require defining a Python function instead of a Sage symbolic function:

```
sage: sum?
...
Warning: This function only works with symbolic expressions. To sum any
     other objects like list elements or function return values,
     please use python summation...

sage: I(n)=sum(abs(y2(p(k))-y1(p(k)))*Delta,k,1,n);
sage: I
n |--> 2*sum(abs(-4*k^2 - 3*(2*k - 1)*n + 3*n^2 + 4*k - 1), k, 1, n)/n^3

sage: def I(n):
....:     return (2*sum(abs(-4*k^2 - 3*(2*k - 1)*n + 3*n^2 + 4*k - 1) for k in range(1,n+1))/n^3)
....:

The result returned from maxima uses a symbolic function object created
on the fly. This is quite different from the sum() function
available on the command line, and unfortunately, it doesn't define a
numerical evaluation function, _evalf_().
```
Burcin knows this code very well, so I would be surprised if he misdiagnosed this.  But I figure maybe changing to enhancement will appease everyone :)

<a id='comment:9'>Comment 9:</a>
Burcin is spot-on:

```
sage: S=(I(10).operands()[0].operator()); S
sum
sage: type(S)
<class 'sage.symbolic.function_factory.NewSymbolicFunction'>
```
(Note the "New", not "BuiltIn" or similar. It's a completely generic placeholder)
we just need a symbolic function hooked up that can do some mildly intelligent evaluation when asked for it.

Incidentally, we can just map back to maxima and do the right thing there:

```
sage: maxima_calculus(I(10))
('sum(abs(4*_SAGE_VAR_k^2+56*_SAGE_VAR_k-329),_SAGE_VAR_k,1,10))/500
sage: SR(maxima_calculus(I(10)).simplify_sum())
1301/250
```
(I haven't checked if it's correct). You can see why the "simplify_sum" is required: the newly created "sum" function in SR is linked to the inert "'sum".

[A relevant ask.sagemath question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/9937/how-do-i-evaluate-sum-containing-factorial/).

[Another one](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/24911/exponentiation-makes-a-formula-go-crazy/).

Maybe it's time we fixed this.

Replying to [@kcrisman](#comment%3A12):
> Maybe it's time we fixed this.

It is not clear if forcing people to use `N()` and getting a float, even if there is an integer simplification of the sum, is the right thing to do. Granted, the error thrown on `N(I(10))` is a bug, and this ticket is about it. Here is a minimal example:

```
sage: (k,n) = var('k,n')
sage: f(n)=sum(abs(-k*k+n),k,1,n)
sage: f(n=8)
sum(abs(-k^2 + 8), k, 1, 8)
sage: N(f(8))
```
However, I would expect `f(n=8).simplify()` or `.expand()` to give me the result `162`, and this is #17422

I suppose there is the issue that one might not want to have to simplify in order to get a floating-point number.  Really, we shouldn't *require* that.  With #15346 one needs

```
sage: I(10).expand_sum().n()
```
but really `I(10).n()` should suffice, and for that we need a symbolic sum function.  I'll clarify the title, though, as you are right that this is at least now much more possible.  I'll probably add the example as a reviewer patch on #15346, in fact.

You'd think that given the massive amounts of snow here lately I'd have time to carefully look this over - but I don't :-(

*However* I think this looks like a good start at a solution, and definitely the first commit is an improvement in any case - perhaps one that deserves its own ticket, for quicker review?  (There might be more people interested in that, honestly.)  Unless someone complained with the name change - but it was never globally imported and frankly we do need a general expression tree walker more easily accessible, see #9329 for instance.  So connecting this (not here, maybe) to the `Converter` class it inherits from and explaining when one would use each one would be useful too.

The main concern I have in terms of the main purpose of the ticket is to adequately test and debug `DefiniteSumExpander`, especially since it is in the code in such a way that it isn't doctested (other than the case in question).

Most of it is doctested in #17759, i.e., its base class.

Nope!  I really didn't have a lot of time - never even saw the dependency field.  Maybe I shouldn't look at tickets after shoveling ;)

I did see that doctesting, I just would want to see what was different in the sum case.

I'll keep these on the front burner.
