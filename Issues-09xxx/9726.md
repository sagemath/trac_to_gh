I am really happy that this is here. Although RSA is almost trivial to implement, it is nice to have a version that anyone (eg, a very lazy or tired student) can just use without having to set up anything. However, I would prefer that Minh eventually comment on this since he knows the crypto class structure of sage better than I do. 

Note that examples are completely missing from the docstrings, so this cannot go in "as is" and I am marking this as "needs work".

However, thank you for creating this!
