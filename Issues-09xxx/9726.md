Note that examples are completely missing from the docstrings, so this cannot go in "as is" and I am marking this as "needs work".

The patch [attachment:trac_9726-srsa.patch] is the same as [attachment:srsa.patch], but here are the crucial differences:

* Put the ticket number in the commit message.
* Get rid of Windows newline convention. Use Unix style end of line characters.
