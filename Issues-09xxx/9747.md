Assignment to 1x1 submatrices specified by slices fails:

## Example

```

sage: A=matrix([[1,2],[3,4]])
sage: B=matrix([[1,3],[5,7]])
sage: A[1:2,1:2]=B[1:2,1:2]

TypeError: unable to coerce <type 'sage.matrix.matrix_integer_dense.Matrix_integer_dense'> to an integer

```
The problem seems to be that the method !__setitem!__ treats 1x1 submatices as elements of the rings over which the matrix is defined, while the method !__getitem!__ treats 1x1 submatices as 1x1 matrices.

Below I will attach a patch which changes the method !__setitem!__ to treat 1x1 submatices specified by slices as 1x1 matrices.

After applying the patch assignment to submatrixes specified by slices works as expected:


## Example

```
sage: A=matrix([[1,2],[3,4]])
sage: B=matrix([[1,3],[5,7]])
sage: A[1:2,1:2]=B[1:2,1:2]
sage: A
[1 2]
[3 7]
```

I added another patch (including a doctest) which fixes the bug in the case that only the second index is a slice. The following example works only after the second patch is applied:

## Example

```
sage: A=matrix([[1,2],[3,4]]); B=matrix([[1,3],[5,7]])
sage: A[1,0:1]=B[1,1:2]
sage: A
[1 2]
[7 4]
