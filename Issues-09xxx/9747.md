Assignment to 1x1 submatrices specified by slices fails:

```
The problem seems to be that the method !__setitem!__ treats 1x1 submatices as elements of the rings over which the matrix is defined, while the method !__getitem!__ treats 1x1 submatices as 1x1 matrices.

Below I will attach a patch which changes the method !__setitem!__ to treat 1x1 submatices specified by slices as 1x1 matrices.

After applying the patch assignment to submatrixes specified by slices works as expected:


## Example

```
sage: A=matrix([[1,2],[3,4]])
sage: B=matrix([[1,3],[5,7]])
sage: A[1:2,1:2]=B[1:2,1:2]
sage: A
[1 2]
[3 7]
```
