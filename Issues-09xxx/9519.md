Building Sage 4.5 on a Sun Blade 2000, with dual UltraSPARC III+ processors in 64-bit mode, the build process produces some obvious **error** messages. These are not warnings, but errors. 

```
gcc _configtest.o -L/export/home/drkirkby/64/sage-4.5/local/lib -lf77blas -lcblas -latlas -o _configtest
ld: fatal: file _configtest.o: wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS64
ld: fatal: File processing errors. No output written to _configtest
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
ld: fatal: file _configtest.o: wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS64
ld: fatal: File processing errors. No output written to _configtest
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
failure.
removing: _configtest.c _configtest.o
Status: 255
Output:
```

`wrong ELF class:` messages mean an attempt was made to link a mixture of 32-bit and 64-bit object files. 

But the build process still goes on to report that scipy has installed OK. 

```
real    22m34.927s
user    20m23.356s
sys     1m5.603s
Successfully installed scipy-0.7.p5
```

What is odd, is that `spkg-install` looks to be OK to me. 

```
python setup.py build
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Error building scipy."
    exit 1
fi

# Intall
python setup.py install
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Error installing scipy."
    exit 1
fi
```

The problem is **not** like the cephes package, or several others, where the return code of *make* is not checked.  

At this point, I've not no idea if this is an upstream bug, or a Sage bug. 

Anyone got any ideas?
