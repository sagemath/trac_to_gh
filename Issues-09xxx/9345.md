Sage crashes if try to perform a rational_reconstruction with zero modulus and compiled fast algorithm

```
sage: rational_reconstruction(1,0)


------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGFPE: An unhandled floating point exception occured in Sage.
This probably occured because a *compiled* component
of Sage has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
or is not properly wrapped with `_sig_`on, `_sig_`off.
You might want to run Sage under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
Sage will now terminate (sorry).

The following files have a call to rational_reconstruction, computed using

```
and code to make Sage crash

* rings/integer.pyx

```
 sage: ZZ(1).rational_reconstruction(0)
```
  Calls rational.pyrex_rational_reconstruction

* rings/rational.pyx

```
 sage: sage.rings.rational.pyrex_rational_reconstruction(1,0)
```
* rings/arith.py

```
 sage: rational_reconstruction(1,0)
```
  Calls ZZ.rational_reconstruction

* rings/finite_rings/element_ext_pari.py

  Unable to crash, it is an element of a finite field. Anyway, it calls arith.rational_reconstruction

* rings/finite_rings/integer_mod.pyx

  Unable to crash, an element mod 0 is an Integer. Anyway, it calls ZZ.rational_reconstruction

* rings/padics/padic_generic_element.pyx

  Unable to crash, modulus of a p-adic element is not zero. anyway, it calls arith.rational_reconstruction

* matrix/matrix_rational_dense.pyx

1. `_lift_crt_`rr
2. `_lift_crt_rr_with_`lcm


   Obsolete functions for crt? They seem not to be used anywhere. By the code, it seems tha mm should be a list of moduli matrices (call of `_lift_`crt). On the other hand, the product should be an integer 
m= mm.prod(); mpq_rational_reconstruction(Q_row[j], Z_row[j], m.value) So I cannot test whether there is a problem for these functions. I am not able to get crashes or any sensible output from these functions.

I think one should find out which code really causes the crash, because `_sig_`on/_sig_off should be used there.  See [http://sagemath.org/doc/developer/coding_in_other.html#the-pari-c-library-interface](http://sagemath.org/doc/developer/coding_in_other.html#the-pari-c-library-interface) (the docs are about PARI but apply more generally to all C and Cython code).

Well, there was a similar problem in #9357 and I got this answer to the question of `_sig_`onm, `_sig_`off

http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/e8317365bfe9e6e8/2a4148024500dfd2

Note that if the exception is controlled by _sig, it will raise a RuntimeError instead of ZeroDivisionError. Moreover, with the patch I provided, all ocurrences of being zero are catched and never reaches the C functions.

Anyway, I have written a second patch that add the `_sig_`on, `_sig_`off to the problematic functions, so if they have to be added, apply the following patches (in order):

trac_9345.3.patch
trac-9345-sigs.patch

Well, the `_sig_`on and `_sig_`off are in the wrong places (_sig_on should be before any mpz or mpq function is called and `_sig_`off after). I can have a look at this if you want.
