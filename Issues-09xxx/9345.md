Sage crashes if try to perform a rational_reconstruction with zero modulus and compiled fast algorithm

```
sage: rational_reconstruction(1,0)


------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGFPE: An unhandled floating point exception occured in Sage.
This probably occured because a *compiled* component
of Sage has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
or is not properly wrapped with _sig_on, _sig_off.
You might want to run Sage under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
Sage will now terminate (sorry).

I'm mostly OK with lftabera's patch. Here are some changes that needs to be made:

* Reference the ticket number in the relevant regression test.
* Use the Python 3.x compliant way of raising exceptions.
* Add a more general regression test.
* Credit lftabera in his patch. (We don't accept anonymous patches.) Put a sensible commit message in lftabera's patch. So one now uses [trac_9345.2.patch](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/attachment/ticket/9345/trac_9345.2.patch) instead of [trac_9345.patch](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/attachment/ticket/9345/trac_9345.patch).

Well, there was a similar problem in #9357 and I got this answer to the question of _sig_onm, _sig_off

http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/e8317365bfe9e6e8/2a4148024500dfd2

Note that if the exception is controlled by _sig, it will raise a RuntimeError instead of ZeroDivisionError. Moreover, with the patch I provided, all ocurrences of being zero are catched and never reaches the C functions.

Anyway, I have written a second patch that add the _sig_on, _sig_off to the problematic functions, so if they have to be added, apply the following patches (in order):

trac_9345.3.patch
trac-9345-sigs.patch

Well, the _sig_on and _sig_off are in the wrong places (_sig_on should be before any mpz or mpq function is called and _sig_off after). I can have a look at this if you want.
