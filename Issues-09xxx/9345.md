Sage crashes if try to perform a rational_reconstruction with zero modulus and compiled fast algorithm

```
sage: rational_reconstruction(1,0)


------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGFPE: An unhandled floating point exception occured in Sage.
This probably occured because a *compiled* component
of Sage has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
or is not properly wrapped with _sig_on, _sig_off.
You might want to run Sage under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
Sage will now terminate (sorry).

I'm mostly OK with lftabera's patch. Here are some changes that needs to be made:

* Reference the ticket number in the relevant regression test.
* Use the Python 3.x compliant way of raising exceptions.
* Add a more general regression test.
* Credit lftabera in his patch. (We don't accept anonymous patches.) Put a sensible commit message in lftabera's patch. So one now uses [trac_9345.2.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9345/trac_9345.2.patch.gz) instead of [trac_9345.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9345/trac_9345.patch.gz). 

See the ticket description for instructions on how to apply the relevant patches. Only my proposed changes need review by anyone but me. If they are OK, then the whole ticket receives a positive review.

The following files have a call to rational_reconstruction, computed using

```
sage: search_src('rational_reconstruction',interact=False)

```
and code to make Sage crash

* rings/integer.pyx

```
 sage: ZZ(1).rational_reconstruction(0)
```
  Calls rational.pyrex_rational_reconstruction

* rings/rational.pyx

```
 sage: sage.rings.rational.pyrex_rational_reconstruction(1,0)
```
* rings/arith.py

```
 sage: rational_reconstruction(1,0)
```
  Calls ZZ.rational_reconstruction

* rings/finite_rings/element_ext_pari.py

  Unable to crash, it is an element of a finite field. Anyway, it calls arith.rational_reconstruction

* rings/finite_rings/integer_mod.pyx

  Unable to crash, an element mod 0 is an Integer. Anyway, it calls ZZ.rational_reconstruction

* rings/padics/padic_generic_element.pyx

  Unable to crash, modulus of a p-adic element is not zero. anyway, it calls arith.rational_reconstruction

* matrix/matrix_rational_dense.pyx

1. _lift_crt_rr
2. _lift_crt_rr_with_lcm


   Obsolete functions for crt? They seem not to be used anywhere. By the code, it seems tha mm should be a list of moduli matrices (call of _lift_crt). On the other hand, the product should be an integer 
m= mm.prod(); mpq_rational_reconstruction(Q_row[j], Z_row[j], m.value) So I cannot test whether there is a problem for these functions. I am not able to get crashes or any sensible output from these functions.

* matrix/matrix_integer_sparse.pyx

```
 sage: M = random_matrix(ZZ, 3, 3, 'sparse')
 sage: M.rational_reconstruction()
```
  Calls misc.matrix_integer_sparse_rational_reconstruction

* matrix/misc.pyx

New patch with all the modifications. Respecting the code, the patch only changes rings/rational.pyx and matrix/misc.pyx where the offending code is.

However, I have added doctests to check all the crashes in the previous post. This might be overkilling though.

Well, there was a similar problem in #9357 and I got this answer to the question of _sig_onm, _sig_off

http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/e8317365bfe9e6e8/2a4148024500dfd2

Note that if the exception is controlled by _sig, it will raise a RuntimeError instead of ZeroDivisionError. Moreover, with the patch I provided, all ocurrences of being zero are catched and never reaches the C functions.

Anyway, I have written a second patch that add the _sig_on, _sig_off to the problematic functions, so if they have to be added, apply the following patches (in order):

trac_9345.3.patch
trac-9345-sigs.patch
