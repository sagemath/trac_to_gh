Of course, we should try to reconcile the two files, to the extent it's permitted by SageNB's status as an independent project.  I believe we've been updating them together when one changes, in order to keep both current.

Please excuse if my upload violates any rules regarding Sage-SageNB collaboration...

The patch is almost the same as the one to the Sage library here: https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8988/trac_8988-sageinspect_doctest_fix.patch.gz

I've built a SageNB 0.8.1.p1 spkg, installed it on 4.5.2.alpha0, and `./sage -t -long -sagenb` passed all tests.

(I'm not going to upload the patched spkg though, it's almost 19MB. So if appropriate, someone else has to provide it on sage.math.)
