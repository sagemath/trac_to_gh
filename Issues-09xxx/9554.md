I've applied the 3 patches mentioned in #8988 [comment:ticket:8988:42 comment 42].  The failure above is in the *notebook's* `sageinspect.py` file, which is very similar to the Sage library's version.

Of course, we should try to reconcile the two files, to the extent it's permitted by SageNB's status as an independent project.  I believe we've been updating them together when one changes, in order to keep both current.

Please excuse if my upload violates any rules regarding Sage-SageNB collaboration...

The patch is almost the same as the one to the Sage library here: http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/attachment/ticket/8988/trac_8988-sageinspect_doctest_fix.patch

I've built a SageNB 0.8.1.p1 spkg, installed it on 4.5.2.alpha0, and `./sage -t -long -sagenb` passed all tests.

(I'm not going to upload the patched spkg though, it's almost 19MB. So if appropriate, someone else has to provide it on sage.math.)

Do you have a Sage cluster (i.e., sage.math, boxen.math, etc.) account?  If not, William Stein can make one for you.
