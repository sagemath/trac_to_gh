Try

```
save_session('foo')
```
in the notebook.  Boom!

The problem is these lines in misc/session.pyx:

```
    if embedded():
        # Also save D to the data directory if we're using the notebook.
        save(D, '../../data/' + name)
```

When I rewrote the notebook I forgot to change this appropriately.  I'm not sure exactly what the right fix is, but it is to somehow replace '../../data/' by the data
directory (which is defined by the variable DATA in the notebook).
