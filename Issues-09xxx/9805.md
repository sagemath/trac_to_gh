Try

```
save_session('foo')
```
in the notebook.  Boom!

The problem is these lines in misc/session.pyx:

```
    if embedded():
        # Also save D to the data directory if we're using the notebook.
        save(D, '../../data/' + name)
```

When I rewrote the notebook I forgot to change this appropriately.  I'm not sure exactly what the right fix is, but it is to somehow replace '../../data/' by the data
directory (which is defined by the variable DATA in the notebook).

Interestingly, this works even if you *don't* save the worksheet - the cells that one made new disappear, but the sobj still appears.  This works nicely.

In this one case I am not sure if a doctest is useful - can you think of a viable one?

This issue is actually fixed (as opposed to being warned against) in #17482 - it turned out to be nearly trivial, as there is a symlink to `DATA` in every cell directory!
