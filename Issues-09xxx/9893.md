In Sage, there is no reason for the PARI library to catch signals (by default, it catches SIGBUS, SIGFPE, SIGINT, SIGBREAK, SIGPIPE, SIGSEGV).

The attached patch also simplifies `PariInstance.__init__()` and removes some unused variables.

Parts of an earlier version this patch has been moved to #9678.
