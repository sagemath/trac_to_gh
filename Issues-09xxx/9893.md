In Sage, there is no reason for the PARI library to catch signals (by default, it catches SIGBUS, SIGFPE, SIGINT, SIGBREAK, SIGPIPE, SIGSEGV).

The attached patch also simplifies `PariInstance.__init__()` and removes some unused variables.

Parts of an earlier version this patch has been moved to #9678.

All long doctests pass on a 32-bit PPC OS X 10.4 and on a 64-bit Intel Linux.  This patch was first included in #10018, then in #9678 and now I have separated it again in order to make #9678 not too much of a patch bomb.  The current version of the patch is pretty much the same as the old version of 5 weeks ago.  The patch makes sense by itself, but of course it is partially motivated by #9678.  Remark also that currently all tests in `sage/libs/pari` pass with #9678, #10061 and #10030 applied.
