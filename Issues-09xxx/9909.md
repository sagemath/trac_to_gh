From a user who found it difficult to uninvite Share people:

```
I wouldn't call it a bug either, but it just wasn't obvious that to remove a collaborator, you would click "invite collaborators." Â I had tried deleting the name and then clicking "save and quit" in the upper right.
```
This should be clarified.  Perhaps it should be "update collaborator list" or something like that.
