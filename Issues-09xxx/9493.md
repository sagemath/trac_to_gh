(Even if it was, it doesn't make a difference, but...)

Like in C, the second expression is only evaluated if needed (same for `||`), such that

```sh
foo && bar || baz
``` 
is equivalent to

```sh
if foo; then
    bar
else
    baz
fi
```


However, the <code>[ \`ls patches\` != "" ]</code> is suboptimal. The whole line could be

```sh
if ls patches/* >/dev/null 2>/dev/null; then
```

(One could substitute `ls` by e.g. `cat`, too.)  It was just one suggestion anyway.

Nothing of the TODOs mentioned in the description have been done on #10187; removing the other parts was just the correction of a regression.

So IMHO this ticket should be kept open.

No idea whether that's at all still necessary (when removing the unused GMP source tree) -- we're meanwhile at ECL 12.12.1...

> Another simple solution is just leaving `install-sh` in `src/src/gmp` (untested) or just copying it to `${srcdir} ` and adding *that* directory to the `for` list.

Ooops, just noticed:

```sh

```

So there's meanwhile not much of GMP left (in our spkg), but its `config*` files still disturb: #14648

Hence the `install-sh` fix above should still be valid (and useful) ...

Note that the implib patch is not part of this ticket.
But for what it's worth note that I used to communicate with the ECL dev and got a bunch of patches into ECL but not that one and now he's no longer maintaining ECL.
Not sure if anyone is actually actively maintaining ECL anymore...
Once there is someone clearly identified we could just bump the request to get that in as at least from my point of view it perfectly makes sense to build shared lib this way on Cygwin.
