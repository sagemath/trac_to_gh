We include the RPy spkg in the R spkg and install the former from the latter.  It would be less potentially confusing to move RPy outside of R but make it depend on R and any other prerequisites in `spkg/standard/deps`.

The necessary changes to `spkg/install` and `spkg/standard/deps` are already there, but currently commented out. Apply the following patch **to the Sage root repository** to activate them:

Looks like. Before the spkgs have their first anniversary...

There are (still) some things that could be done, e.g. using `patch` and patching the `pkg-config` file (`libR.pc`) from `spkg-install`.

We could also perhaps either recompress the contained recommended R packages (`.tar.gz`) with `bzip2` or decompress them to plain `tar` files, as we compress the whole spkg with `bzip2` anyway. Haven't yet tried that though.

RPy (and perhaps R) should IMHO be upgraded on a follow-up ticket.

I see the hardcoding issues shouldn't be hard to fix; the current (more or less superfluous) patch to `R.sh.in` and the corresponding Python script do only half of the job, namely setting `R_HOME_DIR` to `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib/R/`, but not changing `R_SHARE_DIR`, `R_INCLUDE_DIR` and `R_DOC_DIR`.

But before I do so, I think the new spkgs should first be tested as they are.

I'll then make a p6, either here or (preferably) on a follow-up ticket if no other issues arise with the p5.

#9668 if you don't object...



> I didn't realize these spkgs were actually ready :)

I didn't know either. ;-)

More or less just completed the Changelog entries.



> Comments/questions: 

> * Do we need to unset `R_PROFILE` completely, or can we save that in a temp variable, unset it, then reset it after the spkg installs?  (If not because it would mess up RPy, we would have to do that there too.)

It's not fully clear to me what you mean by that. Unsetting `R_PROFILE` there only lasts until we leave `spkg-install`, i.e., is only effective within `spkg-install` and everything that's called from it. (Same applies to `spkg-check`.)

Actually I apparently didn't think of unsetting (or forgot to unset) `R_PROFILE` also in *RPy's* `spkg-install`; I'm not sure if RPy could break otherwise, but doing so shouldn't hurt.

IIRC there were also problems with `R_PROFILE` when *using* Sage's R, which would have to be addressed in e.g. `sage-env` and/or the Sage library, not [necessarily] the spkg itself.



> * Do we need an 'echo' regarding the comment about the `$MAKE check` so that if it does fail, people know what to do?

Well, I was expecting testing this being part of the review process, so I just added a comment. I can of course also print an appropriate message in case the (parallel) test should fail, but perhaps in the p6 on another ticket. (Automatically rerunning the test suite sequentially would IMHO be a less good idea.)



> * What happened to Dave's favorite `"x$SAGE64" = xyes` (you removed the 'x's)?

I get eye cancer from such, it's worse readable and hence error-prone. If `test "" = foo` would evaluate to `true` (on some supported systems) Sage would certainly break in many places, not just because *we* use that all around. *Quoting* is important.

(The broken instance of `test` was btw. a shell built-in version [besides some *really very old* `test` implementations which were less robust w.r.t. invalid expressions], and we explicitly use `bash` anyway. Prepending characters to variable expansions can make sense in different contexts, and is sometimes used to save the quotes, though the latter is also quite ugly. Similar applies to *not* using `-o` and `-a`.)

If one wanted to go really safe, one would either explicitly use `bash`'s built-in version of `test` (`[This is the Trac macro *"$SAGE64" = yes * that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#"$SAGE64" = yes -macro)`), use `case "$SAGE64" in yes) ...`, or perhaps

```sh
[ "${SAGE64:-no}" = yes ]
```
which is the equivalent of Python's

```python
os.environ.get("SAGE64", "no") == "yes"
```



> * Any reason to include the old RPy installation in the `if false` block?

Not really.

> Presumably if one really wanted to, the HG is there - I can't imagine this being very interesting to anyone.

Sure, though it is buried by lots of other changes in the same changeset. I intended to remove it later, temporarily kept it just for documentation purposes.



> Note I have not actually installed or tested this yet :)

Hope you'll do so later. :)

Ok.

`R_PROFILE` doesn't appear in any of RPy's source files, so I don't think so. (I perhaps checked that last year, but forgot about it. :D )

Just a note to self/any other reviewer of what would have to be tested.
* Upgrading rpy2 by itself.
* Upgrading r by itself.
* Then upgrading rpy2 after having upgraded r.
* And test R and rpy2 after each step.
* Test with and without `R_PROFILE` set.
* Test with and without `SAGE_CHECK` set.
* Test with `SAGE_CHECK` yes with and without parallel make.

-* Disable parallel make install properly.
-* Use $MAKE in spkg-check.
-* Use CFLAG64 if defined rather than hardcoded -m64.
-* Don't override user-specified flags unless necessary.
-* Disable optimization if SAGE_DEBUG=yes, add debug symbols by default.
-* Also respect SAGE_FAT_BINARY in second attempt to configure.
