This patch implements `attrcall.__hash__`. Its absence caused the
following misbehavior:

```
    sage: x = attrcall("blah")
    sage: y = attrcall("blah")
    sage: x == y
    True
    sage: hash(x) == hash(y)
    False
```

which in particular broke unique representation and pickling of some
crystals (see #8911).
