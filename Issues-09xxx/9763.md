```
This is a module that implements physical units in a more convenient way than the already existing units module: instead of creating separate variables for each unit, it creates an object containing the value, the dimension (mass, length, time...) as a list, and the units as an expression, plus the conversion factor. 

It includes an easy-to-use function to create units from a string, implements `SI` prefixes and has a nice `LaTeX` output.

TO DO: Add more units (there are currently only 74, plus 13 constants), review the documentation and code in case it doesn't follow the Sage style, modify sage/symbolic/all.py to include this module (adding "import metrology" causes Sage to throw exceptions when starting).

<a id='comment:4'></a>As burcin said, the idea was to have this as a replacement for the current units module, without removing the old one. (Another idea was to call it units2, but that looked kind of ugly)

Making `Units` derive from `SageObject` might be a good idea; however I didn't know much about Sage (nor do I now, actually) so I didn't consider this possibility. Maybe a Units ring could be made too.

The `U()` function was called this way so one could create units conveniently, like

```python
from metrology import U
length = U("1 m")
```
However, it's not necessary to have this function on the top level namespace, and Python guidelines usually suggest something like

```python
import metrology
length = metrology.U("1 m")
```

As for advantages/disadvantages, well, I don't remember them all, but here's a rough list:

### Pros

* Create units from a text string, including multiples and fractions.
* LaTeX representation of units.
* Abstraction of units, as (value, unit !SI value, unit dimmensions), which allows to know the mass-length-time decomposition of the magnitude.
* `0 * 1m = 0 m`, not just `0`. Also, it's possible to convert from 0 degrees Celsius to Fahrenheit, which is impossible with the current `units` module.

### Cons

* `Units` is a class written from scratch, with all operations (`__add__()`, `__mul__()`...) coded explicitly.
* Interoperability with other data types (for example, a matrix of units) might be messy.
* The `units` module has a pretty nice documentation for each unit, not present in this module.
* It's very incomplete, missing a lot of units.
