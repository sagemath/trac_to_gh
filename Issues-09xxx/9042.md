## Build environment
* Sun Ultra 27 3.33 GHz Intel W3580 Xeon. Quad core. 8 threads. 12 GB RAM
* OpenSolaris 2009.06 snv_134 X86
* Sage 4.4.2
* gcc 4.4.4

## How gcc 4.4.4 was configured
Since the configuration of gcc is fairly critical on OpenSolaris, here's how it was built. 

```
drkirkby@hawk:~/sage-4.4.2$ gcc -v
Using built-in specs.
Target: i386-pc-solaris2.11
Configured with: ../gcc-4.4.4/configure --prefix=/usr/local/gcc-4.4.4 --with-as=/usr/local/binutils-2.20/bin/as --with-ld=/usr/ccs/bin/ld --with-gmp=/usr/local --with-mpfr=/usr/local
Thread model: posix
gcc version 4.4.4 (GCC) 
```

gcc 4.3.4 was failing to build iconv. 

## How the Sage build was attempted
* 64-bit build. SAGE64 was set to "yes"
* #9008 update zlib to latest upstream release to allow a 64-bit library to be built. 
* #9009 update mercurial spkg to build 64-bit.
* #7982 update sage_fortran so it can build 64-bit binaries.
* Run 'make -k' so make did not stop on errors, so errors can be listed. 


## How Python was build

It should be noted that python builds as a 64-bit application. There is no need to set any environment variables like CFLAGS for Python to build 64-bit. 

```
drkirkby@hawk:~/sage-4.4.2$ file local/bin/python
local/bin/python: ELF 64-bit LSB executable AMD64 Version 1, dynamically linked, not stripped
```

We can see a few modules did not build

```
ailed to find the necessary bits to build these modules:
_bsddb             bsddb185           dl
gdbm               imageop            linuxaudiodev
ossaudiodev
To find the necessary bits, look in setup.py in detect_modules() for the module's name.


Failed to build these modules:
_curses            _curses_panel      _socket
_ssl               _tkinter           sunaudiodev
```

The faillure of _socket to build has caused problems with pygments (#9041) and ipython (#9022), but does not seem to be the cause of the problem with Cython. 

## The problem with Cython
This is related to #8116, which was closed as invalid, but it would appear the problem can still rear its ugly head.

```

## The likely cause
The -m64 flag is not being used in the compile line shown, but Python was built 64-bit, so I suspect the issue is related to a mix of 32-bit and 64-bit code. 

## Other OpenSolaris issues
Some other problems which are failing to allow Sage to build 64-bit on OpenSolaris are listed at #9026.

This won't solve the problem, but you could try changing the line in spkg-install to 

```
python setup.py install --no-cython-compile

And see if you can then compile anything else.

Thank you. That revised package solves the problem, though I can't see what you have patched! I don't see any -m64 or $OPT added or removed from spkg-install or any entry in SPKG.txt as to what has changed. 

Also, there is an unwanted file.

But Cython does now build.

I suppose I could add an entry there, though that'd be redundant with the revision control.

I like the idea, though I don't understand enough of python or Mercurial to review it. Anything that prevents mistakes, or generally improves the quality is a good idea in my opinion.
