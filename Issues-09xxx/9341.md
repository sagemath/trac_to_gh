Here is a stupid example:

```
sage: _.<t>=QQ[]
sage: K.<T>=NumberField(t-1)
sage: I = K.ideal(2)
sage: K.S_units([I])
[2, -1]
sage: K.S_units([I, I])
[2, 2, -1]
```
Looking at the code, this seems to be an upstream issue with gp as well.

Sorry about this minor fix now being spread across 3 git commits, still getting the hang of the "new" workflow.  Is there a way to flatten the commits into one?  (After having pushed to the trac server?)
