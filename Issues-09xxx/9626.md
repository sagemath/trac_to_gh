The information given at http://wiki.sagemath.org/Sage_Spkg_Tracking is fairly out of date (and incomplete).

Perhaps we could add updating this page to the [release manager's task/check list](http://wiki.sagemath.org/devel/ReleaseManagement) (in case a new release includes updated spkgs).

I also consider adding a column "Upcoming" which people creating/updating spkgs can fill with the next version and, if appropriate, a link to the corresponding ticket. An alternative is to add a second *row* for each upcoming spkg, just below the main row for that package, i.e. its current version within Sage.

Another useful column would be something like "Valid of", containing the date and/or Sage version each entry (row) has been updated last.

The column "Latest stable (upstream) release" is subject to change more or less frequently, independent of Sage releases; so if we keep it, it should perhaps continually be updated by the spkg maintainers, or at least carry a date, indicating when this information was entered.
