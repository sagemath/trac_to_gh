Right now there is either equals, or less than. If `a != b`, then we get `a < b` but not `b > a`:

```
sage: a = Set([1])
sage: b = Set([])
sage: a == b
False
sage: a < b
True
sage: b > a
False
```

The noted behaviour is definitely a bug. However, the attached patch solves this by introducing an attempt at inducing a total ordering on Sets by sorting them first by cardinality and then by lexicographic ordering on the sorted list of set elements. This only works if the elements of the set have a total ordering implemented.

While python used to try to have a total ordering on all objects, this has been abandoned (e.g. python complex numbers and python sets)

Shouldn't the sage design follow python in this respect? See also

I don't understand why you have these lines:

```
            if len_self != len_other: 
	                return cmp(len_self, len_other) 
```
that just makes it so that the comparison is incompatible with what it is for lists.  Why not just make it the same?

I think the patch behaviour of

```

sage: a = [2,3]
sage: b = [2,3,4j]
sage: set(a) < set(b)
True
sage: Set(a) < Set(b)
False

```

is too dangerous to let pass unremarked.

In Python (according to http://docs.python.org/library/sets.html) for the set type we have: "The subset and equality comparisons do not generalize to a complete ordering function. For example, any two disjoint sets are not equal and are not subsets of each other, so all of the following return False: a<b, a==b, or a>b. Accordingly, sets do not implement the __cmp__() method."

The Python convention does make sense and is what most people would expect... and is the direction Sage should move in.

RLM who wrote "I completely, emphatically disagree." has got sucked up into an industry job, so isn't involved in Sage development right now, so I don't think he'll care much what happens with this ticket. 

That said, having a total ordering -- which is different and inconsistent with set's order -- is useful (!).  However, it can be done as a separate explicit function or method, which can get passed to the sort method explicitly.
