Excellent ! You can set this one to "positive review" immediately after #9375 :-)

One unimportant detail, though... You used subgraph_search in your doctests, the follwing way :

```
sage: s_K = g.subgraph_search(K_n1, induced=True) 
sage: s_P = g.subgraph_search(P_n2, induced=True) 
sage: K_n1.is_isomorphic(s_K) 
```

Well, subgraph_search should of course *always* return subgraphs isomorphic to S_k. Actually, the order of the vertices should even be the same, but when it finds nothing, it returns a None, which is_isomorphic may not like... It's not really a problem in this case, as this would report a doctest failure anyway :-)

I don't understand what you mean. Care to elaborate on this point?

Sorry, I meant #9373 :-)

It was just to avoid having a ticket A depending on B such that a is positively reviewed while B is not.
