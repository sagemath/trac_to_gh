See #4838 and #8082 for the first addition of this.  Unfortunately, it only supports things like `CC`:

```
sage: point([CC(1.00000000000000 + 0.500000000000000*I)]) # works
sage: point([1.00000000000000 + 0.500000000000000*I]) # nope
```

A little experimentation suggests that Python complexes also aren't supported.  Fixing this should also allow plotting `line`s in the complex plane pretty easily.

Also

```
sage: list_plot([1, I]) # works
sage: point([1, I]) # does not work
sage: point([I, 1]) # does not work
sage: point([CC(I), CC(1)]) # works
```
I'm labeling this a defect rather than enhancement because it would be confusing not to have both.
