Toric lattices are ZZ<sup>n</sup>'s with distinction of their roles (in the simplest case - standard dual lattices M and N).

This patch is a part of the following series adding support for  cones/fans and toric varieties to Sage:

Prerequisites:

#8675  - Remove `AmbientSpace._constructor` and fix consequences

#8682  - Improve `AlgebraicScheme_subscheme.__init__` and `AmbientSpace._validate`

#8694  - Improve schemes printing and LaTeXing

#8934  - Trivial bug in computing faces of non-full-dimensional lattice  polytopes

#8936  - Expose facet inequalities for lattice polytopes

#8941  - `_latex_` and `origin` for lattice polytopes

Main  patches adding new modules:

#9062  - Add support for toric lattices

#8986  - Add support for convex rational polyhedral cones

#8987  - Add support for rational polyhedral fans

#8988  - Add support for toric varieties

#8989  - Add support for Fano toric varieties

While testing I found a heisenbug caused by this patch. If you run "make ptestlong", there is a failure in toric_lattice_element.pyx; but it works fine if you doctest just that file.

The problem is this comparison function:

```
    def __cmp__(self, right):
        r"""
[...]
            sage: cmp(n, 1)
            -1
        """
        c = cmp(type(self), type(right))
        if c:
            return c
```

The doctest is sensitively dependent on the exact memory locations of different classes, because `cmp(type(self), type(right))` compares on memory addresses. I suggest changing the doctest to 

```
sage: n == 1
False
```
which is much more robust.

David
