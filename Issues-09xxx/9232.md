I can't see Graphics3d objects on the command line. For example, 

```
sage: sphere()
sage: 
```
The command returns without starting jmol or producing any other graphical output.

Strangely enough, I can start jmol from the sage command line:

Does it work if you install the new version of Jmol?  See trac # 9238.  I think this broke when the notebook was put inside an egg.  I took that into account with the new version of Jmol.

Try installing the Jmol for notebook again.  It looks like the file on my server got corrupted and was missing the Jmol.jar application file as well as some others..Not sure what happened but we've had some power outages and the server may have been rebuilt from backups.  I've uploaded a new copy.

Because the name hasn't changed you will probably have to do some surgery to get it to download and do an install.  You will need to delete any copies of the .spkg (or its uncompressed directory) that you find in any of these subdirectories of your sage install before trying an install.  If you don't get a message about downloading the file you missed something:
spkg/build
spkg/installed
spkg/optional

Let us know if this fixes it.  Sorry for the inconvenience.

There is something special about your system...I've just retested that things work for Sage 4.4.3 on MacOS and Ubuntu Linux.  Let's see if everything actually got installed:
Can you please post the directory listing (ls -l please) for the following two directories:
<sage directory>/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sagenb-0.8-py2.6.egg/sagenb/data/jmol
and
<sage directory>/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sagenb-0.8-py2.6.egg/sagenb/data/jmol/appletweb

If everything is there, I'm mystified.  If everything is not, then something is wrong with the install for your system and the .spkg needs to be fixed.

But sage install zlib in

```
[vbraun@volker-two sage-4.5.alpha1]$ find | grep zlib.so
./local/lib/python2.6/lib-dynload/zlib.so
```
Note: `/lib/`, not `/lib64/`. This explains why zlib cannot be imported. For the record, all libraries are 64-bit on my system.

From within Sage, on the other hand, `sys.path` is set appropriately:

```
sage: '/home/vbraun/Sage/sage/local/lib/python2.6/lib-dynload' in sys.path
True
```

For the record, creating a symlink $SAGE_ROOT/local/lib64 pointing to $SAGE_ROOT/local/lib works. Another workaround is adding LIBRARY_PATH to DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH in sage-native-execute (from logix/#sage-devel).

I still don't understand the underlying cause, where does python get the incorrect path from?

The above patches combined with installation of a newer version of Jmol fix this problem for Sage 4.6.2.  To install the new Jmol

```
./sage -f "http://www.uwosh.edu/faculty_staff/gutow/Jmol_for_SageNoteBook-1.1.5.spkg"

Note that my linux and MacOS versions of sage seemed to have slightly different mercurial tracking.  On MacOS you get a warning about the SageMenu.mnu file, when you apply the notebook_fixes patch.  That is OK, the other untracked files are properly added.

which is actually ok since I don't think you have an HG repo and this is a temporary package for testing.  Then success:

Then applying the files is ok until

Problematic is that then it's rejected?  I guess I'll see what happens... but this error will probably need to be fixed.

1. The correct menu is much shorter in the notebook than in the application launched from the command line.  The application launched from the command line uses the default menu.  I'll look into making them match.
   1. Apply the patches in #9238 to see the updated notebook Jmol interface.
   2. The .spkg problem is odd.  I've got no errors ever.  I just use ./sage -f "<web address of patch>".
   3. The patch with the problem with the .mnu file means redoing it against a 4.6.2 that had the .mnu file in the repo.  For some reason the version I got for ubuntu 10.04 lts did not.

>  1. The correct menu is much shorter in the notebook than in the application launched from the command line.  The application launched from the command line uses the default menu.  I'll look into making them match.
  
Well, no need on this ticket!

As for this, the **first patch only** suffices to fix the command line problem, and the notebook still works right.  

So I would say that the second patch is *not* relevant to this ticket, esp. given its problems with import (which I am looking into - I think has to do with HG not applying some things correctly because of perceived line endings.  Look at the view of the attachment on this ticket, and look at the lines with `bond100` and `bond150` and note the weirdness there.  It looks like 

```
bond100 | 0.10 √Ö = wireframe .1
```
instead of angstroms like I think it's supposed to

```
bond100 | 0.10 Å = wireframe .1
```
No wonder it's not applying, since it's not being interpreted right.  Anyway, not relevant for the ticket.

>  1. Apply the patches in #9238 to see the updated notebook Jmol interface.
  
As I thought - thanks, not relevant for reviewing this.

>  2. The .spkg problem is odd.  I've got no errors ever.  I just use ./sage -f "<web address of patch>".
  
Yes, that is what should work.  Since this isn't an spkg that would actually ever exist, it's not a problem, I hope.

>  3. The patch with the problem with the .mnu file means redoing it against a 4.6.2 that had the .mnu file in the repo.  For some reason the version I got for ubuntu 10.04 lts did not.
  
See above.

I get the following issue as well.

```
rm: /Users/.../sage-4.7.alpha2-jmol/devel/sagenb/sagenb/data/jmol/LICENSE.txt: No such file or directory
```
So was there not a license before?  Apparently not - I can confirm that in an install that does not have the new Jmol.  So it's not a big deal, but at any rate you didn't have to put that in the script.

Otherwise I think this is ready to go.  It would be nice to have someone on a system where command line plotting did *not* work before to try this.  Volker, du bist ja bei Sage Days 29, oder?  Probierst du es mal aus?

Things are a little bit of a mess because of the potential for flask changeover in SageNB.  What do people think of this?
1. This ticket is used just for adding Volker's patch.  No sagenb change needed.
2. Jonathan's patches for the menu, help, and surface lighting/spt files are moved to #9238.
3. #9238 and all its attendant pieces become part of the flask notebook changeover, and henceforth the property of those doing that :)
Otherwise this has the potential to just bitrot forever.

Jonathan, definitely keep working on #9238.  Jason can just put those things in the new notebook.  Having something working completely is a very good idea, and we can continue to test it on the old notebook, which is still the current notebook, after all.

I do think we need to also add the piece of #9238 that changes the lighting.  Currently I have good lighting in the command line and bad lighting in the notebook, even without the new jmol - someone the new jmol is called from the notebook, even though I didn't install it in this version!!!  I even checked this in the advanced menu.  Mystifying. 

I'm just testing quick, and then I'll post patches.  Since they aren't mine, I feel free to give positive review.
