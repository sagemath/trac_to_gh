I was browsing the docs and noticed this example completely fills the plot black:

```
x,y = var('x,y')
f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2 - 2
implicit_plot(f, (-3, 3), (-3, 3),fill=True).show(aspect_ratio=1)
```

The docs say it should fill the region f(x)<0.

I ran into this bug and thought I would review the patch here. The patch applies cleanly to 4.8.alpha6 (I'm still waiting for 4.8.rc0 to build). Doctests on `sage/plot/contour_plot.py` pass. More importantly, I went through all the docstring examples for `implicit_plot` by hand in the notebook to make sure they look correct, and they all do so that's great!

However, when I try the following (a modification of one of the doctests):

```
sage: def mandel(n):
...       c = polygen(CDF, 'c')
...       z = 0
...       for i in range(n):
...           z = z*z + c
...       def f(x, y):
...           val = z(CDF(x, y))
...           return val.norm() - 4
...       return f
sage: implicit_plot(mandel(1), (-3, 3), (-3, 3), fill=True)
```
I get an error:

```

BFJ, I assume this means positive review apart from this error?

Huh, yeah, this definitely means 'needs work'.  Even though the functionality didn't work at all before, lambdas shouldn't break too many things, and this is a very natural change to make.    The problem is in `equify` (see the [very bottom of the file](http://hg.sagemath.org/sage-main/file/c239be1054e0/sage/plot/contour_plot.py#l748).

```
sage: c = polygen(CDF,'c')
sage: z = 0
sage: for i in range(1):
    z = z*z + c
....: 
sage: def g(x,y):
    val = z(CDF(x, y))
    return val.norm() - 4
....: 
sage: implicit_plot(g,(-3,3),(-3,3))  # looks fine, no surprise

sage: sage.plot.contour_plot.equify(g)  # no problem, so plotting should work with fill
<function <lambda> at 0x10df9d578>
sage: implicit_plot(g,(-3,3),(-3,3),fill=True) # error above
```
Got it.  The problem is 

```
f<0
```
in `region_plot`.   In the case I just did, 

```
sage: g<0
True
```
so we are now plotting `True` instead of `g`, which of course makes the error message quite understandable.

I tried a few things to see if I could fix it in a few minutes, but I think the "right" answer might be more complicated.

Unless we think we *should* just fix this and put in a warning about lambdas being broken?  Seems poor form.

The following doctest that is currently in `region_plot` has the same artefact:

```
region_plot(lambda x,y: x^2+y^2<1 or x<y, (x,-2,2), (y,-2,2))
```

I uploaded a new, new patch that only has the artefact when a python function is passed
to implicit_plot in which case the user should increase the point count appropriately. I
added a doctest to that effect as well.

With the patch applied, compare:

```
sage: x,y=var('x,y')
sage: implicit_plot(x^2+y^2-2, (x,-3,3), (y,-3,3), fill=True)
sage: g = lambda x,y: x^2+y^2-2
sage: implicit_plot(g,  (x,-3,3), (y,-3,3), fill=True)
```

> The `if options.pop('fill'):` is okay because of the `@`options decorator before `def implicit_plot(...):`


I figured, but was too rushed to check.

```
x,y = var('x,y')
f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2 - 2
implicit_plot(f, (-3, 3), (-3, 3),fill=True).show(aspect_ratio=1)
```
It works!

Let me just look at a few more things.  I think I'll want to add something to the other example you give, with the region plot lambda, so that it looks nicer in the doc.

Wow, I wasn't even done reviewing my own reviewer patch :)   I got hung up on trying to decide whether to add any more `# long time`s, but decided it wasn't worth it.

The code currently allows this.  

```
sage: f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2 - 2
sage: implicit_plot(f, (-3, 3), (-3, 3),fill='55').show(aspect_ratio=1)  # nice graph is filled

Should we maybe raise an error if this happens?  Given that one can ask for all kinds of fills in regular plots, not just `True` or `False`, perhaps this should be disallowed.
