According to the comments in the code:

---
        Compare self and right.

        If right is not a Set compare types.  If right is also a Set,
        returns comparison on the underlying objects.

---
But that is not what is currently done. In the case where 
right is not a Set (more accurately a "Set_object" that's
possibly another issue) the following is evaluated:

```
cmp(type(right), type(Set_object))
```

The correct thing would be to compare type(right) with
the type "Set_object" [which is type(self)] not the type
**of** Set_object.

Patch to follow.

This patch was still wrong, since it was backwards still.   See #9121 which is basically the same.
