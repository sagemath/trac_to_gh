Does this mean that I should be using spkg-dist to make the spkg, instead of sage -spkg?

Also, does this set things up so that changes are reflected in the running notebook server?  It seems that the spkg-dist just copies the hg repository there, but the notebook install is completely different.

No, I don't think it installs twice (you can check the files to make sure).  The setup.py develop installs under $SAGE_ROOT/devel/ and changes the site-packages folder to refer to that location.

> No, I don't think it installs twice (you can check the files to make sure).  The setup.py develop installs under $SAGE_ROOT/devel/ and changes the site-packages folder to refer to that location.

Actually, it does, but doing so is needed for the docs to show (static docs). We can make another ticket for that.

There's a problem with compiling from scratch, because `$SAGE_ROOT/devel` does not exist when `sagenb-*.spkg` is installed.  I think doing `mkdir -p` will be enough.

Can someone add a new patch to fix this?
