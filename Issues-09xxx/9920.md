In fact, I like this approach better (backup and copy), since it plays nicely with patch queues.  The merge approach messes everything up if you forgot to pop all of your patches off.

No, I don't think it installs twice (you can check the files to make sure).  The setup.py develop installs under $SAGE_ROOT/devel/ and changes the site-packages folder to refer to that location.
