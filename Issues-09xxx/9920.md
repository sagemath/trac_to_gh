Does this mean that I should be using spkg-dist to make the spkg, instead of sage -spkg?

Also, does this set things up so that changes are reflected in the running notebook server?  It seems that the spkg-dist just copies the hg repository there, but the notebook install is completely different.

In fact, I like this approach better (backup and copy), since it plays nicely with patch queues.  The merge approach messes everything up if you forgot to pop all of your patches off.

No, I don't think it installs twice (you can check the files to make sure).  The setup.py develop installs under $SAGE_ROOT/devel/ and changes the site-packages folder to refer to that location.

Actually, it does, but doing so is needed for the docs to show (static docs). We can make another ticket for that.

There's a problem with compiling from scratch, because `$SAGE_ROOT/devel` does not exist when `sagenb-*.spkg` is installed.  I think doing `mkdir -p` will be enough.

Can someone add a new patch to fix this?

Make `$SAGE_ROOT/devel` on install, if necessary.  Apply on top of package extraction patch.

I think we'll need to open a new ticket for making this link

```
ln -sf "$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sagenb-main" "$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sagenb" 
```
relative.  Otherwise, Sage won't start after I move/rename the root directory.
