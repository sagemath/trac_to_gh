I think the previous implementation features interesting properties. It provided a straightline embedding in an O(n) by O(n) grid, so in particular all the coordinates are integers. Would you still suggest to replace the code completely?

- ``barycentric`` - whether or not to use barycentric coordinates. 
```

it would be nice to also mention that setting it to ``None`` means having an embedding in a O(n)*O(n) grid with integer coordinates, as you just taught me.. Otherwise it's very unlikely people would disable a feature with no computation time to earn...nothing `:-)`

Hello !!

I noticed a typo in your patch 

```
then coordinates will bi in the grid. 
```

So I first wrote a small one to fix it, then ended up fixing one or two other docstrings, or adding to them the information you had put in the first description or ``barycentric``.. Well, if somebody can test my patch, he can set this ticket to "positive review", as yours is good to go !

Thanksssssssssssssss ! :-)

Hello,

The patch file trac_9699_4.patch includes a fix to the doctest fail. It also includes a fix to the problem having tuples and lists for the positions. Now, all of the positions are lists.

It seems I pressed submit too soon. Indeed all tests pass on the 64 bit system.

However on the 32-bit system, things seem to freeze at the following test:

```
Trying:

Expecting nothing
ok

Ugh. Once again I spoke too soon.

The real problem is just that the doctests take *much* longer after the patch than before.

On the 32 bit system it went from 243.2 s for `generic_graph.py` up to 623.8 s after the patch.

On the (much faster) 64 bit system it was 130.4 s before and 441.2 s after.

This definitely counts as a regression, and I can't let things through with so much of a slowdown.
