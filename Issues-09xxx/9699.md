What about just replacing the current code to compute barycentric coordinates, and add this information as notes in the documentation ?

Hello !!

I noticed a typo in your patch 

```
then coordinates will bi in the grid. 
```

So I first wrote a small one to fix it, then ended up fixing one or two other docstrings, or adding to them the information you had put in the first description or ``barycentric``.. Well, if somebody can test my patch, he can set this ticket to "positive review", as yours is good to go !

Thanksssssssssssssss ! :-)

It seems I pressed submit too soon. Indeed all tests pass on the 64 bit system.

However on the 32-bit system, things seem to freeze at the following test:

```
Trying:
    g = graphs.BalancedTree(Integer(3),Integer(4))###line 2658:_sage_    >>> g = graphs.BalancedTree(3,4)
Expecting nothing
ok
Trying:
    g.set_planar_positions(test=True)###line 2659:_sage_    >>> g.set_planar_positions(test=True)
Expecting:
    True
```

Ugh. Once again I spoke too soon.

The real problem is just that the doctests take *much* longer after the patch than before.

On the 32 bit system it went from 243.2 s for `generic_graph.py` up to 623.8 s after the patch.

On the (much faster) 64 bit system it was 130.4 s before and 441.2 s after.

This definitely counts as a regression, and I can't let things through with so much of a slowdown.
