Attachment [trac_9105-categories-primer-improvements-nt.2.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9105/trac_9105-categories-primer-improvements-nt.2.patch) by @nthiery created at 2010-06-07 21:44:08

The updated patch is refreshed w.t.r. 4.4.3, and rebased upon a trivial change (semirings in the list of categories) in #9056.

All test pass on massena with Sage 4.4.3 and the following patches applied:

trac_8881-functorial_constructions-nt.patch
trac_8742-lazy_format-fh.patch
trac_8742-lazy_format-review-nt.patch
trac_8930-enumerated_set_deprecate-fh.patch
8691_permutation_plainchange_tjb.patch
trac_8926_family_repr-fh.patch
trac_8902-subsets_call_fix-fh.patch
trac_8888_partition_rim-fh.patch
trac_8888_reviewer_jb.patch
trac_8811_reduced_word_of_translations-nt.patch
trac_8500_transitive_groups-final.patch
trac_8549_cycle_enumerator-nb.patch
trac_8490_square_free-vd.patch

trac_8887-typo_monoid_prod-fh.patch
trac_9106-UniqueRep_sphinx_fix-fh.patch
trac_8876-triangular_morphisms_improve-fh.patch
trac_8876-reviewer_patch-jb.patch
sage-5.0.patch
trac_9178-attrcall_hash_fix-nt.patch
gap3_interface_v4.3.3.patch
gap3_interface_patch2.patch
trac_8747-testsuite-speedup-fh.patch
trac_9056_semirings_category-nb.patch
trac_9056_semirings_category-review-nt.patch
trac_8911_categorification_crystals-as.patch
trac_9105-categories-primer-improvements-nt.patch
```

I therefore leave the positive review.
