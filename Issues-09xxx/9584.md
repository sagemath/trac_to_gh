These may be unrelated to each other, however.

''Copied from the sage-release thread (slightly beautified):

  1: `devel/sage/sage/graphs/generic_graph.py`
  
    Doesn't terminate at all(?), gets killed even if I test just that file, with `SAGE_TIMEOUT_LONG=3600` (1 hour)!

Testing with `-verbose`, I now experience the same doctest failure John [Cremona]
reported (and only that):

The following tests failed:

*[Note the real/CPU time.]*

The funny thing is that with `-verbose`, I do not even get the shell prompt back (I redirected stderr to stdout and tee'd it); `./sage -t -long ...` terminates, but I guess its now orphan child (`python /home/leif/.sage//tmp/.doctest_generic_graph.py`[sic], which is actually running - consuming CPU time, in contrast to its two `gap` children, which sleep due to blocking reads) keeps at least one of the file descriptors open...

What are the relevant tickets which were merged since 4.5.1? Looking at the list on the Roadmap, under graph theory, none of them really look like they could cause something like this...

If I try running the command last printed above on geom.math, I instantly get:

```
sage: graphs.PathGraph(Integer(6)).blocks_and_cut_vertices()

Today the doctest is passing for me.  I don't know why.  (A few days ago it failed with "make ptestlong", and then it failed repeatedly from the command line.)  If you want to try it yourself, I think my account on skynet is now readable: look in `/home/palmieri/cleo/sage-4.5.2.alpha0/`.

Not that I know of; it's also in my [first comment above](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/9584#comment:1).

Wow... ;-) (Single test? Sysload?)

```
Trying:
    arborescences = g.edge_disjoint_spanning_trees(k)###line 3429:_sage_    >>> arborescences = g.edge_disjoint_spanning_trees(k)
Expecting nothing
```

I don't think this is the point where it really starts hanging.

IMO yes; I've uploaded a patch to `ncadoctest.py` (which I think could be merged into Sage anyway, since if at all it slows down only doctesting in verbose mode).

Btw, you could look for Python and GAP orphans after the test has timed out. (GAP processes should be the children of the orphaned Python doctest process.)

Hmmmm.... :-/

Then perhaps setting the number of vertices to 20 instead of 30 ? With CPLEX as a solver, this test is actually much faster, this may be why I originally put a 30 there, which may be too big for GLPK.

```
sage:  T = lambda x: x.edge_disjoint_spanning_trees(x.edge_connectivity())
sage: %timeit T(digraphs.RandomDirectedGNP(30,.3))
5 loops, best of 3: 6.03 s per loop
```

```
sage:  T = lambda x: x.edge_disjoint_spanning_trees(x.edge_connectivity(), solver= "CPLEX")
sage: %timeit T(digraphs.RandomDirectedGNP(30,.3))
5 loops, best of 3: 668 ms per loop
```

In this case, though, we should increase the probability, lest we find non-strongly-connected graphs, but this still takes a lot of time 

```

sage:  T = lambda x: x.edge_disjoint_spanning_trees(x.edge_connectivity())
sage: %timeit T(digraphs.RandomDirectedGNP(20,.5))
5 loops, best of 3: 4.52 s per loop
```

As I still haven't found a way to write #7303, perhaps the following would be a good alternative :

We build a directed circulant graph on n vertices by linking the i th vertex to i+1, i+2, ... , i+k, thus ensuring our graph is k-connected. Then, by Edmond's theorem, we know this graph has `k` edge-disjoint spanning arborescences

```
sage: n = 20
sage: k = 3
sage: g = DiGraph()
sage: g.add_edges( (Integer(i),Integer(Mod(i+j,n))) for i in range(n) for j in range(1,k+1) )
sage: k == g.edge_connectivity()
True
sage: arborescences = g.edge_disjoint_spanning_trees(k)
sage: all([a.is_directed_acyclic() for a in arborescences])
True
sage: all([a.is_connected() for a in arborescences]) 
True
``` 

It is nicer now :

```
sage: %timeit g.edge_disjoint_spanning_trees(k)
5 loops, best of 3: 283 ms per loop
```

Plus it is a bit "cleaner" without the random graphs in this case, methinks :-)

Sorry for the trouble !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Nothing is out of my control... ;-)

I mean we should try to find the reason. If it's outside of Sage, fine, and we can at least document it, whether it lies in GLPK or some OS/compiler specifics.

And the "failing" doctest, i.e. the behavior after timing out, in addition shows (again) that something's wrong with the doctesting framework, to also be addressed on another ticket.

> So a work-around seems like an acceptable solution right now.


I'm ok with merging this work-around at this moment.

This being said, if Sage is exporting invalid linear programs, that's a very bad news, as it does it using GLPK. So if the problem stored in the file is invalid, then the problem solved by GLPK should be too, as they behave the same way : to solve it, Sage first feeds it to GLPK using method A, then calls "solve".

Well, Sage does not run `glpsol` on a generated file, but uses the library interface, so there's a slight difference, and: names are only set when calling `write_mps()` or `write_lp()` - which goes wrong somehow in at least two cases. (I'm calling both `p.write_mps()` and `p.write_lp()` right before `p.solve()` in `GenericGraph.edge_disjoint_spanning_trees()`, and afterwards run `glpsol (--freemps|--lp)` on those files.)

Indeed, though the GLPK *library* works on th 64-bit system. On the 32-bit system where the doctest did not terminate, it's actually the solver that runs "forever" (trying to find a solution) - I do not yet know why... :(

Increasing the timeout threshold just lets this continue longer.

I'm at 9500s+ and it keeps writing to the screen, though `sage -t ...` has already terminated... :D

As mentioned above, the whole test (`-long`) of `generic_graph.py` - with *in theory* **the same** LP program (30 vertices) - took 281 seconds on a much slower machine.

I still don't know if the GLPK library or the Sage interface/code that builds the LP program structure is broken on the other (very similar, btw) machine.

(I've killed the Python process running the solver after 42138+ seconds, which was still searching for a solution.)

Nathann, could you take a look at the variable name generation which causes the MPS and LP file errors? (These should be reproducible on all systems I think, at least I've met them on a 64-bit system, running Ubuntu 9.04.)
