```
sage: E = EllipticCurve('5077a')
sage: E.heegner_discriminants(100)
[-3, -4, -7, -19, -40, -47, -55, -59, -71, -79, -84, -88]
sage: P = E.heegner_point(-7)
sage: P.numerical_approx(prec=100)
(0 : 1.0000000000000000000000000000 : 0)
sage: P.point_exact(prec=100)
(0 : 2 : 1)
```

But point_exact should be the point at infinity.
