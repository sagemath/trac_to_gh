<a id='comment:2'></a>Hello,

Note that there was already an example at the end of `Integer.is_prime`:

```
sage: proof.arithmetic()
True
sage: n = 10^100 + 267
sage: timeit("n.is_prime()")  # not tested
5 loops, best of 3: 163 ms per loop
sage: proof.arithmetic(False)
sage: proof.arithmetic()
False
sage: timeit("n.is_prime()")  # not tested
1000 loops, best of 3: 573 us per loop
```
What about a similar one in `arith.is_prime`

```
sage: a = 2**2048 + 981
sage: is_prime(a)    # not tested - takes ~ 1min
sage: proof.arithmetic(False)
sage: is_prime(a)    # instantaneous!
True
sage: proof.arithmetic(True)
```
