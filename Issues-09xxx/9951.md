If it wouldn't **work**, the priority of this ticket would be *blocker* rather than *minor*. ;-)

The patch just avoids potentially annoying or confusing warning messages.
 
To see the difference, do for example:

```sh
~/Sage/sage-4.6.alpha1/devel/sage-main$ touch sage/tests/french_book/numbertheory.py 
~/Sage/sage-4.6.alpha1/devel/sage-main$ ../../sage -b
