In general, `lattice_polytope._embedding_matrix` is not orthogonal. But `facet_normal()` implicitly makes this assumption by embedding the normals (which live in the dual vector space) by the transpose of the `_embedding_matrix`. 

Here is an example of the incorrect result:

```
sage: lp = LatticePolytope(matrix([[1,1,-1,0],[1,-1,-1,0],[1,1,1,0],[3,3,3,0]]))
sage: lp.vertices()
[ 1  1 -1  0]
[ 1 -1 -1  0]
[ 1  1  1  0]
[ 3  3  3  0]
sage: lp.facet_normal(0)
(-1, 0, 1, 3)
sage: lp.vertices() * lp.facet_normal(0)
(-2, -2, 0, 0)
sage: lp.facet_constant(0)
-9
```
If `lp.facet_normal(0)` would define a facet then its equation would be satisfied at 3 out of 4 vertices. 

The attached patch fixes this issue. A scale factor for the dual embedding is introduced to keep the facet normal coordinates integral. Moreover, a suitable doctest is added.

NOTE: This bug impacts the toric variety code under development in #8986, #8987:

```
sage: c = Cone([(1,0,0,0),(0,1,0,0),(0,0,1,0)])
sage: c.faces()
((0-dimensional face of 3-dimensional cone,), (1-dimensional face of 3-dimensional cone, 1-dimensional face of 3-dimensional cone, 1-dimensional face of 3-dimensional cone), (2-dimensional face of 3-dimensional cone, 2-dimensional face of 3-dimensional cone, 2-dimensional face of 3-dimensional cone), (3-dimensional face of 3-dimensional cone,))
sage: c = Cone([(1,1,1,3),(1,-1,1,3),(-1,-1,1,3)])
sage: c.faces()
((0-dimensional face of 3-dimensional cone,), (2-dimensional face of 3-dimensional cone,), (3-dimensional face of 3-dimensional cone,))
```

OK, my patch looks big, but the only real change to the original is taking the absolute value of the dual scaling factor, so that normals remain inner.

In addition I (hopefully) made doctests more clear, since they do appear in the documentation. Polytopes are now created using coordinates of points with all the necessary transpositions after that. I also made doctest lines shorter for better looks of the documentation.

I have changed "parallel" to "orthogonal to integer kernel" in the description of normals (and now I do remember that I didn't like this "parallel" when I wrote it...).

If you are fine with all these changes, I will switch it to positive review. Thank you for catching this bug!
