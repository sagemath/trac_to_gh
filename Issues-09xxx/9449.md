The following shows a summary of a doctest failures. They were actually observed on a Solaris machine, but that is unlikely to be relevant. After building Sage

```
$ make ptestlong
```

was executed. 

* 5 of the 6 doctest failures in the summary have 0 tests failing.
* BSD.py is the only one of the 6 doctest failures which has a non-zero number of failures. 

```

The following tests failed:

    sage -t     -long devel/sage/doc/fr/tutorial/programming.rst # 0 doctests failed
    sage -t     -long devel/sage/sage/schemes/plane_curves/constructor.py # 0 doctests failed
    sage -t     -long devel/sage/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/BSD.py # 1 doctests failed
    sage -t     -long devel/sage/sage/parallel/decorate.py # 0 doctests failed
    sage -t     -long devel/sage/sage/libs/galrep/wrapper.pyx # 0 doctests failed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Total time for all tests: 3990.8 seconds 
```

In the case of one of the tests, it would appear from the log that it actually passed 

```
sage -t     -long devel/sage/sage/parallel/decorate.py
     [44.0 s] 
```

This is pretty damn serious, as it means we can not rely on the doctest results. 

 == Hardware and software used ==
* sage-4.5.alpha4
* A Sun T5240
* 2 x 8 core, 64-thread UltraSPARC T2+ 1167 MHz
* 32 GB RAM
* Solaris 10 update 7 (05/09)
* t2.math.washtington.edu
* gcc 4.4.1 configured to use both the Sun linker and assembler.
* 32-bit build (This is the default). The environment variable `SAGE64` was **not** used.

Attachment: **[ptestlong.log](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9449/ptestlong.log)**

Could you try with patches #8641, #9243, #9316 to the doctest framework? They clean up and fix parts of the error handling.

If they don't fix it yet, I can give you a patch which adds some extra debugging info to track this down.

Yes. The only problem I have is that these test failures are not always reproducible. Tests which failed when I run 

`$ make ptestlong` 

actually passed later. There's a report from John H Palmieri on sage-release of `devel/sage/sage/misc/trace.py` failing for him three times on this machine, then working. This makes any sort of testing difficult, and means it will be hard for me to know if s #8641, #9243, #9316 really solve the problem or not. But I will try them and report back later.

OK, thank you. 

I know there was a recent patch to the doctesting to remove spurious errors about files not found - #9316. I don't know if these could be related or not. 

I've got other strange results from doctests too, but I'll put that on another ticket.

Here's the results after applying #8641, #9243, #9316. As you can see, there are still tests which fail with 0 doctest failures (These results are again on the Sun T5240 t2.math.washington.edu, which is the same as before). 

```

sage -t  -long devel/sage/sage/modular/ssmod/ssmod.py
         [3001.1 s]
sage -t  -long devel/sage/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_rational_field.py
         [3137.3 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The following tests failed:

        sage -t  -long devel/sage/doc/en/constructions/number_fields.rst # 0 doctests failed
        sage -t  -long devel/sage/sage/categories/examples/hopf_algebras_with_basis.py # 0 doctests failed
        sage -t  -long devel/sage/sage/libs/galrep/wrapper.pyx # 0 doctests failed
        sage -t  -long devel/sage/sage/parallel/decorate.py # 1 doctests failed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Total time for all tests: 4264.8 seconds
```



Here's the first one, which fails, but with 0 recorded failures. 

```
sage -t  -long devel/sage/doc/en/constructions/number_fields.rst
python: can't open file '/rootpool2/local/kirkby/.sage//tmp/number_fields.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory

         [1.9 s]
```

Here's the second recorded failure 

```
sage -t  -long devel/sage/sage/categories/examples/hopf_algebras_with_basis.py
python: can't open file '/rootpool2/local/kirkby/.sage//tmp/hopf_algebras_with_basis.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory

         [1.7 s]
```

The third failure is where Sage crashed:

```
sage -t  -long devel/sage/sage/libs/galrep/wrapper.pyx


------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGBUS: A bus error occurred in Sage.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* component
of Sage has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
or is not properly wrapped with _sig_on, _sig_off.
You might want to run Sage under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
Sage will now terminate (sorry).
------------------------------------------------------------


         [21.5 s]
```

This is recorded as 0 failures, despite the fact Sage crashed. 

The only test that is recorded as a failure, with a non-zero number of failures, is the last test

The "# failures" that sage reports is calculated very simply by counting the number of instances of "Expected:" "Expected nothing" and "Exception raised:".

Sage correctly detected that things went wrong, as you can tell from the fact that the files causing errors are listed in the summary at the end.

As far as I can tell, the only thing that's not quite right is the reporting of what exactly went wrong. There's likely a better way of reporting these specific crashes and missing file errors you're getting, but I don't see any reason to believe something is as seriously wrong with the error reporting as you seem to be implying on this ticket and on the mailing list.

(Reverting priority to major.)


The file not found errors (Are you out of disk space?) should probably be caught before the doctesting process is launched in the first place. I'll have to think about the SIGBUS case some more.

<div id="comment:15" align="right">comment:15</div>

I can only tell there are indeed flaws and inconsistencies in the doctest framework (I started examining it a few days ago, made some notes, but haven't finished yet).

E.g. `sage-doctest` exit code 1 can either mean "file not found", a command line syntax error or even a keyboard interrupt.
I don't understand why `sage-test` and `sage-ptest` are separated, though they contain common code that might get (or yet is) out of sync.
Different scripts use different temporary directories...
Some `make` targets for testing do `./sage -b`, others do not...

Just to name a few; I'll continue to investigate the bunch of involved scripts further, but don't really know how soon.

I don't know if *this* one is the origin, but it's simply **horrible**:

```python
def test_file(F):
    """
    This is the function that actually tests a file
    """
    outfile = tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile()
    base, ext = os.path.splitext(F)

    cmd = 'doctest ' + opts
    if SAGE_SITE in os.path.realpath(F) and not '-force_lib' in cmd:
        cmd += ' -force_lib'

    filestr = os.path.split(F)[1]
    for i in range(0,numiteration):
        os.chdir(os.path.dirname(F))
        command = os.path.join(SAGE_ROOT, 'local', 'bin', 'sage-%s' % cmd)
        s = 'bash -c "%s %s > %s" ' % (command, filestr, outfile.name)
        try:
            t = time.time()
            ret = os.system(s)
            finished_time = time.time() - t
            if ret>=256:
                ret=ret/256
            ret = -ret
        except:
            ol = outfile.read()
            return (-5, 0, ol)
        ol = outfile.read()
        if ret != 0:
            break
    return (F, ret, finished_time, ol)
```

Beat me if I've missed something here...

I barely know Python, so there is nothing I can do about this. But if you have a better solution, it would be worth trying it. I feel a bit uneasy about Sage, when we can't trust the mechanism for testing it. 

It's odd why failures on some test is pretty repeatable when running `make ptestlong` but run individually, they pass. I'm pretty sure that is not a memory issue, as I've noticed that on my Sun Blade 2000 SPARC where I'm the only user. That machine has 8 GB RAM and only two processors (its not multi-cored or multi-threaded), so I don't run more than 3 tests in parallel.

I've opened #9895 for the recurring "Not enough space" error on Solaris raised by `os.fork` in `sage/parallel/decorate.py`.

Since #12415 completely rewrites the doctest framework with much better code, I'm assuming this problem is fixed.
