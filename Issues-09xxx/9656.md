This fixes the kerning issue but degrades the appearance of code blocks.  Now code examples do not have a white background but do have a little bit of white at the ends of each line, which I think definitely looks worse.  I am not well enough versed in html and css to figure out how to fix this.

I am attaching some screenshots to make this clearer.

I haven't seen this in a while, but I'm not sure if it could still happen with MathJax.

Current code, however in roughly the same place and same file

```
 // Call MathJax on the final output.
if (status === 'd' ) {
try {
MathJax.Hub.Queue(["Typeset",MathJax.Hub,cell_output]);
} catch (e) {
cell_output.innerHTML = 'Error typesetting mathematics' + cell_output.innerHTML;
cell_output_nowrap.innerHTML = 'Error typesetting mathematics' +
cell_output_nowrap.innerHTML;
}
}

Just for reference, many of the sagenb tickets on Trac were mentioned upstream as cross-links; apparently this one (?) was missed.  The rationale was that for any other upstream project (e.g. Maxima), we'd want a ticket on Trac to confirm it.
