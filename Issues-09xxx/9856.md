Yann, please could you provide a description saying in what sense you did "improve"
augment, maybe with an example? Is that an improvement in functionality or speed?

It's a speed improvement. Here's the example:

```
sage: m = identity_matrix(QQ, 1000, sparse=True)
sage: timeit('m.augment(m)')
```

BEFORE

```
5 loops, best of 3: 368 ms per loop
```
AFTER

```
625 loops, best of 3: 1.2 ms per loop
```

And we are not loosing anything for small cases:

```
sage: m = identity_matrix(QQ, 5, sparse=True)  
sage: timeit('m.augment(m)')
```

BEFORE

```
625 loops, best of 3: 198 µs per loop
```
AFTER

```
625 loops, best of 3: 197 µs per loop
```

<div id="comment:4" align="right">Comment 4</div>

A small typo in the code: "number of columns must be the same" should be
"number of rows must be the same". I confirm the great speed improvement.
Once the typo is fixed, I will check the doctests still pass.
