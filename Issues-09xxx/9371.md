The function E.two_torsion_rank() can easily be made to work over number fields. The current implementation over QQ calls E.torsion_subgroup() and makes nontrivial use of Mazur's torsion theorem. This should be more efficient and more general by considering the 2-division polynomial.

Looks good: a better method and more general.   However:  why not move the function all the way up to ell_field?  There's no reason at all why the same code would not work over any field of char. not 2, and even in char. 2 (where the result is at most 0 or 1 for supersingular/ordinary curves, but so what).

If you do that, add extra doctests over (say) finite fields.
While you are at it, one thing about the docstring could be improved:  the short description should fit on one line, so cut it after E(K), and put the rest into a separate ALGORITHM block.
 
"Needs work" sounds negative, so let me elaborate: this is good and with a tiny amount of work would be very good!
