PyWavelets is a Python wavelet transforms module that can do:

* 1D and 2D Forward and Inverse Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT and IDWT)
* 1D and 2D Stationary Wavelet Transform (Undecimated Wavelet Transform)
* 1D and 2D Wavelet Packet decomposition and reconstruction
* Computing Approximations of wavelet and scaling functions
* Over seventy built-in wavelet filters and support for custom wavelets
* Single and double precision calculations
* Results compatibility with Matlab Wavelet Toolbox (tm)
