In `/rootpool2/local/kirkby/sage-4.5.alpha1` on t2:

```sh
$ tail spkg/logs/rubiks-20070912.p11.log

Now cleaning up tmp files.

Making Sage/Python scripts relocatable...
Making script relocatable
Finished installing rubiks-20070912.p11.spkg
```
This leaves an empty directory `SAGE_ROOT/spkg/build/rubiks-20070912.p11`.

It seems the problem is

```sh
rm -rf "$SAGE_PACKAGES/build/$PKG_NAME"
```
near the end of `SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage-spkg`.  What if we precede this with `cd ..`, say?

I think that this message only appears on Solaris; at least, that's been my experience.  On sage.math, for example, I can do this:

```
$ cd /scratch/palmieri
$ mkdir TEMP
$ cd TEMP
$ rm -rf /scratch/palmieri/TEMP
```
but doing this on t2.math results in an error:

```
rm: Cannot remove any directory in the path of the current working directory
```
So if it ever relied on this behavior, it didn't rely on it on sage.math.  (All of the linux machines I've used, and also Mac OS X, behave like sage.math in this regard.)

I'm trying a build on sage.math with this patch, and I'll try it on t2 later.

<div id="comment:5" align="right">Comment 5</div>

I'm ok with the patch, though we could replicate

```sh
   # Make triply sure that we are in the build directory before doing 
    # a scary "rm -rf".
    cd "$SAGE_PACKAGES/build"
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
        echo "Unable to find build directory."
    else
        rm -rf "$PKG_BASE-"*
    fi
```
which is what is done some lines above.

There are many other things to fix or improve in `sage-spkg`, but I'll leave those for further tickets (something like work in progress) since hopefully this one gets merged soon.

If anyone feels Mitesh's solution is not sufficient, feel free to revert it to "needs review" or "needs work".
