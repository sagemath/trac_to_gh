Applying full_simplify() to the gamma function sometimes causes an error.  This example works:

```
sage: gamma(4/3).full_simplify()
1/3*gamma(1/3)
```

but this example does not:

```
sage: gamma(1/3).full_simplify()

The error message is: ('EOF in multi-line statement', (1254, 0))

I am running Sage 4.4.1 on Mac OS X version 10.6 (Snow Leopard), built from source. But the second example also fails on Sage 4.3.5 on 64-bit Linux, built from source. Looking at the source code suggests that the second example will fail on all platforms.

The problem occurs because full_simplify() here runs the following commands in Maxima:

```
(%i1) minfactorial(factcomb(makefact(gamma(1/3))));
                                       2
(%o1)                               (- -)!
                                       3
```

and then the Maxima interface converts this to Sage as factorial(-2/3).  This causes an error.  For Sage, factorial(x) is only defined if x is a non-negative integer, whereas for Maxima factorial(x) is equivalent to gamma(1+x) and so makes sense whenever x is not in {-1, -2, -3, ...}

The patch applies cleanly to 4.4.4.alpha0, fixes the problem and includes some nice tests. I would give this a positive review, except that I really don't know the Pynac integration code. 

Oh, and you say "For Sage, factorial(x) is only defined if x is a non-negative integer", but (with a clean 4.4.4.alpha0), it's defined the same way as Maxima:

```
sage: factorial(5)
120
sage: factorial(1/2)
1/2*sqrt(pi)
sage: factorial(1/21)
gamma(22/21)
```

OK: I had misunderstood the docstring, which says:

```
sage: ? factorial

String Form:    factorial
Namespace:      Interactive
File:           /Users/tomc/sage-4.4.1/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/functions/other.py

Docstring:
       Returns the factorial of n.
    
       INPUT:
    
       * ``n`` - an integer, or symbolic expression
...
```

I suppose that non-integer numerical values (rational numbers, real numbers, etc) count as symbolic expressions here, as they can be canonically coerced into the symbolic ring.  But then there is definitely a bug in factorial(), because [in an unpatched version of Sage]:

```
sage: factorial(-1/2)
ERROR: An unexpected error occurred while tokenizing input
...
ValueError: factorial -- must be nonnegative

Well I am not sure because I don't know the code well. But python_func is an unsigned and used to be a boolean according to comment in the code.
What I think happens here is the code tries to match a precise type of python_func.
0 is just a c++ function but different from 0 it is a python construct and it can take different value depending on the construct. So if I am not mistaken it is bitwise because we are trying to match the construct code. This can be seen in the follwing snippet from function.cpp

```

}

{
        python_func |= evalf_python_f;
        evalf_f = evalf_funcp(ef);
        return *this;
}
function_options& function_options::conjugate_func(PyObject* c)
{
        python_func |= conjugate_python_f;
        conjugate_f = conjugate_funcp(c);

}

{
        python_func |= real_part_python_f;
        real_part_f = real_part_funcp(c);
        return *this;
}
function_options& function_options::imag_part_func(PyObject* c)
{
        python_func |= imag_part_python_f;
        imag_part_f = imag_part_funcp(c);
        return *this;
}

function_options& function_options::derivative_func(PyObject* d)
{
        python_func |= derivative_python_f;
        derivative_f = derivative_funcp(d);
        return *this;
}
function_options& function_options::power_func(PyObject* d)

        power_f = power_funcp(d);

I don't think they are big deals, but I don't feel comfortable giving positive review without knowing them.  Someone else who knows more might!\n\n* why the change from the 'billions of digits' error message to the symbolic answer?  This seems like a big change - someone might rely on that type of entry failing in number theory.  Note that the multifactorial still has the 'billions of digits' error message, incidentally.\n* what would the problem be if Ginac got symbolic answers back, if it didn't have anything for those before?  (Not criticizing, just not understanding.  I don't have a problem with them being numeric for ints and floats and longs.)\n* Why did you remove `opt.set_python_func() `?  I assume this has something to do with fbissey's comment.\n* Does `        return None ` just mean that Ginac will not try to evaluate things like `factorial(sqrt(2))` internally?\n\n---\n\nStatus:\n* Positive review on Tom's patch, from Dan Drake.\n* The log gamma stuff is fine.\n* Apparently Francois is happy with the && to & switch.  This is beyond me, though I don't see any problems with it.\n* The actual changes to and new factorial and gamma functions are fine.\n* Need answer to questions, or someone else to review those pieces in lieu of that.\n* Finally, the big question - WHY this change?  I can't find a single doctest that tells me what broke with Tom's patch but without Burcin's patch.  I feel there must be some very subtle Maxima output that could have come out incorrect, but I cannot find it.  All these doctests should have worked before (or were cdef functions so they couldn't be doctested).",

I am going to have to write down **exactly** how all this works at Sage Days 31, because I do not want to be rediscovering this from scratch every time like I am now.

I have some more questions, presumably for Burcin.   I don't think they are big deals, but I don't feel comfortable giving positive review without knowing them.  Someone else who knows more might!

* why the change from the 'billions of digits' error message to the symbolic answer?  This seems like a big change - someone might rely on that type of entry failing in number theory.  Note that the multifactorial still has the 'billions of digits' error message, incidentally.
* what would the problem be if Ginac got symbolic answers back, if it didn't have anything for those before?  (Not criticizing, just not understanding.  I don't have a problem with them being numeric for ints and floats and longs.)
* Why did you remove `opt.set_python_func() `?  I assume this has something to do with fbissey's comment.
* Does `        return None ` just mean that Ginac will not try to evaluate things like `factorial(sqrt(2))` internally?

---

Status:
* Positive review on Tom's patch, from Dan Drake.
* The log gamma stuff is fine.
* Apparently Francois is happy with the && to & switch.  This is beyond me, though I don't see any problems with it.
* The actual changes to and new factorial and gamma functions are fine.
* Need answer to questions, or someone else to review those pieces in lieu of that.
* Finally, the big question - WHY this change?  I can't find a single doctest that tells me what broke with Tom's patch but without Burcin's patch.  I feel there must be some very subtle Maxima output that could have come out incorrect, but I cannot find it.  All these doctests should have worked before (or were cdef functions so they couldn't be doctested).

Francois is right. The `python_func` variable is a bitset, indexed by the values here:

https://bitbucket.org/burcin/pynac/src/687b580c8c7c/ginac/function.h#cl-240

If the corresponding bit is on, then we call a python function.

When I first implemented this, defining custom evaluation etc. methods in Python was an all or nothing matter. Then I realized that overriding some of these methods and using the others defined in C++ made sense. I switched to the bitset at that point. As the change with `&` and `&&` shows, that switch wasn't very successful.

Maybe we can add some documentation to the reference manual about the general design of symbolics and in particular how the functions work.

The number theory people should use the functions from `sage.rings.arith`. In general, it's a bad idea to use the symbolics functions in library code unless you know what you're doing.

Suppose you have the expression `factorial(big_number+1)/factorial(big_number)`. This would simplify to `big_number`. Telling people that they can't possibly work with numbers that big defeats the purpose of *symbolic computation*.

Yes. It's quite likely that this is not documented anywhere. :)

Okay, I finally understand what is going on here.  I couldn't implement it myself, but it's just a [really space-saving way](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stl/bitset/) to keep track of booleans like this.  So it's just the way we tell Ginac that a custom `_eval_` method or whatever has been defined.  Good.

Absolutely - witness for instance #11143 where a new-ish developer has been stymied by this, though hopefully I was able to explain at least some of it to him.

> The number theory people should use the functions from `sage.rings.arith`. In general, it's a bad idea to use the symbolics functions in library code unless you know what you're doing.

Yes, I agree, but sometimes the order of imports makes it hard to know which one is top-level.

Good point!

A good project as well.

So you are saying this was just an overhaul, but there is no specific error we know of that the rest fixed, it was just needed.  

Good enough for me!  Positive review.  Long doctests finished passing late last night :)
