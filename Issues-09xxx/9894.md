Version 2.1.2 of the modular group cohomology package is now available. There is extensive [documentation](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/SimonKing/Cohomology/index.html). The package needs the Small Groups library (available in the gap-packages spkg) and can be installed with `sage -i http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/SimonKing/Cohomology/p_group_cohomology-2.1.2.spkg`

Most importantly: The version 2.0, that is the current "official" version of the optional package, would not work with the current version of Sage. So, there has to be an upgrade of the spkg.

Moreover, it has new features.

**__New Features__**

**1. Improved code quality**

  - IIRC, one of the referee's complaint on earlier versions of the package was that the !__init!__.py file actually contains code, rather than just importing things. So, I made a new module "factory.py". Now, the !__init!__.py only contains documentation and import statements.

  - Moreover, I split the !__call!__ method of the cohomology ring constructor into smaller units.

  - Virtually all computations with this package require creating certain data files on disk. However, the data that are shipped by the package are installed in SAGE_DATA. So, if a user has no write access in that folder, he can read from the database, but can not add further computations to it. In previous versions, it meant that the user had to create his/her own database *from scratch*. This is solved in version 2.1.1: Still, the user will create his/her own database, but this database can make full use of the stuff that already is in SAGE_DATA.

  - Typically one has methods whose result can be cached and needs only be re-computed if the ring approximation changes; this is now being taken care of by decorators.

  - I tried to reduce compiler warnings.

  - Using the package, several bugs in Singular and GAP have been uncovered. The new Singular version 3-1-1 fixes some bugs, so that in some cases more efficient methods can be used. The package tests the available Singular version; it both supports the new features and is able to work around the old Singular bugs.

  - We finally achieved **100% doctest coverage!! **

  - By oversight, the old test script failed to execute the tests of special methods (such as `_add_` or `_mul_`. The new script now captures all tests, and complains if a class, method or function does not appear to be tested. Also, the test script does parallel tests.

  - The parallel testscript uncovered a problem with temporary files associated with Sage's pexpect interfaces -- see #10004. The testscript tests if the problem reported at #10004 is fixed, and will only do parallel testing if it is fixed.

**2. Extended computational capability**

  - The completeness criteria are further improved. We use three criteria, namely the modified Benson criterion (found by David Green and myself), the Symonds criterion and the Hilbert-Poincar√© criterion (suggested by Peter Symonds and worked out by myself). Due to new methods of constructing parameters, the Symonds criterion is now often the best choice - but not always, so that it is good to have three methods to choose from.

  - New functionality includes the computation of preimages of induced homomorphisms, essential ideals and depth essential ideals. Using the package, a new example of a group was found for which the square of the essential ideal does not vanish (this is only the second known example!). So far, a conjecture of Jon Carlson on depth essential ideals can be confirmed.

**3. Portability **

The package fully works on t2! This is a very non-trivial achievement. It involved:
* Changing the names of several functions from `C-MeatAxe`, since the Sun linker seems to confuse them with functions from pari. This is a problem similar to the one found at #1396.
* t2 is a big-endian machine. GAP's random generator depends on the endianness (which is a bug). Certain internal data used by the cohomology computations are obtained by randomised algorithms of GAP. The ring presentation found for the cohomology ring depends on these internal data. So, in order to get machine independent computationally well defined results, special care was needed, as discussed on [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/623f7291ab7e782e)

**__Testing__**

As usual, if the environment variable `SAGE_CHECK` is exported and has the value `yes`, the test script is automatically executed and the result saved in `SAGE_ROOT/install.log`.

The script tests parallely. By default, the number of threads is one third of the number of available CPUs. This can be overruled by exporting the environment variable `SAGE_NUMBER_THREADS`.

However, problems with parallel testing in Version 2.1 revealed a problem with Sage's `pexpect` interfaces: *All* interfaces (e.g., GAP and Singular) and all parallel branches use a single temporary file for passing long commands. A solution is at #10004. The test script of the cohomology spkg will only do parallel testing if gap and singular use different temporary files.


I successfully installed and tested the package on the following machines and the following versions of Sage and Singular:
* t2.math, Sage 4.5.1, Singular 3-1-1
* bsd.math, Sage 4.5.2, Singular 3-1-0, both in 64 and 32 bit mode
* sage.math, Sage 4.5.1, Singular 3-1-0
* x86_64 GNU/Linux, Intel Core2 CPU 6700 @ 2.66GHz, Sage 4.5.2, Singular 3-1-1 -- *without* write permission in SAGE_DATA.

On another GNU Linux machine with AMD processors, it builds and seems to work even with Sage 4.2.1, but apparently the interface to the `@`parallel decorator has changed, so that I was not able to run the test script.

Hi!

Thank you for testing!

I found this error particularly interesting, at the very end of the file

```
    sage: H.sylow_cohomology().Dickson
Expected:
    ['-b_2_0^6 - b_2_2^6 - b_2_2^2*b_4_6^2 + b_2_2^3*c_6_11 + b_4_6^3', None]
Got:
    ['b_4_6^3-b_2_2^2*b_4_6^2-b_2_2^6-b_2_0^6+b_2_2^3*c_6_11', None]
```

What you got is, as much as I see, the result that you would get when computing `H.sylow_cohomology()` from scratch. But in fact it is expected that `H.sylow_cohomology()` is automatically downloaded from a web repository, containing cohomology rings that were computed with an old version of the package and thus have equivalent data (note that the polynomials above are equal) presented in a different form.

Could it be that you worked without internet connection? At least, it would explain that particular error.

Often there is a "list index out of range" in `MODCOHO.find_relations`. This one is a bit obscure to me at the moment. Can you try one of these examples manually and post the full traceback?

There is one error in "BarCode.show"; I have seen this on OS X before, but this seems to be a problem with "show" on OS X in general. 

Could you please post the *entire* log? It seems that you cut off too much. E.g., I can not see how `COCH.massey_power` fails.

Best regards,

Simon

Hi!

It seems that there is a problem I hadn't thought of: If one has used the spkg before, then data are accumulated that are later used when doing related computations. Of course, I *did* use the package before. Now, when testing, it can happen that the old results (potentially obtained with an old program version) are used and spoil the tests.

So, @kcrisman, this might be another explanation for the "particularly interesting" failure: There are old data on my computer, and I accidentally used the old data in the tests.

I have to think how to solve that problem. Certainly the tests should work both with and without having old data in the system. I did try to write the tests so that the computations are either done from scratch or use data that I have full control of, but it seems that I missed some exceptions.

Bets regards,
Simon

    "body": "<a id='comment:4'>Comment 4:</a>\nI did `./sage -ba` to get rid of the erroneous errors (that would include the file you refer to).  I'll upload an updated version of that part of the log.

I did `./sage -ba` to get rid of the erroneous errors (that would include the file you refer to).  I'll upload an updated version of that part of the log.

Thank you! I'll see if I can somehow replicate the error.

Does the error also occur if you do

```

However, there are only two tests for which the internet accessibility should really make a difference: There, `CohomologyRing.web_db(...)` is explicitly called.

When doing `CohomologyRing(...)` or `CohomologyRing.user_db(...)`, it is tried to download the result from the web repository (unless requested otherwise by the optional argument `websource=False`), and if this fails, the computation is simply started from scratch, without raising an error.

I am now trying to change the tests so that they will work both with or without old data being present.

Replying to [@kcrisman](#comment%3A4):
> Finally, here is one of the typical failures replicated.  I can check some other stuff (possibly not until rather later, though) if you give very explicit instructions as to what commands to run.

There are various lists occuring inside `find_relations`. There is also some Singular commands used to determine coefficients of lists, so, the error could be there as well.

Since I can not replicate it on my computer, can you please do/answer the following?

What version of Sage are you using? What version of Singular is it?

Remove your "private cohomology database" in order to be sure that there is no debris left. You will probably not mind to do it by `rm -r ~/.sage/pGroupCohomology/db/*` (or you can move the contents of the folder to a backup location). The folder itself must be present, though.

Do the following in Sage:

```
sage: from pGroupCohomology import CohomologyRing, _cache
sage: G = gap('AlternatingGroup(8)')
sage: H = CohomologyRing(G,prime=2,GroupName='A8')
sage: for X in _cache.values():
....:     print X.autosave_name(), X.completed
....:
```

This should give something like

```
/home/king/.sage/pGroupCohomology/db/H6gp1mod2.sobj True
/home/king/SAGE/sage-4.4.2/data/pGroupCohomology/8gp3/H8gp3.sobj True
/home/king/SAGE/sage-4.4.2/data/pGroupCohomology/32gp49/H32gp49.sobj True
/home/king/.sage/pGroupCohomology/db/H192gp1493mod2.sobj True
/home/king/SAGE/sage-4.4.2/data/pGroupCohomology/32gp27/H32gp27.sobj True
/home/king/SAGE/sage-4.4.2/data/pGroupCohomology/2gp1/H2gp1.sobj True
/home/king/SAGE/sage-4.4.2/data/pGroupCohomology/64gp138/H64gp138.sobj True
/home/king/.sage/pGroupCohomology/db/HA8mod2.sobj False
/home/king/SAGE/sage-4.4.2/data/pGroupCohomology/16gp14/H16gp14.sobj True
/home/king/SAGE/sage-4.4.2/data/pGroupCohomology/8gp5/H8gp5.sobj True
```
These are all cohomology rings that one needs to know in order to compute `H`. But since the construction of `H` fails for you, the list might be different, and at least the `.../HA8mod2.sobj` should be missing.

You see that the cohomology rings of prime power groups are in the public database `SAGE_ROOT/data/...`, whereas the non prime power groups are in your private database `~/.sage/...`.

Do you get a `False` after a prime power group in the above list?

According to the traceback you got, I expect that you have a `False` after `H192gp1493mod2.sobj`. Can you please post (or send me by e-mail) all files from the above list which are followed by `False`? Then I can do further debugging with them.

Best regards,

Simon

Perhaps I found the solution: In `find_relations` (and various other places), I parsed an ideal M in Singular into a list of strings as follows:

```
singular.eval('print(%s)'%M.name()).split(',\n')
```

I guess that `split(',\n')` is a mistake: There are systems (including OS X?) on which '\n' is not the line break character. So, I should better do

```
[t.strip() for t in singular.eval('print(%s)'%M.name()).split(',')]
```

I am now preparing and testing an updated version. So, until later...

Best regards,

Simon

Hi!

I updated the package, changing the tests so that they should work with or without old data being present, and changing the code so that it is not expected that '\n' is the newline character.

I tested it on the desktop computer in my office and am currently running tests on bsd.math, t2.math and sage.math.

So, it is ready for review again.

If you want to re-install and test the package, please don't forget to delete the copy of the *old* package version, for otherwise the new version would not be downloaded. Hence,

```
rm $SAGE_ROOT/spkg/optional/p_group_cohomology-2.1.spkg
sage -f http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/SimonKing/Cohomology/p_group_cohomology-2.1.spkg
```
Testing with

```
export SAGE_CHECK=yes
```
Bounding the number of parallel tests with, e.g.

```
export SAGE_NUMBER_THREADS=2
```

Cheers,

Simon

But it's strange: *All* errors come from GAP, and they are like

```
TypeError: Error evaluating $sage81:=IsBoundGlobal("exportMTXLIB");; in Gap
```
or

```
 TypeError: Error evaluating $sage24:="DihedralB";; in Gap
```

Of course, both commands are supposed to work! I could imagine that it is a parallelisation problem. The errors occurred with `SAGE_NUMBER_THREADS=8`. I am now seeing if it works with `SAGE_NUMBER_THREADS=4`.

Cool documentation of what is going on!   I removed the db stuff (but not the folder) again, and got this before the same error (I assume that up to here it is the same for you):

Hi!

Replying to [@kcrisman](#comment%3A19):
>   > ...
>   > Determining decomposable subspace
>   > Extracting decomposable cocycles and relations

Yep. That confirms my conjecture. Right after that line of protocol, there is a line containing a `split` statement, and IIRC it originally was

```
SelfValues = singular.eval('print(%s)'%DG.name()).split(',\n')
```

In the current version, it is

```
SelfValues = [t.strip() for t in singular.eval('print(%s)'%DG.name()).split(',')]
```
instead.

Could you test the following, please:

```
sage: R = singular.ring(0,'(x,y)','dp')
sage: I = singular.maxideal(3)
sage: singular.eval('print(%s)'%I.name()).split(',\n')
['y^3', 'x*y^2', 'x^2*y', 'x^3']
sage: [t.strip() for t in singular.eval('print(%s)'%I.name()).split(',')]
['y^3', 'x*y^2', 'x^2*y', 'x^3']
```
I reckon that on your computer the two lists are different.

Cheers,

Simon

OK, my machine has 2 GB. But actually keeping the memory consumption low was a driving force behind many things that I did for the first version of the package. As a result, the cohomology for most (but not all) groups of order 128 can be computed with 2 GB.

But I think I should put "find smaller test cases" on my to-do list for version 2.2.

What a pity! But thanks for your effort!

I wonder if this will be possible. As it is, the package is very much addressed to algebra, and I don't see how this could be changed.

There is extensive [documentation](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/SimonKing/Cohomology/index.html).

There is extensive [documentation](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/SimonKing/Cohomology/index.html). The package needs the Small Groups library (available in the gap-packages spkg) and can be installed with `sage -i http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/SimonKing/Cohomology/p_group_cohomology-2.1.1.spkg`\n \n \n **__New Features__**\n \n-1. I tried to improve the code quality. For example:\n+**1. Improved code quality**\n \n-   - Typically one has methods whose result can be cached and needs only be re-computed if the ring approximation changes; this is now being taken care of by decorators.\n-   - I tried to reduce compiler warnings.\n-   - Using the package, several bugs in Singular and GAP have been uncovered. The new Singular version 3-1-1 fixes some bugs, so that in some cases more efficient methods can be used. The package tests the available Singular version; it both supports the new features and is able to work around the old Singular bugs.\n+  - IIRC, one of the referee's complaint on earlier versions of the package was that the !__init!__.py file actually contains code, rather than just importing things. So, I made a new module \"factory.py\". Now, the !__init!__.py only contains documentation and import statements.\n \n-2. The completeness criteria are further improved. We use three criteria, namely the modified Benson criterion (found by David Green and myself), the Symonds criterion and the Hilbert-Poincar\u00e9 criterion (suggested by Peter Symonds and worked out by myself). Due to new methods of constructing parameters, the Symonds criterion is now often the best choice - but not always, so that it is good to have three methods to choose from.\n+  - Moreover, I split the !__call!__ method of the cohomology ring constructor into smaller units.\n \n-3. New functionality includes the computation of preimages of induced homomorphisms, essential ideals and depth essential ideals. Using the package, a new example of a group was found for which the square of the essential ideal does not vanish (this is only the second known example!). So far, a conjecture of Jon Carlson on depth essential ideals can be confirmed.\n+  - Virtually all computations with this package require creating certain data files on disk. However, the data that are shipped by the package are installed in SAGE_DATA. So, if a user has no write access in that folder, he can read from the database, but can not add further computations to it. In previous versions, it meant that the user had to create his/her own database *from scratch*. This is solved in version 2.1.1: Still, the user will create his/her own database, but this database can make full use of the stuff that already is in SAGE_DATA.\n \n-4. **It works on t2!! ** This is a very non-trivial achievement. It involved:\n-   * Changing the names of several functions from `C-MeatAxe`, since the Sun linker seems to confuse them with functions from pari. This is a problem similar to the one found at #1396.\n-   * t2 is a big-endian machine. GAP's random generator depends on the endianness (which is a bug). Certain internal data used by the cohomology computations are obtained by randomised algorithms of GAP. The ring presentation found for the cohomology ring depends on these internal data.

+Version 2.1.1 of the modular group cohomology package is now available. There is extensive [documentation](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/SimonKing/Cohomology/index.html). The package needs the Small Groups library (available in the gap-packages spkg) and can be installed with `sage -i http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/SimonKing/Cohomology/p_group_cohomology-2.1.1.spkg`
 
 
 **__New Features__**
 
-1. I tried to improve the code quality. For example:
+**1. Improved code quality**
 
-   - Typically one has methods whose result can be cached and needs only be re-computed if the ring approximation changes; this is now being taken care of by decorators.
-   - I tried to reduce compiler warnings.
-   - Using the package, several bugs in Singular and GAP have been uncovered. The new Singular version 3-1-1 fixes some bugs, so that in some cases more efficient methods can be used. The package tests the available Singular version; it both supports the new features and is able to work around the old Singular bugs.
+  - IIRC, one of the referee's complaint on earlier versions of the package was that the !__init!__.py file actually contains code, rather than just importing things. So, I made a new module "factory.py". Now, the !__init!__.py only contains documentation and import statements.
 
-2. The completeness criteria are further improved. We use three criteria, namely the modified Benson criterion (found by David Green and myself), the Symonds criterion and the Hilbert-Poincar√© criterion (suggested by Peter Symonds and worked out by myself). Due to new methods of constructing parameters, the Symonds criterion is now often the best choice - but not always, so that it is good to have three methods to choose from.
+  - Moreover, I split the !__call!__ method of the cohomology ring constructor into smaller units.
 
-3. New functionality includes the computation of preimages of induced homomorphisms, essential ideals and depth essential ideals. Using the package, a new example of a group was found for which the square of the essential ideal does not vanish (this is only the second known example!). So far, a conjecture of Jon Carlson on depth essential ideals can be confirmed.
+  - Virtually all computations with this package require creating certain data files on disk. However, the data that are shipped by the package are installed in SAGE_DATA. So, if a user has no write access in that folder, he can read from the database, but can not add further computations to it. In previous versions, it meant that the user had to create his/her own database *from scratch*. This is solved in version 2.1.1: Still, the user will create his/her own database, but this database can make full use of the stuff that already is in SAGE_DATA.
 
-4. **It works on t2!! ** This is a very non-trivial achievement. It involved:
-   * Changing the names of several functions from `C-MeatAxe`, since the Sun linker seems to confuse them with functions from pari. This is a problem similar to the one found at #1396.
-   * t2 is a big-endian machine. GAP's random generator depends on the endianness (which is a bug). Certain internal data used by the cohomology computations are obtained by randomised algorithms of GAP. The ring presentation found for the cohomology ring depends on these internal data.

I think the guide line are the new features, which are (according to the project home page):

* v2.1.1: Usage of symbolic links to the public database, so that one can use (but of course not install) this package even without write permission in SAGE_DATA. Restructuring the code. Parallel testing is now only permitted if ticket #10004 is applied (September 2010).
* v2.1: Support for big endian machines. 100% doctest coverage, parallel testing. New: Essential and depth essential ideals. Improved completion tests. (September 2010).

In other words, it would be good if someone who is not author (i.e., not I) does parallel tests on a machine like T2 (which is big endian), in the following setting: The package is installed by someone with write permission in SAGE_DATA, but tested by someone *without* write permission in SAGE_DATA.

And from the mathematical point of view, one might look at essential and depth essential ideals.

I did it like that: I installed Sage plus the database_gap package plus the cohomology package as root, and then I did computations in my usual account.

Another possibility: Install the package in the usual way, but then change the permissions (recursively, of course) for SAGE_DATA, so that you have read but not write permission - then you should still be able to use the package.

It is rather unfortunate to have failures. I hope that I will have time to fix them -- I am already in the middle of the next project.

I guess if there are failures on three different machines then you don't need to wait for mark.

One question: Most of the errors look like

```
    sig_on_count()
Expected:
    0
Got:
    15
```

What does that sig_on_count() mean? Does that mean that I forgot `_sig_off` after `_sig_on`?

I have no idea, but it sounds like a good guess to me.

__Speed__

I will use the occasion to slightly modify the `MeatAxe` sources (they already *are* modified compared with release 2.2.4):

`MeatAxe` uses plain loops to initialise memory. Actually, Michael Ringe did replace memset by such loops, in Revision 2.7. However, he does not explain why he did so.

Since most compilers should be pretty well in optimising memset (or calloc), I re-introduce the usage of memset and also of calloc. With that change, the multiplication time for two 2000x2000 matrices over GF(125) drops from 15 seconds (which already beats the default `Matrix_modn_dense` in Sage by a loooooong way!) to less than 12 seconds on my machine.

In other words, the cohomology computations should now generally be a bit faster.

__`_sig_on/_sig_off`__

Concerning sig_on_count: It is really a nice feature that the balance of _sig_on/_sig_off is automatically tested since sage-4.7.1! I went through the sources, and indeed it seems that there can be situations where an error is raised between _sig_on/_sig_off (which must be avoided).

__The other doctest failures__

- The test `pGroupCohomology.factory.CohomologyRingFactory.get_public_db` verifies that by default the public cohomology data base is in `SAGE_DATA`. Apparently that is not the case for John's Sage installations, and thus I'll remove that test.

- There is one test where non-filter-regular but algebraically independent parameters are not found in the degrees that are expected according to the doc tests. That is because algebraically *dependent* parameters can be found with a smaller degree sum. Hence, the completion test of Peter Symonds is used, and the program does not bother to try and find the smallest possible independent parameters. So, that test has to change.

I am now preparing an update of the package and test it against sage-4.7.1.rc2. Until that's done, the ticket should be "needs work".

I am now running the test suite, but I think it should be ready for review now.

It turns out that the trouble that I had with building the documentation can hardly be avoided: 

- If one has Cython code then Python can not determine the argspec.
- Hence, sage.misc.sageinspect.sage_getargspec tries to parse the argspec by reading the source file.
- Here, the sources are in an spkg, and thus sage_getargspec can not read the sources.
- By consequence, the argument list can not be figured out.

Since I define the arguments in the doc string, it is fine though, and it can't be changed anyway.

It turns out that the package does not work with the latest sage version: It fails to install, since apparently "singular" is undefined in one method, and the new version of Cython complains if stuff is not defined. I think this is going to be 2.1.2, also with some improvements in the underlying meataxe wrapper.

In fact, there are several reasons for this spkg to fail in the current Sage version. The first is the new Cython version, as explained above.

The second is the new Singular version: I see a many errors of the form 

```
// ** int division with `/`: use `div` instead in line >>  sage3687[1,tmp_i]=sage3687[1,tmp_i]**(COHO5dvNew[tmp_i]/COHO5dvOld[tmp_i]); <<
```
raised by Singular.

The third is signal handling: Most doctest failures just complain about the sig_on/sig_off count (they are supposed to come in pairs, but apparently I sometimes forgot to insert sig_off in the correct place. Thus, it seems that the doctest framework did not count sig_on/sig_off yet, when I last tested the cohomology spkg.

<a id='comment:47'>Comment 47:</a>
I have created a new version 2.1.2, available as stated in the ticket description.

There were three independent problems:

* Singular upgrade: Some commands have changed, and so I had to rewrite some parts of my code
* Cython upgrade: Some code, that admittedly was buggy, might have resulted in an error at running time, and the new Cython is refusing it during compilation. So, I fixed these bugs.
* Coercion and category framework: Some recent changes in #9138 or #11900 and related stuff, due to yours truly, have created an incompatibility with the group cohomology package: I shot myself into the foot. Now, the cohomology rings are making better use of category and coercion framework.

For me, the spkg test suite works. I didn't test on t2 or related machines, though.

Anyway, ready for review again!

With sage-5.0.beta8-gcc, testing seems to hang on sage.math:

```

```
At this point it didn't do anything for half an hour, so I killed it.

On an OS X 10.7 box, same Sage release, I got one doctest failure:

Replying to [@jhpalmieri](#comment%3A49):
> A number of failures on OpenSolaris. Here is a [log file](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/palmieri/misc/p_group_cohomology-2.1.2.log).

It seems that *all* tests fail, since there is a very basic problem:

```
ValueError: Can not create a symbolic link to the public database. Please remove /export/home/palmieri/.sage/pGroupCohomology/db/64gp158/
```

Why can the symbolic link not be created? Is that an openSolaris problem?

The rationale for introducing symbolic links was as follows:

* The package comes with a data base, that is installed into `SAGE_DATA/pGroupCohomology`. The package may be installed by root. But even in that case, it should be possible for *all* users to read from the database, and to extend partial computations found in the data base.
* While reading from the data base should not be a problem, extending partial computations IS a problem, if the user has no writing permission in `SAGE_DATA`.
* However, the user has writing permission in his/her home directory, in particular in DOT_SAGE. So, the basic idea is to put all new data there (in a sub-folder), but get existing data from `SAGE_DATA`.
* It would be a wast of storage space to actually *copy* the data from `SAGE_DATA` into `DOT_SAGE`. Therefore I only create links in `DOT_SAGE` that point to data in `SAGE_DATA`.
* Hard links are problematic, because it may happen that `DOT_SAGE` and `SAGE_DATA` belong to different partitions, but hard links have to stay in one partition. That restriction does not apply to symbolic links.

So, that is why I work with symbolic links. And when I tried on T2 (which is now not available), it did work. Do you know a reason why it fails on your i386-pc-solaris2.11?

Since the error message suggests to remove something from `/export/home/palmieri/.sage/pGroupCohomology/db/`,  could you perhaps try to empty that folder, and repeat the tests?

Hm. That message sounds like data have been moved accross directories.

Anyway. I just see that I get a couple of failures on sage-5.0.beta8, built with the gcc spkg from #12369. In some cases, problems with symbolic links are mentioned, or with files that can't be opened. Not good.

The good news is that I don't need to build Sage on `OpenSolaris` in order to replicated the trouble with symbolic links...

All but one error comes from a test that requires internet connection and tests whether the package can read download data from some repository on sage.math - and now I wonder: Isn't sage.math down at the moment?

I have just tried myself, but it failed:

```
sage: from pGroupCohomology import CohomologyRing
sage: H=CohomologyRing.web_db('8gp3') 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ReadError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
...
ReadError: file could not be opened successfully
```
Indeed, the problem is on the side of sage.math, and also it doesn't help to change to boxen.math. Namely, Sage is supposed to get a g-zipped tar file out of the data base, but what it receives is an html page saying that the requested page can not be found on the server. I will ask on sage-devel what happened.

One test is about the hash of matrices. The original aim was to test against a specific value, but perhaps that was a bad idea. After all, the specific value depends on whether the machine is big or little endian, and whether it is 32 or 64 bit. So, we have four possible values.

I think the natural solution is to not test against a specific value, but against the construction of the hash.

I have updated the spkg (at the old location).

Changes: I modified the hash function of my `MeatAxe` matrix wrapper. Before, the hash was based on the triple given by the modulus of the finite field, the dimensions of the matrix, and the contents of the memory block describing the matrix. Now, it is *only* based on the memory block describing the matrix.

Rationale:

* In our applications, the field is fixed, and so it does not add useful information to the hash.
* The size of the block of memory describing the matrix gives some information about the dimensions of the matrix, such that including the *exact* dimensions is not so important.

Also it is faster in that way:

```
sage: from pGroupCohomology.mtx import MTX
sage: M = MTX(5, [[randint(0,4) for _ in range(15)] for __ in range(15)])
sage: M.set_immutable()
sage: %timeit n = hash(M)
# With the new version
625 loops, best of 3: 750 ns per loop
# With the old version
625 loops, best of 3: 1.61 ¬µs per loop
```

The doc test for the `__hash__` method should now be machine independent. In order to provide an indirect test, I added a method that returns a string that corresponds to the block of memory describing the matrix.

On my computer, all tests pass. Concerning the doctests marked "optional - internet": Apparently they are run by the test suite, and they pass for me as well - even though the group cohomology data base in the Sage cluster is not available anymore. Fortunately, for the single purpose of testing my package, I stored one cohomology ring at sage.math.washington.edu/home/SimonKing/Cohomology/ - and that's enough for the tests to work.

Back to "needs review", then!

A few questions:

- Is it possible (and easy) to build the documentation locally? If so, it would be nice to implement that in spkg-install, using the environment variable `SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS` (see #10823).

- Also, can you provide the code for producing an on-line database, in case people want to host their own? Can people then set a variable to point to a different web site?

- I think a better way to disable parallel building is `export MAKE="$MAKE -j 1"`. Appending the `-j 1` at the end should override any earlier `-j` flags. But this would require testing. I also think that since you call `make` instead of `$MAKE`, maybe this is irrelevant anyway? This is all pretty minor, since it works as is.

Currently, it is not possible.

For creating the docs, I am using a script that is derived from the script that builds the Sage documentation. It would, of course, be possible to include the script in the spkg

However, that would not be enough. The docs should provide the argument list of each method. In order to determine the argspec of Cython methods, it is needed to be able to read the source code (see sage.misc.sageinspect). This is of course a problem for code that is outside the Sage library. My solution: I patched sage.misc.sageinspect, such that it would find the unpacked source of the spkg locally on my computer. But other users wouldn't have the unpacked spkg lying around.

Hm. I am just thinking: If the documentation is created *during installation*, then one *does* have the unpacked spkg. Still, I wouldn't like to patch sage.misc.sageinspect for that purpose. But perhaps the documentation builder script could hook into sage.misc.sageinspect.sage_getargspec?

Anyway, it would not be a straight forward solution.

> - Also, can you provide the code for producing an on-line database, in case people want to host their own? 

There is no ready-made method for that purpose. What one needs to do:

* Compute the cohomology (by default, the result is stored on disk). Make sure that the computation is "from_scratch" (there is an option of that name).
* In case of a p-group, the data are for a single cohomology ring are distributed into many different files in a directory. Create a gzipped tar of that directory (for each group separately, I mean). This tar file is then put into the data base.
* In case of groups that are not of prime power order, the cohomology ring is stored in a single file, and it should be this file that is put into the data base.

Do you think the following syntax (to be implemented) would be a nice addition?

```
sage: H = CohomologyRing(G, to_database="/path/to/database_folder")
sage: H.make()  # would compute the ring and create an entry in the database_folder
```


> Can people then set a variable to point to a different web site?

Yes! See the method `CohomologyRing.set_web_db(...)`.

> - I think a better way to disable parallel building is `export MAKE="$MAKE -j 1"`. Appending the `-j 1` at the end should override any earlier `-j` flags. But this would require testing. I also think that since you call `make` instead of `$MAKE`, maybe this is irrelevant anyway?

Do I? I thought I had changed it into `$MAKE`. At least, I had the intention at some point.

That's the *old* version of the test. Yesterday, I posted an update of the spkg, which contains a different (machine independent) test for the hash. Could you reforce installation, making sure you get the current version?

Yes, that sounds good. Maybe also a list somewhere of which specific calculations would make a good database.

The spkg-install file says, for example

```
MAKE=make; export MAKE;

cd src

make

You're right, I don't know how that happened. Anyway, all tests passed this time, including the internet ones.

I'm going to browse the source a bit more, but it all looks very good right now.

It is 3.4MB.

Or perhaps another syntax would be better. My previous suggestion was: "Declare during creation of a specific cohomology ring that it should go into a data base." But the computation of one ring typically involves the computation of rings for several subgroups (elementary abelian, Sylow, ...), and it would be reasonable to have them ALL in the data base.

Therefore, I think it would be better to have a *global* switch, for example

```
sage: CohomologyRing.create_database("/path/to/data_base")
```
with the effect that all subsequent cohomology computations will work as they usually do, but would additionally write the tar files into the given data base folder.

Oops. I will try what happens with parallel make - after all, the comment "Building in parallel is bad" is probably there for a reason (but I can't recall).
 
> I'm going to browse the source a bit more, but it all looks very good right now.

OK. Would it be OK to postpone the doc and data base additon, or would you strongly prefer to have it in 2.1.2 already?

I have updated th spkg on the old location (hence, if you download it again, make sure that you have the correct version, because sometimes wget is cached!).

Changes:

* If `SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS=yes` then the documentation is locally created, and copyied into SAGE_ROOT/local/share/doc/p_group_cohomology/html.
* I tried to allow parallel make, but `MeatAxe` would fail. I do not have the energy to fix it right now. At least, I am now reverting the old setting of `MAKE` as soon as `MeatAxe` is built, but apparently for installing the Cython modules it doesn't help.

Ready for review, anyway.

This looks great! Positive review. I appreciate having the documentation locally, too.

At least one thing which ought to be easy to implement in a future version: `additive_order` for elements: `a.additive_order()` should be either `1` (if `a==0`) or `p` (the characteristic of the ground field. If you ever construct cohomology rings over non-fields, you could leave it unimplemented in that case.

I found this a little strange:

```
sage: H0 = CohomologyRing(8,3)
sage: (H0.2 * H0.3).is_zero()
True
sage: (H0.2 * H0.3) == 0
False
```
Maybe comparisons or `__eq__` need to be implemented, too.

I think that the answers are consistent, for the following reasons:
* `H0.2*H0.3` is zero in the cohomology *group* H<sup>2</sup>(D8). As elements of that group, the product is zero, hence "is_zero()" returns True.
* However, even though the product vanishes and thus represents a relation of the cohomology ring, it still is a cocycle of degree 2. Thus, it is not equal to `H0.zero_element()`, which is a cocycle of degree 2. Hence, the comparison with the zero of the cohomology *ring* returns False.

Dear John,

I am sorry for being late, but I have one question: Would you allow one last-minute change?

Namely, with the package you just reviewed, the computation of the cohomology ring of the Sylow 2-subgroup of some double cover of Suzuki group 8 (this is group number 836 of order 128), the completion test √† la Peter Symonds is very time consuming - the problem was in the computation of a small subset of generators over which the ring is finite-dimensional. I found a way to speed it up. Also, I'd like to add protocol output to the method that computes it (which also means I will have to change the expected protocol output in some doc tests).

I think these changes are minor, but helpful. If you say that you would try to install it and run the test suite again, then I would update the spkg a bit later. I would also accept to postpone that change for a later spkg version.

What do you prefer?

If you do, could you also post a diff here, so I can see the changes?\n\nI have updated my spkg (old location) and have attache a diff with respect to the version that you have reviewed earlier.\n\nHere are the changes:\n\n* The `useSlimgb` resp. `useStd` options had been used only in one location: There were several places where the default 'groebner'  method of Singular would be used, regardless of the options.

Replying to [@jhpalmieri](#comment%3A66):
> I can run the test suite in the next day or two, once you update the spkg. So it's fine with me if you want to update it. If you do, could you also post a diff here, so I can see the changes?

I have updated my spkg (old location) and have attache a diff with respect to the version that you have reviewed earlier.

Here are the changes:

* The `useSlimgb` resp. `useStd` options had been used only in one location: There were several places where the default 'groebner'  method of Singular would be used, regardless of the options. That has changed in the last revision.
* The protocol output of some methods (e.g., `dependent_parameters()`) are now providing protocol output *before* a potentially time-consuming Gr√∂bner basis computation is started. Background: When I computed the cohomology of `SmallGroup(128,836)` with the previous revision, I thought that it hangs in the computation of the Gr√∂bner basis of the relation ideal - but in fact the problem was in `dependent_parameters()`, which has not been clear from the protocoll output.
* In Symonds' criterion, parameters in degree one won't contribute to the degree in which the criterion detects completeness. Hence, adding all degree one generators to a given list of parameters will not change the degree bound -- but it may make the computation easier, because killing degree one generators greatly reduces the difficulty of Gr√∂bner basis computations. Thus my changes in `dependent_parameters`
