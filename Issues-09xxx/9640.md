```
Currently, the exceptions thrown by PARI are rather cryptic, like

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
PariError:  (15)
```

This ticket does the following:

- Use `cb_pari_handle_exception()` instead of `err_catch()` to catch PARI exceptions.

- Using a mechanism similar to #9636, catch the full text of the exception and pass it to `PariError`.

- Introduce a new function `sig_error()` to callback to the interrupt/signal handling code to handle errors which aren't signals and use that for PARI.

Apply: [attachment:9640-pari_error_callbacks_v2.patch]

I am working on a patch that does the following things suggested by the ticket description:
- Rewrite `pari_catch_sig_on()` and `pari_catch_sig_off()` to use the callbacks `cb_pari_handle_exception` and `cb_pari_err_recover` (defined by the PARI library) in combination with `sig_on()`/`sig_off()`, as opposed to the additional `setjmp()` of the current implementation.
- Catch output sent to `pariErr` and store it in a string attribute `pari_instance.error_string` for later use by `PariError`.

It seems to work quite well; the only doctest failures I've seen so far are a few tests expecting a PARI warning message.  With the patch, these are not printed because they also go to `pariErr`.

To be done:
- Make `PariError` aware of the stored string to give a more informative error message.  This should probably simply be extracted from the lines starting with `***` in `pari_instance.error_string`.
- Minor change in PARI: send any extra newline at the start of the error message to `pariErr` instead of `pariOut` (this happens if the last printed character was not a newline).
- Distinguish between errors and warnings; the latter should probably be printed to `stderr` as before.  This should be done either by filtering the text sent to `pariErr` or by having `pari_catch_sig_off()` check if `pari_instance.error_string` is non-empty even if no error occurred.

This may make #14894 redundant, although that ticket could be used for general things to be done for the upgrade to PARI 2.6.

The latest patch does everything that I think it should do.  I hope it is reasonably self-explanatory.  A few remarks:

- The error text is now passed to `PariError` and can be accessed using `PariError.errtext()`; is is not printed automatically.  Using this text to improve messages like `PariError:  (15)` will probably have to wait until another ticket.  (Edit: `user` errors are an exception, since they are converted into `RuntimeError`; here we append the error text to the currently used "PARI user exception".)

- There is no problem with PARI sending escape sequences for colours in error messages; this is disabled by default.

- The printing of a possible extra newline before the error message is easily avoided using `pari_set_last_newline(1)`.

- The callback functions are now Cython functions in the new file `pari_error.pyx`.  It is important that this does *not* include `pari_err.pxi`; because of the way Cython imports functions, `pari_err.pxi` and `pari_err.h` use function pointers with the same names as the functions defined in `pari_error.pyx`.

But it existed before (as a function `__errmessage()`) and one possible use would be to check that an error is of a given type without relying on the PARI error codes (for example, in pure Python code). Something like:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    pari.....\nexcept PariError as E:\n    if E.parimessage() == \"division by zero\":\n        raise ZeroDivisionError\n    else:\n        raise\n```\nPerhaps this is never going to happen, but at least the method `parimessage()` doesn't hurt either.",

For me, it can be removed. But it existed before (as a function `__errmessage()`) and one possible use would be to check that an error is of a given type without relying on the PARI error codes (for example, in pure Python code). Something like:

```python
try:
    pari.....
except PariError as E:
    if E.parimessage() == "division by zero":
        raise ZeroDivisionError
    else:
        raise
```
Perhaps this is never going to happen, but at least the method `parimessage()` doesn't hurt either.

That is a possibility.  On the other hand, the global variable `errmessage` is another thing that has disappeared in PARI 2.6.  It has been replaced by a function `const char *numerr_name(long numerr)` which returns e.g. `"e_INV"` for zero division errors.  This means that in the near future your example will probably look like

```python
if pari.numerr_name(E.errnum()) == "e_INV":
    raise ZeroDivisionError
```
Of course, one could then think of a method of `PariError` encapsulating this if necessary, but `parimessage` would no longer be an appropriate name.

For the time being (at least until we switch to PARI 2.6) or unless someone really wants a method like this, I think it is easiest to just remove it.

Since we both looked at eachother's work, I guess that counts as positive review.
