Hi,
several packages do use `python setup.py`. This picks up the customized settings from ~/.pydistutils.cfg. This is bad, because it overrides the prefix setting. 

For sage-main, I'll attach a patch: `setup.cfg` in the corresponding directory overrides the usere settings. Maybe there's a global solution.

Regards,
  Alexander Dreyer

Update for Sage 7.5. The problem reported on this ancient ticket is still present and affects
- sagelib, 
- packages that are installed directly using `setup.py`
- packages that are installed using pip.

It can be tested by creating the following `~/.pydistutils.cfg`:

```
[install]
root=/does-not-exist
```

The patch on the ticket uses 
- `pip --isolated` and 
- `setup.py --no-user-cfg`

Note there appear to be some issues regarding these option with early versions of Python 3.x: https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/3509

Hi,
I backported the handling of setup.py --no-user-cfg from  Python 2.7 to Python 2.6.4 and also added the handling of the environment variable `DISTUTILS_NO_USER_CFG` to python's distutils. 

The new spkg can be found here: 
http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/dreyer/suse101/python-2.6.4.p10.spkg

The last patch adds this variable to `sage-env`.

You should also create patches/ACKS.txt.diff as a unified diff file. Although its fairly obvious you can recreate that now, that will not be the case if Python source code is updated. 

Would a simpler solution not be for sage-env to set this variable and export it? I don't know much about python, so can't review this myself.
