## Build environment
* Sun Ultra 27 3.33 GHz Intel W3580 Xeon. Quad core. 8 threads. 12 GB RAM
* OpenSolaris 2009.06 snv_134 X86
* Sage 4.4.2
* gcc 4.4.4

## How gcc 4.4.4 was configured
Since the configuration of gcc is fairly critical on OpenSolaris, here's how it was built. 

```
drkirkby@hawk:~/sage-4.4.2$ gcc -v
Using built-in specs.
Target: i386-pc-solaris2.11
Configured with: ../gcc-4.4.4/configure --prefix=/usr/local/gcc-4.4.4 --with-as=/usr/local/binutils-2.20/bin/as --with-ld=/usr/ccs/bin/ld --with-gmp=/usr/local --with-mpfr=/usr/local
Thread model: posix
gcc version 4.4.4 (GCC) 
```

gcc 4.3.4 was failing to build iconv. 

## How the Sage build was attempted
* 64-bit build. SAGE64 was set to "yes"
* #9008 update zlib to latest upstream release to allow a 64-bit library to be built. 
* #9009 update mercurial spkg to build 64-bit.
* #7982 update sage_fortran so it can build 64-bit binaries.
* Run 'make -k' to skip over errors, to allow one to find the errors quickly. 


## The problem
This a problem with python rather than pygments and is **very** similar to #9022. Since python is not building _socket, so some other parts of Sage fail to build if they need _socket.

The updated spkg is now ready for review at 

http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/patches/python-2.6.4.p9.spkg

The attached patch looks huge, since it includes a huge C file (patches/Modules.socketmodule.c) which is largely untouched from the original Python file (Modules/socketmodule.c) Only the following 3 files really need to be looked at 
* SPKG.txt
* spkg-install
* patches/Modules.socketmodule.diff (the diff from the original python file). 

This contains a fix from Robert Bradsure for #9042, which I've given positive review to. 

The new python package has been tested on the following platforms, and found to work ok. 

 == Testing on OS X (bsd.math) ==
The test was performed using Sage 4.4.2

```

I've checked that _socket builds - it is not listed in the list of either:
* Modules where Python could not find the necessary parts, **or**
* Modules which failed to build

 == Testing on Linux (sage.math) ==
The test was performed using Sage 4.4.2

```

```
Obviously _socket builds there, otherwise I would not be submitted this as a patch!

## Testing on Solaris 10 on SPARC (my own Sun Blade 1000)
The test was performed using Sage 4.4.rc0. Any differences between 4.4.rc0 and 4.4.2 should not affect the building of the python package. 

I've not bothered testing on the SPARC-based Sun T5240 't2.math', as I don't have a build of Sage on 't2'. But my own Sun Blade 1000 (SPARC based) has an older release of Solaris 10. The fact the python module builds on that, should ensure it builds on any later release of Solaris 10 on SPARC. 

```
Sleeping for three seconds before testing python

user    11m15.781s
sys     2m22.087s

```
Again, the _socket module builds ok. 


## Notes to the release manager
1) This package includes the fix from Robert Bradsure #9042. The patch must be applied after that at #9042. The package here at 
http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/patches/python-2.6.4.p9.spkg can replace Robert's python-2.6.4.p8.spkg

2) Once this is closed #9022 can be closed too, since the root cause of the problem at #9022 is the same as here. A python module failed to build, so two parts of Sage would not build.
