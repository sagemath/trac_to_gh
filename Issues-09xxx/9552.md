 I noticed to my surprise that misc/cython.py has these lines in it (which should be fixed, of course):

```
 import sage.server.support
    d = {}
    sage.server.support.cython_import_all(tmpfile, d,
                                         verbose=verbose, compile_message=compile_message,

<a id='comment:5'></a>Yeah, I think a lot of that stuff could go elsewhere, it's just support...

In this case the "right" fix is to move the whole Cython stuff somewhere else, probably just to cython.py (which is not a pyx file, at least not any more).
