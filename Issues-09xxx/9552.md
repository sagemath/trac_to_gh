 I noticed to my surprise that misc/cython.py has these lines in it (which should be fixed, of course):

```
 import sage.server.support
    d = {}
    sage.server.support.cython_import_all(tmpfile, d,
                                         verbose=verbose, compile_message=compile_message,

Yeah, I think a lot of that stuff could go elsewhere, it's just support...

In this case the "right" fix is to move the whole Cython stuff somewhere else, probably just to cython.py (which is not a pyx file, at least not any more).

Indeed, this wouldn't be hard to do.  Worst-case we could move them but leave a deprecation that points to the new location (cython.py seems best).

```
sage: search_src('cython_import')
misc/cython.py:657:    sage.server.support.cython_import_all(tmpfile, d,
misc/cython.py:756:    from sage.server.support import cython_import
misc/cython.py:757:    return cython_import(file, create_local_c_file=False)
misc/cython_c.pyx:61:    sage.server.support.cython_import_all(tmpfile, globals(),
server/support.py:425:def cython_import(filename, verbose=False, compile_message=False,

server/support.py:468:    m = cython_import(filename, verbose=verbose, compile_message=compile_message,
```
The notebook already has its own versions of these two functions so that is not a problem, as far as I can tell (though it wouldn't hurt testing it can still Cythonize after doing this).
