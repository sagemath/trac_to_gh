The root system / coxeter group code is designed from the ground up to allow for this extension.

Steps:

- Double check `CartanType(["H",3]).coxeter_diagram()` and friends

- Given a coxeter diagram, construct the dynkin diagram `g`
  corresponding to the geometric representation; most of the time,
  this will involve roots of unity, and require e.g. a cyclotomic
  field (see also #8327)

- Make sure that `L = RootSystem(g).root_space()` accepts such a diagram

- Make sure that `WeylGroup(L)` accepts such a root space

- Fix all the interfaces to properly reflect the generalization
  (e.g. WeylGroup above should really be CoxeterGroup).

Here's a patch which should take care of all except the second point since I thought Dynkin diagrams where separate from Coxeter diagrams except when there are 1,2,3, or 4 bonds (and even then, we're ignoring the arrows).

Base patch is from #15137, but now uses the UCF as the default field.

Hey Frederic,

Replying to [@fchapoton](#comment%3A11):
> "assert implementation" : I think this use of assert to check input is not encouraged

This was a hold-over from the previous implementation, but this is definitely a good time to get rid of it. Fixed.

> "lazy_import('sage.groups.raag', 'RightAngledArtinGroup')" : has this something to do in this ticket ?

Because I didn't split it cleanly with #15137. Fixed.

> What are the changes "sage/groups/matrix_gps/finitely_generated.py" for ?

I need to pass the `CoxeterGroups` category up during the initialization, so I had to make those changes.

Thanks for catching that,

Travis

Hello Travis,

I have made a cosmetic review patch, that you can fold into yours if you want.

This almost looks good to go, but I was a bit disappointed when I tried:

```
sage: K = NumberField(x**2+5,'t')
sage: CoxeterGroup(['H',3],base_ring=K)
```
and it failed. If there is a way to make that work, it would be great !
