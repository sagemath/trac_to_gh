Though sphinx is perfectly working with target in the local module he isn't
able to find reference target from other modules even if they are exported in
all.py. For example, if I want to link Parent from anywhere but parent.pyx, I
have to write the full path (ie. <code>:class:\`~sage.structure.parent.Parent</code>`)
even if it is imported in my module. I find this extremely annoying since, in
the task of improving the category doc, I'm setting up a lot of huge cross
references such as:

```
    :meth:`Algebras.ParentMethods.algebra_generators()
    <sage.categories.algebras.Algebras.ParentMethods.algebra_generators>`.
```
I would be very happy if I had to write only

```
    :meth:`Algebras.ParentMethods.algebra_generators`
```
The following patch should solve this issue

I set up `intersphinx` so that links to Python's doc are correctly
resolved. The patch
[attachment:trac_9128-intersphinx_python_database-fh.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9128/trac_9128-intersphinx_python_database-fh.patch) contains Python's
crossref database downloaded from http://docs.python.org/objects.inv I'm also
using intersphinx to solve links to the reference manual from the other
documents.

## New option for docbuild

I added the option `--warn-links` to the documentation build command as in

```
    sage -docbuild --warn-links reference htm
```
When the option is used, Sphinx will issue a warning, whenever a link is not resolved.

## Extra features

Moreover, I add a reference target to every automatically created `.rst`
file associated to python source files. It can by used to set-up a link toward
the file and thus get the title rather than the module. For example
`:ref:sage.categories.primer` setup a link to the help page with title
`"Elements, parents, and categories in Sage: a (draft of) primer"` rather
than
`sage.categories.primer` which you get with the link
`:mod:sage.categories.primer`.

## Apply both:

Hi Andrey

Replying to [@novoselt](#comment%3A7):

Thanks for looking at that. My patch was working for `.py` and `.pyx`
file but not `.rst` file. The new updated file should work. I didn't get
any comment from `#sphinx-devel` except that `missing-reference` is
the good entry point. So except if some expert pop up and suggest some more
improvements, I consider this proposal as a good one. Please review.

Hi Andrey,

Hi Florent!

I have figured out that the problem is with the underscore - if I use a "common" method from the same non-imported patch, link is determined just fine.

It may be a good idea not to give warnings in such cases, but on the other hand it is probably quite rare and there is no need to make logic of this patch more convoluted. (In my case the docstring of one of the functions says "see the source code of ... for more involved examples", since those examples cannot be easily written as standalone code and I didn't want to write something "involved, but artificial.")

Since I really like this functionality, I will continue using your patch (and its fresh versions if they become available) and report new problems, if there will be any. But for the final review we will need someone else, since I don't know how Sphinx works and cannot comment on the code itself.

Thank you!
Andrey

This should be exactly what I'm doing: I issue two different kinds of warning:
 
- <code>undefined symbol :%s:\`%s\` in %s</code>

Bu maybe sometime I fail finding a symbol and therefore issue the first warning instead of the second one... Is this happening for you ?

Replying to [@hivert](#comment%3A20):
> Yes ! That was before I know how to resolve those with `intersphinx`. See my new patches

There is still a problem: currently when linking to python, I raise a warning **before** intersphinx tries to find the link in Python's database.

Some update: It is not possible to achieve what I want in Sphinx 0.6 without hacking into sphinx. However Sphinx 1.0 should be out very soon (they released 1.0beta2 last week). At raising warning is builtin in sphinx 1.0 with the correct configuration option. So I'll probably wait until sphinx 1.0 is out to finish this one, unless someone insist to have it very soon.

Hi there,

I'm uploading two new patches:
 
- `trac_9128-intersphinx_python_database-fh.patch` updated to Python 2.7
 
- `trac_9128-sphinx_links_all-fh.patch` rebased for Sage-5.0.alpha4 and in particular on top of #12490 which was previously in this ticket.

As I already said, I'm not sure if this should enter Sage in the present status but I need a Sphinx expert (if not George Brandl himself) to try to polish and simplify my code. However, I think the feature is quite important in order to improve Sage's doc, so I suggest that if no expert jump up to let the code enter Sage as such and to improve it in a former ticket. I therefore leave it as need-review.

Unfortunately, I've no idea how to doctests those. As you can see from the
code, I wrote my patch using log backtrace and `pdb`. At several point,
I'm using call to sphinx or docutils internal which are not really
documented. So this is some kind of reverse engineering. I tried several time
to ask for some help on sphinx-user and never got any answer on that. My
diagnostic is that Sphinx doesn't expose a sufficiently flexible API to
achieve what we want.

Probably a good solution would be to have a Sage-days whose subject is Sphinx
and doc-compiling and invite George Brandl. We could also solve the Sphinx
parallel build ticket at the same occasion. Unfortunately, I just organized a
Sage-days and I'm invited to two other until summer so I won't organize such a
days and if organized, I don't think I'll be able to attend.

By the way, I'll CC this on Sage-devel.

Hi there,

I finalized the doc of this patch. I also took the chance to add a extra option 'warn-links' which make Sphinx complains for dangling links.

Let me clarify that this happened on sage.math, where the memory size is set to 1500000.  On a different system with 3000000 as limit, it compiled.  The end of that pdflatex log file shows:

```

#6495 might fix this, since it breaks the reference manual up into smaller pieces.  The only question is whether the pieces are small enough...

First of all, I need to express my feelings: Fucking Sphinx, Fucking
Latex. None of these two software where seriously designed to scale to a
project of Sage size. That's a shame.

While I'm at it, fucking Sagemath distro. It worked without any problem on my
laptop.
**`\end{GROUMPH}`**

Sorry for this non useful comment.

I'm quite angry and frustrated because what my patch does is only to fix a
huge bunch of missing links in Sage doc way before they are sent to the
docutil writer for HTML or TeX. My patch is working at the level of docutil
abstract syntax tree, but I could have fixed those link by editing Sage source
as well.  This means that **if** the doc of Sage was correct, it **won't** compile
either ! And now because I tried to fix the doc, I'm asked to fix LaTeX. I
don't think it is really fair.

This also means that, whether or not we apply this patch, we **will** hit the
same problem again, as the doc of Sage is expected to grow.

---

Let's try to be more constructive. I see several solution:

- add a comment in Sage installation instructions saying that TeX limitation
should be enhanced to compile the PDF doc (by the way, are there any people
really using the PDF doc out there ?)

- is it really a hard limitation. Couldn't this be fixed by a shell variable ?
I had the following script in my `~/bin` when I was using `XY-pic`:

```
popcorn-*binat/doc/common $ cat ~/bin/hugetex
#!/bin/sh
#####################################
# Boosted TeX to compile withc XY-pic
export extra_mem_bot=8000000; tex $*
```
Jeroen: will you be so kind to try if this works ?

- I can maybe disable my link fixing code when we are compiling to PDF, but I
think this is really a temporary bugware solution. Considering the time I
already lost on this ticket and the fact that this doesn't solve the problem
but barely hide it, I don't think this is an acceptable solution.

First of all, I need to express my feelings: Fucking Sphinx, Fucking
Latex. None of these two software where seriously designed to scale to a
project of Sage's size. That's a shame.

While I'm at it, fucking Sagemath distro. It worked without any problem on my
laptop.

**`\end{GROUMPH}`**

Sorry for this non useful comment.

I'm quite angry and frustrated because what my patch does is only to fix a
huge bunch of missing links in Sage doc, way before they are sent to the
docutil writer for HTML or TeX. My patch is working at the level of docutil
abstract syntax tree, but I could have fixed those link by editing Sage source

**wouldn't** compile either ! And now because I tried to fix the doc, I'm

What do you think ?
