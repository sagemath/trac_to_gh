I think it would be sensible to move the functions


enum_projective_rational_field


enum_projective_finite_field


enum_affine_rational_field


enum_affine_finite field



from their current position at the top of sage.schemes.generic.homset, and to clean up their code to make it easier to read whilst (I believe) keeping the timing about the same.

I have started work on a patch that does this, putting them into a new file sage.schemes.generic.rational_point and using the cartesian_product_iterator function to make the code much more readable.

This is a preamble to putting other (more efficient) functions that find rational points in specific cases into the same file - I am currently working on this, and will make a separate ticket for it.

<a id='comment:5'></a>1) I (believe I have) fixed the issues flagged by novoselt. Thank you novoselt for your help in pointing them out.

2) I have improved the code so that it can take either a scheme or an abstract set of rational points of a scheme as input.

THERE IS A KNOWN DOCTEST FAIL with this patch;

The following tests failed:

sage/coding/code_constructions.py
sage/coding/linear_code.py 
sage/coding/decoder.py
doc/en/constructions/linear_codes.rst

I think this is because the coding modules use the enum_projective_finite_field function. This causes the same problem as point 4. of my previous comment (circa 8th June). The new versions of each of these functions sort points but the old ones did not. I suspect that the coding functions depend on the order of the output of enum_projective_finite_field and so fail now that that order has changed. I am not proficient with codes and do not feel able to fix this issue. I wonder if someone who does understand coding could help and fix this? I CC David Joyner, who originally wrote these modules. Perhaps it is simply a matter of adapting the doctests to take into account the new ordering. I believe that this is the right way round; that the ordering of the output of the "enum" functions should not depend on the algorithm used.

Because of this, I suggest that the patch be reviewed ignoring these problems with coding modules, and in the meantime a coding person might be able to help solve the problems.

The ordering of vector spaces over finite fields is used all over the place. In constructing the Hamming codes, etc. I think there is a echelon form involved afterward as well, so it is easy enough to seem like this isn't just a problem with order changing...

The new patch includes all previous ones, and fixes a docstring fix which needed to be rebased.

(`galois_closure` in `linear_code.py`) can be vastly simplified, and probably sped up in the process.

Programming no-nos:
1. Using logarithms to test whether one finite field is contained in another (why not just check whether the characteristics are the same and if one degree divides the other?).
2. `G1 = [[x for x in g.list()] for g in G.rows()]` ... Why not `G1 = G.rows()` or at least `G1 = [g.list() for g in G.rows()]` etc.? This is a big waste of time (remember that Python is slow anyway...)
3. This is also bad:

```
        MS = MatrixSpace(F,2*k,n)
        G3 = MS(G2)
        r = G3.rank()
        MS = MatrixSpace(F,r,n)
        Grref = G3.echelon_form()
        G = MS([Grref.row(i) for i in range(r)])
```
... why not just `G3 = Matrix(F, 2*k, n, G2); G = G3.row_space().basis_matrix()` or the equivalent? It's easier to follow and might be more efficient, too. 

(Not criticisms of code in this ticket at all, for the skimmer -- just an indication that `linear_code.py` needs more work...)
