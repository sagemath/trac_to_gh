This depends on #9720, so first apply the v3 patch from there.  This method generates random diagonalizable matrices whose eigenvectors, if computed by hand, have only integer values. This routine is designed as educational tool, generating exam and homework problems, and problem generating interacts.

The v2 patch is independent of #9754. There are revisions to the documentation of the random_diagonalizable_matrix routine, as well as to the random_matrix routine.  The code is revised to fit with the generalization of the random_matrix constructor.  First apply v4 from #9720, and then v2 from #9803 and go from there.

This (with the other patches, as indicated above) applied fine to 4.5.1 and passed sage -testall.

Positive review, as far as I am concerned (and will be useful for me teaching linear algebra later in the semester!). Perhaps Mike Hansen should have the final say?

Thanks Rob and bwonderly!
