This depends on #9720, so first apply the v3 patch from there.  This method generates random diagonalizable matrices whose eigenvectors, if computed by hand, have only integer values. This routine is designed as educational tool, generating exam and homework problems, and problem generating interacts.

This (with the other patches, as indicated above) applied fine to 4.5.1 and passed sage -testall.

Positive review, as far as I am concerned (and will be useful for me teaching linear algebra later in the semester!). Perhaps Mike Hansen should have the final say?
