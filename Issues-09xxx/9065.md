[This thread](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/a5ea008c24c17956/00ab8c6d2a16f57a)

The main issue currently is that facade parents (`Primes, NonNegativeIntegers, SymmetricFunctions,` ...) are not aware that they are, which breaks some of the generic `TestSuite` tests.

This involves:
- Adding a new optional argument for `Parent.__init__`: `Parent.__init__(self, facade = [ZZ])`
- Creating a category or abstract class for facade parents
- Adding a method `P.is_parent_of(x)` in `Sets.ParentMethods` which checks that the parent of x is (equal to) P. Override this method for facade parents to check that the parent of x is one of the declared parents of P.
- Fix `P._test_one(), P._test_zero(), P._test_an_element()` (and maybe others) to use `P.is_parent_of(x)` instead of `x in P`.
- Updating a couple parents to use it

Hi Nicolas, 

I started to review this. I currently have only the following interface
remark: id there a reason why you need to pass a tuple for parameter
`facade` whereas for `category` you can pass either a category or a
tuple ? For example, why do you force the user to write 

```
Parent.__init__(self, facade = (IntegerRing(), ), category = Sets()) 
```
instead of

```
Parent.__init__(self, facade = IntegerRing(), category = Sets()) 
```

Actually, it seems that the code in `Parent` allows for it. So I guess
that the example where the one parameter tuple occur could be simplified. I'm
writing a review patch on the sage-combinat queue.
