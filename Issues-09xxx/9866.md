Nobody seems to care very much, so I'm closing this as invalid.

I have had this result in a doctest failure onOpenSolaris on more than one occasion. But it's not every reproducible. The test fails, then passes when rerun. 

Sorry I did not comment earlier.

One "solution" to track down further this problem is to change the exception handling code in `sage/interfaces/expect.py`.  This is the relevant code:

```
        try:
            if self.__remote_cleaner and self._server:
                c = 'sage-native-execute  ssh %s "nohup sage -cleaner"  &'%self._server
                os.system(c)
            self._expect = pexpect.spawn(cmd, logfile=self.__logfile)
            if self._do_cleaner():
                cleaner.cleaner(self._expect.pid, cmd)

        except (ExceptionPexpect, pexpect.EOF, IndexError):
            self._expect = None
            self._session_number = BAD_SESSION
            failed_to_start.append(self.__name)
            raise RuntimeError, "Unable to start %s because the command '%s' failed.\n%s"%(
                self.__name, cmd, self._install_hints())
```
The problem is that we probably lose information by catching the exception and re-raising a different exception.  We only know that `gp` failed, but not for which reason.  I'm guessing something OS-related like not enough memory, but we don't know for sure.

I doubt it's a lack of memory. My machine has 12 GB RAM and I suspect 50-100 GB or so of swap. That said, others do use the machine, but I usually do check logs when I get doctest failures - that's why I wish the date+time of the doctests were recorded. 

I know it's not normal to reopen tickets, but since this one was closed only a few hours ago, with no releases of Sage since, would it be sensible to reopen this? The problem does still exist and on more than one platform
