In the Developer's Guide there is no reference to the "-tnew" flag to the sage executable, which will instruct Sage to only doctest changed files. I suggest adding such a reference in "Walking through the development process" as well as "Parallel Testing the Sage Library".

Does anyone know how the "-tnew" flag works in detail? In particular, does it doctest every file that has been changed *as well as its dependencies*? If it is the case, this should be mentioned in the documentation. Otherwise, shouldn't it?
