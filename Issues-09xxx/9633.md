Two points: (1) I think "P = parent(x)" is simpler, if I'm reading sage.structure.parent correctly.  (2) Doctest? `:^)`

Certainly looks good!   Interesting that we didn't catch that when we put it in, even though it explicitly has 'float' in the previous version :( 

Currently running tests in case there was something subtle about `x.parent()` that was different from `parent(x)`, though I can't see what that would be ...
