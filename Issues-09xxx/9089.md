In an attempt to optimize, in some cases the `__add__` method of Graphics3dGroup modifies its arguments instead of returning a new Graphics3dGroup object.  This breaks the user expectation, as illustrated below:

```
a=point3d([1,0,0])+point3d([0,1,0])
b=point3d([0,0,1])
a # shows 2 points
a+b # shows all 3 points
a # Now this shows 3 points!!!
```

The attached patch deletes the offending optimization.  If fast summing is needed, then the user can either create a Graphics3dGroup object themselves, or use something like `sage.misc.misc.balanced_sum`

Before patch:

sage: from sage.plot.plot3d.base import Graphics3dGroup
sage: lines=[line3d([[0,0,0],[cos(t),sin(t),1]]) for t in [0,0.05,..,6]]; len(lines)
121
sage: %timeit p=sum(lines)
625 loops, best of 3: 82.1 µs per loop
sage: lines=[line3d([[0,0,0],[cos(t),sin(t),1]]) for t in [0,0.05,..,6]]; len(lines)
121
sage: %timeit p=balanced_sum(lines)
625 loops, best of 3: 455 µs per loop
sage: lines=[line3d([[0,0,0],[cos(t),sin(t),1]]) for t in [0,0.05,..,6]]; len(lines)
121
sage: %timeit p=Graphics3dGroup(lines)
625 loops, best of 3: 179 µs per loop
```


After patch:

```

sage: from sage.misc.misc import balanced_sum
sage: from sage.plot.plot3d.base import Graphics3dGroup
sage: lines=[line3d([[0,0,0],[cos(t),sin(t),1]]) for t in [0,0.05,..,6]]; len(lines)
121
sage: %timeit p=sum(lines)

sage: %timeit p=Graphics3dGroup(lines)
625 loops, best of 3: 180 µs per loop

```

So, as could be expected, performance of sum is impacted quite a bit.  However, I would still say that the current behavior is wrong, and correctness trumps speed, especially if the overall total speed is still quite fast.

Actually, I just checked, and something like it is already being done.  If you do sum(something,...), then if something has a sum method, it is called: something.sum(...).  Of course, this won't work with lists or generators.
