+This bug tracks the current status of the toric varieties code and the interdependence of new patches, which should be applied **on top of Sage 4.6.** Any (properly ordered) part of positively reviewed patches can be merged at any time, there is no need to "bundle tickets."
 
+**Positively reviewed:**
+
+* #10237: Polyhedra of trivial cones are wrong
+* #9954: `f_vector` outputs an extra top-dimensional cell
+* #8656: 'face_lattice` does not seem to work for unbounded polyhedra
+* #10238: Containment checks are wrong for empty polyhedra
+
+Currently working on:
+
+* #9972: Add toric lattice morphisms
+* #9713: Add the toric Chow group
+
+The following two patches will probably become prerequisites at one point:
+
+* #9918: triangulate point configurations
+
+Depending on them:
+
+* #10023: Compute Hilbert basis of cone

+This bug tracks the current status of the toric varieties code and the interdependence of new patches, which should be applied **on top of Sage 4.7**. Any (properly ordered) part of positively reviewed patches can be merged at any time, there is no need to "bundle tickets."

+

+* #10140: Base sage.geometry.cone on the Parma Polyhedra Library (PPL)

+* #10529: dimension() and is_smooth() for algebraic subschemes of toric varieties
+* #11481: LLL for degenerate matrices crashes
+* #10540: Spec and patches for singular affine toric varieties / algebraic schemes.
+
+**Applied to the next alpha/beta/rc:**
+
+* #11312: Speed up the computation of the Hilbert basis of a cone
+* #11392: Toric ideals over fraction fields
+
+**Positively reviewed:**
+
+* #11558: Echelonize with transformation=True oddness for sparse matrix

+This bug tracks the current status of the toric varieties code and the interdependence of new patches, which should be applied **on top of Sage 5.0**. Any (properly ordered) part of positively reviewed patches can be merged at any time, there is no need to "bundle tickets."

+
+**Applied to the next alpha/beta/rc:**
+
+**Positively reviewed:**
