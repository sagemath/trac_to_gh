GnuTLS is one of the many standard packages in Sage (see #9281 for a list), which do not have a spkg-check file. This means that if one builds Sage with the environment variable SAGE_CHECK set to "yes", no self-tests of the package will be run. This is silly, as GnuTLS has a test suite.

After adding the required file, the test suite is run and at least on my OpenSolaris laptop, passes all tests.
