gap sysfiles.c is very host-dependent.  Current code includes a mixture of SYS_xxx and HAVE_xxx_H tests.  Whilst SYS_BSD might appear logical for FreeBSD, there is no testing for this, and recent FreeBSD variants support termios.h.

The attached patches (mostly taken from the FreeBSD port) add tests for HAVE_TERMIOS_H to make gap compile on FreeBSD 8.x.

I can confirm that this patch is needed to build sage-5.0.beta12.  It would be great if this patch could get put into sage.  It should be harmless to the builds under all other OS.

Just for the record:

There's also a new GAP spkg at #7041; one should perhaps base a new one here on the latter, although it currently doesn't yet use `patch`.  (I've added a couple of TODOs, some of which I'll probably address at #7041 as well, if I find the time...)

Since #7041 didn't use patch, I don't think we need to do this either.

So we need a new spkg with this patch.
