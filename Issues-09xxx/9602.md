gap sysfiles.c is very host-dependent.  Current code includes a mixture of SYS_xxx and HAVE_xxx_H tests.  Whilst SYS_BSD might appear logical for FreeBSD, there is no testing for this, and recent FreeBSD variants support termios.h.

The attached patches (mostly taken from the FreeBSD port) add tests for HAVE_TERMIOS_H to make gap compile on FreeBSD 8.x.
