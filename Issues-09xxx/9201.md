Some R modules aren't built/installed on t2.  This makes builds fail when `SAGE_CHECK` is set.  From [comment:ticket:8306:67 this comment] at #8306:

Running R's `make check` on t2 gives

```
 Collecting examples for package `stats'
   Extracting from parsed Rd's ..............................
 Running examples in package `stats'
 Error: testing 'stats' failed
 Execution halted
 make[5]: *** [test-Examples-Base] Error 1
```
Here's some detail from `src/tests/Examples/stats-Ex.Rout.fail`:

```
 > contrasts(ffs) <- contr.sum(5, sparse=TRUE)[,1:2]; contrasts(ffs)
 Error in .Diag(levels, sparse = sparse) :
   contr*(.., sparse=TRUE) needs package "Matrix" correctly installed
 Calls: contr.sum -> .Diag
 Execution halted
```
[This log](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mpatel/trac/8306/r-2.10.1.p2.log) also shows that R's Matrix package isn't built/installed successfully:

```
 Loading required package: Matrix
 Error in dyn.load(file, DLLpath = DLLpath, ...) :
   unable to load shared library '/scratch/mpatel/sage-4.4.4.alpha0-j64-par-chk/spkg/build/r-2.10.1.p2/src/library/Matrix/libs/Matrix.so':
   ld.so.1: R: fatal: libgcc_s.so.1: open failed: No such file or directory
 Error : require(Matrix, save = FALSE) is not TRUE
```
Moreover, comparing the output of `ls SAGE_LOCAL/lib/R/library` on sage.math and t2 builds indicates that we're also missing the class, mgcv, nnet, rpart, spatial, and survival packages on t2.

I think we also need a doctest which can detect if these parts of R are functional. It is a bit poor if Sage passes all the doc tests, while 6 packages have not built. 

I'm puzzled why libgcc_s.so.1 is not found. I would expect a failure to find that library to cause huge chunks of Sage to be non-functional. It is the gcc library, which is searched for with LD_LIBRARY_PATH:

```
kirkby@t2:[~] $ ls -l  /usr/local/gcc-4.4.1-sun-linker/lib/libgcc_s.so.1
-rw-r--r--   1 nobody   nobody    259816 Aug  3  2009 /usr/local/gcc-4.4.1-sun-linker/lib/libgcc_s.so.1
kirkby@t2:[~] $ echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH
/usr/local/gcc-4.4.1-sun-linker/lib:/usr/local/gcc-4.4.1-sun-linker/lib/sparcv9:/usr/local/lib
```

I've never written a doc test, and don't know R at all, but I think that each module we build should be tested.

It's not quite clear to me where these doctests would go.  The R interface docs are supposed to test that the interface works, not that R itself built properly.  The easiest way to test these is simply

```
r.library('package_name')

I've no idea where the tests would go, or how to write them. But IMHO, if parts of R are non-functional (and it seems to be several parts), this should be detected. We test that some python modules have built, especially those that have known to be problematic, like _hashlib. 

I'm still puzzled why R can't find libgcc_s.so.1, as it is definately there. running

```
$ sage -sh
$ cd local/lib
$ ldd * | grep libgcc_s.so.1
```
I can see numerous parts of Sage link to libgcc_so.1. In fact, there are 127 of them! Here's the first one (certtool), if I run 'ldd' to see what it is linked against

```

I thought of someplace to put this that would make some sense, at least.  Under install_packages() in r.py, one could show how to get the matrix of all installed packages (which would be relevant), and as a doctest do 

```
sage: a = r.installed_packages()
sage: [pack in str(a) for pack in ['Matrix', 'package_1',...,'last_base_or_recommended_package']]
[True, True, ... , True]
```
Or some more elegant boolean version of this.  You can literally cut and paste this into the current test for install_packages(), I think.

I am sorry to say I can't help on the libgcc_s issue, though.

It was suggested on the r-devel mailing list, that the problem might be the fact that the 'sparcv9' subdirectory (which contains 64-bit libraries), was in LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

This ended up being [here](http://www.math.ethz.ch/~ggeorg/r-2.10.1.p3.log).  But as it turned out, the issue was #9847 - see the end of the thread referenced in comment 9.

So the only potential problem on this ticket is still the Solaris one.

Thanks, John.  Looks like the problems are quite similar still.

Here is one example of something bad, pretty much identical to in the ticket description.

```

John, I assume that libgcc_s.so.1 exists and everything is like David said in [comment 3](#comment%3A3)?

If changing the various paths doesn't help, I don't know what would.  My guess is that something in the spkg's install is causing us to not find those for some reason, perhaps something to do with the fixes at #8274.  I was hoping I could help more :(
