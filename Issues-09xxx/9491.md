The object of this ticket is to allow an optional argument "alpha"
to set the transparency / opacity for contour_plot, like it exists for
other types of plots.

An initial patch enables an 'opacity' argument to the contour_plot function.
It should be renamed 'alpha' for consistency with its name elsewhere.

Doctests need to be added, and a few examples need to be written.
