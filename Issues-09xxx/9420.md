Hello !!

This patch implements the class SubgraphSearch, which enables one to look for copies of a small graph in a larger one, which is exactly what the method subgraph_search previously did (#8922).

The code is simply inserted inside a new class, with a few other methods to iterate over the occurences, or to count them !

This could have been done with a simple "yield" in Cython, though we may not want to wait until they are implemented ;-)

OK, tested on Debian Linux amd64, and on MacOSX PPC with gcc4.2.
The change seems to be more ideological than adding more functionality/bugfixing.
It would be nice if someone more versed in Sage had a look, whether this is not something 
alien ideologically...
