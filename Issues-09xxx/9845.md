One needs to add

```
#include <time.h> 
```
to `include/Lcommandline_numbertheory.h`
to get lcalc to build on cygwin.

Thanks for fixing much of what I mentioned at #9775.

I'm not sure if we should drop the usual "sanity check" at the top of `spkg-install`.
(Btw, you missed the "p2" in its top comment.)

The first comment regarding `SAGE_DEBUG` and the message in the `else` part aren't current.
(*"Unset SAGE_DEBUG ..."* should read *"Set SAGE_DEBUG to yes ..."*. Though I'd prefer adding `-g` independently of that setting, since it doesn't influence performance, and most other spkgs do so.)

Replacing `-lmpir` by `-lgmp` is perhaps a minor issue; using `$MAKE` instead of `make` (`$(MAKE)` in Lcalc's Makefile itself, too) IMHO not. Unfortunately, the current `spkg/install` also uses `make` instead of `$MAKE` unless `SAGE_PARALLEL_SPKG_BUILD=yes`, which I consider a bug, since adding `-j` is not the only case in which one would set `MAKE`. One should never call `make` inside a Makefile or a script that's executed through *some* "make", because it might be a different one.

<a id='comment:5'></a>
P.S.:

```
all:
#       make print_vars
        make libLfunction.so
        make lcalc
        make examples
#       make find_L
#       make test
```
should simply (for our purposes) be

```
all:    libLfunction.so lcalc examples
```
or even just

```
all:    lcalc examples
```
but one has to add the proper dependency, i.e.:

```
examples: libLfunction.so
        $(CC) $(CCFLAGS) $(INCLUDEFILES) example_programs/example.cc libLfunction.so -o example_programs/example $(GMP_FLAGS)
```

Btw, the `-lmpir` (or `-lgmp`) is only needed if we build a *static* version of `lcalc`, since only the also linked PARI library directly uses it.

Looks as if we no longer need `patches/Lcommandline_elliptic.cc.cygwin` (and `patches/Lcommandline_elliptic.cc.cygwin.diff`), since this patch isn't applied.

Mike (or Jeroen, if you can test this), is this Cygwin patch / addition obsolete:

```C
// SAGE -- used below -- needed for Cygwin.
#ifndef llrint
inline long long int llrint (double x)
{
    long long int llrintres;
    asm
    ("fistpll %0"
    : "=m" (llrintres) : "t" (x) : "st");
    return llrintres;
}
#endif
```

(It's *not* included in the generic patch to `Lcommandline_elliptic.cc`, nor upstream.)

Apart from old typos, an obsolete comment regarding `SAGE_DEBUG`, and the recent changelog headings lacking the upstream (snapshot?) date (20100428), I'm quite happy with the new spkg (i.e., the Sage part; the patched Makefile is still suboptimal, but never mind). :)

If this spkg really contains an upstream snapshot, it is unclear from SPKG.txt when this was taken / actually put into the spkg.

The new p5 spkg successfully installed on Sage 4.6.alpha1 (with `MAKE="make -j32"`) and passed `ptestlong` on Ubuntu 10.04 x86_64, so I'm setting this to "positive review".

Feel free to revert this in case any errors occur on other systems.
