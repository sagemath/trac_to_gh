The title pretty much says it all. There is no way Sage will build with any gcc < 4.0.1. The 'prereq' script will stop any attempt and even if you bypass that stop (by setting the appropriate environment variable), Sage will not build 

I've attached a revised README.txt, which addresses this and

* The fact gcc, g++ and gfortran need to be the same versions. 
* Spelling change of Sparc -> SPARC. 
* Better information about what does and does not work on Solaris.

Same here. I don't feel able to review it. If Dan believes it is an easy review, perhaps he could consider doing it if he has time, as at least two of us don't feel able to do it, and nobody else has stepped up. Yet I am one who agrees this would be a useful addition to Sage. The current system for such files is a bit silly.
