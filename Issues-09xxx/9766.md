## Changelog

### cliquer-1.2.p6 (19 August 2010)
 * Fixed Trac #8279 to make the cliquer spkg work on Cygwin with the Sage library.

### cliquer-1.2.p5 Mike Hansen (15 February 2010)
 * Fixed Trac #8279 to make the cliquer spkg work on Cygwin with the Sage library.
```

It seems you have just copied the previous entry and incremented the patch level. 

You need to put your own name and date, along with the change you made - but I think you know that. 

Also the commit message does not have the trac number in it. 

You should take the opportunity to add the sections from SPKG.txt which are missing - namely:

```
## Dependencies

List the dependencies here

## Special Update/Build Instructions

List patches that need to be applied and what they do

```

See 
http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/producing_spkgs.html#creating-a-new-spkg

It wont take you long to find out the dependcies, and if there are no special build instructions, just put 

```
## Special Update/Build Instructions
 * None
```

* State you added the `Special Update/Build Instructions` and `Dependencies` to SPKG.txt which were previously missing.

As such, it might be wise to put a note of this fact - one suggestion is below. 

```
## Special Update/Build Instructions
 * TODO - Add an spkg-check file - see #9767

Once that is done, I expect to be able to give it a positive review.

I have not had a "stable" internet connection for several weeks now (travelling -- I access internet through coffes, and when I am lucky in the hotels I stay in if they have a connection), and I will not be able to update this spkg until at least one week and a half. Sorry for that.

On the technical side David, we have known for a long time that we view development very differently. I try not to forget that you want Sage to be a "professionnal" software, with all the necessary -- what I call -- administration (standard procedures for modification of the code, correct documentation, supporting many platforms, changelogs, etc...). Even though it very often seems "too much" for my way of doing, I have two things to admit :

* You think Sage will be improved through all this, and your intent is good
* It requires a lot of work, which you often do yourself

In the end, even though I have a different way to work, it sounds like we are both trying to work on the same piece of (great) software, as efficiently as we can. This is why I am asking this question to a fellow developper : 

There are necessary things in all this administration, to ensure that everything stays correct (doctests, spkg-checks, ...), or documented, or logged. But don't you think somethings goes really wrong when it takes 2 weeks, 2 persons, and 30 minutes or 1 hour of cumulated worktime to add an url to a file ?

How do you think we could simplify these things ? I am confident any mean you could name would never harm Sage's reliability.

I promise you will have this spkg updated with the modifications you requested as soon as I have a -- real -- internet connection. I may even be able to find a way to send it tomorrow ! :-)

Sorry to hear that. I often lose mine from home, and it really annoying. Particularly if I have a chess game scheduled as part of a team. Failure to play lets the whole team down, so I have on several occasions made a 90 mile round-trip to go to my fathers, use his internet, then come home. There's not even a local internet cafe here.

Yes.

I believe I have spoke to you about the *cost of fixing bugs*. Basically, the earlier a bug is caught, the less expensive it it to fix. In the case of Sage, we are primarily talking about peoples time. Had the documentation error been picked up early, a lot less of peoples time would have been wasted. 

That's why I've tried to get over to you the point that you should spend you time stopping the bugs in the first place, as it's less time consuming to do that, than it is to fix bugs when they are reported.

Yes, that looks fine. You should have put the patch on the trac server, but I will do that for you. I'm giving it positive review. 

As a matter of interest, are you aware of any reason the package should not be updated to the latest, which is 1.2.1? If not, I'll update the package version at the same time as adding the test code to #9767.

I must have created it myself somehow. 

Anyway, it has gone now.

I think it's worth adding a note (in parentheses) to the *Dependencies* section that some package['s ordinary build] does *not* depend on `xy` especially if (e.g) the upstream contains source files for / files (usually) to be processed by `xy`, or in cases where the package *previously* depended on some package(s), but no longer does. (And even if there erroneously was some dependency listed in `spkg/standard/deps`.)

Typical candidates for `xy` are Python, Perl, lex/flex, yacc/bison etc. (Autotools should not be listed.)

Also, some packages only do *not* depend on some others (e.g. libraries) *in Sage* just because of the way we configure, patch or build / install them. IMHO as well worth a note.
