`SPKG.txt` excerpt from the *modified* spkg:

```
=== polybori-0.6.4.p2 (Leif Leonhardy, July 10th, 2010) ===
 * Removed Michael Abshoff from maintainer list (see #7738)
 * Deleted Boost source tree again since it was split off into a separate
   spkg (see below, 0.5.rc.p7), modified spkg-install accordingly
 * Deleted M4RI source tree, because it is a standard Sage package
 * Little clean-up and minor fixes in patches/custom.py
   - Note that CFLAGS etc. are still *overwritten* rather than modified!
 * Updated "Dependencies" section above
```

Slightly more readable:
* Removed *Michael Abshoff* from maintainer list (see #7738)
* Deleted Boost source tree again since it was split off into a separate
  spkg (see below, 0.5.rc.p7), modified `spkg-install` accordingly
* Deleted M4RI source tree, because it is a standard Sage package
* Little clean-up and minor fixes in `patches/custom.py`
  - Note that `CFLAGS` etc. are still **overwritten** rather than modified!
* Updated *"Dependencies"* section above


During upgrade to 0.6.x, the Boost source unintentionally got in again. The new spkg is about 1.7MB, i.e. 300KB smaller.

---

**The new PolyBoRi 0.6.4.p2 spkg is [here](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/schilly/sage/spkg/polybori-0.6.4.p2.spkg).**

(To test *the patch*, the directories have to be removed manually, since the attached patch doesn't delete them from 0.6.4.p1; see [comment below](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/9472#comment:1).)

---

Since PolyBoRi also uses GD, `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/standard/deps` should be updated (but there seem to have been no issues with that in the past).

I.e., to remove the Boost and M4RI source trees, do:

rm -rv polybori-0.6.4.p1/src/polybori-0.6.4/M4RI
```

I've tested the spkg with Sage 4.5.alpha4 (with SageNB 0.8.1 and zodb3 3.7.0.p4) on Ubuntu 9.04 x86_64; all tests, including long ones, passed.

Since "there seem to have been no issues with that [the missing GD dependency] in the past" and I'm nearly ready to release the current trial 4.5.3.alpha0, I've opened #9712 and suggest that we merge it in 4.5.3.alpha1.

I assume the GD change itself is already reviewed, so I can review #9712 fairly quickly.  Or, if I have a spare moment, I'll post a new `deps` and `deps.diff`.

(Ticket #9433 should help with these types of changes.)

Karl-Dieter (kcrisman) has just reported on sage-release updating from 4.5.2 to 4.5.3.alpha0 failed on MacOS X 10.6 because this new PolyBoRi package failed to build:

```
...
Checking for C library m4ri... no
Checking for C header file gd.h... yes
Checking for C library gd... no
Symlinking to M4RI/m4ri ...
OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory:
  File "/Users/.../sage-4.5.2/spkg/build/polybori-0.6.4.p2/src/
polybori-0.6.4/SConstruct", line 421:

Error building PolyBoRi.
 
real	0m1.425s
user	0m0.860s
sys	0m0.473s
sage: An error occurred while installing polybori-0.6.4.p2

```

I'll open a new ticket for that shortly (unless someone else is faster).
