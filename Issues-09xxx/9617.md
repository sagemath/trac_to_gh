This error has been noticed throuugh #9584

After taking a look at the corresponding part of the code, *OF COURSE* something needed to be changedm but to be honest I have no inkling why Sage did not report this as an error : I was adding str(k) in a string while k.... was not defined ? O_o

(32-bit machine/Pentium 4 Prescott)

That means the bug causing the non-termination sits somewhere in the Sage library interface to GLPK.

All files were generated on the 64-bit machine; I've not yet tried to generate them on the 32-bit machine (they might differ, so I'll check that later).

(The LP/MPS files of that example are too big to upload them here, approx. 260KB.)

Weird O_o

Short of these names, there is really no difference between the code used to produce the file and the one building the data structure for GLPK. Did you use the very Random Graph which produced timeouts before, or generated a different one ?

For example the pretty pictures displayed there :

stop at step 10. The reason is that the LP I wrote for 12 was still running after 4 days.

Yes, except for the variable and constraint names, which is why I believe something goes wrong in constructing the problem on the 32-bit machine (and this should be observable through differences in the generated files).

> Did you use the very Random Graph which produced timeouts before, or generated a different one ?

I did generate files for all examples, the logs above are from exactly the 30-vertices random graph one. (I made sure they are the same on both machines by adding some more doctests).

Hello !!!

By carefully looking at the two logs, the one you just gave and the one given by John on #9584, I noticed a difference, even though all the number of entries, lines/etc were the same. Yours 

```

His

```
+  1589: mip =     not found yet <=              +inf        (1; 0)
```

And all the following inequalities are reversed... Well, it sounds like you are working on a minimization problem, while John his working on a maximization problem. That's when I remembered a problem I had had with GLPK a long time ago when using it through the command-line (but perhaps it was CPLEX or CBC, I do not remember). At least one of them was completely ignoring the direction of the optimization given in the file, and only behaved nicely when given the good flag... Could you give it a try with one of those ?

I am really sorry but I can not do it myself, I am travelling these days and unable to find any place where I could use my own computer ^^;

This is really funny. I've now exported the MPS file on the 32-bit machine, too.

While the doctest itself did not terminate (at least not within reasonable time, so I manually killed the orphan process after the time-out), running `glpsol` on the exported (in theory identical) problem succeeds rather quickly:

Hmmm, even more weird (i.e. unexpected, but correct), the exported MPS files on both machines are identical; running `glpsol` with `--min` or `--max` on this file (on the 32-bit machine) succeeds in almost the same time, though `p.solve()` in the doctest (which should do nearly the same, acting on the same problem) does *not* terminate (I've added some doctests to ensure e.g. that the random graph is the same as on the other machine):
