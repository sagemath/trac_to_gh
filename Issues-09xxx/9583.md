```
t2.math: seems to build successfully, but I get the following when I
try to start sage:

------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred in Sage.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* component
of Sage has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
or is not properly wrapped with _sig_on, _sig_off.
You might want to run Sage under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
Sage will now terminate (sorry).
------------------------------------------------------------

I haven't tried to debug this.  I don't know how to use gdb, in any
case.  Any suggestions about what the problem might be?  You can find
the build in /scratch/palmieri/.

I've seen this, too, with

```sh
$ env MAKE="make -j64" SAGE_PARALLEL_SPKG_BUILD="yes" make build
```
(I've deleted the build to make room in t2's /scratch.)

If it helps:  We merged only sage library patches (no new spkgs) in 4.5.2.alpha0.

I just checked if anything odd had happened on 't2'. There are no obvious errors in the log file - just the usual ones related to the fact 'disk.math' has been mis-configured.

No messages today, so its probably not a problem on 't2'.

I got the same problem on a SPARC of mine, but managed to quite easily find the problem running 

```
sage -gdb
```

Here we can see what line  causes the problem, though I expect it is auto generated by Cython, so knowing which line of python it is might be more difficult. 

```
drkirkby@redstart:~/32/sage-4.5.2.alpha0$ ./sage -gdb

There, we have\n\n```\n    from sage.libs.singular.singular import _saved_options \n    self.load(_saved_options)\n```\n\nWhere does _saved_options come from?\n\n_saved_options is defined in line 51 of sage/libs/singular/singular.pyx. It is immediately initialised with some value, which I explicitly did in order to *prevent* a segfault caused by accessing an uninitialised C-variable. But the true initialisation (with the actual value used by libsingular) is then done at line 675.\n\nIn particular, `value[2]` in the segfaulting line should be initialised to the value 0. So, I don't see why it should be a problem to assign this to the int variable `Kstd1_mu`.\n\nI am not familiar with t2, and I don't know whether I would be able to build sage on it (I don't even know if I have an account). So, could you please test (by adding print commands in the appropriate places or so):\n\n1. Is _save_value indeed initialised in line 51 of sage/libs/singular/singular.pyx?\n2. Is the true initialisation in line 675 of sage/libs/singular/singular.pyx executed?\n3. What is the argument of the `load` function right before it segfaults? It should be a list of three int, the last two being zero.\n4. Could it be that I simply forgot to say `global _saved_options` before line 51 of sage/libs/singular/singular.pyx?\n\nCheers,\nSimon",

Hi!

Replying to [mpatel](#comment%3A3):
> Bisection indicates that #1396 is the source of the problem:


Then I think I should explain what portion of that patch I think might be related, and my reasons for writing it.

As David find out using `sage -gdb`, the segfault occurs in `sage.libs.singular.option.LibSingularOptions_abstract.load`, and the C-code in the traceback suggests that it is exactly in line 286 of the Cython file,

```
Kstd1_mu  = value[2] 
```

What happens at startup?

In line 666 of option.pyx, some `LibSingularOptions` object is created, and in line 667, the method `reset_default()` is called. There, we have

```
    from sage.libs.singular.singular import _saved_options 
    self.load(_saved_options)
```

Where does _saved_options come from?

_saved_options is defined in line 51 of sage/libs/singular/singular.pyx. It is immediately initialised with some value, which I explicitly did in order to *prevent* a segfault caused by accessing an uninitialised C-variable. But the true initialisation (with the actual value used by libsingular) is then done at line 675.

In particular, `value[2]` in the segfaulting line should be initialised to the value 0. So, I don't see why it should be a problem to assign this to the int variable `Kstd1_mu`.

I am not familiar with t2, and I don't know whether I would be able to build sage on it (I don't even know if I have an account). So, could you please test (by adding print commands in the appropriate places or so):

1. Is _save_value indeed initialised in line 51 of sage/libs/singular/singular.pyx?
2. Is the true initialisation in line 675 of sage/libs/singular/singular.pyx executed?
3. What is the argument of the `load` function right before it segfaults? It should be a list of three int, the last two being zero.
4. Could it be that I simply forgot to say `global _saved_options` before line 51 of sage/libs/singular/singular.pyx?

Cheers,
Simon

I modified the "load" method to add some print statements:

```
    def load(self, value=None):
        if value == None:
            value = (None,0,0)
        self.global_options[0] = int(value[0])
        global Kstd1_deg
        global Kstd1_mu

        print value[0], value[1], value[2]

        Kstd1_deg = value[1]
        print "Kstd1_deg defined"
        print Kstd1_deg

        Kstd1_mu  = value[2]

        print "Kstd1_mu defined"
        print Kstd1_mu
```
Then when I run "sage -br", I get this: it's not happy about setting `Kstd1_mu`:

```

Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred in Sage.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* component
of Sage has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
or is not properly wrapped with _sig_on, _sig_off.
You might want to run Sage under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
Sage will now terminate (sorry).
------------------------------------------------------------
```
I tried changing the assignment for Kstd1_mu to `Kstd1_mu = 0` but it didn't help.

In the file `SAGE_ROOT/local/include/singular/kstd1.h`, the variables `Kstd1_deg` and `Kstd1_mu` are defined differently; could that be causing the problem?

```
extern int LazyPass,LazyDegree,mu,Kstd1_deg;
#define Kstd1_mu mu
```

As far as using t2, I think if you have an account on sage.math, you have one on t2.math, same password, same home directory.  Different /scratch directory.  My build is in /scratch/palmieri/sage..., and it should be world-readable.

Hi John!

Yes, I already found out that indeed I have an account on t2.math. I could see only part of the advices, but at least I added a .profile in my home dictionary containing

```
if [ `uname -n` = t2 ] ; then
   . /usr/local/gcc-4.4.1-sun-linker/gcc441sun
fi
```

Then, I unpacked the pre-built sage in some directory of mine (but not in /scratch, perhaps that would have been better), and Sage started.

Yes, this is something that we have been wondering about in Kaiserslautern at Sage Days 23.5.

My understanding is that the line `#define Kstd1_mu mu` has the same effect as replacing `Kstd1_mu` by `mu` in any C-file that includes the header `kstd1.h` - in particular, this should also hold for the Cython-generated C-files. Hans Schönemann (Singular developer) agreed that this should not be a problem. And I used similar `#define` tricks myself repeatedly, so far without problem. 

But this was all using gcc -- Could it be that t2/Sun compiler behave differently in that regard?

However, I would expect -- if `kstd1.h` really is to blame for it - that Singular would not build. Recall that this is a file verbously taken from Singular.

Cheers,

Simon

The compiler used to build Sage on t2.math.washington.edu is gcc. The Sun compilers are much stricter than gcc, and will not loads of Sage. So this code is presenting a problem with gcc. 

If I build Sage 64-bit on Solaris SPARC it dumps core very easily. I've noticed the errors often seem to be singular related. Also, if I load a library for debugging, by the time we have got to the

prompt, there is already a couple of memory leaks. But those should not cause a crash, unless they exhaust too much memory, which I don't think they will do. But it does make me a bit suspicious of the Singular/Sage combination. 

One thing worth doing is looking at compiler warnings. There are tons of them in Sage, but perhaps one near this problem might give us a clue.

What is certainly not a good idea is that the **C** compiler gcc is being invoked to compile a **C++** program. Since option.cpp is a C++ file, it should be compiled with g++, not gcc. 

I doubt that would be extensively checked by the gcc developers. It may be a case of you get away with it on some platforms some of the time, but not all platforms all of the time.

So, the crucial question is: Why is Cython generating a C++ file rather than a C file?

Does it generate C++ since it is linked against Singular sources (which ostensibly are C++)?

And what happens if one invokes g++ rather then gcc on the Cython-generated code?

Presumably because in devel/sage/module_list.py, it says

```
    Extension('sage.libs.singular.option',
              sources = ['sage/libs/singular/option.pyx'],
              libraries = ['m', 'readline', 'singular', 'givaro', 'gmpxx', 'gmp'],
              language="c++",
              include_dirs = [SAGE_ROOT +'/local/include/singular'],
              depends = [SAGE_ROOT + "/local/include/libsingular.h"]),
```
Note the "language" line.

> libpari-gmp.so.2 also exports a mu symbol, by the way. But it's a function, not data, so assigning to that could cause that crash.


That's interesting; could that be the problem?  What can we do to fix it?

If I comment out all assignments to `Kstd1_mu`, then Sage starts and for the directory sage/libs/singular, there is only one doctest failure:

Not surprising, since it looks setting the multiplicative bound wants to set `Kstd1_mu`.

Is something like this an option, if we can't fix the whole problem?

Bugs that only show on one system are quite common. That's one of the big advantages in testing on multiple platforms. I have hit many such bugs over the years.

I actually find that there are some bugs related to Singular and Pari that show up on 64-bit Solaris. I suspect they are genuine bugs and could cause problems on other system, but just have not to date

Usage of `Kstd1_mu` was introduced by my patch at #1396. The aim of that patch was to make *all* Singular options available to libsingular. Two of Singular's options involve an int parameter: `degBound` and `multBound`. I used the former a lot, and it is kind of relieving that it doesn't cause a problem here. The latter, however, was new to me until two weeks ago. 

So, personally, I'd say that your suggestion could be a short term solution. But still, I'd like to see all Singular options available in libsingular.

I'd prefer to first test whether wjp's solution works.

`@`wjp and `@`malb:
option.pyx links against certain files of Singular, located in `SAGE_LOCAL`, if I'm not mistaken. Will installing the new spkg automatically put these files in place? Or do you say that the spkg actually fixes the problem already?

One general question: Is t2 really so slow, or am I getting a wrong impression? After touching option.pyx, it took about an hour to do `sage -br`.

Cheers, Simon

Building in t2's `/scratch` should help, but it really is slow for our purposes.  It should also help to use, e.g.,

```sh
$ env MAKE="make -j48" ./sage -br

Is it really "changning variable names"? If I understood correctly, Singular does not use the variable name `mu` - it consistently uses `Kstd1_mu`, and so do I. So, I wouldn't call it  "changing variable names" but "clearifying a variable definition".

If my understanding is correct, 

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/malb/spkgs/singular-3-1-1-4.spkg

which is the latest release, does not define Kstd1_mu to be mu, so this particular problem should not exist. However, since `singular-3-1-1-4.spkg` has not been checked properly on 't2', there may be other problems. 

It seems to me that the policy the release managers adopt regarding the updating of .spkg files could have a major impact on what happens on this ticket.

Did the patch from #1396 fix any bugs or failing doctests, or did it only add new functionality? If it only added new functionality, I would really prefer to back it out for now.

By the way, the proper way in Mercurial to "undo" a changeset is the `backout` command. Here's how you can test 4.5.2.alpha0 without #1396:

* build 4.5.2.alpha0
* make a new branch
* in that branch, do `hg backout --merge 14701` 
* do `hg commit` to commit the result of the merge
* test Sage as usual

See http://hgbook.red-bean.com/read/finding-and-fixing-mistakes.html#id392287 for more info. I'm currently testing 4.5.2.alpha0 on t2.math after doing the above.

Since #1396 didn't fix any bugs or other failures, and since I'm not brave enough to merge any more spkgs than I already have, for 4.5.2 I propose that we backout attachment:trac1396-singular_options.2.patch. I will open a new ticket, in which we can re-merge #1396.

The patch here was obtained by using `hg backout`, so if we trust Mercurial, it will exactly reverse the patch from #1396.

I get no new long doctest failures.  Also,

```sh
$ cd SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage
$ wget http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/raw-attachment/ticket/1396/trac1396-singular_options.2.patch
$ wget http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/raw-attachment/ticket/9583/trac_9583.patch
$ hg stat

patching file sage/libs/singular/option.pyx
patching file sage/libs/singular/singular-cdefs.pxi
