```
## Build environment
* Sun Ultra 27 3.33 GHz Intel W3580 Xeon. Quad core. 8 threads. 12 GB RAM
* OpenSolaris 2009.06 snv_111b X86
* Sage 4.4.2
* gcc 4.4.4

## How gcc 4.4.4 was configured
Since the configuration of gcc is fairly critical on OpenSolaris, here's how it was built. 

```
drkirkby@hawk:~/sage-4.4.2$ gcc -v
Using built-in specs.
Target: i386-pc-solaris2.11
Configured with: ../gcc-4.4.4/configure --prefix=/usr/local/gcc-4.4.4 --with-as=/usr/local/binutils-2.20/bin/as --with-ld=/usr/ccs/bin/ld --with-gmp=/usr/local --with-mpfr=/usr/local
Thread model: posix
gcc version 4.4.4 (GCC) 
```

gcc 4.3.4 was failing to build iconv. 

## The problem

ERROR installing SAGE

```

## Likely cause
It looks as though the -m64 option is not getting through to the library. Since that uses SCons to build, and I don't understand SCons (and very few people seem to), this could be a pig to fix.

I'm attaching a log file which shows that this patch allows the build progress to go a long way. The log file for the build of the library `spkg/logs/sage-4.5.alpha1.log` is 958 KB in size, so clearly this gets a long way, where without the 4 lines

```
if env['PLATFORM'] != "darwin" and os.environ['SAGE64']=="yes": 
    env.Append( CFLAGS="-O2 -g -m64" ) 
    env.Append( CXXFLAGS="-O2 -g -m64" ) 
    env.Append( LINKFLAGS="-m64" ) 
```

the build fails after only 40 lines or so. 

There are some remaining issues to resolve, but this patch, which is only implemented if SAGE64 is set to yes and the operating system is **not** OS X, goes a long way towards helping a 64-bit port to OpenSolaris.

Thank you very much. With this, patch applied, along with 

* Applying #9399
* Faking the install of maxima by touching spkg/installed/maxima-$version
* Faking the install of R by touching /spkg/installed/R-$version

I'm able to get a 64-bit build on OpenSolaris. It does however crash at startup, so the port is not complete! But it is getting pretty close I think.

I've tested this on OS X, and it works fine:

I agree your solution was cleaner than mine, but the reason I wrote it the way I did, was to guarantee that it could have no effect on OS X. 

I've also tested it on Linux (sage.math).
