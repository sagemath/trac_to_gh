I interleaved `find -name core -type f` with executing the examples in `genus2reduction.py` in an interactive Sage session.  I see the core file only *after* I exit Sage, which ends with

```
Exiting Sage (CPU time 0m0.17s, Wall time 2m6.89s).
Exiting spawned Genus2reduction process.
```
Also, [here is the log](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mpatel/trac/9738/genus2reduction-21918-22537264-2.log) I  find in `DOT_SAGE/pexpect_logs/` after

I don't think there is a problem, this issue is independent of #9343 and #9591 (we just have to rename the spkg at #9591 if this gets merged first).

My patch also makes genus2reduction exit when EOF is encountered in the standard input.

No objections.  If you think this patch can make it into sage-4.5.3, go ahead and do it.  If we merge it in sage-4.6, it would be better suited in #9591.
