I don't think there is a problem, this issue is independent of #9343 and #9591 (we just have to rename the spkg at #9591 if this gets merged first).

No objections.  If you think this patch can make it into sage-4.5.3, go ahead and do it.  If we merge it in sage-4.6, it would be better suited in #9591.
