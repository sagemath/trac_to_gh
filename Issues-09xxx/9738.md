I don't think there is a problem, this issue is independent of #9343 and #9591 (we just have to rename the spkg at #9591 if this gets merged first).

I think mpatel's patch fixes the problem but does not address the real issue here, namely that PARI by default catches various signals and "handles" them.  But this is not what we want here.  Not making PARI install signal handlers solves the issue.

My patch also makes genus2reduction exit when EOF is encountered in the standard input.

Jeroen's patch is definitely better than mine.  Thanks!

Whether I run the doctest above or run `genus2reduction` directly from the shell and press ctrl-c/d, the program quits with no core dump.  Evaluating `genus2reduction.console()` in the Sage console and pressing ctrl-c/d returns me to the `sage:` prompt.

`Genus2reduction_expect` in `genus2reduction.py` still uses its base class' `Expect._quit_string`, which returns "quit", but I think we can leave that alone(?).

Are there any objections to making a new spkg here with Jeroen's patch?  If we do, we should put `genus2reduction.c` under version control.  Although I'm averse to putting too many logically different spkg changes in one ticket, I'll understand if we roll the changes here into #9591 and make this ticket a virtual blocker for an otherwise PARI-focused Sage 4.6.

No objections.  If you think this patch can make it into sage-4.5.3, go ahead and do it.  If we merge it in sage-4.6, it would be better suited in #9591.
