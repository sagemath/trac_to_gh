I interleaved `find -name core -type f` with executing the examples in `genus2reduction.py` in an interactive Sage session.  I see the core file only *after* I exit Sage, which ends with

```
Exiting Sage (CPU time 0m0.17s, Wall time 2m6.89s).
Exiting spawned Genus2reduction process.
```
Also, [here is the log](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mpatel/trac/9738/genus2reduction-21918-22537264-2.log) I  find in `DOT_SAGE/pexpect_logs/` after

I don't think there is a problem, this issue is independent of #9343 and #9591 (we just have to rename the spkg at #9591 if this gets merged first).

I think mpatel's patch fixes the problem but does not address the real issue here, namely that PARI by default catches various signals and "handles" them.  But this is not what we want here.  Not making PARI install signal handlers solves the issue.

My patch also makes genus2reduction exit when EOF is encountered in the standard input.
