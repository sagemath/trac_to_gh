If you create a polynomial in one variable over a finite field and ask for the denominator, then the answer you get has the wrong type when the polynomial is the zero polynomial.  Here's an example:

```
sage: R.<t> = GF(5)['t']
sage: x = R(0)
sage: type(x.denominator())
<type 'int'>
```

If the element of the ring is zero or the base_ring does not have a denominator function, the code returned the "wrong 1", either int 1 or polynomial 1. The patch correct this.

The problem is in the function weak_popov_form() in sage/rings/matrix/matrix_misc.py  (which was only merged into Sage receontly -- and I was, by chance, its reviewer).  There one has matrices of polynomials over fields and the code tries to clear denominators, by forming the LCM of the denominators;  and that now fails when those denominators are all equal to 1 in a finite field!

Rather than mess with the weakpopov form code, this could be solved if there was an lcm function for finite field elements which always returned 1 (except lcm(0,0)=0, perhaps).

Well, 

The issue of adding a lcm function for finite fields has some problems associated:

- Except is degenerate cases, all elements are units, so the lcm being 1 is not nonsense.

- The problem is that currently, sage already does some lcm for finite fields if the elements can be coerced to ZZ.

```
sage: m = GF(5)
sage: a= m(4)
sage: lcm(a,a)
4
```

So this approach will add a backwards incompatibility at least.

Well spotted!  I think that this current behavour is a bug:

```
sage: a = GF(5)(4)
sage: type(a)
<type 'sage.rings.finite_rings.integer_mod.IntegerMod_int'>
sage: lcm(a,a)
4
sage: type(lcm(a,a))
<type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>
```
since it makes no mathematical sense at all.  It's the same for gcd:

```
sage: gcd(a,a)
4
sage: type(gcd(a,a))
<type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>
```
Both of these would not happen if finite field elements have gcd and lcm methods, and in my opinion that would be better.

Someone should try to implement this and do a full test to see if any existing code (tests) is broken.  I hope not -- I cannot imagine anyone relying on this rather crazy behaviour.

Attachment [weak-popof-form.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket9063/weak-popof-form.patch) by @lftabera created at 2010-09-03 11:37:47

I have attached another patch that solves the problem in weak_popov_form.

I follow the python mantra of 'explicit better than implicit'. The algorithm expects as entries a matrix with rational functions as entries.

If the entries are polynomials, then the algorithm may fail because the denominators will be elements in a field and currently sage does not consider this case for all fields.

Now, the algorithm first transforms the input matrix to a matrix with rational functions as entries which is the domain the algorithm is expected to work. The denominators will then be polynomials and the algorithm will work as expected.

I have added a doctest to check that the output is the same in the polynomial and rational function case.

As a side effect, I correct a typo in the documentation of weak_popov_form. The documentation asserts that the output is (W, N, t) where W and N are matrices of rational functions. In fact, N is a matrix of polynomials.

Both patches can be applied in any order. With this patch bug #9819 does not apply.

AFAICT, the `weak_popov_form` function clears the denominators to work over the polynomial ring instead of the fraction field. When a matrix over the polynomial ring is given, it seems inefficient to first coerce all entries to the fraction field, then find the denominator `1` and go back to the polynomials we were given.

Can't we just avoid clearing the denominators if `R` (in the first line) is a field (and not call `lcm()`)?

Attachment [weak-popof-form.2.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket9063/weak-popof-form.2.patch) by @lftabera created at 2010-10-08 16:08:52

I have added a new patch to weak_popov_form so it does not perform any cleaning of denominadors when the matrix has polynomial entries.

Apply:


trac_9063.patch

weak-popof-form.2.patch

In any order
