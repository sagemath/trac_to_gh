The dependency should have been #9156 (which is a tiny, now merged, ticket) rather than #9165. 

This still needs work in two ways.

**Attachment:** [9193-part4-proveable.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9193/9193-part4-proveable.patch.gz)

Unfortunately, this is wrong, since the coefficients of 1 and T have
to be 0.0000?.  However, the output *is* correct to 10 bits of
precision, so the correct fix is just to truncate.::

    sage: L = LFunction(EllipticCurve('389a'))
    sage: L.taylor_series(RealField(10)(1), 3, proof=True)
    -0.00002125? + 0.00001204?*T + 0.75933?*T^2 - 0.43032?*T^3 + O(T^4)
