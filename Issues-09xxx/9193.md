The dependency should have been #9156 (which is a tiny, now merged, ticket) rather than #9165. 

This still needs work in two ways. Firstly, it needs more doctests/documentation (though most of the important/tricky functions are already done), and there is also a bug in computing the tail of the G-function summation that I'm still tracking down. I did some work towards this during Sage Days 22, and even thought about it a touch this week, but haven't quite gotten to the bottom of it.

All patches apply (with a minor rebase) and mostly work.  However, there is one bug. 

```
Unfortunately, this is wrong, since the coefficients of 1 and T have
to be 0.0000?.  However, the output *is* correct to 10 bits of
precision, so the correct fix is just to truncate.::

    sage: L = LFunction(EllipticCurve('389a'))
    sage: L.taylor_series(RealField(10)(1), 3, proof=True)
    -0.00002125? + 0.00001204?*T + 0.75933?*T^2 - 0.43032?*T^3 + O(T^4)
