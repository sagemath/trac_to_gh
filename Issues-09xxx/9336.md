Just one little niggle: according to the developer's guide, code like

```
        try: 
            return self.list()[0] 
        except: 
            raise ValueError, "Set is empty"
```
(lines 91 to 94 in the patched morphism.py) should be avoided.  Better would be

```
        try: 
            return self[0] 
        except IndexError: 
            raise ValueError, "Set is empty"
