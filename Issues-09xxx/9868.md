The highest-level ResT files for 3d plotting are ... not so informative.  See for instance [this](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/sage/plot/plot3d/examples.html) page.

This ticket would make the top-level 3d plotting page look as nice as [this](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/sage/plot/plot.html) one, with lots of discussion about options - and in particular putting text on a 3D plot, since [this](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/46b1fef4c02dc650/c25cdb155dcccc56?show_docid=c25cdb155dcccc56&pli=1) thread mentioned it.

Can you clarify what you mean by that?  Do you mean a `.3d()` method (or whatever it's called)?  Or do you mean like how `point` or `line` know whether there are two or three coordinates?
