libm4ri is not respecting SAGE_FAT_BINARY
on x86-Linux, specifically sse3 if available
will be used.

A mercurial patch is attached which when
SAGE_FAT_BINARY="yes", comments out the
configure test for sse3 - so configure reports
that sse3 does not exist on the machine.

**Assignee:** Mariah Lenox

**Author:** Mariah Lenox

**Upstream:** Reported upstream. Developers acknowledge bug.

Hi, upstream here

I think we should add an option to M4RI to not check for SSE instead. I can provide an updated M4RI later this week or next week the latest.
