Applied fine to 4.5.2 on 32bit ubuntu 10.04 and passed sage -testall.

Are there other tests needed, such as solaris or cygwin?

I also checked that the SPKG.txt and
spkg-install file follow the conventions in 
http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/producing_spkgs.html#creating-a-new-spkg

I have emailed D Kirkby separately regarding the solaris issue. I'm
about to give this a positive review after hearing back from him.

I've updated the Author(s) and Reviewer(s) fields.  Please correct them, if I'm wrong.

Mike, Minh, or William, could one of you merge this package into the optional spkg repository?  I don't have the privileges to do this.
