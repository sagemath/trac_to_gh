Applied fine to 4.5.2 on 32bit ubuntu 10.04 and passed sage -testall.

Are there other tests needed, such as solaris or cygwin?

I also checked that the SPKG.txt and
spkg-install file follow the conventions in 
http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/producing_spkgs.html#creating-a-new-spkg

I have emailed D Kirkby separately regarding the solaris issue. I'm
about to give this a positive review after hearing back from him.

Mike, Minh, or William, could one of you merge this package into the optional spkg repository?  I don't have the privileges to do this.
