This patch allows computing dual cones, including non-strictly convex and non-full-dimensional cases. 

The actual work is done in `facet_normals` which now works for non-strictly convex cones as well. The method `base_extend` for quotient lattices was added during one of the implementation attempts and I left it for future use as well (the hope was to create cones in quotient lattices, but it does not work yet).

There is still a dimension 6 limitation stemming from PALP for computing duals and facet normals. This is still our best option for low dimension, but perhaps it would be nice if `facet_normals` caught the exception when PALP does not work and used polyhedra module in this case. Then computing the dual cone and face lattices should work automatically.

See #9604 for dependencies.

I don't like that your lattice now needs to have `self.dual()` implemented:

```
sage: c = Cone([(1,0), [0,1]], lattice = ZZ^2)
sage: c.facet_normals()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This essentially limits you to `ToricLattice`s now. I think it would be good for `factet_normals()` to use the same lattice otherwise, so `ZZ^n` works as well. 

The rest looks good!

Great additions for the dual lattice and documentation clarifications!

Just a couple of suggestions: can we
* name the method `dual_lattice` instead of `lattice_dual` and
* add to the documentation of this method itself an explanation that "dual lattice" is the same as "just lattice" if it does not have `dual()` method?
