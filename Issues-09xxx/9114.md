At #9108, it was reported that the doc tests for symmetric ideals time out on some machines. As a quick solution, it was suggested to simply mark them as 'long'.

Here, I replace the offensive test (it is only one) by something more easy, that is still instructive.

At this occasion, I tried to improve other aspects of the doc strings as well, e.g., I tried to shorten the lines and to adhere to the standards in describing optional arguments.

The attached patch is relative to #9108, which already has a positive review. The new patch replaces the doc test that was marked 'long' in #9108.

**Assignee:** Simon King

Looks fine to me; it builds and passes tests under 4.4.4.alpha0, the tests pass in a reasonable length of time (25 seconds on my machine, as opposed to 17 seconds without "-long" and a ridiculously long time with "-long"). Documentation builds OK and looks good.

There is one minor problem: quite a few doctests are marked with "# indirect doc test" (with space), while the coverage script looks for "# indirect doctest".

Simon: if you are happy with the changes in my reviewer patch, then feel free to put the status to "positive review".

I am happy with it! So, I changed that status to "positive review", and inserted your name as reviewer.
