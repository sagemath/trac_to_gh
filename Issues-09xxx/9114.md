At #9108, it was reported that the doc tests for symmetric ideals time out on some machines. As a quick solution, it was suggested to simply mark them as 'long'.

Here, I replace the offensive test (it is only one) by something more easy, that is still instructive.

At this occasion, I tried to improve other aspects of the doc strings as well, e.g., I tried to shorten the lines and to adhere to the standards in describing optional arguments.

The attached patch is relative to #9108, which already has a positive review. The new patch replaces the doc test that was marked 'long' in #9108.

I am happy with it! So, I changed that status to "positive review", and inserted your name as reviewer.

Best regards,
