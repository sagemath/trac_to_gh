I don't know how this might be done, but 

```
for n in range(1,10): 
    sum(k, k, 1, n) 
```
doesn't work, while 

```
for n in [1..10]:
    sum(k,k,1,n)
```
does.  We need to fix

```
int(3)._maxima_()
AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute '_maxima_'
```

Duplicate of #9393.

<a id='comment:1'></a>the particular error that arises here is raised in sage/calculus/calculus.pyc line 501:

```
sum  = "'sum(%s, %s, %s, %s)" % tuple([repr(expr._maxima_()) for expr in (expression, v, a, b)])
```
One could fix this one by first coercing a,b into SR. As an example:

```
sage: SR(int(1))._maxima_()
1
```
This code looks rather convoluted to me anyway: Convert to maxima, take string representative, paste together and then simplify? Shouldn't the whole sum first be turned into a pynac sum expression, the whole thing converted to maxima, simplified, and then cast back?

```
sage: var("x,a,b")                       # this is just because I don't know
sage: SUM=sum(sin(x^2),x,a,b).operator() # where this is defined
sage: SR(SUM(x,x,1,int(10))._maxima_().simplify_sum())
55
```

This just goes to show that we need some sort of Pynac tutorial so that more people can be effective on this!
