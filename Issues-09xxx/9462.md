cython gives a warning when compiling `matrix_modn_dense.pyx`:

```
warning: /data2/wpalenst/sage-4.5.alpha4/devel/sage-main/sage/matrix/matrix_modn_dense.pyx:105:8: Function signature does not match previous declaration
```

I've uploaded a patch that removes the duplicate declaration (of `memcpy`), and also removes the unused declaration of `memcmp`.

The patch makes the warning go away and all tests pass afterwards.  Since the declaration is already included via `include "../ext/cdefs.pxi"`, getting rid of the extra one looks fine.  Positive review.
