Hello Minh !! I applied this patch on 4.5.rc1, which has a lot of new Graph methods, and found this patch needed to be rebased. I just finished, and your patch is fine for me, thank you for your work ! Here is the rebased version.. Could you give it a final check before setting this to "positive review" ? :-)
