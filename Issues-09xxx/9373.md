The database of common graph generators maintains two separate lists of such generators. This entails a lot of work when updating that database as one would need to update two separate lists. Not only that, but having two lists that contain essentially the same information is information duplication. One could update a list and then forgot to update the other list. Better to have one list with links to corresponding generators.

Hello Minh !! I applied this patch on 4.5.rc1, which has a lot of new Graph methods, and found this patch needed to be rebased.
