Plotting 

```
E2 = EllipticCurve([0,0,0,-7,0])
plot(E2)
```
shows the entire EC, but

```
E = EllipticCurve([-6,6])
plot(E)
```
does not, although there are points with positive x:

```
E = EllipticCurve([-6,6])
print '\n'.join([ '%s'%E.lift_x(xp)for xp in srange(-2,5,0.5)])
```

This is possibly related to [#5124](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/5124) because e.g. plot(E, (-3,3)) is ignored and hence impossible to plot the entire picture of E.

Component: **graphics**
