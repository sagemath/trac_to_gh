Implementation of a max-flow algorithm which does not use Linear Programming. A tad faster than the current LP implementation.

This ticket also updates several other methods which formerly used flows (or could be made to), so that they may use the speedup !

```
sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: %timeit g.flow(0,1, method = "LP")
125 loops, best of 3: 2.85 ms per loop
sage: %timeit g.flow(0,1)
625 loops, best of 3: 1.19 ms per loop
```

```
sage: g = graphs.RandomGNP(200,0.1)
sage: %timeit g.flow(0,1, method = "LP")
5 loops, best of 3: 322 ms per loop
sage: %timeit g.flow(0,1)
5 loops, best of 3: 73.5 ms per loop
```

```
sage: %timeit g.edge_cut(0,1, method="LP")
5 loops, best of 3: 377 ms per loop
sage: %timeit g.edge_cut(0,1)
5 loops, best of 3: 72.5 ms per loop
```

```
g = graphs.RandomGNP(50,0.2)
sage: %timeit g.gomory_hu_tree()
5 loops, best of 3: 4.22 s per loop
sage: %timeit g.gomory_hu_tree(method="LP")
5 loops, best of 3: 5.38 s per loop
```

I expected a much better speedup for gomory_hu, by the way.... It's odd, it sounds like the bottleneck is somewhere else... O_o

___This patch is dedicated to anybody who ever refused one of my patches for lack of doctests. I wouldn't have noticed half of the bugs in this patch without the help of those doctests in the functions that use flow... I won't ever complain anymore because of that ! :-D___

This applies okay to 4.5.2.a1 and seems to pass all tests, except for some unrelated failures. However, there are no examples in edge_cut with vertices=True, eg

```
sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: g.edge_cut(0, 3, method="FF", vertices=True)
[3, [(0, 1, None), (0, 4, None), (0, 5, None)], [[0], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]]]
```
Why is this?

The value isn't returned, so the potential user cannot see examples of how the output changes for different choices of the input. I'm just wondering if there was a good reason for omitting the edges in the output. An example with value_only=False would be equally nice. Finally, to be extremely picky, the description

```
``vertices`` -- boolean (default: ``False``). When set to ``True``,
          also returns the two sets of vertices that are disconnected by
          the cut. Implies ``value_only=False``.
```
should probably read

```
``vertices`` -- boolean (default: ``False``). When set to ``True``,
          returns a list of edges in the edge cut and the two 
          sets of vertices that are disconnected by the cut. 
          Note: ``vertices=True`` implies ``value_only=False``.
```

Does this seem reasonable?
