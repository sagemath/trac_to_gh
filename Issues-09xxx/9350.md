Implementation of a max-flow algorithm which does not use Linear Programming. A tad faster than the current LP implementation.

This ticket also updates several other methods which formerly used flows (or could be made to), so that they may use the speedup !

```
sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: %timeit g.flow(0,1, method = "LP")
125 loops, best of 3: 2.85 ms per loop
sage: %timeit g.flow(0,1)
625 loops, best of 3: 1.19 ms per loop
```

```
sage: g = graphs.RandomGNP(200,0.1)
sage: %timeit g.flow(0,1, method = "LP")
5 loops, best of 3: 322 ms per loop
sage: %timeit g.flow(0,1)
5 loops, best of 3: 73.5 ms per loop
```

```
sage: %timeit g.edge_cut(0,1, method="LP")
5 loops, best of 3: 377 ms per loop
sage: %timeit g.edge_cut(0,1)
5 loops, best of 3: 72.5 ms per loop
```

```
g = graphs.RandomGNP(50,0.2)
sage: %timeit g.gomory_hu_tree()
5 loops, best of 3: 4.22 s per loop
sage: %timeit g.gomory_hu_tree(method="LP")
5 loops, best of 3: 5.38 s per loop
```

I expected a much better speedup for gomory_hu, by the way.... It's odd, it sounds like the bottleneck is somewhere else... O_o

This applies okay to 4.5.2.a1 and seems to pass all tests, except for some unrelated failures. However, there are no examples in edge_cut with vertices=True, eg

```
sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: g.edge_cut(0, 3, method="FF", vertices=True)

The value isn't returned, so the potential user cannot see examples of how the output changes for different choices of the input. I'm just wondering if there was a good reason for omitting the edges in the output. An example with value_only=False would be equally nice. Finally, to be extremely picky, the description

```
``vertices`` -- boolean (default: ``False``). When set to ``True``,
          also returns the two sets of vertices that are disconnected by
          the cut. Implies ``value_only=False``.
```
should probably read

```
``vertices`` -- boolean (default: ``False``). When set to ``True``,
          returns a list of edges in the edge cut and the two 
          sets of vertices that are disconnected by the cut. 
          Note: ``vertices=True`` implies ``value_only=False``.
```

Does this seem reasonable?

Excellent. Passed tested for me (except for unrelated doctest failures on a mac 10.6.4).
