which was merged in 5.0.1.rc1.

I prefer to leave `Set([r for r in R])` which is more explicit (in my opinion) and to make
the changes minimal in the book. There are no duplicate elements here (in a finite field).

The Cholesky decomposition is not unique over finite fields and we shouldn't test for the output (which can be random depending on which square-root is chosen) but test for L*L<sup>T</sup> == A. This is done by the line after the line removed in this patch. Hence, correctness is checked. Note that I discussed this off-list Rob Beezer who is the author of the line removed in this patch.

**Attachment:** [givaro-3.2.13-3.7.0.diff](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9511/givaro-3.2.13-3.7.0.diff)

You should keep the

```
echo >&2 Error
```
instead of 

```
echo Error
```
and also the Cygwin patch and the `$SAGE_LOCAL` quoting (i.e. don't undo something from givaro-3.2.13 unless you have a reason too).
