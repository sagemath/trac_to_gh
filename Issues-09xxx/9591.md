If I'm not mistaken, it should be .p7, .p8, as the one version in sage-4.5.3.alpha0 is a .p6. 

But this fails to build on OpenSolaris 32-bit, despite the previous version working fine.

Yes, sorry, my mistake. 

I've stuck it back to "needs review". I dn't feel able to review it, but after installing the pari package, this installs cleanly. 

**I've only tested on OpenSolaris x64 as a 32-bit binary** - so I have not tested on Solaris SPARC (e.g. t2)

Replying to [mpatel](#comment%3A18):
> I can give a positive review to the "EOF" part of [attachment:ticket:9738:9738_genus2reduction_init_opts.patch Jeroen's patch] from #9738.  With the prerequisites given at [NewPARI](http://wiki.sagemath.org/NewPARI), I get no dumped cores on bsd, redhawk, sage, and t2.math.


Specifically, I get no dumped cores from running `genus2reduction` and testing `sage/interfaces/genus2reduction.py`.  There are still unrelated cores stemming probably from the doctesting system (cf. [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/0239f712a39fce4a/ba4e7b77e4de1b10?#ba4e7b77e4de1b10), #9739).

Ok, I've really looked at the new spkg. ;-)

The changelog in `SPKG.txt` cites #9738 for the removal, but never mind. (The commit message is correct.)

Reverting to **"positive review"**.

Mitesh, could you update the link on the NewPARI wiki page?
