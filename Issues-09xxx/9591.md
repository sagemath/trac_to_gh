If I'm not mistaken, it should be .p7, .p8, as the one version in sage-4.5.3.alpha0 is a .p6. 

But this fails to build on OpenSolaris 32-bit, despite the previous version working fine.

I had that when making the ebuild for gentoo earlier. You are not compiling it
against pari-2.4.xx - that's what the problem is.

Yes, sorry, my mistake. 

I've stuck it back to "needs review". I dn't feel able to review it, but after installing the pari package, this installs cleanly. 

**I've only tested on OpenSolaris x64 as a 32-bit binary** - so I have not tested on Solaris SPARC (e.g. t2)

Well, there has been a .p7 on this ticket for a while, even if it was never actually distributed by Sage.  In my opinion it makes sense to call this .p8 then.
