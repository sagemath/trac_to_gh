The attached patch fixes the reported issue. In the process I also fixed a very annoying performance issue

```python
# Old
sage: B = BooleanPolynomialRing(200,'x')
sage: %timeit B("x0")
25 loops, best of 3: 17.1 ms per loop

# New
sage: B = BooleanPolynomialRing(200,'x')
sage: %timeit B("x0")
625 loops, best of 3: 11.6 Âµs per loop

# "optimal"
sage: gd = B.gens_dict()
sage: %timeit gd['x0']
625 loops, best of 3: 94.2 ns per loop
```
