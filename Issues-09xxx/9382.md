atlas on i686 systems (x86-Linux) is
not respecting SAGE_FAT_BINARY.

The attached mercurial patch adds
i686 to the list of other architectures
(i386, x86_64) that respect SAGE_FAT_BINARY.

**Assignee:** Mariah Lenox

**Reviewer:** Leif Leonhardy, Volker Braun

That's what it looks like to me.  What if you just delete the quote?  Replace

```
if [ "`uname -p`" = "i386" -o "'`uname -p`" = "i686" -o `uname -p`" = "x86_64" ]; then 
```
with

```
if [ "`uname -p`" = "i386" -o "`uname -p`" = "i686" -o `uname -p`" = "x86_64" ]; then 
```
(no single quote before the second <code>\`uname...\`</code>).

A similar problem has been noticed in Arch Linux: https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/21592

```
18:44 < td123> hello
18:45 < td123> it seems that when building sage, it doesn't respect the 
               SAGE_FAT_BINARY='yes' option because I built sage with that 
               option on a corei7 for x86 and someone kept getting illegal 
               instruction on a pentium 3
18:45 < td123> when I looked through the logs, it seemed that atlas (among 
               possibly others) were building with processort specific 
               optimizations
18:48 < td123> I'm the packager for archlinux :) 
http://repos.archlinux.org/wsvn/community/sage-mathematics/trunk/PKGBUILD is

`uname -p` on linux returns a textual description of the CPU for me, not a canonical architecture name. It looks like this may have to be `uname -m` on Linux.

On the other hand, on solaris it looks like `uname -p` is correct.

As `td123` on IRC suggested, maybe we should just check both the results of `-m` and `-p` for these values?

Instead of hacking around the current atlas build script, I think it would be a good point to switch to my rewritten atlas spkg at #10226 that detects the configuration in a much cleaner way.

Replying to [mariah](#comment%3A6):
> Apologies for my silly error.  Here is a revised patch [9382.patch](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/mariah/spkgs/9382.patch)


That patch has another tiny error: it has "`uname-p`" (no space between "uname" and "-p"). I just uploaded a patch to this ticket in which I fixed that problem. However, there are other problems: on Ubuntu, it seems that `uname -p` returns "unknown" and `uname -m` returns the architecture name that we want. I've tried this on several 32-bit and 64-bit (i.e., i686 and x86_64) computers, on Ubuntu 8.04, 10.04, and 10.10 and they all behave the same. So we will need to use "-m" to correctly detect this on Ubuntu.

You're looking at an old version of the patch. The most up to date one is the SPKG in comment #9.

Also, #10226 (which also needs review) might supersede this patch.

I currently don't know whether the new (*Python* install script) ATLAS spkg from #10226 supports `SAGE_FAT_BINARY` as desired, but for the record:

* `uname -p` isn't portable (it may return "`unknown`" even on Linuces), one should use `uname -m` instead.

* Rather than having (btw. incomplete)

```sh
    if [ ... -o ... -o ... -o ... ]; then ...
```
 one should use

```sh
    case "`uname -m`" in
      i[3456]86|i86pc)
        ...
        ;;
      amd64|x86_64)
        ...
        ;;
      ia64) # Itanium
        ...
        ;;
      # etc.
    esac
```
 instead, which is not only more readable, but also more robust (and portable w.r.t. broken / buggy `test` commands).

For the record, the updated ATLAS spkg from #10226 uses the `$UNAME` environment variable (which Sage sets) if available, and python's portable `platform.system()` otherwise:

```python
try:
    conf['system'] = os.environ['UNAME']
except KeyError:
    conf['system'] = platform.system()
```
Also there is some support for `SAGE_FAT_BINARY`:

```python
    if os.environ.get('SAGE_FAT_BINARY', 'no') == 'yes' and conf['Intel?']:
        print 'Sage "fat" binary mode set: Building SSE2 only Hammer binary'
        print 'NOTE: This can result in a Sage that is significantly slower at certain numerical'
        print 'linear algebra since full FAT binary support has not been implemented yet.'
        arch = 'HAMMER'
        isa_ext = ('SSE2', 'SSE1')
```
Though I'm not sure if anybody ever verified that ATLAS, with these settings, indeed does not use any more advanced isa extensions.

Regarding that a) the notion of "fat" binaries is misleading (because "fat" originally refers to **different** code for different [flavours of] processors in the **same** binary / executable), and b) there's neither a definition nor a consistent practice of what ISA subsets Sage uses if `SAGE_FAT_BINARY=yes`, I think we can then close this ticket.

If someone complains, we can always change the behaviour of the affected spkg(s); with the exception of AFAIK very rare `SIGILL` reports for binary distributions Mariah seems to be the only one who actually regularly tests this feature.

We could of course over time collect what different spkgs do, on a wiki page, though.

(For most packages and binary distributions adding `-march=...` or `-mcpu=...` to `CFLAGS` -- or configuring GCC to default to these -- should be sufficient anyway; building binary Sage distributions on less advanced processors is another way.)

I don't see any consistency across architectures:

* x86 has `-march` and `-mtune`==`-mcpu`
* ARM has `-march` and `-mtune`==`-mcpu` (except perhaps with fewer possible values??)
* MIPS has `-march` and `-mtune` but not `-mcpu`
* PowerPC does not have `-march`, but supports `-mtune` and `-mcpu`

There is a ton of dead architectures, but I don't think they have any up-to-date interface.
