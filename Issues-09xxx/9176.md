That is weird.  Is it possible that a *silent* segfault makes a doctest think it passed?

Did you actually manage to run the test without hacking around with --cygwin-heap?
I think we should at least add some doc somewhere to state that the tests are expected to fail with default max heap memory and how to modify that (e.g. use peflags and the global var is not supported anymore).
