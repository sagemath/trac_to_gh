But trying the first example by hand leads to a segfault (presumably related to the segfault currently bedeveling Cygwin startup, see #11551).

That is weird.  Is it possible that a *silent* segfault makes a doctest think it passed?

Did you actually manage to run the test without hacking around with --cygwin-heap?
I think we should at least add some doc somewhere to state that the tests are expected to fail with default max heap memory and how to modify that (e.g. use peflags and the global var is not supported anymore).

I guess these extra failures are mostly due to the fact a previous doctest needing too much memory for PARI failed.

Sorry for not following up - so you agree with Dima that this is a pure memory issue, and so should be closed?  Should we at least put a mention in the doc for this file that "if you are on a system with not much memory allocated (such as default Cygwin, but perhaps others like tablets or something) then there is this trick, see the verbiage added by #14207"?
