If G is a graph with multiedges that contains two copies of an edge e, and you delete one of the copies, num_edges() doesn't go down by one.  For example,

```
sage: G = Graph(multiedges = True)
sage: G.add_edges([(0,1), (0,1)])
sage: G.delete_edge(0,1)
sage: G.num_edges()
2
sage: G.edges()
[(0, 1, None)]
```


Keywords: **num_edges, multiedges**
