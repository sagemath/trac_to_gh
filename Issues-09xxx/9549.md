The class `InfinitePolynomialRing_sparse` defines two methods called `is_field()`. The second definition rejects keyword arguments. This prevents from creating polynomial rings over infinite polynomial rings:

There is a similar issue with ``is_integral_domain``, too.

I have now replaced it with the correct file. (It seems that for some reason, unprivilegied trac users are allowed to replace attached files but not to delete them??!)
