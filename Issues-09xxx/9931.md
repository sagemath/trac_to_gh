Currently, points on elliptic curves cannot automatically be converted to PARI:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve([0,0,0,3,0])
sage: P = E.point([1,2]); P
(1 : 2 : 1)
sage: pari(P)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
RuntimeError: evaluating PARI string
```

Note that the patch removes `_pari_` for elliptic curves over p-adic and finite fields.  This is justified because the general case covers these special cases (and doctests have been copied to check that).
