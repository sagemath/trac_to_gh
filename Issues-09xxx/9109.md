The patch implements fast Cython classes for maps between finite sets. The goal in particular is to allow for building easily submonoids of the monoid of all maps from one set to itself.

See for example class NDPFMonoidPosetNewSet in
[parking_functions_posets-fh.patch](http://combinat.sagemath.org/hgwebdir.cgi/patches/file/tip/parking_functions_posets-fh.patch#l1)

We discussed the design quite some with Florent, and used the code intensively over the last month. It's a useful addition! Thanks!

Florent: please check the small reviewer patch on the Sage-Combinat queue. If the changes are ok with you, you can fold/upload and set a positive review on my behalf.

Hi Nicolas ! Thanks a lot for the numerous English corrections. The doc is
much better now ! I'm perfectly ok with all your changes, except for the
following wrong ReST markup:

I folded your patch and added this small change. It is a rather trivial change
but, in order to follow the rules, someone has to look at it. So it's now your
job to set the positive review :-)
