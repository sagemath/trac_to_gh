We discussed the design quite some with Florent, and used the code intensively over the last month. It's a useful addition! Thanks!

Florent: please check the small reviewer patch on the Sage-Combinat queue. If the changes are ok with you, you can fold/upload and set a positive review on my behalf.

Hi Nicolas ! Thanks a lot for the numerous English corrections. The doc is
much better now ! I'm perfectly ok with all your changes, except for the
following wrong ReST markup:

```

--- a/sage/sets/finite_set_map_cy.pyx

I folded your patch and added this small change. It is a rather trivial change
but, in order to follow the rules, someone has to look at it. So it's now your
job to set the positive review :-)
