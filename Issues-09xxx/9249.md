This seems to be installing and passing tests okay but I'm not seeing any new docstring tests that correspond to the new code. Am I missing something? If not, I think more tests should be added (eg, Minh's OP on sage-devel in the thread cited above).

Good point!

I wonder what you think about this idea:

Add a not tested docstring  (I've forgotten how you do that though) which has one
test in the case when the package is loaded and another test in the case when the package is not. There there could be a remark that only one of these will trigger an error exception?

I know LP is optional in Sage, but... Well, there are now **many** important functions that use LP, so even if it is optional because of license problems, it is more and more part of Sage's graph library :p
