is_hamiltonian always returned False when no LP solver was installed (as reported by Minh http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_frm/thread/66b6459477590590)

This is fixed by the current patch. It also introduces a new module defining special Sage exceptions, as discussed in the same thread.

Good point!

I wonder what you think about this idea:

Add a not tested docstring  (I've forgotten how you do that though) which has one
test in the case when the package is loaded and another test in the case when the package is not. There there could be a remark that only one of these will trigger an error exception?

It might be a bit of a challenge. As Tom Boothby points out, bipartite matching can easily be reduced to dancing links. We should use that where we can, instead of using optional packages.
