From the libpng INSTALL file:

```
Before installing libpng, you must first install zlib
```
So fix the file "deps" accordingly.  (This issue arose when building spkg's in parallel: the build failed when it reached libpng because zlib wasn't installed yet.)

I'm sorry, I have screwed up here, and attached these files to the wrong ticket! Instead of attaching them to #9598, I've attached them here. 

Since this has not been merged, it's probably not a fatal screw up. Sorry.
