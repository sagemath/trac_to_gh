I'm sorry, I have screwed up here, and attached these files to the wrong ticket! Instead of attaching them to #9598, I've attached them here. 

Since this has not been merged, it's probably not a fatal screw up. Sorry. 

I will attempt to put the files back as they should be.

I mean it has been merged, so it should not be a big deal. But I will attempt to put the files back as they should be.
