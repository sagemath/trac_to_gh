I'm cc'ing Mark Adler on this, as he is the maintainer of the zlib package. It would appear that zlib is building the shared library with the wrong extension on AIX. Rather unconventionally, AIX uses .a for shared libraries. 

If Mark needs access to an AIX machine, I can the following:


* IBM [RS/6000 7025 F50](http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/pseries/v5r3/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.pseries.doc/hardware_docs/rs6000_7025f50series.htm)
* 4 x 332 MHz 32-bit PowerPC CPUs
* 3 GB RAM
* A fair wide mixture of disks sizes (3 x 9 GB, 1 x 18 GB, 2 x 36 GB and 1 x 73 GB)
* DDS-4 tape drive 
* AIX 5.3 (A POSIX certified operating system)
* gcc 4.2.4 downloaded from [pware](http://pware.hvcc.edu/)
* sage-4.6.alpha1
