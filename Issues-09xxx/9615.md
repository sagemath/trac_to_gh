The patch fixes the problem on a 32-bit Ubuntu Hardy VM which exhibits the doctest failure.

One question, though: is lcalc expected to return precisely zero, or a "noisy zero"? It seems unusual to me that software doing floating point calculations would return precisely zero on some platforms and a noisy zero on others. 

If this kind of behavior is expected on 32-bit versus 64-bit machines, and if lcalc's answers are imprecise anyway, then I think this can get a positive review. (IOW, my ignorance about lcalc is what's keeping this from a positive review...)

I can only imagine this is related to (unintentionally) different [default] rounding modes on different processors.

So this patch fixes the failing doctest (which is IMHO ok for the moment), but doesn't address its reason.

Unless the involved `abs()` (or `<`) is somehow broken, I can give this a positive review without applying the patch and actually testing it... ;-)

The patched doctest lacks an explanation/reference back to this ticket, which I think would be appropriate in this case.

Not surprisingly passes all (long) tests in `sage/libs/lcalc/` on Ubuntu 9.04 x86 (Pentium 4 Prescott, gcc 4.3.3), where the doctest previously failed.

I remember there was a single machine reported on sage-release to have a different result than my two 32-bit machines previously had, on which the patch should perhaps be tested, too (but afair also with `abs(...)` below 10<sup>-15</sup>).

Rob, could you perhaps test this patch, too? (Though I don't expect it to fail on your machine either, since your result was even closer to zero.)

In lcalc, the function being tested returns a complex number (double precision). It is probably the way different processors do the computations, that the doctest failures are occurring. The earlier doctest passed on all the machines I have access to. 

The calculation of L-function is pretty involved, you can see the papers which are referred to in the patch in #5396.

For what it's worth, it also fixes it on two different skynet machines which had the failure: cicero (x86-Linux-pentium4-fc) and iras (ia64-Linux-suse).

Does iras default to 32-bit builds? (I only know it's running a 64-bit SuSE.)

I ask this because Harald also saw this doctest failure on a (newer) 64-bit processor running a 32-bit OS (Core2 quad, Ubuntu 8.10 x86).

I think someone should track down if this difference is an lcalc "feature" or perhaps a Sage library interface issue (and in the latter case open a new ticket).

Well, I would have written

```
          ... # "noisy" zero on some platforms (see #9615)
```

But now it's too late...
