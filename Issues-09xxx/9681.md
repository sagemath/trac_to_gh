```
The zn_poly package lists in `SPKG.txt` the only dependencies are GMP, but this is not true, as zn_poly's configure script has in it:

```
/configure --gmp-prefix="$SAGE_LOCAL" --ntl-prefix="$SAGE_LOCAL" \
            --prefix="$SAGE_LOCAL" --cflags="$CFLAGS" --ldflags="$LDFLAGS"
```

**So zn_poly depends on ntl**

Looking at $SAGE_ROOT/spkg/standard/deps, I see: 

```
$(INST)/$(ZNPOLY): $(BASE) $(INST)/$(MPIR)
        $(INSTALL) "$(SAGE_SPKG) $(ZNPOLY) 2>&1" "tee -a $(SAGE_LOGS)/$(ZNPOLY).log"
```

i.e. no such dependency is directly listed. 

Then looking at MPIR I see the dependencies are only BASE and ICONV. But ICONV only depends on BASE, **so there is nothing to force ntl to build before zn_poly, despite zn_poly depends on ntl**

I am aware of two other changes that are desirable in the 'deps' file too, as they add clarity. 

* #9464 
* #9637 

These might as well be fixed at the same time.
