```
The zn_poly package lists in `SPKG.txt` the only dependencies are GMP, but this is not true, as zn_poly's configure script has in it:

```
/configure --gmp-prefix="$SAGE_LOCAL" --ntl-prefix="$SAGE_LOCAL" \
            --prefix="$SAGE_LOCAL" --cflags="$CFLAGS" --ldflags="$LDFLAGS"
```

**So zn_poly depends on ntl**

Looking at $SAGE_ROOT/spkg/standard/deps, I see: 

```
$(INST)/$(ZNPOLY): $(BASE) $(INST)/$(MPIR)
        $(INSTALL) "$(SAGE_SPKG) $(ZNPOLY) 2>&1" "tee -a $(SAGE_LOGS)/$(ZNPOLY).log"
```

i.e. no such dependency is directly listed. 

Then looking at MPIR I see the dependencies are only BASE and ICONV. But ICONV only depends on BASE, **so there is nothing to force ntl to build before zn_poly, despite zn_poly depends on ntl**

I am aware of two other changes that are desirable in the 'deps' file too, as they add clarity. 

* #9464 
* #9637 

These might as well be fixed at the same time.

It was only by chance I found this, while trying to resolve a 64-bit Solaris issue, which is #9358. 

I'm adding the two release managers to the ticket, as I believe this should be a blocker.

Some rather subtle problems have been caused by dependencies which have not been correct - I'm thinking in particular of William's failure on OS X to compile some Fortran code, when in fact it was due to the fortran package being dependent on python for a very simple script. The strange thing about that was everyone else had no problems, including me, using William's script on bsd.math. 

I would have thought anything that had the potential to mis-compile would be a blocker personally, but that's a personal opinion of course.
