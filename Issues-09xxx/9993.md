Singular is not building properly on the following hardware. If any Singular developer wants access to AIX to debug this, I can provide it. 

 == Hardware and software ==
* IBM [RS/6000 7025 F50](http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/pseries/v5r3/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.pseries.doc/hardware_docs/rs6000_7025f50series.htm)
* 4 x 332 MHz 32-bit PowerPC CPUs
* 3 GB RAM
* A fairly wide mixture of disks sizes (3 x 9 GB, 1 x 18 GB, 2 x 36 GB and 1 x 73 GB)
* DDS-4 tape drive 
* AIX 5.3 (A POSIX certified operating system)
* gcc 4.2.4 downloaded from [pware](http://pware.hvcc.edu/)
* sage-4.6.alpha1 (which has singular-3-1-1-4.p2)

 == The Problem ==
As note, Singular fails to build. I see this *error* a couple of times, but it does not abort the build. 

```
/opt/pware/lib/gcc/powerpc-ibm-aix5.3.0.0/4.2.4/../../../../include/c++/4.2.4/bits/ios_base.h:187: error: 'SEEK_CUR' was not declared in this scope
```

If eventually ends with:

```
