# Issue 9714: Graph(..., format='incidence_matrix') doesn't work with graphs that have loops, but G.incidence_matrix() does.  So?

We have

```
sage: M = matrix(3, [1,2,0, 0,2,0, 0,0,1])
sage: g = Graph(M, format='adjacency_matrix')
sage: I = g.incidence_matrix(); I
[-1 -1  0  0  0  1]
[ 1  1  0  1  1  0]
[ 0  0  1  0  0  0]
```
But then:

```
sage: Graph(I, format='incidence_matrix').show(graph_border=True)
kaboom!
```

Either the first .incidence_matrix() should fail, or the second Graph(...) should work.

```

```

Helloooooooooooooooo !!!

I find a bit weird that this code deals with -1 and 1 entries for *undirected* graphs, but well... `^^;`

Anyway, here is a very small patch that just avoid some unnecessary computations. 

I give a positive review to your patch, and you can review mine if you have some time `:-)`
