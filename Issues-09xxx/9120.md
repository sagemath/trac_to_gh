If a transformation is applied to a plotting function, it may return a function with the wrong parameter names.  This wrecks havoc since there are assumptions about the variables being passed in being the variable names of the function.  This patch corrects and tests for this.

Hi Jason!

Thanks for your patch. However I'm having trouble understanding what this code does & what problem it fixes.

So basically, in the old code, if you passed in a lambda expression then the functions returned by to_cartesian() wouldn't have the correct parameter names? Can you give me some examples of when this would lead to incorrect behavior in Sage?

The current implementation *will* lead to incorrect behavior in the fast_callable patch I'm working on...

I don't know if they lead to incorrect behavior right now.  The idea is that if you do plot(f, (x,0,1), (y,2,3), transformation=...), then the plotting code expects f to be called with f(x=.., y=...).  However, if a transformation is applied first, then x and y may not be the right keyword arguments to use for f, since the parameters could be changed in the current implementation.
