 == The problem ==
It would appear 'gfan' is totally broken on this setup, and as a result several tests fail. Strangly, the same problem is **not** observed on a Dell Optiplex 755 running Solaris 10 on x86 - it's only seen on the OpenSolaris machine.

<a id='comment:3'></a>This was an error on my part. `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` was not set, and neither were `LD_OPTIONS`, so gfan was picking up the older gcc header files included with OpenSolaris, and not the newer ones which were part of the gcc 4.5.0 on the system. 

As such, this ticket is invalid. 

The only issues affecting 32-bit build on OpenSolaris on x86 are the same as as those effecting 32-bit builds Solaris 10 x86. These are shown on the METATICKET #9734. The problems effecting the 32-bit builds on x86 hardward are:

* Numerical noise issues, #9689,  #9693 and #9735.
* Issues related to SYMPOW (#9703), which is a rather dubious package that is presenting problems on multiple systems (Cygwin and ArchLinux being two of them) - see #9166.
