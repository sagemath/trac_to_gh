The attached patch adds a radical() function, functions Factorization.radical() and Factorization.radical_value().  It also fixes a bug in the radical of a polynomial where the content was not accounted for.

It also changes the output of radical(), in a way which I think makes more sense: radical(0) now gives an error instead of returning 1 and the radical of a negative number is positive (instead of negative).

In order for all doctests to succeed, you need to apply also the patches for #9450.

I cannot see a reason not to include it, despite the comment from kcrisman.
