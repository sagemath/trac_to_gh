Right now, there is a function radical() as member of IntegerRing_class.  But there is no generic radical() function:

The attached patch adds a radical() function, functions Factorization.radical() and Factorization.radical_value().  It also fixes a bug in the radical of a polynomial where the content was not accounted for.

It also changes the output of radical(), in a way which I think makes more sense: radical(0) now gives an error instead of returning 1 and the radical of a negative number is positive (instead of negative).

In order for all doctests to succeed, you need to apply also the patches for #9450.
