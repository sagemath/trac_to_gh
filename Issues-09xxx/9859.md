The following tests failed:

These failures occurred just because some line numbers in `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/ncadoctest.py` changed (when I added some flush statements).

Replying to [mvngu](#comment%3A3):
> Those hard-coded line numbers that leif fixed shouldn't have been there in the first place.

Yes. According to Mercurial, Michael Abshoff introduced that in Jan 2009(!)... :-)
(There's no ticket number in the commit message. I'm not sure when it really got merged, but obviously long time ago.)

I wonder why I never ran into this before, since I frequently doctest with modified versions of `ncadoctest` (but perhaps incidentally not the whole Sage library, or `sage/rings`).

Thanks for reviewing this.
