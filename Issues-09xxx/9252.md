$'s are not escaped, multilines appear wrong, etc.

This patches the tutorial plus others so that reading the live-help leaves one with less papercuts.

When you(or really anyone) says "static version" do they mean the pdf's? Would I be able to see them with 

```
sage -docbuild tutorial pdf
```
?

On that note, where is the code that adds the $$=latex hack to the documentation? Maybe I can just patch that a little instead.

What about the literal blocks that are meant for the interactive shell? 'sage:' always gets turned into a cell, so I needed to add some kind of header in the literal block (a bad hack) to get it to print correctly in the live-help.

Thanks for looking at my patch!

No, the html version.  From the command line, execute "tutorial()", or from the notebook click the "Help" button and then the button for "Fast Static Versions of the Documentation".  Then click on the word "Tutorial".  Or open the file SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/doc/output/html/en/tutorial/index.html in your web browser.

Some of this is in sage/sage/misc/sagedoc.py (e.g., `process_dollars`).  See also SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/doc/common/conf.py.

It looks like the conversion from the html file to the "live" version of the docs is in the notebook code: SAGE_ROOT/local/lib/python/site-packages/sagenb-0.8-py2.6.egg/sagenb/notebook/docHTMLProcessor.py, it looks like.  Since you're dealing with differences between the static and the live versions, you may need to look there.
