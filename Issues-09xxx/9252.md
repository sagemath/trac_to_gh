$'s are not escaped, multilines appear wrong, etc.

This patches the tutorial plus others so that reading the live-help leaves one with less papercuts.

When you(or really anyone) says "static version" do they mean the pdf's? Would I be able to see them with 

```
sage -docbuild tutorial pdf
```
?

On that note, where is the code that adds the $$=latex hack to the documentation? Maybe I can just patch that a little instead.

What about the literal blocks that are meant for the interactive shell? 'sage:' always gets turned into a cell, so I needed to add some kind of header in the literal block (a bad hack) to get it to print correctly in the live-help.

Thanks for looking at my patch!

Some of this is in sage/sage/misc/sagedoc.py (e.g., `process_dollars`).  See also SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/doc/common/conf.py.

It looks like the conversion from the html file to the "live" version of the docs is in the notebook code: SAGE_ROOT/local/lib/python/site-packages/sagenb-0.8-py2.6.egg/sagenb/notebook/docHTMLProcessor.py, it looks like.  Since you're dealing with differences between the static and the live versions, you may need to look there.
