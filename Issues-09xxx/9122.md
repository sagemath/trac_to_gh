This patch implements conversions between simplicial and cubical complexes.  It also implements the following: if you call

```
sage: SimplicialComplex(X)
```
it tests to see if X has a `_simplicial_` method, and if it does, it calls that and returns the answer.  So if anyone wants to convert their favorite Sage object to a simplicial complex, they just have to write a `_simplicial_` method for it; then `SimplicialComplex(blah)` will work.  Same for a `_cubical_` method and cubical complexes.

Maybe I am building the docs incorrectly, but it seems kind of sad that the documentation for `_simplicial_` and `_cubical_` does not show up in the reference manual, and if you look at it in the notebook it is not currently rendered correctly.

Otherwise the functionality appears to be correctly implemented (although I have very little expertise in this area).  The flaws in rendering are probably the fault of the notebook code rather than this patch.

Oh, I think it's partly the fault of the patch: the docstrings should start with `r"""`, not just `"""`.  Try this new patch.

All homology tests passed and the documentation looks fixed, so I think this is OK now.
