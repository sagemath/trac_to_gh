```
The `__call__` functions for `AdditiveAbelianGroup` and `AdditiveAbelianGroupWrapper` don't behave as I would expect, nor as the doctests would lead one to believe.

Documentation for the wrapper class says:

```
...or an iterable (in which case the result is the corresponding
product of the generators of self).
```

It seems that the iterable instead gives a linear combination of the generators used in the "optimized" version of the quotient modules.  Most (all?) of the doctests use examples where the number of invariants is equal to the number of original generators, so the optimization is trivial and the situations below are not exposed.

See #9694 for an example of working around this.

Here, I'd expect `M([1,1,1])` to be `M.0+M.1+M.2`, and not an error

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve('30a2')
sage: pts = [E(4,-7,1), E(7/4, -11/8, 1), E(3, -2, 1)]
sage: M = AdditiveAbelianGroupWrapper(pts[0].parent(), pts, [3, 2, 2])
sage: M.gens()
((4 : -7 : 1), (7/4 : -11/8 : 1), (3 : -2 : 1))
sage: M([1,1,1])

```


No problem when the number of invariants equal the number of generators:

```
sage: G=AdditiveAbelianGroup([17])
sage: a=G([12])
sage: a
(12)
```

The problem case again, up in the base class

```
sage: H=AdditiveAbelianGroup([3,7])
sage: b=H([12])
sage: b
(0, 4)

sage: c=H([2,3])
