I have a lot of pickles here (in the data directory):

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/wstein/db/modsym/

All the ones without "aplist" in their name were broken by trac #8218 which rearranged code without any backwards compatibility imports.    This should have never happened. Sigh.

Anyway, my pickles are fixed by just adding back one file. 

**Assignee:** @williamstein

**Resolution:** fixed

Hi John,

Try running the command 

```
sage: load('http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/wstein/db/modsym/data/gamma0-1088-2.sobj')
```

with and without the patch (either one!) applied. Without the patch you'll get an error similar to the one Salman Baig reports on sage-devel ([here](http://groups.google.co.uk/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/f208f9d1548564ee/d989b029608fa6ee)). With the patch it should load fine.

I think you are right.  I tried it before applying patches, saw that something was not right but did not copy the output.  When I tried again after removing the patches (using hg qpop and sage -br) it still works!

But I just tried again on another machine, still 4.6.alpha3, and with no patches the load command gives

```

It's a mystery that popping the patches left a setup in which the load works;  and that left open the possibility that the only reason why the second patch worked was that the effect of the first patch was still around (!) so on the second machine I applied the second patch without previously applying the first, and that still worked.

Moreover, then popping the second patch put the system back properly (the load again fails).

So I am giving the *second* patch a positive review.
