With my reviewer patch applied, at least passes reasonable tests (`-long`, `-long` with `-only-optional=cbc,glpk` in `sage/numerical`) on a 32-bit system where the doctest previously did *not* fail...

Leaving as "needs review" for further testing.

Well, if GLPK gets a standard package, we should **definitely** remove the `optional` tags, since otherwise these tests are omitted in the usual test process.

(We could just substitute `optional` by `standard` to make life easier in case the package is made optional again for some reason. Same for Nathann's patch at #9312.)
