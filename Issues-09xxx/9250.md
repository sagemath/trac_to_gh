This currently breaks:

```
sage: B=KirillovReshetikhinCrystal(['D',5,1], 3,1)
sage: B[0].e(0)
```

This has to do with the method intermediate_shape for plus/minus diagrams.

<a id='comment:2'></a>
After the patch, passes `sage -testall`.

Fixes the crash mentioned in the Description.

Includes doctest.

Apparently the intermediate_shape method of PMDiagram presumed
that self.n was 2.

This one-line fix is obviously correct.
