From the README.txt of Qhull:

Qhull computes convex hulls, Delaunay triangulations, Voronoi diagrams,
furthest-site Voronoi diagrams, and halfspace intersections about a point.
It runs in 2-d, 3-d, 4-d, or higher.  It implements the Quickhull algorithm
for computing convex hulls.   Qhull handles round-off errors from floating
point arithmetic.  It can approximate a convex hull.

The program includes options for hull volume, facet area, partial hulls,
input transformations, randomization, tracing, multiple output formats, and
execution statistics.

First attempt at a spkg is at:

Its a bit odd that qhull uses no buildsystem except for a bare-bones makefile, but then they don't use any external library nor build a shared library. Still, there are a lot of #ifdef's strewn around the source code. In any case, I'm in favor of having it as an optional package.
