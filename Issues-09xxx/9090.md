Well, we have `input_grid` (both in SageNB and Jupyter) which can do this. The only potential caveat is that the size is fixed: you need to specify the number of rows and columns in advance.

Right... the thing with Jupyter widgets is that one can use the widgets without interacts. Essentially `@interact` is built up from widgets, for example setting up the auto-evaluation when a widget changes.

With SageNB on the other hand, controls (the SageNB term for widgets) cannot live by themselves. They require `@interact` to be used.
