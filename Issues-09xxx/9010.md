I tried the new Phylo module and it is nice. I had a problem with one example with networkx. (files in Tests/PhyloXML)

```

sage: net = Phylo.to_networkx(tree)
sage: networkx.draw(net)

    481             if undirected:
    482                 M[j,i] = M[i,j]

TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +=: 'numpy.float64' and 'str'

```

The next line would be.
sage: pylab.show()


I installed pygraphviz as well and the other graphing examples worked.

I was going to give it a positive review originally but was uncertain in regards to the networkx related error. Is this only on my setup? Should this be a ticket for networkx? The other plotting options worked for me so is this fine for an optional package? I assume that perfection is not required.

In any case, I think that the biopython package is fine as an optional package.
