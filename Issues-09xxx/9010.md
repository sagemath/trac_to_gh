My first look at it is good. I installed (SAGE_CHECK=yes) on two machines (32 and 64 bit Linux). The self test passed and my two test worksheets passed. One is just a short sheet and the other is the first three chapters of the tutorial.

I tried the new Phylo module and it is nice. I had a problem with one example with networkx. (files in Tests/PhyloXML)

```
sage: from Bio import Phylo
sage: import networkx, pylab
sage: tree = Phylo.read('example.xml', 'phyloxml')
sage: net = Phylo.to_networkx(tree)
sage: networkx.draw(net)
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

    109     if pos is None:

    111
    112     cf=pylab.gcf()

/home/math/sage/local/lib/python/networkx/drawing/layout.pyc in fruchterman_reingold_layout(G, dim, pos, fixed, iterations, weighted, scale)

    210     except:

    212         pos=_fruchterman_reingold(A,
    213                                   pos=pos_arr,

    478         if (u in nodeset) and (v in nodeset):
    479             i,j = index[u],index[v]
--> 480             M[i,j] += attrs.get('weight', 1)
    481             if undirected:
    482                 M[j,i] = M[i,j]

TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +=: 'numpy.float64' and 'str'

```

The next line would be.
sage: pylab.show()


I installed pygraphviz as well and the other graphing examples worked.

I was going to give it a positive review originally but was uncertain in regards to the networkx related error. Is this only on my setup? Should this be a ticket for networkx? The other plotting options worked for me so is this fine for an optional package? I assume that perfection is not required.

In any case, I think that the biopython package is fine as an optional package.
