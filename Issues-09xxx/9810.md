```
The `faces` method of a cone in a fan manages to screw up subsequent `facet` output:

```
sage: cone = toric_varieties.dP8().fan().generating_cone(0)
sage: cone
2-d cone of Rational polyhedral fan in 2-d lattice N
sage: cone.facets()
(1-d cone of Rational polyhedral fan in 2-d lattice N, 1-d cone of Rational polyhedral fan in 2-d lattice N)
sage: cone.faces()
((0-d cone of Rational polyhedral fan in 2-d lattice N,), (1-d cone of Rational polyhedral fan in 2-d lattice N, 1-d cone of Rational polyhedral fan in 2-d lattice N), (2-d cone of Rational polyhedral fan in 2-d lattice N,))
sage: cone.facets()
(2-d cone of Rational polyhedral fan in 2-d lattice N,)
```
This is on vanilla Sage 4.5.2 without any patches applied. Andrey, I think its somewhere in your code so you'll probably find it faster than I can.
