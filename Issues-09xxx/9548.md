This should do something reasonable:

`I*Infinity` now returns an element of the symbolic ring. I'm leaving the ticket open (as a wishlist item), though, since it would probably make sense to make infinities with complex direction more similar to ±∞.

This may be a stupid question but now that we have complex (unsigned) infinity, shouldn't that be the result of `I*Infinity`?

I don't know. It would definitely be useful to be able to write things like integrals from 0 to i∞, (1+i)∞, or exp(iθ)∞. Whether `I*infinity` should return on of these “directional” infinities or unsigned infinity is another question. Without thinking, I'd say `I*PlusInfinity()` should return the former and `I*UnsignedInfinity()` the latter.
