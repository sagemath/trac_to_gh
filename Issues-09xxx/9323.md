It is removed in Sage 4.4.4:

```
[mvngu@sage faq]$ pwd
/dev/shm/mvngu/sandbox/sage-4.4.4/devel/sage-main/doc/en/faq
[mvngu@sage faq]$ hg st
! doc/en/faq/Makefile
```
This has not effect on building the HTML or PDF versions of the FAQ. Both of these versions build fine. The release manager can close this ticket as fixed.

The file `doc/en/faq/Makefile` was removed from revision control in Sage 4.5.alpha1:

```sh
