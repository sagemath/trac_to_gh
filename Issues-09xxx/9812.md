sage: C = Cone([(1,0,0), (0,1,0), (1,0,1), (0,1,1)])
sage: F = Fan([C]).make_simplicial()
sage: [cone.ambient_ray_indices() for cone in F]
[(1, 3, 0), (1, 2, 0)]
```
While the output is mathematically correct, ambient ray indices are supposed to be sorted and violating this condition can lead to errors later. The attached patch adds extra sorting in the proper place. This means that polytopes constructed during subdivision can no longer be cached because of the potentially wrong vertex order, which is OK.
