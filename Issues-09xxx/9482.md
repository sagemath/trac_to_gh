```
When you construct an implicit_plot3d that doesn't actually contain any surface, you get a `MemoryError` (because it tries to allocate 0 memory to hold the vertices and faces, gets a NULL pointer, and decides that's an out-of-memory condition).

Here's one example:

```
sage: implicit_plot3d(x*x + y*y + z*z - 5000, (x, -5, 5), (y, -5, 5), (z, -5, 5))
```
... long traceback, ending:

The patch prevents the above error, all doctests pass.

JMOL doesn't like the resulting file; it gives errors about #faces must be positive, or something.  My vote would be to fix that error when we try to create the JMOL-formatted file.  (We could raise an error here, but then sum([implicit_plot3d(...) for i in range(10)]) might break unnecessarily.)

According to "man malloc":

  If  size is 0, then malloc()
  returns either NULL, or a unique pointer value that can later  be  
  successfully passed to free().

I guess under Linux malloc(0) returns NULL and under OSX it returns "a unique pointer value that can later be successfully passed to free()".

Replying to [cwitty](#comment%3A5):
> According to "man malloc":
> 
>   If  size is 0, then malloc()
>   returns either NULL, or a unique pointer value that can later  be

Interestingly, the Mac malloc man page is different.

```
The malloc() function allocates size bytes of memory and returns a pointer to the allocated memory.
<snip>
If successful, calloc(), malloc(), realloc(), reallocf(), and valloc() functions return a pointer to
     allocated memory.  If there is an error, they return a NULL pointer and set errno to ENOMEM.
```

Anyway, a good [FAQ](http://c-faq.com/ansi/malloc0.html) points out "Portable code must either take care not to call malloc(0), or be prepared for the possibility of a null return."  So I think your changes make sense.  

Incidentally, I am having trouble finding the following:
1. Definition of `point_c` - it isn't in `point_c.pxi` nor in the ext directory, as far as I can tell.
2. Online references to this angle bracket asterisk notation `<point_c *>` and friends.  None of the search engines take these characters into account, and neither of my C tutorials have this notation.  I think I get what it does, but it would be nice to know for sure.

Final result: this is an improvement over the previous situation, but for positive review and inclusion, one should open a ticket for the Jmol problem you indicate.   I can't figure out exactly what you mean by that, though I do get

```
sage: G.jmol_repr(G.default_render_params())
<snip>
AttributeError: 'RenderParams' object has no attribute 'output_archive'
```
if that's what you are referring to.  I get that other places, too, though I have no examples currently.
