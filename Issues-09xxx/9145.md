Attachment: **[trac_9145_math_symbols_docs.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9145/trac_9145_math_symbols_docs.patch.gz)**

Patch removes doc/common/macros.tex, replaces amsfonts by amssymb in latex preamble string of doc/common/conf.py.

4.4.3.alpha3 HTMl and PDF documentation all build without halting when this patch is applied and a limited survey indicates they look good as well.

Without the patch, when building the PDF version of the reference manual for Sage 4.4.3, I got:

```
! Undefined control sequence.
l.217693 ...als}(\mathrm{pos}_{i+1})]_{1 \leqslant 
                                                   i \leqslant n}$
```
Note that the HTML version built OK. With the patch, the PDF version built successfully on these machines:

* sage.math, Ubuntu 8.04.4 LTS, with latex and pdflatex
* bsd.math, Mac OS X 10.6.3, with latex and pdflatex

But failed on these machines:

* eno.skynet, Fedora 12, no latex or pdflatex
* rh.math, Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, no latex or pdflatex
* rosemary.math, Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 5.5, with latex and pdflatex, but I got the following error when building the PDF version:

 ```
 ! LaTeX Error: File `utf8x.def' not found.
 ```
 This also happens without the patch. The issue is more likely due to the LaTeX installation on rosemary.math.

As for `doc/common/macros.tex`, that file was during the days when Sage's documentation followed how Python did it. Since switching over to Sphinx, we don't need that file any more.
