```
In SAGE_ROOT/spkg/standard, with 4.5.alpha0, I see:

$ ls | grep -v spkg
total 303320
-rw-r--r-- 1 drake drake       43 Jun 28 09:36 README.txt

-rw-r--r-- 1 drake drake      383 Jun 28 09:36 numeric-24.2.txt

The files libdist_filelist, notes.txt, and numeric-24.2.txt seem like leftover notes that. Can I delete them? 
```

The files `libdist_filelist`, `notes.txt`, and `numeric-24.2.txt` [have been removed from Sage 4.5.2.alpha1](https://groups.google.com/group/sage-release/browse_thread/thread/9455213e89f94692):

```
The second unreviewed change is the deletion of several extra files in spkg/standard, as I mentioned in https://groups.google.com/group/sage-release/t/b6fd67d4d4543129. In the unlikely case that those files were important or necessary, we can just copy them from the alpha0 tarball. 
```

This ticket is for reviewing the change.

As part of the file "sage-sage":

```
   echo "sage -ldist currently disabled"
   echo "To work on it, remove the exit after this message in SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/sage-sage"
```
So sage-libdist is not currently active.  I think that we should keep the file libdist_filelist just in case.  In my opinion, the other two files can be removed, but I don't know their history.  You might ping William about this.

Okay, it looks like we should put libdist_filelist back in (and then, in my opinion, find out why it's there and if possible, open a ticket for removing it and the parts of the scripts that reference it).

The numeric-24.2.txt is a short description of a Python module that we don't ship. Even if we did include it, I can see no reason why such a file should be kept in spkg/standard.

notes.txt refers to the sage_c_lib package, which no longer exists, and to a very outdated version of linbox. The libtool information in that file should be kept in the linbox spkg and/or put on the wiki.

I think we can resolve this ticket by just putting libdist_filelist back.
