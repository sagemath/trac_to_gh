As noted at #9761, although the spkg-install script for zn_poly is a bash script, it actually calls a Python script `zn_poly-*/src/makemakefile.py`. Therefore the SPKG.txt file should indicate this dependency, as it is far from obvious. 

Clearly this is a minor issue, but one worth fixing.

True, but #9603 is more important, as it actually stops something building!
