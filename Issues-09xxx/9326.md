This patch adds a cohomology ring to toric varieties. This is then used for characteristic classes.

I'm using the usual description of the rational cohomology ring via the Stanley-Reisner ideal of the fan. This does not work for singular varities with worse than orbifold singularities. I don't have any good candidate for the "space where the Chern classes live" in that case. 

For prerequisites, see the tracker bug at #9604

<a id='comment:5'></a>If there is only one function for which it would be nice to have a corresponding cone method, I'd wait before redoing toric varieties to make copies of fans.

I don't like `HH` notation, which I associate with Hochschild (co)homology... While it is used in Macaulay2, it does not quite seem to be in the spirit of Sage. Macaulay2 is much more flexible in terms of operators and it may be a good choice there, but here I would prefer `cohomology_ring` etc. I don't see any problems with "What cohomology?" question since it can be clearly indicated in the documentation of all functions. (Do we plan to support multiple cohomology theories?)

I think `HH_class_of(cone)` ===> `cohomology_class(cone)` would be better.

Also `HH_exp(p)` ===> `cohomology_exp(p)` or better yet just `exp(p)`. Even better would be `p.exp()` which will not require toric variety at all, but that requires completely different handling so should be left till after divisor patch is merged.

I propose to do the following with `c` and others:

```
def Chern_class(self, deg=None): 
    r"""
    Return Chern class of the tangent bundle of the toric variety. 

    A synonym for this function is ``c``.
    ...
    """
    ... # actual code

c = Chern_class
```
This way we keep convenient access to all this functions, but at the same time provide descriptive names, so that glancing on TAB-completion clearly shows what is available. The same thing is done with `.numerical_approx()` and `.n()` methods in Sage.

Great and neat! However, http://wiki.sagemath.org/coercion advises against overriding `__call__` method in classes derived from `Parent`, and in this case I think it should be doable to do it the recommended way.

How about moving them to toric variety class, removing the ring argument, and making them return an ideal in `QQ[coordinate names of the variety]`?

I personally think that it is just fine to have them the same, but maybe they should be different from coordinate names. The reason is that I would like to inject both coordinates and divisors into the global name space and work with them. I think that I would prefer coordinates `x, y, z2, z3, z4` to be translated into `D_x, D_y, D2, D3, D4`. This may be a bit hard to implement, since it requires tracking which variables were given explicit names and which were created automatically, maybe `D_x, D_y, D_z2, D_z3, D_z4` or just `D0, D1, D2, D3, D4` would be better. In any way there should be a way for the user to provide custom names. I think there should be one more optional argument to the toric variety constructor and if it was not given, then the first call to `cohomology_ring` can specify these names.

The second exception is a bit misleading since it says that `CC` is required as the base field, but actually it checks only characteristics (we already had some discussion about it). How about the following: the constructor should check if the base field is exactly complex (by which I mean any complex field in Sage independent of precision, maybe function fields over complex one are also OK?) if not, it should raise an exception. However there should be a function like `X.treat_base_field_as_CC()` and if it was called, then all cohomology computations proceed without checks of the base field. That way we preserve mathematical correctness yet allow users to use any representation they want at their own risk. (To avoid potential complications with cached and created objects, this function should not be reversible, i.e. it is not OK to turn off `CC`-check and later turn it back on for the same variety.)\n4. `truncate_to_degree` - the name does not match what the function actually does. I would expect it to drop all terms higher than the given degree, but it also \"truncates\" lower terms. Can we change it to something like `part_of_degree`?\n5. `exp` - would be nice to mention in the documentation that there should be no constant part and explain why. Its output description is also not quite clear, I think it would be better to write that it returns a cohomology class.\n6. `cohomology_basis` - in the first output case you meant `H^d`, not `H^\\bullet`.\n7. `cohomology_class` - can we add some message to `NotImplementedError`? Note also that #9470 should allow implementing `cone.cohomology_class()` as you wanted.\n8. `volume_form` - I think documentation should explain the normalization of this form. What assumptions on the variety does this function make? Simplicial? Complete? Generated by maximal-dimensional cones? It would be nice to check for those that are not checked by cohomology ring construction.\n9. `integrate` - would be nice if the documentation explained that integration is done with respect to `volume_form`, i.e. that normalization is the same.\n10. `Todd_class` - can we add a message to `NotImplementedError`?\n11. `Euler` - in the spirit of `Chern_class` etc., I think it would be more consistent to call it `Euler_number` and add a standard notation alias `X.chi()`.

sage: C2 = toric_varieties.A2()

OK, here is the patch, let me know if you approve it. I have
* changed `_latex_` to give LaTeX representation of the lift-polynomial, I think it is better than using text representation;
* made `cohomology_basis` return tuple of tuples so that it does not get changed accidentally, I also rewrote its computation using list comprehension instead of functional style since I got a little confused. Of course, this is just me, so I am ready to change it back if you want. I actually though that calling `map` and filter should be faster, but
 {{{
sage: L = [1..1000]
sage: timeit("[e for e in L]", number=10000)
10000 loops, best of 3: 114 µs per loop
sage: timeit("map(lambda x: x, L)", number=10000)
10000 loops, best of 3: 263 µs per loop
sage: timeit("[e for e in L if e > 50]", number=10000)
10000 loops, best of 3: 637 µs per loop
sage: timeit("filter(lambda x: x > 50, L)", number=10000)
10000 loops, best of 3: 775 µs per loop
}}}
 so it seems that actually list comprehension is a little more efficient. My variant also does the degree splitting in a single pass through the full basis;
* made changes in a couple of places to check for existence of cached value before checking for errors (my sneaky plan is to allow myself to circumvent you characteristic zero defense system by setting `_cohomology_ring` directly if I wish so, but for sane users everything will work exactly as you have written it originally ;-));
* some little changes to the documentation, see the patch.

I'll now run complete tests including this patch, to make sure there are no surprises in unrelated places, but if you are happy with modifications I am ready to switch it to positive review.
