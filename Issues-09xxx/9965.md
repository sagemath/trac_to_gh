SYMPOW-related doctests can in

```
sage/lfunctions/sympow.py
sage/modular/abvar/abvar.py
sage/modular/hecke/submodule.py
sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_rational_field.py
```
can fail if users who do not have write access under `SAGE_ROOT` runs these tests before a user who does have this access.

See [comment:ticket:9703:8 comments 8 and 9] at #9703 for background and a suggested solution.

This is the likely cause of the non-qepcad failures [reported by Luis Felipe Tabera on sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/a56d4fbaad2dcce3).
