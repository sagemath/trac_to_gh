Although the 32-bit SPARC version of Sage passes all doc tests, there are still issues on 32-bit versions of Solaris/OpenSolaris on x86 hardware. This ticket summaries lists only failures on 32-bit builds, versions on x86 processors. 

64-bit versions have far more failures, and will need another ticket to address them.

At this early stage of the 32-bit ports to Solaris 10 and OpenSolaris on x86 processors, it would appear the problems fall into 3 areas

* [Gfan](http://www.math.tu-berlin.de/~jensen/software/gfan/gfan.html) - only on OpenSolaris.
