This *HAS* to be changed :

```
p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram()
v = p.new_variable()
sage: %timeit sum([v[i] for i in xrange(900)])
5 loops, best of 3: 1.14 s per loop
```

With this new function :

```
def mipvariables_sum(L):
    d = {}
    for v in L:
        for (id,coeff) in v._f.iteritems():
            d[id] = coeff + d.get(id,0)
    return LinearFunction(d)
```

It gives :

```
sage: from sage.numerical.mip import mipvariables_sum
sage: %timeit mipvariables_sum([v[i] for i in xrange(900)])
625 loops, best of 3: 1.5 ms per loop
```

Even though it requires a new function to add MIPVariables, it is still better than nothing for the moment.

This patch will define the function given, and replace all the occurences of "sum" in the graph files to have them use this optimization.

Can you try `sage.misc.misc.balanced_sum`?  It seems to get about the same speedup for me as you indicate.

```
p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram()
v = p.new_variable()
%timeit sage.misc.misc.balanced_sum([v[i] for i in xrange(900)])
```

For me, the balanced_sum function gives these timings:

```
sage: p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram()
sage: v = p.new_variable()
sage: sage: %timeit sum([v[i] for i in xrange(900)])
5 loops, best of 3: 1.48 s per loop
sage: p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram()
sage: v = p.new_variable()
sage: %timeit sage.misc.misc.balanced_sum([v[i] for i in xrange(900)])
25 loops, best of 3: 28.2 ms per loop
```

So I guess your function still wins (which isn't much of a surprise).

Hello, Nathann!

Did you rebase it on sage-4.4.3? It seems so because it doesn't apply on sage-4.4.4. Since it touches many parts of the code, I don't know what would be the best strategy to make sure it is correctly based and it does not raise any problem with other patches.

Having looked at the code, it will probably be a fast review, as soon as I have checked for the improved efficiency.
