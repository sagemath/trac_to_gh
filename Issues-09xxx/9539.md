```
On a MacBook Pro with 2Go (Mac OS X 10.4.11), filling the memory terminates with a seg fault:

code used:

```
from sage.all import LaurentSeriesRing, GF, timeit
R = LaurentSeriesRing(GF(9001), 'x')
f = R([1, 1])
for i in range(27):
    timeit('g = f*f', number=1, repeat=1) ; f = f*f
```

output is:

```
1 loops, best of 1: 16.5 s per loop
1 loops, best of 1: 28.4 s per loop
1 loops, best of 1: 88.6 s per loop
python(6488) malloc: *** vm_allocate(size=2147614720) failed (error code=3)
python(6488) malloc: *** error: can't allocate region
python(6488) malloc: *** set a breakpoint in szone_error to debug


------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGBUS: A bus error occured in Sage.
This probably occured because a *compiled* component
of Sage has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
or is not properly wrapped with _sig_on, _sig_off.
You might want to run Sage under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
Sage will now terminate (sorry).
