<div id="comment:0"></div>

Our wrapper of the csgn function from GiNaC (in `sage/symbolic/expression.pyx`) doesn't reflect it's real definition:

```
  /** Return the complex half-plane (left or right) in which the number lies.
   *  csgn(x)==0 for x==0, csgn(x)==1 for Re(x)>0 or Re(x)=0 and Im(x)>0,
   *  csgn(x)==-1 for Re(x)<0 or Re(x)=0 and Im(x)<0.
   *  */
```

Fix this and add doctests.

We should also consider using GiNaC's `csgn()` function for the top level `sgn()` and `sign()` functions. This should be on a different ticket though.

That should have been "at #9901".
