Hi Nicolas B.,

There are a couple failures in the category tests (due to the new test and new category); please fix them. Note that I made a small change to your patch, so you should make sure to first pull.

You might get a conflict with the primer improvement; in that case, move your patch just after it.

I don't no the status about your improvements of the category primer but be aware about this fact. As I don't want to produce some chaos in the queue, I didn't touch your reviewer patch "trac_9056_semirings_category-review-nt.patch".

Sorry to being late to fold it.

Don't worry, you are doing a great job.

Mike said above that he took the two patches right away from the Sage-Combinat queue and folded them together. So all is fine.

Thanks Mike!

For later reference, do you mind uploading here the exact patches that you merged, if you still have them under hand?
