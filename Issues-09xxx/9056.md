Hi Nicolas B.,

There are a couple failures in the category tests (due to the new test and new category); please fix them. Note that I made a small change to your patch, so you should make sure to first pull.

You might get a conflict with the primer improvement; in that case, move your patch just after it.

As I did manage to run ALL TESTS on sagemath, I found files this patch affect... I didn't touch the primer (modified on combinat queue). This patch will have yo be updated if your primer improvements go in sage earlier.

I update the patch (without .2.patch, forget this one.)

One more update :

After advises form English speaker people, I change the name from NonNegativeIntegersSemiring to NonNegativeIntegerSemiring. See http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/ffaf01ffb941078

I linked my module to the reference manual and fix a :class: ref in the doc thanks to Florent.

I am still ready for deeper review.

Don't worry, you are doing a great job.

For later reference, do you mind uploading here the exact patches that you merged, if you still have them under hand?
