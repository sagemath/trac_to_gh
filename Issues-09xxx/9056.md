For now, I still don't really manage to integrate completely such patch which touch so many things in Sage. Dependencies are not trivial when you begin to modify categories.

I don't no the status about your improvements of the category primer but be aware about this fact. As I don't want to produce some chaos in the queue, I didn't touch your reviewer patch "trac_9056_semirings_category-review-nt.patch".

Don't worry, you are doing a great job.

Mike said above that he took the two patches right away from the Sage-Combinat queue and folded them together. So all is fine.

Thanks Mike!

For later reference, do you mind uploading here the exact patches that you merged, if you still have them under hand?
