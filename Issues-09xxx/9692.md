An almost complete 32-bit port of Sage 4.5.2 to Solaris 10 on x86 processors had been done on the following hardware:

* Dell OptiPlex 755
* 2.40 GHz Intel Quad-Core Core2 Q6600 CPU
* 8 GB RAM, 8 GB swap. 
* Solaris 10 update 5 (5/08) on x86 
* gcc 4.5.0 configured to use the Sun linker and GNU assembler
* sage-4.5.2.rc1 with several changes. 

The following doctest failed.

```

Some of these look like numerical rounding errors:

```
Expected:
    ([0, 0, 1, 1, 0], -9.0604285688230899)
Got:
    ([0, 0, 1, 1, 0], -9.0604285688230917)
```

but in other cases the number of digits being displayed is less than the expected value. 

```
Expected:
    -10.610333495739708
Got:
    -10.61033349573971
```
The "Got:" value is a correctly rounded version of the "Expected:" value, but I'm not sure if printing less digits is acceptable.

I personally like to see these numerical results being computed to high precision by another method if possible. I've got no idea how to compute these values, so have no idea if these are are anywhere near correct.

I think this ticket is a duplicate of #9735, #9689, and/or #9693.  Is that right?  Can it be closed?

(The ticket summary talks about symbolic/expression.pyx, which is covered by #9689 and #9693, while the description talks about chmm.pyx, which is covered by #9735.)

Yes, it can. 

I've no idea why the title says one ticket and the description another. But I think we are clear about what the issues are.
