Note that there is no coercion when you call

```
sage: import numpy
sage: vec = numpy.array([1,2])
sage: sin(vec)
array([ 0.84147098,  0.90929743])
```

The `__call__()` function for `sin` checks if the argument is a numpy array and calls the right numpy function on this input. See line 349 of `sage/symbolic/function.pyx`. We can handle other numpy types there.

We cannot work with matrices as numeric objects in symbolics. I suppose you expect the sin() function to be applied to each entry of the matrix. The `apply_map()` method should be used for this purpose:

```
sage: t = Matrix(ZZ, 2,2)
sage: t.randomize()
sage: t.apply_map(lambda x: sin(x))
[      0 -sin(1)]
[ sin(4)       0]
```

---

```
sage: x = PolynomialRing(RR, 'x').gen()
sage: sin(x)
<boom>
```

The problem here is really coercion, but it should be copied to another ticket (in the basic_arithmetic component):

The `__call__()` function of RR[x] doesn't conform to the generic definition. You should be able to give the parameters as a keyword argument as well. This should be made to work:

```
sage: R.<x> = RR[]
sage: (x^2+1)(x=5)
11
```

Incidentally the same with power series is part of #16197.
