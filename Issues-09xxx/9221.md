Matplotlib 1.0.0 has some bugfixes and enhancements that are really nice for us.  For example, the configuration variables allow us to eliminate most of our patches to the spkg, and a new path.snap config parameter solves #7808.

The spkg is up at http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jason/matplotlib-1.0.0.spkg.

**Assignee:** @jasongrout, @williamstein

**CC:**  drkirkby @kcrisman

**Author:** Jason Grout

**Reviewer:** David Kirkby, Karl-Dieter Crisman

It looks like a mix of compilation modes is causing them to get two different definitions for *swab*. \n\nThe bug tracker suggests this was a very recent fix, so may not have made it into 1.0. If if did make it into 1.0, then it failed to solve the problem. \n\n## Solaris 10 update with Sun UltraSPARC T2+ processors\n\n* Sun T5240\n* 2 x 8 core, 64-thread UltraSPARC T2+ 1167 MHz\n* 32 GB RAM\n* Solaris 10 update 7 (05/09)\n* t2.math.washtington.edu\n* gcc 4.4.1 configured to use both the Sun linker and assembler. \n* A build of sage-4.5.alpha4 was used to test matplotlib-1.0.0.spkg\n* MD5 checksum of matplotlib-1.0.0.spkg was cb9f3cb0ec3da550d2d67ea7e8b6094f \n* 32-bit build (This is the default).

No such luck. I've tried on both Solaris 10 on SPARC, and OpenSolaris on x64. It looks like a mix of compilation modes is causing them to get two different definitions for *swab*. 

The bug tracker suggests this was a very recent fix, so may not have made it into 1.0. If if did make it into 1.0, then it failed to solve the problem. 

## Solaris 10 update with Sun UltraSPARC T2+ processors

* Sun T5240
* 2 x 8 core, 64-thread UltraSPARC T2+ 1167 MHz
* 32 GB RAM
* Solaris 10 update 7 (05/09)
* t2.math.washtington.edu
* gcc 4.4.1 configured to use both the Sun linker and assembler. 
* A build of sage-4.5.alpha4 was used to test matplotlib-1.0.0.spkg
* MD5 checksum of matplotlib-1.0.0.spkg was cb9f3cb0ec3da550d2d67ea7e8b6094f 
* 32-bit build (This is the default). The environment variable `SAGE64` was **not** used.

Well, the log I posted was from the changelog for 1.0.0, so it certainly look like the fix had made it in.  I'll try looking at this soon.

Also, the spkg I posted above needs:

* an updated SPKG.txt file

before it is officially ready for review.

David,

I verified that the md5 you reported is for the right spkg and contains the fix.  If you have time, could you download the vanilla matplotlib source and try compiling that, just to make sure it isn't a problem with the Sage environment?  The 1.0.0 source is here:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/matplotlib/files/matplotlib/matplotlib-1.0/  (I can't test this URL; it isn't loading for me...)

The installation instructions are here:

http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/users/installing.html

and basically are:

```
cd matplotlib
python setup.py build
python setup.py install
```

I've also posted a report to https://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=4C349BDE.4020604%40creativetrax.com&forum_name=matplotlib-devel

David,

Could you test compiling the vanilla matplotlib 1.0 source on solaris to see if the issue is in the vanilla upstream package?

Just download from http://sourceforge.net/projects/matplotlib/files/matplotlib/matplotlib-1.0/matplotlib-1.0.0.tar.gz/download

Then untar and do:

```
cd matplotlib
python setup.py build
python setup.py install
```

(or use `sage -python` if you want to install into a Sage version of python).

It's not so easy to test the upstream source code directly, as there are dependencies which are not provided on Solaris. On 't2.math' I get:

```
kirkby@t2:32 ~/matplotlib-1.0.0$ python setup.py build
basedirlist is: ['/usr/local']
============================================================================
BUILDING MATPLOTLIB
            matplotlib: 1.0.0
                python: 2.4.4 (#1, Jan 10 2007, 01:25:01) [C]
              platform: sunos5

REQUIRED DEPENDENCIES
                 numpy: no
                        * You must install numpy 1.1 or later to build
                        * matplotlib.
```

But Numpy has a whole list of dependencies of its own, so I don't want to spend a long time setting that lot up. 

But I just retried your .spkg on 't2' using a working copy of the latest `sage-4.5.3.alpha0` and find exactly the same problem. 

I also tried on my OpenSolaris machine inside a slightly modified version of `sage-4.5.3.alpha0`. Again, I get the same problem as before. 

To me this looks like an upstream bug, and not anything introduced in Sage. 

I just checked the source code, and see the code is actually in matplotlib-1.0.0. 

```
// Prevent multiple conflicting definitions of swab from stdlib.h and unistd.h
#if defined(__sun) || defined(sun)
#if defined(_XPG4)
#undef _XPG4
#endif
#if defined(_XPG3)
#undef _XPG3
#endif
#endif
```

It seems a bit of a hack to me. If `_XPG4` or `_XPG3` are defined, there were defined for good reason, and I doubt simply undefining them is the right way to tackle this. I could imagine this could cause a whole lot more problems than it solves. 

According to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X/Open the [Single UNIX Specification](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_UNIX_Specification) was based on the XPG4 standard, so I would not be surprised that undefining `_XPG4` will cause problems as the behavior of hundreds of header files will be changed.

Interesting.  In this case, it seems like they want to include Python.h.

By default, which of _XPG4 or _XPG3 is defined in your compiler?  From the code in stdlib.h, it looks like setting _XPG4, but undefining _XPG3, should work.

I've no idea. 

> By default, which of _XPG4 or _XPG3 is defined in your compiler?  

Neither of them. 

One can see what gets defined with any combination of C and header files by pre-processing a file, and using the -dM options. To get the defaults, just use an empty file or /dev/null. This is a very useful trick some times. 

```
drkirkby@laptop:~$ gcc -dM -E - </dev/null  
#define __DBL_MIN_EXP__ (-1021)
#define __FLT_MIN__ 1.17549435e-38F
#define __CHAR_BIT__ 8
#define __WCHAR_MAX__ 2147483647
#define __DBL_DENORM_MIN__ 4.9406564584124654e-324
#define __FLT_EVAL_METHOD__ 2

etc etc
```

For the case of a test file where both unistd.h and stdlib.h are defined, we see both `_XOPEN_XPG3` and `_XOPEN_XPG4` get defined, but not `_XPG3` or `_XPG4`. 

```
drkirkby@laptop:~$ gcc -dM -E  test.c | grep XPG
#define _XOPEN_XPG3 
#define _XOPEN_XPG4 
```

> From the code in stdlib.h, it looks like setting _XPG4, but undefining _XPG3, should work.

I don't think one should go defining `_XPG3` and `_XPG4`  directly, but if one does do that, then one can induce the error depending on what you define and what header files you include. I leave it for you to prove that to yourself. (Try it on 't2.math') 

I can suggest a few resources that might shed some light on it. 

* http://www.opengroup.org/forums/
* gcc-help mailing list. (The mainly Linux crowd are bound to blame Sun, but worth asking anyway.)
* comp.unix.solaris newsgroup http://groups.google.com/group/comp.unix.solaris
* comp.lang.c newsgroup http://groups.google.co.uk/group/comp.lang.c 

There's probably a few more. Sorry I don't know the answer, but I doubt it needs on to go around defining `_XPG4` or similar.

Do you know how I can get up to at least installing the current matplotlib spkg on t2?  When I tried my updated 1.0 spkg, I also got these errors.

Jason,

I have no idea why this did not work for you. That binary was not built on 't2' but on another machine, with the expectation it would work on any SPARC. However, I am aware moving Sage does not always work. 

I can only suggest you build the latest Sage from source. Just remember to set something like

```
export SAGE_PARALLEL_SPKG_BUILD=yes
export MAKE="make -j8"
```

otherwise it will take ages to build.

BTW, there's a binary at

you could try extracting that. 

But again, it has been moved, though in that case the binary was built on t2.math.

Okay, I've updated the spkg so that it works on t2 (and passes all matplotlib tests):

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jason/matplotlib-1.0.0.spkg

Can people try it?  Basically, I just deleted in CXX/WrapPython.h any fudging with the defines, based on drkirkby's idea above that it ought not have to do that.  The new WrapPython.h is:

```
#ifndef __PyCXX_wrap_python_hxx__
#define __PyCXX_wrap_python_hxx__

// On some platforms we have to include time.h to get select defined
#if !defined(__WIN32__) && !defined(WIN32) && !defined(_WIN32) && !defined(_WIN64)
#include <sys/time.h>
#endif

// pull in python definitions
#include <Python.h>

#endif
```

Here it passes the matplotlib test suite:

```
In [1]: import matplotlib
In [2]: matplotlib.__version__
Out[2]: '1.0.0'

In [3]: matplotlib.test()
/scratch/grout/sage-4.5.3/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/matplotlib/axes.py:2369: UserWarning: Attempting to set identical left==right results

Seems to be working a-ok here, no issues.

By the way, to drkirkby, looks like matplotlib also uses `nose` to run their tests, like scipy and numpy.  I get no indication that `SAGE_CHECK=yes` does anything - or would - because of that.

See 

#9921

where only today I suggested we make 'nose' a **standard** package. 

> If we want to test these automatically, we need nose; just adding the lines to `spkg-check` or `spkg-install` won't help.  Obviously this is a different ticket, but I wanted to point it out.  And I'd support adding this to Sage if it improved things overall.

As far as I can see, adding nose as a stranded package would be very low risk, as nothing would depend on it except during testing. So it can't hardly screw Sage up, as long as nose builds reliably itself. Even if it was totally non-functional, it would not hurt sage. 

What we need is a list of packages that use nose, then request it is added as standard on the basis we can't test otherwise. It might be able to escape the 'experimental' stage.

I haven't looked at the code at all, but it builds and passes tests for me on an Intel Mac OS X 10.6 box, skynet machine taurus (linux: x86_64-Linux-nehalem-fc), and skynet machine fulvia (Solaris on x86: x86_64-SunOS-core2). I also deleted my .matplotlib directory and reran the tests on taurus, and they passed again.  I haven't been following this ticket; is this good enough to restore the positive review?

No, that's the previous version of the spkg.  Apparently somehow the new version was not copied to my home directory on sage.math.

The new version is md5 28179fff25e33fc623f1de96a039eecc

I've just double-checked, and it is now the version in my home directory:

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jason/matplotlib-1.0.0.spkg

Sorry for the mess-up!  I'm setting it back to needs_review, since apparently people reviewed the old spkg.  mpatel---I think you building on sage.math would be sufficient to review this.

:-) IMHO every spkg that's not almost vanilla upstream should carry a patch level, since the (Sage) package version (without the patch level) is not a Sage but the upstream version, but this appears to be an endless discussion...

I'm not the release manager, but **IMHO** either this ticket **needs work**, or #6235 / #9210? should be blockers for Sage 4.6, since

* installing Sage 4.6.alpha3 / matplotlib 1.0.0 breaks other Sage installations (cf. doctest errors in `sage/plot/plot.py` below, which even occur after rebuilding e.g. Sage 4.5.3 from scratch),
* the current spkg / alpha3 **again** breaks upgrading (cf. #9896) if the original Sage installation has been moved (copied / renamed), which apparently is common user practice.


Unless one e.g. deletes `$HOME/.matplotlib/`, the following happens with **other** Sage installations (and perhaps other software):

```

Are you sure that you have the most recent (i.e., the merged) 1.0.0 spkg from this ticket?  Can you try sage -f just in case (you see that there have been updates to the 1.0.0 spkg on this ticket as time went on)

Or wait.  Are you saying that the font cache file created by the new(est) spkg here is causing problems with older versions of matplotlib?

I only have the current 1.0.0 one, but that doesn't solve the problems older MPL installations have. ;-)

Exactly that. It seems they've changed the format s.t. older MPL versions expecting an older format (without doing any consistency / type / error checking) pass a dictionary to `os.path.exists()`.

I'm pretty sure #6235 fixes (at least Sage's) MPL 1.0.0 breaking older installations.

Modifying `$SAGE_ROOT/local/lib/pkgconfig/freetype2.pc` on Sage relocations perhaps fixes later build errors (including upgrades) of dependent packages like MPL; I haven't looked at nor tested the patch though. (Forcing reinstallation of freetype after moving Sage fixes it; but that's of course just a work-around, cf. #9896.)

At least for freetype, it should be possible to simply set `prefix` to `$SAGE_LOCAL` (unexpanded) rather than a hard-coded absolute path. (Done once, e.g. in its `spkg-install`.)

Obviously #9210 doesn't help with upgrades from older versions, i.e. upgrading **to** 4.6. So for 4.6, it's perhaps better to fix the freetype spkg (though even preparing a fake new spkg would suffice for the moment).

Again hard-coding `SAGE_ROOT` into the `.pc` files is IMHO superfluous btw.

For 4.6, I suggest we just bump up the patch level for freetype.  Could you do this and add a link to the new spkg here?
