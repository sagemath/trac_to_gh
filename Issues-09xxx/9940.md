Inequality for the class `AdditiveAbelianGroup` has a bug:

```
sage: AdditiveAbelianGroup([0,0]) == AdditiveAbelianGroup([0,0]) 
True
sage: AdditiveAbelianGroup([0,0]) != AdditiveAbelianGroup([0,0]) 
True
```
This causes doctest failures as reported by mpatel: with the optional CHomP package in 4.5.3 on sage.math, I get some doctest failures.  These vary from run to run:

```python

It seems that other comparisons are not working properly either,

```
sage: G=AdditiveAbelianGroup([0,0])
sage: H=AdditiveAbelianGroup([0,0])
sage: G==H
True
sage: G!=H
True
sage: G<=H
True
sage: H<=G
False
```

`AdditiveAbelianGroup` is implemented as a quotient of finitely-generated modules over ZZ, V/W, and you can get these two modules as follows:

```
sage: G._V
Ambient free module of rank 2 over the principal ideal domain Integer Ring
sage: G._W
Free module of degree 2 and rank 0 over Integer Ring
Echelon basis matrix:
[]
```

The equality of G and H is determined by the `__eq__` method in `sage.modules.fg_pid.fgp_module.FGP_Module_class` which does the obvious thing, checking the equality of the V and W modules.

I cannot seem to figure out how the "non-equality" comparison is accomplished.  I get the impression this could be the logical negation of the equality comparison, automatically, but inserting print statements various places does not verify that hypothesis.

If I rebuild the quotient of modules from the relevant pieces of G and H, then equality and non-equality both behave as expected.

```
sage: X=sage.modules.fg_pid.fgp_module.FGP_Module(G._V, G._W)
sage: Y=sage.modules.fg_pid.fgp_module.FGP_Module(H._V, H._W)
sage: X==Y
True
sage: X!=Y
False
```

So I am at a bit of a loss to understand what is broken in the non-equality of G and H.  But still, a suggestion.  Since equality is implemented in the FGP_Module class, maybe the non-equality, as just the logical opposite, should be implemented at the same level?  In other words, use the same logic as in the patch, but place it as
`sage.modules.fg_pid.fgp_module.FGP_Module_class.__ne__`?  Does that make sense?

It sort of makes sense, and it seems to fix the nonequality problem, but since nonequality already works for these modules, it doesn't seem perfect.  It also doesn't affect the problems with < and >:

```
sage: G=AdditiveAbelianGroup([0,0])

sage: G < H
True
sage: H < G
False

I would really like to understand what's going on here.  I won't be completely happy with a patch until then, I think.

I'm not sure if this helps, but [this documentation about rich comparisons](http://docs.python.org/reference/datamodel.html#object.__ne__) says

  There are no implied relationships among the comparison operators. The truth of `x==y` does not imply that `x!=y` is false. Accordingly, when defining `__eq__()`, one should also define `__ne__()` so that the operators will behave as expected.

The [entry for __cmp__](http://docs.python.org/reference/datamodel.html#object.__cmp__) says

  If no `__cmp__()`, `__eq__()` or `__ne__()` operation is defined, class instances are compared by object identity ("address").

Does not having defined `sage.modules.fg_pid.fgp_module.FGP_Module_class.__ne__` mean that `G != H` amounts to `id(G) != id(H)`?

It seems the only other class that derives [directly] from `FGP_Module_class` is `sage.geometry.toric_lattice.ToricLattice_quotient`, which also doesn't define its own `__eq__` and `__ne__`:

```python
sage: N1 = ToricLattice(3)
sage: sublattice1 = N1.submodule([(1,1,0), (3,2,1)])
sage: Q1 = N1/sublattice1
sage: N2 = ToricLattice(3)
sage: sublattice2 = N2.submodule([(1,1,0), (3,2,1)])
sage: Q2 = N2/sublattice2
sage: Q1 == Q2
True
sage: Q1 != Q2
True
```
Is this expected?

So one question is, is the right thing to do to add methods `__ne__`, `__lt__`, and `__gt__`, and perhaps `__ge__` and `__le__`, to `FGP_Module_class`?

I'm marking this as "needs work", because we should address comparisons like `H<G` at the same time as `H!=G`.

Oh, I see: `FGP_Module` is a **function** which returns identical objects (via the `__init__` method of `FGP_Module_class`) if you pass it the same input.  If you do this:

```
sage: G=AdditiveAbelianGroup([0,0])
sage: from sage.modules.fg_pid.fgp_module import FGP_Module_class
sage: M1 = FGP_Module_class(G.V(), G.W())
sage: M2 = FGP_Module_class(G.V(), G.W())
sage: M1 == M2
True
sage: M1 != M2
True
sage: M1 < M2
True
sage: M1 > M2
False
```
So adding these comparisons to `FGP_Module_class` might be the right thing to do, to deal with the case when people construct these modules without using the helper function `FGP_Module`, using the class instead.

Attachment: **[trac_9940-ne.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9940/trac_9940-ne.patch.gz)**

I think implementing less-than, etc as submodule tests is the right way to go as well.

Patch passes all long tests, and with the experimental package `chomp` installed, patched version also passes:

```
sage -t -long -only-optional=chomp "devel/sage/sage/homology/tests.py"
```

I also installed the (in-progress) patch at #9773 which builds finitely-generated groups on top of this module quotient code.  Limited testing indicates that (a) the current patch behaves as expected, and (b) the comparison methods will apply properly to the subclasses.

Documentation looks good when previewed in the notebook (since it is not included in the reference manual).

So: positive review.  Thanks, John, for pursuing this one.

Rob

Well, I was helped a lot by Mitesh's pointer to the Python docs for `__cmp__`.
