Under Arch Linux, Sage fails to build, giving this error message:

```
bash: symbol lookup error: bash: undefined symbol: rl_filename_rewrite_hook
```
in the middle of the sqlite build (the next package built after readline).  This can also happen on openSUSE Linux.

This is a new symbol that was added in readline 6.1; so I'm pretty sure the problem is because our readline 6.0 is missing that symbol, so trying to run Arch's /bin/bash with our LD_LIBRARY_PATH will fail.

We should upgrade our readline spkg to 6.1; I bet that would fix the problem.

An updated .spkg can be found at
http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/readline-6.1.spkg 
which is based on readline-6.0.p4.spkg from #9530.

Hello, I'm the maintainer of sage-mathematics in the AUR. I think I have worked around this issue with 4.5-2 by not building sage's libreadline, and as a result, using the system's readline :)

BTW, this error is supposedly worked around by sage, by checking if uname -r | grep ARCH returns anything. Which means that people with custom kernels are likely to be experiencing this problem.

Somewhat related is #9987 

Readline can definitely be built on AIX -  see for example 

http://www.perzl.org/aix/index.php?n=Main.Readline

so something is wrong in how Sage is using readline.

I've updated the source code, and cleaned up the package a bit. If others want to clean it up further, feel free, but I don't want to spend a lot of time on this. It is not even causing any problems on any systems I'm using. The .spkg can be found here.

http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/patches/readline-6.1.spkg

I've checked the new .spkg actually builds on the following systems
* AIX 5.3 (my own RS/6000 7025 F50 'aixbox') I did **not** try to resolve #9987
* HP-UX 11.11B (my own HP C3600 'hpbox')
* Linux (sage.math)
* OpenSolaris 06/2009 (my own Sun Ultra 27 'hawk' which is a Sage buildbot slave.)
* OS X (bsd.math)
* Solaris 10 SPARC ('mark' on skynet, which is a Sun Blade 2500)
 
I've checked that the whole of Sage builds, and passes all doctests 

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 1740.4 seconds
drkirkby@hawk:~/sage-4.6.rc0$ 
```

with the updated .spkg on only the following system. 

* OpenSolaris (my own Sun Ultra 27 'hawk' which is a Sage buildbot slave)

I've **not** checked this on any of the systems which have been known to cause issues with readline (FreeBSD, ArchLinux, OpenSUSE etc).

This now needs review. 

Please test, especially on platforms where there has been problems with readline, which appear to be many!

I've now added an `spkg-check` file and run `make check` as there is a `check` target, but it does not actually do anything useful at this time. Hopefully the readline developers will add some self-tests.

Hi David !

Thanks for taking care of that. I'm trying to compile sage 4.6.rc0 with your
readline spkg on a 64 bits openSuSE 11.3. It seems to work ! My machine is now
compiling ATLAS and the "undefined symbol" vanished. However, as I posted on
[sage-release](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-release/browse_thread/thread/bb636656e2153332?hl=en_US), it seems that there is another problem on this architecture. So I don't think I'll get a working sage.

A few comments:

* The way `CFLAGS` (and `CXXFLAGS`) are set overrides user-specified settings (`-O2`, `-Wall`).
* The handling of `SAGE_DEBUG` is inconsistent (and does not disable optimization):

```sh
# If SAGE_DEBUG is set either unset (the default), or set to  'yes'
# then add debugging information.
# Since both the Sun and GNU compilers accept -g to give debugging information,
# there is no need to do anything specific to one compiler or the other.

if [ "x$SAGE_DEBUG" = "x" ] || [ "x$SAGE_DEBUG" = "xyes" ] ; then
   echo "Code will be built with debugging information present. Set 'SAGE_DEBUG' to 'no' if you don't want that."
   # Actually anything other than 'yes' or '1' will cause
   # no debugging information to be added.
   CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -g "
   CXXFLAGS="$CXXFLAGS -g "
else
   echo "No debugging information will be used during the build of this package."
   echo "Unset SAGE_DEBUG if you want debugging information present (-g added)."
fi
```
   I would add debugging symbols by default anyway.
* `make` is used instead of `$MAKE`. I don't know why we do the build and install in one call.
* The following is most probably wrong for readline 6.1:

```sh
elif [ "$UNAME" = "OpenBSD" ]; then
  DYLIB_NAME="$SAGE_LOCAL"/lib/libreadline.so.6.0
```
* The following should simply be `if grep -q ... ; then ...`:

```sh
    if [ `grep 11.1 /etc/SuSE-release > /dev/null; echo $?` -eq 0 ]; then
```
   (or at least `if grep ... >/dev/null; then ...`). The preceding `test -f` is also superfluous, but I agree makes it perhaps more readable.
* The use of `set +/-e` is quite confusing and error-prone, and its use is **definitely wrong here**, since we don't get the exit status of "copying patches" and, worse, `build()`:

```sh
...
set -e
...
cp patches/shobj-conf src/support/
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Error copying patch over."
    exit 1
fi

cd src/

build()
{
    ./configure --prefix="$SAGE_LOCAL" $CONF_FLAGS
    make install
}

build
set +e
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Error building and installing readline."
    exit 1
fi
set -e
...
```
* It is safer to quote (all instances of) `$UNAME`.
* The `build()` functions is almost useless, and in fact does `make install` (see above).

I originally wanted to set this to "needs info" (w.r.t. OpenBSD), but now I think at least *some of* the above really needs to be fixed, therefore "needs work".

P.S.: Do we at all still need to use the system's readline on OpenSuSE 11.1?

Leif, 

I'd agree the OpenBSD code is probably wrong, though with nobody at all working on an OpenBSD port to my knowledge, I don't know how we are going to find out. But I'm willing to change that. To my knowledge, only FreeBSD is being worked on by Peter, with nobody working on NetBSD, OpenBSD or any other *BSD. 

With the possible exception of that, I don't believe my changes have introduced any new problems. I simply don't have time to go though another ticket like #9603, where there were endless changes to `spkg-install` which took 6 weeks. 

Many of those proposed will need extensive testing, which I don't have time for. As I remarked above:

*If others want to clean it up further, feel free, but I don't want to spend a lot of time on this. It is not even causing any problems on any systems I'm using.* 

I'd rather concentrate my time on sorting out #9040 and #9840. I suggest you create another ticket to clean this up if you feel it needs it. Sorry, but I just don't want another ticket like #9603! 

I've got no idea of the situation with OpenSUSE

I didn't say you introduced them, doesn't make a difference to me though.

That had a couple of reasons. All my suggestions are above, and as I said *some* of them are minor, but at the same time most of them trivial to fix without risk.

(Cf. the Cython upgrade, where I just "cleaned up" the `spkg-install` by moving `cd src`, and Robert at the same time - with the original spkg - ran into exactly the potential error to make by copying the patches at the wrong point of the script, which one would not even have noticed when installing the spkg.)

I don't agree; also, the handling of `SAGE_DEBUG` e.g. and the use of `set -e` is simply wrong **as it is now**.

It doesn't make sense to me to keep definite flaws in it, and postpone fixing them to yet another ticket. And I don't have time for such either, not to mention every new ticket needs new review and testing again.

It's currently a blocker, but meanwhile one for 4.6**.1**.

Me either, but the reason for upgrading readline was OpenSuSE!

> I've got no idea of the situation with OpenSUSE

I'm using openSuSE 11.3 (the latest) on a 64 bits machine and I've the following behavior:

- The openSuSE binary for 4.5.2, 4.5.3 *doesn't start* unless the following files are removed from sage install:

```
libreadline.a  libreadline.so  libreadline.so.6  libreadline.so.6.0
```
It seems to works perfectly of those are removed (I got all tests passed with 4.5.2). 

- The 4.5.2 and 4.5.3 source doesn't compile either. I got it compile and work with the patch on #9530 (all test passed on 4.5.3)

- The 4.6rc0 seem to compile correctly using David's spkg, however for a probably different reason it doesn't start, failing with the error

```
ImportError: No module named sagenb.misc.sphinxify
```

I've no idea how to fix this last error and as I said previously I asked for
help on sage-release.


Also, if needed I have access on a older openSuSE 11.1 system but I haven't
upgraded sage on it recently.

Cheers,

Florent

It would be helpful if you could try to build Sage 4.6.rc0 on that, too (upgrading from a - perhaps copied - working Sage version should also work), to see if the same error occurs as on OpenSuSE 11.3.

Well, I would consider changing `make` to `$MAKE` less important for the moment, as - as you say - *that* requires more testing, in contrast to the other changes.

Note that e.g.

```sh
$ env MAKE="make -j" ./sage -i readline-6.1.spkg
```
(or copying the spkg to `spkg/standard/` and running `env MAKE="make -j" make`) would currently attempt a parallel build / install anyway, even though you call `make` in `spkg-install`.

---

It's quite funny to enable `-Wall` in a script and at the same time keep blocks of unreachable code in the script itself.

---

Btw, `ptestlong` passed with 4.6.rc0 on Ubuntu 10.04 x86_64 both with just that spkg as well as all dependent packages [re]built.

I've successfully reinstalled / rebuilt the updated spkg and all dependent packages* (with 32 jobs); `ptestlong` again passed.

I build Sage from scratch with the updated .spkg on a Sun Ultra 27 running OpenSolaris. This was a parallel build, and parallel doctests. Two doctests failed

```
The following tests failed:

        sage -t  -long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/interfaces/psage.py # 1 doctests failed
        sage -t  -long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/algebras/quatalg/quaternion_algebra_element.pyx # 0 doctests failed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Total time for all tests: 1675.4 seconds
```

But when I run those two tests individually they both passed. I can only assume this is the usual problem - the doctesting framework is partially broken for parallel testing. 

```
drkirkby@hawk:~/sage-4.6.rc0$ ./sage -t  -long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/interfaces/psage.py
sage -t -long -force_lib "devel/sage/sage/interfaces/psage.py"
         [24.9 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 25.4 seconds
drkirkby@hawk:~/sage-4.6.rc0$ ./sage -t  -long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/algebras/quatalg/quaternion_algebra_element.pyx
sage -t -long -force_lib "devel/sage/sage/algebras/quatalg/quaternion_algebra_element.pyx"
         [13.0 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 13.0 seconds
drkirkby@hawk:~/sage-4.6.rc0$ 
```

As such, Sage has been build from scratch using this package, and has passed all tests on both Linux and OpenSolaris.

"presidence" sould be "precedence"

Why is `patches/shobj-conf` under revision control?  I believe it is sufficient for the patch file to be under revision control (but putting the *patched* files also under revision control might be the usual Sage practice).

I don't like `"$CC" -flags > /dev/null 2>&1` (`spkg-install` line 43) for various reasons:
* I don't think $CC is supposed to be quoted because people might do things like CC="gcc -m64"
* You should redirect stdin from `/dev/null` in case $CC wants to read from stdin.
* Instead of checking for Sun's compiler, why not check explicitly for `gcc` using

```
$CC </dev/null >/dev/null 2>/dev/null --version |grep >/dev/null gcc
```

I'm unaware of any problems with the current code.

I forget why, but there was some reason that I did not use the obvious 'gcc --version'. Several compilers act like gcc, but are not actually gcc. I believe the Intel compiler takes the gcc options, so for practical purposes is gcc, but wont output gcc. In any case, I think one can change that string when gcc is built to whatever you want. 

However, if someone wants to change the test, then the most sensible thing to do is use the script $SAGE_LOCAL/bin/testcc.sh, as that will return one of 

* GCC
* Sun_Studio
* HP_on_Tru64
* IBM_on_AIX
* HP_on_Alpha_Linux
* Unknown

That tests what gets defined when (!__SUNPRO_C in the case of the Sun compiler, !__GNUC!__ in the case of gcc etc). 

There are bugs that I'm aware of, that are causing serious problems - #9040 and #9840 are two I would love to solve. I'm reluctant to make a change, which itself has a finite risk of introducing a bug, to "solve" a problem that has never been observed. That bit of code has remained unchanged for a long time, and has never caused any problem on any platform.

Really?  With `GNU bash, version 4.0.35(1)-release (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)`, I get

```
$ CC="gcc -m64"
$ "$CC" --version
bash: gcc -m64: command not found

Me neither, but I think redirecting stdin from `/dev/null` does no harm and is safer.

Well, that's of course b*llsh*t, since the old source code is in the old spkg you're going to upgrade. But it is long and current practice, as Dave says.

A more convincing reason is that it is safer to put both under revision control, since some people might update just the patch and not the patched file which is copied over. This is easy to see with `hg log`, though one would also notice that by just looking at the file modification times.

> I'm not totally convinced of the logic myself, but it is standard practice. (I'd personally rather just see a patch file, and use 'patch' rather than 'cp', but that is not permitted).

In the light of 1 MB `configure.in` etc. in `patches/` and the Mercurial repository, I'd also rather have just the patches (diffs) there, i.e. omitting pre-patched files at all.

This would either require (explicitly) making `patch` a prerequisite (which is IMHO not a problem), or - perhaps in addition - providing `ed` patches, with isn't very nice (and complicates reviewing).

As Jeroen noted, this *does* make a difference. I do not even get an error message:

```sh

I wanted to make a reviewer patch anyway, since we need to also patch the `pkg-config` file created by freetype to avoid potential trouble with Sage relocation. (Btw, the term "migration" would be less ambiguous, though it is used in other contexts as well, but certainly not within Sage.)

I long ago created a package for 'patch'

I think William finally agreed to make it part of sage, since many wanted it. But then after that others had convinced him there were better ways do it with Mercurial, so I gave up the idea. 

Leif, what has the pkg-config file for freetype got to do with this readline package? 

Do you want to create a reviewer patch, or shall I unquote CC?

Of course it incidentally "works" *there*, because we are not looking for `gcc`. If you define `CC="suncc -whatever"` it won't work, i.e. not recognize Sun's `cc`.

I think we don't have to provide a (standard) package to make `patch` a prerequisite.

Note that Mercurial depends on Python, so unless we make one of these a prerequisite, using Mercurial instead (which I wouldn't like) isn't an option.

Good question... ;-) Apparently wrong ticket... (Confused that because updating the readline spkg *triggered* the `pkg-config` problems with freetype.)

I can do that, as I've suggested some other minor changes [above](#comment:28).

I had difficulty merging the changes made on this ticket to the changes made in readline-6.0.p4.spkg (see #9530). There were a lot of rejects and I was less confident of sorting them out, then doing the changes manually. 

As such, I've taken the readline-6.0.p4.spkg, and manually made the changes originally made here. It's not totally impossible I've missed one, but I think they are ok. 

So I'm attaching a new patch, `9523-brand-new-patch-based-on-readline-6.0.p4.patch` which should have all the changes need to sort out the update, and clean the package somewhat. 

The updated package can be found at 

http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/readline-6.1.spkg

Would you be happy with that?

It seems to be specific to these two Linux distributions - though perhaps there are others, as one Linux distro tends to be based on another. Mint is based on Ubuntu, which is itself based on Debian. 

Most other distros don't ship with a bash that is dynamically linked to readline. It's never been a problem on Solaris or OS X either. Although I've never built Sage fully on either AIX or HP-UX, I'm not aware of any bash/readline issues on those operating systems either. 

Unless someone is willing to set up an OpenSUSE system for people to test on, I can't really see how we can support the latest release. 

http://wiki.sagemath.org/SupportedPlatforms#Linux

says 11.1 is supported, and 11.2 and 11.3 are known to be broken. 

I simply don't have access to the hardware/software to test this. 

William posted a few weeks ago he was wanting people to administer virtual machines. Unless someone is going to do this for the latest OpenSUSE, then I can't see how we can support it. I already admin two machines myself which are buildbot slavs (*hawk* and *t2*).

Just provide an spkg and let the others test (and review) it... ;-)

(until we get more build slaves, running these distros.)

As mentioned on sage-devel, a work-around for a Bash broken by Sage's readline is to set its `RPATH` or `RUNPATH` (with `chrpath`). We could give a hint to that in an error (or warning) message in case we detect installing our readline would break `bash` (but don't know for sure using the system's libreadline will work for us).

s/set its `RPATH`/change an existing `RPATH` or `RUNPATH`/

or use `patchelf`, which also supports **creating** / adding such tags.


Another work-around is to set up a `bash` wrapper that (re)sets `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`... ;-)

I've been testing openSUSE lately - and theory and practice are completely reversed. Sage does not build on 11.1 due to readline 5.x being the default there. Whereas on openSUSE 11.2 and 11.3, Sage builds properly (a recent 4.6.1.rc0 snapshot).
However, I'm not sure how to test if my final Sage 'works' w.r.t. the readline/bash problem, so I will only claim that it builds and sage starts properly.

We shouldn't have to drop support for that, installing / using our 6.1 package should work there as well.

(Bash would still use the system's 5.x version.)

We just have to fix / remove the old copying stuff... (and I would add the mentioned sanity check).

I've done that. I created the package. It's now marked as "needs work" but it is going to need to be worked on by someone else. 

In general, I very much like the approach taken by `autoconf`, where instead of having a huge lookup table detailing what version of what OS supports this function or that function, it actually **tests** the functionality. Overall that seems a far more logical approach to me, and seems to be what Jeroen is proposing. If we can **test** the functionality of bash, rather than having code that attempts to find a specific Linux release, then testing seems a better way forward.

Ok. If you're not going to change it further, I can do that in the next days.

Well, autotools, or the scripts their files are built from, have a lot of knowledge coded into them (like chess programs, or e.g. `gcc`, too), i.e. they also - at least partially - detect the system and make the choices based on that.

(And packages using autotools still have `configure` options like `--with-package-xy=/path/to/package-xy`, `--with-included-package-xy` and `--with-system-package-xy`, and lots of `--disable-*` and `--enable-*` one sometimes *has to* specify manually.

Also, GCC does drop support of older platforms, OSs and architectures, due to a lack of developer resources.)


Feel free to extend Sage's `configure` (which really could do much more, setting appropriate environment variables [like your famous `CFLAG64`] etc.)...

But Sage is (also) a distro with many "foreign" packages, not just a program, and to make things work together, we have to make choices normally a user would make - manually - for each of Sage's packages.

The user can still fake Sage's readline was already installed such that Sage will use the system's one, but that requires some more reading and typing than just issuing `make` (or double-clicking the Makefile). ;-)

Same for other packages.

As far as readline is concerned, I think the current state is a definite improvement. Since there is really no remaining issue that can be fixed easy, I give this a positive review so that we can go ahead with releasing Sage-4.6.1.
