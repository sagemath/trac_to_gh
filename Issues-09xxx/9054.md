One of the first things we learned at Sage Days 21: Function Fields, is that it is not even possible to really define or even do arithmetic in function fields *at all* in Sage!  It's amazing that this most basic arithmetic still isn't supported, but it isn't (maybe it used to be via generic machinery, but got broken...?).  The point of this ticket is to create classes for standard function field structures, along with support for arithmetic.   This should be organized in a way similar to number fields. 

For this code, the main point is to establish an API that works solidly.  It will be insanely slow.  A subsequent patch will make things fast. 

See also: #9069, #9051, #9094, #9095.

Note that the dependancy on #9138 is only because of a really minor change in the doctests. This ticket already has a positive review so I suspect this will get merged first. If that ticket eventually gets rejected it will be trivial to rebase the patch withouth that ticket.

Apply [attachment:9054_function_fields.patch] to the Sage library.

The above is correct.  To get what you want, use the constant_field() method. 

```
sage: K.<t> = FunctionField(QQ);
sage: K.constant_field()
Rational Field

 One of the first things we learned at Sage Days 21: Function Fields, is that it is not even possible to really define or even do arithmetic in function fields *at all* in Sage!  It's amazing that this most basic arithmetic still isn't supported, but it isn't (maybe it used to be via generic machinery, but got broken...?).

<a id='comment:29'></a>The doctests of `function_field.py` contain the following lines:

```
sage: R.<x> = FunctionField(QQ); S.<y> = R[]
sage: R2.<t> = FunctionField(QQ); S2.<w> = R2[]
sage: L2.<w> = R.extension((4*w)^2 - (t+1)^3 - 1)
```
I think it is confusing that it does not make a difference whether you write R.extension or R2.extension in this example. I'm new to sage so maybe I'm misunderstanding something here.

Entering the following at the sage prompt produces a `TypeError: Unable to coerce -u^2 (...) to Rational`.

```
K.<x> = FunctionField(QQ); R.<y> = K[]
L.<y> = K.extension(y^2 - x)
M.<u> = FunctionField(QQ); R.<v> = M[]
N.<v> = M.extension(v-u^2)
L.hom([u,v])
```
This is due to the fact that `hom()` determines the codomain by looking only at the first element of `[u,v]`.

Looking at [attachment:trac_9054-all-parts.patch], I see that the base class for function fields is derived from `sage.rings.ring.Field`, but `Field.__init__` is not called.

The rings in vanilla Sage do not pay enough attention to coercion and categories. #9944 and (in particular) #9138 aim at improving the situation. In particular, with #9138 it should now possible to avoid any direct call to `ParentWithGens.__init__`; calling `Field.__init__` should just work (tm). Can you try?

Technically this is true.

+1.  Note that when the very first version of the function field code was written (by me) `@`cached_method was disturbingly slow.  I really, really appreciate the fast Cython rewrite.

A while ago, I had worked on a ticket #10667 about category containment. One purpose was to get a speedup. The trick was (again) to use Cython. For some reason, the work on that ticket has stalled. Perhaps it would be worth while to resume it.

Generally, I think it is better to improve the category framework, rather than to work around it.

>  For example, see #11657, where one of the root causes of slowness was code in is_Ring that was added to support this category approach, and which slowed everything down.


Then why is the existing `is_Ring` not rewritten along the lines of what you do in #11657?

> is_Ring is only deprecated when used from the top level (i.e., the Sage prompt).


Yes, this is what I meant. I did not mean "deprecated" in the sense of "will soon be removed", but in the sense of "please don't try this at home".

>  And the is_Ring function does test for category stuff. 


Actually I have not been aware that category stuff is tested in `is_Ring`. I was thinking about various other `is_...` methods that really do nothing more than isinstance.

Ouch, so I was mistaken.

Not needed. What I stated was based on reading the patch "diagonally". I only noticed one of the two base_field methods.

What I did there slows down `is_Ring` testing if the object in question does not derive from Ring.

If you are developing on the Sage library, I think it is OK to use.

Thanks for the help and suggestions. But sadly it did not help (altough I find #9138 a very cool ticket it's good to make a lot of rings finally more consistent with the current model of doing things with the category framework).

<a id='comment:45'></a>Just for your information: I resumed work on #10667. 

Testing whether QQ is a ring works faster with the methods from #11115 and #10667 than with using the current `is_Ring`:

```
sage: C = CommutativeRings().objects()
sage: QQ in C
True
sage: %timeit QQ in C
625 loops, best of 3: 3.88 µs per loop
```
versus

```
sage: from sage.rings.ring import is_Ring
sage: %timeit is_Ring(QQ)
625 loops, best of 3: 5.06 µs per loop
```

Of course, just testing the class is a lot faster:

```
sage: from sage.rings.ring import Ring
sage: %timeit isinstance(QQ,Ring)
625 loops, best of 3: 666 ns per loop
```

**__Testing commutative rings__**

The function `is_CommutativeRing` does nothing but testing the class. But it is a Python function. Let us compare its speed with the speed of a Cython container, testing category containment.

`is_CommutativeRing`:

```
sage: from sage.rings.commutative_ring import is_CommutativeRing
sage: is_CommutativeRing??
...
Source:
def is_CommutativeRing(R):
    return isinstance(R, CommutativeRing)
sage: is_CommutativeRing(QQ)
True
sage: s = SymmetricGroup(4)
sage: is_CommutativeRing(s)
False
sage: %timeit is_CommutativeRing(QQ)
625 loops, best of 3: 1.09 µs per loop
sage: %timeit is_CommutativeRing(s)
625 loops, best of 3: 3.51 µs per loop
```

Cython container:

```
sage: O = CommutativeRings().objects()
sage: QQ in O
True
sage: s in O
False
sage: %timeit QQ in O
625 loops, best of 3: 1.5 µs per loop
sage: %timeit s in O
625 loops, best of 3: 1.46 µs per loop
```
Hence, when applied to a symmetric group, the container performs a category containment test (with negative result, of course) that is *faster* than a Python class check!

**__Testing rings__**

As you have observed, the current `is_Ring` function is suboptimal. I rewrote it in #10667.

Without #10667 (but with #11115 for a fast cache):

```
sage: from sage.rings.ring import is_Ring
sage: MS = MatrixSpace(QQ,2)
sage: %timeit is_Ring(QQ)
625 loops, best of 3: 5.1 µs per loop
sage: is_Ring(MS)
True
sage: %timeit is_Ring(MS)
625 loops, best of 3: 17.3 µs per loop
sage: C = Rings()
sage: %timeit QQ in C
625 loops, best of 3: 4.18 µs per loop
sage: %timeit MS in C
625 loops, best of 3: 4.31 µs per loop
```
With #10667 in addition:

```
sage: from sage.rings.ring import is_Ring
sage: MS = MatrixSpace(QQ,2)
sage: %timeit is_Ring(QQ)
625 loops, best of 3: 259 ns per loop
sage: %timeit is_Ring(MS)
625 loops, best of 3: 17.5 µs per loop
sage: C = Rings().objects()
sage: %timeit QQ in C
625 loops, best of 3: 1.49 µs per loop
sage: %timeit MS in C
625 loops, best of 3: 1.57 µs per loop
```

A more detailed description of the patches since `trac_9054-invert_ideal.patch`:
 
* `trac_9054_isFunctionField.patch` hopefully does what Simon King proposed for `is_FunctionField`
* `trac_9054_UniqueFactory.patch` replaces the ``@`cached_method` in `constructor.py` with UniqueFactories -- apparently that class is meant for that purpose
* `trac_9054_cached_method.patch` replaces all manual caching with ``@`cached_method` methods
* `trac_9054_maximal_order_member_check.patch` fixes a todo about checking that members  passed to an `_element_constructor` are actually in the order
* `trac_9054_call_super_constructors.patch` is the one I'm not sure about. At two places the super classes were not properly called -- was that by intention? I hope this fixes it.
* `trac_9054_maps_refactor.patch` slightly changes the base classes of function field morphisms
* `trac_9054_doctests-3.patch` essentially unifies the naming of variables in the doctests, so function fields are now called K and L, variables x, y, z. Also I added an entry to `/doc/en/reference/index.rst`, is that correct?
* `trac_9054_cleanup.patch` reorganizes some imports and removes empty lines
* `trac_9054_authors.patch` adds authors and copyrights to the files. I followed [http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/conventions.html#headings-of-sage-library-code-files](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/conventions.html#headings-of-sage-library-code-files), hopefully I got it right?

I also reviewed Maarten's changes and they looked good except for the very few things I patched here. Maarten could you review my patches? It looks like a lot of work, but it should be fairly trivial to review.

<a id='comment:67'></a>Ok these are the results from reading trough you patches:

Why did you make some_elements in function_field.py return only one element? This number should be at least two (and preferable even at least 3) since else a lot of tests in TestSuite(F).run() will be meaningless with just one element because one element is always equal to itself for example!

If you make vector_space a cached method then why don't you change

```
self._vector_space = (V, from_V, to_V) 
return self._vector_space 
```
to

```
return (V, from_V, to_V) 
```
This code is in two places.

In function_field_order.py there is a typo in the sentence "the function field in which this iss an order."

Why did you remove:

```
if is_Ideal(gens): 
    gens = gens.gens() 
```
in function_field_order.py. I suspect the code was there to make the (not doctested) use case of:

```
sage: K.<x> = FunctionField(QQ) 
sage: O=K.maximal_order()
sage: I=O.ideal(x)
sage: O.ideal(I)
```
since you should be able to make an ideal with input an ideal.

For the rest your combination patch looks very nice. Also good that you made the documentation quality so much higher. If you either answer the above questions with the right arguments or if you change them back it seems that we can finally have function fields in sage!

I think I had seen that somewhere else only one element was returned and copied that. (at that time I didn't know what some_elements() was good for)
I'll fix that.

That's true. Must have missed that.

Will be fixed in the next patch.

Good question. It's part of a doctest patch so I guess it just got in by accident.

> For the rest your combination patch looks very nice. Also good that you made the documentation quality so much higher. If you either answer the above questions with the right arguments or if you change them back it seems that we can finally have function fields in sage!
Ok. I'll prepare a patch to fix these issues. Thanks you took the time and had a look at these patches. :)

Maarten, I'm not so sure about the is_Ideal() check anymore. Is it really expected behavior that ideal(I) creates the ideal generated by the generators of I — no matter where the ideal I lives? If you feel like that should happen, then add these two lines again and set the ticket to positive review. Or don't add them if you feel that people should be more explicit by actually calling ideal(I.gens()).
