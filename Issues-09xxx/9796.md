<a id='comment:3'>**Comment 3:**</a>
This looks good.  Running:

```
sage -testall -long
```
gives that all doctests pass except five unrelated tests (in sage/plot/plot3d/tachyon.py and sage/plot/plot3d/base.pyx) that also fail in an unpatched copy of Sage (version 4.6.1, built from source on 64-bit Linux).
