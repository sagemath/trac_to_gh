I've run valgrind with a clean startup and quit:

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/rlmill/sage-clean.mem.log

and with an execution of the following loop:

```
for i in range(1000):
    if i%50 == 0:
        print i
    a = ZZ(randint(2^400,2^800)).sqrt()
    b = Mod(2^32+1,3).sqrt()
```

Of particular importance are lines 18757, 16971, 16915, 16831, etc. (Just search through for "definitely")

I'm not so sure about this. Let's pick on this particular leak:

On line 3842 of `multi_polynomial_libsingular.pyx`, we have:

```
        if _ring.ringtype != 0:
            if _ring.ringtype == 4:
                P = self._parent.change_ring(RationalField())
                res = P(self).gcd(P(right))
                coef = sage.rings.integer.GCD_list(self.coefficients() + right.coefficients())   <--------------------
                return self._parent(coef*res)
```

The calls to `.coefficients()` are creating the integers which are not freed. Here is the definition of that function:

```
        cdef poly *p
        cdef ring *r
        r = (<MPolynomialRing_libsingular>self._parent)._ring
        if r!=currRing: rChangeCurrRing(r)
        base = (<MPolynomialRing_libsingular>self._parent)._base
        p = self._poly
        coeffs = list()
        while p:
            coeffs.append(si2sa(p_GetCoeff(p, r), r, base))
            p = pNext(p)
        return coeffs
```

Looks innocent enough... `si2sa` ends up calling:

```
cdef Integer si2sa_ZZ(number *n, ring *_ring):
    ...
    cdef Integer z
    z = Integer()
    z.set_from_mpz(<__mpz_struct*>n)
    return z
```

I really don't see where any of this could be going wrong. I think it has to do with the fast integer creation functions. Sage has a pool of allocated Integer objects. The `integer_pool_count` seems to go up and down randomly, staying in the low range. From one loop to the next, in the original poster's first example, it goes 9, 8, 11, 10, ...

I think that the experts for this memory pool need to step up to the plate...

The first reported memory leak is still there, but note that you don't need the extemely large random integers i the example to expose the leak. All you need is a non square integer.

Doing the example only with squares in the interval 2!^400 till 2!^800:

```
m = get_memory_usage()
i=0
while True:
    i+=1
    a = ZZ(randint(2^200,2^400)^2).sqrt()
    if i%1000==0:
        print get_memory_usage(m)
```

```
0.0
0.0
0.0
0.0
```
The example using 2 as my favorite non square integer:

```
m = get_memory_usage()
i=0
while True:
    i+=1
    a = 2.sqrt()
    if i%1000==0:
        print get_memory_usage(m)
```

```

I dived a bit deeper into the source code to see what is actually going on and I found that in the end the symbolic ring sqrt function is the one where things go wrong. It's not the general symbolic ring framework since other symbolic ring functions dont misbehave.

```
functions=['arccos', 'arccosh',
'arcsin', 'arcsinh', 'arctan', 'arctanh', 'cos', 'cosh', 'exp', 'log', 'sin', 'sinh', 'sqrt', 'tan', 'tanh']
for function in functions:
    print function
    a=SR(2)
    m = get_memory_usage()
    for i in xrange(10000):
        b=a.__getattribute__(function)()
    print get_memory_usage(m)
```
arccos
0.0
arccosh
0.0
arcsin
0.0
arcsinh
0.0
arctan
0.0
arctanh
0.0
cos
0.0
cosh
0.0
exp
0.0
log
0.0
sin
0.0
sinh
0.0
sqrt
7.03125
tan
0.0
tanh
0.0

I'm not able to figure out which code get's called from the symbolic ring part on, since the internal working of the symbolic ring is a bit to complex for me.
Ie. the source code of SR(2).sqrt is

```
return new_Expression_from_GEx(self._parent,
                g_hold2_wrapper(g_power_construct, self._gobj, g_ex1_2, hold))
```
And new_Expression_from_GEx doesn't have any documentation or whatsoever.

the problem seems to be in the power function. With Sage 4.6:

```
sage: a=SR(2)
sage: m = get_memory_usage()
sage: for i in xrange(10000):
....:     b=a.__pow__(1/3)
....:     
sage: print get_memory_usage(m)
11.953125
```

William, Burcin, the memory leaks seems to be in the `g_pow` call at line 2458 of
`symbolic/expression.pyx` (in sage 4.6).

I guess the `g_pow` function is a wrapper to Ginac (from file `libs/ginac/decl.pxi`)
but I could see no occurrence of pow in `c_lib/include/ginac_wrap.h`.

Please can you help?

<div id="comment:20" align="right">comment:20</div>

I added some print-statements in `pynac-0.2.3.p0/src/ginac/numeric.cpp` as follows:

```
  Number_T pow(const Number_T& base, const Number_T& exp) {
    std::cerr << "enter pow, base=" << base << " exp=" << exp << "\n";
    verbose("pow");
    if (base.t != exp.t) {
      Number_T a, b;
      std::cerr << "coerce\n";
      coerce(a, b, base, exp);
      return pow(a,b);
    }
    switch (base.t) {
    case DOUBLE:
      std::cerr << "double\n";
      return std::pow(base.v._double, exp.v._double);
    case LONG:
      // TODO: change to use GMP!                                               
      std::cerr << "long\n";
      return std::pow((double)base.v._long, (double)exp.v._long);
    case PYOBJECT:
      std::cerr << "PYOBJECT\n";
      if PyInt_Check(base.v._pyobject) {
          PyObject* o = Integer(PyInt_AsLong(base.v._pyobject));
          PyObject* r = PyNumber_Power(o, exp.v._pyobject, Py_None);
          std::cerr << "PyInt_Check\n";
          Py_DECREF(o);
          return r;
      }
      return PyNumber_Power(base.v._pyobject, exp.v._pyobject, Py_None);
    default:
      stub("invalid type: pow Number_T");
    }
  }
```
Then it seems that for inexact powers that function is called twice for SR input:

```
sage: SR(2).__pow__(1/2)
enter pow, base=2 exp=1/2
PYOBJECT
enter pow, base=2 exp=1/2
PYOBJECT
sqrt(2)
```
but for exact powers only once:

```
sage: SR(4).__pow__(1/2)
enter pow, base=4 exp=1/2
PYOBJECT
2
```

For Integer input we get:

```
sage: Integer(2).__pow__(1/2)
enter pow, base=2 exp=1/2
PYOBJECT
sqrt(2)
sage: Integer(4).__pow__(1/2)
2
```

For ZZ input we get:

```
sage: ZZ(2).__pow__(1/2)
enter pow, base=2 exp=1/2
PYOBJECT
sqrt(2)
sage: ZZ(4).__pow__(1/2)
2
```
In all cases there is no memory leak for exact powers, but there is for inexact powers.
Thus I strongly suspect some special code that detects exact powers, but where is it?

The `__pow__` method of rational numbers. :) When computing `2^(1/2)`, `Integer.__pow__` delegates the operation to `Rational.__pow__`. If the result is not exact, `Rational.__pow__` returns a symbolic expression.

This should really be tested with the patch at #8659, which eliminates the need to call `Number_T::pow()` twice. Even with that patch, the leak is still there however.

I'm not sure what the current status of work on this ticket is, but I have noticed that
the following functions do not exhibit the demonstrated memory leak.

```
def memleaksr(n, x, p=1/2):
    m = get_memory_usage()
    one_half = SR(.5)
    for i in xrange(n):
        a = SR(x)^one_half
        if(i % 1000 == 0):
            print get_memory_usage(m)
```


```
def memleakonehalf(n, x, p=1/2):
    m = get_memory_usage()

    for i in xrange(n):
        a = SR(x) ** 1/2
        if(i % 1000 == 0):
            print get_memory_usage(m)
```

From what I understand, 
2.sqrt() calls the sqrt() method of the Integer class.
sqrt() 
eventually sage.functions.other._do_sqrt() is called.  If _do_sqrt is passed a precision argument, everything works fine.  The memory leak seems to occur when no precision is set.  Something about the variable one_half in _do_sqrt() seems to throw a kink in things.

Recap: If any precision is set, then there is no memory leak (2.sqrt(prec=52) == no memory leak)

Yes, 2.sqrt() does still have a memory leak in 6.0

You're right, I wasn't thinking.  2.sqrt() returns a symbolic expression.  My examples return a real number.

> Feel free to file the upstream bug report faster next time ;-) 

the problem is that I had no idea in which upstream component the leak was (or in Sage), and I had no idea how to search where the leak was.

If you can give some information how we can do this in similar cases, it would be very helpful.

Fwiw, I used the `objgraph` module to see what kind of objects were being leaked. It turned out to be triples similar to those returned by `pynac.pyx`:`py_rational_power_parts`—the hardest part was probably to discover that function, but the observation that the leak occurred specifically for non-square integers helped.
