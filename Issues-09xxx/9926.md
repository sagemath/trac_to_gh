Of course, an easy fix to this is to put "#random output" comment in the doctest, but it does not feel satisfactory in this case.

I think the problem is that `cddlib` uses `rand()` to sometimes make random initial choices while searching for generating sets. Although `cddlib` fixes the seed, there is no guarantee that different platforms implement `rand()` in the same way.

To make sure this is indeed the problem, can you run

```
sage: Polyhedron(vertices=[(0, 1), (1, 1), (0, 1), (-1, 1), (0, 2), (0, -1), (0, 0), (0, 0), (3, -1), (0, 2), (0, -1), (1, -1), (0, 0)], verbose=True)

 1 1 1
 1 0 1
 1 -1 1
 1 0 2
 1 0 -1
 1 0 0
 1 0 0
 1 3 -1
 1 0 2
 1 0 -1
 1 1 -1
 1 0 0
end

V-representation
begin
 4 3 rational
 1 -1 1
 1 0 2
 1 0 -1
 1 3 -1
end

H-representation
begin
 4 3 rational
 2 1 -1
 1 2 1
 1 0 1
 2 -1 -1
end
A 2-dimensional polyhedron in QQ^2 defined as the convex hull of 4 vertices.
```
on the OSX machine and paste the output? I can then rip out the `rand()` from the `cddlib.spkg`...
