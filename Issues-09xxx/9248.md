At [#9240 comment:2](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/9240#comment:2), we see someone get confused about the docstring for `factorial`, which claims it takes as input an integer or symbolic expression. However, it takes non-integer, non-SR inputs:

```
sage: x = 1.5; parent(x)
Real Field with 53 bits of precision
sage: factorial(x)
1.32934038817914
sage: x = 3/2; parent(x)
Rational Field
sage: factorial(x)      
3/4*sqrt(pi)
sage: x = CC(1+I); parent(x)
Complex Field with 53 bits of precision
sage: factorial(x)
0.652965496420167 + 0.343065839816545*I
```
I understand that there is coercion going on, but we should specify that the function takes pretty much any complex number (except of course negative integers) and evaluates (something akin to) gamma(1+x).

However, it doesn't exactly do gamma(1+x):

```
sage: x = I; parent(x)  
Symbolic Ring
sage: factorial(x)    
0.498015668118356 - 0.154949828301811*I
sage: gamma(x+1)      
gamma(I + 1)
sage: parent(factorial(x))  
Symbolic Ring
sage: gamma(x+1).n() 
0.498015668118356 - 0.154949828301811*I
sage: parent(gamma(x+1).n())
Complex Field with 53 bits of precision
```
The factorial function clearly is not simply calling gamma(x+1) when x is not an integer.

On the other hand, closing a ticket without review is much less bad than merging a branch without review. And essentially *nobody* reviews sage-duplicate/invalid/wontfix tickets.
