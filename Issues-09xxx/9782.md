Fans of toric varieties do not work correctly, for example see the following:

```
sage: f = Fan([(0, 2, 4), (0, 4, 5), (0, 3, 5), (0, 1, 3), (0, 1, 2), (2, 4, 6), (4, 5, 6), (3, 5, 6), (1, 3, 6), (1, 2, 6)], [(-1, 0, 0), (0, -1, 0), (0, 0, -1), (0, 0, 1), (0, 1, 2), (0, 1, 3), (1, 0, 4)])
sage: f.is_complete()
True
sage: X = ToricVariety(f)
sage: X.fan().is_complete()

I'm pretty sure it is a bug in Andrey's switch to enhanced cones for toric varieties (`trac_9470_toric_variety_fans.patch`). If I back out that patch it works fine. Unfortunately we didn't catch that in our doctests, we should add tests for complicated toric varieties and mark them as `# long time`
