This was the real cause of #8406, and the fix there introduced the following bug:

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Sage Version 4.5, Release Date: 2010-07-16                         |
| Type notebook() for the GUI, and license() for information.        |
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage: n = 20
sage: k = 3
sage: g = DiGraph()
sage: g.add_edges( (i,Mod(i+j,n)) for i in range(n) for j in range(1,k+1) )
sage: g.vertices()
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]
sage: g.strongly_connected_components()
[[0], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]]
