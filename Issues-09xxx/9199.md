here is the patch that fixes the fill=False issue.  It breaks fill=None (however, fill=None isn't really that natural).

Interesting issue...when running the doctests for this patch, the doctest timed out and then crashed.

when plotting this in sagenb, it works fine.

well...about sage -t.  Every doctest I run crashes (they all time out and then crash at about 360 seconds).  It even crashes with my sage-main branch (which is my clean sage 4.5.1).  It's strange because with my last patch, the doctests work fine.  I'll try undoing the changes and see it changes anything.

As far as handling fill both False and None, not anything big.
just need to change 

```
if fill is not False:

to

if fill is not False and fill is not None:
```

I originally had it the second way, but I removed in the hopes that it would fix the doctest crashes (it didn't).

I'll add it back as soon as I get back to my sage computer.

I rebased your patch (your patch had the default color to be rgbcolor=(0,0,0) for some reason), and combined your two patches into one patch.  However, when I do:

```
plot(x^2,(x,-1,1), fill=None)

```

I get filling (where I didn't before the patch).
