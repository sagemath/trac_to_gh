here is the patch that fixes the fill=False issue.  It breaks fill=None (however, fill=None isn't really that natural).

Interesting issue...when running the doctests for this patch, the doctest timed out and then crashed.

As far as handling fill both False and None, not anything big.
just need to change 

```
if fill is not False:

to

if fill is not False and fill is not None:
```

I originally had it the second way, but I removed in the hopes that it would fix the doctest crashes (it didn't).

I'll add it back as soon as I get back to my sage computer.
