Right, because `fill=None` is the current default.  This should be very easy to fix.

**Attachment:** [trac_9199_plot_fill.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9199/trac_9199_plot_fill.patch)

here is the patch that fixes the fill=False issue.  It breaks fill=None (however, fill=None isn't really that natural).

Interesting issue...when running the doctests for this patch, the doctest timed out and then crashed.

This could come from the change somehow.  

More important is whether anyone relies somewhere else in the code on fill=None as working.  There should be a way to handle both of these - catch fill=False and then rename fill to None, for instance.  What do you think?

As far as handling fill both False and None, not anything big.
just need to change 

```
if fill is not False:

to

if fill is not False and fill is not None:
```

I originally had it the second way, but I removed in the hopes that it would fix the doctest crashes (it didn't).

I'll add it back as soon as I get back to my sage computer.
