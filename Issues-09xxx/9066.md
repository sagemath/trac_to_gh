plot.plot3d.shapes2.py was a mess, including having several weird helper functions that didn't really need doctests, such as

```
    def avg(a,b):
        return (a+b)/2.0
```
This cleans up the situation here.

I'm OK with kcrisman's patch, except for a few points which I have added in my reviewer patch. Changes in the reviewer patch include:

* Use the new style of raising exceptions, e.g. use `TypeError` as if it's a function, not a statement. This new style is more consistent with Python 3.x. When it comes time to switch to using Python 3.x, there would be less work involved in making the transition to Python 3.x.
* Put exception tests into a `TESTS` block.
* Fix up docstring in `bezier3d` so it renders nicely in the reference manual.
* Some miscellaneous typo fixes.

If my patch gets a positive review, the whole ticket is good to go.

Okay, as long as this still works in Python 2.6 or whatever.

Ok.

I'm a minimalist about this sort of thing, as you know :)
> * Some miscellaneous typo fixes.

So did we say `3-D` and not `3D`?  I purposely put `3D` because I thought that was the default... I never know.

Oops, it's now too late for that. Applying these patches to 4.5.2.alpha0, I get the doctest errors mentioned above. We've already merged #9088, so we'll need to fix the problem here.
