If `F(t1, t2)` is a formal group law, then `F(t1, t2) = t1 + t2 (mod t1*t2)`.  So in particular, the coefficients of `t1^i` and `t2^i` are zero for all `i > 1`.  However the formal group law of an elliptic curve as returned by Sage includes (at least) the terms `-a1<sup>2*t1</sup>3` and `-a1<sup>2*t2</sup>2`, as the following example shows:

```
sage: P.<a1, a2, a3, a4, a6> = PolynomialRing(ZZ, 5)
sage: E = EllipticCurve(list(P.gens()))
sage: F = E.formal().group_law(prec = 4)
sage: t2 = F.parent().gen()
sage: t1 = F.parent().base_ring().gen()
sage: F(t1, 0)
t1 - a1^2*t1^3   # should be t1
sage: F(0, t2)
t2 - a1^2*t2^3
```
Note also that the coefficient of `t1^2*t2 + t1*t2^2` returned by sage is `-a1^2 - a2`, whereas, according to Silverman AEC IV.1, it should be simply `-a2`.

This was obtained in Sage 4.4.4 on MacOS X 10.5.8 (32 bit).

The bug appears to be related to the precision in a regular way:

```
sage: for prec in srange(4, 7):
....: E = EllipticCurve(list(P.gens()))
....: F = E.formal_group()
....: fg = F.group_law(prec)
....: print prec, fg(0, fg.parent().gen())
....: 
4 t2 - a1^2*t2^3
5 t2 + (-a1^3 - a1*a2)*t2^4
6 t2 + (-a1^4 - 2*a1^2*a2 - a1*a3)*t2^5
```
Note that the error is always of degree one less than the precision.  This might be related to the following issue, whereby the calculation dies when the precision is set to 2 or 3:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve(list(P.gens()))
sage: F = E.formal_group()
sage: fg = F.group_law(2)

As I played around with this, I found that I get different results than the [Errata](http://www.math.brown.edu/~jhs/AEC/AECErrata.pdf) of [Silverman](http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Z90CA_EUCCkC&lpg=PR1&ots=3K8lmtWd1a&dq=silverman%20arithmetic%20of%20elliptic%20curves&pg=PA120#v=onepage&q&f=false).

... and now to the other thing. As I played around with this, I found that I get different results than the [Errata](http://www.math.brown.edu/~jhs/AEC/AECErrata.pdf) of [Silverman](http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Z90CA_EUCCkC&lpg=PR1&ots=3K8lmtWd1a&dq=silverman%20arithmetic%20of%20elliptic%20curves&pg=PA120#v=onepage&q&f=false). So I had to dig a little deeper and I found that the formula in Silverman are not correct.

Here is an example. Let E be the elliptic curve `y^2 + y = x^3+1` Because `a1=a2=0`, the formula in the middle of page 120 of Silverman tells us that

`F(t,t) = [2](t) = 2*t + t^4 + ... `

But I claim that it should be `2*t -7*t^4`. Here is an example. 

```
sage: K = Qp(43,5)
sage: E = EllipticCurve(K,[0,0,1,0,1])
sage: Q = E(-779/43^2,-125945/43^3)
sage: tQ =-Q[0]/Q[1]
sage: tQ
24*43 + 4*43^2 + 32*43^3 + 41*43^4 + 34*43^5 + O(43^6)
```

so the point lies in the formal group. We use the multiplication law on the curve and find

```
sage: ttwoQ = -(2*Q)[0]/(2*Q)[1]
sage: ttwoQ
5*43 + 9*43^2 + 21*43^3 + 38*43^4 + 37*43^5 + O(43^6)
```

```
sage: sage: 2*tQ +tQ^4
5*43 + 9*43^2 + 21*43^3 + 28*43^4 + 37*43^5 + O(43^6)
sage: sage: 2*tQ -7*tQ^4
5*43 + 9*43^2 + 21*43^3 + 38*43^4 + 37*43^5 + O(43^6)
```

shows that -7 is correct. I have added a docstring in `mult_by_n` to illustrate that our formula is correct, because this function is computed without using `group_law` if the base ring is a field of char 0 (instead it uses the multiplication on the curve). 

In fact, the error appears as a sign error in the formula for `z_3`. The corrected formula should read

`F(z_1,z_2) = z_1+z_2 -a_1 z_1z_2 -a_2(z_1^2 z_2+z_1 z_2^2) - 2a_3 z_1^3 z_2 +(a_1 a_2-3 a_3) z_1^2 z_2^2 - 2a_3 z_1 z_2^3 + ...`
