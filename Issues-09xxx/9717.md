For some inputs our [This is the Trac macro *PolyBoRi* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#PolyBoRi-macro) wrapper throws an error while upstream computes the example just fine. The reason we fail is that some rings don't match and thus coercion goes wrong. The problem was reported by Joan Daemen who also provided an example via private communication.
