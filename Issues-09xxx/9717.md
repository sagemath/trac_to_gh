I've replaced the SPKG hereÂ

Martin, is that patch now obsolete or do we just not test an example which would fail without it? Or is it platform-specific?

(Btw, the patch's commit message lacks a ticket number; also, a back-reference/comment in the code wouldn't be bad.)

Perhaps you could add Joan Daemen's example to the ticket.

I'll add the ticket number.

The problem is a bit bigger and I have no permission to publish it, sorry.

I meant putting the ticket number also into a comment **in the code**; you don't see the commit messages when looking just at source files. E.g.

```
        ... # fixes #9717
```
or in the `TESTS::` section:

```
    Substitution is (now) also allowed with different rings (cf. #9717)::
```
Something like that.
