I've replaced the SPKG here 

   http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/malb/spkgs/polybori-0.6.4.p4.spkg

and the new SPKG fixes the SIGSEGV and all doctests pass.

These fixes are:

Martin, is that patch now obsolete or do we just not test an example which would fail without it? Or is it platform-specific?

(Btw, the patch's commit message lacks a ticket number; also, a back-reference/comment in the code wouldn't be bad.)

Perhaps you could add Joan Daemen's example to the ticket.

The patch is necessary, Sage will SIGSEGV in some cases otherwise. I'll try to update the patch with an example.

I'll add the ticket number.

The problem is a bit bigger and I have no permission to publish it, sorry.

I meant putting the ticket number also into a comment **in the code**; you don't see the commit messages when looking just at source files. E.g.

```
        ... # fixes #9717
```
or in the `TESTS::` section:

```
    Substitution is (now) also allowed with different rings (cf. #9717)::
```
Something like that.
