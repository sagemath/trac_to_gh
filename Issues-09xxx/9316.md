Many people have reported a "File not found" error that is reported at the end of "make test" when *in fact* a timeout occurred. 

This is caused by some weird code introduced in #7993 (see sage-test):

```
...
    s = os.path.join(SAGE_ROOT, 'local', 'bin', 'sage-%s' % cmd) + ' "%s"' % F
    err = os.system(s)
    # On unix systems, the return value of os.system has the process return
    # value in the second byte.
    err = err // 256

    # Check the process exit code that sage-doctest returns

    if err == 1: # process exit code 1: File not found
        failed.append(sage_test_command(F)+" # File not found")
```

```

sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/rings/number_field/number_field_rel.py"
*** *** Error: TIMED OUT! PROCESS KILLED! *** ***
*** *** Error: TIMED OUT! *** ***
Traceback (most recent call last):

    print "The doctested process was killed by signal %s" % (-e)
TypeError: bad operand type for unary -: 'NoneType'
         [8319.2 s]
```
The reason for the timeout was simply that I suspended my laptop for a couple of hours and then woke it up.  But at the end of the test (I was doing "make test" on 4.4.4.alpha1) the error message said

```

The following tests failed:


        sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/rings/number_field/number_field_rel.py" # File not found
```

I agree a timeout can cause this. I tried the patch which is supposed to fix the Mathematica interface, but that timed out after 10,000 seconds with a "File not found" message. 

However, BSD.py is completing well within the time I've set as SAGE_TIMEOUT and SAGE_TIMEOUT_LONG, so I doubt the BSD.py issue was a simple timeout 

```
drkirkby@redstart:~$ echo $SAGE_TIMEOUT_LONG
10000
drkirkby@redstart:~$ echo $SAGE_TIMEOUT     
1000
```

But BSD.py is taking 205 seconds

```
drkirkby@redstart:~/sage-4.4.4.alpha1$ ./sage -t  -long devel/sage/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/BSD.py
sage -t -long "devel/sage/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/BSD.py"
         [205.5 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 205.5 seconds
```

Sure BSD.py will take longer if the machine is more heavily loaded, but it would need a **huge** load to make the test take over 10000 seconds. The load would have to go up by a factor of 48! Given it's my own machine, and nobody else uses it, I have a pretty good idea the load would not have risen that much. 

My Blade 1000 does not have a lot of RAM (only 2 GB), so potentially it could swap if it run out of RAM, but I don't believe that was the problem. It certainly does not have any power saving features - that's why I keep it in the garage and use it as a heater in the Winter! That machine does not hybernate!

This appears to be caused by timeouts not being properly handled by `sage-doctest`. It prints the error message, but then doesn't actually do anything with it. It looks like I completely missed that case when doing #7993. This also explains the strange exception John is seeing. It's reaching code that shouldn't be reached in this case.

In the patch I'm attaching, I'm making `sage-doctest` return exit code 5 for a time out, and `sage-test` and `sage-ptest` will also interpret that that way.

(Note that this will conflict with #8641, but the conflict is easy to resolve.)

I get

sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/rings/number_field/number_field_rel.py"
*** *** Error: TIMED OUT! PROCESS KILLED! *** ***

The following tests failed:

Total time for all tests: 10.2 seconds
$ echo $?
64
```  

Maybe we should print a brief message about increasing `SAGE_TIMEOUT` and `SAGE_TIMEOUT_LONG`, if at least one test times out?

To release manager: Apply only [attachment:scripts9316_timeout_rebased.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9316/scripts9316_timeout_rebased.patch) to 4.5.alpha4 + #8641 + #9243.

That does seem very sensible, since these options are not well known. They are now documented in #8263, which adds them to the Installation Guide, but I would agree it would be useful to print this. 

Also see #9449 for yet more issues with doctesting, where the results are confusing. I don't know if tests have passed or failed in some cases.
