I wrote the function _factor_over_nonprime_finite_field in multi_polynomial.pyx in hopes that Singular's multivariate poly factorization worked over GF(p).  But it doesn't, so that function is pointless.  Moreover, as John Cremona pointed out in email on the sagedays23 list recently, the algorithm there is wrong!:

```
If f is irreducible over R but not over S then your
gcd will be f again which does not help you factor over S.

Basically what one needs is that the conjugates of f (whose product is
the norm) are coprime.

?
```

Here's an example to illustrate that it is wrong:

```
flat:polynomial wstein$ sage

sage: g = f.change_ring(GF(9,'a'))

sage: R.<x,y> = GF(3)[]
sage: f = x^2+1
sage: g = f.change_ring(GF(9,'a'))
sage: g
x^2 + 1
sage: g.factor()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

   3589             if not self._parent._base.is_prime_field():
   3590                 return self._factor_over_nonprime_finite_field()

The point is that g should factor as a product of two linear factors. 

So, let's just delete this function, and anything that calls it, and use Singular's builtin factorization code in the non-prime case.

Look into whether the comment malb posted on #5074 is really just an indication of a bug in this code, and not in Singular.
