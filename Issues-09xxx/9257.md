```
The file misc/darcs.py was meant to serve as an interface to the Darcs
source code version control system, back in the old days before Sage
switched to using Mercurial. With the upcoming Sage 5.0 milestone, I
think that module can be removed from the Sage library. I believe its
removal would result in very minimal (next to zero?) hassle regarding
issues of backward compatibility. If I understand the Mercurial log of
the Sage library correctly, Sage hasn't been using Darcs for over 2
years now, or even since February 2006.

As a historical note, the original thread referenced here was off by about a year and a half on when Sage 5.0 would be released... ah, expectations.
