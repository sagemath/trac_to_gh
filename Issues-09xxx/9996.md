## Hardware and software
* IBM [RS/6000 7025 F50](http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/pseries/v5r3/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.pseries.doc/hardware_docs/rs6000_7025f50series.htm)

* 3 GB RAM
* A fairly wide mixture of disks sizes (3 x 9 GB, 1 x 18 GB, 2 x 36 GB and 1 x 73 GB)
* DDS-4 tape drive 
* AIX 5.3 (A POSIX certified operating system)
* gcc 4.2.4 downloaded from [pware](http://pware.hvcc.edu/)
* sage-4.6.alpha1 

## The problem
Flint builds ok (see attached log), but the shared library has the wrong extension.

```
-bash-4.1$ ls local/lib/*flint*
local/lib/libflint.so
-bash-4.1$ file local/lib/libflint.so
local/lib/libflint.so: executable (RISC System/6000) or object module not stripped
```

This is not normal on AIX, where the extension for both shared and archive libraries should be `.a` and not `.so`. See 
[IBM compiler manual](http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/comphelp/v7v91/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.vacpp7a.doc/getstart/overview/port_aix_obj_lib.htm) and [notes on GCC on AIX](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/aix/library/au-gnu.html)

Can you give me the uname -m or uname -a or whatever will tell me this is an AIX machine. It's only a single line in the flint makefile to fix this.

I assume it is flint 1.6.
