I get this doctest error with a trial 4.6.alpha1 on sage.math and many other Sage cluster and Skynet machines:

```python
sage -t -long  devel/sage/sage/geometry/polyhedra.py
**********************************************************************
File "/mnt/usb1/scratch/mpatel/tmp/sage-4.6.alpha1/devel/sage-main/sage/geometry/polyhedra.py", line 1270:

Expected nothing
Got:
    doctest:4555: DeprecationWarning: (Since Sage 4.6) use the option 'width' instead of 'thickness'
    <BLANKLINE>
