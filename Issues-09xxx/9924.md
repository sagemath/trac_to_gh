I get this doctest error with a trial 4.6.alpha1 on sage.math and many other Sage cluster and Skynet machines:

```python

I'm not seeing this in 4.6.alpha0.  It looks like some graphics ticket you merged between alpha0 and alpha1 introduced a new deprecation warning.  Any idea which ticket it might be?

If we can find that out, it shouldn't be difficult to change either the code or the doctest to use the new non-deprecated way of doing things.
