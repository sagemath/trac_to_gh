I get this doctest error with a trial 4.6.alpha1 on sage.math and many other Sage cluster and Skynet machines:

```python
sage -t -long  devel/sage/sage/geometry/polyhedra.py
**********************************************************************
File "/mnt/usb1/scratch/mpatel/tmp/sage-4.6.alpha1/devel/sage-main/sage/geometry/polyhedra.py", line 1270:
    sage: p1.projection().show() + p2.projection().show() + p3.projection().show()
Expected nothing
Got:
    doctest:4555: DeprecationWarning: (Since Sage 4.6) use the option 'width' instead of 'thickness'

If it's feasible to create a patch now, I can merge it into 4.6.alpha1, while I wait for a response to a build error at #4000.

I'm not seeing this in 4.6.alpha0.  It looks like some graphics ticket you merged between alpha0 and alpha1 introduced a new deprecation warning.  Any idea which ticket it might be?

If we can find that out, it shouldn't be difficult to change either the code or the doctest to use the new non-deprecated way of doing things.

Ticket #7154 changed the options for point/arrow thickness and was merged in 4.6.alpha1. I didn't realize that this impacts the polyhedra package, but of course it does. Anyways, the obvious patch is to change the option name in polyhedra.py.
