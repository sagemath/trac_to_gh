Two issues and/or suggestions for "sage -merge":

- if a ticket (like #9278) *removes* a file from the Sage library, then 'sage -merge' runs 'sage -tp 2 -long' with no argument, and this doesn't succeed.  So we should catch this case and deal with it.

- 'sage -merge' should detect whether each patch file has a properly formatted commit message, and either automatically prepend "#NUM" to it, or allow the release manager to edit it, before applying it.

[attachment: check_patch_metadata.py](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9319/check_patch_metadata.py.gz) is a script that, given a patch file and a ticket number, will check to see that the commit message contains the ticket number in the first line, and if it doesn't, it will prepend "ticket xxxx:" to the commit message and save the resulting patch in a a file with ".fixed" appended. It should be easy to integrate this into sage-apply-ticket.

It bails if it cannot find a commit message or username in the patch. It issues a warning if it can't find a date, node ID or parent but continues. As a guess, I think "sage -merge" should fail if there's no commit message or username, and in the other cases, issue the warning and ask the user if they want to continue.
