The option -m64 is only being added if SAGE64 is set to yes **and** the platform is OS X, so it does not work on OpenSolaris. I've seen this problem many times, and the fix is pretty simple.

The revised spkg at http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/patches/mercurial-1.3.1.p2/mercurial-1.3.1.p2.spkg

resolves this issue, by removing the restriction that the operating system needs to be OS X in order that a 64-bit compilation can be performed.

The patch looks ok (though I don't like *overwriting* CFLAGS, but this has been in before).

Should perhaps be tested/reviewed by some MacOS and/or Solaris users.
