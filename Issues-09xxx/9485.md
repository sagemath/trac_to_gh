```
Graphs produced with strongly_connected_components_digraph had no
edges in them due to a typo in the code:

```
    sage: g = DiGraph({0:[1,2,3],1:[2],2:[1,3]})
    sage: scc_digraph = g.strongly_connected_components_digraph()
    sage: scc_digraph.vertices()
    [{0}, {3}, {1, 2}]
    sage: scc_digraph.edges()
    []
```

After this patch, the result is more likely to be correct:

```
    [({0}, {3}, None), ({0}, {1, 2}, None), ({1, 2}, {3}, None)]
```
