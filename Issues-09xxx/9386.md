The following shows that `sage-native-execute` creates a very hostile environment for running python:

```
$ sage -sh

Starting subshell with Sage environment variables set.
Be sure to exit when you are done and do not do anything
with other copies of Sage!

Bypassing shell configuration files ...

```
The problem is `python` refers to the sage python, because $PATH still has sage paths in it. This doesn't run because LD_LIBRARY_PATH does not point at sage library anymore

The system python `/usr/bin/python` doesn't run successfully either because PYTHONPATH and PYTHONHOME still point at sage locations.

This problem arose while trying to use the magma interface. My magma startup script uses python to resolve some paths, which didn't work anymore.

There are other traces left by sage-native-execute:

```
ECLDIR=/usr/local/sage/4.4.4/local/lib/ecl/
GP_DATA_DIR=/usr/local/sage/4.4.4/local/share/pari
GPDOCDIR=/usr/local/sage/4.4.4/local/share/pari/doc
GPHELP=/usr/local/sage/4.4.4/local/bin/gphelp
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=
LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/sage/4.4.4/local/lib/
PATH=/usr/local/sage/4.4.4:/usr/local/sage/4.4.4/local/bin:   #.....
PYTHONHOME=/usr/local/sage/4.4.4/local
PYTHONPATH=:/usr/local/sage/4.4.4/local/lib/python
SINGULAR_EXECUTABLE=/usr/local/sage/4.4.4/local/bin/Singular
SINGULARPATH=/usr/local/sage/4.4.4/local/share/singular
```

so I imagine local ecl, gp python, singular will all have problems.
I include LD_LIBRARY_PATH because that variable was originally undefined, not just empty. The variables PYTHONHOME and PYTHONPATH really need to be unset, not just emptied.

<a id='comment:8'></a>This goes a long way towards reconstructing the starting environment. The main thing I am worried about is that a lot of variables are "restored" by unsetting them, regardless of whether they had a previous value.That could break things.

That makes me wonder whether we should do something like the following at the start of sage:

```
SAGE_OLD_ENV=`env | base64`
```
and restore it by something like

```
{echo $SAGE_OLD_ENV | base64 > /tmp/temp_sage_env} ; . /tmp/temp_sage_env
```
This doesn't actually work, but I hope you get the idea. If we go this route we should probably make a python script "store_environment", and make `sage-native-execute` a python script that restores the environment. I'm not sure if there are some unexpected security concerns involved.

In fact, we should probably do this all on C-level with tiny programs, where we can use first the `extern char **environ` pointer to get the whole (pristine) environment, and later reconstruct it and use `execle` or similar to start the new process in the appropriately restored environment. The difficult part is finding an appropriate place to store the presage environment ...

I'd be fine with a more piecemeal solution as proposed here, because at least it will significantly improve the situation.

**edit:** better to store the relevant variable names in a separate variable `SAGE_SAVED_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES`. Then you don't have to scan all of the environment, meaning that you only have to make your script robust against strings that the script is meant to see (environments can in principle contain arbitrary null-terminated strings) **/edit**

The restoring bit could be easy:
- scan the entire environment for variable names of the form `SAGE_OLD_<name>`. **edit:** rather, retrieve `<names>`s from `SAGE_SAVED_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES`. **/edit** For each of those:
- If the value of `SAGE_OLD_<name>` is of the form `+<value>` then set `<name>=<value>`
- If the value is empty, unset `<name>`
- If value is non-empty but does not start with +: error.
That's a simple loop you can execute in `sage-native-execute`.

The difficult part is ensuring all exports adhere to the standard imposed here. You could make a bash function that does this, but not all environment setting needs to happen by bash, and we might not have easy control over all environment setting instructions (chances are we do for all variables that matter, though. If we adjust sage-env, we're probably already good). An obvious advantage is that any non-cooperating environment clobbering will simply not be restored, which is not necessarily an error condition.

Agreed. Storing an environment in a temporary variable somewhere sounds awkward.

<a id='comment:11'></a>On the Python side, i did the following short enumeration:

```
$ grep -R 'environ.*='
interfaces/qsieve.py~:    os.environ['TMPDIR'] = X
interfaces/qsieve.py:    os.environ['TMPDIR'] = X
interfaces/gp.py:os.environ["GPRC"] = os.path.join(SAGE_ETC, 'gprc.expect')

repl/notebook_ipython.py:            sage: os.environ['IPYTHONDIR'] = IPYTHONDIR

repl/interpreter.py:            sage: os.environ['IPYTHONDIR'] = IPYTHONDIR
env.py:        sage: os.environ['SAGE_FOO'] = 'foo'
Fichier binaire env.pyc concordant
doctest/forker.py:            sage: os.environ['SAGE_PEXPECT_LOG'] = "1"
doctest/forker.py:            sage: os.environ['SAGE_PEXPECT_LOG'] = "1"
geometry/polytope.py:    os.environ['PATH'] = '%s:'%path + os.environ['PATH']
dev/patch.py:                    os.environ['TZ'] = 'UTC'
dev/patch.py:                        os.environ['TZ'] = old_TZ
misc/cython.py:        sage: environ_parse('$SAGE_LOCAL') == SAGE_LOCAL
misc/cython.py:        sage: os.environ['DEFINE_THIS'] = 'hello'
```

So, this should not require much work to update, but perhaps there are other ways to modify an environment variable in Python ?

Would you care to elaborate? If I do

```
$ . sage_restore.sh
$ sage_export PATH
$ PATH=bad_stuff:$PATH
$ sage_restore
```
I end up with my original path back, not with an unset path.

I fully expect that the script needs further tuning and probably lots of quotes in all kinds of places to catch all kinds of little quirks (it's scary to think that shell scripts are the weapon of choice for complicated configuration tasks), but I think the general mechanism is fine. Do you have better suggestions? I'm not married to my implementation. If you come up with something better I'm sure we'll be happy to adopt that.

However, if you're going to suggest to unset PATH then I don't think we'll be so eager, because indeed, I think if you do that, you'll break a lot.

I agree with that approach. That was the main idea of allowing `sage_export` with a single argument (and I think I did run into some more complicated manipulations where I just decided to `sage_export` the variable beforehand and let the script do whatever it did before).

**edit:** Now I see where`#!sh` comes from: The `#!` is just a polite rendering of the adjective that is supposed to go in front of `sh`. 
For `sage_export a `echo 1 2 3`` we could do

```
    if (( $# > 1 )); then
        shift
        export $varname="$*"
```
but then, of course, `sage_export a 1 2 3` would do the same thing, presumably with the arguments `1 2 3` rather arbitrarily joined together with spaces (almost guaranteed to trip up environment variable use elsewhere). Perhaps an error if more than 2 arguments are given?

"and its value and, if this hasn't been done before, its value"

s/sage-native execute/sage-native-execute/

`test` takes `=`, not `==`.

There are some other issues I can't all list right now... ;-)

But for example,

```sh
    #we need to test early that the first parameter is a valid identifier
    export "$varname" || return 1

```
should probably give a more explicit error message instead of just relying on bash's.




Otherwise, nice work.  Why not define `sage_restore()` in `sage-env`?

It could also be extended to restore individual variables (e.g. `sage_restore FOO` or `sage_restore FOO BAR BAZ`).

Well, at the moment I think.  (I was also wondering whether people will find it at all if it's [just] defined in `sage-native-execute`.  Ok, a comment in `sage-env` refers to the latter.)




> which in principle could be executed quite frequently. Why source `sage-env` there for a routine that we only use in `sage-native-execute`? If this ever develops into a more generally used facility then, sure.


Every `sage-*` script in `local/bin/` (likewise, `src/bin/`) has (and must have) the Sage environment set up, i.e., is (directly or indirectly) called from a script that already sourced `sage-env`, so you of course don't have to `source sage-env` in `sage-native-execute` again.  (After all, if that wasn't the case, the function couldn't restore any environment variables because `sage-env` saves them.) 

The only thing we'd have to add is `export -f sage_restore`.




There's probably one problem already:  It at least used to be the case that `sage-env` must not use bashisms since it isn't (or wasn't) necessarily sourced by bash.  (IIRC in the top-level Makefile, which apparently is no longer the case, but also when starting a Sage subshell, maybe in more cases.)

If that's still a problem, we could "bypass" some things in case the shell isn't bash.
 



When or where is `sage-native-execute` executed frequently?

Just an idea, doesn't have to be implemented here.

Not sure yet whether to make it "all bash" (e.g. `[This is the Trac macro *... * that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#... -macro)` instead of `[ ... ]`, the former being safer and faster) or POSIX shell only.

The easiest fix for that is to ensure that `SAGE_SAVED_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES` both begins and ends with a `:` and use `[This is the Trac macro *$SAGE_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES = ${SAGE_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES/:$varname:} * that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#$SAGE_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES = ${SAGE_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES/:$varname:} -macro)`.


Good idea, probably using a different separator as well (to avoid confusion with typical `:`-lists).

Not at first glance.

I tried staying with POSIX but it's a pain for this case, in particular because we need dereferencing of variables, which is easy in bash and painful in POSIX. I recall that the substring matching was also easier with bash.

The fact is that `sage` is already a bash script, so we lose no generality by using bash features here, so we might as well.

For separation: I figured `:` was pretty safe, since that's an insane character to put in a variable name. Another good separator is probably "=" or "$", since you *really* need to go out of your way to put those in a variable name.

I was pretty happy with the state of the script, so I'm happy to not make changes to it.

That's horrible! That stores the entire function in the environment. Every process spawned after sage-env was sourced would have that in its memory.

> When or where is `sage-native-execute` executed frequently?


OK, it's unlikely that a program that has such specific environment needs that it needs `sage-native-execute` would start up so quickly that some bash sourcing would be problematic.

However, I think there is something logically wrong with sourcing `sage-env`, which has all manner of side effects, in a script that is *designed* to only run when `sage-env` has already run and whose sole purpose is undoing a lot of these side-effects.

The "proper" solution would probably be to have sage_export and sage_restore in yet another file and source that in sage-env. But probably adds considerable overhead (to any sourcing of sage-env).
