Is that fairly easy to do with something analogous to the solution in #12559?   It looks like it might "just work" if this ticket depends on that one (I have not tried this yet, though).

Yikes!  Luckily, I didn't need any of them, just

```
\newcommand{\Bold}[1]{\mathbf{#1}}
\newcommand{\ZZ}{\Bold{Z}}
\newcommand{\QQ}{\Bold{Q}}
\newcommand{\GF}[1]{\Bold{F}_{#1}}
```
As it turns out, the problem is that `xelatex` doesn't recognize `\DeclareUnicodeCharacter`, and so one never gets to this stuff in the first place.  Of course, I didn't check whether some fairly important math characters for Sage such as

```
\DeclareUnicodeCharacter{0428}{cyrillic Sha}
```
appeared correctly, but from a little browsing I think most of those declarations are just to make things look "nice", e.g.

```
\DeclareUnicodeCharacter{221A}{\sqrt}
```
