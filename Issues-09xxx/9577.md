I'm going to move this to the `zh_CN` directory created by #12559, assuming that this is also mainland Mandarin.  I have a colleague who has agreed to proofread some stuff and she can comment on that too, of course.

For pdf we'll at least need a config file change, not sure if the solution at #12559 will fix it once that's done.

<a id='comment:24'></a>The change in fonts in [comment:51:ticket:12559 this comment] seems to work as well, so whatever solution we get there should work here.  Obviously we could just have two different conf things by messing with that file, but that is not particularly elegant.   There are still a few bugs with the LaTeX macros but on the way to happiness.

Also, the author confirms this is simplified Chinese in private communication.

Yikes!  Luckily, I didn't need any of them, just

```
\newcommand{\Bold}[1]{\mathbf{#1}}
\newcommand{\ZZ}{\Bold{Z}}
\newcommand{\QQ}{\Bold{Q}}
\newcommand{\GF}[1]{\Bold{F}_{#1}}
```
As it turns out, the problem is that `xelatex` doesn't recognize `\DeclareUnicodeCharacter`, and so one never gets to this stuff in the first place.  Of course, I didn't check whether some fairly important math characters for Sage such as

```
\DeclareUnicodeCharacter{0428}{cyrillic Sha}
```
appeared correctly, but from a little browsing I think most of those declarations are just to make things look "nice", e.g.

```
\DeclareUnicodeCharacter{221A}{\sqrt}
```
