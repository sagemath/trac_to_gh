It is true that if one sorts the intervals before iterating over pairs, some speed up can be realized (especially for a sparse interval graph); but this efficiency comes at a cost of some generality. Also, for a random interval graph, the speedup will not be so dramatic as these random graphs are dense.

Ed has request that this ticket be closed. He sent an email that said:

```
Dear Sage Manager:

A few weeks ago I posted Trac ticket #9727 entitled "RepresentationGraph method
that generalizes IntervalGraph". Since that time, working with Nathann Cohen, I
posted an alternative, more focused solution to minor glitches in the
IntervalGraph method. Further, the RepresentationGraph method functionality is
partially already present in the Graph() constructor and I am considering a
direct enhancement of Graph() at some future time to add a bit more
functionality.

So, to make a long story short, I would like to cancel my posting of 9727, but I
don't see how to do that in Trac. Can you please do this for me?

Thanks,

Ed Scheinerman
```

I'm setting this as "wontfix" since it seems like they, well, won't use this enhancement and work on things later.
