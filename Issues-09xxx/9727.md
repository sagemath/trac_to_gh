Interesting, but the Graph constructor works differently and does not provide all the functionality that GraphRepresentation does. For example, it will not solve the problem of repeated intervals being recognized as separate vertices (but with the same closed neighborhoods). It will also not accept a dictionary instead of a list as we have set up in RepresentationGraph. 

One solution might be to rework the Graph() constructor to accept a [dictionary,function] pair. In that case, the vertices would be the keys of the dictionary. Two vertices would be adjacent if the function, applied to the values associated with two keys, returns True. How difficult would that be? If easy, then that may be a preferable route. If difficult, then I prefer this route.

It is true that if one sorts the intervals before iterating over pairs, some speed up can be realized (especially for a sparse interval graph); but this efficiency comes at a cost of some generality. Also, for a random interval graph, the speedup will not be so dramatic as these random graphs are dense.

```
Dear Sage Manager:

A few weeks ago I posted Trac ticket #9727 entitled "RepresentationGraph method
that generalizes IntervalGraph". Since that time, working with Nathann Cohen, I
posted an alternative, more focused solution to minor glitches in the
IntervalGraph method. Further, the RepresentationGraph method functionality is
partially already present in the Graph() constructor and I am considering a
direct enhancement of Graph() at some future time to add a bit more
functionality.

So, to make a long story short, I would like to cancel my posting of 9727, but I
don't see how to do that in Trac. Can you please do this for me?

Thanks,

Ed Scheinerman
```

I'm setting this as "wontfix" since it seems like they, well, won't use this enhancement and work on things later.
