The old IntervalGraph method did not permit the same interval to be used twice for different vertices (and gave an erroneous result in some cases). The new IntervalGraph method in this patch fixes those issues.

Ed has request that this ticket be closed. He sent an email that said:

```
Dear Sage Manager:

A few weeks ago I posted Trac ticket #9727 entitled "RepresentationGraph method
that generalizes IntervalGraph". Since that time, working with Nathann Cohen, I
posted an alternative, more focused solution to minor glitches in the
IntervalGraph method. Further, the RepresentationGraph method functionality is
partially already present in the Graph() constructor and I am considering a
direct enhancement of Graph() at some future time to add a bit more
functionality.

So, to make a long story short, I would like to cancel my posting of 9727, but I
don't see how to do that in Trac. Can you please do this for me?

Thanks,

Ed Scheinerman
```

I'm setting this as "wontfix" since it seems like they, well, won't use this enhancement and work on things later.
