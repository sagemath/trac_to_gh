Here is an excerpt from "deps" , the makefile in spkg/standard

$(INST)/$(FORTRAN):
       $(SAGE_SPKG) $(FORTRAN) 2>&1

$(INST)/$(F2C): $(INST)/$(FORTRAN)
       $(SAGE_SPKG) $(INST)/$(F2C) 2>&1
                    ^^^^^^^ --------------------Notice that this is
wrong.
                                              the INST is not needed
and is wrong.
$(INST)/$(PIL): $(INST)/$(PYTHON)
       $(SAGE_SPKG) $(PIL) 2>&1


The only reason it works is that the script that reads it cleans it up
with
"basename".

But that's imperfect.


There are 3 instances, shown in this diff:


401c400
<       $(SAGE_SPKG) $(F2C) 2>&1
---
>       $(SAGE_SPKG) $(INST)/$(F2C) 2>&1
413c412
<       $(SAGE_SPKG) $(LAPACK) 2>&1
---
>       $(SAGE_SPKG) $(INST)/$(LAPACK) 2>&1
416c415
<       $(SAGE_SPKG) $(BLAS) 2>&1
---
>       $(SAGE_SPKG) $(INST)/$(BLAS) 2>&1




Also in deps there are references to   TWISTEDWEB2  but that doesn't
seem to exist anymore.


I do not write access to the code. I hope someone who does will take
this
and do right thing with it.

The attached `deps` incorporates suggestions from [Carl Hansen](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/d15b668609983181/268094db15092f85?#268094db15092f85), [David Kirkby](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/7763c990fdc1d5ac#), and [comment:ticket:8306:73 John Palmieri].

Main changes:

* Remove unnecessary `$(INST)/`'s.
* Make all non-`$(BASE)` packages depend explicitly on `$(BASE)`.
* Make the target `all` depend explicitly on all standard packages.

With `SAGE_PARALLEL_SPKG_BUILD="yes"`: The long tests pass on bsd.math.  They also pass on sage.math, if after building Sage, I reinstall Maxima via `sage -f`.  I don't know why, but I'll keep testing.

I really want sage-4.5 to be a better release, so I'm adding this to the blockers. Just like the issue that #9431 is exposing, this is too egregous to delay.

The GLPK alpha release is nearly ready, and will include #9412 specifically so that this can be rebased on top and merged into the alpha release following that one.

What work is left for this to be ready, other than waiting for #9412?

See the comment about Maxima needing to be reinstalled above. 

I don't know if that is supposed to be related to what changes are on this ticket or not. At first, I interpreted the reasons this ticket was needing work was because of this Maxima problem. Perhaps it was put to 'needs work' for some other reason.

As you're probably aware, this made it into sage-4.5.alpha3:

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/rlmill/release/sage-4.5.alpha3.tar

Can the deps file here and the patch be rebased on top of alpha3? I promise this will be the last time.

An interesting point. It can hurt for two reasons

* It will slow parallel builds unnecessarily, as GLPK has to wait until Cython has built. That's not a major issue, as GLPK takes very little time to build. 
* The real reason people got a failure might be something else. 

That's worth investigating.

I apologize for my late reply.

* Off-topic, I admit:  Robert, what do you think about making new releases available in `/home/release` on `sage.math`?
* I've been running test builds under `/scratch` on sage.math.
* For what it's worth, I later sometimes experienced the same Maxima reinstallation problem when building an *unmodified* 4.5.alpha1 on sage.math --- with 4, 6, or 12 parallel jobs.
* For the record, here are two errors representative of those fixed by reinstalling Maxima:
