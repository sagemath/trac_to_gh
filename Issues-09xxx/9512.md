[comment:ticket:9572:6 C. Witty's comment] at #9572:
> Actually, I found a bug: the "source editor" feature (#9512) converts line endings from Unix to DOS (so once you've edited the file, mercurial thinks every line has changed).

> Given the total non-discoverability of #9512, I'm not sure this bug is worth holding up the new spkg; I'll let somebody else decide that.

I also see this behavior.  I'm reopening this ticket, changing its status to "needs work," and removing it, for now, from #9572's SageNB 0.8.2.
