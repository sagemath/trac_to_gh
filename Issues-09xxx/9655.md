This is the first patch I produced using mecurial queues. At some point I recieved a warning about User not being defined, but how do I set it up? I mean other than directly editing the .patch

You should use the Mercurial configuration file `~/.hgrc`. Here's a template for your `~/.hgrc` file:

```sh
[ui]
editor = /usr/bin/vim
username = Carl Friedrich Gauss <cfgauss@uni-goettingen.de>

[extensions]
# Enable the Mercurial queues extension.
hgext.mq =
# Enable the record, qrecord and crecord extensions for cherry picking.
hgext.record =

[diff]
# Format diff output using Git style.
git = True
# Prevent qrefresh from updating timestamps. If you're keeping your patch
# queue under revision control, it can be quite annoying when every qrefresh
# updates the timestamps in your patch. The following prevents this from
# happening.
nodates = 1
```

Change your username accordingly.
