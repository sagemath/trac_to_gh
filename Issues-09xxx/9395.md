The attached patch includes a new doctest for a book (in french) some
people are writing about Sage (see the README file for the list of
authors).

This book will be available under a CC-by-sa license.

This patch contains only the doctests for one chapter (about number
theory). Some more doctests will follow, one per chapter, but we
already submit that one to see if some things need to be fixed.

This doctest was tested successfully with Sage 4.4.2 under Fedora 12.

Sorry for the delay.
All tests passed with Sage 4.5.2.

Regarding the `timeit` issue, you could change 

```
    sage: %timeit (a^e) # not tested
```
for

```
    sage: timeit('a^e') # random
```

(and also `# long` for some of them).

I put it to `need info` for now, but feel free either to change this and ask me for a review (I'll be faster this time) or don't change anything and give a positive review.

 Yann

thank you Yann for your comments. I attach a new patch taking them into account. I left the
last `time r=...` as `not tested` since I do not know how to make it work, without
changing `time` into `timeit`, which would be not coherent with the book.

Everything is still ok for me. I added 'long time' to the longest tests, this reduces the time for normal testing to 12 seconds on my computer compared to 67 for the long version.

Paul, if you agree with my reviewer's patch, you can give this ticket a positive review.

I apologize for not being clearer.  The first line of the commit string for each patch to be merged should start with the ticket number and contain a short description of what the patch does.  This line should be < 80 characters in length.

For example: `#9395: Number theory doctests for French book about Sage` and `#9395: Reviewer patch: tag longest tests as long`.

The reason for these policies is so that `hg log` and `hg log filename.py` tell us what a changeset did and which Sage trac ticket we can consult for background.

Of course, extra lines are welcome and may help to explain details to a reviewer or someone who uses `hg log -p`.

Could you update the just first line of the combined patch?
