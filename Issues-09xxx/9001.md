Dammit, I thought we had got rid of all of these,  If the ticket had been tagged as being in Elliptic Curves, I would have noticed this and fixed it 2 weeks ago, sorry.

Patch applies fine to 4.4.3.alpha3.  With no optional packages installed I tested the whole sage library (only 10 minutes with -tp 10!), and did it again after installing database_cremona_ellcurve-20071019.  Just to make sure there were not other examples of this lurking!  All pass.
