Hi Robert,

Oops, how did that one get through without breaking the tests?

I am all for the change. Please add a test exhibiting the (now fixed)
problem to avoid later regression; then, if all test pass, you may set
a positive review on my behalf.

Replying to [@nthiery](#comment%3A2):
> Oops, how did that one get through without breaking the tests?

I think almost everywhere it gets exercised, it is marked "# random."  I did have it messing up on my doctests on the latex() routines, which is how I caught it.

I knew that was too easy - totally forgot to add a test against the bug.  ;-)  Will do in the next day or two.  Thanks for the review and the reminder.

Version 2 self-contained patch contains a test with a file that should be in every latex distribution, plus a `more_info` string.  So prior to this fix, the info string (and only the info string) would have printed if someone ran the optional tests and had latex installed.

As requested by the reviewer, I've marked this "positive review."

Release manager: just apply the v2 patch only.
