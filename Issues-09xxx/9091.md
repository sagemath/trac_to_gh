<a id='comment:2'></a>Hi Robert,

Oops, how did that one get through without breaking the tests?

I am all for the change. Please add a test exhibiting the (now fixed)
problem to avoid later regression; then, if all test pass, you may set
a positive review on my behalf.

I think almost everywhere it gets exercised, it is marked "# random."  I did have it messing up on my doctests on the latex() routines, which is how I caught it.

I knew that was too easy - totally forgot to add a test against the bug.  ;-)  Will do in the next day or two.  Thanks for the review and the reminder.
