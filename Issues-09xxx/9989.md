```
Attached patch adds an `op` attribute to symbolic expressions which gives easy access to its operands. We now have:

```
sage: x,y,z = var('x,y,z')
sage: e = x + x*y + z^y + 3*y*z; e
x*y + 3*y*z + z^y + x
sage: e.op[1]
3*y*z
sage: e.op[1,1]
z
sage: e.op[-1]
x
sage: e.op[1:]
[3*y*z, z^y, x]
```

Using `__getitem__()` directly was not an option since it breaks conversion to numpy.

What is the `property` thing in Python/Cython?  I haven't heard of that before (as opposed to `def` or `cdef` or `class`).

Does this depend at all on any of the Pynac 0.2.1 tickets' patches?

I also found out about it while looking through the Sage library code for a way to make `numpy` work when I define `__getitem__()`:

http://docs.cython.org/src/userguide/extension_types.html#properties

The function defined by `__get__()` is run when you access that property. This makes the syntax look much cleaner. You don't need to put `()` at the end any more, compared to the syntax needed for `.operands()`.

No, it should be independent. Though I admit that there are a bunch of symbolics patches before this on my queue.

Done. The new message is: "expressions containing only a numeric coefficient, constant or symbol have no operands"

> Any reason why expr.op isn't just a plain list?


I wanted to avoid traversing the vector storing the operands and creating a python object for each. A list wouldn't allow nested indexing either:

```
sage: x,y,z = var('x,y,z')
sage: e = x + x*y + z^y + 3*y*z; e
x*y + 3*y*z + z^y + x
sage: e.op[1]
3*y*z
sage: e.op[1,1]
z
```

This syntax was proposed in a discussion at Sage days 24 last summer.

<a id='comment:11'></a>So far looks good - thanks to [a little help](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2936863/python-implementing-slicing-in-getitem) and [the Ginac refs](http://www.ginac.de/tutorial/Information-about-expressions.html).  

Questions, though.
* Regarding the error message:

```
sage: f = 3*x^2+2*sin(x)-32*sin(ln(x))
sage: f.op[3]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
IndexError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
IndexError: operand index out of range, got 3, expect between -3 and 3
```
   Is this really the error message we want?  Here it's the 'exclusive' between, but that could be confusing.  Maybe it should say between -3 and 2 (length ops -1)?  

* Next, I wonder whether the following can be supported:

```
sage: f.op[2:3,3]
TypeError: an integer is required
```
   since matrices can do this

```
sage: M = matrix(4,range(16))
sage: M[2:3]
[ 8  9 10 11]
sage: M[2:3,3]
[11]
```
   The current code ends everything if it's a slice; you just get the operands at that level.  But it would be interesting to get the 2nd element of each operand, though perhaps not very useful since you might not know what it is ahead of time.  But perhaps for very regular expressions (Christoffel symbol-type surfeit of indices?) it could be useful.  We might also want something like `sage: M[2:3,3:4]` to be supported, such as `sage: f.op[2,0:1]` instead of having to do 

```
sage: f.op[2].op[0:1]
[sin(log(x))]
```
   But maybe going back and forth between Ginac and Sage in the way you'd have to for that is tricky.
* Here is something needed for sure:

```
sage: f = 3*x^2+2*sin(x)-32*sin(ln(x))
sage: f[1]

   We should have at least one doctest *somewhere* that tests this.

But overall the code is correct for the promised functionality and passes its tests, documented pretty well *if* you know enough about !GEx etc.  So I would say good work, needs work for the last item above and probably the first, and needs info for the second item (matrix-style slices).

The output is a list if the index is a slice. We could pass further indices to the list's `__getitem__()` of course, though I'm not convinced this convenience is really a good feature.

I added a test in the docstring for `__get__` in `expression.pyx`.
