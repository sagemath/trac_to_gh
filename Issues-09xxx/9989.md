```
Attached patch adds an `op` attribute to symbolic expressions which gives easy access to its operands. We now have:

```
sage: x,y,z = var('x,y,z')
sage: e = x + x*y + z^y + 3*y*z; e
x*y + 3*y*z + z^y + x
sage: e.op[1]
3*y*z
sage: e.op[1,1]
z
sage: e.op[-1]
x
sage: e.op[1:]
[3*y*z, z^y, x]
```

Using `__getitem__()` directly was not an option since it breaks conversion to numpy.

This looks like a good addition, after many sage-support queries - great!    I hope to be able to review this eventually, though it will take some time because I am not a Cython expert and would want to be very careful.

What is the `property` thing in Python/Cython?  I haven't heard of that before (as opposed to `def` or `cdef` or `class`).

Does this depend at all on any of the Pynac 0.2.1 tickets' patches?

I also found out about it while looking through the Sage library code for a way to make `numpy` work when I define `__getitem__()`:

Done. The new message is: "expressions containing only a numeric coefficient, constant or symbol have no operands"

> Any reason why expr.op isn't just a plain list?

I wanted to avoid traversing the vector storing the operands and creating a python object for each. A list wouldn't allow nested indexing either:

```
sage: x,y,z = var('x,y,z')
sage: e = x + x*y + z^y + 3*y*z; e
x*y + 3*y*z + z^y + x
sage: e.op[1]
3*y*z
sage: e.op[1,1]
z
```

This syntax was proposed in a discussion at Sage days 24 last summer.

I think that the part in expression.pyx still has this syntax, and I agree that it is confusing.  Putting 'needs info' just in case that is intentional.

Is the `normalize_index()` business needed because cdef'd things don't accept appropriate negative indices or something?  I get what it does, I don't get why it's necessary.  Maybe because of the potential for multiple indices to get suboperands?

Slowly working my way through it... Cython not being my forte... but looks good so far.

So far looks good - thanks to [a little help](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2936863/python-implementing-slicing-in-getitem) and [the Ginac refs](http://www.ginac.de/tutorial/Information-about-expressions.html).  

Questions, though.
* Regarding the error message:

```
sage: f = 3*x^2+2*sin(x)-32*sin(ln(x))
sage: f.op[3]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
IndexError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
IndexError: operand index out of range, got 3, expect between -3 and 3
```
   Is this really the error message we want?  Here it's the 'exclusive' between, but that could be confusing.  Maybe it should say between -3 and 2 (length ops -1)?  

* Next, I wonder whether the following can be supported:

```
sage: f.op[2:3,3]
TypeError: an integer is required
```
   since matrices can do this

```
sage: M = matrix(4,range(16))
sage: M[2:3]
[ 8  9 10 11]
sage: M[2:3,3]
[11]
```
   The current code ends everything if it's a slice; you just get the operands at that level.  But it would be interesting to get the 2nd element of each operand, though perhaps not very useful since you might not know what it is ahead of time.  But perhaps for very regular expressions (Christoffel symbol-type surfeit of indices?) it could be useful.  We might also want something like `sage: M[2:3,3:4]` to be supported, such as `sage: f.op[2,0:1]` instead of having to do 

```
sage: f.op[2].op[0:1]
[sin(log(x))]
```
   But maybe going back and forth between Ginac and Sage in the way you'd have to for that is tricky.
* Here is something needed for sure:

```
sage: f = 3*x^2+2*sin(x)-32*sin(ln(x))
sage: f[1]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
TypeError: 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression' object does not support indexing
sage: search_src('does not support indexing')
<no response>
```
   We should have at least one doctest *somewhere* that tests this.

But overall the code is correct for the promised functionality and passes its tests, documented pretty well *if* you know enough about !GEx etc.  So I would say good work, needs work for the last item above and probably the first, and needs info for the second item (matrix-style slices).

Thank you for the thorough reviews. I appreciate the feedback and it's certainly good for someone to look over my changes, since there are often rough edges I fail to see after staring at the code for a while.

The output is a list if the index is a slice. We could pass further indices to the list's `__getitem__()` of course, though I'm not convinced this convenience is really a good feature.

I added a test in the docstring for `__get__` in `expression.pyx`.

<div id="comment:15" align="right">Comment 15</div>

*cringe* I am ready to write some documentation if that gets people to use SAGE_LOCAL and SAGE_INC and all the other variables defined in module_list.py

```
numpy_depends = [SAGE_LOCAL + '/lib/python/site-packages/numpy/core/include/numpy/_numpyconfig.h']

flint_depends = [SAGE_LOCAL + '/include/FLINT/flint.h']
singular_depends = [SAGE_LOCAL + '/include/libsingular.h']
ginac_depends = [SAGE_LOCAL + '/include/pynac/ginac.h']
```
 rather than 

```
SAGE_ROOT + "/local/include/pynac/ginac.h"
```
and other combinations of SAGE_ROOT + "/local..."

I uploaded a new patch that just changes `module_list.py` to use `SAGE_LOCAL` instead of `SAGE_ROOT`.

Francois, why don't you open a ticket to rename `SAGE_ROOT` in `module_list.py` to something like `SAGE_ROOT_DO_NOT_USE` with a comment above it to point out why `SAGE_LOCAL` is better.
