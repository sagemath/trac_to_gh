I think parametric_plot and polar_plot should default to having an aspect ratio of 1.  Often we are plotting circles or other objects where we actually want to see the relationship between the two variables.

In my tests, mma also gives an aspect_ratio of 1 for these sorts of plots.

Looks good. I've added a little reviewer patch that adds in hyperlinks for the polar_plot docstring.
