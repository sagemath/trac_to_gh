<a id='comment:2'></a>Hi Robert!

I have been through the patch, and it sounds good! I won't have the time to actually test it before some time, so please anyone beat me to it!

Just one micro question: does PolynomialRing actually check that the ring is commutative?

Cheers

I went ahead and moved the functionality to it's own category since we want the mathematical information at the category level.  Could someone look over these changes?

Sorry for the very late answer. In MuPAD, we had a category for
univariate polynomial rings: there are several possible
implementations of such, and it's natural to factor out the generic
code, together with the category inheritance logic, in a category.

And yes, we have join categories. See Category.join.

I let you see whether to create the UnivariatePolynomialRing category
in this ticket or in a later ticket.

Aparently there is a doctest failure. I fixed it, but unfortunately it went into my patch submitted for #9138. Therefore, "needs work".

Question: Do we really want a category of polynomial rings? Or do we want that (1) polynomial rings use the category framework (that's the purpose of my patch for #9138) and (2) the category to which a given polynomial ring belongs is a bit narrower than simply "category of rings"? I hope it is the latter.

My suggestion is that I submit a small patch fixing the doctests. Please tell whether my patch for #9138 improves the multivariate case. Then, perhaps it would be possible to give Roberts patches (+ doctest fix) a positive review, so that we can focus on #9138.

Strange: Although the patch bot did see that error in one run, I can not reproduce it (but I had to change that test in my patch for #9138, because it turns `QQ['x'].category()` into the join of the category of euclidean domains and commutative algebras over `QQ`.

The other issue, namely the performance loss, was studied on [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/e4af3f1705b76955).

Florent Hivert found that a long mro does not matter for Python, but it *does* matter if the classes inherit from a cdef class. That is the case for most classes in Sage (inheriting from `SageObject`), so, we should address the problem of a long mro.

Eventually, that should be fixed in Cython (and I think Florent reported it upstream). But for now, it seems to me we should think of a work-around.

Would it be acceptable coding practice to explicitly state in a derived class (say, `MPolynomialRing_generic`), that frequently used methods such as base or base_ring are the same as `Parent.base` or `Parent.base_ring`? David Roe stated that it might be dangerous to do so, at least if `cpdef` methods are involved.

<a id='comment:13'></a>Concerning performance loss:

It seems to me that part of the reason is the fact that with the patchse, `__init_extra__` is not executed when it should. Sometimes, the parent methods of a category provide a useful `__init_extra__`, for example the category of algebras.

I am not sure yet why that happens, but I think it would happen if `Parent.__init__` is called without providing the category: Namely, doing `self._init_category_(...)` alone will *not* trigger the execution of `__init_extra__`.

<a id='comment:14'></a>It seems I was right!

Namely, the whole ring stuff is (unfortunately) inherited from `ParentWithGens`, which inherits from `ParentWithBase`, which inherits from `parent_old.Parent`.

And `parent_old.Parent` inherits from "the one and only Parent" -- but forgets to call `Parent.__init__`!! Instead, it just does `self._init_category_(...)`.

I'll change it and see what happens.

I attached a small patch to solve part of the problem of the missing parent initialisation: I call `Parent.__init__` and `ParentWithGens.__init__` explicitly, during initialisation of a ring. In that way, the `__init_extra__` methods are correctly picked up.

However, that does not solve the performance problem.

Question one: How can one come to speed?

<a id='comment:17'></a>FWIW: The doc tests pass.

Here is another idea what the slow down may come from. It was pointed out by Nicolas that the mro from the polynomial ring to `Parent` does not become longer by initialising the category properly: The inheritance from category parent classes comes *after* Python inheritance. However, when all the parent classes of all super categories must be searched, it takes considerably longer before an `AttributeError` can be raised.

A similar issue has been studied at #10467. It seems to be important that an attribute error is raised as quickly as possible. That becomes difficult, if 60 parent classes need to be searched, before one eventually finds that the requested attribute does not exist.

But probably that question is out of the scope of this ticket.

So, what shall one do? Give it a positive review and accept the deceleration, or wait until someone has a model for improved attribute access?

<a id='comment:19'></a>Perhaps it is a conversion map that is slower than necessary?

If you look at `sage.categories.algebras.Algebras.ParentMethods.__init_extra__`, you see that it tries to register a certain set morphism as a coercion from the base ring into the algebra (that obviously works only if the algebra is unital). 

But aparently a different coercion is used -- a slower coercion!

Namely, together with my patch from #9138:

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: R.category() # the __init_extra__ was supposed to be used.
Join of Category of unique factorization domains and Category of commutative algebras over Integer Ring
sage: c = R.convert_map_from(R.base_ring())
sage: c
Polynomial base injection morphism:
  From: Integer Ring
  To:   Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Integer Ring
```

That is not what `__init_extra__` attempted to register!

Let us compare:

```
sage: from sage.categories.morphism import SetMorphism
sage: H = R.base().Hom(R)
sage: f = SetMorphism(H,R.from_base_ring)
sage: timeit('c(100)',number=10^5)
100000 loops, best of 3: 8.13 Âµs per loop
sage: timeit('f(100)',number=10^5)
100000 loops, best of 3: 1.75 Âµs per loop
```

So, things could be considerably improved. Obvious questions: Will `from_base` always yield a faster approach than the base injection morphism? And can we enforce to use the faster coercion?

Aparently it is not so easy:

```
sage: AC = Algebras(ZZ).parent_class
sage: R._unset_coercions_used()
sage: AC.__init_extra__(R)
sage: R.convert_map_from(R.base_ring())
Polynomial base injection morphism:
  From: Integer Ring
  To:   Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Integer Ring
sage: R._unset_coercions_used()
sage: f.register_as_coercion()
sage: R.convert_map_from(R.base_ring())
Polynomial base injection morphism:
  From: Integer Ring
  To:   Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Integer Ring
```

Can you explain how to force the use of a particular map for coercion of the base ring?

<a id='comment:22'></a>Good news! Things are now *faster* than without the patches!

I found that one can considerably improve the conversion of an element of the base ring into a polynomial ring. Some polynomial rings used a generic conversion map, some used a polynomial base injection map -- and both were slow.

My inspiration came from `Algebras.ParentMethods.__init_extra__`: If R is a polynomial ring, then multiplication of a scalar with `R.one()` often is a very fast method to convert the scalar into R.

Problems:

* We should not assume that any ring has a unit (ok, polynomial rings over a unital ring have...).
* Calling `R.one()` will usually trigger the creation of a generic conversion - hence, it would be difficult to register it as conversion.
* Not all flavours of polynomial elements have a `_rmul_` (polynomial_element_generic has not).
* Sometimes, other conversion maps are registered when one wants to register the polynomial base injection map.

So, I implemented `_rmul_` and `_lmul_` for polynomial_element_generic, try various ways (old and new coercion model) of creating a One bypassing conversion maps, and in one init method of polynomial rings I decided to re-initialise the conversion maps.

**__Timings__**

I tried to test as many cases (multi- versus univariate, `libSingular` and others, different base rings,...). Without all the patches, we have the following:

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: timeit('(2*x-1)^2+5', number=10^4)
10000 loops, best of 3: 23.4 µs per loop
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: timeit('(2*x-1)^2+5', number=10^4)
10000 loops, best of 3: 24.6 µs per loop
sage: R.<x> = GF(3)[]
sage: timeit('(2*x-1)^2+5', number=10^4)
10000 loops, best of 3: 87.9 µs per loop
sage: R.<x> = QQ['t'][]

10000 loops, best of 3: 13 µs per loop
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: timeit('(2*x-1)^2+5', number=10^4)
10000 loops, best of 3: 16.6 µs per loop
sage: R.<x,y> = GF(3)[]
sage: timeit('(2*x-1)^2+5', number=10^4)
10000 loops, best of 3: 10.8 µs per loop
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ['t'][]
sage: timeit('(2*x-1)^2+5', number=10^4)
10000 loops, best of 3: 238 µs per loop
sage: R.<x,y> = Qp(3)[]
sage: timeit('(2*x-1)^2+5', number=10^4)
10000 loops, best of 3: 511 µs per loop
sage: R.<x> = Qp(3)[]
sage: timeit('(2*x-1)^2+5', number=10^4)
10000 loops, best of 3: 1.06 ms per loop
```

With the patches, I get

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: timeit('(2*x-1)^2+5', number=10^4)
10000 loops, best of 3: 8.97 µs per loop

10000 loops, best of 3: 10.5 µs per loop
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ['t'][]
sage: timeit('(2*x-1)^2+5', number=10^4)
10000 loops, best of 3: 187 µs per loop
sage: R.<x,y> = Qp(3)[]
sage: timeit('(2*x-1)^2+5', number=10^4)
10000 loops, best of 3: 503 µs per loop
sage: R.<x> = Qp(3)[]
sage: timeit('(2*x-1)^2+5', number=10^4)
10000 loops, best of 3: 1.08 ms per loop
```

So, there is no significant slow down at all, but a considerable speed up in most cases.

I suppose it can now be reviewed. I understood that the Robert's patches essentially have a positive review, except for the slow-down. So, would it suffice if some of you test my patch?

Rings() assumes its objects to be unital. If we want to support
polynomials over non unital rings, then this should go through the use
of Rngs(). If we make sure the coercion morphism from the base ring is always declared by Algebras(), all we will have to do is to use some new category NonUnitalAlgebras() when the base ring is just in Rngs(). Bwt: having a PolynomialRings() (PolynomialRngs?) category would be a good way to factor out this logic.

But one thing at a time :-)

<a id='comment:34'></a>For some obscure reason, this breaks the following test on 32-bit systems:

```
sage -t "devel/sage-main/sage/modular/abvar/morphism.py"
```

The problem is that the following command hangs forever:

```
sage: J = J1(12345)
sage: J.hecke_operator(997)
```

Interestingly, interrupting at this point makes the command return the **correct output** without raising a `KeyboardInterrupt` which is a bug within the bug.

The fact that errors (including interrupts) are ignored in this code is very bad in itself, I think there must be some `except:` catching all this.

Is computing `2**63` (with Python ints) a problem on 32 bit?? Apparently not:

```
sage: int(2)**int(63)

So, the problem isn't solved, yet.

<a id='comment:43'></a>I think I found it!

The problem occurs during initialisation of `sage.modular.abvar.homspace.EndomorphismSubring`. It is first initialised as a homset with a specific category `cat` that does not belong to the category of rings, and then as a ring. The second initialisation tries to put it into the category of rings, which seems to be a bad idea after the first initialisation.

Solution:

Form the join of `cat` with the category of rings. Initialise it as a ring with that join category (which became possible with #9944!). Eventually, initialise it as a homspace, with the same category.

With that little magic, the error seems to disappear. But now I need to do tests.

Cheers,

Simon

<a id='comment:44'></a>The problem seems solved.

What I did: Initialise the endomorphism ring first as a ring, and provide it with the intended category. Then initialise it as a homset as well. That solves the problem in the sense that it disappears.

Admittedly I can not explain how exactly the problem has originally emerged. But I guess it makes sense that it is a problem if a homset gives itself a certain category and then sage.rings.ring.Ring tries to work with another category.

With the new patch, we have (also as an additional doc test)

```
sage: J = J1(12345)
sage: J.endomorphism_ring()
Endomorphism ring of Abelian variety J1(12345) of dimension 5405473
```
both on my machine (x86_64 Linux) and on bsd.math in a 32 bit installation. Moreover, on both machines, the tests in sage.modular pass.

Needs review, I guess.

Note that the whole point of this ticket is to do more things during initialisation of polynomial rings. So, no surprise that initialisation becomes a lot slower. However, I agree that it should not be *that* slow.

<a id='comment:53'></a>I think I somehow located the problem. I created recursively a univariate polynomial ring, as in your example, with a total of 8 variables:

```
sage: S
Univariate Polynomial Ring in w over Univariate Polynomial Ring in w over Univariate Polynomial Ring in w over Univariate Polynomial Ring in w over Univariate Polynomial Ring in w over Univariate Polynomial Ring in w over Univariate Polynomial Ring in w over Univariate Polynomial Ring in w over Finite Field in a of size 3^2
```

Then, with the patches

```
sage: timeit("S(0)")
5 loops, best of 3: 83 ms per loop
```
but without the patches

```
sage: timeit("S(0)")
625 loops, best of 3: 121 µs per loop
```

Since the above relies on coercion maps, which are compositions of polynomial base injection maps, and since my patch touched the polynomial base injection maps, it is conceivable that we'll find the problem there.

Note, however, that it might be a better solution to let the composition of two polynomial base injection maps be another polynomial base injection map -- that ought to be a lot faster than a composite map.

<a id='comment:54'></a>The original implementation of a polynomial basering injection relies on a method `_new_constant_poly`, which turns out to be rather slow in most cases except the case of dense univariate polynomials -- they have a custom version of `_new_constant_poly`, while the others rely on a generic implementation.

So, instead of my former suggestion ("use `one._rmul_(x)` to coerce x into P with `one = P.one_element()`), it may be better to provide the other polynomial classes with a faster implementation of `_new_constant_poly`. That's what I am trying now.

<a id='comment:56'></a>I am totally frustrated.

I made some improvements to `_new_constant_poly`, whose purpose is to provide the quickest way in the given implementation to construct a constant polynomial, and made some other changes that should improve the coercions. There were improvements in all examples above.

However, I am now getting tons of failures and even segfaults in sage/schemes.

I tracked one type of error down, I thought. But apparently I only covered one special case of that one type of error.

While I was at it, I fixed the documentation for `hyperelliptic_padic_field`, which is not yet included into the manual, and which had syntax errors in all doc strings.

That has now changed.\n\n__Sparse versus dense versus differently implemented polynomial rings__\n\nA univariate polynomial ring can be sparse or dense, and if it is dense and over `ZZ` (or also `QQ`) they can be implemented with `FLINT` or `NTL`.

I was not sure whether one should silently ignore arguments that are not used, or should raise an error if they are provided. I decided to ignore `sparse` if it is not supported, and raise an error for dense or multivariate rings if an implementation is not supported.\n\nWe have, e.g.:\n\n```\nsage: S.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(ZZ,sparse=True)\nsage: S is ZZ['x','y']\nTrue  # used to be False\nsage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(ZZ,sparse=True,implementation='FLINT')\nsage: S.<x> = PolynomialRing(ZZ,sparse=True,implementation='NTL')\nsage: R is S\nTrue  # used to be False\nsage: R == ZZ['x']\nFalse # used to be True\nsage: S.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(ZZ, implementation='NTL')\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n...\nValueError: The NTL implementation is not known for multivariate polynomial rings\n```\n\nThe last example used to return a ring that was equal but not identic to `ZZ['x','y']`!\n\nPolynomial rings are now equal if and only if they are identical.

<a id='comment:59'></a>Finally I got my new patch to work. Here are the new features and, in particular, the new timings. I think it was worth the effort!

__Polynomial Construction Functors__

```
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(GF(5), sparse=True)
sage: F,B = R.construction()
sage: F(B) is R
True   # was False
```

__zero_element__

In various places, constructions such as self.parent()(0) are used. It should be more efficient to have self.parent().zero_element() instead, in particular if this is cached using the improved cached methods from #11115.

That means I had to introduce zero_element() for various classes, mostly in sage/modular.

__Fix zero element of free module homomorphisms__

The following used to fail with an error:

```
sage: V = span([[1/2,1,1],[3/2,2,1],[0,0,1]],ZZ)
sage: V.Hom(V).zero()
Free module morphism defined by the matrix
[0 0 0]
[0 0 0]
[0 0 0]
Domain: Free module of degree 3 and rank 3 over Integer Ring
Echelon ...
Codomain: Free module of degree 3 and rank 3 over Integer Ring
Echelon ...
```

__Calling any parent with None should return zero__

This used to be true for finite prime fields, but failed with an error
for finite non-prime fields:

```
sage: GF(5)(None)
0
sage: GF(5^2,'a')(None)
0
```

__Implement/improve `_new_constant_poly` for various polynomial classes__

This is the main reason why the timings stated below have improved. I thought that `_new_constant_poly` should be a method of a polynomial ring, but I think it should better stay as a method of polynomials: Polynomials are often implemented in Cython, but polynomial rings in Python.

In order to get a little bit of more speed, I introduce another parameter to `_new_constant_poly`, namely the parent in which the new polynomial is supposed to be created. This is because often the parent `P` of a polynomial `self` is already known when calling `self._new_constant_poly(a, P)`, so that it would be a waste of time to call `self.parent()` internally to determine the parent.

__Improve Polynomial Base Injection Morphisms and use it for coercion__

Conversion into a polynomial ring P from its base ring occurs frequently and should be as quick as possible.

I had already improved the performance in the old patch version. However, it turned out to be better to use `_new_constant_poly`, rather than always using multiplication with `P.one()`.

The rule is now: If `P.an_element()` has a `_new_constant_poly` method then it is used. Otherwise, if one can construct a one element in `P` without calling coercion, and if it has `_rmul_` and if `_rmul_` does not return `None` then it is used. Otherwise, `P._element_constructor_` is used.

Polynomial base injection morphisms are now always registered as coercion.

__Call method for compiled polynomials__

The documentation for compiled polynomials states that it can be called, although the cdef method `.eval(...)` has less overhead. That was not true, there has been no `__call__` method. I added one.

__Constant polynomial section__

It was stated that it uses the `constant_coefficient` method, which can be optimized for a particulare polynomial type. However, in fact a generic `constant_coefficient` method was **explicitly** called, even if a polynomial type did provide a more efficient method. That has now changed.

__Sparse versus dense versus differently implemented polynomial rings__

A univariate polynomial ring can be sparse or dense, and if it is dense and over `ZZ` (or also `QQ`) they can be implemented with `FLINT` or `NTL`. Dense and sparse rings used to be equal, but they were not identical - a violation to the unique parent assumption.

Moreover, in the multivariate case, the `implementation` and `sparse` arguments had no effect on the resulting ring, but were used in the cache key, yielding another violation of the unique parent assumption.

I resolved these violations. I was not sure whether one should silently ignore arguments that are not used, or should raise an error if they are provided. I decided to ignore `sparse` if it is not supported, and raise an error for dense or multivariate rings if an implementation is not supported.

We have, e.g.:

```
sage: S.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(ZZ,sparse=True)
sage: S is ZZ['x','y']
True  # used to be False
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(ZZ,sparse=True,implementation='FLINT')
sage: S.<x> = PolynomialRing(ZZ,sparse=True,implementation='NTL')
sage: R is S
True  # used to be False
sage: R == ZZ['x']
False # used to be True
sage: S.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(ZZ, implementation='NTL')
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: The NTL implementation is not known for multivariate polynomial rings
```

The last example used to return a ring that was equal but not identic to `ZZ['x','y']`!

Polynomial rings are now equal if and only if they are identical. Coercions exist from the non-default to the default version of a ring (hence, from sparse to dense, from NTL to FLINT.

```
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(ZZ)
sage: S.<x> = PolynomialRing(ZZ, implementation='NTL')
sage: R == S
False
sage: R.has_coerce_map_from(S)
True
sage: S.has_coerce_map_from(R)
False
sage: S.<x> = PolynomialRing(ZZ, sparse=True)
sage: R == S
False
sage: R.has_coerce_map_from(S)
True
sage: S.has_coerce_map_from(R)
False
```

By consequence, the parent of a sum of polynomials is now unique - it used to depend on the summation order if dense and sparse summands were involved.

__Documentation and examples__

I think all changes are covered by doctests. Occasionally I fixed wrongly formatted docstrings.

__Performance__

Here are the new timings for the examples that we had discussed above. I use sage-4.7.alpha5 with the patches from this ticket applied, and I compare with timings that I had obtained with an unpatched version of sage-4.7.alpha5

There is no significant change in the startup time: I got `1.253` for sage.all in unpatched sage, but the margin of error seems rather wide.

```
$ sage -startuptime
...
## Slowest (including children)
1.100 sage.all (None)
0.279 sage.schemes.all (sage.all)
0.178 twisted.persisted.styles (sage.all)
0.164 elliptic_curves.all (sage.schemes.all)
0.162 ell_rational_field (elliptic_curves.all)
0.150 ell_number_field (ell_rational_field)
...
```

Here is the example brought up by Jeroen. There is now a drastic speedup were previously was a drastic slow down:

```
sage: S = GF(9,'a')
sage: %time for n in range(8): S = PolynomialRing(S,'w')
CPU times: user 0.03 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.03 s
Wall time: 0.03 s
# unpatched: 0.04 s
sage: len(S.variable_names_recursive())
8
sage: timeit("S(0)")
625 loops, best of 3: 27.9 µs per loop
# with only the other patches: 83 ms
# unpatched: 121 µs
```

Here is the example brought up by Martin Raum:

```
sage: R = PolynomialRing(ZZ, ['a' + str(n) for n in range(10000)])
sage: x = R.gen(0)
sage: timeit('(2*x - 1)^2 + 5', number = 10^4)
10000 loops, best of 3: 58.2 µs per loop
# unpatched: 66.9 µs
```

Here are the arithmetic examples that I had provided earlier:

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: timeit('(2*x-1)^2+5', number=10^4)
10000 loops, best of 3: 8.58 µs per loop

```

So, in **all** examples there is a noticeable speedup.

__Conclusion__

The new patch cleans coercion of polynomial rings, by enforcing uniqueness of parents.

It considerably improves the performance, even when comparing with the improvements that were introduced in the previous patches.

`sage -testall -long` passed. So, it is finally ready for review again.

Depends on sage-4.7

I stand corrected. The above rule did hold for an intermediate (unpublished) patch version. With the new patch, all polynomial classes have `_new_constant_poly`, and it will *always* be used for basering injection.

Hence, there is a return statement after getting `_new_constant_poly`, and the subsequent lines of `sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_element.PolynomialBaseInjection.__init__` will never be executed. I will remove them in the final patch version, but I first wait for input of a referee.

It **is** tested. The patch has added the following test:

```

            sage: V = span([[1/2,1,1],[3/2,2,1],[0,0,1]],ZZ)
            sage: V.Hom(V).zero()
            Free module morphism defined by the matrix
            [0 0 0]
            [0 0 0]
            [0 0 0]
            Domain: Free module of degree 3 and rank 3 over Integer Ring
            Echelon ...
            Codomain: Free module of degree 3 and rank 3 over Integer Ring
            Echelon ...
```
In unpatched sage-4.7.alpha5, you would get

```
ERROR: An unexpected error occurred while tokenizing input
The following traceback may be corrupted or invalid
The error message is: ('EOF in multi-line statement', (396, 0))

Simon, you are completely right about the doctest with span. Could we add #indirect doctest so that attention is drawn to this?

Some issues, that I encountered:
in polynomial_element.pxy new line 5352 : what about p-adics? I haven't had the time to check, but perhaps you can already say something about it.
in polynomial_element.pxy new line 6180ff : there are two returns that do not belong there

in polynomial_real_mpfr_dense.pxy new line 57: Do you mean [0]?
in polynomial_ring.py new line 468 : The coercing is the other way around.

Please don't forget to check the rejects that I've mentioned above. This could be a real problem for Jeroen.

So far, these are amazingly few issues for such a huge patch!

Hope to continue this by tomorrow (night).

Martin

<a id='comment:72'></a>Replying to [comment:70 mraum]:
> Simon, you are completely right about the doctest with span. Could we add #indirect doctest so that attention is drawn to this?


OK, and perhaps I even add a comment like "The method zero() calls this hom space with a function, not with a matrix, and that case had previously not been taken care of".

> Some issues, that I encountered:
> in polynomial_element.pxy new line 5352 : what about p-adics? I haven't had the time to check, but perhaps you can already say something about it.


You mean the fact that I return `<Polynomial>self._parent(self[:n])` when it previously was `<Polynomial>self._parent(self[:n], check=False)`?

I tried to reconstruct what made me do that change. It now seems to me that it was not because of a bug but because I thought `self[:n]` would return a truncated list of coefficients, which apparently is not the case (at least not always).

Anyway. *If* you feed a truncated list of coefficients into the element constructor of a univariate polynomial ring, and if you give `check=False`, then you could create a polynomial whose list of coefficients ends with a zero. That is a problem for non-padic polynomials, since `valuation()` and other methods will result in an error.

So, `if` there are polynomials p so that `p[:n]` returns the list of the first n coefficients, then `check=False` is a bug.

However, if `p[:n]` returns a polynomial that actually has the right parent, then the argument `check` will not be tested at all. So, `False` or `True` does not matter.

**Conclusion:** Removing `check=True` should have no influence on performance, but may fix a potential problem (depending on the behaviour of `p[:n]`).


In any case, it can not be a problem for padics, even *if* `self[:n]` returns a list: I do not remove trailing zeroes from the coefficient list, but simply let the element constructor of `self._parent` decide what to do -- and the element constructor of padic and non-padic polynomial rings will do the right thing.

Here is a padic example:

```
sage: P.<x> = Zp(5)[]
sage: p = x^4
sage: p.truncate(3).valuation()
+Infinity
```
and that is because `p[:3].parent() is P`.

I just found that the existing test for the `truncate` method in `sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_element` does *not* test that method. Namely:

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]; S.<y> = R[]
sage: f = y^3 + x*y -3*x
sage: from sage.misc.sageinspect import sage_getfile, sage_getsourcelines
sage: sage_getfile(f.truncate)
'/mnt/local/king/SAGE/sage-4.7.alpha5/devel/sage/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_element.pyx'
sage: sage_getsourcelines(f.truncate)[1]
6000
```

So, `f.truncate` is a different truncate method. I'll change that doctest by making S a sparse polynomial ring:

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]; S.<y> = PolynomialRing(R, sparse=True)
sage: f = y^3 + x*y -3*x
sage: sage_getfile(f.truncate)
'/mnt/local/king/SAGE/sage-4.7.alpha5/devel/sage/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_element.pyx'
sage: sage_getsourcelines(f.truncate)[1]
5335
```

> in polynomial_element.pxy new line 6180ff : there are two returns that do not belong there


Yep. See post 60. I promised to remove the lines starting with the comment `# this is likely to be overridden below:` in the final patch version, but wanted to wait for input of a reviewer (thank you, reviewer!)

> in polynomial_real_mpfr_dense.pxy new line 57: Do you mean [0]?


Yes, and I'm changing it, although `i` works as well:

```
sage: from sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_real_mpfr_dense import PolynomialRealDense
sage: PolynomialRealDense(RR['x'],None)
0
```

> in polynomial_ring.py new line 468 : The coercing is the other way around.


Thank you!

I'll try it, and will soon submit a new version of the last patch.

I went through all patches that where merged since 4.7.alpha5 according to http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/release/sage-4.7.rc2/tickets.html

I found no patch touching sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_element.pyx, actually no patch that contains the word fragment "poly".

So, I am still puzzled. Perhaps the release manager can state what ticket (in addition to #11139) I have to take into account.

I don't see the need, since it does apply to 4.7.rc2, IMHO.

I think I misunderstood your remark: You do not complain about the fact that there is a bare `except`, but you noticed that the TypeError is constructed but not raised. That's odd, of course.

I found the following example, in which the error should be raised:

```
sage: K.<a>=GF(next_prime(2**60)**3)
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(K,implementation='NTL')
sage: R([3,'1234'])
3*x + 3
```
Hence, currently there is no error raised and the result is absolute nonsense.

I'll fix that.

<a id='comment:82'></a>To me this sounds reasonable.

I have just made the changes to rebase to 4.7.1.alpha0. I think the point of Jeroen was that he will work with this version anyway and its only two tiny changes. Send your new patches, I will do the rebase and then I think Jeroen can imediatelly go for it (if he wants to).

What is "this"? Do you mean, raising an error is reasonable, or trying conversion rather than coercion is reasonable?

<a id='comment:84'></a>I found another bug in polynomial_zz_pex.pyx:

```
sage: K.<a>=GF(next_prime(2**60)**3)
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(K,implementation='NTL')
sage: R([3,x])
ERROR: An unexpected error occurred while tokenizing input
The following traceback may be corrupted or invalid
The error message is: ('EOF in multi-line statement', (1154, 0))
Traceback (most recent call last):

TypeError: polynomial() takes exactly one argument (0 given)
```

I suggest to not only catch an attribute error (namely when requesting `e.polynomial()`) but also a type error.

And my preference is to do try a conversion, before raising an error on a failing coercion. If that sounds reasonable to you then I'll submit an update of my patch.

With the new patch version, we have

```
sage: K.<a>=GF(next_prime(2**60)**3)
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(K,implementation='NTL')
sage: R([3,'1234'])
1234*x + 3
sage: R([3,'12e34'])
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: unable to convert '12e34' into the base ring
sage: R([3,x])
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: unable to convert x into the base ring
```
So, a conversion is attempted, and the error message is mentioning conversion and not coercion.

The tests of polynomial_zz_pex.pyx pass. I didn't test the rest of Sage.

<a id='comment:89'></a>Hi Martin,

could it be that you had worked with an old version of [attachment:trac9944_polynomial_speedup.patch]?

There was a misspelling that I had introduced into the documentation of polynomial base injection maps, in the original version of that patch: It was

```
We use `_rmul_` and not `_lmul_` since...
```
where it should have been

```
We use ``_rmul_`` and not ``_lmul_`` since...
```

I had corrected that typo and updated the patch. But in your version [attachment:trac-9944-polynomial_speedup.patch], you still have the single back tick.

Anyway. If you apply my version or your version of the two patches, the result will be the same, namely two backticks around _rmul_ and _lmul_

<a id='comment:94'></a>I hope it is OK that I modified one test in sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_ring, by the new patch [attachment:trac9944_addendum.patch].

That test used to be

```
sage: QQ['y'] < QQ['x']
False
sage: QQ['y'] < QQ['z']
True
```

But that is unsafe, because this ticket removes the custom `__cmp__` method of polynomial rings. So, the comparison relies on virtually random data such as `id(QQ['x'])`, if I am not mistaken.

Therefore, it seems safer to me to replace it by

```
sage: QQ['y'] != QQ['x']
True
sage: QQ['y'] != QQ['z']
True
```

I reckon that it does not matter to the release manager, unless one re-opens a ticket that is already closed (but that has not been the case here).
