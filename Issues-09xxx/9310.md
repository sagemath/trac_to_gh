Thus a change somewhere *else* in Sage is causing this problem.

There seems to be a **lot** of doctests which are failing in a non-reproducible way. 

* elliptic_curves/BSD.py #9273 (Whilst #9316 is supposed to fix the spurious "# File not found" error at end of doctests, BSD.py has still failed for me in non-reproducible way. See #9449 which shows the output of `make ptestlong` First BSD.py fails without printing the  "# File not found" message, then it passes. 
* devel/sage/sage/misc/trace.py - see #9446
* devel/sage/doc/fr/tutorial/programming.rst - see #9449, where this failed first time, but subsequently passed on the same computer, with the same build of Sage. (Though a couple of patches were applied the second time). 
* devel/sage/sage/schemes/plane_curves/constructor.py - again see #9449 which failed once, then passed on a second run. 
* devel/sage/sage/parallel/decorate.py
This failed both times, but on the first time it failed, the test was reported to have a 0 failures! 

```
    sage -t     -long devel/sage/sage/parallel/decorate.py # 0 doctests failed
```
After adding patches #8641, #9243, #9316 which are related to the doctesting framework, this was at least reported as one doctest failing in `devel/sage/sage/parallel/decorate.py` 

```
       sage -t  -long devel/sage/sage/parallel/decorate.py # 1 doctests failed
```
I'm not however convinced that the addition of  #8641, #9243 and #9316 were the result of the improved behavior, as other tests still failed with 0 reported failures. 

**IT SEEMS TO ME, THE DOCTESTING FRAMEWORK IS BROKEN IN SAGE NOW**

As noted in #10739, I have two independent builds of sage-4.6.2.alpha3 on my machine, one in which this test passes and the other in which it fails.

Replying to [vbraun](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/10739#comment:10) (from #10739)
> But if one build repeatedly passes "make ptest" and the other consistently fails, this would be an excellent opportunity to debug #9310. Presumably the only difference is that the first compilation was interrupted at one point, so the order in which spkgs were built is different.

Precisely, the first build was interrupted (see #10739 for details) and the second was not.

> This might have changed linked libraries in some components due to (undiscovered) soft dependencies, for example. Can you diff the two trees (excluding log files etc) and find out the difference? 

I ran `diff -rq` on the two directories and there are about 25000 files that differ (pyc files, pyo files, ...). I figured that this might have something to do with hardcoded paths, so I moved one out of the way, moved the other into its place, launched sage to reset the hardcoded paths, and then ran `diff -rq` on the two trees. It still shows about 25000 differing files.

Any suggestions on what to try next?

I did run the test 1000x with -randorder, and found a couple of doctests that depend on the execution order. Since we always initialize GAP's random number generator it is very likely that the output of these operations depends on the order of memory locations. Presumably this causes the doctest failure on some architectures even without -randorder.

The problems are in 
* `module_composition_factors`
* `as_permutation_group`
* `random_element`

The first two use `MeatAxe`. I think that `random_element` enumerates all group elements and then picks a random one. We do control the random numbers, but enumerating uses the coset enumerator and presumably depends on memory locations.
