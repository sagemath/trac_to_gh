Due to the use of deprecated/obsolete GMP functions, the test suite of flint-1.5.0.p5 fails to build since merging the new MPIR 2.1.3 (#8664), or if one uses any other recent version of MPIR or GMP.  This means that the package's installation fails if `SAGE_CHECK=yes`:

```

I guess Bill has already fixed that in FLINT 1.5.2, which was released over a year ago. So simply updating the spkg might suffice.

Btw, at least the current FLINT in Sage ignores user-provided `CFLAGS`; one could perhaps "move" them into some other environment variable used by FLINT.

### flint-1.5.0.p10 (Leif Leonhardy, October 11th 2011)
* #9858: Add an upstream patch from FLINT 1.5.2 to make FLINT's test suite
  build (when `SAGE_CHECK=yes`) with MPIR 1.3.x, 2.x (cf. #8664) and GMP 5.x.
  The patch just substitutes deprecated random functions in one file
  (`fmpz-test.c`) which have been removed from the mentioned GMP / MPIR
  versions.

FLINT 1.6 was released on/for Chrismas (Dec. 24th).

Unless somebody else already did/does I'll open a ticket to upgrade Sage's version to that one.

Since Sage currently does weird things with the Makefile, providing a new, "clean" spkg will take some time (besides testing collaboration with the new FLINT of course).

(Though FLINT is a **plain C** library, with a **separate** module to interface with NTL, which is C++ and hence the interface as well, Sage builds one monolithic "FLINT" library with that interface module included such that it always depends on the NTL library and the C++ standard library, which is totally odd and frequently causes trouble. Changing that requires changes to the *Sage library*, including `module_list.py` and perhaps `setup.py`, too.)

---

The FLINT spkg also needs to be upgraded (to at least version 1.5.2, plus one simple patch) to work on Linux/ARM, see #10328.

Just for the record:

I have some flint-1.5.2.p1 around to address only the most important issues (changes not yet committed though).

There's **much** wrong with this spkg (including upstream), but in the light of FLINT 1.6.0 and 2.1.0 (already released), *this* ticket is mainly intended to prevent FLINT being a show stopper for #8664 and #5847.

I'll perhaps include the patch from #10328, too.

Feel free to ping me w.r.t. uploading a new spkg in case this ticket further drags... ;-)

Upgrading to FLINT 1.5.2, which fixes the original issue and a few other bugs in FLINT 1.5.0.

More precisely, rebasing the FLINT 1.5.2 spkg I already have (which also includes a couple of fixes to Sage's part) on the changes that were made to the 1.5.0 spkg in Sage since the p5.

Upgrading to FLINT 1.6 shouldn't hurt, but would now be better done on a follow-up ticket.

As Bill meanwhile also disclosed on sage-release, they're working hard on a FLINT 2.x (planned as a Christmas present) that implements all features that Sage requires, since the current one doesn't yet provide all we need. (FLINT 2 is a complete rewrite of FLINT 1).  So upgrading to that is not an option at the moment.

For the record, I'm working on that, and not just since today btw.

Nevertheless, nobody should have touched the 1.5.0[.p5] spkg (or earlier ones) **without** upgrading to 1.5.2, since it fixes other critical bugs.

I've made a FLINT 1.5.0.p10 spkg which just fixes the trivial test suite build error (see the ticket's description), since providing a *clean* FLINT 1.5.2 spkg based on the 1.5.0.p9 is tedious and still takes some time, hopefully just until tomorrow.

Please test (with `SAGE_CHECK=yes` of course, and an MPIR >=1.3.x or GMP 5.x, e.g. with Sage 4.7.2.alpha**3**) and review!

(Unless you're happy with unmerging the overdue MPIR upgrade from Sage 4.7.2 just for this reason.)

Thanks in advance.
