tart with a build of Sage for which all long doctests pass.  Run, e.g.,

```sh
$ ./sage -t -a --long --randorder 12345
```
Many tests fail.

I suggest that for a while we use keyword "random_test_failure" for these.

Volker suggested adding `# seed0` tag to tests that should not be run when `--randorder` is not zero (i.e. the default). I guess that it is a good idea, but maybe we should see some examples first. #21054 is clearly an error; #21080 fails in a line with comment "needed until #19269 is fixed"; `src/sage/graphs/base/graph_backends.pyx` gives a deprecation warning.
