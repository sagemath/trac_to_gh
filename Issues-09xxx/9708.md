I tried the plot3d example that involves "mesh=True" and it is completely broken.  The plot simply doesn't show a mesh at all.

```
plot3d(sin(x-y)*y*cos(x),(x,-3,3),(y,-3,3), mesh=True)
```
[This is the Trac macro *a 3d plot, but with no mesh* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#a 3d plot, but with no mesh-macro)

It looks like the mesh actually works, but the keywords just aren't getting passed to show.  See http://test.sagenb.org/home/pub/25/

`plot3d(f,(x,-3,3),(y,-3,3),mesh=True) ` doesn't work, but `plot3d(f,(x,-3,3),(y,-3,3)).show(mesh=True) ` does work.

This just came up again (see [this interact](http://aleph.sagemath.org/?q=36ba599a-ded6-4afe-97da-2a16b4d166c2), for instance) in the PREP 2012 workshop, as I was trying to help someone set orientation.

Repeating Jason's example from this context,

```
    p2=plot3d(f(x,y),(x,-5,5),(y,-5,5))
    show(p2,figsize=3,mesh=True,orientation=(0,0,0,0))
```
works, but 

```
    p2=plot3d(f(x,y),(x,-5,5),(y,-5,5),mesh=True,orientation=(0,0,0,0))
```
doesn't.  (Doesn't matter what `f` is, pick your favorite.)

#6184 turns out to be a red herring; we are not passing the keywords on, as Jason pointed out.  Hopefully this won't be too hard to fix.
