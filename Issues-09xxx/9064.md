There's a single file in matrix/padics and it is an empty __init__.py.

Says David Roe: "Yeah, oversight.  At some point I was planning on working on p-adic matrices, and I guess the __init__.py file got put in then.  Since I'm not going to work on it anytime soon, it can safely be removed."

Since the file is empty, I can't do think of any way to actually do this with HG.  It seems impossible.  

```
flat:matrix wstein$ hg rm  padics
removing padics/__init__.py
flat:matrix wstein$ 
flat:matrix wstein$ 
flat:matrix wstein$ hg ci
flat:matrix wstein$ hg export ip
abort: unknown revision 'ip'!
flat:matrix wstein$ hg export tip
# HG changeset patch
# User William Stein <wstein@gmail.com>
# Date 1281549848 25200

trac 9064 -- remove p-adic matrix directory
```
(see nothing!)

So there is no patch to post, and I take David Roe's statement (above) as a positive review.

So to the release manager merging this, just do the following:

```
cd SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/sage/matrix
sage -hg rm  padics
sage -hg ci
```

and checkin the resulting empty patch.    Unfortunately, this won't do anything for people doing "sage -upgrade".  Anyway, it's an empty directory so whatever happens is pretty harmless.
