John Palmieri has built most of Sage on the host fulvia, but there are a number of tests related to sympow that are failing. The summary at the end shows:

```
The following tests failed:
sage -t  -long devel/sage/sage/modular/hecke/submodule.py # 1 doctests failed
sage -t  -long devel/sage/sage/modular/abvar/abvar.py # 1 doctests failed
sage -t  -long devel/sage/sage/lfunctions/sympow.py # 13 doctests failed
sage -t  -long devel/sage/sage/stats/hmm/chmm.pyx # 3 doctests failed
sage -t  -long devel/sage/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_rational_field.py # 17 doctests failed
sage -t  -long devel/sage/sage/symbolic/expression.pyx # 2 doctests failed
Total time for all tests: 7305.2 seconds
```

of these test failures, the following three are attributed to SYMPOW

```
sage -t  -long devel/sage/sage/modular/abvar/abvar.py # 1 doctests failed
sage -t  -long devel/sage/sage/lfunctions/sympow.py # 13 doctests failed
sage -t  -long devel/sage/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_rational_field.py # 17 doctests failed
```
Looking at the source code, it is not valid C, so it's quite possible the code gets mis-compiled. In fact, IMHO, gcc should reject the code - just as the Sun compiler does. 

I'll try to work out what was intended and see if the code can be re-written in a way that compiles with the Sun compiler, in which case gcc should have more chance of generating correct code.

By generating the data files directly, with `SAGE_LOCAL/lib/sympow/new_data`,  I was able to get the "optional" and "not tested" examples [here](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/sage/lfunctions/sympow.html) to run.  To really run `./sympow -new_data 2` for the example `a = sympow.L(EllipticCurve('11a'), 2, 16); a`, I ran

```sh
$ ./sage -sh
> cd SAGE_LOCAL/lib/sympow
> ./new_data sh gp '-sp 2'
```
For the example `print sympow.Lderivs(EllipticCurve('11a'), 1, 16, 2)`, I ran

```sh
$ ./sage -sh
> cd SAGE_LOCAL/lib/sympow
> ./new_data sh gp '-sp 1 -dv 0'
> ./new_data sh gp '-sp 1 -dv 1'
> ./new_data sh gp '-sp 1 -dv 2'
```
It seems that part of the Sage interface to SYMPOW is broken.

But I don't know if missing data files caused the failures reported here and at #9166.

Or maybe `sympow` itself doesn't properly call `new_data`?

On the other hand, there is this (after running "sage -sh" and "cd $SAGE_LOCAL/lib/sympow"):

```
$ ./sympow -curve "[0,-1,1,-10,-20]" -moddeg
sympow 1.018 RELEASE  (c) Mark Watkins -**ERROR** QD_check failed at x[1]
```
On my mac or on sage.math, this produces valid output, including the line

```
Modular Degree is 1
```
which is what is parsed by the `modular_degree` method.  So it looks to me as though sympow is really broken, not just its interface.  

(Furthermore, regardless of the C code, I think that sympow.py would never be accepted into Sage today: too many untested methods.)

Try that on the **global** installation of sage on sage.math - not your own private one. 

I'm told part of the problem is that SYMPOW is trying to write data files below its installation directory. So it fails on a global installation of Sage, unless the user the user has root access. 

But there's very little error checking, so the fact the data files are not created is not reported. 

> It seems that part of the Sage interface to SYMPOW is broken.


If it was only that! 
 
> But I don't know if missing data files caused the failures reported here and at #9166.


To the best of my knowledge, not all examples need data files. When they do, a message is printed telling one how to create the data files. So that is not all the reason. That is certainly applied by the README file in the source code. 

I've run the `smypow` executable from the command line, and find problems unrelated to the generation of data files. 

It's not just the C code that is bad. There's a `Configure script` that starts with `#!/bin/sh`, then has code which checks if `sh` is on your system or not! 

My preference would be to remove this, or at least move it to experimental, but William seems keen to keep it as a standard package. It seems a bit strange to me given. 

* This is apparently very specialised code. 
* It is so badly written
* It is causing problems on Solaris x86, Cygwin and ArchLinux. 

That seems an alful lot of problems 

I'm cc'ing a few people that I know have looked at SYMPOW at some point in the past. They might have some comments. Perhaps William has some comments to he would like to add to the ticket.

I'll comment. I am the one who told that to David. I have shamelessly sat on this info for about 3 years. I noticed it when I first tried to package sympow for Gentoo as part of my sage porting drive. At the time I had to allow the directory where the sympow scripts are installed to be world writable....

That no one really noticed means that no one using a global sage install has been using sympow for their work. The only people using it must have used a private installation. We now have a fix for this problem in sage-on-gentoo, Christopher, the other sage-on-gentoo dev, has figured a way of getting sympow to write in $HOME/.sympow in the last month or so.

I think there is a case for trying to replace sympow. It seems like the original author has abandoned it - the sympow homepage has gone. Sage could become sympow
upstream. But given the quality of the code there is a high burden for maintenance. It probably would be more beneficial in the long run to rewrite the functionality altogether. Given that there are references I think it could be a nice student project. 

That's my opinion.

SYMPOW makes use of the [Quad Double](http://crd.lbl.gov/~dhbailey/mpdist/) code which relies on IEE-754 double-precision maths, with a 53-bit mantissa and 64-bits in total. However, the default mode of the x86 CPUs is to use extended precision where 64-bits are used for the mantissa and 80 bits in total. It is necessary to change the mode of operation of the floating point processor in order that the Quad double code will work at all.

I now have a better understanding of why SYMPOW is failing to work correctly on Cygwin and Solaris on x86 chips. SYMPOW makes use of the [Quad Double](http://crd.lbl.gov/~dhbailey/mpdist/) code which relies on IEE-754 double-precision maths, with a 53-bit mantissa and 64-bits in total. However, the default mode of the x86 CPUs is to use extended precision where 64-bits are used for the mantissa and 80 bits in total. It is necessary to change the mode of operation of the floating point processor in order that the Quad double code will work at all. SYMPOW had code for this in a file fpu.c, but it only worked on Linux. It made use of Linux-specific header files too. 

The main change necessary was to add some inline assembly code to alter the values of bits 8 and 9 in the 16-bit control register of the floating point processor. I got the relevant information about the exact bits needed from an old (1987) copy of the Intel 80387 Programmer's Reference Manual. 

Here's a revised package which builds and passes all relevant tests on 
* OpenSolaris (32-bit) on x64 
* Linux (64-bit)
* OS X (64-bit)
* Solaris 10 (32-bit) SPARC

It was not possible to test on Solaris 10 x86, as access to the Skynet machines is currently unavailable, but I do not believe ll present any problems, since it builds fine on OpenSolaris as a 32-bit application. 

http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/patches/sympow-1.018.1.p8.spkg

Apart from a couple of minor changes, it is the same code which Mike Hansen tested on Cygwin and said it works there too.

If #9722 is ready to merge soon and this ticket is also positively reviewed, I'll consider including this in a 4.5.3.alpha2.

Thank you. That would be great. That should give all doc tests passing on Solaris 10 x86, OpenSolaris and Solaris 10 SPARC. 

I just need someone to change it to positive. I think I've provided quite a bit of evidence that it passes the tests on every platform I can test on.

Maybe the attached program might be useful.  It runs a simple computation to check whether or not the FPU is 53-bit or more.  For example, on a x86_64 Intel machine, I get:

```
gcc -mfpmath=387 testfpu.c -o testfpu && ./testfpu 134217728 134217728
a = 134217728, b = 134217728
result = 1
```

```
gcc -mfpmath=sse testfpu.c -o testfpu && ./testfpu 134217728 134217728
a = 134217728, b = 134217728
result = 0
```

```
gcc -mfpmath=387 -mpc64 testfpu.c -o testfpu && ./testfpu 134217728 134217728
a = 134217728, b = 134217728
result = 0
```

You could use to check

Note the SPARC that Jeroen used (a Sun Blade 1000 belonging to me), was not the same as as I used, which was the Sun T5240 (t2.,math). 

So that's confirmation on two different Sun systems. One running the 2005 release of Solaris 10, the other running a much more recent release.

It doesn't.  I just added those options to show how the behaviour changes.  My idea would be to run testfpu.c without any options and check the result.

I believe that my program is a cleaner solution. For example, are you sure you don't need the patch on Darwin? Also, the following code looks very suspicious:

```
for machine_hardware in ix86 i386 i486 i586 i686 x86_64 i86pc ia64

The:

 
`for machine_hardware in ix86 i386 i486 i586 i686 x86_64 i86pc ia64`

was there before - I only added `i86pc` and changed `x` to `machine_hardware`, as I thought it was a bit more informative. 

The fpu patch has never been applied on OS X - note the original code specifically checked the platform was Linux. But since the C code used Linux-specific header files, I could not simply apply it everywhere. 

Given SYMPOW is going to be withdrawn from Sage since it's poorly written and unmaintained, I think this is enough. You may notice today that Bill said on `sage-devel` that the author has made it clear he has no desire to maintain this package, as it works on his computer. 

I really want to avoid adding things to this code, since no matter what I do, it is still going to be very poor. This solves the only remaining Solaris x86 problem and is one less problem for the Cygwin port.

I'm testing

on bsd, redhawk, sage, and t2.math.

The patch looks good to me, except that I'm not qualified to review the new `fpu.c`.  But apart from that, I think we have a positive review.

Jeroen, can you comment on `fpu.c`?  Alternatively, David, could you find someone to review this file?

It should be possible, but you should wait for confirmation from Mike Hansen.

Mike confirmed the earlier version I wrote had worked on Cygwin and passed all tests. However, I had did make a small change since then. 

The change was only the way I wrote the numbers in fpu.c. Initially I wrote them as binary using `0b` in front of the 0's and 1's. Later I converted the two binary numbers to hex, so used `0x}} instead. I found using {{{0b` is not portable - it works with gcc, but not Sun Studio. 

So the only changes from the patch that Mike said worked were

* Convert numbers from binary to hex form. 
* Add a few more comments in SPKG.txt and/or fpu.c
* Committed the changes to the repository.

I've asked on sage-devel if someone can comment on it. I suspect Jeroen can. Here's the 

[original fpu.c](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/patches/sympow-1.018.1.p8/src/fpu.c)

and here's the changed version

[patched fpu.c](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/patches/sympow-1.018.1.p8/patches/fpu.c) 

One obvious difference is the original code just writes a number to the control word, but I first read the control word, set two bits, then write the control word. 

The reason I did that was that one of the bits in that control word is reserved  by Intel, so I did not think it wise to write a number to the register directly. 

Having carefully read the documentation that comes with the later version of quad-double, the only changes that should be made to that code is the precision control bits, which is all I change.
