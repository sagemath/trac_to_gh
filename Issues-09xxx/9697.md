Beware, this is my first spkg. I removed the offending file, modified SPKG.txt, and the mercurial log. I then made the spkg using sage _5.0_ as this is the last version I have running on my system. It looks like sage-spkg has not been changed since, so that should not be a problem.

The spkg was created correctly, as far as I can tell.  You even added the tag!

This just needs formal testing on a couple machines to make sure something weird didn't accidentally happen, but looks good.
