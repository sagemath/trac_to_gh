 == The problems ==

There were three things wrong with the Singular package, the last of which can cause build failures. 

* The ability to build 64-bit was restricted to the OS X operating system, as the -m64 flag was only added if both SAGE64 was set to "yes" and the operating system was OS X with the following line of code.
* The package version was unconventional, with people sometimes updating a date, rather than incrementing the patch level as is standard Sage practice - see the developers guide at http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/patching_spkgs.html#overview-of-patching-spkg-s 
* The time stamp of the file `src/Singular/libparse.cc` was one second older than the file it was supposed to be created from ( `src/Singular/libparse.l`), so the build process was trying to use 'flex' to update `src/Singular/libparse.cc`, which fails if flex is not available. 

```
make install in Singular
make[4]: Entering directory `/export/home/drkirkby/32/sage-4.4.3/spkg/build/singular-3-1-0-4-20100214/src/Singular'
sh flexer.sh -I -Pyylp -t libparse.l >libparse.cc.lmp
flexer.sh: flex: not found
flexer.sh: test: argument expected
make[4]: *** [libparse.cc] Error 1 
```
 See http://groups.google.co.uk/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/fbf5b7f781c3f523?hl=en for a discussion of this. 

 == The solutions ==
Three very minor changes are made. 
* The following

```
   if [ `uname` = "Darwin" -a "$SAGE64" = "yes" ]; then
```

 was changed to 

```
   if [ "x$SAGE64" = xyes ]; then
```

 to enable 64-bit builds on any platform when SAGE64 is set to "yes".

* The time stamp of the file `src/Singular/libparse.cc` made the current time with:

```
touch src/Singular/libparse.cc
``` 

* The package name was set in according with the Sage Developers Guide. Had this been done properly, it would be patch level 6, so the package was named singular-3.1.0.4.p6. 

 == Why a blocker ? ==
The incorrect time stamp has caused build failures on Solaris and could cause them on other platforms too. 

I'm not going to report this upstream, as its not a current version of Singular. It will need someone with more knowledge to update the version of Singular.

Funny, on Linux the Singular (sub-)packages are configured with `--without-lex --without-bison` (though I have flex and bison, with aliases "lex" and "yacc", installed).
And `install.log` contains

```
configure: warning: building without lex -- make might fail
checking for bison... (cached) bison
```

The patches look ok to me, I'll test them and the new spkg soon - but only on a Linux box...

The more I look at this, the more I think the Singular package as a whole is seriously screwed up. 

You might notice in SPKG.txt my comment that there are 5-copies of `install-sh` in the package. Clearly someone was not short of disk space! 

As you say, Singular is configured with `-without-lex --without-bison`, but there appears to be no such options to the configure script, as 

```
$ configure --help | grep bison
```

produces no output - same with lex. So I suspect those options are doing nothing at all. 

I've tested the new spkg on a Solaris box which **does** have flex in the path. In which case I see:

```
sh flexer.sh -I -Pyylp -t libparse.l >libparse.cc.lmp
cp libparse.cc.lmp libparse.cc
```

So the revised package works on Solaris 10 SPARC machines both with and without flex in the path. The two machines are:

* Sun Blade 1000, Solaris 10 03/2005 (the first release of Solaris 10), 2 GB RAM, dual 900 MHz UltraSPARC III+ 64-bit processors, **with flex** in the path.
* Sun Blade 2000, Solaris 10 10/2009 (the latest update of Solaris 10), 8 GB RAM, dual 1.2 GHz UltraSPARC III+ 64-bit processors, **without flex** in the path.

Hardware wise these machines are quite similar (the motherboards are interchangeable), but one has the oldest and one the latest release of Solaris 10. So I think this is a fair test that the changes are a reasonable hack to get a **very** poor package to work.

I've just downloaded the latest source code (3.1.1) and discovered the Singular code still looks a complete mess 
* Multiple copies of install-sh etc
* ` make distclean` clears nothing useful. 
* ` make check` or ` make test` has no test procedures. 
* ...etc etc. 

So updating it unlikely to be very productive - just give us another set of problems to resolve. 
(It makes me wonder how much I could trust the results from such code).

I think further improvements to the Singular package should be made on another ticket (cf. sage-devel thread ["Is flex needed to build Sage"](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/fbf5b7f781c3f523#)).

Built Sage 4.4.3 with the updated spkg from scratch on a 32-bit Linux; all doctests passed (see sage-release).
I though have some minor changes to `SPKG.txt` (typo) and `spkg-install` I'll upload later (i.e. I haven't prepared a patch yet).

After passing other sanity checks I've not yet done I'll give it a positive review; 4.4.4.alpha0 is out now though, but I hope it will make it into alpha1.

I could remake it and touch 'factory/configure' but this does not seem be causing any build problems. As you remarked above, other issues with this package need another ticket. 

I get the feeling this release is going to be made quite soon. See Mike Hansen's comment when he announced the alpha0.

*Sage 4.4.4.alpha0 has been released.  With the exception of a few more patches, I think this should be pretty close to final.*

so I'd rather not try to solve too much in this Singular package, and let the ticket drag on. You know I feel the complete package needs work.

**Yes**, just to avoid the annoying message (as mentioned, it actually differs only by one second).

We should get another dumb message if bison is not installed (in contrast to flex, where `--without-lex` in fact only triggers "... make *might* fail").

A few more...

I'll try to hurry.

Btw, in `spkg-install`: `s/create create/create/` (the typo I mentioned, **not** in `SPKG.txt`)

OK, I've made some changes. I hope these are ok with you. 

* Changed the timestamp on the configure script with 'touch'
* Moved all the 'export' commands to one place - it seemed a bit pointless exporting LDFLAGS and DYNAMIC_KERNEL from inside the SAGE64 code, whereas others were exported multiple times on other lines. Now all variables are exported once, and only once and done in one place. 
* Changed $RM to 'rm', $CHMOD to 'chmod' etc. I've done quite a few of these in the past, as it makes the code easier to read. 
* The 'SAGE64' test was actually inside an 'else' part of `if [ $SAGE_DEBUG = 1 ] ; then ` bit of code, so would have not been executed had someone set SAGE_DEBUG to 1. As such it would have been impossible to debug the code in 64-bit mode on systems where SAGE64 needed to be set. The SAGE64 test is now done irrespective of whether debugging or not. 
* Ensured $SAGE_LOCAL/include is the first CPPFLAG, so the Sage include files are loaded before others. A failure to do this was causing some old headers on Solaris to be included, instead of the newer ones in Sage. (The same is happening with mathplotlib I believe)
* Removed "-O2 -g -m64" from CPPFLAGS, as these should not be passed to the pre-processor, but the compiler. They should go into CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS, not CPPFLAGS. 
* I did **not** change DYNAMIC_KERNEL to be only used on OS X (Darwin), as the Singular documentation specifically says this should be used on Solaris. 

I've tested on Solaris 32-bit (SPARC) on several systems, Linux and OS X - all work fine. It does not work fully on OpenSolaris x64, as the CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS are not getting passed every time the compiler is invoked - there are about 6 cases where the flag does not get passed. This needs to be resolved at a later date. 

Hopefully the package is a bit cleaner now. It's still a mess, but it's a start to a cleaner build system. 

The updated package is in the original place - http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/patches/singular-3.1.0.4.p6.spkg An updated patch file is attached to the ticket.

Test results are below for one Solaris system, one Linux system and one OS X system.

The more I look at it, the more things don't make sense to me... :(

I would have been happy if you only fixed the *"Solaris doesn't work with dynamic kernel"* issue, but see below...

Replying to [@sagetrac-drkirkby](#comment:13):
> OK, I've made some changes. I hope these are ok with you.
> 

 
> * Changed the timestamp on the configure script with 'touch'

Ok. (The comment in `SPKG.txt` though mentions `factory/configure`, not `src/factory/configure`.)


>    * Moved all the 'export' commands to one place - it seemed a bit pointless exporting LDFLAGS and DYNAMIC_KERNEL from inside the SAGE64 code, whereas others were exported multiple times on other lines. Now all variables are exported once, and only once and done in one place.

I do not really agree.
* `DYNAMIC_KERNEL` is **only** used in `spkg-install`, so we actually **don't** have to **export it at all**.
* There is a difference between *exporting empty* variables and *not exporting* them, so in general variables should only be exported when necessary.
 

> * Changed $RM to 'rm', $CHMOD to 'chmod' etc. I've done quite a few of these in the past, as it makes the code easier to read.

I don't agree either. This inhibits redefining them on ill or ill-configured systems. (Nor can I see it being easier to read.) They are all defined in `sage-env` (if not overridden by the user), so we can rely on them.


> * The 'SAGE64' test was actually inside an 'else' part of `if [ $SAGE_DEBUG = 1 ] ; then ` bit of code, so would have not been executed had someone set SAGE_DEBUG to 1. As such it would have been impossible to debug the code in 64-bit mode on systems where SAGE64 needed to be set. The SAGE64 test is now done irrespective of whether debugging or not.

Ok, though `SAGE_DEBUG` is set to zero in the same file.


> * Ensured $SAGE_LOCAL/include is the first CPPFLAG, so the Sage include files are loaded before others. A failure to do this was causing some old headers on Solaris to be included, instead of the newer ones in Sage. (The same is happening with mathplotlib I believe)

Ok. (This should usually be achievable by some `configure` option.)


>    * Removed "-O2 -g -m64" from CPPFLAGS, as these should not be passed to the pre-processor, but the compiler. They should go into CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS, not CPPFLAGS.

In general, at least `-m64` **is required** for the preprocessor, too (optimization flags etc. *might* as well be used by it).


> * I did **not** change DYNAMIC_KERNEL to be only used on OS X (Darwin), as the Singular documentation specifically says this should be used on Solaris.

Well, setting it for Darwin was already redundant, so Solaris actually does **not** need it either (and remember it previously worked on e.g. t2.math):

```
# disable the dynamic kernel, except on Linux
if [ "$UNAME" = "Linux" ]; then
     DYNAMIC_KERNEL=""
else
     DYNAMIC_KERNEL="--without-dynamic-kernel"
fi
```
(This otherwise shouldn't depend on `SAGE64`, because it is not directly related.)
Perhaps we should add a comment to `SPKG.txt` that it is currently disabled on **all** systems but Linux, which especially includes MacOS/Darwin and Solaris.


> I've tested on Solaris 32-bit (SPARC) on several systems, Linux and OS X - all work fine. It does not work fully on OpenSolaris x64, as the CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS are not getting passed every time the compiler is invoked - there are about 6 cases where the flag does not get passed. This needs to be resolved at a later date. 
> 
> Hopefully the package is a bit cleaner now. It's still a mess, but it's a start to a cleaner build system. 

> The updated package is in the original place - http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/patches/singular-3.1.0.4.p6.spkg An updated patch file is attached to the ticket.

The second (newer) commit message isn't that nice:

At first glance looks very good to me.

`kirkby@localhost` in the commit message. Never mind.)

Now taking a final look at the new spkg...

P.S.: `-m32`/`-m64` has a major effect on many preprocessor definitions (e.g. `__i386__` vs. `__x86_64__`, and the whole stuff in `stdint.h` etc., i.e. `SIZEOF_LONG` and the like.).

I never thought about what -m64 would do to the preprocessor and sizeof(long). I can see you have a point there. They say one  learns something every day.

(Ubuntu 9.04 32-bit/Pentium4, new spkg installed on Sage 4.4.4.alpha0)

I'm currently too tired to upload a reviewer patch adding more comments to `SPKG.txt` and perhaps `spkg-install`; it should perhaps also contain a link to the sage-devel thread ["Is flex needed to build Sage?"](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/fbf5b7f781c3f523#) which has further suggestions.

We could also update the ticket description to briefly reflect the outcome.

I.e., the package there is currently up-to-date, based on our latest p6.
