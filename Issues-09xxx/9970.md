This test in `src/sage/interfaces/r.py` should be fixed:

```
            sage: os.path.realpath(tmpdir) == sageobj(r.getwd())  # known bug (:trac:`9970`)
            True
```

The script

```python
import os
import tempfile

fail = 0
for i in xrange(1000):
    tmpdir = tempfile.mkdtemp()
    r.chdir(tmpdir)
    if tmpdir not in sageobj(r.getwd()):
        print tmpdir, r.getwd(), sageobj(r.getwd())
        fail += 1
    os.rmdir(tmpdir)  # clean up

print fail
```

That's very interesting, thanks for pointing it out.  Since the `r.chdir()` is a pretty recent addition, it's not surprising there are unusual bugs with this.  I get the same behavior on Mac OS X 10.4, so this is not platform dependent, unsurprisingly.

 I am wondering whether it is simply that the directory names are preparsed or something with all those `Integer` things - maybe these 13-20 out of 1000 are the ones that have numeric characters in the alphanumeric string?.  Though `/tmp/tmp0Py04L` only has the `04` in `Integer`, not the first `0`.  Also, I get

```

/tmp/tmpZig4LH [1] "/private/tmp/tmpZig4LH" /private/tmp/tmpZigInteger(4)H
```
in printing out the first ones until I get a failure (change the `if` loop to a `while` loop, basically), and a second time

```
/tmp/tmp2Ny1fm [1] "/private/tmp/tmp2Ny1fm" /private/tmp/tmp2Ny1fm

so that can't be the issue, at least not by itself.  The position of the integer seems irrelevant as well.

Hah!  You got it nailed - 

```
/tmp/tmp3Vd1Lg [1] "/private/tmp/tmp3Vd1Lg" /private/tmp/tmp3VdInteger(1)g
```
the `1L` becomes `Integer(1)`.  And all of them do that.  

So it thinks we have a 'long integer' when in fact it's just a random directory.  I think maybe this is a problem in R itself, in `setwd`?

You're probably right.  I was just following up on your observation about long integers with an experiment.

How about

```python
sage: '"%s"' % os.path.realpath(tmpdir) == r.eval('dput(%s)' % r.getwd().name())
True
```
?  Can we simplify this?

I will eventually look at this, but because it's a rather harmless doctest failure (even though we really don't like doctest failures) I won't be able to check it out very quickly.  

I'm also putting your request from sage-devel here for reference as to what you think is needed for review - thanks!

```
If somebody more familiar with the R language and interface could take a look 
if the string-related corner cases work, and if it didn't break anything 
non-string-related (and maybe add some more doctests to the _sage_ method), 
that would be great.

OK, then the ticket status should probably reverted (it has been "needs work").

In any case, it seems that #12876 needs this change to make the doctest failure vanish. I suggest that a "todo" is added, referring to this ticket, stating that the doctest fix from #12876 is not a fix of the underlying problem, which is dealt with here.

Are you sure, because I don't see what #12876 has to do with either the conversion from R to Sage or with filesystem paths.

Well, at least it used to need it. If I recall correctly, at the time when I created the first version of this patch, we got a consistent error in the test, and with the patch the error consistently vanished.

However, as I've learned today, the tests also pass without this patch. So, we should drop it.
