This test in `src/sage/interfaces/r.py` should be fixed:

```
            sage: os.path.realpath(tmpdir) == sageobj(r.getwd())  # known bug (:trac:`9970`)
            True
```

The script

```python
import os
import tempfile

fail = 0
for i in xrange(1000):
    tmpdir = tempfile.mkdtemp()
    r.chdir(tmpdir)
    if tmpdir not in sageobj(r.getwd()):
        print tmpdir, r.getwd(), sageobj(r.getwd())
        fail += 1
    os.rmdir(tmpdir)  # clean up

print fail
```
prints

Using `str` instead of `sageobj` seems to work.  Of course, that doesn't explain the behavior of `sageobj` here.

Aside: Would we avoid the platform-dependent `/private` prefix with `sage.misc.misc.tmp_dir`?  The `sage-cleaner` would later delete the directory.

No, it seems to be a different problem with the same doctest.

You're probably right.  I was just following up on your observation about long integers with an experiment.

How about

```python
sage: '"%s"' % os.path.realpath(tmpdir) == r.eval('dput(%s)' % r.getwd().name())
True
```
?  Can we simplify this?

I will eventually look at this, but because it's a rather harmless doctest failure (even though we really don't like doctest failures) I won't be able to check it out very quickly.  

I'm also putting your request from sage-devel here for reference as to what you think is needed for review - thanks!

```
If somebody more familiar with the R language and interface could take a look 
if the string-related corner cases work, and if it didn't break anything 
non-string-related (and maybe add some more doctests to the _sage_ method), 
that would be great.

By #12415, a remark was added in r.py, pointing to this ticket:

```
            sage: os.path.realpath(tmpdir) == sageobj(r.getwd())  # known bug (:trac:`9970`)
            True
```

Note that in #12876, Nicolas changes the test by inserting os.path.realpath on the right side as well, hence:

```
            sage: os.path.realpath(tmpdir) == os.path.realpath(sageobj(r.getwd()))
            True
```

I don't know if this test is all what this ticket is about. So, please decide yourself if this ticket became a duplicate (or actually a sub-problem) of #12876

OK, then the ticket status should probably reverted (it has been "needs work").

In any case, it seems that #12876 needs this change to make the doctest failure vanish. I suggest that a "todo" is added, referring to this ticket, stating that the doctest fix from #12876 is not a fix of the underlying problem, which is dealt with here.

Well, at least it used to need it. If I recall correctly, at the time when I created the first version of this patch, we got a consistent error in the test, and with the patch the error consistently vanished.

However, as I've learned today, the tests also pass without this patch. So, we should drop it.

As of Sage 8.5 I no longer get errors from the script above, so presumably "known bug" can be removed.

However, `r.chdir` and `os.chdir` now do the same thing, i.e. the current directory for R and Sage is the same, which suggests to me that this function should be deprecated entirely. Unless it is desirable to be able to set different directories, in which case this has to be reimplemented.
