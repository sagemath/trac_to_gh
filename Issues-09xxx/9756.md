If the environment variable `SAGE_TUNE_pari` is exported to "yes", PARI will go through a tuning process to optimize the code for a particular computer. This takes considerable time, so the default behavior is not to tune PARI. 

This is implemented in a PARI snapshot (see #9343), but is not documented.  In particular, it depends on #9343.

It meanwhile does so.

I still prefer following the convention that [exported] environment variables should be all uppercase (i.e. `SAGE_TUNE_PARI`), and am currently supporting that (in addition) in a new PARI 2.4.3.svn-12577.p5 spkg.

I think it was Peter Jeremey that proposed the lower case, and showed some code how one could get it inside an arbitrary package (say ATLAS) from the package name. (This was in relation to the number of threads ATLAS uses). 

I don't have a big problem with upper or lower case, though I think there's an argument for making the global ones that affect every package upper case, and appending lower case for those that only affect a single package. But it's hardly a big deal either way.

Ever heard of `tr`? ;-)

> I don't have a big problem with upper or lower case, though I think there's an argument for making the global ones that affect every package upper case, and appending lower case for those that only affect a single package.


Doesn't make sense to me (unless we accept *both* lower as well as uppercase, which IMHO isn't a good idea either).

> But it's hardly a big deal either way. 


It isn't, but we shouldn't produce too much confusion, neither to the developers nor to the users.
Keeping it all uppercase is in my opinion the (conformant and) least annoying choice.

Otherwise we'd also run into problems with "PARI" vs. "pari", "NTL" vs. "ntl", "PolyBoRi" vs. "POLYBORI" vs. "polybori" etc. I think.

And perhaps `SAGE_TUNE="package1 package2 ..."` (with of course only the package's basename), perhaps also `SAGE_TUNE=all`, `SAGE_TUNE=default`, `SAGE_TUNE=no`, with some handling / "normalization" in `sage-spkg`, s.t. not every potential `spkg-install` has to deal with lots of different cases.

Similar extensions to `SAGE_CHECK[_*]` may be desirable.

There have been a number of complaints about the growing number of environment variables. They are not popular!

That said, I personally think these sort of things are desirable. For example, when I asked people to run the Python tests, there's not been a single person who reported they could get all the Python tests to pass. So running SAGE_CHECK will always fail. 

I personally think having those that are for specific packages end in lower case does make them more obvious. All packages are listed in lower case in Sage, so ATLAS is atlas, PolyBoRi is polybori etc.
