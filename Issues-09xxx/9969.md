The patch adds fast Cython version of some more mpmath functions to sage.libs.mpmath.

This ticket contains a new spkg for mpmath-0.17 and two patches
that need to be applied to sage itself. First mpmath_update_fixed_4.6.1.patch, then truediv_fix.patch.

It can be tested with:

```
sage: import mpmath
sage: mpmath.runtests()
sage: mpmath.doctests()
```
New SPKG: [http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/mpmath-0.17.spkg](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/mpmath-0.17.spkg)

Apply:
* [attachment:mpmath_update_fixed_4.6.1.patch]
* [attachment:truediv_fix.patch]

**Resolution:** fixed

**Author:** Fredrik Johansson

**Reviewer:** François Bissey

**Merged:** sage-4.7.alpha5

REPORT:

* All tests passon sage.math.

*  Your code needs "::\n\n" before any sage sessions for sphinx to format it right.
See the template here and note rightafterwords: http://sagemath.blogspot.com/
right now if somebody introspects one of your functions in the notebook, sphinx will butcher it.

* You define "isqrt" but sage integers already have an isqrt method that is exactly the same.  Clarify in the documentation the distinction.

Bug me again by email or chat when you've posted another patch (or patch on top of the above) that fixes the above two little things.

Good to know, that means I won't have to change anything to support mpmath-0.17 in sage-on-gentoo when 4.6.2 is released.

Hmm... it doesn't seem like mpmath installed correctly for you.

Is "/usr/lib64/python2.6/site-packages" actually the location of your Sage site-packages library, or is this a standalone installation of mpmath 0.17?

Something I have noticed in the gentoo ebuild. There is now an option to use matplotlib. Since matplotlib is shipped in sage mpmath may have to depend on it or configured not to use it.

Usually people choose the first option in this case, unless there is major trouble. If you want to do that, the deps file in spkg/standard will need to be updated.

On further inspection this test is run because matplotlib is present and I assume that this message originates from matplotlib. So the problem is probably in matplotlib.

The last thing is whether we make matplotlib a dependency of mpmath or not.
I will post a patch making this the default. Voice any opposition then.
