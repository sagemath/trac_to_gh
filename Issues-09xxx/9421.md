Consider

```
sage: var('t')
sage: x=function('x',t)
sage: var('c')
sage: desolve(diff(x,t)+2*x==t^2-2*t+c,x,ivar=t).expand()
c*e^(-2*t) + 1/2*t^2 + 1/2*c - 3/2*t + 3/4
```
Here the first occurrence of `c` is an integration constant,
whereas the second one is the parameter in the ODE:

```
sage: var('d')
sage: desolve(diff(x,t)+2*x==t^2-2*t+d,x,ivar=t).expand()
c*e^(-2*t) + 1/2*t^2 + 1/2*d - 3/2*t + 3/4
```
In case the ODE contains `c`, desolve should choose another
name for the integration constant.

You might want to consider this one too:

```
sage: desolve(diff(f(x),x,x)-f(x),f(x))
k2*e^(-x) + k1*e^x
```
We can recognize the variables as distinct before they are converted from maxima:

```
sage: function('f',x)
f(x)
sage: var('c')
c
sage: V=diff(f(x),x)-f(x)+c
sage: v=maxima_calculus(V)
sage: v.ode2(f(x),x)
'f(x)=(c*%e^-x+%c)*%e^x
sage: v.ode2(f(x),x).ecl()
<ECL: ((MEQUAL SIMP) ((%F SIMP) $X)
 ((MTIMES SIMP)
  ((MPLUS SIMP) $%C
   ((MTIMES SIMP) $C ((MEXPT SIMP) $%E ((MTIMES SIMP) -1 $X))))
  ((MEXPT SIMP) $%E $X)))>
```
so perhaps the right solution is to warn when sage's "forget the %" causes a name collision (with the righter solution being: making sage's "forget the %" more intelligent, so that collisions can be avoided)
