## Build environment
* Sun Ultra 27 3.33 GHz Intel W3580 Xeon. Quad core. 8 threads. 12 GB RAM
* OpenSolaris 2009.06 snv_134 X86
* Sage 4.4.2
* gcc 4.4.4

## How gcc 4.4.4 was configured
Since the configuration of gcc is fairly critical on OpenSolaris, here's how it was built. 

```
drkirkby@hawk:~/sage-4.4.2$ gcc -v
Using built-in specs.
Target: i386-pc-solaris2.11
Configured with: ../gcc-4.4.4/configure --prefix=/usr/local/gcc-4.4.4 --with-as=/usr/local/binutils-2.20/bin/as --with-ld=/usr/ccs/bin/ld --with-gmp=/usr/local --with-mpfr=/usr/local
Thread model: posix
gcc version 4.4.4 (GCC) 
```

gcc 4.3.4 was failing to build iconv. 

## How the Sage build was attempted
* 64-bit build. SAGE64 was set to "yes"
* #9008 update zlib to latest upstream release to allow a 64-bit library to be built. 
* #9009 update mercurial spkg to build 64-bit.
* #7982 update sage_fortran so it can build 64-bit binaries.
* Run 'make -k' so make did not stop on errors, so errors can be listed.

I will try to build R outside of Sage next.

<div id="comment:3" align="right">comment:3</div>

This might be difficult to solve. 

1) The R manual 

http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-admin.html#Solaris

makes it clear that R has never been successfully built with gcc on OpenSolaris, though it can be built with Sun Studio. I'd prefer not to need to have both compilers installed, but it may be the only option, as there are too many GNUisms to get Sage to build all with Sun Studio. 

2) If the particular error message occurs with Sun Studio, 

http://developers.sun.com/solaris/articles/about_amd64_abi.html

suggests using the Sun Studio option '-Kpic' to build Position Independent Code (PIC) code. 

Since the R package appears to use '-fpic' with gcc, which generates PIC code, generating PIC code does not appear to be working with gcc. (However, normally one uses -fPIC, which is slightly different.) 

So I'm not sure how to solve this. Maybe making Sun Studio (which is free) a prequisite is the only sensible option on OpenSolaris on x64 hardware.

This also seems like an issue on Solaris on x64 (not just OpenSolaris).  At least, I can't build R on fulvia, and I get a similar error message.

You do not surprise me there. Page 49 of the [R Installation and Administration Guide](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-admin.pdf) says in the section on Solaris:

*Tests with gcc4 on x86 and amd64 have been less successful: x86 builds have failed on tests using complex arithmetic, whereas on amd64 the builds have failed to complete in several different ways, most recently with relocation errors for libRblas.so* I'm not sure if R is built with the -fPIC option, but if not, that is likely to be the cause of relocation errors. I finally convinced the Pari developers that one should use -fPIC on shared libraries. 

Since R runs as a stand-alone program, building with the recommended Sun compilers should not cause any linking problems. 

It means one needs to have two sets of compilers installed, which is a bit annoying, but there may be no way around it. I guess if we had a patch that worked with gcc, we could submit that to the R developers. I thought I'd worry about the R issue when the rest of Sage was building on this hardware, since R is not a critical component to getting something working. 

An older version of the Sun compilers is installed on 't2' in the directory `/opt/SUNWspro`. The C compiler is `/opt/SUNWspro/bin/cc` and the C++ compiler is `/opt/SUNWspro/bin/CC`.

I know more about this problem than was on the ticket. The shared libraries generated by R have non-PIC code in them. This is easy to prove, as detailed here

http://blogs.sun.com/rie/entry/my_relocations_don_t_fit

basically running

```
$ elfdump -d library | grep TEXTREL
```

should produce no output, but it does in the case of the three R libraries 

```
drkirkby@hawk:~/sage-4.6.2.rc1/local/lib/R/lib$ elfdump -d libR.so | fgrep TEXTREL 
      [25]  TEXTREL           0                   
      [34]  FLAGS             0x4                 [ TEXTREL ]
drkirkby@hawk:~/sage-4.6.2.rc1/local/lib/R/lib$ elfdump -d libRblas.so | fgrep TEXTREL 
      [19]  TEXTREL           0                   
      [28]  FLAGS             0x4                 [ TEXTREL ]

Sure, though I don't think it will help much. See attached file r-2.10.1.p4-Failed-on-Sage-4.6.2.rc1_OpenSolaris-64-bit.log.bz2 The file that is probably causing the problem is `eval.c`. 

The software system is slightly different to that in the description - both gcc and Sage have been updated, though the hardware is the same. 

* Sun Ultra 27 
* 3.33 GHz Intel W3580 Xeon. Quad core. 8 threads. 
* 12 GB RAM
* OpenSolaris 2009.06 snv_134 X86
* Sage 4.6.2.rc1 (which is exactly the same as Sage 4.6.2 I gather)
* gcc 4.5.0

If I compile with:

```
LD_OPTIONS=-Dreloc,detail
```

as suggested in that Sun blog, then the output will be several hundred MB. (If you want to see it, then it would be easier if I created you an account on this machine) or you tried on t2.math (I assume you have an account, if not I can create you one). But t2.math is desperately slow. 

I'm told on the R developers list that defining `NO_THREADED_CODE` will stop the use of the gcc extensions. Hopefully that will allow the library to build properly. I'm not sure of what negative impacts it will have.

Oh dear, I stumbled on something quite similar while compiling my own fortran code on amd64 for the first time last month. The key point that sends my bells ringing is this

```
relocation error: R_AMD64_PC32
```
I think you should totally try the -mcmodel option in C{XX}FLAGS:

```
`-mcmodel=small'
     Generate code for the small code model: the program and its
     symbols must be linked in the lower 2 GB of the address space.
     Pointers are 64 bits.  Programs can be statically or dynamically
     linked.  This is the default code model.

`-mcmodel=kernel'
     Generate code for the kernel code model.  The kernel runs in the
     negative 2 GB of the address space.  This model has to be used for
     Linux kernel code.

`-mcmodel=medium'
     Generate code for the medium model: The program is linked in the
     lower 2 GB of the address space.  Small symbols are also placed
     there.  Symbols with sizes larger than `-mlarge-data-threshold'
     are put into large data or bss sections and can be located above
     2GB.  Programs can be statically or dynamically linked.

`-mcmodel=large'
     Generate code for the large model: This model makes no assumptions
     about addresses and sizes of sections.
```
medium would probably work, if it doesn't try large.

This does not help. Medium causes no change in behavior, whereas 'large;' causes an early exit with a message about longs were expected to be 4 bytes, not 8. (But since I'm building 64-bit, longs are 8 bytes). Whereas normally without either of those options, 5 shared libraries get built in R, this reduces to two if `-mcmodel=large`. 

I think the key to this is 

http://blogs.sun.com/rie/entry/my_relocations_don_t_fit

I posted a log with the suggested debugging option (`LD_OPTIONS=-Dreloc,detail`) to 

http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/r-2.10.1.p4-with-debug-info.log.bz2

I think you will see, its not easy to debug.
