Using the following system: 

* IBM [RS/6000 7025 F50](http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/pseries/v5r3/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.pseries.doc/hardware_docs/rs6000_7025f50series.htm)
* 4 x 332 MHz 32-bit PowerPC CPUs
* 3 GB RAM
* A fair wide mixture of disks sizes (3 x 9 GB, 1 x 18 GB, 2 x 36 GB and 1 x 73 GB)
* DDS-4 tape drive 
* AIX 5.3 (A POSIX certified operating system)
* gcc 4.2.4 downloaded from [pware](http://pware.hvcc.edu/)
* sage-4.6.alpha1


FreeType fails to build, but reports:

```
kby/sage-4.6.alpha1/spkg/build/freetype-2.3.5.p2/src/src/lzw/ftlzw.c
In file included from /home/users/drkirkby/sage-4.6.alpha1/spkg/build/freetype-2.3.5.p2/src/src/gzip/ftgzip.c:45:

/opt/pware/include/zlib.h:1589: error: expected declaration specifiers or '...' before 'off_t'
```

I can't understand why this is using the header files from `/opt/pware/include/` when it should be using the header file from `$SAGE_LOCAL/local/include/zlib.h`
