* AIX 5.3 (A POSIX certified operating system)
* gcc 4.2.4 downloaded from [pware](http://pware.hvcc.edu/)
* sage-4.6.alpha1


FreeType fails to build, but reports:

```

/opt/pware/include/zlib.h:1589: error: expected declaration specifiers or '...' before 'off_t'
```

I can't understand why this is using the header files from `/opt/pware/include/` when it should be using the header file from `$SAGE_LOCAL/local/include/zlib.h`
