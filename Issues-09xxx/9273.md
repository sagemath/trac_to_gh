This has nothing to do with the file `BSD.py`. It is a bug in the doctesting code, which is triggered (as William tells me) by lag times on file systems and the like. It starts testing before the doctesting file is created.

Did you try running the tests again?

I run that test more than once and it failed more than once. 

Note although the machine is rather old (900 MHz CPUs), the disks are local, with a 2 Gbit/s fibre channel interface and 15,000 rpm, so the disk performance is probably better than most modern PCs. If the disks were on a NFS file system, I could perhaps understand that, but it seems unlikely with local disks like this. 

I managed to mess up my build (started a 64-bit build in the same directory as the 32-bit one!), so are rebuilding now. I'll try again once complete.

There is a ticket for "file not found" - see #9316.

The assumption being made on that ticket is that the real cause of the "file not found" message is a timeout. John Cremona says 

*The reason for the timeout was simply that I suspended my laptop for a couple of hours and then woke it up.*

I'm personally not convinced that is the reason this test has failed for me. When BSD.py passes, it does so in around 205 seconds. SAGE_TIMEOUT is set to 1000 seconds and SAGE_TIMEOUT_LONG is set to 10000 seconds. Since the BSD.py test is marked as long, it would need to slow down by a factor of 48 (10000/205) before causing a timeout. My SPARC is quite and old machine and does not go to sleep in the same way some computers do. 

There appears to be another test which is randomly failing in a different way - see #9310. 

I don't know what the cause(s) are but I'm less than convinced this is due to delays on file systems or processors going to sleep. 

I think the ticket should remain open until such time as it gets resolved. Being random in nature, it might not be easy to resolve.
