I run that test more than once and it failed more than once. 

Note although the machine is rather old (900 MHz CPUs), the disks are local, with a 2 Gbit/s fibre channel interface and 15,000 rpm, so the disk performance is probably better than most modern PCs. If the disks were on a NFS file system, I could perhaps understand that, but it seems unlikely with local disks like this. 

I managed to mess up my build (started a 64-bit build in the same directory as the 32-bit one!), so are rebuilding now. I'll try again once complete.

There is a ticket for "file not found" - see #9316.

The assumption being made on that ticket is that the real cause of the "file not found" message is a timeout. John Cremona says 

*The reason for the timeout was simply that I suspended my laptop for a couple of hours and then woke it up.*

I'm personally not convinced that is the reason this test has failed for me. When BSD.py passes, it does so in around 205 seconds. SAGE_TIMEOUT is set to 1000 seconds and SAGE_TIMEOUT_LONG is set to 10000 seconds. Since the BSD.py test is marked as long, it would need to slow down by a factor of 48 (10000/205) before causing a timeout. My SPARC is quite and old machine and does not go to sleep in the same way some computers do. 

There appears to be another test which is randomly failing in a different way - see #9310. 

I don't know what the cause(s) are but I'm less than convinced this is due to delays on file systems or processors going to sleep. 

I think the ticket should remain open until such time as it gets resolved. Being random in nature, it might not be easy to resolve.
