Currently QQ behaves different than a generic number field. This forces number theory functions to treat QQ separately, which is inconvenient.

```
K = QQ
I = K.ideal(7)
```

This creates ideal that does not have the functions I.denominator, I.numerator, I.prime_ideals() ... which a fractional ideal in a number field should have

```
K.<a> = NumberField(x^2+2)
I = K.ideal(7)
```

Similarly, QQ.places() is not implemented; it should return the one infinite place for Q. Although there seems to be QQ.embeddings().

```
QQ.places()
```
