See http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/e05229d90733c78d for an example of how to do CSG (intersections and unions of solid objects) with implicit_plot3d; I think the given example:

```
sage: var('x,y,z')
(x, y, z)
sage: implicit_plot3d(max_symbolic(min_symbolic(x*x+y*y-1, x*x+z*z-2), x-1.8, y-1.8, z-1.8, -x-1.8, -y-1.8, -z-1.8), (x, -2, 2), (y, -2, 2), (z, -2, 2), smooth=False)
```
(along with some explanation) should be added to the implicit_plot3d docstring.

Component: **graphics**

Work Issues: **Very minor doc formatting**

I apologize for not marking the dependency in my comment.

By the way, you could see a version of the plot by adding a viewer='tachyon' keyword argument to the implicit_plot3d call.
