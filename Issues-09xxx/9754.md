This depends on #9720, so first apply the v3 patch from there.  Two routines are added.  One generates matrices (using methods from the v3 patch) whose right and left null spaces, row space, and column space have desirable properties.  The other creates random unimodular matrices.

I was in the process of adding some doctests to be sure the row/column bug was fixed, and also homed in on:

```
if nullity>rows:
    raise ValueError("nullity cannot exceed the number of rows or columns.")
```

since there should be two conditions to check:  rank < nrows,  rank < ncols.

I got mightly confused since I forgot that `nullity()` is the *left* nullity.  Your other routines specify rank as an input, and for consistency I think this one should as well.  Maybe you think nullity as you design the matrix, and that is fine, but inputs and error messages would be clearer if you avoided the distinction between left and right kernels.  (This change in inputs also stopped me once.)

Can you change the input to have `rank=` and adjust tests (doctests and actual error-checks in the code) accordingly?  You can keep your `nullity_generator` in the code, but lets label it as `left_nullity_generator` to make it clear that  rank + nullity  is the number of *rows* not the number of columns.

So there really isn't anything wrong here, but we have a chance to not add further to Sage's left/right, row/column dichotomy/confusion.  It'll be worth the effort.

Here are the doctests I was adding for the `B` matrix of `random_subspaces_matrix()`:

```
        sage: (B.nrows(), B.ncols())
        (6, 8)
        sage: all([x in ZZ for x in A.list()])
        True
```

```
        sage: all([x in ZZ for x in B_expanded.list()])
```

1.  With v5 patch:

```

With `rank=rows` the L matrix is empty (ie no rows), which is an interesting case (and often the source of student questions).  It seems to fail since your routines will not build a matrix in echelon form with no pivots.  Nor will it build an echelonizable matrix with zero rank.

However, both are possible - a matrix with no pivots must be totally zeros.  A matrix of rank zero is totally zeros.  Since you have coded this carefully, I think everything works - if you just let it happen.

Patch shows how to do this.  Apply it to experiment, and read the patch, then pop it off and make the necessary changes yourself if you believe it is OK.  I've only tested this a little bit, so don't presume it has my seal-of-approval.  Adjust error messages and tests.

2.  In 'subspaces" routine near the end.  Do you need to augment B to form N, and then strip out parts of M?  Seems you just produce the identity in the right "half" and then throw it away.  Will the following work?

```
J=K.stack(L)
return J.inverse()*B
```

What you have is clearer, but a comment or two in the source could replace the extra statements.

The v6 patch looks real good - corrects rows/columns bug, fixes up the rank-nullity-confusion, and streamlines the end of the code for the "subspaces" routine (with comments replacing code for explanation).  Works well, passes all tests and docs look good.

I noticed one test in the "echelonizable" routine that talks about "just building a zero matrix" if you need it (I'd added that verbiage earlier).  Its gone in v7, that's the only change.  v7 patch still has Billy's name in it and is the full patch otherwise.

I think this is done, at least I am checking-off on the changes leading to the v6 patch.

Billy - you could/should sign off on the little change to make v7.

David - you can weigh-in further if you like, or not.  If so, we can leave this open for a few days.  If not, we'll wrap this all up.  Thanks so much for all your help and encouragement reviewing Billy's summer project.

Hi David,

No, it needs all the prior patches.  The full chain is:

#9720, #9803, #9802, #9754

each one depends on the previous one in the list, so you'll have to apply three patches to test this one.  But this should be the end (ie you could use these to prepare for class, etc).

Thanks,
Rob

Hi David,

My development version is at 4.5.2 and I think Billy has upgraded to that as well.  So I tested this all on a fresh 4.5.3.rc0.  Applied the four patches below in the order given:

trac_9720-random-echelonizable-matrices-v4.patch

trac_9803-random-matrix-constructor-v2.patch

trac_9802-random-diagonalizable-matrix-v2.patch

trac_9754-random-subspaces-unimodular-matrix-v7.patch

Applies and builds fine, passes all tests in sage/matrix and sage/groups.  I'd be surprised if 4.5.3.alpha0 were much different - almost all the code is just additions into matrix/constructor.py.  But it is critical that the order be right - each patch builds on the previous one.

Do you want to post details if a second attempt has problems?

Thanks,
Rob

Lots of nicely documented examples. Seems like a very useful addition for linear algebra teachers.
