Cliquer used to use SCons, but for various reasons it was replaced by a simple `Makefile`. (IMHO, a good idea, as fighting with SCons seems to be a nightmare). Minh did the replacement, but there is an unnecessary dependency in `spkg/standard/deps`, which potentially means parallel builds are slower than they need be, as currently cliquer can't be built without SCons first being built.
