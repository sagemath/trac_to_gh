Put the text files in `$SAGE_ROOT`, and also the text files in spkg, under revision control.  (See the discussion at the end of #9351.)

Here are the instructions:

---

- apply [attachment: trac_9433-sage-repo.2.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9433/trac_9433-sage-repo.2.patch.gz)
- apply [attachment: trac_9433-scripts.v9.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9433/trac_9433-scripts.v9.patch.gz) to the scripts repository
- move the attached file [attachment: hgignore](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9433/hgignore.gz) to `$SAGE_ROOT/.hgignore` (note that this is a *new* file)
- move the attached file [attachment: root-spkg-install.v4](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9433/root-spkg-install.v4.gz) to `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/root-spkg-install` (note that this is a *new* file)
- apply [attachment: 9433_install.diff](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9433/9433_install.diff.gz) to `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/install`
- apply [attachment: 9433_deps.diff](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9433/9433_deps.diff.gz) to `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/standard/deps`

Then **from $SAGE_ROOT**, run the attached script [attachment: 9433_hg_script.sh](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9433/9433_hg_script.sh.gz) to create the Mercurial repository.

New approach, after a [discussion on sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/t/3ba410046ae641f8): create a new repo at the top level tracking the appropriate files.  I'm attaching a new version of the patch for the scripts repo.  Someone -- the release manager, I guess -- also needs to create the top level repo, because I don't know how to do this in such a way that it can be posted on a ticket.  Here are the instructions:

- move the attached file "hgignore" to SAGE_ROOT/.hgignore
- cd $SAGE_ROOT
- hg init .
- hg add .hgignore COPYING.txt README.txt makefile sage sage-python
- cd spkg
- hg add README.txt gen_html install pipestatus 
- cd standard
- hg add README.txt deps libdist_filelist newest_version
- hg add notes.txt numeric-24.2.txt

(I don't know if we really need these last two files, but this is probably not the ticket for making such decisions.)  Finally, do

- hg commit

When you run "sage -sdist ..." it should add a tag for the new version of Sage.

This does not create a new spkg for the files in SAGE_ROOT, since those files have to be in place when you unpack the sage tar file.  But it creates the repository so that people can post patches to the trac server, etc.

In sage-sdist, where you have `# copy sage root repo over`, why not just clone the repo? That will take care of copying all the necessary files, and if we add or remove files tracked by the repo, we won't need to mess with sage-sdist. I'm thinking that something like

```
cd $SAGE_ROOT 
hg clone --pull . DEST_DIR
```
Using --pull means that it doesn't use hardlinks in the clone; I *think* there would be no problem with using hardlinks, but it's unlikely to make a big difference. The clone will include a hgrc file that points to where it came from: it would look something like this:

```
[paths]
default = /home/foo/sage-whatever
```
We could simply delete the file, or just leave it, since it would not negatively affect anything (except running `hg pull` from SAGE_ROOT, which you wouldn't do anyway).

So, all the `cp -p` lines could be just

```
hg clone --pull . $TMP
rm $TMP/.hg/hgrc
```
and files added or removed to the repo would get copied correctly without changing any scripts.

The missing ipython directory was an oversight.  I think I've fixed it.  The missing sage-README-osx.txt was intentional: this should only be included for binary distributions on OS X, and its presence there is taken care of by sage-bdist:

```
if [ "$UNAME" = "Darwin" ]; then
    ...
    cp sage/local/bin/sage-README-osx.txt README.txt
    ...
```
Perhaps we can close #6938 if this gets merged?

> * An extra SAGE_ROOT/sage-python after unpacking sage-4.5.99.tar.

This was intentional.  Before this, the file sage-python was stored in the scripts repo and then unpacked to the top level.  I'm not sure why this was done, but I wanted to keep the end result as close as possible to what it was before.

As one of the people involved on that ticket, that is fine. The problem is that #6938 does not currently have positive review! So I think that would be necessary first, or something else indicating that the solution proposed there is correct. Maybe 'merge' that ticket at the same time as this one, for whatever it's worth.

Should `sage-README-osx.txt` be ignored (i.e. **not** be under revision control)?

Also a candidate for renaming (`README.MacOS_X.txt` or alike).

From the attached `hg_script`:

```sh
...
$hg add .hgignore .hgtags COPYING.txt README.txt makefile sage sage-python
cd ipython
$hg add *.py ipythonrc*
...
```

`sage-python` and `ipython/` should IMHO be in `.hgignore`, since these are not in `$SAGE_ROOT` until Sage is built.

I don't think adding this needs great effort... We already have `devel/sage/sage/version.py`, which looks like this:

```python
"""nodoctests"""
version='4.6.alpha1'; date='2010-09-15'
```

> > What about release notes (in the top-level directory)?

> That definitely used to be in this directory, filename `HISTORY.txt`.  Maybe it was getting long?  It certainly got out of date quickly.  It might be an onus on the release manager to create the notes *before* the release is made, though

Doesn't have to be under revision control (i.e. could be in `.hgignore`); it IMHO shouldn't be too lengthy, perhaps just contain the most recent changes (e.g. tickets merged since last final, with a reference to a complete version elsewhere).

> - usually that takes a little time, and then it somehow gets added to the official version at sagemath.org (and a few other places?).  The problem is that this isn't fully automated yet.

I think the release notes as in the announcements are meanwhile fully automatically generated by a script. I just wonder if these are really "human"-(means user-)readable, if we intend that.

The hard part is, but at least in theory the "known issues" and "new features" sections and things like that are supposed to be human-generated.  mvngu used to make great categorized ones, but likely hasn't had the time lately.  I think they are more human-readable than some I've seen in other programs, though :)

Also, `test -d foo` is superfluous if you `rm -rf foo`. ("force" also implies not raising an error if the directory doesn't exist.)

There are some quotes missing at the end of `sage-make_devel_packages` (in the newly included part.)

Quoting `$OPT` **currently** works, since it is

```sh
OPT="pPR"
```
but it is a bad idea to omit the dash(es) in `OPT` and prepend it to the expansion.

I.e., it should be

```sh
OPT="-pPR"

...

cp $OPT ... # NOT quoted

...

cp -L $OPT ... # also NOT quoted
```

And I'd suggest renaming `OPT` to `CP_OPTS`.

Ok, except that `hg_script` won't work if `$SAGE_ROOT` contains spaces, and "sage" should be "Sage" in the messages, the patches and attached files now look fine (with the one exception below).

In my opinion more exit codes should be checked (of `hg`, `tar` and `python`), but most of these omissions have been in before, so it is at least "consistent". ;-) (And some `tar` operations are verbose, while others are not. I also think the release date should be UTC or at least contain the [time and] time zone / UTC offset.)

But `sage-upgrade` should in any case check that

```sh
./pipestatus "sage-spkg $ROOT_REPO 2>&1" "tee -a $SAGE_ROOT/spkg/logs/$ROOT_REPO.log"
```
worked before calling `./install`.

I also wonder if this shouldn't (yet) be

```sh
./pipestatus "sage-spkg $ROOT_REPO 2>&1" "tee -a \"$SAGE_ROOT\"/spkg/logs/$ROOT_REPO.log"
```
(Not tested; the side effects of `pipestatus` are quite weird.)

I haven't yet applied the patches or fully checked the functionality; at least I didn't find errors in the latest attachments. :)

Btw, why aren't base packages subject to upgrading? (I would have expected the root spkg there.)

Since this script only gets run once, by the release manager when this ticket is merged, and since it doesn't get distributed with Sage, I'm not going to worry about it.  When Sage works with spaces in the path, if this hasn't been merged yet, I can fix it then.

I'll fix that.  You mean messages like "Error building the sage source code package" or  "Error copying sage root repository", right?

You're right, I thought about this before, but didn't do it.

I'm not sure what you mean by "base packages".  The `sage-upgrade` script will certainly upgrade the sage-root spkg. Let's see, the sage-update script will download any new spkg, including any sage-root spkg. Then it gets installed in sage-upgrade before the other spkgs, in case it changes deps or spkg/install.

Should I create an upgrade path on sage.math?  I may wait a day or two for the disk situation to settle down...

Re the "pipestatus" command, I'm going to leave it as is and see what happens during testing.  (When I tested a month ago or so, the sage-root spkg got upgraded, and I vaguely remember checking that the log file had the right name, but I'll test again.)

The packages /files in `spkg/base`, also referred to by `$(BASE)` in the Makefile (`deps`).

Yes, of course. (`sage-update` currently doesn't attempt to upgrade anything from `spkg/base`.)

I have no opinion on that.

Here are new versions; the only difference with any content (i.e., other than capitalization, I think) is from sage-upgrade:

```diff
-./pipestatus "sage-spkg $ROOT_REPO 2>&1" "tee -a $SAGE_ROOT/spkg/logs/$ROOT_REPO.log"

+    exit 1
+fi
```

I don't know why base packages don't get upgraded.  That's for another ticket.

> Should I create an upgrade path on sage.math?

I meant so that people could test "sage -upgrade".   I'll do this pretty soon.

Hi Dan,

Thanks for working on this.  The Sage repo patch looks good.  Skimming the scripts patch, the only issue I see with the rebasing is that I think $PKGDIR should be quoted in the following (this is lines 39-41 in sage-sdist):

```
cp "$SAGE_ROOT"/local/bin/sage-spkg $PKGDIR/base/ 
cp "$SAGE_ROOT"/local/bin/sage-env  $PKGDIR/base/ 
cp "$SAGE_ROOT"/local/bin/sage-make_relative $PKGDIR/base/ 
```
I'll look at this more carefully when I have time.

Hmmm, this doesn't work for upgrades from older versions (<=4.5), and as you mentioned, behaves strange on newer versions >=4.5.1.

We **have to** download `spkg/install` (and I'd prefer the rest, too) in `sage-update` (the Python script).

What's currently newly made in `sage-upgrade` should be moved to that file, which is in any case the fresh, downloaded one. *There* we have to make a distinction on if we are upgrading.

If so, `spkg/install` should then install the root repo (preferably without overwriting itself, but the root repo should, i.e. must, contain exactly the same file), since our "real" Makefile `spkg/standard/deps` doesn't (though I don't know why you don't want to put the root spkg there).

Btw, it would be better to also have `sage-spkg` in the root rather than the scripts repo; or download an identical copy (from the scripts repo) along with `install`, `deps` etc.

This way we would always do the whole build with the new one, and not switch the version during the installation (after the new scripts spkg has been installed).

Another reason to keep the repos separate, and not as Robert B. suggested on sage-devel, merge them all into an even larger, monolithic one.

(To avoid trouble with getting overwritten, a script can always clone itself and then `exec` this copy, passing it a parameter such that it knows if it's the clone or the original, similar to `fork()`. We should IMHO do this for a few scripts involved in upgrading and the build process. Therefore, the chain or stack of called rather than `exec`'ed scripts shouldn't be deep.)

Rename it to `Makefile.old`?

Well, the files that were previously downloaded (`deps` and `newest_version`, too). But also downloading `sage-env` (and e.g. `sage-spkg`) is not a bad idea.

(I also plan to download `upgrade-notes.txt` and `pre-upgrade-script.sh` first, such that the user (and we) can make an informed choice.)

Well, then `hg pull` would simply be a no-op. But we should check the exit codes of the commands in `root-spkg-install` (`hg` and `cp`) anyway.

`hg incoming <source repo>` returns 1 if there's nothing to pull, 0 if there are changes to pull, other values on errors, so you could change it to:

```sh
...
if [ -d "$TARGET"/.hg ]; then

    # Merge the repository, rather than overwrite changes that the
    # user may have made.
    cd "$TARGET"
    hg ci  # Don't know if we should check in unconditionally,
           # so perhaps move this below the if-elif-fi.
    # should check for errors here
    
    hg incoming "$CUR"  # perhaps redirect output
    if [ $? -eq 1 ]; then
        # No changes to pull
        exit 0
    elif [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
        # Some error, report...
        exit 1
    fi
    # $? = 0: Changes to pull...
    hg pull "$CUR"
    hg merge tip
    hg ci -m "Check-in during upgrade of Sage."
    hg update
    # Add error checks above, too.

else
    ...
```

(Or you could add a rule to `deps` that tests its presence / the need to pull first, before calling `sage-spkg`. But if we one day generate `deps`, this would be less optimal.)



> > Btw, it would be better to also have `sage-spkg` in the root rather than the scripts repo; or download an identical copy (from the scripts repo) along with `install`, `deps` etc.

Yes, see above. Once we have this ticket in, it will be easier (or at least safer) to make such changes. :-)


P.S.: I wonder if the presence of `$SAGE_ROOT/.hg` guarantees us a functional Mercurial... ;-)

Downloading these various files in sage-update seems to at least partly defeat the purpose of the new repo, but anyway.

If we put it in deps, I guess it gets installed at the end?  I was tempted to make it part of BASE, but then during an upgrade, any changes to the Sage root repo would mean that everything would be rebuilt, which would be annoying.  The only issue is if there is an upgrade to a script like "pipestatus" which is in the root repo, is used in the upgrade process, and is not downloaded in sage-update.

> P.S.: I wonder if the presence of `$SAGE_ROOT/.hg` guarantees us a functional Mercurial... ;-)

I think I'll switch to running "hg verify".

I'm not sure what you mean: the file "root-spkg-install" is completely new to this ticket, and is not part of any pre-existing repo.  So there's nothing to patch.  I'm flipping this back to "needs review".

Regarding #10231, I'd like to see more discussion on sage-devel about it.  I know that leif disagrees, but I'm also interested in the idea of combining the various non-root repos (scripts, examples, extcode, and the main Sage library) into one.

I've tried twice with 4.6 using the above command, and despite the upgrade appearing to work, I get this when I start Sage:

Attachment: **[deps.2.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9433/deps.2.gz)**

After some rediffing I built it successfully on top of Sage-4.6.1.rc1 (identical to the Sage-4.6.1 release) with the following updated files:

* `trac_9433-scripts.v5.patch` -> `trac_9433-scripts.v5.2.patch`
* `install` -> `install.2`
* `deps` -> `deps.2`

I've changed the main ticket documentation accordingly. 

For reference, here is a list of files in the root repository:

```
[vbraun@volker-two sage-4.6.1.vb2]$ hg st --all | grep -v '^I'
C .hgignore
C .hgtags
C COPYING.txt

Really, any kind of root repository would be better than the caveman technology we have in place right now. I read through all the scripts and they do make sense to me. I built my private release using `sage -sdist <version>` and it compiled fine. You guys put a lot of effort into this ticket to make sure that nothing breaks, and I think it really is the time to integrate this with Sage. 

Positive review.

Jeroen, can you plug this into 4.6.2.alpha as soon as possible to give it as much exposure as possible?

Why do we need a `sage_root.spkg`?  I don't see a reason for a "root repo" to ever exist in tarball form.

If we do this, we really should also take care of the following **duplicate** files (files both in sage_scripts and in another repo):

```
README.txt
spkg/install
spkg/base/sage-spkg
spkg/base/sage-env
spkg/base/sage-make_relative
spkg/base/sage-check-64 (added by the not-yet-merged #10303)

Also, I think we should get rid of the `spkg/base` repo and merge it with the new root repo.

The way things are set up right now, if you upgrade an existing sage installation then the updated `SAGE_ROOT_REPO` will merge updates to the `$SAGE_ROOT` repository. As long as we don't have an official online repository to pull changes from I don't see any better way to do the upgrade. Am I missing something?

I agree that we need to disentangle the `sage_root` repository more from `sage_scripts`. Basically, everything that `sage_scripts/spkg-install` manually copies into `$SAGE_ROOT` should be part of the root repo, like `README.txt`. But I think this can wait until we actually do have a `sage_root` repository. Then it'll be easy to write complimentary patches for the two repositories that clean this up.

I'm also totally in favour of merging the spkg/base repo. Since that has only 26 log entries (with the most recent one from July), I think we can live without preserving its history. Right now we don't use this repository during upgrades as far as I know.

If you agree with this then I'll make a followup ticket...

Yes, that's the reason for its existence.

Basically, everything that `sage_scripts/spkg-install` manually copies into `$SAGE_ROOT` should be part of the root repo, like `README.txt`.

I think I don't understand. Once there is a SAGE_ROOT repo, then any follow-up ticket can just have a patch which needs to be applied to that repo, as opposed to manually patching `spkg/install` or `Makefile` or whatever. 

For the particular change you have in mind, it requires modifying various scripts (like spkg-install, but maybe others?) in local/bin, and it could possibly be complicated.  It seems safer to do things incrementally, first setting up the new repo, then on a later ticket making further changes.

(I also have a heavy teaching load right now, so I won't have much time to work on this.  I can try to fix bugs with the current implementation when anyone finds them, but I don't think I can work on any major modifications, like dealing with the spkg/base repo.)

For this particular ticket, I feel that having a halfway-implemented sage_root repository is strictly worse than having no sage_root repository at all.  The situation for merging SAGE_ROOT patches is already complicated enough (but I can manage) and I'm afraid the current patch on this ticket will make it only worse.

This ticket has been worked on for 7 months and has almost 100 comments ;-)

And every time I want to change something on this ticket I need half a day to rebuild sage, manually make half a dozen changes, test the source distribution.

In what way is the SAGE_ROOT repo "halfway-implemented"? With these scripts and patches, the repo will exist and work for upgrades and new builds.

> The situation for merging SAGE_ROOT patches is already complicated enough (but I can manage) 

Maybe you can manage -- but there's plenty of evidence that other release managers can't. Changing files in SAGE_ROOT currently takes a long time and is an extremely brittle process; why continue in this way?

And even if there's no trouble actually changing files, we still have no version control for our basic makefile, README, and executable script. The only way to track changes is to download tarballs, unpack them, and compare files. Think about it: neither the basic file with which we build Sage (the makefile) nor the basic file with which one runs Sage (SAGE_ROOT/sage) are under any version control! That is crazy. Imagine if Firefox shipped with their "firefox" script not under version control.

> and I'm afraid the current patch on this ticket will make it only worse.

Right now to change the README:

* make a backup copy
* make your changes
* manually run `diff -u` to produce a patch
* upload *both* the new README and the patch to a ticket
* upon positive review, hope that the release manager replaces the README file correctly and does `sage -sdist` in the right directory

With a SAGE_ROOT repo:

* use the same procedure that one uses in the Sage library to produce a patch.
* release manager uses same procedure as for the Sage library to merge the patch.

Perhaps it's only me, but the current situation seems far worse.

Please, let's create the SAGE_ROOT repo and argue about merging repos after they actually exist.

It's just copied from whatever was there before.  Why not track those files in a repository?  Otherwise they're not tracked anywhere: what if we want to change any of them?

Replying to [@vbraun](#comment:106):
> The ipython directory is in the `sage_scripts` repository and `sage_scripts/spkg-install` manually copies it into `$SAGE_ROOT`. The patch on this ticket removes that part from `sage_scripts/spkg-install`, so it will no longer be copied over.

Okay, I see.  I got confused by the renaming of `sage-spkg-install` to `spkg-install`, so I didn't realize what the file `sage-spkg-install` was all about.

I agree, but I think that having the quotes is clearer anyway.

This is most certainly a bug (in `sage-make_devel_packages`):

```
+if [ ! -f "$PKG/sage_scripts-$SAGE_VERSION.spkg" ]; then
```

Replying to [@jdemeyer](#comment:115):
> Upgrading from earlier versions of Sage doesn't work because `spkg/standard/VERSION.txt` is gone:

That's because when the scripts patch was rebased, lines like these were removed:

```
# Put VERSION.txt in a directory available for download during the 
# update process.  (See sage-update.) 
cp -p VERSION.txt $TMP/$PKGDIR/$STD/
```
I think that just restoring these lines should fix it .

It seems that the `SAGE_ROOT` repository requires a very recent of Mercurial.  With Mercurial version 1.6.4, I get

```
$ hg --version
Mercurial Distributed SCM (version 1.6.4)

```

I agree that a sufficiently recent version of Mercurial is shipped with Sage, but unless there is a good reason for this `dotencode` requirement, I would prefer if the root repo worked with Mercurial 1.3.1 like the other repos.

I don't really understand this complaint.

I'm really not sure about this.  Perhaps it should be discussed on #10594.  The lack of backwards compatibility seems problematic to me.  I can try to post something there later today.

Anything that creates a new mercurial repository will by default require dotencode. In particular, `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage-clone` which is unrelated to this ticket. 

It would be easy to add `--config format.dotencode=0` to all `hg init`, `hg clone` commands. But current distributions already picked up the new mercurial, so I don't see it as particularly pressing issue.

Okay, I have two options; which is better?  In `sage-update`, the files install, deps, and newest_version might get changed.  We could:

- commit the changes in `sage-update`, and then the changes will get committed again by `root-spkg-install` when the root repo spkg is installed.

- or in `root-spkg-install`, we can overwrite any changes: do `hg pull ...` to pull from the new repo and then `hg update --clean` to discard any other changes.

The first of these adds a redundant commit message to the log file if the relevant files are changed.  The second discards all changes, including any other ones that the user may have made.  I don't know Mercurial well enough, but perhaps there is a better third choice?

I've tried the update and it works beautifully. 

I think there is still one problem: If the user has no .hgrc (like many non-developers trying to upgrade), then mercurial will fail to commit with 

```
[vbraun@volker-desktop sage-4.7.alpha0]$ mv ~/.hgrc ~/backup.hgrc
[vbraun@volker-desktop sage-4.7.alpha0]$ hg commit -m "test"
abort: no username supplied (see "hg help config")
```
So whenever we commit to the root repo, we should specify a username explicitly. For example,

```
hg commit -u "committed by sage -upgrade" -m "test"
```

I wouldn't have spotted this.  Good catch.  I have new patches which add "-u ..." to various commit commands: in sage-update and in root-spkg-install.  I haven't bothered with sage-sdist or sage-make_devel_packages, since these are done by the release manager who had better have a .hgrc file.  (Besides, there are already other "hg commit" commands in those scripts.)

I've also updated my versions (4.6.2.X0 etc.) for testing upgrades with these changes.
