Useless, when looking for a triangle, to test both abc, bca, and cab. The same is true when looking for Cycles, for complete graphs, etc...

There may be a way to generally deal with those symmetries to improve the speed of subgraph search. Build complete table of n! symmetries if necessary (optional argument to toggle it).

If not, it is still possible to manually improve it for cycles, complete graphs, and other "common" graphs.
