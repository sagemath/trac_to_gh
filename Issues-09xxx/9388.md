The current makefile for the rubiks spkg.

The makefile erroneously assumes that "mktemp" can be run with no arguments.  This is not the case on, at least, recent versions of Mac OS X.

The probable fix is to run "mktemp" with a template filename.  See the man page for details.

Hi Jason, 
there's a few problems with this. 
* There's no SPKG.txt entry to show what was changed. 
* Patches should not be attached to the trac server, but instead given to a location where they can be found. 
* Having looked into this more, 'mktemp' is not defined by POSIX so is not portable. We might find this screws up the FreeBSD port. 

I'll create another which avoid using it completely. 

Give me 15 minutes. 

Dave

It might be that we're coming from different contexts, but it strikes me as rude to remove someone from the author block.

That certainly was not my intension. I was coming it from the point that an author could not review it, and it would make it possible for Justin to review it. 
If you look at a comment on sage-devel today, I specifically asked Francois to remove me from an author or #9097 since he had another idea on this, then I would be able to review it. 

Sorry if I caused any offense to Justin or yourself - that was certainly not my intension.

I was coming it from the point that an author could not review it, and it would make it possible for Justin to review it. \n> If you look at a comment on sage-devel today, I specifically asked Francois to remove me from an author or #9097 since he had another idea on this, then I would be able to review it. \n\nI frequently see the same two people listed as author and reviewer. Often there are multiple patches, with (author, reviewer) switching between persons (a,b) and (b,a), for one example. I am sure you did not intend anything rude, I just wanted to bring it up to avoid misunderstanding. The author and reviewer fields on the trac server should be the union of anyone who feels that they have contributed to that part of the process. The only rule to follow strictly is that the author of a patch cannot review that patch, but as you have seen, trac tickets frequently become pretty complicated.

I frequently see the same two people listed as author and reviewer. Often there are multiple patches, with (author, reviewer) switching between persons (a,b) and (b,a), for one example. I am sure you did not intend anything rude, I just wanted to bring it up to avoid misunderstanding.
