The current makefile for the rubiks spkg.

The makefile erroneously assumes that "mktemp" can be run with no arguments.  This is not the case on, at least, recent versions of Mac OS X.

The probable fix is to run "mktemp" with a template filename.  See the man page for details.

The patch file is just the fix for the file "spkg-install".  The "spkg" is a new spkg file with the changed "spkg-install" script.

Hi Jason, 
there's a few problems with this. 
* There's no SPKG.txt entry to show what was changed. 
* Patches should not be attached to the trac server, but instead given to a location where they can be found. 
* Having looked into this more, 'mktemp' is not defined by POSIX so is not portable. We might find this screws up the FreeBSD port. 

I'll create another which avoid using it completely. 

Give me 15 minutes.

David --- While credit for individual patches by definition goes to those who make them, the author block is for credit in the release notes, which should go to anyone who helped move the fix towards its final form. I think that Justin still deserves credit here for helping to hunt down the problem in the first place.

It might be that we're coming from different contexts, but it strikes me as rude to remove someone from the author block.

That certainly was not my intension. I was coming it from the point that an author could not review it, and it would make it possible for Justin to review it. 
If you look at a comment on sage-devel today, I specifically asked Francois to remove me from an author or #9097 since he had another idea on this, then I would be able to review it. 

Sorry if I caused any offense to Justin or yourself - that was certainly not my intension.
