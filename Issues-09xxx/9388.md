The current makefile for the rubiks spkg.

The makefile erroneously assumes that "mktemp" can be run with no arguments.  This is not the case on, at least, recent versions of Mac OS X.

The probable fix is to run "mktemp" with a template filename.  See the man page for details.

I'll create another which avoid using it completely.

I think that Justin still deserves credit here for helping to hunt down the problem in the first place.

It might be that we're coming from different contexts, but it strikes me as rude to remove someone from the author block.

That certainly was not my intension. I was coming it from the point that an author could not review it, and it would make it possible for Justin to review it. 
If you look at a comment on sage-devel today, I specifically asked Francois to remove me from an author or #9097 since he had another idea on this, then I would be able to review it. 

Sorry if I caused any offense to Justin or yourself - that was certainly not my intension.
