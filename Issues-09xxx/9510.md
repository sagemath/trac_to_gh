<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

I've now built this successfully.  I'm pretty sure that the reason is because of a bad  LD_LIBRARY_PATH, as in #8769.  I was building on eno using "screen", and when I use screen on eno, it doesn't set LD_LIBRARY_PATH at all.  On taurus, LD_LIBRARY_PATH was misconfigured.  On taurus, for example, if I set it correctly, then gfan (and everything else) builds fine.  If I then set it to the previous wrong value and delete spkg/installed/gfan..., then I get the same error that I reported here.

So I'm going to close this ticket.
