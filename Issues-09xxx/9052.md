This is a coincidence, since just yesterday I was considering implementing functions is_supersingular() and is_ordinary().  Now this can be done very simply (since s.s. curves have invariant 0 and ordinary ones have nonzero invariant).

However, I'm a little worried about the efficiency of the current implementation for even modest p, since it involves raising a degree 3 polynomial to the power (p-1)/2 and then picking out one coefficient.   There are easier ways to test supersingularity for small p, since one can precompute the s.s. j-invariants and check that.  This would be a quicker way of computing H when it is 0.  One could check that the j-invariant has degree at most 2 (else ordinary).  And over the prime field GF(p), s.s. curves have cardinality p+1, and another way to check ordinary-ness is to take random points and multiply then by p+1.  As a last resort one can compute the cardinality.

I guess this is enough for a second ticket!
