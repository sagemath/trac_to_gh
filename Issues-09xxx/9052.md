Strictly this should be looked at again (William?), but I don't seem to have the option of marking it as "needs review" again.  In case you are wondering about the char. 5,7 cases, as well as doing the math I also systematically checked that this gives the same as the general method for *all* curves over GF(5) and GF(7)!
