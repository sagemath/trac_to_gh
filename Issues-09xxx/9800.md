The `docutils` package, which is at version 0.5 in sage, lacks a spkg-check file, so the self-tests can't be run. But the package has a set of tests, which according to the `README.txt` is executed as below. 

```
Running the Test Suite
======================

To run the entire test suite, after installation_ open a shell and use
the following commands::

    cd <archive_directory_path>/test
    ./alltests.py
```
