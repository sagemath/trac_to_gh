```
With Sage 4.4.4 and no relevant patches, I got the following:

```
sage: FiniteField(3)(2).sqrt(all = True)
[]

sage: 2.sqrt(extend = False, all = True)
ValueError: square root of 2 not an integer

sage: FiniteField(next_prime(2^100))(2).sqrt(extend = False, all = True)
ValueError: self must be a square

sage: _.<a>=FiniteField(9)
sage: a.sqrt(extend = False, all = True)
ValueError: must be a perfect square.
```

At sage days 23 we agreed that square root with all=True should not raise an error. If no square roots exist, then it should return an empty list.

Right now, it returns an empty list for elements of small prime finite fields, but raises an error for integers, elements of large prime finite fields, and elements of non-prime finite fields.

Thanks! That bug has been around for too long :)

Why were you not able to fix the `FiniteField(9)` case?

Unfortunately, the patches need some more work, for the following three reasons.
* With my2.patch:

  ```
  sage: Zmod(7)(3).sqrt(extend=True)
  sqrt3
  sage: Zmod(7)(3).sqrt(all=True, extend=True)
  []
  ```
  The second one should either output `[sqrt3, -sqrt3]` or raise `NotImplementedError`, but never an empty list.
* Patches must have your name and email address in them. This is done by putting your email address and name in your `.hgrc` file as specified [here](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/walk_through.html#submitting-a-change)
* Add an example of the new functionality to the documentation:
  * This helps the user understand what the function does.
  * Through the doctesting framework, this prevents other people from accidentally breaking your added functionality.
  * This is [required](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/trac.html#reviewing-patches) for your patch to be able to get a positive review. In fact, the manual says that you should also mention the ticket number #9466 with your example.

If you have any questions, let me know!
