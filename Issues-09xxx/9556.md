Let `e` be a symbolic expression. It may happen that `e.operator()` has a certain callable attribute, say, `foo`, that is not a method of `Function`. In this situation, one would like to use `e.foo()`, which is supposed to return `e.operator().foo(*e.operands())` - apparently this is useful for working with hypergeometric functions (#2516).

**__Example__**

```
       sage: from sage.symbolic.function import BuiltinFunction
        sage: class TFunc(BuiltinFunction):
        ....:     def __init__(self):
        ....:         BuiltinFunction.__init__(self, 'tfunc', nargs=1)
        ....:
        ....:     class EvaluationMethods:
        ....:         def argp1(self, x):
        ....:             '''
        ....:             Some documentation about a bogus function.
        ....:             '''
        ....:             return x+1
        ....:
        ....:         @property
        ....:         def foo(self):
        ....:             return 5
        ....:
        sage: tfunc = TFunc()
        sage: e = tfunc(x); e
        tfunc(x)
        sage: type(e)
        <class '__main__.Expression_with_dynamic_methods'>
        sage: e.argp1()
        x + 1
        sage: e.foo
        5
        sage: x.argp1()
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        AttributeError: 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression' object has no
        attribute 'argp1'
        sage: t = (e + 1).op[0]; t
        tfunc(x)
        sage: t
        tfunc(x)
        sage: type(t)

....: 
sage: ex_func = ExampleBuiltin()
sage: f = ex_func(x, x+1, x+2)
sage: f.some_function_name()
3
sage: abs(f)

Note that pickling also works:

```
sage: loads(dumps(ceil(x))).foo_bar()
4
```

One issue is that in order to get the dynamic features, you have to go through the __call__ method of the function.  Thus, you'd have to change Expression.__abs__

```
        return new_Expression_from_GEx(self._parent, g_abs(self._gobj))

to return the dynamic class version.  Similarly, unpickling old objects will just return an Expression object.

-We obtain a symbolic expression by calling `ex_func`:

-```
-sage: e = ex_func(x,x+1, x+2)

-
-We add a callable and a non-callable attribute to `ex_func`:

-```
-sage: def some_function(slf, *L): print slf,'called with',L
-...
-sage: ex_func.foo_bar = some_function
-sage: ex_func.bar_foo = 4
