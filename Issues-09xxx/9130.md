Although Maxima has the beta function, Sage doesn't:

```
sage: a, b, c = var('a b c') 
sage: assume(a > 0) 
sage: assume(b > 0) 
sage: x = var('x') 
sage: beta_dist = x**(a-1) * (1 - x)**(b-1) 
sage: c = integral(beta_dist, x, 0, 1) 
sage: c
beta(a, b)
sage: c(a=.5,b=.5)
beta(0.500000000000000, 0.500000000000000)
sage: c(a=.5,b=.5).n()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

```
This *is* is Ginac, though, and there is even room for defining it in symbolic/expression.pyx . It probably is also included in some of our other libraries, as a standard special function.

For numerical evaluation, mpmath has beta and also the generalized incomplete beta function for complex arguments. But it's probably easy to do the complete beta function directly with Ginac.

Simplification for rational arguments (beta(0.5,0.5) = pi) would be nice.

Unless someone else wants to work on this, I might have a stab at it within a couple of days.

I wasn't suggesting which of the several packages in Sage should be used for numerical evaluation, though mpmath did come to mind :-)

I don't think that beta(0.5,0.5) would work, given that

```
sage: gamma(0.5)
1.77245385090552
sage: gamma(1/2)
sqrt(pi)
```
but beta(1/2,1/2) becoming pi should work fine once we have a symbolic wrapper (with or without Ginac):

```
sage: maxima_console()
Maxima 5.21.1 http://maxima.sourceforge.net
using Lisp ECL 10.4.1
Distributed under the GNU Public License. See the file COPYING.
Dedicated to the memory of William Schelter.
The function bug_report() provides bug reporting information.
(%i1) beta(1/2,1/2);
(%o1)                                 %pi
```
Please do try to add this!  We definitely often get email asking for various special functions both symbolically and numerically.  Also, the more examples we have, the easier it is to finish off the rest of them by cut and paste.

Though I don't know why the `beta()` function in `sage/symbolic/expression.pyx` is commented. Maybe there is something I'm missing.

`psi()` and `psi2()` were commented because at the time there was no method defined to numerically evaluate those. This is not the case for `beta()` however. Here is the `evalf` method (from line 227 of `ginac/inifcns_gamma.cpp`):

```
	if (is_exactly_a<numeric>(x) && is_exactly_a<numeric>(y)) {
		try {
			return exp(lgamma(ex_to<numeric>(x))+lgamma(ex_to<numeric>(y))-lgamma(ex_to<numeric>(x+y)));
		} catch (const dunno &e) { }
	}
```

We'll find out when someone tries this out I suppose.

Added ginac wrapper for beta function.
There is a problem when one argument is a float.

--Karen


```
sage: beta(3,2.0)


------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred in Sage.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* component
of Sage has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
or is not properly wrapped with _sig_on, _sig_off.
You might want to run Sage under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
Sage will now terminate (sorry).

Hi Karen,

sorry for taking so long to look at this. It seems that I forgot to check for a NULL pointer in `py_float()`. [attachment: trac_9130-py_float_segfault.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9130/trac_9130-py_float_segfault.patch.gz) fixes the segfault.

```
sage: from sage.functions.other import beta
sage: beta(3,2.0)
0.0833333333333333
```

Will you have time to finish the patch?

You need to add an import statement to `sage/functions/all.py` so `beta` is available at the command line.  The documentation also needs some care. IIRC there should be an empty line after `INPUT`, `OUTPUT` and `EXAMPLES`. The statement

```
        It is computed by various libraries within Sage, depending on
        the input type.
```

is too vague. We should either remove it or explain how GiNaC evaluates this (see `beta_eval()` and `beta_evalf()` in [inifcns_gamma.cpp](https://bitbucket.org/burcin/pynac/src/51619d2eb90f/ginac/inifcns_gamma.cpp#cl-249)).

I think we discovered that the only complex inputs that the code accepts are ones where one of the parameters is equal to 1. In that case `beta(1,x) = 1/x` is used to compute the result. Looks like GiNaC can't handle complex inputs at all (or perhaps complex numbers aren't being passed to GiNaC in a way it understands).

On the other hand, [mpmath](http://mpmath.googlecode.com/svn/tags/0.17/doc/build/functions/gamma.html#beta-function) does support evaluation at arbitrary precision complex numbers so that could be a useful enhancement that could take place in a new ticket. 

I would change the docstrings to clearly indicate that
1. only real inputs are accepted (for now)
2. beta(1,x) = beta(x,1) = 1/x simplification is automatically applied

The patch looks great, I have a couple of minor comments. We can switch this to positive review when these are fixed:

* This paragraph in the docstring is not needed any more:

```
GiNaC is used to compute `B(p,q)`.  However, complex inputs 
are not yet handled in general.  When GiNaC raises an error on 
such inputs, we raise a NotImplementedError. 
```
 Perhaps the first sentence can be merged with the paragraph following that.
* The commit message for the combined patch is not very helpful. I'd like my patch to stay separate if possible.

This is because of the addition to the reference manual of stuff that wasn't up to snuff, though almost.  There was an extra colon as well, and a few other similar things.

I've fixed these things, and actually tried adding loads(dumpg()) tests as well, but it doesn't matter, because it's not testing right.  It's not the computer, since other files are passing fine.  It seems to be the symbolic version of beta.

Getting rid of all stuff with `x` and keeping

```
            sage: beta(1,2.0+I)
            0.400000000000000 - 0.200000000000000*I
```
causes

```

$ ../../sage -t sage/functions/other.py 
sage -t  "devel/sage-main/sage/functions/other.py"          
The doctested process was killed by signal 11
	 [6.8 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The following tests failed:


	sage -t  "devel/sage-main/sage/functions/other.py" # Killed/crashed
Total time for all tests: 6.9 seconds
```
but removing that as well yields passing tests.

This seems unexpected to me.

I rebased the patches against #4498. This meant moving the changes to `sage/symbolic/random_tests.py` out of [attachment: trac_9130_beta_function.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9130/trac_9130_beta_function.patch.gz) and into a new patch [attachment: trac_9130-random-tests.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9130/trac_9130-random-tests.patch.gz) that reflects the differences in the random tests after #4498 was applied and `beta` was added.

The tests in `random_test.py` are getting annoying. Now #9130 must depend on #4498 and in turn my #11888 must depend on #9130, etc. To finish #11143, I need to rebase the changes to `random_tests.py` to all 3 of these other symbolics patches.

Would it make sense to open a new ticket for changes needed to `random_tests.py` after all the new symbolic functions are added that will go into sage-5.0? This new ticket would depend on all the other tickets adding new functions. This way we wouldn't have to fix the random tests like this in every ticket that adds a new function, just *once* per release.

I think if you would have merged this first, then #12507, there wouldn't have needed to be a rebase.   Maybe the authors of #12507 should have put this as a dependency?  I think we were all lax with it because it `# random`ized a doctest...
