Since it is claimed ECL and Maxima are causing doctest failures on sage.math (see #9460) a decision has been made to revert ECL and Maxima. This patch will use the old version, but with a couple of patches which are already positively reviewed to allow ECL to build on Solaris 10 and OpenSolaris x64.

Let's hope this solves the problem, as several people manage to build sage-4.5.alpah4 on sage.math.washington.edu with Maxima tests passing, and other tests have failed on sage.math too.

To the release manager: merge the spkg from #9187 instead.

It's less portable without the extra character! (You might note that autoconf adds the extra character too). I just get into a habit of writing my code the most portable way, even if in this case it will be run with bash, which for all recent versions at least does not require an extra character. 

I'm aware that there are no quotes needed - you might not the new code which deletes the temporary files has no such quotes.

I appreciate that. But all 3 options are POSIX, and as you say it does not break on any other platform. Basically that test ensures the code will only be executed on a very specific platform where I know there is an issue. 

Here's the output on my Sony Vaio laptop (OpenSolaris 2009.06 snv_111b)

```
drkirkby@laptop:~$ uname -rsm
SunOS 5.11 i86pc
```

on disk.math.washington.edu (OpenSolaris 2008.11 snv_101b_rc2)

```
-bash-3.2$ uname -rsm
SunOS 5.11 i86pc
```

and my Sun Ultra 27 (OpenSolaris 2009.06, upgraded to snv_134)

```
drkirkby@hawk:~$ uname -rsm
SunOS 5.11 i86pc
```

Note I did not use the unportable '-p' option. That does not work on HP-UX. 

So can this get a positive review? 

Dave

 == Testing on sage.math (a Sun running Ubuntu Linux 8.04.4 LTS. ) ==
It built fine and failed one doctest on sage.math:

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The following tests failed:

	sage -t  -long devel/sage/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/lseries_ell.py # 3 doctests failed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Total time for all tests: 1076.9 secon
```

This is the same failure William got with the sage-4.5.alpha4, and is a result of a lack of memory:

I don't know how much memory that tests needs, but its passed for me before. Perhaps it needs more RAM than other tests. 

I'll test on OS X (bsd.math) too, but note the changes are Solaris specific, so Linux and OX X should see exactly the same code.

I looked in John's directory `/scratch/palmieri/sage-4.5.rc0` on t2.math, and see the doctests had completed with 7 failures. However, three of those end with `# File not found` which is actually just a timeout - hopefully #9316 should fix that bug. After running the tests that failed for John at the command line, with longer timeouts, I find there are two failures which will not go away. 

```
	sage -t -long "devel/sage/doc/en/thematic_tutorials/group_theory.rst"
	sage -t -long "devel/sage/sage/libs/galrep/wrapper.pyx"
```

Those two failures need to be resolved. I created tickets (#9489 and #9490) for these two doctest failures. 

The longest test was:

```
sage -t -long "devel/sage/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_rational_field.py"
	 [3023.2 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 3023.2 seconds
```

so it looks like one needs a SAGE_TIMEOUT_LONG >= 3600 seconds (one hour) to be reasonably confident of not getting a timeout on 't2.math'.

John's successful tests would appear to have been built with `ecl-10.2.1.p1.spkg` from #9187, which has these changes, **plus** the changes to allow better building in parallel. I'm basing this on the fact that John has the ecl-10.2.1.p1.spkg in his directory, but not the ecl-10.2.1.p0.spkg I created.

My successful tests on OS X were also using ecl-10.2.1.p1.spkg from #9187.

Yes, that's right.  That's what I meant in [my comment above](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/9474#comment:17).

I'm marking this as "positive review" since it builds on sage.math, OS X, and t2 without problem.

By the way, Dave, my build on t2 only took 2 hours this time (!) -- this is without ATLAS and the docs, of course.  Some of the speedup is probably because of building in /scratch instead of /home, so thanks for that pointer.
