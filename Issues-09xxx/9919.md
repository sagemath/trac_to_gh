The `@`update_wrapper decorator from the Python standard library does not work for non-function callables (e.g. methods) in Python versions older than 3.2. It was fixed as Python bug issue 3445. Until Sage upgrades to such a new version of Python, we can put a work-around in sage.misc.misc.sage_wraps which patches this bug.
