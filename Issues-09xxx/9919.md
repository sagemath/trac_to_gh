The `@`update_wrapper decorator from the Python standard library does not work for non-function callables (e.g. methods) in Python versions older than 3.2. It was fixed as Python bug issue 3445. Until Sage upgrades to such a new version of Python, we can put a work-around in sage.misc.misc.sage_wraps which patches this bug.

I hope I'm not being too picky here, but could also note in the source that this was fixed in Python 3.2 and the Python bug number?  That way, when I'm reading the source (much more often than this ticket!), it's easy to determine when we can remove the work around?

This might be easier to change over on #9089, which I plan to review in conjunction with this ticket.
