Suppose G is a graph with loops permitted containing the edge (0, 1).  I would expect that G.merge_vertices([0, 1]) would create a loop (0, 0), but it doesn't:

```
sage: G = Graph(loops = True)
sage: G.add_edge(0, 1)
sage: G.merge_vertices([0, 1])
sage: G.edges()
[]
```
I think either we should change this, or we should write explicitly in the documentation that merge_vertices doesn't create self-loops even when G allows them.
