Endpoint markers for the sliders.  Several people wanted to see 
what the range of the slider was while sliding, since it might be 
difficult to tell otherwise (0 to 1, .1 to .9, ... ).  I guess the 
request would be to make it possible (or even default) to have the 
endpoints somehow labeled. 

Component: **interact**
