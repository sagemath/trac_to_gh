## The problem

Python believe the compiler is broken, but it looks to me as if it is searching for an IBM compiler, not gcc. This is based on the contents of config.log, which are attached.

I'll test this with the latest Python and see if it works any better.

This is quite easy to fix - Python just needs to configure option `--with-gcc="$CC"` added. See attached patch.
