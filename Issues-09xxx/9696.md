Applies fine to 4.5.3.alpha1.   Perhaps it would be good to have a doctest showing this:

```
sage: AdditiveAbelianGroup([1])._latex_()
'\\frac{\\ZZ}{1\\ZZ}'
```
which is not what a mathematician would write (perhaps change it to '0'). 

I have given a positive review anyway, but would be happy to re-review with this changed and/or doctested.

v2 patch adds a stanza to the latex representation code to detect trivial factor(s) and format as '0'.  This probably only happens when the invariant list passed in is empty, but there shouldn't be much penalty in burying this inside the construction of all the other possible terms.

A doctest is added for this situation, and the affected file passes all tests.  I built the documentation, but it would appear this section is not being included in the documentation?  I could rectify that with another patch and a look at the resulting output.

Second patch looks good.  (I was just thinking of testing for the trivial group, but this is more general.)

Abelian groups are in the reference manual:  doc/en/reference/groups.rst has

```
   sage/groups/abelian_gps/abelian_group
   sage/groups/abelian_gps/abelian_group_element
   sage/groups/abelian_gps/abelian_group_morphism
   sage/groups/abelian_gps/dual_abelian_group
```

There are some formatting issues with those but not caused by this patch.
