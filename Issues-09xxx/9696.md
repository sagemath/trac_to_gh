Applies fine to 4.5.3.alpha1.   Perhaps it would be good to have a doctest showing this:

```
sage: AdditiveAbelianGroup([1])._latex_()
'\\frac{\\ZZ}{1\\ZZ}'
```
which is not what a mathematician would write (perhaps change it to '0'). 

I have given a positive review anyway, but would be happy to re-review with this changed and/or doctested.

Second patch looks good.  (I was just thinking of testing for the trivial group, but this is more general.)

Abelian groups are in the reference manual:  doc/en/reference/groups.rst has

```
   sage/groups/abelian_gps/abelian_group
   sage/groups/abelian_gps/abelian_group_element
   sage/groups/abelian_gps/abelian_group_morphism
   sage/groups/abelian_gps/dual_abelian_group
```

There are some formatting issues with those but not caused by this patch.

Sorry, my mistake -- abelian_groups are not additive_abelian_groups, and the latter are not included.  Something for another ticket!
