Good work so far!

I think the repr string for a (s-)class group should not mention its order or structure at all.  The user can always ask for that.

I'm not sure about the S() function returning None for a straight class group.  I would be happy with it returning [] when S is None.

In the number field file, there is no need to add the parameter None for straght class groups, since that is the default value;  so take those out.

I will now try the patches out...

The newest patch is something that I've been working on for the last several days, but I'm making no progress. There's a phantom attribute error which comes up under the following code:

```
sage: K.<a> = QuadraticField(-14)                             
sage: K.testSclassgroup(tuple([K.ideal(2,a)]))                
Class group of order 2 with structure C2 of Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^2 + 14
sage: K.testSclassgroup(tuple([K.ideal(2,a)]))(K.ideal(3,a+1))
ERROR: An unexpected error occurred ...
```

Perhaps there's something stupid I'm missing and someone else can point it out. Otherwise, I'm going to work on something else for a while and come back to this with a fresh head.

The AttributeError comes up because attributes whose names start with an underscore are private, and ones with two underscores are "very private" -- so private that they aren't even accessible to subclasses. So when code in `FractionalIdealClass` sets `__ideal`, code in the subclass `SFractionalIdealClass`. In fact it is still accessible but under a mangled name: see [http://docs.python.org/tutorial/classes.html#private-variables](http://docs.python.org/tutorial/classes.html#private-variables).

But there is another, deeper, bug which will be uncovered when you fix this. After my changes at #9244, a `FractionalIdealClass` stores both a representing ideal of that class, accessed via `self.ideal()`, and an expression for self in terms of the generators of its parent class group, accessed via `self.list()`. The way you've set this up, elements of an S-class group use the same data structure, but the data which `list()` uses is set completely wrongly: it's set to the exponents of the given ideal in terms of the generators of the class group, but it should be in terms of the generators of the **S-class group**. What you need to do is to store somewhere the expressions for the generators of the S-class group in terms of the generators of the class group (i.e. the matrix of the quotient map) and then multiply the output of `_ideal_class_log` by this.

This is the sort of stuff that #6449 was intended to solve: quotients of abelian groups should be automatically handled by general code, rather than having to do it by hand in every specific example.

I'm uploading a rebased (on sage-4.6) patch which modifies printing in class fields to not print the structure when size is 1, fixes some caching bugs, updates several doctests, etc...

However, this happens, and I'm not sure whether this is okay or not:

I applied the patch (no problems) to 4.6.1.alpha2.  The thing you observed does not happen:

```
sage: K.<a> = QuadraticField(-14) 
sage: S = K.primes_above(2) 
sage: S
[Fractional ideal (2, a)]
sage: I = K.ideal(3, a-1)
sage: I._S_ideal_class_log(S)

sage: I._S_ideal_class_log([]) 
[1]
```

I am now testing...

where in both cases the "Expected " does not look right anyway!

I am leaving this as needs review since I have not looked closely again at the code, but I can assert that apart from the above two things all (long) tests pass with 4.6.1.alpha2.

I also believe the actual output is correct. Evidence:

```
sage: K.<a> = QuadraticField(-14)
sage: S = K.primes_above(2)
sage: I = K.ideal(3,a+2)
sage: I
Fractional ideal (3, a + 2)
sage: I._ideal_class_log()

sage: I._S_ideal_class_log([])
[1]

I am uploading a fresh patch, which will fix all the above issues.
