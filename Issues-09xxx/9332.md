Good work so far!

I think the repr string for a (s-)class group should not mention its order or structure at all.  The user can always ask for that.

I'm not sure about the S() function returning None for a straight class group.  I would be happy with it returning [] when S is None.

In the number field file, there is no need to add the parameter None for straght class groups, since that is the default value;  so take those out.

I will now try the patches out...

The newest patch is something that I've been working on for the last several days, but I'm making no progress. There's a phantom attribute error which comes up under the following code:

```
sage: K.<a> = QuadraticField(-14)

```

Perhaps there's something stupid I'm missing and someone else can point it out. Otherwise, I'm going to work on something else for a while and come back to this with a fresh head.

The AttributeError comes up because attributes whose names start with an underscore are private, and ones with two underscores are "very private" -- so private that they aren't even accessible to subclasses. So when code in `FractionalIdealClass` sets `__ideal`, code in the subclass `SFractionalIdealClass`. In fact it is still accessible but under a mangled name: see [http://docs.python.org/tutorial/classes.html#private-variables](http://docs.python.org/tutorial/classes.html#private-variables).

This is the sort of stuff that #6449 was intended to solve: quotients of abelian groups should be automatically handled by general code, rather than having to do it by hand in every specific example.

I'm uploading a rebased (on sage-4.6) patch which modifies printing in class fields to not print the structure when size is 1, fixes some caching bugs, updates several doctests, etc...

However, this happens, and I'm not sure whether this is okay or not:
