<a id='comment:4'></a>Good work so far!

I think the repr string for a (s-)class group should not mention its order or structure at all.  The user can always ask for that.

I'm not sure about the S() function returning None for a straight class group.  I would be happy with it returning [] when S is None.

In the number field file, there is no need to add the parameter None for straght class groups, since that is the default value;  so take those out.

I will now try the patches out...
