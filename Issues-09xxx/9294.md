sagenb-0.8.p2/src/sagenb/sagenb/notebook/js.py

says

try:
    from sage.misc.misc import SAGE_ROOT
    from pkg_resources import Requirement, working_set
    sagenb_path = working_set.find(Requirement.parse('sagenb')).location
    debug_mode = SAGE_ROOT not in os.path.realpath(sagenb_path)
except AttributeError, ImportError:
    debug_mode = False

But according to what I cite below, it should rather be

except (AttributeError, ImportError):
