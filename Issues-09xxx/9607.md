Patch marks the test as random, which I think is the right thing to do, not just an expedient.

There is no way to know what extra packages a system will have, and this block of code is meant more as an illustration than as a test.  So in particular, the line in question could even be removed, but then there would be less of the behavior documented.

Well, I know better, it shouldn't have been there.  I have a latex-free system available at the moment, and I suspect #9074 could meet the same fate (I'll check shortly).
