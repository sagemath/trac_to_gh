Ah, note that in latex.rst, it does `setup_latex_preamble()`. Here's that entire function:

```
latex.add_package_to_preamble_if_available("tikz")
latex.add_package_to_preamble_if_available("tkz-graph")
latex.add_package_to_preamble_if_available("tkz-berge")
```
So on sage.math, it looks like tkz-graph and tkz-berge are not getting added because they're not available.

Patch marks the test as random, which I think is the right thing to do, not just an expedient.

There is no way to know what extra packages a system will have, and this block of code is meant more as an illustration than as a test.  So in particular, the line in question could even be removed, but then there would be less of the behavior documented.

Well, I know better, it shouldn't have been there.  I have a latex-free system available at the moment, and I suspect #9074 could meet the same fate (I'll check shortly).

Thanks for the quick look at this one.
