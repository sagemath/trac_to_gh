**Attachment:** [9750.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9750/9750.patch.gz)

Looks good (apart from one Sphinx warning which my reviewer patch fixes).

Is there a good reference, say in the PARI reference manual, for the GRH assumptions?

Good point, I added a reference to the PARI/GP User's Guide in the bnfcertify() documentation.  The new patch replaces the previous two patches.  John, can you re-review?
