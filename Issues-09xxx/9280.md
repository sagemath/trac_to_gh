<div id="comment:6" align="right">comment:6</div>

In the sage-combinat patch, there are a few typos and some other issues:

- in sage/categories/graded_algebras_with_basis.py, the docstring for "degree" says "The degree of this element in the graded polynomial algebra."  Delete "polynomial".

- in sage/categories/examples/graded_algebras_with_basis.py, the docstring for "one_basis" contains <code>'(0,...,0\`)</code>, and I think this should be changed to <code>\`\`(0,...,0)\`\`</code>.

- in sage/categories/examples/graded_algebras_with_basis.py, the docstring for the main class is now outdated: it still refers to "basis_function" and "_basis_fcn", which don't exist any more, and also to "homogeneous_component", which is now part of the default implementation, not something specific to this example.

I'm attaching a referee patch which fixes these. 

There are also some doctests for "basis" in sage/categories/graded_algebras_with_basis.py which are marked as "todo: not implemented".  Do we need to wait for these to be fixed, or should we consider this ready for review?  It may not be ideal, but we could also change

```
sage: A.basis(6) # todo: not implemented (output)
Family (y^{2}, x^{3}
```
to

```
sage: A.basis(6) # todo: not implemented (output)
Family (y^{2}, x^{3}
sage: list(A.basis(6))
[y^{2}, x^{3}]
```
By the way, all tests pass with this patch and with the one from #10193.  So perhaps we could also delete the commented-out part at the beginning of the example, where it says

```
# TODO: double check that we can now discard this function
```
