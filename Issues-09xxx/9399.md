The file `sage-4.4.4.alpha1/sage/rings/finite_rings/stdint.h` has this in it:

```
#if defined(__sun)
typedef int int_fast32_t;
typedef long long int_fast64_t;
#else
#include <stdint.h>
#endif

#define INTEGER_MOD_INT32_LIMIT 46341          //  = ceil(sqrt(2^31-1))
#define INTEGER_MOD_INT64_LIMIT 2147483647     //  = 2^31-1 for now, should be 3037000500LL = ceil(sqrt(2^63-1))
```

I can only assume someone added this Sun-specific code for a very old version of Solaris. Any Solaris 10 release will include the header file  <stdint.h>, so there is no need to have this. 

The code as it stands conflicts with a Solaris header file, which defines int_fast64_t as being a 'long' and not a 'long long' in 64-bit mode. The code as show is only valid for 32-bit. 

The following will save a few bytes, and will go further to advance the state of a 64-bit Solaris port. 

```
#include <stdint.h>

#define INTEGER_MOD_INT32_LIMIT 46341          //  = ceil(sqrt(2^31-1))
#define INTEGER_MOD_INT64_LIMIT 2147483647     //  = 2^31-1 for now, should be 3037000500LL = ceil(sqrt(2^63-1))
```
