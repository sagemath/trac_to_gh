The current code for iterating trough all elements of a Coxeter group
is currently ridiculously slow. For E<sub>8</sub>, it should take no more than a
couple minutes as Franck Lubeck's reported was possible in GAP. The
goal is not to brag, but to make sure that the infrastructure does not
impose unnecessary overhead.

There are several routes to this end, which all deserve to be explored:

* Using GAP's code; this will require at least fixing a `select`
  issue in GAP's interface (TODO: add ticket), if not using libGAP,
  and implementing the iter protocol for gap objects using GAP's
  Iterator (TODO: add ticket).

 Update (09/2014): for finite groups of size>1000, Sage's iterator
 for matrix groups now asks GAP to make the group into a permutation
 group, and asks GAP for an iterator thereupon through
libgap. However, for E8, this still can lead to overflowing GAP's
workspace. To be investigated.

* Optimizing the underlying CombinatorialFreeModule's arithmetic
* Ensuring that the permutation arithmetic is as fast as it should be
* Optimizing the generic Coxeter group code
* Using properly Coxeter 3.

 This is fast for small groups, but uses up memory for E8 on my
 machine:

 ```
    sage: W = CoxeterGroup(["E",6], implementation="coxeter3")
    sage: %time for w in CoxeterGroups().parent_class.__iter__(W): pass # generic iterator
    CPU times: user 31.1 s, sys: 31.4 ms, total: 31.1 s
    Wall time: 31.1 s

    sage: %time for w in W: pass                                        # Coxeter3's iterator
    CPU times: user 1.61 s, sys: 24.1 ms, total: 1.63 s
    Wall time: 1.61 s

    sage: W = CoxeterGroup(["E",7], implementation="coxeter3")
    sage: %time for w in W: pass
    CPU times: user 1min 33s, sys: 336 ms, total: 1min 33s
    Wall time: 1min 33s

    sage: W = CoxeterGroup(["E",8], implementation="coxeter3")
    sage: %time for w in W: pass
    sorry, insufficient memory
 ```

 To be investigated, but Coxeter3 probably builds the full group in memory.
