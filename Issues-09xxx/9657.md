There's a problem with cvxopt not building on gcc versions 4.5.0 or later. **This has become especially critical lately, as only gcc 4.5.0 is available on Skynet, so this effectively means Sage can not be built on any Skynet computer running Solaris (*mark*, *mark2* or *fulvia*)**

Here's an example with OpenSolaris with gcc 4.5.0, though the same problem occurs on Solaris 10 SPARC and Solaris 10 x86. 

```
drkirkby@hawk:~/sage-4.5.1$ ./sage -f cvxopt-0.9.p8

sage: An error occurred while installing cvxopt-0.9.p8
```

This is ultimately due to `_Complex_I` and `I` being undefined.

The correct definitions were taken from the complex.h header file which was *fixed* by gcc's `fixincludes` program.  

With this change, cvxopt builds properly 

```

The patch has been tested with: 
* gcc 4.2.4 on a Linux server (sage.math). The patch will not be applied there, but it was worth just verifying that. 
* gcc 4.4.4 on a Sun Ultra 27 running OpenSolaris 06/2009 (64-bit build)
* gcc 4.5.0 on a Sun Ultra 27 running OpenSolaris 06/2009 (64-bit build)
* gcc 3.4.3 on a Sun Blade 1000 running Solaris 10 03/2005 (32-bit build). Sage will not build with a gcc this old, but cvxopt built ok. 
* gcc 4.5.0 on a Sun Blade 1000 running Solaris 10 03/2005 (32-bit build)
* gcc 4.4.1 on a Sun T5240 (t2.math) running Solaris 10 05/2009

On all systems, cvxopt built properly. 
 
**The patch is only applied on Solaris, so is very safe.**

Yes, it has not been backported to the 4.3 or 4.4 series. Whether it ever will or not is another matter, but so far it has not.

I also tested on gcc 4.4.1 on 't2.math' - i.e. Solaris 10. 

At [#6456 comment:85](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/6456#comment:85) 

I show the results from compiling a test program on a wide range (11 different bits of hardware) under about 25 different conditions (compiler versions). In each case, the bug is see in the 4.3 and 4.4 series, but not in 4.5.
