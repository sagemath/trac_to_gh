Consider the following files and what sage
does with each when they are loaded:

---- foo1.sage ------
def add(a,b):
 return a+b
------------------------

--- foo2.py---
def add(a,b):
 return a+b
# this is a comment
---------------------

--- foo3.sage---
def add(a,b):
 return a+b
# this is a comment
---------------------

eno% ./sage
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Sage Version 4.4.4, Release Date: 2010-06-23                       |
| Type notebook() for the GUI, and license() for information.        |
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage: load "foo1.sage"
sage: load "foo2.py"
sage: load "foo3.sage"
------------------------------------------------------------
  File "<string>", line 3
    # this is a comment
                      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

sage:

Is the inability to load foo3.sage a bug or a feature?

According to William Stein:

<div id="comment:2" align="right">comment:2</div>

The reason for this is likely this note from the python docs:

```
When compiling a string with multi-line code in
'single' or 'eval' mode, input must be terminated
by at least one newline character. This is to
facilitate detection of incomplete and complete
statements in the code module.
```

(Also note:

```
Changed in version 2.7: Allowed use of Windows and
Mac newlines. Also input in 'exec' mode does not
have to end in a newline anymore.
```
)

The obvious patch would be to add a newline automatically before passing the input to `exec`. I'll create a patch for this.

I'll unapply the patch and retry these three doctests, but earlier this afternoon they failed both before and after the patch was applied.


However, the test

```
      sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/misc/preparser.py"
```

Passes both before and after applying the patch.

So two things, first, I think I ran the tests on a different version of sage, as now I am getting that those three tests fail both with and without the patch applied.  
Second, the add 'TestSuit(s).run()' doctest and the missing doctest are not related to this ticket (though completing the coverage could be another ticket.)

It looks to me like those doctest failures were fixed some time between 4.6 and 4.6.1rc0.
