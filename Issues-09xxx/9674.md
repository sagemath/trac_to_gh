Revision sage/crypto/mq/sbox.py [11673:11b2f556827a:12294:d7533ae4895e] (explacing log_b() by exact_log()) causes the following problems:

* difference_distribution_matrix() (in crypto/mq/sbox.py) crashes when an n-to-m bit S-box does not contain the element 2<sup>m-1</sup> (the wrong calculation of m results in an array index going out of bounds).

* the statement length != int(length) is never executed, because exact_log() always outputs an integer

> Does ticket #9366 fix your problem?

Thank you for looking into this. You patch fixes the second bullet point. But the main problem is this line: "self.n = ZZ(max(S)+1).exact_log(2)".

Try this, and see what happens:
S = mq.SBox(5,6,0,3,4,2,1,2);
S.difference_distribution_matrix();

If you are satisfied with the patch, and checked that all the doctests are still ok, then the procedure is to check the action "positive review" (bottom of the ticket page if you are logged in) and add yourself to the reviewers.
This allows the release manager to consider the merging of this ticket in the next release.
