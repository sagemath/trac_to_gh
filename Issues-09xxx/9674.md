Revision sage/crypto/mq/sbox.py [11673:11b2f556827a:12294:d7533ae4895e] (explacing log_b() by exact_log()) causes the following problems:

* difference_distribution_matrix() (in crypto/mq/sbox.py) crashes when an n-to-m bit S-box does not contain the element 2<sup>m-1</sup> (the wrong calculation of m results in an array index going out of bounds).

* the statement length != int(length) is never executed, because exact_log() always outputs an integer

Thank you for looking into this. You patch fixes the second bullet point. But the main problem is this line: "self.n = ZZ(max(S)+1).exact_log(2)".

Try this, and see what happens:
S = mq.SBox(5,6,0,3,4,2,1,2);
S.difference_distribution_matrix();
