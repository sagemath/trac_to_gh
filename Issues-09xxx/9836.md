Here it is ! The long-promised tutorial for LP. It is a translation of the french sagebook, and I hope I will be able to keep the two coordinated `:-)`

This patchremoved the old tutorial from the "constructions" document where it shouldn't have been put in the first place, and creates a new file in thematic_tutorials. It is up-to-date for the moment, though I hope to be able to work on some improvements with the CPLEX interface soon. It may only change te way CPLEX has to be installed, which would only require a minor edit later.

<a id='comment:1'></a>The two pictures should be added to the `thematic_tutotials/` folder. This patch does not pass doctests for two reasons :

* Sage forgets the definition of the variables between different code sections (if you have any idea about how to fix this `^^;`)
