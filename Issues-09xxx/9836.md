Here it is ! The long-promised tutorial for LP. It is a translation of the french sagebook, and I hope I will be able to keep the two coordinated `:-)`

This patchremoved the old tutorial from the "constructions" document where it shouldn't have been put in the first place, and creates a new file in thematic_tutorials. It is up-to-date for the moment, though I hope to be able to work on some improvements with the CPLEX interface soon. It may only change te way CPLEX has to be installed, which would only require a minor edit later.

The two pictures should be added to the `thematic_tutotials/` folder. This patch does not pass doctests for two reasons :

* Sage forgets the definition of the variables between different code sections (if you have any idea about how to fix this `^^;`)

* There is a random doctest which should fail every second run, but it is a bit hard to fix with all the previous errors

Sorry to send this patch like that. This may be the last time I can access internet before next week (and I incidentally skipped my second meal today to finish it `:-D`), so if somebody knows how to fix these.. Otherwise, I'll take care of it when I'm back `:-)`

I'm happy with ncohen's tutorial. I have attached a reviewer patch to make it slightly better. Changes include:

* Directly add the two images with `hg add`. This makes sure that the images are under revision control.
* Where possible, cut off lines at about 75 characters.
* Some consistency in how you space headings.
* Some consistency in how you present Sage code.
* Use 4 space indentation.
* Numerous typo fixes.
* Simplify some of the prose to suit a tutorial format.

I need another pair of eyes to check my patch.

Thank you for your patch Minh ! I noticed reviewing it that I had forgotten to rename a variable, ``"poids"``, which means "weight" in french `:-D`
