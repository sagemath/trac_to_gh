The assume function doesn't seem to work with the differential equation solver, despite what the documentation for desolve suggests. This returns an error:

Observed later: ticket #8931 is similar, possibly enough so for this to be considered a duplicate. Also, I misread the documentation:

```
       This equation can be solved within Maxima but not within Sage. It
       needs assumptions assume(x>0,y>0) and works in Maxima, but not in
       Sage:
    
          sage: assume(x>0) # not tested
          sage: assume(y>0) # not tested
          sage: desolve(x*diff(y,x)-x*sqrt(y^2+x^2)-y,y,show_method=True) # not tested
```
So no promise is being made, but nonetheless I think this needs to be fixed.

Yup, and still works.  Definitely same issue as #8931, which now has positive review.  

We could add yet another doctest, but in this case there are already so many tests of it, with another one coming at #8931, that it seems appropriate to simply say this is a dup.  

To release manager: please close this ticket.
