Running `sage -ba` from the shell gives

```
 *** WARNING ***
 You are about to rebuild the entire Sage library.
 This will take a significant amount of time.
 Do you want to proceed? [y/n]
```

Since this waits forever for user input, it is harder to use in non-interactive scripts.  However, there is `sage -ba-force`, which does not wait.  This ticket just adds a note about `-ba-force` to the prompt above.

While looking at this bug, I discovered the -ba-force option, which is exactly what I was looking for.  So I propose a small patch to change the prompt to:

```
 *** WARNING ***
 You are about to rebuild the entire Sage library.
 This will take a significant amount of time.
 (use -ba-force instead of -ba to skip this prompt.)
 Do you want to proceed? [y/n]
```

As far as I'm concerned, we could even complete remove the prompt and make -ba act like -ba-force.  I never quite understood the point of that prompt anyway.
