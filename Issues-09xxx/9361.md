This has been reported on more than one Mac running OSX 10.4 Tiger:

```
$ ./sage -t devel/sage/sage/interfaces/maxima.py
sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/interfaces/maxima.py"
*** *** Error: TIMED OUT! PROCESS KILLED! *** ***

         [361.3 s]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
The following tests failed:


        sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/interfaces/maxima.py" # Time out
Total time for all tests: 361.3 seconds
```
This is because on OS X 10.4, maxima takes a long time (a few seconds to a minute) to process an interrupt.  Sage only waits 2 seconds for an interrupt and thinks that Maxima is stuck.  It naively sends more interrupts which totally lock up Maxima.  The work-around is simply to send only 1 interrupt and wait...

With the patch:

```
$ ./sage -t devel/sage/sage/interfaces/maxima.py
sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/interfaces/maxima.py"
         [129.5 s]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 130.0 seconds

Update: on [this release discussion](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-release/browse_thread/thread/188794c32e110ae2/bc276a98c20d714a) it seems that Macintel does not have this issue anymore:

```

> Georg, I know your processor is faster than mine, but how long did the

Cough, cough, 
not so really long, snippet from "testlong.log": 
sage -t  -long -force_lib "devel/sage/sage/interfaces/maxima.py" 
         [39.7 s] 
There seems to be some strange thing ongoing ... 
```
But it still times out at whatever one chooses on PPC.

I guess somebody discovered the timeout in `maxima.py` and somehow mistakenly assumed it was because of TAB completion.

If the interrupt works properly, the changed timeout doesn't matter.\n\nThis patch does not change the interrupt behaviour of Maxima itself, it only changes how often Sage sends interrupts to Maxima.  On OS X 10.4, Maxima can be interrupted, it is just slow, which makes Sage think that something is wrong.",

Replying to [@kcrisman](#comment%3A5):

I think a patch which adds a new platform to the list of completely supported platforms warrants being "critical".  But that's just my opinion.

That's why I changed the ticket title.  I guess somebody discovered the timeout in `maxima.py` and somehow mistakenly assumed it was because of TAB completion.  Or, in an earlier version there was a problem was TAB-completion on OS X 10.4 which is now fixed.

Assuming that interrupts in Maxima are implemented properly (admittedly, a big "if"), there should not be any change in existing behaviour.  If the interrupt works properly, the changed timeout doesn't matter.

This patch does not change the interrupt behaviour of Maxima itself, it only changes how often Sage sends interrupts to Maxima.  On OS X 10.4, Maxima can be interrupted, it is just slow, which makes Sage think that something is wrong.

Right.

I'll try this when I get a chance - which won't be immediately, still recovering from SD35.5 and an accident incurred during that time.

Dumb question: why the nested try/except instead of two excepts?  Is one better than the other in this case?

Perhaps just uninformed question: In expect.py, we send `'quit;\n'+chr(3)`, but here you only send `chr(3)` (end of text character, says wikipedia).  Does that matter?  I'd think Maxima would like to hear quit, perhaps, but maybe it really just needs this special character to know to quit a computation.

In maxima, "quit;" doesn't really do anything.  You just get

```
(%i1) quit;
(%o1)                                quit
```
In don't understand why `expect.py` sends `quit;` when it needs to interrupt.  Since it doesn't do anything in Maxima, I omitted it.

And `chr(3)` is `CTRL-C`, in other words: the interrupt character.

Great, and I found a few sites that document this to some extent.  It seems that (historically) this was not universal.  Anyway.

I haven't tried this on any other computers.  How could I test this from the command line of Sage?  Presumably with Ctrl-C... that seems to work properly, sometimes I even see the new code in the traceback if I do it at the right time :)

Is that enough for positive review?

I guess that's up to your judgement really.

As for testing it: try using Sage to call Maxima commands and then interrupt that.  But it seems that's would you did, and you didn't manage to break anything.  That's a good sign.

Of course, interrupts are always a bit playing with fire, so I wouldn't be very surprised if this patch broke something in a non-obvious way.

Well, I've tested it on Intel Mac as well and I get different errors but interrupting still seems to work.   It's nontrivial to find things that I can interrupt fast enough!  

There was one weird thing that happened when I repeatedly interrupted and/or let finish the computation

```
sage: y = function('y', x)
sage: desolve(sqrt(y)*diff(y,x)+e^(y)+cos(x)-sin(x+y)==0,y,contrib_ode=True)
```
from the documentation.  This is *not* tested, because it just raises an error (Maxima can't solve it), but in one session I was able to really confuse ECL and kept getting an unbound INFLAG error.  But then I tried to get this again in the next session and, try as I might, I couldn't get it.

So I think this is at least as robust as our previous one.   Or one could compromise with three interrupts and not infinitely many :)

So let's say positive review.

Incidentally, you might find this amusing.
