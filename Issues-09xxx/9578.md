Here's one way to do it, just by changing the tick labels.  There are 
other more flexible ways too: 
sage: import pylab 
sage: pylab.clf() 
sage: p = pylab.pcolor(pylab.rand(2,2)) 
sage: p.axes.get_xticks() # see what ticks are in the plot 
array([ 0. ,  0.5,  1. ,  1.5,  2. ]) 
sage: _=p.axes.set_xticklabels(['0','1000','2000','3000','4000']) 
sage: pylab.savefig('foo.png',dpi=96) 
Or if you just want to multiply each tick label by a certain amount: 
sage: _=p.axes.set_xticklabels([str(i) for i in 1000*p.axes.get_xticks()]) 
sage: pylab.savefig('foo.png',dpi=96) 
Thanks, 
Jason

Yes, I think it would be pretty easy.  Note that matplotlib just added 
some nice convenience functions for dealing with changing the styles of 
ticks too, so we could easy change the colors or weights or whatever as 
well.

We have arbitrary ticks now, and some formatting.  Since this is a little vague, I'm making it be about color.

See also #13078.
