In 4.4.4 the following crashes Sage:

```
sage: K.<b3> = NumberField(x^6 + 15*x^4 + 2*x^3 + 156*x^2 - 48*x + 701)
sage: E = EllipticCurve(K, [0, 1116/38413*b3^5+54/38413*b3^4+20460/38413*b3^3+3222/38413*b3^2+88752/38413*b3-34404/38413, 0, 54/38413*b3^5+3720/38413*b3^4+990/38413*b3^3+29895/38413*b3^2+19164/38413*b3+485313/38413, 0])
sage: E.local_data()
```

Boom!

Here's a simpler example:

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^4-32*x^2+324) # i, sqrt(17)
sage: E = EllipticCurve(K, [0,0,1,-3,-5])
sage: E.local_data(K.ideal(3).factor()[0][0])
```

Again: boom!

It still crashes on my machine after applying the patch.

I thought this had been fixed by #9315 which was merged in 4.6.alpha1, but it is not:

```
sage: version()
'Sage Version 4.6.rc0, Release Date: 2010-10-21'
sage: K.<a> = QuadraticField(5)
sage: R = PolynomialRing(K.ring_of_integers().residue_field(K.ideal(2)), 'x')
sage: R
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Residue field in abar of Fractional ideal (2)
sage: R([1/2*a])
/home/jec/sage-current/local/bin/sage-sage: line 217: 15900 Aborted                 sage-ipython "$@" -i
```
Now of course a/2 cannot be pushed into the residue field, as this (perfectly correct) behaviour shows:

```
sage: R(a/2)    
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ZeroDivisionError                         Traceback (most recent call last)
...
ZeroDivisionError: Cannot reduce field element 1/2*a modulo Fractional ideal (2): it has negative valuation
```

 I tried tracing this through and the crash happens here:

```
> /home/jec/sage-current/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/misc/classcall_metaclass.py(258)__call__()
    257         elif hasattr(cls, "__classcall__"):
--> 258             return cls.__classcall__(cls, *args, **options)
```
after doing lots of stuff which seemed to have little to do with constructing a polynomial (element of R) out of a list of coefficients.

I am CC'ing ylchapuy since I think the code where problems start is in polynomial_zz_pex.pyx which he wrote and which was put into 4.5.3 with #7841 (of which I was one reviewer...)

NOTE:

John, you are *definitely* right that the problem in polynomial coercion is caused by #7841, since by simply switching to not using NTL polynomials the proper behavior is restored:

```
sage: K.<a> = QuadraticField(5)
sage: R = PolynomialRing(K.ideal(2).residue_field(), 'x', implementation='generic')
sage: R([1/2*a])
...
TypeError
```

If ylchapuy doesn't fix this soon, we could revert his PolynomialRing implementation for the next Sage release, if necessary....
But probably the fix isn't too hard (for him -- it might be very hard for me).

polynomial_zz_pex should not be used here.

```
is_FiniteField(base_ring):
```

might be the wrong test because

```
sage: K.ideal(2).residue_field().is_finite()
yes
```

We should change the line 

```
if implementation == "NTL" and is_FiniteField(base_ring):
```
to something appropriate, it should only be used for `PolynomialRing(GF(q))` I guess
