<div id="comment:0"></div>

The method canonical_label() for Graph and DiGraph does not take the parameters 'certify=True' and 'edge_labels=True' at the same time:

```
sage: g = Graph()                                      
sage: g.canonical_label()
Graph on 0 vertices
sage: g.canonical_label(certify=True)
(Graph on 0 vertices, {})
sage: g.canonical_label(edge_labels=True)
Graph on 0 vertices
sage: g.canonical_label(certify=True, edge_labels=True)

...

NameError: global name 'relabeling' is not defined
}}
```

Component: **graph theory**
