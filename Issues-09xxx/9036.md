The method canonical_label() for Graph and DiGraph does not take the parameters 'certify=True' and 'edge_labels=True' at the same time:

```
sage: g = Graph()                                      
sage: g.canonical_label()
Graph on 0 vertices
sage: g.canonical_label(certify=True)
(Graph on 0 vertices, {})
sage: g.canonical_label(edge_labels=True)
Graph on 0 vertices
sage: g.canonical_label(certify=True, edge_labels=True)

...

NameError: global name 'relabeling' is not defined

Hmmm... I am reaallyyyyy sorry but I do not have the slightest idea of what the function "canonical_label" exactly does... Could I ask that your patch also improves its documentation ? :-/

Positive review ! I can now see it was a natural thing to do, but I really didn't feel safe without understanding the function's purpose... :-)

Thank you again !
