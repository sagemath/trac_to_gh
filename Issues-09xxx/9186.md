```
To build R with `SAGE_PARALLEL_SPKG_BUILD="yes"` on Mac OS X, we need to add, e.g.,

```sh
MAKEFLAGS=
export MAKEFLAGS
```
to the "make install" part of the package's `spkg-install`.

Please see #8306 about building spkgs in parallel.  For `MAKEFLAGS`, see [the GNU Make manual](http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Options_002fRecursion.html).
