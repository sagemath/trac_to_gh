John's reviewer patch looks good to me.  Sorry about the iterator business: when I tested that method, I realised that it was broken but for some reason I put [11, blah] instead of the [11..blah] that I intended.  Your revised tests for that also make more sense.

I agree that we want the database installation code to keep working, but I really don't know how/whether we can doctest this.  It's an issue that concerns all the databases so it would be good to have a general solution.  I'd like to ask about this on sage-devel, and if we can get a good method going it can be implemented on a new ticket.

In the meantime, it's better to get the things on this ticket going.
