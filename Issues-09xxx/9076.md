Implementation of arc plot 

This just wraps the matplotlib functionnality Arc
http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/api/artist_api.html#matplotlib.patches.Arc

This can be reviewd together with the ticket #9203 for plotting ellipse. On the latter ticket there is an attached worksheet that does some nice pictures and performs tests for the get_minmax_data function.

Rk: there is not yet fill capabilities (due to matplotlib).

Assignee: @videlec

CC:  sage-combinat @kcrisman @jasongrout

Keywords: plot, arc, ellipse, circle

Resolution: fixed

<a id='comment:7'></a>In general, I like this.  Here are some specific suggestions to make it tip-top.

* line 26 - "an arc", not just "arc"

* There should be some examples for the class def, since that is in reference

* allowed options docs has circle a couple times rather than arc

* The '_repr_' method should have an explanation of radius, maybe even to the point of checking whether it is a circle or an ellipse (and then returning an appropriate string)

* Should be a plot3d method, or open a ticket to add one - though really one could just ape circle.py with x+r*cos(t*dt) and y+r*sin(t*dt) changed appropriately - and if not, then we should test the `NotImplementedError` raised in the base class.

* in arc(), we should have a few changes.  First, a few more of the options should be shown in the examples.  Second, I think a 2-uple is a 2-tuple (?).  Third, clearly the radii don't need to be floats, thought presumably they should be nonnegative.  Next, the sector should be clearly pointed out to be a 2-tuple in the input.

my_arc=arc((1,-2),2,5,-pi/5,(3*pi/2,pi/4),thickness=2)

```

```
my_arc=arc((0,0),2,5,-pi/5,(3*pi/2,pi/4),thickness=2)

          (my_xmax,my_ymin)],rgbcolor='red')
```
Maybe the part of the algorithm that checks whether to use the sector endpoints is too lax?

* The worksheet is REALLY COOL, by the way; I strongly encourage you to add more commentary, turn the graphics into interacts, and advertise it as a great way to use Sage to demonstrate basic uses of parametric calculus!

* With respect to `fmod` - yes, this makes sense to use.  (Otherwise we'd have to document the dummy function!)

* I'd also point out that since you already imported pi from math, there should be no need to float it (? I think?); this happens a lot in this code.

* On a related point, the constructor should be as minimal as possible; why not wait to float the radii etc. until `_render_on_subplot_()` and `get_minmax_data()`?  That would also make the representation string much easier on the eyes (and intelligible).

* Space missing in the sage/plot/plot.py reference

* My sense is that the point of having ``@`rename_keyword(color='rgbcolor')` is so that 

```
sage: arc((0,0), 2, 1, 0, (0,pi/2), color="red") 
```
would work, which is more natural to the user (though I may be misunderstanding the documentation for sage.plot.misc.rename_keyword).   I realize that circle.py doesn't really take advantage of this... and really an rgbcolor should be a 3-tuple, morally speaking... That example doesn't have linestyle='--', incidentally.

* Center should still be 2-tuple, not 2-uple
 
* One may want to point out that alpha refers to transparency.

* Minh will surely point out that we wish uniformity on 2-d, 2D, 2-D, or whatever.  I think the current convention is 2-D, though some docs have 2d or 2D.  But at any rate within a file it should be consistent.

* Again, in the docs for `arc()`, the radii do NOT have to be floats.

* should there be a check for negative radii, like in the patch for ellipse.py?  `arc((1,1),1,-1,pi,(pi/2,pi))` is logically correct but maybe would allow bugs in code of people using `arc` to slip through.

But again all of this takes nothing away from what is in general a great contribution.

There was a mistake... this now works on a lot (all?) examples.

>  * The worksheet is REALLY COOL, by the way; I strongly encourage you to add more commentary, turn the graphics into interacts, and advertise it as a great way to use Sage to demonstrate basic uses of parametric calculus!


I tried to enhanced the worksheet. I do not know what I can do more.

Here, I disagree because all plotting functions convert in the constructor. I do not know why, but for consistency I find it better to do this way. An other argument for this option is to get an error as soon as possible if the constructor is called with wrong argument.

I corrected all the other points in the way you suggested.

This should get in, so here is a hand-edited version.  If this doesn't apply, we'll have to wait for the original author to do it, since I can never get an actual created patch to have someone else's information.  Release manager can revert to positive review if this works.
