Implementation of arc plot 

This just wraps the matplotlib functionnality Arc
http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/api/artist_api.html#matplotlib.patches.Arc

This can be reviewd together with the ticket #9203 for plotting ellipse. On the latter ticket there is an attached worksheet that does some nice pictures and performs tests for the get_minmax_data function.

Rk: there is not yet fill capabilities (due to matplotlib).

<a id='comment:7'>**Comment 7:**</a>
In general, I like this.  Here are some specific suggestions to make it tip-top.

* line 26 - "an arc", not just "arc"

* There should be some examples for the class def, since that is in reference

* allowed options docs has circle a couple times rather than arc

* The '_repr_' method should have an explanation of radius, maybe even to the point of checking whether it is a circle or an ellipse (and then returning an appropriate string)

* Should be a plot3d method, or open a ticket to add one - though really one could just ape circle.py with x+r*cos(t*dt) and y+r*sin(t*dt) changed appropriately - and if not, then we should test the `NotImplementedError` raised in the base class.

* in arc(), we should have a few changes.  First, a few more of the options should be shown in the examples.  Second, I think a 2-uple is a 2-tuple (?).  Third, clearly the radii don't need to be floats, thought presumably they should be nonnegative.  Next, the sector should be clearly pointed out to be a 2-tuple in the input.  Finally, of the two examples shown, the red one isn't!  It would be good to give an explicit example of how angle (as opposed to sector) works, perhaps similarly to the one in get_min_max_data.

I am sorry for the following laundry list.  I want to reiterate that in general this is very nice, but the hope is that this will be the best possible!  Thanks for your patience.

* I think that the current algorithm for the bounding box is not the same as that in the worksheet, which seems to be pretty good.  The ellipse part works; I did find one example where the arc one didn't quite work:

```
my_arc=arc((1,-2),2,5,-pi/5,(3*pi/2,pi/4),thickness=2)
my_d=my_arc[0].get_minmax_data()
my_arc+polygon([(my_d['xmin'],my_d['ymin']),
          (my_d['xmin'],my_d['ymax']),
          (my_d['xmax'],my_d['ymax']),
          (my_d['xmax'],my_d['ymin'])],rgbcolor='red')
```

```
my_arc=arc((0,0),2,5,-pi/5,(3*pi/2,pi/4),thickness=2)
my_xmin,my_ymin,my_xmax,my_ymax=arc_bounding_box(2,5,-pi/5,3*pi/2,pi/4)
my_arc+polygon([(my_xmin,my_ymin),
          (my_xmin,my_ymax),
          (my_xmax,my_ymax),
          (my_xmax,my_ymin)],rgbcolor='red')
```
Maybe the part of the algorithm that checks whether to use the sector endpoints is too lax?

* The worksheet is REALLY COOL, by the way; I strongly encourage you to add more commentary, turn the graphics into interacts, and advertise it as a great way to use Sage to demonstrate basic uses of parametric calculus!

* With respect to `fmod` - yes, this makes sense to use.  (Otherwise we'd have to document the dummy function!)

* I'd also point out that since you already imported pi from math, there should be no need to float it (? I think?); this happens a lot in this code.

* On a related point, the constructor should be as minimal as possible; why not wait to float the radii etc. until `_render_on_subplot_()` and `get_minmax_data()`?  That would also make the representation string much easier on the eyes (and intelligible).

* Space missing in the sage/plot/plot.py reference

* My sense is that the point of having `@rename_keyword(color='rgbcolor')` is so that 

```
sage: arc((0,0), 2, 1, 0, (0,pi/2), color="red") 
```
would work, which is more natural to the user (though I may be misunderstanding the documentation for sage.plot.misc.rename_keyword).   I realize that circle.py doesn't really take advantage of this... and really an rgbcolor should be a 3-tuple, morally speaking... That example doesn't have linestyle='--', incidentally.

* Center should still be 2-tuple, not 2-uple
 
* One may want to point out that alpha refers to transparency.

* Minh will surely point out that we wish uniformity on 2-d, 2D, 2-D, or whatever.  I think the current convention is 2-D, though some docs have 2d or 2D.  But at any rate within a file it should be consistent.

* Again, in the docs for `arc()`, the radii do NOT have to be floats.

* should there be a check for negative radii, like in the patch for ellipse.py?  `arc((1,1),1,-1,pi,(pi/2,pi))` is logically correct but maybe would allow bugs in code of people using `arc` to slip through.

But again all of this takes nothing away from what is in general a great contribution.

There was a mistake... this now works on a lot (all?) examples.

> * The worksheet is REALLY COOL, by the way; I strongly encourage you to add more commentary, turn the graphics into interacts, and advertise it as a great way to use Sage to demonstrate basic uses of parametric calculus!

I tried to enhanced the worksheet. I do not know what I can do more.

Here, I disagree because all plotting functions convert in the constructor. I do not know why, but for consistency I find it better to do this way. An other argument for this option is to get an error as soon as possible if the constructor is called with wrong argument.

I corrected all the other points in the way you suggested.
