Why has CPLEX been removed from some tags and not others?

Cplex has been left where it was explicitely required : for the method solve_cplex for example, which is only compiled when CBC has been compiled with Cplex itself.

Its other occurences are of a different kind : I named it as it was one of the three solver available, though there is no way to install Cplex in Sage without installing Cbc before :-)

Thank you Robert !!!

Nathann

You're right, I mixed this up here (but I think I got it right on #9272).

Right, my question is whether we should put a comment about this at the top of the affected files, or do we just trust people to know how to use "-only-optional"?

I think this flag probably still belongs in `mip_cplex.pyx`, if no place else.  Someone might have CPLEX installed separately from Sage, and having a mechanism to test is not a bad idea.  ("optional" tags don't need to correspond to packages, like `# optional - internet` or `# optional - Mathematica`.)

Hmmm.... It looks like I was much less attentive to this patch than you were O_o

Actually, I just trusted the problem was that an #optional comment must only contain this very keyword, followed by the names of the packages, and that this motivated the whole patch.

Just in case you wonder, when I write patches using LP, I usually use -optional without any argument, so that all optional packages are tested. Besides, I do not like to see all the optional flags pass successfully the first time (exactly because I do nt know if all of them were tested), so when it happens I usually change the result of a command to see whether Sage "sees" it :-)

Do yo think this patch needs to be modified, John ?

I'm guessing that you have either GLPK or CBC installed, or both.  Could you just test that "sage -t -only-optional=glpk,cbc ..." works on the affected files?  In more detail:

- "sage -t -only-optional=glpk ..."  should finish instantly, because it shouldn't run any tests.

- "sage -t -only-optional=glpk,cbc  ..."  should *not* finish instantly, and all tests should pass.

I've checked this without GLPK and CBC installed, and the second of these fails a bunch of tests, as it should.
