Some doctests in sage/homology/tests.py are marked `# optional - CHomP` (or they should be marked this way: see #9270 and #9271).  Running `sage -t -only-optional=chomp tests.py` runs those tests, but running `sage -t -only-optional=CHomP tests.py` does not.

Here's a patch for the scripts repo.  During parsing, the line being doctested gets converted to lower-case (line 245 in sage-doctest), but the arguments for "-only-optional" were not being converted.  The patch fixes this.
