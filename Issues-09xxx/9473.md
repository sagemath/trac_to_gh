The execute bit is set on some pickles in sage_notebook.sagenb for no reason:

```

executable bit set?  huh?

sage: !ls -l
total 28
-rwx------  1 sagenb sagenb   253 2010-07-06 00:52 conf.pickle
drwxr-xr-x 39 sagenb sagenb  4096 2010-05-22 08:58 home

```

Fix this.   This is probably really easy.   I think the notebook server does a chmod somewhere to make sure other and group don't have access, and this is done incorrectly.
