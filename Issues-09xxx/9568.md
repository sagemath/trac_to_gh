As noted at #9309, the IML library is not current in Sage, and spkg-install could be improved somewhat. 

Duplicate of #748.

This is going to be a fun one, since the upstream source tree is not vanilla. Some files have been patched "in-place", others have been added, and (/but?) there's even a Mercurial repository in it (added by Sage)... :)

I'll take a closer look within the next days.

(I can't change the milestone to 4.6!)

We should also consider whether this package can be built in parallel, so replacing `make` with `$MAKE`. I just built the **current** version 1.0.1) ten times in parallel, using `$MAKE` rather than `make`. It reduced the build time from 13 s to 8 s on my Sun Ultra 27, so hardly a huge benefit.

Perhaps not that hard, but do we want to keep the repository?

Also, the "new" 1.0.3 version (from 2008) brings new functionality, so additions/changes to the Sage library are likely.

I started with a vanilla 1.0.3, "cleaned up" `spkg-install` (dropping all patches and the Debian stuff) and just looked what happens...
(I configured with `--prefix=$SAGE_LOCAL --enable-shared` and added the appropriate (Sage) dirs to the preprocessor and linker search paths.)

For a Sage build from scratch, we need to change `deps` s.t. IML again(?) depends on ATLAS rather than GSL. Or is ATLAS still(?) considered optional on some systems?

Then I only added a patch for `src/src/nullspace.c`, which uses `mpz_init_ui()` instead of `mpz_init_set_ui()`.

:-)

(Still alpha, though. Looking for what else to carry over.)

**Attachment:** [iml-1.0.1.p12.log.txt](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9568/iml-1.0.1.p12.log.txt)

I just rebuilt version 1.0.1 in a loop 100 times. It failed to build once in that 100 times! (That's two failures in total I have observed of this).

Actually on sage-on-gentoo we have been using iml-1.0.3 for a while.
But on some setups we have been hit by a doc test failure which seem
to point to iml: 

```
sage -t -force_lib "devel/sage/sage/modular/modsym/space.py"

And the line called in matrix_rational_dense.pyx is:

```
            K = A._rational_kernel_iml().change_ring(QQ)
```
The tests for matrix_rational_dense.pyx pass.
There is a backtrace as well here: [http://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/issues#issue/3](http://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/issues#issue/3)

Found out what the issue was in my previous comment. It is not related to iml per see.
There is a bug somewhere in ATLAS-3.9.23 which is the version we currently default on in Gentoo. Using another cblas with iml make the issue disappear completely.
So as far as we know iml-1.0.3 works fine with sage.
