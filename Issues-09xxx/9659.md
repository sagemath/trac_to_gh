The correct mathematical result is an exact 0,  obtained as a 2x2 determinant of the form [a,0; 0,0]:

```
sage: EK.height_pairing_matrix([P,T])
[     1.41516132073186 -1.11022302462516e-16]
[-1.11022302462516e-16     0.000000000000000]
```
I think the best way to get a machine-independent test here is to have

```
sage: EK.regulator_of_points([P,T]).abs() < 1e30
True
```
instead of putting the spurious small value into the doctest.

The patch does this (as well as leaving the original test with a #random tag).

If you have a better suggestion, just do it.  Any specific numerical result will change with the new pari anyway.

The height of a torsion point is already exactly 0.  We could add more special cases for the regulator of two points P,Q that if either P or Q or P-Q were torsion then the regulator is 0, but as the necessary condition is that some linear combination n*P+m*Q=0 no such code would catch all these special cases.

P.S.: I just meant 1<sup>-30</sup> instead of 1<sup>30</sup> (as Mitesh noted, too).

OK, my mistake -- I have updated the patch so it now says 1e-30.

The optimization change will effect this a lot.   The optimization flag on a pari build was downgraded a while back for a silly reason; and upped again on the ticket upgrading pari.  This will effect all the number field code.

That looks reasonable to me.

As a matter of interest, [I asked on gcc-help about the use of -O1 and -O3](http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-help/2010-07/msg00190.html). To quote from someone who I believe is a gcc developer

''The -O3 optoin should be safe for correct code.  An important difference between -O2/-O3 and -O1 is that -O2 and -O3 enable strict aliasing and strict overflow.  Those options provide better optimization for correct code, but are far more likely to cause unexpected code generation for incorrect code.  See the -fstrict-aliasing and -fstrict-overflow
options.'' 

''The main difference between -O3 and -O2 is that -O3 enables more
speculative optimizations.  These should not miscompile your code, but
they may cause your program to run more slowly.''

It's not to me whether -O2 or -O3 is the better choice. You might find -O2 is actually faster than -O3!

IMHO, we really do need set of benchmark results. 

But the patch looks quite reasonable to me. The [IEEE 754 standard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754-2008) does not guarantee that different systems implementing IEEE 754 maths will give the same result. Nor is there anything to say that any two different processors from Intel will give the same result. 

Since the correct result should be 0.0, a test that expected a number like -1.23259516440783e-32  was clearly flawed. 

Positive review. 

Dave
