Sage currently has workarounds against building an incompatible libreadline on openSuSE 11.1 and Arch Linux - instead of building it, the system version is copied.

The SuSE workaround should be applied to openSuSE 11.2 and 11.3, too. Furthermore, SuSE offers libreadline.so.5 in addition to .so.6, so we only copy .6.

The workaround on Arch Linux is unreliable, as it detects Arch Linux by "-ARCH" in the kernel version (which is the default, but might be different). Instead, the presence of /etc/arch-release should be used to determine that.

I am attaching a patch that fixes those problems and changes 'cp' to 'cp -a' to not turn a symlink into a file. Without this patch, sage fails to build on my SuSE or Arch systems.

Is it actually worth fixing the workarounds?  It seems like upgrading readline (#9523) wouldn't be much more work, and then we could probably just remove the workarounds.

It might fix the problem for now. And when the system readline is upgraded again, everything is broken again.

I don't like that situation that sage wants to build its own version of libreadline - in my opinion it causes more problems than it solves. As long as sage wants to use its own readline version in favor of the system library, this problem will never fully go away.

What if you used symlinks to the native libreadline instead of copying it?

So instead of:

cp -a /lib64/libreadline.so.6* "$SAGE_LOCAL"/lib
cp -a /lib/libreadline.so.6* "$SAGE_LOCAL"/lib
cp -r /usr/include/readline  "$SAGE_LOCAL"/include 
cp /lib/libreadline.so.* "$SAGE_LOCAL"/lib 
cp -a /lib/libreadline.so.6* "$SAGE_LOCAL"/lib 

It does:

ln -s /lib64/libreadline.so.6* "$SAGE_LOCAL"/lib
ln -s /lib/libreadline.so.6* "$SAGE_LOCAL"/lib
ln -s /usr/include/readline  "$SAGE_LOCAL"/include
ln -s /lib/libreadline.so.* "$SAGE_LOCAL"/lib 
ln -s /lib/libreadline.so.6* "$SAGE_LOCAL"/lib 

This should avoid the problem with upgrades changing libreadline again, and will save a little space.

Yes, that is the problem.  As it stand now, Sage 4.6 will be released without being able to build as-is on a major distribution and won't build reliably on another.  We have a small, simple, low-risk fix available right now.  I think it would be good to incorporate the fix now rather than pushing it back again.

I think having it build successfully on the current version of major distributions would be a worthwhile goal for 4.6.  Optimizing that could wait until later.

And that is assuming #9523 isn't bushed back again.  It was originally a 4.6 blocker.

Despite trying - see for example 

http://wiki.sagemath.org/suggested-for-supported-platforms

I've never managed to get any agreement on what is "supported". But it we believe README.txt, both ArchLinux and !OpenSUSE are supported. However, in my opinion we should not hold a release of Sage just because on Linux distro has bought at yet another backwards incompatible version. But if a change in Sage has broken one of these systems, then I think it should be addressed in 4.6. But if the breakages are caused by updated versions of Linux, then I think these systems will just have to accept that.

You don't understand the problem at all. Sage overrides the system libreadline with an older version, one that lacks features that the system shell requires. This is a problem that affects EVERY Linux distribution that is not terribly outdated (if I would say "it doesn't build on Ubuntu", you would probably suddenly take this seriously, but as long as it works on Ubuntu, it can't be not broken, right? It's not Ubuntu, so I have to keep repeating myself, until the problem eventually also affects Ubuntu)

As long as sage does not build its own shell for the build process, overriding the system libreadline is simply plain stupid, and will keep breaking again and again. In my opinion, sage should not ship its own libreadline if the system already provides readline version 6 or newer - eliminating all the mentioned problems.

However, neither is the case here.\n\nThe breakage first appeared in openSUSE 11.2, which was released almost a year ago.  openSUSE 11.3, which also has the problem, was released over 3 months ago.  So it is a long-standing issue.\n\nFurther, a fix is available, and has been for over 3 months now (shortly after openSUSE 11.3 was released).  The fix was published several weeks before sage 4.5.2 was released, over a month and a half before 4.5.3.\n\nSo this is a long-standing issue for which a fix has been available for a while.  Given that, I do not think holding 4.6 until the existing fix has been incorporated is outlandish.",

> > Yes, that is the problem.  As it stand now, Sage 4.6 will be released without being able to build as-is on a major distribution and won't build reliably on another.

> I've never managed to get any agreement on what is "supported". But it we believe README.txt, both ArchLinux and !OpenSUSE are supported. However, in my opinion we should not hold a release of Sage just because on Linux distro has bought at yet another backwards incompatible version. But if a change in Sage has broken one of these systems, then I think it should be addressed in 4.6. But if the breakages are caused by updated versions of Linux, then I think these systems will just have to accept that. 


I agree we should not hold a release because of the lack of a fix for a new break caused by the distribution. However, neither is the case here.

The breakage first appeared in openSUSE 11.2, which was released almost a year ago.  openSUSE 11.3, which also has the problem, was released over 3 months ago.  So it is a long-standing issue.

Further, a fix is available, and has been for over 3 months now (shortly after openSUSE 11.3 was released).  The fix was published several weeks before sage 4.5.2 was released, over a month and a half before 4.5.3.

So this is a long-standing issue for which a fix has been available for a while.  Given that, I do not think holding 4.6 until the existing fix has been incorporated is outlandish.

You can add your name to http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/wiki#AccountNamesmappedtoRealNames

If you'd been listed there, I would perhaps have created a new spkg from your patch.

Unfortunately, the ticket hadn't been set to "needs review", there are apparently only a few Sage *developers* dealing with OpenSuSE, and there hasn't been activity on the ticket for a while.

If somebody provides a patch, the status should be changed from "new" to "needs review" (by the author / the one that uploaded a patch).

> It is one thing if developers do not fix a problem because they cannot reproduce it.  But the patch was available and just sat here.  Further, it is a patch for a "major" issue.


"major" is the default priority. It should perhaps have been at least critical. Also, the title doesn't suggest higher importance (it's "improve...", which doesn't sound like fixing a major bug).

> Shouldn't such patches receive particular attention from developers?


It's more likely that people search for tickets e.g. needing review, or "new" ones that are marked "crtitical" or "blocker".

> > and there hasn't been activity on the ticket for a while.

See above. Posting just "ping" on the ticket also causes attention by those people involved (owner, reporter, cc'ed people and everyone who commented on a ticket, at least if they have e-mail notification enabled, which should be the case for most, if not all).

Also, I haven't seen recent build [failure] reports regarding OpenSuSE and that issue on sage-release, which is another way to bring back attention.

Florent's post on sage-release (and incidentally? Dave's activity on #9530) brought me back to this.

I  believe the `cp -a` will only be executed on Linux, so it's not a massive problem here, but note that is note that `-a` is not an option defined by POSIX, so is unportable and will break on some systems. Was there a good reason for using `-a`? Unless there was, it would be good to get into the habbit of using a more portable alternative - I suspect `-p` would have done the job here. 

As always, one can get an alphabetical list of the commands at:

http://opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908799/idx/index.html

and in particular for 'cp':

http://opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908799/xcu/cp.html

Note the **only** portable options are `-f`, `-i`, `-p` , `-r` and `-R`.

Sounds reasonable, but we'd have to take care of that when building binary distributions (`./sage -bdist`), too, since the build system might have a (suitable) system libreadline, but we cannot assume every target system (where a bdist gets installed) to also have it.

In general, I'd like to not (ship and) build Sage-specific versions of basic tools and libraries like readline (at least by default), but that's a long-lasting discussion and there are different reasons to do so for each individual package.

The situation with readline and bash is even more specific, since it's IMHO a bad idea to dynamically link the system shell against it, which is only the case on OpenSuSE and Arch. But it's also the readline developers' fault, because they changed the library's interface without bumping the version number.

Linking the shell dynamically, as far as I know, has been readline's default for a long time - other distributions just still use libreadline.so.5 for this.

> But it's also the readline developers' fault, because they changed the library's interface without bumping the version number.


You are wrong, this is standard and expected behaviour, at least in the GNU ld world. Increasing the library SONAME version is only required when a binary compiled against an older library version will fail to work with a newer version.

In this case, a binary (bash) compiled against a newer library version does not work with an older library version. This is normal and will be the case with all system libraries, even the C library in some cases. The reason is simple: Nobody ever downgrades system libraries.

No, at least some *statically* link bash against readline, which is much safer.

In principle, the opposite (a binary requiring some newer version) is the more common use case.

> In this case, a binary (bash) compiled against a newer library version does not work with an older library version. This is normal and will be the case with all system libraries, even the C library in some cases.


Yes, and *that* should be catched as well, see above. Therefore one keeps older library versions installed, with a different "name". But here, both are "6.0", or worse, the soname recorded as required by bash simply contains the major number, "6".

This will frequently happen when people install dynamically linked executables (or even libraries) built on newer systems; usually a packet manager will take care of also installing the needed libraries, but not all programs come as packages. into which more specific dependencies are coded.

`[ `uname -p` = "x86_64" ]` isn't portable either, this might give "unknown" even on Linux; `uname -m` should be better.

Also, I think `ln -s ...` should be `ln -snf ...` (or at least `ln -sf ...`).

Note also that the '`n`' option to '`ln`' is not portable either. 

http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/ln.html

I'd be very weary of using non-portable options, even on Linux, as there have been reports of some of the cut-down linux distributions failing to recognise some of the unportable options. See for example #8566, where the '`m`' option to  '`tar`' is failing on a minimal linux distribution. I should remove that option, as it is totally unnecessary in the bit of code that uses it. 

I would at least comment any such non-portable code.

I've installed openSUSE 11.3, but hit a problem in that g++ is called g++-4.5. Since I know setting CXX is unreliable in Sage, I need to mess around creating links to call it g++. I wish Sage would respect values for CC and CXX. Currently setting those will work for some packages, but not all of them.

I just got this on openSUSE 11.3

```
Deleting old readline headers and libs
OpenSuSE detected
OpenSuSE 11 detected
No readline headers found. Please install OpenSuSE's development
version of libreadline 6.x since building the version currently
shipped with Sage would break your shell (bash). Sorry.

real    0m0.010s
user    0m0.004s

sage: An error occurred while installing readline-6.0.p4
```

so I'll follow the instructions. 

Why do people keep calling this openSuSE? It was in the title, and now I see it in Leif's comments. According to the openSUSE web page, it is openSUSE.

FYI, 

```
$ sudo zypper install readline-devel
```

installs the headers, and allows sqlite to build, which I think was the program that was causing problems. I'm just installing this, but like an idiot I only allocated one CPU to the virtual machine, not 8. It might be quicker to shut down and allocate more CPUs to the virtual machine.

Oh, I noticed that. It's because openSUSE started as SuSE Linux, a distribution created by the S.u.S.E. GmbH (the "u" meaning "&", German "und", since the "S"s stand for the given names of the founders of the company, which happened to be siblings).

W.r.t. `ln -a` and `-n`:

I really wonder if we should make GNU coreutils (and perhaps some more) prerequisites for Sage (or even ship coreutils as an spkg), since there seems to be not much progress with POSIX commands.

Or build at least some of our own commands (as part of the scripts spkg).

`sed -i` is also quite useful, though one can relatively easily work around that, in contrast to other not-yet-POSIX features of some other commands.

At least Sage being cross-platform encourages developers to think about portability. I'm sure it has contributed to the education of many. 

BTW, I don't see the need to copy the readline files to $SAGE_LOCAL - why not create links? It saves disk space and CPU cycles.

Would it help to build with `SAGE_FAT_BINARY=yes`?

Despite being unable to check this fully, I'm going to give it a positive review. 

I'm sure Leif has checked it builds on his Linux. I've checked it builds on OpenSolaris and Solaris. I've also checked it builds on openSUSE 11.3, though I was unable to build on openSUSE fully, as ATLAS would not build - totally unrelated to this. 

Looking at #9523, I can see the old readline was causing issues with building sqlite. I can confirm there are no issues building sqlite on openSUSE any more. 

I don't have access to ArchLinux and can't be bothered to install it, but in any case that's not a supported platform. 

I do wish people would not use `grep -q` though - as it will break on Solaris. 

So I think given all this, I'm reasonably confident this is OK. I can't possibly imagine it would break any supported platform.

It did not help. I also tried unsetting MAKE - again no help. 

I've not managed to build ATLAS on Debian either in a virtual machine. I have the latest version of VirtualBox. I did wonder if I loaded the machine up, so the CPU usage was high, if this would increase the times and so hopefully get non-zero values.

You could perhaps steal an ATLAS library from Florent, if you don't care about its performance.

> I do wish people would not use `grep -q` though - as it will break on Solaris.


I really think Sage users on [Open]Solaris should set up their path to have the POSIX versions first in it. Sage's `configure` could check that. (Or we could modify `PATH` in `sage-env` accordingly.)
