I'm changing the component to `symbolics`, since this is probably a bug in pynac.

Regarding the problem with the output Carl mentions in [comment:2](#comment%3A2): This is also present in GiNaC, but the printing is better:

```

Type ?? for a list of help topics.
> a=(sqrt(4*(sqrt(3) - 5)*(sqrt(3) + 5) + 48) + 4*sqrt(3))/ (sqrt(3) + 5);
(sqrt(48+4*(5+sqrt(3))*(-5+sqrt(3)))+4*sqrt(3))*(5+sqrt(3))^(-1)
> imag_part(a);
(5+sqrt(3))^(-1)*sqrt(abs(48+4*(5+sqrt(3))*(-5+sqrt(3))))*sin(1/2*atan2(0,48+4*(-22)))
```

Note the term `4*(-22)` at the end of the last line.

We should open a new ticket for this and report it on the GiNaC list. I'm not sure if this has anything to do with this ticket ATM. Numeric evaluation seems to work fine in GiNaC:

```

0.9394693387082032295

This issue was fixed upstream by Richard Kreckel.

While the fix makes the original example on this ticket work, Jason's example from [comment:1](#comment%3A1) or the one reported by Tian Wei on sage-support (below) still don't work.

```
sage: b = sqrt(-log(2))
sage: print b.imag().n()
0.832554611157698*sin(0.500000000000000*pi)
