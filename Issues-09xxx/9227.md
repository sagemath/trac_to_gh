Doctests fail due to there being TAB characters in this patch.

I've added an updated patch, which replaces the TAB characters in the patch with spaces, as well as changing line 650:
`'kilometer':'Equal to 1000 meters.\nEqual to 1000 meters.',`
to
`'kilometer':'Equal to 1000 meters.\nEqual to 3280.8399 feet.',`
