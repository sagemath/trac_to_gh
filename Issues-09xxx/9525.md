Whilst trying to locate a bug causing a 64-bit build of Sage on Solaris to be unstable, I found that cvxopt will always report it has successfully installed, even if it does not. The last line in `spkg-install` is

```
python setup.py install
```

with no error checking.

Note that #6456 has been merged; can this be closed (i.e., was it in fact fixed in that spkg) once that receives positive review?
