The results are a little scruffy in places, but that will be much easier to sort out once the modules have been added and people can see the results!

No, there is no need to do this. The functions from those modules are all imported into quadratic__form.py; they are divided into separate modules solely in order to keep the size of the top-level file manageable. The ReST parser follows these imports, so adding the separate files to the manual as well would just mean everything was in there twice.

Thanks for the review, anyway!
