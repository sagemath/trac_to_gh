Here's a new patch, against 4.5.2.rc0, incorporating Anna's work and extending it by adding the modules `count_local_2` and `special_values`. 

The results are a little scruffy in places, but that will be much easier to sort out once the modules have been added and people can see the results!

I'm OK with the attachment [attachment: trac_9383_v4.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9383/trac_9383_v4.patch.gz). Note that it adds the following modules to the reference manual:

```
sage/quadratic_forms/quadratic_form 
sage/quadratic_forms/binary_qf 
sage/quadratic_forms/constructions 
sage/quadratic_forms/random_quadraticform 
sage/quadratic_forms/special_values 
sage/quadratic_forms/count_local_2
```

The attachment make numerous ReST changes to the following modules, but does not add them to the reference manual:

```

No, there is no need to do this. The functions from those modules are all imported into quadratic__form.py; they are divided into separate modules solely in order to keep the size of the top-level file manageable. The ReST parser follows these imports, so adding the separate files to the manual as well would just mean everything was in there twice.

Thanks for the review, anyway!

David
