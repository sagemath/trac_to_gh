If we did this, then we could maybe just eliminate the "Print" button?  I don't know; maybe.

See the following excerpt from http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_frm/thread/98969b6b9035bf6d/3c5d4c2647e974b7 for a discussion of how to do this:

It's pretty easy to specify a print css sheet using CSS "media"
constructs.  The browser then automatically uses this CSS when printing,
but uses your normal CSS when displaying.  A user shouldn't have to hit
a special Sage print button to print.

Yeah, I know, "Implement it and send a patch" :).  Well, if someone gets
to it before me, here are a few references:

See http://www.yourhtmlsource.com/stylesheets/cssmediatypes.html or for
the spec, see http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/media.html.  See also

suggestions/tips.
