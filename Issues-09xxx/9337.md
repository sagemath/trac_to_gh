Divisor-related files in schemes/generic were the ones that I didn't look at before, but they turn out to be quite short and simple, especially in the relevant "truly generic" part. I think we should try to use them (preferably without putting toric code into those files, I found it rather inconvenient how service-classes of different schemes and spaces are mixed in old files).

The general framework uses formal sums for the divisor group. Your patch is likely to be more efficient, since it works with a finite rank subgroup of the divisor group, but it does not support divisors on toric varieties that are not toric. Would it be possible to implement instead primitive toric divisors (i.e. those given by "z_i=0") and work with their formal sums as elements of the total divisor group?

If that would be too inconvenient, it would be nice at least to have some class representing the group of torus-invariant divisors with the coercion into the general divisor group.

I did rename `coeff()`->`coefficient()`. Since it is only half-implemented for curves anyways I thought we can get away with it :-)  I'll add a depreciation warning.

I created a tracker bug at #9604 to for the patch queue/dependencies.

<div id="comment:9" align="right">comment:9</div>

I went over the first patch and it looks great except for the following minor points:

* The name of the argument in this function is confusing. Since such functions take anything as input, I vote for something neutral like `x`:

 ```
 def is_DivisorGroup(divisor):
     ...
```

* In `_element_constructor_(self, x, check=True, reduce=True)` the last line is

 ```
 return Divisor_generic([(self.base_ring()(1), x)], check=False, reduce=False, parent=self)
```
 Why in this case `check` and `reduce` are set to `False` instead of using the passed values?

* As I understood the documentation of `UniqueRepresentation`, derived classes should not have default values in `__init__`, because it leads to this:

 ```
 sage: from sage.structure.formal_sum import FormalSums_generic
 sage: FormalSums_generic(ZZ) is FormalSums_generic()
 False
```
 Note, however,

 ```
 sage: FormalSums(ZZ) is FormalSums()
 True
```
 since each layer repeats default values and the default in the actual class is never used (unless you do it directly as I have done it above). This brings me to the last comment:

* Is there any need in factory functions now that they just call the class? Before they were necessary since they were providing caching/uniqueness, but your new approach is cleaner and more unified (leading to "unique unique representation" ;-)).

Nothing can go wrong (knock on wood) in Divisor_generic([(self.base_ring()(1), x)]) and it cannot be reduced, so I manually set `check=False`, `reduce=False`. The same was already in `FormalSums_generic.__call__()` before I converted it to `_element_constructor_()`:

```
return FormalSum([(self.base_ring()(1), x)], check=False, reduce=False, parent=self)
```
But if you don't like this optimization I can take it out.

About `UniqueFactory` vs. `UniqueRepresentation`, I guess you answered your own question: If you want default arguments then you need an explicit factory. Otherwise you can just use `UniqueRepresentation`, which is its own factory.

I am fine with the optimization, I just didn't quite get it before.

Default arguments can work with `UniqueRepresentation`, they just require more work. http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/sage/structure/unique_representation.html, section "Argument preprocessing." It was quite interesting to read it, I didn't know about this class before I saw it in your patch.

My question is not about necessity of `UniqueFactory`, but about necessity of both `FormalSums` and `FormalSums_generic`. It think that after your refactoring the answer is no.

Some comments on "trac_9337_toric_divisors.patch" (I didn't go through all of it yet).

Little ones:
1. Can we change printing from `The divisor x+y` to `Divisor x+y`? Such a form seems to be more common in Sage (and saves 4 characters ;-))
2. It seems to me that the new module contains unnecessary imports (e.g. `LatticePolytope`) and I think it is better to import only necessary things so that it is clear what does this module depend on.
3. Line 138, description of OUTPUT in `ngens` seems to be left from some other text.
4. The last part of example for `ToricVariety.divisor()` is confusing. Can you add a comment in the documentation what exactly it should demonstrate? Why there are two copies of the corresponding ray printed for each divisor?

More global one:
1. I don't quite understand if `ToricDivisorGroup` is supposed to be a group of T-Weil divisors only (as its documentation states) or of all (Weil) divisors as it prints and somewhat works:

 ```
 sage: P2 = toric_varieties.P2()
 sage: P2.coordinate_ring().inject_variables()
 Defining x, y, z
 sage: G = P2.divisor_group()
 sage: G
 Group of ZZ-Divisors on 2-d CPR-Fano toric variety covered by 3 affine patches
 sage: print G(x)
 The divisor x
 sage: print G(x+y)
 None
```
 Is the last line supposed to raise an error (since `x+y` does not define a T-divisor), or return some other divisor object of a different class than `x`? The current behaviour certainly seems to be a bug to me.

I think that ideally there should be a separate group of T-Weil divisors with divisor classes having lifts to this group. This group probably should not derive from `DivisorGroup_generic`, but rather should have a coercion map to it and both T-Weil and Weil groups should be accessible from toric varieties. This way the divisor associated to "x" will have two representation (one is likely to be more efficient and relevant for computations) while "x+y" will have only a generic one. What do you think?

The `ToricDivisorGroup` is the group of T-Weil divisors. They are `FormalSums` of monomials, whereas a `Divisor_generic` is a formal sum of (homogeneous) polynomials. A `ToricDivisor_generic` is a valid element of its base class `Divisor_generic`, but not the other way round. If you want non-toric divisors then you can already do

```

sage: Div = DivisorGroup(toric_varieties.dP6()); Div

sage: Div(x^2+u)   # does not know how to check homogeneity
x^2 + u
sage: type(_)

```
The `ToricDivisorGroup` should probably print `Group of toric ZZ-Weil divisors` to be more explicit. I was trying to not print "T-Weil divisor" all the time in the output to make things easier to read. I'll change the `ToricDivisorGroup` output but leave its elements as "Divisor x", if in doubt you can always use `parent()` or `type()` to find out what you are working with.

I don't see much use to have separate `ToricVariety_field.divisor_group()` and `.toric_divisor_group()` methods, I think newcomers would only be tempted into constructing the generic divisor group and then be disappointed that there is no toric functionality there. 

In your last line, `G(x+y)` should have returned `G(x)+G(y)`, that is, linear polynomials get converted to the analogous sum of T-Weil divisors, but you found a bug. Although this is potentially dangerous it provides a useful shorthand to define the T-Weil divisors.

Replying to [@vbraun](#comment:16):
> The `ToricDivisorGroup` should probably print `Group of toric ZZ-Weil divisors` to be more explicit. I was trying to not print "T-Weil divisor" all the time in the output to make things easier to read. I'll change the `ToricDivisorGroup` output but leave its elements as "Divisor x", if in doubt you can always use `parent()` or `type()` to find out what you are working with.

Agreed, I think that parents should be more or less descriptive in their `_repr_`, since usually they are looked at by themselves, but elements should try to be compact since they are likely to be used in groups.

> I don't see much use to have separate `ToricVariety_field.divisor_group()` and `.toric_divisor_group()` methods, I think newcomers would only be tempted into constructing the generic divisor group and then be disappointed that there is no toric functionality there. 

I think that for most people who know what a divisor is it would be strange that `divisor_group` does not allow working with general divisors. As an alternative to having two groups, we can have `Divisor_of_toric_variety` class which behaves like `generic` but has a method `self.toric()` and when this is true, then certain other methods are accessible. On the other hand, in the context of general divisors it does not make much sense to talk about generators, while for T-divisors it is very useful and natural. So this is an argument for having a separate group. Names, perhaps, should be chosen as `divisor_group`, `divisor_group_toric`, maybe later even `divisor_group_Cartier` etc. This will group all these groups ;-) together in the documentation and TAB-completion, so it will be easy to see that these things exist and names should be clear enough for all people who can use them.

Bottom line: I am against calling the group of T-divisors just `divisor_group` and I think that access to all divisor groups should be uniform (e.g. without explicit calls to `DivisorGroup` as in your example above) and they should always be more special than generic (e.g. there is already a way to check homogeneity of polynomials  in homogeneous coordinates, but as you have demonstrated, a generic divisor group was not able to use this functionality).

I am VERY against interpreting `G(x+y)` as `G(x)+G(y)` because the latter one IS `G(x*y)`. If one wants additive behaviour, it is better to inject generators of the divisor group and write such sums explicitly in terms of divisors rather than coordinates.

Replying to [@vbraun](#comment:18):
> About the `divisor_group_*` methods, I agree with your argument but I also hate to give the longer name to the most useful method. And I don't want to introduce a unified parent for divisors, the current inheritance tree fits OOP as well as mathematics nicely. So I propose the following, we'll have only one `divisor_group` method 


 ```
   def divisor_group(divisors='T-Weil', base_ring=ZZ):
```
 That'll easily generalize to any other notion of divisor that one might want to introduce and, by default, returns the most useful case for toric varieties.

One solution to long names is to introduce aliases in the spirit of recent cohomology patches. That is direct reflection of mathematical conventions where you can name a thing either "in words" or using some special combination of symbols.

In principle, I am OK with passing divisor type as an argument, but this way makes it impossible to use TAB-completion and involves actually more typing. So we can keep it if you want, but I'd rather not.

My main objection however, is that "divisor group" is still used to refer to "**toric** divisor group" and these are mathematically different. So if we do keep only `divisor_group` method, the default behaviour should be returning the group of general divisors. This is probably inconvenient, but I am definitely not OK with the current default.

Returning to my first point, how about the following names (all take one optional parameter `base_ring`):
* `X.divisor_group()` -- returns the general group of Weil divisors on `X`;
* `X.Div()` -- the same, done by `Div = divisor_group` in the class definition;
* `X.toric_divisor_group()` -- returns the group of T-Weil divisors, which is the one providing actual toric functionality;
* `X.TDiv()` -- the same, done by `TDiv = toric_divisor_group`.
(I would be even happy with the short names only, but since `divisor_group` is already used in Sage in other classes, I think that we better have two sets here.)

Fulton uses `Div_T(X)` for T-Cartier divisors, but in Hartshorne `Div(X)` stands for Weil divisors. He has no notation for Cartier ones, as far as I can tell, but `CaCl(X)` stands for the class group of Cartier divisors. I like Hartshorne's naming scheme better - when I think about a "divisor", I think about a Weil divisor and they are definitely more natural and easy to handle objects in toric world. So I propose names as above with `CaDiv` and `TCaDiv` reserved for possible future methods (with appropriate long versions).

Let me know what you think!

1. OK, let's leave it as is as the simplest solution. I have already added an exception message complaining that the divisor is not QQ-Cartier if the function fails, but it still works peacefully for cones for which it is possible to find m.

2. I thought about using (...) or {...}, but that does not quite distinguish divisors from complicated polynomial expressions on the one hand and (x) will not be used in a traditional sense of a principal divisor when, say, only `x^3` defines a valid function. I'd say that the standard in toric geometry is to have different names for ray generators, variables, and divisors, but have the same index on the corresponding ones, like u_i, z_i, D_i.

So I am still thinking about something like:
   * users have no control over divisor names
   * if coordinate names are constructed in the standard manner with indices, corresponding divisors are called D0, D1, etc.
   * if coordinate names are given explicitly, divisors get `D` prefix for printing and `D_{...}` for latexing (I think it is possible to have them different)
   * we keep an internal polynomial ring (say, `_divisor_ring`) for these purposes, but don't expose it to the user
   * there is a command like `inject_divisors` that defines names corresponding to this divisors, but not as polynomials: D1 gets associated with `ToricDivisor(X, 1)` which is still a formal sum and users cannot do multiplication of such things etc.
   * alternatively, instead of messing with extra rings, we put the entire naming algorithm into `_repr_` and `_latex_` of toric divisors - these methods don't have to be fast/cached or anything, people are slower anyway ;-) I think I actually prefer this variant.
Note that you actually did use names like `Dx, Dy, ...` in the very first example of your toric divisors module. So these names are natural, and it is convenient to have them different from homogeneous coordinates because you are likely to use both in the same time. Yet another advantage of this form compared to some kind of decorators like ()/{} is that Dx is a valid name and so you can have the same notation in the code and in the output. I think that 

```
sage: x
x
sage: Dx
Dx
```
looks better than

```
sage: x
x
sage: Dx
(x)
sage: (x)
x
```

5. Touché! ;-)

About the divisor `_repr_()`: If you want prefixes then you'll have to live with `Dalpha`, but I think that is acceptable. I think it would be better if we could agree on a naming convention that works only with the homogeneous coordinate names, though. Different users will probably want different names `Dx`, `D1`, `H`, `E_i`, `O_x`, `f_x` ... depending on whether they think of it as a divisor, sheaf, or support function. There is no notation that'll make everyone happy, but if we could do `_repr_()` with just the homogeneous coordinates then the output will be at least uniform.

How about
* `O(x*z/y^2)`
* `The divisor {x=0}-2*{y=0}+{z=0}`
* Or just `{x=0}-2*{y=0}+{z=0}`

As for the implementation, I very much prefer stuffing everything into `_repr_`/`_latex_`.

Volker, I have done some more changes to the documentation of the module itself, `function_value`, and `m`, please check that they are OK. It seems to me that traditionally support functions are defined for Cartier divisors only. It is easy to extend the notion to QQ-Cartier divisors, but do they have any meaning for a general Weil divisor?

I have simplified examples for `is_Weil` etc. and moved your more complicated version to the module documentation, where it looks very good, I think, since it shows examples of all divisors which are "X but not Y".

I have defined `_repr_` and `_latex_` for generic divisors to wrap the defining part of each term in `V(...)`, which does not look that great on existing examples with ZZ, but I think that `4*V(5)` is still better than `4*5` and in those cases where something else is desired there should be a derived class with overridden `_repr_`, while in most case some kind of a "zero set notation" works great. It is a bit annoying how in LaTeX presentation negative coefficients are wrapped in parenthesis, but fixing it the right way requires deeper digging in sage.misc and I'd rather do it sometime later (or wait until someone else fixes it ;-)).

I have not yet tested this patch against the whole library (doing it now), if there are way too many doctests to fix, I'll move this functions to toric divisors only.

The next patch on the ticket does not apply cleanly anymore and needs to be rebased (after you agree with my patch), sorry!

1) You can remove the `ToricDivisor` from the global namespace as well if you update doctests accordingly. Historically, I only introduced the `X.divisor()` method later on...

2) Can you leave this one in? 

```
 # I think there are many rings that should not be used as coefficients 
 # but checking for such cases is impractical, so I'll comment this... 
 # if isinstance(R,CohomologyRing): 
 #    raise TypeError, 'Coefficient ring cannot be a cohomology ring.' 
```
The point of specifically excluding divisors over coordinate rings is that when you write `(divisor)*(cohomology class)` you want `divisor.cohomology_class() * (cohomology class)`, so we have to forbid the undesirable coercion to the divisor ring over the cohomology class.

3) Closing `>` in 

```
Construct a :class:`(toric Weil) divisor <ToricDivisor_generic` on the 
```

Rest looks good. I can rebase the next patches after you update the reviewer patch.

I couldn't believe my eyes for a long time while I was starring at the part of divisor classes patch related to `polyhedra.py` module, but once I opened the existing library version it made sense ;-)


Changes in the reviewer patch (which should be applied on top of all others):
* I renamed `test` to `region` as an option for `cone._contains`, `test` seems to me somewhat confusing, I would think that it is used as a boolean value, not a string. I also removed underscores from acceptable input since they are not used as Python identifiers and then I think it is better to make them more human.
* I renamed `divisor.P()` to `divisor.polytope()`, hope it is OK ;-)
* I renamed `gale_transform` to `Gale_transform` for fans in the spirit of all other names in our files. This breaks backward compatibility with the existing version of Sage, but I think that it is so new that it is OK, especially since it is kind of a bug ;-)
* I added `Mori_cone` method, `Mori_vectors` now returs its rays (do you think we still need it?). What exactly "Mori vectors" refer to? Generators of the cone, or any point inside this cone as well? What about non-simplicial cases, when generators are not unique? `Kaehler_cone.dual()` gives something pretty horrible, so it should not be used by end-users until we make it behave better, but it is useful to construct `Mori_cone`, including non-simplicial cases.
* Some functions now return tuples instead of lists. I think that for cached values it is important, while for others it is good for consistency (and in case we decide to make them cached as well).
* Some code optimization/bug fixing (Hal Schenck pointed at some of them while working on examples).
* Some documentation prettification, e.g. while it is not necessary to give keyword arguments, I like to write `Fan(cones=[...], rays=[...])` in doctests since it makes it more clear for the reader which list is what and where are their boundaries.


Food for thoughts:
1. Do you have any doubts about using the name `Kaehler_cone` for the closure of the actual Kaehler cone? (I am OK with it, just want to make sure that you have thought about it as well).
2. Is it really necessary to set `_fan` attribute of divisors? It seems to me that if you need it once in a function, it is not that much work to get to the fan though the scheme attribute, while when you need it often you can get it once and name just `fan` which is even more convenient.

5. How about changing "The toric QQ-divisor class group" to "The toric rational divisor class group" in `_repr_`? Since everything else is written out explicitly, it seems to me that it is better without "QQ" (but I am OK with the current version, if you prefer it).
6. I think we must have a space after comma in divisor classes representation, i.e. have in `_repr_` something like `return "Divisor class %s" % list(self)`.
7. I think that we should derive `ToricRationalDivisorClass` from vectors in the same way as it is done for toric lattice elements, because overriding `_new_c` eliminates the necessity to repeat every single arithmetic function, which involves multiple unnecessary conversions.
8. How about renaming `divisor_class_group` to just `class_group`? Or  better `rational_class_group` to emphasize tensoring with QQ and with a hope to implement eventually `class_group` with potential torsion.

I am happy to do any/all (except for (4)) of the changes above as a part of the reviewer patch, once we agree on them.

Some people use "Mori vector" for the rays of the Mori cone, but `Mori_cone` is probably better.

1. I'm fine with `Kahler_cone` actually returning the closure... right now we don't have a way of specifying open cones and I don't think that it is a priority. Plus there would be a lot of code complexity in intersecting open/closed cones, which I'd be happy to avoid for toric purposes.

2. Since all toric algorithms end up using the fan I found it useful to have a local reference. I'm fine with either way, though.

3. You are usually the one who advocates the longer names ;-) The toric Chow group prints itself like this:

```
sage: A = X.Chow_group() 
sage: A.degree() 
(Z, C7, Z^5 x C2 x C2, Z) 
```
    and it would be easy to lift the code from there. But in practice you'll just want the dimension (no torsion here). So I think that, while looking good, be actually in your way when working with it.

5. , 6. Fine with me!

{
    "body": "<div id=\"comment:43\" align=\"right\">comment:43</div>\n\nAwesome!!! I am pretty sure this will be the final patch, although it is not yet in its final shape ;-)\n\n1. Converting back and forth between `Polyhedron` and `LatticePolytope` is something we always had to have and it is a bit surprising that nobody has done it before. Constructing a containing lattice polytope is also quite useful, but can we change the behaviour a little bit? I propose the following:\n   * `is_lattice_polytope()` works exactly as now;\n   * `lattice_polytope()` raises a `ValueError` exception if the polyhedron is not compact OR has non-integral vertices (it is not `NotImplemented` because lattice polytopes must be compact and have only integral vertices by definition);\n   * `enveloping_lattice_polytope()` raises a `ValueError` if the polyhedron is not compact, but otherwise wraps vertices in integral boxes, as it is done now in `lattice_polytope`. Alternatively, `lattice_polytope` function may take some argument that will allow it to construct a polytope which is strictly bigger, e.g. `lattice_polytope(envelope=True)`.\n2. Can you please revert changes that this patch makes in `coefficient` and add the following to its doctest:\n\n ```\n sage: P2 = toric_varieties.P2()\n sage: P2.inject_variables()\n Defining x, y, z\n sage: D = P2.divisor([(1,x), (1,x)])\n sage: D\n V(x) + V(x)\n sage: D.coefficient(x)\n 1\n```\n Note that the output should be 2, not 1, and while nobody is likely to enter divisors in such a weird form, it is conceivable that some code will generate non-reduced divisors.\n1. The same issue makes your code in the new `is_integral` function behave inconsistently:\n\n ```\n sage: D = P2.divisor([(1/2,x), (1/2,x)])\n sage: D\n 1/2*V(x) + 1/2*V(x)\n sage: D.is_integral()\n False\n sage: D.reduce()\n sage: D.is_integral()\n True\n```\n I would suggest that this function should try to convert the divisor to a `ZZ`-vector to check if it is integral or not (calling `coefficient` for every variable will iterate over divisor again and again). Note that `_vector_` also does not work nicely: if you call `vector(ZZ, D)` before reducing, you will get an error. The solution is to first create just a list of zeroes in `_vector_`, accumulate coefficient values in one iteration through divisor, and then convert this list to a vector. It also seems to me that the best way to address non-reduced divisors in `coefficient` is to `return vector(self)[index]` to avoid code duplication.\n1. You should not have added `Group` on line 1024. If it is not clear in that sentence that this Python-class refers to the divisor-class (and not the group of these classes), the sentence has to be restructured. Thanks for catching \"::\"!\n2. Should we maybe make `_sheaf_cohomology_support` a public method? It seems to me that it is something end-users may care about, at least for educational purposes.",

Awesome!!! I am pretty sure this will be the final patch, although it is not yet in its final shape ;-)

1. Converting back and forth between `Polyhedron` and `LatticePolytope` is something we always had to have and it is a bit surprising that nobody has done it before. Constructing a containing lattice polytope is also quite useful, but can we change the behaviour a little bit? I propose the following:
   * `is_lattice_polytope()` works exactly as now;
   * `lattice_polytope()` raises a `ValueError` exception if the polyhedron is not compact OR has non-integral vertices (it is not `NotImplemented` because lattice polytopes must be compact and have only integral vertices by definition);
   * `enveloping_lattice_polytope()` raises a `ValueError` if the polyhedron is not compact, but otherwise wraps vertices in integral boxes, as it is done now in `lattice_polytope`. Alternatively, `lattice_polytope` function may take some argument that will allow it to construct a polytope which is strictly bigger, e.g. `lattice_polytope(envelope=True)`.
2. Can you please revert changes that this patch makes in `coefficient` and add the following to its doctest:

 ```
 sage: P2 = toric_varieties.P2()
 sage: P2.inject_variables()
 Defining x, y, z
 sage: D = P2.divisor([(1,x), (1,x)])
 sage: D
 V(x) + V(x)
 sage: D.coefficient(x)
 1
```
 Note that the output should be 2, not 1, and while nobody is likely to enter divisors in such a weird form, it is conceivable that some code will generate non-reduced divisors.
1. The same issue makes your code in the new `is_integral` function behave inconsistently:

 ```
 sage: D = P2.divisor([(1/2,x), (1/2,x)])
 sage: D
 1/2*V(x) + 1/2*V(x)
 sage: D.is_integral()
 False
 sage: D.reduce()
 sage: D.is_integral()
 True
```
 I would suggest that this function should try to convert the divisor to a `ZZ`-vector to check if it is integral or not (calling `coefficient` for every variable will iterate over divisor again and again). Note that `_vector_` also does not work nicely: if you call `vector(ZZ, D)` before reducing, you will get an error. The solution is to first create just a list of zeroes in `_vector_`, accumulate coefficient values in one iteration through divisor, and then convert this list to a vector. It also seems to me that the best way to address non-reduced divisors in `coefficient` is to `return vector(self)[index]` to avoid code duplication.
1. You should not have added `Group` on line 1024. If it is not clear in that sentence that this Python-class refers to the divisor-class (and not the group of these classes), the sentence has to be restructured. Thanks for catching "::"!
2. Should we maybe make `_sheaf_cohomology_support` a public method? It seems to me that it is something end-users may care about, at least for educational purposes.

The `reduce()` method is inherited from `FormalSum`, there is nothing more to it. We could add a base class `ReducedFormalSum` without this method if it bugs you, but I think thats not worth the effort.
