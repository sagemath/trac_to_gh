<a id='comment:4'></a>Divisor-related files in schemes/generic were the ones that I didn't look at before, but they turn out to be quite short and simple, especially in the relevant "truly generic" part. I think we should try to use them (preferably without putting toric code into those files, I found it rather inconvenient how service-classes of different schemes and spaces are mixed in old files).

The general framework uses formal sums for the divisor group. Your patch is likely to be more efficient, since it works with a finite rank subgroup of the divisor group, but it does not support divisors on toric varieties that are not toric. Would it be possible to implement instead primitive toric divisors (i.e. those given by "z_i=0") and work with their formal sums as elements of the total divisor group?

If that would be too inconvenient, it would be nice at least to have some class representing the group of torus-invariant divisors with the coercion into the general divisor group.

One thing I have noticed so far that doctests in `schemes/plane_curves/projective_curve` fail because of renaming `coef` to `coefficient`. Why did you change the name? I.e. is it just your personal preference or it is more consistent with other things?

We also should straighten out our patch queue and ticket dependencies, now that a big chunk of it is gone. How about the following one?
* #9470
* #9326
* #9502
* #9504
* #9296

Doctesting the patch on this ticket, it seems that it uses code from #9380, and that ticket definitely should not go before this one. However, I don't mind if you completely or partially flatten it into this one (almost all code there is yours anyway).

<a id='comment:9'></a>I went over the first patch and it looks great except for the following minor points:

* The name of the argument in this function is confusing. Since such functions take anything as input, I vote for something neutral like `x`:
 {{{
def is_DivisorGroup(divisor):
    ...
}}}

* In `_element_constructor_(self, x, check=True, reduce=True)` the last line is
 {{{
return Divisor_generic([(self.base_ring()(1), x)], check=False, reduce=False, parent=self)
}}}
 Why in this case `check` and `reduce` are set to `False` instead of using the passed values?

* As I understood the documentation of `UniqueRepresentation`, derived classes should not have default values in `__init__`, because it leads to this:
 {{{
sage: from sage.structure.formal_sum import FormalSums_generic
sage: FormalSums_generic(ZZ) is FormalSums_generic()
False
}}}
 Note, however,
 {{{
sage: FormalSums(ZZ) is FormalSums()
True
}}}
 since each layer repeats default values and the default in the actual class is never used (unless you do it directly as I have done it above). This brings me to the last comment:

* Is there any need in factory functions now that they just call the class? Before they were necessary since they were providing caching/uniqueness, but your new approach is cleaner and more unified (leading to "unique unique representation" ;-)).

<a id='comment:11'></a>I am fine with the optimization, I just didn't quite get it before.

Default arguments can work with `UniqueRepresentation`, they just require more work. http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/sage/structure/unique_representation.html, section "Argument preprocessing." It was quite interesting to read it, I didn't know about this class before I saw it in your patch.

My question is not about necessity of `UniqueFactory`, but about necessity of both `FormalSums` and `FormalSums_generic`. It think that after your refactoring the answer is no.

I don't quite understand if `ToricDivisorGroup` is supposed to be a group of T-Weil divisors only (as its documentation states) or of all (Weil) divisors as it prints and somewhat works:\n {{{\nsage: P2 = toric_varieties.P2()\nsage: P2.coordinate_ring().inject_variables()\nDefining x, y, z\nsage: G = P2.divisor_group()\nsage: G\nGroup of ZZ-Divisors on 2-d CPR-Fano toric variety covered by 3 affine patches\nsage: print G(x)\nThe divisor x\nsage: print G(x+y)\nNone\n}}}\n Is the last line supposed to raise an error (since `x+y` does not define a T-divisor), or return some other divisor object of a different class than `x`? The current behaviour certainly seems to be a bug to me.\n\nI think that ideally there should be a separate group of T-Weil divisors with divisor classes having lifts to this group. This group probably should not derive from `DivisorGroup_generic`, but rather should have a coercion map to it and both T-Weil and Weil groups should be accessible from toric varieties. This way the divisor associated to \"x\" will have two representation (one is likely to be more efficient and relevant for computations) while \"x+y\" will have only a generic one. What do you think?",

1. I don't quite understand if `ToricDivisorGroup` is supposed to be a group of T-Weil divisors only (as its documentation states) or of all (Weil) divisors as it prints and somewhat works:
 {{{
sage: P2 = toric_varieties.P2()
sage: P2.coordinate_ring().inject_variables()
Defining x, y, z
sage: G = P2.divisor_group()
sage: G
Group of ZZ-Divisors on 2-d CPR-Fano toric variety covered by 3 affine patches
sage: print G(x)
The divisor x
sage: print G(x+y)
None
}}}
 Is the last line supposed to raise an error (since `x+y` does not define a T-divisor), or return some other divisor object of a different class than `x`? The current behaviour certainly seems to be a bug to me.

I think that ideally there should be a separate group of T-Weil divisors with divisor classes having lifts to this group. This group probably should not derive from `DivisorGroup_generic`, but rather should have a coercion map to it and both T-Weil and Weil groups should be accessible from toric varieties. This way the divisor associated to "x" will have two representation (one is likely to be more efficient and relevant for computations) while "x+y" will have only a generic one. What do you think?

Agreed, I think that parents should be more or less descriptive in their `_repr_`, since usually they are looked at by themselves, but elements should try to be compact since they are likely to be used in groups.

I think that for most people who know what a divisor is it would be strange that `divisor_group` does not allow working with general divisors.

Bottom line: I am against calling the group of T-divisors just `divisor_group` and I think that access to all divisor groups should be uniform (e.g. without explicit calls to `DivisorGroup` as in your example above) and they should always be more special than generic (e.g. there is already a way to check homogeneity of polynomials  in homogeneous coordinates, but as you have demonstrated, a generic divisor group was not able to use this functionality).

<a id='comment:24'></a>I have started a little reviewer patch fixing some issues and prettifying documentation, but it grew up ;-)  The patch should go after `trac_9337_toric_divisors.patch`, I didn't work yet with other files. Changes:

1. `ToricDivisorGroup` is removed from the global name space. It probably should not be there, since it is not for other schemes and usually such things are returned by variety methods. The same argument applies to `ToricDivisor`, but it seems from your doctests that you did intend to use it directly. Is it indeed the case? I would prefer to use the form `X.divisor(...)` which is already there.
2. Only necessary imports are left in the beginning of the file. While it is a little bit annoying to add more imports when you extend functionality, I think that keeping imports to minimal helps with speed, circular references, and clarity.
3. Simplified `_element_constructor_` in toric divisor group, dealing only with the case when nothing has to be done. There should be no need to check if two divisor groups are equal - if they are equal, they are (at least must be) the same object. More sophisticated cases are left to `ToricDivisor` function to ensure that they always behave in the same way. I worked on this function as well, hopefully for the good ;-) The original version has some bugs, e.g.
 {{{
sage: P2 = toric_varieties.P2()
sage: ToricDivisor(P2, [(1/2, P2.gen(0), "Extra stuff")])
Divisor 1/2*x
sage: ToricDivisor(P2, [(1/2, P2.gen(0), "Extra stuff")]).parent()
Group of toric ZZ-Weil divisors on 2-d CPR-Fano toric variety covered by 3 affine patches
}}}
 (note `ZZ` on the last line). The new one on this example gives
 {{{
sage: P2 = toric_varieties.P2()
sage: ToricDivisor(P2, [(1/2, P2.gen(0), "Extra stuff")]).parent()
TypeError: cannot deduce coefficient ring for [(1/2, x, 'Extra stuff')]!
sage: ToricDivisor(P2, [(1/2, P2.gen(0))]).parent()
Group of toric QQ-Weil divisors on 2-d CPR-Fano toric variety covered by 3 affine patches
}}}
1. Some bugs for non-reduced divisors are fixed, e.g.
 {{{
sage: P2.divisor([(1,x), (1,x)]).coefficient(x)
1
}}}
 while it should be 2.
1. `cl` is changed to `cohomology_class` as for cones, `ch` is now a synonym for `Chern_caracter` as for toric varieties.
2. Some simplifications to `is_(QQ)_Cartier` code, using the fact that it is very fast to check Cartier after QQ-Cartier due to your caching of m-vectors.
3. Some prettifications/clarifications in the documentation, some of them are due to warnings from Florent's patches at #9128. Note also that you should not put class documentation into `__init__` docstring, since it will not show up anywhere.

Remaining questions/issues:
1. Is there really any use for `divisor.m(cone)` for non-QQ-Cartier divisors? I have a strong desire to check in the beginning of that function if we are in this situation and if not - raise `ValueError`. But I may be wrong. And I see that the check involves computing all these m's. I am also not completely happy about the name `m` which is not very descriptive, but I don't really have an alternative this time (`dual_vector` is not a good choice, in my opinion), so let it be for now.
2. I decided once again that I don't like `_repr_` of divisors: `Divisor x + y` can be interpreted quite naturally as the zero set of `x+y=0`, while here it means the union of `x=0` and `y=0` (not to mention that in each case the polynomial may not be well-defined). I guess it stems from the general divisor behaviour and one should think what to do with it, but in our case when each "basic" divisor is given by a variable I think we should change it to `Divisor D_x + D_y`, maybe even dropping `Divisor ` in front. For general divisors there probably should be something like `V(...)` around each separate equation, but we don't have to worry about this now.

4. How about making `K` return a canonical cohomology class instead of an actual divisor?
5. I kind of don't like the idea of complete identification of divisors/support functions/sheaves... I would rather have methods `divisor.support_function()` and `divisor.sheaf()`, but of course that requires creating new classes for these objects, i.e. time...

Once we decide what to do with the above, I can do the changes and incorporate them into my patch.

<a id='comment:29'></a>Volker, I have done some more changes to the documentation of the module itself, `function_value`, and `m`, please check that they are OK. It seems to me that traditionally support functions are defined for Cartier divisors only. It is easy to extend the notion to QQ-Cartier divisors, but do they have any meaning for a general Weil divisor?

I have simplified examples for `is_Weil` etc. and moved your more complicated version to the module documentation, where it looks very good, I think, since it shows examples of all divisors which are "X but not Y".

I have defined `_repr_` and `_latex_` for generic divisors to wrap the defining part of each term in `V(...)`, which does not look that great on existing examples with ZZ, but I think that `4*V(5)` is still better than `4*5` and in those cases where something else is desired there should be a derived class with overridden `_repr_`, while in most case some kind of a "zero set notation" works great. It is a bit annoying how in LaTeX presentation negative coefficients are wrapped in parenthesis, but fixing it the right way requires deeper digging in sage.misc and I'd rather do it sometime later (or wait until someone else fixes it ;-)).

I have not yet tested this patch against the whole library (doing it now), if there are way too many doctests to fix, I'll move this functions to toric divisors only.

The next patch on the ticket does not apply cleanly anymore and needs to be rebased (after you agree with my patch), sorry!

The point of specifically excluding divisors over coordinate rings is that when you write `(divisor)*(cohomology class)` you want `divisor.cohomology_class() * (cohomology class)`, so we have to forbid the undesirable coercion to the divisor ring over the cohomology class.

3) Closing `>` in

Rest looks good. I can rebase the next patches after you update the reviewer patch.

I haven't used the dual cone for the `Mori_vectors` since that is more about GLSM notation. Since the Kahler cone can now just be `dual()`ized, we probably don't need a special `Mori_cone` method.

<a id='comment:34'></a>I couldn't believe my eyes for a long time while I was starring at the part of divisor classes patch related to `polyhedra.py` module, but once I opened the existing library version it made sense ;-)


Changes in the reviewer patch (which should be applied on top of all others):
* I renamed `test` to `region` as an option for `cone._contains`, `test` seems to me somewhat confusing, I would think that it is used as a boolean value, not a string. I also removed underscores from acceptable input since they are not used as Python identifiers and then I think it is better to make them more human.
* I renamed `divisor.P()` to `divisor.polytope()`, hope it is OK ;-)
* I renamed `gale_transform` to `Gale_transform` for fans in the spirit of all other names in our files. This breaks backward compatibility with the existing version of Sage, but I think that it is so new that it is OK, especially since it is kind of a bug ;-)
* I added `Mori_cone` method, `Mori_vectors` now returs its rays (do you think we still need it?). What exactly "Mori vectors" refer to? Generators of the cone, or any point inside this cone as well? What about non-simplicial cases, when generators are not unique? `Kaehler_cone.dual()` gives something pretty horrible, so it should not be used by end-users until we make it behave better, but it is useful to construct `Mori_cone`, including non-simplicial cases.
* Some functions now return tuples instead of lists. I think that for cached values it is important, while for others it is good for consistency (and in case we decide to make them cached as well).
* Some code optimization/bug fixing (Hal Schenck pointed at some of them while working on examples).
* Some documentation prettification, e.g. while it is not necessary to give keyword arguments, I like to write `Fan(cones=[...], rays=[...])` in doctests since it makes it more clear for the reader which list is what and where are their boundaries.


Food for thoughts:
1. Do you have any doubts about using the name `Kaehler_cone` for the closure of the actual Kaehler cone? (I am OK with it, just want to make sure that you have thought about it as well).
2. Is it really necessary to set `_fan` attribute of divisors? It seems to me that if you need it once in a function, it is not that much work to get to the fan though the scheme attribute, while when you need it often you can get it once and name just `fan` which is even more convenient.
3. I really don't like that "cohomology" is used to refer to a vector of integers. I would expect it to return actual cohomology groups (like homology method of simplicial complexes does). How about renaming all relevant method and their documentation and call it something else? "D.h_vector()" comes to mind, or maybe even "D.h()" to get a vector and "D.h(2)" to get the dimension of the given degree only.
4. I think all cohomology-related functions (including helpers) should have explanations of / references to used algorithms, either in the documentation, or in the form of comments. The second variant may be even more appropriate.
5. How about changing "The toric QQ-divisor class group" to "The toric rational divisor class group" in `_repr_`? Since everything else is written out explicitly, it seems to me that it is better without "QQ" (but I am OK with the current version, if you prefer it).
6. I think we must have a space after comma in divisor classes representation, i.e. have in `_repr_` something like `return "Divisor class %s" % list(self)`.
7. I think that we should derive `ToricRationalDivisorClass` from vectors in the same way as it is done for toric lattice elements, because overriding `_new_c` eliminates the necessity to repeat every single arithmetic function, which involves multiple unnecessary conversions.
8. How about renaming `divisor_class_group` to just `class_group`? Or  better `rational_class_group` to emphasize tensoring with QQ and with a hope to implement eventually `class_group` with potential torsion.

I am happy to do any/all (except for (4)) of the changes above as a part of the reviewer patch, once we agree on them.

<a id='comment:41'></a>3. When there is a cohomology method that returns groups, it will be too late to rename the current version, since it will break backward compatibility ;-)

   8. Then I definitely think that we should have a method `class_group()` returning the honest class group, while the rational one should be obtained either as `rational_class_group()` or `class_group(QQ)`...

Anyway, the updated patch deals with everything discussed above except for 4 (which I would like you to do on top) and these two issues, which you can change or leave as is, if I still have not convinced you.

From the technical point of view it seems that everything is working fine with my new patch. I will run tests of the whole library, build pdf documentation and report if there are any issues.

* Polyhedron can now determine integral points in not necessarily integral polytopes.
* Used this to extend cohomology computation to reflexive sheaves.
* Renamed `ToricDivisor.polytope()` to `polyhedron()` since its not a lattice polytope in general.
* Documentation added to cohomology algorithm.
* Output of `ToricDivisor.cohomology()` is now analogous to the output of `SimplicialComplex.homology()`
* renamed `ToricVariety.divisor_class_group()` to `rational_class_group()`

<a id='comment:43'></a>Awesome!!! I am pretty sure this will be the final patch, although it is not yet in its final shape ;-)

1. Converting back and forth between `Polyhedron` and `LatticePolytope` is something we always had to have and it is a bit surprising that nobody has done it before. Constructing a containing lattice polytope is also quite useful, but can we change the behaviour a little bit? I propose the following:

   * `lattice_polytope()` raises a `ValueError` exception if the polyhedron is not compact OR has non-integral vertices (it is not `NotImplemented` because lattice polytopes must be compact and have only integral vertices by definition);
   * `enveloping_lattice_polytope()` raises a `ValueError` if the polyhedron is not compact, but otherwise wraps vertices in integral boxes, as it is done now in `lattice_polytope`. Alternatively, `lattice_polytope` function may take some argument that will allow it to construct a polytope which is strictly bigger, e.g. `lattice_polytope(envelope=True)`.
2. Can you please revert changes that this patch makes in `coefficient` and add the following to its doctest:
 {{{
sage: P2 = toric_varieties.P2()
sage: P2.inject_variables()
Defining x, y, z
sage: D = P2.divisor([(1,x), (1,x)])
sage: D
V(x) + V(x)
sage: D.coefficient(x)
1
}}}
 Note that the output should be 2, not 1, and while nobody is likely to enter divisors in such a weird form, it is conceivable that some code will generate non-reduced divisors.
1. The same issue makes your code in the new `is_integral` function behave inconsistently:
 {{{
sage: D = P2.divisor([(1/2,x), (1/2,x)])
sage: D
1/2*V(x) + 1/2*V(x)
sage: D.is_integral()
False
sage: D.reduce()
sage: D.is_integral()
True
}}}
 I would suggest that this function should try to convert the divisor to a `ZZ`-vector to check if it is integral or not (calling `coefficient` for every variable will iterate over divisor again and again). Note that `_vector_` also does not work nicely: if you call `vector(ZZ, D)` before reducing, you will get an error. The solution is to first create just a list of zeroes in `_vector_`, accumulate coefficient values in one iteration through divisor, and then convert this list to a vector. It also seems to me that the best way to address non-reduced divisors in `coefficient` is to `return vector(self)[index]` to avoid code duplication.
1. You should not have added `Group` on line 1024. If it is not clear in that sentence that this Python-class refers to the divisor-class (and not the group of these classes), the sentence has to be restructured. Thanks for catching "::"!
2. Should we maybe make `_sheaf_cohomology_support` a public method? It seems to me that it is something end-users may care about, at least for educational purposes.

In general I think allowing unreduced divisors is going to be a huge pitfall for future contributors as well as a performance impediment. If one really wanted non-reduced divisors then one needs a flag to remember whether one already did the reduction to avoid doing it over and over.

<a id='comment:50'></a>I fixed the doctests, that was just a minor issue. Thanks for catching it!

The divisor code already assumes at places that the divisor is reduced (we should probably call this "collected", but I'll stick with it for now), for example in the original code to extract the coefficient. In general I think allowing unreduced divisors is going to be a huge pitfall for future contributors as well as a performance impediment. If one really wanted non-reduced divisors then one needs a flag to remember whether one already did the reduction to avoid doing it over and over. On a final word of warning:

```
sage: FormalSum([[1,2],[1,2]],reduce=False) == FormalSum([[2,2]])
False
```

The `reduce()` method is inherited from `FormalSum`, there is nothing more to it. We could add a base class `ReducedFormalSum` without this method if it bugs you, but I think thats not worth the effort.
