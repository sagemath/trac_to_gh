I have made several enhancements to eclib:

1. Support for minus space modular symbols
2. Some sparse linear algebra improvements

The new version is called eclib-20100711 since it is more than just a patch-level change.  See below for a link to the spkg.

The interface in sage/libs/cremona has been updated accordingly in the patch;  this depends on #9441

I have added Chris W to the CC list since we'll need his input, as he wrote ell_modular_symbols.

I agree that that file needs updating as a consequence of my upgrade;  but that can be done on a separate ticket?

John,

I thought that eclib was propagating that warning, but clearly it's coming from ell_modular_symbols.py. Have a look at the new ref patch, and let me know what you think.

I'm having difficulty getting the new package:

```
$ wget http://www.warwick.ac.uk/staff/J.E.Cremona/eclib-20100711.spkg
--19:50:47--  http://www.warwick.ac.uk/staff/J.E.Cremona/eclib-20100711.spkg

Resolving www.warwick.ac.uk... 137.205.243.107
Connecting to www.warwick.ac.uk|137.205.243.107|:80... connected.
HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 
```

Can someone check its availability and perhaps put a copy on the Sage cluster?

Also, should I apply both patches, too?
