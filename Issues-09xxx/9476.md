I have made several enhancements to eclib:

1. Support for minus space modular symbols
2. Some sparse linear algebra improvements

The new version is called eclib-20100711 since it is more than just a patch-level change.  See below for a link to the spkg.

The interface in sage/libs/cremona has been updated accordingly in the patch;  this depends on #9441

Hmm. I think this might have something to do with one of the things I saw on #9247.

I have added Chris W to the CC list since we'll need his input, as he wrote ell_modular_symbols.

I agree that that file needs updating as a consequence of my upgrade;  but that can be done on a separate ticket?

Can someone check its availability and perhaps put a copy on the Sage cluster?

Also, should I apply both patches, too?
