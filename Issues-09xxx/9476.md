I have made several enhancements to eclib:

1. Support for minus space modular symbols
2. Some sparse linear algebra improvements

The new version is called eclib-20100711 since it is more than just a patch-level change.  See below for a link to the spkg.

The interface in sage/libs/cremona has been updated accordingly in the patch;  this depends on #9441

Hmm. I think this might have something to do with one of the things I saw on #9247.

I'm attaching the reviewer patch, which causes the following:

I thought that eclib was propagating that warning, but clearly it's coming from ell_modular_symbols.py. Have a look at the new ref patch, and let me know what you think.
