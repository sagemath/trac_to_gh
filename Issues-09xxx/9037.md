```
The spkg-install of 'pynac' has:

```
if [ `uname` = "Darwin" -a "$SAGE64" = "yes" ]; then
    echo "64 bit MacIntel"
    CXXFLAGS="-m64 -O2 -g"; export CXXFLAGS
    LDFLAGS="-m64"; export LDFLAGS
fi
```

so obviously does not attempt to build 64-bit when SAGE64="yes", unless the operating systems is OS X. 

The build actually fails on a 64-bit OpenSolaris system, as pynac tries to link to 64-bit objects, which obviously fails. 

```
sage: An error occurred while installing pynac-0.1.12

#8903 does **not** fix the issue, as it still has:

```
if [ `uname` = "Darwin" -a "$SAGE64" = "yes" ]; then
    echo "64 bit MacIntel"
    CXXFLAGS="-m64 -O2 -g"; export CXXFLAGS
    LDFLAGS="-m64"; export LDFLAGS
fi
```

I'll have to create a new package based on that at #8031.
