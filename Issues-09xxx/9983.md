EOL for AIX 5.3 was four years ago, and nobody seems to care about this ticket. So I suggest we close this as wontfix.

Replying to [@jdemeyer](#comment%3A3):
> Should we mass-close all tickets about AIX?

Is anyone using [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath) on AIX?

At least #9993 ("Singular fails to build on AIX 5.3") has no value, as it just tells an error. But  #9990 ("Pari fails to build on AIX") contains some discussion. But OTOH also closed tickets can be searched.
