It's trivial to change *the message* on non-zero return values, but I think errors should somehow be propagated, s.t. doc build errors aren't drowned in the flood of other messages.

I would have implemented that if I felt it was appropriate. ;-)

An error in a single document should IMHO not stop / break the whole build, but should be propagated and reported (also) at the end, in a summary. Same for warnings, but even harder to implement. (See also #10200.)

I actually do not understand why we do an equivalent of `os.system("sphinx ...")`; as far as I know, Sphinx is itself written in Python and its functionality should therefore be directly accessible to us from the `builder.py` script. This way we would easily get the warnings as well.

Looks as if #10191 does exactly that, but only in one of the two cases.

This is actually implemented now in #10200 (needs_review).

I propose to close this ticket as duplicate (given #10200).
