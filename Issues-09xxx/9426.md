Should a docbuild error just cause an exception to be raised, thus ending the build?  That wouldn't be hard to implement, I think.

I would have implemented that if I felt it was appropriate. ;-)

An error in a single document should IMHO not stop / break the whole build, but should be propagated and reported (also) at the end, in a summary. Same for warnings, but even harder to implement. (See also #10200.)

I actually do not understand why we do an equivalent of `os.system("sphinx ...")`; as far as I know, Sphinx is itself written in Python and its functionality should therefore be directly accessible to us from the `builder.py` script. This way we would easily get the warnings as well.
