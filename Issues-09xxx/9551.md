As reported here:

http://groups.google.co.uk/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/60d384d785d9f034/9cdf5d6fbecf23d0?lnk=gst&q=write+kirkby#9cdf5d6fbecf23d0

Sage tried to write `/usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/` on *t2.math.washington.edu*. A larger section of the error is shown further down the ticket, but the most critical line is:

```
error: could not create '/usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/rpy2': Permission denied
```

Recent(ish) version of Solaris 10 include Python 2.4.4 in `/usr/bin`, with libraries in `/lib/python2.4/`, which is where the Sage build tried to write. 

This was on the 4.5.alpha0 build, though I'm not aware of any one else raising this issue, so it's quite possible nothing has been done to fix the bug in the latest build (4.5 as I write). 

Since I'm not stupid enough to build Sage as root, this was not a problem, and just resulted in a failed build. But I'm well aware many people do build Sage as root, in which case this could be very serious. (I guess one could argue they got what they deserved). 

Another ticket I created (#9209) shows that Sage can fail to build if a user has a local installation of python, but if one makes that installation unreadable, so Sage will build. 

Another, possibly relevant ticket is #9536

I personally do not have the python skills to sort this out, but I do believe it is potentially a serious problem, as a user can mess up their system by writing to system directories.
