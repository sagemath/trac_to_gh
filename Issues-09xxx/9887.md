Sage 4.5.3, 2.6GHz Opteron, Linux

```
sage: R = Integers(3^20)
sage: u = Integer(2)
sage: timeit("z = R(u)")
625 loops, best of 3: 6.84 µs per loop
```

Why does it take 18000 cycles to convert a tiny integer to an element of R?

-------------------------------------
#9882 | 19.8 µs | 15.9 µs | 3.87 µs |

So it looks like David's other finite rings patches have already made a dramatic speed improvement to several of these, and the patch on this ticket further improves some of them. The fact that #9885 actually slowed down marginally as a result of the patch is slightly worrying; it might just be random noise, but I did several more runs and the slight slowdowns in #9885 and (to a lesser extent) #9887 seemed quite consistent. It might be a price worth paying for the dramatic speedups elsewhere, but it would be nice if we could avoid it.

I'd be interested to see corresponding timings on other systems.

<a id='comment:4'></a>I'm not sure why there are slight slowdowns for #9885 and #9887.  But I did figure out why #9886 was unexpectedly slow: see #10130.

Here are timings on my Macbook Pro (+ patch includes the patch at #10130):

```
      -------------------------------
      | 4.3.rc0 |  4.6.a2 | + patch |
-------------------------------------
#9882 | 19.9 µs |   15 µs | 3.71 µs |
#9883 | 4.34 ms |  117 µs | 20.2 µs |
#9884 | 3.79 ms |  314 µs | 30.7 µs |
#9885 | 1.22 µs |  850 ns |  938 ns |
#9886 | 9.99 µs | 33.4 µs |  264 ns |
#9887 |    ? µs |  787 ns |  814 ns |
-------------------------------------
```
I got a range of values for #9885 in the middle column, from 835ns to 1.07µs.

I wanted to check 9.99µs in the first column in a different branch, so rebuilt only to discover that that copy of sage was built when I had an earlier version of OS X and was thus running 32 bit...

<a id='comment:12'></a>There is at least some partial work on this done in `5.7.beta3`:

```
sage: R = Integers(3^20)
sage: u = Integer(2)
sage: %timeit z = R(u)
100000 loops, best of 3: 1.48 us per loop
sage: %timeit z = R(u)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.74 us per loop
```

So should we close this ticket?

Edit - I'm running this test on my Ubuntu VM while video chatting on Skype in my Host OS.

<a id='comment:13'></a>I second the request to close the ticket.  On sage-5.10:

```
sage: R = Integers(3^20)
sage: u = Integer(2)
sage: %timeit("z = R(u)")
10000000 loops, best of 3: 24.6 ns per loop
sage: %timeit("z = ZZ(u)")
10000000 loops, best of 3: 24.5 ns per loop
```

In other words, putting u into R takes the same time as putting u into ZZ (where it is already).  It shouldn't be possible to do any better.

I'll tag this as "positive review" to bring it to the release manager's attention.
