Sage 4.5.3, 2.6GHz Opteron, Linux

```
sage: R = Integers(3^20)
sage: u = Integer(2)
sage: timeit("z = R(u)")
625 loops, best of 3: 6.84 µs per loop
```

Why does it take 18000 cycles to convert a tiny integer to an element of R?

This depends on #7883, #8333, #8334 and #9814.  In particular, you first need to apply

```
333_finite_fields_to_new_coercion.patch
7883_ideals.patch
7883_fixes.patch
7585_9_1_frac_and_coerce_updates.patch
8334_residue_fields-rebased_for_8446.patch
7585_12_1_fixes.patch
9814-2.patch
```
from those tickets.

On the other hand, it also addresses the speed issues in #9885, #9884, #9883 and #9882.  It should also fix #9886: the timings indicate that `ZZ.convert_map_from(R)` is getting called each time, rather than the morphism being found in the `convert_from_hash,` and I don't know why this would be the case.

I tried the test cases from tickets #9882-#9887 under 4.5.3, under 4.6.alpha2 without this patch, and with this patch. Apologies for the crappy ASCII-art table.

```
      -------------------------------
      |   4.5.3 |  4.6.a2 | + patch |
-------------------------------------
#9882 | 19.8 µs | 15.9 µs | 3.87 µs |
#9883 | 4.25 ms |  133 µs | 21.5 µs |
#9884 | 1.04 ms |  385 µs |   18 µs |
#9885 | 1.23 µs | 1.24 µs | 1.34 µs |
#9886 | 33.7 µs | 32.5 µs | 32.9 µs |
#9887 | 6.54 µs |  966 ns |  992 ns |
-------------------------------------
```

So it looks like David's other finite rings patches have already made a dramatic speed improvement to several of these, and the patch on this ticket further improves some of them. The fact that #9885 actually slowed down marginally as a result of the patch is slightly worrying; it might just be random noise, but I did several more runs and the slight slowdowns in #9885 and (to a lesser extent) #9887 seemed quite consistent. It might be a price worth paying for the dramatic speedups elsewhere, but it would be nice if we could avoid it.

I'd be interested to see corresponding timings on other systems.

I'm not sure why there are slight slowdowns for #9885 and #9887.  But I did figure out why #9886 was unexpectedly slow: see #10130.

Here are timings on my Macbook Pro (+ patch includes the patch at #10130):

```
      -------------------------------
      | 4.3.rc0 |  4.6.a2 | + patch |
-------------------------------------
#9882 | 19.9 µs |   15 µs | 3.71 µs |
#9883 | 4.34 ms |  117 µs | 20.2 µs |
#9884 | 3.79 ms |  314 µs | 30.7 µs |
#9885 | 1.22 µs |  850 ns |  938 ns |
#9886 | 9.99 µs | 33.4 µs |  264 ns |
#9887 |    ? µs |  787 ns |  814 ns |
-------------------------------------
```
I got a range of values for #9885 in the middle column, from 835ns to 1.07µs.

I wanted to check 9.99µs in the first column in a different branch, so rebuilt only to discover that that copy of sage was built when I had an earlier version of OS X and was thus running 32 bit...

There is at least some partial work on this done in `5.7.beta3`:

```
sage: R = Integers(3^20)
sage: u = Integer(2)
sage: %timeit z = R(u)
100000 loops, best of 3: 1.48 us per loop
sage: %timeit z = R(u)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.74 us per loop
```

So should we close this ticket?

Edit - I'm running this test on my Ubuntu VM while video chatting on Skype in my Host OS.

I second the request to close the ticket.  On sage-5.10:

```
sage: R = Integers(3^20)
sage: u = Integer(2)
sage: %timeit("z = R(u)")
10000000 loops, best of 3: 24.6 ns per loop
sage: %timeit("z = ZZ(u)")
10000000 loops, best of 3: 24.5 ns per loop
```

In other words, putting u into R takes the same time as putting u into ZZ (where it is already).  It shouldn't be possible to do any better.

I'll tag this as "positive review" to bring it to the release manager's attention.
