Using the Simple Server API I tried the following (after logging in of course):

At first I sent the code "`sleep(10);5`" to the server using the following URL:
`http://localhost:port/simple/compute?session=theID&code=sleep(10)%3B5`

Then, immediatly afterwards (this means command one was still computing) I sent the code "`4+5`" to the server using the URL
`http://localhost:port/simple/compute?session=theID&code=4%2B5`

Then, after 10 seconds, I looked at the results of both commands using
`http://localhost:port/simple/status?session=theID&cell=2`
and
`http://localhost:port/simple/status?session=theID&cell=3`

Both cells had `5` as result, which should be only the result of the first
cell.

Sadly, the simple server does not work with the current notebook, and the [Sage cell server](https://github.com/sagemath/sagecell) has more or less superseded it.
