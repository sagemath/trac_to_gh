I wanted just to post that ^^

The thing with the 


```
"""

code="""
```

is correct since it belongs to the support_code

I add a new patch with that thing corrected + a new updated link.
I added some blank lines into the 3rd code snippet for a little optical clan up.


At least all examples should work now.
