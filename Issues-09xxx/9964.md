Many Sage objects have `_pari_` and/or `_pari_init_` member functions. However, it is not at all documented how these are supposed to work. Reading the source code gives some hints, but leaves some things unexplained, for example:
* what exactly is the interaction between `_pari_` and `_pari_init_`. Which of these two functions (or both) should be implemented?
* Why is `_pari_init_` also used for the GP interpreter `Gp`?
* Why must `_pari_init_` return a string? Is it only because it is also used for the GP interpreter or is there a deeper reason?

Note also that the patch at #9400 contains important changes to a `_pari_init_` function which are completely not understood by the author.

I'll add my post from sage-devel here.

```

Here's what is going on.  We have the pexpect interface to GP (which
we will refer to as gp) as well as C interface to PARI (which we will
refer to as pari).

gp:
  - Defined in sage/intefaces/gp.py
  - Specifies name="pari" in the constructor
(sage/interfaces/gp.py:156), which would normally make gp(foo) try to
call foo._pari_(), but there is special case code in Expect.__call__
to change this to use foo._gp_() instead.
(sage/interfaces/expect.py:1056)
  -  foo._gp_(gp) which is supposed to return a GpElement
  - SageObject provides a default implementation of _gp_() which
calls SageObject._interface_(gp), which in turn tries to call
_pari_init_ (since gp has name="pari")
  - Generally, the thing returned from the _XXX_init_ methods is a
string, but what really matters is that it is some object such that
when it's passed to the __call__ method of the interface object, it
"returns the right thing".  See sage/structure/sage_object.pyx:387.
  - SageObject also defines a default implementation of _gp_init_
which just calls _pari_init_.  I don't think this function is run
anywhere.


pari:
 - Defined in sage/libs/pari/gen.pyx
 - Uses foo._pari_() which is supposed to return a PARI GEN object.
sage/libs/pari/gen.pyx:8414
 - SageObject defines a default implementation of _pari_() which will
try calling pari(foo._pari_init_()).
 - pari("string") will eventually call gp_read_str("string") which
should return a GEN object.

The idea behind all of the _XXX_ and _XXX_init_ methods is that _XXX_
returns the actual object whereas _XXX_init_ returns something which
is fed into the parent's __call__ method.

The reason why the PARI situation is a bit more complicated is that
anything string you return from _gp_init_ should be valid as a
_pari_init_ function.  We should really name the name="pari" in the gp
Expect object so that we can remove the special case code.  We should
then also just have the default implementation of _gp_init_ call
_pari_init_ so that if you just define that, it will work for both gp
and pari.
```

I think I understand what you're saying, I just don't understand why things are implemented like this.  If what you say is correct, then in almost no case it makes sense to have a `_pari_init_` function, since constructing an object through a string is almost certainly slower than using the PARI library. So we really should use `_pari_` instead of `_pari_init_`.

Then we should rename `_pari_init_` to `_gp_init_` because we still need the strings for the Gp interface (and specifying `name="gp"` instead of `name="pari"` in Gp and removing all the special case code).

What do you think?

I was a little too fast.  If an object has a `_pari_` method and a `_pari_init_` method, the `_pari_` method takes precedence, right?  So it doesn't hurt to have both (where `_pari_init` is then only used for Gp).

Yes, `_pari_` takes precedence over _pari_init_.  `_pari_init_` is only used in the default implmentation of _pari_.

SageObject provides default implementations of `_gp_` and `_gp_init_`, and most things are subclasses of SageObject.

I would be surprised if there weren't objects that used strings to construct objects in the PARI C library interface since it is the default implementation of !`pari(foo)`.
