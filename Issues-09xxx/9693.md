An almost complete 32-bit port of Sage 4.5.2 to Solaris 10 on x86 processors had been done on the following hardware:

* Dell OptiPlex 755
* 2.40 GHz Intel Quad-Core Core2 Q6600 CPU
* 8 GB RAM, 8 GB swap. 
* Solaris 10 update 5 (5/08) on x86 
* gcc 4.5.0 configured to use the Sun linker and GNU assembler
* sage-4.5.2.rc1 with several changes. 

the result printed during a doctest lacks a leading zero.

Following a suggestion of Carl Witty

I run

clearly showing the missing leading zero on this Solaris 10 x86 machine. 

Trying this on the same version of Sage, but this time on a SPARC processor with Solaris 10, the result is different:

```

```

Clearly this demonstrates a difference in the behaviour of the Maxima and ECL combination on Solaris 10 systems, where one has a SPARC processor and the other has an Intel Xeon processor. 

The version of ECL in this version of Sage is 10.2.1

Here's a couple of links to where this is discussed. 

* [Maxima mailing list](http://www.math.utexas.edu/pipermail/maxima/2010/022230.html)
* [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/43159b440ae83200)

It's not clear if the maxima developers consider this a bug or not - if they do, its certainly not considered a high priority for them to fix, so it looks like a fix in Sage is necessary. 

Note, other Maxima developers can redproduce this on some Linux systems, so it is not a specific to Solaris x86.

As discussed here

http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/351c46eb4cb91598/995e04912042c4be?lnk=gst&q=asinh#995e04912042c4be

I've changed the doctest to compute asinh(2.0) rather than asinh(1.0). Since asinh(2.0) is greater than one:

```
sage: maxima('asinh(2.0)')
1.44363547517881
```

there needs to be no leading zero, so the printing problem does not show. 

Whilst I can't guarantee every system will show 1.44363547517881, everyone who has tested this on their systems get **exactly** the same answer, so numerical rounding problems do not appear to exist here. Tests have been run on 

* Sun SPARC processors 
* Intel processors
* AMD processors

using the following systems. 

* sage.math (Linux)
* bsd.math (OS X)
* t2.math (Solaris 10 on SPARC)
* fulvia @ skynet (Solaris 10 on x86)
* My Sun Blade 1000 (Solaris 10). 
* My Sun Ultra 27 (OpenSolaris on x86) 
* 32-bit Linux system of John Cremona using an Intel processor
* 64-bit Linux system of John Cremona using an AMD Opteron processor. 

A more accurate result, computed using arbitrary precision arithmetic in Mathematica is:

```
In[4]:= N[ArcSinh[2],30]

Out[4]= 1.44363547517881034249327674027 
```

So every digit printed by Sage is correct.
