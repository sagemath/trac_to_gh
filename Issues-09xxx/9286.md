boehm_gc is one of the many standard packages in Sage (see #9281 for a list), which do not have a spkg-check file. This means that if one builds Sage with the environment variable SAGE_CHECK set to "yes", no self-tests of the package will be run. This is silly, as boehm_gc  has a test suite. 

After adding the required file, the test suite is run. This has been checked on OpenSolaris x64 in 64-bit mode and Solaris 10 SPARC in 32-bit mode.
