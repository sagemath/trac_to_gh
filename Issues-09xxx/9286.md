I read the patch and I approve.  I ran

```
sage -i http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/patches/boehm_gc-7.1.p6.spkg
```
which did not run any tests, and then 

```
SAGE_CHECK=yes sage -f -i http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/patches/boehm_gc-7.1.p6.spkg
```
which did.  All tests passed on
