I didn't check every page, but on http://sagenb.org/doc/live/tutorial/tour_algebra.html in the Solving Differential Equations section, some of the mass-spring differential equations are not shown.

If you compare that same section to the static tutorial, you will see the typeset equations (as images): http://sagenb.org/doc/static/tutorial/tour_algebra.html

This same problem also happens in other sections on that page.

Keywords: **live, tutorial, documentation, missing**

Component: **documentation**

<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

This is apparently resolved (perhaps it was a pre-mathjax issue), but I think that there *is* a very minor thing that in the live documentation the two equations in the system  somehow are typeset directly next to each other.

```

.. math::

    m_1 x_1'' + (k_1+k_2) x_1 - k_2 x_2 = 0

    m_2 x_2''+ k_2 (x_2-x_1) = 0,

```
somehow isn't rendering properly.
