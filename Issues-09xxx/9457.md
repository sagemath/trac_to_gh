Comparison of power series uses `list` instead of `padded_list`.  This drops trailing zeros, and means that power series equality is buggy:

```
sage: A.<t> = PowerSeriesRing(ZZ)
sage: g = t + t^3 + t^5 + O(t^6); g
t + t^3 + t^5 + O(t^6)
sage: g == t + O(t^3)   # should be True
False

sage: [g == g.add_bigoh(i) for i in range(7)]    # these should all be True
[True, False, True, False, True, False, True] 

sage: g.add_bigoh(3).list()  # drops trailing zero
[0, 1]
sage: g.add_bigoh(3).padded_list()
[0, 1, 0]
```

Hi!

The patches cleanly apply, and `sage -b` works.

The original problem is fixed:

```
sage: A.<t> = PowerSeriesRing(ZZ)
sage: g = t + t^3 + t^5 + O(t^6); g
t + t^3 + t^5 + O(t^6)
sage:
sage: [g == g.add_bigoh(i) for i in range(7)]
[True, True, True, True, True, True, True]
```

The code looks good to me. I am now running doctests.

One minor problem: Please mention the ticket number in the commit messages. So, please add something like "#9457: " to the commit messages of both patches

<a id='comment:8'></a>Here's the problem.

Without the patch:

```
sage: R.<T> = QQ.completion(5,5)[[]]
sage: R
Power Series Ring in T over 5-adic Field with capped relative precision 5
sage: O(T^2) == 0
False
```

With the patch:

```
sage: R.<T> = QQ.completion(5,5)[[]]
sage: R
Power Series Ring in T over 5-adic Field with capped relative precision 5
sage: O(T^2) == 0
True
```

I guess that the second answer is correct. Unfortunately, Sha.an_padic relies on the wrong answer.

<a id='comment:9'></a>Thanks, but I'm not sure I can tell how to fix this . . . I see in the code for `Sha.an_padic` the following lines:

```
# check consistency (the first two are only here to avoid a bug in the p-adic L-series
# (namely the coefficients of zero-relative precision are treated as zero)
if shan0 != 0 and shan1 != 0 and shan0 - shan1 != 0:
    raise RuntimeError, "There must be a bug in the supersingular routines for the p-adic BSD."
```

I suppose this is part of the problem but I don't see how to fix it . . . the two variables `shan0` and `shan1` are printed in the verbose output as "the two values for Sha"; the value of `shan1` is different depending on whether or not the patch is applied, but I have no idea which value is correct:

Without the patch:

```
sage: set_verbose(1)
sage: EllipticCurve('53a1').sha().an_padic(5)
 ...
verbose 1 (316: sha_tate.py, an_padic) ...putting things together
verbose 1 (316: sha_tate.py, an_padic) the two values for Sha : [1 + O(5), 0]
1 + O(5)
```


With the patch:

```
sage: set_verbose(1)
sage: EllipticCurve('53a1').sha().an_padic(5)
 ...
verbose 1 (316: sha_tate.py, an_padic) ...putting things together
verbose 1 (316: sha_tate.py, an_padic) the two values for Sha : [1 + O(5), 4 + O(5)]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
RuntimeError: There must be a bug in the supersingular routines for the p-adic BSD.

```

Note that simply removing the conditions `shan0 != 0 and shan1 != 0` (as implied by the inline comment) does not resolve the problem, since `shan0 != shan1` is `True` with the patch.  The values of `shan0` and `shan1` are computed by the function `pAdicLseriesSupersingular.Dp_valued_series`, which gives different output with and without the patch; again I have no idea which is correct.


Without the patch:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve('53a1')
sage: Et, D = E.minimal_quadratic_twist()
sage: lp = Et.padic_lseries(5)
sage: lps = lp.Dp_valued_series(4,quadratic_twist=D, prec=4)
sage: lps
(O(5^4) + (3 + O(5))*T + O(5)*T^2 + (4 + O(5))*T^3 + O(T^4), O(T^4))
```

With the patch:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve('53a1')
sage: Et, D = E.minimal_quadratic_twist()
sage: lp = Et.padic_lseries(5)
sage: lps = lp.Dp_valued_series(4,quadratic_twist=D, prec=4)
sage: lps
(O(5^4) + (3 + O(5))*T + O(5)*T^2 + (4 + O(5))*T^3 + O(T^4), O(5^5) + (4*5 + O(5^2))*T + O(5^2)*T^2 + (2*5 + O(5^2))*T^3 + O(T^4))
```

Note that every line of `pAdicLseriesSupersingular.Dp_valued_series` gives the same output with or without the patch, except for the very last one, which computes `lpv*eps.transpose()` where (with or without the patch)

```
lpv = (O(5^3) + (2*5^-1 + O(5^0))*T + O(5^0)*T^2 + (5^-1 + O(5^0))*T^3 + O(T^4), O(T^4))
```

and

```
eps.transpose() = 
[  5/9 25/18]
[-5/18   5/9]
```

Before I try to chase this further, I think we should try to determine whether the patch is causing `Dp_valued_series` to give the wrong answer, or whether the conditions on `shan0` and `shan1` should be changed.  Ideas?  If I've missed the point of your previous comment, could you explain how you determined that was the problem?

p.s. I haven't forgotten about fixing the commit messages; I'll do it after this is sorted out.

Hi Simon,

I believe I have identified the problem; I think it is a problem with negative valuation for p-adics.  First, here is what `Dp_valued_series` does:

With or without the patch, we have

```
sage: import sage.matrix.all as matrix
sage: p = 5
sage: prec = 2
sage: E = EllipticCurve('53a1')
sage: L = E.padic_lseries(5)
sage: lps = L.series(4)
sage: R = lps.base_ring().base_ring()
sage: QpT, T = PowerSeriesRing(R,'T',2).objgen()
sage: G = QpT([lps[n][0] for n in range(0,lps.prec())], prec)
sage: H = QpT([lps[n][1] for n in range(0,lps.prec())], prec)
sage: phi = matrix.matrix([[0,-1/p],[1,E.ap(p)/p]])
sage: lpv = vector([G  + (E.ap(p))*H  , - R(p) * H ])
sage: eps = (1-phi)**(-2)
sage: lpv
(O(5^3) + (2*5^-1 + O(5^0))*T + O(T^2), O(T^2))
sage: eps.transpose()
[  5/9 25/18]
[-5/18   5/9]
```

Now `Dp_valued_series` ends by returning `lpv*eps.transpose()`.

Without the patch:

```
sage: lpv*eps.transpose()
(O(5^4) + (3 + O(5))*T + O(T^2), O(T^2))
```

And with the patch:

```
sage: lpv*eps.transpose()
(O(5^4) + (3 + O(5))*T + O(T^2), O(5^5) + (4*5 + O(5^2))*T + O(T^2))
```

I had thought the with-patch answer was clearly right, until I tried the following (without the patch):

```
sage: a = vector([O(5^3) + (R(2/5).add_bigoh(0))*T + O(T^2), O(T^2)])
sage: M = matrix.matrix([[  0, 1],[0,  1]]); M
[0 1]
[0 1]
sage: a
(O(5^3) + (2*5^-1 + O(5^0))*T + O(T^2), O(T^2))
sage: lpv
(O(5^3) + (2*5^-1 + O(5^0))*T + O(T^2), O(T^2))
sage: a*M
(0, O(5^3) + (2*5^-1 + O(5^0))*T + O(T^2))
sage: lpv*M
(0, O(5^3) + (2*5^-1 + O(5^0))*T + O(T^2))

sage: M = matrix.matrix([[  0, 5],[0,  1]])
sage: a*M
(0, O(5^4) + (2 + O(5))*T + O(T^2))
sage: lpv*M
(0, O(T^2))
```

Now note the way `lpv[1]` is constructed: pull certain coefficients from `lps` and make a power series (of precision 2) in `QpT` with them.  Here is the list of coefficients for `H`:

```
sage: [lps[n][1] for n in range(0,lps.prec())]
[O(5^2), O(5^-1), O(5^-1), O(5^-1), O(5^-1)]
sage: H
O(T^2)
```

So the `O(T^2)` in `lpv[1]` should really be `O(5^2) + O(5^-1)*T + O(T^2)`, and this explains why `lpv*M` really should be `(0, O(T^2))` (when M has a 5 in the upper-right entry).

Here is a more direct test that passing to the power series ring over 5-adic field does not remember negative precision of 0 (this is without the patch):

```
sage: R(0).add_bigoh(-1)
O(5^-1)
sage: QpT(R(0).add_bigoh(-1))
0
sage: R(0).add_bigoh(-1).precision_absolute()
-1
sage: QpT(R(0).add_bigoh(-1))[0].precision_absolute()
+Infinity
sage: QpT(R(1/25).add_bigoh(-1))
5^-2 + O(5^-1)
sage: QpT(R(1/25).add_bigoh(-1))[0].precision_absolute()
-1
```

I believe the correct arithmetic should be as follows:

```
(O(5^3) + (2*5^-1 + O(5^0))*T + O(T^2), O(5^2) + O(5^-1)*T + O(T^2))*
[  5/9 25/18]
[-5/18   5/9]
```
should be

```
(O(5^3) + O(5^0)*T + O(T^2), O(5^3) + O(5^0)*T + O(T^2))
```
Does this seem right?  If this were the output of `Dp_valued_series`, then `EllipticCurve('53a1').sha().an_padic(5)` would increase the precision of `Dp_valued_series` from 2 to 3 and run it again; I tested this, and with this precision `EllipticCurve('53a1').sha().an_padic(5)` succeeds (with the patch applied!) and gives the expected answer.
 
So I believe the problem is a bug with power series over p-adics, rather than with this patch or with the elliptic curves code.  Does this seem right to you?  If so, one possible route at this stage is to modify the `an_padic` code so that rather than throwing the error it first runs another loop with additional precision, and then submit a separate trac ticket for the p-adic problem.  This is sort of dodging the issue, but helps keep the individual bugs separated.

<a id='comment:13'></a>Replying to [comment:12 niles]:

> So the `O(T^2)` in `lpv[1]` should really be `O(5^2) + O(5^-1)*T + O(T^2)`, and this explains why `lpv*M` really should be `(0, O(T^2))` (when M has a 5 in the upper-right entry).


oops, `lpv[1]` is `(-R(p)) * H`, so I guess it should be `O(5^3) + O(5^0)*T + O(T^2)`

and the arithmetic is:

```
(O(5^3) + (2*5^-1 + O(5^0))*T + O(T^2), O(5^3) + O(5^0)*T + O(T^2))*
[  5/9 25/18]
[-5/18   5/9]
```
should be

```
(O(5^4) + (3 + O(5))*T + O(T^2), O(5^4) + O(5)*T + O(T^2))
```
which will cause `an_padic` to still throw the error :(

In any case, computing with a higher precision does give the right answer with or without the patch.  I noticed there is an optional argument for this:

```
sage: set_verbose(1)
sage: EllipticCurve('53a1').sha().an_padic(5, prec=5)
 ...

> Of course, I offer my help with this as I am at the origin of the code that causes troubles.


Thanks :)  The last real progress I made in understanding this is up in comments [comment:13] and [comment:14], where I worked through the offending doctest by hand -- see [the block starting on line 632](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/master/src/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/sha_tate.py#L632).  

One helpful thing would be to verify the calculations below:

Using the objects constructed in comment [comment:13], sage says

```
sage: G
O(5^3) + (2*5^-1 + O(5^0))*T + O(T^2)
sage: H
O(T^2)
sage: lpv
(O(5^3) + (2*5^-1 + O(5^0))*T + O(T^2), O(T^2))
sage: eps.transpose()
[  5/9 25/18]
[-5/18   5/9]
```

I think that `H` is not correct, as it it built from the following list of coefficients

```
sage: [lps[n][1] for n in range(0,lps.prec())]
[O(5^2), O(5^-1), O(5^-1), O(5^-1), O(5^-1)]
```

So I think the correct value should be `H = O(5^2) + O(5^-1)*T + O(T^2)` and hence 
`-R(p) * H = O(5^3) + O(5^0)*T + O(T^2)`.  Converting `eps.transpose()` to the 5-adics `R`, so that I can check `lpv * eps.transpose()` by hand, I have

```
sage: Matrix(R,2,2,[R(_) for _ in eps.transpose().list()])
[      4*5 + 2*5^2 + 5^4 + 2*5^5 + O(5^6)     2*5^2 + 5^3 + 3*5^5 + 3*5^6 + O(5^7)]
[3*5 + 3*5^2 + 4*5^3 + 5^4 + 5^5 + O(5^6)       4*5 + 2*5^2 + 5^4 + 2*5^5 + O(5^6)]
```

Therefore `lpv * eps.transpose()` should be

```
( O(5^3) + (3 + O(5))*T + O(T^2) , O(5^4) + O(5^1)*T + O(T^2) )
```

Can you verify these calculations, and verify that if this were the output of `lpv*eps.transpose()`, then the rest of the code would work correctly and return `1`, as expected?  (I think I was confused about this last point when I made my comment [comment:14]; but this value for `lpv * eps.transpose()` should make `shan0 = 1` and `shan1 = 0`, and if I read the rest of that block correctly then this will lead to the expected output).


---

If the analysis above is right, then the only problem remaining to solve is why `H` is not computed correctly.  The problem seems to be that the power series ring over p-adics does not keep track of negative precision when there are no non-zero coefficients:

```
sage: R(0).add_bigoh(-1)
O(5^-1)
sage: QpT(R(0).add_bigoh(-1))
0   # should be same as line above

sage: QpT(1/25 + R(0).add_bigoh(-1))
5^-2 + O(5^-1)  # precision remembered when non-zero coefficients are present
```

I guess there is some problem with positive precision too:

```
sage: QpT(R(0).add_bigoh(1))
0
sage: QpT(1 + R(0).add_bigoh(1))
1 + O(5)
```

Is this issue already part of one of the other padic bug tickets?

This might be right . . . in my calculation above, the input to the vector*matrix multiplication is wrong, so I can't tell whether the matrix multiplication would also go wrong or not.

I think we should go there :)

Hmmm . . . that doctest is holding up some pretty reasonable fixes, but it's also the only reason that we noticed these padic problems in the first place so I'm extremely reluctant to take it out.  I think it is especially bad to take it out before we fully understand where the problems are coming from.

Weird; The commit linked by trac seems wrong, although the "Commit" field is correct.  The branch should point to [e2219602...](http://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/diff/?id=e2219602a9d360f465ad79b098e4f923765ab791).  Here are some other links you can look at, which seem to have the branch pointing at the correct commit:

* [log graph with u/niles/ticket/9457 at the top](http://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/log/?h=u/niles/ticket/9457)
* [commit labeled u/niles/ticket/9457](http://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit/?h=u/niles/ticket/9457)

I think the changes listed in comment [comment:21] came from trying to merge some other ticket branches with this one, which I think I should not have done.  Or rather, I should not have deleted that branch and replaced it with a new one having the same name -- that's probably causing confusion for trac.

<a id='comment:42'></a>This is fantastic!!  Thanks for seeing it through :)

`padded_list` is indeed slower -- I just suggested it as a simple workaround for the stopgap warning.

The confounding doctest seems to be behaving correctly now -- the intermediate steps are consistent with my calculations by hand above, and the verbose output is as expected (given that there are still other problems with padics):

```
sage: EllipticCurve('53a1').sha().an_padic(5)
...
verbose 1 (431: sha_tate.py, an_padic) ...computing the p-adic L-series
verbose 1 (1059: padic_lseries.py, series) using p-adic precision of 4
verbose 1 (1059: padic_lseries.py, series) Now iterating over 100 summands
verbose 1 (431: sha_tate.py, an_padic) the leading terms : [0, 0]
verbose 1 (431: sha_tate.py, an_padic) increased precision to 4
verbose 1 (1059: padic_lseries.py, series) using p-adic precision of 5
verbose 1 (1059: padic_lseries.py, series) Now iterating over 500 summands
verbose 1 (431: sha_tate.py, an_padic) the leading terms : [3 + O(5), 0]
verbose 1 (431: sha_tate.py, an_padic) ...putting things together
verbose 1 (431: sha_tate.py, an_padic) the two values for Sha : [1 + O(5), 0]
1 + O(5)
