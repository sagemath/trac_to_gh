Comparison of power series uses `list` instead of `padded_list`.  This drops trailing zeros, and means that power series equality is buggy:

```
sage: A.<t> = PowerSeriesRing(ZZ)
sage: g = t + t^3 + t^5 + O(t^6); g
t + t^3 + t^5 + O(t^6)
sage: g == t + O(t^3)   # should be True
False

sage: [g == g.add_bigoh(i) for i in range(7)]    # these should all be True
[True, False, True, False, True, False, True] 

sage: g.add_bigoh(3).list()  # drops trailing zero
[0, 1]
sage: g.add_bigoh(3).padded_list()
[0, 1, 0]
```

Replaced padded_list() with padded_list(prec) because of

```
sage: A.<t> = PowerSeriesRing(ZZ)
sage: f = t + t^2 + O(t^10)
sage: f == f.truncate()
False
sage: f.truncate().padded_list()

```

This brought up a problem with padded_list(infinity), which is also now patched

```
sage: A.<t> = PowerSeriesRing(ZZ)
sage: f = t + t^2 + O(t**10)
sage: f.padded_list()
[0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
sage: f.padded_list(infinity)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...

Hi!

The patches cleanly apply, and `sage -b` works.

The original problem is fixed:

```
sage: A.<t> = PowerSeriesRing(ZZ)
sage: g = t + t^3 + t^5 + O(t^6); g
t + t^3 + t^5 + O(t^6)
sage:
sage: [g == g.add_bigoh(i) for i in range(7)]
[True, True, True, True, True, True, True]
```

The code looks good to me. I am now running doctests.

One minor problem: Please mention the ticket number in the commit messages. So, please add something like "#9457: " to the commit messages of both patches

Here's the problem.

Without the patch:

```
sage: R.<T> = QQ.completion(5,5)[[]]
sage: R
Power Series Ring in T over 5-adic Field with capped relative precision 5
sage: O(T^2) == 0
False
```

With the patch:

```
sage: R.<T> = QQ.completion(5,5)[[]]
sage: R
Power Series Ring in T over 5-adic Field with capped relative precision 5
sage: O(T^2) == 0
True
```

I guess that the second answer is correct. Unfortunately, Sha.an_padic relies on the wrong answer.

Thanks, but I'm not sure I can tell how to fix this . . . I see in the code for `Sha.an_padic` the following lines:

```
# check consistency (the first two are only here to avoid a bug in the p-adic L-series
# (namely the coefficients of zero-relative precision are treated as zero)
if shan0 != 0 and shan1 != 0 and shan0 - shan1 != 0:
    raise RuntimeError, "There must be a bug in the supersingular routines for the p-adic BSD."
```

I suppose this is part of the problem but I don't see how to fix it . . . the two variables `shan0` and `shan1` are printed in the verbose output as "the two values for Sha"; the value of `shan1` is different depending on whether or not the patch is applied, but I have no idea which value is correct:

Without the patch:

```
sage: set_verbose(1)
sage: EllipticCurve('53a1').sha().an_padic(5)
 ...
verbose 1 (316: sha_tate.py, an_padic) ...putting things together
verbose 1 (316: sha_tate.py, an_padic) the two values for Sha : [1 + O(5), 0]
1 + O(5)
```


With the patch:

```
sage: set_verbose(1)
sage: EllipticCurve('53a1').sha().an_padic(5)
 ...
verbose 1 (316: sha_tate.py, an_padic) ...putting things together
verbose 1 (316: sha_tate.py, an_padic) the two values for Sha : [1 + O(5), 4 + O(5)]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
RuntimeError: There must be a bug in the supersingular routines for the p-adic BSD.

```

Note that simply removing the conditions `shan0 != 0 and shan1 != 0` (as implied by the inline comment) does not resolve the problem, since `shan0 != shan1` is `True` with the patch.  The values of `shan0` and `shan1` are computed by the function `pAdicLseriesSupersingular.Dp_valued_series`, which gives different output with and without the patch; again I have no idea which is correct.


Without the patch:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve('53a1')
sage: Et, D = E.minimal_quadratic_twist()
sage: lp = Et.padic_lseries(5)
sage: lps = lp.Dp_valued_series(4,quadratic_twist=D, prec=4)
sage: lps
(O(5^4) + (3 + O(5))*T + O(5)*T^2 + (4 + O(5))*T^3 + O(T^4), O(T^4))
```

With the patch:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve('53a1')
sage: Et, D = E.minimal_quadratic_twist()
sage: lp = Et.padic_lseries(5)
sage: lps = lp.Dp_valued_series(4,quadratic_twist=D, prec=4)
sage: lps
(O(5^4) + (3 + O(5))*T + O(5)*T^2 + (4 + O(5))*T^3 + O(T^4), O(5^5) + (4*5 + O(5^2))*T + O(5^2)*T^2 + (2*5 + O(5^2))*T^3 + O(T^4))
```

Note that every line of `pAdicLseriesSupersingular.Dp_valued_series` gives the same output with or without the patch, except for the very last one, which computes `lpv*eps.transpose()` where (with or without the patch)

```
lpv = (O(5^3) + (2*5^-1 + O(5^0))*T + O(5^0)*T^2 + (5^-1 + O(5^0))*T^3 + O(T^4), O(T^4))
```

and

```
eps.transpose() = 
[  5/9 25/18]
[-5/18   5/9]
```

Before I try to chase this further, I think we should try to determine whether the patch is causing `Dp_valued_series` to give the wrong answer, or whether the conditions on `shan0` and `shan1` should be changed.  Ideas?  If I've missed the point of your previous comment, could you explain how you determined that was the problem?

p.s. I haven't forgotten about fixing the commit messages; I'll do it after this is sorted out.

First, here is what `Dp_valued_series` does:\n\nWith or without the patch, we have\n\n```\nsage: import sage.matrix.all as matrix\nsage: p = 5\nsage: prec = 2\nsage: E = EllipticCurve('53a1')\nsage: L = E.padic_lseries(5)\nsage: lps = L.series(4)\nsage: R = lps.base_ring().base_ring()\nsage: QpT, T = PowerSeriesRing(R,'T',2).objgen()\nsage: G = QpT([lps[n][0] for n in range(0,lps.prec())], prec)\nsage: H = QpT([lps[n][1] for n in range(0,lps.prec())], prec)\nsage: phi = matrix.matrix([[0,-1/p],[1,E.ap(p)/p]])\nsage: lpv = vector([G  + (E.ap(p))*H  , - R(p) * H ])\nsage: eps = (1-phi)**(-2)\nsage: lpv\n(O(5^3) + (2*5^-1 + O(5^0))*T + O(T^2), O(T^2))\nsage: eps.transpose()\n[  5/9 25/18]\n[-5/18   5/9]\n```\n\nNow `Dp_valued_series` ends by returning `lpv*eps.transpose()`.\n\nWithout the patch:\n\n```\nsage: lpv*eps.transpose()\n(O(5^4) + (3 + O(5))*T + O(T^2), O(T^2))\n```\n\nAnd with the patch:\n\n```\nsage: lpv*eps.transpose()\n(O(5^4) + (3 + O(5))*T + O(T^2), O(5^5) + (4*5 + O(5^2))*T + O(T^2))\n```\n\nI had thought the with-patch answer was clearly right, until I tried the following (without the patch):\n\n```\nsage: a = vector([O(5^3) + (R(2/5).add_bigoh(0))*T + O(T^2), O(T^2)])\nsage: M = matrix.matrix([[  0, 1],[0,  1]]); M\n[0 1]\n[0 1]\nsage: a\n(O(5^3) + (2*5^-1 + O(5^0))*T + O(T^2), O(T^2))\nsage: lpv\n(O(5^3) + (2*5^-1 + O(5^0))*T + O(T^2), O(T^2))\nsage: a*M\n(0, O(5^3) + (2*5^-1 + O(5^0))*T + O(T^2))\nsage: lpv*M\n(0, O(5^3) + (2*5^-1 + O(5^0))*T + O(T^2))\n\nsage: M = matrix.matrix([[  0, 5],[0,  1]])\nsage: a*M\n(0, O(5^4) + (2 + O(5))*T + O(T^2))\nsage: lpv*M\n(0, O(T^2))\n```\n\nNow note the way `lpv[1]` is constructed: pull certain coefficients from `lps` and make a power series (of precision 2) in `QpT` with them.  Here is the list of coefficients for `H`:\n\n```\nsage: [lps[n][1] for n in range(0,lps.prec())]\n[O(5^2), O(5^-1), O(5^-1), O(5^-1), O(5^-1)]\nsage: H\nO(T^2)\n```\n\nSo the `O(T^2)` in `lpv[1]` should really be `O(5^2) + O(5^-1)*T + O(T^2)`, and this explains why `lpv*M` really should be `(0, O(T^2))` (when M has a 5 in the upper-right entry).\n\nHere is a more direct test that passing to the power series ring over 5-adic field does not remember negative precision of 0 (this is without the patch):\n\n```\nsage: R(0).add_bigoh(-1)\nO(5^-1)\nsage: QpT(R(0).add_bigoh(-1))\n0\nsage: R(0).add_bigoh(-1).precision_absolute()\n-1\nsage: QpT(R(0).add_bigoh(-1))[0].precision_absolute()\n+Infinity\nsage: QpT(R(1/25).add_bigoh(-1))\n5^-2 + O(5^-1)\nsage: QpT(R(1/25).add_bigoh(-1))[0].precision_absolute()\n-1\n```\n\nI believe the correct arithmetic should be as follows:\n\n```\n(O(5^3) + (2*5^-1 + O(5^0))*T + O(T^2), O(5^2) + O(5^-1)*T + O(T^2))*\n[  5/9 25/18]\n[-5/18   5/9]\n```\nshould be\n\n```\n(O(5^3) + O(5^0)*T + O(T^2), O(5^3) + O(5^0)*T + O(T^2))\n```\nDoes this seem right?  If this were the output of `Dp_valued_series`, then `EllipticCurve('53a1').sha().an_padic(5)` would increase the precision of `Dp_valued_series` from 2 to 3 and run it again; I tested this, and with this precision `EllipticCurve('53a1').sha().an_padic(5)` succeeds (with the patch applied!) and gives the expected answer.\n \nSo I believe the problem is a bug with power series over p-adics, rather than with this patch or with the elliptic curves code.  Does this seem right to you?  If so, one possible route at this stage is to modify the `an_padic` code so that rather than throwing the error it first runs another loop with additional precision, and then submit a separate trac ticket for the p-adic problem.  This is sort of dodging the issue, but helps keep the individual bugs separated.",

Hi Simon,

I believe I have identified the problem; I think it is a problem with negative valuation for p-adics.  First, here is what `Dp_valued_series` does:

With or without the patch, we have

```
sage: import sage.matrix.all as matrix
sage: p = 5
sage: prec = 2
sage: E = EllipticCurve('53a1')
sage: L = E.padic_lseries(5)
sage: lps = L.series(4)
sage: R = lps.base_ring().base_ring()
sage: QpT, T = PowerSeriesRing(R,'T',2).objgen()
sage: G = QpT([lps[n][0] for n in range(0,lps.prec())], prec)
sage: H = QpT([lps[n][1] for n in range(0,lps.prec())], prec)
sage: phi = matrix.matrix([[0,-1/p],[1,E.ap(p)/p]])
sage: lpv = vector([G  + (E.ap(p))*H  , - R(p) * H ])
sage: eps = (1-phi)**(-2)
sage: lpv
(O(5^3) + (2*5^-1 + O(5^0))*T + O(T^2), O(T^2))
sage: eps.transpose()
[  5/9 25/18]
[-5/18   5/9]
```

Now `Dp_valued_series` ends by returning `lpv*eps.transpose()`.

Without the patch:

```
sage: lpv*eps.transpose()
(O(5^4) + (3 + O(5))*T + O(T^2), O(T^2))
```

And with the patch:

```
sage: lpv*eps.transpose()
(O(5^4) + (3 + O(5))*T + O(T^2), O(5^5) + (4*5 + O(5^2))*T + O(T^2))
```

I had thought the with-patch answer was clearly right, until I tried the following (without the patch):

```
sage: a = vector([O(5^3) + (R(2/5).add_bigoh(0))*T + O(T^2), O(T^2)])
sage: M = matrix.matrix([[  0, 1],[0,  1]]); M
[0 1]
[0 1]
sage: a
(O(5^3) + (2*5^-1 + O(5^0))*T + O(T^2), O(T^2))
sage: lpv
(O(5^3) + (2*5^-1 + O(5^0))*T + O(T^2), O(T^2))
sage: a*M
(0, O(5^3) + (2*5^-1 + O(5^0))*T + O(T^2))
sage: lpv*M
(0, O(5^3) + (2*5^-1 + O(5^0))*T + O(T^2))

sage: M = matrix.matrix([[  0, 5],[0,  1]])
sage: a*M
(0, O(5^4) + (2 + O(5))*T + O(T^2))
sage: lpv*M
(0, O(T^2))
```

Now note the way `lpv[1]` is constructed: pull certain coefficients from `lps` and make a power series (of precision 2) in `QpT` with them.  Here is the list of coefficients for `H`:

```
sage: [lps[n][1] for n in range(0,lps.prec())]
[O(5^2), O(5^-1), O(5^-1), O(5^-1), O(5^-1)]
sage: H
O(T^2)
```

So the `O(T^2)` in `lpv[1]` should really be `O(5^2) + O(5^-1)*T + O(T^2)`, and this explains why `lpv*M` really should be `(0, O(T^2))` (when M has a 5 in the upper-right entry).

Here is a more direct test that passing to the power series ring over 5-adic field does not remember negative precision of 0 (this is without the patch):

```
sage: R(0).add_bigoh(-1)
O(5^-1)
sage: QpT(R(0).add_bigoh(-1))
0
sage: R(0).add_bigoh(-1).precision_absolute()
-1
sage: QpT(R(0).add_bigoh(-1))[0].precision_absolute()
+Infinity
sage: QpT(R(1/25).add_bigoh(-1))
5^-2 + O(5^-1)
sage: QpT(R(1/25).add_bigoh(-1))[0].precision_absolute()
-1
```

I believe the correct arithmetic should be as follows:

```
(O(5^3) + (2*5^-1 + O(5^0))*T + O(T^2), O(5^2) + O(5^-1)*T + O(T^2))*
[  5/9 25/18]
[-5/18   5/9]
```
should be

```
(O(5^3) + O(5^0)*T + O(T^2), O(5^3) + O(5^0)*T + O(T^2))
```
Does this seem right?  If this were the output of `Dp_valued_series`, then `EllipticCurve('53a1').sha().an_padic(5)` would increase the precision of `Dp_valued_series` from 2 to 3 and run it again; I tested this, and with this precision `EllipticCurve('53a1').sha().an_padic(5)` succeeds (with the patch applied!) and gives the expected answer.
 
So I believe the problem is a bug with power series over p-adics, rather than with this patch or with the elliptic curves code.  Does this seem right to you?  If so, one possible route at this stage is to modify the `an_padic` code so that rather than throwing the error it first runs another loop with additional precision, and then submit a separate trac ticket for the p-adic problem.  This is sort of dodging the issue, but helps keep the individual bugs separated.

> So the `O(T^2)` in `lpv[1]` should really be `O(5^2) + O(5^-1)*T + O(T^2)`, and this explains why `lpv*M` really should be `(0, O(T^2))` (when M has a 5 in the upper-right entry).

oops, `lpv[1]` is `(-R(p)) * H`, so I guess it should be `O(5^3) + O(5^0)*T + O(T^2)`

and the arithmetic is:

```
(O(5^3) + (2*5^-1 + O(5^0))*T + O(T^2), O(5^3) + O(5^0)*T + O(T^2))*
[  5/9 25/18]
[-5/18   5/9]
```
should be

```
(O(5^4) + (3 + O(5))*T + O(T^2), O(5^4) + O(5)*T + O(T^2))
```
which will cause `an_padic` to still throw the error :(

In any case, computing with a higher precision does give the right answer with or without the patch.  I noticed there is an optional argument for this:

```
sage: set_verbose(1)
sage: EllipticCurve('53a1').sha().an_padic(5, prec=5)
 ...

Converting `eps.transpose()` to the 5-adics `R`, so that I can check `lpv * eps.transpose()` by hand, I have\n\n```\nsage: Matrix(R,2,2,[R(_) for _ in eps.transpose().list()])\n[      4*5 + 2*5^2 + 5^4 + 2*5^5 + O(5^6)     2*5^2 + 5^3 + 3*5^5 + 3*5^6 + O(5^7)]\n[3*5 + 3*5^2 + 4*5^3 + 5^4 + 5^5 + O(5^6)       4*5 + 2*5^2 + 5^4 + 2*5^5 + O(5^6)]\n```\n\nTherefore `lpv * eps.transpose()` should be\n\n```\n( O(5^3) + (3 + O(5))*T + O(T^2) , O(5^4) + O(5^1)*T + O(T^2) )\n```\n\nCan you verify these calculations, and verify that if this were the output of `lpv*eps.transpose()`, then the rest of the code would work correctly and return `1`, as expected?  (I think I was confused about this last point when I made my comment [comment:14]; but this value for `lpv * eps.transpose()` should make `shan0 = 1` and `shan1 = 0`, and if I read the rest of that block correctly then this will lead to the expected output).\n\n\n---\n\nIf the analysis above is right, then the only problem remaining to solve is why `H` is not computed correctly.

Thanks :)  The last real progress I made in understanding this is up in comments [comment:13] and [comment:14], where I worked through the offending doctest by hand -- see [the block starting on line 632](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/master/src/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/sha_tate.py#L632).  

One helpful thing would be to verify the calculations below:

Using the objects constructed in comment [comment:13], sage says

```
sage: G
O(5^3) + (2*5^-1 + O(5^0))*T + O(T^2)
sage: H
O(T^2)
sage: lpv
(O(5^3) + (2*5^-1 + O(5^0))*T + O(T^2), O(T^2))
sage: eps.transpose()
[  5/9 25/18]
[-5/18   5/9]
```

I think that `H` is not correct, as it it built from the following list of coefficients

```
sage: [lps[n][1] for n in range(0,lps.prec())]
[O(5^2), O(5^-1), O(5^-1), O(5^-1), O(5^-1)]
```

So I think the correct value should be `H = O(5^2) + O(5^-1)*T + O(T^2)` and hence 
`-R(p) * H = O(5^3) + O(5^0)*T + O(T^2)`.  Converting `eps.transpose()` to the 5-adics `R`, so that I can check `lpv * eps.transpose()` by hand, I have

```
sage: Matrix(R,2,2,[R(_) for _ in eps.transpose().list()])
[      4*5 + 2*5^2 + 5^4 + 2*5^5 + O(5^6)     2*5^2 + 5^3 + 3*5^5 + 3*5^6 + O(5^7)]
[3*5 + 3*5^2 + 4*5^3 + 5^4 + 5^5 + O(5^6)       4*5 + 2*5^2 + 5^4 + 2*5^5 + O(5^6)]
```

Therefore `lpv * eps.transpose()` should be

```
( O(5^3) + (3 + O(5))*T + O(T^2) , O(5^4) + O(5^1)*T + O(T^2) )
```

Can you verify these calculations, and verify that if this were the output of `lpv*eps.transpose()`, then the rest of the code would work correctly and return `1`, as expected?  (I think I was confused about this last point when I made my comment [comment:14]; but this value for `lpv * eps.transpose()` should make `shan0 = 1` and `shan1 = 0`, and if I read the rest of that block correctly then this will lead to the expected output).


---

If the analysis above is right, then the only problem remaining to solve is why `H` is not computed correctly.  The problem seems to be that the power series ring over p-adics does not keep track of negative precision when there are no non-zero coefficients:

```
sage: R(0).add_bigoh(-1)
O(5^-1)
sage: QpT(R(0).add_bigoh(-1))
0   # should be same as line above

sage: QpT(1/25 + R(0).add_bigoh(-1))
5^-2 + O(5^-1)  # precision remembered when non-zero coefficients are present
```

I guess there is some problem with positive precision too:

```
sage: QpT(R(0).add_bigoh(1))
0
sage: QpT(1 + R(0).add_bigoh(1))
1 + O(5)
```

Is this issue already part of one of the other padic bug tickets?

I try to remember what happened 4 years ago. I think I discovered exactly the same problem as you. First some bug, then fixing that gave an error for sha_tate in the supersingular case. This was due to the Dp_valued series return the wrong result. Chasing that I came to #8198, where I got stuck becasue (at the time) I did not know how I could fix that. 

So let's make a list - as there are several overlapping tickets and issues:

* (see #4656) is_zero is broken for power series. This causes your `QpT( O(5^-1))` to print as zero. It remembers that it is not, if you have .list you see its first coefficient is still `O(5^-1)`. We should change `__nonzero__` in power_series_poly.pyx

* (see #4656, too) power series compare wrongly. Your suggestion to use padded_list above is better than what I tried to do in the other ticket. That is cmp in power_series_ring_element.pyx

* (see #4656) power series also print wrongly. You would expect the inexact coefficients of the form `O(p^2)` to print, too. I tried to change that in the other ticket. That is `_repr_` in power_series_ring_element.pyx

* (see #8198) Matrix multiplication on p-adics looses precision. I believe that is the heart of the problem for getting the right answer for this Dp_series. If I understand correctly you have spotted the same thing above.

* There is also #5075 which I have never looked at myself.

We could take the out the doc-string in sha-tate out for now, so that this and #4656 can be closed. Then reintroduce it if we can fix #8198.

This might be right . . . in my calculation above, the input to the vector*matrix multiplication is wrong, so I can't tell whether the matrix multiplication would also go wrong or not.

I think we should go there :)

Hmmm . . . that doctest is holding up some pretty reasonable fixes, but it's also the only reason that we noticed these padic problems in the first place so I'm extremely reluctant to take it out.  I think it is especially bad to take it out before we fully understand where the problems are coming from.

Weird; The commit linked by trac seems wrong, although the "Commit" field is correct.  The branch should point to [e2219602...](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/e2219602a9d360f465ad79b098e4f923765ab791).

* [commit labeled u/niles/ticket/9457](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commits/u/niles/ticket/9457)

I think the changes listed in comment [comment:21] came from trying to merge some other ticket branches with this one, which I think I should not have done.  Or rather, I should not have deleted that branch and replaced it with a new one having the same name -- that's probably causing confusion for trac.

Yes, that is mine now. That may take me soem time to fix. This is really a new bug, which was not apparent with the bug fixed here. So my suggestion would be to comment out the failing test, to open a new ticket and to fix the new bug in a separate ticket as they are unrelated topics. Though I am not sure that is the way we should do it.

In any case, I start looking into the issue.

This is fantastic!!  Thanks for seeing it through :)

`padded_list` is indeed slower -- I just suggested it as a simple workaround for the stopgap warning.

The confounding doctest seems to be behaving correctly now -- the intermediate steps are consistent with my calculations by hand above, and the verbose output is as expected (given that there are still other problems with padics):

```
sage: EllipticCurve('53a1').sha().an_padic(5)
...
verbose 1 (431: sha_tate.py, an_padic) ...computing the p-adic L-series
verbose 1 (1059: padic_lseries.py, series) using p-adic precision of 4
verbose 1 (1059: padic_lseries.py, series) Now iterating over 100 summands
verbose 1 (431: sha_tate.py, an_padic) the leading terms : [0, 0]
verbose 1 (431: sha_tate.py, an_padic) increased precision to 4
verbose 1 (1059: padic_lseries.py, series) using p-adic precision of 5
verbose 1 (1059: padic_lseries.py, series) Now iterating over 500 summands
verbose 1 (431: sha_tate.py, an_padic) the leading terms : [3 + O(5), 0]
verbose 1 (431: sha_tate.py, an_padic) ...putting things together
verbose 1 (431: sha_tate.py, an_padic) the two values for Sha : [1 + O(5), 0]
1 + O(5)
```
