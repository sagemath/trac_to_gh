With Sage 4.5.2.rc1 and the patch [attachment:trac_9686.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9686/trac_9686.patch), building the reference manual produces the following warning:

This is due to how the added list are indented. The indentation of lists in the enclosing method, i.e. `canonical_label`, is inconsistent. Look at how the list of input is indented as compared with the list immediately following the first docstring line and the new list proposed by the patch [The reviewer patch [attachment:trac_9686-reviewer.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9686/trac_9686-reviewer.patch)(https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9686/2ecd3fb75feb3ede19798b9cb3764b61) should restore some consistency in how lists in `canonical_label` are indented. The reviewer patch also resolves the above warning.
