This is due to how the added list are indented. The indentation of lists in the enclosing method, i.e. `canonical_label`, is inconsistent. Look at how the list of input is indented as compared with the list immediately following the first docstring line and the new list proposed by the patch [attachment: trac_9686.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9686/trac_9686.patch.gz).

The reviewer patch also resolves the above warning.
