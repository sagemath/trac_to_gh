As discussed in 

https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/sage-devel/gsl%7Csort:relevance/sage-devel/vCeJAicIG9I/Fas5z8JVmEEJ

the proper place for `src/sage/gsl` is somewhere else. The goal of this ticket is to move all files in `src/sage/gsl`.

The plan is as follows:

- `dft` discrete fourier transform -> `src/sage/calculus/transforms`
- `dwt` dicrete wavelet transform -> `src/sage/calculus/transforms`
- `fft` fast fourier transform -> `src/sage/calculus/transforms`
- `gsl_array` -> `src/sage/libs/gsl` and renamed to `array` 
- `integration` numerical integral -> `src/sage/calculus`
- `interpolation` -> `src/sage/calculus`
- `ode` ordinary differential equation -> `src/sage/calculus`
- `probability_distribution` -> `src/sage/probability`

<a id='comment:10'></a>I disagree with the premise of this ticket.

I believe that `src/sage/libs` is a place purely for the library interface and nothing more. Making classes and implementing functionality using that library belongs somewhere else.

To use an example: a Sage `Integer` wraps a GMP/MPIR `mpz_t`. The GMP/MPIR library interface belongs in `src/sage/libs/gmp`, but the `Integer` class does not (because it does a lot more than strictly wrapping the GMP/MPIR library).

I understand that. But on the other hand, don't you agree that `gsl` is too specific to be placed just under `src/sage`, where all other subfolders  correspond to rather big (mathematical) themes?

And it seems to me that  there are already files under `src/sage/libs/xxx` that contain classes implementing functionality using the libraries. For example, look into `eclib`. No?

I think that `src/libs/gsl` is not an ideal place but less bad than just under `src/sage`. Could you suggest a better palce?
