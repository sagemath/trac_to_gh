As discussed in 

https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/sage-devel/gsl%7Csort:relevance/sage-devel/vCeJAicIG9I/Fas5z8JVmEEJ

the proper place for `src/sage/gsl` is somewhere else. The goal of this ticket is to move all files in `src/sage/gsl`.

The plan is as follows:

- `dft` discrete fourier transform -> `src/sage/calculus/transforms`
- `dwt` dicrete wavelet transform -> `src/sage/calculus/transforms`
- `fft` fast fourier transform -> `src/sage/calculus/transforms`
- `gsl_array` -> `src/sage/libs/gsl` and renamed to `array` 
- `integration` numerical integral -> `src/sage/calculus`
- `interpolation` -> `src/sage/calculus`
- `ode` ordinary differential equation -> `src/sage/calculus`
- `probability_distribution` -> `src/sage/probability`

Should be an easy review, this just moved stuff around. I took the opportunity to change them from .pxi files to .pxd files, which they really should have been originally, so now they're cimported rather than included. 

Apply bundle with "hg pull /path/to/9084-move-gsl.hg". I've created a bundle to preserve the history across the file moves.

I disagree with the premise of this ticket.

I believe that `src/sage/libs` is a place purely for the library interface and nothing more. Making classes and implementing functionality using that library belongs somewhere else.

To use an example: a Sage `Integer` wraps a GMP/MPIR `mpz_t`. The GMP/MPIR library interface belongs in `src/sage/libs/gmp`, but the `Integer` class does not (because it does a lot more than strictly wrapping the GMP/MPIR library).

I understand that. But on the other hand, don't you agree that `gsl` is too specific to be placed just under `src/sage`, where all other subfolders  correspond to rather big (mathematical) themes?

And it seems to me that  there are already files under `src/sage/libs/xxx` that contain classes implementing functionality using the libraries. For example, look into `eclib`. No?

I think that `src/libs/gsl` is not an ideal place but less bad than just under `src/sage`. Could you suggest a better palce?
