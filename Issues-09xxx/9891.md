Reported by Kees on sage-support:

http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/t/bfa34b077dd31b73

```
Running the following few lines:

eq=5-e^x
print "1:",eq.substitute(x=3*x)
print "2:",eq.substitute(x=log(x))

yields the output (Sage 4.5.2 with Ubuntu):

1: -e^(3*x) + 5
2: -log(x) + 5
```

Okay, this is fine.

Burcin, I have to say I feel a little odd saying that I'm reviewing Kreckel's work, when I'm really reviewing your merging his work and your doctest (though I looked at the actual patch, naturally).  Is there a different way to put the author in?  You are the author of the actual patch here, not the Ginac update; I don't think any other spkgs put upstream people who committed things in this way.
