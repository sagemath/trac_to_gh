The latest version of PARI has a function `hash_GEN` which hashes a PARI `GEN`.  Since this is very likely faster than hashing the string representation of a `GEN`, we should use this for the `gen` class in sage/libs/pari/gen.pyx

This patch has been included in #9764.

Hi,

For the record, this change introduced a major bug into Sage, because PARI's hash_GEN is itself buggy.  For example, by playing with ideals in Sage (code is complicated though...), I quickly got into this situation:

```
sage: n0
[11, 3; 0, 1]
sage: n1
[11, 3; 0, 1]
sage: hash(n0)
-7493989779944505307
sage: hash(n1)
-6341068275337658331
```

See #11611, I have not tracked it down precisely.

Don't blaim PARI when the fault is the Sage->PARI interface. The issue is not `hash_GEN()`, it is a problem with how integers are converted from Sage to PARI.  I have a patch for this issue at #11611.
