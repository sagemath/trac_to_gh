The first patch adds the documentation.  However the docstrings are all pre-rest, so look like crap.  E.g., see 

    http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/wstein/build/sage-4.4.4.alpha0/devel/sage/doc/output/html/en/reference/finance.html

or just apply the patch, then do `sage -docbuild reference html` and look at `output/html/en/reference/` for yourself.

A second patch will fix all the formatting.
