Here's a new spkg:

This installs for me on sage.math and on an OS X box.

It even works on PPC!

I did find an error in kash.py

```
sage: a = kash('(9 - 7) * (5 + 6)'); a              # optional -- kash

22
```
so I get "expected nothing" for that one test when I do `./sage -t -optional devel/sage/sage/interfaces/kash.py`.

Otherwise seems like this is reasonable.  Fix that and positive review, modulo my weak understanding of shell script - but the options are the right ones on Mac.  What the heck are those Linux options?

By the way, the development of KASH seems to have abruptly stopped.  Any chance it will resume?
