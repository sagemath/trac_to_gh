I haven't yet fixed the documentation results, since the returned lists are different, mainly to highlight the differences... Also I'm not entirely sure I have the code exactly right, maybe you can verify this. I also think that the references need updating/completing.

In principle, I agree with the changes. Certainly the additive primes must go in that list.

When it comes to the the condition on the mod-p representation, I would propose to wait. I have submitted a correction for the article proving this. But before I get the confirmation that everything is fine now, I would not want to change this back in sage. Also there will be other places as in p_primary_bound where a change will be needed in that case.

Do you want to wait ? Or do you want to fix the issue with the additive first and open another ticket when/if the corrections are accepted ?

Chris.

Chris,

Replying to [@categorie](#comment%3A2):
> Do you want to wait ? Or do you want to fix the issue with the additive first and open another ticket when/if the corrections are accepted ?

I am not in favor of waiting. Let's get the patch up to speed with what is currently known and verified, and update the function once we're ready to.

In order to get an acceptable patch for now, are you saying that the only change should be to add in the additive primes? If so I can modify my patch to do only that.
