There is a fly in the ointment:

During one of the last NetworkX upgrades, many common Sage graph constructors were modified to give empty dictionaries as labels instead of None. I have been intending to fix many of Sage's graph generators not to depend on NetworkX (since simply constructing a CGraph would be much quicker), and revert the edge situation back to having labels equal to `None`. But until that happens, this patch causes several failures:

```
sage -t -long "devel/sage-main/sage/graphs/generic_graph.py"
sage -t -long "devel/sage-main/sage/graphs/base/sparse_graph.pyx"
sage -t -long "devel/sage-main/sage/graphs/graph.py"
```

Also, I've changed the "Report Upstream" since here we *are* the upstream.
