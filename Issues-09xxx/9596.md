The number field function `real_embeddings` gives embeddings into finite precision real numbers, hence cannot be used for functions whose outputs are supposed to be proven (like `is_totally_positive`).

Correct the usage of `real_embeddings` and give `real_embeddings` a warning in the documentation string.

```
sage: a = 30122754096401; b = 21300003689580
sage: (a/b)^2 > 2
True
sage: K.<sqrt2> = QuadraticField(2)
sage: (a/b+sqrt2).is_totally_positive()
False
```
Both should be `True`.
