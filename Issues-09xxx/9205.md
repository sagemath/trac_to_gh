At present, we have a discrete log function which claims to work for Z/NZ when this group is cyclic, but it can be wrong when N is not prime, as in this example:

```
sage: Mod(5,9).log(Mod(2, 9))
6
sage: sage: discrete_log(Mod(5, 9), Mod(2, 9))
5
```

The first answer is totally wrong, because Pari's znlog function is intended to be used with a prime modulus and silently returns junk in the non-prime case.

I need to be able to express elements of Z/NZ* in terms of generators in the non-cyclic case anway, so I will fix this in the process.

Here's a patch. It fixes the "log" method so it returns the right answer when the multiplicative group is cyclic, and adds a new method (I called this "generalised log" -- I didn't know what else to call it) which returns a vector of exponents with respect to the generators of the unit group.

... but one of the doctest in sage/functions/log doesn't. Here's a tiny patch that fixes that.
