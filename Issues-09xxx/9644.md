Reported by Dan on [sage-support](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/3694601bc3de1a80):

```
This is an observation about the pre-compiled binaries for Mac OS.

If the (unpacked) sage disk image directory is saved in a folder that has a
space character in its name, for example:

$HOME/Applications/my folder

Then sage will not load properly when the "sage" executable is clicked. The
terminal session begins, but the application doesn't load successfully.

Changing the parent directory name to "my_folder" resolved this issue.

While using space characters in directory names probably isn't all that common
in UNIX or Linux installations, it is more common in Mac OS installations.
Perhaps the installation instructions could be updated to mention this issue? 
```

This actually appears to be a more general problem:

```sh
$ hostname
sage.math.washington.edu
$ pwd
/mnt/usb1/scratch/mpatel/tmp/my sage
$ ./sage
Error setting environment variables by running /mnt/usb1/scratch/mpatel/tmp/my sage/local/bin/sage-env; possibly contact sage-devel (see http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel).

Welcome to IPython. I will try to create a personal configuration directory
where you can customize many aspects of IPython's functionality in:

/ipython
Initializing from configuration /mnt/usb1/scratch/mpatel/tmp/my sage/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/IPython/UserConfig
WARNING: 

There was a problem with the installation:

## Documentation to correct / clarify:

* `$SAGE_ROOT/README.txt` (This file gets into the download directories, too.)

* Sage Installation Guide:

It is well documented that `$SAGE_ROOT` (and therefore `$SAGE_LOCAL` **must not** contain spaces; I only wondered a few times if this is checked/catched anywhere, since almost all scripts (especially `spkg-install` scripts) blindly rely on this.

RELOCATION
----------

You *should* be able to move the sage-x.y.z directory anywhere you
want. If you copy the sage script or make a symbolic link to it, you
should modify the script to reflect this (as instructed at the top of
the script). It is best if the path to Sage does not have any spaces in
it.
...
```

And afair it is (or at least has been at some time) better documented in the Installation Guide.

So I would open two tickets (one could be this with changed title):

* Make sure `$SAGE_ROOT` does not contain spaces, e.g. in `sage-env` (blocker).

* Improve documentation (CAPSLOCK? Add/move remarks to top of files.)

<a id='comment:5'></a>
Ouch, I just realized the scripting "logic" is completely insane:

While `sage-env` is intended to be **sourced** (rather than called), and `sage-sage` does this,

* `sage-sage` redirects stdout and stderr while sourcing `sage-env` to `/dev/null`, though `sage-env` eventually outputs (valuable) error messages
* `sage-sage` tests its "exit status", though it is sourced, not called
* `sage-env` actually **exits** with 1 on error

So even when an error is detected in `sage-env`, the user will never see the error message, but Sage will simply "silently" exit.

Argh...

It is currently "/home/leif/Sage /sage-4.5.2.alpha0-j12".
You must correct this by moving Sage (or renaming some directories) first.

I know there was one bit of code in sage which removed one space, but not multiple ones. i.e. 

```
sed 's/ //' 
```

rather than 

```
sed 's/ //g'
```

I changed the one occurrence I spotted, but there might be others lucking. 

Of course, the best way to solve this is to not have any hacks like this, and just get Sage to build with spaces in paths. If things are quoted properly, this should be possible. 

Perhaps there should be an environment variable that can be used to bypass that hack which removes spaces. Then we could slowly find the packages that have problems and correct them one by one. Once they were all corrected, the hack could be removed and Sage would build on paths with spaces in them.

Attachment [trac_9644-first_aid_for_spaces_in_SAGE_ROOT-scripts_repo.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket9644/trac_9644-first_aid_for_spaces_in_SAGE_ROOT-scripts_repo.patch) by @nexttime created at 2010-07-30 14:36:07

We could require people who update/provide new spkgs to at least check if the upstream supports spaces in path names (I really doubt all will), and to harden the corresponding Sage scripts in that way. But I expect this to be a long lasting process, rather than a goal for any release in the nearer future.

And I have absolutely no idea which "inner" parts of Sage (i.e. Python code) might break on spaces in file or path names.

Of course users that only download and install binaries should somehow get informed, too, e.g. directly on the download page.

And THAT was the point of the original post - that README.txt should probably also mention this issue for downloads, since he downloaded a *binary*.

Although the README.txt (and other scattered pieces of information) are rarely changed/current, I really thought this was a well-known issue, since I came across that in the documentation many times. (I think it once was better placed, s.t. nobody could miss it, though people tend to read READMEs and installation guides - if at all - *after* they run into problems... ;-) )

Yes, that's what I was thinking of, too.

> The error message may also want to say that certain Sage components would fail otherwise? Or would that be too long?


As long as it fits onto a 80x25 screen... Feel free to add a "reviewer patch" or make some suggestion and I'll update the patch. I'm quite sure then this could get into 4.5.2.

Someone volunteering for a revised README?

Harald, ideas for the web page?

I don't know the exact problem, but I'm for adding a check at the "sage" script itself -- ahh, i've just seen that above -- and to the early scripts when starting to build sage.

Although the Makefile shouldn't break the assumption that we're using `bash`; so either `sage-env` should be removed there, or the line should be `bash -c ...`, or `/usr/bin/env bash -c ...`. There are various ways to fix that.

I wonder if `sage-starts` shouldn't use `bash` (instead of `sh`) and itself source `sage-env`; then we could drop `. local/bin/sage-env &&` from `TESTPRELIMS`. (This would IMHO be cleaner.)

The changes look fine. 

The `/bin/sh: [`](../tree/master/}}}) is quite a common error. We should not solve it by redirecting stderr to /dev/null, but removing the word `source` and replacing it with a dot. I suspect there are many instances of this lucking around. The problem is the command does not exist in `/bin/sh` but does in `bash` See below. 

Here my default shell is `bash`, so `source` exists as a built in shell command. 

```
kirkby@t2:64 ~$ source
-bash: source: filename argument required
source: usage: source filename [arguments]
```

Now change my shell to /bin/sh

```
kirkby@t2:64 ~$ sh
$ source
source: not found
$ 
```

I'd prefer to use the more portable `.` (dot) which will achieve the same, but is not a bashism. These should certainly be addressed on another ticket. The fact they  are not producing any known errors, makes me wonder how important it is to source the files in the first place!

Sourcing `sage-env` in the Makefile is only needed to set up `SAGE_ROOT` for `sage-starts`, which calls a Python script (`sage-location`).

The other Sage scripts source `sage-env` themselves.

As said before, best would be to change `sage-starts` (and the Makefile) on another ticket; replacing `source` by `.` could be done at #9960 I think.

An even nicer solution would just "source" `sage-env` from the *Python* script (by invoking a shell that does this and echoes the necessary variables), also removing `. sage-env &&` from the Makefile.


You can hardly touch a piece of Sage without experiencing other things to fix... ;-)
