Here is simple example:

```
sage: h = 3^64;
sage: int(h)==int(SR(h))
FALSE
```
Looking a bit deeper into this, it seems that the first 100 bits are correct, and after that int(SR(h)) is just zeroes. (As a side note, the conversion to ZZ works without a problem.)

Pure Python implements int() of a float as truncating toward zero:

```
>>> int(3.14159)
3
>>> int(-3.14159)
-3
>>> int(2.71828)
2
>>> int(-2.71828)
-2
```
I think in general we've implemented int() on real numbers of various types as truncating toward zero to follow this precedent.
