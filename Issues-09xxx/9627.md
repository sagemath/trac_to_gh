Here is simple example:

```
sage: h = 3^64;
sage: int(h)==int(SR(h))
FALSE
```
Looking a bit deeper into this, it seems that the first 100 bits are correct, and after that int(SR(h)) is just zeroes. (As a side note, the conversion to ZZ works without a problem.)

OTOH,

```
sage: ZZ(log(8)/log(2))
...
TypeError: unable to convert x (=log(8)/log(2)) to an integer
```
but

```

OTOH, `int(sin(2)*100)` is not equal to 90... not an integer anyway... What's the expected meaning of `int(x)`?

Pure Python implements int() of a float as truncating toward zero:

```
>>> int(3.14159)
3
>>> int(-3.14159)
-3
>>> int(2.71828)
2
>>> int(-2.71828)
-2
```
I think in general we've implemented int() on real numbers of various types as truncating toward zero to follow this precedent.
