Here is simple example:

```
sage: h = 3^64;
sage: int(h)==int(SR(h))
FALSE
```
Looking a bit deeper into this, it seems that the first 100 bits are correct, and after that int(SR(h)) is just zeroes. (As a side note, the conversion to ZZ works without a problem.)

OTOH,

TypeError: unable to convert x (=log(8)/log(2)) to an integer

Pure Python implements int() of a float as truncating toward zero:

```
>>> int(3.14159)
3
>>> int(-3.14159)
-3
>>> int(2.71828)
2
>>> int(-2.71828)
-2
```
I think in general we've implemented int() on real numbers of various types as truncating toward zero to follow this precedent.

Something like this may work:

    try:

Note that `floor(log(8)/log(2))` takes about 1s to complete, which means `SR_int(log(8)/log(2))` is waaay slower than `int(log(8)/log(2)`. But this is at the cost of `int(x)` being incorrect when `x` is very close to an integer (cf. `int(SR(10<sup>20-10</sup>-20))`).
