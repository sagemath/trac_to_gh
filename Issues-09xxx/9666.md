When I ran the test suite there were a bunch of failures in

   devel/sage/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_quotient_ring.py

e.g.,

```
File "/mnt/usb1/scratch/wstein/build/sage-4.5.2.rc0/devel/sage/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_quotient_ring.py", line 1141:
    sage: D.selmer_group([K.ideal(2, -a+1), K.ideal(3, a+1), K.ideal(a)], 3)
Expected:
    [2, -a - 1, -a]
Got:
    [2, -a - 1, a]
```

Apologies.  I did not expect the hash to have influence on this, I should have tested better.

I will postpone this to the release after the PARI upgrade, i.e. sage-4.6.1 or something.

The same is fixed correctly in #9400.  So I'm closing this as a dupe of that.
