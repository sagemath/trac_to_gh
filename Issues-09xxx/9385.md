I'm compiling Sage in a fedora 13 Intel Core Duo laptop (1.8 Gb RAM). It normally takes about 6 hours to build previous versions of sage, however, it now seems to enter an infinite loop while building ATLAS (After 28 hours it is still building ATLAS).

Someone in #archlinux said libreadline is segfaulting or something like that and that it was looping.

I'll compile a previous version of Sage and see if that works for now.

In what version of Sage did you find this problem? 

What was your most recent build of Sage that built without this problem?

It happened with sage-4.4.4, my latest succesful compilation was sage-4.4.1. I am under the impression that ATLAS was changed towards a more recent version (a beta) in this latest version of sage. 

http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/f3fa4f8737437d7f/f4a78427d007d3d8?lnk=raot

That is the most obvious explanation to the problem, so, perhaps we should go back to the version of ATLAS used before...

There was a discussion of updating ATLAS, but it has not been changed to any beta version - I looked at doing it, but it is a non-trivial task. 

The changes to the ATLAS package are listed in the file SPKG.txt in the ATLAS package.

Try something like:

```
drkirkby@hawk:~/clean$ cd sage-4.5.alpha0/spkg/standard
drkirkby@hawk:~/clean/sage-4.5.alpha0/spkg/standard$ tar xfj atlas-3.8.3.p12.spkg
drkirkby@hawk:~/clean/sage-4.5.alpha0/spkg/standard$ cat atlas-3.8.3.p12/SPKG.txt
```

Looking further down you will see the ChangeLog section. 

```
## ChangeLog

### atlas-3.8.3.p12 (Jaap Spies, Februari 22th 2010)
 * #8039 For use with the Sun ld with SAGE64="yes" change ldflag -melf_86_64 to -64
 * See also the remarks from David Kirky on atlas-3.8.3.p5

=== atlas-3.8.3.p11 (Peter Jeremy, 2010-01-25)===
 * #7827: Fix atlas-3.8.3.p9 compilation on FreeBSD
 * Minh Van Nguyen: patch spkg-install-script to copy
   patches/SpewMakeInc.c over to src/CONFIG/src/SpewMakeInc.c

### atlas-3.8.3.p10 (David Kirkby, January 5th 2010)
 * replace bitwidth.py which uses 'ctypes' at that is broken 
   on many platforms. 
```

The most recent change, #8039 was in February this year and was merged in sage-4.3.4.alpha0. So the ATLAS .spkg has not been updated since your last successful build on 4.4.1. 

So I would look outside of there for the problem. As to what it might be, the obvious one is the load average on the system is too high, in which case ATLAS will be rebuilt a maximum of 5 times. If that's not the case, then I don't know what it might be. You mentioned readline elsewhere as a possible candidate. That has been updated.

I tried the compilation again, and found the following behaviour:
1.- Several packages are compiled during aproximately 1 hour and a half.
2.- ATLAS starts to compile
3.- About 2 hours later, ATLAS fails to compile with the following message:

Error report error_<ARCH>.tgz has been created in your top-level ATLAS
directory.  Be sure to include this file in any help request.

4.- The terminal prompt does not appear (the process seems to have paused, but not ended). CPU usage descends from nearly full usage to almost none.

5 .- After approximately 20 minutes, return to No 2

I asked a friend who has also installed Fedora 13 in his 32 bit computer, to compile sage as well, and got the same behaviour.

There is currently no Fedora 13 compilation of sage (the fedora 12 version hasn't worked on my computer), so I must guess this must be a fedora 13 - related problem.

I hope this could get fixed soon, if it doesn't I'll have to change my OS.

I don't have a clue what the problem might be, but I do know that the version of ATLAS in Sage has remained unchanged. Of course, each release of Sage many things do get changed, and its hard to know why something built ok but now does not. You could try building the version which you knew worked before, to confirm it is not something changed on your computer.

Those errors are harmless, that just means that ATLAS tried to compile some assembler optimized code that doesn't work on your particular CPU. Atlas will then use a different code path.

Which log do you mean? Is it sage-4.4.4/install.log ? That log will go into an infinite loop. So it is not clear at which point it should be halted. I ran the process only until the first looping. At that point install.log is over 20 Megabytes. Or is it some other "complete log"?

How do I turn on LANG=en_US?

Note this comment by Alex Ghitza on sage-devel. 

http://groups.google.co.uk/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/fba88176344c2814

Alex is able to both build Sage 4.4.4 from scratch, and perform an upgrade on Arch Linux. So if some people are having problems with ATLAS on Arch Linux, it is certainly not all users of that distribution.

Thank you Jaap. 

I've set this to 'worksforme', though a more accurate description would be 'works for some'. I don't believe this can remain a blocker for the next release, when there are positive confirmations it can build on both Fedora 13 and Arch Linux - the two platforms olazo mentioned were causing problems. 

I'm not dismissing the fact there may be a problem, and this may break on some installations, but it can't remain a blocker. 

I've cc'ed the 4.5 release manager (Robert Miller), in case he feels otherwise.

Sadly, I agree. I'll put the log here, it's not that big once compressed (1.3 Megabytes).

This **might** be a clue:

```
It appears you have cpu throttling enabled, which makes timings
unreliable and an ATLAS install nonsensical.  Aborting.
See ATLAS/INSTALL.txt for further information
Ignoring CPU throttling by user override!
```

CPU throttling is whereby the CPU speed reduces when the system load is low. It could confuse ATLAS when it goes into its timing routines. 

I have a program called 'powertop' which shows the states of the CPUs. Since my machine is busy, it is currently running at 3499 MHz, but it can go down as low as 1600 MHz and can climb a bit more, depending on the temperature, how many cores are active etc. 

It may be worth trying to disable CPU throttling on your system. Google should indicate how you might be able to do that.

This same assertion failure appears once on the atlas bugtracker at

Does this mean that I'm unable to build because of hardware limitations (not enough RAM)? But I built just fine in ubuntu.

Also, this ticket is clearly not resolved. I'll reverse that (I hope that's not against the rules).

Some questions for the OP:
* Is your CPU trottled?
* Were other applications open/running at build time?
* Upload your `/home/oscar/sage-4.4.4/spkg/build/atlas-3.8.3.p12/ATLAS-build/error_CoreDuo32SSE3.tar`

I'll set the priority to the default since it seems to be working for most people.

I guess it is, since the install.log says so (see a pervious message fro drkirkby in this ticket)

>   * Were other applications open/running at build time?


Yes, should I try again with no ther applications running?

>   * Upload your `/home/oscar/sage-4.4.4/spkg/build/atlas-3.8.3.p12/ATLAS-build/error_CoreDuo32SSE3.tar`


Done.

Also, thank you very much for helping me out!

Possibly with information like the amount of RAM and swap space, and what other applications were running, we might be able to make a judgment on that. I've regularly built Sage in 2 GB RAM on Solaris, but I'm just using the machine as a server, with no graphical interface running, so I could get away with less than someone with a Gnome or similar running. I've built older (4 month or so) versions of Sage with 1.5 GB on Solaris too.

It is actually against the rules. You should not reopen or close tickets without admin rights. However, in this case, I may have been wrong to close it. I was expecting that "wordsforme" would leave it open. Either way, from a practical point of view, I don't think it makes a lot of difference - we will still try to resolve the ticket. I suspect it should however be closed, but I'm not 100% sure. I will seek clarification on this issue. 

Things I would suggest include 
* Stating the RAM and swap space you have. Google for how to find these out if you are not sure. 
* Disable CPU throttling. 
* If none of those work, download the latest ATLAS beta and try building that. If that fails, then report it to the ATLAS bug tracker. Since this is the latest stable ATLAS, report that to the ATLAS bug tracker too. 
* Add the links to the ATLAS bug tracker to this ticket, so we have a reference of it. 

Maybe others have some more ideas how to solve this.

I've got an Intel Core Duo, and 1.8 Gb of RAM. My Swap is 5 Gb. I was probably running both Firefox and Thunderbird, watching stuff in YouTube... Thinking back that does seem quite CPU-expensive

Almost all modern machines (and 100% of all PCs) share the memory, so you do not have 800 MB/CPU. 

Typing

```
export SAGE_PARALLEL_SPKG_BUILD=yes
export MAKE="make -j 3"
```

will launch 3 threads and build upto 3 .spkg files in parallel. When .spkg files are independant of each other, they can be built in parallel. Other times, only one will be built. So my CPU load changed from about 12.5% (1/8th of the threads being used) to 100% in the instances where 8 can all be built in parallel.

However, building packages in parallel is not 100% reliable yet, so the last thing you want to do is try that. That will just add another thing that can go wrong.

I'm seeing the same thing on Fedora 13 32 bit. Intel i3/4GB RAM

Turned off cpuspeed, disabled SpeedStep in the BIOS and finally booted into single user mode but the problem persisted unchanged.

The following error shows up a few lines before the "error 639 during edge detection":

```
ATL_dupKBmm_b0.c: In function ‘ATL_dpKBmm_b0’:
ATL_dupKBmm_b0.c:26: error: ‘else’ without a previous ‘if’

ATL_dupKBmm_b1.c:31: error: ‘else’ without a previous ‘if’
make[7]: *** [ATL_dupKBmm_b1.o] Error 1

```
Compilation stops here.

The same code builds without problem on Fedora 12.

I have just managed to compile sage in my fedora 13 32 bits computer. I am not completely sure what made the difference. I can see two differences between this and my previous atempts: 

1) I updated the compilers to their latest versions.
2) I was compiling in a partition formated as ext3, this time i used a partition formated as ext4.
3) I compiled as superuser

I did not disable throttling, and I was running gnome (other than that no other resource-consuming aplications were running).

Since I was the only person to have this bug, and it has now been resolved, I advice this ticket to be closed.

Compiling as root is a very dangerous thing to do. I've personally had builds of Sage fail when they try to write to system directories like /usr/lib. I'd rather them fail, than corrupt my system. Sage should not need root privileges to build. 

I'm glad you have solved this. Given most people had no problem, I will close this as invalid.

I've just spent several hours trying to compile sage (compiling on an Atom processor takes some time...) while I stumbled upon the same problem.

Distribution: Fedora 13 (i686)

System: EeePC 1000H / Intel Atom N270

Compiler: gcc-4.4.4-10.fc13

RAM: 1GB (completely used during the compilation of ATLAS)

Swap: 2GB (nearly unused)

What I've tried after reading all comments here:

* adding more swap
* no X, single user
* disabling cpu throttling
* closing all other services and programs

Unfortunately without any success. But then I've read about the `SAGE_ATLAS_LIB` environment variable in the [docs](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/installation/source.html#environment-variables). So here is a simple workaround for F13:

**Workaround:**

```
sudo yum install atlas atlas-devel
sudo mkdir /opt/atlas/
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/atlas /opt/atlas/lib
sudo mkdir /opt/atlas/include
sudo ln -s /usr/include/atlas /opt/atlas/include/atlas
export SAGE_ATLAS_LIB=/opt/atlas
make
```

Regards,

Christoph

Thank you. I must admit, I'm a bit concerned at this bug. I've seen it myself on Debian in virtual machines too. Just installing another version of ATLAS is obviously fine for you, but in general it is not good. 

If you still have the log, can I suggest you open another ticket, attach the file spkg/logs/atlas$verison.log and leave it open as a bug, as there does appear to be a problem here.

I'm trying to build sage on Fedora 16 but I'm also ending in an infinite ATLAS build loop.
Sage 4.7 builds fine in Fedora 15 on my AMD desktop but on my Intel notebook sage 4.7 and sage 4.7.1
are hanging at the ATLAS build.

Just looking at the install.log for example ATLAS was trying over 600 times to compile fc.c

```
[chris@thinkpad sage-4.7.1]$ cat install.log | grep -c "sage-4.7.1/spkg/build/atlas-3.8.3.p16/ATLAS-build/../src//tune/blas/gemm/fc.c"
648
```
Attatched:

```
install.log.lzma
cat /proc/meminfo >proc_meminfo
cat /proc/cpuinfo >proc_cpuinfo
```
Here you can see that there are some crashes in "ATLAS-build/tune/blas/":

```
cat /var/log/messages |grep abrt |grep "Aug 26 18" >abrt.log
```
I've also tried disabling cpu throttling with no effect.

```
sudo cpupower frequency-set -g performance
```
And the workaround from comment 40:

```
$ sudo yum install atlas atlas-devel
$ rpm -q atlas
atlas-3.8.4-1.fc16.x86_64
$ sudo mkdir /opt/atlas/
$ #sudo ln -s /usr/lib/atlas /opt/atlas/lib
$ sudo ln -s /usr/lib64/atlas /opt/atlas/lib
$ sudo mkdir /opt/atlas/include
$ sudo ln -s /usr/include/atlas /opt/atlas/include/atlas
$ export SAGE_ATLAS_LIB=/opt/atlas
$ export MAKE="make -j6"
$ make
```

But make will fail (see install_with_system_atlas.tar.lzma) because /opt/atlas/lib
only contains shared objects and no static library files.

"Unable to find one of liblapack.a, libcblas.a, libatlas.a or libf77blas.a
in the directory /opt/atlas/lib"

```
$ ls /opt/atlas/lib
libatlas.so      libcblas.so      libclapack.so      libf77blas.so      liblapack.so      libptcblas.so      libptf77blas.so
libatlas.so.3    libcblas.so.3    libclapack.so.3    libf77blas.so.3    liblapack.so.3    libptcblas.so.3    libptf77blas.so.3
libatlas.so.3.0  libcblas.so.3.0  libclapack.so.3.0  libf77blas.so.3.0  liblapack.so.3.0  libptcblas.so.3.0  libptf77blas.so.3.0
```

What should I do next? If you need more information to fix this bug please ask.
