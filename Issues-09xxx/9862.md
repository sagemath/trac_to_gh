This is a reimplementation of the `IntervalGraph()` constructor to allow repeated intervals in the list of intervals. The input is a list of intervals. The output is a graph whose vertices are numbered 0 through n-1 (where n is the length of the list). Vertices u and v are adjacent iff the u'th and v'th intervals in the input list intersect. The intervals associated with these vertices are saved with the graph using `set_vertex` and can be retrieved later using `get_vertex` or `get_vertices`.

Two short modifications in the docstring... One to use the ".. NOTE" environment, and another one to propagate the warnings to RandomInterval `:-)`

As usual, positive review to your patch ! It's left to you to judge mine `:-)`
