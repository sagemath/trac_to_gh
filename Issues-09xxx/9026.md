```
The following is list of the issues that are currently preventing Sage build 64-bit on either

* OpenSolaris (aka Solaris 11) on Intel/AMD x64. (e.g. 'disk')
* Solaris 10 on Intel/AMD (e.g. 'fulva')
* Solaris 10 on SPARC (e.g. 't2')

The list can be added as new problems are found, making what William calls a 'metaticket' 

Please put 
* "bug" if one knows, or might reasonable expect, it to cause a problem on a particular platform.
* "OK" if one knows the problem does not exist on that platform, or one reasonably expect it will not be an issue. 
* "unknown" if one can not determine if it will be an issue. 

Although OpenSolaris can run on the SPARC platform, very few people run it, so there is little to be gained by tracking issues on that platform. (David Kirkby does not have OpenSolaris installed on any of his SPARC systems)

According to the "search_doc" function, the main occurrences of the string "Solaris" are in the file "devel/sage/doc/en/installation/source.rst", so that's the only part of the docs that we need to fix.  The file SAGE_ROOT/README.txt says that Solaris on sparc is officially supported, but not Solaris on x86_64.  I'm guessing that this is still accurate.  There are probably assorted wiki pages about supported platforms, too. In any case, it would be good to maintain a single official list of supported platforms, instead of having conflicting information in different locations.

Yes, that is still true.

I agree, though that is a different issue to this ticket, which is for build problems on 64-bit Solaris. The supported platforms issue needs resolving for Solaris, as it does for Linux, OS X and Windows. I created  #9487 to cover this.

<a id='comment:28'></a>John, 
I see you updated the table to include #9358. Note however note the comments above.

Please put
* "yes" if the trac ticket is known, or one might reasonably expect it to cause a problem on a particular platform.
* "no" if one knows the problem does not exist on that platform, or one reasonably expect it will not be an issue.
* "unknown" if one can not determine if it will be an issue. 

So the znpoly issue should have a "yes" in the first column. I've also tried to keep them in order of trac number, though that's not a big deal. 

Perhaps changing "yes" -> Bug and No->OK might be sensible, as I can see this could be confusing. That would be trivial to change with a sed script. What do you think of that, or can you think of a better, less confusing solution? 

Dave
