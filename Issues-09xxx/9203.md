Adding a primitive for plot ellipses that wraps the existing patch of matplotlib.

This is approximately the same stuff as the patch #9076 for plotting arcs (of circle and ellipse).

This looks nice overall too, but again some things needed for best results.

* Class def examples for reference guide

* 'circle' still shows up a few times
 
* This `_repr_` method is better than the arc one!

* plot3d should open ticket or test `NotImplementedError`

* I like that options are given explicitly in arc(), as well as test of `NotImplementedError`

I'll try to work through the details of the `get_min_max_data` and test thoroughly on this and #9076 as soon as these things are addressed, because in general they're both good wraps and add much-needed functionality.  Good work!

Thank you for this careful review

Done, if you mean examples in the docstring of the class Ellipse

> * 'circle' still shows up a few times

No more (I hope)

> * plot3d should open ticket or test `NotImplementedError`

I will. But as I really do not like the one it is implemented for circle for many different reasons I don't know how general should be the corresponding ticket...

> * I like that options are given explicitly in arc(), as well as test of `NotImplementedError`

Now there is. And I add a link from the sage.plot.plot

> I'll try to work through the details of the `get_min_max_data` and test thoroughly on this and #9076 as soon as these things are addressed, because in general they're both good wraps and add much-needed functionality.

The get_min_max_data for ellipse is just obtained by computing corresponding critical points. This is not the good way for arc but I will make an effort for it (as it is not too much complicate).
