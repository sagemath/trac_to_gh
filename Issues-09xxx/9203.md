Adding a primitive for plot ellipses that wraps the existing patch of matplotlib.

This is approximately the same stuff as the patch #9076 for plotting arcs (of circle and ellipse).

**CC:**  @kcrisman @jasongrout

**Keywords:** plot, geometry, ellipse

**Resolution:** fixed

**Author:** Vincent Delecroix

**Reviewer:** Karl-Dieter Crisman

**Merged:** sage-4.6.alpha1

This looks nice overall too, but again some things needed for best results.

* Class def examples for reference guide

* 'circle' still shows up a few times
 
* This `_repr_` method is better than the arc one!

* plot3d should open ticket or test `NotImplementedError`

* I like that options are given explicitly in arc(), as well as test of `NotImplementedError`

I'll try to work through the details of the `get_min_max_data` and test thoroughly on this and #9076 as soon as these things are addressed, because in general they're both good wraps and add much-needed functionality.  Good work!

Thank you for this careful review

> * Class def examples for reference guide


Done, if you mean examples in the docstring of the class Ellipse

> * 'circle' still shows up a few times


No more (I hope)

> * plot3d should open ticket or test `NotImplementedError`


I will. But as I really do not like the one it is implemented for circle for many different reasons I don't know how general should be the corresponding ticket...

> * I like that options are given explicitly in arc(), as well as test of `NotImplementedError`


Now there is. And I add a link from the sage.plot.plot

> I'll try to work through the details of the `get_min_max_data` and test thoroughly on this and #9076 as soon as these things are addressed, because in general they're both good wraps and add much-needed functionality.


The get_min_max_data for ellipse is just obtained by computing corresponding critical points. This is not the good way for arc but I will make an effort for it (as it is not too much complicate).

The following patch is simply a hand-edited version to include a better commit message - it was not actually committed.

Thanks for updating the patch.

Since the 4.5.3 series is now in feature freeze --- it's just open to blocker problems such as build errors, doctest fixes, etc. --- and we'll merge the PARI upgrade into 4.6.alpha0, it's very likely that merging this ticket and #9076 will have to wait until 4.6.alpha1, at least.
