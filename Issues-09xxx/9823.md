The patch solves the problem by passing to desolve_laplace. Both desoove_laplace and desolve_system use function desolve from Maxima and perhaps bouth could be merged into one function. Perhaps when solving #9824 ?

Also removes unnecessary spawned Maxima processes.

Install after the patch for #9835.

Updated the patch - removed plotting picture from testing, since Sage complains

Does this really depend on 9835? It seemed to apply and test fine for me without it.

I have tested this without 9835 and it passes fine. Also, the patch is very simple and does as it says and also adds a doctest illustrating the new fix.

Positive review from me, without 9835. I am currently also testing it with 9835.
