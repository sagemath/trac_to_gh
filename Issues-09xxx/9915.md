NZMATH uses a subtype of Python's "long" for its bignum type.  This works fine with plain mpmath, but when mpmath runs under Sage it uses Cython code that's incompatible with NZMATH.  This patch fixes mpmath-under-sage to fix some incompatibilities with NZMATH.  (It also modifies ZZ to allow initialization from a subclass of int/long/float.)

Any additional (`--[only-]optional[=...]`) tests to run with NZMATH installed?

Patch looks reasonable, and doesn't cause additional doctest failures when running `ptestlong` on (not yet released) Sage 4.6.alpha1 (with NZMATH 1.0.0 installed; Ubuntu 10.04 x86_64).

Positive review so far, still looking for optional NZMATH doctests... ;-)

Replying to [@nexttime](#comment%3A3):

Couldn't find any; also, NZMATH doesn't have an `spkg-check` file.

Is

```
sage: from nzmath import *
```
supposed to work? (Gives deprecation warnings and an attribute error.)

But the following works:

```
sage: import nzmath.rational
sage: r = nzmath.rational.Rational(113r, 355r)
sage: print r
113/355
sage: 
```
That's of course not much of a test. ;-)
