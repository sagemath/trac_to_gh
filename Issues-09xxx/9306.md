Consider the following:

```
sage: q=2^200/3^50
sage: q.floor()
2238393297946874000179418290327143433
sage: q.ceil()
2238393297946874000179418290327143434
sage: q.round()
2238393297946874000179418290327143433
```
This is fine so far. However:

```
sage: floor(q)
2238393297946874000179418290327143433
sage: ceil(q)
2238393297946874000179418290327143434
sage: round(q)
2.23839329795e+36
```
We would expect `round(q)` to behave like `q.round()`.
