A constellation is a combinatorial description (via elements of the symmetric group) of graphs embedded in surfaces (also called G-map). This ticket aims to implement a basic class for it with:
* fast data type
* normal form and isomorphism test
* action of the braid group
* enumeration/generation with constraints

I just had a quick look at the code. There are many procedures without documentation and tests. This should be corrected. 

Moreover, near the beginning of the patch, an example is given

```
sage: c = Constellation(['(0,1)', '(0,2)', None])
```
and the syntax is rather unclear. What is the meaning of none ? Why do we need quotes around permutations ?

<a id='comment:4'>Comment 4:</a>
Using the latest sage-combinat queue, the doctest coverage is clearly bad :

```
SCORE constellation.py: 25% (18 of 70)
```

And some tests are failing :

```
2 items had failures:
   1 of   5 in __main__.example_0
   2 of   5 in __main__.example_14
***Test Failed*** 3 failures.
```

Here is a patch with more documentation, but there is still lacking a lot of tests.

I have also corrected the previously failing tests, but now some of the new tests are failing, because the procedures last() and first() do not work !

Thanks working on doctests !

I would like to split the file in two parts. More precisely, I intend to move the first part (the little functions on permutations) in a file like sage.misc.permutations. What do you think ? Do I have the green light to fold your patch with mine and do the splitting ?

Best,
Vincent

I guess that it makes sense to move the remaining functions from `sage.misc.permutation` inside `constellation.py`.

Since you are now using permutations, I would actually allow any domain. In other words, add a fixed symmetric group attribute to `Constellations`.

When you check matching with the oeis sequence 220754, you can also do that in Sage

```
sage: seq = oeis('A220754')
sage: seq
A220754: Number of ordered triples (a,b,c) of elements of the symmetric group S_n such that the triple a,b,c generates a transitive group.
sage: seq.first_terms()
(1,
 7,
 194,
 12858,
 1647384,
 361351560,
 125116670160,
 64439768489040,
 47159227114392960,
 47285264408385951360,
 63057420721939066617600,
 109118766834521171299756800,
 239996135160204867851157273600,
 659114500480471292127627441484800)
```

The fact that the associated permutation group is transitive is equivalent to the "connectedness". You should either use one or the other.
