Looks good (and useful).  Patch applies fine to 4.4.3.  I tested all sage/rings and had one failure (in a new doctest, on 64-bit ubuntu):

```
File "/storage/jec/sage-4.4.3/devel/sage-tests/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_element.pyx", line 1262:
    sage: (9 * f^10 * g^4).sqrt() == 3 * f^5 * g^2
Expected:
    True
Got:
    False
```
I have never been happy about doctests using random elements, however deterministic they are supposed to be.

I would have tested for self==0 at the start of the sqrt function, but that case will be caught quickly anyway, so no problem.

I have been working on a patch to add both all= and extend= parameters to the sqrt function for AA and QQbar, having found how awkward it is when the parameters are not uniform across types.  Would it be worth adding an extend= parameter here, even if a NotImplementedError is raised when it is needed (i.e. for sqrt of a non-square when extend=True)?

So: needs work because of the doctest failure;  up to you whether to do the extend= thing.

is_square and sqrt can be done generally for fraction fields, given the corresponding functions for the base ring:

```
is_square (a / b) = is_square (a * b)
sqrt (a / b) = sqrt (a * b) / b
```

Looks good. No time for a complete review right now, but here are some remarks:

* Check spelling of your documentation, you probably don't mean "wether" (=castrated sheep), but "whether" (spell checker doesn't help that much here). "Requiered" has one "e" too much.

* Illustrate is_square(root = True) for the user by providing a square example and a non-square example.

* The internal variable name ``is_sqrt`` is confusing, remove the "t".

* You write "This code is quite general, it could even be implemented for all integral domains as soon as they have the is_square(root=True) option", don't you mean "This code is quite general, it works for all integral domains that have the is_square(root = True) option"?

* I think sqrt(self, extend = True, all = False, name=None ) should have tests of all combinations of options and squareness, i.e: sq/non-sq, extend True/False, all True/False = 2*2*2 = at least 8 examples. The extend=True for a non-square should also have examples with name=None and name=something.

* Perhaps include examples for more base fields?

* consider adding a few more spaces for readability thougout, e.g. around "="

* "if root==True:", why not write "if root:"?

The "This code is quite general" comment did what it had to do. I put it there in the hope that someone would come with a suggestion like you did. I had the feeling that the dubble code could be removed in a nice and general way, but I didn't know how. So by what you say I should just move the code to a more general class and then it will also work for fraction fields and polynomial rings (and possibly even more rings). What would be this more general class and where to find it?

sage/rings/ring_element.py has only one line of code:

```

from sage.structure.element import !RingElement, is_RingElement

```

So should I add it to the RingElement class thats imported from sage.structure.element?

Catching a specific TypeError isn't possible apparently.

```

try:

    raise !TypeError("sqrt() got an unexpected keyword argument 'root'")

except !TypeError("sqrt() got an unexpected keyword argument 'root'"):

    print "lol"

```

gives as output

```

|| {{{

<a id='comment:21'>Comment 21:</a>
On line 1903 you check if the message is "is_square() got an unexpected keyword argument 'root'", but you should also check for "is_square() takes no keyword arguments", which happens for 5.sqrt(root = True). This behaviour should have a good doctest.

After catching a ValueError, line 1904 says:

raise NotImplementedError("Please implement is_square with option 'root = True' for %s" % type(self))

The ValueError may have been raised by another object than self. For example, if self has an is_square(root = True), but calls b.is_square(root = root) of another object b. In that case, this message is misleading: it says that self.is_square(root = True) should be implemented, while it is already well implemented and it is in fact b.is_square(root = True) that should be implemented. You can replace the message by the following:

raise NotImplementedError("Please implement sqrt() for objects of type %s" % type(self))

Can you get examples where these errors are raised and add them to the doctests?

Alternatively, you can either

* make sure "is_square" exists for CommutativeRingElement and "is_square" has a keyword argument "root" for every subclass of CommutativeRingElement (you'll be writing NotImplementedError a lot :) and should check for tickets that implement the root = True behaviour). This seems to be a lot more stable than the current approach.

* or bring back the double-code version with the same sqrt() function in two distinct classes.

<a id='comment:22'>Comment 22:</a>
Are you sure you did a complete doctest of sage before submitting the patch?

```
sage: QuadraticField(2, 'a')
NotImplementedError: Please implement is_square with option 'root = True' for <type 'sage.rings.real_lazy.LazyWrapper'>
```
The problem is in RLF(2).sqrt()

```
sage: RLF(2).sqrt()
NotImplementedError: Please implement is_square with option 'root = True' for <type 'sage.rings.real_lazy.LazyWrapper'>
```

RLF(2) is a LazyWrapper, which doesn't have a sqrt attribute, but simulates one via `__getattr__` (line 631 of sage/rings/real_lazy.pyx). But LazyWrapper extends (via some other classes) CommutativeRingElement, so that now it does have an attribute sqrt (your sqrt function), which means the `__getattr__` of LazyWrapper doesn't get a chance. Your sqrt function then complains about the non-existence of is_square with root = 'True'.

You can probably fix this by making a sqrt function for LazyWrapper that calls LazyNamedUnop(self._parent, self, 'sqrt'). Or you can follow your own advice: "implement is_square with option 'root = True' for ....". Maybe there is a better way, you can also ask one of the mailing lists. Alternatively, you can always go back to your double code.

Anyway, every time before submitting a patch, do everything that a reviewer would do, including a full doctest of all of Sage:
[http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/walk_through.html#reviewing-a-patch](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/walk_through.html#reviewing-a-patch)
On a multi-core machine, you can speed up the doctest by using
`./sage -tp 4 -long devel/sage-main/`
where 4 is replaced by the number of cores you are willing to use.

Indeed, it should use `root=root` instead of `root=True`

Hi Robert,

I can answer this question. This was [a discussion on sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/441948aa73d1c49f). 4 options were discussed for dealing with these unitary operators for lazy numbers.

A) leaving them as they were

B) hard-coding them (as Maarten just did)

C) "fixing LazyNamedUnop to preserve documentation"

D) "populating these methods at class creation time
(rather than attribute lookup time, perhaps dynamically creating a
docstring for them)"

Option A was discarded: it lacks tab completion, and (as we saw in this ticket) leads to a big mess and a lot of confusion when a base class such as RingElement gets a default implementation for one of these unitary operators.

Options C and D were suggested by you, but you seemed to be the only one in the discussion who knew how to do them. Maarten said he was interested in them, and then nothing happened for months.

So I guess that in the end Maarten implemented the only remaining option, which leads to stable, transparent, understandable code that is unfortunately a bit long.

I think the extra time that Sage developers will need when extending or changing Maarten's long list of similar methods is not too bad if you compare it to the time that Sage developers will need when trying to understand more complicated code and having to debug it if something unforeseen happens. But that's just my opinion.

+1 from me for the way Maarten implemented it.

>

Are there general guidelines for this? I can imagine `_parent` to be faster, but `parent()` to be more stable in case creative implementations are in base classes.
