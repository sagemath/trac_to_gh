<div id="comment:0"></div>

For polynomial ring homomorphisms, this ticket implements the methods

- `inverse_image` (of both ideals and individual elements)
- `kernel`
- `is_injective`
- `_graph_ideal`

(This also works for homomorphisms of polynomial quotient rings, number fields and Galois fields.)

---

The implementation is based on the following:

Given a homomorphism `f: K[x] -> K[y]` of (multivariate) polynomial rings that respects the `K`-algebra structure, we can find preimages of `y` by computing normal forms modulo the graph ideal `(x-f(x))` in `K[y,x]` with respect to an elimination order. More generally, this works for morphisms of quotient rings `K[x]/I -> K[y]/J`, which allows to handle many types of ring homomorphisms in Sage.

References: e.g. [BW1993] Propositions 6.44, 7.71; or [Decker-Schreyer](https://www.math.uni-sb.de/ag/schreyer/images/PDFs/teaching/ws1617ag/book.pdf), Proposition 2.5.12 and Exercise 2.5.13.

See also #29723 (inverses of ring homomorphisms) and related posts on the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-support/aJn0T0jIfwU) and at [Ask-Sagemath](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/51336/implicitization-by-symmetric-polynomials/).

---

Example:

```
sage: R.<s,t> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: S.<x,y,z,w> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: f = S.hom([s^4, s^3*t, s*t^3, t^4],R)
sage: f.inverse_image(R.ideal(0))
Ideal (y*z - x*w, z^3 - y*w^2, x*z^2 - y^2*w, y^3 - x^2*z) of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y, z, w over Rational Field
sage: f.inverse_image(s^3*t^4*(s+t))
x*w + y*w
```

---

Note that the inverse image of ideals (but not of elements) could also be computed using Singular as follows:

```
sage: singular.eval('''
....:         ring R=0,(s,t),dp;
....:         ring S=0,(x,y,z,w),dp;
....:         setring R;
....:         map f=S,ideal(s^4,s^3*t,s*t^3,t^4);
....:         setring S;
....:         ideal ker=kernel(R,f)
....:       ''');
sage: singular.get('ker')
'yz-xw,\nz3-yw2,\nxz2-y2w,\ny3-x2z'
sage: print(_)
yz-xw,
z3-yw2,
xz2-y2w,
y3-x2z
```

It would probably be good to wrap the Singular functions `kernel` and `preimage`, yes. I have not compared it in terms of speed yet, mainly because I thought that I needed to implement the graph ideal in Sage anyway in order to compute inverses of elements. However, I have just noticed that the Singular function [algebra_containment](https://www.singular.uni-kl.de/Manual/4-1-3/sing_1215.htm#SEC1296) can be used for that, which I had overlooked before. I will try to figure out how to call it from Sage and then report back.

Possibly this means that this branch can be refactored such that it only wraps Singular functions, instead of constructing the graph ideal in Sage, unless we want to keep it for more control over the Gröbner basis computations.

Here is Singular code for the example from the description:

```
> LIB "algebra.lib";
> ring S = 0, (s,t), dp;
> ideal A = ideal(s^4, s^3*t, s*t^3, t^4);
> poly p = s^3*t^4*(s+t);
> list L = algebra_containment(p, A, 1);
> L[1];
1
> def T = L[2]; setring T; check;
y(1)*y(4)+y(2)*y(4)

We will probably want to have both so we can have it for both generic polynomials (over more exotic base fields (integral domains?)) and specialized code for those implemented using Singular (and less back-and-forth between Singular and Sage).

Implementing this via the libsingular interface is a lot more complicated than I anticipated. It is not currently possible to use Sage's `singular_function` with the Singular type `qring`, and quotient rings in Sage are not even backed by `qring`s in Singular. This means it is not currently possible to use the Singular function `algebra_containment` with quotient rings via libsingular, but only with polynomial rings.
