As the subject says. The latest version also fixes the issue with ARC2 reported at http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/33674/info. Currently, the PyCrypto spkg maintains patches for this issue. Upgrading to the latest upstream version would mean we no longer need to maintain those patches in the spkg itself.

**Apply:**

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mvngu/spkg/standard/pycrypto/pycrypto-2.1.0.spkg

Changes in this upgraded spkg include:

* Upgrade to PyCrypto 2.1.0.
* The bug at http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/33674/info is fixed in PyCrypto 2.1.0, so remove patches/ARC2.c and patches/ARC2.c.patch.
* Flesh out and update the file SPKG.txt.
* Add spkg-check to run the test suite of PyCrypto.
* Add a check to spkg-install to check that PyCrypto installs fine.

Make sure to update #9281 when spkg-check runs the test suite fine.

I just tested it on two systems:

* OpenSolaris 2009.06 on a 3.33 GHz Intel W3580 Xeon. 64-bit build. All tests in `spkg-check` pass. Since Sage crashes immediately on startup, I can't comment on doctests.

I got it running for the first time yesterday, so needless to say, it is far from perfect). 

`hg status`

shows no problems, so positive review.
