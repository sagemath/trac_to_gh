Implementation of two conformal models of hyperbolic geometry (half plane, disc) and actions of their isometry groups.

The actual file is almost complete for working with the hyperbolic plane as the following will plot a hyperbolic triangle

```
sage: HH
Hyperbolic half plane
sage: HH(0)
Boundary point 0
sage: p = HH.polygon([CC(0), CC(1), CC(2,2)])
sage: p.plot(face_color='red').show(aspect_ratio=1)
```
There are more examples in the file.

Are you planning on finishing this?  It would be very good to have an upper half plane implementation.  

There are a few things that need to be improved though.  Accessing attributes directly (e.g. with spam._value) is not good.  Please use accessor methods instead (i.e. a method named value() that returns _value); this improves the separation of interface and implementation.

Near the real line, the hyperbolic distance becomes become HUGE compared to the Euclidean distance.  Representing a point as a complex number thus leads to numeric instability.  It is therefore better to implement a point by a pair of a matrix ((a,b),(c,d)) and a complex number z (thus representing (az+b)/(cz+d)).

Yes. But if you have time and motivation, go on. But there are problems (see below)

Can be done.

It is therefore better to implement a point by a pair of a matrix ((a,b),(c,d)) and a complex number z (thus representing (az+b)/(cz+d)).


I agree on the fact that near the real line it is unstable but disagree on the fact that we need a 5 dimensional object (an element of SL(2,R) and a complex number) to record a 2 dimensional object (a point in the half plane). The best option would be to store only the SL(2,R) matrix m such that the point is the image by z of the point i. Two matrices give the same point iff they are congruent modulo SO(2).

Problems

---

1) The main problem with that project is about of action by matrices. It would be natural that matrices act on the upper half plane. But there are many instances
* element of ArithmeticSubgroup (SL(2,Z)) which is implemented
* element of groups SL(2,R) or GL(2,R) or ...
* a matrix with real coefficient
* ...
I had trouble with the coercion system in order to be able to use any of the type above.

2) In the actual implementation, the geodesics that pass to infinity in the half plane model have an arbitrary maximum height. I did not find a good way to draw them depending on what is asked in the final .show(). In the same veine, a circle with radius 1 very near the boundary should not be drawn as it is less than one pixel...

Okay.  Another possibility is to have the matrix ((a, b), (c, d)) in SL_2(ZZ) and the complex number z in the standard fundamental domain for this group.  Or use both representations (and allow oneself to convert between them).

I simply uploaded all current files, because I messed up my HG status.

I couldn't fix the problem with conversion into CC, which is now #12216. I replaced it by the method toCC.

I haven't checked whether triangles work, but I am exhausted. Plotting polygons works and it should be easy to fill in the tests, that are all stubs for the moment.

I just notice that it is yet possible to draw fundamental domain for congruence subgroups using Farey symbols (#11709, integrated since sage-5.0).

Hi Greg,

You should either post your code here or provide a link. If your code does work, we will definitely use it !

Note that several things should be merged
* the different code in that ticket
* fundamental domain of FareySymbol
* your code

Best,
Vincent

idem.

Two points:

- an important feature that you seem to avoid is the unit tangent bundle of the hyperbolic plane which is isomorphic to PSL(2,R). One great thing would be to have another object `TangentVector` (with a matrix as data). The action of PSL(2,R) on the unit tangent bundle is then just matrix multiplication. 
- your example worksheet should definitely be a thematic tutorial for the Sage documentation

I suggest that we open two new tickets for those features.

Thanks again for your work on this. I am starting the review and will be back with more technical remarks shortly.

Thanks, I'll look into both of these soon.  I have some code for working in Minkowski (2,1) space that I want to use to implement the hyperboloid model in the Lie algebra sl(2,R) since that's what I use in my own research.

Hi Greg,

There are many nice features in the patch but I did not start to play with. You should start by a big clean:

1) there should be no trailing whitespace

2) the organization of each file should be a header which consists of a string with authors the copyright statement and then the code. There should not be several headers and copyright statements.

3) all methods and functions should be commented and doctested. Running `sage -coverage` gives

```
SCORE hyperbolic_object.py: 10.0% (1 of 10)

Missing documentation:
     * line 40: def to_model(self, model)
     * line 49: def to_UHP(self)
     * line 52: def uhp_representation(self)
     * line 55: def model_representation(self)
     * line 58: def representation_in_model(self, model=None)
     * line 96: def to_model(self, model, **options)
     * line 108: def graphics_options(self)

Missing doctests:
     * line 33: def __init__(self, args, **graphics_options)
     * line 88: def __init__(self, args, **graphics_options)
```

4) the files should be properly included in the sage documentation

Now, more serious issues

5) the objects from your module must be lazy imported and not imported in the global namespace (in order to not slow down sage startup)

6) the method `show` should not return a graphics object but should rather shows it! You could rename it `plot`.

7) I agree that it is misleading but `CC` in Sage is not the set of complex number! In particular the test `x in CC` does not answer to the question "does my object `x` modelizes some complex number ?". Precisely `CC` is the set of floating point complex number with 53 bits of precision. But is it on purpose that you want `x in CC` as coordinates for a point in the upper half plane ?

8) The string representation "Hyperbolic point whose representation in the Upper Half Plane is +Infinity" is definitely too long! Why not "Point in HH +Infinity".

And finally a design question (which perhaps should be thought of first)

9) I think that the fact of being conformal or bounded etc is not a property of a HyperbolicObject but rather a property of the underlying model. You decided to not design a class for each model, was it on purpose? Such a class may contain all these property. As you see, in my initial patch, it was possible to write

```
sage: HH
Hyperbolic plane
sage: HH(0)
Boundary point 0
```
I would prefer to have a dedicated class for each model and be able to construct point/geodesic/polygons from the class (via for example ``HH.point(data)``, ``HH.geodesic(data)``, etc). You may also move the `random_element` methods and the various conversions between the models into this parent class.

    "body": "<a id='comment:26'></a>\nHi Vincent,\n\nI've addressed issues 1-4, and I was hoping you wouldn't mind giving me some guidance about how to handle the remaining issues.  Specifically, I have the following questions:\n\n1) Should I post a patch for the fixes of 1-4?  Or should I wait until I fix the remaining issues?  More generally, should I err on the side of posting more patches (so more people can help) or posting only ones that seem more significant?\n\n2) I like the structure of your code, and I aim to emulate it.

Hi Vincent,

I've addressed issues 1-4, and I was hoping you wouldn't mind giving me some guidance about how to handle the remaining issues.  Specifically, I have the following questions:

1) Should I post a patch for the fixes of 1-4?  Or should I wait until I fix the remaining issues?  More generally, should I err on the side of posting more patches (so more people can help) or posting only ones that seem more significant?

2) I like the structure of your code, and I aim to emulate it.  Does it make sense for me to combine your class structure with the features in mine and post it in skeletal form before fixing all of the functions?  For example, I could post a class diagram, or just an outline of the modules with the guts removed. Or is this step likely to be more work with little payoff?  I would ideally like the structure to be as democratically decided as possible.

3) I find your usage of HyperbolicPlane for the upper half plane to be confusing since the HyperbolicDisc is also topologically a plane.  I'm used to referring to both as the hyperbolic plane, and I typically differentiate them by specifying which model of the plane.  I have been using the abbreviations UHP, PD, KM, and HM which were just decided by fiat to be short and convenient.  Is there anything you dislike about this approach to naming?  I worry that HyperbolicUHP is too cryptic, but HyperbolicUpperHalfPlane is too long.

I like better UHP, PD, KM and HM but I think they should not be imported in the standard namespace as such (because it is not clear how the user may find them). What about something like:

```
sage: hyperbolic_geometry.upper_half_plane()
The upper half plane
sage: hyperbolic_geometry.UHP
The upper half plane
etc
```
That way, we may use tab completion. But perhaps, "hyperbolic_geometry" is a bit too long. If somebody want it in the global namespace it is still possible to do

```
sage: from sage.XXX.hyperbolic_geometry import *
sage: UHP
The upper half plane
```

I just attached a new version.  This one allows things like UHP.point(0) or KM.point((1/2, 1/2)), and similarly UHP.geodesic([start, finish]), and UHP.isometry(some_matrix).  

The class structure is somewhat complicated, but it's designed to make it easy to implement new models of 2D and 3D geometry.  Here's how it works:
* The hyperbolic_model module contains data about each individual model, such as its name, the name of its isometry group, and dictionaries of maps to convert points and isometries to other models and so on.
* the hyperbolic_point, hyperbolic_bdry_point, hyperbolic_geodesic, and hyperbolic_isometry modules all do what they sound like.  The methods in these modules are meant to be as general and abstract as possible.  Ideally they should barely have to be touched to implement new models of hyperbolic space.
* hyperbolic_methods implements any methods that involve doing computations with actual numbers.  These methods have their own module because they are more likely to change if it turns out some computation is not efficient.  Also any model of hyperbolic geometry can choose to do computations in another model and convert the results.  In the current patch, every model does its computations in the upper half plane and then converts back to the desired model.  
* hyperbolic_factory and model_factory are just factory patterns that make the whole abstract structure work.
* finally, hyperbolic_interface is the module that contains the objects UHP, HM, KM, and PD that allow operations like UHP.point(1 + I).  These are just more pleasant user interfaces to methods in other classes.

To implement another 2D model, one mainly has to put the model information in hyperbolic_model and write down maps to all of the other models.  To implement a 3D model, one also has to implement hyperbolic_methods for at least one model (say the upper half space model).  In both cases there is a tiny amount of book keeping that must also be done in updating the factory and other modules with one or two lines of code.

I uploaded a new patch.  It fixes some docbuild errors that I didn't catch before.  I am marking it as needs_review because I'd like to get some feedback on it.

There are several things I'd like to add, including
* support for polygons, circles, and horocycles
* the ability to return the SageManifolds manifold associated with each model
* some models of hyperbolic 3 space
But I'd like each of these to have their own bug report/feature request so before I do work on them I'd like to get the current patch reviewed.

If it's easier for reviewers, I can try to submit a bare-bones patch (maybe with just the upper half plane model) to reduce the number of lines of code and then add everything else in incremental patches.

I will have to think more about the first one. The second should be done at some point unless there is a very good argument otherwise IMO.

I'm glad to see other people working on this ticket!  I tried to pull the updates and rebuild sage, but it won't build. It may be a few days before I have time to debug the build process and get back to work on this ticket.

In response to your points, I'm fine with a restructure as long as we talk it through first.  

* Its design now uses abstract base classes for geodesics, isometries, and points.  In the current organization, the "database" of facts about the underlying space are in hyperbolic_model, divided by model.  The "database" of calculation methods are in hyperbolic_methods, of which only the methods in the upper half plane are implemented.  I think these should be separate because it allows someone to implement a model without ever having to see the details of how calculations are done. I suppose we could put the database somewhere else, like in a dictionary or database if that's wise.  I don't have strong opinions about that.  Is the organization unclear?  Let me know if you have specific ideas in mind, or even if you just want to discuss overall design philosophy.

* I wasn't aware of `__classcall__` when I wrote it.  I was basically just going for doing a clean design.  It seems like `__classcall__` might be a modularity violation?  I'll look into it more.

* It sounds like you're objecting to importing the interfaces into the global namespace.  I'm fine with getting rid of those imports.  We could do something like

```
UHP = HyperbolicPlane("upper half plane")
UHP.point(I)
```
and then only import HyperbolicPlane.  Is that the sort of thing you had in mind?  Or maybe something like

```
p = HyperbolicPoint(I, "upper half plane") # Create point 0 + I.
```

Okay, so I've done a major refactoring in which I move everything into Sage's category/parent/element framework. In doing so, I figured out why all of the `@classmethod` bothered me (beyond the somewhat maze-like path of methods); it was emulating a singleton pattern using classes rather than instances. To me, this is a bad practice, so I'm now using `UniqueRepresentation` (although this would benefit from switching to #15247). So here's the other major points and structure.

* The models are parents using the `WithRealizations` framework, and the points are the elements. I've setup the maps between the models are coercions and have methods to also translate the geodesics and isometries. Geodesics are just `SageObject`'s, but isometries are morphisms.
* I've changed the naming of some of the methods to better reflect their operation (in particular, `orientation_preserving` to `preserves_orientation`).
* I've kept most of the ease of implementing new models but by using the coercions instead of the methods class.
* I've implemented a custom hash for isometries since compared equal but had different hashes.
* More strict handling of points vs. coordinates and isometries vs. matrices. This makes the programmers/users take more care about where things belong and what one can do with them. This adds a little more burden of wrapping and unwrapping, but it shouldn't make things much (significant) difference in timings (I didn't check). Yet I would argue this is a better way of doing things.
* Removed the `**graphic_options` from things like `perpendicular_bisector` because it seemed out of place and makes it easier to keep things consistent (plus 2 distinct steps for distinct operations).
* There is only one big lazy import needed, and that is for `HyperbolicPlane`, which is the global entry point. I've added a method `HyperbolicSpace` for the future, but I didn't import it into the global namespace.

Questions:

* If given an isometry, does one ask if it "is orientation preserving" or "preserves orientation"?
* Should we keep with the `get_*` (ex. `get_point`) or just drop it to `*` (ex. `point` resp.)? I'm somewhat in favor of the way it is now, but I don't have a strong opinion.

Todo for positive review:

* Add doctests to remaining `hyperbolic_coercion.py` methods.
* Fix doctest failures coming from `_to_std_geod`. I'm pretty sure it is not suppose to return an isometry (which is what causes the doctest failures). Please advise.

Todos for the future:

* Make custom endosets for each model with the isometries as elements and coercions implemented once homsets work with the coersion model (#14279 and possibly others).
* Implement a category for metric spaces.

I was quite impressed with the code and the interactions between everything and hope we can get more of (hyperbolic) geometry into Sage. So please test out, look over, and play with the refactored version (making sure everything works as before).

PS - Phew, finally had some time to sit down to think and work through this. Sorry it took so long.

Thanks for your help on the code.  I'm glad you were able to get things working with the sage parent/element/etc framework.  I wasn't quite sure how to do that.

There are still bugs that I know about and have fixed in other branches, but which haven't been merged into this branch yet.  I'll hopefully have time to commit a patch that fixes the remaining bugs that I know about in the next week or two.

Not a problem. I hope a lot of the design is clear and makes sense. There's still a general question of what to do with subsets (here geodesics) of a given set (the entire plane) in terms of parents (so we can induce coercions on the subsets [geodesics]), but that is a separate, quite large, and probably thorny issue that we can't solve here.

Let me know as things get merged in and I can review those changes so we can get this included into Sage.

FYI, a typo got introduced in `c612e31`:

Oh, I very much agree with going in steps and I'm glad the ticket got closed, good job! :-)

Also: The issue I mentioned is much more about (relative) number fields than this implementation (i.e. I'm off-topic and should probably have sent this to sage-devel).

I guess one of the main issues is that (relative) number fields in sage are mostly "designed" without a fixed choice of embedding ("they are not viewed as part of complex numbers / hyperbolic plane"). Still they are quite important when doing arithmetic/number theory/exact calculations...

Even in the absolute case a fixed field needs to be choosen for the default embedding. To make it
work in general one has to use something that coerces into many fields, e.g. AA/QQbar.
Side question: Conceptually how would one organize/order the embeddings in a meaningful way? (I'm not sure how they are ordered at the moment.)

The issue with number fields also comes up when dealing with isometries/matrices over number fields and the group action...

Jonas

I don't think I can answer many of those questions because my knowledge in that part of math (and definitely of Sage) is likely insufficient. I think moving this to sage-devel is the best way to get the answers you're after.
