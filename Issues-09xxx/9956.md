Notice that in the latex expression the negative coefficient applies only to the 4*m^2 term in the numerator thus giving a completely different value.

```
sage: var('t k m')
sage: latex(-1/2*(4*m^2 - 9*m - t + 8)/m)
\frac{-4 \, m^{2} - 9 \, m - t + 8}{2 \, m}
```

Note: This was reported via the "report a problem" form for 4.5.2 for the "typset" option in the notebook, and I confirmed this on 4.5.3 for this simpler example.

Component: **symbolics**

<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

After installing the pynac package at #9901, this works for me:

```
sage: var('t k m')
(t, k, m)
sage: latex(-1/2*(4*m^2 - 9*m - t + 8)/m)
-\frac{4 \, m^{2} - 9 \, m - t + 8}{2 \, m}
```

Although the problem was never reported in this form, which is much more severe, #9834 and #9394 already cover this. I'm closing this as a duplicate.

Feel free to mark one/all of the tickets mentioned above as blockers.
