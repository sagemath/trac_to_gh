On a Sun Ultra 27 running OpenSolaris x64, Singular is not attempting to build as a 64-bit binary, but also fails to build fully as a 32-bit binary. (It does however build partially as 32-bit).

```

The files 

```
$SAGE_LOCAL/lib/omalloc_debug.o
$SAGE_LOCAL/lib/omalloc.o
```

are being installed as 32-bit bit objects. 

It's somewhat worrying this does not build fully. If it built fully as 32-bit, one would expect converting it to 64-bit would be relatively easy (add option -m64), but the problem could be a bit more serious than this. I've not investigated yet.
