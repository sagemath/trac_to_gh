Implements support for differential forms to Sage.  After applying the patch, three new classes are added to sage:

1. `CoordinatePatch` -- an open subset of Rn on which differential forms can be defined
2. `DifferentialForms` -- a differential forms parent
3. `DifferentialForm` -- a differential forms class.

Please see the documentation in the `DifferentialForm` class for more information about syntax, available methods, etc.

This is a very basic implementation, providing support for exterior differentiation and wedge products of forms, but not much more.  The emphasis is on making sure that the framework is implemented correctly.

Wow, thanks!  I'm not an expert in differential geometry, so I'm going to have to rely on someone else to vet the theoretical design at this level.  Here are a few python comments, though:

* `all([is_SymbolicVariable(c) for c in coordinates])` should not construct a list, so that short-circuiting can occur: `all(is_SymbolicVariable(c) for c in coordinates)`

* Checking for `None` should be done with is (it's a lot faster that way): `metric is not None`

I also added mention of two other mma packages to the wiki page, one of which has a nice Integral command.  Do you see us getting a command that can integrate like the following commands indicate?

```
The area of the unit square is calculated by:	
Integral[ d[x,y] , Chain[ {x -> s, y -> t}, {s, 0, 1}, {t, 0, 1}]].	

The area of the circle of radius R is calculated by:
SetAttributes[R, Constant];
Integral[ d[x,y] , 	Chain[ {x -> r Cos[theta], y -> r Sin[theta]}, \
{r, 0, R}, {theta, 0, 2Pi}]].


Stokes Theorem:

Integral[ d @ ((x/2) d[y] - (y/2) d[y]) , 	Chain[ {x -> s, y -> t}, \
{s, 0, 1}, {t, 0, 1}]] ==	
Integral[ ((x/2) d[y] - (y/2) d[y]) , 	Boundary @ Chain[ {x -> s, y -> \
t}, {s, 0, 1}, {t, 0, 1}]]
```

Thanks for the comments, which not only improved the patch but my Python knowledge as well!  I've updated the patch in the meantime.  Thanks also for guiding me through the sage patch process!

Some quick comments and questions:

1.  As for integration of forms, I think this is definitely doable and in fact should be dealt with before the other stuff (metric geometry, etc).

2.  I'm very interesting in seeing how the authors of that mathematica package represented differential forms -- thanks for the link!

3. Once I've taken a good look at the mathematica package, I'll set the patch to "needs review".

I'm going to set the patch to "needs review", firstly since as burcin pointed out in a private email, the licensing situation of the mathematica package is somewhat unclear, and secondly the implementation of the differential forms class is sufficiently simple so that the issue won't be with the algorithms that I used but rather whether this is good sage programming.

Some things to keep in mind: right now, the way to create a differential form is as follows: first you create a !``CoordinatePatch!`` on which forms can be defined, then you create a !``DifferentialForms!`` parent and then you can create forms.  Explicitly, this looks like

```

        sage: x, y, z = var('x, y, z')
        sage: U = !CoordinatePatch((x, y, z))
        sage: F = !DifferentialForms(U)
        sage: form = !DifferentialForm(F, 0, sin(x*y)); form
        sin(x*y)

```

Let me know if this construction is confusing or can be simplified in any way.

To placate `./sage -b`, which now gives

```
package init file 'sage/tensor/__init__.py' not found (or not a regular file)
```
messages, could you add an empty `sage/tensor/__init__.py`.

Also, if you'd like to document your new modules in the reference manual, you can add `tensor` to

```
SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/doc/en/reference/index.rst
```
and create `tensor.rst`, patterned after `graphs.rst` (say), in the same directory.  To rebuild the manual, run

```sh
$ cd SAGE_ROOT
$ ./sage -b
$ ./sage -docbuild reference html -j
```
Sphinx should print warnings about any docstring formatting problems.  The results will be in

```
SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/doc/output/html/en/reference/
```

Hi Joris,

I saw your e-mail to `sage-devel`, so here's my review :)  This looks like a nice patch, and it works nicely enough that I had to resist the temptation to ask for more functionality (which you are right to postpone, I think).

I ran a complete doctest of the sage library, and tested building the documentation, as well as playing with a few examples.  Here are some notes

* add empty file __init__.py (as mentioned above; this is required for doctesting and to build documentation)
* add author to coordinate_patch.py
* I believe it is usual for gens() to return a tuple (rather than a list); e.g.

```
sage: PolynomialRing(RR,3,'x,y,z').gens()
(x, y, z)
```

* `make ptestlong` passes all tests!

* Following the above suggestion, I added 'tensor' to `index.rst` and the following to a new file `tensor.rst`.  There are a few warnings when building the documentation that need to be fixed, but mostly it looks good.

```
Differential Forms
============

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   sage/tensor/coordinate_patch
   sage/tensor/differential_forms
   sage/tensor/differential_form_element
```

* Is there a reason you call the directory `tensor` instead of e.g. `diff_forms` or even `differential_forms`?  I'm not an expert on differential forms, so I defer to your judgment, but the latter seems more intuitive to me.

{
    "body": "<a id='comment:17'></a>\nHi Niles and Mitesh,\n\nThank you for your instructive comments.  Niles, thanks also for agreeing to review my patch!  The suggestion to include this functionality to the reference manual was especially helpful -- it makes everything so much clearer to see the documentation in nice, crisp HTML form.\n\nI implemented the changes you suggested (adding to the reference manual, adding authors, making `gens()` return a tuple), but I have a few questions/comments that are more of a technical nature, revealing simultaneously my mercurial ineptitude:\n\n1.  I made a mess of the upload section -- could someone with admin privileges delete all but the most recent attachment?\n\n2.  Try as I might, I could not produce a patch which creates the file `__init__.py`.  I added that file to my sage tree as per the documentation, instructed hg to add it, confirmed with `hg status` that it was listed as added, but when I look at `hg diff` that file is nowhere to be found.

Hi Niles and Mitesh,

Thank you for your instructive comments.  Niles, thanks also for agreeing to review my patch!  The suggestion to include this functionality to the reference manual was especially helpful -- it makes everything so much clearer to see the documentation in nice, crisp HTML form.

I implemented the changes you suggested (adding to the reference manual, adding authors, making `gens()` return a tuple), but I have a few questions/comments that are more of a technical nature, revealing simultaneously my mercurial ineptitude:

1.  I made a mess of the upload section -- could someone with admin privileges delete all but the most recent attachment?

2.  Try as I might, I could not produce a patch which creates the file `__init__.py`.  I added that file to my sage tree as per the documentation, instructed hg to add it, confirmed with `hg status` that it was listed as added, but when I look at `hg diff` that file is nowhere to be found.  The other files are created/modified as expected.  The patch also does not create `__init__.py`, as you experienced.  Are these init files somehow special as far as hg is concerned?

3.  I called the package `tensor` rather than anything more specific in order to accommodate future additions: it would be good to have support for generic tensors (not just differential forms) and common operations on them (e.g. covariant derivations), so that we could for instance do symbolic Riemannian geometry.  However, if you think we should stick to a more specific name for now, then that's fine with me too.

Done.

A peculiarity of Mercurial is that it can't check in empty files.  So usually we'll add either a space, or a comment like:

```
# This comment is here so the file is non-empty (so Mercurial will check it in).
```

or something like that.

Personally, I'm okay with "tensor", since "differential_forms" would be equally confusing to my calc 3 students, so (a) there will be a learning curve anyway, and (b) most functions students would use are probably going to be imported into the top-level namespace anyway.

Thanks a lot for pointing that out -- this is really helpful!

I've updated the patch with the `__init__.py`, verified that it passes all doctests, and added those files to the reference manual section.  So I'm changing the status back to `needs_review`.

This problem is caused because `diff()` first tries to call `q.differentiate()` and, failing that, coerces `q` to the symbolic ring and differentiates it there.  Adding a `differentiate()` method which simply calls `q.diff()` would solve this problem.  Depending on what you think is best, you could silently ignore additional arguments to `diff`, or you could throw an error if additional arguments are present.

    "body": "<a id='comment:29'></a>\nHi Marshall and Niles,\n\nThanks for testing the patch.  I never would have expected this behavior, so I'm glad it comes out now, thanks!!  I followed Niles' suggestion and added a `derivative` member function which calls `diff`.

Hi Marshall and Niles,

Thanks for testing the patch.  I never would have expected this behavior, so I'm glad it comes out now, thanks!!  I followed Niles' suggestion and added a `derivative` member function which calls `diff`.  If any additional arguments are specified, it throws an exception since I want to avoid situations like these where one tries to take the derivative of a form with respect to a coordinate.  This isn't an intrinsic (coordinate-independent) notion, so it would be better to enforce that in the code as well.

More generally, Marshall's issue uncovers something strange having to do with coercion into the symbolic ring: 

```
sage: x, y = var('x, y')
sage: U = CoordinatePatch((x, y)) 
sage: F = DifferentialForms(U)
sage: q = DifferentialForm(F, 2)
sage: q[0, 1] = sin(x*y); q
sin(x*y)*dx/\dy
sage: SR(q)
sin(x*y)*dx/\dy
sage: q.parent()
Algebra of differential forms in the variables x, y
sage: SR(q).parent()
Symbolic Ring
```

I.e, if I coerce `q` into the symbolic ring, it still looks like a differential form but its parent is `SR` and the behavior is completely wrong (wedge and diff members give the wrong results).  Shouldn't this kind of coercion raise an error, since this could never be the intended behavior?

Let me know what you guys think -- for now I'll leave this as needs_work.

This looks great, and I agree with others on getting it included into sage soon.  There were some formatting errors in the new docstrings (need newline between `EXAMPLES::` and indented code block), and since someone else gave the positive review I just uploaded a corrected version (apply only [attachment:trac9650_differential_forms_v2-reviewer.patch]).
