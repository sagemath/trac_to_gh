Currently, local_data() after running Tate's algorithm always also calls _tidy_model().  The attached patch makes this behaviour optional by introducing a parameter tidy.  This functionality is needed for the implementation of ticket #9320.

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve([2, 1, 0, -2, -1])
sage: E.local_data(ZZ.ideal(2), algorithm="generic").minimal_model()
Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 - x^2 - 3*x + 2 over Rational Field
sage: E.local_data(ZZ.ideal(2), algorithm="generic").minimal_model(tidy=False)
Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 + 2*x*y + 2*y = x^3 + x^2 - 4*x - 2 over Rational Field
```

Since Pari also does this "tidying", the patch needs to add the parameter algorithm to various functions.

I will review this.  I'm afraid that I coined the phrase "tidy model", which I now regret.  It would be better, and consistent with other usage, to call this operation *reducing* the model.  Minimization and reduction are different things and so should be implemented independently.

The first patch is fine, applies to 4.5.3.alpha0 and tests pass.

I added a second patch which **only** changes "tidy" to "reduce" as appropriate, which I think is better terminology.  If the original poster is happy with that, please mark the ticket "positive review".  If not, I'll still give the first patch a positive review.

For the future, there is an addition reduction step not yet implemented but useful (only non-trivial over number fields):  scale by [u,0,0,0] where u is a unit chosen so that the discriminant is in a sense minimal (minimal height modulo 12th powers of units).  But that is for another day.
