Currently, local_data() after running Tate's algorithm always also calls _tidy_model().  The attached patch makes this behaviour optional by introducing a parameter tidy.  This functionality is needed for the implementation of ticket #9320.

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve([2, 1, 0, -2, -1])
sage: E.local_data(ZZ.ideal(2), algorithm="generic").minimal_model()
Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 - x^2 - 3*x + 2 over Rational Field
sage: E.local_data(ZZ.ideal(2), algorithm="generic").minimal_model(tidy=False)
Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 + 2*x*y + 2*y = x^3 + x^2 - 4*x - 2 over Rational Field
```

Since Pari also does this "tidying", the patch needs to add the parameter algorithm to various functions.

I will review this.  I'm afraid that I coined the phrase "tidy model", which I now regret.  It would be better, and consistent with other usage, to call this operation *reducing* the model.  Minimization and reduction are different things and so should be implemented independently.

The first patch is fine, applies to 4.5.3.alpha0 and tests pass.

I added a second patch which **only** changes "tidy" to "reduce" as appropriate, which I think is better terminology.  If the original poster is happy with that, please mark the ticket "positive review".  If not, I'll still give the first patch a positive review.

For the future, there is an addition reduction step not yet implemented but useful (only non-trivial over number fields):  scale by [u,0,0,0] where u is a unit chosen so that the discriminant is in a sense minimal (minimal height modulo 12th powers of units).  But that is for another day.

Thank you for the review!

Yes, I'm happy with this renaming.  Even though we did enjoy your earlier terminology at the Sage Days ;)
