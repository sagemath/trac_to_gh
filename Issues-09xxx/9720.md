Adds two routines.  One creates random matrices in echelon form to be used in other routines to be added later.  The other creates random matrices whose echelon form has desirable properties, with the help of the first routine.  These routines are designed as educational tools, generating exam and homework problems, and problem generating interacts.

Applies fine to 4.5.2.rc0.

Two extremely minor comments off the top of my head:

1. "Generate a matrix of a desired size and rank, over a desired field,
       whose reduced row-echelon form has only whole values."
IMHO, "integral" sounds better than "whole".
2. It seems to me that, from the point of view of the functionality,
using base_ring = ZZ returns the same result as base_ring = QQ.
(I understand that over QQ the rref algorithm might be different than over
ZZ, but it seems to me that for the matrices you compute in the 
random_echelonizable_matrix function, the rref algorithm(s) yield
the same result either way. Correct?

Appears to me that the test that fails is testing an actual line number of source code from the file defining the `matrix` constructor.  Billy added an import statement at the top of the module, so the line numbers will increment by one?

Rather than patching sagenb, I'm going to do some tests - maybe adding the import of QQ to the same line as the import of ZZ will be a solution.

Billy,

Make a v3 patch and replace the two import statements for ZZ and QQ by the statement

```
from sage.rings.all import ZZ, QQ
```

and subsequent line numbers will return to "normal" and this very technical test should pass.  Do the very complete tests

```
./sage -testall
```

overnight and then post the patch.

I've tested this change on matrix/constructor.py and the two files David has failing.

David - nice catch!

Though this is logical, I personally vote -1 as it will be somewhat harder
to use for those who need it (teachers not necessarily expert in Sage
but needing it for a quick computation for an example or 2 in a lecture note).

In any case, I hope this will be approved as I am teaching this *right now*:-)

There won't be tons, just four I think.  ;-)  But I agree entirely.

Would you pass some sort of selector in `*args`, then make these methods of some class of matrices?  How would the documentation be immediately or easily accessible?  Is there a model we can follow someplace else in Sage?

If you'd be able to suggest a course of action, I can work with Billy to make this happen.  He's finished posting all his routines (there aren't any more planned) and classes begin Monday, so it'd be nice to get this going quickly so he can wrap up his summer project.

You can leave the functions as they are -- just don't import them into the global namespace.  Then, if you do,

```

OK, that makes sense - thanks.

We also have "diagonalizable", "unimodular" and "subspaceable", so I think something like a single keyword type/category/class/method/algorithm (I don't really like any of those too much) that defaults to the current "randomize" behavior would be better.  Is "algorithm" the policy these days for this type of thing?  Some constructors must be square so we would have to check for that first.  (And we can address the ZZ, QQ, inexact situation.)

Thanks for the suggestion and quick help.

David - I think I can make the HTML docs work well, and can include the necessary import/qualified statement in the tab-completion documentation to make the notebook/command-line docs relatively easy to access.  We'd include at least one full example in the docs for random_matrix() so it could be discovered that way.  Does that sound OK?

v4 patch is identical to v3, except the two new routines are not imported into the global namespace, and therefore two import commands are needed in the doctests.

sage/matrix/constructor.py passes randomized testing (-randorder) with these changes.  Full testing later.  Upcoming patch will have `random_matrix()` delegate to these two routines.

Billy's name should still be on this patch as the author.

For example, if I ask for a random echelonizable matrix over ZZ, with a specific range of entries, will it work?\n\nRight now I'm thinking:\n\n```\nrandom_matrix(RR, 6, 4, algorithm='randomize')\n\nrandom_matrix(ZZ, 6, 4, algorithm='echelon_form')\n\nrandom_matrix(ZZ, 3, 4, algorithm='echelonizable')\n\nrandom_matrix(ZZ, 8, 8, algorithm='diagonalizable')\n```\n\netc.  `random_matrix()` would be a big switch on the value of `algorithm`.  Default would be 'randomize' and preserve current behavior.  `random_matrix()` would throw errors for \"wrong\" rings, or \"wrong\" shapes.\n\n`random_matrix()` would have one good example of each type, with link to actual routine's documentation for PDF & HTL version.  For notebook or CL docs, the documentation would say \"use sage.constructor.random_echelonizable_matrix?\" for more detailed documentation right after the example (not tested).\n\n`random_matrix()` already takes lots of options - anything the randomize function of the entry type accepts.  I think the new functions only accept `upper_bound` as an option, as a type of what Billy calls \"size control\".

> To take care of the namespace issue, what about making it work like graphs does? In other words, "random_matrix" behaves like it always has, and "random_matrix.echelonizable(...)", "random_matrix.unimodular()", etc., do the specialized functions?
> 
> I'm a slight -1 on making random_matrix take a ton of options, a lot of which may be mutually exclusive.  For example, if I ask for a random echelonizable matrix over ZZ, with a specific range of entries, will it work?

Right now I'm thinking:

```
random_matrix(RR, 6, 4, algorithm='randomize')

random_matrix(ZZ, 6, 4, algorithm='echelon_form')

random_matrix(ZZ, 3, 4, algorithm='echelonizable')

random_matrix(ZZ, 8, 8, algorithm='diagonalizable')
```

etc.  `random_matrix()` would be a big switch on the value of `algorithm`.  Default would be 'randomize' and preserve current behavior.  `random_matrix()` would throw errors for "wrong" rings, or "wrong" shapes.

`random_matrix()` would have one good example of each type, with link to actual routine's documentation for PDF & HTL version.  For notebook or CL docs, the documentation would say "use sage.constructor.random_echelonizable_matrix?" for more detailed documentation right after the example (not tested).

`random_matrix()` already takes lots of options - anything the randomize function of the entry type accepts.  I think the new functions only accept `upper_bound` as an option, as a type of what Billy calls "size control".  Currently, the possibilities for arguments is not handled very well:

```
sage: random_matrix(QQ, 3, 4, num_bound = 4, den_bound = 10)
[-3/8 -3/5    1 -4/7]
[ 3/2  2/3   -2 -1/2]
[-1/8  1/2  1/8 -3/8]
sage: random_matrix(ZZ, 3, 4, num_bound = 4, den_bound = 10)

I'm -1 to implementing the whole graphs-dot infrastructure for just five or six functions right as Billy is trying to wrap this up.  (And possibly having to deprecate any current behavior.)  I do want to (but have not found the time yet) to implement the dot-syntax for groups.

Into the `random_matrix` routine and I've never been happy with the documentation, and I may even change the code now that I've dipped into it.  So I'm going to do that work on a new ticket along with allowing for integrating the new constructions.  See #9803.

That means that the v4 patch makes this ready to go.  It'll be left hidden until #9803 is done, but at least David J can import it as needed until then.

So if Billy or David want to check-off on my changes from v3 to v4 (undid changes in all.py and added two imports to doctests) then this can go to positive review.  I'll add interested parties to #9803 once I have a patch up, so no need to add yourself yet unless you have more comments.

This also allows Billy to be sole author on this.
