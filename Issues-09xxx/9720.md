Adds two routines.  One creates random matrices in echelon form to be used in other routines to be added later.  The other creates random matrices whose echelon form has desirable properties, with the help of the first routine.  These routines are designed as educational tools, generating exam and homework problems, and problem generating interacts.

Applies fine to 4.5.2.rc0.

Two extremely minor comments off the top of my head:

1. "Generate a matrix of a desired size and rank, over a desired field,
       whose reduced row-echelon form has only whole values."
IMHO, "integral" sounds better than "whole".
2. It seems to me that, from the point of view of the functionality,
using base_ring = ZZ returns the same result as base_ring = QQ.
(I understand that over QQ the rref algorithm might be different than over
ZZ, but it seems to me that for the matrices you compute in the 
random_echelonizable_matrix function, the rref algorithm(s) yield
the same result either way. Correct?

I agree completely and have made the change in the v2 patch.

Yes, the rref algorithm yields the same result with base_ring as ZZ or QQ.  However, as these matrices are going to be used primarily as student example problems I think it would be better to keep the default as QQ.  Although there should be a series of row operations without introducing fractions that achieves rref, a student will likely want to use fractions as they row-reduce an output matrix, and the rescale_row or add_multiple_of_row functions will complain if fractions are introduced working with a matrix over ZZ.

Appears to me that the test that fails is testing an actual line number of source code from the file defining the `matrix` constructor.  Billy added an import statement at the top of the module, so the line numbers will increment by one?

Rather than patching sagenb, I'm going to do some tests - maybe adding the import of QQ to the same line as the import of ZZ will be a solution.

Billy,

Make a v3 patch and replace the two import statements for ZZ and QQ by the statement

```
from sage.rings.all import ZZ, QQ
```

and subsequent line numbers will return to "normal" and this very technical test should pass.  Do the very complete tests

```
./sage -testall
```

overnight and then post the patch.

I've tested this change on matrix/constructor.py and the two files David has failing.

David - nice catch!

In the first line of the docstring for the second function, you say:

Generate a matrix of a desired size and rank, over a desired field,

Should that say "desired ring"?

Though this is logical, I personally vote -1 as it will be somewhat harder
to use for those who need it (teachers not necessarily expert in Sage
but needing it for a quick computation for an example or 2 in a lecture note).

In any case, I hope this will be approved as I am teaching this *right now*:-)

sage/matrix/constructor.py passes randomized testing (-randorder) with these changes.  Full testing later.  Upcoming patch will have `random_matrix()` delegate to these two routines.

Right now I'm thinking:

```
random_matrix(RR, 6, 4, algorithm='randomize')

random_matrix(ZZ, 6, 4, algorithm='echelon_form')

random_matrix(ZZ, 3, 4, algorithm='echelonizable')

random_matrix(ZZ, 8, 8, algorithm='diagonalizable')
```

etc.  `random_matrix()` would be a big switch on the value of `algorithm`.  Default would be 'randomize' and preserve current behavior.  `random_matrix()` would throw errors for "wrong" rings, or "wrong" shapes.

`random_matrix()` would have one good example of each type, with link to actual routine's documentation for PDF & HTL version.  For notebook or CL docs, the documentation would say "use sage.constructor.random_echelonizable_matrix?" for more detailed documentation right after the example (not tested).

`random_matrix()` already takes lots of options - anything the randomize function of the entry type accepts.  I think the new functions only accept `upper_bound` as an option, as a type of what Billy calls "size control".  Currently, the possibilities for arguments is not handled very well:

```
sage: random_matrix(QQ, 3, 4, num_bound = 4, den_bound = 10)
[-3/8 -3/5    1 -4/7]
[ 3/2  2/3   -2 -1/2]
[-1/8  1/2  1/8 -3/8]
sage: random_matrix(ZZ, 3, 4, num_bound = 4, den_bound = 10)

Into the `random_matrix` routine and I've never been happy with the documentation, and I may even change the code now that I've dipped into it.  So I'm going to do that work on a new ticket along with allowing for integrating the new constructions.  See #9803.

That means that the v4 patch makes this ready to go.  It'll be left hidden until #9803 is done, but at least David J can import it as needed until then.

So if Billy or David want to check-off on my changes from v3 to v4 (undid changes in all.py and added two imports to doctests) then this can go to positive review.  I'll add interested parties to #9803 once I have a patch up, so no need to add yourself yet unless you have more comments.

This also allows Billy to be sole author on this.

Thanks, David.  I'm going to move this back to positive review.  Patch up at #9803 to reflect discussion above.

# Release manager

Apply only the v4 patch and please merge with #9803 once it is ready - the calling syntax changes, so both tickets should go in together.
