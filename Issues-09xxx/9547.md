In my opinion (only?), tickets that are closed by metatickets are not duplicates.  It seems better to me (only?) to make it clear that work went into all of the issues we close, instead of making it seem like we have hundreds of duplicates that people open.  We already *do* have enough duplicates as it is :) 

And we certainly fixed it, so it's not "wontfix", and it's not invalid either, or at least wasn't before #12950, which however, explicitly refers to this ticket - it's not like some other change in #12950 made this invalid, which does sometimes happen.

You could give credit to those people on the other gigantic metaticket.

On this particular ticket here, I don't see any work done, so I would simply close it as duplicate.

Which Burcin did.  The point was that although a ticket isn't a great measure of work, we don't have to make it an even worse measure.

Well, I was going by the fact that someone else filled in author and reviewer fields and the work "just happened" to be there; see also the discussion at #12950.  But if you insist, I suppose I've engaged in enough bikeshedding for one day.
