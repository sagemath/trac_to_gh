Building Sage 4.5.alphaX with `SAGE_FAT_BINARY="yes"` or `SAGE_PARALLEL_SPKG_BUILD="yes"` on sage.math can cause many Maxima-related test failures.

See [testlong.log](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/wstein/build/sage-4.5.alpha4/testlong.log) and [this comment](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/9274#comment:17) at #9274 for examples.

So far, it seems that reinstalling the Maxima spkg "fixes" the failures.

See [sage-release](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-release/browse_thread/thread/1a6359a73d39dac2/4b4aaa26c0e22660#4b4aaa26c0e22660) for some background.

Could the problem be building Sage from a script?  I get the failures if I build 4.5.alpha4 with

```sh
#!/bin/bash
X=20
export MAKE="make -j$X"
VER=4.5.alpha4
unset SAGE_CHECK SAGE_PARALLEL_SPKG_BUILD
#export SAGE_CHECK="check"
export SAGE_PARALLEL_SPKG_BUILD="yes"

TAG="-j$X"
[ ! -z "$SAGE_PARALLEL_SPKG_BUILD" ] && TAG="$TAG-par"
[ ! -z "$SAGE_CHECK" ] && TAG="$TAG-chk"

cd $HOME/scratch/tmp
OLDDIR="sage-$VER"
NEWDIR="$OLDDIR$TAG"
rm -rf $OLDDIR $NEWDIR
tar xvf /home/release/sage-$VER/sage-$VER.tar
mv $OLDDIR $NEWDIR
cd $NEWDIR

nice -n 19 time make build
```
but *not* if I build with

```sh
$ nohup nice -n 19 env MAKE="make -j20" SAGE_PARALLEL_SPKG_BUILD="yes" make build &
```
The same happens even if I *do not* build with `SAGE_PARALLEL_SPKG_BUILD="yes"`.  The four builds are [here](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mpatel/stmp/).

Yes, all my builds of sage that failed were with a script.   I didn't even use nohup, but just screen.
The scri[pt I used is /home/wstein/buildbot. 

I suspect somebody screwed up the maxima spkg, obviously, and removed some workaround for building under a script.

William,

Can you try the build with the ecl and maxima spkg's replaced with those in sage-4.4.4? I think #8645 might be causing this. If it is we can just reopen the ticket and roll back ecl and maxima.

We'll see if it works.

That could be.  If true, it definitely means that we have a serious bug in Sage -- not our filesystem.    Here's my build setup:

* I make a symlink:   /home/wstein/build -> /scratch/wstein/build
* I build in /home/wstein/build.

I can only tell I've successfully built Sage 4.5.alpha0, alpha1 and alpha4 with a similar link in my home directory to a different local filesystem, running `make` in the directory which is a symbolic link (Ubuntu 9.04).

I wonder if what Mitesh and William observed is really reproducible, or just a strange coincidence.

It's reproducible since:

  (1) I can systematically reproduce it, and 
  (2) Mitesh independently reproduced it.

That's pretty much the definition of reproducible.

I think we should revert the maxima and ecl spkg's, and release 4.5 without them, then sort this out in 4.5.1.

It's obviously an ECL/Maxima issue, but I think either related to uncatched or badly handled filesystem errors, or ECL again messing things up in concurrent builds.

So I'm not that sure that it's the package *version*, rather than the *build circumstances*.

In this case, since William's '/scratch', I would tend to agree the bug is in Sage, not the file system. That said, I am not 100% sure, since you are mounting a local file sysmem on an NFS one. If the NFS one can't be trust, can the file system that's mounted on the NFS one? I would however tend to think it would be OK, but I'm not 100% sure. 

I know for a fact there are issues on 't2' with the NFS file system exported by 'disk - it is clearly logged

I'm attaching a log of 

$ make ptestlong

on sage.math. I did forget, and actually built this in $HOME, not on a scratch disk. However, I did not use a script. 

Ultimately there are 4 failures. 

```
The following tests failed:

	sage -t  -long devel/sage/sage/interfaces/expect.py # 11 doctests failed
	sage -t  -long devel/sage/sage/interfaces/r.py # 184 doctests failed
	sage -t  -long devel/sage/sage/stats/r.py # 1 doctests failed
	sage -t  -long devel/sage/sage/tests/startup.py # 1 doctests failed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

All Maxima tests appear to have passed as far as I can see.

One possibility for the changed behavior might be the changes to 'deps'. This is now much better than it was before, with more accurate rules about the order things are built. This could mean that the build order has changed from previous versions of Sage and possibly libraries in Sage are now used when before the system libraries might be used - or visa versa. 

Another useful to track this might be to write a script that
* Build Sage with the old maxima. Run just the maxima test to reduce the time. 
* Build Sage with the old ECL. Run just the maxima test to reduce the time. 
* Build Sage with the old maxima and old ECL. Run just the maxima test to reduce the time. 
* Build Sage with the new Maxima and new ECL. Run just the maxima test to reduce the time. 

Repeat the above 10 times. Then look at the results, and see if failures are correlated or not. 
 
I see from his comment above William rolled back Maxima, and started a build. That has now finished. All his Maxima tests pass, but he gets this failure - which is new as far as I can see. I've just built Sage on sage.math without this failure. 

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/wstein/build/sage-4.5.alphastein1/testlong.log

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The following tests failed:


	sage -t  -long "devel/sage/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/lseries_ell.py"
Total time for all tests: 8270.6 seconds
```

Why should changing Maxima make `devel/sage/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/lseries_ell.py` fail? I suspect the real cause of these problems might not be Maxima at all. There appears to be sporadic problems in this release of Sage (William for example failed to get R to build on OS X, but that works for me). 

This is a shame, as I know Robert has put a lot of effort into this release. I was actually expecting it to be one of the more stable Sage releases - which hopefully it will be, once the problem is resolved. 

Is it possible GPLK is responsible for this? That is a new standard package. I agree it seems unlikely, but I'm not convinced it is just a Maxima issue. Most likely is a build issue, which makes me think 'deps' might be the cause.

* Why should William now get a failure of `devel/sage/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/lseries_ell.py` when I assume that worked before? `devel/sage/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/lseries_ell.py` passed on sage.math when I built it.  
* Why should Maxima pass all tests for me, and all tests for John, yet fail for Metesh and William? 
* Why should I get 4 failures when I build on sage.math, which don't share anything in common with the failures observed by William? 

I think one pass with the old Maxima and old ECL does not prove the problem is with ECL and/or Maxima. Since there issues which are not 100% reproducible, I fail to see how one good build by one person proves anything. (And even "good build" is not really true, as there is the elliptic curves test failed). 

IMHO, just changing ECL and Maxima and producing a 4.5 would be unwise until there is more proof there is not another more subtle error. 


I've just run 'dmesg' on sage.math and don't see anything like uncorrected RAM errors. In fact, I don't see any corrected RAM errors, so I doubt it is a memory fault.

In my *sequential* build, the Sage library was built **before** Maxima, while the other way around in the *parallel* build.

Both builds passed all doctests (`ptestlong`).

I think revert ECL and Maxima is just a *very* temporary reversion so that we can release sage-4.5.   This reversion is just until we can fix whatever bug was introduced in these new packages, and hopefully we'll put them back in for sage-4.5.1.

Just reverting ECL will break the build on both Solaris 10 and OpenSolaris, since

* ECL is leaving files in /tmp which means building on 't2' is unreliable - OK for one person, but stops the next person until root deletes files. Patch at https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8951/clear-ECL-from-tmp.patch.gz
* ECL includes assembly code on OpenSolaris which stops that building. Patch at https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8089/disable-assembly-code-on-OpenSolaris.patch.gz

I've created #9474 for this. I should have a package ready in 15 minutes or so. 

As a matter of interest, does William have any idea why after reverting ECL and Maxima, his build still failed with `devel/sage/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/lseries_ell.py`?

That was caused by memory fragmentation on sage.math -- it has nothing to do with Sage itself.   So no worries at all.

Is it reproducible that the Maxima failures on sage.math vanish by doing `./sage -f maxima-5.20.1.p1` (i.e. forcing reinstallation)?

Then we could try just building Maxima as the **last** package, after all other packages have been built (or even temporarily force reinstallation as the last build step just to get 4.5 working).

P.S.: Dave has built a [ecl-10.2.1.p0.spkg](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/patches/ecl-10.2.1.p0.spkg) (for downgrading ECL to 10.**2**.1) to fix the SunOS/Solaris issues he mentioned above (see #9474).

Just for the record:

I've "cloned" Sage 4.5.alpha4 (with SageNB 0.8.1 and zodb3 3.7.0.p4), then downgraded ECL to 10.2.1**.p0** (Dave's spkg) and Maxima to 5.20.1.p0 by forcing "reinstallation" (`./sage -f ...`).

With that version, all tests passed in `ptestlong`, `ptest` reported "0 doctests failed" in the French tutorial's `index.rst` (where I wouldn't have expected any doctests, btw). Testing just that file gave no errors.

I haven't had any doctest failures on that system with Sage 4.5.alpha4 though, so I can't tell if this is an improvement, but at least there is no regression for me.

This should not matter. the "library" maxima.fas is an ECL library that can be loaded into ECL completely dynamically. It is currently not used in sage anyway, but even if it were, maxima.fas does not have to be present at build-time - only at runtime.

I still get the same types of failures with a 4.5.alpha4 I compiled today with the [go script above](#comment%3A2) on sage.math.  Is the ZIL is still disabled on the Sage cluster?  I don't know if the plan is to enable it permanently, but it might help to do it temporarily, if it's practical, and revisit this ticket and #9501.

According to [this comment](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/8731#comment:40) at #8731, there's now a newer upstream release of Maxima.  I don't know if it will help here.

I don't know if the plan is to enable it permanently, but it might help to do it temporarily, if it's practical, and revisit this ticket and #9501.

Here's the situation. 

[ZFS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS) is the file system used on the main server disk.math. The ZFS Intent Log (ZIL) was disabled by William long ago (> 1 year). It speeds up NFS writes considerably, but it risks data corruption on the NFS clients (sage.math, t2.math, boxen.math etc). IMHO, this is a very bad idea. 

William has three choices
* Leave the ZIL disabled and risk data corruption. 
* Re-enable the ZIL, get valid data, but at a cost of a dramatic slow down in NFS speed. 
* Buy a fast solid state disk. Then configure the storage pool so the ZIL is written to the fast solid state disk. The disk does not need to be large (even 100 MB would be sufficient), but it needs to be a good quality enterprise grade disks. Logging to a USB memory stick would not be a good idea. 

I've made William aware of this long ago. What he does is up to him. As far as I'm aware, the ZIL is disabled. Therefore, I would not trust any file in the home directories at all. I would only trust the disks locally mounted on the machines. If the problem goes away when things are built in 

Looking on sage.math, I see `/mnt/usb1/scratch` is locally mounted, so that should not suffer the problems the NFS mounted directories have. (I'm a bit suspicious that `/mnt/usb1 ` might actually be a USB mounted hard drive, which undoubtedly uses a consumer grade disk. The disks on a server like sage.math should not be on USB connectors, which is what that device name implies to me.)

`/scratch` on 't2.math' is a high quality local disk, so I trust that as much as you can trust any single hard drive. It is not backed up and its not mirrored. 

> According to [this comment](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/8731#comment:40) at #8731, there's now a newer upstream release of Maxima.  I don't know if it will help here.

I've no idea. 

We did try updating both ECL and Maxima recently, and it all went pear shaped. I don't think that has been resolved. I've rather lost track of what happened over that.
