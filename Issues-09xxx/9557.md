Given a discrete subgroup of PSL(2,R) there exists a fundamental domain of the action of this group on the hyperbolic plane. Knowing one fundamental domain for a group, gives you the fundamental domain for any subgroups. This module implement the passage from the fundamental domain of PSL(2,ZZ) to any subgroup of finite index

The way is work concerns only the second part as I have to improve the transition (subgroup of PSL(2,Z)) <-> (coset graph). The first line just build the coset graph associated to the congruence subgroup Gamma(3).

```
sage: g = sage.geometry.fundamental_domains.gamma_triangle_graph(3)
sage: g
Triangle graph (2,3,infinty) with 12 vertices
sage: FundamentalDomain(g)
Fundamental domain of a subgroup of index 12
sage: FundamentalDomain(g).show()
```
