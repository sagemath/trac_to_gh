This line in SAGE_ROOT/make

```
cd spkg && ./install all 2>&1 | tee -a ../install.log
```
will *always* return an exit status of 0, even if the build fails miserably.  This leads to much confusion down the line, as explained in this sage-devel post:

The fix is probably to do what is described here:

 
      http://www.unix.com/shell-programming-scripting/92163-command-does-not-return-exit-status-due-tee.html

As part of the patch, `makefile` should be renamed to `Makefile` (this is a more standard name).

I think we already have nearly all we need in

`SAGE_ROOT/spkg/pipestatus`

which we use often in 

`SAGE_ROOT/spkg/standard/deps`

For upgrades from Sage versions without `pipestatus`:  What if we create `pipestatus` in the `makefile` instead of in `spkg/install`?

Leif mentioned using `pipestatus` or the equivalent in the `makefile` [comment:ticket:9528:19 here].

Not yet tested, but the changes so far look ok to me.

I'd add dependencies on `spkg/pipestatus`, and perhaps a rule / receipt that makes sure it is (present and) executable. (More of such dependencies could be added as well.)

Perhaps substitute

```sh
        cd spkg && ./pipestatus "./install all 2>&1" "tee -a ../install.log"
```
by

```sh
        spkg/pipestatus "cd spkg && ./install all 2>&1" "tee -a install.log"
```
and, optionally, use a Make variable for `spkg/pipestatus`.

Some changes we should also make:
* `distclean` should **depend** on `clean`, not **call** `make` (if at all, `$(MAKE)`).
* The dependency of `all` on `build` is redundant.
* `s/Deleted/Deleting/g` or move those messages. 
* `makefile` is not a phony target.
* `./sage -b` is not consistently performed, and btw. **after** the documentation has been built / updated. Another target and dependency on that would be better.
* Targets `testoptional` (logfile `testall.log`) and `ptestall` (logfile `ptest.log`!) are inconsistent.

I'm currently not that sure that would be very portable; instead, you could also prepend `@` (to `#`, and leave the tabs). The comments were actually *shell* comments (i.e., part of the receipt) rather than Makefile comments.

I think it could be a little confusing: it looks like it should be informational, but it won't mean much to some users, and so they might be concerned or worried or puzzled.  If we skip it, then the first printed line looks like something technical which therefore be safely ignored by uninterested people...

I'm attaching new versions with "@#".

You're right.  Your idea is simpler and better.

I can't test V3 right now, but here or elsewhere, should we rewrite the `test` target so it works like the other testing targets?

On renaming `makefile`:  Does any platform (Windows?) require the current name?

This one is rather unrelated (or even better, afaik *independent* of #9896).

Feel free to improve the Makefile further, or review what we have so far... ;-) (See some comments above.)

The (or a) "concurrent" ticket to this (and #9896) is *"Put more files under revision control"*, #9433, which I'd like to see merged in 4.6.1.

(Also related: #9811, which is I guess caused by `tee`ing without `pipestatus` as well.)

**Attachment:** [9799_makefile.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9799/9799_makefile.patch.gz)

I have read the patch and it looks okay to me, but perhaps somebody who is more familiar with the Sage build process should have a second look.  I am currently doing a full build from scratch with the new `Makefile` (with capital).  I have a few comments (which you're free to ignore...).

Why not leave

```
all: build doc 
```
as it is?  I agree that "build" is superfluous, but I think it adds clarity.  It is also more robust in case other parts of the makefile are changed.

the same for

```
doc-html: build # (already) indirectly depends on $(PIPE)
```

About the comments: I think it more common to put them outside the make rules, so instead of

```
build:  $(PIPE)
    @# Note that (currently) "tee" will be run in the directory cd'ed to 
    @# in pipestatus' first argument, i.e. "spkg/":  
    $(PIPE) "cd spkg && ./install all 2>&1" "tee -a ../install.log" 
```
why not write

```
# Note that (currently) "tee" will be run in the directory cd'ed to
# in pipestatus' first argument, i.e. "spkg/":

A matter of taste, though I think making just `doc` an explicit prerequisite of `all` is more clear here, since it is rather uncommon that the documentation depends on compiling all of the code. (For `spkg/standard/deps`, I prefer at least *some* redundancy because it's partially obscure what depends on what. Especially omitting true direct dependencies because they're already accomplished through deep indirect dependencies is quite error-prone, since in fact *there* dependencies are more likely to change than here.

See above; I don't think that's the case here, since the dependencies are rather trivial and clear from the context. ;-) 

> the same for


```
doc-html: build # (already) indirectly depends on $(PIPE)
```

I agree on adding `$(PIPE)`, saves some characters (the comment) anyway. ;-)

> About the comments: I think it more common to put them outside the make rules, so instead of


```
build:  $(PIPE)
    @# Note that (currently) "tee" will be run in the directory cd'ed to

```

Well, the comment actually refers solely to the single shell command line, not the rule. Just imagine there were more of them...

And the reason for this is that files like **M**akefile and README etc. (should) appear first in directory listings, therefore uppercase.

Btw, I wonder if we should at all let the mixed-up output appear on the screen (i.e., `stdout`) when doing *parallel* builds. This isn't *that* easy to handle, because the "decision" to actually perform a parallel build is currently (IMHO unnecessarily) made in `spkg/install`. If we want to change that (I'd prefer having just *"Building package xy..."*, *"Successfully installed package xy"* / *"Error installing package xy"* on the screen and in the main log, `$SAGE_ROOT/install.log`), this should of course be addressed on another ticket.

It's currently hard to see which package actually failed to install after getting *"Error building Sage."*; grepping for "Error" gives a lot of harmless lines.

I was thinking of *conditionally* `tee`ing (at least) in the top-level Makefile (just *redirecting* stdout on parallel builds) and checking the exit status inside the receipts to print appropriate messages to some other file descriptor than stdout in `deps`.

Verbosity levels for `sage-spkg` wouldn't be bad either, especially suppressing the verbose `tar` output is IMHO worth doing, since a lot of spkgs contain hundreds or thousands of files (while the actual build log is often only a few lines).

But I must admit I've already forgotten what exactly I'd planned yesterday... ;-)
