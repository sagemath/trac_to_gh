As documented at #9833, the Cliquer library is causing problems on 64-bit Solaris and 64-bit OpenSolaris. This needs **urgently** resolving, as it is the first problem hit when building a 64-bit version of Sage on Solaris or OpenSolaris. 

Since #9870 will clean up the page completely, the changes are primarily limited to those necessary to get this building on Solaris without text relocations. The only exception to this is the addition of the -ztext flag to the linker, which will make it easier to detect similar problems in future, as they will cause a build failure.

<a id='comment:2'>Comment 2:</a>
I just realised Cliquer was updated to `cliquer-1.2.p6` - I should have remembered this, as I reviewed it!!

I need to change this, to take into account the changes at `cliquer-1.2.p6`. I'm setting to "needs work" for now. It will not take long to resolve.

Note, since the old Makefile was not under revision control, the patches look a **LOT** bigger than they actually are. If we compare the old Makefile and the new Makefile, the change is only that two characters "./" are added in front of the executable `testcases`.

```

So when reviewing this, be aware most of the changes that are seen in the attached patch are simply a result of the old files not being under revision control, and the `patch` directory was in the `.hgignore` file. 

With the change in the compiler options, there are no text relocations which were seen on #9833. Now, using `elfdump`, no such problems are observed. 

```
drkirkby@hawk:~/sage-4.5.3$ elfdump -d local/lib/libcliquer.so | grep TEXTREL
drkirkby@hawk:~/sage-4.5.3$ 
```

This means the library will be more reliable - see #9833 for a discussion of why we need to avoid this.

See #9833 for at least two reasons.

Note that

```sh
    make something | tee output_file
```
will **almost always** have a zero exit status, namely unless `tee` fails (or you use `bash`'s `set -o pipefail` feature). In fact `make test`, i.e. `src/testcases`, won't exit with a non-zero exit status in *all* cases (but at least *some*); I would change that and post the fix upstream (changing some functions from `void` to return an `int`, accumulating the number of failures and returning that at the end of `main()`).   

There are "of course"<sup>TM</sup> typos and other things that IMHO have to be changed ;-) (e.g. using `$MAKE` instead of `make`; `SAGE_PORT` is not tested but reported to be set, ...).

```sh
if [ "x`grep ERROR test.out`" != x ]; then
    ...
```
should e.g. be

```sh
if grep -q ERROR test.out; then
    ...
```

...

Btw, I think the spkg's name should have a `.p0` or `.p1` in it.

The comment in the file suggests that "make test" itself will have a zero exit status even if there are failures, and this is why the "tee ..." is there at all.  (This indicates problems with the makefile, I suppose.)  But I may be misunderstanding the situation.  We could also use the "pipestatus" script...

It **does** return 1 on **some** errors, but not all. (And I suggested to modify `testcases.c` to return a non-zero value *on all errors*. This is almost trivial.)

The Makefile does not cause problems; just the comment is not (fully) correct.

The correct way would be to redirect the output in the `make` rule itself (with `> test.out`), or - if you want to see the test running live - not redirect it at all. Of course you can also write it to a file and use `tail [-f]`; the written file will usually be deleted after the spkg is installed (and tested) anyhow, unless you use `sage-spkg -i -s ...`. So I'd prefer changing the source code and let `testcases` just write to `stdout` and `stderr`, s.t. the test output ends up in `spkg/logs/*.log`, as usual.

Leif, 

Different people have different ways of doing things. Much is personal style. We have numerous examples of that on #9603, where each of us will do something in a different way. 

Can you tell me what is wrong with the current method? I can't see anything particularly wrong with what I have. I want to get a patch into Sage asap that will allow the library to build on 64-bit Solaris. 

I will report the issue of the source code to the upstream developers. You can add further suggestions to #9870 if you want. But as far as I can see, this achieves the aim.

This seems to be an endless discussion. I'd prefer having *always* a patch level, be it `.p0` for unpatched upstream code.

When `testcases` returns 1, so does `make test` (or `$MAKE test`); see above.

Not really, though not really relevant if it doesn't in *all* error cases. But

```
make test | tee test.out
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Failed to compile test cases of cliquer... exiting"
    exit 1
fi
```
does not even catch the cases in which it *does* return 1, nor errors *compiling* the test program - which is perhaps even worse, since

```sh
[ "x`grep ERROR non_existing_file`" != x ] && never_happens
```
(There will just be an error message of grep in the spkg's installation log file. You know [these messages](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/9434) well...)

```sh

Also, running the test suite just in `spkg-install` is IMHO a bad idea; that disturbs upcoming improvements to `sage-spkg` wrt. `SAGE_CHECK`, since we don't want the [whole] *build* to fail (or stop) just because *some* package failed to pass its tests; cf. the Python package. And we won't be able to log test results separately.

I think there are still but very rarely dumb `grep`s around that don't understand `-q`, in which case one can omit the `-q` and redirect `stdout` to `/dev/null`; this anyway doesn't affect `grep`'s exit status. (But we should IMHO ignore that and use `-q`. POSIX isn't of the 1970s either.)
  
> * I take Leif's point about the fact that there should be no main in a shared library. But the code works with the compiler options `-shared -Wl,-h,libcliquer.so` on Linux and OS X, even though Leif says there's a main there. I do not want to start re-writing the source code or Makefile to remove main(). That's an upstream problem.

The original code was - sorry - messed up by some *Sage* developer. (I already mentioned `src/` was *not* vanilla.)

> If it was the only way to fix the text relocations, then I would do it. But simply using the same compiler options as on other platforms works.

Ok, (in my opinion) a work-around, but doesn't remove the real cause, namely bad adaption / conversion of a program to a library.

The "bad" flags btw. originate from Sage, too - not upstream.

> I've created #9870 to address the other issues. I agree there are many, but I don't want this ticket drag on like #9603.

Created six weeks ago, starting with a minor issue. Now we won't have to touch that for a long time I think, since all currently desirable changes are made - on *one* ticket, by creating *one* new spkg. (The situation with blockers is a bit different.)

But regarding the previous Cliquer tickets (which weren't quick ones either), `SPKG.txt` still fails to spell the algorithm's developer's name correctly. 

I've taken over *that* ticket (#9870). If this ticket here quickly gets positively reviewed, I can make the remaining changes, based on it. Changing `testcases.c` is rather independent of that, but not the rest.

Leif, 
since you have taken on #9870, I think it's sensible if I restrict this ticket to **only** changing the compiler flags on Solaris, to allow this to build properly on Solaris without the text relocations. It's pointless me making other changes, which you are going to change anyway. 

I've written code to enable the tests, but you intend changing the source code. As such I am going to make only a dozen or so bytes of changes.

I'm marking for needing review. This just changes the compiler flags for Solaris. Now the library has no issues:

```
drkirkby@hawk:~/sage-4.6.alpha0/local/lib$ elfdump -d libcliquer.so | grep TEXTREL
drkirkby@hawk:~/sage-4.6.alpha0/local/lib$ 
```

This constrasts with one of the libraries that does still have this problem, which is ECL

```
drkirkby@hawk:~/sage-4.6.alpha0/local/lib$ elfdump -d libecl*.so | grep TEXTREL
      [24]  TEXTREL           0                   
      [33]  FLAGS             0x4                 [ TEXTREL ]
drkirkby@hawk:~/sage-4.6.alpha0/local/lib$ 
```

The changes to the complier flags avoid this problem.

This seems to work on fulvia in 64-bit mode; I'm still building on t2 (I'm starting a 64-bit build from scratch there, so it will take another half hour before it gets to cliquer).

However, I can't get this to build in 32-bit mode.  On both fulvia and t2 I get essentially the same error:

Em, this is odd. On OpenSolaris I get the following in 32-bit mode.

The linker is the problem. 

On Solaris 10, only the Sun options are accepted. 

On OpenSolaris, both the Sun and GNU options are given. 

```
gcc -m64 -G -Wl,-h,libcliquer.so cl.o cliquer.o graph.o reorder.o -o libcliquer.so
```

should work on both, but it has the text relocations problems still. Hopefully we can find some options to pass to the linker which don't exhibit this problem. 

If I build with the Sun compiler, no such problem is seen.

<a id='comment:22'>Comment 22:</a>
It looks like we need `-z text` to be passed to the linker. From the linker man page:

```
    -z text

         In dynamic mode only, forces a fatal error if any  relo-
         cations   against   non-writable,  allocatable  sections
         remain. For historic  reasons,  this  mode  is  not  the
         default  when  building  an executable or shared object.
         However, its use is recommended to insure that the  text
         segment  of  the dynamic object being built is shareable
         between multiple running processes. A shared  text  seg-
         ment  incurs  the  least relocation overhead when loaded
         into memory.
```

Adding that to the linker flags avoids the issue:

```
(sage subshell) t2:src kirkby$ make
gcc -m64  -DENABLE_LONG_OPTIONS -o cl.o -c cl.c
gcc -m64    -c -o cliquer.o cliquer.c
gcc -m64    -c -o graph.o graph.c
gcc -m64    -c -o reorder.o reorder.c
gcc -m64   -Wl,-ztext -o libcliquer.so cl.o cliquer.o graph.o reorder.o
SAGE_ROOT=/rootpool2/local/kirkby/t2/64/sage-4.5.3.alpha2
(sage subshell) t2:src kirkby$ elfdump -d libcliquer.so | grep TEXTRE
SAGE_ROOT=/rootpool2/local/kirkby/t2/64/sage-4.5.3.alpha2
```

However, I have **not** checked if this produces a usable shared library or not. (Note, it is OK to use `-ztext` rather than `-z text`. It stops one having to put quotes around things and is perfectly acceptable to the Sun linker and in fact Sun tools in general. 

This **could** be the magic option needed to sort out R and ECL, both of which suffer this problem.

I could have swore I tried that before, and found it still had text relocation issues, but it does in fact work! 

I've tested it on:

* Solaris 10 on SPARC 64-bit

I've **not** yet checked it on 

* Solaris 10 (x86) 32-bit 
* Solaris 10 (x86) 64-bit
* OpenSolaris (x86) 64-bit

I added the linker options `Wl,-ztext` too, as that will cause the build to fail as soon as there are these problems. So the issue will be noticed immediately, before anyone runs elfdump. 

Do you want me to add you to the author list? It seems only fair since you came up with the fix, but you might not want to be associated with such poor code overall! 

I've updated the package at http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/patches/cliquer-1.2.p7.spkg

but have not committed the changes until I've more fully tested this, and know whether you want to be on the author list. 

Dave

On 32-bit OpenSolaris this is passing tests, and having no text relocation issues:

```
sage: /export/home/drkirkby/sage-4.5.3/http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/patches/cliquer-1.2.p7.spkg is already installed
drkirkby@hawk:~/sage-4.5.3$ ./sage -t devel/sage/sage/graphs/cliquer.pyx
sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/graphs/cliquer.pyx"               
	 [5.2 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 5.2 seconds
drkirkby@hawk:~/sage-4.5.3$ elfdump -d local/lib/libcliquer.so | grep TEXTREL
```

On 64-bit OpenSolaris there are no text relocation issues, though I'm not even going to bother doctesting, as Sage is too unstable. 

I think between John and I we now have. 
* 32-bit Solaris 10 on SPARC - builds with no text relocation problems and passes `devel/sage/sage/graphs/cliquer.pyx`. 
* 64-bit Solaris 10 on SPARC - build without test relocation problems. Not doctested, as there is no stable 64-bit Sage on any sort of Solaris. 
* 32-bit Solaris 10 on x86 - builds with no text relocation problems and  passes `devel/sage/sage/graphs/cliquer.pyx`. 
* 64-bit Solaris 10 on x86 - builds with no text relocation problems. Again not doctested. 
* 32-bit OpenSolaris on x86 - builds with no text relocation problems and passes `devel/sage/sage/graphs/cliquer.pyx`. 
* 64-bit OpenSolaris on x86 - builds with no text relocation problems. Again not doctested. 

That covers any sort of "Solaris" system in common use. The only exception is OpenSolaris on SPARC, which is quite rare. 

So I think this is ok now. I will update the package, commit the changes and mark it for review.
