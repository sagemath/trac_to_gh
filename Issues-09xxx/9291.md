Constructing root systems / coxeter groups / ... from a pair of
matrices describing the coordinates of the roots and coroots in
their respective basis. Interface:

```
    sage: T = CartanType(roots_as_matrix, coroots_as_matrix)
    sage: T.root_space()
    sage: T.root_space().simple_roots()
    sage: T.coroot_space()
    sage: WeylGroup(T.root_space())
    sage: WeylGroup(T)
    sage: ReflectionGroup(T)
```

The root system code is designed to support such features. Attached: a
one page proof of feasibility (not following the above interface).
