This was reported by Nicolás Sirolli on sage-nt:


`BrandtModule` has a problem when calculating the n-th Hecke operator
when n is not squarefree, and is smaller than the prime where the
algebra ramifies.

For example, I get a "not implemented" error if I run this

```
sage: B=BrandtModule(13)
sage: B.hecke_matrix(4)
```

Gonzalo Tornaría told me that the 'direct' algorithm is not
implemented when n is not squarefree; hence I found that

```
sage: B.hecke_matrix(4,algorithm='brandt')
```

instead, there is no trouble. A workaround could be (I'm not sure
whether this is the best to do) changing line 852 of brandt.py,

```
if self.level().gcd(n) != 1:
```

for

```
if self.level().gcd(n) != 1 or is_squarefree(n)==False:
```

(and adding `is_squarefree` to the "imports" block).

<a id='comment:5'>Comment 5:</a>
The reason why the 'direct' algorithm is broken for non-squarefree n is that the base class `AmbientHeckeModule` needs to know the character of the modular form.

Since the `BrandtModule` corresponds to modular forms with trivial character, a fix is to just implement the character() method returning a trivial character.

This fix solves the problem and (unlike the one proposed by me) is reasonable. All tests run fine.

It would be nice to include, in the hecke_matrix method, an example of a n-th Hecke matrix with non-squarefree n.
