Several projects we depend on use nose to do self-tests.  In order to test these packages, we'd have to have nose installed.

This is fairly simple without an spkg:

```
wget http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/n/nose/nose-1.1.2.tar.gz # or the latest version at http://pypi.python.org/pypi/nose/
tar xzvf nose-1.1.2.tar.gz
cd nose-1.1.2
sage -python setup.py install  
```

However, it might make sense to have nose be an optional spkg.

Matplotlib relies on nose to do tests (http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/devel/coding_guide.html#testing), as well as numpy/scipy (http://projects.scipy.org/numpy/wiki/TestingGuidelines).

New spkg: [version 1.1.2](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/palmieri/SPKG/nose-1.1.2.spkg).

Apply [attachment: trac_9921-nose-scripts.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9921/trac_9921-nose-scripts.patch.gz) to the scripts repo.

IMHO it would be sensible to have nose as a **standard** package. 

I suggested that once, and it got a luke warm reception. Having to install an optional item to test a standard package seems a bad idea to me. 

Perhaps if a list of packages which make use of 'nose' could be produced, it might be possible to argue for it to be standard.

Yes, according to guidelines it should be optional for a while. But there have been exceptions to that. Since it does not actually link to anything in Sage, and would only be called when running spkg-check, I think one could argue the risk is minimal. In contrast it would allow a number of packages to be checked. 

I think any such argument would have to be based on how many packages could benefit from it. 

It must be an incredibly low risk package to add.

Yeah, an spkg just containing `spkg-install` which is

```
wget http://code.google.com/p/python-nose/downloads/detail?name=nose-0.11.3.tar.gz
tar xzvf nose-0.11.3.tar.gz

Yep, the point of the instructions was to show that even without an spkg, using nose "is fairly simple without an spkg".

I tried using nose, and it was very interesting.  Tested Brian on two different boxes, and then tested both numpy and scipy on OS X 10.6 - discovered no errors on the first, and a fair number on the second!  So I think that there should be no doubt this could go straight to optional if an spkg was made.

I couldn't do

```
import matplotlib
matplotlib.test()
```
because for some reason our matplotlib doesn't have this method.

Much less importantly, I should also point out that on OS X `wget` is not a builtin, though I have an alias `curl -O` that seems to accomplish the same purpose.  I just downloaded and double-clicked, actually :)

This is ridiculous.  Nose works fine at testing things on sage.math.   It certainly finds various errors and warnings - apparently scipy generates a number as well, I just tried it.

The issue with it not passing its own tests is not so good, and I can confirm this in both cases.  On the plus side, it only breaks the Sage installation process in the 1.1.3, so I would say let's go with the 1.1.2 for now.

I do get something weird, hopefully unrelated to nose itself, but instead related to our defaults for matplotlib.

On a computer without nose:

I think that in matplotlib's lib/__init__.py

```

    success = nose.run( defaultTest=default_test_modules,

we aren't using the right default modules, they aren't imported or something.  So it goes back to just looking at `.` for the default test module - I get the same thing.

Can you see a reason why this shouldn't have positive review?  I just think this must be a problem in how we're dealing with mpl.  I'm surprised it does this; we only removed the baseline images, not the testing scripts!

I have also reviewed this ticket, since I think it is important to have it. The matplotlib error is really a bug (or at least laxness) in matplotlib. If we waited for nosetest to be included until all spkg's pass, we would wait until the cows come home.

If nobody objects, I will set this to positive review by next week.
