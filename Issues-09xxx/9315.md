If you try to pickle *any* residue class field, then it breaks!

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2 + 1)
sage: F = K.factor(3)[0][0].residue_field()
sage: dumps(F)

<a id='comment:1'>**Comment 1:**</a>
There is a function in finite_field_base.pyx that tries to pickle.  It has doctests but clearly can *never* actually work if run, i.e., it is never actually tested.  Here's the function:

```

    def __reduce__(self):
        """
        Used in pickling.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: A = FiniteField(127)
            sage: A == loads(dumps(A)) # indirect doctest
            True
            sage: B = FiniteField(3^3,'b')
            sage: B == loads(dumps(B))
            True
            sage: C = FiniteField(2^16,'c')
            sage: C == loads(dumps(C))
            True
            sage: D = FiniteField(3^20,'d')
            sage: D == loads(dumps(D))
            True
        """
        return self._factory_data[0].reduce_data(self)
```

However, _factory_data is not defined anywhere else in the source code:

```
wstein@redhawk:~/build/sage-4.4.4.alpha1/devel/sage/sage/rings/finite_rings$ grep _factory_data *.pyx *.pxd
 *.py                                                                                                      
finite_field_base.pyx:        return self._factory_data[0].reduce_data(self)
```

I am reviewing this now.   Question: is it not possible to avoid the code duplication?  Could we not have a `__reduce()__` function in the base class that could somehow detect whether or not that is appropriate to use?  Perhaps all finite fields should on creation be given a tag to say whether or not they fall under the factory framework?

I guess that you considered this already, and that it is harder than I am suggesting.

On with the testing, anyway!

Yes, i tried for several hours to figure out how to do that and failed completely.  Obviously, if somrbody can find a way to do whatvyou propose that might be good.  But the fact is the currrent patch fixes a major bug, and nobody has suggested a better fix.

All tests pass (sage -tp 10 -long).

Unfortunately,  this does not fix #9409.  But as it is not certain that pickling of residue fields is the issue there (though I reckon it must be) I will not delay this one on that account.

By "pickling" maybe you mean "caching"?   I didn't make any changes at all, whatsoever to caching.  The only actual change my patch makes is that the default `__reduce__` method is now used when explicitly pickling residue fields.   Before pickling residue fields just resulted in a big error.   So what I do can't possibly fix any bug that wasn't very explicit before (i.e., "pickling doesn't work at all").
