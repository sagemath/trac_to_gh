I found (and fixed) a few Bugs in the file local/bin/sage-preparse.

These are the things I fixed:

* The module docstrings disappeared when preparsing because the
preparse_file function inserted those numeric_literals definitions before
the docstrings.

* Now also unicode-docstrings (e.g. u"""foo""") are recognized as
docstrings. Also raw docstrings may now use an upper case R as string
modifier (R"""foo""" would work now) which is allowed in Python.

* Now all coding-comments as specified by Python are found and excluded
from preparsing.

* I did not fix a bug that occurs when a statement is on the same line
where the docstring ends, e.g.

```
"""foo"""; print 2^5
```
It will not be preparsed! I added a TODO-comment on the according line. 

greetings,

Oops, never mind. This line is already propagated properly. Mine had a double # at the beginning.
