OK, looks like a false alarm. I have done the following:

* Removed doc/output in a sage-4.5.1 installation.

* Applied all merged toric patches and the patch on this ticket.
* Build PDF-documentation again. Is seems to be OK in the sense that I got back to the shell prompt, there is a big PDF file in output, and I can see the modified example there just fine.

Please test it with 4.5.2.alpha0.
