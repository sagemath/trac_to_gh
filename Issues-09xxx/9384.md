The code for handling j=0,1728 needs to be cleaned up a little. Also, this function currently does not properly handle the following case

F.<b> = QuadraticField(23)
K.<a> = F.extension(x^3+5)
E = EllipticCurve(j = 1728*b).change_ring(K)
E.descend_to(F)

It returns none when it should descend to the subfield F.

It looks to me as though the curve returned is (sometimes) a twist of the original, rather than isomorphic -- but I have been flying all night so am not reliable!

You can check if there is an embedding of K in self.base_ring() like this:

```
sage: X = polygen(QQ)
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(X^4 - X^3 + 2*X^2 + X + 1)
sage: QQ.embeddings(K)
[Ring Coercion morphism:
  From: Rational Field
  To:   Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^4 - x^3 + 2*x^2 + x + 1]
```
