Attached patch makes morphisms hashable in a reasonably fast way by defining the following:

```
    def __hash__(self):
        return hash((self._domain, self._codomain))
```

It also defines specialized methods for `sage.rings.morphism.RingHomomorphism_im_gens` and `sage.rings.morphism.RingHomomorphism_from_quotient`.

While testing the code for `im_gens`, I fixed a confusing error message in `sage.structure.sequence.Sequence.__hash__()` as well.

<div id="comment:1" align="right">Comment 1</div>

There seems to be a problem with inheriting `__hash__()` methods. The class `sage.categories.morphism.SetMorphism` derives from `sage.categories.morphism.Morphism` which in turn derives from `sage.categories.map.Map`.

Even after adding a `__hash__()` method to `sage.categories.map.Map`, instances of `SetMorphism` are not hashable:

```
sage: from sage.categories.morphism import SetMorphism
sage: X.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: Y = ZZ
sage: phi = SetMorphism(Hom(X, Y, Rings()), lambda p: p[0])
sage: hash(phi)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

/home/burcin/sage/sage-4.4.1.alpha2-patched/<ipython console> in <module>()

TypeError: unhashable type: 'sage.categories.morphism.SetMorphism'
```

Note also that `sage.categories.map.Map` derives from `sage.structure.element.Element` which also has a `__hash__()` method.

Any hints?

> This patch causes a doctest failure on vanilla Sage 4.5.alpha1: 

I uploaded a new patch which fixes this.

[attachment: trac_9016-morphishm_hash.take2.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9016/trac_9016-morphishm_hash.take2.patch.gz) also adds `__hash__()` methods to all the classes defined in `sage/{categories/map.pyx,rings/morphism.pyx}` which also define `__cmp__()` or `__richcmp__()` methods, in line with Robert's remarks in [comment:2](#comment%3A2).

Robert, can you take a look at this again?

However this does not pass the doctests on my (virtual) machine which runs with 32-bit instead of 64-bit (which the patchbot runs on). Here are my hash values:

```

categories/map.pyx
 line 1047: 433071207
 line 1290: -1460497211
```
Also, I don't believe you need `# indirect doctest` for the `hash()`, but this isn't that important.

Looks much better now. Two more minor things (sorry for not noticing this earlier):

- Move the `from copy import copy` from the header of `morphism.pyx` to

  ```
  if not im_gens.is_immutable(): 
      from copy import copy
      im_gens = copy(im_gens)
      im_gens.set_immutable() 
  ```
  (or perhaps a `lazy_import`)
  This should make the startup plugin happy.

- Could you add a (short) description such as <code>Return the hash of \`\`self\`\`</code> to each `__hash__()` function.

After this, that should be it. Thank you.
