Attached patch makes morphisms hashable in a reasonably fast way by defining the following:

```
    def __hash__(self):
        return hash((self._domain, self._codomain))
```

It also defines specialized methods for `sage.rings.morphism.RingHomomorphism_im_gens` and `sage.rings.morphism.RingHomomorphism_from_quotient`.

While testing the code for `im_gens`, I fixed a confusing error message in `sage.structure.sequence.Sequence.__hash__()` as well.

There seems to be a problem with inheriting `__hash__()` methods. The class `sage.categories.morphism.SetMorphism` derives from `sage.categories.morphism.Morphism` which in turn derives from `sage.categories.map.Map`.

Even after adding a `__hash__()` method to `sage.categories.map.Map`, instances of `SetMorphism` are not hashable:

```
sage: from sage.categories.morphism import SetMorphism
sage: X.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: Y = ZZ
sage: phi = SetMorphism(Hom(X, Y, Rings()), lambda p: p[0])
sage: hash(phi)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

/home/burcin/sage/sage-4.4.1.alpha2-patched/<ipython console> in <module>()

TypeError: unhashable type: 'sage.categories.morphism.SetMorphism'
```

Note also that `sage.categories.map.Map` derives from `sage.structure.element.Element` which also has a `__hash__()` method.

Any hints?

I uploaded a new patch which fixes this.

[attachment: trac_9016-morphishm_hash.take2.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9016/trac_9016-morphishm_hash.take2.patch.gz) also adds `__hash__()` methods to all the classes defined in `sage/{categories/map.pyx,rings/morphism.pyx}` which also define `__cmp__()` or `__richcmp__()` methods, in line with Robert's remarks in [comment:2](#comment%3A2).

Robert, can you take a look at this again?

This looks good for the most part. I think Robert was thinking the `hash((domain, codomaim))` was the hash for the individual morphism, as opposed to that being the hash for the homset (as it currently is). The morphism's hash is from the image of the generators which I believe is sufficient. (This breaks down if you look at a large amount of maps from different domains to the same image in the same codomain and same number of generators, but this seems like something extremely unlikely to occur in practice. We could also hash in the parent to take care of this...)

However this does not pass the doctests on my (virtual) machine which runs with 32-bit instead of 64-bit (which the patchbot runs on). Here are my hash values:

```
rings/morphism.pyx
 line 542: 1975065480
 line 959: 467020541
 line 1147: -664373037
 line 1554: -644670332
 line 1699: 1917770400

categories/map.pyx
 line 1047: 433071207
 line 1290: -1460497211
```
Also, I don't believe you need `# indirect doctest` for the `hash()`, but this isn't that important.

Looks much better now. Two more minor things (sorry for not noticing this earlier):

- Move the `from copy import copy` from the header of `morphism.pyx` to

  ```
  if not im_gens.is_immutable(): 
      from copy import copy
      im_gens = copy(im_gens)
      im_gens.set_immutable() 
  ```
  (or perhaps a `lazy_import`)
  This should make the startup plugin happy.

- Could you add a (short) description such as <code>Return the hash of \`\`self\`\`</code> to each `__hash__()` function.

After this, that should be it. Thank you.
