Attached patch makes morphisms hashable in a reasonably fast way by defining the following:

```
    def __hash__(self):
        return hash((self._domain, self._codomain))
```

It also defines specialized methods for `sage.rings.morphism.RingHomomorphism_im_gens` and `sage.rings.morphism.RingHomomorphism_from_quotient`.

While testing the code for `im_gens`, I fixed a confusing error message in `sage.structure.sequence.Sequence.__hash__()` as well.

Apply: [attachment:trac_9016-morphism_hash.take7.patch]

There seems to be a problem with inheriting `__hash__()` methods. The class `sage.categories.morphism.SetMorphism` derives from `sage.categories.morphism.Morphism` which in turn derives from `sage.categories.map.Map`.

Even after adding a `__hash__()` method to `sage.categories.map.Map`, instances of `SetMorphism` are not hashable:

```
sage: from sage.categories.morphism import SetMorphism
sage: X.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: Y = ZZ
sage: phi = SetMorphism(Hom(X, Y, Rings()), lambda p: p[0])
sage: hash(phi)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

/home/burcin/sage/sage-4.4.1.alpha2-patched/<ipython console> in <module>()

TypeError: unhashable type: 'sage.categories.morphism.SetMorphism'
```

Note also that `sage.categories.map.Map` derives from `sage.structure.element.Element` which also has a `__hash__()` method.

Any hints?

> This patch causes a doctest failure on vanilla Sage 4.5.alpha1: 


I uploaded a new patch which fixes this.

attachment:trac_9016-morphishm_hash.take2.patch also adds `__hash__()` methods to all the classes defined in `sage/{categories/map.pyx,rings/morphism.pyx}` which also define `__cmp__()` or `__richcmp__()` methods, in line with Robert's remarks in[comment:2](#comment%3A2).

Robert, can you take a look at this again?

I don't see how the string representation could provide more information than the data stored in the class. I would be happy to add such data to the tuple that is hashed if you point it out.

Looks much better now. Two more minor things (sorry for not noticing this earlier):

- Move the `from copy import copy` from the header of `morphism.pyx` to
  {{{
  if not im_gens.is_immutable(): 
      from copy import copy
      im_gens = copy(im_gens)
      im_gens.set_immutable() 
  }}}
  (or perhaps a `lazy_import`)
  This should make the startup plugin happy.

- Could you add a (short) description such as `Return the hash of ``self``` to each `__hash__()` function.

After this, that should be it. Thank you.

```json
{
    "body": "<a id='comment:21'></a>\nFor the most part, I would almost argue against doing that, in particular, it does not make sure that hash values do not change in different sage sessions and machines (since the tests are run multiple times generally). For example, say we create an object `O` and use it as a key it in a dictionary `D` (e.g. `D[O] = 5`) and then pickle `D`. Then on another session/machine (with the same bit architecture) we unpickle `D` and to do `D[O]` safely; we want to make sure via doctests that the hashes match.\n\nActually on that note, I wonder if we need to (much less how) send a warning to the users when hash values change from one version to another. In that context, I would argue that these tests are how we should do everything and never update a hash value unless the structure of a class changes. Granted, I am making an assumption about python pickles dictionaries: that python does not recreate the object then reinsert it into the hash table but instead creates the object in the desired location. I have a test in mind that I will run tonight. I hope all of the above makes sense.\n\nHowever I do see your point since the underlying hash values can change and makes the doctests of certain classes harder to maintain.

For the most part, I would almost argue against doing that, in particular, it does not make sure that hash values do not change in different sage sessions and machines (since the tests are run multiple times generally). For example, say we create an object `O` and use it as a key it in a dictionary `D` (e.g. `D[O] = 5`) and then pickle `D`. Then on another session/machine (with the same bit architecture) we unpickle `D` and to do `D[O]` safely; we want to make sure via doctests that the hashes match.

Actually on that note, I wonder if we need to (much less how) send a warning to the users when hash values change from one version to another. In that context, I would argue that these tests are how we should do everything and never update a hash value unless the structure of a class changes. Granted, I am making an assumption about python pickles dictionaries: that python does not recreate the object then reinsert it into the hash table but instead creates the object in the desired location. I have a test in mind that I will run tonight. I hope all of the above makes sense.

However I do see your point since the underlying hash values can change and makes the doctests of certain classes harder to maintain. Also I do somewhat like the `hash(phi) == hash(phi)` test since the hash is run multiple times and it checks to make sure the object is hashable.
