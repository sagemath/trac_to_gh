The variable sage.symbolic.random_tests.full_functions is ordered in the same order as the .values() method on a dict, which is not necessarily reproducible.  (I'm a little curious as to why the order in fact does seem to be reproducible, across multiple platforms, etc., but changes with the addition of seemingly unrelated code -- but not curious enough to investigate.)

Anyway, the current code is clearly wrong.  I'll have a fix in a few minutes.

This should fix the strange random_tests.py doctest issue from #8988, and possibly reduce the churn in the random_tests doctest results.

This patch fixes the problem, and also seems to fix the random_tests.py problem with #8988 (as expected).
