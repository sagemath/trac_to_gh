Client: Ubuntu Karmic 9.10 with jsmath 3.5.9, jsmath-fonts 1.3-2, ttf-jsmath, and Firefox 3.5.9.

Server: Either http://www.sagenb.org or Debian Lenny with Sage 4.4.2 compiled from source

When displaying a formula containing "pi" with "Typeset" checked, the character Ú (capital U with accent) is displayed instead of the pi character.

Update: Workaround: Works with manually installed Fonts from http://www.math.union.edu/~dpvc/jsMath/download/jsMath-fonts.html

Assignee: jason, was

Resolution: wontfix

Upstream: None of the above - read trac for reasoning.

"Linux users with Firefox 3.5 should use the last archive in the list, as the Linux version of Firefoex 3.5 can not process the non-standard encoding used in the other archives."

Can you install the linux firefox 3.5 fonts listed in the website above and see if that fixes the problem?
