This looks great. Thanks for the quick patch!

I have a few minor comments:
* the conversion of different infinities on line 95-103 should be moved to the `_fricas_init_()` method of the corresponding classes. Then this would work:

 ```
 sage: infinity._fricas_init_()
 "%plusInfinity"
```
 and we can just do af = a._fricas_().
* Similarly, I suggest moving the code for converting the result back to the `_sage_()` method of the fricas interface.

I tried this (see fricas_infinity.patch), but for some reason that I don't understand the output of
_fricas_init_() changes into something which is not a valid fricas expression.

```
sage: oo._fricas_init_()
'%plusInfinity'
```

but

```
sage: oo._fricas_()
+ infinity
```

I have no idea what is going on here.

Is "algorithm" the most appropiate word here? To me, Fricas, Aximom, Maxima etc are software packages, not algorithms. They implement many differerent algorithms.

I'm not a mathmatician, but certainly my mathematical training would never have suggested that Fricas was an algorithm. 

I would have thought something like

```
integrate(f(x), x, use="fricas") 
integrate(f(x), x, software="fricas") 
integrate(f(x), x, method="fricas") 
```

would be better than 

```
integrate(f(x), x, algorithm="fricas") 
```

I don't claim any of my choices are optimal, but I think all of them are better than "algorithm".

If I do

```
sage: search_def('algorithm=')
```

I get **150** results. So the 'algorithm' convention is widely
used in Sage, I don't think it makes sense to change this
at this point.

Also look at the exports of OrderedCompletion.
https://github.com/hemmecke/fricas-svn/blob/master/src/algebra/complet.spad.pamphlet#L20
Obviously also 'plusInfinity()' and 'minusInfinity()' could be used as input.

The output is constructed in
https://github.com/hemmecke/fricas-svn/blob/master/src/algebra/complet.spad.pamphlet#L59
How the symbol infinity appears is hidden inside OutputForm and probably deeper.

```
)set output tex on
(1) -> plusInfinity()      

   (1)   + infinity
$$
+\infty 
\leqno(1)
$$

                                             Type: OrderedCompletion(Integer)

So the ascii output for plusInfinity is "+ infinity" and the `_fricas_init_()` method in [attachment: fricas_infinity.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9427/fricas_infinity.patch.gz) works as intended.

Wilfried, will you have time to revise the patch? Note that when #9880 is merged (almost) all symbolics patches will need to be rebased.

+1 for `use`, `software` or `library`
Moreover, in some situation, when we call the software (fricas, maxima, ...) we might want to feed it with an option `algorithm`.

First I agreed with this, but now I think it would be easy to allow something like `algorithm=fricas-risch`, and this would then be more convenient than `software=fricas,algorithm=risch`. Whereas changing `algorithm` to `software` would be annoying as hell.
