On #9074 it was noted that using the cached_function decorator on `sage.graphs.graph_latex.setup_latex_preamble` excludes it from the reference manual.  While trying to resolve this (see suggestion on #9074), it seems the doctests, when run in random order, yield errors.  This situation has been split off that ticket and moved here.
