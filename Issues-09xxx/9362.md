```
The following indicates to me a huge problem:

```
sage: G = Graph()
sage: G.add_edge(None, 1)
sage: G.show()
```

the resulting plot has three vertices, one blank, one labeled "1" and the other labeled "None".  The blank vertex is floating off in space, and the None and 1 vertices are bunched together.

Other places where a vertex labeled None will obviously cause problems:

`spanning_trees_count`, `add_vertex`, `add_edge`, `delete_edge`, `has_edge`, `edge_label`, `eccentricity`, `layout_tree`

this is not an exhaustive list; I merely read method definitions to look where a vertex argument defaults to None (and later uses the condition `if v is None`).

This indicates to me that we should not accept "None" as a valid vertex label.

Apply [attachment: trac_9362_None_is_no_name.2.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9362/trac_9362_None_is_no_name.2.patch.gz) only.

I am not sure whether this patch catches every possible way a None-labeled vertex can sneak in, but I tried to go through the code and repair such cases.

Please, apply first the patch from #11739 before testing.

During testing I noticed that

```
sage: G=Graph(); G.add_edge(None, 4); G.vertices()
[0, 4]
sage: G=Graph(); G.add_edge(5, None)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

/root/Sage/sageNoneVertex/devel/sage-main/sage/graphs/<ipython console> in <module>()

/root/Sage/sage/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/graphs/generic_graph.pyc in add_edge(self, u, v, label)
   7556                     u, v, label = u
   7557                 except:
-> 7558                     u, v = u
   7559                     label = None
   7560         else:

TypeError: 'sage.rings.integer.Integer' object is not iterable
```

That is unpleasant asymmetry, don't you think? So I modified the code a little and now it works as expected.

```
sage: G=Graph(); G.add_edge(5, None); G.vertices()
[0, 5]
```

comment [comment:4] seems to still use None as a vertex. Is that wanted?
