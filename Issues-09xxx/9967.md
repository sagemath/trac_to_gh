Currently, the branch of a Sage install is determined by where the devel/sage symlink points. This means that one cannot have one process running the version of Sage in devel/sage-foo while another runs the version of sage in devel/sage-blarg.

Ah, okay. Thanks for the help. Doing "`env SAGE_BRANCH=foo ./sage`" to use a different branch is great. I'll test this and see how it works.

Also, I see that right now, we use os.popen to call "ls -l" and parse the resulting string to determine the branch. Yikes! This is way better.

Found a problem already with the patch to `misc.py`: in `branch_current_hg_notice` (line 1872), when using the default branch, the function gets passed the empty string and things blow up when it does `branch[-1]` on the empty string.

Here's the traceback:

```

   1894     if branch == 'main':

```

Also, the comment in `branch_current_hg_notice` seems wrong -- I can't see where that function gets called from sage-sage, which is a shell script, not a Python script.

[Written before seeing Dan's comment]
I tried this.  The patches apply fine once I worked out where to apply the second one (on SAGE_ROOT/local/bin).

I made a couple of clones, called test1 and test2 and tried just starting Sage with 

```
env SAGE_BRANCH=test1 sage
```
and similar.  But I had problems running the main branch.  Using SAGE_BRANCH=main did not work.  And now, with the symlink from sage to sage-main in place, running sage with no SAGE_BRANCH set also fails:

```
IndexError                                Traceback (most recent call last)

/home/jec/sage-current/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/IPython/ipmaker.pyc in force_import(modname)
     64         reload(sys.modules[modname])
     65     else:
---> 66         __import__(modname)
     67 
     68 

/home/jec/sage-4.6.alpha3/devel/ipy_profile_sage.py in <module>()
     14     from sage.misc.interpreter import attached_files
     15 
---> 16     branch = sage.misc.misc.branch_current_hg_notice(sage.misc.misc.branch_current_hg())
     17     if branch:
     18         print branch

/home/jec/sage-current/devel/sage-main/build/sage/misc/misc.pyc in branch_current_hg_notice(branch)
   1889        If the branch is main, then return an empty string.
   1890     """
-> 1891     if branch[-1] == '/':
   1892         branch = branch[:-1]
   1893     if branch == 'main':

IndexError: string index out of range
Error importing ipy_profile_sage - perhaps you should run %upgrade?
WARNING: Loading of ipy_profile_sage failed.
```

So I think a little more work is needed.

OK, the new patch should work. The problem was that I implemented the function based on its docstring, rather than what it actually used to do :).

Hrm, with the new patch (sagelib2) I get a KeyError when starting if I don't set SAGE_BRANCH. I think you need either to (1) wrap the os.environ call in a "try/except KeyError" or (2) get one of the basic scripts to set SAGE_BRANCH if it isn't already set.

Wait! Never mind. I didn't `qpush` the patch in the scripts repo.

I've tested this a bit and so far it seems like it works fine. I'll keep working on this and hopefully give this a positive review soon. (But others should also test this!)

I ran into a bit of a problem applying the doctests patch. The branch symlinks are set up just like my comment above. I decided to apply the doctest patch in the main branch, so I qimport'ed the patch there, pushed it, and back in SAGE_ROOT, did

```
env SAGE_BRANCH=main ./sage -b
```
Nothing related to doc/common/builder.py showed up, but I decided to try a test anyway:

```
drake@sagenb:~/s/sage-4.6.alpha3$ env SAGE_BRANCH=main ./sage -testall
Testing of examples currently not implemented.
sage -t  -force_lib "devel/sage/doc/common/builder.py"
**********************************************************************
File "/home/drake/s/sage-4.6.alpha3/devel/sage/doc/common/builder.py", line 158:
    sage: b._output_dir('html')   
Expected:
    '.../devel/sage/doc/output/html/en/tutorial'
Got:
    '/home/drake/s/sage-4.6.alpha3/devel/sage-main/doc/output/html/en/tutorial'
**********************************************************************
```

The patch has been applied, but the test still failed. So I tried changing the symlink:

```
drake@sagenb:~/s/sage-4.6.alpha3$ ./sage -b main
  (usual output, no mention of builder.py)
drake@sagenb:~/s/sage-4.6.alpha3$ ./sage -testall
Testing of examples currently not implemented.
sage -t  -force_lib "devel/sage/doc/common/builder.py"
         [5.9 s]
```

Okay, so things worked when the symlink is set as usual. I tried testing another branch, which should fail, since the patch hasn't been applied there:

```
drake@sagenb:~/s/sage-4.6.alpha3$ env SAGE_BRANCH=foo ./sage -testall
Testing of examples currently not implemented.
sage -t  -force_lib "devel/sage/doc/common/builder.py"
         [2.4 s]
```

The sage-foo branch definitely doesn't have the doctest patch applied, so something for the doctest here is ignoring the env variable and using the symlink.

I think the culprit is sage-maketest, which features:

```
"$SAGE_ROOT"/sage -t -sagenb "$@" "$SAGE_ROOT"/devel/sage/doc/common "$SAGE_ROOT"/devel/sage/doc/en "$SAGE_ROOT"/devel/sage/doc/fr  "$SAGE_ROOT"/devel/sage/sage 2>&1 | tee -a "$SAGE_TEST_LOG"
```
so that's ignoring the branch.

I added this to sage-maketest:

```
# if SAGE_BRANCH is provided, prepend a dash; we'll use 
#   /sage"$BRANCH"/
# below, which will automatically use the symlink if SAGE_BRANCH is
# unset
if [ -n "$SAGE_BRANCH" ]; then
  BRANCH=-$SAGE_BRANCH
fi
```

and changed the main testing line below that appropriately. It seems to work. Does that seem like the right thing to do?

Another question: how does one rebuild a non-default branch? Let's say I have a session running in  the main branch, and on the side, I'm doing some testing in the "test" branch. I want to rebuild in sage-test, but I don't want to switch the symlink, because then the running session will get confused.

All of the various "-b" options say that they switch to a branch -- do we have to do that?

Maybe another way to say this: I want at least one of these statements to be true:

* "a running session / set of doctests / etc will never get confused if the symlink gets switched around"
* "you can rebuild a branch with something like `env SAGE_BRANCH=foo ./sage -b`"

Does this seem reasonable?

Ideally we would support building stuff in parallel too, but that was beyond the scope of this ticket. The makefile is a bit trickier, as it creates the list before SAGE_BRANCH gets set. I think all the different testing entry points should be consolidated, probably into "sage -testeall" which could take various options.

This should be true. On starting sage, SAGE_BRANCH gets set right away if it wasn't set before, so you shouldn't confuse a running/testing sage by swapping the symlink out from under it. (All sub-proceses will inherit the environment variable.)

I'd like both to be true, but at the moment the first is, which I think is the most valuable first step. OK, I've made a fix to sage-maketest. Note that SAGE_BRANCH will always be set at this point (whether by the user or by sage-env). Is there anything else that needs work on this?

Hmmm, I'm not sure this is true. Here's what I did:

* switch to branch "bar" with "sage -b".
* start some doctests in branch foo: `env SAGE_BRANCH=foo ./sage -tp 8 devel/sage-foo/sage/combinat`
* do `rm -fr devel/sage-bar`

The doctests should continue running and not be effected by the bar branch being deleted...but they immediately start failing:

We're getting there. Sorry for being so picky!

One thing I see: `sage-sdist` uses `SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/sage` -- it follows the symlink and packages up the default branch. That's fine, but that script calls `sage-make_devel_packages`, which uses `SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage-main`. This could cause some serious confusion! (Then again, setting `SAGE_BRANCH` won't affect this, and we've gone through who-knows-how-many releases with the scripts like this...so perhaps we can ignore that issue here.)

No, it's good, something like this needs a thorough review.

I didn't touch any of the building/packaging stuff. I think a lot of this was written by people who just make a whole new copy of sage rather than using branches/clones...

Actually, I had moved my symlink out of the way--of course that didn't get checked in as part of the patch :). What I'm not sure about is if they it re-established anywhere.

Hrm, removing that symlink doesn't always work: I deleted it, edited devel/sage/setup.py to not create the link (line 65 or so), and rebuilt the branch. 

Running Sage seems to work (I only have one branch at the moment, so no issues there), but if I try to run doctests, it fails with an ImportError -- it can't find sage.all_cmdline, which is ironic since I can run Sage at the commandline with no problem. 

sage-env is setting SAGE_BRANCH and PYTHONPATH appropriately, so there's still something that's not respecting those environment variables.

It would be great if you added a micro review to go along with your micro comment. :)

This patch needs a lot of testing, and it's close to being ready. So all you lurkers in the CC list, apply these patches and test!

Apply all the patches. The scripts repo gets:

* 9967-concurrent-sagescripts.patch
* 9967-sage-maketest.patch 
* 9967-fix-sage-doctest.patch 

and the rest go into the main library repo.

**Attachment:** [9967-no-site-packages-symlink.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9967/9967-no-site-packages-symlink.patch)

The patch I just uploaded still has some debugging statements but represents some progress.

There is still something in the doctesting framework that is using the symlink to the default branch and not using SAGE_BRANCH: if I doctest in the -main branch while -foo is the default, and delete the -foo branch, I get:

```
sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/combinat/generator.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/drake/.sage//tmp/generator.py", line 2, in <module>
    from sage.all_cmdline import *;
  File "/home/drake/s/sage-4.6.alpha3/devel/sage-main/build/sage/all_cmdline.py", line 14, in <module>
    from sage.all import *
  File "/home/drake/s/sage-4.6.alpha3/devel/sage-main/build/sage/all.py", line 56, in <module>
    from sage.rings.memory import pmem_malloc
ImportError: libcsage.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

         [0.3 s]
```

The ImportError occurs because whatever Python process is running that last line hasn't inherited our custom PYTHONPATH. (I think.)

Nope, I checked and the doctest script gets the environment variables right. It's finding Sage's Python modules just fine. Why can't it find libcsage.so?

I am pretty much out of ideas at this point. Someone who understands this better than I needs to step in here. I started out refereeing this ticket, and now I find myself implementing it by myself.
