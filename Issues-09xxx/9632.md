The order in which the terms in some symbolic expressions are printed depends on the platform/system.  For example, evaluating `cos(x) + zeta(x)` yields

* `zeta(x) + cos(x)` on Linux
* `cos(x) + zeta(x)` on OS X

in Sage 4.4.4 and 4.5.2.alpha{0,1}, at least.

Please see #9582 for some details and discussion.

When this is closed (which would hopefully happen with #9880 integrated), let's be sure to write doctests for both this ticket and #10282, which would just be to say that 

```
sage: psi(1,1/3)*log(3)
log(3)*psi(1, 1/3)
```
is the same on all systems, in addition to the `zeta(x)+cos(x)` example here.
