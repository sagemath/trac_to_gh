Various computations in toric geometry rely on the (saturated) N-sublattice generated by a cone and its complement and projections onto these. And, similarly, for the dual cones in the M-lattice. This patch adds what is necessary for Chow group and sheaf cohomology computations later on.

Hi Volker,

I have a bit limited computer time this week, so I can be slow in responses and will probably wait till next week for final positive verdicts.

Comments on the current version:

1) `ray_basis` assumes that rays start from a linear independent set. I would rather not make such an assumption since otherwise every cone should sort its rays  during construction (and it is not really even "sorting", it is just selecting a certain subset and putting it in front) and cones of fans will not be able to have the order of rays induced from the fan. On the other hand, it is easy to get basis as something like

```
self.rays(self.ray_matrix().pivots())
```
(I didn't check the exact command, but it is possible to get indices of pivot columns).

2) (very minor) Maybe `is_origin` is more intuitive than `is_trivial`? I am fine with both names, just a thought. And probably this function should be added to `IntegralRayCollection`, so that it is available for fans as well. Such little functions were exactly the reason for creating that class.

3) I am against functions and attributes with direct names of lattices. I want to be able to have cones in any lattice and call any functions on them. If lattice names are hard-coded into functions it makes it confusing to call them for cones from the dual lattice. I agree that `N` and `M` are standard, but in mirror symmetry it is also common to perform operations on both sides and it would be better if it was possible to do it without making a representative of each fan in the `N`-lattice.

4) It seems that some suffix like `_basis` would be nice for functions that return not the actual lattice in the sense of a `ToricLattice` object, but rather a sequence of elements that generate it.

5) Related to 4), but perhaps a note for the future todo list rather than something to be implemented in this patch. Ideally, I think all these methods should return `ToricLattice` objects with canonical coercion maps between appropriate lattices. I don't know how easy it will be to implement it, but it seems it should be more natural and convenient if it works. As I understand, tests like belonging to a lattice will then work not only for the actual lattice elements, but also for elements from those related lattices directly. I can try to play with it in a week, once I am home. By the way, if 4) is done now, then 5) can be done later without any name conflicts by adding functions without prefix. 

Let me know what you think!

Andrey

2) `is_trivial` it is then!

All methods that go into `IntegralRayCollection` should make sense AND have the same implementation for cones and fans. Mostly things like ray/rays/ray_matrix/lattice.

`is_simplicial` makes sense for cones and fans but has different code and definition, so such functions must be placed separately into cone and fan classes. I am pretty sure that I already put everything possible into ray collection class - I didn't plan it at all initially, but then got annoyed repeating ray accessing methods. Please return back the moved methods ;-) Things like containment checks are definitely different for cones and fans. Things like `lines` don't seem to make any sense for fans, so should not appear as valid methods.

3) I would interpret `sigma.N()` more like `N(sigma)` rather than `N_sigma`. As I understand both notations are in use to denote complementary things and it does not add clarity.

Perhaps a solution is to use names like `spanned_lattice`, `complementary_lattice` etc. (I just made up these names, so they probably deserve some further thinking/choosing), and make an option to add synonyms. E.g. there is some way in Sage to turn on creation of names automatically and to allow function-like syntax instead of methods. We can have a function like `beginner_mode` in toric modules (probably `fan` is the best place to put it, to allow simultaneous changes to cones and fans in the same place), which will do things like

```
...
ConvexRationalPolyhedralCone.N = ConvexRationalPolyhedralCone.spanned_lattice
...
```
What do you think about it? If the name sounds too patronizing, we can choose something like `use_M_and_N_toric_lattices`. I do not want to have it by default, but as an option it gives the system more flexibility and makes it better.

Absolutely, the only change in this direction that I would like to get in this patch are names more accurately representing what do they actually return. If they return a basis of something, then `something_basis` is more clear than just `something`. A *side effect* of this is that if we need to add `something` method later, it will be easy, but there is no necessity for this addition. I regret that `points` method of lattice polytopes returns a matrix, a list of points would be more convenient.

I'll start a thread on sage-devel if it works again for me, I had problems last couple of days.\n\nSome more little comments (I am willing to give a positive review even if they are left as is):\n\n* Is there a reason why do you want to return a list in `ray_basis` instead of a tuple? (`self.rays(indices)` will give the same vectors as the last line there, but as a tuple instead of a list) Do you think that this basis may be required frequently? I.e. is there any point in caching it? (In which case it probably should be a tuple to avoid accidental changes).

3) I think the best resolution here will be to get opinions from other people, ideally more than one... I'll start a thread on sage-devel if it works again for me, I had problems last couple of days.

Some more little comments (I am willing to give a positive review even if they are left as is):

* Is there a reason why do you want to return a list in `ray_basis` instead of a tuple? (`self.rays(indices)` will give the same vectors as the last line there, but as a tuple instead of a list) Do you think that this basis may be required frequently? I.e. is there any point in caching it? (In which case it probably should be a tuple to avoid accidental changes). Also, it may make sense to actually use `IntegralRayCollection` for bases, since it will allow easy switch between different representations (e.g. matrix, which is now done by `ray_basis_matrix`).

* Why does `is_trivial` documentation mention fans? I mean, there is nothing wrong in what is written there, I don't understand why it is there. I also try to have each docstring start with a one-line description if at all possible. I believe it is somewhere in Python coding guidelines, or maybe even Sage ones.

* INPUT/OUTPUT blocks are formatted differently from guidelines here http://sagemath.org/doc/developer/conventions.html#documentation-strings (although I have to admit that I also don't quite follow it in terms of default values, because it does not always feel natural).

Wonderful! I guess names for lattice functions are pretty much the last issue. 

There is a typo in the documentation of OUTPUT for `is_trivial` - it says the opposite of what the function does. (The function itself and examples are correct.)

Feel free to add yourself to the copyright section of the module.

In the AUTHORS section, how about expanding your line a little bit? Say "- Volker Braun (2010-06-21): spanned/quotient lattice computations added."

Despite of our recent discussion on #8989, here I am still in favour of long descriptive names ;-)

However I think that it will be very nice to add `toric_M_N_lattices` function or something like this (starting with `toric_`) in the global name space. When invoked, it will add to the global name space functions `N`, `N_`, `M`, and `M_`, overriding the standard `N` which we definitely should not change by default. These functions can behave like this:

* `N(sigma)` gives exactly what it looks like;
* `N_(sigma)` gives `N_sigma`;
* `N(stuff)` where `stuff` is not a cone, tries to convert it into an element of the N-lattice of the appropriate dimension;
* `M` works similarly.

What do you think of this? I can write an appropriate patch and put it either here or in a separate ticket.

and rewrote the documentation.

I dediced on `sublattice` instead of `spanned_lattice` because its shorter and differentiates better the already-existing method `lattice()` (which returns the ambient lattice). Let me know what you think...

I'm not sure if the lattice computations are a used often enough "by hand" to warrant the additional `toric_M_N_lattices` interface. Since we can add that always later its not a big priority for me right now.

Personal taste: I like "orthogonal" more than "perpendicular" and it is a little shorter.

I would like to have internal names in agreement with public ones, it makes it easier to read/modify and helps to avoid bugs, e.g. the following code looks strange:

```
def sublattice_basis(self): 
    ...
    if "_sublattice_basis" not in self.__dict__: 
        self._compute_N_and_N_complement() 
    return tuple( self._lattice(n) for n in self._N.rows() ) 
```
In general I think that the best name for caching the result of function `f` is `_f`, unless it leads to any conflicts. If you don't want to have too long names in the code, I think abbreviations are fine, as long as they still clearly relate to the original name, e.g. `perpendicular_sublattice_basis` can be cached in something like `_perp_sublat_b`.

How about also `_compute_N_and_N_complement` ===> `_split_ambient_lattice` or something like this?

**Attachment:** [trac_9296_lattice_computations_for_cones.6.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9296/trac_9296_lattice_computations_for_cones.6.patch)

After more careful reading of the code and the documentation, I am having second thoughts about the importance of 5) in the first comments - returning `ToricLattice` objects as `sublattice` etc.

Basically, we have two dual lattices and want to decompose each of them into two. After that it seems that there is need to access "embedded" basis of each sublattice, matrix of this basis, and work with projections that will be given as elements in a lower dimensional lattice. If each of the four sublattices is an instance of some `ToricSublattice` (analog of `(ZZ^3).submodule(...)`), then there should be only four methods in cones to access them and every single one will have exactly the same methods for basis, basis matrix, and projection. This will be more clear and consistent and will help to avoid code duplication and extremely long names. 

Right now I find it confusing for a programmer (at least for me) that `sublattice_basis` and `_sublattice_basis` are, in principle, the same things, but represented quite differently. I also find it confusing for a user that `sublattice_basis` works with sublattice in the embedded representation and `sublattice_projection` in quotient. I also don't quite like the lattice argument to projection functions - it seems to me that all lattices in question should be fixed once they are constructed the first time, since they are closely related to each other and are completely determined by the cone itself and the chosen way of splitting. (It does make sense, however, to have these lattices "incompatible" for different cones, but given the way how they work now it is not that easy to create them.)

Sorry for dragging so long a relatively simple ticket, but I seems to me that there are two ways to total happiness:

* Implement `ToricSublattice` class and use it.

* Make these methods private untill there is `ToricSublattice` class.

Let me know what you think...

Right now `xxx_basis()` methods return sublattices in the "embedded representation" and the `xxx_projection()` method in the "quotient representation".

How are you going to specify names for the quotient lattice if not by passing it as an (optional) argument to the  projection method?

Note that you'll also need sublattices of sublattices if you want to introduce an extra sublattice class. However, for example for the Chow group computation that is all overkill and you only need (an arbitrary but fixed choice of) generators of the embedded sublattice.

Actually, I have just tried the following:

```
sage: N = ToricLattice(3)
sage: Ns = N.submodule([(1,1,0), (-1,1,0)])
sage: Ns
Free module of degree 3 and rank 2 over Integer Ring
Echelon basis matrix:
[1 1 0]
[0 2 0]
sage: Ns.ambient_module()
3-d lattice N
sage: Ns.ambient_vector_space()
Vector space of dimension 3 over Rational Field
sage: Ns.basis()
[
(1, 1, 0),
(0, 2, 0)
]
sage: N.basis()
[
N(1, 0, 0),
N(0, 1, 0),
N(0, 0, 1)
]
sage: Ns.basis_matrix()
[1 1 0]
[0 2 0]
sage: type(Ns)
<class 'sage.modules.free_module.FreeModule_submodule_pid_with_category'>
sage: Ns.coordinates((2,4,0))
[2, 1]
sage: Ns.linear_combination_of_basis([2,1])
(2, 4, 0)
```
So it seems to me that submodules already work quite good for the purposes of `N_\sigma` and `N(\sigma)`, the only things that have to be addressed are `_repr_` and using toric lattice elements instead of generic vectors. It is also possible to construct submodules of submodules, so there is no problem there.

For quotients more care is necessary since in general they are not lattices. Perhaps a derived class can intercept the quotient method, construct a toric lattice if it is possible, and use the general framework otherwise, leaving toric category. There is no good defaul way to name the quotient lattice, so there should be a way to give this name somehow, but I think that is should be fixed once given. Maybe something like this should work:

```
sage: cone = ...
sage: Q = cone.sublattice_quotient("Q")
sage: Q = cone.sublattice_quotient("R")
...
ValueError: cannot rename the quotient by sublattice complement!
sage: Q.projection()
```
where Q is constructed as `cone.lattice().quotient(cone.sublattice_complement(), name="Q")`.

I'm fine with the names, but submodules of `FreeModule` echelonizes the base:

```
sage: L = FreeModule(ZZ, 3)
sage: Lsub = L.submodule( [[1,1,2],[4,3,2]] );
sage: Lsub.gens()
((1, 0, -4), (0, 1, 6))
```
For toric purposes, we need generators to lie in the "positive half-space" (as defined by the cone spanning the sublattice) for one-dimensional sublattices.

**Attachment:** [trac_9296_reviewer.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9296/trac_9296_reviewer.patch)

In addition to other changes, in the new version all arguments to cone related lattices are passed to these lattices, so it is possible to write

```
sage: sage: c = Cone([(1,0)])
sage: sage: c.sublattice_quotient(0,1)
N[0, 1]
```
etc. and it will mean exactly the same as 

```
sage: sage: c = Cone([(1,0)])
sage: sage: c.sublattice_quotient()(0,1)
N[0, 1]
```
This is done for all sub-/quotient lattice functions except for "relative" ones since for those, I think, it is more natural not to mix cone and point arguments. The documentation does not describe what exactly can be passed to these functions, it is just "something that defines an element", so those who do need description will have to get a lattice and then check how its elements are constructed.

Looks good! I, too, prefer `<=80` chars per line for the docstrings, I just didn't know that you can linebreak the sage output and still pass the doctests.

As I understand, doctests are sensitive to whitespace, but you can break lines at any space. I am not sure if there is any official description of this feature somewhere, but it is certainly useful for complicated objects. Positive review!
