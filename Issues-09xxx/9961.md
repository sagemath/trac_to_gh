Sage should be able to solve ODE

```
x*diff(y,x)-x*sqrt(y^2+x^2)-y == 0
```
under assumptions 

```
x>0,y>0
```

Now 

```
y=function('y',x)
assume(y>0)
```
passes

```
assume(y(x)>0)
```
to Maxima. As a consequence, Maxima asks on sign of y. This should be fixed,

This patch restricts the special treatment to user defined functions.

This passes all the symbolics related doctests, I think it's ready for review.
