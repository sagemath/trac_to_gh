Sage should be able to solve ODE

```
x*diff(y,x)-x*sqrt(y^2+x^2)-y == 0
```
under assumptions 

```
x>0,y>0
```

Now 

```
y=function('y',x)
assume(y>0)
```
passes

```
assume(y(x)>0)
```
to Maxima. As a consequence, Maxima asks on sign of y. This should be fixed,

The patch fixes the problem, but we use strings in new optional argument of desolve. Some better suggestions are wellcomed.

This patch restricts the special treatment to user defined functions.

This passes all the symbolics related doctests, I think it's ready for review.

Looks good for me, all tests passes.

Apply only [attachment:trac_9961-assume_function.take2.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9961/trac_9961-assume_function.take2.patch) and apply it on the top of #9835 

I would give positive review, but probably kcrisman should also look on the patch.
