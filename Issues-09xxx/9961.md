Sage should be able to solve ODE

```
x*diff(y,x)-x*sqrt(y^2+x^2)-y == 0
```
under assumptions 

```
x>0,y>0
```

Now 

```
y=function('y',x)
assume(y>0)
```
passes

```
assume(y(x)>0)
```
to Maxima. As a consequence, Maxima asks on sign of y. This should be fixed,

I was just thinking the same thing about the extra option. If we go with that option, the documentation should state clearly that this is a temporary solution.

On the other hand, attachment:trac_9961-assume_function.patch might provide an alternative option. I don't have much time so I didn't run tests or anything. Feel free to finish it up if you think it makes sense.

This patch restricts the special treatment to user defined functions.

This passes all the symbolics related doctests, I think it's ready for review.

Looks good for me, all tests passes.

Apply only attachment:trac_9961-assume_function.take2.patch and apply it on the top of #9835 

I would give positive review, but probably kcrisman should also look on the patch.
