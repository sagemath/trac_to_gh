#9346 which corrects a problem with the variable SAGE64 has a problem, because SAGE64 is ignored on any platform other than Solaris/OpenSolaris. The flag is useful on OS X too and potentially on other platforms like HP-UX.  

This needs correcting urgently as it will mess up peoples OS X builds.

I'm pretty sure I've seen it written that one can do this on OS X if you want to use a different compiler. I guess with Apple shipping 4.0.1, it is not surprising some people are using more recent compilers. 

Sorry for the mess up!

When this package is properly updated for OS X, make sure to type

Since I created it, I guess you are saying I was sloppy. It is hard to know how I can check this any more, given it builds for me on OS X (bsd.math) using 
* My normal environment
* Your script. 

It also builds for everyone else. There are numerous reports of successful builds on OS X. 

Would it be sensible to remove 'g95' from the package, and ensure that the packages assumes 'gfortran' - then the perl script can be removed.

OK, I've found the problem.  The build script is written in Python.  Thus the fortran spkg *depends* on Python.

The fix:  change the deps file, and make sure to include a comment in the deps file explaining this dependency.

One could also add a check that $SAGE_LOCAL/bin/python exists in this spkg-install script. 

Another good idea, would be to change the sage build system, so that when if spkg-install is a Python script, but Python hasn't been built yet, then an error is immediately raised.  This would keep this problem from ever happening again.  I've opened a ticket: #9507.

I'm afraid to say I don't share your confidence that you and Robert have tracked this down completely, though you have found a serious flaw. 

Clearly adding this dependency to `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/standard/deps` is correct - the fortran package uses Python, so Python must be built first. I'm not arguing with that. 

However, I'm not convinced this was William's problem, as the `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage_fortain` script **must** have been working at one point, otherwise ATLAS, Linpack, Numpy and other things that used Fortran would not have built. As I posted on sage-release, William's `install.log` had in it

```
sage_fortran -fPIC  -c lsame.f -o lsame.o
sage_fortran -fPIC  -c lsametst.f -o lsametst.o
sage_fortran  -o testlsame lsame.o lsametst.o
sage_fortran -fPIC  -c slamch.f -o slamch.o
sage_fortran -fPIC  -c slamchtst.f -o slamchtst.o
sage_fortran  -o testslamch slamch.o lsame.o slamchtst.o 
```

However, when I looked at William's $SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage_fortran, it had only:

```
#!/bin/sh
```

in it. There is **no way** that could have been used to compile ATLAS, Linbox, Numpy etc, all of which had built successfully. 

Hence I believe that something other than the fortran package later modified `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage_fortran`. Unless I'm mistaken, the bug does not reside in the fortran package at all, but rather in something that was built after ATLAS, Numpy and Linbox. 

Comments?

I accept R could have called sage_fortran in a different way, which resulted in ATLAS, Linbox and Numpy building, but not R. 

But can you explain how ATLAS, Numpy and Linbox built, when I clearly see the sage_fortran script had in it

```
#!/bin/sh
```

? 

I'm not wrong about the contents of the file. It **did** have that in it.

I realise I was mistaken here. Justin is almost certainly right when he says the lack of a new line in the file can fool the eye into believing that the contents of the file are just

```
#!/bin/sh
```  

when in fact there is more to it. This is how it looks on my screen - it is easy to see that this could be confusing. 

```
drkirkby@hawk:~/sage-4.5.rc0$ cat local/bin/sage_fortran
#!/bin/sh 

/usr/local/gcc-4.4.4-multilib/bin/gfortran -m64 -fPIC $@drkirkby@hawk:~/sage-4.5.rc0$ 
```


I'm glad I was wrong about this.
