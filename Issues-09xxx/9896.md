## How to test:

'''Upgrade path for testing the fixes:
http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/release/sage-4.6.rc0/sage-4.6.rc0/'''

Note that **non-inplace upgrades** had been **broken in** Sage 4.6.**alpha3**, due to the inclusion of matplotlib 1.0.0 (#9221) into that version. To temporarily work around this, it is sufficient to trigger a rebuild of freetype during the upgrade **when upgrading from a moved (copied or renamed) Sage installation to alpha3**:

```sh
$ rm spkg/installed/freetype-*
```
**This is not required for the rc0 upgrade path.**

If you want to speed up the upgrade (i.e., reduce the number of packages that get rebuilt) **on systems other than Cygwin, HP-UX and Solaris**, do the following **before** starting the upgrade:

```sh
$ touch spkg/installed/iconv-1.13.1.p3 # fake it was already installed
```
(This package is only used on the above systems, but upgrading it triggers the rebuild of MPIR on **any** platform, which in turn causes rebuilding all packages that directly or indirectly depend on MPIR, the GMP replacement package.)

Do the upgrade:

```sh
$ ./sage -upgrade http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/release/sage-4.6.rc0/sage-4.6.rc0/
```
Note that you'll be prompted to confirm upgrading (by typing "y" followed by carriage return), so be careful when `tee`ing the output, since currently the script's output isn't flushed s.t. you won't see the prompt in that case and perhaps wait forever... ;-) (this has been fixed in #10011.)

Running `sage -gdb` could help, but on bsd.math, I get

[...]
We need authorization from an admin user to run the debugger.
This will only happen once per login session.

My problem is I don't know how to use gdb.  After running "sage -gdb", I see a ton of message like 

```
Reading symbols for shared libraries . done
```
and warnings like

```
warning: Could not find object file "/Applications/sage_builds/sage-4.5.3/spkg/build/gsl-1.14/src/.libs/libgsl.lax/libgslcdf.a/weibull.o" - no debug information available for "weibull.c".
```
Then

```
Program received signal EXC_BAD_ACCESS, Could not access memory.
Reason: KERN_INVALID_ADDRESS at address: 0x0000000000000000
0x000000010285aadc in err_leave ()
(gdb) 
```
Now what should I type to provide meaningful information?

Btw, the segfault happens somewhere in {{{pari_init()}}}, because Sage afterwards disables PARI's signal handlers.

Well, I tried to rebuild PARI by setting CFLAGS="-fno-omit-frame-pointer -O0" and then "sage -f pari...".  (I also tried running PARI's ./Configure with the "-g" debugging option, but it failed with

```
ld: symbol(s) not found for inferred architecture x86_64
```
so I gave up on that.)  When I ran "bt", I got this:

```

John, can you provide a link to the full PARI spkg install log?

I also wonder if somehow PARI uses parts of its old installation (in `$SAGE_LOCAL/{lib,include/pari}/`) during the build (which one would not necessarily see in the log though). It would be safer to delete all these files prior to upgrading...

Does the stand-alone interpreter work?

I did these on two different machines.  With the link, all tests passed.  Deleting the old dylib file (and the old include files, just for kicks) and then upgrading caused problems: `ImportError` as above.

> libcsage.* is IMHO a good candidate... Did this really get updated in local/lib, i.e. got devel/sage/c_lib/libcsage.* rebuilt?


Yes, it did.  After taking a clean 4.5.3 install and upgrading, here are the recent files in local/lib:

```
  lrwxr-xr-x    1 palmieri  admin        37 Sep 11 21:32 libcsage.dylib -> ../../devel/sage/c_lib/libcsage.dylib
  -rwxr-xr-x    1 palmieri  admin     77488 Sep 11 21:32 libLfunction.so
  -rwxr-xr-x    1 palmieri  admin   5249848 Sep 11 21:31 libpari-gmp-2.4.dylib
  -rw-r--r--    1 palmieri  admin  21398976 Sep 11 21:31 libpari.a
  -rwxr-xr-x    1 palmieri  admin   5249848 Sep 11 21:31 libpari.dylib
```
Here is the file to which libcsage.dylib links:

```
  -rwxr-xr-x   1 palmieri  admin    83864 Sep 11 21:32 libcsage.dylib
```
The rest of the libraries in local/lib are old enough that they must have come from 4.5.3.

Necessary steps to properly upgrade (from Sage 4.5.3) to Sage 4.6.alpha0:
* Build Sage 4.5.3 from scratch ;-)
* Run `./sage -upgrade http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/release/sage-4.6.alpha0/sage-4.6.alpha0/` 

 (Unfortunately, modifying `spkg/standard/deps` before doing so doesn't help since this file gets overwritten during upgrade.)
* Run `./sage -f eclib-20100711` (just to record the **new** PARI shared library name in its various shared libraries).
* Touch the Sage library files that have to be rebuilt for the same reason:

   ```sh
touch devel/sage/sage/libs/cremona/homspace.pyx 
touch devel/sage/sage/libs/cremona/newforms.pyx 
touch devel/sage/sage/libs/mwrank/mwrank.pyx 
```
   (Three command invocations just to make it readable without horizontal scrolling.)
* Run `./sage -b` to rebuild them (i.e., their respective Python modules / shared libraries).

Deleting the old PARI shared library files (`local/lib/libpari-gmp.*`) is not necessary, but will trigger Sage import errors if you omit one of the above steps... (unless you have a system-wide PARI library installed which matches the old version, i.e. 2.3.*)

Well, I see it on two different machines. I don't have LD_LIBRARY_PATH or DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH set, and when I run "./sage -sh", I don't see anything odd in those variables.

That's what I was thinking of. Looks as if the linker also (first!) searches the old lib dir.

You renamed the directory of the upgrade / copied the Sage tree to a new directory...

Could you temporarily rename the 4.5.3 directory and rerun `./sage -b` (after again touching Cython files)?

(I assume `/Applications/sage_builds/sage-4.5.3` still exists.)

Yes, I copied it.  I always do this so if the upgrade screws up, I still have a working copy of Sage.

Okay, I did that.  Here's part of the log from "./sage -b".  Note the warning, since I renamed the directory:

I guess you're right.

Wouldn't it be easier for upgrading to see if libpari-gmp.dylib exists, and if so, delete it and then link libpari-gmp-2.4.dylib to it?

By the way, on a linux box I see libpari-gmp.so.2 and libpari-gmp.so.2.3.5 lying around from the old install.  They don't seem to cause any trouble, but should they be removed also?

I was thinking of fixing this in general, not a specific work-around limited to updating to *this* release.

> By the way, on a linux box I see libpari-gmp.so.2 and libpari-gmp.so.2.3.5 lying around from the old install.  They don't seem to cause any trouble, but should they be removed also?


As I said, on Linux we seem to have the correct order of library search dirs, so if all necessary files actually get rebuilt, the old libs shouldn't cause problems. In fact, you can use both versions "at the same time" (on Linux), i.e. some Sage modules using the old, and some the new version. The Darwin loader doesn't support this, at least with how the modules are currently built on Darwin.

For the directory renaming issue (perhaps typical for upgrades, but not limited to):

```python
distutils.sysconfig.get_config_vars()["LDFLAGS"]="" # remove potentially obsolete "-L$SAGE_LOCAL/lib"
```
(To be added to `devel/sage/setup.py`; doesn't hurt on normal installations where it is redundant anyway.)

'gcc -march=native -O3 -fno-strict-aliasing -fomit-frame-pointer -DHONORS_CFLAGS -pthread -shared'

or simply (the relevant part)

```
'gcc -pthread -shared'

I've opened #9914 to fix this; minimal patch up there, needs review.

(Note that these extension modules also did not get rebuilt because they **don't** [directly] depend on PARI, despite that fact linked against it.

Hmmm, not that surprising, except that signal 4 is "illegal instruction", not a segmentation fault (but perhaps Apple uses different numbers on Darwin 8).

Did you
* rebuild ECLIB (with `./sage -f ...`) (depends on PARI)
* rename or copy the 4.5.3 directory? 

As mentioned above, three extension modules do **not** get rebuilt though they link against PARI (and depend on ECLIB).

In case you copied the directory to keep the 4.5.3 installation, the linker on Darwin will **first** search `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib` of the **old** Sage installation, and therefore link against the wrong PARI library. You can export `LDSHARED` to prevent this (see above).

I'm not sure if the setting differs on MacOS X 10.4, so you could do:

```
sage: import distutils.sysconfig
sage: distutils.sysconfig.get_config_var("LDSHARED")
' (current setting) '
```
and set `LDSHARED` to what you see except the first `-L...` (and export it).

Then force rebuilding ECLIB, touch the three Cython files listed above and do `./sage -b`.

Btw, "illegal instruction" errors (signal 4) are also reasonable when the wrong PARI library is used, since memory might get corrupted and function pointers may point to some arbitrary location.

This upgrade problem isn't that hard to fix (since we now know the two rather unrelated causes), but I think I'll open a follow-up ticket for the necessary patches.

The file `paripriv.h` is also patched on Solaris. 

Note William told me the file should be private to Pari (hence the "priv" in the name), so he is not surprised it needs patching for OS X and Solaris.

<a id='comment:54'></a>
I've attached a few patches / files and their diffs that make upgrading from Sage < 4.6 (i.e. to the new PARI) work.

I think this is a general improvement (not limited to PARI upgrade), though for e.g. the GMP/MPIR 2.1.2 upgrade (see #8664), more dependencies (or some other mechanism) have to be added to `module_list.py` to properly rebuild the Sage *library* (i.e. **all** *extension modules* that depend on MPIR). Sage *packages* depending on an upgraded spkg will now get rebuilt without the need to download unmodified "new" versions (with just the patch level bumped in order to get them rebuilt).

I'm setting this to "needs review", though I've not yet uploaded a patch to get around the specific *Darwin* linker problem (but I'll provide one later).

When doing an "in-place" upgrade (i.e. keeping the old directory name), the current patches should also fully work on MacOS X. A work-around to the linker problem (i.e. when the Sage to be upgraded is located in a new directory) is manually setting (and exporting) `LDSHARED` to the output of `distutils.sysconfig.get_config_var("LDSHARED")` with the second "word" (`-L...`) either dropped or replaced by `-L` immediately followed by `$SAGE_ROOT/local/lib` (with `$SAGE_ROOT` the actual directory name, not the environment variable; see also comments above for more details).

Unfortunately we'll have to set up a Sage package server (or a special directory on e.g. `www.sagemath.org`) to "fully" test this, i.e. by *really* running `sage -upgrade`.

On the other hand, the changes are quite small such that they should easily be reviewed. The behavior can be tested by e.g. running `make` with `SAGE_UPGRADING` set to "yes", faking some spkg was new (to see that all dependent spkgs really get rebuilt) etc. .

One can also test it by doing a real upgrade from some **vanilla** version to 4.6.alpha1, **after that** applying the patch to `module_list.py` and copying over the new `spkg/install` and `spkg/standard/deps`, then exporting `SAGE_UPGRADE=yes` and running `make`. Then everything should be properly [re]built.

If one tests upgrading in a new directory (renamed or copied) on MacOS X, it should be suffient to do

```sh
export LDSHARED="gcc -bundle -undefined dynamic_lookup"
```
**before** running `./sage -upgrade ...` (with the upgrade path provided by Jeroen).

As is often the case with upgrading, I'm puzzled by the logic here.  How can any patches help an upgrade from 4.5.3 (for example) to 4.6?

- Upgrading won't affect files like `spkg/standard/deps` or `spkg/install` as long as those files aren't tracked anywhere -- see #9433.
- Upgrading will change scripts like `sage-upgrade`, but of course it has to be running the old versions during the upgrade process.

I can understand that patches to these files might help in future versions, but is there any way to deal with 4.5.3 to 4.6?

(Meanwhile, I'm building a vanilla 4.5.3 to test the new upgrade path.)

The new {{{spkg/install}}} is aware of that, i.e. deals with an old {{{sage-upgrade}}}, too. (See comments in the patch to the former.)

Fine. I've copied a 4.5.3 installation (''of course''^TM^ first running out of disk space) on Ubuntu 9.04 x86 and am currently running the upgrade.

Note that when teeing the output it appears to hang, since the user is prompted, but the output isn't flushed. (One has to type "y" and hit return to start upgrading.) I'll open a ticket for that.

But a copy of that is already present (in `spkg/base/`), so it doesn't have to be extracted from an spkg, and is just copied over to `local/bin` (and later overwritten by the one from `sage_scripts`).

That's a total mess. It's not *still*, it's **again** the old one!

Hopefully trac isn't affected by such...

I only wonder if `spkg/install` gets somehow again overwritten during the upgrade process, since **after** the upgrade, I again have the old version, though I verified the new one was downloaded in the first place (and otherwise I wouldn't have run into the *rebuild all* issue; `sage-spkg` was definitely called with `-f`).

Perhaps it (i.e. the old version) got later again downloaded when doing the *Double-checking...*.

And perhaps William should follow Dave and enable the ZIL (on an SSD).

From `sage-sage`:

```sh
if [ "$1" = '-upgrade' -o "$1" = "--upgrade" ]; then
    # People often move the Sage install right before doing the upgrade, so it's
    # important to fix any path hardcoding issues first, or certain library
    # links will fail.
    "$SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/"sage-location

    # Do it twice since when installing sage-scripts and a running
    # script changes, it gets confused and exits with an error.
    # Running again (with the script replaced) then fixes the problem.
    # Run from a temporary copy of sage-sage
    shift
    sage-upgrade "$@"
    if [ $? = 2 ]; then   # this exit codes means the user elected not to do the upgrade at all.
        exit $?
    fi
    echo "Double checking that all packages have been installed."
    sage-upgrade "$@"
    exit $?
fi
```
But `sage-update` won't download `spkg/install` twice if *"No new spkgs"* are available, which should be the case after a successful (first) upgrade.

So it must get overwritten from somewhere else...

Yep, it's overwritten in `sage_scripts-*`'s `spkg-install`, and Jeroen (also) forgot to put the new one into the `sage_scripts` spkg, s.t. **after** the upgrade, the old one is back.

(`deps` and `sage-upgrade` are ok.)

I've successfully built and tested 4.6.alpha1 (from scratch) with a *modified* `deps` file where only the Sage library spkg depends on the Sage scripts, with 32 jobs on an already 50% loaded system.

So as I expected, adding the scripts to `$(BASE)` is obsolete.

I added the scripts to `$(BASE)` during the reorganization of `deps` at #8306, because of the problem mentioned in [comment:ticket:8306:29 this comment].  This may well have been overkill.

Well, `spkg/install` and `spkg/standard/deps` are current again, but you've checked the (also current) `install` in (s.t. it's now in the Sage scripts repo, and also ends up in `$SAGE_ROOT/local/bin` where the scripts repo of the installation lives):

```sh
leif@quadriga:~/tmp/sage_scripts-4.6.upgradetest_alpha1$ hg log -v install     
changeset:   1582:876225f0dec8
tag:         4.6.upgradetest_alpha1

files:       install
description:
#9896: new spkg/install


leif@quadriga:~/tmp/sage_scripts-4.6.upgradetest_alpha1$ 
```
(The file should be in `.hgignore`.)

I don't think the instance in the `sage_scripts` spkg should be copied over `spkg/install` during that spkg's installation; if at all (see below), we should do that **after** the running instance of `spkg/install` has terminated, i.e. from the scripts that start it (`sage-upgrade` and the top-level Makefile, perhaps some other scripts).

But in principle we don't have to copy it at all; we should just make sure that both are the same. If that's *not* the case, something went very wrong. This is true for both upgrades *and* builds from scratch.

```
sage-spkg}}} is copied over to {{{$SAGE_LOCAL/bin}}} early, in {{{dir-0.1-install}}} (and {{{$SAGE_ROOT/sage}}} is also present), but not {{{$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage-sage}}}:

Hopefully. ;-)

If we keep it at all (we already had that discussion), it should be and certainly should have earlier been included in `base/`.

I intended to make the Sage library depend on the Sage scripts; `sagetex` of course (also) depends on the former.

So, this means that {{{install}}} should be put in {{{.hgignore}}}, right?

Btw, if somebody reviewed #10016 (and that got merged into Sage 4.6), we could drop the dependency of R on `sage_scripts`, which would further decrease the number of packages that have to be rebuilt during an upgrade.

(The `sage_scripts` spkg currently "changes" in **any** new Sage version, which is sub-optimal anyway.)

ptestlong}}}? Some extension modules should still refer to the ''old'' PARI shared library, which can cause trouble. Did you do anything else except {{{export LDSHARED=...}}} and {{{./sage -upgrade /path/to/alpha3}}}?

Currently just four IIRC... ;-)

While setting {{{LDSHARED}}} is not necessary on systems other than MacOS X (at least as far as I know / on the supported platforms), the patches make upgrading more "reliable". (I personally had to play a little to make upgrading fail on my Linux boxes I must admit, but without the patches it definitely ''can'' fail. Also, we'd run into similar problems when it comes to upgrading e.g. MPIR; to make ''that'' work, we'll in addition have to add some more dependencies to {{{module_list.py}}}.)

I intended to do so, there are just (too) many ways how one could do this. ;-) (Basically e.g. adding a few Darwin-specific lines to {{{devel/sage/setup.py}}}, which is part of the {{{sage-x.y.z.spkg}}}, which "of course" gets updated upon ''every'' upgrade, regardless if there are any changes to the Sage library at all - besides {{{version.py}}} which is or will become redundant anyway.)

Since #10016 has been merged into Sage 4.6.alpha2, I've attached a new version (v3) of `spkg/standard/deps`, which just removes the dependency of R on `sage_scripts`.

Here's a diff between v2b and v3:

(Note that neither `spkg/install` nor `spkg/standard/deps` have changed between Sage 4.6.alpha1 and 4.6.alpha3, so there's no new v3 of the former, and the diffs apply to alpha1...alpha3. Also, although `devel/sage/module_list.py` has changed, the current patch here still applies to Sage 4.6.alpha3 without rejects.)

I've attached a patch that avoids manually setting `LDSHARED` on MacOS X.

Of course the upgrade path has yet to be updated for testing this, but the patch can be reviewed.

One can also (partially) test the new patch by (optionally renaming the Sage directory of an installation to be upgraded, then) running `./sage -upgrade ...` with the *current* upgrade path, and **after that** applying [the new patch](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/raw-attachment/ticket/9896/trac_9896-fix_hardcoded_libdirs_in_extmod_linker_cmd-sagelib.patch) to the Sage library, then running `./sage -ba` and `make ptestlong` or alike.

Just for the record: I again did a fresh build of Sage 4.5.3, renamed the directory and then upgraded to Sage 4.6.alpha**2** with the (previous) test upgrade path (on Ubuntu 10.04 x86_64).

The upgrade failed in the first place, I then "successfully" ran `make` (all new packages are present) and now I get lots of doctest errors (`ptestlong`).

More to come (still running); currently testing the new alpha**3** test upgrade path on another machine.

I've now successfully upgraded to Sage 4.6.alpha3 (from fresh builds of Sage 4.5.3) and (with the exception of the 32-bit system) `ptestlong` passed without errors on:

* Ubuntu 9.04 x86 (in-place; after upgrading I now also get #10041, which doesn't occur when building from scratch)

* Ubuntu 9.04 x86_64 (Sage installation moved before upgrading, with the work-around given in the description, i.e. also forcing a rebuild of freetype)

* Ubuntu 10.04 x86_64 (in-place)

I also "repaired" a failed upgrade from a moved Sage installation on the latter system by forcing reinstallation of freetype and running `make` afterwards; `ptestlong` then also passed without errors.

---

Currently, the installation of matplotlib 1.0.0 (included in alpha3, #9221) breaks older versions of matplotlib in **other** Sage installations; this is now fixed by #6235.

Deleting or renaming `$HOME/.matplotlib/` (probably each time) before running an older (or after running the new) version of Sage also avoids that problem (cf. traceback above, *"TypeError: coercing to Unicode: need string or buffer, dict found"*).

Thanks!

Upgrading from Sage 4.4.4 in a renamed directory (with the official rc0 upgrade path) fully worked for me on Ubuntu 9.04 x86_64 (Core2, gcc 4.3.3; parallel build with 16 jobs).

Quite surprisingly, even `ptestlong` passed without any doctest errors. ;-) (Cf. sage-release.)

Despite that, I guess there are still missing dependencies in `module_list.py` that will come into play when e.g. updating MPIR (#8664). (I primarily addressed upgrading to the new PARI on this ticket; more changes should IMHO be made on other / the respective spkg tickets.)

> Despite that, I guess there are still missing dependencies in `module_list.py` that will come into play when e.g. updating MPIR (#8664). (I primarily addressed upgrading to the new PARI on this ticket; more changes should IMHO be made on other / the respective spkg tickets.)


NumPy and SciPy (#9808) are other candidates.

```

No, that's intentional. `self.debug_print()` only produces output if `DISTUTILS_DEBUG` is set.

In contrast, `self.compiler.warn()` always prints a message, so you should find *"warning: Replacing library search directory ..."* in the logs of the installations you had moved:

```sh
$ grep "^warning: " install.log
```
or

```sh
$ grep "^warning: Replacing" spkg/logs/sage-*
```
should show these.

I don't think John has Sun's `grep` installed on MacOS X... ;-)

---

On topic again:

There are two reasons you (John) can't find such messages:

* `./sage -upgrade` doesn't log to `install.log` (I used `script` to log what happened, also because of #10011.)

* There's a less obvious indirect dependency of Python on iconv (via GNUTLS, libgpg_error), so the Python spkg got rebuilt, too, which of course also updated the library search path of distutils.

Funny, that's because `newest_version` doesn't inspect `spkg/installed/*`, but e.g. `spkg/standard/*.spkg` (and therefore `make` concludes all is up-to-date).

So it works the way I originally described.

Given the title title had the "(not limited to OS X)" I assumed this needed a solution to work on any platform. But I've not been following this ticket closely, so I'll shut up. 

If John does manage to install Sun's grep on his OS X machine, let me know how. I might even buy a Mac then!

Update: on one OS X 10.6 machine, after touching spkg/installed/iconv-1.13.1.p3, it doesn't matter whether I run "make build" or not before upgrading: I get the above error with linbox either way.  On another OS X 10.6 machine, I didn't run "make build" and it seemed to complete successfully; I haven't tried with "make build".  I'll run doctests to see if it's really successful.

I don't know what's different about the two machines.  Maybe the 4.5.3 build got corrupted on the first one somehow?  I can try rebuilding 4.5.3 and doing it again...

It would in any case be better to trap `SIGINT` / `KeyboardInterrupt` while doing `sage-location`, or make backup copies first.

Also, it would be helpful for such situations to
* log `$SAGE_ROOT` changes / movement (in a history file) for debugging or even to get the previous one,
* perhaps log what changes `sage-location` made (to some file, perhaps a summary on the screen),
* log the whole upgrade process as we do for builds / spkg installations (I'd suggest `$SAGE_ROOT/upgrade.log`, but only after #10011 and #10157 have been merged).

Do you still have the broken installation? If so, you could

```sh
$ ls -rtl local/lib/*.la # see which were changed last / when
$ cat local/lib/libgmpxx.la # to see the wrong paths
```
(libtool's `.la` files are plain text files.

So it appears to be a bug in `sage-location`?

Can you track this further down on a follow-up ticket? Works for me on Linuces...

Perhaps copy all `.la` files to a temporary directory, move Sage (and run `./sage -c quit` to invoke `sage-location`), and then compare them.

I think we need to list eclib headers for these modules, so that during an upgrade, if the eclib package is rebuilt, because eclib and/or a dependent package has changed, the modules are also rebuilt.  Is this correct?

I see

```sh
$ cd sage-4.6.rc0/devel/sage/sage/libs/mwrank
$ grep "eclib/" *.c* *.h
wrap.cc:#include "eclib/htconst.h"
wrap.cc:#include "eclib/interface.h"
wrap.h:#include "eclib/curve.h"
wrap.h:#include "eclib/egr.h"    
wrap.h:#include "eclib/descent.h"
wrap.h:#include "eclib/points.h"
wrap.h:#include "eclib/isogs.h"
wrap.h:#include "eclib/marith.h" 
wrap.h:EXTERN void two_descent_saturate(struct two_descent* t, long sat_bd); // = -1 for default set in eclib/src/qcurves/saturate.h (currently 100)
```
and

```sh
$ cd sage-4.6.rc0/devel/sage/sage/libs/cremona
$ grep "eclib/" *.cpp | grep -v cdef
homspace.cpp:#include "eclib/moddata.h"
homspace.cpp:#include "eclib/symb.h"

mat.cpp:#include "eclib/cusp.h"
mat.cpp:#include "eclib/homspace.h"
newforms.cpp:#include "eclib/interface.h"
newforms.cpp:#include "eclib/bigrat.h"
newforms.cpp:#include "eclib/rat.h"
newforms.cpp:#include "eclib/curve.h"

```
For `homspace` and `mat`, do we need to mention in `module_list.py` the `eclib/` headers that aren't listed above?

Exactly. I did that some weeks ago when debugging the original problem...

If any of these header files (to be precise, its modification time) changes, an extension module having it in its dependencies will get rebuilt. (The problem was this did not happen when ECLIB got rebuilt, such that these modules still used - or better: pulled-in - the old PARI library, which resulted in segfaults or import / dynamic linker errors.) 

Perhaps a little overkill (we just could rebuild all of these modules if *any* ECLIB header file changes), but as is may save some unnecessary rebuilds. ;-)

Ok, I have some patched ECLIB spkg somewhere around. Perhaps needs some more work though.

A followup: on my mac, perhaps because of various symbolic links, whenever I run "sage -b", I see a message like

```
warning: Replacing library search directory in linker command:
  "/Applications/sage_builds/sage-4.6/local/lib" -> "/Applications/sage/local/lib"
```
I can run "sage -b" three times in a row, and I see this message all three times.

This may be because of symbolic links: "/Applications/sage" is a link pointing to "/Applications/sage_builds/sage-4.6/".

Perhaps in setup.py, we should use os.path.realpath?  For example, 

```diff
diff -r cdc586ffbdfd setup.py

Of course. `distutils` reads the Python Makefile each time it is invoked by the Sage library's `setup()`; we do not (yet) patch that Makefile and `pyconfig,h`.
