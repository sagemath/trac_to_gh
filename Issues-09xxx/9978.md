The 'prereq' script in `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/base` is currently version 0.7. This does not check that the maths library `libm` exists. I thought that was pretty much a formality, but it is not on AIX, where the shared maths library `/usr/lib/libm.a` does not get installed by default. This may also be the case on other operating systems, including perhaps some cut-down Linux distributions, though I'm not aware of any system other than AIX where the maths library does not get installed on a basic installation of the operating system. 

```
-bash-4.1$ ls /usr/lib/libm*
/usr/lib/libmbx.a
```

The maths library is part of the `bos.adt` fileset. Hence a test for the maths library should be added. After installing `bos.adt`, so the maths library exists:

```
-bash-4.1$ ls /usr/lib/libm*
/usr/lib/libm.a       /usr/lib/libmbx.a     /usr/lib/libm_r.a     /usr/lib/libmsaa.a    /usr/lib/libmsaa_r.a
```

## Notes for reviewers
You will need to copy the `prereq-0.8.tar` from this ticket and the `prereq-0.8-install` script from #11070 to `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/base` For the purposes of reviewing this ticket, you only need to look at the changes to configure.ac. 

## Notes for the release manager
This ticket must be merged with #11070, which also has positive review. Each depends on the other. Some notes about the upgrade process are given on #11070

Here is some results when installed on my IBM RS/6000, which runs AIX 5.3. 

```
-bash-4.1$ uname
AIX
```

Here's the output after running "make" on the AIX system, which has the maths library installed, since the bos.adt fileset was installed. 

```
-bash-4.1$ uname 
AIX
-bash-4.1$ make

```

Then I removed the maths library, /usr/lib/libm.a.

```
-bash-4.1$ su
root's Password:
# mv /usr/lib/libm.a /usr/lib/foo
# exit
```

Then after running make, we see that the 'prereq' script exits with an error. 

```

Finally, I did manage to remember to restore my maths library!

-bash-4.1$

```
I did not actually run the code, especially on AIX, but trust you did
(both with and without libm installed). Reading it sounds very
reasonable; I am thus ready to give it a positive review.

Quick variant:

    # On AIX libm is not installed by default - strange as that might seem -
    # While we are it, bos.adt is likely to contain other useful things for Sage
    if test "x`uname`" = 'xAIX'
    then
       AC_MSG_NOTICE([On AIX, libm is contained in the bos.adt.libm fileset.]) 
       AC_MSG_NOTICE([Actually, we recommend to install the complete bos.adt fileset.]) 

Cheers,
				Nicolas
```

The patch has been changed to include Nicolas's revised wording on the error message that is generated.
