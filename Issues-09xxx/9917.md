When I'm building ecl-10.2.1 as part of Sage I get too warning messages from gcc. 

```
/export/home/drkirkby/sage-4.6.alpha0/spkg/build/ecl-10.2.1.p2/src/src/c/dpp.c: In function 'put_declaration':
/export/home/drkirkby/sage-4.6.alpha0/spkg/build/ecl-10.2.1.p2/src/src/c/dpp.c:678:5: warning: too few arguments for format
/export/home/drkirkby/sage-4.6.alpha0/spkg/build/ecl-10.2.1.p2/src/src/c/dpp.c:680:13: warning: too many arguments for format
```

Looking at line 678 of dpp.c, I see:

```
    fprintf(out, "\tif (ecl_unlikely(narg!=%d))");
```

So there's a %d, but what is associate with the %d? There should be an integer, but there is not one. So it seems to me gcc is right to complain there are too few arguments for format. 

Likewise, on line 680, I see:

```
    fprintf(out, "\t   FEwrong_num_arguments(MAKE_FIXNUM(%d));\n",
            nreq, function_code);
```
There we observe two arguments supplied, but only one %d is there. That does not make any sense to me. Both "nreq" and "function_code" are declared as integers, so should there not two %d's and not one. 

Again, it seems gcc is right to complain that. 

There are thousands of warning messages in Sage, but I'm a bit concerned about resolving those in ecl, as the ecl library being built has text relocation problems - see #9840

Perhaps temporarily fix this in Sage's 10.2.1 by patching it to the obvious:

```C
    fprintf(out, "\tif (ecl_unlikely(narg!=%d))", nreq);
```
and

```C
    fprintf(out, "\t   FEwrong_num_arguments(MAKE_FIXNUM(%d));\n",
            function_code);
```

(You **don't** have to report this upstream since it is already fixed.)

Now when this is compiled, the warnings messages have gone:

```
        gcc -I/export/home/drkirkby/sage-4.6.alpha0/spkg/build/ecl-10.2.1.p3/src/src/c -I/export/home/drkirkby/sage-4.6.alpha0/spkg/build/ecl-10.2.1.p3/src/build -I./ /export/home/drkirkby/sage-4.6.alpha0/spkg/build/ecl-10.2.1.p3/src/src/c/dpp.c  -I/export/home/drkirkby/sage-4.6.alpha0/local/include  -O2  -g  -Wall  -fPIC  -Dsun4sol2 -o dpp 
```

An updated package can be found at 

http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/patches/ecl-10.2.1.p3.spkg

This needs further testing, as I've only currently tested this on OpenSolaris, but I think it is as safe as a bank vault. Hence for now I've marked it "needs info" until such time as I can confirm it works fully on other systems.

I've checked this now on OpenSolaris, Solaris 10 on SPARC (t2). Linux (sage.math) and OS X (bsd.math). 

ECL installed ok on all of them. Maxima failed on OS X, but the failure is already known - see #8645. 

As such, I'm now marking this for review. I don't know whether fixing these compiler warnings will solve the problems on Solaris (I doubt it will), but its not a good idea to have code like it was before. 

Since this is already fixed upstream in their git repository, I've marked it as such.

Regarding

```

I've updated the patch file - I've no idea how I managed to make it empty before! 

There are of course several changes to the upstream code, but since the snapshot I took was an unstable release, I think it is wise to limit the changes to just what were causing a problem in Sage. 

I'm not sure if there is a later stable release available or not - I've found the version number at the top right of the ECL web site rarely agrees with the version number one can actually download. I think we probably have the latest stable release due to a comment made by Juanjo on the ECL mailing list in my response to my question about this matter. 

''Sage cannot rely on unstable releases, which is why I was slowly working on
another stable release -- unfortunately actual work got in the way.

Juanjo''

I've updated the .spkg at 

http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/patches/ecl-10.2.1.p3.spkg

Yes the line in ECL is rather funny. It's a bit like that ATLAS file `make_correct_shared.sh`, which seems to screw up making the shared libraries!
