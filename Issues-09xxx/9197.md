Reported by Dana Ernst - for instance, the cayley_table() of a group doesn't work in the notebook if you click 'Typeset'.  But that's not the only place that's a problem.  If there isn't a good latex() command, it should output repr() or something.  This isn't exactly graphics, but I'll put it in there for now.
