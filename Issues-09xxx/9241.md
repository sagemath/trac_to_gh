From this [sage-devel thread](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/189f3b30b183690a), it's clear that the Developer's Guide needs to explain how to write doctests. The goal of this ticket is to sort out what types of tests to describe, which are relevant to Sage, etc. Such a section or chapter should serve as a guide on how to write tests for the Sage library. Here are some information to get started on:
