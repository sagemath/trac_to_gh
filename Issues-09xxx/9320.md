Root numbers for elliptic curves are currently only implemented via Pari (pari(E).ellrootno()) and only over the rational numbers.

We (Tim Dokchitser's group at Sage Days 22) intend to add the possibility to compute local and global root numbers for elliptic curves over number fields.  A first patch may not fully implement the case of additive reduction over primes dividing 2 or 3.

Update: Attached is a first implementation which allows for instance:

```
sage: K.<a>=NumberField(x^4+2)
sage: E = EllipticCurve(K, [1, a, 0, 1+a, 0])
sage: E.root_number()
1
sage: E.root_number(K.ideal(a+1))
1
```

Note that the implementation needs the patches #9334 (Hilbert symbol) and #9684 ("dirty model") to be applied.

To prevent incorrect results in some cases as well as crashes, the tickets #9389 and #9417 need to be addressed.

Ticket #9334 has been merged, so this is now ready for review. Sadly it fails to apply, due to a trivial conflict with #11749. I've uploaded a rebased patch, and checked that all doctests in sage/schemes/elliptic_curves pass with this applied. 

However, some (trivial but tedious) work is needed fixing the ReST formatting of the docstrings -- the indentation is all over the place, and :: should only be used to introduce example code blocks.

It would be good if some expert of elliptic curve could provide correct doctests for the local root numbers at primes 2 and 3. Could you have a look, please ?

I suggest that a good source of examples would be elliptic curves over number fields where we know the associated modular form, since the root number at a bad prime should match the Atkin-Lehner eigenvalue.  (The alternative would be to compue a whole lot of examples with Magma, but that would make me uncomfortable;  nevertheless we should of course check that our results are compatible with Magma.)

There is no issue when the primes have multiplicative reduction, since then the root number is very easy being minus E.ap, i.e. depends only on whether the number of points on the reduction is p+1 or p-1 (of course "p" means Norm(p) in the number field case).  It's the case of additive reduction at primes dividing 2 or 3 which are harder.

Here is one taken from my thesis (see http://www.numdam.org/numdam-bin/search?h=nc&id=CM_1984__51_3_275_0&format=complete):

```
K.<i>=QuadraticField(-1)
E=EllipticCurve([1+i, 1+i, 0,i,0])
P2=K.ideal(i+i)
E.root_number(P2)
-1
```
which I checked with Magma.  The conductor here is `P2^2 * P41`.

Is this what you want?  How many examples do you need?


Tables of elliptic curves over number fields do exist, and were in fact one of the topics of last week's Curves and Automorphic Forms workshop in Arizona.

An example which is additive at 3:

```
sage: K.<r> = NumberField(x^2-x+1)
sage: E = EllipticCurve([r-1,r,1,r-1,-1])
sage: P3 = K.ideal(2*r-1)
sage: assert P3.is_prime() and P3.norm()==3
sage: assert E.has_additive_reduction(P3)
sage: assert P.root_number(P3)==1 ## not implemented
```
Here the value is taken from page 115 of my thesis, and agrees with Magma's value.

For additional testing we could put in an 'algorithm' parameter which could be 'magma' and then (of course) only work when Magma is installed, so you could have optional doctests conditional on Magma of the form

```
assert E.root_number(P) == E.root_number(P, algorithm='magma')
```

I had a quick look at this and there are indeed major issues with the local root number at places above 2 when the reduction is additive, potentially good. That is in the function `_root_number_local_2` in `ell_number_field.py`.

With the current commit above we get an error for

```
sage: K.<i> = QuadraticField(-1)
sage: E = EllipticCurve([1+i, 1+i, 0, i, 0])
sage: P2 = K.ideal(1+i)
sage: E.root_number(P2)
```

because line 1966 tries to create and extension with a reducible polynomial `K2 = K.extension(t**2+E.a2()*t+E.a4(), 'a2')`. I guess - but it would take me some time to read the sources - that K2 should just be K in this case.

However there are other issues. For instance
  
```
sage: E = EllipticCurve([1+i,0,0,0,i])
sage: E._root_number_local_2(P2)
```

goes "bang".

I would think the code without the very bad case at places above 2 is ok and that could already go in. So I see two possible futures for this ticket:

1. Someone fixes these issues above 2 or

2. We raise an `NotImplementedError` if the reduction is additive and potentially good at a place above 2 and open a new ticket for fixing the problem.

I can help with 2), but I won't have time to do 1). But maybe there is someone out there who would.

After merging with 8.6.beta1 I ran the tests, and there is one failure in line 2294 of ell_number_field where a local root number at a ramified prime above 2 where there is additive reduction is computed incorrectly.

I checked with Magma that -1 is the correct value.  This curve is http://beta.lmfdb.org/EllipticCurve/2.0.4.1/164.2/a/2 and has associated Bianchi newform http://beta.lmfdb.org/ModularForm/GL2/ImaginaryQuadratic/2.0.4.1/164.2/a/ where you can see that the Atkin-Lehner eigenvalue at 1+i is -1, giving a second independent evaluation.
