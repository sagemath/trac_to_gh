Right now, this fails:

```
line3d(( (0,0,0), (1,2,3) ))
```

since the copy of the input data is not converted to a list.  This is an easy fix.

This doesn't come up if I apply either one of the patches on its own.

I'll leave this as positive review until the release manager decides what order to merge these in, though - wouldn't want to overstep his prerogative :)  then he can mark whichever one needs work thus.
