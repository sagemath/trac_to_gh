This addresses a bug that was reported here:

http://groups.google.com/group/sage-combinat-devel/msg/252fd7fa0e297214

The `__call__` method of a Weyl Character ring, when `style="coroots"` is specified, tries to interpret the arguments as the coroots of a weight; that weight
is then the actual argument. However this is not appropriate if the argument is
not a tuple. Therefore this should be tested.

The patch implements the test.
