Hmmm..... If ``cycle`` is a boolean, it means it is equal to True (the method called returns "True", or a certificate that it is not true otherwise -- a graph object). I have already seen this method to return wrong answers (and this is fixed in #9420), but the code *IS* deterministic and in this case I do not understand why you would not get an error at the previous docstring :

```
            sage: g.is_even_hole_free()      
            True
```

which uses the same graph. Of course, this doctest is another one of the kind I'm trying to get rid off these days : it theoretically fails with a probability of 1/9999999999999999.... which means that it "can happen"... But once again, this would mean an error at the previous docstring too `O_o`

if you are finding yourself on one of the machines on which you have seen it failing, could you give this a try ?

```
    sage: all( isinstance(graphs.RandomBipartite(10, 10, .5).is_even_hole_free(certificate = True), "Graph") for i in range(10000) )

Hmmm.... It looks like it's not --so-- rare O_o

```
sage: sum( not isinstance(graphs.RandomBipartite(10, 10, .5).is_even_hole_free(certificate = True), Graph) for i in range(10000) )
96
```

something like 1%...`:-/`

And with this :

```
sage: t = lambda x: Graph(x).is_forest() or isinstance(x.is_even_hole_free(certificate = True), Graph)
sage: sum( not t(graphs.RandomBipartite(10, 10, .5)) for i in range(10000) )
111
```

Which means it comes from .... the bug in the method subgraph_search, and not from the theoretical probability `:-/`

With the patch applied :

```
sage: sage: t = lambda x: Graph(x).is_forest() or isinstance(x.is_even_hole_free(certificate = True), Graph)
sage: sage: sum( not t(graphs.RandomBipartite(10, 10, .5)) for i in range(10000) )
0
```

Which **relieved** me. I should post a patch to add this is_forest condition anyway. Can I put it on this ticket ?

First, you are right, then it was also to avoid having a docstring returning nothing on success, and returning "Error" on failure... It is just meant to say "this section has been run", and check that it was not bypassed for some reason.. Do you prefer it without this part ?

If so, tell me and I update it.

But I consider it a very pertinent information that Sage developpers have fun writing docstring, and the user may like to know it `:-D`

Yes, but if the message "Error" is printed and the docstring doesn't expect it, an error will reported, won't it ? `O_o`

In case of failure, this piece of code will print :

Error !
Everything is fine !

While the code only expects to find "Everything is fine !".

Dima and Nathann, could you look into this?  If it's a new problem, please open a new 4.6 blocker with this in the description.

gives 20 or so failures.  Could you check your patches against this or a similar statistical diagnostic?

Well, as you had taken the time to write this testing function, I tested it against the patches (with n = 10 000, as I was working on a sheet of paper at the same time and did not mind forgetting it for several minutes `:-D`) :

With #9422 applied :

```python
sage: runner(10000)
0
```

With no patch applied, but with 

```python
g = graphs.RandomBipartite(10, 10, .5)
```
replaced by 

```python
g = Graph(graphs.RandomBipartite(10, 10, .5))
```

in your code (which is exactly what the docstring in #10067 does) :

```python
sage: runner(10000)
0
```

Be sure that this is not just a statistical proof : #9422 "disconnects" the call to the ``is_subgraph`` command, so there is really no path left leading to this exception from BipartiteGraph !

Nathann

P.S. : Thank you for this ``#!python`` trick ! Very nice `;-)`
