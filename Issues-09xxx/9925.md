If it's feasible to create a patch now, I can merge it into 4.6.alpha1, while I wait for a response to a build error at #4000. 

Edward, could you add yourself to the [account name-real name map](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/wiki/WikiStart#AccountNamesmappedtoRealNames)?

Oops.  You're right.  I confused this with a different error.  I got error above only on sage.math and cicero.skynet (x86-Linux-pentium4-fc) and it's not reproducible.

I apologize for the noise.  Does anyone know why this test might be "flaky"?

Hmmm..... If ``cycle`` is a boolean, it means it is equal to True (the method called returns "True", or a certificate that it is not true otherwise -- a graph object). I have already seen this method to return wrong answers (and this is fixed in #9420), but the code *IS* deterministic and in this case I do not understand why you would not get an error at the previous docstring :

```
            sage: g.is_even_hole_free()      
            True
```

which uses the same graph. Of course, this doctest is another one of the kind I'm trying to get rid off these days : it theoretically fails with a probability of 1/9999999999999999.... which means that it "can happen"... But once again, this would mean an error at the previous docstring too `O_o`

if you are finding yourself on one of the machines on which you have seen it failing, could you give this a try ?

```
    sage: all( isinstance(graphs.RandomBipartite(10, 10, .5).is_even_hole_free(certificate = True), "Graph") for i in range(10000) )

Hmmm.... It looks like it's not --so-- rare O_o

```
sage: sum( not isinstance(graphs.RandomBipartite(10, 10, .5).is_even_hole_free(certificate = True), Graph) for i in range(10000) )
96
```

something like 1%...`:-/`

And with this :

```
sage: t = lambda x: Graph(x).is_forest() or isinstance(x.is_even_hole_free(certificate = True), Graph)
sage: sum( not t(graphs.RandomBipartite(10, 10, .5)) for i in range(10000) )
111
```

Which means it comes from .... the bug in the method subgraph_search, and not from the theoretical probability `:-/`

With the patch applied :

```
sage: sage: t = lambda x: Graph(x).is_forest() or isinstance(x.is_even_hole_free(certificate = True), Graph)
sage: sage: sum( not t(graphs.RandomBipartite(10, 10, .5)) for i in range(10000) )
0
```

Which **relieved** me. I should post a patch to add this is_forest condition anyway. Can I put it on this ticket ?

There is now one ticket to be reviewed here, and the patch Dima requested is also waiting for review at #9930 (though it depends on #9420 too)..

Yes, but if the message "Error" is printed and the docstring doesn't expect it, an error will reported, won't it ? `O_o`

In case of failure, this piece of code will print :

Error !
Everything is fine !

While the code only expects to find "Everything is fine !".

I don't have time to apply the patches, but without them, the code:

```python
def example(verbose=False):
    try:
        g = graphs.RandomBipartite(10, 10, .5)
        g.is_even_hole_free() and not g.is_forest()
        if not g.is_forest():
            cycle = g.is_even_hole_free(certificate = True)
            if cycle.order() % 2 == 1:
                print "Error !"
            if not cycle.is_isomorphic(graphs.CycleGraph(cycle.order())):
                print "Error !"
        error = False
    except RuntimeError as exc:
        error = True
        if verbose:
            print exc
    return error

def runner(n=1000):
    fail = 0
    for i in xrange(n):
        fail += example()
    return fail

runner()
```
gives 20 or so failures.  Could you check your patches against this or a similar statistical diagnostic?

Well, as you had taken the time to write this testing function, I tested it against the patches (with n = 10 000, as I was working on a sheet of paper at the same time and did not mind forgetting it for several minutes `:-D`) :

With #9422 applied :

```python
sage: runner(10000)
0
```

With no patch applied, but with 

```python
g = graphs.RandomBipartite(10, 10, .5)
```
replaced by 

```python
g = Graph(graphs.RandomBipartite(10, 10, .5))
```

in your code (which is exactly what the docstring in #10067 does) :

```python
sage: runner(10000)
0
```

Be sure that this is not just a statistical proof : #9422 "disconnects" the call to the ``is_subgraph`` command, so there is really no path left leading to this exception from BipartiteGraph !

Nathann

P.S. : Thank you for this ``#!python`` trick ! Very nice `;-)`
