According to http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/conventions.html#docstring-markup-with-rest-and-sphinx it should be `EXAMPLES:` instead of `EXAMPLE::`.

It's enough to put only 3 dots between `<BLANKLINE>` and `System` but this is okay as well.

If an "EXAMPLES" block just has one example, then it is OK to drop the S.  And if there is no prose before the test, then a double-colon can be used to indicate verbatim text next.

There are excess ... but they cause no harm.  This ticket looks good to me.  Am I missing something?  It looks ready for a positive review to me.

I am working on this as a high-priority ticket for Bug Days 32.

Actually, `mpoly_all()` needs work, since it is apparently unable to interrupt (e.g.) Mathematica a second time.

On redhawk, where `/home` still isn't mounted, Mathematica is installed but fails to startup (prompting the user), such that I get:

```sh
leif@redhawk:/$ time sage -c "from sage.tests.benchmark import mpoly_all; mpoly_all()" 



Compute (x_0 + ... + x_99) * (x_100 + ... + x_200) over Rational Field (use singular for Sage mult.)
  System      min         avg         max         trials          cpu or wall

```
which does not terminate.

What is this doctest supposed to "test" at all?

The output is random, so it doesn't really test anything, except perhaps which external programs are installed, but that's nothing subject to a doctest, so IMHO this ticket should either be closed as invalid, or the "doctest" (i.e., the example) should be marked `# not tested`, at least until `mpoly_all()` got fixed.
