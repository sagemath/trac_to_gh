```
When we build new or updated Sage packages (spkgs), `SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage-pkg` runs a few checks for common problems.  For example,

```sh
$ sage -pkg foo/
Creating Sage package foo/
Warning: no version number detected

Created package foo.spkg.

    NAME: foo
 VERSION:
    SIZE: 17.8M
 HG REPO: Good
SPKG.txt: Good

Please test this package using
[...]
```

But we could add several new, more detailed tests for `spkg-install`, etc.  Or put them in a `sage-spkg-{check,checker,lint}` script.

Possibilities, some of which could simply give warnings or reminders:

* Check for `spkg-check` and `spkg-install` and that they're executable.
* Check the first line of scripts for `#!/usr/bin/env` (cf. #9597).
* Check for an unfinished Mercurial patch queue.
* Check for the presence of `set -e`.
* Check for the presence of $MAKE and other important variables.
* Check for Python scripts and whether Python is a dependency in `spkg/standard/deps` (cf. #9435, #9507).

I'm sure there are others!

I've created a (vaguely) related ticket:

  *Update and extend "SPKG Tracking" Wiki page*, #9626.

(`sage-pkg` could spit out some reminder...)

We could also formalize/code some aspects of `SPKG.txt`'s *Special Update/Build Instructions*, e.g. in (a) new (optional) script(s) like `spkg-cleanup-upstream` (deleting parts not needed by Sage, upstream repo files, etc.), contained in the spkg itself, and perhaps run automatically.

Some upstream managers also tend to copy files without preserving mtime, so we could more or less automatically check for files like `configure`, make sure they are newer than their sources, and if not, touch them before preparing the spkg.

The application of patches to the upstream source tree (i.e. currently *copying of patched files*) could also be "normalized", allowing to perform some spkg sanity checks automatically, too, and to simplify `spkg-install`s.

Good question.  I usually use `sage -spkg`, an alias of `sage -pkg`.

> * In a perfect world, the reviewer(s) would do this job (i.e. look at the code e.g., too, not just try to install a new package and then give positive review, or sometimes the other way around).

Just a quick thought:  We could also run the spkg checks, or a subset of them, during installation.

Good idea

Yes.

Yes

William will not have that. He is very against the use of set -e. 

> * Check for the presence of $MAKE and other important variables.

What's important in one package is not in another. That might be difficult to do. 

> * Check for Python scripts and whether Python is a dependency in `spkg/standard/deps` (cf. #9435, #9507).

If the package is called foobar-x.y.z, then SPKG.txt should have the string foobar.x.y.z somewhere in it. Many times commits get made, with no entry in SPKG.txt

One other thing, make sure all the required sections from SPKG.txt exist. i.e. none are missing. Even if there are no special build instructions, the section should exist and simply say "none". 

One could also check that entries in SPKG.txt have something in each section. But this could get a lot of work.
