I'll try to add the missing docstrings.

I was intentionally using `A_k` and not `A^{d-k}` because this patch implements the Chow homology and not the cohomology. I'm not sure to which extend they are the same over singular/noncompact varieties over ZZ.

I'm not entirely happy with the output either. But printing all the cones (even if we abbreviate them) will very quickly produce multi-line output. Right now, the output is essentially in a random basis corresponding to `cycle.parent().degree()`. 

```
sage: cycle = X.Chow_group().gen(1)
sage: cycle
The Chow cycle (0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0)
sage: cycle.parent().degree()
(Z, Z x Z, Z x Z, Z)
sage: cycle.lift()
(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)
```
For all practical purposes, the user should use `lift()` to get the coefficients of the cones in the given order `flatten(toric_variety.fan().cones())`. Would printing

```
Chow cycle ((0,), (1, 0), (0, 0), (0,))
```
make you more happy? Note that some methods (in particular, intersection with a divisor) need to change the cycle within its Chow class, so even "simple" cycles will  produce output where all coefficients are turned on. This is part of why I don't want to print the cone information explicitly.

OK, let's stick to A_k.

```
Chow cycle ((0,), (1, 0), (0, 0), (0,))
```
is a bit ugly ;-) Maybe to have it as a vector but separate degrees something like this may work:

```
Chow cycle (0 | 1, 0 | 0, 0 | 0)
```

My concern is that if I create the Chow cycle corresponding to a cone generated by rays 2 and 5, it would be nice to see it clearly in the output, say

```
Chow cycle {2, 5}
```
with combinations printed as

```
Chow cycle 2*{2, 5} - 7*{1, 2, 3}
```
But to have it nicely will require storing the original cone combination, since lift algorithm from a quotient element will involve a lot of cones, as you pointed out. I don't know if it worths the benefits. But it would be nice at least to have some markers between degrees.

I've changed the printing of Chow cycles to the following:

sage: A = X.Chow_group()
sage: A.degree()
(Z, C7, Z^5 x C2 x C2, Z)

I am a bit confused by the first example:

```
sage: A.degree()
(Z, C7, Z^5 x C2 x C2, Z)
sage: a = sum( A.gen(i) * (i+1) for i in range(0,A.ngens()) )   # an element of A
sage: a
( 3 | 1 mod 7 | 0 mod 2, 1 mod 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 | 9 )
```
with explanation "The Chow group elements are printed as ( a0 | a1 mod 7 | a2 mod 2, a3 mod 2, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8 | a9 ), which denotes the element of the Chow group in the same basis as A.degree()."

`A.degree()` shows the third component as `Z^5 x C2 x C2`, yet it seems that elements put cyclic groups first, or maybe it is the reverse order (which would matter for several cyclic groups of different degrees).

Here it is, I called the fan Sigma rather than Delta:

**Proposition** The Chow group A_k_(X) of an arbitrary toric variety X = X(Sigma) is generated by the classes of the orbit closures V(sigma) of the cones of dimension n-k of Sigma.

So yes, the patch does implement the "honest Chow group" with the exception that arbitrary subvarieties cannot be translated into their Chow cycles (I think).

1. The discussed above fact that this patch implement the full Chow group should be reflected in module level documentation.
   1. Documentation from `ChowCycle.__init__` should be moved to the class docstring, otherwise it is invisible.
   2. Behaviour of `check=False` is strange for it: usually such an option omits validity checks assuming that user will take care of it. Here it seems to allow a different form of input. Is it inherited from the base class? If so, maybe it should be fixed there...
   3. Line 170 misses the second ":" in the end.
   4. The first words of some docstrings have extra s'es, like "Returns" and "Intersects".

A1. The discussed above fact that this patch implement the full Chow group should be reflected in module level documentation.

    OK


A2. Documentation from `ChowCycle.__init__` should be moved to the class docstring, otherwise it is invisible.

    I've added a note to the `ChowCycle` class documentation that you are not supposed to manually construct them. The `__init__` docstring is hidden on purpose.


A3. Behaviour of check=False is strange for it: usually such an option omits validity checks assuming that user will take care of it. Here it seems to allow a different form of input. Is it inherited from the base class? If so, maybe it should be fixed there...

    Yes, it is inherited from `FGP_Element`. I tried to fix it there, but then I ended up trying to rewrite it for the new coercion model. And that attempt was quite unsuccessful, all of sage.modules is interrelated and you can't just change one class...


A4. Line 170 misses the second `":"` in the end.

    OK


A5. The first words of some docstrings have extra `s`'es, like "Returns" and "Intersects".

    OK


A6. It would be nice if the documentation and example for `count_points` were expanded/clarified a little bit more. The  phrase `"integral over the dual cohomology class"` does not make it clear what is the integrand and to what the cohomology class is dual. Is it the Chow cycle in both cases? The example starts with a divisor and then integrates the square of this divisor and counts points on the intersection of the Chow cycle of this divisor with the original divisor. How about starting with some Chow cycle with non-zero point count and then showing how to get a corresponding cohomology class and integrate it?

    There is no easy way to get the Poincare dual (In fact, it exists only if the variety is smooth). I've clarified the example a bit.


A7. For `intersect_with_divisor` it would be nice to give a reference to the used algorithm (Fulton p.97?). I think also that `intersection_with_divisor` would be a better name, since the function returns the intersection rather than updates the original cycle. (I do realize now that the same consideration should have been applied to some methods that I have added...) By the way, this function has no input/output description. And perhaps `i = _gamma.pop()` does the same thing as `i = iter(I_gamma).next()` in a little cleaner fashion. (It does alter the set, but it is not used anyway.) What exactly is tested by the long test with many zeros in this function? This function says that divisor must be Cartier, but it is not checked, is it intended?  Am I right that it actually makes sense to use it with Q-Cartier divisors if the Chow group is also rational?

    I renamed it to `intersection_with_divisor()` and expanded on the documentation which should now answer your questions...


    In principle you are right with the Q-Cartier divisors, but in practice this will not work because multiplication QQ * QQ-Chow cycle is broken. The problem is that the parent does not adhere to the new coercion model. I could hack around it, but then this should really be fixed elsewhere.


A8. `Chow_cycle` method of toric divisors does not have a doctest and input/output description.

    OK


A9. Line 394 misses closing quotes after True.

    OK


B1. It is probably worth mentioning what is the point of A(Cone(cone)) after A(cone). I actually didn't even know that Cone(cone) works! Fortunately, it works as expected ;-)

    OK

In `_rational_equivalence_relations` I find it very difficult to understand the LaTeX expression, which does not get typeset in the documentation (since it is a private method), especially since it does not explain what is `"! over ="`, what is `n_{\rho, \sigma}`, and how d, k, n, and p are related (I guess pairs of them are  equal). I think that this description should be moved to some  visible place (module documentation or relation_gens?) and there should be a reference to where it was taken from.

    I moved it to `relation_gens` and added more explanations.


B3. What is the purpose of the super call in `__eq__` for Chow groups? Do we want anything but a Chow group equal to a Chow group?

    Now it only returns `self is other`.


B4. I think that `_cone_to_V` would be more efficient if it was implemented via a dictionary. I don't know how significant such a speed up will be in real computations, but I think it is worthwhile to do this change.

    Its only constructing a unit vector. Surely the run time for intersection computations is dominated by the matrix normal form computations and not the construction of unit vectors?

    I tried it but couldn't get it to work. The base `FGP_Module` has no provision to explicitly set the generators, and bad things happen if they are different from the internal normal form of the basis matrix.


B7. For `relation_gens` wouldn't it be more natural to return elements of the covering module, i.e. lifts of the current output?

    You can do that with `A.relations().gens()`. I added a note to `relation_gens`.


B8. Line 979: you meant `== QQ`.
 
    Yes, fixed.


B9. Would it make sense to derive `ChowGroup_degree_class` from some kind of a group rather than `SageObject`?

    Ideally they would be some other parents with coercions into the full (mixed-degree) Chow group. But then thats a lot of work for very little benefit. Not to mention that the base `FGP_Module` does not adhere to the new coercion model, so it'll be hackisch...

Replying to [@vbraun](#comment:25):

A3. OK, let's hope it will get fixed eventually...

A6. Am I right that it is integral OF the dual cohomology class, not OVER? That's how I interpret `integrate` method of toric varieties. Also it seems that we need completeness in addition to smoothness.

A7. Let it be fixed elsewhere!

B9. Ok, let it be as is.

Fresh comments:

1. Why `get_degree` and not just `degree` for Chow cycles?
2. What will `cohomology_class` of a Chow cycle produce in the case when there is no Poincare duality? I think this should be either explained in the documentation, or an exception should be raised varieties which are not smooth and complete.

I have done some documentation prettification, feel free to fold it into your patch, if is still applies to your current version.

I am about to create a new ticket whose purpose is to implement the new parent and coercion framework not only for the base class `sage.modules.module.Module`, but also for the most derived classes. In that regard, it goes beyond what is done in the patches here.

My to-be-created ticket will leave the `FGP_*` stuff almost unchanged. I suggest to include that to-be-created ticket as a new dependency (mentioning it in #9604 as well), so that the ticket here can concentrate on its "real" purpose, which is not coercion but toric Chow group.

Then I would also provide a replacement of trac_9713_toric_chow_group.patch relative to the to-be-created ticket.

A few words on trac_9713_toric_chow_group.patch: The `element_class` attribute of Parent is in fact a *lazy* attribute, that takes another attribute `Element` and mixes it with some category stuff before it turns `element_class` into an actual attribute. Hence, one should *not* directly set `element_class` (which is done in the patch), but should provide an attribute `Element` instead.

My to-be-created patch would actually preserve the `_element_class` (leading underscore) method, since it chooses the right element class and is already implemented for all sub-classes. But I would call it in the `__init__` method of the base class `sage.modules.module.Module` and assign its output to the `Element` attribute. In that way, it is most easy to implement the lazy `element_class` (no leading underscore) attribute as one is supposed to.

Also, the `__call__` method of fgp morphisms should probably be replaces by `_call_`, `_call_with_args` and perhaps `pushforward` (likely depending on #10496).


Best regards, Simon

So, perhaps I should try to upgrade to sage-4.6.1.alpha3 first.

Is there an easy way to use `sage -upgrade` for a development version?

Thanks, it did kind of work. At some point the process got stuck, but when I then did `make` in `SAGE_ROOT`, the upgrade did succeed (at least so it seems).

The patches apply. I don't know if I will be able to do reviewing any time soon, since currently I only have remote access to my computer via rather slow internet (237 kB/s).

<div id="comment:48" align="right">comment:48</div>

I applied the patches on top of `sage-4.6.1.alpha3`, and the good news is that all tests pass.

However, I have some criticism concerning `trac_9713_fix_fg_pid.patch`.

In several cases I see things like

```
        return self.parent().Element(self.parent(), self._x - other._x)
```

That's not how the attribute `Element` is supposed to be used. As far as I know, the story is like this:

* One provides an attribute `Element`, which is supposed to be a class.

* `Parent.element_class` is a so-called lazy attribute. That's to say, if one does `self.element_class` then the *method* `self.element_class()` is called, which computes a *new* class out of `self.Element` and `self.category()`, assigns this new class to an actual (not lazy) attribute `self.element_class`, and returns that new class.

* When one requests `self.element_class` is called the next time then it is already a usual attribute, which is of course much faster than calling a method.

Hence, you should define `self.Element`. But then you should do

```
        P = self.parent()
        return P.element_class(P, self._x - other._x) 
```
since `P.element_class` (in contrast to `P.Element`) also inherits stuff from the category. Note that additionally the code snipped spares a little time compared with your patch since `self.parent()` is called only once instead of twice.

As I mentioned, my bandwith is a bit restricted at the moment. So, this post might be incomplete, it is just what I found by a little reading of the patch.

Hi Volker and Andrey!

Replying to [@vbraun](#comment:38):
> I've renamed `element_class` -> `Element` as per Simon's comment, thanks!

As I've pointed out in my previous post, one should *define* `self.Element`, but then the actual element class is `self.element_class`. This is taken care of in my reviewer patch, `trac_9713_fix_fg_pid_reviewer.patch`. Some doctests needed to be modified accordingly. The reviewer patch also raises the doctest coverage of `sage.modules.fg_pid` to 100% (some indirect tests had not been marked as such).

> Maybe Simon would be interested in reviewing the first two patches (`trac_9713_fix_cardinality.patch`, `trac_9713_fix_fg_pid.patch`) and Andrey the ` trac_9713_toric_chow_group.patch`?

I give `trac_9713_fix_cardinality.patch` and `trac_9713_fix_fg_pid.patch` (modulo my reviewer patch) a positive review. Of course, we all know that it does not provide a full implementation of the new parent and coercion model for modules; after all, that is not the purpose of this ticket. But apparently it is enough for implementing the toric chow group. So, I suggest to build a full implementation of coercion for modules on top of these patches.

> Then we should make it into Sage-4.6.2...

My job is done. Andrey, your turn... :)

Simon, thanks a lot for your help!

Volker, shouldn't variety be complete for Poincare duality in `cohomology_class`?

In its documentation "will be not always match intersection numbers." should be "will not always match intersection numbers." (or "may not match intersection numbers.")

Otherwise tests pass and all issues above seem to be resolved!
