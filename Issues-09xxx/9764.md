This ticket is a fork from #9400.

* implement hashing for number field ideals that isn't a stupid string repr, hence vastly faster 

* make number field ideals *not* print in reduced form; this will look uglier, but is massively faster and more sensible for any real applications, as people learned constantly at sage days 22.
