Introspection is failing on polynomial rings:

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[] 
sage: R.su<tab> 
R.sum                               R.summation 
R.summation_from_element_class_add 
sage: R.sum? 
Object `R.sum` not found. 
sage: R.sum() 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last) 
```

This is because polynomial rings do not yet set their category properly:

```
sage: QQ[x]._test_category()
------------------------------------------------------------
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AssertionError: category of self improperly initialized
```

See http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/4780192a11a8b591 for more discussion.

Many other rings are not properly initialised as well. The aim of this ticket is to change that.

**Apply** [attachment:9138_flat.patch] (rebased on top of #9958, but will still apply with fuzz 2 otherwise).

See #11900 for a follow-up fixing some speed regressions.

Indeed. This should have ringed a bell to me!

Since I have already recycled this ticket to "Categories for
polynomial ring", I leave the two tickets as is. Once this ticket will
be closed, it should be possible to close #8613 as well.

<a id='comment:4'></a>This ticket is just about a single kind of parent classes. Rather than going through a long list of parent classes one by one and inserting the missing pieces: Wouldn't it be a more thorough approach to provide a *default* implementation for the attributes needed in the category framework, in cases where it makes sense? 

Here is an example:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: 'element_class' in dir(R)
True
sage: hasattr(R,'element_class')
False
```

If I am not mistaken, "element_class" should be implemented by providing the attribute "Element". 

But is there a reason why element_class is a dynamic meta-class and not a regular method? Since any parent class has a "an_element" method, it seems to me that the following default implementation makes sense (and it solves the problem in my example above):

```
    def element_class(self):
        try:
            return self.Element
        except AttributeError:
            return self.an_element().__class__
```

It seems to me that providing reasonable default implementations would, on the long run, be easier than going through any single parent class. But certainly other people know more about the "how-to" of categories.

Sorry, I just noticed that "element_class" is not a method at all: I assumed that it should be used like `R.element_class()`, but sadly it is `R.element_class` without calling the attribute. So, one attribute (element_class) is implemented by providing another attribute (Element).

Anyway, if there shall be a default implementation for element_class then unfortunately it must be in `__getattr__`.

<a id='comment:8'></a>Since #9944 almost has a positive review but does not entirely fix the bug reported here, I'm posting my patch here, building on top of that.

Examples:

With the patches from #9944:

```
sage: QQ['x'].category()        # why not additionally an algebra?
Category of euclidean domains
sage: QQ['x','y'].category()    # why not an algebra?
Category of commutative rings
sage: SteenrodAlgebra(2)['x'].category()  # this is wrong
Category of commutative rings
sage: QQ['x','y'].sum([1,1])
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: 'sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_libsingular.MPolynomialRing_libsingular' object has no attribute 'sum'
```

Adding my (not yet submitted) patch, I get:

```
sage: QQ['x'].category()
Join of Category of euclidean domains and Category of commutative algebras over Rational Field
sage: QQ['x','y'].category()
Category of commutative algebras over Rational Field
sage: SteenrodAlgebra(2)['x'].category()
Category of algebras over mod 2 Steenrod algebra
sage: QQ['x','y'].sum([1,1])
2
```

So, I think the bug reported here is fixed. For me, all doctests pass.

Depends on #9944

You are right, things like this should be considered. However, I wonder where a slow-down might come from.

No, I wasn't testing the performance. Aparently I work in cycles: Recently I had several patches that considerably increased performance, and perhaps I am now in a slow mood again...

<a id='comment:12'></a>Here are the test results:

sage: R.<x,y> = QQ['t'][]
sage: timeit('(2*x-1)^2+5')

```

With the patches from #9944:

```

sage: R.<x,y> = QQ['t'][]
sage: timeit('(2*x-1)^2+5')

```

With the patches from #9944 and the patch from here:

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: timeit('(2*x-1)^2+5')
625 loops, best of 3: 25.7 Âµs per loop

sage: timeit('(2*x-1)^2+5')
625 loops, best of 3: 115 Âµs per loop
sage: R.<x> = QQ['t'][]
sage: timeit('(2*x-1)^2+5')
625 loops, best of 3: 125 Âµs per loop
sage: R.<x,y> = ZZ[]

625 loops, best of 3: 31 Âµs per loop

625 loops, best of 3: 25.1 Âµs per loop
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ['t'][]
sage: timeit('(2*x-1)^2+5')
625 loops, best of 3: 256 Âµs per loop
```

Note, however, that the numbers arent't very stable

```
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: timeit('(2*x-1)^2+5')
625 loops, best of 3: 20.9 Âµs per loop
sage: timeit('(2*x-1)^2+5')
625 loops, best of 3: 20.8 Âµs per loop
sage: timeit('(2*x-1)^2+5')
625 loops, best of 3: 22.6 Âµs per loop
sage: timeit('(2*x-1)^2+5')
625 loops, best of 3: 37.9 Âµs per loop
sage: timeit('(2*x-1)^2+5')
625 loops, best of 3: 15.4 Âµs per loop
```

But there is a tendency: Things tend to be slower, both with #9944 and with my patch.

So, it should be worth while to analyse the arithmetic with prun.

So, the mro of the rings becomes much longer. Could it be that, as a consequence, it takes longer to find common and frequently used methods such as `R.parent()` and `R.base_ring()`?

In other words, there is a mild deceleration in the univariate case and a mild (and in one case considerable) *acceleration* in the multivariate case.

I don't understand why. But perhaps a reviewer has an idea, and can also state his or her opinion how bad the deceleration is compared with the acceleration?

<a id='comment:19'></a>The patch is rebased again.

Note that meanwhile #9944 does not mean a slow down but a speed up! The patch from here, unfortunately, makes things slightly slower, again. But compared with unpatched Sage, it is not significantly slower in any case, but still much faster in some cases (and in two cases even faster than with #9944 alone).

Here are the latest timings.

Unpatched:

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: timeit('(2*x-1)^2+5', number=10^4)
10000 loops, best of 3: 23.4 µs per loop

10000 loops, best of 3: 13 µs per loop
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: timeit('(2*x-1)^2+5', number=10^4)
10000 loops, best of 3: 16.6 µs per loop
sage: R.<x,y> = GF(3)[]
sage: timeit('(2*x-1)^2+5', number=10^4)
10000 loops, best of 3: 10.8 µs per loop
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ['t'][]
sage: timeit('(2*x-1)^2+5', number=10^4)
10000 loops, best of 3: 238 µs per loop
sage: R.<x,y> = Qp(3)[]

sage: timeit('(2*x-1)^2+5', number=10^4)
10000 loops, best of 3: 1.06 ms per loop
```

With #9944 and #9138:

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: timeit('(2*x-1)^2+5', number=10^4)
10000 loops, best of 3: 8.95 µs per loop

10000 loops, best of 3: 421 µs per loop
sage: R.<x> = Qp(3)[]
sage: timeit('(2*x-1)^2+5', number=10^4)
10000 loops, best of 3: 1.1 ms per loop
```

So, I hope it can be reviewed.

For the patch bot:

Depends on #9944

<a id='comment:21'></a>I think now we are ready for review.

Long tests passed for me.

By the way, the long tests made me fix another bug. Namely, in the `__setstate__` method of `CategoryObject`, the existing category was overridden by the value found in the pickle. If you do so for the ration field, than afterwards its category is not the category of quotient fields but of rings. Result: The pickle jar broke.

Solution: If the category in the pickle is None, then `self._category` will be preserved. Otherwise, it will be the join of `self._category` (if not None) with the category found in the pickle.

I don't know whether you agree with the second part of that solution. But I think the first part should be clear.

Also, I added some `TestSuite` tests for various flavours of polynomial rings.

For the patch bot:

Depends on #9944

For the record: this *might* be intentional. The coercion protocle
does specify that the arithmetic operation may return None
under certain circumstances to state that, after all, they can't
handle that operation, and some other approach should be tried.

OK, but really just for the record -- because I did not change it. Instead, I test what `_lmul_` does, and if it returns None then it will not be used in the base ring conversion.

<a id='comment:31'></a>I just found that the problem with `modulus` is an excellent use case for the improved cached methods provided by #11115!

Namely, instead of caching the modulus in a Python attribute `__modulus` and have `self.modulus()` return `self.__modulus`, I define `self.modulus()` as a cached method -- and that is a lot faster:

With the patches:

```
sage: B.<t> = PolynomialRing(Integers(125))
sage: R = monsky_washnitzer.SpecialCubicQuotientRing(t^3 - t + B(1/4))
sage: P = R.poly_ring()
sage: timeit('P.modulus()',number=10^6)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 226 ns per loop
sage: x, T = R.gens()
sage: timeit('x*T')
625 loops, best of 3: 234 Âµs per loop
```

Without the patches (and without the quick cached methods):

```
sage: B.<t> = PolynomialRing(Integers(125))
sage: R = monsky_washnitzer.SpecialCubicQuotientRing(t^3 - t + B(1/4))
sage: P = R.poly_ring()
sage: timeit('P.modulus()',number=10^6)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 647 ns per loop
sage: x, T = R.gens()
sage: timeit('x*T')
625 loops, best of 3: 495 Âµs per loop
```

So, the slow-down turned into a speed-up. I don't know if the doc tests will all pass, but I put it as "needs review".

Depends on #9944 #11115 #9976

<a id='comment:33'></a>It could actually be that I there is no regression in Monsky-Washnitzer at all.

I just took the tests from sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/monsky_washnitzer.py and timed each test individually (using timeit). In all cases, the tests went *faster* with my patches - even though "sage -t" took 50% longer than without the patches.

My next guess was that there is a problem with the startup time. Indeed, starting sage without the patches feels "snappier".

Using "sage -startuptime", I found with the patches:

```
## Slowest (including children)
1.623 sage.all (None)
0.356 sage.schemes.all (sage.all)
0.225 elliptic_curves.all (sage.schemes.all)

0.214 sage.misc.all (sage.all)
0.173 sage.algebras.all (sage.all)
0.153 ell_number_field (ell_rational_field)
```

Without patch:

```

I have to correct myself.

Apparently there is no reviewer :(

Anyway. I modified the patch so that now `modulus()` becomes a cached method. This provides a speed-up even without #11115. And once #11115 is merged as well, the speed-up will increase.

Without #11115, but with the patches from #9944 and from here:

```
sage: B.<t> = PolynomialRing(Integers(125))
sage: R = monsky_washnitzer.SpecialCubicQuotientRing(t^3 - t + B(1/4))
sage: P = R.poly_ring()
sage: x, T = R.gens()
# Without patches, the following was 495 Âµs per loop
sage: timeit('x*T')
625 loops, best of 3: 472 µs per loop
sage: %prun L=[x*T for _ in xrange(1000)]
         392002 function calls in 0.590 CPU seconds

```

That's better than with an unpatched Sage and thus good enough.

If multiplication by elements of QQ are implemented (and I assume they
are), then yes I definitely would go for commutative algebras.

I looked at the code, and it seems that at least operation of the base ring exists. But I think one should also implement an `_rmul_` and `_lmul_` for quotient ring elements - it is missing, so far.

<a id='comment:62'></a>The dependencies of this patch are stated in the corresponding form field. For the following timings, I additionally have #11298, #11267 and, in particular, #11115.

In some cases, there is quite an improvement, compared with the timings that are stated in previous comments! Note that the times per loop change, depending on whether one lets timeit run `10^4` loops (as in #9944) or one simply does `timeit` without any specification.

First series of timings: I guess most of the speedup is due to #9944

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: timeit('(2*x-1)^2+5')
625 loops, best of 3: 20.9 µs per loop
# unpatched 625 loops, best of 3: 22.5 Âµs per loop
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: timeit('(2*x-1)^2+5')
625 loops, best of 3: 21.3 µs per loop
# unpatched 625 loops, best of 3: 24.5 Âµs per loop
sage: R.<x> = GF(3)[]
sage: timeit('(2*x-1)^2+5')
625 loops, best of 3: 19.2 µs per loop
# unpatched 625 loops, best of 3: 87.7 Âµs per loop
sage: R.<x> = QQ['t'][]
sage: timeit('(2*x-1)^2+5')
625 loops, best of 3: 75.4 µs per loop
# unpatched 625 loops, best of 3: 114 Âµs per loop
sage: R.<x,y> = ZZ[]
sage: timeit('(2*x-1)^2+5')
625 loops, best of 3: 19.7 µs per loop
# unpatched 625 loops, best of 3: 21.9 Âµs per loop
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: timeit('(2*x-1)^2+5')
625 loops, best of 3: 18.2 µs per loop
# unpatched 625 loops, best of 3: 40 Âµs per loop
sage: R.<x,y> = GF(3)[]
sage: timeit('(2*x-1)^2+5')
625 loops, best of 3: 15.8 µs per loop
# unpatched 625 loops, best of 3: 26.3 Âµs per loop
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ['t'][]
sage: timeit('(2*x-1)^2+5')
625 loops, best of 3: 162 µs per loop
# unpatched 625 loops, best of 3: 239 Âµs per loop
```

Timings for some "schemes" tests.

```
sage -t  "devel/sage-main/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/sha_tate.py"
	 [29.5 s]
```
I have not the faintest idea where that slow-down might come from. Namely, the underlying arithmetic has drastically improved:

```
sage: B.<t> = PolynomialRing(Integers(125))
sage: R = monsky_washnitzer.SpecialCubicQuotientRing(t^3 - t + B(1/4))
sage: x, T = R.gens()
sage: timeit('x*T')
625 loops, best of 3: 179 µs per loop
# unpatched: 625 loops, best of 3: 612 µs per loop
```
and

```
sage: B.<t> = PolynomialRing(Integers(125))
sage: R = monsky_washnitzer.SpecialCubicQuotientRing(t^3 - t + B(1/4))
sage: P = R.poly_ring()
sage: timeit('P.modulus()',number=10^6)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 161 ns per loop
# unpatched: 1000000 loops, best of 3: 647 ns per loop
sage: x, T = R.gens()
sage: timeit('x*T')
625 loops, best of 3: 177 µs per loop
# unpatched: 625 loops, best of 3: 495 Âµs per loop
```

And the startup time (which is also relevant for doctests:

```
1.326 sage.all (None)
0.324 sage.schemes.all (sage.all)
0.184 sage.misc.all (sage.all)
0.160 hyperelliptic_curves.all (sage.schemes.all)
```

I'd appreciate if someone could explain why the doctest time in sage.schemes increased, while the underlying arithmetics became faster.

Overall, I think that the performance is quite good, and of course the main point of this ticket (namely to implement the category framework for rings) was successfully addressed.

Review, anyone?

I wouldn't say "due to", since the critical tests (perhaps introduced by #10052) pass with sage-4.7.1.rc1. In fact, I already found out that [attachment:trac9138-categories_for_rings.patch] is to blame. But I don't know yet what went wrong.

Helàs.

Matrix spaces have their custom `__getitem__` as well. But it would be possible to construct the polynomial ring by using the polynomial ring constructor:

```
sage: PolynomialRing(MatrixSpace(QQ,2),'x').category()
Category of algebras over Full MatrixSpace of 2 by 2 dense matrices over Rational Field
sage: PolynomialRing(SteenrodAlgebra(2),'x').category()
Category of algebras over mod 2 Steenrod algebra, milnor basis
```

The other problem is in sage/algebras/steenrod/steenrod_algebra.py.: With the patch from here,

```
            sage: A1 = SteenrodAlgebra(profile=[2,1])
            sage: A1(3)  # map integer into A1
```
returns 3 and not 1!

That behaviour boils down to

```
sage: A1._from_dict({():3})
3
```
Here, one should have

```
sage: A1._from_dict({():3},coerce=True)
1
```

I don't know, though, how my patch has changed the question whether there is a conversion or not: The word `coerce` occurs precisely twice in my first patch, but that is certainly unrelated with "coerce=True" versus "coerce=False". Strange.

<a id='comment:71'></a>It seems that the problem is deeper. With the first patch, I obtain

```

sage: A1.coerce_map_from(ZZ)

Without the patch, I obtain

Composite map:

          From: Finite Field of size 2
          To:   sub-Hopf algebra of mod 2 Steenrod algebra, milnor basis, profile function [2, 1]
```

By consequence, when doing `A1(3)` with my patch, a direct conversion is attempted from `ZZ` to `A1`, but the auxiliary methods involved in the conversion assume that the argument 3 has already been converted into the base ring, `GF(2)`.

Perhaps a "register_coercion" during initialisation could help.

Actually, that registration should take place in the `__init_extra__` method that is defined in `sage.categories.algebras`. Without my patch, the rather generic coercion from the base ring is registered no matter what, which means that it could result in a very slow coerce map from the base ring.

Therefore, my patch modifies `__init_extra__` so that the generic coercion is only registered if no "better" coercion has been registered before. It could be that that is a problem for Steenrod algebras.

<a id='comment:76'></a>The problem was that some doc tests in sage/rings violate the unique parent assumption on purpose. But homsets will try to be unique even if domain and codomain are not unique. That's bad.

Therefore, I made the following change for my first patch: If `Hom(X,Y,category)` is able to find a hom set H for the given data in cache, then it is first tested that `H.domain() is X` and `H.codomain() is Y`. If it isn't, then a new hom set is constructed, and put into the cache.

Hence, we have (as a new doctest):

```
    By trac ticket #9138, we abandon the uniqueness of hom sets, if the domain or
    codomain break uniqueness::

        sage: from sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_ring import MPolynomialRing_polydict_domain
        sage: P.<x,y,z>=MPolynomialRing_polydict_domain(QQ, 3, order='degrevlex')
        sage: Q.<x,y,z>=MPolynomialRing_polydict_domain(QQ, 3, order='degrevlex')
        sage: P == Q
        True
        sage: P is Q
        False

    Hence, P and Q are not unique parents. By consequence, the following homsets
    aren't either::

        sage: H1 = Hom(QQ,P)
        sage: H2 = Hom(QQ,Q)
        sage: H1 == H2
        True
        sage: H1 is H2
        False

    It is always the most recently constructed hom set that remains in the cache::

        sage: H2 is Hom(QQ,Q)
        True
```

The second patch still applies on top of the first. I did the doc tests in sage/rings and sage/categories with the first patch, but full doc tests should be run with both patches, of course.

<a id='comment:80'></a>At last it seems to work! With the new first patch together with the second patch, all doc tests (both sage/ and doc/) pass (at least for me)!

Here is the problem and its solution.

__First Problem__

Hecke algebras: _lmul_ for its elements returns None. The previous patch version would thus register `from_base_ring` for coercion. However, in that case, a default implementation of `from_base_ring` would be used, which fails if _lmul_ returns None. Hence, it must not be registered as coercion.

Solution: Use from_base_ring if it is a custom implementation , i.e., if `self.from_base_ring` is not obtained from `self.category().parent_class.from_base_ring`. If it is clear that the default implementation won't work, then do not register from_base_ring as coercion.

Additional advantage: If the user provides a fast custom `from_base_ring` then it will be picked up.

__Second problem__

`SpecialCubicQuotientRing`: Here, self.one() had not been available during initialisation
of coercion from the base ring. Hence, in the previous patch version, from_base_ring
had been registered.

However, _lmul_ is returning None, again. Additional complication:
The initialisation of a `SpecialCubicQuotientRing` as a commutative algebra happened
too early, namely *before* its hash was available. Hence, the attempt to construct
a hom set containing the coercion from the base ring had failed.

Solution: Move `CommutativeAlgebra.__init__` nearer to the end of `SpecialCubicQuotientRing.__init__`,
namely to a point where both self.one() and the hash are available.

__Conclusion__

Ready for Review!

I don't know what other ticket was creating the conflict (it has not been #11316, sorry for that). Anyway, the problem is that `MPolynomialRing_generic.__init__` was calling `ParentWithGens.__init__` first, and then `Ring.__init__`. By consequence, name assignment is tried *twice* - which is not allowed.

I am currently running the doc tests (the two tests that previously failed are now fine), and if it succeeds then I'll update both patches.

<a id='comment:87'></a>Both patches are updated: The first since it is rebased against #11316, the second since a rogue initialisation of a `ParentWithGens` occured.

For me, all tests pass, with sage-4.7.1.rc2 plus #11316 plus both patches from here. Thus, needs review again.

Apply trac9138-categories_for_rings.patch trac9138_categories_for_more_rings.patch

So I seem to not be able to reproduce your passing the doctest.
Did you also use sage.math. I can give you acces to the created folder on sage.math so you can fiddle around with it.

<a id='comment:98'></a>I've reviewed #11342 before reading Maarten's comment, so how about we can merge #11342 first and #9138 afterwards.

In `pbori.pyx`, can you clean up the comparison? E.g. remove `__richcmp__` completely and fix the `_cmp_` docstring.

In `sage/structure/element.pyx`, the following is stated:

```
    # For a derived Cython class, you **must** put the following in
    # your subclasses, in order for it to take advantage of the
    # above generic comparison code.  You must also define
    # either _cmp_c_impl (if your subclass is totally ordered),
    # _richcmp_c_impl (if your subclass is partially ordered), or both
    # (if your class has both a total order and a partial order;
    # then the total order will be available with cmp(), and the partial
    # order will be available with the relation operators; in this case
    # you must also define __cmp__ in your subclass).
```
Now this info might be outdated, and I admit that I don't have a good understanding of how comparison is supposed to be implemented in the new coercion model, but your `_cmp_` method  does not follow that comment.

Makes sense now...

So, I'll attach a new patch here. The old patch does apply, it is just that one must change the expected output (namely the name of a class) in one test.

> In `pbori.pyx`, can you clean up the comparison? E.g. remove `__richcmp__` completely and fix the `_cmp_` docstring.


OK. Sometimes I like to keep the old code in a comment, so that one can see how and why things have changed. Fixing the `_cmp_` docstring is certainly needed.

What you cite is for elements (and not outdated), but my code is for parents. I am afraid I have no reference. But I think I remember that for parents written in Cython one should provide a (single underscore) `_cmp_` method. I might ask on sage-devel, though.

<a id='comment:3'></a>The doctests pass for me, too. 

When I see commented-out methods lying around then I usually assume that they should be IN but for some reason we can't add the code yet, or that there is a bug in them that ought to be fixed. But right now there are various places where its just old stuff that we should actually get rid of. I would very much appreciate if you could clean that up and remove instead of just commenting out code that is not relevant any more. Realistically, if we don't remove that stuff while refactoring for newer frameworks then it'll forever clutter the source files. For those interested in the history there is always mercurial...

Some comments on the first patch:

* There is also a commented-out `__cmp__` in `sage/rings/polynomial/infinite_polynomial_ring.py`, I take it that should be removed as well? 
* `sage/rings/ring.pyx` l. 356-360 some commented out stuff after return? Same file, there are two `category()` methods that are just commented out.

Second patch: 

* `sage/algebras/free_algebra_quotient.py` the `_coerce_impl` and `__contains__` methods are also old stuff that should be snipped now that its no longer used.
* The `_mul_(self,y)` method in `sage/monoids/free_monoid_element.py` guarantees `y` to be a `FreeModuleElement` so the commented-out isinstance check should be removed.
* `sage/monoids/monoid.py` again superfluous `category()` method already commented out.
* The commented-out `__reduce__` method in `sage/rings/polynomial/pbori.pyx` should go away, right?
* The added comments in `sage/rings/quotient_ring.py` l. 153-162 aren't very helpful IMHO.

Well, I think sage-4.7.2.alpha4 could be finished today or tomorrow and I would rather not merge #11900 after that, especially if the patch is invasive.  This is probably not a patch which I want to quickly squeeze in an rc0.
