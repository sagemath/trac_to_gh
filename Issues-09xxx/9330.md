When you look at [this](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/sha_tate.html), there are a number of things wrong or confusing in the documentation.

Most importantly, several instances of Sha should have ticks, probably.  But are they referring to the mathematical object 

```
`Sha`
```
or the computer structure of the class

```
``Sha``
```
?  If I knew what was intended (given that the distinction is quite small), I would do this patch myself.  But it looks like sometimes the group is intended, other times the class object.

In line 756 we have 

```
We get no information the curve has rank 2.::
```

Is there any reason we cannot use the proper cyrillic font for Sha?

I changed Sha to `Sha` thoughout the document as it should be. There should be a better solution for this. Alas the unicode letter ле does not work in the pdf version (it works fine in the html). The \textcyr does not seem to work with LaTeX either. Probably it needs addtional fonts or so and I would object to include them just because of this one letter.

So I think this is as far as I can do the changes.

I also renamed constistantly the group as Tate-Shafarevich and not Shafarevich-Tate. (There is a debate about this, which I do not want to see repeated here. google tells me that T-S is more frequent.)

I don't understand this. My file sha_tate.py looks well different from the documentation link that you give. For instance I have changed the ``descent... thingy in trac 9287 merged as 14603 in 4.5.2.alpha1.

It should always be `Sha` never ``Sha``.

I believe this ticket solves the remaining problems. Though I have not checked it is needs to be rebased.

Yes, sorry I didn't see that - I've changed the description.  What is up with the "We get no information the " bit?  Maybe this is grammatically correct in the context of Tate-Shaf groups?  

Incidentally, though you changed the references to T-S, the file is S-T :)  Oh well; maybe that's as it should be if there isn't agreement.

Unfortunately I can't check this right now either, but if someone else doesn't, I'll do so soon.

Yop, sorry, I did not see that the 'when' was still missing. Here is an additional patch.

Luckily the filename is not visible to the user, so I don't have to bother changing it. ... and it gives some voice to the other order.

There is no problem with the rebase, because the patches here are exported against 4.5.2.alpha1 and #9442 was merged in 4.5.alpha4 if I am not mistaken. At least the addition lines are clearly in the file before I edited it.

These changes also require modifying doctests in `sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/BSD.py` (*Shafarevich-Tate* -> *Tate-Shafarevich*).

I don't know if there's a separate ticket for this.
