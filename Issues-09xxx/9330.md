When you look at [this](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/sha_tate.html), there are a number of things wrong or confusing in the documentation.

Most importantly, several instances of Sha should have ticks, probably.  But are they referring to the mathematical object 

```
`Sha`
```
or the computer structure of the class

```
``Sha``
```
?  If I knew what was intended (given that the distinction is quite small), I would do this patch myself.  But it looks like sometimes the group is intended, other times the class object.

In line 756 we have 

```
We get no information the curve has rank 2.::
```

So I think this is as far as I can do the changes.

I don't understand this. My file sha_tate.py looks well different from the documentation link that you give. For instance I have changed the ``descent... thingy in trac 9287 merged as 14603 in 4.5.2.alpha1.

It should always be `Sha` never ``Sha``.

I believe this ticket solves the remaining problems. Though I have not checked it is needs to be rebased.

Yes, sorry I didn't see that - I've changed the description.  What is up with the "We get no information the " bit?  Maybe this is grammatically correct in the context of Tate-Shaf groups?  

Incidentally, though you changed the references to T-S, the file is S-T :)  Oh well; maybe that's as it should be if there isn't agreement.

Yop, sorry, I did not see that the 'when' was still missing. Here is an additional patch.

Luckily the filename is not visible to the user, so I don't have to bother changing it. ... and it gives some voice to the other order.

There is no problem with the rebase, because the patches here are exported against 4.5.2.alpha1 and #9442 was merged in 4.5.alpha4 if I am not mistaken. At least the addition lines are clearly in the file before I edited it.
