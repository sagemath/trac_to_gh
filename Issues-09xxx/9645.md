A bug report on [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/46124695d2f7469a) made me play around with the following example:

```
sage: R.<x,y>=PolynomialRing(ZZ,2)
sage: I = R*(4*x^2*y^2+2*x*y^3+3*x*y,2*x^2+x*y,2*y^2)
sage: I.groebner_basis(algorithm='libsingular:std')
[x^2*y, x*y^2, 2*x^2 + x*y, 3*x*y, 2*y^2]
sage: (I.groebner_basis(algorithm='libsingular:std')*R).interreduced_basis()
[x^2*y, x*y^2, 2*x^2 + x*y, 3*x*y, 2*y^2]
sage: I.groebner_basis(algorithm='libsingular:slimgb')
[2*x^2 + x*y, 3*x*y, 2*y^2]
sage: (I.groebner_basis(algorithm='libsingular:slimgb')*R).interreduced_basis()
[2*x^2 + x*y, 3*x*y, 2*y^2]
sage: (I.groebner_basis(algorithm='toy:buchberger')*R).interreduced_basis()
[2*x^2 + x*y, 3*x*y, 2*y^2]
sage: I.groebner_basis(algorithm='toy:buchberger2')
[4*x^2*y^2 + 2*x*y^3 + 3*x*y, 2*x^2 + x*y, 2*y^2]
sage: (I.groebner_basis(algorithm='toy:buchberger2')*R).interreduced_basis()
[2*x^2 + x*y, 3*x*y, 2*y^2]
sage: I.groebner_basis(algorithm='magma')
[x^2*y, x*y^2, 2*x^2 + x*y, 3*x*y, 2*y^2]
```

**__First bug__** (fixed with Singular-3-1-1)

The documentation suggests that `toy:buchberger2` is supposed to return a reduced Groebner basis, but it doesn't. So, to the very least, the documentation is a little unclear.

**__Second bug__**

The five algorithms return two *different* reduced Groebner bases. So, at least one of them must be wrong.

`libsingular:std` and `magma` agree on this result:

```
sage: G1 = I.groebner_basis(algorithm='libsingular:std'); G1
[x^2*y, x*y^2, 2*x^2 + x*y, 3*x*y, 2*y^2]
```
while `libsingular:slimgb`, `toy:buchberger` and `toy:buchberger2` agree on this result:

```
sage: G2 = I.groebner_basis(algorithm='libsingular:slimgb'); G2
[2*x^2 + x*y, 3*x*y, 2*y^2]
```

The following suggests that at least answer `G2` is wrong:

```
sage: [g.reduce(G2) for g in G1]
[x^2*y, x*y^2, 0, 0, 0]
sage: [g.reduce(G1) for g in G2]
[0, 0, 0]
```

Let us check that indeed the element `x*y^2` belongs to the original ideal:

```
sage: y*I.0 -2*y^3*I.1 -x*I.2
x*y^2
```

Conclusion: **Under the assumption that there is no bug in reduce and the basic arithmetic, it is proven that slimgb and toy:buchberger(2) give a wrong answer.**

**__Third bug__** (fixed with Singular-3-1-1)

Of course, if `G1` is a Groebner basis then all of its elements must belong to the ideal. Singular provides a command to express the Groebner basis elements as combinations of the given ideal generators: `liftstd`.

But `liftstd` apparently gives a wrong answer:

```
sage: r = singular(R)
sage: i = singular(I)
sage: singular.eval('matrix m')
'matrix m;'
sage: print singular.eval('liftstd(%s,m)'%i.name())
_[1]=2*y^2
_[2]=-3*x*y
_[3]=2*x^2+x*y
_[4]=x*y^2
_[5]=x^2*y
sage: singular('m')
0,-1,   0,y,     -3*x-y,
0,2*y^2,1,-2*y^3,2*y^3+5*y,
1,0,    0,-x,    -x-2*y
```

So, up to order and sign, the answer given by `liftstd` coincides with `G1`. Now, the matrix `m` should transform the list of ideal generators into the Groebner basis. But it does not for the element `x^2*y`:

```
sage: print singular.eval('matrix(%s)*m'%i.name())
_[1,1]=2*y^2
_[1,2]=-3*x*y
_[1,3]=2*x^2+x*y
_[1,4]=x*y^2
_[1,5]=-12*x^3*y^2-6*x^2*y^3+x^2*y-4*y^3
```

So, there is a bug in `liftstd` as well. At least, it is possible to verify that `x^2*y` (and therefore all of `G1`) belongs to the ideal:

```
sage: 2*y*I.1 - x*I.0 + (2*x^3 + x^2*y - x)*I.2
x^2*y
```

There is a new singular spkg at #8059. However, this does not solve the problem. The only difference is that now one has

```
sage: I.groebner_basis(algorithm='toy:buchberger2')
[2*x^2 + x*y, 3*x*y, 2*y^2]
```
Hence, the result is reduced (the first bug is gone), but still wrong.

At least the problem with `liftstd` has disappeared in Singular-3-1-1.

But since the bug in `slimgb` persists, I reported [upstream](http://www.singular.uni-kl.de:8002/trac/ticket/245).

> There is a new singular spkg at #8059. However, this does not solve the problem. The only difference is that now one has ` sage: I.groebner_basis(algorithm='toy:buchberger2') [2*x^2 + x*y, 3*x*y, 2*y^2] ` Hence, the result is reduced (the first bug is gone), but still wrong.


Result is **right **because reduce is different in field and in ring (please read [this book chapter 4](http://books.google.com/books?id=Caoxi78WaIAC&pg=PA201&dq=adams+loustaunau+introduction+to+grobner+bases+chapter+4&hl=sr&ei=CwdYTJzPHcGe4AaZsKmhBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=adams%20loustaunau%20introduction%20to%20grobner%20bases%20chapter%204&f=false)).

x*y!^2  is reduced to zero on [2*x!^2 + x*y, 3*x*y, 2*y!^2] because x*y!^2 - (y*3*x*y-x*2*y!^2)=0.

So libsingular:slimgb and toy:buchberger2 are right, and singular:std and libsingular:std has bug.

Many thanks to Michael Brickenstein who explained [here](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/46124695d2f7469a) that our misunderstanding comes from the fact that Dusan expects to work with *weak* Gröbner bases - a notion that I was not aware of.

Singular computes a strong Gröbner basis. So, not a bug.

By the way, the remaining problem with slimgb is solved upstream: By now (i.e., with the current developer version and in the next official release), slimgb will raise an error when being called for an ideal over the integers.

In sage Singular was recently upgraded to 3.1.7.
1. What I do not understand, a slimgb call in standalone Singular 3.1.7  raises now an error

```
ring rng = integer,(x,y),dp;
option("redSB");
ideal I = 4*x^2*y^2 + 2*x*y^3 + 3*x*y, 2*x^2 + x*y, 2*y^2;
slimgb(I);
//? not implemented for rings with rings as coeffients}}}
```
but the slimgb call in sage

```
sage: R.<x,y>=PolynomialRing(ZZ,2)
sage: I = R*(4*x^2*y^2+2*x*y^3+3*x*y,2*x^2+x*y,2*y^2)
sage: I.groebner_basis(algorithm='libsingular:slimgb')
``` 
succeeds. Why is that ??
2. if there is really a difference between strong and weak groebner basis, 
then at least the 'toy:buchberger','toy:buchberger2' and 'groebner_basis' documentation   should be updated ,
hoping that nobody intermixes weak and strong groebner bases  by accident. (new ticket?)

3. Remark: the liftstd bug seems fixed
