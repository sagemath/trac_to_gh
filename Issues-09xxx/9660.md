In order to obtain the string representation of an NumberFieldFractionalIdeal, the class group of the number field is computed to determine whether or not the ideal is principal.  This can take a very long time.  For example, the following is essentially immediate:

```
sage: K.<zeta> = CyclotomicField(23)
sage: F = K.ideal(2).factor()
```
But now, doing

```
sage: F
```
takes a very long time.
