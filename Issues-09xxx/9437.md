It is, of course, really dumb that we have two independent implementations, but that's a job for another ticket.

With 4.6.rc0 the patch applies and works fine.  But look at these timings:

```
sage: G = SL(2, Zmod(4))
sage: time a = list(G)  
CPU times: user 0.05 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 0.06 s
Wall time: 1.69 s
sage: time b = G.list() 
CPU times: user 0.07 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.07 s
Wall time: 20.60 s
```

I'm not letting that stop me giving the patch a positive review, but it suggest that the list() method should be calling whatever the other one uses!

Testing the directory matrix_gps, the file which this patch changes now takes a very long time:

```
sage -t  "sage/groups/matrix_gps/matrix_group.py"           
	 [263.9 s]
```
whereas without the patch:

```
[240.1s]
```
Is the extra time just the time of the new doctest (if so, mark it #long time), or are some other doctests now slower?
