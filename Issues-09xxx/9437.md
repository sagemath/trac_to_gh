Sage is not able to work with special linear group over finite rings (for example iterate over its element). As in the following example, the constructor accept the argument Zmod(4). But the object is not able to do anything due to call to finite field in gap. Curiously, list(G) and G.list() does not raise the same error (but both of them do).

```
sage: G = SL(2, Zmod(4))
sage: print G
sage: list(G)
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

For a matrix group G, the two commands `list(G)` and `G.list()` are totally different implementations; the former uses Gap to calculate the generators of G, and does the rest in Sage, while the latter just asks Gap for the list. The former works since #8970. The patch above fixes the latter, and adds doctests to prove that they both work.

It is, of course, really dumb that we have two independent implementations, but that's a job for another ticket.

With 4.6.rc0 the patch applies and works fine.  But look at these timings:

```
sage: G = SL(2, Zmod(4))
sage: time a = list(G)  
CPU times: user 0.05 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 0.06 s
Wall time: 1.69 s
sage: time b = G.list() 
CPU times: user 0.07 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.07 s
Wall time: 20.60 s
```

I'm not letting that stop me giving the patch a positive review, but it suggest that the list() method should be calling whatever the other one uses!

Testing the directory matrix_gps, the file which this patch changes now takes a very long time:

```
sage -t  "sage/groups/matrix_gps/matrix_group.py"           
	 [263.9 s]
```
whereas without the patch:

```
[240.1s]
```
Is the extra time just the time of the new doctest (if so, mark it #long time), or are some other doctests now slower?
