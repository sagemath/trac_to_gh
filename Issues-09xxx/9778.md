Since maybe the developers are reluctant to implement the "metrology" module I submitted in #9763, when there's already a "units" module that has the same purpose, I'm trying to port the `LaTeX` capabilities to the already existing "units" module.

TO DO: Complete the latexdict list of units and `LaTeX` representation (if a unit isn't there, its symbol will be replaced by its name)

Also, I'm implementing an easier way to use `SI` prefixes on the units module. The patch I submitted in #9759 wasn't very intuitive (you had to type "units.length.meter.kilo"), partly because I didn't know very well how did that module work. This new version allows you to simply type "units.length.kilometer" (even if it's not tab-completed) and it will do the rest.

Is the "todo" necessary, or could it be postponed to another ticket?

Well, `latexdict` only contains a few units (10) and prefixes (5) so that it worked as an example; it would need to be completed with the names of all SI units and prefixes, at least for the LaTeX representation part.

By the way, I made this patch 2 years ago so I remember pretty little of it.

<a id='comment:4'>**Comment 4:**</a>
This supersedes #9759.

If someone wanted to complete this, they'd just have to make sure they implemented all the SI units etc. that Sage supports (see the 'todo' above).
