There is a missing backstick at `generic_graph.py`.

I changed the wording a little at the same time, when I saw the small formatting error. No code changes.

Why is that

```diff
- Tests whether ...
+ Return ``True`` if ...
```

Your version is much less precise since you say nothing when the graph is not a subgraph. It is standard in Sage to write `Test Property X`. Of course you can remove the `s` (i.e. `Tests` -> `Test`) and remove the reference to `self`.

The rest looks fine.

Well, for now we have for example


```
is_eulerian() 	Return True if the graph has a - - 
is_planar() 	Test whether the graph is - -
is_circular_planar() 	Test whether the graph is - - 
is_regular() 	Return True if this graph is - -
```


On #18925 and #18941 I have used "return true if" -phrasing. That can of course be converted, but it should be uniform in all parts of the software. Was there some discussion about this in sage-devel?

And btw, should every function document the output type? As an example, `has_bottom()` in posets is documented as "Return True if the poset has a unique minimal element." in the index of functions, and then "Return True if the poset has a unique minimal element, and False otherwise." in the function itself. There is no explicit `OUTPUT`-part.

I don't think so. And I agree with you that it would better be uniform.

No. Neither the `INPUT` nor the `OUTPUT` sections are mandatory. If your function has simple `input/output` (like a `is_X(self)` method) then it is fine to include the specifications in the documentation. Otherwise it is up to the programmer to judge whether it is clearer with or without `INPUT/OUTPUT`.

Now there is at least explicit wording. I think that it is a place for another ticket to unify the documentation.

But developer guide says "This is not optional.": http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#documentation-strings . I think that this could be corrected. See #17693 comment 16.

```diff
-          whether ``self`` is an *induced* subgraph of ``other`` that is if
-          the vertices of ``self`` are also vertices of ``other``, and the
-          edges of  ``self`` are equal to the edges of ``other`` between the
-          vertices contained in ``self`.
+          whether the graph is an *induced* subgraph of ``other`` that is if
+          the vertices of the graph are also vertices of ``other``, and the
+          edges of the poset are equal to the edges of ``other`` between the
+          vertices contained in the graph.
```


Why ``self`` has been changed to poset? Since the function is about graphs and not about posets, the wording should be changed.

I had a temporary mental disorder. Corrected.

You should change the description so it suits to what the ticket finally does.

I know it is not the main purpose of the patch, but since you have changed `self` for graph in the documentation maybe you should do it in the section "See also". It looks weird when we build the documentation in html.

True. I was blind.

Corrected. Needs review.
