The change to `src/sage/rings/polynomial/pbori.pyx` seems not necessary. Cython knows about that, I have been told. But maybe I am wrong.

Otherwise, looks good to me

Oh, the problem there is that it only works in Cython if the underlying object is _actually_ a `dict`.  It doesn't work, annoyingly, if it's not exactly a `dict`.  That said, I had intended to undo that change--the object in question here was a `KeyConvertingDict`.  But the better approach I found for this is to just add `iterkeys/itervalues/iteritems` methods on `KeyConvertingDict` for backwards compatibility.

That change wasn't even supposed to be in this ticket. I'm not sure how it's still there.
