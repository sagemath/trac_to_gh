Do I have to look into the doctesting framework or will this ticket just fix #21121 as a by-product?

It will not fix #21121 as by-product, but #21121 will be trivial to fix using #21124.

There's some inconsistency in giving the defaults of arguments:

`(Default: 10)`  vs. `(default:10)` or even just mentioning it
in the text (e.g. for `no_sci`, where the default is `None`),
or in *some* cases also for `truncate`, where the default now is
`False`, but the description says (just) "if `True`, ...".

(But that's a minor thing, as you'd presumably have to touch
more regions to normalize all instances.)


P.S.:  I looked at your previous commit, and just briefly scanned the new one.
