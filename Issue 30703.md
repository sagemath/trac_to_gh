In this case we can still retrieve the installed versions from the installation records `$SAGE_LOCAL/var/lib/sage/installed` (in the case of the sage distribution), but we will not be able to provide all details such as `remote_version`.

I think the previous code was easier to understand: if SAGE_PKGS is None, we don't need to go through the following for loop. But now one has to understand that the iteration is over an empty list. Better to exit the method early. 

```
-    if not SAGE_PKGS:
-        return {}
-
-    try:
-        lp = os.listdir(SAGE_PKGS)
-    except FileNotFoundError:
-        return {}
+    if SAGE_PKGS:
+        try:
+            lp = os.listdir(SAGE_PKGS)
+        except FileNotFoundError:
+            pass
     for ...
```


Moreover, I was wondering if the name normalization is ok as it changes the output of a public facing method and thus might break user scripts.

Otherwise it looks good to me.
