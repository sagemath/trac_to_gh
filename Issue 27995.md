This ticket fixes the last Python 3 doctest failure in doctest/test.py.

The problem is that the doctest dispatcher relies on internals of the multiprocessing library, which slightly changed in Python 3; see the [relevant file](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.7/Lib/multiprocessing/process.py#L365). Because of that, until now with Python 3, the master doctest process waits for its children to exit before exiting itself, even though it is not supposed to.

I also adjusted the affected doctest so that it checks for what was initially intended. This got lost when the minimum `die_timeout` of subprocesses got increased from 20 to 60 seconds, but this also means the doctest now lasts 40 seconds longer than before.
