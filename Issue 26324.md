CC:  @tscrim @fchapoton @nthiery

Keywords: py3, graph

Done in this ticket:
- update the module's documentation as we forgot to do it in #26447
- use `vertex_list` in several methods and also free data structure
- PEP8

Not done:
- method `spectral_radius` is untouched to avoid conflict with #26559

Little thing, but is is probably better to do `Integer(count[i]/2)` -> `Integer(count[i]//2)` (do we even need the `Integer` after that change?). Otherwise LGTM.

Actually, the patchbot has one seemingly real failure:

```
sage -t --long src/sage/categories/finite_semigroups.py  # 1 doctest failed
```

due to a change in the output order.

Without `Integer`, we get:

sage: triangles_count(graphs.PetersenGraph())
{0: 0L, 1: 0L, 2: 0L, 3: 0L, 4: 0L, 5: 0L, 6: 0L, 7: 0L, 8: 0L, 9: 0L}
