CC:  was tmonteil zimmerma

As reported there [1]


```
sage: x = 1/2 
sage: x 
1/2 
sage: x//2 
1/4
```
 

Though I have no idea how this kind of things is to be fixed `^^;`

```

The reason is that for rationals (and apparently more generally for `FieldElement`), we have


```
    def __floordiv__(self, other):
        return self / other
```


where it should be


```
    def __floordiv__(self, other):
        return floor(self / other)
```


I will do a patch once i have compiled a more recent version of Sage

What is fun is that


```
sage: RDF(0.5)//2
0.25

sage: RR(0.5)//2
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for //: 'sage.rings.real_mpfr.RealLiteral' and 'sage.rings.real_mpfr.RealNumber'
```

The condition `if not other != 0:` looks weird. For real interval fields, why not using `other.contains_zero()` which is both easier to understand and faster ?

I do not understand the ad-hoc coercion that is made for `RealNumber` where the precision of `self` takes predecence over the one of `other`.

Concerning `FieldElement` it is very dangerous to return the usual division, since it will silently fail when the field in a subset of the reals for which we did not define a `__floordiv__` method:


```
sage: RLF(5) // 2
2.5000000000000000?
sage: AA(5) // 2
5/2
```


What about trying `(self/other).floor()` and raising a `NotImplementedError` if the method does not exist ?

Because I wanted something which behaves like `contains_zero()` but still works for any kind of element (unfortunately, `__floordiv__` doesn't use the coercion system).

That's outside the scope of this ticket, but something like that could be done in a new ticket or as part of #2034.

I do not agree with your semantic of `__floordiv__`. Within Sage `//` is meant for *internal division* (i.e. quotient of the euclidean division):

```
sage: x = polygen(ZZ)
sage: p1 = (x+1)*(x+2)
sage: p1 // (x+1)
x + 2
sage: _.parent()
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Integer Ring
sage: sage: p1 / (x+1)
x + 2
sage: sage: _.parent()
Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Integer Ring
```


Inside `RR` or `RDF` I am not sure what would be the point of `//`. This is a prefectly valid euclidean division `5 = 2 x 2.5 + 0`.

It's consistent with Python's `__floordiv__` for `float`, so this what we should do according to the "principle of least surprise".

Actually I think that a good (partial) specification would be:
- `//` and `%` should always be consistent when implemented
- in non-trivial euclidean rings `a // b` and `a % b` should stand for the remainder and quotient of euclidean division (eg `ZZ`, `QQ[x]`). In these cases, it would just be aliases of `a.quo_rem(b)[0]` and `a.quo_rem(b)[1]`.

Would make sense to me and would also be better from the coercion point of view. However in Sage we use to convert exact integer results to integer as in

```
sage: type((2.5).floor())
<type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>
```


Note that Python is sloppy about the output type

```
>>> type(2.0 // 1.0)
float
>>> type(fractions.Fraction(2,1) // fractions.Fraction(1,1))
int
```

(but `fractions` is not so much a standard)
