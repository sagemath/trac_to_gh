# Issue 19834: Arb: random_element

Issue created by migration from Trac.

At the moment

```
sage: RBF.random_element()
```

seems to return only integers (with correct parent `RBF`). Since a typical element of `RBF` is not an integer, this should be changed. (The new distribution would then maybe also coincide with `RIF`)

Changing keywords from "" to "arb".
