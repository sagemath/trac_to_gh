Hello,

This would be really useful.

1) The name is too generic: `generating_function` could be anything (e.g. the number of lattice points in dilates). It should be something like `non_negative_lattice_points_generating_function`.

2) What do you mean by "generating function"? Is it weighted by the sum of the vector?

3) You should at least check that the number of integer partitions is correctly computed by your function with the polyhedron

```
x1 >= x2 >= x3 >= x4 >= x5 >= 1
```

versus

```
sage: [Partitions(k, length=5).cardinality() for k in range(5,20)]
[1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 13, 18, 23, 30, 37, 47, 57, 70]
```

Good :)

Thank you for your comments. Code updated.

> 1) The name is too generic: `generating_function` could be anything (e.g. the number of lattice points in dilates). It should be something like `non_negative_lattice_points_generating_function`.

It seems that "integral points" is used in sage.geometry.polyhedron` a couple of times, thus,
changed to `generating_function_of_integral_points`.

> 2) What do you mean by "generating function"? Is it weighted by the sum of the vector?

Inserted a formula to make this precise.

}
```

Also I think the method `generating_function_of_integral_points` should have an `algorithm` keyword. For polytopes, could provide a naive algorithm that just collects the monomials corresponding to `integral_points`. And another algorithm would be to just call LattE. 

Various algorithms options such as `result_as_tuple` are not sufficiently documented.

For the LattE algorithm, the best output format would be a sum of Factorizations. Is this what `result_as_tuple` can represent?

Reading this again, I think, this is not a good style, as `_composition_mod_` is basically needed/used as this function calles recursively itself. I've renamed it to `recursively_build_compositions` and moved it into the main function, so slightly refactored the code.

It makes of course no practical difference in this example. 
But it is the syntactic presence of `yield` in the body of a function that changes a function to a generator. Consider:

```
sage: def test():
....:     if False: yield 1
....: 
sage: test()
<generator object test at 0x105434970>
```

So it is good practice to use `yield from` to pass on another generator, instead of just returning the generator object.

Also, the docstring of `compositions_mod` should probably use the word "all" somewhere. Are these ALL solutions to this modular equation? Is every solution returned exactly once? etc. 

Also the examples should be revised because in the output the crucial choice of the modulus for each of the components is not visible.

Overall, I think I would be happier if this whole thing could be redone in the language of point lattices (`sage.modules.free_module_integer`) and their cosets --- but I have not looked at how you use the result.

Thanks, this is an improvement. Now I understand that the strings that are assembled in this part of the code are just used for logging. 

I think both the description of the "splitting" in the documentation and the implementation can be made more transparent.

Perhaps it should at least be said that if `split=True`, it uses the complement of the `hyperplane_arrangements.braid`.

Following up on `name`/`names`:

```
