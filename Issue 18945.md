LGTM but can you also fix the `sage --help` output?

Before going further, did you mean that:

```

diff --git a/src/bin/sage-notebook b/src/bin/sage-notebook
index 5624351..680e4d4 100755
--- a/src/bin/sage-notebook
+++ b/src/bin/sage-notebook

     'default': NotebookSageNB,   # change this to change the default
     'sagenb': NotebookSageNB,
     'ipython': NotebookIPython,

 } 
 
 notebook_names = ', '.join(notebook_launcher.keys())
```

Where you have both `ipython` and `jupyter`?

Yes, `sage -n ipython` still works.

OK I asked because you replaced `ipython` by `jupyter` everywhere else. Not added, replaced, except here.
