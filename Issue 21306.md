Frédéric, this works with `intervals_poset` written by you; it uses `constructor = LatticePoset`. Also `relabel` works, it uses `constructor = FiniteLatticePoset . . . return constructor(. . ., category=self.category(), . . .)`.

What is the difference, and which one is better?

(Sidenote: As I work with this, maybe the parameter could be also `('bottom', None)` to add only another bound.)

The difference is that `LatticePoset` redirects to `Poset`, which does additional (pre)processing of the input. `FiniteLatticePoset` assumes the data is the correct format. So the latter is better for speed, the former is better for easier coding.

Anyways, now it at least works. The test set is long and boring, sorry for that. On the plus side it should cover every line of the code.

Frédéric, can you check this one? Basic logic should be clear: a meet-semilattice with top element is a lattice, and a join-semilattice with bottom element is a lattice.

not coherent:

I would prefer the second option, because (None,None) is useless.

But `+`-operator also accepts the zero as argument. Some user might use code like "if that then newbot = 42 else newbot = None . . . P.with_bounds((newbot, newtop))".
