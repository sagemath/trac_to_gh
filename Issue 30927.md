At least some of them are probably not in worse shape than many of our current optional/experimental packages.

Before proceeding, I would like to understand what package developers and package users would gain by declaring Python packages as sage optional packages. For now, I would only consider doing this if

- package versions were not tight to sage versions. In the curent setup a package upgrade needs a ticket review and, when merged, has to wait for a new sage version.
- there is no serious continuous integration for packages (as they have eg for gap)

The solution here is to use pip packages instead of normal packages. 
https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/packaging.html#package-source-types

These do not come with tarball information and do not have to pin the version, so by default the latest version on PyPI would be installed.

Well, we do have workflows on GH Actions that at least tries to install all optional and experimental packages!
