I added some review on the MR.  I think this branch highlights some larger changes that are needed with `repr`-ing of sets and nip that in the bud once and for all (otherwise there will need to be many, many `# py2 / # py3` flags for tests that have Set outputs, and even that won't really be sufficient since the order should be treated as arbitrary regardless of Python version).

Retarging tickets optimistically to the next milestone.  If you are responsible for this ticket (either its reporter or owner) and don't believe you are likely to complete this ticket before the next release (8.7) please retarget this ticket's milestone to sage-pending or sage-wishlist.

Where did that gfortran commit come from?

https://gitlab.com/sagemath/sage/merge_requests/3#note_131411562  See also my other commentary on there.  I don't think this merge request is appropriate as-is since it's just a very limited subset of `# py2` and `# py3` flags to try to treat an issue (the ordering of Sets when displayed) which needs to be treated more broadly, either by changing how Sets are actually displayed, or by adding a new feature to the doctest framework to allow more flexibility here.

Ticket retargeted after milestone closed (if you don't believe this ticket is appropriate for the Sage 8.8 release please retarget manually)

All this has now been fixed elsewhere.
