Just a basic implementation. It does do a slight abuse of `dual`, but I think in a very natural way, and I modified `duality_pairing` accordingly.

A couple comments (I'm not reviewing this in foreseeable time, but these things caught my eye):

1) I don't like the redefinition of `duality_pairing`. If I make Sage compute the duality pairing between an element in the QSym Phi basis and the NSym H basis, then "who wins" -- the standard pairing or the rescaled one? (I guess the rescaled one, but this isn't very natural.)

Could you move the `ncsf.py` changes to a different ticket, or do you actually use them in `qsym.py`? That would make reviewing easier.

2) 

```
+            \Phi_I = \sum_{J \succ I} z_I / sp_{I,J} M_I,
```
The M_I should be M_J here. Same in the \Psi_I formula.

3) I doubt that the Phi-basis is defined over any base ring. Don't they give the example
Phi_322 = 2M_322 + M_52 + M_34 + 1/3 M_7
in the preprint?

[OT: Speaking of splitting tickets for easier review, I'm wondering what you think of splitting out the Hall basis from the free-Lie-algebra ticket... I'm pretty positive I could review the Lyndon basis easily enough.]

It doesn't matter because they give the same value.

In some ways that is a loaded question. I don't specifically use them, but they do now have a well-defined "dual" basis (up to the rescaling). So in some sense it is wrong to not define them, and those are easy, localized additions in `ncsf.py`.

Fixed.

I copied the wrong disclaimer. Fixed.

[I'm opposed to it. The name of the basis is not the best, but it is a different basis, it does work, and it fits naturally with that ticket. I just wish I could find the precise reference that I used for you to look at.]

Does this mean the Psi basis of QSym is not dual to the Psi basis of NSym using the usual duality pairing, but using a rescaled version of that??

I don't think I understand how the math of this rescaling works, but since it still gives basis-independent answers I think it's ok.

Q: is this faster to implement duality pairing this way?  Before the computation was by coercion.  It is only reason that you might want to implement a version on a particular basis if that method will improve speed.

I object to using the short name for the basis `Phi` and `Psi`.  If you are doing computations in QSym/NCSF you are likely to be using both and the naming convention should be different.  Suggested alternatives: `Phid` and `Psid`, `phi` and `psi`, `Ph` and `Ps`.

You should add these bases to the list of shorthands.

Eeks.  What am I saying?  The dual basis to `NCSF.Phi()` is not `QSym.Phi()`, it is `QSym.Phi()` normalized.  I think that you should not implement `dual_basis` for either of these bases unless you are going to implement the scaled version of the dual basis.

In analogy with symmetric functions we have:

```
sage: SymmetricFunctions(QQ).inject_shorthands(verbose=False)
sage: P = p.dual_basis()
sage: P(s[2,1])
2*d_p[1, 1, 1] - d_p[3]
```
