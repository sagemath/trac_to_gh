# Issue 10060: Fix _sig_on/_sig_off bugs

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jdemeyer

Thanks to #10030, we can check for invalid uses of `_sig_on`/`_sig_off`. This ticket will collect those bugs (the bugs do not depend on #9678 or #10030, they were just _found_ using those tickets).

Looks good to me.

We (i.e. you) should document somewhere very clearly the use of

```
   sig_on()
   c_function()
   sig_off()
```

vs.

```
   try:
      sig_on()
      cython_function()
   finally:
      sig_off()
```


In any case, positive review to this ticket.

There is already some documentation at #10109, but you are right that it should be expanded.

What did you rebase it against? Fails to apply on sage-4.6.2.alpha3

Replying to [comment:11 vbraun]:

The future sage-4.6.2.alpha4 :-)

For this patch, that probably means sage-4.6.2.alpha3 + #10028.
