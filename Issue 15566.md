# Issue 15566: Add a gcd algorithm for univariate polynomials over number fields using pari

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: lftabera

Original creation time: 2014-02-10 15:54:31

Keywords: gcd, number field, univariate polynomial, pari

This ticket is a split of #8558 to simplify reviewing and partial merging.

Currently, gcd of polynomials over absolute number fields uses euclidean algorithm. This patch changes that and makes the gcd using internal pari routines. This is not optimal for high degree number fields. See #8558 for an improvement.

For the documentation (in particular the indentation of it), please follow the format from [http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/coding_basics.html#documentation-strings](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/coding_basics.html#documentation-strings)

Can you make polynomial rings using the `PolynomialRing` constructor instead of the `R[x]` construct (which isn't really meant for Sage library use).

I have changed the use of R[x] and some small fixes.

Looks good to me and gives a measurable (though not dramatic) speedup in the few unscientific tests that I've done.

The reviewer patch makes one simplification in the case where one of the degrees is 0: if I'm not mistaken, we may assume that `self.parent() is other.parent()` thanks to ``@`coerce_binop`.  Other than that, just some formatting fixes, typos etc.  If you agree with my changes, it's a positive review.

You are correct, the other.parent is not needed.

I have added some dots to some sentences in the documentation.
