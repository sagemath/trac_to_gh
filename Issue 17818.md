# Issue 17818: Improve lookahead in IntegerListsLex

`IntegerListsLex` uses a depth first search in a prefix tree, with lookahead to prune branches.
The purpose of this ticket is to improve the lookahead algorithm in two directions:

- Detect more branches that can be cut.
- Better time complexity; this probably will involve identifying important invariants and caching them.

Example:: even just for n=1000 this is taking a long time:

```
    sage: n = 100
    sage: IntegerListsLex(binomial(n,2)-1, length=n, min_slope=1).list()
```


One could hope that, in non degenerate cases, one could reach an
average complexity roughly linear in `O(log(max_n), max_length)` per
list generated.

Can we _please_ stop talking about "degenerate cases" without specifying what that means?

This ticket involves some research, which includes in particular defining precisely what "degenerate" is. Until this research is done, we can't do anything but remain vague.
