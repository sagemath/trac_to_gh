 I just did `sage -f ` on the spkg file. Is this not enough? I see that at startup I get

so Twisted got updated to version 13 along the way. 

But I have no clue how to tell what version is actually being run. Can one implement some functionality for this? Otherwise  this will keep causing trouble... Something like `notebook.version()`.

Correct, but I thought that was the only way to do *development* with the sagenb (which I needed for sws2rst).  I'm going to try this again.  I just did 

```
$ git pull upstream master
