# Issue 15651: CC -> PARI: return t_REAL for real numbers

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15888

When converting Sage complex numbers to PARI, we should return a PARI `t_REAL` if the original number was actually real. This fixes a problem with `ellwp()` in #15767. In PARI's floating point model, the number `1e-19 + 0.0*I` has less precision than the real `1e-19`.

It is also consistent with the PARI philosophy of returning simplified types (examples: `(1.1*I)^2` and `ellj(1.1*I)` in PARI gives real numbers).

It would seem to make sense to treat purely imaginary numbers similarly, by setting the real component to the `t_INT` 0, as PARI does.  With your patch,

```
sage: pari(CC(1))
1.00000000000000
sage: pari(CC(I))
0.E-19 + 1.00000000000000*I
sage: _.debug()
[&=0000000004a45468] COMPLEX(lg=3):0c00000000000003 0000000004a45458 0000000004a45440 
  real = [&=0000000004a45458] REAL(lg=2):0400000000000002 (0,expo=-64):1fffffffffffffc0 
  imag = [&=0000000004a45440] REAL(lg=3):0400000000000003 (+,expo=0):6000000000000000 8000000000000000

```
