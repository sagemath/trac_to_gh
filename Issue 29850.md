Keywords: hyperelliptic jacobian

The following code:


```python
R.<v> = QQ[]
C = HyperellipticCurve(v**3-1)
J = C.jacobian()
D = J(v-1,0)
```


crashes on sage version 9.1 and the current `develop` branch with the exception:


```

The reason is that the code uses `x` internally and doesn't expect the input to come from a "different" univariate polynomial ring, hence the exception. The error does not occur when `v` is replaced by `x` in the example above.

The proposed patch explicitly casts the given polynomials to the parent ring of the curve's defining polynomials.

The doctest failures are coming from the fact that a Jacobian can be constructed with a different base field than the underlying curve, so taking the base ring from the curve itself is creating errors.

The path of least resistance is to create a `HyperellipticCurve` with custom variables:

```
sage: R.<v> = QQ[]                                                              
sage: C = HyperellipticCurve(v**3-1,0, 'v,y')                                   
sage: J = C.jacobian()                                                          
sage: D = J(v-1, 0); D
(v - 1, y)
```

Given this, I'm not even sure this should be considered a bug in the first place. Maybe a better fix would be to edit some docstrings to better document the existing behavior.

I updated the patch to convert everything to the jacobian's internal polynomial ring when constructing divisors.

Given that a hyperelliptic curve can be constructed from a univariate polynomial, I think the "custom names" option for hyperelliptic curves is problematic: it requires the user to repeat elements, where this wouldn't really be required. The `u` or `x` can be read off from the parent of the passed-in univariate polynomial. If it is required to come up with a name for the other variable (like `y`) we may have a bit of a problem, because the system can't choose itself very well. Particularly, for `HyperellipticCurve(y^5+y+1)` we would have a problem, since you probably do not want to name the other variable `y` as well. So perhaps there should be an option to give the name of the second variable (only) ?

Currently, the interface creates unnecessary ambiguity: what would `HyperellipticCurve(x^5+x+1,'y,x')` be?

This should clearly be (and already is) `x^2 = y^5 + y + 1`: The meaning of `names=` is to forget about the original variables of `f` and `h` and use the given names instead.
