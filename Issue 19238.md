With this patch, `RealSet` _still_ shows the wrong doc.

`RealSet` actually has no documentation:

```
class RealSet(UniqueRepresentation, Parent):

    @staticmethod
    def __classcall__(cls, *args):
```


So the only correct value for `RealSet.__doc__` is `None`, which is how it will be after #20626.
