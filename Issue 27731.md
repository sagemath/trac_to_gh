Thank you for doing this!  And for doing the updates according to the hacking instructions :-) so glad you documented that.  I note that you didn't (yet) add the final files at GH:
> On github, make a new release, appropriately tagged, add there binary assets: the tarball from dist/ and the pdf files as above

But from that and code standpoint I think you are good, so someone just needs to check that this one updates and works properly with a ST file "just in case".  My development Sage install isn't currently available :( since it's computing :) but anyone can check this latter part without knowing much about ST.

`sagetex` works on a simple file and passes its test suite.

Not in Sage 8.8.  Let's please to try keep tickets' milestones related to the release in which we actually intend to include them, and in particular the release in which they were _actually_ included, especially when closing tickets.
