The following code demonstrates that despite that `IntegerLattice` is defined as a module over `ZZ`, `.component_vector()` represents a vector `r` not belonging to a lattice `L` as a linear combination of the basis vectors of `L` with fractional coefficients. 


```
from sage.modules.free_module_integer import IntegerLattice

L = IntegerLattice([2,2,2])
r = vector(ZZ,[1,1,1])

print(r in L)                             # this is False
print(L.coordinate_vector(r,check=True))  # check should fail, and exception should be raised but it's not
```
