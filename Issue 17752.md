Some notes from the discussion at SD64:

* Generic features to be extracted from #15375

- Exp functor:

  Currently in sage/groups/exp.py ; could be sage/monoids/exp.py

      class Exp(...)
         def log(self):
             return self._log

      sage: Exp(my_additive_group)
      sage: Exp(additive_group_morphism)

      sage: my_additive_group.exp()  # return the associated multiplicative group

  Possibly make it a functorial construction (can be postponed to later):

      Create sage.categories.additive_group_exp along the lines of
      sage.categories.cartesian_product

      class AdditiveMagmas:
          class Exp:
              class ParentMethods:
                   `@`abstract_method
                   def log(self):
                       ...
              class ElementMethods:
                   def _mul_(self, other):
                       return self.parent()(self.value+other.value)

          class Unital:
              class Exp:
                  class ParentMethods:
                       def one():
                           return self(self.log().zero())
      ....

- Semidirect product of groups:
  Put Mark's implementation in sage.groups.semidirect_product.SemiDirectProduct

  Have Groups.ParentMethods.semidirect_product call it (currently it
  says NotImplemented)

  Bonus: if PermutationGroup.semidirect_product is called with the
  second group not being a permutation group, call the generic
  implementation. Same for finitely presented groups.


* Generic features to be extracted from #17989 (Daha)

- Improvements to tensor products

- Tensor product of morphisms (see ticket by Nicolas Borie?)

- Tensor products without flattening? For tensor product of algebras

  What happens in Sage if you one does a tensor product of algebras
  that are themselves tensor products? *boom*

  To be further discussed; probably tensor_product should take a flag flatten=True

- Smash product

This is still messed up, specifically deciding the right category for tensor products.
However most doctests pass.

Mainly to cc myself (and a completely shameless plug for the related #18631).

Also #15375 is a dependency, but are there currently others (in particular, #15874)?

Travis,

I had a patch bomb for the DAHA.
At some point I forgot to factor out the smash product.

Isn't all of the code for the smash product on #15874? If so, then we'd only have to merge that in and mark that as a dependency. Or is that not necessary for your DAHA code? If that's the case, then we definitely should factor that out.
