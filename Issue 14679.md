See the attached patch which, I hope, speaks for itself. I don't see any reason why that permutation had to be multiplied by an identity permutation. I thought it might have been meant to coerce the permutation into a larger symmetric group or to avoid some corner-case bugs, but this doesn't seem to be an issue (cf. the doctests I added). The patch has a minor but nontrivial effect on speed:


```
sage: timeit("list(OrderedSetPartitions([1,2,3,4,5],[3,2]))")
```

now takes 6.75 rather than 7.67 ms.

Oops, the dependency definitely needed a hash. But how does that affect the failure of the patch? Do you have a bot which pulls dependencies automatically?
