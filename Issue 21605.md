I would also be in favor of:
* shipping the seadata "normal" database as a standard package, it is "only" 18 MB and necessary to do usual crypto stuff on elliptic curves over finite fields of 400-bit size but I'm highly biased here (also note that there is a "big" version now),
* splitting the current database_pari into separate packages, that will surely ease integration into distros.

What do you think?

Well, 18MB is big. It would become one of the largest standard packages. I think it's too specialized to make it standard.

I don't think it matters for distros. Distros can do whatever they want with those packages, independent of how Sage packages them.

Sorry, I made too much cleanup...

There is a superfluous empty directory `data` in the tarball.

The tarball looks good, let me just run tests...
