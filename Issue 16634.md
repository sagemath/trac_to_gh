It would be great if the documentation of symbolic expressions would take the particular expression into account. In particular, if it is a constant, then it should also display the docstring of that constant.

This originates from sage-devel mailing list thread [About "pi?"](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/Oi3bLbO5eO0).
