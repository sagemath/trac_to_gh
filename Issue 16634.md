It would be great if the documentation of symbolic expressions would take the particular expression into account. In particular, if it is a constant, then it should also display the docstring of that constant.

Someone with more familiarity with how SR is used should probably change the methods that are shown in the docstring.

Documentation doesn't build (make doc fails).
