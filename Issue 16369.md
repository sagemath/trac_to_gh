Keywords: symmetric functions, sage-combinat


```
Sym = SymmetricFunctions(ZZ)
w = Sym.w()
w[4].coproduct()
```

This would fail because `w[4]` would be transformed into the h-basis, which would make some of its coefficients into rationals even though they should be integers.

The cause is the fact that inverting an integer matrix can turn its entries into rationals even if the matrix is invertible over ZZ. I have fixed this in a way I believe to be suboptimal, but this is all I have time for...

The info that this ticket is in need for is whether it is OK to rely on sage's ability to invert an invertible matrix over an arbitrary base ring. The matrix is defined over ZZ (and is invertible over ZZ), but Sage does not know that, and the worry is that over some rings it might not find the inverse despite its existence.

I would perhaps do something like this as the workaround:

```python
inv_m = ~m
try:
    inv_m = inv_m.change_ring(m.base_ring())
except TypeError: # It's not in the base ring as we thought it was
    pass
```

or without the `try/except` block if it should fail.

I would also say the using Sage's ability to invert the matrix over general base rings is the only realistic way to work (unless I'm missing something).

Thanks, but this begs my question, which I guess was unclear.

The thing that can fail is not the "change_ring"; it's the inversion itself. And what I am worried is that it could fail despite the matrix (which is actually an integer matrix with determinant -+1) having an inverse. The one realistic workaround for that is to do these matrix computations over the base ring ZZ rather than the given base ring for the symmetric functions.

Are you worried about rings with positive characteristic (in which case, if it fails, is the basis even well-defined)? I believe we should just leave it as (doing the matrix inversion over the base ring) is until we come across a definite problem.

Alternatively, you could use the `immaculate_function` method on any basis (I think they all go through the complete basis, so that's where you want to do it). That gives you the immaculate function for every integer vector.


```
sage: NSym = NonCommutativeSymmetricFunctions(QQ)
sage: I = NSym.I()
sage: I.immaculate_function([-1,2,2,2]) # that should be the -1-st Bernstein of I[2,2,2]
I[1, 1, 1, 2] + I[1, 1, 2, 1] + I[1, 2, 1, 1] - I[1, 2, 2]
sage: I.immaculate_function([0,2,3,2])
-I[1, 1, 3, 2] - I[1, 2, 2, 2] - I[1, 2, 3, 1] + I[2, 3, 2]
```


But I am not sure if this is faster than just going through the complete basis...
