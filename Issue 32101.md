Currently _is_preperiodic does not support dynamical systems defined on subschemes. This ticket aims to add support for morphisms of projective space defined over a subscheme.

This looks fine, but I think you should add an example showing the orbit leaving the subscheme failure:


```
P.<x,y,z> = ProjectiveSpace(QQ, 2)
X = P.subscheme(x)
f = DynamicalSystem([x^2 - y^2, y^2, z^2], domain=X)
p = X((0, 1, 0))
f._is_preperiodic(p, return_period=True)
```


- You also need to update the documentation for the .is_preperiodic() function exposed to users in projective_point.py. A subscheme example or two should be added there too.
