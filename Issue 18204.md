There is really no reason to make a difference between `base` and `standard` packages, except for the only truly "base" package `configure`.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18441

Hello Jeroen! I obviously have nothing against what you plan on doing, and I will probably give you a confirmation that what you want to do makes sense:

the reason why I created this 'base' category is that indeed not all packages were listed in the "Standard packages" list in the (former) build/install script. Some, like configure, bzip2 and others, were handled differently. In particular, all standard packages appear in the 'all-sage' Makefile rule, while the *base* ones do not.

That's the only reason. I know that I do not know enough about how this all works to change the Makefile's behaviour, so I kept trying to write scripts that generate a Makefile equivalent to the former version. Thus 'basic' packages, which you can of course remove as you know what you are doing far better than me.

That doesn't really matter. If those packages are dependencies of a standard package, they will be built anyway. So adding them to the `all-sage` rule doesn't make a difference.

Okay that's smart: we do not have to differentiate so often the standard/optional packages, we can just generate the rules and if some are never called, well, we do not have to care. Much cleaner code as a result, thanks!

Was it in 'needs_review'? If so, you can switch it to `postive_review`.
