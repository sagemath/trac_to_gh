# Issue 26965: py3: fix doctests in random graphs generators

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27202

Original creator: dcoudert

Original creation time: 2019-02-02 11:06:59

Keywords: py3, graph

We change doctests in `RandomBarabasiAlbert`, `RandomNewmanWattsStrogatz`, `RandomHolmeKim`, `RandomTreePowerlaw`, `RandomRegular` and `RandomShell`.

Several failing doctests in py3 were marked as `32-bit` or `64-bit`. Instead of adding extra tags, we change the doctests to more robust once, i.e., not depending of the precise list of edges.

We also take the opportunity to clean the methods.

at least one patchbot was not happy with

```
+        sage: G.degree_sequence()
+        [4, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2]
```

Maybe this should be removed or tagged #random ?
