We change doctests in `RandomBarabasiAlbert`, `RandomNewmanWattsStrogatz`, `RandomHolmeKim`, `RandomTreePowerlaw`, `RandomRegular` and `RandomShell`.

Several failing doctests in py3 were marked as `32-bit` or `64-bit`. Instead of adding extra tags, we change the doctests to more robust once, i.e., not depending of the precise list of edges.

We also take the opportunity to clean the methods.

at least one patchbot was not happy with

```
+        sage: G.degree_sequence()
+        [4, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2]
```
Maybe this should be removed or tagged #random ?
