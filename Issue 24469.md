to test things that should work already on py3. Then set up a buildbot to monitor regressions....

Here is my naive attempt. Help from experts is badly required..

Obviously, does not work

```
chapoton@icj-laptop:~/sage3$ make testpython3
export SAGE_PYTHON3=yes && \
build
/bin/sh: 2: build: not found
Makefile:129 : la recette pour la cible « testpython3 » a échouée
make: *** [testpython3] Erreur 127
```

Please elaborate. Exactly what should `make testpython3` do?

Did you mean `$(MAKE) build`?

Volker has asked (several times in sage-devel) that one creates such a make target to monitor progress on python3 sage.

For the moment, on vanilla-sage, only "make build" will work. Maybe one day one will add the html documentation construction and then also the tests..

If this is really meant only for the buildbot, can we make that explicit? For example, by using `buildbot-py3` as target name.

This does not build the doc. Is that intentional?


---

Comment by chapoton created at 2018-02-11 20:41:01

ok for changing the name of the target, sure.

As far as I can tell, html-doc does not build. Only Erik knows if we are close or not to 
achieve that.

Bikeshed: it looks a bit strange to put it in between the various test targets. positive_review if you move it to a more logical place inside the `Makefile` and you fill in the "Author" field on Trac.

Actually I don't know off the top of my head.  I don't think I've even tried :)

If sage doesn't start, it is no go anyway. I am still waiting for the fix to load libsingular properly to get in to see what breaks next.

in which ticket, this libsingular issue ?

What do you mean by "no go" ? It think it is rather important to prevent regression in the build process. This has just happened with subprocess32.

In `.PHONY`, it looks like you are using spaces instead of a TAB.

Thanks. But I have no idea of the syntax of makefiles. Would you please correct it ?

That was meant as an answer to question of building the doc. sage-on-gentoo does build with python3.6 routinely, it is part of my testing. So long as I cannot start a sage build with python3 there is no point in trying to build the doc. It will fail.

There were almost more commits than lines of code on this branch, so I squashed everything.

I question whether it's actually useful to have this in the makefile, but if you say it is well there's no harm in it.
