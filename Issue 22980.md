I was about to open a ticket about this too.  Here's my expanded description.  Note: The failure seems to be non-deterministic.

I've seen this once, too, on OS X:

```
[yasm-1.3.0] FAIL: modules/preprocs/raw/tests/rawpp_test.sh
```

This bug report seems to be the same issue: https://github.com/yasm/yasm/issues/87  I already confirmed that without running a parallel make job I can't reproduce the issue.  But with parallel make, the more jobs I add the more likely it is to fail.

I also got a failure in the rawpp_test.sh one once.

I don't think the exact cause of this is worth investigating too deeply, but this seems to be a reliable workaround.
