Assignee: jason, was

CC:  jason

This is an upgrade of the `is_unitary()` method, based on experience building `is_normal()`, `is_hermitian()`.  (#10848, #11104)

One test is discovering a bug elsewhere (#11248), so needs to be adjusted slightly to preserve that discovery, though at this writing, the test is disabled (#11277).

(a)  Adds a "orthonormal" variant, which is now the default, based on the Schur decomposition, an idea used in the other two methods, but not considered here previously.

(b)  Makes the existing naive algorithm a bit more efficent by using the break command twice.

(c)  Fixes an ommission in the naive algorithm where the loop on `i` previously did not start at zero.

(d) Upgraded error-checking on tolerance parameter.

(e) Docstring upgraded to reflect changes above.

**Depends on:**
1. #11027
2. #10848
3. #11277

Dear David,

Gotta love those one-character patches.  I'll get this reviewed as well.

Thanks for plowing though the "needs_rewview" backlog.
