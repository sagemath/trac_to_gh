debian stretch is past EOL (and past LTS support too). Are we dropping it?

This system can be inspected using `docker run -it docker.pkg.github.com/sagemath/sage/sage-docker-debian-stretch-standard-with-targets-optional:9.7.beta4 ./sage`

I don't think there's any urgency to drop it. 
I'd prefer that we detect bad nauty versions in configure
