Easy fix, but I'm not quite convinced.

The bug comes from the oeis database, see the weird invisible character `â�¨` at the end of the line `%Y A000217 A011782 counts compositions of any length.` of the page https://oeis.org/search?q=A000217&n=1&fmt=text

I think it is better to fix upstream database and keep some pressure on its quality instead of silently working around this typo on our side.

I am requesting an account on oeis to fix it.

I just submitted a fix upstream.

The change was accepted, so it works now. I think we should close the ticket without requesting your branch to be merged, what do you think ?

Was this particular sequence fixed, or was the phenomenon fixed altogether?

I just removed the wrong character, i do not have access to the whole database, so i can not say if such a typo exists elsewhere in the database.

Moving this ticket to 9.4, as it seems unlikely that it will be merged in 9.3, which is in the release candidate stage
