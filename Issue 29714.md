# Issue 29714: src/bin/sage-env: Make sage-env-config and SAGE_LOCAL optional

Currently, `sage-env` exits if it cannot find `sage-env-config`.
We make this configuration file (installed by `sage_conf` after #29850) optional.

Also, we make `SAGE_ROOT` and `SAGE_LOCAL` optional. If one is unset, we skip setting the various environment variables that depend on it. 

Both are for use in distribution packaging.

Hoping to get some feedback whether this change is helpful for distribution packaging

I cannot talk about other distros. I have stopped using and shipping `sage-env` a while back in Gentoo. I only set the following with a patch in the sage executable these days
 * SAGE_STARTUP_FILE
 * SAGE_RC_FILE
 * SAGE_DEBUG
 * SAGE_BROWSER

For the rest, whatever is in `env.py` or `sage_conf.py` is enough.

The main issue is that a lot of stuff in there is not that useful at runtime. You need `PATH` properly set and a few other in case you compile something from inside sage but most of the stuff in `sage-env` is not useful anymore once at run-time. I guess you may want to load the sage variables if you start `sage -sh` but that's it.

Let's get this in please, as a path toward unpatched installation of sagelib in downstream packaging.

Thank you for thinking of distribution needs.  Speaking for Fedora, I am in favor of this change.
