Let's get this in please - it's a scipy dependency (#34081)

Why is this scipy dependency? Does scipy use this package? Or does sage need this for installing scipy?

I couldn't see where this is used...

It is a dependency of `meson-python` which in turn is needed to build recent `scipy` (>1.9 if I am not mistaken).
