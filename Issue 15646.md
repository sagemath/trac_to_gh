I create tools to manipulate finite automaton : minimize, determinize, etc...
I create tools to manipulate beta-adic monoids (with eventually a subshift of finite type).
And you can compute finite automata from a beta-adic monoid (with or without subshift) : see http://www.latp.univ-mrs.fr/~paul.mercat/Publis/Semi-groupes%20fortement%20automatiques.pdf for more details.
You can use these tools to compute some data about some Rauzy fractals, as the Hausdorff dimension of the boundary.

Yes, thank you. I developped that before the existence of this class Automaton I think.
But there are better things with my implementation : the determinisation works better and I can determinise and take the complementary I one step that is better for what I do.
But I agree, I should use the class Automaton now.
