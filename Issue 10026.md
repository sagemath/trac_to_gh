# Issue 10026: simple server calls shouldn't print the code to log

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/10027

It seems that the simple server api prints the code to the server log.  This adds a huge amount of noise to the log when doing remote sagetex, for example.  By default, the simple server shouldn't print the code.

That's what the Sage cell is for, right, Jason?

Sure.  It doesn't work the same way, but you can do basically the same things.

Note that #11409 would remove this completely.
