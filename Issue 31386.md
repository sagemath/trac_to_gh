From https://groups.google.com/g/sage-release/c/6WjKQt_e_B8/m/dpx1qILOCwAJ:

GH Actions shows new errors in 9.3.rc2 that appear to be related to Singular. I have not seen them on a local machine.

Moving to 9.4, as 9.3 has been released.

Outdated. These failures no longer appear - https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/4611412604?check_suite_focus=true
