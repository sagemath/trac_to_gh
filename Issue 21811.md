What is the point of removing `cmp()` while keeping `__cmp__`?


---

Comment by chapoton created at 2016-12-12 09:52:24

As I may have already explained, my current aim is to be able to cythonize all our pyx files. For this, I only need to get rid of cmp() in a reasonable way. Same reason for tickets #22013 and #22019.

I think it makes little sense to change the same comparison function twice: once to get rid of `cmp()` and once to change `__cmp__` to `__richcmp__`. That seems like more work without much reason.

Replying to [comment:3 chapoton]:

If that is really your goal, I would just implement a "fake" `cmp()` function like this:

```
cdef int cmp(x, y) except -2:
    if x == y:
        return 0
    elif x < y:
        return -1
    else:
        return 1
```

I would prefer to avoid re-creating cmp, but I can bend if it is required.

In which file should I put this "custom cmp" function ?

I tried to used `__richcmp__` here, but this breaks pickling. Do you have any idea why ? Maybe something like "Non-identical instances of a class normally compare as non-equal unless the class defines the `__eq__()` method." ? Can this be solved ?

Can you push your branch where you do `__richcmp__` (not necessarily setting the branch field of this ticket of course)?

Comment by chapoton created at 2016-12-13 19:32:23

a branch with richmp is available at u/chapoton/experiment_22048

So my guess is that Cython tries to find a `__cmp__`, and if it doesn't, then (unlike Python) does not use `__richcmp__`. For proper `Element` classes, then there is a default `__cmp__`, which redirects appropriately to `_richcmp_`.

However, I'm not sure if this could be considered a bug of Cython, if it something we just have to work around (temporarily until Cython gets this as a feature), or we just have `__cmp__` in Cython classes because it is a different language. Jeroen, any comments?

It's not "Cython" which has to implement that: it's Python who decides which comparison function to call. So, it cannot be a bug in Cython.

I would put it in `sage_object.pxd` where we already have various functions involving comparisons. However, I don't know exactly how we can ensure that this is only used in Python 3.

Maybe a simpler solution would be to patch Cython such that it does recognize `cmp()` in Python 3.

so what is the conclusion for the ticket here ? should I just implement `__eq__` ?


---

Comment by tscrim created at 2016-12-15 05:44:18

Ah, I see my misunderstanding, it is precisely because it is a _Python_ class, not a `cdef` Cython class why `__richcmp__` is not called. So, I'm thinking that is what needs to happen: we should implement a `__eq__` and `__ne__`.


---

Comment by chapoton created at 2016-12-15 09:20:14

Once I introduced `__eq__` and `__ne__`, do I need to keep the `__richcmp__` or is it completely useless ?

The `__richcmp__` is something that is only used by `cdef` classes, so in this case it is useless.
