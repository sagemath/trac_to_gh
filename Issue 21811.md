I think it makes little sense to change the same comparison function twice: once to get rid of `cmp()` and once to change `__cmp__` to `__richcmp__`. That seems like more work without much reason.

> my current aim is to be able to cythonize all our pyx files.

If that is really your goal, I would just implement a "fake" `cmp()` function like this:

```
cdef int cmp(x, y) except -2:
    if x == y:
        return 0
    elif x < y:
        return -1
    else:
        return 1
```

In which file should I put this "custom cmp" function ?

It's not "Cython" which has to implement that: it's Python who decides which comparison function to call. So, it cannot be a bug in Cython.

I would put it in `sage_object.pxd` where we already have various functions involving comparisons. However, I don't know exactly how we can ensure that this is only used in Python 3.

Maybe a simpler solution would be to patch Cython such that it does recognize `cmp()` in Python 3.
