Currently, the `polytopes.cube` and `polytopes.hypercube`s use vertex coordinates +/-1. It would be nice to have the 0/1 cube and the 0/1 hypercube. This ticket adds them to the library of polytopes.

Yes, yes, that's the idea; making it inside `cube` and `hypercube` was the intended plan.

I am not sure whether to also include:

> {{{
> [x1,y1] x [x2,y2] x ... x [xd,yd]
> }}}

as well in there. One could try. 


There are many ways to interpret `x` above. There is `polytopes.zonotope` which does:


```
sage: corner = vector([1,2,3,4])
sage: directions = diagonal_matrix([10,9,8,7]).columns()
sage: z = polytopes.zonotope(directions).translation(corner)
sage: z.vertices_list()
[[1, 2, 3, 4],
 [1, 2, 3, 11],
 [1, 2, 11, 4],
 [1, 2, 11, 11],
 [1, 11, 3, 4],
 [1, 11, 3, 11],
 [1, 11, 11, 4],
 [1, 11, 11, 11],
 [11, 2, 3, 4],
 [11, 2, 3, 11],
 [11, 2, 11, 4],
 [11, 2, 11, 11],
 [11, 11, 3, 4],
 [11, 11, 3, 11],
 [11, 11, 11, 4],
 [11, 11, 11, 11]]
sage: hc = polytopes.hypercube(4)
sage: z.is_combinatorially_isomorphic(hc)
True
```


That said, I see that it might be nice to have this directly possible inside of `cube` and `hypercube`...

Looks mostly good. Some comments:

- In the docstring of `cube` remove empty line and unindent the output of `cc.vertices_list()`.
- `three intervals of length 2`: Do not specify the length of interval.
- Instead of `vectors in `\RR^{\text{dim}}` one could specify the length or dimension of the vectors, to account for the polyhedron to be constructed in `ZZ` or `QQ`.
- I would maybe move the test of the error `the dimension of the hypercube must match the number of intervals` to tests. I don't think it is very interesting for the user.
