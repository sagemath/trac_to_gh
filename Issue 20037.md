# Issue 20037: LatticePoset: trivial additions

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20274

Original creator: jmantysalo

Original creation time: 2016-03-24 09:14:40

CC:  tscrim

Keywords: latticeposet

Few problems at finiten lattices: 1) Operators `+` and `*` for meet and join are not documented, 2) example of `breadth()` is stupid as it just `BoolenaLattice(4)` and 3) `is_supersolvable()` fails for empty lattice. This patch corrects those.

Travis selected by random generator as a possible reviewer.

(My list of people to randomly choise is quite small...)

Two things:

- Should be `- ``x`` --`
- I (still) disagree with this type of change:
  {{{#!diff
-        Return ``True`` if ``self`` is a supersolvable lattice and
+        Return ``True`` if the lattice is supersolvable and
  }}}

Done those.

Duh. Done that. Now it is inconsistent with other functions in the file. We should have a style guide for this kind of things.

There is an on-going debate about whether to refer to ```self``` in any docstring (guess what side I am on :P). However you should remove the comma `,` before the `and` to be (English) grammatically correct (as `otherwise ``False``` is not a complete sentence).

OK. I don't have strong opinion, but if I must choose, then no `self`s in docstring. Most important is to make a choose and stick on it.

> However you should remove the comma `,` before the `and` to be (English) grammatically correct (as `otherwise ``False``` is not a complete sentence).

Done that. However, almost every docstring has the same problem. I didn't touch them now.
