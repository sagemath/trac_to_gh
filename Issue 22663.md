# Issue 22663: Implement derivation module basis for algebras

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22900

Original creator: tscrim

Original creation time: 2017-04-29 04:06:28

We provide a method to compute the basis for the derivations of an algebra.

The next step after this will be to construct the derivations as a Lie algebra as a separate parent.

ok. You can set to positive if you agree with my last commit, fixing more pyflakes warnings (but not the last one, which is more subtle).
