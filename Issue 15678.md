Daniel Cabarcas looked at the C part of the code, here is what he said (and my reply which I sent via e-mail)

My idea was to include the discrete Gaussian sampler over lattices (+ cosets)
into this implementation. Hence the name. However, for that I needed to do #15976 first. I plan to go back to the samplers over the lattices once both tickets
are merged (and I can rely on them).

I haven't thought about Knuth-Yao or Ziggurat, do you have any good references at hand? I'm happy to implement more samplers, might as well be comprehensive. I was also thinking about extending the logtable approach to arbitrary Gaussian parameters sigma.

As for the interface, I guess I should check the two algorithms you mentioned above to see what would need to be generalised. If other parameters are needed in the future I can simply add another constructor which accepts those parameters, that was my thinking anyway.

I currently have two versions, one using GMP's randstate and one using libc. GMP should give cryptographically strong pseudorandom numbers. In my experience the difference in running time is - as you write - pretty much down to how long it takes to sample random numbers, so I figured I offer one with a good random number generator and one with a fast which is good enough for testing.

Comment by mmarco created at 2014-06-26 04:17:28

I don't feel able to review all the code, but testing it seems to work ok.

I just think it would make sense for the samplers over the polynomials to accept the polynomial ring as an input.

Comment by saraedum created at 2014-06-28 07:14:06

Some comments/questions:

In the `fmpz_poly` linkage: What is the except -2 good for? Do these flint methods return -2 on error? Shouldn't you use sig_on()/sig_off() rather?

What is the reason for the following in `Polynomial_integer_dense_flint`?

```
- elif not isinstance(x, list):
-    x = [x] # constant polynomials
+ else:
+    try:
+       x = list(x)
+    except TypeError:
+       x = [x] # constant polynomials
```


In `polynomial_quotient_ring.py`, why don't you use `r"""` so you can write `\ZZ`? Also, there are now a lot of unicode characters; even though you put an encoding in the header, my vim does not understand these characters (strangely) and they also confused the patchbot.

I stopped reading at `dgs.h`. Would you mind relicensing this as GPLv2+? Should such things not be in an SPKG? I wonder if the amount of documentation is sufficient for including it directly in Sage and also if anybody can really review this (I cannot review that part I'm afraid.)

It seems you were working off the wrong branch. Your branch has 

   `polynomial_quotient_integer_dense_flint.pyx`

in it, which it shouldn't ... oh, looks like I pushed to the wrong branch at some point. Sorry, I'll fix that.

It's the standard signature of `clement_*` functions used by polynomial templates. Specifiying -2 there allows to throw exceptions in C functions. This code wasn't meant to be in this ticket, though, see above. My apologies. The code in question belonged to #16574 but has been removed.

This code wasn't meant to be in this ticket, my apologoies. It belongs in #16574. It allows `R(tuple(x))` and `R(vector(x))` to go through. 

> In `polynomial_quotient_ring.py`, why don't you use `r"""` so you can write `\ZZ`? 

I could do that, I find the other notation more straight-forward, is there a particular reason why one is preferable to the other?

> Also, there are now a lot of unicode characters; even though you put an encoding in the header, my vim does not understand these characters (strangely) and they also confused the patchbot.

I can remove them but that'd make the code less readable IMHO.
 
> I stopped reading at `dgs.h`. Would you mind relicensing this as GPLv2+? 

I have no strong feelings either way, what would be the advantage? I am quite happy with the code being BSD, it's not very sophisticated and BSD licensing it allows anyone to use it.

> Should such things not be in an SPKG? 

The C code really does only one thing, so an SPKG would be a bit of an overkill. Also, SPKG's take votes and extra bureaucracy. I'd like to avoid that, it's hard enough to get this stuff reviewed.

> I wonder if the amount of documentation is sufficient for including it directly in Sage and also if anybody can really review this (I cannot review that part I'm afraid.)

Daniel Cabarcas reviewed the C part. I can add more documentation.

A few questions (line numbers are all in the version I pushed):

* Should it really be x-2 in line 518 of dgs_gauss.h?

* What is the TODO in dgs_gauss_dp.c?

* `self->c_r = 0.0;` after an abort() in line 114 and 130 of dgs_gaus_dp.c?

* What is "this B" in line 186 of discrete_gaussian_lattice.py?

It should read x-c, fixed.

> * What is the TODO in dgs_gauss_dp.c?

This was a left-over, removed.

Removed.

I should have fixed the 32-bit issues. 

I would guess these additional patches **need review** again as they are not mere documentation/doctest fixes, but changes to the code.

I set the ticket to **needs info** because the first doctest failure is still unaccounted for (see above).

Hi, thanks for providing this. I've just committed a "fix". With precision='dp' results are not reproducible (our random seed does not control C's random()). I clarified this a bit more in the documentation and increased the allowed bound. Unfortunately, on the only 32-bit machine I have access to, I cannot reproduce the doctest failure, so I can ask you to run it again?

Comment by nbruin created at 2014-08-18 15:01:34

The name `DiscreteGaussianIntegerSampler` might be a bit confusing to some people: at first reading it seems you're sampling from the Gaussian integers (which are discrete).

Wouldn't `DiscreteGaussianDistributionSampler` be a more descriptive name? I get the impression that Discrete Gaussian Distribution is normally used for the distributions on the integers you're referring to.

The fact that you truncate at `tau*sigma` also seems to disqualify this from legitimately being called "sampling from a discrete gaussian distribution", but I hope this is standard abuse of terminology in the field (and the difference is hard to see).

It also suggests that if the rejection rate is high (it would be for larger values of `tau`) it might be worth sampling from a binomial distribution with adapted rejection rates. The shape should be much closer to your desired distribution and hence should lead to a much lower rejection rate. It depends a bit on whether the new rejection probabilities are sufficiently easy to compute to be worth it.

The name was chosen to allow for samplers over lattices and polynomial rings as well: `DiscreteGaussianLatticeSampler` and `DiscreteGaussianPolynomialSampler`.

I can change it to `DiscreteGaussianDistributionIntegerSampler` or something if I get a commitment that this change is reviewed in a timely fashion. This patch has had a hard time getting reviewed so I am not opening it up again lightly.

> The fact that you truncate at `tau*sigma` also seems to disqualify this from legitimately being called "sampling from a discrete gaussian distribution", but I hope this is standard abuse of terminology in the field (and the difference is hard to see).

The difference is hard to see due to the tail bound. Roughly: Pr[x <- D | |x| > C*sigma] <= 2/(C sqrt(2*pi)) * exp(-C<sup>2</sup>/2). This is also the standard approach in the literature.

> It also suggests that if the rejection rate is high (it would be for larger values of `tau`) it might be worth sampling from a binomial distribution with adapted rejection rates. The shape should be much closer to your desired distribution and hence should lead to a much lower rejection rate. It depends a bit on whether the new rejection probabilities are sufficiently easy to compute to be worth it.

Sampling from other distributions has been considered in the literature. The "sigma2+logtable" algorithm is a result of such an investigation in:

Running `sage -t --global-iterations 100 src/sage/stats/distributions/discrete_gaussian_integer.pyx` on 32-bit Archlinux passes.

Here are the last circa 210 lines of output in abbreviated form:

Apart from this ticket's branch, I have also merged those of tickets #15316 and #16480, as I need those for building.

Thanks for running those. As far as I can tell, this means for you, too, doctests pass.

I renamed `DiscreteGaussianIntegerSampler` to `DiscreteGaussianDistributionIntegerSampler`. Nils, can you review this commit?
