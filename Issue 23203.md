1. `__div__ = __truediv__` is a bad idea for extension types because it acts on the *Python* method level and not on the *slot* level:

```
sage: F = CombinatorialFreeModule(QQ, [1,2,3]); B = F.basis(); f = 2*B[2] + 4*B[3]
sage: op = operator.truediv; timeit('op(f, 2)', repeat=100000, number=20)
20 loops, best of 100000: 4.99 µs per loop
sage: op = operator.div; timeit('op(f, 2)', repeat=100000, number=20)
20 loops, best of 100000: 5.45 µs per loop
```


2. `IndexedFreeModuleElement` and `LieAlgebraElement` implement arithmetic methods as `cdef _add_` while every other class in Sage uses `cpdef _add_`.

LGTM. Thank you for cleaning it up. The last part is also useful for #22591 (although I think there is more of a shortcomming of `*ModuleAction` in play, but this works around the problem).
