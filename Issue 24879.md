In #21003, we added support for PySCIPOpt and added scip as a optional MILP-solver. 
The solver SCIP can also handle //nonlinear// programs. There are also other nonlinear solvers available, such as Couenne from coin-or https://projects.coin-or.org/Couenne/.

I suggest to add a new class MixedIntegerNonlinearProgram, simliar to the 
 class `MixedIntegerLinearProgram`, which can handle nonlinear constraints. One can also think about special treatment for quadratic constraints, and possibly convex optimization. 

For this new class, there should be a generic backend. As soon as this is ready, we can build on top of this ticket to get backends for scip and couenne. 

Comments and suggestions welcome!
