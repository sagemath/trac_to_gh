Loading Sage library. Current Mercurial branch is: ref2
sage: R.<t> = ZZ[[]]
sage: f = 1 + 17*t - 4*t^3 + O(t^5)
sage: f[1] = 10
...
IndexError: power series are immutable
```
Except they are mutable:

```
sage: f *= 2
sage: f
2 + 34*t - 8*t^3 + O(t^5)
```
But they shouldn't be!  The `_imul_` method needs to be deleted.


Component: **basic arithmetic**

The code has nothing to do with mutability. 

sage: a= (1,2,3)

a is a tuple, an immutable object

sage: a += a
sage: a
(1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3)

sage: R.<t> = ZZ[[]]
sage: f = 1 + 17*t - 4*t^3 + O(t^5)
sage: g=f
sage: g is f
True
sage: f+=f
sage: f
2 + 34*t - 8*t^3 + O(t^5)
sage: g
1 + 17*t - 4*t^3 + O(t^5)
sage: f is g
False
