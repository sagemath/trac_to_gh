 ring rr=0,(x,y),wp(2,3);

 deg(f);

 poly g = x^3*y+y^3;
 ideal I = f,g;
 std(I);
 _[1]=y3+x2
 _[2]=x3y-x2
 _[3]=x5+x2y2
 ```

> But not in SAGE:


```
sage: T = TermOrder("wp(2,3)")
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: wp(2,3) is not a valid term ordering
```

```
sage: R.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(QQ,2,T)
sage: R._singular_()
//   characteristic : 0
//   number of vars : 2
//        block   1 : ordering dp
//                  : names    x y
//        block   2 : ordering C
