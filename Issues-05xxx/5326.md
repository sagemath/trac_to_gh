 ```
  ring rr=0,(x,y),wp(2,3);
  poly f=x2+y3;
  deg(f);
  9
  poly g = x^3*y+y^3;
  ideal I = f,g;
  std(I);
  _[1]=y3+x2
  _[2]=x3y-x2
  _[3]=x5+x2y2
 ```

> But not in SAGE:


```
 sage: T = TermOrder("wp(2,3)")
 Traceback (most recent call last):
 ...
 TypeError: wp(2,3) is not a valid term ordering
```

```
sage: R.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(QQ,2,T)
sage: R._singular_()
//   characteristic : 0
//   number of vars : 2
//        block   1 : ordering dp
//                  : names    x y
//        block   2 : ordering C
