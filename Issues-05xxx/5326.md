 ideal I = f,g;
 std(I);

```
sage: T = TermOrder("wp(2,3)")
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: wp(2,3) is not a valid term ordering
```

```
sage: R.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(QQ,2,T)
sage: R._singular_()
//   characteristic : 0
//   number of vars : 2
//        block   1 : ordering dp
//                  : names    x y
