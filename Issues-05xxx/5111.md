Should we change axiom.py to fricas.py and the axiom command to fricas.  

**For the change:** This is more logical since the doctests test fricas not axiom.  Also, this has been specifically requested by Tim Daly -- the trademark owner on the name Axiom.

**Against the change:** We have an *axiom* interface already.  The trademark on "Axiom" does not mean that we can't legally use the word for the command name in our program. Our interface to sage is an interface to axiom, fricas, etc. 

Component: **interfaces**

Mike,

Thanks. I have successfully applied this patch to sage-3.4.alpha0 and have just begun testing. I noticed however that patch returned the warning:

patching file sage/structure/sage_object.pyx
Hunk #1 succeeded at 305 (offset 7 lines)

So I guess there has already by some code drift.

The first bug I noticed was that

  ./sage -fricas

does not start a FriCAS session.

  ./sage -axiom

however still starts FriCAS even though /usr/local/axiom has been replaced with a dummy script.

I guess this command line processing must be done in some other part of sage?

Regards,
Bill Page.

Mike,

On my Debian 5.0 (Lenny) x86 system I have not been able to compile recent versions of Axiom from source using the instructions here:

  http://axiom.axiom-developer.org/axiom-website/download.html

I get build errors early in the process. What did you use to get the "January 2009 release of Axiom" referred to in your tests?

After installing the binary version of Axiom via

```
  apt-get install axiom
```
I do get the older "2005" version of Axiom which does seem to run ok (known problems with Hyperdoc etc. notwithstanding). However this version seems to have pexpect synchronization problems.

```
  sage: axiom('1+1')

  sage:
```
returns no visible result, while

```
  sage: fricas('1+1')
  2
  sage:
```
behaves as expected.

I think the problem is probably caused by the differences in readline behavior under gcl and/or minor differences in the initial prompts. I am not sure how to handle this so long as we depend on an externally installed version of Axiom. If Sage is going to continue to support Axiom as an option, perhaps some effort needs to be given to creating an optional Axiom spkg ... (Don't look at me! :-). Otherwise, I would not be against getting rid of the 'axiom' function all together.

On this same subject: What consideration, if any, has been given to providing a similar interface for OpenAxiom? Does anyone want this?

Bill Page.

I just used the binary found here: http://www.axiom-developer.org/axiom-website/downloads/axiom-ubuntu64-jan2009-bin.tgz

I think Camm is updating the version of Axiom in Debian.  It'd be silly not to have some support since it's very little extra work.

I don't know -- I don't really use this software.  It should be pretty trivial to add support for.

Here is a patch (trac_5111b.patch) that disables readline support for Axiom. With this change the axiom interface now works for me.

Also, I discovered that I was able to compile Axiom from the January 2009 source tarball. I still have a problem compiling the git or cvs head version on Debian 5.0.

Re: Axiom binaries on Debian instead of an spkg. Is there any other case in Sage where an interface is provided from something that is not available for install as an spkg? I thought this might be a Sage policy.

I did a fairly fast skim of the code (I didn't study it), and tested the axiom interface on my computer (against an old version of axiom).  A couple of doctests failed with slightly different printing than expected (probably because the axiom version was old; the answer was correct, only the printing was wrong), but almost all of them passed.

Positive review (apply both patches).
