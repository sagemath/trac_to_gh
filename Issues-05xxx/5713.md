I just tried to plot a multigraph with setting positions of vertices,

G=Graph({'a':['a','b','b','b','e'],'b':['c','d','e'],'c':
['c','d','d','d'],'d':['e']})

G.show(pos={'a':[0,1],'b':[1,1],'c':[2,0],'d':[1,0],'e':[0,0]})

and got an error

 File "/home/alec/sage/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/sage/graphs/
graph_plot.py", line 459, in set_edges
   odd_y = M[1] + d
NameError: global name 'd' is not defined

Without pos both show and plot work OK.

Is this a high priority issue? I am not convinced and since there is no patch and no sign of anyone working on fixing this I am bumping this to 3.4.2.

Cheers,
