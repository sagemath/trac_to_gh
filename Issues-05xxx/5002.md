This patch fixes three bugs.

First, there is the bug originally reported in this ticket.
Second, there is the bug described at
http://groups.google.com/group/sage-combinat-devel/msg/bce932c675b8b04a?hl=en
Third, it fixes an exception on 
`Partition([]).outside_corners()`.

In addition there are a lot of documentation improvements.

The new class CrystalOfWords needs a docstring. Otherwise I found no problems.

The patch does not change the effect of `sage --testall`.

The patch applies cleanly on sage-3.4.1.rc1.

Patch summary:

```
Adds index_set as a lazy_attribute method in class Crystal.
Removes class AffineCrystal which was prematurely implemented
Replaces the cmp_elements method => lt_elements in ClassicalCrystalOfLetters.
Implements `__ne__`, `__lt__`, `__ge__` methods in class Letter.
Properly indents docstrings for TensorProductOfCrystals.
New class CrystalOfWords.
FullTensorProductOfCrystals inherits from CrystalOfWords.
call method of FullTensorProductOfCrystals is taken down.
CrystalOfTableaux inherits from CrystalOfWords.
Docstring revision for CrystalOfTableaux.
CrystalOfTableaux `__init__` method allows multiple shapes.
CrystalOfTableaux gets new methods cartan_type and module_generator
CrystalOfTableauxElement `__init__` revisions
```

Peace. The lazy_attribute here is just a temporary workaround. Anne precisely did send an e-mail
to the mailing list 2 days ago asking for confirmation for changing it systematically to a method
in all the crystal library. This will come as a subsequent patch.

Refactoring all the crap in the combinatorics code will take a while. No need to jump on every occasion to repeat the same arguments. We have heard them, and fully taken points for them.

That being said, I still think that lazy attributes have their role to play in some well localized places in the user interface. I will run a complete discussion about this when time is ready for it. And the final code will follow whatever consensus emerges.
