I tried to use dsage with the `@`parallel directory and sage-3.4, and it's 100% broken.  The log just spews forever:

```

```

Using `@`parallel and multiprocessing for what I want to do (just some simple no-pexpect C library stuff involving modular symbols) doesn't work either, since I get weird pari_trap error exceptions:

```
Exception in thread Thread-6:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/wstein/sage/local/lib/python2.5/threading.py", line 486, in __bootstrap_inner
    self.run()
  File "/home/wstein/sage/local/lib/python2.5/threading.py", line 446, in run
    self.__target(*self.__args, **self.__kwargs)
  File "/home/wstein/sage/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/processing/pool.py", line 232, in _handleResults
    for job, i, obj in iter(get, None):
  File "/home/wstein/sage/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/sage/libs/pari/gen_py.py", line 59, in pari
    return gen.pari(x)
  File "gen.pyx", line 9125, in sage.libs.pari.gen._pari_trap (sage/libs/pari/gen.c:39083)
PariError:  (7)

```

It is so sad, that after all these years and all this work to write code to run things in parallel, that even the most trivial basic thing that I would like to do in parallel, which is evaluate a function on a bunch of integer inputs, still doesn't work robustly.
