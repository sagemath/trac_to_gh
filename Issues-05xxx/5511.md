The attached worksheet implements and illustrates arbitrary mesh functions for 3d graphics objects that are triangulated.  This could probably ought to go into sage somewhere.

Here is an example:

Bill,

If I can take the liberty of CCing you on this, it sounds like something you might be interested in.  At least, if you are going to work a lot more on the low-level graphics stuff, it'd be great if we could support arbitrary mesh functions, like mathematica or this worksheet, for example.
