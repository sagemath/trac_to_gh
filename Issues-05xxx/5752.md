Cool example in the docstring, though of course that the sudoku command at the top level takes forever on this hard one is a bummer.  I wish there were a better solver in sage..

```
sage: B = matrix(ZZ, 9, 9, [ [0,0,0,0,1,0,9,0,0], [8,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0], [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], [0,7,0,0,3,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,4], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,8], [0,6,0,0,0,0,1,3,0], [7,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0] ])
sage: sudoku(B)
[wait forever...]
```

Very nice job adding doctests!!

> I wish there were a better solver in sage..

I did have some thoughts about that while working through this...

> ` [wait forever...] `

I did eventually get a solution on that one, but didn't go back to do a timing on it!
