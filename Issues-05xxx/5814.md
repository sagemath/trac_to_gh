The prun functionality -- which is really the python profiler -- could be used in the notebook by people who know enough about how the profiler works under the hood.  %prun is just IPython's wrapper around Python's standard profiler to make it easier to use.

    "body": "<a id='comment:12'></a>It's probably outside the scope of this ticket, but the *really* useful thing would be if `%prun ...` in the notebook would return an interactive browser for the `Stat` object that is returned by `cProfile().runctx(...)`. While a basic printout of profiling data gives some indication, one usually needs to dig around a little in the data to find what the real bottleneck is (see where most calls come from, switch between cumulative and proper time, etc.)\n\nWriting such a browser might be a nice exercise for a student who is interested in interface programming.
