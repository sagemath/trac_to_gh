I'm changing this to an enhancement.  It's not a bug that "random" ipython features don't work in the notebook.  There's no reason they should until they get implemented.

The prun functionality -- which is really the python profiler -- could be used in the notebook by people who know enough about how the profiler works under the hood.  %prun is just IPython's wrapper around Python's standard profiler to make it easier to use.

Just wanting to make sure that this patch ready for review, there are a few people here at Sage Days 45 that would like this feature. (Also do you know someone who would have the expertise to do a full review?)

My quick comment is that you'll need to give doctests to your functions.

Thanks,

Travis

While a basic printout of profiling data gives some indication, one usually needs to dig around a little in the data to find what the real bottleneck is (see where most calls come from, switch between cumulative and proper time, etc.)\n\nWriting such a browser might be a nice exercise for a student who is interested in interface programming. I bet there are good profiler browsers around to get inspiration from.\n\nA tool I haven't used yet but looks like a decent effort is [runsnakerun](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/RunSnakeRun). Duplicating that effort for the sage notebook might not seem like such a smart idea. Perhaps we can make the tool more easily accessible from sage? Given that it uses wxPython that might not be so very easily done ... I ended up installing it using OS tools, meaning that I *have* to write the profile data to a file and analyse it separately.",

It's probably outside the scope of this ticket, but the *really* useful thing would be if `%prun ...` in the notebook would return an interactive browser for the `Stat` object that is returned by `cProfile().runctx(...)`. While a basic printout of profiling data gives some indication, one usually needs to dig around a little in the data to find what the real bottleneck is (see where most calls come from, switch between cumulative and proper time, etc.)

Writing such a browser might be a nice exercise for a student who is interested in interface programming. I bet there are good profiler browsers around to get inspiration from.

A tool I haven't used yet but looks like a decent effort is [runsnakerun](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/RunSnakeRun). Duplicating that effort for the sage notebook might not seem like such a smart idea. Perhaps we can make the tool more easily accessible from sage? Given that it uses wxPython that might not be so very easily done ... I ended up installing it using OS tools, meaning that I *have* to write the profile data to a file and analyse it separately.

In the notebook I get 3 function calls

```
         3 function calls in 0.007 seconds

   Ordered by: standard name

   ncalls  tottime  percall  cumtime  percall filename:lineno(function)
        1    0.007    0.007    0.007    0.007 <string>:1(<module>)

```
with the command line:

```
         3 function calls in 0.000 seconds

   Ordered by: standard name

   ncalls  tottime  percall  cumtime  percall filename:lineno(function)

So it's something specific to the doctesting framework that's not reflected in sage while it's directly running (I've noticed this in a few other places before too).
