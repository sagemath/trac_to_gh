I'm changing this to an enhancement.  It's not a bug that "random" ipython features don't work in the notebook.  There's no reason they should until they get implemented.

The prun functionality -- which is really the python profiler -- could be used in the notebook by people who know enough about how the profiler works under the hood.  %prun is just IPython's wrapper around Python's standard profiler to make it easier to use.

Just wanting to make sure that this patch ready for review, there are a few people here at Sage Days 45 that would like this feature. (Also do you know someone who would have the expertise to do a full review?)

My quick comment is that you'll need to give doctests to your functions.

Thanks,

Travis

In the notebook I get 3 function calls

```
         3 function calls in 0.007 seconds

   Ordered by: standard name

   ncalls  tottime  percall  cumtime  percall filename:lineno(function)
        1    0.007    0.007    0.007    0.007 <string>:1(<module>)

```
with the command line:

```
         3 function calls in 0.000 seconds

   Ordered by: standard name

   ncalls  tottime  percall  cumtime  percall filename:lineno(function)
        1    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 <string>:1(<module>)

So it's something specific to the doctesting framework that's not reflected in sage while it's directly running (I've noticed this in a few other places before too).
