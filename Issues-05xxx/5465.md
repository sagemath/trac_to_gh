REFEREE REPORT



The patch **trac_5465_1.patch** applies OK against Sage 3.4, all doctests pass with the `-long` option as well. Since the purpose of the patch is to add more meaningful error messages, I tried to get those two more meaningful messages. First, for the case where the number of generators is < 3:

```
sage: # first for the case of S.ngens() < 3...
sage: R.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(QQ,2)
sage: G = R.ideal([y^3 - x^2, y^2 - 13*x]).groebner_fan()
sage: G.render()
For 2-D fan rendering the polynomial ring must have 3 variables (or more, which are ignored).
ERROR: An unexpected error occurred while tokenizing input
The following traceback may be corrupted or invalid
The error message is: ('EOF in multi-line statement', (118, 0))

Yep, the error message is certainly now more comprehensible than something like `UnboundLocalError` which misses the main point that the number of generators is not of the required size.  Now, for the case where the number of generators is not 4:

```
sage: # second, for the case of S.ngens() != 4...

   1073         g_cones = [q.groebner_cone() for q in self.reduced_groebner_bases()]
   1074         g_cones_facets = [q.facets() for q in g_cones]

NotImplementedError:
```
Again, I see a `NotImplementedError` which is certainly more comprehensible than the error message reported above by William Stein. And finally, given the correct number of generators, we have a nice Groebner fan :-) Positive review for the problem that the patch fixes.

Well, to be absolutely pedantic: Shouldn't we add doctests that check the error messages being raised?

I am happy to merge the patch "as is", but if someone wanted to submit such a patch I would not be unhappy ;)
