From sage-support:

Viewing block matrices "nicely" seems to be difficult in Sage. 

```
sage: A=matrix([[1]]) 
sage: B=matrix([[2]]) 
sage: C=matrix([[3]]) 
sage: D=matrix([[4]]) 
sage: BM=block_matrix([A,B,C,D]) 
sage: BM 
[1|2] 
[-+-] 
[3|4] 
```
Okay, this is fine but a little clunky.  Let's try something nicer: 

```
sage: show(BM) 
```
Upon which a dvi viewer opens up, unfortunately not a very nice one... 
and shows the block matrix with only a vertical dividing line, not a 
horizontal one! 
Okay, let's try the notebook: 

```
A=matrix([[1]]) 
B=matrix([[2]]) 
C=matrix([[3]]) 
D=matrix([[4]]) 

BM=block_matrix([A,B,C,D]);BM 

[1|2] 
[-+-] 
[3|4] 
``` 

So far so good, but when I click "Typeset" to get a LaTeXed matrix... 

```
BM=block_matrix([A,B,C,D]);BM 

<html><span class="math">\left(\begin{array}{r|r} 
1 & 2 \\ 
3 & 4 
\end{array}\right)</span></html> 
``` 
Which as you can see does NOT have any "blockiness" to it at all. 
Very pretty, but not a block matrix, at least not identifiably so.

Any ideas on what to do in the notebook?

I don't know if it is satisfactory, either, but I couldn't come up with anything better, so I've implemented this for the notebook version.  This ignores repeated subdivisions, because I couldn't come up with a good way to display them: in the notebook, if you do

```
B = matrix(2,2)
B.subdivide([1], [])
C = matrix(2,2)
C.subdivide([1,1], [])
```
then B and C will be typeset identically.  The command-line versions look different, though.

I think your solution for block matrices in the notebook is a good idea, at least until jsmath supports the standard way.
