# Issue 5731: Update NTL to 5.5.2 release (latest upstream)

* Fixed a relatively benign indexing bug in `GF2EX` discovered by Berend-Benjamin Tams using the `valgrind` tool. 


## 2009.05.05: Changes between NTL 5.5 and 5.5.1

* If using GMP (via either `NTL_GMP_LIP` or `NTL_GMP_HACK`), then the new version (4.3.0) of GMP implements the `XGCD` functionality differently, so that the coefficients do not always agree with those returned by the classical extended Euclidean algorithm.

## 2009.04.08: Changes between NTL 5.4.2 and 5.5

* Added the ability to generate a *shared* library (with help from Tim Abbott). [Details.](http://www.shoup.net/ntl/doc/tour-unix.html#shared)
* Fixed some standardization issues (with help from Tim Abbott): default location of installed documentation files now conforms to standards; use of `EOF` now conforms to standards.

* Fixed a bug in `void TraceMod(zz_p& x, const zz_pX& a, const zz_pXModulus& F)` (reported by Luca De Feo).
* Fixed a performance issue in various versions of `SetCoeff` (reported by Luca De Feo).
* Fixed the declaration of `mat_zz_p transpose(const mat_zz_p& a)` (reported by Benoit Lacelle).

So we should be able to drop a couple custom patches.

two things. 
* trac is not a place to attach spkg. 
* why is it .p1? It should just be ntl-5.5.2.spkg

Other than that I have no doubts that it works out of the box personally, and you save me from creating a spkg.

I have been using ntl-5.5.2 in sage-on-gentoo since

```
     Mon Nov  9 10:55:35 2009 >>> dev-libs/ntl-5.5.2
       merge time: 10 minutes and 27 seconds.                                                                                       
```
the following depend on ntl:
* flint
* singular
* linbox
* eclib
* sage (through c_lib and several extensions so sage -ba is required)

I have rebuild/updated all of those since 2009 so I don't expect any shocking results.

I started with a fresh build of 4.7.1.alpha0 which passes all tests;  built the new spkg here (with SAGE_CHECK=yes"); did "sage -ba" followed by "sage -t -long", and all tests pass.

The spkg itself is ok (though there's a typo "numbery" in the README, and William should probably not be the only spkg maintainer listed), so I am giving this a positive review and hop that it can go into the next alpha form 4.7.1.
