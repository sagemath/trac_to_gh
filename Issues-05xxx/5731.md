## 2009.08.14: Changes between NTL 5.5.1 and 5.5.2

* New routines `MulAddTo` and `MulSubFrom` for computing `x += a*b` and `x -= a*b`, where `x` and `a` are `ZZ`'s and `b` is a `ZZ` or a `long`. In the case where `b` is a `long`, this may be much faster than writing `mul(t, a, b); add(x, x, t)`. See [ZZ.txt](http://www.shoup.net/ntl/doc/ZZ.txt) for details. These new routines are used in a number of places in NTL to get faster algorithms (for example, the `LLL` routine).
* Fixed a relatively benign indexing bug in `GF2EX` discovered by Berend-Benjamin Tams using the `valgrind` tool. 


## 2009.05.05: Changes between NTL 5.5 and 5.5.1

* If using GMP (via either `NTL_GMP_LIP` or `NTL_GMP_HACK`), then the new version (4.3.0) of GMP implements the `XGCD` functionality differently, so that the coefficients do not always agree with those returned by the classical extended Euclidean algorithm.

* The `configure` script has been slightly modified: there is a new configuration variable `DEF_PREFIX`, whose value can be used to set `PREFIX`, `GMP_PREFIX`, and `GF2X_PREFIX` in one stroke. Also, the (somewhat esoteric) `configure` variables `GMP_LIBDIR`, `GMP_INCDIR`, `GF2X_LIBDIR`, and `GF2X_INCDIR` have slightly different meanings now.


## 2009.04.08: Changes between NTL 5.4.2 and 5.5

* Added the ability to generate a *shared* library (with help from Tim Abbott). [Details.](http://www.shoup.net/ntl/doc/tour-unix.html#shared)
* Fixed some standardization issues (with help from Tim Abbott): default location of installed documentation files now conforms to standards; use of `EOF` now conforms to standards.
* Added a callback mechanism to NTL's error reporting function. See `ErrorCallback` in [tools.txt](http://www.shoup.net/ntl/doc/tools.txt).

* Fixed a bug in `void TraceMod(zz_p& x, const zz_pX& a, const zz_pXModulus& F)` (reported by Luca De Feo).
* Fixed a performance issue in various versions of `SetCoeff` (reported by Luca De Feo).
* Fixed the declaration of `mat_zz_p transpose(const mat_zz_p& a)` (reported by Benoit Lacelle).

So we should be able to drop a couple custom patches.

+* Added the ability to generate a *shared* library (with help from Tim Abbott). [Details.](http://www.shoup.net/ntl/doc/tour-unix.html#shared)
+* Fixed some standardization issues (with help from Tim Abbott): default location of installed documentation files now conforms to standards; use of `EOF` now conforms to standards.
+* Added a callback mechanism to NTL's error reporting function. See `ErrorCallback` in [tools.txt](http://www.shoup.net/ntl/doc/tools.txt).
+* Added support for the `gf2x` library for speeding up arithmetic in `GF2X` (with help from Emmanuel Thomé). [Details.](http://www.shoup.net/ntl/doc/tour-gf2x.html)
+* In conjuction with the above, I also changed the `GF2X` so that it works better with very large polynomials: large blocks of memory are released, recursive HalfGCD algorithms are used for large polynomials.
+* Fixed a bug in `void TraceMod(zz_p& x, const zz_pX& a, const zz_pXModulus& F)` (reported by Luca De Feo).
+* Fixed a performance issue in various versions of `SetCoeff` (reported by Luca De Feo).
+* Fixed the declaration of `mat_zz_p transpose(const mat_zz_p& a)` (reported by Benoit Lacelle).
+
+---
 
 So we should be able to drop a couple custom patches.
 
 Cheers,
 
 Michael

I started with a fresh build of 4.7.1.alpha0 which passes all tests;  built the new spkg here (with SAGE_CHECK=yes"); did "sage -ba" followed by "sage -t -long", and all tests pass.

The spkg itself is ok (though there's a typo "numbery" in the README, and William should probably not be the only spkg maintainer listed), so I am giving this a positive review and hop that it can go into the next alpha form 4.7.1.
