When I publish a worksheet on sagenb.org, it says I can find the sheet at: http://:8000/home/pub/243

Of course, this is silly nonsense.

It might have to do with starting the notebook with address='', maybe?

Yes it does use address. I just discovered that on my computer if I set address='sagenb.org' then I can't start the notebook.

It looks like this has been a long standing bug, which nobody has worked on. I would make two suggestion, though. 

Firstly, if this gets fixed, it would be sensible to detect the following range of IP addresses, and indicate they can not be routed over the internet. 

* 10.x.x.x
* 172.16.x.x to 172.31.x.x
* 192.168.x.x

Secondly, perhaps a further reminder about the security risks would not go amiss either.

Following the suggestions [here](http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.python/browse_thread/thread/d931cdc326d7032b?hl=en) and [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/166545/finding-a-public-facing-ip-address-in-python), I get:

```python
sage: import socket
sage: socket.gethostbyname(socket.gethostname())
'127.0.0.1'
sage: s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
sage: s.connect(('google.com', 0))
sage: s.getsockname()[0]
'192.168.x.y'
sage: import urllib
sage: urllib.urlopen('http://whatismyip.org').read()
'a.b.c.d'
```
I'm looking now for ways to iterate over the available interfaces in Twisted...

By the way, there are a few suggestions to the main problem at #5675.

What is a good name for a keyword option that's inserted instead of the `interface` (post-#7639, `address` is deprecated) when `interface=''`?

I *think* Twisted just uses [socket](http://docs.python.org/library/socket.html), which 
uses the underlying system's socket library.  I don't know if there is a local, cross-platform way to iterate over `'0.0.0.0'` (all interfaces) and map each to an IP address.
