In the list "common_varnames" (in sage/misc/latex.py) two
Greek letters "phi" and "Phi" are missing. So LaTeX typesetting
for them doesn't work unlike other Greek letters.

This issue has been discussed in the thread

http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/a51f269f057d8223

A patch (created on top of sage-3.4) to fix this issue is attached.
