I don't remember anything special about that polynomial, so I'm fine with changing it.

Other possibilities would include changing the sorting.  One possibility would be to remove the code that puts real roots first; another possibility would be to special-case complex interval roots in the sorting, and say that if the imaginary part of a root is an interval that contains 0 then it should sort with the real roots.

The following illustrates the problem and a potential solution:

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Sage Version 3.4.1.rc3, Release Date: 2009-04-16                   |
| Type notebook() for the GUI, and license() for information.        |
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Loading Sage library. Current Mercurial branch is: review
sage: from sage.rings.polynomial.complex_roots import complex_roots
sage: x = polygen(ZZ) 
sage: complex_roots(x^2 + 27*x + 181)
[(-12.3819660112501?, 1), (-14.61803398874990? + 0.?e-27*I, 1)]
sage: v=complex_roots(x^2 + 27*x + 181)
sage: sorted((v[0][0].real(),v[1][0].real()))
[-14.61803398874990?, -12.3819660112501?]
```
On another machine we get:

```
sage: from sage.rings.polynomial.complex_roots import complex_roots
sage:  x = polygen(ZZ)  
sage: complex_roots(x^2 + 27*x + 181)
[(-14.61803398874990? + 0.?e-27*I, 1), (-12.38196601125010? + 0.?e-27*I, 1)]
sage: v=complex_roots(x^2 + 27*x + 181)
sage: sorted((v[0][0].real(),v[1][0].real()))
[-14.61803398874990?, -12.38196601125010?]
```
Patch coming up.

Cheers,

Michael
