This is code from Carl Witty, which (almost) implements an implicit_plot3d command to plot isosurfaces of a 3d function.  Carl, would it be fair to say the code is inspired by Jmol's code for generating and displaying isosurfaces?

(I should say the code is posted here with Carl's permission).

Here are a list of things that he thinks need to be done in order to have it be ready to be reviewed for inclusion in Sage in the shortest amount of time (the rest of this post is quoting Carl's email):

This is the least that I think is necessary to release the code.
Probably (4) (add docstrings and doctests) is by far the most work.

1) remove all mention of colors from the docstring (probably move the
current docstring text into the function body as comments, so it isn't
lost)

2) test NaNs in the function output, or remove the text about NaNs in
the docstring

3) test the following (or, in some cases, remove the text from the docstring):

* using the standard Sage 3d transforms to move the result around in 3D space
* explicitly specifying a gradient function
* using a triple for plot_points, to have separate X,Y,Z resolution
* using different plot ranges in the different directions

For non-cubical voxels, (either of the last two tests) be sure to test
with tachyon to make sure the gradients are right (make sure that
specular-reflection highlights look correct).  Draw a sphere using the
sphere primitive, and another sphere using implicit_plot3d, and make
sure that the highlights look similar, even when you use very
non-cubical voxels.

4) add docstrings and doctests (you hopefully wouldn't be able to get
it into sage in its current almost-doctestless state, anyway)

5) fix this:

Currently, we forbid giving variable names in the plot ranges.
Probably we should either require them or make them optional.

6) If the following two bugs/potential bugs aren't fixed, then tickets
should be opened against them so they aren't lost:

For surface normals (for smooth rendering in tachyon), it tries to
differentiate the function to find the gradient.  This seems to work
for SR functions, but not for polynomials; it's probably easy to fix,
but I didn't look into it at all.

There's at least one bug that I think is there (but haven't verified):
I think that if an implicit surface is given a transform that squishes
or skews it, then the surface normals will be wrong.  (We transform
the surface normal by the transformation matrix; I seem to recall that
you're supposed to transform surface normals according to the inverse
of the transpose of the transformation matrix.)  (Only the tachyon
renderer uses the surface normals, and only in smooth=True mode.)

1) I hadn't even looked at the ContourPlot3D docs until I was mostly
done with the implementation.

2) I was probably influenced by the JVXL-format mention of NaN's
making holes in the surfaces; so I was thinking about how to replicate
this effect, and punch holes.

If whoever works on the code next wants to invert the "hole" into
"regionfunction", that would be fine with me.

Note the somewhat unusual specification of "hole", checking for >0
instead of for True.  I did this to perhaps make it easier to use a
fast_float function for the hole.  (I didn't do much thinking about
it, though.)

Definitely.  Plus, some of the non-code chunks (some nice ASCII art, and the triangle-generation table) are directly copied from the Jmol source.  (All such instances are nicely commented, and the file copyright explains the situation.)

Let me get one more item into the permanent record here:

There is support that is mostly implemented, but doesn't quite work, for producing colored plots (where the color at each point comes from a separate function, producing either scalar or RGB values).  This is documented as working, but it doesn't.

As I mentioned above, one possibility would be to just remove the bits about color from the documentation.  But another would be to actually fix the color support.

For Jmol, I think this just involves feeding colors into the
JVXLRunLenthEncoder in self.colors (using the same
self.fraction_as_character() call as for the edge data), then changing
some text in the JVXL header and appending the text from self.colors
after the edge data.  (The JVXLRunLengthEncoder has never been tested;
alternatively, you can just replace it with a StringIO, and that
should work -- the run length encoding is optional.)

For tachyon, at first I thought that it wouldn't be possible to get
nice colors -- the documentation doesn't mention any triangle
primitive that lets you do smooth-shaded colors.  But I found the
undocumented VCSTRI in the tachyon source, that looks like exactly
what you would want.

(By the way, I was wrong about the way the automated testing works; it does the sensible thing, and tests every output format. All that's necessary is a stub obj_repr() method to keep it from complaining.)

I"ve attached a patch with what I have so far:
* Added docstrings and tests to most of the major functions (in the new ReST format), with a few notable exceptions. MarchingCubes.process_slice and related methods are inherently stateful, and thus hard to test -- although they are indirectly tested by render_implicit and implicit_plot3d.
* Removed all mention of colors from the docstring for implicit_plot3d.
* Added support for explicitly specifying plot variables via extract_vars_ranges_and_adapt.
* Added defaults for plot_points, render_params, and texture (the latter two in MarchingCubes.__init__).

I did find a bug which is that MarchingCubesJVXL cannot handle heterogeneous plot ranges; try the last example under TESTS with show(viewer='tachyon') and then show(viewer='jmol').

Also, we need many more examples!

I will see what I can do.

Attachment [many-more-examples.tar](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket5249/many-more-examples.tar) by wcauchois created at 2009-03-13 23:11:53

I updated trac5249.patch. Apply it on top of implicit-surfaces.patch.

I added 28 examples to the docstring for implicit_plot3d. I also attached many-more-examples.tar, which contains a simple script I used to format the examples. It can output the examples in a Sage notebook format, so if you want to see the examples, you should check it out.

Jason: Here's the status. I've done much of the work that Carl described in his original email. Currently, the major thing left to do is fixing bugs.

Aside from the two bugs Carl mentioned, which are still outstanding, there is one critical bug that I discovered. If you specify different X, Y or Z ranges, then Jmol rendering is radically wrong (although Tachyon is unaffected). For example, try this:

```
var('x,y,z')
implicit_plot3d(x^2+y^2+z^2-4,(-2,0),(-2,2),(-2,2)).show(viewer='jmol')
```

Good luck, I hope you can make some headway!

Here's a status update:

I posted to the jmol-users mailing list and Robert Hanson, who wrote most of the isosurface code in Jmol, helped me find the problem with our JVXL files. Apparently the JVXL specification is wrong. Where the spec says

```
for (int x = voxelCountX; --x >= 0;) {
 for (int y = voxelCountY; --y >= 0;) {
   for (int z = voxelCountZ; --z >= 0;) {
```
to demonstrate the order for visiting voxels (on page 7), it should be

```
for (int x = 0; x < voxelCountX; x++) {
 for (int y = 0; y < voxelCountY; y++) {
   for (int z = 0; z < voxelCountZ; z++) {
```
-- that is to say, the order is reversed. A quick fix for this is to reverse the order of the edge data stored in self.bitmap in MarchingCubesJVXL. I tried it and it worked.

Anyhow, I also wrote a backend based on IndexFaceSet, and that works fine, and I've attached the patch. I think the IndexFaceSet backend should be the default for both Jmol and Tachyon, since it offers a number of features -- including mesh=True, transparency, and methods to manipulate the mesh programmatically. As long as MarchingCubesJVXL is working, shall we keep support for JVXL as a feature?

There is one outstanding issue with the IndexFaceSet backend, which is that the scale for the Jmol plots is incorrect. If you try to graph something, you can see that the figure will be larger than its bounding box by a factor of about 3. I believe the bounding box is correct, so the problem must be with the transformation matrix we are given through render_params or the way we apply that transformation. On line 317 of plot3d/base.pyx, in _prepare_for_jmol, I noticed that it applies some scaling factor "s" (=3). Do we have to account for that somehow? Does anyone have any insight into this issue?

So basically the major things left to do are to fix that bug, and add doctests for everything. I will continue to work on this.

Robert Bradshaw might be a good person to ask that _prepare_for_jmol question.

Two remarks, both of which should be addressed via followup tickets:

* lots of docstrings of non-underscore methods consist only of tests, but no description what the function does
* the new functionality has not been added to the reference manual, so it is hard to be aware that the functionality exists

Also: Is the following correct?

* credit for authorship: Bill Cauchois, Carl Witty, Jason Grout
* credit for review: William Stein
