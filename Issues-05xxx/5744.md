isinf() and a bunch of friends we right now provide via solaris_fixes.h in various places is available in C99 mode with gcc via math_c99.h which is included in math.h. So building some extensions in C99 mode will allow us to get rid of nearly all Solaris specific workarounds. 

At the same time we have a new problem with _Complex_I which is expected to be provided by the compiler since complex.h just defines _Complex_I to be _Complex_I on Solaris 10. Not good :(

I have a patch coming up.

Cheers,

Michael

This patch removes some of the problems with C99, but some issues remain unresolved due to header issues when C99 and C++ is used.

This looks fine to me.  I give it a positive review if it works for mabshoff.  He's the only one right now with a full Solaris build setup to test this on.

It does not affect the build on non-Solaris and on Solaris it starts up, so I am making this a positive review.
