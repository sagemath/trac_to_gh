Two issues: QQbar doesn't seem to have a latex method. Also, the latex method for CC is "\\C", which is not a valid LaTeX command. For example, if I type "view(CC)" in the notebook, jsmath gives an error, and if I type "view(CC)" from the command line, I get a blank page.

This patch provides a latex method for QQbar and changes the latex method for CC (note that it uses `\mathbf`, just as the latex methods for RR, ZZ, and QQ do).
