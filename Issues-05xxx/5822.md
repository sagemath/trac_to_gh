It would be very useful if for a congruence subgroup G and an integer d coprime to the level N of G, one could compute the action on cusps (modulo G) of `tau_d \in Gal(Q(zeta_N)/Q)`.   This action is described on page 12 of Steven's "Arithmetic on Modular Curves". 

Note that Sage does not have a data type for "equivalence classes of cusps" yet, and the action is only well defined on equivalence classes.  However, one easy thing to implement (hopefully) is a function so that if G is a congruence subgroup, then we have

```
sage: G.galois_action_on_cusps(d, alpha)
```
which returns a cusp beta that is in the class of tau_d([alpha]).

Later when there is a data structure for equivalence classes of cusps, and also one for these Galois groups (as abstract groups), then that will call the above function.

Our NFcusps code has not yet been put out to review, but probably should be soon - -it has had a lot os spinoffs in number field utilities, which have all now been merged.

Positive review:  applies ok to 3.4.1.rc3, does what it says and works.

Comment:  OK, so this is how Galois acts, but would it not be a good idea to also mention that this gives the action of the so-called diamond operators?   i.e. the standard operation of `(Z/NZ)^* = Gamma_0(N)/Gamma_1(N)` ?  I looked to see if they were already defined, e.g. on ManinSymbols, but the only reference to "diamond" which search_src() revealed was a reference to the book by D & Shurman!

I would know the answer to the above if I had got further through the modular/modsym directory on the last docday, but doing just two files took up all the time I had.  And now term has started.

I think it would be very natural to have a class for the set of cusps modulo a congruence subgroup.   The only reason Sage doesn't have that now is that I didn't have time yet to implement it.
