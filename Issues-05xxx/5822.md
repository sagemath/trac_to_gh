It would be very useful if for a congruence subgroup G and an integer d coprime to the level N of G, one could compute the action on cusps (modulo G) of `tau_d \in Gal(Q(zeta_N)/Q)`.   This action is described on page 12 of Steven's "Arithmetic on Modular Curves". 

Note that Sage does not have a data type for "equivalence classes of cusps" yet, and the action is only well defined on equivalence classes.  However, one easy thing to implement (hopefully) is a function so that if G is a congruence subgroup, then we have

```
sage: G.galois_action_on_cusps(d, alpha)
```
which returns a cusp beta that is in the class of tau_d([alpha]).

Later when there is a data structure for equivalence classes of cusps, and also one for these Galois groups (as abstract groups), then that will call the above function.

Positive review:  applies ok to 3.4.1.rc3, does what it says and works.

Comment:  OK, so this is how Galois acts, but would it not be a good idea to also mention that this gives the action of the so-called diamond operators?   i.e. the standard operation of `(Z/NZ)^* = Gamma_0(N)/Gamma_1(N)` ?  I looked to see if they were already defined, e.g. on ManinSymbols, but the only reference to "diamond" which search_src() revealed was a reference to the book by D & Shurman!

I would know the answer to the above if I had got further through the modular/modsym directory on the last docday, but doing just two files took up all the time I had.  And now term has started.

I think it would be very natural to have a class for the set of cusps modulo a congruence subgroup.   The only reason Sage doesn't have that now is that I didn't have time yet to implement it.
