I thought we had fixed this via fast_callable, but it is still there:

```
mabshoff@sage:/scratch/mabshoff/sage-3.4.1.rc3$ ./sage
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Sage Version 3.4.1.rc2, Release Date: 2009-04-10                   |
| Type notebook() for the GUI, and license() for information.        |
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage: f=x^(1/3)
sage: f._fast_float_(x)(-1.2)
nan
sage: 
```
This is exposed via a plotting failure on Solaris where NaNs pop up. Fixing that in the plotting code is a different ticket William will open shortly.

Cheers,

Michael

Hmm, the c library is involved here as shown by this on Solaris:

```
-bash-3.00$ ./sage
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Sage Version 3.4.1.rc1, Release Date: 2009-04-05                   |

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Loading Sage library. Current Mercurial branch is: main-sol
sage: f=x^(1/3)
sage: f._fast_float_(x)(-1.2)
-NaN
```

I am not so sure what is going on or if this is the real issue. I will talk to RobertWB in person about this on the next occasion.

Cool, note that #5780 does fix an issue when the axes code in plotting encounters a NaN or Infinity, so you might want to apply that one before doctesting.
