Consider this:

```
sage: v = vector({1: 1, 3: -1})
sage: w = vector({1: -1, 3: 1})
sage: v+w
(0, 0, 0, 0)
sage: (v+w).is_zero()
False
```

I see two things wrong with the source code:

1. in modules/free_module_element.pyx, it says

```
    def __nonzero__(self):
        """
        EXAMPLES:
            sage: V = vector(ZZ, [0, 0, 0, 0])
            sage: bool(V)
            False
            sage: V = vector(ZZ, [1, 2, 3, 5])
            sage: bool(V)
            True
        """
        return self != 0
```
I don't understand the relevance of the doctest at all, and the actual code should probably say something like `self != self.parent()(0)`.  In fact, this is completely unnecessary, because this class inherits from ModuleElement, which has `__nonzero__` defined in precisely this way -- see structure/element.pyx.

2. in structure/element.pyx, it says

```
    def is_zero(self):
        """
        Return True if self equals self.parent()(0). The default
        implementation is to fall back to 'not self.__nonzero__'.

        NOTE: Do not re-implement this method in your subclass but
        implement __nonzero__ instead.
        """
        return not self
```
The code `return not self` looks like a typo: it should be `return not self.__nonzero__()` -- read the docstring!

The patch deals with both of these issues by fixing the code in element.pyx and by deleting the code in free_module_element.pyx.  It also adds a doctest to element.pyx, verifying that the above vector example now works.
