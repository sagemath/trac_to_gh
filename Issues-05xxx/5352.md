Fix it so that the logs end up in DOT_SAGE since that does not have to be $HOME/.sage as hard coded for the log files.

Cheers,

Michael

There is a repository, referred to as the script repository, in `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin`. The patch should apply cleanly to this repo, have proper mercurial headers, etc.

Attached patch does not fix all the problem places. The script `sage-valgrind` still refers to `$HOME/.sage`. Could you fix that and use "hg export" to create the patch?

I think this looks good. Here's how I tested:

1. Install valgrind.
2. Rebuild sage with SAGE_VALGRIND="yes".
3. Create an empty suppressions file (Trac #11918)
4. Remove my ~/.sage/valgrind
5. Create and export DOT_SAGE=~/grind
6. Execute,
   * sage -valgrind
   * sage -cachegrind
   * sage -callgrind
   * sage -massif
   * sage -tp 4 -long -valgrind devel/sage/sage (Killed this one prematurely since it was going to take a month)
7. Tried to run sage -omega, but the exp-omega tool has been removed from recent versions of valgrind.
8. Checked my ~/.sage and ~/grind directories to make sure all of the log files wound up in the right places.
9. make ptestlong, no failures
10. Grep for leftover '$HOME/.sage' instances in local/bin
