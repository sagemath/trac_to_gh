Hi,

the patch as is will not go into Sage since you are putting the sources for cliquer-1.2 into the Sage library tree where they do not belong. 

I have not looked at the cython interface, but my guess would be that we need to change cliquer-1.2 to create a library. Please split the cython interface work (the code you wrote minus the cliquer-1.2 source code) and the cliquer-1.2.spkg work. The Cython code should remain here while spkg should go to #5669.

Cheers,

Michael

To get this going again, here are some specific suggestions for patch 12427.patch and the associated spkg:

* copy the header files to somewhere in $SAGE_LOCAL/include (maybe $SAGE_LOCAL/include/cliquer/*.h

* Make a cliquer.pxd file that declares the necessary functions and structs from the header files.  Make sure that you are only doing cdef externs from the header files, not the .c files like the patch is currently doing.  Don't include the path; just do  `cdef extern from "cliquer/graph.h":` since the header is in the include path.  This cliquer.pxd file can go into sage/graphs.

* Make a cliquer.pyx in sage/graphs that contains the definitions of max_clique, all_max_clique, and clique_number.  Document and add doctests to these functions.

* Delete the lines

```
from sage.graphs.graph import Graph 
#from distutils.core import setup 
#from distutils.extension import Extension 
from Cython.Distutils import build_ext 
```

* In module_list.py, add a `libraries = ['cliquer']` option (see the surrounding declarations for examples of this).

* Compile the cliquer sources into a shared library, named libcliquer.so, using the instructions in the HowTo William posted.  Place this shared library into $SAGE_LOCAL/lib.

* In the graphs.py, I don't think you need to do `from sage.graphs.cliquer import clique_number`.  Since the module will be in that directory, I think it would be sufficient to do `from cliquer import clique_number`.

Nathann,

I have deleted the previous patches to avoid confusion.

When addressing the following issues, please post another patch to be applied on top of the first (this makes review easier).

1. `algorithm=='networkx'` is never tested, and if it were, it would fail, due to the `cliques` parameter

2. Why are you using `cliquer.pxi` instead of `cliquer.pxd`? If it were `pxd` instead, then other Cython files could `cimport` the same data types.

3. It should go:

```
if algorithm=='networkx':
    ...
elif algorithm=='cliquer':
    ...
else:
    raise NotImplementedError("Only 'networkx' and 'cliquer' are supported.")
```
Also you need to change one instance of `'Cliquer'` to `'cliquer'`.

4. In maximum_cliques, "vertex set" should be "vertex sets"

I hope all is fixed now... Though I just renamed cliquer.pxi to cliquer.pxd without really understanding the difference ^^;

By the way, I am not really sure this possibility to change the algorithm used to compute the cliquer number is that useful... Just take a look at this :

sage: g=graphs.RandomGNP(100,.5)
sage: time g.clique_number(algorithm="networkx")
CPU times: user 2.49 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 2.49 s
Wall time: 2.49 s
9
sage: time g.clique_number()
CPU times: user 0.01 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.01 s
Wall time: 0.01 s
9
sage: g=graphs.RandomGNP(150,.5)
sage: time g.clique_number(algorithm="networkx")
CPU times: user 18.45 s, sys: 0.04 s, total: 18.49 s
Wall time: 18.49 s
10
sage: time g.clique_number()
CPU times: user 0.03 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.03 s
Wall time: 0.03 s
10
sage: g=graphs.RandomGNP(200,.5)
sage: time g.clique_number(algorithm="networkx")
CPU times: user 82.33 s, sys: 0.18 s, total: 82.52 s
Wall time: 82.54 s
11
sage: time g.clique_number()
CPU times: user 0.07 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.07 s
Wall time: 0.07 s
11

Anyway, from the practical point of view, it works now ;-)

There are plenty of reasons to have two different implementations, and one I can think of right off the top of my head is to compare results for correctness.

1. You have removed the input "cliques," which is used by NetworkX. You need to put this back in, and mention that it is ignored unless the algorithm is "networkx."

2. The `include '../ext/cliquer.pxd'` line at the beginning of cliquer.pyx is not necessary. "include" is a plain text include, and `pxd` files are forward declarations, which get automatically included by Cython as long as the other part of the filename is the same.

3. One thing I should have mentioned last round: the three functions introduced in cliquer.pyx need to be documented, including some nontrivial doctests.

After all this is done, we should be very close to finished!

It seems as if Cliquer is subtracting one from each vertex in the input, and so the input needs to have one added to it. To see this, apply `trac_5793_debug_only.patch`, and you get:

```

Unweighted graph has 4 vertices, 2 edges (density 0.33).

You should probably also expose at least this `print_graph` function in the official versions.

OK, I have a few more requests:

1. I think you should expose Cliquer's `graph_print` function in `cliquer.pxd`, so other people see it when they try to play around with the interface.

2. In general, doctests should be indented, so e.g.

```
EXAMPLES:: 

sage: C=graphs.PetersenGraph() 
sage: max_clique(C) 
[7, 9] 
""" 
```
should be

```
EXAMPLES:: 

    sage: C=graphs.PetersenGraph() 
    sage: max_clique(C) 
    [7, 9] 

""" 
```

3. In fact, you should probably check out

http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/conventions.html

For example, the following belongs in an `INPUT:` block, and would look much more professional there:

```
The parameter 'cliques' is an optional list of cliques that can be input if already computed. 
ONLY USED BY NetworkX !!!
```

4. There are several functions in `graph.py` which compute with cliques, which haven't been exposed to this new interface. For example, `G.cliques()`. It would be nice to take care of those functions now too, so people don't unnecessarily complain about these functions being slow later. They are all in the same part of the file, which starts with `### Cliques`.

5. There is one other thing to be aware of. You are assuming that the vertex set is *always* {0,...,n-1}. In fact, this will cause some trouble:

```
sage: C = graphs.CubeGraph(4)
sage: C.maximum_clique()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: cannot concatenate 'str' and 'int' objects
sage: C.vertices()[0]
'0000'
```

Here is the idea to get around this, since this problem has come up many times before:

```
sage: C = graphs.CubeGraph(4)
sage: G,d = C.relabel(inplace=False, return_map=True)
sage: d_inv = {}
sage: for v in d:
....:     d_inv[d[v]] = v
....:     
sage: C.vertices()

Concerning the cliques, I agree when you say that a "A maximum clique is just a clique of maximal size", but a "maximal clique" is a clique such that there is no bigger clique in the graph -- according to the subset inclusion order (all the maximal cliques of a graph need not have the same cardinality) -- and this I what I thought I had read in the descriptions of the others functions.

And.... now that this seems to be finished, I only have left to take care of the LP/MIP patch, which seems quite another adventure... ;-)

In the last patch:

1. I made all clique related functions start with `clique_` so that you can do `G.clique<tab>` and see all of them.

2. Added a few doctests here and there

3. Deprecated cliques, since it is ambiguous.

I do not really know how to read patch files, but it seems to me you replaced :
m = max([len(c) for c in G.cliques()]) 
by
m = max([len(c) for c in G.cliques_maximum()]) 

If right, I have two remarks :
- The syntax of max([len(c) for c in G.cliques()])  makes me think that G.cliques() was meant to return the list of the maximAL cliques, and m is then meant to be the clique number of G. The expression max([len(c) for c in G.cliques_maximum()])  is syntaxically correct, thought as cliques_maximum returns only the maxiMUM cliques we may as well return the length of the first one as they all have the same size.
- In the end, and if I make no mistake, why about just setting m=G.clique_number() ?

I expect it to be way faster than an enumeration of all the cliques ! ;-)
