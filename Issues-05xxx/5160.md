Since #5094 is merged, I'll open this ticket.  It seems to be a worthwhile idea.  

Rename `sage/misc/sagex_ds.pyx` to `sage/misc/binary_tree.pyx`, which also conveys much better what this file is about.  Also fix some doctest formatting, and add the random tester.

Nice.  I'll try to review it if someone else doesn't get there first.  Do you think we'd need a deprecation period, or is it unlikely anyone would actually use this other than in the files in question?  Who could we ask?

I think it's unlikely, since it's barely used in Sage itself.  Besides, Sage code shouldn't be affected:

```
sage: BinaryTree()
```
should work just as before.

I don't even know how to deprecate a *module name* (as opposed to a function).

Good point, which is why I didn't do it before.

This looks good.  I guess at some point this was supposed to have a lot more than binary trees :)  Running irrelevant tests now, but the relevant ones were fine.  I'm getting some errors, but they seem unrelated - I'll look into it.

Yeah, they seem to be unrelated - weird, but I must have done something wrong.  They occurred with and without the patch.
