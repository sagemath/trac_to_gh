Since #5094 is merged, I'll open this ticket.  It seems to be a worthwhile idea.  

Rename `sage/misc/sagex_ds.pyx` to `sage/misc/binary_tree.pyx`, which also conveys much better what this file is about.  Also fix some doctest formatting, and add the random tester.

I think it's unlikely, since it's barely used in Sage itself.  Besides, Sage code shouldn't be affected:

```
sage: BinaryTree()
```
should work just as before.

I don't even know how to deprecate a *module name* (as opposed to a function).

Good point, which is why I didn't do it before.

This looks good.  I guess at some point this was supposed to have a lot more than binary trees :)  Running irrelevant tests now, but the relevant ones were fine.  I'm getting some errors, but they seem unrelated - I'll look into it.
