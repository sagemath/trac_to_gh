See below for comments and workaround (disable readline in clisp when used from pexpect).\n\nThe original report follows.\n\n---\n\nI've spent the past few days tracking down a very nasty issue in my recently installed sage notebook server. I have the problem nailed down, and I can reproduce it with relative ease. This seems a timing issue between threads running in parallel, so a heisenbug, but I have a way to reproduce it with high chance (with expected time in the order of a minute) in the actual hardware, and with *extremely* high chance in the KVM virtual machine.\n\nI have no idea how to fix the issue, but I have a (quite unsatisfactory) workaround: use a KVM with one processor only, or pin sage and its children processes to a fixed core (read below for more info). In the real hardware, pinning sage to a couple of processors which share L2 seems to completely \"fix\" the issue, while pinning sage to a couple processors with different L2 seems to hit the issue more often.\n\nI wasn't able to reproduce any of this on a core 2 duo -- I don't remember something like this happening to me before, but these days I've been trying harder with the specific things which hang the core 2 quad.\n\nAdditionally, I discussed the issue on IRC with Dan Drake, who also had the same issue after switching to a core 2 quad.\n\nI've been unable to reproduce this on sage.math either.\n\n### Hardware\n\n- real: core 2 quad Q9550. This is a pair of two core chips with 6Mb L2 each, in a single package. IOW, cpus 0 and 1 share 6MB of L2, while cpus 2 and 3 share another 6MB of L2. There's no L3 cache. The main memory is 8Gb of DDR-2 in two channels (4 x 2Gb modules). The clock speed is 2.83GHz (no overclocking) and the FSB should be 1333 according to cpu and mb specs (I don't know how to tell).\n\n I can't reproduce the issues described here in the real hardware using only the pair of cpus 0,1 (which share L2), neither using only the pair of cpus 2,3 (also share L2). OTOH, using a pair of processors with different L2 seems to make the issue easier to reproduce. Also, 0,2 and 0,3 seem to cause the issue more often than 1,2 or 1,3.\n\n To pin sage and subprocesses to a specific cpuset, I use taskset(1).\n\n- virtual: KVM version 72, for the notebook server with 2GB ram and 2 cpu.\n\n I can't reproduce any of this in a virtual machine with only 1 virtual cpu, and neither with a virtual machine with 2 virtual cpus but pinning sage to a unique virtual cpu.\n\n OTOH, I tried pinning the KVM process (with 2 virtual cpus) in the real hardware to cpus 0,1 or alternatively to cpus 2,3, but this doesn't seem to prevent the issue inside the VM.\n\n\n### Sage version\n\n Everything here is based on sage-3.4. This was compiled in the real hardware and -bdist'ed to the vitual CPUs, and I've also tried with trees compiled inside the virtual machines themselves.\n\n\n### Original symptoms (nastyness factor of this issue)\n\na. **the notebook**: random hangs which cannot be interrupted (sometimes not even \"restart the worksheet\" will work, it seems the worksheet can be stopped from the home page only). Empirically seems to always be related to symbolic stuff. \n\n This affects me a lot in the notebook server for the department, which I run inside a KVM machine as described above. Starting today, as a workaround, I'm trying to use taskset to run the sage notebook process group pinned to cpu=1 exclusively (I don't know if this will stick or change when processes get renewed).\n\n This is a very unsatisfactory workaround... OTOH I could try with the server_pool option to use two users -- one pinned to cpu=0, the other to cpu=1, which could be a more satisfactory setup.\n\nb. **doctest**: many doctests failures by timeout --- a particular doctest hangs for 360s before being killed --- no CPU time is used while the doctest is hung. This happens much less often in the real hardware, but it happens nevertheless.\n\n Here's a typical run of the -testall in the real hardware (no cpu pinning). Failed tests:\n\n```\nsage -t  \"devel/sage/sage/rings/power_series_ring.py\"\nsage -t  \"devel/sage/sage/calculus/calculus.py\"\n```\n with total time for all tests: 2935.1 seconds.\n\n A run of -testall inside the KVM may have the following failed tests:\n\n```\n        sage -t  \"devel/sage/doc/fr/tutorial/tour_plotting.rst\"\n        sage -t  \"devel/sage/sage/functions/piecewise.py\"\n        sage -t  \"devel/sage/sage/functions/special.py\"\n        sage -t  \"devel/sage/sage/matrix/matrix_symbolic_dense.pyx\"\n        sage -t  \"devel/sage/sage/matrix/matrix2.pyx\"\n        sage -t  \"devel/sage/sage/matrix/matrix_sparse.pyx\"\n        sage -t  \"devel/sage/sage/matrix/matrix_integer_dense.pyx\"\n        sage -t  \"devel/sage/sage/rings/arith.py\"\n        sage -t  \"devel/sage/sage/rings/number_field/order.py\"\n        sage -t  \"devel/sage/sage/rings/number_field/number_field_ideal.py\"\n        sage -t  \"devel/sage/sage/rings/number_field/number_field.py\"\n        sage -t  \"devel/sage/sage/libs/fplll/fplll.pyx\"\n        sage -t  \"devel/sage/sage/libs/pari/gen.pyx\"\n        sage -t  \"devel/sage/sage/interfaces/lisp.py\"\n        sage -t  \"devel/sage/sage/interfaces/maxima.py\"\n        sage -t  \"devel/sage/sage/calculus/wester.py\"\n        sage -t  \"devel/sage/sage/calculus/tests.py\"\n        sage -t  \"devel/sage/sage/calculus/calculus.py\"\n        sage -t  \"devel/sage/sage/calculus/equations.py\"\n        sage -t  \"devel/sage/sage/combinat/partition.py\"\n        sage -t  \"devel/sage/sage/plot/tachyon.py\"\n        sage -t  \"devel/sage/sage/plot/line.py\"\n        sage -t  \"devel/sage/sage/plot/plot.py\"\n        sage -t  \"devel/sage/sage/plot/animate.py\"\n        sage -t  \"devel/sage/sage/plot/plot3d/parametric_plot3d.py\"\n        sage -t  \"devel/sage/sage/plot/plot3d/plot3d.py\"\n        sage -t  \"devel/sage/sage/tests/book_stein_ent.py\"\n        sage -t  \"devel/sage/sage/gsl/integration.pyx\"\n        sage -t  \"devel/sage/sage/quadratic_forms/extras.py\"\n```\n with total time for all tests: 13042.9 seconds. This is quite long, but 29 timed out tests at 360 seconds each accounts for 10440 seconds...\n\n Note that the actual doctests which fail vary among runs of the test suite. I'd expect all of them to have symbolics of some sort used.\n\n### How I reproduce the issue\n\n Choosing randomly from one of the failed doctests, I settled on this sage line as a trigger:\n\n```\nL = [(i/100.0, maxima.eval(\"jacobi_sn (%s/100.0,2.0)\" % i)) for i in range(-300,300)]\n```\n This line takes less than 5-10 seconds to evaluate --- when it finishes. If it hangs, it will hang forever --- using 0% cpu time. It only uses about 1 second or less of cpu before hanging.\n\n I use the following script to repeatedly test to failure (up to 1000 times):\n\n```\nCPU=0,2\nfor i in {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}\ndo\n  echo\n  echo RUN \"$i ($CPU):\"\n  /usr/bin/time taskset -c $CPU ./sage -c 'L = [(i/100.0, maxima.eval(\"jacobi_sn (%s/100.0,2.0)\" % i)) for i in range(-300,300)]' || break\ndone\n```\n This uses `taskset -c 0,2` to force running on a couple of cores with different L2 cache, as described above. If the CPU variable is set to 0,1 or 2,3 instead, the issue doesn't happen \n\n In typical tests on the real hardware, this hangs in less than 10 runs for CPU=0,2 or CPU=0,3, but it only hung in run 28 for a test with CPU=1,2. It completes 1000 runs with CPU=0,1 or CPU=2,3.\n\n On the KVM with 2 virtual cpus, this hangs much more often when using two processors (CPU=0,1, or don't use taskset). When using a single processor (either taskset inside 2 virtual cpus, or just run KVM with 1 virtual cpu) it completes the 1000 runs without failure.\n\n I did some tests in `sage.math`, but there are many more pairs of cpus to try... I tried using CPU=2,14 ; CPU=2,15 ; CPU=2,16 without failure on a run of 1000 as above (these 2,14,15,16 are 4 of the 6 cores in the physical unit = 2, if I correctly interpreted `/proc/cpuinfo`).\n\n\n**Assignee:** @tornaria\n\n**Resolution:** fixed\n\nIssue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/5662\n\n",

This turned out to be due to some bug in the maxima-clisp-readline interaction. See below for comments and workaround (disable readline in clisp when used from pexpect).

The original report follows.

---

I've spent the past few days tracking down a very nasty issue in my recently installed sage notebook server. I have the problem nailed down, and I can reproduce it with relative ease. This seems a timing issue between threads running in parallel, so a heisenbug, but I have a way to reproduce it with high chance (with expected time in the order of a minute) in the actual hardware, and with *extremely* high chance in the KVM virtual machine.

I have no idea how to fix the issue, but I have a (quite unsatisfactory) workaround: use a KVM with one processor only, or pin sage and its children processes to a fixed core (read below for more info). In the real hardware, pinning sage to a couple of processors which share L2 seems to completely "fix" the issue, while pinning sage to a couple processors with different L2 seems to hit the issue more often.

I wasn't able to reproduce any of this on a core 2 duo -- I don't remember something like this happening to me before, but these days I've been trying harder with the specific things which hang the core 2 quad.

Additionally, I discussed the issue on IRC with Dan Drake, who also had the same issue after switching to a core 2 quad.

I've been unable to reproduce this on sage.math either.

### Hardware

- real: core 2 quad Q9550. This is a pair of two core chips with 6Mb L2 each, in a single package. IOW, cpus 0 and 1 share 6MB of L2, while cpus 2 and 3 share another 6MB of L2. There's no L3 cache. The main memory is 8Gb of DDR-2 in two channels (4 x 2Gb modules). The clock speed is 2.83GHz (no overclocking) and the FSB should be 1333 according to cpu and mb specs (I don't know how to tell).

 I can't reproduce the issues described here in the real hardware using only the pair of cpus 0,1 (which share L2), neither using only the pair of cpus 2,3 (also share L2). OTOH, using a pair of processors with different L2 seems to make the issue easier to reproduce. Also, 0,2 and 0,3 seem to cause the issue more often than 1,2 or 1,3.

 To pin sage and subprocesses to a specific cpuset, I use taskset(1).

- virtual: KVM version 72, for the notebook server with 2GB ram and 2 cpu.

 I can't reproduce any of this in a virtual machine with only 1 virtual cpu, and neither with a virtual machine with 2 virtual cpus but pinning sage to a unique virtual cpu.

 OTOH, I tried pinning the KVM process (with 2 virtual cpus) in the real hardware to cpus 0,1 or alternatively to cpus 2,3, but this doesn't seem to prevent the issue inside the VM.


### Sage version

 Everything here is based on sage-3.4. This was compiled in the real hardware and -bdist'ed to the vitual CPUs, and I've also tried with trees compiled inside the virtual machines themselves.


### Original symptoms (nastyness factor of this issue)

a. **the notebook**: random hangs which cannot be interrupted (sometimes not even "restart the worksheet" will work, it seems the worksheet can be stopped from the home page only). Empirically seems to always be related to symbolic stuff. 

 This affects me a lot in the notebook server for the department, which I run inside a KVM machine as described above. Starting today, as a workaround, I'm trying to use taskset to run the sage notebook process group pinned to cpu=1 exclusively (I don't know if this will stick or change when processes get renewed).

 This is a very unsatisfactory workaround... OTOH I could try with the server_pool option to use two users -- one pinned to cpu=0, the other to cpu=1, which could be a more satisfactory setup.

b. **doctest**: many doctests failures by timeout --- a particular doctest hangs for 360s before being killed --- no CPU time is used while the doctest is hung. This happens much less often in the real hardware, but it happens nevertheless.

 Here's a typical run of the -testall in the real hardware (no cpu pinning). Failed tests:

```
sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/rings/power_series_ring.py"
sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/calculus/calculus.py"
```
 with total time for all tests: 2935.1 seconds.

 A run of -testall inside the KVM may have the following failed tests:

```
        sage -t  "devel/sage/doc/fr/tutorial/tour_plotting.rst"
        sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/functions/piecewise.py"
        sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/functions/special.py"

        sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/matrix/matrix_sparse.pyx"
        sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/matrix/matrix_integer_dense.pyx"
        sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/rings/arith.py"
        sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/rings/number_field/order.py"
        sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/rings/number_field/number_field_ideal.py"
        sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/rings/number_field/number_field.py"
        sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/libs/fplll/fplll.pyx"
        sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/libs/pari/gen.pyx"
        sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/interfaces/lisp.py"
        sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/interfaces/maxima.py"
        sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/calculus/wester.py"
        sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/calculus/tests.py"
        sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/calculus/calculus.py"
        sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/calculus/equations.py"
        sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/combinat/partition.py"
        sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/plot/tachyon.py"
        sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/plot/line.py"
        sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/plot/plot.py"
        sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/plot/animate.py"
        sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/plot/plot3d/parametric_plot3d.py"
        sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/plot/plot3d/plot3d.py"
        sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/tests/book_stein_ent.py"
        sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/gsl/integration.pyx"
        sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/quadratic_forms/extras.py"
```
 with total time for all tests: 13042.9 seconds. This is quite long, but 29 timed out tests at 360 seconds each accounts for 10440 seconds...

 Note that the actual doctests which fail vary among runs of the test suite. I'd expect all of them to have symbolics of some sort used.

### How I reproduce the issue

 Choosing randomly from one of the failed doctests, I settled on this sage line as a trigger:

```
L = [(i/100.0, maxima.eval("jacobi_sn (%s/100.0,2.0)" % i)) for i in range(-300,300)]
```
 This line takes less than 5-10 seconds to evaluate --- when it finishes. If it hangs, it will hang forever --- using 0% cpu time. It only uses about 1 second or less of cpu before hanging.

 I use the following script to repeatedly test to failure (up to 1000 times):

```
CPU=0,2
for i in {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}
do
  echo
  echo RUN "$i ($CPU):"
  /usr/bin/time taskset -c $CPU ./sage -c 'L = [(i/100.0, maxima.eval("jacobi_sn (%s/100.0,2.0)" % i)) for i in range(-300,300)]' || break
done
```
 This uses `taskset -c 0,2` to force running on a couple of cores with different L2 cache, as described above. If the CPU variable is set to 0,1 or 2,3 instead, the issue doesn't happen 

 In typical tests on the real hardware, this hangs in less than 10 runs for CPU=0,2 or CPU=0,3, but it only hung in run 28 for a test with CPU=1,2. It completes 1000 runs with CPU=0,1 or CPU=2,3.

 On the KVM with 2 virtual cpus, this hangs much more often when using two processors (CPU=0,1, or don't use taskset). When using a single processor (either taskset inside 2 virtual cpus, or just run KVM with 1 virtual cpu) it completes the 1000 runs without failure.

 I did some tests in `sage.math`, but there are many more pairs of cpus to try... I tried using CPU=2,14 ; CPU=2,15 ; CPU=2,16 without failure on a run of 1000 as above (these 2,14,15,16 are 4 of the 6 cores in the physical unit = 2, if I correctly interpreted `/proc/cpuinfo`).

Attachment [maxima_expect](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket5662/maxima_expect) by @tornaria created at 2009-04-03 14:34:34

Thanks Dan for your testing.

I have two new developments on this story:

a. I kind of understand what is happening (but not why!), and I am able to reproduce the hang outside of sage with a small expect script ([attachment:maxima_expect maxima_expect]). Just `apt-get install expect` if you don't already have it installed, and run

```
taskset -c 0,2 expect -f maxima_expect > /dev/null
```
 Using this taskset seems to maximize the chances to hit the bug. The expect is quite verbose, so it's wise to redirect the output -- besides, the race condition seems to hit easier when redirecting to /dev/null; but it still happens when echoing to the console (it may help to pipe the output through cat for buffering).
b. I have a *very* preliminary workaround in sage -- the idea is to add a timeout at the exact point where the hang happens, and if so resynchronize everything and reissue the command. This has the potential to affect slow hardware which misses the timeout. In my tests with timeout=0.05 I can miss the timeout for long input strings running inside a VM -- I'm suggesting timeout=0.5. In any case, missing the timeout should reissue the computation, so...

 Here's the patch, in case someone wants to try; all tests pass for me with this --- either `taskset -c 0,2` on the real hardware, or inside a 2 cpu virtual machine.

Attachment [stream.d.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket5662/stream.d.patch) by @tornaria created at 2009-04-04 04:34:00

In seems the issue is caused by some bug in clisp and/or readline. Disabling readline seems to get rid of the isue. The proposed changes are as follows:

1. add a hack to clisp so that readline is disabled when the environment variable `SAGE_CLISP_DISABLE_READLINE_HACK` is set. This subverts the function `stdio_same_tty_p()` which is only used in clisp to decide whether to disable readline or not, c.f.
http://article.gmane.org/gmane.lisp.clisp.devel/16534.
 Note that
a. `maxima --disable-readline` is broken, which would be an ideal solution.
b. the alternative to this hack is to disable readline support when compiling clisp. But this would mean that `sage -maxima` (presumably run interactively) would not support readline at all.
 This hack is implemented in a proposed [clisp-2.46.p8.spkg](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/tornaria/maxima-pexpect-bug/clisp-2.46.p8.spkg). As an aid to the reviewer, the changes in this spkg are displayed in attachment:clisp-2.46.p7-p8.reduced.patch and attachment:stream.d.patch.

2. In order for this fix to be inherited by maxima, a version bump is required. For that purpose I've prepared [maxima-5.16.3.p0.spkg](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/tornaria/maxima-pexpect-bug/maxima-5.16.3.p0.spkg). The change is minimal, just add a line to the changelog as exhibited in attachment:maxima-5.16.3-p0.patch.

3. To enable the hack in the maxima pexpect interface in Sage, a patch to the library needs to be applied. This is the content of attachment:trac_5662.patch which needs to be merged if the proposal gets positive review.

Please ignore the attachment `unix.d.patch` which I uploaded by mistake.

Sounds like the proper way to do this. It will avoid the "quirk" I mentioned above.

Instead of adding a new script, I suggest adding a command line option --disable-readline to the maxima script. This will make a lot of sense since "maxima --help" indeed lists --disable-readline as an option.

**Also note** that the same issue with *maxima interface* arises with *lisp interface*. I've been doing lots of testing, and I've finally been hit by a timeout in `sage/interfaces/lisp.py` which is clearly due to the same issue. *We should apply the same fix to that interface as well!!!*

This (lisp.py) is the only timeout that I've got since I applied the proposed fix.

I've put up new spkg's for clisp and maxima up in
- http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/tornaria/maxima-pexpect-bug/clisp-2.46.p9.spkg
- http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/tornaria/maxima-pexpect-bug/maxima-5.16.3.p1.spkg
These implement command line option "--disable-readline" for lisp/clisp and maxima scripts.

I'll post a new patch to the sage library which uses this option in the pexpect interfaces for maxima and lisp.

Hint: try

```
"20.085537".strip("sage2")
```

The following exhibits these bugs, as tested on sage.math /usr/local/bin/sage which is stock 3.4:

```
sage: lisp.eval("2")
''
sage: lisp.set("x", 2)
sage: lisp.get("x")
'2'
sage: lisp.eval("x")
'x\n2'
```

Some notes:

The changes (in the two patches for the Sage Library, and in both of the new clib spkg and the new maxima spkg) are tiny and do a good job, as Dan Drake was able to verify. They do not seem to introduce regressions (with Sage 3.1.4.r3 plus the spkgs at #5788 and #5219 and the patches/spkgs here, "make testlong" had no failures for my MacIntel OS X 10.4); I'm just building on my MacPPC to test and see whether the pexpect/maxima situation ("calculus.py" and friends) now is better there.

But --- trying to "hg import" the two patches "trac_5662.patch" and "trac_5662-part2.patch" prompts me both times to write some commit message; and neither of the two linked spkgs has a clean "hg status": in both cases, too, a "hg commit -A -m "trac #5662: some message"" (in the respective package root directories) would have been needed before the "sage -pkg" command.

Nothing that Michael (or I, for that matters) couldn't do in a few minutes, but then the wrong person, and not Gonzalo Tornaria, would show up in the three Mercurial (hg repository) histories, as the one to have done the changes. And for the public out there, the clisp spkg and the maxima spkg both bump two version numbers each, without the intermediate versions ever having had an official status. 

Cheers, gsw

None of the above patches will go in unchanged aside from the clisp one that patches out readline dynamically. I will also commit a diff in the posters name.
