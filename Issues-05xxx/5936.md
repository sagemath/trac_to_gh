Currently we have this:

```
sage: Q = GraphQuery(
       display_cols=['graph6','num_vertices','degree_sequence'],
       num_edges=['<=',5],min_degree=1)
sage: for G in Q: print G
```
outputs

```
Traceback (click to the left for traceback)
...
TypeError: 'GraphQuery' object is not iterable
```

Why not have it Q.__iter__() return an iterator over `Q.get_graphs_list()`, which would easily work?
