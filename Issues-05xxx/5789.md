NOTE: The patches don't apply cleanly. The bundle works perfectly
against sage-3.4.1.rc[1-2] and applies cleanly.

The authors of this are Mike Hansen and William Stein.

After applying the bundle (with hg_sage.apply('bundle_of_it_all.hg'))
sage should work 100% as usual. However, if in devel/sage/ you type

   ./spkg-distlite

then the dist directory will contained

   dist/sagelite-3.4.1.tar.gz

You can take that sagelite-3.4.1.tar.gz and drop it into "any" Python
(extract and do python setup.py install) that has twisted, pexpect,
Ipython and maybe some other easy dependencies, and you should be able
to do

```
>>> from sage.server.notebook.notebook_object import notebook
>>> notebook('test_dir')
```
and get the Sage notebook, completely independent of the rest of the
Sage library!

If you switch the mode to python in the list at the top of the screen,
you should be able to compute 2+2.

Here's a link to the sagelite-3.4.1.tar.gz (only 603K!) that the above
instructions would produce:

The bundle works fine for me and as far as I can tell, it's +1. However, I'd like if somebody with more familiarity with the code could also look at it, since the patch imho touches important things.

Some comments that I noticed: the following functions have doctests, but don't have any docstring, e.g. I was expecting some line about what the function does -- sometimes it's easy to infer from the example, sometimes it took me a while (e.g. the running_total):

```
+def prod(x, z=None):
+    """

+def running_total(L, start=None):
```

Anyway, this is minor.

I run the tests for a sever:

$ ./sage -t devel/sage/sage/server/

They all pass for me.

I nuked the bundle since I see no point in keeping a huge 0.5MB bundle around when we now have the patch :)

Taking only trac_5789.patch I get:

```
byte-compiling /scratch/mabshoff/sage-3.4.1.rc3/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/sage/structure/sobj.py to sobj.pyc
  File "/scratch/mabshoff/sage-3.4.1.rc3/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/sage/structure/sobj.py", line 202
    cdef bint make_pickle_jar = os.environ.has_key('SAGE_PICKLE_JAR')
            ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

running install_scripts
```
Cython vs. Python?

Cheers,

Michael

This patch causes one rather bizarre doctest failure:
