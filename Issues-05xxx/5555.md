With the attached patch, you should be able to use \ZZ, \CC, \RR, and \QQ in docstrings and have them typeset correctly in the html, live html, latex, and pdf versions of the documentation.  To add new macros, edit the file '$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/doc/common/sage-macros.tex'.  (I considered just using the existing file 'macros.tex' in the same directory, but decided it was too bloated.)

The point here is to be able to write docstrings which are readable from interactive help in Sage and which also get typeset correctly in the reference manual; this was discussed on [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_frm/thread/74e6bcf5ef716d1c), and people seemed to agree that a docstring like 

```
This computes the integral homology `H_d(X, \ZZ)` of `X` in dimension `d`. 
```
was better than

```
This computes the integral homology `H_d(X, \mathbb{Z})` of `X` in dimension `d`. 
```
especially since the \ZZ gets turned into ZZ when pre-parsed for interactive help.  

This point should be kept in mind if anyone wants to add new macros: the name should be short and unambiguous, and there should be a good reason for using it instead of plain LaTeX.  (This was maybe what I meant when I said that macros.tex was too bloated.)

Having said all of that, I would be happy to add some more macros now.  What else should be added?  Once we seem to have made some sort of decision about that, I'll update the patch and mark this ticket as "needs review".

Now I need help.  'new-macros.patch' doesn't work, and I don't know why.  When I run it, I get the error message

```
% sage -docbuild reference html
sphinx-build -b html -d /Applications/sage/devel/sage/doc/output/doctrees/en/reference   .  /Applications/sage/devel/sage/doc/output/html/en/reference
Exception occurred:
  File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'sage' is not defined
The full traceback has been saved in /var/folders/JV/JVYCpshdHd4FFoThuUgD8k+++TI/-Tmp-/sphinx-err-l-jOy1.log, if you want to report the issue to the author.
Please also report this if it was a user error, so that a better error message can be provided next time.
```
This is coming from the line

```
defn += eval('str(latex(' + module + "." + name + args + '))') + '}'
```
which, for example, doesn't seem to like doing this:

```
eval('str(latex(sage.rings.all.ZZ))')
```
(A few lines earlier, `from sage.misc.latex import latex` seems to be perfectly acceptable.)

When I run sage and "attach conf.py", then the function `produce_latex_macro` works just fine.  I'm probably making some stupid Python mistake.  Can anyone help?

Ignore my previous remark.  This is now ready for review.

To add new macros, edit these lines in conf.py:

```
sage_macros = [("ZZ", "sage.rings.all"),
               ("RR", "sage.rings.all"),
               ("CC", "sage.rings.all"),
               ("QQ", "sage.rings.all"),
               ("QQbar", "sage.rings.all"),
               ("GF", "sage.rings.all", 17),
               ]
```
The file has comments explaining what to do...

Okay, how about this patch?  This seems to allow use of the imported macros in the notebook (e.g. by shift-clicking between cells and adding "test: $\ZZ$") and in the live versions of the reference manual and the tutorial. Does that definitely mean that it's working well with jsMath?  I'm not sure how to test this...

If you put ``\GF{2^n}`` in a docstring (note the curly braces, not parentheses), then this will appear as `"GF{2^n}"` in a docstring, and it will be typeset as `"\mathbf{F}_{2^n}"` in the reference manual.  In general, given ``\GF{blah}``, then `blah` is not modified: it appears as is in both the docstring and the LaTeX which produces reference manual. It can be a complicated LaTeX expression, for example, and it should work fine.

You can test this by applying the patch and then putting `\GF{2<sup>{3</sup>n}}` somewhere in the tutorial, for example, and then type "sage -docbuild tutorial html" (or "pdf" instead of "html") to check the output, or "sage -docbuild tutorial latex" to check the LaTeX source code.  

Is that good enough, or were you hoping for something else?

Hmm, this patch was not on my radar at all. Given the patch at #5700 which patch here is the current one to apply and review?

Cheers,

Michael

This patch doesn't actually add any examples in the documentation.  However, there are examples, recently added in Sage, which use these macros:

* in sage/algebras/quatalg/quaternion_algebra.py, the functions `ideal`, `left_ideal` and `right_ideal` all use \ZZ, 

* in sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_element.pyx, `is_primitive` uses \GF{-},

* in sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_rational_field.py, `modular_symbol` uses \QQ.

So right now, those docstrings don't appear correctly in the html version of the reference manual, and they actually produce errors in the pdf version.  If you apply the patches here, those issues should be fixed.

Also as I said earlier:

> You can test this by applying the patch and then putting `"\GF{q}"` somewhere in the tutorial, for example, and then type  "sage -docbuild tutorial html" (or "pdf" instead of "html") to check the output, or "sage -docbuild tutorial latex" to check the LaTeX source code.


Does this answer your question?

That's weird...I doctested the whole tree and everything worked. I'm glad to see it was fixed and merged, though.
