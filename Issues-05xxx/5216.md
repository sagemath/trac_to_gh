This is a security issue:

```
Version 1.0.5 removes a potential security vulnerability (CERT-FI 20469 
as it applies to bzip2) in versions 1.0.4 and earlier, so all users are 
recommended to upgrade immediately.
```
and we have been shipping an vulnerable bzip2 release for a while. So upgrade :)

Cheers,

Michael
