The following timings should be able to be improved.

```
       sage: dd = {(0,0):1}
       sage: %timeit matrix(8,dd).det()
       10 loops, best of 3: 213 ms per loop
       sage: %timeit matrix(8,dd,sparse = False).det()
       100 loops, best of 3: 629 Âµs per loop
```
William suggested:
Likely the fix will be to implement
a 1-line function that is just

```
  return self.dense_matrix().det(*args, **kwds)
```
until there is somebody who wants to implement a sparse algorithm.

I would tend to avoid converting to a dense matrix by default since one often uses sparse matrices because they don't have enough memory to store the dense ones.

Sure, but as of right now, I've been waiting over fifteen minutes for 

```
       sage: dd = {(0,0):1}
       sage: %time matrix(100,dd).det()
```

```
       sage: %time matrix(100,dd,sparse=False).det()

Yep, I agree with Jason's position.

We are doing the same for some other LA bits where the sparse methods takes longer **and** uses more memory than the dense method for many cases.

```
sage: dd = {(0,0):1}

It's just that everything is faster now.  How much faster would Moore's law say these should be after four years?

In comment 2, someone complains about this test running for 15 minutes. On your machine, it runs in 228ms (sparse case). This is about 4000x times faster. Moore's law tell you that the number of transistor on a chip doubles every 18 months, so that in 4 years we would have at the very maximum a 10x speedup.

So, there was clearly some improvement. 

However, if you look into it a bit deeper, then you'll see that in the sparse case, computing the determinant triggers the computation of the charpoly(), and the computation of the charpoly creates a dense version of the matrix, then runs the dense charpoly algorithm. I thus agree that this is suboptimal (in particular because linbox has fancy iterative methods for this kind of computation on sparse matrices).

Anyway, why don't we : a) close this ticket, considering that it is outdated and that the situation has changed, and b) open a "feature request" ticket related to sparse matrices over exact rings? I would be happy to look into this.

I get the same thing.  With a heavy load on the same computer (accounting for non-sparse slowdown),

```
sage: dd = {(0,0):1}
sage: %timeit matrix(8,dd).det()
5 loops, best of 3: 207 Âµs per loop
sage: %timeit matrix(8,dd,sparse = False).det()
625 loops, best of 3: 240 Âµs per loop
sage: %timeit matrix(100,dd).det()
25 loops, best of 3: 11.2 ms per loop
sage: %timeit matrix(100,dd,sparse = False).det()
25 loops, best of 3: 23.3 ms per loop
```
Maybe the way we make dictionary-defined matrices dense with `sparse=False` is suboptimal?

I like the patch, though it would be nice if you could find someone who has worked with caching before just to check that that code is correct - I haven't really used it in the past and don't have time to find similar examples in the code now, my apologies.

<div id="comment:11" align="right">comment:11</div>

There is an example of caching (the one I just mimicked...) in matrix_sparse.pyx in the definition of charpoly().

I checked that caching works by computing a large sparse determinant twice : the first call takes a few seconds, while the second call returns instantly.

For the sake of easy reviewing :-) here is the code of charpoly() :

```python
def charpoly(self, var='x', **kwds):
        f = self.fetch('charpoly')
        if f is not None:
            return f.change_variable_name(var)
        f = self.dense_matrix().charpoly(var=var, **kwds)
        self.cache('charpoly', f)
        return f
```

Well, there you have it.  And the way to test it worked was perfect.

Okay, open that other ticket, and then you have yourself a positive review.  Still unclear as to why it's *faster* than the dense case...
