As I mentioned on the list, the Matrix_mod2_dense class has its own str() method that just returns a string representation of the matrix without  taking subdivisions into account.

Removing that method seems to be benign, and lets the common print method for matrices take over, printing with subdivisions.

I have doctested the matrix directory without a problem.  Someone involved in the initial implementations might want to comment.

I'll attach a patch when the testing is complete (or try again if testing fails).
