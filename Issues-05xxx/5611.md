To create this spkg, I took the file [http://www.math.union.edu/~dpvc/jsMath/download/extra-fonts/bbold10/bbold10.zip](http://www.math.union.edu/~dpvc/jsMath/download/extra-fonts/bbold10/bbold10.zip) and unzipped it.  The resulting directory gets installed into SAGE_LOCAL/notebook/javascript/jsMath/fonts; thus jsMath must be installed first.

I've never submitted an spkg before, so let me know what I need to fix.  (For example, there is no mercurial repository here; does it need one?)

This is intended to be a required part of the Sage install; it is necessary for #5610.

<a id='comment:1'></a>Two things:

* this might be better to put in the jsmath.spkg - it is certainly simpler
* please do not attach spkgs to trac since it will be backed up daily until the end of time and a 0.5 MB spkg is rather large and does not compress well.

Cheers,
