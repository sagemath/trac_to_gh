To create this spkg, I took the file [http://www.math.union.edu/~dpvc/jsMath/download/extra-fonts/bbold10/bbold10.zip](http://www.math.union.edu/~dpvc/jsMath/download/extra-fonts/bbold10/bbold10.zip) and unzipped it.  The resulting directory gets installed into SAGE_LOCAL/notebook/javascript/jsMath/fonts; thus jsMath must be installed first.

I've never submitted an spkg before, so let me know what I need to fix.  (For example, there is no mercurial repository here; does it need one?)

This is intended to be a required part of the Sage install; it is necessary for #5610.

Two things:

* this might be better to put in the jsmath.spkg - it is certainly simpler
* please do not attach spkgs to trac since it will be backed up daily until the end of time and a 0.5 MB spkg is rather large and does not compress well.

I need to clear up one thing: the correct spkg to download is here:

[http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/palmieri/SPKG/jsmath-3.6b.p0.spkg](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/palmieri/SPKG/jsmath-3.6b.p0.spkg)

This is the version with the msbm font.  (The one I mentioned earlier also has this font, but the name of the spkg is wrong -- it's not just "jsmath-3.6b.p0" -- and that confuses sage.  The correct one is just a renamed version of the earlier one.)

Install this, install the patch, and things should work...

I think we've waited long enough for the other ticket to appear. I'm giving up and opening this one up for review.

I cleaned up the spkg just a tiny bit (put the fonts directory in the src/ folder and split up the changelog).  The new spkg is here: http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jason/jsmath-3.6b.p1.spkg

Positive review on the spkg and patch.  It seems to work as advertised.
