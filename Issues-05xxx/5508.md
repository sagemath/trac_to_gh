The attached patch implements many improvements for relative number fields.  
In particular a whole load of previously unimplemented functions for ideals in a relative number field now work, and others work better.

Following discussion at
[sage-nt thread](http://groups.google.co.uk/group/sage-nt/browse_thread/thread/16106258cd436515?hl=en-GB),
for several functions the distinction between the relative and absolute 
version has been made explicit, in order to  avoid ambiguity.  
Thus, for example, for a relative number 
field both relative_degree and absolute_degree are defined but degree is 
unimplemented, while for an absolute number field relative_degree, 
absolute_degree and degree are *all* defined (with the same meaning).  
This has entailed a few minor changes to enable 
functions to work with either absolute or relative number fields.

It has been suggested that `NumberField` should only be allowed to generate 
an absolute number field.  I have not implemented this, but I have made `NumberFieldTower` publicly available and used it in several 
doctests.  If a change was made to `NumberField`, `NumberFieldTower` could 
retain the old functionality of `NumberField`.

A number of other minor changes have been made, and these seem to fix
#5276, #5214 and #2551

Attachment: **[sage-5508.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket5508/sage-5508.patch.gz)**

Review:  I read through the patch and was impressed by the thoroughness and attention to detail!  I don't know all the formulas for relative different (etc) off the top of my head, but what is tere looks reasonable.

The patch applies cleanly to 3.4.

Doctesting sage/rings/number_field, the only problem was this:

```
sage -t  "local/sage-3.4/devel/sage-5508/sage/rings/number_field//order.py"
**********************************************************************
File "/home/masgaj/local/sage-3.4/devel/sage-5508/sage/rings/number_field/order.py", line 1196:
    sage: OK(a)
Expected nothing
Got:
    a
**********************************************************************
File "/home/masgaj/local/sage-3.4/devel/sage-5508/sage/rings/number_field/order.py", line 1197:
    sage: a
Expected nothing
Got:
    a
```
which is just a matter of deleting a rogue "sage: " prompt in front of one line of output.

Fix that and this will ready to go.  (I hope it merges ok with my units code at #5513!)

When I built it on top of 3.4 I got `-21/2*b*a - 21/2`, so I think something else must be the cause.  Of course `-8*b*a + 24` is also an acceptable answer.

The new `sage-5508.3.patch` has the revised doctest, but is otherwise the same as `sage-5508.2.patch`

Hope this solves the problem.
