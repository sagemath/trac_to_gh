Notes from Mike looking at this:

* Docs for parse_percent_directives needs to give what is returned
* is_html doesn't need to call parse_percent_directives
* url_to_self should have at least one line of documentation besides the examples
* %hide and %hideall can also be cleaned up from the html and html_in methods (maybe other places)

One positive review.  It's probably important enough that at least one other person ought to review it as well.

Mike and I stepped through the changes, they all look good, and I tested for about 20 minutes with various combinations of the directives and things seemed to work.  I had one glitch, but I can't reproduce it.  I had a cell that looked like:

```
%hide
%hideall
print "hi"
```

I closed the cell, reopened it, then deleted all output, then did a few more things I can't remember.  At one point, the cell changed to:

```
%hide
%hid
```

If we can't reproduce something like this, though, I give it a positive review.
