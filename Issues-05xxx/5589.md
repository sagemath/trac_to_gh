binomial() returns zero when its "numerator" is a negative integer, but gets it right for floating point numbers:

```
sage: binomial(-1, 5)
0
sage: binomial(-2, 5)
0
sage: binomial(-2.0, 5)
-6.00000000000000
sage: binomial(-1.0, 5)
-1.00000000000000
sage: binomial(-7, 5)  
0
sage: binomial(-7.0, 5)
-462.000000000000
```
