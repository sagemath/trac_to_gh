**Review**
* I don't think `sage: a._QuotientRingElement__rep` belongs as an example since it encourages to use hidden attributes directly
* Why don't you replace the doctest in `_add_` and friends with example which involve `+` and friends? This way it is clear when this function is called.

If this is addressed, I'd give it a positive review.

A side question: It seems `QuotientRingElement` is exclusively used for quotient rings over (multivariate) polynomials ideals. Shouldn't it be moved & renamed to `polynomial.QuotientRingPolynomial`?  Also, I guess the API of QRE should be adapted to have all the methods of multivariate polynomials (except those which don't make sense). That'd be another ticket though.

Interesting discussion and patches.  Two comments:

1. Do these quotient ring elements really only work for multiple-variable polynomial rings?  That is a pity.  I have tried working in quotients R/I where R is the rings of integers of a number field and I an integral ideal, but without much joy, and perhaps this is why.

2. Although there are now lots of examples/tests, a lot of functions still lack the one-line description.  (e.g. _integer_(), what is that supposed to do?  I don't believe that there is a sensibly canonical map from any quotient ring to ZZ!).

The intention was definitely that they work for any commutative ring for which there are algorithms to do some basic things with ideals (e.g., test membership).  This may not work well in practice right now.

All I did was add doctests.  Describing what all the functions do is much more work yet.

Regarding `_integer_`, that is *NOT* used for canonical maps.  It's used for forced coercion, e.g., ZZ(alpha).
