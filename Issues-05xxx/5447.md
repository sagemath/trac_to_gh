Upgrading the jQuery and jQuery UI spkgs in Sage will make available several performance improvements and new features for the notebook.  Release notes: [jQuery 1.3 ](http://docs.jquery.com/Release:jQuery_1.3), [jQuery UI 1.7](http://jqueryui.com/docs/Changelog/1.7).

To test the new spkgs, please download and install (e.g., via `sage -f`)

* http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mpatel/trac/5447/jquery-1.3.2.p2.spkg
* http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jason/jqueryui-1.7.2.p3.spkg

**and** apply the rebased [attachment:trac_5447-jquery_upgrade_v3.patch v3 patch] below to 4.1.2.alpha1's sage repository.

Note: When "downgrading" to the previous versions, it may help to delete `local/notebook/javascript/jquery*` manually, since their `spkg-install`s do not erase existing installations.

<a id='comment:3'></a>A first take on a much-desired jQuery / UI upgrade:

* http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mpatel/trac/5447/jquery-1.3.2.p0.spkg
* http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mpatel/trac/5447/jqueryui-1.7.2.p0.spkg

Install both packages and apply [attachment:trac_5447-jquery_upgrade.patch this patch] to the sage repository.  The patch

* Updates the paths to scripts and stylesheets.
* Tweaks `interact.py`'s `html_slider()` and `html_rangeslider()` just enough to get the sliders to work with the new spkgs.
* Cleans up `notebook.py`, somewhat.

I've tested the examples listed in `interact?` with success.  However, the libraries have changed significantly and there may be **many** other ways to break the notebook and ``@`interacts`.  Please test away and provide feeback!

There are still two places that the old location of jquery is referenced:

```
~/sage/devel/sage/sage/server/notebook$ grep -r jquery.js *
notebook.py:           <script type="text/javascript" src="/javascript_local/jquery/jquery.js"></script>
templates/notebook/worksheet.html:<script type="text/javascript" src="/javascript_local/jquery/jquery.js"></script>
