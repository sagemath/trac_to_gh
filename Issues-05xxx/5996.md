The wigner.py file has just been updated so that it passes all tests in sage-4.0 since the new symbolic manipulations return slightly different resutls.

Could someone turn this into a patch and review this please?

Thanks for converting this into a patch.

Concerning (a): doctest coverage is infact 100%. The functions test_calc_factlist() and test_bigDeltacoeff() are the doctest functions for _calc_factlist() and _bigDeltacoeff(), respectively. Unfortunately, putting the doctests into the original functions causes a exception.
If this can be fixed (maybe removing the underscores, but they are supposed to be private), then the doctests can be merged and the test functions deleted.

Concerning (b), (c), I would be happy to help, but I do not know sage well enough. Any help appreciated.

OK, I finally managed to get around to looking at this.  There were still some ReST issues, which I fixed in the latest patch `trac_5996_doc.patch`.  I also added the documentation to the reference manual.

If someone can double-check my patch, we're good to go.

The patches need to be applied in the order they appear on the ticket.

I'm reviewing the coding style and docstring formatting. Here are some problems I notice with the coding style:
1. It doesn't follow many of the coding conventions in the [Developers' Guide](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/conventions.html). In particular, don't use camel case for function name. The following functions are currently in camel case: `Wigner3j`, `ClebschGordan`, `_bigDeltacoeff`, `Racah`, `Wigner6j`, `Wigner9j`, `Gaunt`.
2. The Python code is mostly squashed together and makes little use of white space. For example, instead of writing a function signature like this:

```
def _bigDeltacoeff(aa,bb,cc,prec=None):
```
 it should be written as follows:

```
def _big_delta_coeff(aa, bb, cc, prec=None):
```
 which makes use of white space so it doesn't look like code is squashed together. Another example, don't do this

```
if(int(aa+bb-cc)!=(aa+bb-cc)):
```
 Instead, write it like this:

```
if int(aa + bb - cc) != (aa + bb - cc):
```
 This means that the whole module needs to be reformatted to make use of white space.
1. The docstring of some functions don't follow the guidelines [here](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/conventions.html#docstring-content). In particular, the docstring should be organized with the following two items first:
   1. A one-sentence description of the function, followed by a blank line.
   2. An INPUT and an OUTPUT block for input and output arguments (see below for format). The type names should be descriptive, but do not have to represent the exact Sage/Python types. For example, use “integer” for anything that behaves like an integer; you do not have to put a precise type name such as int.

If no one beats me to it, I'll upload a patch to address the issues I raised above.

Yes, it would be good to have this merged in Sage 4.1.1. But as they now stand, the patches do not conform to a number of coding conventions in addition to conventions regarding docstring formatting.
