The wigner.py file has just been updated so that it passes all tests in sage-4.0 since the new symbolic manipulations return slightly different resutls.

Could someone turn this into a patch and review this please?

A couple of issues remain: (a) doctest coverage is not at 100% since two helper functions are not doctested, (b) the docs need to be rest-ified, and (c) the docs should be added to the reference manual.

So I'm leaving this as "needs work".

OK, I finally managed to get around to looking at this.  There were still some ReST issues, which I fixed in the latest patch `trac_5996_doc.patch`.  I also added the documentation to the reference manual.

If someone can double-check my patch, we're good to go.

The patches need to be applied in the order they appear on the ticket.

But the long-term benefit is that at least the Sage library is standardized on a coding convention. Your new patch should make the reviewing process easier for me.

That way, we don't get a lot of warnings about duplicate citations when building the reference manual. That is, only define one reference. Afterwards, if you need to cite that reference, use the convention for citing it and don't define the same reference locally for a function. Some functions use `<>` when it should be `!=`. At least in Python 2.6.x, using `<>` is OK and is kept in that version for backward compatibility. We should now only use `!=`. These issues, and some minor ones, are addressed in the reviewer patch `trac_5996-reviewer.patch`. Positive review to the ticket as a whole.
