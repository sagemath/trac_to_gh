Also note that `assert` is a statement, not a function -- just like `print` before Python 3.0.\n* My biggest concern is with the getitem stuff. You are effectively shifting the list indices by 1, which really bothers me. Perhaps other people don't feel this way, and perhaps this is the best decision, but whenever I am thinking of something as a list, I *really* want the indices to be zero-based, since that's what the rest of Sage/Python does. Right now, we have:\n\n```\nsage: f = NonDecreasingParkingFunction([1,1,2,3])\nsage: f[2]\n1\nsage: f[3]\n2\n```\n    When I use square brackets, I'm thinking \"list index\", and I really want it zero-based. Perhaps we should make these objects callable, so we can treat them like functions? I would not mind having `f(2)` be 1 and `f(3)` be 2, since the round parentheses indicate a function call, and indeed the above object f is a function that sends 3 to 2.\n\nI'm marking this \"needs work\" because of the list index issue. I have a patch which fixes a bunch of tiny docstring bits which I'll upload once we have the rest of this sorted out.",

<a id='comment:9'>**Comment 9:**</a>
I am working on reviewing this, and I have a couple questions and one larger concern. First, some questions. I'm just curious about these things:

* what does the `@classmethod` decorator do?
* why does the `keys` method return the domain of the function? It seems strange to have a `keys` method for something list-based, and not dictionary-based.

Here are my concerns:
* Your code does not check to see if it gets a list of positive integers, so you can do `NonDecreasingParkingFunction[[0, .1, pi/3, sqrt(2)])`, yikes! Do we want to require lists of positive integers?
* In `is_a()`, you have:

```
   for i in range(len(x)-1):
        if x[i] > x[i+1] or x[i] > i+1:
            return False
```
    Instead of iterating over indices and doing a list lookup every time, would it be faster to use Python's `enumerate` in something like this?

```
   prev = 1
   for i, elt in enumerate(x):
       if prev > elt or elt > i+1:
           return False
       prev = elt
```
    That would also let you finish the function with `return True`, since the `enumerate` loop would check the final element.

* Right now when you give the `NonDecreasingParkingFunction` constructor a bad list, I see a strange error message:

```
sage: NonDecreasingParkingFunction([1,1,4])

```
* Also, related to `is_a`: the `assert` statement should give the user some idea of what has gone wrong. I suggest changing the assert line (line 409) to `assert is_a(lst), 'list is not a non-decreasing parking function.'`. Also note that `assert` is a statement, not a function -- just like `print` before Python 3.0.
* My biggest concern is with the getitem stuff. You are effectively shifting the list indices by 1, which really bothers me. Perhaps other people don't feel this way, and perhaps this is the best decision, but whenever I am thinking of something as a list, I *really* want the indices to be zero-based, since that's what the rest of Sage/Python does. Right now, we have:

```
sage: f = NonDecreasingParkingFunction([1,1,2,3])
sage: f[2]
1
sage: f[3]
2
```
    When I use square brackets, I'm thinking "list index", and I really want it zero-based. Perhaps we should make these objects callable, so we can treat them like functions? I would not mind having `f(2)` be 1 and `f(3)` be 2, since the round parentheses indicate a function call, and indeed the above object f is a function that sends 3 to 2.

I'm marking this "needs work" because of the list index issue. I have a patch which fixes a bunch of tiny docstring bits which I'll upload once we have the rest of this sorted out.
