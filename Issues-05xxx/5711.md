Here is a patch that enhances current typesetting capability
of symbolic functions within sage.

This issue has been under a long discussion in the thread

http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/a51f269f057d8223/536b4ef2493bb20c

**Note: Switch to new symbolics has caused some functions to be changed**

Main enhancements are:

(1) Symbolics functions with name in Greek letters (with possible
suffixes), are typeset nicely in LaTeX.

Ex:  psi(x)  =>  \psi(x)
     f0(x)  =>  f_0(x)


(2) Functions such as "diff", "integrate", "limit", "conjugate",
"laplace", "inverse_laplace" are now typeset within Sage itself.

Ex:  integrate(f(x),x)  =>    \int f(x) dx

(3) Default (fall-back) typesetting for unknown functions (as
in Maxima).

Ex:  myfn(x)   =>  {\it myfn}(x)

(4) **[ This is diasbled in new symbolics. However, equivalent feature will be available in new symbolics ]**
Allows users to define their own/custom LaTeX expression
for any symbolic functions via a new method "set_latex()" for
the class SymbolicFunctionEvaluation.

Ex: 

```
var('t');
hubble(t) = function('hubble',t)
hubble(t).set_latex('\\mathcal{H}')

#To reset custom LaTeX expression
hubble(t).set_latex()
```

(5) **[ This has been disabled in new Symbolics as SymbolicVariable class has changed ]**
If the arguments of a symbolic function are all symbolic
variables then typesetting will avoid using \left(, \right).

Ex:  Phi(x,y) => \Phi(x, y)  (if x,y are symbolic vars)



(6) **[New in the rebased patch]** New symbolics uses "D" 
format for derivatives instead of old "diff" format. 
The rebased patch typesets symbolic derivatives in old "diff" format by default as in this format typeset version looks similar to those found in text books, journals.

However see this thread for known limitations of current conversion between these two formats
 http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/7479c3eeb96348a2

One can switch between two typesetting format as follows

```
f(x) = function('f',x)
g = diff(f(x),x)
latex(g) 
\frac{d f\left(x\right)}{d x}
# Switch to D format
sage.symbolic.pynac.typeset_d_as_diff=False
latex(g)
D[0]f\left(x\right)
```


(7) **[New in the rebased patch]**  The rebased patch resolves
the issue

http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/6268


**[Update: in v3 (4.0.2) ]**

As suggested by Burcin in his referee report, following changes are made in the patch:

**(1)**  Typesetting of "diff" is moved to a new ticket #6344


**(2)**  Four helper functions  _limit_latex_(), _integrate_latex_(), _laplace_latex_() and _inverse_laplace_latex_() have been moved to calculus/calculus.py. Then they are hooked to the instances of SFunction class by using dummy functions for better integration with the new symbolics.


**(3)**  Four earlier functions latex_symbolic_function(), _symbolic_function_default_latex_(), _args_latex_(), _conjugate_latex() are removed.


**(4)**  latex_function_name() is also replaced as the updated latex_variable_name() is augmented to take a new flag "is_fname". This will ensure that same typesetting convention is followed for both known functions such as \sin (:= {\rm sin}), \cos (:= {\rm cos}) and user defined function names such as "mysin" (=> {\rm mysin}).

Yes, recent switch to new symbolics has affected this patch quite a bit.
In fact, the class "SymbolicFunctionEvaluation" (whose enhancement was aimed
through this patch) doesn't exist anymore. I am now looking into the 
new symbolics code to properly rebase the patch.

This seems to be a bug for "exp" function. Other functions such as "abs", "sin" etc work fine. I have posted

Hi Golam,

Thanks for your continued work on this. I see that your patch improves the typesetting of symbolic functions dramatically. I believe with a few improvements it would fit better in the new symbolics framework.

Here is my referee report:

Quotes from the description:
> 
> (2) Functions such as "diff", "integrate", "limit", "conjugate",
> "laplace", "inverse_laplace" are now typeset within Sage itself.
> 
> Ex:  integrate(f(x),x)  =>    \int f(x) dx


These should be handled using the custom printing facilities of `sage.symbolic.function.SFunction`. Special casing them in the new `latex_symbolic_function()` function is not scalable. This approach would also make the checks for the number of arguments as well as the calls to `_symbolic_function_default_latex_()` in each of these functions redundant.

I see that there is already a `_limit` function defined in `sage/calculus/calculus.py`. I think the best solution for the short term would be to put these printing functions there, and give them as an argument to the `SFunction` constructor.

Conjugates are already printed as:

```
sage: latex(x.conjugate())
\bar{x}
```

Why is `\overline` better?

I believe this issue needs more debate, preferably with examples of how Maple and MMA handle this problem. I will post a new message about this to sage-devel soon. For now, I suggest we split this to a different ticket.

Can't this be handled by a call to the new `latex_function_name()` from `sage.symbolic.pynac.py_latex_function_pystring()`?

We have the GiNaC convention of falling back to `\mbox` at the moment. Previously, maxima didn't do anything for function names with one variable, and added an `\it`:

```
sage: version()
'Sage Version 3.4.2, Release Date: 2009-05-05'
sage: var('a')
a
sage: f = function('f')
sage: latex(f(a))
f\left(a\right)

```

As you mention in the docstring for `latex_function_name()`, there is considerable code duplication between this function and `latex_variable_name()`. Your previous response to my question about the differences between these two functions is here:

http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/msg/071207efa39c5356

It seems that your goal of returning a different response as default behavior can be achieved by passing a parameter to the `latex_varify()` calls at the end of `latex_variable_name()`. Is there a reason why the further recursions performed by `latex_variable_name()` are not relevant for function names? In any case, the string processing code in `latex_variable_name()` shouldn't be duplicated.

This seems to be caused by a thinko on my part. It can be fixed by modifying lines 416-149 in `sage/symbolic/pynac.pyx`. You seem to do something similar at the end of `latex_symbolic_function()` and `_symbolic_function_default_latex_()` functions.


Overall I think the patch looks very crowded and confusing. With the changes suggested above, 
* the new functions  `latex_symbolic_function()`, `_symbolic_function_default_latex_()`, `_args_latex_()`, can be eliminated.
* derivative related functions `latex_d_derivative()` and `_derivative_latex_()` should be split to a new ticket.
* specialized printing functions `_integrate_latex_()`, `_inverse_laplace_latex_()`, `_laplace_latex_()`, `_limit_latex_()` should be moved to `sage/calculus/calculus.py` and hooked up to the right `sage.symbolic.function.SFunction` instance.
* `_conjugate_latex_()` doesn't seem necessary.

Could you please give an short example for such construction (my current understanding 
of new symbolics is limited)? 

What is your "long-term" solution? 

Why is it better to put these functions in calculus/calculus.py 
even as a "short term" solution?  (I gather from William's note http://480.sagenb.org/home/pub/45/ that 
"calculus" direcotory is to be deleted. This conflicts with your suggestion.)


> {{{

"\bar" is ok for variable but is insufficient for symbolic functions. Please try the
followings in the notebook: 

```
jsmath('\\bar{\\psi\\left(x, y\\right)}') 
jsmath('\\overline{\\psi\\left(x, y\\right)}') 
```
then you will see the reason yourself.

Sure, I will open a new ticket for this.

Provided all other symbolic "functions" ("integrate",...) have been typeset 
somewhere else which is not the case at present.

Frankly, it is disappointing to see another inconsistent typesetting.
 
Why should a function named "sin" should be typseset as "\sin" (=>"\rm sin")
where as another function named "mysin" is typeset as "\mbox{mysin}"? Please compare 
them side-by-side to see the contrast.


> Previously, maxima didn't do anything for function names with one variable, and added an `\it`:



So as in this patch!  Though, I wanted to use "\rm" as {\rm myfunc} but decided to
stick to maxima usage.

I agree that we should avoid duplication of code. 


> Is there a reason why the further recursions performed by `latex_variable_name()` 
> are not relevant for function names? 



In physics, we often use functions such as "f_{\alpha\beta}". In sage, if I use
current latex_variable_name() to typeset "f_alpha_beta" then it would typeset 
as f_{{\alpha}_{\beta}} which is completely different. 

However I guees, thats my own preference and I shouldn't argue anymore on this.
I guess #6290 will solve my problem altogether.

I will remove latex_function_name() and use latex_variable_name() instead.

+**(2)**  Four helper functions  _limit_latex_(), _integrate_latex_(), _laplace_latex_() and _inverse_laplace_latex_() have been moved to calculus/calculus.py. Then they are hooked to the instances of SFunction class by using dummy functions for better integration with the new symbolics.
+
+
+**(3)**  Four earlier functions latex_symbolic_function(), _symbolic_function_default_latex_(), _args_latex_(), _conjugate_latex() are removed.
+
+
+**(4)**  latex_function_name() is also replaced as the updated latex_variable_name() is augmented to take a new flag "is_fname". This will ensure that same typesetting convention is followed for both known functions such as \sin (:= {\rm sin}), \cos (:= {\rm cos}) and user defined function names such as "mysin" (=> {\rm mysin}).

[Snip]
I am very fond of the set_latex() method for defining custom latex representations, which would allow for multiple subscripts etc. Unfortunately, it has been disabled with the new symbolics. Is there a plan to re-enable it again? In general, I think that it would be nice to give as much control to the user as possible, rather than hard-coding certain latex representations. Sorry I haven't been of any help with reviewing/patching, but I only now got back to the typesetting issues and found that my previous ad-hoc latex definitions don't work in Sage 4.x any more. :(

Great work, anyway, and many thanks to those that invested time and effort into improving the typesetting in Sage!

Yes but in a new avatar! The new method would be more powerful. The patch is
