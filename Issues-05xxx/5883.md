There is optimised code in p1list.pyx for creating the list of points on P1 over Z/NZ.  It would be nice to also have this available as, for instance:

```
sage: P1 = ProjectiveSpace(1, Integers(N))
sage: P1.rational_points()
```


Keywords: **rational points projective line finite**

Component: **algebraic geometry**
