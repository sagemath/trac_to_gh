Ryan Hinton pointed out that for groups of prime order n every non-identity element has order n.  The current implementation of order_from_multiple() computes `g^n` twice when g is not the identity and n is prime.

The attached patch avoids this: for each prime p dividing the given multiple M of the order, we avoid the last multiplication/powering by p, so there is a saving whenever the p-exponent of the order is maximal.

In an example where the order is `2^1279-1` (a Mersenne prime) the times was reduced from 100ms to 70ms.

Patch applies cleanly and passes doctests.  I don't understand what `val_unit` does, so I am unsure whether I'm qualified to give a positive review.

Thanks for the fast review.

Here is what val_unit does.  Given a nonzero integer or rational n and a prime p, you can write n uniquely as `n = m*p^e` where m is not divisible by p (if rational, neither the numerator nor the denominator of m is divisible by p).   We call e the valuation of m at p  (which can be obtained on its own by n.valuation(p)) and m the "unit" part of n at p (which can be obtained on its own by n.prime_to_m_part(p)).  Using val_unit() gives these together which is more efficient as they are computed together.

It's an operation frequently needed in number theory!

I added "needs review" which I forgot to do earlier.  If you are happy with val_unit() you can change that, or I can hit someone else to take a look.
