This patch implements sage.structure.dynamic_class.dynamic_class, for constructing dynamically new python classes. The constructed classes can be pickled, and have unique representation.

The patch includes a discussion on the relevance of dynamic classes for Sage.

Depends on #5985 for pickling and #5120.

Used by the upcoming category framework #5891, (and sage-words?)

Issue: is sage.structure.dynamic_class.dynamic_class the natural location for this?
