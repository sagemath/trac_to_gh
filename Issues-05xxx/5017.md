This worked in sage-3.1.2 and before, giving
  (Permutation Group with generators [(1,2)(3,4)], {0: 4, 1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3})

In sage-3.2.1 and later this fails.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

sage: sage: foo = Graph()

sage:  sage: foo.add_edges([(0,1,1),(1,2,2), (2,3,3)])

sage:  sage: foo.automorphism_group(translation=True)
 (Permutation Group with generators [(1,2)(3,4)], {0: 4, 1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3})

sage: 

```


looking at the code, patch seems ok.
