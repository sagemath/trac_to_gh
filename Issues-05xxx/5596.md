The content of infinity.py.rej is essentially that now there are "ValueErrors" instead of "TypeErrors" to be exchanged.

Thanks for working on this. This will be a big step forward in debuggability or coercion problems!
In particular, reducing the amount of poking around "let's try if this method does not break horribly on this element" is
definitely going in the right direction. 

I just went through the patch, and each change sounds sensible. I haven't checked that they are 100% correct, by lack of expertise.
In particular, I haven't checked line by line the big chunks of diffs corresponding to indentation changes (inclusion in a try).

Overall, +1 for setting positive review, but I would prefer if some expert could double check.

I am now on my way to run the tests, and see how this patch interact with the category patches.


One comment:

In Sage-Combinat, we often have operations which are partially defined, and return None when they are not. How does this fit with the
change in the specifications of `_mul_` and friends, suggesting to return None rather than raising NotImplemented?

Should "Returning None indicates that this action is not implemented" be replaced by something like:

"Returning None indicates that this action is not defined, or not implemented here, for the given elements"?

Alternatively, I could possibly suggest to instead check that self._lmul (say) is
not the default "NotImplemented" implementation of Element, before actually calling it. I guess I am trying to have an analogue of
the abstract_method idiom for cpdef methods. Would it be possible to attach some sort of "abstract method" flag to a cpdef method,
that we could test without actually having to execute the method?

But I don't mind if this waits for a later patch.

although it is always a good thing to have "some expert" double checking a patch.
But who else, but you two, could you think of for reviewing this specific patch?

If you could point out to me certain "suspicious" lines, I would be happy to look at these, and listen to your explanations, and learn something from it, but I fear that's all I can do. There are damn few experts around for programming "code doing coercions" ...

I'll second Georg's comments, you are as much of an "expert" in this area as nearly anyone else (except maybe me, but I can't review it myself...).

I saw some tests failing--looks like easy fixes, I'll try and post a patch later tonight.

I'll change that to say "not implemented here."

This can be done, kind of, if one knows the baseclass where the "abstract" method is implemented, though it's a bit hackish. I think you underestimate how fast calling a c(p)def method can be though. 

> But I don't mind if this waits for a later patch.

Yeah, that'd take some thinking, probably best put off 'till later.

Argl. I am always off by one version. I now have to compile a 4.1.2 alpha4

Oh, thanks for pointing this.

No, I am not worried at all about speed, but about semantic and lazyness. Let's say we are investigating whether there is an action of A on B. That's (mostly) a mathematical question about the parents A and B. So it's preferable to "ask them", rather than poking around with some of their elements (which could have some special property). Part of it comes from experience with MuPAD telling that lot of trouble can be avoided if a parent does not construct any element unless asked for explicitly; in particular, lazyness helps handling cross-dependent parents. At the same time, a coercion lookup may involve many intermediate parents which will, or not, play a role in the end.

Now: what do I mean by "ask them". That can be using introspection, possibly on their element class. Preferably, it would be by having A and B (or some common boss) declare explicitly the action
to the coercion system. I actually have in my stack of todo's a preliminary implementation of this, as this is needed for symmetric functions and friends.

Hmm, that discussion is becoming long. We should move it to sage-devel.

> Yeah, that'd take some thinking, probably best put off 'till later. 

Ok. So I put a positive review, pending confirmation that all tests pass smoothly on 4.1.2 alpha4.

Yup.

 I should have said that my comment about speed was under the assumption that the coercion lookup was cached.
