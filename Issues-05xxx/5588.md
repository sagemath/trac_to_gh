The attachment does the following things:

1. It says that the Sage style for typesetting the standard rings (ZZ, CC, etc.) is to use mathbf, not mathbb.

2. It discusses trying to achieve a balance between the appearance of the docstring in interactive help vs. in the reference manual.

3. In the paragraph starting "Finally", it mentions some nonstandard macros available for use in docstrings.  This part depends on #5555.

4. It mentions that methods which start with an underscore don't appear in the reference manual, and this should be taken into consideration when writing documentation. The example in this part depends on #5529.

Replying to [ticket:5588 jhpalmieri]:
> 1. It says that the Sage style for typesetting the standard rings (ZZ, CC, etc.) is to use mathbf, not mathbb.

I wonder if that was a conscious decision or whether it is just as it is (I personally prefer mathbb over mathbf).
