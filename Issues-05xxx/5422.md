**Attachment:** [11731.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket5422/11731.patch)

REFEREE REPORT:


* change it to 

```
  EXAMPLES::
  
      sage: stuff
```
for the new ReST format.

* Don't hardcode only x, i.e., change this:

```
polynomial(self):
```
to 

```
polynomial(self, names='x'):
```

Yes, "names" sounds funny, but is traditional in sage for this.

* Change "Input:" and "Output:" to be all caps and on their own line, like in the rest of sage. 

* This is silly code `[R.gens()[i] for i in range(n)]` because `R.gens()` is almost the same thing.  If you really need a list do `list(R.gens())`.

* This worries me: `(M*V).dot_product(V) `.  Should it be `(V*M).dot_product(V)`?

Two things:
You need to list 'names' under the input section of the docstring.
Secondly, you forgot a period in your error message.

Otherwise good :-)

I have some issues with this patch, which I hope will get fixed in a followup patch:

1. The ReST formatting is wrong for the list of inputs:

```
        1125	            -'self' - a quadratic form over a commatitive ring. 
 	1126	            -'names' - the name of the variables. Digits will be appended to the name for each different canonical 
 	1127	            variable e.g x1, x2, x3 etc. 
```
but it should be

```
        1125	            - 'self' - a quadratic form over a commatitive ring. 
 	1126	            - 'names' - the name of the variables. Digits will be appended to the name for each different canonical 
 	1127	              variable e.g x1, x2, x3 etc. 
```

Note the space after dash and the matching indention right before "variable".

2. I do not like this naked except, and think except: should almost never be used in Python:

```
        1160	        try: 
 	1161	            R = PolynomialRing(self.base_ring(),names,n) 
 	1162	        except: 
 	1163	            raise ValueError, 'Can only create polynomial rings over commutative rings.' 
```
How do you know that the error in creating the polynomial ring was due to poly ring not working because the ring is not commutative?   I would actually recommend just changing the above to:

```
                    R = PolynomialRing(self.base_ring(),names,n)
```
and completely get rid of the exception.     A proper exception will get raised by the PolynomialRing function itself.
