Refactor the set partitions code to have a single entry point in the global name space for the various types. I.e. from the user point of view, replace the following names in the global name space:
- SetPartitions, SetPartitionsIk, SetPartitionsRk, SetPartitionsAk, SetPartitionsPRk  SetPartitionsSk, SetPartitionsBk, SetPartitionsPk, SetPartitionsTk

By something like:
 	SetPartitions(..., type=["A",3])
