Refactor the set partitions code to have a single entry point in the global name space for the various types. I.e. from the user point of view, replace the following names in the global name space:
- SetPartitions, SetPartitionsIk, SetPartitionsRk, SetPartitionsAk, SetPartitionsPRk  SetPartitionsSk, SetPartitionsBk, SetPartitionsPk, SetPartitionsTk

By something like:
 	SetPartitions(..., type=["A",3])

This is not a duplicate of #14234 since that does not remove these from the global namespace, deprecate them, nor correctly pass along the correct object. There is still work to be done here, so please reopen this ticket.
