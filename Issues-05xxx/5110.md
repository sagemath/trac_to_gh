What exactly should be added to diagonal_matrix? I'd be happy to work on this ticket but it looks like the other patches in #3704 add doctests.

I think the idea is to use attachment:trac-3704-diagonal_matrix.patch:ticket:3704 to make a more generally applicable function.

That said, there are probably more important tickets to work on, notably reviewing many in symbolics ...

I did see that patch, but looking at the source code for diagonal_matrix(), the differences seem to be

1. Changing the parameters
2. More comments and doctests
3. Casting to Sequence

1 could be a good fix since the current function uses "arg0, arg1, arg2" which is pretty bad, but in my opinion, 2 and 3 are not necessary (although if we do change 1 we will need to change 2).
