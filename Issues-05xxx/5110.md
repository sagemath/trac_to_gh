See the patches at #3704, which rewrite diagonal_matrix.  On that ticket, however, we finally just went with a basic patch that fixed the specific bug mentioned.  There is good code in the other patches that ought to be used, though.  This ticket is here so that we eventually use the cleaner rewrite contained in the first patches at #3704.

What exactly should be added to diagonal_matrix? I'd be happy to work on this ticket but it looks like the other patches in #3704 add doctests.

I did see that patch, but looking at the source code for diagonal_matrix(), the differences seem to be

1. Changing the parameters
2. More comments and doctests
3. Casting to Sequence

1 could be a good fix since the current function uses "arg0, arg1, arg2" which is pretty bad, but in my opinion, 2 and 3 are not necessary (although if we do change 1 we will need to change 2).
