I *really* need this for my research.

Note, I only really need the case R=ZZ, and what I'll implement is likely to be this for any R that has a Smith normal form algorithm, e.g., class number 1. 

I am finding and fixing some major bugs in basic linear algebra that have to be fixed in order to implement this.  Thus this patch depends on: #5886, #5887, #5972, #5974

**Assignee:** @williamstein

**CC:**  @jhpalmieri @loefflerd @antieau

**Resolution:** fixed

**Author:** William Stein, David Loeffler

**Reviewer:** Robert Miller, John Palmieri

The one remaining problem: Some of the bug fixes in linear algebra included in this patch (or possibly, but unlikely, the dependency patches), cause a serious performance regression:

IN SAGE-3.4.1:

```
sage: time EllipticCurve('858k2').sha().an_padic(Integer(7))
CPU times: user 8.65 s, sys: 0.37 s, total: 9.02 s
```

After these patches the same takes much much longer (many minutes).  Using `set_verbose(2)` one sees that the codepaths are different.

It's not surprising that fixing bugs would uncover other buggy code and major performance issues, since buggy code is often very fast :-).

Random comments while various people (like rlm (I hope) and me) work on more thorough reviews:

- the new files should be added to the reference manual, and there is some misformatted reST, which the attached patch fixes.  It also moves docs from the `__init__` methods to the classes, as rlm suggests.

- I don't understand the point (or maybe the documentation) for M.optimized():

 ```
 This has the advantage that any homomorphism from self extends to a homomorphism from V
 ```
 If I have a map f: V/W --> Z, then I certainly get a map g: V --> Z: just compose the quotient map V --> V/W with f.

- the argument "check" should be documented: I can see what it does by reading the source code, but it should be described in `FGP_module` and `FGP_Module_class.__init__` (or actually in `FGP_Module_class`), and wherever else it's used.

Yes, I should change that, since of course any homomorphism extends.  The point is that with M.optimized() it *trivially extends* because
the gens for M.optimized().V() are *exactly the same* as the gens for M.  Also, the dimension of M.optimized().V() is the same as the rank of M.

> the argument "check" should be documented:


I can't disagree with that -- all options should be documented with examples.

> It looks like this didn't happen... 


I was going to change them, but realized it will break compatibility with quotients of vector spaces, which have used V and W for a year now.  I prefer instead just adding two new methods "cover()" and "relations()" that just return V() and W(), both to fgp modules and to quotients of vector spaces.  Then everything is backward compatible and old code doesn't break.

A partial review; I've looked at the files *not* in the fg_pid directory, and I'm happy with them except for the minor comments below about free_module_morphism.py.  I'm now working through the files in the fg_pid directory, and I'm about halfway through fgp_module.py.

*******************************************

In free_module_morphism.py: 

in `inverse_image`, is there any speed gain if you check whether the rank of the homomorphism is zero at the beginning?  that is, change

```
  if self.domain().rank() == 0:
     return self.domain() 
```
to

```
  if self.domain().rank() == 0 or self.rank() == 0:
     return self.domain() 
```
or even to

```
  if self.rank() == 0:
     return self.domain() 
```

A very minor issue: In `inverse_image`, in the lines

```
     if R.is_field(): 
           # By solving, find lifts of each of the basis elements of V. 
           # Each row of Y gives a linear combination of the basis for the domain 
           # that maps to one of the basis elements V. 
           C = A.solve_left(B) 
```
change "Each row of Y" to "Each row of C"?

*******************************************

fgp_module.py:

the function FGP_Module: documentation should say what it returns: V/W as a f.g. R-module.  For the inputs, V and W need to be free R-modules.

`_coerce_map_from_`: I think that V/W should have a coercion from V, so testing isinstance(S, FGP_Module_class) won't work.  More generally, you should have coercions from anything of the form V/W' to V/W, as long as W' is contained in W: that is, you should have coercions not just from submodules, but also from modules with canonical surjections onto V/W.  (There may be many maps from V to V/W, but there is one *canonical* map, so I think there should be a coercion map.)

in free_module.py, there is a `__cmp__` method but not an `__eq__` method, and here it's the other way around.  Is this an issue?  Do we have a policy about which one to use?

Here's a problem with is_submodule:

```
sage: V = FreeModule(ZZ, 1)
sage: W = V.submodule([0*V.0])
sage: W2 = V.submodule([2*V.0])
sage: V/W  # isomorphic to Z
Finitely generated module V/W over Integer Ring with invariants (0)
sage: V/W2  # isomorphic to Z/2Z
Finitely generated module V/W over Integer Ring with invariants (2)
sage: (V/W).is_submodule(V/W2)
True
```
This is because the implementation is wrong: if you want V/W to be a submodule of V'/W', then you want V to be a submodule of V', and the inclusion map should induce a surjection of W onto W' (hence an isomorphism between W and W' -- given an injection V --> V' which induces a map W --> W', the induced map must be an injection also).  Should you change the end from

```
        return self.V().is_submodule(A.V()) and self.W().is_submodule(A.W())
```
to

```
        return self.V().is_submodule(A.V()) and self.W() == A.W()
```
The docstring should be changed to reflect this, as should the doctests; in the existing doctests, I don't think that A is actually a submodule of Q.  In the simpler (but somewhat analogous) situation of Z/2Z and Z/4Z, then although abstractly Z/2Z is a submodule of Z/4Z, the identity map Z --> Z does not induce the inclusion.  The identity map Z --> Z induces an inclusion 4Z --> 2Z, which then induces a *surjection* Z/4Z --> Z/2Z.

Also, the first sentence of the docstring is wrong: it says "Return True if A is a submodule of self", and it should be "Return True if self is a submodule of A".

base_ring: delete the comment (`# this will be done in `__init__``)?

`_smith_form_`: document the form of the output, or at least give a reference to smith_form from matrix2.pyx.

invariants needs a docstring, not just doctests.  (The term "invariants" is used frequently in fgp_module.py, but is never defined.)  Document the argument "include_ones"?

gens: in the docstring, change "lements" to "elements".  Change it to "elements g0,...,gn of self"?  (Add "of self"?)

is it worth changing "isinstance(x, FGP_Module_class)" to "is_FGP_Module(x)" many places in this file?  (Otherwise, is "is_FGP_Module" used anywhere?  We could delete it...)


I'm still working on this file, and I haven't looked at fgp_morphism or fgp_element in any detail yet (except to note that the in the docstring for FGP_Morphism, the comment "where the morphism doesn't extend to V1" needs to be rephrased).  I'm going on a family trip tomorrow, though, so I may not have time to work on this for a few days.

My next installment: this finishes up with the file fgp_module.py.

coordinate_vector:

```
self.optimized() # computes T as side effect -- see above
```
Should say "see below", I think.

optimize: in the comments

```
        # Compute matrix X of linear transformation from self._V to V.
        # This matrix X gives each basis element of self._V in terms
        # of our new optimized V, modulo the W's.
```
Maybe "X" should be replaced by "T".  If not, then "T" should be described, since it's cached, and so is presumably important.

hom: if `len(im_gens) == 0`, then we can't use `M.hom(...)` to define the zero map to another module.  Should we be able to?  That is, should we be able to specify the codomain explicitly instead of the method using `N = im_gens.universe()`?

random_element: wouldn't it be better to pick a random element from self.optimized()[0]._V?

right before random_fgp_module: ZZ has already been imported

random_fgp_module: say that ``R`` is optional, default ZZ

***********************

A general question: What's the obstruction to implementing this for modules over k[x], for k a field, or for general PIDs?  This should be documented somewhere so interested people know what to work on.

***********************

I hope to get to the last two files soon.

Okay, I'm done with my review.  Earlier, I discussed everything except the files "fgp_element.py" and "fgp_morphism.py".  The file "fgp_element.py" looks good to me.  The file "fgp_morphism.py" is mostly good, but I have a few comments:

FGP_Morphism: as mentioned avove, need to fix the part of the docstring which says "where the morphism doesn't extend to V1"

FGP_Morphism, `__init__`: can we delete the line

```
    from sage.matrix.all import diagonal_matrix
```

Also in `__init__`: Do you expect the error messages like "domain of phi must be V for MO" to ever appear?  They are pretty cryptic -- if you haven't read the code, you won't know what "V for MO" means.

In `__call__`: when x is an FGP_Module, should you check that x is a submodule of self.domain() and return an appropriate error if not?

I note that in "image", you call FGP_Module with `check=False`, but you don't have this in "kernel".  Should you use `check=False` there, too?

Should "preimage" be a synonym for "lift"?  Or should there be a method "preimage" which acts like "lift" on elements, but also works on submodules?

In `_coerce_map_from_`: should there be a coercion from Hom(X,Y) to Hom(X,Z) if there is a coercion from Y to Z?  Should there be a coercion from Hom(X,Y) to Hom(W,Y) if there is a coercion from W to X?


Overall, this is very impressive, and it will be great to have this as part of Sage.

I have been working on this as part of a Sage Days 16 project to reimplement abelian groups. The above patch:

- adds new methods `_element_class` and `_subquotient_class` which can be overridden by derived classes

- adds a new method `has_canonical_map_to` which does what `is_submodule` previously did, and changes `is_submodule` so it is true if and only if the canonical map exists *and is injective*.

- adjusts some things relating to `gens`, so derived classes can have generators which are not necessarily in Smith form, and made the necessary corresponding changes to `hom`. There are now separate methods `smithform_gens` and `gens`, and the "internal" uses of generators all call `smithform_gens`, so it is safe for derived classes to override `gens`.

I *haven't* changed the printing code, as I threatened to do last week -- on reflection I decided that elements comparing as equal and printing as unequal was just too confusing.

In the docstring for `_element_class`, should "creating subquotients" say "creating elements"?

> changes is_submodule


I like your change, but I would like `is_submodule` to have more documentation, saying (for example) that it returns True if self.V() is a submodule of A.V(), with self.W() equal to A.W().

I don't have much of an opinion about this either way, but do you want to rename `smithform_gens` to `_smithform_gens` so it's less visible?

For `annihilator`: the first line of the docstring ends a bit abruptly.  Should this method return an actual ideal, not just an element of the ring?

"A is contained in B", which isn't the case at all.  But I don't want
to potentially break the API of the general free_module code in this
patch.

DONE -- good change.  David Loeffler also found this issue and "fixed"
the code, but his fix was wrong too (it basically ignored the V's).

By the way, after making the above fix then running doctests, the
automated randomized testing code *did* find a bug in the image
command.  I fixed that by changing

        V = self._phi.image()

to

        V = self._phi.image() + self.codomain().W()

in the image method in fgp_morphism.py

FOR NEW TICKETS:

* Add a method "preimage" that acts like "lift" on elements, but also works on submodules.

* There should be a coercion from Hom(X,Y) to Hom(X,Z) if there is a
  coercion from Y to Z. There should there be a coercion from Hom(X,Y) to
  Hom(W,Y) if there is a coercion from W to X.

DONE

After hearing how say Henri Cohen thinks about abelian groups, I think
it is probably a good idea having smith_form_gens be user-visible.
It's an important function, and pretty canonical, and will be used
from outside the class (that was the motivation for introducing it).

DONE, and added another doctest that illustrates the case when the
annihilator is 0.  Yes, it should return an ideal, and I fixed it so
it will.

David said:
> For annihilator, essentially it is just there so I can use it to do
>  exponent for abelian groups, so I do want it to return an element.


Well in the docstring you wrote *ideal*.  And it straightforward to
get the generator of an ideal, so I made it an ideal.

We're going to generalize all this soon enough to general commutative
base rings (singular supports this sort of thing well, actually), and
when we do so as much as possible we'll want to have a consistent API.
So we should make annihilator return an ideal.
