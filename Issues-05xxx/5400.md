Using Sage 3.4.alpha0:

```
sage: RDF(e^(1j))
ERROR: An unexpected error occurred while tokenizing input
The following traceback may be corrupted or invalid
The error message is: ('EOF in multi-line statement', (1419, 0))

ERROR: An unexpected error occurred while tokenizing input
The following traceback may be corrupted or invalid
The error message is: ('EOF in multi-line statement', (1535, 0))

ERROR: An unexpected error occurred while tokenizing input
The following traceback may be corrupted or invalid
The error message is: ('EOF in multi-line statement', (1419, 0))

ERROR: An unexpected error occurred while tokenizing input
The following traceback may be corrupted or invalid
The error message is: ('EOF in multi-line statement', (1419, 0))

(then a TypeError is thrown since I don't have an RDF value)

```

Now, of course, the above gives a TypeError, but there still shouldn't be the scary preparser error.

I assume you know about the CC field, so what is the problem? 

Many account holders in trac are listed at http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/wiki
