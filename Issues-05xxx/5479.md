The attached patch implements the `__call__` method.  For this I needed to fix a few things in `schemes/generic/point.py` (which has 0 doctests!).  I doctested the methods that I touched there, and I'll improve the doctest coverage further in another patch.

**Attachment:** [trac_5479.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket5479/trac_5479.patch)

David Roe pointed out in IRC that "generic point" has a well-defined technical meaning so it shouldn't be used in the `_repr_` method of `SchemeMorphism`.  So I've attached an updated patch that fixes the handful of occurrences of "Generic point".
