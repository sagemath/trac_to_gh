The notebook help screen has links to the reference manual and so on. Those links point to the doc repo where the static html lives. Once #5410 is done those links should be fixed to point to the new static html.

<a id='comment:2'>Comment 2:</a>
The documentation links mostly work once the needed html documentation has been created, i.e.

```
./sage -docbuild reference html
./sage -docbuild tutorial html
./sage -docbuild developer html
./sage -docbuild constructions html
```
The only thing not working after that is the "Fast Static Versions of the Documentation" link from the main help page.

Cheers,

Michael

```
"$SAGE_LOCAL/bin"/sage-docbuild --jsmath all html

and I don't see a file sage-docbuild anywhere.  Should it be "sage -docbuild"?

Hi John,

Actually, mabshoff and I fixed that bit in person so that it does the right thing.  But, you're right, it should be "$SAGE_ROOT"/sage -dodbuild.  We'll post the actual diff here in a sec.
