The notebook help screen has links to the reference manual and so on. Those links point to the doc repo where the static html lives. Once #5410 is done those links should be fixed to point to the new static html.

The documentation links mostly work once the needed html documentation has been created, i.e.

```
./sage -docbuild reference html
./sage -docbuild tutorial html
./sage -docbuild developer html
./sage -docbuild constructions html
```
The only thing not working after that is the "Fast Static Versions of the Documentation" link from the main help page.

Cheers,

Michael

Does this depend on another ticket?  If not, trac_5414-install.diff has the line 

```
"$SAGE_LOCAL/bin"/sage-docbuild --jsmath all html
```
and I don't see a file sage-docbuild anywhere.  Should it be "sage -docbuild"?

Hi John,

Actually, mabshoff and I fixed that bit in person so that it does the right thing.  But, you're right, it should be "$SAGE_ROOT"/sage -dodbuild.  We'll post the actual diff here in a sec.
