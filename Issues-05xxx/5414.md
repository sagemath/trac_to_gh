The notebook help screen has links to the reference manual and so on. Those links point to the doc repo where the static html lives. Once #5410 is done those links should be fixed to point to the new static html.

<div id="comment:2" align="right">Comment 2</div>

The documentation links mostly work once the needed html documentation has been created, i.e.

```
./sage -docbuild reference html
./sage -docbuild tutorial html
./sage -docbuild developer html
./sage -docbuild constructions html
```
The only thing not working after that is the "Fast Static Versions of the Documentation" link from the main help page.

Cheers,

Michael

Hi John,

Actually, mabshoff and I fixed that bit in person so that it does the right thing.  But, you're right, it should be "$SAGE_ROOT"/sage -dodbuild.  We'll post the actual diff here in a sec.
