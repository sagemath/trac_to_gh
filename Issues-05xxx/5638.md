From the command line, jsmath is kind of broken and is also superfluous: `jsmath('blah', mode='inline')` is basically equivalent to `html('$blah$')`, and similarly if mode='display': just use '$$blah$$'.  This patch removes jsmath from import into the global name space at the command line, rewrites the code to make it just call html, and adds a deprecation warning.
