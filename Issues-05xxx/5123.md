This caused me trouble when preparing for my class today:

```
sage: k.<X> = GF(2)[]
sage: xgcd(X^2, X+1)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NotImplementedError
sage: (X^2).xgcd(X+1)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NotImplementedError
```

Note that PARI can do this, so that's an easy shortcut to implement *something*:

```
sage: pari(X^2).xgcd(X+1)
(Mod(1, 2), Mod(1, 2), Mod(1, 2)*X + Mod(1, 2))
```

Component: **basic arithmetic**
