When unpacking a Sage 3.3 binary the update of easy-install.pth is broken:

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Sage Version 3.3, Release Date: 2009-02-21                         |
| Type notebook() for the GUI, and license() for information.        |
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The SAGE install tree may have moved.
Regenerating Python.pyo and .pyc files that hardcode the install PATH (please wait at
most a few minutes)...
Do not interrupt this.
Warning: something went wrong updating the easy-install.pth file.
```

Component: **build**
