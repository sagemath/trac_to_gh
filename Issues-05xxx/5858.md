Email from sage-support describes the problem and Michael Abshoff's comments about what needs to be done:

The problem is that the libz shipped by Sage and the one used by the
system (and which was linked by Octave) do not play nicely together.

To work around this write a script called octave (I assume that is the
name of the octave start script/binary

#!/bin/sh
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=SAGE_ORIG_LD_LIBRARY_PATH; export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
exec octave "$@"

I didn't try this, so you might need to adjust something.

To fix this once and for all in sage we should use native execute -
would someone open a ticket since I am about to go offline for the
night :)

Cheers,

Michael
