```
sage: latex.add_to_preamble('\\usepackage{blah}')

Passes tests on misc/latex.py and misc/latex_macros.py in 3.4.2.alpha0, and works as advertised at command-line and in notebook.

PDF version of documentation builds fine also.  Another great addition to Sage-LaTeX integration.

So this is ready to go - positive review.
