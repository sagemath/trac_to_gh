Here's an attempt at this.  To use it:

```
sage: latex.add_macro('\\newcommand{\\foo}{bar}')
```
and then a %latex cell with \\foo in it will be processed correctly, as will %jsmath and %html cells.  Also,

```
sage: latex.add_to_preamble('\\usepackage{blah}')
```
will do what it says; it should only have an effect on %latex cells.

(In this patch, "macros" are things which are processed by latex and jsmath, while the "preamble" is only passed to latex.  For both categories, you can add to the current string with latex.add_macro or latex.add_preamble, or you can replace it with latex.extra_macros or latex.extra_preamble.)

Some pictures are [here](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/palmieri/misc/foobar.png) and [here](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/palmieri/misc/ext.png).

Anyway, please test it out; the patch is against 3.4.2.alpha0.

Passes tests on misc/latex.py and misc/latex_macros.py in 3.4.2.alpha0, and works as advertised at command-line and in notebook.

PDF version of documentation builds fine also.  Another great addition to Sage-LaTeX integration.

So this is ready to go - positive review.
