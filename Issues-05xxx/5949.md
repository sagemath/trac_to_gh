Memory is leaked when polynomial rings involving libSingular are deleted:

```
while 1:
    p = random_prime(1<<50)
    R.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(GF(p))

```
Valgrind pretty much points at libSingular:^^

```
This translates to rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_libsingular.pyx +359, more specifically the rComplete() line in

```
        self._ring.order[nblcks] = ringorder_C

        rComplete(self._ring, 1)
        self._ring.ShortOut = 0
```
From src/kernel/ring.h:

```
// this needs to be called whenever a new ring is created: new fields
// in ring are created (like VarOffset), unless they already exist
// with force == 1, new fields are _always_ created (overwritten),
// even if they exist
BOOLEAN rComplete(ring r, int force = 0); 
```
Changing rComplete() to use 0 instead of 1 does not fix the problem.

Just to confirm it is not an upstream bug:

```c
while (1) { def p = prime(random(2,2^30)); ring r = p,(x,y),dp; };
```

does not seem to leak memory as we do.

I guess one of the problems here is that polynomial rings are cached.

See #5970

There is however memleaks involved.
