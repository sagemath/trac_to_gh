I'm attaching a patch to increase sage_input support.  Newly supported are floats, elements of RDF and CC, vectors, and matrices (sparse and dense).  I also added some new features to sage_input for handling these new types, and fixed a bug in matrix_modn_sparse that was exposed in the process (sorry, the bug fix really should have been a separate patch).

This patch depends on #2898 (and hence indirectly on #3938).

Attachment: **[sage-input-sequel.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket5101/sage-input-sequel.patch.gz)**

I've looked over the patch and it looks reasonable.  Doctests pass on 3.3alpha3 for all (nontrivially) touched files.  Positive review.

This does depend on someone reviewing 2898, though.
