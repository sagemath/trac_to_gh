I'm attaching a patch to increase sage_input support.  Newly supported are floats, elements of RDF and CC, vectors, and matrices (sparse and dense).

I've looked over the patch and it looks reasonable.  Doctests pass on 3.3alpha3 for all (nontrivially) touched files.  Positive review.

This does depend on someone reviewing 2898, though.
