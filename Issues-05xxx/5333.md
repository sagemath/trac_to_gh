Left over pynac libraries in $SAGE_LOCAL/lib cause upgrade trouble from some releases. William reported some as well as John Cremona in

The fix is trivial, but very important to get into 3.4.

<a id='comment:2'></a>The pynac package already deletes the existing libraries before installing new ones. The errors mentioned on the linked threads were seen because the sage library was not updated properly.

Here are the relevant lines from spkg-install in pynac-0.1.2.spkg, which is included in Sage-3.3:

```
install_pynac()
{
    rm ${SAGE_LOCAL}/lib/*ginac*
    rm ${SAGE_LOCAL}/lib/*pynac*
    rm -rf ${SAGE_LOCAL}/include/ginac
    rm -rf ${SAGE_LOCAL}/include/pynac
    cd ${PYNACDIR}
    $MAKE install
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
        echo "Error installing pynac."
        exit 1
    fi
    cd ${WORKDIR} 
}
```

I suggest resolving this as invalid.
