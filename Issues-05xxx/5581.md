This patch adds the important functionality of computing face lattices and f-vectors of polytopes.  In the course of adding these, I found a number of bugs that occur for polyhedra of lower dimensions that are embedded in higher dimensions, which I believe I have fixed.

Keywords: **polyhedra, face lattice**

Component: **geometry**
