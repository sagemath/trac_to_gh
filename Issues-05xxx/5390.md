`package.py` provides various functions for obtaining a list of installed packages or installing new ones. In all these functions, `os.popen('sage')` is called.

But wouldn't this always try to call a system-wide sage installation? Then it would result in an error, if the running sage instance is from a local installation, and it may install packages in a wrong location if there is both a system wide and a local version of sage.

If this is really the case, then it might be better to give the full path to the currently running sage version, hence

```
os.popen('%s/sage'%(SAGE_ROOT))
```

This is what the attached patch does.

Hi Simon,

once Sage has been started `sage-env` sets PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH, so from inside Sage the right `sage` script is called. I do not really see a scenario where this patch would fix anything.

I am marking this as needs work, but I really consider this as invalid.

Thoughts?

Cheers,

Michael

I know that Sage sets PATH, but I thought it would merely add `SAGE_LOCAL/bin` in front, but this folder does not contain `sage` (only `sage.bin`). 

But if I am mistaken then certainly that ticket is invalid. It just struck me when by coincidence I was reading the code.

Yeah, but even *if* the env was messed up your fix does not resolve the problem since `$SAGE_ROOT` does in that case not get overwritten in sage-env, so you would call the wrong Sage even with your patch.
