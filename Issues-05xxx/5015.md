That is weird.  What a horrible bug!   Thanks for reporting this.  It is now trac #
```

It also happens with ns=1.  I've verified this.

Note that the new code doesn't get run as doing

f(x) = 1

overwrites the old x (which was created with var('x',ns=1)) with just var('x').  The infinite recursion is due the CallableSymbolicExpression ring assuming that all elements of SR were instances of SymbolicExpression.
