Following #5098, here is a generic implementation of Pollard lambda algorithm.
There is probably still lots of room for optimization, but it works.

Patch applies fine to 3.3.alpha2 + (from #5098) trac-5098-alpha2based.patch and tests pass.  Code looks good and docstring & doctests are fine.

I think it is excellent to have more of these generic algorithms available.  Pass!

John,

please make sure not to sneak extra spaces in between positive and review since the reports do not pick up such tickets. The reports should be fixed to ignore extra white space, but until then ....

Hi Yann,

how large are the changes? If it is "just" a rebase with no or minimal functional changes (i.e. some exception changed) the positive review can stand.

SECOND REVIEW:

* Line 1 of docstring: "Pollard Lambda algorithm for computing discrete logarithm."
It should be "Pollard Lambda algorithm for computing discrete logarithms." or "Pollard Lambda algorithm for computing the discrete logarithm."

* The docstring has a typo in line 2: "usefull" 

* The sections in the docstring should have space between them (e.g., a blank line before EXAMPLES:).  This can be ignored because of the ReST/Sphinx transition, which will probably change that. 

* I noticed this line

```
N = width.isqrt()+1 
```
If width is a Python int then that will fail.  This is easy to trigger and will accidentally happen in library code easily:

```
sage: F.<a> = GF(2^63) 
sage: g = F.gen()
sage: pollard_lambda(g, g^1234567, (1200000,1250000)) 
1234567
sage: pollard_lambda(g, g^1234567, (int(1200000), int(1250000))) 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

* the doctests are insufficient.  The function signature is

```
def pollard_lambda(base, a, bounds, ord=None, operation='*', hash_function=hash, memory=None): 
```
At a bare minimum, there must be doctests that test use of all the inputs to the function.

Good point, it is similar.
