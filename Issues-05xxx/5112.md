Following #5098, here is a generic implementation of Pollard lambda algorithm.
There is probably still lots of room for optimization, but it works.

Hi Yann,

how large are the changes? If it is "just" a rebase with no or minimal functional changes (i.e. some exception changed) the positive review can stand.

SECOND REVIEW:

* Line 1 of docstring: "Pollard Lambda algorithm for computing discrete logarithm."
It should be "Pollard Lambda algorithm for computing discrete logarithms." or "Pollard Lambda algorithm for computing the discrete logarithm."

* The docstring has a typo in line 2: "usefull" 

* The sections in the docstring should have space between them (e.g., a blank line before EXAMPLES:).  This can be ignored because of the ReST/Sphinx transition, which will probably change that. 

* I noticed this line

```
N = width.isqrt()+1 
```
If width is a Python int then that will fail.  This is easy to trigger and will accidentally happen in library code easily:

```
sage: F.<a> = GF(2^63) 
sage: g = F.gen()
sage: pollard_lambda(g, g^1234567, (1200000,1250000)) 
1234567

* the doctests are insufficient.  The function signature is

```

```
At a bare minimum, there must be doctests that test use of all the inputs to the function.
