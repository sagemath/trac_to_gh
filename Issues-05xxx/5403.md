There are a number of "from ... import *" in the new quadratic forms code. This messes up tab completion (among other issues).

The attached patch fixes the issue by explicitly listing every function defined in the quadratic forms files.

Component: **quadratic forms**

This would be nice to fix since on every first startup after moving Sage or cloning python will complain about those imports.

I am also marking the patch as needs work until it is ready for review. That way the patch will not be lost :)
