The dimension() method for schemes is confusing and sometimes inconsistent or plain broken when working over bases that are not fields.  The attached patch implements methods dimension_absolute() and dimension_relative() and makes dimension() into an alias for dimension_absolute().


Keywords: **dimension scheme**

Component: **algebraic geometry**

REFEREE REPORT.

Looks great.  I rebased this patch against 3.4.1.alpha0 and added a doctest for the following new function.  I also doctested this patch against the schemes directory.

```
 	137	    def is_noetherian(self): 
 	138	        """ 
 	139	        Return True if this scheme is Noetherian. 
 	140	        """ 
 	141	        return self.__R.is_noetherian() 
```
