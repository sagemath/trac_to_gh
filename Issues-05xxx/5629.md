Looks great.  I rebased this patch against 3.4.1.alpha0 and added a doctest for the following new function.  I also doctested this patch against the schemes directory.

```
 	137	    def is_noetherian(self): 
 	138	        """ 
 	139	        Return True if this scheme is Noetherian. 
 	140	        """ 
 	141	        return self.__R.is_noetherian() 
```
