David Loeffler ran into the following segfault earlier:

```
sage: r,s,t,u = Gamma0(2).gens()
sage: r**(-1)*u**(-1) == t
BOOM
```

The attached patch fixes this, and adds a doctest. There's more work to be done: `matrix_integer_2x2` should inherit from `matrix_integer_dense`, but it doesn't yet. I have 98% of the code to do it done, but it needs to get cleaned up and submitted.

**HOWEVER**: I don't have a copy of sage-3.3 on my machine, so the patch is against sage-3.2.3. I can either clean this up myself if someone points me to a build of `3.3.rc?` on sage.math, or someone else could do it ... `:)`

Hi Craig,

Thanks for looking at this so quickly; but as I mentioned in my email to sage-devel, the problem doesn't occur under pre-3.3 versions because the output of Gamma0(2).gens() isn't the same. In 3.3 and 3.4, the matrices returned by Gamma0(2).gens() *should* satisfy r**(-1) * u**(-1) == t. 

In 3.4 with congroup_element's `__cmp__` changed to `_cmp_` as in your patch, it no longer segfaults; but the answer is False, even though the matrices have the same entries, which isn't great either. And one gets the same crash as before by doing

sage: (r**(-1) * u**(-1)).matrix() == t.matrix()

So I'm afraid I'm giving this a "needs work". I will do some further tinkering myself tomorrow.

David

The patch applies to my 3.4.rc1 merge tree without any rebase problems, so all we need is a review to get this in.
