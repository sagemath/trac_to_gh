This enhancement implements (over QQ only) the algorithm in  "Finding
all elliptic curves with good reduction outside a given set of primes"
by John Cremona and Mark Lingham, Experimental Mathematics 16 No.3
(2007), 303-312.

This is a serious application of the S-integral point functions added last year.  I have a partial Magma implementation over number fields (partial since Magma does not have S-integral points over number fields either), which requires number field functionality not yet in Sage (pSelmer groups), which I know how to do but have not done;  I will put those on a separate ticket.

It is based on 3.4.1.rc0 + #5673 (2 patches) + #5685 (1 patch).

**Assignee:** @williamstein

**Keywords:** elliptic curve

OK, I will do that!   We're still working on that chapter (Chris Wuthrich is doing some too). John
