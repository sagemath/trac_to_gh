The following fails because I don't have the optional  gap_packages-* package installed:

```

    return '\n'.join([self._eval_line(L, **kwds) for L in code.split('\n') if L != ''])
  File "/Users/wstein/build/sage-3.4/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/sage/interfaces/gap.py", line 723, in _eval_line
    raise RuntimeError, message
RuntimeError: Gap produced error output
Variable: 'GroupCohomology' must have a value


   executing GroupCohomology(Group([(3,4), (1,2,3)(4,5)]),1,3);
```

The error message should say that I have to install that package.

Incidentally, installing the package doesn't work right now since Sage ships gap-4.12 (though I guess we're downgrading to 4.10 soon):

```
$ sage -i gap_packages-4.4.10_6

Here's a patch.  Skimming through the Sage source code, it seems that in other cases we usually raise a RuntimeError when an optional package is needed but not installed, so that's what I've done here.
