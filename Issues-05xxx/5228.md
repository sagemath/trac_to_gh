The patches describe and doctest this better, but...

* Extends composite_fields and galois_closure to return maps when asked

* Uses the new coercion embedding to only return "coherent" compositions if embeddings are specified.

Keywords: **number fields composite fields galois closure embedding coercion**

Component: **number theory**
