the location is feed into maps.google.com. if you go there, enter the location string 1:1 and hit search and the first hit is wrong, it will be also wrong on the devmap! from my experience, changing a word or some details is enough to get it right.

behind the scenes, offline: all location strings are extrcted and a script creates a mapping from each uniqe string to the lat/long coordinates that are then used online by the map-javascript when loading the page and placing the markers.
