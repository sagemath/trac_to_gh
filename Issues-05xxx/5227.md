Well, 

the flag being in the middle of a country usually indicates that the address in the XML file is not resolvable by Google.

the location is feed into maps.google.com. if you go there, enter the location string 1:1 and hit search and the first hit is wrong, it will be also wrong on the devmap! from my experience, changing a word or some details is enough to get it right.

behind the scenes, offline: all location strings are extrcted and a script creates a mapping from each uniqe string to the lat/long coordinates that are then used online by the map-javascript when loading the page and placing the markers.

Hi Minh,

could you please change line 148 (my own personal entry) to:

```
<contributor name="Georg S. Weber" location="N√É≈írnberg, Germany" description="reviews, bug fixing, documentation"/>
```
since I would like to ask first at my institute before it is published here (more a formality than anything else, but nevertheless); I updated also the description.

Thanks for your work!!

Cheers, gsw
