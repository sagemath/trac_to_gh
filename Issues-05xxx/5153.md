[See #15608 for a list of open simon_two_descent tickets]

We have

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve('65a1')
sage: G = E.change_ring(QuadraticField(-56,'a'))
sage: G.simon_two_descent()
(3, 4, [(-9/4 : -3/8*a + 9/8 : 1), (-8/7 : -1/49*a + 4/7 : 1), (1 : 0 : 1), 
  (-6/25*a - 47/25 : 36/125*a - 368/125 : 1), (1/4 : 1/16*a - 1/8 : 1)])
```

The documentation for simon_two_descent says that the output of Simon 2-descent is

```
        OUTPUT:
            integer -- "probably" the rank of self
            integer -- the 2-rank of the Selmer group
            list    -- list of independent points on the curve.
```

Our curve does have rank 3, but the output list above contains *five* points, so they can't be independent!   

Our curve has torsion of order 2, so E(K)/2 E(K) has rank four, so the 3 and four output by Simon descent are right.  The only problem is the list, which has too many points in it. 

Maybe this is simply a documentation issue, and the docs for simon_two_descent should be changed to say that list is a list of points that *generate* a subgroup of the MW group of rank r, where r is the first number output by simon_two_descent.

Looking at the example in more detail, I see that the points returned do generate a rank 3 group (though I had to use Magma to check the independence), so there are two problems: (1) the points in the list are not independent (even in E(K)/2E(K)) and (2) the numbers 3,4 which are supposed to be lower and upper bounds on the rank are wrong and should be 3,3.

I know how the first happens (since it is doing a descent via 2-isogeny).

This will be possible to fix once I (or someone) have eventually implemented heights of points over number fields, as I promised to do  in trac #360 !

Another excellent trick I learned from Cremona for getting independence is to use *homomorphic images*.  I.e., reduce to a direct sum of groups of points over a finite field (all tensored with F_p, with p coprime to torsion).  Then the rank of the group you have is a bounded below by the dimension of the image.

The numbers 3,4, are correct. G has a point of order 2 over its base feild, so the 2-rank of the 2-Selmer group is 4. However, an error like the one you're describing does occur with 438e1 over Q.

Do you mean 438e1 over Q?    #torsion=2 and rank=0 but the first descent via 2-isogeny gives a rank upper bound of 2.  If the rank were 2 then the 2-selmer rank would be 3.  two_descent_simon() gives lower bound of 0 and 3 for the rank of the 2-Selmer group.  That last one is clearly wrong.

We should correct the docstring of two_descent_simon, and I will tell Simon that his documentation is incorrect.

The actual issue reported to fix here, seemed first to me just a question of rewording the documentation. But then I realised that there is a bug, quite hidden, but unpleasant, linked to ticket #11372.

So we want simon_two_descent (over the rationals of number fields) to return three things

* A proven lower bound for the rank
* The rank of the 2-Selmer group (this is an upper bound but not sharp in general)
* A list of points.

I propose that the list of points is a list of points of infinite order. So I filter out the ones that are of order 2 in the list that the script returns. However they are not lin. indep. This was already done over number fields in #13593. So here I modify the function over rationals.

Over Q, this function then also saturates these points and, if there are sufficiently many, sets them for `E.gens()`.

That is what my proposed changes in the forthcoming commit will do. 

Now, there are related issues, but they don't belong to this ticket really. The curve 438e1 gives the wrong 2-Selmer and that is #10735. The fact that we don't saturate over number field should not belong to this ticket. One should open a new one for this. Also the script is outdated (see #11005) and has plenty of other issues (#11041).

The bug introduced by #11372: In the example in the documentation, the only point found is of order 2, while the second descent concludes that the rank is 1. The result shown in the documentation were in fact from mwrank not from simon_two_descent.

I am worried by the documentation sentence

```
To obtain a list of generators, use E.gens() after this.
```
since the only situation in which `E.gens()` with return points found by this function are when the lower and upper rank bounds agree *and* the list of points returned has that number of points in it.  Otherwise, gens are not cached and a call to E.gens() will use `mwrank`.  So it is a bit misleading?
