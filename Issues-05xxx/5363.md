For 3.4.alpha0 -sdist does not include any of the new doc repo code, i.e. if one runs "hg update -C" in devel/sage after building you will see

```
 186 files updated, 0 files merged, 0 files removed, 0 files unresolved
```
I corrected this in the official 3.4.alpha0.tar, but this needs fixing before the final 3.4 release, so this is a blocker.

Cheers,

Michael

I think we want to also include the html files under doc (for things like templates, etc.) and then just prune the doc/output directory.

I don't think we want those files in the -sdist tarball, but I would like to see the html documentation installed centrally, i.e. #5410, so that -bdist picks it up.

There is a non autogenerated HTML file which is part of the repo and should be included in doc/common/templates.  There will be more things like these (such as CSS files etc.) in the future as well.
