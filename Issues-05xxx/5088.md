My patch include the Pohlig-Hellman algorithm, and also modified the arguments of discrete_log, the "ord" argument wasn't used as announced but as a bound.

I also wonder why we keep an old_discrete_log, but this another story...

OK, I saw that after saying I would do it.  I did have two doctest failures but they seem to be unrelated since they also fail in my unpatched main branch, and are probably due to the messed up upgrade.
