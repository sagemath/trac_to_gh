My patch include the Pohlig-Hellman algorithm, and also modified the arguments of discrete_log, the "ord" argument wasn't used as announced but as a bound.

I also wonder why we keep an old_discrete_log, but this another story...

I am very pleased that someone is as interested as I am in improving this!  The original discrete log was wriiten by Stin & Joiner i think;  I rewrote it to work more generaically using the generic bsgs code;  I left the old code in through squaemishness about deleting what other people have written, that's all.

Can I clarify what the changes you have made are doing?   You are still using BSGS to find dlogs in a cyclic group, but instead of doing one big computation in the whole group, you factor the order and do it in each p-primary subgroup separately.  If so, that sounds very sensible, but I think it would be a good idea to cache the group order's factorization so that the factorization is not repeated on subsequent calls.  The only way I can see of doing that is to have  the base element (which might be additive or multiplicative) cache both its own order and the factorization of that order.

The next improvement we need is to replace the BSGS by something which takes less memory, but that's not a reason for delaying this patch.

I have not reviewed this yet, only looked at the patch code, but will do.

OK, I saw that after saying I would do it.  I did have two doctest failures but they seem to be unrelated since they also fail in my unpatched main branch, and are probably due to the messed up upgrade.
