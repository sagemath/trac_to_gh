This one needs a rebase post 3.4.2:

```
sage-3.4.2.rc0/devel/sage$ hg import trac_5920_view_as_pdf-5920-nt.patch 
applying trac_5920_view_as_pdf-5920-nt.patch
patching file sage/misc/latex.py
Hunk #1 succeeded at 894 with fuzz 2 (offset 369 lines).
Hunk #4 FAILED at 575
1 out of 6 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file sage/misc/latex.py.rej
abort: patch failed to apply
```
Once the rebase has been done the positive review can be reinstated [assuming doctests pass obviously ;)].

Cheers,

Michael
