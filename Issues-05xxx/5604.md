<a id='comment:2'></a>This is done now:

```
sage: sage.plot.colors.red+sage.plot.colors.blue
RGB color (0.5, 0.0, 0.5)

```

So this ticket should be closed.

For more than two operands, I thought that "+" would average over the number of operands. Instead, "+" averages the first two, then average the result with the last operand.

Mixing colors and color theory in general is a very involved topic; we are just scratching the surface here with suboptimal, but still useful, methods and shortcuts.

No reason I can think of. My surprise as expressed above has more to do with my lack of understanding.
