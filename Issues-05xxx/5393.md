PyCrypto ARC2 Module Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

PyCrypto (Python Cryptography Toolkit) is prone to a 
buffer-overflow vulnerability because it fails to 
adequately verify user-supplied input.

Successful exploits may allow attackers to execute 
arbitrary code in the context of applications using 
the vulnerable module. Failed attempts may lead to a 
denial-of-service condition.
