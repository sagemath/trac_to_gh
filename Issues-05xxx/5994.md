<a id='comment:1'></a>Remark:

Apparently the problem is on the side of Singular.

In Singular, freshly started, when you do

```
> system("--version");
```
there is the error (it says "? cannot open `help.cnf`"). 
If you repeat, no error.

If people think that my suggestion would break code, I suggest to have a new method `singular.version_number()`.

And meanwhile it is reported upstream. 

I do not know, however, if the problem still occurs with Singular 3-1-0 (I only have a beta version, and this still shows the error).

"Upstream" answered, and it seems that the problem is fixed in the official release. 

I could verify that on the server in Oberwolfach, the error does not occur in Singular 3-1-0, but it *does* occur in Oberwolfach in Singular 3-0-4 (as being part of Sage). Opinions?

But there still remains the question if `singular.version()` ought to return a tuple of integers, rather than a lengthy string with all build informations.

My personal preference would be for it to return a tuple of integers, but we could give it an optional argument `with_build_info=True` (or `verbatim=True` or something similar) to make it return the lengthy string.

The "Opinions?" bit should be two lines lower. Sorry.

It turned out that the error occurs in *any* ***Sage-built*** Singular version that I know: Singular 3-0-4 on sage.math, on two of my computers, in Oberwolfach, and Singular 3-1-0-Beta on sage.math and on one of my computers. 

If Singular is not built by Sage, then the error apparently does not occur: With Singular 3-0-3 (very old) on one of my machines, Singular-3-1-0-Beta on my machine (same sources, modulo the usual patches, as the sage-built version!), and Singular-3-1-0 official release in Oberwolfach.

So, after all, it seems to me that it is all Sage's fault.

Here is where I want to know some "Opinions"...

Note that I originally thought that the issue with help files is a problem of Singular, and clearly a bug: I mean, you ask for the version number and get an error; you ask again, and it works! It had reported it upstream.

But then the impression came across (see my last post) that it only occurs in Singular if it is built by Sage. In this case, it could be a problem with the patched version in Sage, which might be worth another ticket.

I'd like to, but the sage-4.3.1.alpha1 that I had built on sage-math seems broken. It used to work, but when I did `./sage -br main`, it failed with 

```
ImportError: /usr/lib/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.11' not found (required by /home/SimonKing/SAGE/sage-4.3.1.alpha1/local/lib/libgmpxx.so.3)
```

Might `./sage -ba` work?

Anyway, I'd like to see one more doc test, that checks consistency with another way of getting the version number -- just for consistency:

```
sage: tuple([Integer(c) for c in singular.eval('system("version")')][:3] == singular.version()[0]
True
```

<a id='comment:13'></a>OK, meanwhile I built sage-4.3.1.rc1

The patch applies cleanly.

However, I don't like the doc tests, and I think the return value is wrong.

The tests check that the first version number is 3. OK, it will eventually change, but not in the near future. 

Then they test that the version number is of length 3. Can we rely on it? There used to be two-digit versions. 

In fact, the "official" version number seems to be four digits, not three:

```
sage: singular.eval('system("version")')
'3104'
```

Hence, the first return value of singular.version() should be (3,1,0,4) not (3,1,0). 
Note that according to the Singular homepage there is a version 3-1-0-6 available, so, the last digit does play a role.

So, my questions are:

* How important is it to have doc tests that remain valid if the Singular version changes?
* Do we take the patch level version number of Singular serious?

First question: Do we want that `singular.version()` works? Currently, it fails when first called.

Second question: Do we want that (at least by default) it returns a tuple of three or four numbers (three- resp four-digit vesion numbers), or do people like that the output of `singular.version()` (if it is called again after the initial error) returns a lengthy string with full information on the way Singular has been built?

As a default I would suggest output similar to `pari.version()`. But for now at least `kash_version()` and `r_version()` gives slightly different output...

Maybe right way could be to remove them, and have something like `version('kash')` for one package and `version()` for all packages?

<a id='comment:24'></a>To repeat my questions:

- How important is it to have doc tests that remain valid if the Singular version changes?

My answer: We could at least have a test marked random. In that way, we at least make sure that there is no error raised.

- Do we take the patch level version number of Singular serious? Respectively do we really want the current behaviour (singular.version() returns a lengthy string), or would we prefer to have it return a tuple of integers?

My answer: We have

```
sage: pari.version()
[2, 8, 0]
sage: r.version()
((3, 2, 1), 'R version 3.2.1 (2015-06-18)')
sage: gap.version()
'4.7.8'
sage: sage0.version()
'SageMath Version 6.9.beta3, Release Date: 2015-08-21'
```
Hence, the different interfaces have all kind of different output. Thus, the current behaviour should be fine, but the following output

```
sage: singular.eval('system("version")')
'3170'
```
would be equally fine.

My suggestion is: Use the SHORT version string by default, but provide singular_version and singular.version with an optional "verbose=False" argument, that allows to obtain the lengthy version string. And of course fix the error.

Slight problem: The patching level usually is not indicated by a number but by "p" plus a number. So, providing the version as a list of integers is perhaps not what we want. And it is not good, I think, if the default output is a list of integers and the verbose output is a totally different type, namely a string.

From that perspective, the r-output is better.

True.

As a system admin I should be able to answer fast to questions "What is the version of ... in our server ...?". For that it is not so important what is the format. But it gives a little unprofessional feeling if I get `(1,2,3)` from `foo.version()` and `[1,2,3]` from `bar.version()`.

From reading [this change log](http://www.singular.uni-kl.de:8002/trac/changeset/46e5030de2b6094068cceec4cd764bad1a65a02c/git), I believe that .../share singular/LIB/ is the correct place.

I'll file a ticket in the singular trac server. But for now, we need a work-around in Sage.

Why not modify spkg-install, so that it installs the missing file? Alternatively, we could patch Singular's Makefile (or whatever it is called) so that it installs the missing file. What is the preferred way?

Also, I'd like to know why Singular's Makefile does not install help.cnf. After all, if I understand correctly, it DOES install all the library files of Singular (which are in the same folder as help.cnf).

Hang on. I just notice that the singular spkg apparently screws completely. Or how would you explain that I find the complete UNPACKED singular source tree in SAGE_LOCAL/upstream/ ? Do we need a new Singular package?
