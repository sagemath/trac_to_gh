Remark:

Apparently the problem is on the side of Singular.

In Singular, freshly started, when you do

```
> system("--version");
```
there is the error (it says "? cannot open `help.cnf`"). 
If you repeat, no error.

If people think that my suggestion would break code, I suggest to have a new method `singular.version_number()`.

And meanwhile it is reported upstream. 

I do not know, however, if the problem still occurs with Singular 3-1-0 (I only have a beta version, and this still shows the error).

"Upstream" answered, and it seems that the problem is fixed in the official release. 

I could verify that on the server in Oberwolfach, the error does not occur in Singular 3-1-0, but it *does* occur in Oberwolfach in Singular 3-0-4 (as being part of Sage). Opinions?

But there still remains the question if `singular.version()` ought to return a tuple of integers, rather than a lengthy string with all build informations.

My personal preference would be for it to return a tuple of integers, but we could give it an optional argument `with_build_info=True` (or `verbatim=True` or something similar) to make it return the lengthy string.

The "Opinions?" bit should be two lines lower. Sorry.

It turned out that the error occurs in *any* ***Sage-built*** Singular version that I know: Singular 3-0-4 on sage.math, on two of my computers, in Oberwolfach, and Singular 3-1-0-Beta on sage.math and on one of my computers. 

If Singular is not built by Sage, then the error apparently does not occur: With Singular 3-0-3 (very old) on one of my machines, Singular-3-1-0-Beta on my machine (same sources, modulo the usual patches, as the sage-built version!), and Singular-3-1-0 official release in Oberwolfach.

So, after all, it seems to me that it is all Sage's fault.


> But there still remains the question if `singular.version()` ought to return a tuple of integers, rather than a lengthy string with all build informations.

Here is where I want to know some "Opinions"...

I'd like to, but the sage-4.3.1.alpha1 that I had built on sage-math seems broken. It used to work, but when I did `./sage -br main`, it failed with 

```
ImportError: /usr/lib/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.11' not found (required by /home/SimonKing/SAGE/sage-4.3.1.alpha1/local/lib/libgmpxx.so.3)
```

Might `./sage -ba` work?

Anyway, I'd like to see one more doc test, that checks consistency with another way of getting the version number -- just for consistency:

```
sage: tuple([Integer(c) for c in singular.eval('system("version")')][:3] == singular.version()[0]
True
```

OK, meanwhile I built sage-4.3.1.rc1

The patch applies cleanly.

However, I don't like the doc tests, and I think the return value is wrong.

The tests check that the first version number is 3. OK, it will eventually change, but not in the near future. 

Then they test that the version number is of length 3. Can we rely on it? There used to be two-digit versions. 

In fact, the "official" version number seems to be four digits, not three:

```
sage: singular.eval('system("version")')
'3104'
```

Hence, the first return value of singular.version() should be (3,1,0,4) not (3,1,0). 
Note that according to the Singular homepage there is a version 3-1-0-6 available, so, the last digit does play a role.

So, my questions are:

* How important is it to have doc tests that remain valid if the Singular version changes?
* Do we take the patch level version number of Singular serious?

First question: Do we want that `singular.version()` works? Currently, it fails when first called.

Second question: Do we want that (at least by default) it returns a tuple of three or four numbers (three- resp four-digit vesion numbers), or do people like that the output of `singular.version()` (if it is called again after the initial error) returns a lengthy string with full information on the way Singular has been built?

To repeat my questions:

- How important is it to have doc tests that remain valid if the Singular version changes?

My answer: We could at least have a test marked random. In that way, we at least make sure that there is no error raised.

- Do we take the patch level version number of Singular serious? Respectively do we really want the current behaviour (singular.version() returns a lengthy string), or would we prefer to have it return a tuple of integers?

My answer: We have

```
sage: pari.version()
[2, 8, 0]
sage: r.version()
((3, 2, 1), 'R version 3.2.1 (2015-06-18)')
sage: gap.version()
'4.7.8'
sage: sage0.version()
'SageMath Version 6.9.beta3, Release Date: 2015-08-21'
```
Hence, the different interfaces have all kind of different output. Thus, the current behaviour should be fine, but the following output

```
sage: singular.eval('system("version")')
'3170'
```
would be equally fine.

My suggestion is: Use the SHORT version string by default, but provide singular_version and singular.version with an optional "verbose=False" argument, that allows to obtain the lengthy version string. And of course fix the error.

Slight problem: The patching level usually is not indicated by a number but by "p" plus a number. So, providing the version as a list of integers is perhaps not what we want. And it is not good, I think, if the default output is a list of integers and the verbose output is a totally different type, namely a string.

From that perspective, the r-output is better.

I didn't know about the existence of a `package_version.txt`. I wonder if we could access these data---after all, the package version of singular is "3.1.7p1.p0", but the version shown by `singular.eval('system("version")')` is "3170". Similarly for r, it should be `3.2.1.p0`, not `(3,2,1)`.

> Slight problem: The patching level usually is not indicated by a number but by "p" plus a number. So, providing the version as a list of integers is perhaps not what we want. And it is not good, I think, if the default output is a list of integers and the verbose output is a totally different type, namely a string.

True.

As a system admin I should be able to answer fast to questions "What is the version of ... in our server ...?". For that it is not so important what is the format. But it gives a little unprofessional feeling if I get `(1,2,3)` from `foo.version()` and `[1,2,3]` from `bar.version()`.

There is actually a `help.cnf` installed in

```

so I guess it's a bug in Singular that the file is either installed or looked for in the wrong place.

In any case, copying that file to `$SAGE_LOCAL/share/singular/help.cnf` would be a good solution for this ticket.

From reading [this change log](http://www.singular.uni-kl.de:8002/trac/changeset/46e5030de2b6094068cceec4cd764bad1a65a02c/git), I believe that .../share singular/LIB/ is the correct place.

You're right, this must have come from some earlier Singular version (note the date):

I don't really care much.

Probably you once extracted the tarball in `upstream`? It's not the package which does that...

Error has gone away with Singular 4.

I added doctest.

What goes to output format, I think this should be changed in all `*_version()` commands at once. (Assuming somebody would care, which is propably not true.)
