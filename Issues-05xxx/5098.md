First attempt to provide an algorithm using less memory than the "baby step giant step" algorithm for generic discrete logarithm.

This algorithm uses only (small) constant memory.

Proposed patch attached, with doctests.

**CC:**  @JohnCremona

**Reviewer:** Martin Raum

**Merged:** sage-4.3.rc1

Do you know what makes this slower?

I'm not so familiar with this version of Pollard, but this looks well-written.  I'll test it once my build of 3.3.alpha2 has finished.

I just wrote a review for this but trac refused to save it since another comment has been made in between.  How can it do this!!!!  Luckily I was able to use the "back" button to revover what I had written.

Review:

* Patch applied fine to 3.3.alpha2.  Doctests in groups/generic pass.

* In the docstring for pollard_rho() I would move the explanation for the partition_size parameter to a NOTE later, not in the description of the paramater;  and that description should say that the default is 16.

* There should be doctests in discrete_log() showing the use of the algorithm parameter.

I also think that it would be helpful to add to this ticket (and perhaps also in doctests) examples showing how the new algorithm is sometimes preferable!

None of these is at all serious, and think this additoin is basically very good.

a patch is on the way. I also removed to debug printings I forgot and added my authorship. 

Concerning comparison, the benefit of Pollard rho algorithm comes only with quite big examples and I don't think it's a good idea for doctests. Here's one example.

I am having trouble applying the new patch.  I have a 3.3.alpha2 build, so #5088 is already merged.  I apply trac-5098.patch ok.  Then I apply trac-5098-review.patch but get several hunks failing.

This might just be me being stupid, so it would be good if someone else tried.

While I am here though, you did not quite understand my third point in the original review:  I did not mean that a new doctest should illustrate the greater efficiency (or not) of the new algorithm, but it should at least illustrate how to use the new parameter.  e.g. take one of the existing examples and compute it bothe ways and check that they are equal:

```
        sage: F.<a>=GF(2^63)
        sage: g=F.gen()
        sage: u=g**123456789
        sage: discrete_log(u,g,algorithm='bsgs') == discrete_log(u,g,algorithm='rho')
        True
```

The latest patch causes the following doctest failure: From

```
File "/scratch/mabshoff/sage-3.3.alpha4/devel/sage/sage/rings/integer_mod.pyx", line 444:
   sage: sage.groups.generic.discrete_log(a,b)
Expected:
   Traceback (most recent call last):
   ...
   ZeroDivisionError: Inverse does not exist.
```
we get to

```
ArithmeticError: multiplicative order of 4 not defined since it is not a unit modulo 100
```

William doesn't like either one, but he is about to comment himself.

Cheers,

 William:  Hmm.
Better would be a statement that the discrete log doesn't exist.
Or that it might but the algorithm implemented can't tell.
I don't like either error.
 me:  Well, I will comment on the ticket and then you can comment there on the record.
 William:  The log does exist.
so it would be much better to get a NotImplementedError when things go wrong.

Hi guys,

this ticket and #5112 is being held up by the above doctesting issues. The patches should go into 3.3 and rc0 will drop in roughly 48 hours, so there is time to sort this out. We could do two things:

* change the doctest to "fix" the problem for now and open a followup ticket to deal with the problem William pointed out. Since the situation doesn't seem to get worst that seems acceptable
* fix the problem William pointed out :)

Thoughts?

Cheers,

Michael

Right now only trac admins can delete patches. I will delete all but the two last patches shortly.

Some times it is interesting for credit and historic purposes to keep old patches around, but in this case it should be no problem to delete them.

I have some issues with trac-5098-doctest.patch:

1. There should be a doctest that illustrates every single exception that can be raised.  For example this patch adds

```
raise NotImplementedError, "The current implementation of Pollard Rho algorithm needs to have (a multiple of) the order of the base" 
```
on line 543, but there is no doctest that illustrates this.

2. Line 758, The %s"%base business is bad.  

```
raise NotImplementedError, "we currently need to know the order of the base %s"%(base) }}}
I used to write a lot of exceptions like this, since for Magma we did that.  But in Magma, they aren't exceptions that can be caught -- any single exception stops the program.

Here's some irc chatter about the "%s"%base exception business. There are perhaps thousands (?) of instances of this in Sage now.

```
23:46 < wstein> They can be "silent killers" :-)
23:46 < mabs> wstein: can an opinion on the broken combinat pickles?
23:47 < mabs> can -> got
23:48 < wstein> wstein@sage:/space/wstein/sage-3.3.rc0$ ./sage -grep "raise" "%s" |wc -l
23:48 < wstein> 6750
23:48 < mabs> *OUCH*
23:48 < wstein> It's not always bad.
23:48 < wstein> wstein@sage:/space/wstein/sage-3.3.rc0$ ./sage -grep "raise" "%s" |wc -l
23:48 < wstein> Oops.
23:49 < wstein> sage: search_src("raise","%s") # also shows them.
23:49 < wstein> It's only the ones that have elements that could easily be large in the exception that
23:49 < wstein> are a danger.
23:49 < wstein> But a quick glance suggests there are probably thousands of these still.
23:50 < mabs> Yes, I thought the comment was good since I never knew about that problem.
23:50 < wstein> Especially in the combinat and coding theory code...
23:50 < mabs> :)
23:50 < wstein> One can just do search_src("raise","%s")
23:50 < wstein> look to see which exceptions are funny, and quickly craft examples where
23:50 < wstein> things seem to hang for stupid reasons instead of raising an exception.
23:51 < wstein> Where hang = create a base-10 string rep for something in memory, then try to display a bazillion characters to screen.

A comment by cwitty about my suggestion that every exception should be doctested:

```
00:07 < cwitty> wstein: re your comment on #5098: I've added exceptions to Sage that I have no idea how 
                to doctest.
00:07 < wstein> cwitty -- for that patch I think they would all be easy.
00:07 < wstein> I had that in mind.
00:07 < cwitty> I sort of suspect that hitting them may require working in a number field of degree 
                several billion, but I'm not positive.
00:07 < wstein> cwitty -- at least you can give a reason for not doctesting the ones you don't test.
00:08 < wstein> I don't mean for that to be some absolute rule.
00:08 < wstein> Just a general guideline.
00:08 < wstein> But you have a good point.
00:08 < wstein> I'll paste this to the ticket.
00:09 < wstein> The last thing I wrote in sage was something involving gap.py and the "This should 
                never happen" exception.
00:09 < wstein> That can't be doctested :-)
00:09 < wstein> So you're right.
```

This looks ok to me.  It applies fine to 4.1.alpha3 and tests pass.  It might be better to call the function discrete_log_rho instead of pollard_rho_log as that would make it easier to find via tab completion on discrete_*.

There should also be examples (doctests) to illustrate the use of the parameters partition_size, memory_size, hash_function, check_prime.  For example, one where using a non-default value gives better (i.e. faster) results.  If it is not practical to put those into doctests (for example, if the improvement is only noticeable with very large examples), tehre should still be small examples to illustrate these parameters, with a comment about them being too small to notice, just to show how they are used.

And the technical parameters partition_size, memory_size should be listed in the INPUT block rather than in a separate note.

I have left this as "needs work" but those things are very small and a positive review is not far away!
