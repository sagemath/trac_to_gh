The patch speeds up computations of charpoly and minpoly (a lot -- sage's linear algebra is much better than pari's for some of my examples).

It also makes charpoly, minpoly, absolute_charpoly, and absolute_minpoly work for relative order elements.

With this patch applied to my current 3.3.rc0 merge tree all doctests pass.

Nick: It would be nice to have performance numbers before and after to motivate someone to review this ticket :)

Actually, on my laptop, with the example

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: f = x^32 - x^31 + 2*x^30 - x^28 - 2*x^27 + 8*x^26 + 2*x^25 + 2*x^24 + x^22 - 2*x^20 + x^18 + x^17 - 3*x^16 + 51*x^15 - 2*x^14 - 5*x^13 + 3*x^12 - x^9 + x^8 - x^7 - 2*x^6 - 2*x^5 - x^4 + 5
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(f)
sage: b = -1/2*a^31 - 12*a^30 + a^29 - 1/64*a^28 + 2/3*a^26 + 1/7*a^25 - 2*a^24 + 1/3*a^19 - 6*a^18 - 11*a^17 - 2*a^15 + 1/32*a^14 + a^13 + a^11 - 1/17*a^9 + 2*a^8 + 1/32*a^6 + a^5 + 1/6*a^4 + 2*a^3 - 2/3*a^2 - 59*a + 1
```

I get, before the patch:

```
sage: time c = b.charpoly()
CPU times: user 0.15 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.15 s
Wall time: 0.14 s
```

and after the patch:

```
sage: time c = b.charpoly()
CPU times: user 0.03 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.03 s
Wall time: 0.04 s
```

Just for the heck of it, I tried a degree 61 extension, and I get 7.44 seconds before the patch, and 0.26 seconds after it.

So I'm motivated to review it :)

Nick, if you're reading this, do you have an example where the new code is significantly slower?

Some experiments indicate that pari is faster (sometimes significantly) than sage for degrees up to about 20, after which sage becomes significantly faster than pari.  I am attaching a .sage file that has a tuning function in it.  Use it as follows:

I hope the output is fairly self-explanatory (the times are in seconds).  The above run, on which it appears that degree=21 is a good point to switch algorithms, was on my laptop:

```
[ghitza@artin 5213]$ uname -a
Linux artin 2.6.28-ARCH #1 SMP PREEMPT Sun Feb 8 10:13:45 UTC 2009 i686 Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Duo CPU T9300 @ 2.50GHz GenuineIntel GNU/Linux
```

Michael said he'd run the tuning on a lot of architectures, so we can pick a switch point for the algorithms.
