This works now:

```
plot(sin(x^2),(x,-3,3)).show(figsize=[8,2])
```

This would be nice:

```
plot(sin(x^2),(x,-3,3),figsize=[2,8])
```

The analogue of the above works systematically everywhere for 3d plotting.

This is really awesome.  However, things like this should work too:

```
sage: line([(0,1), (3,4)],figsize=[10,2])
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
RuntimeError: Error in line(): option 'figsize' not valid.
```

Also, this should have gridlines:

```
plot(sin(x^2),(x,-3,3),gridlines=True) + plot(cos(x^2),(x,-3,3))
```

Clarify the comment

```
# If you add parameters to show(), you should update the code below. 
```

I added a new rebase, so if someone could review this then we can finally get this functionality into Sage.

I feel like I did a little bit of a dirty thing with the new linkmode parameter, which was added somewhere along the line. linkmode is intended to be consumed by show() before the keywords are passed onto save(), so I just popped it from the keyword dict at the beginning of the function.

Attachment [trac5651-rebase.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket5651/trac5651-rebase.patch) by @jasongrout created at 2009-07-18 23:17:49

The rebased patch applies fine to my 4.1 tree.  I tried a few examples and ran the doctests in plot/*.py[x] and plot/plot3d/*.py[x] and everything seems fine.  I'm giving a positive review to the rebasing. That combined with William's almost positive review above adds up to a positive review.

I also looked at the code and it looked reasonable.

Thanks and good work!
