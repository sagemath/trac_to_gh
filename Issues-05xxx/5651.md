}
```
This works now:

```
plot(sin(x^2),(x,-3,3)).show(figsize=[8,2])
```

This would be nice:

```
plot(sin(x^2),(x,-3,3),figsize=[2,8])
```

The analogue of the above works systematically everywhere for 3d plotting.

This is really awesome.  However, things like this should work too:

```
sage: line([(0,1), (3,4)],figsize=[10,2])
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
RuntimeError: Error in line(): option 'figsize' not valid.
```

Also, this should have gridlines:

```
plot(sin(x^2),(x,-3,3),gridlines=True) + plot(cos(x^2),(x,-3,3))
```

Clarify the comment

```
# If you add parameters to show(), you should update the code below. 
```

Positive review modulo making so consistent with 3d plotting:

```
sphere((0,0,0),1, aspect_ratio=[1,4,7]) + sphere((1,1,1),1, aspect_ratio=[1,1,1])
```

Note that it is the *rightmost* thing that has precedence.   Otherwise positive review.

Hi Bill,

I tried applying this to 4.0 and got a bunch of failures.  I can probably rebase it later this evening.

I added a new rebase, so if someone could review this then we can finally get this functionality into Sage.

I feel like I did a little bit of a dirty thing with the new linkmode parameter, which was added somewhere along the line. linkmode is intended to be consumed by show() before the keywords are passed onto save(), so I just popped it from the keyword dict at the beginning of the function.
