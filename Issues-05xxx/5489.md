Adds an interface to the (currently optional) 4ti2 package.

4ti2 is necessary for full functionality of the sandpiles module.  In the near future it would be nice to have 4ti2 as a standard component of Sage.

I don't have answers for your other questions, but for this one:

(1) "EXAMPLES:" should be changed to "EXAMPLES::"  (double colon), and it should be followed by a blank line.

(2) In the `__init__` method at the beginning of the file, the INPUT block is not formatted correctly: after the first line, the other lines should be indented so that they line up with ```directory``` (as you've done later).

(3) In all of your INPUT blocks, the leading hyphens should not be indented: they should line up with the "I" in "INPUT".

(4) A few methods have blank lines after the initial `r"""`.  I think those should be deleted.

<a id='comment:9'></a>The code looks good, the doc coverage is 100% and the tests pass. I am almost ready to give a positive review.

I have only some basic comments:

* there is a typo here in "does" (in the method directory)

```
# method since apparently importing sage.misc.misc oes not
```

* Why not gather these import statements at the beginning ?

```
 from sage.matrix.constructor import matrix 
 from sage.matrix.matrix import is_Matrix 
 from sage.rings.integer_ring import ZZ 
 import subprocess
```

If there is no technical difficulty (as for sage.misc.misc), it seems better to import them once and for all. At least those about matrices and integers ?

* There seem to be some 'trailing whitespaces' that could be removed. All the lines just after an EXAMPLES:: should rather be empty.

* The minimize method is NotImplemented. This can of course wait for another ticket.
