In the live version of the tutorial, I'm seeing some problems. The static version seems to be fine.

1.  In tour_assignment.rst, in the lines

```
    sage: a = 5   # a is an integer
    sage: type(a)
    <type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>
    sage: a = 5/3  # now a is a rational number
    sage: type(a)
    <type 'sage.rings.rational.Rational'>
    sage: a = 'hello'  # now a is a string
    sage: type(a)
    <type 'str'>
```
the `<` and `>` signs turn into literal "&lt;" and "&gt;"

2. In tour_assignment.rst, in the lines 

```
    sage: n.str(8)   # string representation of n in base 8
    '11'
```
the quotes come out wrong.

3. In introduction.rst, the whitespace in the following lines comes out wrong:

```
    sage: k = 1/(sqrt(3)*I + 3/4 + sqrt(73)*5/9); print k
                                           1
                              ---------------------------
                                           5 sqrt(73)   3
                              sqrt(3)  I + ---------- + -
                                               9        4
```

4. In tour_algebra.rst, the math part of the lines

```
is modeled by the system of 2nd order differential equations

.. math::
    m_1 x_1'' + (k_1+k_2) x_1 - k_2 x_2 = 0
    m_2 x_2''+ k_2 (x_2-x_1) = 0,
```
is completely missing.  Same thing seems to happen for any text marked as ".. math::"

5. In tour_algebra.rst, in the lines

```
REFERENCES: Nagle, Saff, Snider, Fundamentals of Differential
Equations, 6th ed, Addison-Wesley, 2004. (see § 5.5).
```
an extra symbol appears before the section `§` symbol.

6. in tour_polynomial.rst, in the lines

```
.. [Si] G.-M. Greuel, G. Pfister, and H. Schönemann. 
        ``Singular`` 3.0. A Computer Algebra System for Polynomial
        Computations. Center for Computer Algebra, University of
        Kaiserslautern (2005). http://www.singular.uni-kl.de .
```
the o with an umlaut `ö` doesn't come out well.

7. in tour_groups.rst,

```
    sage: G._gap_init_()
    'Sp(4, 7)'
```
the quotes are mistreated.

I haven't done a careful reading; those are just the things I've spotted.
