Attachment: **[5622-fast-callable-cdf.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket5622/5622-fast-callable-cdf.patch.gz)**

Code looks good, doctests pass.  Positive review, unless Michael complains about the portability issues.

Michael, I see two potential portability issues with the code:

1) it uses C99 complex numbers

2) it adds the compiler argument -std=c99

I'm guessing the latter will only work with gcc (unless other compilers specifically copy gcc command-line arguments).  Does Sage currently build with non-gcc compilers?

That is not a problem. FLINT mandates that we use C99 anyway.

We can work around that.

Not at the moment, but there is work under way to support the pathscale compiler for SiCortex.

Thanks. 

BTW, It compiles fine with gcc without the c99 flag, but I figured I'd put it there to be explicit. (I actually only knew about that flag because of flint.)

The work around for the bug in Cython < 0.11 can be removed because we upgraded to Cython 0.11 in this release of Sage, right?

from patch above:

```
# This is to work around a header ordering bug in Cython < 0.11 
# (Pari is included from sage.rings.complex_double.) 
```
