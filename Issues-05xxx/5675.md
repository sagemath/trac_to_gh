This has been around for a while; I haven't filed a ticket for it, since
I just retype the URL.
```

It used to be in the notebook that address="" was an error.  Then when we switched to twisted, it suddenly meant "listen on all interfaces".  Now it's a common option to give.

<a id='comment:2'></a>There is [socket.getfqdn](http://docs.python.org/library/socket.html#socket.getfqdn), but does it help?  On `boxen`:

```python
sage: import socket
sage: socket.getfqdn()
'localhost'
sage: socket.gethostbyname_ex(socket.gethostname())
('localhost', ['boxen', 'boxen'], ['127.0.0.1', '128.208.160.197'])
```
On a local Linux machine, I get

```python
sage: import socket
sage: socket.getfqdn()
'localhost.localdomain'
sage: socket.gethostbyname_ex(socket.gethostname())
('localhost.localdomain', ['localhost', 'foo'], ['127.0.0.1'])
```
all of which happen to be in `/etc/hosts`.

What if we just add an option `published_host=*` (or a variation) and insert it into URLs for published (and remote!) worksheets when `interface=*`?  We could print a warning or raise an error, if both are left empty.

 It used to be in the notebook that address="" was an error.  Then when we switched to twisted, it suddenly meant "listen on all interfaces".  Now it's a common option to give.  
 
-The two places I know of where the address is given are: (1) when popping up a web browser pointed at the notebook, and (2) when publishing a worksheet and it shows the URL where people can get the published version.
-
-Ideas:
-* If one gives address="", everywhere else, set the address to the fully qualified domain name.  How to get that in Python?
-* If one gives address="", simply never automatically pop up a viewer, and doesn't display the URL for published worksheets (since it is wrong).  If people want proper URL's they shouldn't be lazy with their address= option.
-* Make address="" an error, and require the user to give a proper fully qualified name.

 Comment: 1
 
 Summary: notebook with address="" option should set the address to something useful
