This has been around for a while; I haven't filed a ticket for it, since
I just retype the URL.

It used to be in the notebook that address="" was an error.  Then when we switched to twisted, it suddenly meant "listen on all interfaces".  Now it's a common option to give.

There is [socket.getfqdn](http://docs.python.org/library/socket.html#socket.getfqdn), but does it help?  On `boxen`:

```python
sage: import socket
sage: socket.getfqdn()
'localhost'
sage: socket.gethostbyname_ex(socket.gethostname())
('localhost', ['boxen', 'boxen'], ['127.0.0.1', '128.208.160.197'])
```
On a local Linux machine, I get

```python
sage: import socket
sage: socket.getfqdn()
'localhost.localdomain'
sage: socket.gethostbyname_ex(socket.gethostname())
('localhost.localdomain', ['localhost', 'foo'], ['127.0.0.1'])
```
all of which happen to be in `/etc/hosts`.

What if we just add an option `published_host=*` (or a variation) and insert it into URLs for published (and remote!) worksheets when `interface=*`?  We could print a warning or raise an error, if both are left empty.
