```
With the python code below::
    class A:
        class B:
            pass
Python 2.6 erroneously set the B.__name__ to "B" instead of "A.B".

Furthermore, upon pickling (here in save_global)
*and* unpickling (in load_global) a class
with name "A.B" in a module mod, the standard
cPickle module searches for "A.B" in mod.__dict__
instead of looking up "A" and then "B" in the result.

This patch works around this by a patch to cPickle.c (in fact a copy of it in the Sage source tree; see #5985) which fixes the name for B to its appropriate value A.B, and inserts 'A.B' = A.B in
mod.__dict__ (hacky, but seems to work) the first time A.B is pickled,
and fixes load_global to implement a proper lookup upon unpickling.

It also ensures that sage/interfaces/sage0.py uses loads/dumps from
sage_object rather than calling directly cPickle.loads/dumps
(+1 by cwitty on this change)

Python source experts are more than welcome to rework/rewrite this patch!

Depends on #5483 and #5985
