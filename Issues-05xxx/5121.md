sage: E = EllipticCurve('37a')
sage: plot(E)
sage: plot(E, xmin=25,xmax=25)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: 'SymbolicEquation' object has no attribute '_fast_float_'
```

This broke David Hansen's thesis.  It also caused me a lot of embarasement during my talk at Sage Days 12!!!

It is a new bug introduced by some plot refactoring recently.
