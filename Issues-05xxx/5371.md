Until the autosave becomes smarter, the default settings should be changed.  Otherwise the number of snapshots eats up too much space.  In the exchange below, Jan Groenewald likes an autosave interval of 2 hours, which might be a bit long since the fix that deletes redundant snapshots is in.  So I would suggest a max history length of 50, as Jan asked for, and an autosave interval of at least 5 minutes.

+1  -- I would be very happy if that change were made officially.
Please submit a patch / ticket.

Attachment: **[trac_5371_worsheet_save_time.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket5371/trac_5371_worsheet_save_time.patch.gz)**

Replying to [@williamstein](#comment%3A1):
Since I was working through this in my own setup, I've added a patch increasing default save time to 1 hour (William Stein's latest suggestion on sage-support) and taking history length down to 100.

I've added documentation on how to change these values for an existing notebook.

See related #5291 and #5300

It appears to me that employing these commands with $DOT_SAGE will

(a) mess with users' changes

(b) fail for those who have changed the defaults.

I'm reasonably confident this would be the case on my own setup, since I don't have my DOT_SAGE directory isolated from where I do testing.  Of course, the doctests could save state, run a test, then restore the state.

However, I never really meant the documentation to be doctests.  The patch was meant to be stop-gap, and not a complete solution to the problem of excessive saves.  I was included a sample command-line session as a way to show users how to change the defaults without editing the source.  So if somebody had tracked the problem this far (like kcrisman today), then they might get some help for a quick fix.

So I'd suggest not including the second reviewer patch.  Sorry I didn't look at this sooner - I misunderstood what was happening with the doctest failures and the added doctest.

I'm going to post some more general comments about all this on sage-support.
