I would suggest to place it in its own file, but maybe Martin should pipe in there, too.

New version of the patch:
* Separated functions related to triangularization into a new file, `toy_variety.py`

* Completely rewrote two subalgorithms that check for and express linear dependence between polynomials. Lazard did not specify the details, and I implemented the previous versions in a manner that in no way could be described as intelligent. (Ironically, I'm scheduled to teach introductory linear algebra this summer.) The present version uses basic linear algebra to answer these questions.

* Removed some doctests on the same two functions, because they are now nested. If there is a way to doctest nested functions, let me know, and I'll restore the doctests.
