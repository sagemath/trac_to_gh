New version of the patch:
* Separated functions related to triangularization into a new file, `toy_variety.py`

* Completely rewrote two subalgorithms that check for and express linear dependence between polynomials. Lazard did not specify the details, and I implemented the previous versions in a manner that in no way could be described as intelligent. (Ironically, I'm scheduled to teach introductory linear algebra this summer.) The present version uses basic linear algebra to answer these questions.

* Removed some doctests on the same two functions, because they are now nested. If there is a way to doctest nested functions, let me know, and I'll restore the doctests.

I made the changes Martin recommended: namely, de-nesting the nested functions and adding doctests.

One reason the functions were nested is that I was using certain assumptions. I thought that made life easier but in retrospect it doesn't. This allowed me to simplify the functions.

In addition the documentation follows the format Martin was using (ReST?). I'm still using my own coefficient_matrix() but I reckon that can be adjusted if desired.
