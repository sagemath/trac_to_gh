Kristin Lauter pointed out that the following input:

```
sage: S = SupersingularModule(389)
sage: D = DiGraph(S.hecke_matrix(2))
sage: D.plot(vertex_size=50).show(figsize=10)
```
produces a graph where the arrowheads of some edges are hidden by the vertex.  (See attachment t2.png for output).

This is going to be a one-ish line fix that I can post as soon as I'm done building 3.3.

If you used -tp there is a race condition in the creation of the GAP workspace, so not surprises there if this was how you tested.

> but the second run passed all tests. Since this has nothing to do with the patch, I'm assuming this was one-time weirdness.


Yep, the fix is to run "sage -c" once before doctesting with -tp so the GAP workspace is current and then the race condition goes away. This has annoyed me enough on sage.math [with -tp 18 :)] that I made this #5389 even though rlm's problem might be unrelated.

Cheers,
