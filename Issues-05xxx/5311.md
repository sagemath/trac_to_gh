You should also be aware of one error, *which has not been fixed in 3.8.3*

The spkg at

 http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/release-cycles-3.3/rc3/atlas-3.8.3.spkg

updates to ATLAS 3.8.3. The following patches were rebased/changed:

* archinfo_linux.c - only the Itanium hunk is needed
* archinfo_x86.c - only case 6 PIV hunk is needed
* Make.top - identical 
* probe_comp.c - needs to be rebased to account for SiCortex fix

Other than that the Core i7 support works, it identifies the Itanium2 boxen on SkyNet correctly (vanilla ATLAS doesn't) and this spkg also fixes #1641.

Cheers,

Michael

Happily installs and runs on 3.3.alpha4 (what I had laying around on the i7 box).  

Other comments recommended by mabshoff: 

(12:51:46 PM) mabs: Well, it is a very clean spkg with 3 beautiful commits.

(12:52:06 PM) mabs: This is the best spkg ever. Michael needs to get a gold star :)

(12:52:41 PM) mabs: I tested it widely, so it will work :)

seems about right
