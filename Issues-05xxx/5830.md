The methods simple_roots(), fundamental_weights() and simple_coroots() for the ambient space of a root system are supposed to return a family. This was never correctly implemented for the reducible types, and the patch corrects this.

There are also some changes in weyl_characters.py, where it was assumed that the root system was irreducible in a few places. The patch corrects this.

The patch is probably correct but I haven't confirmed that it applies cleanly to sage-3.4.1.rc3 or that it passes `sage --testall` so wait to review.
