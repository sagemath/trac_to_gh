Hi Georg,

> I'm more than a bit baffled. I have looked twice now over the patches that went into Sage in between 3.3 and 3.4.alpha0, but still I have no idea why this change would possibly be caused by any of them.


The issue exists in both 3.3 and 3.4.alpha0/rc0 - the Bordeaux document was written in October 2008 by William and never doctested until the ReST patches. 

> The least unplausible one (for me) is the patch about NTL (#5340) --- but I would not really believe that until I see it, i.e. testing with removing/reapplying it. (And I'm currently busy with other things.) 


That patch isn't the cause. It would be interesting to see if it is a generic 32 vs. 64 bit problem or 32 bit linux specific.

Cheers,

Michael

Thanks Michael,

given that information seems to make the patch trivial. William and Craig did some optimization in calculating the underlying P1List for modular symbols (trac #3502 I strongly guess), now using some caching of xgcd's and such.

From what I remember in the code, this hardly could be a 32bit/64bit issue anyway.

So the patch attached just is the "new" correct answer.

OK,

to add more confusion: I re-re-read what Jaap posted above and looked again at the doctest failure with vanilla 3.4.rc0:

* the Bordeaux October talk shows answer "A"
* my computation with Sage 3.4.rc0 shows answer "B"
* Jaap's computation with Sage 3.3 shows answer "B"
* my own computation with Sage 3.3 shows answer "B"
* the patch attached implements the new answer "B"

So it seems that only Jaap's description did mislead me, and the patch is good.

I don't think the patch will do:

On sage.math, 64 bits:

```
jsp@sage:/scratch/jsp/sage-3.4.alpha0$ ./sage

| Sage Version 3.4.rc0, Release Date: 2009-03-02                     |

sage: t2 = ModularSymbols(389,sign=1).hecke_matrix(2); t2[0]
(3, 0, -1, 0, 0, -1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, -1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, 0, 0, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, -1, -1)

```

On Fedora 9, 32 bits:

```
[jaap@paix sage-3.4.alpha0]$ ./sage
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Sage Version 3.4.rc0, Release Date: 2009-03-02                     |

----------------------------------------------------------------------

sage: t2 = ModularSymbols(389,sign=1).hecke_matrix(2); t2[0]
 (3, 0, -1, 0, 0, -1, 1, 0, 0, 0, -1, 1, 0, 1, -1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, -1, -1)

```


Can't explain the different output.

Hi Jaap,

I just re-re-re-read the posts on sage-devel --- there Rob Beezer reported *not* to have this doctest failure on his 64-bit box, but to see it on his 32bit box.

And yes, sigh, I just did the calculation, too, on sage.math (it's 64bit --- or 256bit :-)) and you are right. I'll redo the patch in a minute, on the assumption it is 32 bit versus 64 bit.

Matter-of-factly, the following:

```
ModularSymbols(389,sign=1).basis()
```
gives different output on 32 bit OS X versus 64 bit sage.math. It seems to be consistent w.r.t. architecture , though.

The modular symbols code is old, and definitely should have more examples and doctests. Especially the above one should be added, if only to show clearly that an architecture dependency is there. The doctests that are there do focus on the important stuff, not on how the modular symbols bases are enumerated, or the explicit matrices of Hecke operators. (But e.g. on characteristic polynomials of the Hecke operators and their factorization instead --- which are *not* architecture dependent, as I just did check!) It would be interesting if the Cremona EC-lib modular symbol implementation (also in Sage) yields the same architecture dependency.

I admit I don't know yet where the architecture dependency actually creeps in.

But I believe what I see, and do think the (current) patch does its job.

I tracked down some architecture-dependence in sage.modular when I was working on randstate.pyx (trying to remove "# random"), but then I never got around to submitting the patch.  Perhaps this is the problem?

Mmmh, using "sorted(rels)" instead of "rels" certainly points in the right direction. 

But IMHO, the fix(es) should not be done inside "sparse_2term_quotient(rels, n, F)", where the first argument "rels" is processed, but way before in the calling functions.

More precisely, the function "modS_relations(syms)" should not do "return rels" but should do "return sorted(rels)", and in the function "relation_matrix_wtk_g0(...)" we should do "rels = sorted(rels.update(modI_relations(syms, sign)))", and possibly there are one or two other places more like this.

But could we not postpone this to a point release 3.4.x, and open another ticket for that?!? (The Bordeaux ReST file would have to be touched a second time, but that's trivial.)

I talked to William about this: positive review for the workaround patch, please open another ticket for the above fixes so it will be sorted out later.

Cheers,
