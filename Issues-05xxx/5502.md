<div id="comment:2" align="right">Comment 2</div>

I uploaded trac_5502.patch for this. It applies to sage-3.4.1.rc2 and there are no errors in `sage/combinat/rootsystems/*.py.`.

I have not tested it against the combinat patchseries because at the moment hg qpush -a fails in sage-combinat.

After the patch, the `__repr__` method of `class DynkinDiagram` returns ascii art for the classical Cartan Types.

A natural extension would be to give the extended Dynkin diagram for the untwisted affine types.

<div id="comment:6" align="right">Comment 6</div>

I think the spirit of this patch is the same as #2023.

The idea of this patch is just that if the Cartan type is that
of a classical Lie algebra, you should be able to *somehow*
access it's Dynkin diagram. The solution here is making it part of the string
returned by the `__repr__` method of the class.

We follow the Bourbaki conventions, which is the same as the
programmed-in Cartan types. These diagrams are identical to
those produced by LiE, so you can have them already if you
install that optional package.

```
sage: CartanType("E6").dynkin_diagram()

        O 2
        |
        |
O---O---O---O---O
1   3   4   5   6   
E6
```

You want this if you need to be reminded of what labeling
convention is used. If the Cartan type is not recognized, we get the
old behavior. Thus:

```
sage: CartanType(['E',6,1]).dynkin_diagram()
Dynkin diagram of type ['E', 6, 1]
```

It might be more convenient if untwisted affine types gave the
extended Dynkin diagram, thus:

```
sage: CartanType(['E',6,1]).dynkin_diagram()
        O 0 
        |
        |
        O 2
        |
        |
O---O---O---O---O
1   3   4   5   6
E6~
```

Beyond that, one might implement Dynkin diagrams for twisted
affine types, but that seems less urgent.

It adds doctests to the two ascii art functions.
