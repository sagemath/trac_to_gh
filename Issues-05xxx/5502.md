I uploaded trac_5502.patch for this. It applies to sage-3.4.1.rc2 and there are no errors in `sage/combinat/rootsystems/*.py.`.

I have not tested it against the combinat patchseries because at the moment hg qpush -a fails in sage-combinat.

After the patch, the `__repr__` method of `class DynkinDiagram` returns ascii art for the classical Cartan Types.

A natural extension would be to give the extended Dynkin diagram for the untwisted affine types.

I think the spirit of this patch is the same as #2023.

The idea of this patch is just that if the Cartan type is that
of a classical Lie algebra, you should be able to *somehow*
access it's Dynkin diagram. The solution here is making it part of the string
returned by the `__repr__` method of the class.

We follow the Bourbaki conventions, which is the same as the
programmed-in Cartan types. These diagrams are identical to
those produced by LiE, so you can have them already if you
install that optional package.

```
sage: CartanType("E6").dynkin_diagram()

        O 2
        |
        |
O---O---O---O---O
1   3   4   5   6   
E6
```

You want this if you need to be reminded of what labeling
convention is used. If the Cartan type is not recognized, we get the
old behavior. Thus:

```
sage: CartanType(['E',6,1]).dynkin_diagram()
Dynkin diagram of type ['E', 6, 1]
```

It might be more convenient if untwisted affine types gave the
extended Dynkin diagram, thus:

```
sage: CartanType(['E',6,1]).dynkin_diagram()
        O 0 
        |
        |
        O 2
        |
        |
O---O---O---O---O
1   3   4   5   6
E6~
```

Beyond that, one might implement Dynkin diagrams for twisted
affine types, but that seems less urgent.

The file trac_5502.2.patch add extended Dynkin diagrams as Dynkin diagrams of untwisted affine Cartan types.

Anne Schilling requests twisted affine types, but this is not done.

The patch implements ascii art for all finite and untwisted Cartan types,
which is very useful for visual clues about the numbering of the Dynkin nodes.

All doctests pass.

There are two new functions without doctests:

* extended_dynkin_diagram_ascii_art
* dynkin_diagram_ascii_art

I know they are tested elsewhere, but the 100% rule still applies. Once the doctests have been added the positive review can be reinstated assuming the doctests in the file modified actually pass ;)

Cheers,

Michael

The patch trac_5502-doc.patch goes on top of trac_5502-revised.patch.

It adds doctests to the two ascii art functions.
