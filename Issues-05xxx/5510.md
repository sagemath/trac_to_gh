The attached patch(es) update Sage's interface to work with the HG version of M4RI available at: http://bitbucket.org/malb/m4ri/

Also, a dedicated (faster) `rank()` function was added for dense matrices over GF(2).

The spkg looks great.  Positive review for that.

The patch looks good to me as well.  Here are some timings:

BEFORE:

```
sage: A = random_matrix(GF(2), 1000, 1000) 
sage: timeit('B=A.copy(); B.rank()')
25 loops, best of 3: 8.42 ms per loop
sage: timeit('B=A.copy(); B.rank()')
25 loops, best of 3: 8.39 ms per loop
sage: A = matrix(GF(2),10, 0) 
sage: timeit('B=A.copy(); B.rank()')
625 loops, best of 3: 24.5 µs per loop
sage: timeit('B=A.copy(); B.rank()')
625 loops, best of 3: 24.3 µs per loop
```

AFTER

```
sage: A = random_matrix(GF(2), 1000, 1000) 
sage: timeit('B=A.copy(); B.rank()')
125 loops, best of 3: 6.05 ms per loop
sage: timeit('B=A.copy(); B.rank()')
125 loops, best of 3: 6.09 ms per loop
sage: A = matrix(GF(2),10, 0) 
sage: timeit('B=A.copy(); B.rank()')
625 loops, best of 3: 38.7 µs per loop
sage: timeit('B=A.copy(); B.rank()')
625 loops, best of 3: 40.1 µs per loop
```

Note that the rank of a zero matrix is significantly longer (i.e., twice as long).  Malb, can you comment?

If malb addresses this performance regression sufficiently, then this is a positive review as far as I'm concerned for both the spkg and the patch.

Here is the code that used to be called:

```
    def rank(self):
        x = self.fetch('rank')
        if not x is None: return x
        if self._nrows == 0 or self._ncols == 0:
            return 0
```


And here is the code that is called now:

```
    def rank(self):
        x = self.fetch('rank')
        if not x is None:
            return x
        if self._nrows == 0 or self._ncols == 0:
            return 0
```

i.e. they are identical and thus I have no idea to address this performance regression. Maybe the fetch is more expensive from a subclass or something? In any case, I don't think this should hold back the merge of this ticket.

I re-ran my timings (on a different computer) in 4.0.  Here are the results:

BEFORE:

```
sage: A = matrix(GF(2),100, 100,0)
sage: timeit('A.rank(); A._clear_cache()')
625 loops, best of 3: 47.9 µs per loop
sage: A = matrix(GF(2),10, 10,0)
sage: timeit('A.rank(); A._clear_cache()')
625 loops, best of 3: 39.9 µs per loop
sage: A = matrix(GF(2),100, 100,0)
sage: timeit('A.rank(); A._clear_cache()')
625 loops, best of 3: 47.7 µs per loop
sage: A = matrix(GF(2),1000, 1000,0)
sage: timeit('A.rank(); A._clear_cache()')
625 loops, best of 3: 222 µs per loop
sage: A = random_matrix(GF(2), 1000)
sage: save(A,'m4ri.sobj')
sage: timeit('A.rank(); A._clear_cache()')
125 loops, best of 3: 6.85 ms per loop
sage: A = random_matrix(GF(2), 100)

sage: timeit('A.rank(); A._clear_cache()')
625 loops, best of 3: 164 µs per loop
sage: A = random_matrix(GF(2), 10000)
sage: save(A,'m4ri3.sobj')
sage: timeit('A.rank(); A._clear_cache()')
5 loops, best of 3: 4.24 s per loop
```

AFTER

```
sage: A = matrix(GF(2),100, 100,0)

625 loops, best of 3: 17.9 µs per loop
sage: A = matrix(GF(2),10, 10,0)
sage: timeit('A.rank(); A._clear_cache()')
625 loops, best of 3: 13.4 µs per loop
sage: A = matrix(GF(2),100, 100,0)
sage: timeit('A.rank(); A._clear_cache()')
625 loops, best of 3: 18.3 µs per loop
sage: A = matrix(GF(2),1000, 1000,0)

625 loops, best of 3: 205 µs per loop
sage: A=load('./m4ri.sobj')

sage: A=load('./m4ri3.sobj')
sage: timeit('A.rank(); A._clear_cache()')
5 loops, best of 3: 2.57 s per loop
```

The new code is a clear winner.  I don't know what was happening before, but it seems great now.  Positive review.
