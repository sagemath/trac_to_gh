This is from sagenb running sage 3.3.alpha3:

```
sage: dd = { Partition([1]) : 1 } ; ee = { Partition([1]) : int(1) } ; s = SFASchur(QQ)
sage: (s._from_dict(dd), s._from_dict(ee)) # This is fine
(s[1], s[1])
sage: 1 * s._from_dict(dd) # This is fine
s[1]
sage: 1 * s._from_dict(ee) # This fails
Exception exceptions.TypeError: 'cannot convert a (= 1) to OP' in
'sage.libs.symmetrica.symmetrica._op_schur_general_dict' ignored
function: mult(1) 
python: �73x��
Connection to localhost closed.
```


This is a low priority for me, since the obvious workaround is not to put 'int's in this kind of dictionary, but I wanted to report it.

Update in sage-4.4.  This bug can occur without using private methods.

```
sage: sage: s = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).schur()
sage: sage: s.sum_of_terms([ (Partition([i]), i) for i in range(3) ])
s[1] + 2*s[2]
sage: sage: s.sum_of_terms([ (Partition([i]), i) for i in range(3) ]) * 1
Exception TypeError: 'cannot convert a (= 1) to OP' in 'sage.libs.symmetrica.symmetrica._op_schur_general_dict' ignored
function: mult_bruch(2) not definied for object type:
kind of object is empty-object
python: function: mult_bruch(2) not definied for object type:
: Operation not permitted
```

This is a segfault and exits sage.
