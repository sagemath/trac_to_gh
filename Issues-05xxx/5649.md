How about:

plot(P(6.403124+x), 0, 0.00001) -> okay
plot(P(6.403124+x), 0, 0.000001) -> tick marks on both axes are
missing
plot(P(6.403124+x), 0, 0.0000001) -> IndexError: list index out of
range
plot(P(x), 0, 0.0001) -> ZeroDivisionError: float division

This doesn't look too good...
```

REFEREE REPORT

I'd like to give this a positive review. Applies fine to Sage 4.1, and plot tick marks work better now in a great many cases.

I feel like the readability of _tasteful_ticks() could be improved. Better variable names would help ("d0", "d1", and "p" were hard to decipher). It also looks like there is some duplicated code that could be factored out into a separate method like maybe "extract_two_digits_and_place_value". We can leave the refactor for another ticket perhaps :).

See #6548.  In general there is a lot of work that could be done in axes.py when it comes to documentation and functionality.  There are several other open tickets that have partial code to either significantly rewrite it or to use matplotlib axes - but so far both these solutions have proved more difficult than just slowly improving what already exists.
