How about:

plot(P(6.403124+x), 0, 0.00001) -> okay
plot(P(6.403124+x), 0, 0.000001) -> tick marks on both axes are
missing
plot(P(6.403124+x), 0, 0.0000001) -> IndexError: list index out of
range
plot(P(x), 0, 0.0001) -> ZeroDivisionError: float division

This doesn't look too good...

REFEREE REPORT

I'd like to give this a positive review. Applies fine to Sage 4.1, and plot tick marks work better now in a great many cases.

I feel like the readability of _tasteful_ticks() could be improved. Better variable names would help ("d0", "d1", and "p" were hard to decipher). It also looks like there is some duplicated code that could be factored out into a separate method like maybe "extract_two_digits_and_place_value".
