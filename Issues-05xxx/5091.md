<div id="comment:3" align="right">comment:3</div>

Incorporating the time it takes to call fast_float, the speedup is not that radical:

```
sage: var('x')
x
sage: from sage.ext.fast_eval import fast_float
sage: timeit("find_root(sin(x)-cos(x), 0, pi)")
625 loops, best of 3: 441 µs per loop
sage: timeit("find_root(fast_float(sin(x)-cos(x), x), 0, pi)")
625 loops, best of 3: 393 µs per loop
```
Its better for clients to call fast_float themselves, if they're using find_root inside a loop.

<div id="comment:10" align="right">comment:10</div>

Actually the speedup is 13x here (Sage 7.5beta5) only if the fast float already exists.

```
sage: timeit("find_root(f, 0, pi)")
625 loops, best of 3: 131 µs per loop
sage: timeit("find_root(g, 0, pi)")
625 loops, best of 3: 10.2 µs per loop
sage: timeit("find_root(sin(x)-cos(x), 0, pi)")
625 loops, best of 3: 170 µs per loop
sage: timeit("find_root(fast_float(sin(x)-cos(x), x), 0, pi)")
625 loops, best of 3: 161 µs per loop

sage: timeit('_ = sin(x)-cos(x)')
625 loops, best of 3: 9.3 µs per loop
sage: timeit("_ = fast_float(sin(x)-cos(x), x)")
625 loops, best of 3: 140 µs per loop
```
The creation of `sin(x)-cos(x)` takes 10µs, `find_root` of a fast float takes also 10µs. What is slow is creation of the fast float (130µs) and `find_root` of the normal expression (120µs). So there is no gain converting to fast float because conversion eats it all.

Therefore I propose to close this ticket.
