Presumably, plotting a point is more efficient.  However, 

```
vector([1,2,3]).plot(plot_type='point')
```

plots a sphere instead of a point3d (or point2d, if 2-dimensional).  This should be changed to plot a point.

Another performance enhancement would be using a line3d with arrow_head=True instead of an arrow3d command.  I think that would also preserve aspect ratio better anyway.
