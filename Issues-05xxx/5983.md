This says it all and fails on occasion due to memory layout, etc. Writing a doctest this way is **wrong**:

```
sage -t -long "devel/sage/sage/schemes/jacobians/abstract_jacobian.py"
**********************************************************************
File "/home/mabshoff/build-3.4.2/sage-3.4.2-eno-gcc-4.3.3/devel/sage/sage/schemes/jacobians/abstract_jacobian.py", line 118:
    sage: J1 < P2
Expected:
    False
Got:
    True
**********************************************************************
File "/home/mabshoff/build-3.4.2/sage-3.4.2-eno-gcc-4.3.3/devel/sage/sage/schemes/jacobians/abstract_jacobian.py", line 120:
    sage: J1 > P2
Expected:
    True
Got:
    False
**********************************************************************
```
I am CCing Alex since I believe he wrote this doctest :)

Cheers,

Hehe, I didn't catch this issue while running doctests dozens if not hundred of times on sage.math and many other systems, but it just triggered once on a SkyNet box. I also found an analog problem in other places, so you aren't the only one.

Keep the doctests coming ;)
