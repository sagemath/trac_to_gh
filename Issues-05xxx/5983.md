This says it all and fails on occasion due to memory layout, etc. Writing a doctest this way is **wrong**:

```
sage -t -long "devel/sage/sage/schemes/jacobians/abstract_jacobian.py"

I am CCing Alex since I believe he wrote this doctest :)

Hehe, I didn't catch this issue while running doctests dozens if not hundred of times on sage.math and many other systems, but it just triggered once on a SkyNet box. I also found an analog problem in other places, so you aren't the only one.

Keep the doctests coming ;)
