I have had a careful look at this, and I think I know what's going on. The problem is that for each of these curves, if f is the corresponding newform, then there is a finite set of forms f_1 ... f_m (none of them equal to f) in the space such that for every p, a_p(f) = a_p(f_i) for some i.

This mightily confuses two functions for submodules of Hecke modules: "complement" and "dual_free_module". The former has a workaround, in that if it can't find a complement using only one Hecke operator at a time, it falls back on calling "decomposition" (which is slower, but is immune to this problem) and works out the complement using that. The latter doesn't. But anyway, the two are basically doing the same thing, since the embedded dual free module of a submodule V is by definition the annihilator of the Hecke-stable complement of V (when this exists). So the fix is to get rid of the existing "dual_free_module" routine and replace it with a simpler routine that calls "complement" and then does some trivial linear algebra.

I will post a patch when I get a chance to code it up.

There are two potential first-approximation algorithms for computing complements, or (equivalently) embedded duals: either work on the dual side (cutting down to the smallest space on which Hecke acts like it does on self) or work on the ambient side (cutting down to the smallest space on which Hecke acts like it does on the quotient ambient/self). \n\nWhat we had before was one algorithm in `complement` and the other in `dual_free_module`, never exploiting the fact that the two problems are essentially equivalent. I standardised on the algorithm that `complement` was using, largely because the code to handle the pathological case (for which neither algorithm works) was already there in the `complement` routine.\n\nThe classy fix is to heuristically choose which algorithm to use, because (in non-pathological cases) the dual-side version is much quicker when the given submodule is much smaller than the ambient space, and the ambient-side version is much quicker when the given submodule is most of the ambient space. This is (roughly) what is meant by the comment in `submodule.py` saying:\n\n```\n# TODO: optimize in some cases by computing image of\n# complementary factor instead of kernel...?\n```\n\nDavid",

Hi Craig,

It's a delicate thing. There are two potential first-approximation algorithms for computing complements, or (equivalently) embedded duals: either work on the dual side (cutting down to the smallest space on which Hecke acts like it does on self) or work on the ambient side (cutting down to the smallest space on which Hecke acts like it does on the quotient ambient/self). 

What we had before was one algorithm in `complement` and the other in `dual_free_module`, never exploiting the fact that the two problems are essentially equivalent. I standardised on the algorithm that `complement` was using, largely because the code to handle the pathological case (for which neither algorithm works) was already there in the `complement` routine.

The classy fix is to heuristically choose which algorithm to use, because (in non-pathological cases) the dual-side version is much quicker when the given submodule is much smaller than the ambient space, and the ambient-side version is much quicker when the given submodule is most of the ambient space. This is (roughly) what is meant by the comment in `submodule.py` saying:

```
# TODO: optimize in some cases by computing image of
# complementary factor instead of kernel...?
```

Sorry I've been so slow about getting to this.

The patch looks great, but I have one gripe. I hate the fact that we're working around Python's "private" obfuscation (the `_HeckeSubmodule__attr` thing). It's brittle, because if the class name changes, or if certain methods get overridden, it'll break. Worse, it's ugly. `:)` I think we should fix it, though I'm not sure I know the "right" way. Some options:

* change these to attributes with a single underscore 
* set these attributes to `None` in the constructor, and check if they're not `None`
* I know the `combinat` branch has a `cached_method` decorator -- I don't know if it has a system for checking if the attribute is set, but it might.

I guess I'd lean towards the third if it works, and if not, the second (and filing a trac ticket asking for the enhancement to `cached_method`). One option I **don't** like: adding flags for each attribute to see if it's set.

I spoke too soon. Something rather harmful has in fact happened: the
wrong patches have been merged for track #5080. My first attempt at
fixing this problem caused a catastrophic slowdown in elliptic curve
Sha routines, so I started again from scratch and did a new patch that
worked differently. It seems that the old patch has been merged, with
the result that

sage: EllipticCurve("858k1").sha().an_padic(7)

has been slowed down by *several orders of magnitude*. That was why I
was seeing timeouts in that file.

To reiterate: the patch "trac_5080.patch" on that ticket is evil, bad
and wrong, should not have been merged, and must be removed from Sage
ASAP.
