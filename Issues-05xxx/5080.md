I have had a careful look at this, and I think I know what's going on. The problem is that for each of these curves, if f is the corresponding newform, then there is a finite set of forms f_1 ... f_m (none of them equal to f) in the space such that for every p, a_p(f) = a_p(f_i) for some i. It was a bit of a surprise to me that this is possible, but it doesn't contradict multiplicity one, and in fact if you take any fixed form and consider its twists by chi1, chi2, and chi1 * chi2 for any two quadratic characters chi1, chi2 of coprime moduli then you get an example.

This mightily confuses two functions for submodules of Hecke modules: "complement" and "dual_free_module". The former has a workaround, in that if it can't find a complement using only one Hecke operator at a time, it falls back on calling "decomposition" (which is slower, but is immune to this problem) and works out the complement using that. The latter doesn't. But anyway, the two are basically doing the same thing, since the embedded dual free module of a submodule V is by definition the annihilator of the Hecke-stable complement of V (when this exists). So the fix is to get rid of the existing "dual_free_module" routine and replace it with a simpler routine that calls "complement" and then does some trivial linear algebra.

I will post a patch when I get a chance to code it up.

Unfortunately this patch causes a massive speed regression:

```
sage: time EllipticCurve('858k2').sha().an_padic(Integer(7))
CPU times: user 8.90 s, sys: 0.33 s, total: 9.23 s
Wall time: 9.52 s
7^2 + O(7^3)
```
With both patches from this ticket this one alone takes minutes, so sorry, but "needs work".

Cheers,

Hi Craig,

The classy fix is to heuristically choose which algorithm to use, because (in non-pathological cases) the dual-side version is much quicker when the given submodule is much smaller than the ambient space, and the ambient-side version is much quicker when the given submodule is most of the ambient space. This is (roughly) what is meant by the comment in `submodule.py` saying:

I spoke too soon. Something rather harmful has in fact happened: the
wrong patches have been merged for track #5080. My first attempt at
fixing this problem caused a catastrophic slowdown in elliptic curve
Sha routines, so I started again from scratch and did a new patch that
worked differently. It seems that the old patch has been merged, with
the result that

sage: EllipticCurve("858k1").sha().an_padic(7)

has been slowed down by *several orders of magnitude*. That was why I
was seeing timeouts in that file.

To reiterate: the patch "trac_5080.patch" on that ticket is evil, bad
and wrong, should not have been merged, and must be removed from Sage
ASAP.

I checked that the new patch applies cleanly to 4.1.alpha2, all tests in modular/hecke pass, and the function mabshoff highlighted runs fine in about 10s.

The tag still said "positive review", but now it deserves it again.
