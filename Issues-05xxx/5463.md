There are lots of questions sage-support in which people trying to do basic calculus or plotting have gotten confused about how to specify a "function" to be plotted, differentiated, etc. The attached patch adds a section to the tutorial with some remarks about this issue.

See [http://www.math.washington.edu/~palmieri/tutorial/tour_functions.html](http://www.math.washington.edu/~palmieri/tutorial/tour_functions.html) for a typeset version (although you can just type 'sage -docbuild tutorial html' to get your own version).

The ReST here looks funny: http://www.math.washington.edu/~palmieri/tutorial/tour_functions.html

I.e., in each of the code blocks there is some text afterwards explaining the example, and it is typeset as code instead of text.  I don't know why.   Again, just a minor ReST issue.  Mhansen?

Yep, the ReST output does look funny, i.e. it seems that there is a lot of text that shouldn't be verbatim is rendered verbatim.
