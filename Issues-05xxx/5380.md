The development map (devmap) at



http://www.sagemath.org/development-map.html



currently supports search of a developer's contributions by her/his real name. For most developers, their real names diff from their trac usernames. The devmap should support search of contributions by trac usernames as well.

The attached XML file `contributors.xml` is an updated version of the file



http://www.sagemath.org/res/contributors.xml



The new version adds trac usernames of most people listed on the Sage development map. However, there are still a number of developers for whom that I've not been able to determine their trac usernames. These people are:
1. Antti Ajanki
2. Bill Allombert
3. Benjamin Antieau
4. Jennifer Balakrishnan
5. Gregory Bard
6. Karim Belabas
7. Jonathan Bober
8. Michael Brickenstein

11. Alex Clemesha
12. Doug Cutrell
13. Alyson Deines
14. Tom Denton
15. Jan Groenewald
16. Rob Gross
17. Bill Hart
18. Leif Hille
19. Neal Holtz
20. Sean Howe
21. Naqi Jaffery
22. Peter Jipsen

However, Alexander Dreyer's trac username looks suspicious/ambiguous to me. I think his trac username is "PolyBoRi".

Hi Minh,

* not all people listed with credit have trac accounts, but I can go over the list
* PolyBoRi is a single account for Alexander Dreyer and Michael Brickenstein - we might want to fix that.

OK, with `contributors.xml` uploaded, I see that visitors to the devmap are able to search for a developer's contribution. If the said XML file contains a developer's trac username, then the visitor would be presented with a list of (possible) contributions made by the developer in question. However, if the XML file doesn't contain the developer's trac username, then the search query would be made using the developer's full name as provided on the devmap.



However, I still see a number of weird things in the trac search functionalities. Disclaimer: I'm not an expert on how the trac server searches for a developer's contributions.
1. In cases where a developer's trac username has not appeared on any trac tickets, the search is still performed using the developer's username. I think this would likely result in a misleading list of search results, and the said developer's contribution on trac tickets would be missed by the search. A case in point is Maite Aranes, who has the username "mtaranes". After clicking on the link "search contributions", the search result is just Maite's name highlighted on the page
 
 

 http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/wiki/WikiStart
  
 

  From the release note of Sage 3.3 and release tour, I'm 99.9% certain that Maite has contributed code in that release, in particular the ticket #4831.
1. If a developer's trac username is two characters in length, then the search query returns a "Search Error" message, with the explanation

   ```
   Search query too short. Query must be at least 3 characters long.
   ```
   For example, Yi Qiang's username is "yi" and a search of his contribution returns a search error. This is weird, because Yi has made substantial contributions to the dsage package, and I think he's the original developer of dsage. I'm not sure how to fix this. However, an ad hoc fix might be to have the following policy for trac usernames: i.e. a trac username must be at least 3 characters in length. Perhaps someone can suggest a better workaround.

Apart from the above comments, someone else should verify/review this ticket and the updated devmap.

i wanted to find a way to search for contributions where no trac account is known. That's why i take the real name. Plan B would have been to only include the link for those, where a trac account name is given and not for all the others. Testing some names seemed to be good enough to include the real name for those where no trac account is given...

Mixing trac account name and real name turned out to be a bad idea. In that case, sometimes nothing at all was found.

> "yi" and a search of his contribution returns a search error. 


yeahr well, trac search isn't good. probably searching with google (restricted site search on trac.sagemath.org) would be better - at least for two letter words like this one ;)

using the "Search contributions" links at

Searching contributions of each of the above people result in a wiki page that says something like this:



http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/wiki/TimothyClemans



That's because the trac search function mistakens the trac usernames of these people as empty wiki pages.
