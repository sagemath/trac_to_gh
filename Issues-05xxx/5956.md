As discussed at this [sage-devel thread](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/c411254b7bc0bb97), the optional argument `figsize` of the command `show()` needs to clearly state that the units of the image are in inches. As of Sage 3.4.1, the docstring for `show()` says:

```
- ``figsize``- [width, height] (same for square aspect)
```
which can be interpreted to mean that one can do something like `figsize=[w,h]`. But something like the following produces a segmentation fault:

```

Essentially, the documentation for `show()` needs to be updated, especially the optional arguments, to clearly explain the units of measurement of the width and height of the image size. Also, it would be a good idea to specify how one can pass in values for those dimensions. For example, can one do this `figsize=[124,124]`?

This would be a good start.  

What's the reference for the dpi, just out of curiosity?  (I assume it's right in the Sage or mpl source.)  Also, telling us the maximum possible would be helpful, given the errors - especially since the one above is confusing since the `32768` is in "dots", not inches.  Presumably if one reset the default dpi...

```
sage: P.show(figsize=[1,327],dpi=100)
sage: P.show(figsize=[1,328],dpi=100)
<ValueError>
sage: P.show(figsize=[1,328],dpi=80)
```
So this should be very, very clear, in order to resolve this ticket.

Additionally, you'll want to add a doctest to verify that some things don't go boom, and that the error is correctly raised, etc.  Maybe even a `# not tested` line with the segfault.

Finally, we may also want to report the segfault upstream with a "pure" matplotlib example, if you can concoct one.

But all that said, thanks very much for looking at this - this is just part of the normal review process, good start.

Thank you for the pointers. In matplotlib/rcsetup.py the default figure properties start at line 508.

I submitted a new patch to include what I think you mean by a doctest. I wasn't sure what you meant about including '# not tested line with the segfault'. Should I include an example with the segfault in the docstring?

Strangely enough, I did not raise any errors when I tried a 'pure' matplotlib example...

```
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
f=plt.figure(figsize=[28,10],dpi=100)
f.show()
```


Would someone kindly review  and let me know what else should be included in the doctest? I appreciate your patience with this, as I am (obviously) new and hoping to learn. Thank you!

This ticket is awesome! Brought my laptop to a crawl! :)

`@`emchennyc: I might come back to this ticket if kcrisman doesn't. For now, it seems that matplotlib (even the latest 1.2.0 release) does not handle the parameters `[256,256]` properly. It tries to allocate memory and then fails, resulting in a segfault.

What kcrisman asks is a doctest like this (under a `TEST:` section; look at how these sections are written in other functions or other files):

```
TEST:

The following plot segfaults sage and should not be doctested.::

    sage: plot(x).show(figsize=[256,256]) # not tested

```

If you do happen to run this command, be very careful. I suggest you set a ulimit before you start sage. If you have, say 3G, of memory/RAM, then set ulimit to 2G and only then start sage. If you have even less memory then you will need to set even lower ulimit, but sage won't run properly below 1G.

```
$ ulimit -v 2000000
$ sage
sage: plot(x).show(figsize=[256,256]) # boom, segv!!
```

That said, I would like you to set some defaults in your editor. Currently, your patch contains a mixture of tabs and spaces. I suggest you change the settings in your editor to not insert tabs, and instead insert 4 spaces every time you press a tab key.

`@`ppurka Thank you for the feedback! The tests I included in the attached patch pass when I run:
./sage -t -verbose 'devel/sage-5956/sage/plot/graphics.py'

Then, I
- ran ./sage -docbuild reference html
- navigated to SAGEROOT/devel/branch/doc/output/html/en/reference
- opened plotting.html in a browser
- visited the doc page for Graphics objects
but did not see the documentation that I added. Did I miss a step?

Also, here is a matplotlib example which I believe this bug is related to. Please correct me if I'm wrong and feel free to advise if I should use this example to report as a matplotlib issue: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=5Arg52e2

You have to do ./sage -b first.  The tests run on the copy of the code in the devel/sage directory, but the docs build off the ones in the build directory which that command does.

Thanks for the update. There is one more thing that I overlooked earlier. The documentation should mention that the number `32768` is in dots per inch. Maybe the text of `ValueError` should also end in **32768 dots per inch**.

```
sage: e.show(figsize=[328,10],dpi=100)
ValueError: width and height must each be below 32768 dots per inch.
```
I think the following modification to the `figsize` documentation is warranted.

```
- ``figsize`` - (default: [8.0,6.0]) [width, height] inches. The maximum value
  of each of the width and the height can be 327 inches, at the default ``dpi``
  of 100 dpi, which is just shy of the maximum allowed value of 32768 dots
  per inch.
```
Then, the test should have the following description:

```
        The figsize width and height parameters must be less than 328 inches each,
        corresponding to the maximum allowed dpi of 32768.::
```
This will make the number 32768 more clear to anyone who is curious what that number means in the `ValueError`.

I am unable to replicate your matplotlib example. A figure doesn't seem to have a `show()` attribute. However, the following example successfully crashes matplotlib.

Use `ValueError` for bad user input, not `AssertionError`. If there is any way to produce an `AssertionError` using public functions, that is by definition a bug.

Assertions are meant to check internal consistency inside algorithms. They express "I *know* this condition is true", not "I want to *check* that this condition is true".

Okay, fair enough.  The problem is that now I have to go remember how to check that something is a numeric type as well - which is better in the long run, but which is tricky with all the zillions of numeric input types Sage has... does something like `isnumeric` work?  It sounds familiar.

Just convert, for example

```
x = float(x)

How about we prepend the segfaulting line with a comment? Like this:

```
sage: #p.show(figsize=[232,232],dpi=100) # not tested
```
So, anyone who blindly copy pastes will get nothing out of it. And has to make two mistakes to make it segfault. I think the reason this example is there is to make the user aware that unreasonable parameters will result in an uncomfortable end.

Is there a check that `len(figsize) == 2`?

I would change the logic of those branches to

```
if figure is None:
    # add a good comment here
    ...
elif isinstance(figsize, (list, tuple)):
    # figsize should be two positive numbers
    if len(figsize) != 2:
        raise ValueError('...')
    ...
else:
    # figsize should be a single positive number
    figsize = float(figsize) # to pass to mpl
    if figsize <= 0:
        raise ValueError("figsize should be positive, not {0}".format(figsize))
    ...
```

And add a doctest for some non-float `figsize` argument like

```
sage: var('x')
sage: ...figsize=x...
```
