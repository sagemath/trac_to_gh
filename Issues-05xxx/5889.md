Add random simplicial complexes to the class of examples of simplicial complexes, so you can do

```
sage: simplicial_complexes.RandomComplex(6, 2)
```
to get a random simplicial complex with 6 vertices, all possible edges, and the possible 2-dimensional simplices (triangles) randomly included (or not).

This looks good.

There is one little issue: as far as I know, you do not need to label the doctest with #random.  Sage doctests work in such a way that the same random seed is set before testing, so you will get the same results.  So the #random should be removed from line 712.

Apart from that, positive review.


Michael, should we have a new trac component labeled "algebraic topology"?  It's a bit weird to have this under "misc", and it will probably come in handy at the next Sage Days in Seattle.

Okay, this patch is identical to the first one, but without "#random".  It passes all tests for me on sage.math, although I would like someone else to double-check that.

Alex,

"Algebraic Topology" - here we come. I have made John default owner for now :)

If you want any other component please let me know and I will add them.

Cheers,
