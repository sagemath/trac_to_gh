Add random simplicial complexes to the class of examples of simplicial complexes, so you can do

```
sage: simplicial_complexes.RandomComplex(6, 2)
```
to get a random simplicial complex with 6 vertices, all possible edges, and the possible 2-dimensional simplices (triangles) randomly included (or not).

This looks good.

There is one little issue: as far as I know, you do not need to label the doctest with #random.  Sage doctests work in such a way that the same random seed is set before testing, so you will get the same results.  So the #random should be removed from line 712.

Apart from that, positive review.


Michael, should we have a new trac component labeled "algebraic topology"?  It's a bit weird to have this under "misc", and it will probably come in handy at the next Sage Days in Seattle.

Alex,

"Algebraic Topology" - here we come. I have made John default owner for now :)

If you want any other component please let me know and I will add them.

Cheers,
