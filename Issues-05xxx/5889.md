Add random simplicial complexes to the class of examples of simplicial complexes, so you can do

```
sage: simplicial_complexes.RandomComplex(6, 2)
```
to get a random simplicial complex with 6 vertices, all possible edges, and the possible 2-dimensional simplices (triangles) randomly included (or not).

Michael, should we have a new trac component labeled "algebraic topology"?  It's a bit weird to have this under "misc", and it will probably come in handy at the next Sage Days in Seattle.
