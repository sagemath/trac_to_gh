If I evaluate 

```python
print 'Hello!'
plot(sin(x))
```
then "Delete All Output," "Save & quit" and reopen the worksheet, the plot (not the text) reappears.

We could also delete the cells' files in `Worksheet.delete_all_output`.  But we may wish to do this synchronously; otherwise, a long-running or simply delayed (e.g., on a busy server) thread might remove newly-written files.

(For deleting just one cell, there might be a similar but less likely race condition.  For example, if after deleting a cell (with ID <id>) in the browser, a user pastes and saves ``id=<id>|\n<updated code>///\n\n`` in the "Edit" window, and re-evaluates the cell, a delayed `Deferred` could delete new files.)

What do most users expect/prefer?

I'm adding `schilly` to the Cc: list, since he's almost certainly better qualified than I on this (and many other) topics.

V3 deletes the output synchronously (on the server), whether it's for one cell or for the whole worksheet.

I think this is much safer, since it avoids race conditions.  Although deferred deletions could help performance, we already copy a cell's output synchronously.  But with the appropriate locks or other synchronization constructs (e.g., "marking" cells for deletion), we could offload some tasks to other threads or to worksheet processes.

How should this patch slow things down?  The new code is only called when deleting a cell.  In fact, it could even speed up the notebook as there will be fewer files around.

Only the release manager should ever close tickets (with the exception of spam tickets or tickets which have no interesting content at all).

Yes, I will merge it.

This reminds me of the fact that we should really discuss how to merge the new notebook, and coordination between the current notebook and the new notebook.  It's a topic which I started several times, but still I don't have a good answer.
