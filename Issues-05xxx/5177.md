If you delete a cell, it doesn't delete the directory for the cell, at least not very soon (it does seem that they eventually get deleted).  Should it maybe when you log off the worksheet?  Or maybe immediately.  This is particularly bad when there are large computations or graphics involved, and may contribute to making .sws files rather large even if there are few cells.

<a id='comment:5'></a>If I evaluate 

```python
print 'Hello!'
plot(sin(x))
```
then "Delete All Output," "Save & quit" and reopen the worksheet, the plot (not the text) reappears.

We could also delete the cells' files in `Worksheet.delete_all_output`.  But we may wish to do this synchronously; otherwise, a long-running or simply delayed (e.g., on a busy server) thread might remove newly-written files.

(For deleting just one cell, there might be a similar but less likely race condition.  For example, if after deleting a cell (with ID <id>) in the browser, a user pastes and saves ``id=<id>|\n<updated code>///\n\n`` in the "Edit" window, and re-evaluates the cell, a delayed `Deferred` could delete new files.)

What do most users expect/prefer?

I'm adding `schilly` to the Cc: list, since he's almost certainly better qualified than I on this (and many other) topics.

How should this patch slow things down?  The new code is only called when deleting a cell.  In fact, it could even speed up the notebook as there will be fewer files around.

Only the release manager should ever close tickets (with the exception of spam tickets or tickets which have no interesting content at all).

Yes, I will merge it.

This reminds me of the fact that we should really discuss how to merge the new notebook, and coordination between the current notebook and the new notebook.  It's a topic which I started several times, but still I don't have a good answer.
