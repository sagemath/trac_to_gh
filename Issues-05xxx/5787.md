This is a continuation of #5736. The patch which I am about to upload contains more doctests and bugfixes for sage/modular/hecke. The main change this makes is in the methods for constructing elements of Hecke algebras: previously these accepted more or less arbitrary matrices as input (despite the fact that all Hecke algebras in Sage are supposed to be commutative). Similarly, any element of a full Hecke algebra could be coerced into the corresponding anemic algebra -- including the Hecke operators at primes dividing the level -- which is not great.

I've also added an extra check into the !__mul!__ method of the MatrixMorphism class; what's the point of having morphism objects that remember their domain and codomain if one doesn't check compatibility when composing them?

The patch I've just uploaded unifies the previous two patches, and adds some more doctests to bring the coverage higher still (although not quite to 100% as I don't have time right now to understand some of the weirder things that are going on in hecke/submodule.py). Note that again this patch is designed to be applied over the patches at #5736.

I think it would be better for David to review Craig's extra patch rather than a newcomer.

Last docdays I started properly doctesting modsym, but only got two of the files done.  I do intend to do more.

On inspection, it turns out that the `__cmp__` routine was written stupidly anyway, so I rewrote it. Hence the third patch above. So now applying trac_5787-all.patch, trac_5787_pt2_rebased.patch, and trac_5787_pt3.patch (on top of the already-merged #5736 patches and #4357) should not conflict -- at least it doesn't on my machine.

Craig: I'm entirely happy with the rest of your changes, so if you could just check to make sure that applying #5736 + #4357 + the patches here works for you and passes doctests, I think we can call this a positive review at last.
