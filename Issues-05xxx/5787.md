This is a continuation of #5736. The patch which I am about to upload contains more doctests and bugfixes for sage/modular/hecke. The main change this makes is in the methods for constructing elements of Hecke algebras: previously these accepted more or less arbitrary matrices as input (despite the fact that all Hecke algebras in Sage are supposed to be commutative). Similarly, any element of a full Hecke algebra could be coerced into the corresponding anemic algebra -- including the Hecke operators at primes dividing the level -- which is not great.

I've also added an extra check into the !__mul!__ method of the MatrixMorphism class; what's the point of having morphism objects that remember their domain and codomain if one doesn't check compatibility when composing them?

I think it would be better for David to review Craig's extra patch rather than a newcomer.

Last docdays I started properly doctesting modsym, but only got two of the files done.  I do intend to do more.
