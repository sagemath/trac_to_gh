Hi, the "problem" is, there are now two websites, the current one and the new one. I've edited the current one and the new one, so you can close this ticket now. But I want to avoid this duplicate work in the future.

Also for the future, it would be easier if you, mvngu, just send me the new .xml file with all edits at once and no diffs.

Do you mean a process like this: Download the XML file http://www.sagemath.org/res/contributors.xml and edit it. Then attach the locally modified XML file to a ticket and CC you on that ticket? Or email the modified XML file to your Gmail account?

yes, attach to a ticket is the best way, because i can download it directly from trac into the web directory (1-step) and you know exactly what's on the web. i'm also not updating it, since i'm emailing you changes i would do - do don't worry with diffs!
