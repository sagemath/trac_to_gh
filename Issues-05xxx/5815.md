The new line of code, like the CSS "hack" which follows it, depends, I think, on an exact match.

Perhaps it's better to add code which disables editing.

trac-5815-docs-and-tinymce.patch takes care of this issue by implementing the idea from the comment above (i.e., don't put the TinyMCE trigger in when you are looking at a doc page).

mpatel, can you review this patch?

The new patch works and is definitely better than the first.

I noticed that copying or printing a docbrowser worksheet omits Sphinx' stylesheet.  One-cell mode also appears to be broken.  Of course, these are separate issues, and I can open new tickets.
