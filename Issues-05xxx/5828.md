You've found a bug in the coercion in the special case of a relative extension of degree 1.
Here's some simpler code to illustrate it:

sage: K.<w> = QuadraticField(-1)
sage: KX.<X> = K[]
sage: H.<h> = K.extension(X-1)
sage: H(w)
0

The internal function responsible for the bug is:

sage: H._NumberField_relative__base_inclusion(w)
0
```

The tests should be indented, and you should only have "::" only on the last line before the test.
The patch now has

```
        TESTS::

        Check that #5828 is solved::

        sage: K.<w> = QuadraticField(-1)
        sage: KX.<X> = K[]
        sage: H.<h> = K.extension(X-1)
        sage: H(w)

but I think it should be
