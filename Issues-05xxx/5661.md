sage does not differentiate numerically at this time; a `numerical_diff` similar to Maple's `fdiff` would have helped me implement Riemann theta functions.

sage's `numerical_integral` uses GSL, which means it only handles RDF.  Weak!

Pari can do arbitrary precision numerical integration.  It would be cool if you could make a version of numerical_integral that uses PARI instead, and is hence arbitrary precision.    It would likely be a lot lot slower than the GSL-based numerical_integral, though.

Cool.  And in case people don't know, mpmath is in Sage.

```
sage: import sympy.mpmath
sage: sympy.mpmath.
Display all 206 possibilities? (y or n)
```
