sage does not differentiate numerically at this time; a `numerical_diff` similar to Maple's `fdiff` would have helped me implement Riemann theta functions.

sage's `numerical_integral` uses GSL, which means it only handles RDF.  Weak!

Cool.  And in case people don't know, mpmath is in Sage.

```
sage: import sympy.mpmath
sage: sympy.mpmath.
Display all 206 possibilities? (y or n)
```
