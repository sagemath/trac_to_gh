This is a followup to #5219:

* When building ATLAS in SSE2 only mode the sage-flags should be set accordingly to avoid that Sage complains on startup.

* We do not use any SSE instructions beyond PNI (i.e. SSE3) at the moment, yet we check for SSSE3 and SSE4 flags. So do not add them to sage-flags since they will trigger wrong warning.

* Document SAGE_SIMD_MODE in README.txt

Cheers,

Michael

That is part of #5849.

A P4 that does not have lahf is exceedingly rare and AFAIK we have never seen a problem with it, but I am sure we will hit it in the future. Note that x86 vs. core2 code in 64 bit MPIR is quote noticeable performance wise for some benchmarks.

Cheers,
