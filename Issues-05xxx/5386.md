The attached patch implements simplicial complexes, chain complexes, and their homology. Some examples:

```
sage: S = SimplicialComplex(1, [[0], [1]])  # a two-point space
sage: S2 = S*S*S          # its three-fold join with itself; i.e., a 2-sphere
sage: S2
Simplicial complex with 6 vertices and 8 facets
sage: S2.homology()       # the reduced homology of S2
{0: 0, 1: 0, 2: Z}
sage: from sage.homology.examples import matching_complex
sage: M = matching_complex(8)
sage: sum(M.f_vector())   # total number of simplices in M
764
sage: M.homology(2)
Z^132
sage: from sage.homology.examples import torus, klein_bottle
sage: torus()
Simplicial complex with vertex set (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) and 14 facets
sage: klein_bottle()
Simplicial complex with 9 vertices and 18 facets
sage: klein_bottle().cohomology()
{0: 0, 1: Z, 2: C2}
sage: torus().product(klein_bottle())
Simplicial complex with 63 vertices and 1512 facets  
```

The code could be made much faster, I think (for example, by writing some of it in Cython); if anyone wants to undertake this, that would be great.  Otherwise, it might happen during Sage Days 15.

Some things changed in sage-3.4.1.rc2, so this needs to be fixed (this is purely due to bitrot, not your fault):

I think there is a bug in stanly_reisener_ring:

```
sage: S = SimplicialComplex(['a', 'b', 'c'], (('a', 'b'), ('a', 'c'), ('b', 'c')))
sage: S.stanley_reisner_ring()
Quotient of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in a, c, b over Integer Ring by the ideal (a*c*b)
sage: S.product(S).stanley_reisner_ring()
...
ValueError: variable names must be alphanumeric, but one is '('b', 'c')' which is not.
```

* It should be easier to get at all the standard examples of complexes, e.g., like with graphs if you do `graphs.<tab>` you get a bunch of graphs.  Could you make it so there is something like `complexes.<tab>` or something like that (which makes senses) and gives examples?

Please ping me once you fix the above, so I can give this *amazing patch* (!) a positive review.

Hi there,

Replying to [@williamstein](#comment:1):
>     AttributeError: `__len__` has been removed; use .cardinality() instead

I found this one by googling through trac... This is due to #5308. See my comments there and on http://wiki.sagemath.org/sage-3.4.1 why we had to raise an error instead of issuing a deprecated warning. 

The fix is simple enough: as said in the error message to compute the number of `maximal_faces` you should ask `maximal_faces.cardinality()` which returns an arbitrary large sage integer and not call `len` which is specified to return a plain machine int.

Cheers,

Florent

Here's a new patch, rebased against 3.4.1.rc2.  It passes all tests (with sage -tp -long) for me on sage.math.

I fixed the bug with the Stanley-Reisner ring.  It works now (although it's extremely slow).

> Could you make it so there is something like complexes.<tab> or something like that (which makes senses) and gives examples? 

I decided to use `simplicial_complexes`: since someone may want to add `simplicial_sets` or `CW_complexes` or other related things, having an unambiguous long name seemed better than having a shorter name which might collide with future use.  I also capitalized the examples, since that's how the graph examples work: `simplicial_complexes.Sphere`, etc.

Also, in the interests of full disclosure, the old version had some fishy math in it --  a routine which sped things up but depended on a conjecture. It shouldn't have been there in the first place, and I have excised it.

Florent, thanks for the comment, and even more, thanks for the helpful error message.  (It turns out that I was converting `maximal_faces` into a list anyway, so I just called `len` on that list; that was the easiest fix for my situation.  If someone tries to create a simplicial complex for which the number of maximal faces cannot be represented by a python int, I think this will be the least of their problems. :)
