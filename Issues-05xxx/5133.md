**Review**

* typo: `l_bound` -> `u_bound` in docstring
* the string representation is quite unusual, not sure if that's desired.
* `isinstance(val, list)` should allow more types `isinstance(val, (list,tuple,GeneratorType))`
* Why is it okay to use `proof=False` for random integers, because they are so small anyway? That should be added as a comment.
* `__cmp__` wants you to return -1,0,1 and not `True` or `False`, cf. http://docs.python.org/reference/datamodel.html
* `INPUT::` -> `INPUT:`, it doesn't get two : because the following block is not literal
* patch applies cleanly against 4.1
* doctest failures:

> * typo: `l_bound` -> `u_bound` in docstring

Fixed.

> * the string representation is quite unusual, not sure if that's desired.

Changed it to:

> * `isinstance(val, list)` should allow more types `isinstance(val, (list,tuple,GeneratorType))`

Done.

> * Why is it okay to use `proof=False` for random integers, because they are so small anyway? That should be added as a comment.

I'd forgotten that I put that in. Good catch. I removed that argument, so we use the global flag now.

> * `__cmp__` wants you to return -1,0,1 and not `True` or `False`, cf. http://docs.python.org/reference/datamodel.html

Fixed. Who would compare these things anyway? :)

>    * `INPUT::` -> `INPUT:`, it doesn't get two : because the following block is not literal

Fixed.

> * patch applies cleanly against 4.1

> * doctest failures:

Doh! I only doctested the `sage/matrix` directory. Apparently the only user of `MultiModularBasis`, namely `matrix_integer_dense.pyx` didn't have doctests for it. Now it does.
