**Review**

* typo: `l_bound` -> `u_bound` in docstring
* the string representation is quite unusual, not sure if that's desired.
* `isinstance(val, list)` should allow more types `isinstance(val, (list,tuple,GeneratorType))`
* Why is it okay to use `proof=False` for random integers, because they are so small anyway? That should be added as a comment.
* `__cmp__` wants you to return -1,0,1 and not `True` or `False`, cf. http://docs.python.org/reference/datamodel.html
* `INPUT::` -> `INPUT:`, it doesn't get two : because the following block is not literal
* patch applies cleanly against 4.1
* doctest failures:

Replying to [malb](#comment%3A2):

>  * typo: `l_bound` -> `u_bound` in docstring


Fixed.

>  * the string representation is quite unusual, not sure if that's desired.


Changed it to:

```
sage: from sage.ext.multi_modular import MultiModularBasis_base
sage: mm = MultiModularBasis_base([3, 5, 7]); mm
MultiModularBasis with moduli [3, 5, 7]
```

>  * `isinstance(val, list)` should allow more types `isinstance(val, (list,tuple,GeneratorType))`


Done.

>  * Why is it okay to use `proof=False` for random integers, because they are so small anyway? That should be added as a comment.


I'd forgotten that I put that in. Good catch. I removed that argument, so we use the global flag now.

>  * `__cmp__` wants you to return -1,0,1 and not `True` or `False`, cf. http://docs.python.org/reference/datamodel.html


Fixed. Who would compare these things anyway? :)

>  * `INPUT::` -> `INPUT:`, it doesn't get two : because the following block is not literal


Fixed.

>  * patch applies cleanly against 4.1


>  * doctest failures:


Doh! I only doctested the `sage/matrix` directory. Apparently the only user of `MultiModularBasis`, namely `matrix_integer_dense.pyx` didn't have doctests for it. Now it does.
