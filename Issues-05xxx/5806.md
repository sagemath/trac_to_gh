    sage: format_src('<<<Sqsage:')[5:15]

Note that the doctest in the file says `sage: format_src('<<<Sq>>>')[5:15]`.  Why is `>>>` getting changed to `sage:`?

> What I get in sagedoc.py is this: 

[snip] time out failure

I have seen this before, but not repeatably.  I only saw it doing sage -t on the particular file, not when doing sage -testall.  Try `sage -t -verbose`: is it freezing on a `search_src` command?

We can always revert the changes at #5764 if we have to (or at least reinstate the "nodoctest" at the top of the file).

Replying to [ticket:5806 jsp]: 

Can you run this successfully from within Sage:

```
sage: search_doc('this creates a polynomial ring')
```

On the "fetch" tests:  I'm not sure why, but the problem seems to be os.popen, which is deprecated in favor of the subprocess module:

http://docs.python.org/library/subprocess.html

Here's a potential fix:

At the top of `sagedoc.py` add

```
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
```
Then replace

```
r = os.popen(cmd).read()
```
with

```
r = Popen(cmd, shell=True, stdout=PIPE).communicate()[0]
```

There's still an issue with `\n`'s, though.

I apologize for not posting patches.  Did anyone happen to have any success with the changes I suggested?

For the "ring" and "fetch" failures, the general issue seems to be how the doctesting framework interacts with pipes.

I found that pressing Control-C to quit a stalled "fetch" test didn't always quit all of the spawned process(es).  If I didn't kill these, subsequent test runs would usually (always?) pass.  This "explained" the "random" pass/fail behavior.

I figured out the problem: it's the regex stuff, not the symlinks. GNU find demands backslashes in `\(py\|pyx\|pxd\)` unless you specify "-regextype posix-awk"; Apple's find demands that you *not* use backslashes and doesn't understand "-regextype". Kids, this is why daddy drinks.

> I think this is OS specific, and maybe it has to do with the BSD-style find command on Mac OS X.  That is: with just your two patches, all tests pass on sage.math and on another linux box I have access to.  On my Intel Mac running OS X 10.5, I get the error listed above because of the leading slash "/".  Even worse, though, from the notebook interface, the links are broken, again because of the slash.  I think the right thing to do is to strip the leading slash if it's present.  Here's a patch which does that; it passes all tests on sage.math and on my mac.

Ah, perfect. Your patch3 passes doctests and works in the notebook on my own machine (amd64 Ubuntu, so no surprise there since it works on sage.math), and passes doctests on a 32-bit Fedora 10 machine.

I did notice that `search_doc` was not actually searching the documentation...I was a little too quick with cut and paste. I'll upload a new version of the first patch (all I did was change a `'src'` to `'doc'`). Now we need to get someone to review this.

If we've released for 2 months without fixing this, it doesn't make sense to keep it as a blocker.

Works for me on several different linux boxes as well as Mac OS X 10.5 (intel).  Apply all three patches.

(I wrote one of the three patches, but it's a one-liner, and ddrake approved of it above ("Ah, perfect").  So positive review for the whole thing.)
