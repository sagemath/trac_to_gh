`sage.symbolic.expression.Expression` doesn't support .derivative(), and the interface to .diff() doesn't match the Sage conventions.

attachment:pynac-hash_exception.patch fixes exception handling during hashing in pynac and the problems reported by Nick in comment:2.

I will hold off on doing another pynac release to address this, since I don't know if mhansen made any changes which might be affected.

BTW, another pynac release, 0.1.6 in this case, would introduce circular dependencies in trac. :)

Comments on how to proceed?

This now introduces a circular dependency in trac. I hope this won't cause problems, since all these patches will go in together. Faster reviews in the future may prevent this from happening again.


Note that only:

* attachment:trac_5546-1-pynac_matrix_vector.patch

needs to be applied from this ticket.
