[attachment: pynac-hash_exception.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket5546/pynac-hash_exception.patch.gz) fixes exception handling during hashing in pynac and the problems reported by Nick in [comment:2](#comment:2).

I will hold off on doing another pynac release to address this, since I don't know if mhansen made any changes which might be affected.

BTW, another pynac release, 0.1.6 in this case, would introduce circular dependencies in trac. :)

Comments on how to proceed?

The necessary changes for pynac, i.e., [attachment: pynac-hash_exception.patch,](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket5546/f714254b17b1f111c6fe31661bc7950e.gz) is included in the new package for pynac-0.1.6 at #5777. The doctests in [attachment: 5546_doctests.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket5546/5546_doctests.patch.gz) are also posted in #5777.

This now introduces a circular dependency in trac. I hope this won't cause problems, since all these patches will go in together. Faster reviews in the future may prevent this from happening again.

Some variants of these patches seem to be in 4.0.rc0. This bug should be closed. Trac doesn't allow me to close bugs any more though.
