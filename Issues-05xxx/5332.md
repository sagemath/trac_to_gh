There are some more places, to find them run

```
grep "PolynomialRing" .doctest* | grep objgen
```
in $SAGE_ROOT/tmp

This is horrible

```
R.<x,y> = QQ[]
```
(but working, I know).

Please use either

```
sage: R = QQ['x,y']
sage: x,y = R.gens()
```
or the shorter

```
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ['x,y']
```

Having something implicit in the right hand side of this declaration is really bad. Don't you think?

I agree with Marc, I clearly see `sage: R.<x,y> = QQ['x,y']` as a repetition. And I honestly do not see the problem with `sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]`: one is simply saying "*I define the polynomial ring over QQ with 2 variables, and I use the Python `x` and `y` to denote its generators. I let Sage choose the way it represents graphically these generators*". And then, of course it is quite nice that the default choice is to use the string `"x"` for `x` and the string `"y"` for `y`. 

Otherwise stated, I like in the notation `sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]` the fact that I simply define the object and not the way it is printed.

Number field

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2 - 2)
```
Finite fields

```
sage: K.<a> = GF(3^5)
```
Power series

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[[]]
```
Dirichlet group

```
sage: G.<e> = DirichletGroup(20)
```
There are more or less a dozen of files (including `sage/schemes` and `sage/modular`).

I agree that the method is useful on number fields, polynomial rings, power series. But at the level of category objects or parent?

Vincent

PS: Not speaking about the fact that

```
K = NumberField(x^2 - 2, 'a')
a = K.gen()
```
is faster, less cryptic and more economic in characters than

```
K,a = NumberField(x^2-2,'a').objgen()
```

Yes, why not. To be honest I made the changes here because I stumbled upon this ticket and thought it would take five minutes and make one years-old open ticket less, but I don't really care about the problem.

> I agree that the method is useful on number fields, polynomial rings, power series. But at the level of category objects or parent?

Okay, I misunderstood, sorry. I don't know.

I actually tend to find the latter more readable, mostly because it only takes one line.

I pushed a small fix to your fix (not tested, I'm having trouble with my development build at the moment).

One more comment: exemples like `A, z = R.poly_ring().objgen()` are typical cases where I would have kept the `objgens` version. But I have no problem with your version, do as you prefer.

If you are okay with my commits and assuming all tests pass, please feel free to set the ticket to positive review.
