Yeah, its just old and noone got around cleaning that up.

There are some more places, to find them run

```
grep "PolynomialRing" .doctest* | grep objgen
```
in $SAGE_ROOT/tmp

This is horrible

```
R.<x,y> = QQ[]
```
(but working, I know).

Please use either

```
sage: R = QQ['x,y']
sage: x,y = R.gens()
```
or the shorter

```
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ['x,y']
```

Having something implicit in the right hand side of this declaration is really bad. Don't you think?

Vincent

No `:-)`. At least, less so that repeating the name when the intention is to have the variable name match the identifier. Also, that's both the style the ticket description suggests and a very common choice in existing sage documentation.

This is one more thing that induces confusion between Python variables and mathematical variables (not worse than `var(x)` though). It is not a repetition as the semantic are very different.

I agree with Marc, I clearly see `sage: R.<x,y> = QQ['x,y']` as a repetition. And I honestly do not see the problem with `sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]`: one is simply saying "*I define the polynomial ring over QQ with 2 variables, and I use the Python `x` and `y` to denote its generators. I let Sage choose the way it represents graphically these generators*". And then, of course it is quite nice that the default choice is to use the string `"x"` for `x` and the string `"y"` for `y`. 

Otherwise stated, I like in the notation `sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]` the fact that I simply define the object and not the way it is printed.

Number field

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2 - 2)
```
Finite fields

```
sage: K.<a> = GF(3^5)
```
Power series

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[[]]
```
Dirichlet group

```
sage: G.<e> = DirichletGroup(20)
```
There are more or less a dozen of files (including `sage/schemes` and `sage/modular`).

I agree that the method is useful on number fields, polynomial rings, power series. But at the level of category objects or parent?

Vincent

PS: Not speaking about the fact that

```
K = NumberField(x^2 - 2, 'a')
a = K.gen()
```
is faster, less cryptic and more economic in characters than

```
K,a = NumberField(x^2-2,'a').objgen()
```
