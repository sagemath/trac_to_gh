I'm going to upload a patch which corrects a bunch of typos and formatting bits. I do have a couple comments:

* you need a blank line between `EXAMPLES::}} (or {{{TEST::`) and the first line of the doctest; otherwise, the documentation doesn't get typeset correctly.
* doing <code>\`M\"obius\`</code> doesn't work; it automatically uses LaTeX in math mode, and gets messed up. For now I just removed the backticks.

I don't have time for this now, but it would be nice to add cross-references: you can do stuff like "<code>...see :func:\`coolfunction()\` for...</code>" and get automatically linked cross-references.

Finally, this does raise coverage to (basically) 100% and passes all doctests. I'm glad to see this!

It seems that you are somehow typesetting the documentation. How do you do this? That would obviously make it easier for me to catch these mistakes.

Do `sage -docbuild reference html` to build the html reference manual, and `sage -docbuild reference pdf` to make the LaTeX PDF version. The reference manual pulls in all the docstrings from the Sage library. The output will be in `$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/doc/output/` and look in the html or pdf directories. You can also create the developer's guide, installation guide, and a bunch of other stuff by replacing "reference" with "developer", "installation", "constructions", and others.

For the PDF version, there is no way to do this right now, as far as I know.  For the html version, once you've built it once for a particular branch, the next time it will only rebuild the files which have changed.

Yes and no.  For the PDF version, there is no way to do this right now, as far as I know.  For the html version, once you've built it once for a particular branch, the next time it will only rebuild the files which have changed.  If you install the patch at #5653, you can also view the html output for individual functions from the notebook by typing `function?`.
