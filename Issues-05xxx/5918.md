I'll post a patch in a few minutes that brings the doctest coverage for posets to 100% (well, except for 2 or 3 nested functions). It also fixes a few bugs that I noticed while adding the doctests.

It seems that you are somehow typesetting the documentation. How do you do this? That would obviously make it easier for me to catch these mistakes.

The reference manual pulls in all the docstrings from the Sage library. The output will be in `$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/doc/output/` and look in the html or pdf directories.

Thanks for this answer. This seems to take a while. Is there a way to build just part of the manual? I'm thinking of something along the lines `sage -docbuild posets.py`.

For the PDF version, there is no way to do this right now, as far as I know.  For the html version, once you've built it once for a particular branch, the next time it will only rebuild the files which have changed.  If you install the patch at #5653, you can also view the html output for individual functions from the notebook by typing `function?`.",
