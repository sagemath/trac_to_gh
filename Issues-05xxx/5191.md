This is a followup to #5023: Paul Zimmermann reports:

```
sage: a=tanh(2)
sage: a._algebraic_(QQbar)
...
TypeError: Unable to coerce e (<class 'sage.functions.constants.E'>) to Rational
```

Carl: If this is invalid just close the ticker as invalid.

Cheers,

Michael

<a id='comment:1'>Comment 1:</a>
QQbar(sinh(2)) fails with the above error message; I believe that sinh(2) is not algebraic, so the conversion must fail, although I suppose the error message could be nicer.

However, QQbar(sinh(log(2))) correctly returns 3/4, so the code does work.  Therefore, I'm marking this invalid.
