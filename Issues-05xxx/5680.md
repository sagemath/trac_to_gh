Now that FLINT 1.2.4 is in Sage we should hook up various new methods:

* factor
* square free factoring
* derivative
* powermod

With Sage 4.2.alpha1, I get the following failures:

```
        sage -t -long devel/sage-main/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/padics.py # 18 doctests failed
        sage -t -long devel/sage-main/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/sha_tate.py # 15 doctests failed

Also, in squarefree_decomposition, there is an "EXAMPLES:" that needs to be "EXAMPLES::".

Oops, I hadn't run doctests on `schemes`, and it was a genuine bug with scalar multiplication.

New patch attachment:trac_5680-flint_zmod_poly_enhancements.take2.patch should fix all problems.
