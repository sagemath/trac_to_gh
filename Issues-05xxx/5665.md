```
In class ShrinkingGeneratorCipher, function `__call__` the initialization and update of the initial states is buggy. Namely in the peace of code

```
g1 = e1.connection_polynomial()
n1 = g1.degree()
IS_1 = e1.initial_state()
g2 = e2.connection_polynomial()
n2 = g2.degree()
IS_2 = e1.initial_state()
```
the last line 'IS_2 = e1.initial_state()' should be 'IS_2 = e2.initial_state()'. 
Also at the end in

```
  IS_1 = KStream[r-n-1:r-n+n1]
  IS_2 = KStream[r-n-1:r-n+n2]
```
the last line should be 'IS_2 = DStream[r-n-1:r-n+n2]'
The corrected file is attached.

**Assignee:** kohel

On top of this someone needs to make a proper patch out of this and check in the changes in sbulygin's name. One would also need to check if doctests have been added since that is unclear to me without taking a closer look and comparing to the file that is in 3.4.1.

Maybe I shouldn't have clicked on 'fixed' (although the two changes fix the problem). This indeed told me that the ticket would then be set to closed. 

Creating a patch seems overkill, since only two characters have changed (1->2 and K->D).  

However, you are correct about the doctests; it looks like the ciphertext in line 229 will have to be substituted with the new output.

Well, a fixed ticket no longer appears on the default view and just because someone does give a ticket a positive review does not mean it will be merged since any doctest failure will bounce the ticket right back. Closing tickets once a patch has been merged is the only sane way to keep track of which fix was merged in Sage.

No, creating a patch is essential for credit, etc. 

> However, you are correct about the doctests; it looks like the ciphertext in line 229 will have to be substituted with the new output. 


It is essential to run doctests and to add additional doctests in case the problem was not previously covered by a doctest. This does not seem to be the case here, but I will find out in the morning.
