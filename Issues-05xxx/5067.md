When doing #4588 to fix some "doctests never got run" stuff, I discovered exactly one case of some wrong non-optional doctests that weren't being run. 

They are in linear_code.py:

Applies cleanly to 3.3.alpha1 and all tests pass. I also looked at the code and the patch. It looks like a more concise revision of the original code and a (presumably more intelligent) revision of the process of opening and closing files which you have to read+write to for Leon's binaries.

Thanks Robert!
