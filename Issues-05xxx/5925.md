- Treat the case where _multiply_basis returns a monomial specially, to avoid creating lots of temporary dictionaries.  Speeds things up significantly.


- Use z_elt.get(m,ABRzero) to provide a default value.  Faster.


- Pull left_c * right_c out of inner loop.  Didn't time this, but it must be faster.


- Replace first use of BR with ABR so that BR isn't used twice in the same function for different rings.


- Add doctests so the four major cases are all tested locally.

I'm happy to rebase if needed.

Timing test on 2.2GHz Core2Duo running 32-bit Ubuntu 8.04:

Y=[[1,2,3,4],[5,6]]
time eY=e(Y)
time eY2=eY*eY

The second time is the one I'm looking to improve.

Before patch:

Time: CPU 0.56 s, Wall: 0.75 s
Time: CPU 1.93 s, Wall: 1.93 s

After patch:

Time: CPU 0.56 s, Wall: 0.75 s
Time: CPU 1.61 s, Wall: 1.61 s

I tested each change separately, and each showed an improvement in the
second time.

Hi Dan,

two things:

* make sure to assign a milestone to each ticket when you open it. In most cases it should be the next release.
* please add yourself to the account listing at http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/wiki

Cheers,

Michael

Hi Dan. I'm showcasing the feature of this ticket in the release tour. The above code doesn't look sensible to me, since `time eY=e(Y)` results in a `ValueError` under Sage 4.0 and 4.0.1.

Why the hell was sage-combinat not in CC to that one?

This change should have gone through the Sage-Combinat server to merge with the changes there.
Besides CombinatorialAlgebra is deprecated.

Now I get one more conflict to handle.

(anyone complaining about our changes in Sage-Combinat not going into Sage quickly enough is welcome to give a hand
on the review process for #5891).

I think Dan (djc) is new to Sage, and I don't know that there's any information anywhere saying that all changes to combinatorics must pass through sage-combinat, or that this is even the policy. I agree it's frustrating, but I don't think Dan is at fault at all. This was probably an overly harsh reply ... so Dan, please don't take it personally, since I'm sure Nicolas didn't intend that. `:)`

On a related note, I agree that it would be nice if all combinatorics trac tickets got automatically cc'd to sage-combinat, or a separate sage-combinat-trac mailing list.

> Hi Nicolas,
> I think Dan (djc) is new to Sage, and I don't know that there's any information anywhere saying that all changes to combinatorics must pass through sage-combinat, or that this is even the policy. I agree it's frustrating, but I don't think Dan is at fault at all. This was probably an overly harsh reply ... so Dan, please don't take it personally, since I'm sure Nicolas didn't intend that. `:)`

Yes, thanks Craig for pointing this out. 

Sorry Dan: My comment was absolutely not targeting you. I definitely appreciate your contribution, and I very much hope to hear from you soon about other parts of the combinat code!

Well, the point is not to find a culprit. But, with the current pile of patches, the Sage-Combinat server is getting really hard to maintain. So please all be careful (or step to up to maintain it). Thanks!
