A bunch of typos found in Sage 3.3 library files, in particular files under the following directories:


* sage/algebras
* sage/calculus
* sage/coding
* sage/combinat
* sage/crypto
* sage/databases

The typos are fairly trivial to review.

Hi Minh,

the timing of these patches is rather unfortunate since they are against the old codebase without the ReST patches. Since that patches have preference about anything else two thing can happen:

* Mike Hansen integrates the fixes into the ReST patch set
* someone will need to rebase these patches for Sage 3.4.1.

Cheers,

Michael

Leave the attached fixes as is and don't integrate them into 3.4.
