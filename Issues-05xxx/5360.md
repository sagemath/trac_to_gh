## File: sage/server/introspect.py

* Some pairs of single quote are transformed to double quote

```
- sage: nb.add_user('Mark','password','',force=True) 
+ sage: nb.add_user('Mark','password',",force=True)
```

```
- sage: C = sage.server.notebook.cell.Cell(0, 'plot(sin(x),0,5)', '', W) 
+ sage: C = sage.server.notebook.cell.Cell(0, 'plot(sin(x),0,5)', ", W) 
```
It looks like a bad Idea...

I probably miss some so that a systematic replace `,",` by `,'',` should solve the problem.    


* Also in edit_text. the transformation

```
Returns a plain-text version of the worksheet with \{\{\{\}\}\} wiki-formatting,
```
into 

```
Returns a plain-text version of the worksheet with {{{}}} 
```
looks suspicious to me. 

* function edit_save: lost ` {{{` }}}:

```
ignore_ids -- bool (default: False); if True ignore all the 
              id's in the {{{}}} code block. 
```
is now:

```
-  ``ignore_ids`` - bool (default: False); if True 
   ignore all the id's in the code block. 
```

The attached patch
* Converts `, ",` to `, '',` for in `sage.server.*` dosctrings.
* Fixes the `ignore_ids` omission mentioned above.  I don't know if there are other instances of this problem.

Are there other problems?  Actually, yes.  See the next patch, which

* Adds a few modules to `notebook.rst`.
* Cleans up `interact.py`'s docstrings so they display nicely in the reference manual and notebook.
* Cleans up, e.g., `EXAMPLES:`, in a few other modules.
* Edits some modules' title strings.

Feel free to make further changes.
