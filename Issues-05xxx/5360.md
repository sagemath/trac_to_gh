## File: sage/server/introspect.py

* Some pairs of single quote are transformed to double quote

```
- sage: nb.add_user('Mark','password','',force=True) 
+ sage: nb.add_user('Mark','password',",force=True)
```

```
- sage: C = sage.server.notebook.cell.Cell(0, 'plot(sin(x),0,5)', '', W) 
+ sage: C = sage.server.notebook.cell.Cell(0, 'plot(sin(x),0,5)', ", W) 
```
It looks like a bad Idea...

I probably miss some so that a systematic replace `,",` by `,'',` should solve the problem.    


* Also in edit_text. the transformation

```
Returns a plain-text version of the worksheet with \{\{\{\}\}\} wiki-formatting,
```
into 

```
Returns a plain-text version of the worksheet with {{{}}} 
```
looks suspicious to me. 

* function edit_save: lost ` {{{` }}}:

```
ignore_ids -- bool (default: False); if True ignore all the 
              id's in the {{{}}} code block. 
```
is now:

```
-  ``ignore_ids`` - bool (default: False); if True 
   ignore all the id's in the code block. 
```
