Using the PARI kernel algorithm returns a PARI object which is unpacked as a list with the rows given as tuples.  When this is passed to hermite_form() the object is not of the right type.

```
sage: a = matrix(ZZ, [[1,2],[2,4]])
sage: a.kernel(algorithm='pari')

Replying to [rbeezer](#comment%3A1):

matrix_dense_integer._kernel_gens_using_pari() now returns a matrix, when it previously returned a list of tuples, which always caused the calling routine (kernel_matrix) to choke.  Two comments:

1.  I may change the name of this routine as part of http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/5381

2.  I've tried to be careful about sending back an empty matrix with the right dimensions when the matrix has full rank.  I suspect there are other places that could use changes like this.

Apply this patch before http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/5381

Review: Looks good, applies ok to 3.4.alpha0 and tests in sage/matrix (plus a whole lot of other random kernel tests I did) pass fine.
