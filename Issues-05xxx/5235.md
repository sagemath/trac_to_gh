No longer far from certain. The build completed without ANY problems, 
including getting past gnutls without error. This is not unprecedented 
but somewhat surprising nevertheless. Running make test now.

AFS seems to be commonly used with RHEL 4 in some instituations. It has come up twice now.

This will work unless somebody very foolishly changed the afs mount 
point to something other that /afs. 
[[ $(pwd | cut -d'/' -f2) = 'afs' ]] && echo "we are in afs" 
```

Should anyone want to do this, Sun's `struct stat` has a `st_fstype` field which gives the filesystem type of a file, so from C this might be easy to check.
