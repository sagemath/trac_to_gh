Right at the top overview of graph theory the ref manual has the line

```
sage: graphs_query.[tab]             # not tested
```

http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/sage/graphs/graph.html

If it isn't tested it's broken, and that's the case here, since there is no graphs_query object available on the Sage command line.
