<div id="comment:3" align="right">Comment 3</div>

This is due to GAP's default behaviour, which is to truncate output that it deems too long to print.  In this particular case, the generators of the Sylow subgroup are *huge* permutations, so GAP gets bored and sticks in a [...] at some point.

This could potentially come up in other situations in dealing with the GAP interface.

No, it wasn't. I waited for answers in [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/8499ccf849b7833a/2c3678a00cd47447?show_docid=2c3678a00cd47447&pli=1) since one of the patchbots produced a "failed".
