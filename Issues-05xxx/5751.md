In connection with #5729 this makes cartan_type a method rather than attribute in weyl_characters.py.

See http://groups.google.com/group/sage-combinat-devel/msg/a250953d9a8000f8?hl=en

See cartan_type now a method rather than attribute in weyl_characters.py

But this patch has a minor conflict with #5721 which is the more important of the two
patches. So let us get #5721 merged first. Then I will revise the patch.
