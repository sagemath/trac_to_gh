The code at #5093 is very good and ready to go in, but there are several improvements that have been suggested and agreed work on at a later date. They are posted here so we can merge and close the other ticket. 

Specifically, this ticket addresses these issues:

* `fast_callable` on `list`, `tuple`, `vector`, `matrix` arguments

* `fast_callable` on constant arguments

* `fast_callable` of a zero multivariate polynomial returns a zero of the base ring, without paying attention to the types of the arguments

* in general replaces calls to `fast_float` with calls to `fast_callable`. 

* Carries out the deprecation in #5413 (removes the functionality deprecated there)

* `fast_float` sometimes returns symbolic values instead of floating-point values (see #17684, which patches `density_plot` to work around this bug)


Because of some of the far-reaching changes, this should probably not be merged in a point-point release.

What is not fixed:

* Robert's suggestion: an option that uses a fast domain, if it's there, but ignores the domain parameter if it's not (I don't mind the idea, and the implementation is easy; what should the syntax be? Part of my problem picking a syntax is that I don't want to promise that a specialized interpreter is always faster than the Python-object interpreter, so I don't particularly want to use the word "fast" in any option names.)





The work on this ticket:

* Makes #8450 easy, probably
* Makes #7512 invalid, probably

See also
* #10087
* #7165
* #11766 -- rewrite some of `fast_callable` to have its own recursion stack

More fast_callable improvements:

* domain=float is the same as domain=RDF, but domain=complex is not the same as domain=CDF.  Make domain=complex use the same interpreter as domain=CDF

* if g is a callable expression, then fast_callable(g) should use g.args() for the variables, not g.variables().  Hmm...or maybe return an error if g.args() is not equal to g.variables(), since every variable really does have to be satisfied.

**Attachment:** [improve_fast_callable.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket5572/improve_fast_callable.patch.gz)

This is a big patch to fast_callable which 

* makes it work for lists/tuples like fast_float does
* adds lots of `_fast_callable_` methods to make it work on a lot of different constant objects (integers/rationals/RDF/RR/CDF/CC)
* refactors the code a bit
* in general replaces calls to fast_float with calls to fast_callable.
 
The patch also breaks some things---it's still a work in progress.

timdumol since he's expressed interest in working on this sort of thing.

The two patches need work at this point.  In particular, the improvements patch needs docs added/changed, and ptestlong needs to be run to check for breakage.

The complex number patch needs an overhaul, as I think it's completely broken at this point.  The complex number patch is not necessary for resolving the issues on this ticket.

To delete the fast_eval.so file from the build directory (necessary so that the cython fast_eval is eliminated when testing), do:

```
cd $SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/build
find . -name fast_eval.so | xargs rm
```

 Specifically, this ticket addresses these issues:
 
-* fast_callable on list,tuple,vector,matrix arguments
+* `fast_callable` on `list`, `tuple`, `vector`, `matrix` arguments
 
-* fast_callable on constant arguments
+* `fast_callable` on constant arguments
 
-* fast_callable of a zero multivariate polynomial returns a zero of the base ring, without paying attention to the types of the arguments
+* `fast_callable` of a zero multivariate polynomial returns a zero of the base ring, without paying attention to the types of the arguments
 
-* in general replaces calls to fast_float with calls to fast_callable. 
+* in general replaces calls to `fast_float` with calls to `fast_callable`. 
 
 * Carries out the deprecation in #5413 (removes the functionality deprecated there)
+
+* `fast_float` sometimes returns symbolic values instead of floating-point values (see #17684, which patches `density_plot` to work around this bug)
+
 
 Because of some of the far-reaching changes, this should probably not be merged in a point-point release.
