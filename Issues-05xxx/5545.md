To reproduce: Start with Sage 3.4.  Apply the attached patch (dependency-tracker-bug-testcase.patch).  Rebuild with "sage -b", then run Sage.  Type:

```
sage: import sage.rings.polynomial.real_roots
```
You will get an error:

```
TypeError: sage.rings.real_mpfi.RealIntervalField is not a type object
```
But if you touch real_roots.pyx and rebuild, the error goes away.

So somehow real_roots.pyx depends on real_mpfi.pyx in a way that the dependency tracker doesn't catch.  (It's not obvious how, because real_roots.pyx never even mentions `mpfi`.)
