Sage requires both pseudoterminals (for pexpect) and shared memory (for pyprocessing semaphores). On modern linux, those are implemented via special filesystem mounts:
- `/dev/pts` for pseudoterminals (of type `devpts`)
- `/dev/shm` for shared memory (of type `tmpfs`)
A normal system has those mounts active. However, running sage in a chroot fails in weird ways if we neglect to mount those inside the chroot:
- the first one makes pexpect interfaces to fail, e.g.:

```
sage: gap(2)
A workspace appears to have been corrupted... automatically rebuilding (this is harmless).

- the second one makes pyprocessing to fail, which can be reproduced by:

```

sage: processing._processing.SemLock(processing.synchronize.BOUNDED_SEMAPHORE, 1)

Wherever the check for, e.g. sage-flags.txt is done, i.e. at startup. The idea is to make sure that those two features are available, because they are actually required by Sage, and if they are missing the error messages tend to be very confusing (see the description for a taste).

Note that this actually happens at least when one does a quick chroot and doesn't mount either /dev/pts and /dev/shm.

Just to record the relative importance of the two: pseudottys are absolutely required for sage (pexpect), while shared memory seems to be only used through pyprocessing, i.e. maybe only dsage needs it.

I think this looks good. I've added a patch above that calls this script from the sage startup, as Gonzalo suggested. So I guess I'm positively reviewing Gonzalo's code, but maybe someone should rubber-stamp the code I added that calls it.

However, it just occurred to me that we're switching to python 2.6 in the next release -- and that means we need to switch to `multiprocessing` instead of `processing`. I just read the documentation for `multiprocessing` online, and I believe that checking that semaphores are available will be even easier -- according to the first warning on this page:

all we need to do is `import multiprocessing.synchronize`, and it'll fail if not. 

So as soon as an alpha is out with the new python spkg in place, I'll go ahead and update this patch -- it should probably wait to be merged until then, but people are welcome to try it out now and offer other comments.

Two years later, I've attached an updated Python script. :)

Note that meanwhile also `sage -b` (i.e., `devel/sage/setup.py`) uses semaphores (because it builds the Sage library in parallel by default), which means now Sage also **won't build** without them.

At least for binary distributions, we should add some check (perhaps calling the attached script) to some start-up script, but please **not** `sage-env` (since that's used by a lot of scripts that simply don't need such a check).

Attachment [sage-check-ptys-semaphore.py](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket5965/sage-check-ptys-semaphore.py) by @nexttime created at 2011-08-29 01:31:10

Raising the priority to "critical" since this issue came up multiple times recently, especially in server setups (which usually use a chroot environment or virtualization), and also minimal Linux installations.

People are rather unlikely to immediately relate the failure in starting GAP to pseudo ttys or device mounts.

Alternatively, we could catch / check for the pty error in the code that creates PExpect interfaces, e.g. in `sage/interfaces/gap.py` (around line 903), in order to give a more appropriate error message.

They were accidentally left out of a chroot in the original report. Catching them at `./configure` just saves a lot of time, since otherwise you go through the whole build and get an incomprehensible test failure a few hours later.

My main question is, do these things still depend on `/dev/pts` and `/dev/shm` at all? A lot can change in 11 years. And if it's pexpect/pyprocessing that are trying to use them, then it might make more sense to send this check upstream.
