Here is an illustration:

```
sage: v = vector({1: 1, 3: -1})
sage: w = vector({1: -1, 3: 0})
sage: v
(0, 1, 0, -1)
sage: w
(0, -1, 0, 0)
sage: v+w
(0, 0, 0, -1)
sage: (v+w).nonzero_positions()
[1, 3]
```
(I don't think this is related to #4648.  nonzero_positions for sums of sparse matrices seems to behave well in the one example I tried.)

No, they're not related.  I'm putting the "is_zero" issue into #5185.  This ticket should only deal with nonzero_positions.

**Attachment:** [5184.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket5184/5184.patch)

Instead of tests like `if a != 0:`, it should use `if a:`.   The code is a little uglier and harder to understand, but it's much faster; these are approximations of the sorts of timing differences you would see:

```
sage: foo = QQbar(3)
sage: timeit('bool(foo)')
625 loops, best of 3: 1.24 µs per loop
sage: timeit('foo != 0r')
625 loops, best of 3: 100 µs per loop
sage: foo = 3
sage: timeit('bool(foo)')
625 loops, best of 3: 286 ns per loop
sage: timeit('foo != 0r')
625 loops, best of 3: 4.2 µs per loop
```

(Also, in the places where you deleted "A dense a sparse", is it worth adding a note that says something like "(This is true even if one is sparse and the other is dense.)"?)
