<div id="comment:0"></div>

I have code that does the same as

```
RestrictedPartitions(3000, [1000, 500, 100, 50, 10])
```
but about 5.5 times faster...and on my system,

```
RestrictedPartitions(5000, [1000, 500, 100, 50, 10])
```
uses over two gigabytes of memory, whereas my code takes about 9.2 seconds with minimal memory usage.

I need to fiddle with my code so that it's a drop-in replacement for RestrictedPartitions, but I should have a patch up soon.

Anyone reviewing this might want to look at my test script: [restricted_partitions_test_suite.sage](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/drake/restricted_partitions_test_suite.sage). I've run over 10,000 successful tests with it.

This script is great. I should be put in sage in one place or one other. If someone tries to optimize your code (eg: Cythonize), he surely will be happy to have your test code. Why not shipping it into the patch with a more explicit name and a one-line example on how to use it with the comment " #longtest " ?

Some comment on the first patch:

I'm not a native English speaker but it seems to me that 
  If ``starting=p`` is passed, then the combinatorial class of partitions greater than or equal to `p` in lexicographic order is returned. 
is clearer if phrased
  If ``starting=p`` is passed, then the combinatorial class of partitions with part greater than or equal to `p` in lexicographic order is returned. 

In the same way
  If ``ending=p`` is passed, then the combinatorial class of partitions at most `p` in lexicographic order is returned. 
is better phrased
  If ``ending=p`` is passed, then the combinatorial class of partitions with part at most `p` in lexicographic order is returned.

Otherwise the rest of the first patch looks good. I'm working on the second one.

"p" refers to a partition, not to a part, so the text is okay. Perhaps we should make that more clear, though. I plan on opening a ticket to improve the documentation in partition.py, so we can do that then.

Well, right now, the script only halts if it finds an error, so it would be a really, really long test. :)

The tests also can use lots of memory, since it puts a list of the partitions into memory. But if anyone thinks (a mildly modified version of) the script should get run on a "long" test, I'm happy to have it included.
