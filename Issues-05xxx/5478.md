```
I have code that does the same as

```
RestrictedPartitions(3000, [1000, 500, 100, 50, 10])
```
but about 5.5 times faster...and on my system,

```
RestrictedPartitions(5000, [1000, 500, 100, 50, 10])
```
uses over two gigabytes of memory, whereas my code takes about 9.2 seconds with minimal memory usage.

I need to fiddle with my code so that it's a drop-in replacement for RestrictedPartitions, but I should have a patch up soon.

Some comment on the first patch:

I'm not a native English speaker but it seems to me that 
  If ``starting=p`` is passed, then the combinatorial class of partitions greater than or equal to `p` in lexicographic order is returned. 
is clearer if phrased
  If ``starting=p`` is passed, then the combinatorial class of partitions with part greater than or equal to `p` in lexicographic order is returned. 

In the same way
  If ``ending=p`` is passed, then the combinatorial class of partitions at most `p` in lexicographic order is returned. 
is better phrased
  If ``ending=p`` is passed, then the combinatorial class of partitions with part at most `p` in lexicographic order is returned.

Otherwise the rest of the first patch looks good. I'm working on the second one.

"p" refers to a partition, not to a part, so the text is okay. Perhaps we should make that more clear, though. I plan on opening a ticket to improve the documentation in partition.py, so we can do that then.

Well, right now, the script only halts if it finds an error, so it would be a really, really long test. :)

The tests also can use lots of memory, since it puts a list of the partitions into memory. But if anyone thinks (a mildly modified version of) the script should get run on a "long" test, I'm happy to have it included.

**Attachment:** [trac_5478-review.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket5478/trac_5478-review.patch)

The patch looks good. The doctests passed except that depending on the base the doctests numbers may differ. So I added a review patch which replace the explicit doctest numbers with `...`. This should solve this problem. 

I'm giving a positive review... Though maybe someone should reread my trivial review patch. 

Concerning the script it is quite redundant with the .check() method we'll have with categories.

Thanks for fixing up those line numbers in the doctests...I struggled a bit to get those right, and had forgotten about the "..." stuff.
