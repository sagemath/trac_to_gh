Hi Jeroen,

Thanks for pointing that #10227 is still awaiting for review. 

One question concerning sage-wait: if someone (eg: me this week end if I find the time) review #10227, am I supposed to change the milestone of this one ? 

Florent

I would say: yes, you can do that, at least if you are sufficient familiar with *this* ticket to be sure that there is no further obstruction.
