The attached patch splits up the code for congruence subgroups into several files in a directory sage/modular/congroups. The old file sage/modular/congroup.py still exists, so pickles created with previous versions should unpickle safely under the new one.

I've added a little functionality in the process: congruence subgroups can now calculate the width and regularity of their cusps, and their number of elliptic points.

I've rebased this patch against 3.4 and added loads of new functionality. Chris Kurth has given permission for his KFarey package to be incorporated into Sage, and I've started by incorporating the permutation machinery, which gives a way of representing and working with arbitrary finite index subgroups of SL2Z.

Here is a sample (taken from the docstring of one of my new files):

```
sage: a2 = SymmetricGroup(7)([(1,2),(3,4),(5,6)]); a3 = SymmetricGroup(7)([(1,3,5),(2,6,7)])
sage: G = ArithmeticSubgroup_Permutation(a2*a3, ~a2 * ~a3); G
Arithmetic subgroup corresponding to permutations L=(1,6)(2,3,4,5,7), R=(1,7,6,3,4)(2,5)
sage: G.index()
7
sage: G.dimension_cusp_forms(4)
1
sage: G.is_congruence()
False
```

I've also moved most of the dimension-formula code out of sage/modular/dims.py into methods of congruence subgroup objects. Given how tangled the original version was, I consider that an improvement. (Let it suffice to say that there were two separate functions in that file which both calculated the index of Gamma0(N) in SL2Z in essentially the same way.) 

Farey symbols, optimal generators, etc can follow in a later patch if people are interested.

(John and Craig: I'm quite keen to get this merged in quickly, as it changes just about every file in sage/modular and so is extremely vulnerable to bitrotting -- any chance either of you could take a look at this?)

David

Looks good to me.

I did a complete "MAKE testlong" on a Sage 3.4.1.alpha0 with these patches, and the only doctest failure was the unrelated "number_field_ideal_rel.py" one, which was expected.

Between 3.4 and 3.4.1.alpha0 one file (congroup.py) changed marginally. In order to make these patches apply cleanly, please apply the four-liner "5180-patch0.patch" first, and only then the other (3.4 based) three patches.

This patch causes three doctest failures in

	sage -t  devel/sage/sage/modular/quatalg/brandt.py # 7 doctests failed
	sage -t  devel/sage/doc/en/bordeaux_2008/modular_forms_and_hecke_operators.rst # 2 doctests failed
	sage -t  devel/sage/doc/en/constructions/modular_forms.rst # 4 doctests failed

You might want to wait for 3.4.1.rc0 since the failure in sage/modular/quatalg/brandt.py in introduced via the patches at #5520.

The doctest fixes were almost trivial, so I did them myself.
Only this last patch of mine remains to be reviewed.

My time before the two weeks Easter vacation runs out, that's why I didn't wait for 3.4.1.rc0. BTW, it seems that "make testlong" does not include running the doctests of the docs? It's reasonable to exclude the "reference doc" from doctesting (or else these doctests would be run through twice), but what about e.g. the "constructions doc"?

Cheers,
