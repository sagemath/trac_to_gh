Note, we'll need an upgraded FLINT for this to work.  Among other things, FLINT exports a global variable named "primes".  And so does PARI.  And they don't play well with eachother.

Also, the attached code contains a bug.  And Factorization objects can be made with less overhead.

What is the plan here? Right now from my end I want to get the latest released upstream into 3.4.2, so it would be nice if you got your code into FLINT and then get Bill to release it. That way the Debian people won't complain ;)

Cheers,

I decided to move `flint_factor` to `fast_arith.pyx`, so it can be used for `int`, too.
To check the improvements use attachment:5945_check_improvements.patch, attachment:5945_check_improvements.sage and

```
(line(values_p)+line(values_f,color='red')).plot()
(line(values_med_p)+line(values_med_f,color='red')).plot()

Thanks for doing this!

Looking at the source code, the line ``flint_bits = int(FLINT_BITS)`` seems wrong.  You can (and should, I think) simply use FLINT_BITS directly.  Of course, this comment is rather minor.

You should use the variable `flint_depends` in **module_list.py** and

```
SAGE_LOCAL+'include/FLINT/'
```
or

```
SAGE_INC+'FLINT/'
```
instead of

```
SAGE_ROOT+'/local/include/FLINT/'
```

**arith.py**:
remove

```
if proof is None:
    proof = True
```
and let `n.factor` handle `proof=None`.

**integer.pyx**: I suggest using the global default for *proof* in factor()

Change

```
F = [(Integer(f.p[i]), f.exp[i]) for i from 0 <= i < f.num]
```
to

```
F = [(Integer(f.p[i]), int(f.exp[i])) for i from 0 <= i < f.num]
```
then only following doctests fail (otherwise even more would fail, e.g. arith.py):

```
sage/misc/sageinspect.py
sage/structure/factorization.py
```

Hi Andre,

I'm sorry for the earlier patch not including the IntegerFactorization class, I don't know how that happened.  Now, there are three things to do:

- Apply #10211
- Apply either trac_5945.patch or trac_5945-461rc0.patch, depending on the Sage version
- Apply trac_5945_fix.patch

Tom, could you perhaps clean up this ticket and remove all other files that I or we added?

Sebastian

Apply trac_5945_reviewer.patch after trac_5945_fix.patch

Version rc0 reviewed.

Attached trac_5945_reviewer.patch handles doctest failure in *factorization.py*. I only changed the expected result but actually it should be a new test with old result.

*sage/libs/flint/long_extras.pxd* contained `ctypedef struct factor_t:`... twice so I removed one.

Everything else is okay.
