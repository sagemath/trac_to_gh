At the moment, `sage -coverage file.py` complains if `file.py` has no doctests of the form `s == loads(dumps(s))`.  However, it says nothing if there is only one such doctest in `file.py`, independent of how many different classes are defined in that file.

Ideally, we would have a doctest `s == loads(dumps(s))` for every single class.  Thus, we should change `sage -coverage` to detect if there are classes without such doctests and complain about it.
