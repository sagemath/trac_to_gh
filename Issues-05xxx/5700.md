Since #5555 is not part of Sage, strings like \ZZ, \GF{q}, or \QQ in docstrings lead to errors when processing the PDF version of the reference manual (and lead to strings like \ZZ, etc., appearing as is in the html version).  This patch changes \ZZ to \mathbf{Z}, etc.

Does this patch conflict in any way with #5555 or can that patch then be applied later over this one?

Cheers,

Michael

I intended this one as a stopgap -- use it until #5555 is applied (although the code here will work fine whether #5555 is applied or not -- the two are independent).

If #5555 gets into Sage first, then this ticket can be ignored.

Also, #5610 will need to undo the changes in this ticket: part 2 of the patch there contains lots of changes of the sort \mathbf{Z} --> \ZZ, to allow users to choose which style of bold face they want.
