**Note**: 

* This patch depends on #5105 and will not apply otherwise.
* It only applies to 3.4.1 at the moment. There are some whitespace changes in 3.4.2.a0 that will need to be sorted out, but I (Michael) will take care of this even if the patches get a positive review against 3.4.1 only. If someone wants to rebase this is fine by me :)

Added p-adics to the reference manual, 100% doctest coverage, converts p-adics to new coercion model, good ReST compatibility for files up to partway through padic_ZZ_pX_FM_element.pyx (alphabetically), no docbuild errors for files later alphabetically.

I am not reviewing this since I don't feel qualified, I just made sure that the patch applied and passes doctests.

The patch applies and tests pass.

As I cannot view the patch (it is too big) I don't actually know what has changed.  Apparently the files have been restified, but the only way to test that would be to add them to the reference manual and try building.  I started with factory.py as that seemed pretty important.  I found that the file while partially restified on a superficial level was completely broken as far as actually processing it is concerned.  I started correcting it and got to line 430, but it is 2200 lines long and so will take a lot longer.

I suggest that this patch goes in since it is a step in the right direction;  but I don't promise to even get to the end of properly getting the docs for factory.py into the manual, let alone any of the rest (ha ha ) of it.

On the positive side I not the very comprhjensive explanation of the p-adic code in a separate tutorial file which is in the reference manual;  but I think that we do need the individual files (of which there are a large number) in there too.

Ok, could you please made a series of tickets (in case you have clear dependencies and the patches can be layered) then so that one reviewer does not end up with say 1MB total of patches to review on one ticket?

For this ticket it would be nice if you could split the ReST formatting changes from the other fixes because I am happy to review the ReST changes. Then the other new doctests and fixes should go to a followup ticket. 

Cheers,

Michael

First, the patches can't be partially applied and used one at a time. But it is better than one monolithic patch. 

OK, the first two patches (outside-padics and deletions/moving look good). I'm all for a generic_nodes.py rather than a dozen files with three lines in them each (it makes it a lot easier to trace the code for instance). 

I'm most of the way through padic_doctests_1.patch--it looks good for the most part. Lots of the patch is whitespace/line wrapping--it would be nice to be able to filter stuff like this out better for review purposes. There's a fair amount of commenting stuff out/ReSTification as well, and new doctests. The only issues I've found are 

sage/rings/padics/eisenstein_extension_generic.py:97 - typo "extensinos"

sage/rings/padics/factory.py:2323: def krasner_check(poly, prec): always returns True, but comments state that it's really not implemented, which is a bit worrisome.

Some more comments: 

**padic_doctests_2.patch** 

looks good, again, mostly rest/whitespace changes. 

**padic_doctests_3.patch**

* `sage/rings/padics/padic_ZZ_pX_element.pyx:74` extraneous print statements

* `sage/rings/padics/padic_base_generic.py::33`  generic `__reduce__` commented out, should probably be outright deleted if it's not used (do subclasses always override this?)

* `sage/rings/padics/padic_base_generic_element.pyx:43` (nitpicky) I think it's easier to read

  {{{
"%s + O(%s^%s)" % (self.lift(), self.parent().prime(), self.precision_absolute())
}}}

than
   
   {{{
        self.lift().str() + " + O(" + self.parent().prime().str() + "^" + self.precision_absolute().str() + ")"
}}}

Also, something I just noticed (not part of this patch). The functions `_set_to_mpz`, `_set_to_mpq` don't change self (as one would expect) but set the input parameter. Perhaps `_set_mpz_to` or something similar would be better.

I can see why one would want to test it in both places, but it would be better to test with distinct elements. There's probably others, I just get a very deja-vu feeling reading some of these doctests...

How many more files need to be ReSTified? If its more than a one or two, lets defer doing this to a later ticket so we can focus on getting this in. 

Your referee patch looks good too, and does address most of my concerns.

Hah.  On sage.math:

```
sage: from sage.libs.ntl.all import ZZ as ntl_ZZ
sage: ntl_ZZ(4) < 1
True
sage: ntl_ZZ(1) < 4
True
```

On my machine:

```
sage: from sage.libs.ntl.all import ZZ as ntl_ZZ
sage: ntl_ZZ(4) < 1
False
sage: ntl_ZZ(1) < 4
False
```

ntl_ZZ is just comparing types.  I'll change the code to convert to Integers earlier.

I am giving this ticket a positive review in RobertWB's name. It now passes all doctests on sage.math, it applies and builds, so any more concerns should be addressed via followup tickets. Post merge we are definitely in better shape than before and given the size of this patch it seems like a good idea to get this in. With all 8 patches applied:

```
Overall weighted coverage score:  74.4%
Total number of functions:  21967
We need  133 more function to get to 75% coverage.
