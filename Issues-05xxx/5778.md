**Note**:

Added p-adics to the reference manual, 100% doctest coverage, converts p-adics to new coercion model, good ReST compatibility for files up to partway through padic_ZZ_pX_FM_element.pyx (alphabetically), no docbuild errors for files later alphabetically.

The patch applies and tests pass.

As I cannot view the patch (it is too big) I don't actually know what has changed.  Apparently the files have been restified, but the only way to test that would be to add them to the reference manual and try building.  I started with factory.py as that seemed pretty important.  I found that the file while partially restified on a superficial level was completely broken as far as actually processing it is concerned.  I started correcting it and got to line 430, but it is 2200 lines long and so will take a lot longer.

I suggest that this patch goes in since it is a step in the right direction;  but I don't promise to even get to the end of properly getting the docs for factory.py into the manual, let alone any of the rest (ha ha ) of it.

On the positive side I not the very comprhjensive explanation of the p-adic code in a separate tutorial file which is in the reference manual;  but I think that we do need the individual files (of which there are a large number) in there too.

Ok, could you please made a series of tickets (in case you have clear dependencies and the patches can be layered) then so that one reviewer does not end up with say 1MB total of patches to review on one ticket?

For this ticket it would be nice if you could split the ReST formatting changes from the other fixes because I am happy to review the ReST changes. Then the other new doctests and fixes should go to a followup ticket.

<a id='comment:19'>Comment 19:</a>
For the record: This patch is not fully rebased against 3.4.1 yet, but it should be in a couple hours, so no point in attempting to apply it yet. The patch does raise coverage in the total of Sage by 2.1%, so we should really get it into 3.4.2 :)

Cheers,

Michael

There are some more issues with 3.4.2.alpha0, but I can revert the changes from there and just patch them back in after merging padics instead of rebasing the patch :)

One more thing: You credit Genya Zaytman for writing doctests, but AFAIK the person has never been credited for contributing to Sage.

Some more comments: 

**padic_doctests_2.patch** 

looks good, again, mostly rest/whitespace changes. 

**padic_doctests_3.patch**

* `sage/rings/padics/padic_ZZ_pX_element.pyx:74` extraneous print statements

* `sage/rings/padics/padic_base_generic.py::33`  generic `__reduce__` commented out, should probably be outright deleted if it's not used (do subclasses always override this?)

* `sage/rings/padics/padic_base_generic_element.pyx:43` (nitpicky) I think it's easier to read

  ```
  "%s + O(%s^%s)" % (self.lift(), self.parent().prime(), self.precision_absolute())
```

than
   

   ```
        self.lift().str() + " + O(" + self.parent().prime().str() + "^" + self.precision_absolute().str() + ")"
```

Also, something I just noticed (not part of this patch). The functions `_set_to_mpz`, `_set_to_mpq` don't change self (as one would expect) but set the input parameter. Perhaps `_set_mpz_to` or something similar would be better.

2. Continue improving ReST compliance in files after padic_capped_absolute_element.pyx

How many more files need to be ReSTified? If its more than a one or two, lets defer doing this to a later ticket so we can focus on getting this in. 

Your referee patch looks good too, and does address most of my concerns.

About 13 more files need improved ReSTification.

I'll try to diversify the doctests for those functions in a bit.  Right now I'm working on p-adic polynomials though.  :-)

Hah.  On sage.math:

```
sage: from sage.libs.ntl.all import ZZ as ntl_ZZ
sage: ntl_ZZ(4) < 1
True
sage: ntl_ZZ(1) < 4
True
```

On my machine:

```
sage: from sage.libs.ntl.all import ZZ as ntl_ZZ
sage: ntl_ZZ(4) < 1
False
sage: ntl_ZZ(1) < 4
False
```

ntl_ZZ is just comparing types.  I'll change the code to convert to Integers earlier.
