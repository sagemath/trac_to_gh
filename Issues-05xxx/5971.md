When doing Mod(n,0), either there should be a useful error message, or one should get n back.  The following is no good at all -- one shouldn't get an AttributeError, which is surely due to a bug. 

```

Applies fine to 4.1.alpha1 and does what it says.  I like the second doctest.  Unless something goes wrong with docbuild due to the #, all is well.
