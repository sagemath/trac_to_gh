One comment in the `__call__()` method of MPolynomialRing_libsingular states:
 #TODO: We can do this faster without the dict

In fact, we can!

Without the patch, we have the following timings on sage.math:

```
sage: R=PolynomialRing(QQ,5,'x')
sage: S=PolynomialRing(QQ,6,'x')
sage: T=PolynomialRing(QQ,5,'y')
sage: U=PolynomialRing(GF(2),5,'x')
sage: p=R('x0*x1+2*x4+x3*x1^2')^4
sage: timeit('q=S(p)')
625 loops, best of 3: 341 Âµs per loop
sage: timeit('q=T(p)')
625 loops, best of 3: 370 Âµs per loop
sage: timeit('q=U(p)')
625 loops, best of 3: 451 Âµs per loop
```

With the patch, we have

```
sage: timeit('q=S(p)')
625 loops, best of 3: 328 Âµs per loop
sage: timeit('q=T(p)')
625 loops, best of 3: 292 Âµs per loop
sage: timeit('q=U(p)')
625 loops, best of 3: 396 Âµs per loop
```
So, the improvement is small, but it *is* an improvement.

Background: 
 In the original version, if the input of `__call__` is MPolynomial_libsingular, then the `dict()` method of this polynomial was called in order to get the coefficients and exponent vectors. 
 
 In the new version, the underlying libsingular methods are called directly, which is faster. The price to pay is that currRing changes more often. I hope change of currRing is not too expensive (in my examples above, apparently it isn't).

Hi Simon, are you sure that you need all the rChangeCurrRing() business? All functions you are calling *should* be safe without it. This might save a few cycles.

Btw. you improved "conversion" not "coercion". IIRC this is how we call stuff happening in `__call__`.

Other than that the patch looks goog, which version shall I apply the patch agains?

First, I tried it without. But then there was a problem when converting a polynomial over QQ into a polynomial over GF(2) (or the other way around, I don't remember). I found that the line

```
c = co.si2sa(p_GetCoeff(_element, El_ring), El_ring, El_base) 
```
did not work properly (always returning zero when it should return 1). 

Then, in 'coefficients()', I found that 'rChangeCurrRing()' is used. I thought that it might be for a reason, and indeed the conversion works if 'El_ring' is 'currRing'.

But I do agree that it would be nice if it were possible to avoid the ring change.

Ok, I changed the key word...

Ooops, it should be 3.4.1.rc2, I think.
