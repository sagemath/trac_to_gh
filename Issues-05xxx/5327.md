```
sage: S = SupersingularModule(389)
sage: H = S.hecke_matrix(2)
sage: D = DiGraph(H)
sage: P = D.plot()
^CControl-C pressed.  Interrupting Maxima. Please wait a few seconds...
```

Maxima is absolutely not the thing to use here: I see in `graph_plot.py` the use of

```
x = SymbolicVariable('x')
d = SymbolicVariable('d')
```
etc.

Probably my bad for letting that past review.

Component: **graph theory**

Excellent.  I'm glad you were so fast with this and that you (rlm) got to look like Bill Gates doing the demo today instead of me looking like that again at Microsoft!
