```
sage: S = SupersingularModule(389)
sage: H = S.hecke_matrix(2)
sage: D = DiGraph(H)
sage: P = D.plot()
^CControl-C pressed.  Interrupting Maxima. Please wait a few seconds...
```

Maxima is absolutely not the thing to use here: I see in `graph_plot.py` the use of

```
x = SymbolicVariable('x')
d = SymbolicVariable('d')
```
etc.

Probably my bad for letting that past review.

Excellent.  I'm glad you were so fast with this and that you (rlm) got to look like Bill Gates doing the demo today instead of me looking like that again at Microsoft!
