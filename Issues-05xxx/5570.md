In Sage it is not feasable to directly compute the determinant of a 20x20 matrix over Integers(26)!

It is trivial to compute the determinant of an nxn matrix over ZZ when n <= 30 and the entries of the matrix have 2 digits.  That would be the case in your example. Sage wasn't computing your det over ZZ; if it had, then doing that computation would have worked fine.  For example:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage: a = random_matrix(Integers(26), 7)
sage: time a.det()
CPU times: user 0.03 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.03 s
Wall time: 0.05 s
6
sage: a = random_matrix(Integers(26), 8)
sage: time a.det()
CPU times: user 0.15 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.15 s
Wall time: 0.16 s
9
sage: a = random_matrix(Integers(26), 9)
sage: time a.det()
CPU times: user 1.37 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 1.37 s
Wall time: 1.38 s
23
sage: time Integers(26)(a.lift().det())
CPU times: user 0.02 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 0.03 s
Wall time: 0.39 s
23
sage: time Integers(26)(a.lift().det())
CPU times: user 0.00 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.00 s
Wall time: 0.00 s
23
sage: a = random_matrix(Integers(26), 9)
sage: time Integers(26)(a.lift().det())
CPU times: user 0.00 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.00 s
Wall time: 0.00 s
10
sage: a = random_matrix(Integers(26), 30)
sage: time Integers(26)(a.lift().det())
CPU times: user 0.02 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.02 s
Wall time: 0.02 s
20
sage: a = random_matrix(Integers(26), 200)
sage: time Integers(26)(a.lift().det())
CPU times: user 0.30 s, sys: 0.04 s, total: 0.33 s
Wall time: 0.34 s

It would thus be far better for now if Sage were to lift to ZZ, do the det, then reduce again.
For square-free modulus, a multimodular algorithm would of course be even better.

Yes it would.  Even for a dense 200x200 matrix over ZZ/256ZZ it only take 0.35 seconds total time to lift *and* compute the determinant, then reduce the result. 

sage: a = random_matrix(Integers(256), 30)
sage: time Integers(256)(a.lift().det())
CPU times: user 0.01 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.01 s
Wall time: 0.01 s
222
sage: a = random_matrix(Integers(256), 200)
sage: time Integers(256)(a.lift().det())
CPU times: user 0.32 s, sys: 0.04 s, total: 0.35 s

Just out of curiosity, why didn't you try any of the above before writing this email?  :-)

Except it isn't anywhere nearly so bad as you think:

sage: a = random_matrix(Integers(256), 500)
sage: time Integers(256)(a.lift().det())
CPU times: user 3.70 s, sys: 0.49 s, total: 4.19 s
Wall time: 4.04 s
188
sage: a = random_matrix(Integers(2^20), 500)
sage: time Integers(256)(a.lift().det())
CPU times: user 7.23 s, sys: 0.81 s, total: 8.04 s
Wall time: 7.94 s
208

All timings above on my 2GB of RAM Macbook laptop.
