The French tutorial doesn't specify a license; to go along with all the other documentation, I think it should have a Creative Commons Attribution-Sharealike license.

Hi,

I am one of the translators of the tutorial. I have just noticed that the French translation was added to the Sage repository by Mike Hansen... a few days before we put its proofread version on the wiki!

So I guess the best I can do now is to provide one single patch which updates the translation and fixes all the issues with it I am aware of, namely this ticket, #4318 and #5337. There had been a few changes (limited to the doctests and the build scripts) in the version of the French tutorial in the hg repository in the meantime; I have done my best to merge them with our work.

Oops, I just found that the tutorial doesn't pass doctests...mostly because the doctest framework doesn't speak French, so if you have "`# nécessite le paquet facultatif database_gap`", it doesn't understand that you mean "`optional - database_gap`". :)

You just need the magic (English) words, so you can still include explanation in French. Things like this work fine:

```
some code # sortie plus ou moins aléatoire (random)

more code # nécessite le paquet facultatif database_gap (optional)
```

I added the necessary English words to the doctests, and also added "..." to a Maxima doctest (at the end of tour_algebra.rst) that had random low order bits.

Nicolas, thank you for your review!

Just one remark: I do not know what the 'author' field is used for, but if it is meant to identify the authors of the change (as opposed to track the authors/submitters of the patches) then Bertrand Meyer should be added. Paul Zimmermann and Ismaël Bouya helped with proofreading and suggestions.
