REFEREE REPORT



The patch **sr_sphinx.patch** applied fine against Sage version 3.4. All tests passed, even with the `-long` option. The reference manual (which the patch touches) builds OK and looks rather prettier, which is what Martin wants :-)  Positive review.



Note that while reviewing this ticket, I also noticed some further enhancements that can be done to `sr.py`. But these are addressed in ticket #5527.
