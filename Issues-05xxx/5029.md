I got tired of not knowing what (new) file /dev/null is when reviewing tickets, or being able to see the hg comments, so I updated the hg plugin to show this info. I'm using this for trac.cython.org. 

This just needs to go into the plugin directory of this trac server, and then restart the trac server. Make sure the filename matches the python version (e.g. py2.4 or py2.5), just rename it if not.

Also, the Trac 0.11 series has a diff viewer that shows this information.  Are we switching after SD12?

Thanks, Robert, for raising this issue and have it fixed. With trac now able to display diff comments, it has made my life easier when it comes to crediting patch authors. Previously, I would need to download a patch in raw text format in order to see the patch author's name (and I'm bad at spelling people's names).
