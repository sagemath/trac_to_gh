This is wrong:

```
sage: ReflexivePolytope(2,0).faces(dim=0)[0].nboundary_points()
1
```
because vertices do not have boundary points. 

The patch fixes the function that caused this error.

**Attachment:** [11804.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket5654/11804.patch.gz)

This passes doctests, and is a simple change that makes sense to me.
