Very good!   Nice to know I have been setting a good example.

Chris, in case you have not yet picked this up, debugging the restification involves the following.

1. Make a new clone.
2. In the new clone run "sage -docbuild reference html".  The first time takes a while.
3. Point your browser at the place it says (prepend "file://" and append "index.html")
4. If you are adding a new file to the ref manual, add a suitable line to (for example) $SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/doc/en/reference/plane_curves.rst
5. After making some edits, after doing "sage -b" then as well as doing "sage -t" on the file, also do (again) "sage -docbuild reference html" which will pick up that the file has changed and rebuild the html page.  Of course the page needs to be reloaded in the browser.

Not all of that was obvious to me, so I hope it helps!

What do we learn : never try to submit a patch just before catching the train.
Sorry about this patching mess. 

Only the very last patch counts. I applied it successfully against 3.4.1 + #4933 and #5851. It produces three doctest-errors in ell_rational_field with --long, but they are there even without my patch it seems to me.

One might decide against including ell_modular_symbols. The main documentation is in ell_rational_field. Of course I did not include padic_height, since it is deprecated anyway.

I do not know how to solve the issue of the alias power_series producing double documentation. I do not know how the references to article should be done correctly.
