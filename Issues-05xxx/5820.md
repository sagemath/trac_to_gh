As discussed at http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/bc99d36058aff638 , the following is wrong:

```
sage: f = ZZ.hom(QQ)
sage: g = loads(dumps(f))
sage: f == g
False
```

(It should return True.)

This is actually a problem with ring coercion morphisms, namely that they don't have a comparison method defined.

The attached patch does this and adds doctests (including `f == loads(dumps(f))`).
