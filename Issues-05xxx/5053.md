Apparently, the pid of any sub process is written in a temporary file, in a folder whose name is derived from the hostname.

And apparently, when writing these files, any '-' in the hostname will be replaced by '_'. But this replacement is ignored in the `sage-cleaner` script.

So, the obvious solution is to replace '-' by '_' in the `sage-cleaner`. This is what my patch does.

I tested the following: 
* change the hostname into 'test-test_test'
* before applying the patch, folders 'test_test_test' (sic!) are created in SAGE_TMP. But the `sage-cleaner` does not clean them
* after applying the patch, the same folders are created, but this time they are removed after leaving sage.
* don't forget to change back to your original hostname ;-)

I had a short discussion with William: 

A related issue occurs when the hostname contains a slash '/'. Namely, the file name obtained from the hostname would be interpreted as a *path* name, yielding an error! Again, a possible solution is to replace '/' by '_', both in `sage/misc/misc.py` and in the `sage-cleaner`. Since the reason is more or less the same, William suggested to discuss this on the same ticket.

And similarly, there may be problems when the hostname contains a backslash '\'. So, I did the according replacement.

There is only one situation in which this idea might be a problem:
* There are two hosts whose names coincide after the replacements
* These hosts share DOT_SAGE
* By coincidence, two Sage processes running on these two hosts have the same `pid`.

This situation would yield a collision, but it seems to be **extremely unlikely**.

**Conclusion**
 There are hostnames containing a slash (I think I have seen one in nature...). So, in the current setting, a bug would occur. My patches (all three together) fix this bug. 
 The price to pay is another bug that would occur in an extremely unlikely setting.

I tested my patches with the hostnames `test-test_test`, `test/test` and `test\test`.

cwitty pointed out in IRC that `/` and `\` probably aren't even legal for hostnames, but what the heck: positive review.

I am curious how the problem about those two characters come up.

Cheers,
