The patch calls the NTL irreducibility test directly instead of depending on a generic algorithm.  It's not blazingly fast (e.g. Magma), but it's an improvement.

Is making it a `cpdef` function really necessary?

Also, I'm CCing Paul Zimmermann who would know about fast implementations of this.

<a id='comment:3'></a>I think your timings are off since you time the `random_element()` call.

## BEFORE

```
sage: P.<x> = GF(2)[]
sage: f = P.random_element(1000)
sage: %timeit f.is_irreducible()
10 loops, best of 3: 948 ms per loop

sage: f = P.random_element(10000)
sage: %time f.is_irreducible()
# gave up because it took minutes!
```

## AFTER

```
sage: P.<x> = GF(2)[]

sage: f = P.random_element(1000)
sage: %timeit f.is_irreducible()
10000 loops, best of 3: 22.7 µs per loop

sage: f = P.random_element(10000)
sage: %timeit f.is_irreducible()
1000 loops, best of 3: 394 µs per loop

sage: f = P.random_element(100000)
sage: %timeit f.is_irreducible()
100 loops, best of 3: 10.4 ms per loop
```

So we have 948*ms* vs. 22.3*micros* => `948*1000/22.3 = 42511.2107623318`

not directly, but the factor.cpp program searches for the smaller factor (in terms of degree)
of x^r + x^s + 1, it can be used as a starting point for a general irreducibility test.

Because it seems like premature optimisation. If now one wants to change stuff around one always has to touch the header now which I find annoying. Also, I see little benefit in making this optimisation. From Python the advantage is nil and from Cython it is trivial to call NTL's function directly which is *much* faster.

I agree that this is somewhat a question of taste but I'd rather avoid a false sense of optimisation.

You are absolutely right.  Apparently I've already blocked out calling the M4RI interface directly. :-)

I'm just reciting what I've read.  I am enjoying [1] right now, available at

Hi Martin. Is it possible for you to provide some system info? It would be good to accompany your timing statistics with some system architecture info.

<a id='comment:15'></a>On Debian 5.0 Lenny with the following system info:

```
kernel: 2.6.24-1-686
CPU: Intel(R) Celeron(R) 2.00GHz 
RAM: 1.0GB
```
here are some timing statistics:

```
# BEFORE

sage: %timeit f.is_irreducible()
10 loops, best of 3: 1.14 s per loop

# AFTER

sage: P.<x> = GF(2)[]
sage: f = P.random_element(1000)
sage: %timeit f.is_irreducible()
10000 loops, best of 3: 40.7 µs per loop

That is, a "before" 1.14 seconds vs. an "after" 40.7 microseconds, resulting in a speedup of 28x:

```
sage: a = 1.14 * 1000  # convert to microseconds
sage: b = 40.7  # unit is microseconds
sage: (a - b) / a
0.964298245614035
sage: a / b
28.0098280098280

<a id='comment:16'></a>Hi Minh,

my system is a 2.33 Ghz Core2Duo running 64-bit Debian/squeeze.

Note that you mixed up the units in your calculation. `1.14` seconds are `1.14 * 10<sup>6</sup>` microseconds not `1.14 * 10<sup>3</sup>`, i.e. you're mixing it up with milliseconds.

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(time)

So you need to add a factor of 1000.

For `d=10000` it seems even more:

```
  4974.95 * 10^6 / 930
```
