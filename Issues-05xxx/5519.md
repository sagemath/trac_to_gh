The patch calls the NTL irreducibility test directly instead of depending on a generic algorithm.  It's not blazingly fast (e.g. Magma), but it's an improvement.

Is making it a `cpdef` function really necessary?

Also, I'm CCing Paul Zimmermann who would know about fast implementations of this.

I think your timings are off since you time the `random_element()` call.

## BEFORE

```
sage: P.<x> = GF(2)[]
sage: f = P.random_element(1000)
sage: %timeit f.is_irreducible()
10 loops, best of 3: 948 ms per loop

sage: f = P.random_element(10000)
sage: %time f.is_irreducible()
# gave up because it took minutes!
```

## AFTER

```
sage: P.<x> = GF(2)[]

sage: f = P.random_element(1000)
sage: %timeit f.is_irreducible()
10000 loops, best of 3: 22.7 µs per loop

sage: f = P.random_element(10000)
sage: %timeit f.is_irreducible()
1000 loops, best of 3: 394 µs per loop

sage: f = P.random_element(100000)
sage: %timeit f.is_irreducible()
100 loops, best of 3: 10.4 ms per loop
```

So we have 948*ms* vs. 22.3*micros* => `948*1000/22.3 = 42511.2107623318`

the GF2X library (http://wwwmaths.anu.edu.au/~brent/gf2x.html) contains a
fast test. We are currently using it for polynomials of degree 43112609.
I guess there was a ticket about including GF2X in Sage.

Paul, does GF2X also have a `is_primitive()` function of some sorts?

not directly, but the factor.cpp program searches for the smaller factor (in terms of degree)
of x^r + x^s + 1, it can be used as a starting point for a general irreducibility test.

Because it seems like premature optimisation. If now one wants to change stuff around one always has to touch the header now which I find annoying. Also, I see little benefit in making this optimisation. From Python the advantage is nil and from Cython it is trivial to call NTL's function directly which is *much* faster.

I agree that this is somewhat a question of taste but I'd rather avoid a false sense of optimisation.

You are absolutely right.  Apparently I've already blocked out calling the M4RI interface directly. :-)

I'm just reciting what I've read.  I am enjoying [1] right now, available at

http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lecuyer/papers.html

as f2lin.pdf.  They make this claim on page 11 in the first full paragraph, and cite [2] and [3].  They malign trinomials and pentanomials in particular (no offense intended) for PRNGs.

Hi Martin. Is it possible for you to provide some system info? It would be good to accompany your timing statistics with some system architecture info.

On Debian 5.0 Lenny with the following system info:

```
kernel: 2.6.24-1-686
CPU: Intel(R) Celeron(R) 2.00GHz 
RAM: 1.0GB
```
here are some timing statistics:

```
# BEFORE

sage: P.<x> = GF(2)[]
sage: f = P.random_element(1000)
sage: %timeit f.is_irreducible()
10 loops, best of 3: 1.14 s per loop
sage: 
sage: f = P.random_element(10000)
sage: %time f.is_irreducible()
CPU times: user 4972.13 s, sys: 2.83 s, total: 4974.95 s
Wall time: 5043.02 s
False


# AFTER

sage: P.<x> = GF(2)[]
sage: f = P.random_element(1000)
sage: %timeit f.is_irreducible()
10000 loops, best of 3: 40.7 µs per loop
sage: 
sage: f = P.random_element(10000)
sage: %timeit f.is_irreducible()
1000 loops, best of 3: 930 µs per loop
sage: 
sage: 
sage: f = P.random_element(100000)
sage: %timeit f.is_irreducible()
10 loops, best of 3: 27.6 ms per loop
```
That is, a "before" 1.14 seconds vs. an "after" 40.7 microseconds, resulting in a speedup of 28x:

```
sage: a = 1.14 * 1000  # convert to microseconds
sage: b = 40.7  # unit is microseconds
sage: (a - b) / a
0.964298245614035
sage: a / b
28.0098280098280
```

Hi Minh,

my system is a 2.33 Ghz Core2Duo running 64-bit Debian/squeeze.

Note that you mixed up the units in your calculation. `1.14` seconds are `1.14 * 10<sup>6</sup>` microseconds not `1.14 * 10<sup>3</sup>`, i.e. you're mixing it up with milliseconds.

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(time)

So you need to add a factor of 1000.

For `d=10000` it seems even more:

```
  4974.95 * 10^6 / 930
```

Thanks for this. I'll put it in the release tour.
