Here is the code of is_unit for symbolic rings (it is actually iherited from Ring):

```
    def is_unit(self):
        if self == 1 or self == -1:
            return True
        raise NotImplementedError
```
On can do better !!!

As a result

```
sage: m=matrix(SR, 2,2)
sage: m.is_invertible()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NotImplementedError                       Traceback (most recent call last)
```
