sage.functions.constants.Merten is named wrongly, as the mathematician's name is Franz Mertens and not Merten. The class and default instance should be renamed and "Merten constant" and "Merten's second theorem" in the docstring should be fixed.

This ticket **removes** the "merten" function.

This was never deprecated, so we (unfortunately) cannot simply remove it. Instead we need to set a `deprecated_function_alias`.

well, it is more complicated than expected.

merten is a constant, belonging to the symbolic ring.

It is not possible to use deprecated_function_alias, because it is not a function.

So far, I have found no way to deprecate merten. I would be tempted to remove it with no deprecation, even if this is not an orthodox procedure.
