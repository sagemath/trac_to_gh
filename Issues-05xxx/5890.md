As noted at #5765, `ell_generic.py` has some functions that do not make sense over a general ring and should rather be moved down to `ell_field.py` or one of its descendants.

Note also William's comment from #5765: I think it would be nice to be able to implement the elliptic curve factorization method (ECM) without having to use this hack:

```
R = Zmod(N)
R.is_field = lambda: True
E = EllipticCurve(R, [-1,0])
```

 I mean of course that it works for me in 3.4.1 without the hackish line that fools Sage into thinking that R is a field.

The attached patch does some cleaning up, and it depends on #5765.

It moves all the twists-related methods from `ell_generic.py` to `ell_field.py`, as well as the alias `base_field = base_ring`.

It also makes `change_ring` into an alias for `base_extend`, since the two have the exact same functionality and equivalent code.

Lastly, the standalone function `Hasse_bounds` is moved from `ell_generic.py` to `schemes/plane_curves/projective_curve.py`, which is a more natural place for it.

There are more things to do, but they are issues with the generic code for curves rather than the code for elliptic curves, so I think they should be fixed in `schemes/plane_curves` instead.  I'll be looking into that soon.

Review: first of all, this is just moving code around, all perfectly sensible (lots of stuff moved down from ell_generic to ell_field, and Hasse_bound function moved off to plane curves (where I should have put it in the first place).

I applied first 12097.patch (from #5919) then trac_5765-rebased.patch (from #5765) and then trac_5890.patch (from here), all successfully.

Doctests in schemes/plane_curves and schemes/elliptic_curves pass.  I will give this a positive review, despite the following, which will make it harder to do EC factoring (but the fault lies not in the patch here, rather in moving the test for a point lying on a curve which is now more sophisticated to harder to fool.... but that is not for this ticket to sort out.

The example

```
N = 1001
R = Zmod(N)
R.is_field = lambda: True
E = EllipticCurve(R, [-1,0])
```
works but you cannot construct a point in the curve (e.g. E(0,0)) since this happens:

```
sage: P = E(0,0)
