As discussed here: http://groups.google.co.uk/group/sage-nt/browse_thread/thread/4c6e60b6a20cabae#

I do not like this inconsistency between ZZ and QQ:

```
sage: a=ZZ(8)
sage: a.nth_root(3)
2
sage: b=QQ(8)
sage: b.nth_root(3)
2
sage: a.nth_root(2)
2
sage: b.nth_root(2)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)

/home/masgaj/.sage/temp/host_56_150/13463/_home_masgaj_sage_egros_sage_5.py
in <module>()

/local/jec/sage-3.4/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/sage/rings/rational.so
in sage.rings.rational.Rational.nth_root
(sage/rings/rational.c:8888)()

ValueError: not a perfect nth power
```

I cannot think of a reason why we have an nth_root function on
integers which silently truncates a real root for positive argument
and gives a ValueError for negative ones.

The attached ticket deals with this, and at the same time adds a couple of extra utilities which I needed for rational numbers.

**Keywords:** nth root rational integer

* The new code you added to extended_integer_ring.py is this:

```
 	199	    def nth_root(self, n, truncate_mode=0): 
 	200	        temp = Integer.nth_root(self, n, truncate_mode) 
 	201	        if truncate_mode: 
 	202	            return self.parent()(temp[0]), temp[1]
```
There is no documentation or docstring or doctests.

* In integer.pyx:

```
def nth_root(self, int n, int truncate_mode=0): 
```
Should the truncate_mode be of type bint (=boolean int)?

Otherwise, I like this patch.

Ok, I will take care of this in the morning. I know also know why RobertWB's patch at #5735 had rejection issues since he must have had this patch in his que.

I am reinstating the positive review and will merge all three patches into one modulo the changes for files that no longer exist.

Cheers,

Michael

Attachment [trac_5685_new.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket5685/trac_5685_new.patch) by @JohnCremona created at 2009-04-13 13:37:14

I have uploaded a new rebased patch replacing all three (in fact the first was already subsumed into the second), based on 3.4.1.rc2 + patches at #5735 (deleteding extended_integer, extended_rational).  Hope this works ok.

Hmm, I am not sure what happened, but only the latest rebased patch has some rejection issues in integer.pyx: 

```

```

I will poke around later and see what the problem is.

It must be something else merged since 3.4.1.rc2 since I just tried again and had no problems with 3.4.1.rc2 + 5735 patches + the latest one here.

Hi John,

I checked and I did not merge any patch into rc3 so far that touches integer.pyx. It is a problem with patch and not hg, i.e. a hg patch can (and does in this case) contain multiple diff for a file, so running it with --dry-run will not work. My apologies about being dumb in this case, but I am testing the patch right now and will merge it in case it doctests.

Cheers,

Thanks -- I hope I was not doing anything wrong in making the patch -- I used hg queues to combine the earlier ones and add the new stuff, but did not do a "hg qfold" as I think I should have done.  Sorry.
