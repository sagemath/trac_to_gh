As discussed here: http://groups.google.co.uk/group/sage-nt/browse_thread/thread/4c6e60b6a20cabae#

I do not like this inconsistency between ZZ and QQ:

```
sage: a=ZZ(8)
sage: a.nth_root(3)
2
sage: b=QQ(8)
sage: b.nth_root(3)
2
sage: a.nth_root(2)
2
sage: b.nth_root(2)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)

/home/masgaj/.sage/temp/host_56_150/13463/_home_masgaj_sage_egros_sage_5.py
in <module>()

/local/jec/sage-3.4/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/sage/rings/rational.so
in sage.rings.rational.Rational.nth_root
(sage/rings/rational.c:8888)()

ValueError: not a perfect nth power
```

I cannot think of a reason why we have an nth_root function on
integers which silently truncates a real root for positive argument
and gives a ValueError for negative ones.

The attached ticket deals with this, and at the same time adds a couple of extra utilities which I needed for rational numbers.

Keywords: **nth root rational integer**

<a id='comment:2'>Comment 2:</a>
* The new code you added to extended_integer_ring.py is this:

```
 	199	    def nth_root(self, n, truncate_mode=0): 
 	200	        temp = Integer.nth_root(self, n, truncate_mode) 
 	201	        if truncate_mode: 
 	202	            return self.parent()(temp[0]), temp[1]
```
There is no documentation or docstring or doctests.

* In integer.pyx:

```
def nth_root(self, int n, int truncate_mode=0): 
```
Should the truncate_mode be of type bint (=boolean int)?

Otherwise, I like this patch.

Ok, I will take care of this in the morning. I know also know why RobertWB's patch at #5735 had rejection issues since he must have had this patch in his que.

I am reinstating the positive review and will merge all three patches into one modulo the changes for files that no longer exist.

Cheers,

Michael

It must be something else merged since 3.4.1.rc2 since I just tried again and had no problems with 3.4.1.rc2 + 5735 patches + the latest one here.

Thanks -- I hope I was not doing anything wrong in making the patch -- I used hg queues to combine the earlier ones and add the new stuff, but did not do a "hg qfold" as I think I should have done.  Sorry.
