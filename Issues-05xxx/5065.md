The torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve appears to be quite broken -- it barfs when trying to coerce in 0,

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve(1)
sage: T = E.torsion_subgroup()
sage: T(0)
...
...
TypeError: Argument x (= 0) is of wrong type.
```

further, it returns a mysterious 1 when coercing in a 1

```
sage: a = T(1); a
1
sage: b = T.gens()[0]-T.gens()[0]; b
(0 : 1 : 0)
sage: a+b
TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for '+': 'Abelian group of points on Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 + x*y + y = x^3 - 19*x + 26 over Rational Field' and 'Torsion Subgroup isomorphic to Multiplicative Abelian Group isomorphic to C6 x C2 associated to the Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 + x*y + y = x^3 - 19*x + 26 over Rational Field'
```

Yet, it's all cool with the original curve.

```
sage: E(0)
(0 : 1 : 0)
sage: E(1)
...
...
TypeError: v (=(1,)) must have 3 components
sage: 
```

Here is the reason.  the torsion subgroup class is derived from the Abelian group class, which in Sage is always a multiplicative group!  So it can coerce in 1 to give the identity 1, but not 0.

<div id="comment:6" align="right">comment:6</div>

In 4.5.3.alpha3 this works fine:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve(j=1)
sage: T = E.torsion_subgroup()
sage: T(0)
(0 : 1 : 0)
```
thanks to the new Abelian Groups support.  So this ticket can be closed as fixed.
