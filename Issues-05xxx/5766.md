BUGS FOUND:
1. The reduce option to formal sum is totally ignored.

```
sage: FormalSum([(1,2/3), (3,2/3), (-5, 7)], reduce=False)
4*2/3 - 5*7
```

2. Latexing formal sums is completely broken (I think this is actually #5707):

```
sage: latex(FormalSum([(1,2), (5, 8/9), (-3, 7)]))
5\frac{8}{9}2 - 37
```

With all three patch applied I am seeing the following doctest failure:

```
sage -t -long "devel/sage/sage/misc/latex.py"               
**********************************************************************
File "/scratch/mabshoff/sage-3.4.2.rc0/devel/sage/sage/misc/latex.py", line 942:
    sage: repr_lincomb([1,5,-3],[2,8/9,7])
Expected:
    '2*1 + 8/9*5 + 7*-3'
Got:
    '21 + \\frac{8}{9}5 + 7-3'
**********************************************************************
```
Since this seems to be the correct LaTeX representation I am fixing this failure.

Cheers,

Michael
