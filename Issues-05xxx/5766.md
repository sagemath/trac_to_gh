BUGS FOUND:
1. The reduce option to formal sum is totally ignored.

```
sage: FormalSum([(1,2/3), (3,2/3), (-5, 7)], reduce=False)
4*2/3 - 5*7
```

2. Latexing formal sums is completely broken (I think this is actually #5707):

```
sage: latex(FormalSum([(1,2), (5, 8/9), (-3, 7)]))
5\frac{8}{9}2 - 37
```
