This was on sage-support on April 25.

Thanks for posting the new example.  I have found that the problem is
due to the fact that Sage puts the output inside a <PRE> block, and
IE7 gets confused about some of its measurements in that case.  It can
be fixed by including

 span.typeset {
    white-space: normal;
 }

in the css/main.css file for sage.  I will add this to jsMath in the
next release.

We should add this to sage, since who knows when it'll go into jsmath and get into sage.
