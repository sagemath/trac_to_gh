This was on sage-support on April 25.

Thanks for posting the new example.  I have found that the problem is
due to the fact that Sage puts the output inside a <PRE> block, and
IE7 gets confused about some of its measurements in that case.  It can
be fixed by including

 span.typeset {
    white-space: normal;
 }

in the css/main.css file for sage.  I will add this to jsMath in the
next release.

We should add this to sage, since who knows when it'll go into jsmath and get into sage.

This is in the version of jsMath included with SageNB.  Should we close this ticket?
