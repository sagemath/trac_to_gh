Dear All,

I have just pushed a patch to the combinat server which:
* deprecates *r_core*, *r_quotient* (and *k_core*) in favour of *core* and *quotient*, respectively. I also made *core* return a partition rather than a list.
* rewrites the Partition() calling function to use keywords rather than named arguments. In the process I deprecated the *core_and_quotient* argument replacing it with *Partition(core=?,quotient=?)*.
* deprecated *partition_sign* in favour of *sign* and replaced the previous call to gap with plus or minus one as required.

Almost all of the changes are to partition.py, however, the  patch affects the following four files as they all called *r_core* or *r_quotient*:
- sage/combinat/ktableau.py
- sage/combinat/partition.py
- sage/combinat/ribbon_tableau.py
- sage/combinat/skew_partition.py

Not all of the doc tests pass, however, the problems seem to be caused elsewhere -- please let me know if I am wrong!

The patch looks good. A couple of small comments.

* The documentation for core still uses the terminology "r-core". Perhaps you can replace this with 'core' and add a note along the lines: 'sometimes called r-core and k-core in the literature'.

* Same comment applies to the documentation for "r-quotient".

Andrew's changes made `from_exp` and `from_core_and_quotient`
methods of a partition, but they shouldn't be since they don't depend on
the partition at all. It's strange, to me, to have the constructor work
this way:

```
sage: p = Partition([])
sage: p.from_exp([3,2,1])
[3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1]

sage: q = Partition([3,2,2,1,1,1])
sage: q.from_exp([3,2,1])
[3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1]
```

I've reverted those changes in my review patch, otherwise it looks good. 

To be clear: I do not object to gathering all the code for constructing
partitions into one class. Perhaps a new `PartitionConstructor` class
would be better? Either way, this is not the point of this ticket.

Someone needs to look over my changes, of course.

Apply only 5790.2.patch and trac_5790-review.patch.
