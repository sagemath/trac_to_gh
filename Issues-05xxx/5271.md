jmol-11.6.16.spkg from #2873 was **not** based on the latest upstream jmol.spkg. While taking a closer look I found all kind of other odd things, so I moved the updated spkg to a new ticker. The spkg can be found at

I based my changes on the jmol spkg that was sitting in my 3.3alpha3 tree, so I'm surprised it wasn't the latest.  Anyways, thanks for noticing this and taking care of it!

But I do it with *every* spkg anyway :)\n\nCheers,\n\nMichael",
