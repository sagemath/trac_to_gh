Installing CRAN packages with `r.console()` and then `install.packages()` fails with the error: 

"Can't open /home/was/build/sage-3.1.4/local/lib/R/share/sh/dcf.sh". **Strange enough, as the Sage version is 3.2.3, not 3.1.4.** This can be "fixed" by creating a symlink from /home/was/build/sage-3.1.4 to the real Sage installation, but it would be better if it worked out of the box. R without CRAN is not very useful.

<div id="comment:1" align="right">Comment 1</div>

This is from a binary not build by that person that seems to have been upgraded in place. I am not sure this is reproducible, so unless someone can either reproduce this or get the original reporter to give additional info this is "invalid" for me.

R in general does stupid things like ignore RHOME and R_HOME when using cran, so this might very well be an upstream bug.

In general bugs reported via "report a problem" should go to the groups first before anyone opens a ticket.

And this certainly isn't critical.

Cheers,

Michael
