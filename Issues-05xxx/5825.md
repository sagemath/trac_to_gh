Is it worth checking permissions before attempting to download an spkg?

```
$ sage -i pybtex
tee: /Users/palmieri/Desktop/Sage_stuff/sage_builds/sage-5.10.beta4/logs/install.log: Permission denied
tee: /Users/palmieri/Desktop/Sage_stuff/sage_builds/sage-5.10.beta4/logs/pkgs/pybtex.log: Permission denied
Attempting to download package pybtex
>>> Checking online list of optional packages.
[.]

>>> Downloading http://www.sagemath.org/spkg/optional/pybtex-20120618.spkg.

```
This is not as nice an error message as you added in other situations:

```
$ sage -f gcc

Error: no write access to build directory /Users/palmieri/Desktop/Sage_stuff/sage_builds/sage-5.10.beta4/spkg/build.
