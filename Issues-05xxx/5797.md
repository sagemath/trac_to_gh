In 3.4.1.rc2, matrix1.pyx is missing doctests and documentation. I'll attach a patch that covers all but two functions:

`new_matrix` is just a wrapper around `matrix_space` and `MatrixSpace`. The documentation for `MatrixSpace` isn't complete enough for me to say exactly what all the parameters of `new_matrix` do. Can someone who knows more about this make a suggestion?

The function `_singular_` has no doctests (and the current docstring is deeply confusing) and -- surprise, surprise -- is broken. I'll open a separate ticket for that.

The attached patch adds doctests, documentation, and also fixes up a lot of the ReST formatting.

I'm ignoring `_singular_` for now, since it's broken and I don't know enough to fix it. I do need advice on what to do for `new_matrix`.

The patch applies fine (to 3.4.1.rc3) and the docs build and look ok.

It seems a pity not to have any doctest for new_matrix(), so I have added one.  I also added "indirect doctest" where necessary and a load(dumps) test, so that we now have

```
sage/matrix/matrix1.pyx
SCORE sage/matrix/matrix1.pyx: 97% (36 of 37)

Missing doctests:
	 * _singular_(self, singular=None):
```

I put "positive review" despite adding a little.

The new patch replaces the first one.

I'm not sure if I can/should review your changes, but they are fine and I approve. :)

I didn't know about the "indirect doctest", nor really how to write a load/dumps test. Thanks for adding those.

Thank you also for writing the new_matrix doctest. Perhaps I should open another ticket for improving the MatrixSpace documentation.
