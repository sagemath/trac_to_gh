TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for %: 'sage.rings.real_mpfr.RealLiteral' and 'int'
```

A quick look through sage/rings/real_mpfr.pyx reveals that there is no `__mod__` method defined.

MPFR documentation here:

http://www.mpfr.org/mpfr-current/mpfr.html#Integer-Related-Functions

suggests that one of `mpfr_fmod()` or `mpfr_remainder()` should be used, depending on the desired rounding properties. Since I live blissfully in the exact arithmetic world, I have no idea which one is more suitable for Sage.

Nevertheless, a patch that uses `mpfr_remainder()` is attached.
