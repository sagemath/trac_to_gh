Here is the extent of the docstring for the commutator method in matrix0.pyx:

```
        Return the commutator self*other - other*self.

        EXAMPLES:
            sage: A = Matrix(QQ[['t']], 2, 2, range(4))
```
Fix the doctest so that it actually computes a commutator.


**Assignee:** @williamstein

**Keywords:** matrix0, commutator
