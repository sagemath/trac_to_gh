Mr. Stein,

I was on IRC sage-devel asking about some problems installing new packages for R.  You asked if I could fix it and unfortunately I can not completely fix it, but I did learn more about the problems preventing it from working.  I was up late waiting for the Formula 1 race to start and so I had a look at some of the problems with r.install_packages().

1. local/bin/R and/or local/lib/R/bin/R
    Not sure why there are two or which gets called ... but one (or both) seem to be called a lot during R package installation.  Anyway, they are both identical and have an echo line that seems to get piped into gcc command lines causing many problems.

[from local/bin/R]
  echo "WARNING: ignoring environment value of R_HOME"

This may be a total kludge in the grand scheme of things, but redirecting echo's output to stderr seems to allow many packages (e.g., nortest) to be built so that they can be used.

[I changed the above echo line in both files to ...]
  echo "WARNING: ignoring environment value of R_HOME" 1>&2

2. local/lib/R/etc/Makeconf
    Not sure what this fixes as there is still a problem with C++ packages, but the file above has:

CPPFLAGS = -I/home/rick/sage/sage-3.2.3/local/inlcude

The unfortunate character swapping is easily fixed with:

 CPPFLAGS = -I/home/rick/sage/sage-3.2.3/local/include

3. local/lib/gcc-lib/i686-pc-linux-gnu/4.0.3/libgcc_s.so.1
    I'm not exactly sure what the problem here is, but I believe it has to do with building C++ libraries with a gcc version that does not match.  I use Fedora 9 and my version of gcc is 4.3.1.  When, after making the changes described above in 1 and 2, I tried to build the R package Matrix (r.install_packages('Matrix')), the resulting library could not be loaded.

Error in dyn.load(file, ...) :
  unable to load shared library '/home/rick/sage/sage-3.2.3/local/lib/R/library/Matrix/libs/Matrix.so':
  /home/rick/sage/sage-3.2.3/local/lib/gcc-lib/i686-pc-linux-gnu/4.0.3/libgcc_s.so.1: version `GCC_4.2.0' not found (required by /usr/lib/libstdc++.so.6)
Error: require(Matrix) is not TRUE
Execution halted
ERROR: installing package indices failed
** Removing '/home/rick/sage/sage-3.2.3/local/lib/R/library/Matrix'

There are still some mysteries to be solved but I hope the above is a start.

Regards,
Richard Graham

I just installed an optional package earlier today in front of a very heavy R user, and it worked.  The package Matrix is now actually built in Sage's R, as a 'recommended' package, in fact, so the specific example above clearly is not correct any more.  Here are some examples.
