Type 

```
%python
os.chdir(1,2,2)
```
into a notebook cell in sage <= 3.3.rc0 and you will get this
as output

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "/Users/wstein/.sage/sage_notebook/worksheets/admin/42/code/14.py", line 6, in <module>
    print _support_.syseval(python, ur'''os.chdir(1,2,2)''', '/Users/wstein/.sage/sage_notebook/worksheets/admin/42/cells/35')
  File "/Users/wstein/build/build/sage-3.3.alpha3/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/sage/server/support.py", line 321, in syseval
    return system.eval(cmd)
TypeError: eval() takes at least 3 arguments (2 given)
```

That's bad since it's giving a traceback based on an error in the use of the system.eval method by the sage notebook itself in server/support.py!

In Sage mode one gets:

```
os.chdir(1,2,2)
```
outputs

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "/Users/wstein/.sage/sage_notebook/worksheets/admin/42/code/15.py", line 7, in <module>
    os.chdir(_sage_const_1 ,_sage_const_2 ,_sage_const_2 )

TypeError: chdir() takes exactly 1 argument (3 given)
```

That's much better -- at least it is the right exception.  Of course the spurious reference ot SQLAlchemy is yet another bug...
