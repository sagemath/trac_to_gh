David Loeffler reported this on sage-devel:

```
sage: K.<a> = QuadraticField(-23)
sage: L.<b> = K.extension(x^3 - x - 1)
sage: OL = L.ring_of_integers()   # infinite loop?
```

Note also that CTRL-C seems to have no effect.  I see the same problem on my 32-bit Archlinux machine.

Yes, this issue had already been raised in #4738, and I commented there that "The problem of the slowness of computing relative maximal orders is solved by the patch in #5842.  A doctest is included at line 532 of the patched `number_field_rel.py`" (It's become line 570 by 4.1)  

What changed was a rewrite of `maximal_order` for relative number fields. The previous version was repetitive and grossly wasteful of memory.
