David Loeffler reported this on sage-devel:

```
sage: K.<a> = QuadraticField(-23)
sage: L.<b> = K.extension(x^3 - x - 1)
sage: OL = L.ring_of_integers()   # infinite loop?
```

Note also that CTRL-C seems to have no effect.  I see the same problem on my 32-bit Archlinux machine.

Actually, CTRL-C does eventually stop this, with the following result:

I do not think this is a problem with the relative number field patch; it was an existing problem.  I have code that I can submit if you want to compute the relative ring of integers; it uses pari's rnfbasis.

This issue has to with the fact that `L.ring_of_integers().base_ring()` is ZZ and not `K.ring_of_integers()`.  There's already a ticket for that.

Loading Sage library. Current Mercurial branch is: unitary
sage: K.<a> = QuadraticField(-23)
sage: L.<b> = K.extension(x^3 - x - 1)
sage: time OL = L.ring_of_integers()

```

I don't know what's changed -- presumably this is something to do with Francis Clarke's campaign to fix all the relative number field bugs over the last couple of months -- but presumably we can close this ticket now?

Yes, this issue had already been raised in #4738, and I commented there that "The problem of the slowness of computing relative maximal orders is solved by the patch in #5842.  A doctest is included at line 532 of the patched `number_field_rel.py`" (It's become line 570 by 4.1)  

What changed was a rewrite of `maximal_order` for relative number fields. The previous version was repetitive and grossly wasteful of memory.
