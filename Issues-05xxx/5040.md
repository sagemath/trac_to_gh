If you build sage and the directory path contains a "-h" anywhere in it, then NTL's perl DoConfig script displays a help message and exists.  This totally breaks building sage.  The code at fault is:

```

   if ($arg =~ '-h|help|-help|--help') {
      system("more ../doc/config.txt");
      exit;
   }
```

In particular, PREFIX will get passed in and if your directory were, e.g,. build-sage-help-me-foobar then Sage won't work.

The spkg at

fixes the problem by removing the help option for now. Note that this spkg also fixes #4978.

Code looks good.  The new spkg does build, and relevant doctests still pass after rebuilding NTL-related .pyx files.

Positive review.
