When looking at #3760 it took a long long time to see that this had anything whatever to do with singular.  To speed this up, we should patch two files in Singular so that instead of getting

as an error, one gets

I'm wrong, this is a *BUG*, since Sage should not exit on memory overflow, but should instead raise an exception. 
Here's a new example to illustrate the problem:

```

sage: n=500
sage: R = PolynomialRing(QQ,n,names='x')
sage: f = sum(R.gens())
sage: g = f*f

error: no more memory

halt 14
wstein@sage:~/build/sage-4.4.4/spkg/standard$   
```

I should not be dumped to the command prompt!

To get rid of the "exit of out sage" issue hackishly:

1. Modify src/kernel/mminit.cc and put abort() right after the first fprintf in the function void omSingOutOfMemoryFunc().

2. Edit the file devel/sage/sage/libs/singular/polynomial.pyx  by adding _sig_on/_sig_off around `ret[0] = pp_Mult_qq(p, q, r)` in the function singular_polynomial_mul. 

Then we have:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage: sage: n = 1000
sage: sage: R = PolynomialRing(QQ,n,names='x')
sage: sage: f = sum(R.gens())
sage: sage: g = f*f

2 - Singular error: no more memory
calling abort
sage: 
```

Note that strangely there is no traceback.  But at least one gets the sage prompt back.

Regarding speed:

WITH the _sig_on/_sig_off stuff:

```

sage: R.<x,y,z> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: f = (x+y+z)^2
sage: timeit('f*(f+1)')
625 loops, best of 3: 12.6 µs per loop
sage: f = (x+y+z)
sage: timeit('f*(f+1)')
625 loops, best of 3: 11.4 µs per loop
sage: f = (x+y+z)^10+1
sage: timeit('f*(f+1)')
625 loops, best of 3: 168 µs per loop
sage: timeit('x*x')
625 loops, best of 3: 410 ns per loop
```
and without it:

```
sage: sage: R.<x,y,z> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: sage: f = (x+y+z)^2
sage:  timeit('f*(f+1)')
625 loops, best of 3: 12.4 µs per loop
sage: sage: f = (x+y+z)
sage: sage: timeit('f*(f+1)')
625 loops, best of 3: 11.2 µs per loop
sage: sage: f = (x+y+z)^10+1
sage: sage: timeit('f*(f+1)')
625 loops, best of 3: 167 µs per loop
sage: timeit('x*x')
625 loops, best of 3: 290 ns per loop
```

This is all on sage.math.

Okay, I can confirm that the equivalent of [is in the Singular in Sage, but that nothing like [attachment: singular-spkg_add_abort.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket5313/singular-spkg_add_abort.patch.gz)(https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket5313/f5adadf46d7d4c8f3b84eaaf20a8c1fc.gz) is in the current Singular - `abort()` is not called, and can confirm that William's example with the ulimit still fails to raise an exception, although it does now say Singular in the error.  Sorry for not reading more carefully before.

Further, the patch [attachment: trac_5313-sigon_sigoff.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket5313/trac_5313-sigon_sigoff.patch.gz) to Sage no longer applies.

Hunk #4 FAILED at 266
Hunk #5 FAILED at 336

```

Finally, should we submit a pull request or issue [upstream](https://github.com/Singular/Sources) for the abort issue, or is that truly too hackish to ask them to do?  Putting none of the above for upstream since one thing was completely incorporated while the other they apparently don't even know about.
