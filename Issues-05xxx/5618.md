Although this works:

```
sage: K = CyclotomicField(3)
sage: z = K.an_element(); z
zeta3
sage: gap(z)
zeta3
```
the resulting gap element doesn't have the correct properties:

```
sage: K(gap.E(3)) == z  # Good!
True
sage: gap(K(gap.E(3))) == gap.E(3)  # Bad!
False
```

This causes the following problem with group characters.

```
sage: H = AlternatingGroup(4)
sage: g = H.list()[1]
sage: K = H.subgroup([g])
sage: z = CyclotomicField(3).an_element(); z
sage: c = K.character([1,z,z**2])
...
RuntimeError: Gap produced error output
Error, no 1st choice method found for `CONDUCTOR' on 1 arguments
```
Note: the above works if one takes z = gap.E(3).

Here is some problem analysis:

```
sage: K = CyclotomicField(3)
sage: z = K.an_element(); z
zeta3
sage: gap(z)
zeta3
sage: K(gap(z))
zeta3
sage: gap.E(3)
E(3)
sage: gap.E(3) == gap(z)
False
sage: K(gap.E(3)) == K(gap(z)) == z
True
```

So, apparently GAP treats "the same" elements of a cyclotomic field differently if they have different names. But this isn't particularly surprising, since the two cyclotomic fields seem to have a totaly different representation in GAP:

```
sage: ZFgap = gap('CyclotomicField(3)')
sage: Kgap = gap(K)
sage: Kgap
<algebraic extension over the Rationals of degree 2>
sage: ZFgap
CF(3)
sage: ZFgap.GeneratorsOfField()
[ E(3) ]
sage: Kgap.GeneratorsOfField()
[ zeta3 ]
```

Note that comparison of the two field in the GAP interface results in an error:

```
sage: Kgap == ZFgap
ERROR: An unexpected error occurred while tokenizing input
The following traceback may be corrupted or invalid
The error message is: ('EOF in multi-line statement', (47, 0))

```

But GAP indeed considers the two fields to be different:

```
sage: gap.eval(Kgap.name() + ' = ' + ZFgap.name())
'false'
```

So, what does all this mean?

1. The `__cmp__` method of the GAP interface has a bug. An error raised by GAP when attempting "<" or ">" should be caught and then "=" should be tried.
2. A GAP cyclotomic field is different from the GAP version of a Sage cyclotomic field. This is since the GAP version of a Sage cyclotomic field is a number field. It could be solved by providing a genuine `_gap_init_` method for Sage cyclotomic fields (currently, it is inherited from number fields).

It seems likely to me that after implementing 2., things will already work. But 1. should be fixed as well.

Attachment [trac_5618_gap_for_cyclotomic_fields.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket5618/trac_5618_gap_for_cyclotomic_fields.patch) by @simon-king-jena created at 2010-07-04 18:46:22

I created the patch after the patches from #8909 and #9423 -- so, it is possible that the new patch actually depends on the two other tickets (but one of them already has a positive review).

With the patch, a cyclotomic field in Sage is represented as a cyclotomic field (and not as a number field) in GAP:

```
sage: Z = CyclotomicField(8)
sage: gap(Z)
CF(8)
sage: Z(gap(Z.0^2))
zeta8^2
```

The advantage is that the motivating example from the ticket description now works (and is used as a doctest):

```
sage: H = AlternatingGroup(4)
sage: g = H.list()[1]
sage: K = H.subgroup([g])
sage: z = CyclotomicField(3).an_element(); z
sage: c = K.character([1,z,z**2]); c
Character of Subgroup of AlternatingGroup(4) generated by [(2,3,4)]
sage: c(g^2); z^2
-zeta3 - 1
-zeta3 - 1
```

The disadvantage: While it is still possible to chose the name of a number field generator in GAP as in Sage

```
sage: K.<tau> = NumberField(x^2+x+1)
sage: gap(K)
<algebraic extension over the Rationals of degree 3>
sage: K.0
tau
sage: gap(K.0)
tau
```
it is now impossible to do the same for cyclotomic fields:

```
sage: L.<zeta> = CyclotomicField(3)
sage: L.0
zeta
sage: gap(L.0)
E(3)
```

By consequence, I had to fix a couple of doctests. All doctests pass, but I can not vouch for external code.

The semantics of gap(CyclotomicField(n)) have changed!

I give a positive review to Simon's patch. However, I have added some doctest in trac_5618_gap_for_cyclotomic_fields_doctest.patch that needs review. The doctest are in the unpatched code, but they have disappeared in the process. This patch put them back.

Apply:
