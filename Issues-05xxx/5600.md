- Documentation improvements
- Fixes some of http://wiki.sagemath.org/combinat/Weirdness
- Composition(l) accepts any iterable l, and in particular a tuple
- New functionalities:
   - concatenation (as `__add__` and sum)
   - size
   - fatter, finer, fatten (refinement of compositions)
- Uses IntegerListsLex (fast iteration, ...) instead of not any better specific code
  Note: this changes the iteration order to inverse lexicographic,
  and iteration changes the iteration order for set partitions, skew
  partitions, and skew tableaux.

I very much want this patch to get in, since I almost opened a ticket for one of the problems that it fixes. (`Composition()` doesn't take tuples as input.) One thing that needs to change, though, is with the docstring for Composition: right now, it tells the user to do `Composition_class?`, but that doesn't work since `Composition_class` is not in the default namespace. I think `Composition?` should simply display the correct docstring; there's no need to annoy the user by sending him or her bouncing from one docstring to the next.

Another issue is that the AUTHORS block is deleted from the head of the file. This should not be done. In fact, you should add yourself to it as the [developer's guide suggests](http://sagemath.org/doc/developer/conventions.html#headings-of-sage-library-code-files): something like "Nicolas M. Thiery (2009-05-25): several cleanups, new functions, and improvements (trac #5600)". I like listing ticket numbers because interested developers can go see exactly what you changed.

Tiny grammar/spelling issues:

* At the top of compositions.py, you write "a compositions c of..."; you should use the singular. "A composition c of..."
* line 56: you say a composition is a list of *positive* integers, but it should be a list of *nonnegative* integers.

Finally, I am seeing a doctest failure with this patch applied to vanilla 4.0.rc0:
