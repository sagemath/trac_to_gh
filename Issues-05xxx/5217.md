This is also a security issue and we are shipping quite an outdated libpng. So update it.

There re two tarballs in the source section of http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html
(with config and without). Which one did you get last time?


Also, the wiki page of lists of packages has libpng listed under png. Is this confusing?

Hi David,

I have things more or less ready to go for libpng, bzip2 and the Python upgrade, but thanks for the offer.

The GAP.spkg is a lot more complex than any of the above and hopefully it will be a lot smoother in the future. After the initial learning curve had been climbed the quality of your GAP.spkg did improve enough so I did not need to change anything, but any ticket with 50 comments didn't go well :). I have been rather busy and under pressure to get 3.3 out the last 10 days or so, so my comments might not have always been as appropriate as they should have been, so sorry if I did flame you.

I still want to get the GAP.spkg into 3.3, so I will work on the warning issues later.

I need to look it up.

Well, what we currently do is certainly inconsistent, but given that the name is libpng.spkg it should be changed.

Cheers,

Michael

Don't worry - I always wear frame-retardent material while at the keyboard:-) It was probably deserved anyway - garbage at work kept me from focusing.

> I need to look it up. 



For the future, if you be more specific in SPKG.txt about which tarball gets downloaded and how it is pre-processed before creating the spkg, I (or someone else) could help out in the future. 


Generally, I'm happy to help with group theory (eg, GAP), coding theory (though actually I want to *remove* guava), and image-processing (such as libpng and PIL), if you can use a hand.

Absolutely. I never upgraded the libpng.spkg and it shows, i.e. I tend to write a cleaned up and complete SPKG.txt so that it is easier for other people to upgrade.

And the cleaned up SPKG.txt have all ended in the wiki where sooner or later the plan is to automatically extract the info before each release and make it part of the Spkg chapter/appendix in the developer's manual. But that will be post-ReST like so many things.

I think we will include PIL sooner or later.
