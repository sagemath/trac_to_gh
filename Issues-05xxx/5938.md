# Issue 5938: graph plotting -- ploting of graphs (networks) is somehow messed up/scaled wrong/cropped wrong since it doesn't work with graphics_array

Want to see some truly hideous plotting output?  Try this:

```
Q = GraphQuery(display_cols=['graph6','num_vertices','degree_sequence'],num_edges=['<=',5],min_degree=1)

v = Q.get_graphs_list(); v

graphics_array([g.plot() for g in v], 3, len(v)//3).show()
```

I guess the problem is maybe Networkx drawing the plots instead of Sage (??), hence the cropping/layout is wrong?  I don't know.  Why do we use networkx at all for any part of plotting?  It would be better to plot to native Sage primitives, wouldn't it?

Fixed by #9211.

Even this (following the above example), results in hideous mis-cropped plots, and it doesn't use graphics array at all:

```
for g in v[:5]:
    show(g,figsize=2)
```

THIS SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!

I can't believe how annoying it is that plotting graphs is still so totally and completely broken.  It is really, really horrible.  I don't know how anybody can stand this. 

Frickin' a.   Every single graph plot I try has the borders chopped off.  E.g.,

```
sage: Q = GraphQuery(display_cols=['graph6','num_vertices','degree_sequence'], num_edges=['<=',5],min_degree=1)
sage: Q.show(with_picture=True)
[[hideous pain]]
```

Graph vertices are not cut off anymore.  The plot in the description has overlapping vertices, though.
