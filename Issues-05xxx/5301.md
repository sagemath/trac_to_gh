This happens on OS X with a local GUI. Moreover, I get this doctest failure, which is perhaps related:

This problem is caused by this code snipped:

```
    sage: from pylab import *
    sage: t = arange(0.0, 2.0, 0.01)
    sage: s = sin(2*pi*t)
    sage: P = plot(t, s, linewidth=1.0)
    sage: xl = xlabel('time (s)')
    sage: yl = ylabel('voltage (mV)')
    sage: t = title('About as simple as it gets, folks')
    sage: grid(True)
    sage: savefig('sage.png')
```

Glenn has reported the same issue on a Linux box. This might be a genuine bug in MPL. 

Cheers,

Michael

```

<div id="comment:3" align="right">Comment 3</div>

I think there are two separate problems:

(1) 

```
    sage: from pylab import *
    sage: t = arange(0.0, 2.0, 0.01)
    sage: s = sin(2*pi*t)
    sage: P = plot(t, s, linewidth=1.0)
[a popup appears]
```

(2) then do the following one line after the above:

```
sage: savefig('sage.png')
BOOM
ValueError: Unknown file type
```

Other remarks:

* This bug occurs exactly the same in the notebook, so is a major show stopper.
 
* There is probably a way to get around it, since of course our own matplotlib-based plotting works fine without popping up GUI's and writing to files. 


I'm guessing the the best fix is to patch setup.py to avoid building any GUI backends for now, until we can figure out how to patch pylab itself to not use the GUI backends.  I mean, given that one has built any GUI backend, the above behavior (sans the savefig issue) definitely seems like appropriate behavior for matplotlib.

For the record: I did turn off GUI support per default since it causes trouble on X less boxen, i.e. sage.math. This might very well be a bug in the new MPL, so someone should check with them why the inport of tcl or pygtk is not caught and dealt with appropriately. I talked all this over with William and he agreed with me that this is the right fix for 3.3, but that the issue should be revisited. The spkg at 

  http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/release-cycles-3.3/rc3/matplotlib-0.98.5.3rc0-svn6910.p3.spkg

was merged in 3.3.rc3 and replaced the one mentioned above.

Cheers,

Michael
