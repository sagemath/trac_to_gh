This ticket is to make `LLL_gram` work with more general
Gram matrices than integer ones.

It also speeds up the step where we check the
transformation matrix is orientation-preserving.

The trick for the speedup is computing a determinant mod 3
instead of in `ZZ`: given a matrix `U` over `ZZ` with
determinant known to be -1 or 1, checking whether it is
+1 or -1 is much  faster with `U.change_ring(GF(3)).det()`
than with `U.det()`.)

Making `LLL_gram` work for non-integral Gram matrices
is critical for applications to computing class groups.

That was used in a course William Stein taught in 2009,
at which time he wrote the patch `trac_5178.patch`
attached to this ticket.

Gonzalo Tornaría observed the patch revealed a PARI bug.
The PARI bug was fixed.

This ticket adapts William Stein's 2009 patch to Sage 9.x.

Early discussion of using this function for matrices
over the reals and not just the integers:

Gonzalo Tornaria sent this review in email to me:

```
Looks good to me.

However, it seems pari is hanging when using lllgram() on some
matrices with rational or integer entries; maybe indefinite or
semidefinite matrices are the issue.
Moreover, sage hangs badly on this...

E.g.

sage: pari("[1,1;1,1/2]").qflllgram()

(it also hangs when running equivalent command from gp, Ctrl-C stops
gp but not sage).
[equivalent command = qflllgram([1,1,1,1/2])

However, using 0.5 instead of 1/2 works ok.

Seems a bug in pari, but it was not exposed in sage's LLL_gram() before.

Gonzalo
```

He does point out that bad things can happen, but that the bugs are in PARI, not the new code attached to this patch.

Email from Bill Allombert in response to the bug:

```
Hello,
This problem does not occurs with PARI 2.4.3.
This seems to be another instance of bug #505 which was fixed in
PARI 2.4.1 as

 1- qflll / qflllgram (t_MAT with t_FRAC entries) would not reduce to
    the integer case (--> insufficient precision, SEGV) [#505]

The fix should probably be backported.

Thanks for your bug report,
Bill
```

Nick did ping me last night about updating to pari 2.4.3svn sources and it seems that we don't really have a choice any more. But this issue should be raised on sage-nt I guess.

-This patch changes LLL_gram to work with Gram matrices with not-necessarily integer entries.  Also it fixes several "non-optimal" coding issues both in the old implementation and the doctests.

-Changing LLL_gram to work for nonintegral gram matrices is critical for applications to computing class groups for the course I'm teaching right now.  
+It also speeds up the step where we check the

+
+The trick for the speedup is computing a determinant mod 3
+instead of in `ZZ`: given a matrix `U` over `ZZ` with
+determinant known to be -1 or 1, checking whether it is
++1 or -1 is much  faster with `U.change_ring(GF(3)).det()`

Addressed in the branch.

I agree. William, would you have a few examples from your course?

Since Martin already gave positive review (thanks!),
adding examples could be done in a follow-up ticket.

Possible follow-up improvements:

- Add optional parameter `force_orientation_preserving=True`.
  Setting it to `False` when calling the method would skip
  the last part (that checks whether the determinant is 1 or -1
  and changes the sign of the last column in case it is -1)
  and save some time.

- Maybe PARI has an option to force returning a determinant 1
  transformation matrix? If so, use it.

- Add cross-references in the documentation to/from any similar
  methods, e.g. provided by fplll.
