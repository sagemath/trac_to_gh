On both sage.math (sage 3.2.3) and on my iMac (sage 3.3.alpha1), running

```
matrix(GF(3), 0, 0, {}).rank()
```
is broken: sometimes I get 0, sometimes I get 1, sometimes I get `RuntimeError`. Same goes for 

```
matrix(GF(3), 0, 0, sparse=True).rank()
```
and 

```
matrix(GF(3), 0, 10, sparse=True).rank()
```
For what it's worth, `matrix(GF(3), 10, 0, sparse=True).rank()` seems okay.

I Just discovered this problem, otherwise I would had taken care of it in #5256. This problem is very likely to occur for other kind of matrices. I suggest to expand `test_trivial_matrices_inverse` (from `sage.matrix.matrix_space`) which already tests `det`,`is_invertible` and `inverse` to also test the `rank` method. 

If you need it, I can also investigate further...
