Hello, this command produces one half of a cirle, not 1/4 as excepted.
I think that this is a bug in sage 3.4

Robert

region_plot([y>0,x>0,x^2+y^2<3], (-3, 3), (-3,3),plot_points=100,incol='gray').show(aspect_ratio=1)
```

The attached patch fixes this.

Playing around in the REPL, I don't see a way to define an inequality with explicit variables -- since its not really a function. `f(x) = x^2 < 2` throws an exception, for example. For region_plot, the variables can be made explicit by specifying them in the plot ranges, in which case they are passed on to equify via an argument. So the ambiguity which was the motivation for #5413 can be avoided. I think that this is a subtly different situation, and that `equify` is fine.

The point is that equify lets variables default to None, and in that case, automatically chooses the order of variables in the call signature.  That's what the deprecation is about---making sure that the user always specified the order of evaluation, and not automatically choosing an order.

And while the ambiguity can be avoided in the function call, the doctest in the patch still uses deprecated syntax (which should throw a deprecation warning).  The doctest should still be changed to have the variables specified.
