```
There is a new version of pynac with the following changes:

* Change printing of pi (Pi -> pi)
* Delay evaluation of special functions until .evalf() is called
* Add precision parameter to .evalf()

I am opening a new ticket, since the patches require separate review.

The package is here:

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/burcin/pynac/pynac-0.1.5.spkg

Attached patches need to be applied to Sage, they depend on #5753.

I got an infinite loop trying to convert to `ComplexField` in the second patch, hence the additions to sage/rings/complex_field.py. Robert, am I doing something wrong here?

I put a preliminary version of the new pynac package here:

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/burcin/pynac/pynac-0.1.6.spkg

I haven't actually committed the version information to the pynac repository yet. I plan to wait until this gets reviewed, and see if there are any last minute changes needed.

The newly uploaded patches:

* [attachment: trac_5777-11-hash_doctests.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket5777/trac_5777-11-hash_doctests.patch.gz)
* [attachment: trac_5777-12-pickle_expression.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket5777/trac_5777-12-pickle_expression.patch.gz)
* [attachment: trac_5777-13-pickle_sfunction.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket5777/trac_5777-13-pickle_sfunction.patch.gz)
* [attachment: trac_5777-14-exp.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket5777/trac_5777-14-exp.patch.gz)

correspond to the changes in the new package.

The changes in pynac are:
* Fix error handling in Number_T::hash().
* Add support for archiving numeric and function objects.
* Fix comparison bug in mul.
* Fix gcc warnings about conversion of strings to char*.
* Change exp to not prints exponents of 1.
* Add power method to exp so that `(e<sup>x)</sup>y -> e^(x*y)`.

Note that this fixes #5944, which I consider a blocker.

I have all of Burcin's changes that apply to 4.0.rc0 in symbolics_final1.patch.  These work with the pynac-0.1.6.spkg.

These get a positive review from me.  I've based the new symbolics changes on these.
