REFEREE REPORT

Excellent work Robert! This patch applies to Sage 3.4.1 and the doctests are all valid. There were a number of misspellings which I corrected in 5767-referee.patch (I'm sorry I accidentally attached it twice; use either one). Besides that, I have a few concerns:

* It looks like there are some typos due to copy-and-pasing:
  * On line 446 the documentation for tachyon() says it returns "an x3d input file".
  * On line 1202 the documentation for obj_repr() says it returns "the x3d representation of a group".
  * On line 1230 the documentation for jmol_repr() says it returns "the x3d representation of a group".
* The documentation for jmol_repr on line 657 is somewhat confusing for me, especially when you say that jmol uses the strings to "construct self". Could you replace that with something like "construct a 3D mesh representing this object"? The same concern applies to the documentation for tachyon_repr and obj_repr.
* Do you think it would improve the readability of the documentation to replace "self" with "!`self!`" -- that is, to apply preformatting to it?
* What's up with the trailing spaces on every line?
* On line 730 you use the word "preable". Is this a typo?

I have no clue if this is actually a problem, I just wanted to point out how to avoid problems since this has been an issue with your reviews in the past ;)

> REFEREE REPORT

> Excellent work Robert! This patch applies to Sage 3.4.1 and the doctests are all valid. There were a number of misspellings which I corrected in 5767-referee.patch (I'm sorry I accidentally attached it twice; use either one). Besides that, I have a few concerns:
> 
> * It looks like there are some typos due to copy-and-pasing:
>   * On line 446 the documentation for tachyon() says it returns "an x3d input file".
>   * On line 1202 the documentation for obj_repr() says it returns "the x3d representation of a group".
>   * On line 1230 the documentation for jmol_repr() says it returns "the x3d representation of a group".

Fixed. 

>    * The documentation for jmol_repr on line 657 is somewhat confusing for me, especially when you say that jmol uses the strings to "construct self". Could you replace that with something like "construct a 3D mesh representing this object"? The same concern applies to the documentation for tachyon_repr and obj_repr.

I clarified it.

> * Do you think it would improve the readability of the documentation to replace "self" with "!`self!`" -- that is, to apply preformatting to it?

I'm not sure it's worth it. 

> * What's up with the trailing spaces on every line?

Sorry, I attached another patch that removes this (but I'm not sure if it'll apply cleanly, if not it's probably not worth it). 

> * On line 730 you use the word "preable". Is this a typo?

Yep, I meant preamble. Fixed.

REFEREE REPORT:

Looking over the code again, I noticed a few other instances where "concatenate" was spelled incorrectly. I fixed these in 5767-refree2.patch. With this and Robert's changes, positive review.

(By the way Robert: Mercurial queues is awesome! I made 5767-all.patch with qfold :).)
