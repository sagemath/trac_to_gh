Excellent work Robert! This patch applies to Sage 3.4.1 and the doctests are all valid. There were a number of misspellings which I corrected in 5767-referee.patch (I'm sorry I accidentally attached it twice; use either one). Besides that, I have a few concerns:

* It looks like there are some typos due to copy-and-pasing:
  * On line 446 the documentation for tachyon() says it returns "an x3d input file".
  * On line 1202 the documentation for obj_repr() says it returns "the x3d representation of a group".
  * On line 1230 the documentation for jmol_repr() says it returns "the x3d representation of a group".
* The documentation for jmol_repr on line 657 is somewhat confusing for me, especially when you say that jmol uses the strings to "construct self". Could you replace that with something like "construct a 3D mesh representing this object"? The same concern applies to the documentation for tachyon_repr and obj_repr.
* Do you think it would improve the readability of the documentation to replace "self" with "!`self!`" -- that is, to apply preformatting to it?
* What's up with the trailing spaces on every line?
* On line 730 you use the word "preable". Is this a typo?

Hi Bill, you should **really** always apply against the latest development release. 3.4.1->3.4.2.rc0 was not a large release, but in many other cases there is a rather large, i.e. non-zero chance the patch would either not apply any more or be broken by other changes.

I have no clue if this is actually a problem, I just wanted to point out how to avoid problems since this has been an issue with your reviews in the past ;)
