plot_slope_field(x/y, (x,-2,2), (y,-2,2)).show(aspect_ratio=1)
```
currently won't show the vertical slopes at y=0, x nonzero, but there is no mathematical reason it shouldn't, so this should be fixed.

That said, it'd be great to fix plot_slope_field to detect when you have a vertical slope and have it change things accordingly.  I think this should be easy: just see what vectors have finite X, infinite Y, and set them to be zero X, one Y.
