plot_slope_field(x/y, (x,-2,2), (y,-2,2)).show(aspect_ratio=1)
```
currently won't show the vertical slopes at y=0, x nonzero, but there is no mathematical reason it shouldn't, so this should be fixed.

Yes, so I will change the summary and description of this to fixing plot_slope_field.  The problem is that it will be a sort of messy hack, unless it's dealt with in the plot_vector_field code using a keyword (I attempted to start this), but then you are trying to catch something that looks like (1/inf,inf/inf=NaN), which is a little tricky.
