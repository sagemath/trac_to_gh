Hi,

I try the following in my first cell in a new notebook with sage-3.4
and the latest Ubuntu 64bit os.

------------------------------------
%latex
Try this: $$x^2=-1$$.
------------------------------------
evaluate

An error occured.
Error latexing slide.

-------------------------------------
(new cell)
-------------------------------------

Thats all I get.  I don't get any other latex log output, and it
doesn't write any sage*.dvi files.  I've noticed in the sage-support
```

Then I responded to explicitly pass in the debug option and ...

It's a bug that you didn't get a traceback in the first place.  It's possible thatthis bug was maybe introduced by John Palmieri in this patch:

http://hg.sagemath.org/sage-main/rev/b6c770bd40f8

But it could have also been introduced in a subsequent patch...

This seems to be fixed for me, can someone else test this?

To test - rename a necessary .sty file:

```
$ cd /usr/share/texmf-texlive/tex/latex/amsmath
$ sudo mv amsmath.sty amsmath.sty.BLAH
```

Then trying to execute:

```
%latex
Try this: $$x^2=-1$$.
```

Gives

```
