As discussed at

http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/48b893e904634273

there are two doctests in weierstrass_morphism.py that use symbolic variables.  This is slow, completely unnecessary, and causes trouble given that Maxima has a tendency to hang.

Thanks, Alex.  Patch applies fine to 3.3.alpha5 and tests pass, so positive review (unsurprisingly!).

Note that this only affects docstrings/tests so cannot affect anything else.
