I've been working on getting the Debian build of Sage updated for the current version.  Because of some refactoring in setup.py for the sage spkg, the SAGE_DEBIAN definition no longer works as intended.  The three patches that are attached should fix this, without having any effect on other systems.  It'd be good to get these merged just to bring down the number of patches I have against Sage (future work for this code is to rename SAGE_DEBIAN to something more appropriate).

They need to be applied in order.
