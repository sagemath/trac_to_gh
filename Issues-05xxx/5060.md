using sage 3.2.3, I'm trying to build a new module with a .pxd file containing this line

```
 #include "gmp.h"
```
note that the line is commented. The build fails with the following traceback

```

```

There is probably a problem with the regexp on line 228 of [setup.py](http://www.sagemath.org/hg/sage-main/file/b0aa7ef45b3c/setup.py). One can reprouce the bug with this snipet

```
dep_regex = re.compile(r'^ *(?:cimport +(\S+))|(?:from +(\S+) *cimport)|(?:include *[\'"]([^\'"]+)[\'"])', re.M)
m.groups()for m in dep_regex.finditer('#include "gmp.h"'):                      
    m.groups()                                                        
```
which results in

```
(None, None, 'gmp.h')
```

some more thoughts

1. the include keyword is deprecated [cython doc](http://docs.cython.org/docs/language_basics.html?highlight=include#the-include-statement), 

2. the current regexp misses other cython patterns that involve dependancies:

```
cimport mod1, mod2
```
and

```
cdef extern from "toto.h":
    ....
```
Here is a first attempt to fix this, 

```
import re
dep_regex = re.compile(r'^ *(?:(?:(?:(?:include)|(?:cdef +extern + from)) +[\'"]([^\'"]+)[\'"])|(?:from +(\w+) *cimport)|(?:cimport +([^ \t\n\r\f\v,]+)(?: *, *([^ \t\n\r\f\v,]+))*))',  re.MULTILINE)

teststr = """include "yes1.h"
include "yes2.h" 
 include "yes3.h"
 include 'yes4.h'
#include "no5.h"
 # include "no6.h"
cimport yes7
 cimport yes8 
#cimport no9
# cimport no10
from yes11 cimport toto
from yes12 cimport toto as tata
#from no13 cimport toto as tata
cdef extern from "yes14.h"
cimport yes15 , yes15b
cimport yes16, yes16b
cimport yes17, yes17b , yes17c

"""

print 'toto'
for m in dep_regex.finditer(teststr):
    print m.groups()
```

However, for some reason, it doesn't catch yes14.h nor yes17b. So this is not yet functional (nor elegant). Any suggestion is welcome.

Attachment [5060-deps.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket5060/5060-deps.patch) by @robertwb created at 2009-01-23 13:16:08

The original bug was due to the fact that "^ *" was only required for the first grouping. 

Given that more than one module could be cimported in a single statement, it took an extra loop in the parsing code as well.

Hello, 

reading the code, I see another problem if ones has the following line in its .pyx:

```
cimport mod#mycomment
```
I such a case, we'll look for a dependency mod#mycomment.pxd instead of mod.pxd.

Otherwise, the patch solves the aforementioned problems.

Cheers
