I think this is wrong:

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: f = 30*x
sage: f.factor()
30 * x
```
since in the ring ZZ[] 30 is not irreducible;  it should return 2*3*5*x.


Component: **algebra**

Hi John,

The changes in the patch look fine, but for some reason they make doctests fail in two places: `polynomial_zmod_flint.pyx` (with some errors) and `polynomial_modn_dense_ntl.pyx` (killed after timeout).  I'm rushing to teach right now, but I'll try to investigate afterward.

Hmmm.  We just had this situation happen on a different ticket: the code in this patch is fine but breaks something, which really exposes a pre-existing bug.

In this case, John's code factors the content and the "normalised, content-free" polynomial separately and multiplies the two factorisations.  The problem is the with the types: the first factorisation consists of integers, while the second one consists of polynomials.  Multiplying them together yields a factorisation where some factors are of type integer and the others of type polynomial, and then this breaks all sorts of things later on.

I've made a new ticket at #5928 and will have a patch up there soon.  Then John's patch on this ticket will be good to go.

This is due to a bug in p-adics, more precisely in the content method for p-adic polynomials:

```
sage: P.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: f = x + 2
sage: f.content()
1
sage: fp = f.change_ring(pAdicField(2, 10))
sage: fp
(1 + O(2^10))*x + (2 + O(2^11))
sage: fp.content()
0
```

I have checked and the monster p-adic patch bomb at #5778 doesn't help with this.  I'll see what we can do.

I have replaced my patch with the new version, so one still needs to apply both patches.
