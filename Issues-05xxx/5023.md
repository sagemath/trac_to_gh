The attachment fixes the above typo and two more. However for the last one (tahn -> tanh) I am
concerned about the fact that there was no doctest for the corresponding function.

```
sage: a=tanh(2)
sage: a._algebraic_(QQbar)
...
TypeError: Unable to coerce e (<class 'sage.functions.constants.E'>) to Rational
```
Did I something wrong? If not, a new ticket should be opened.

The patch corrected the typos, so a positive review.

But still

```

Someone more knowledgeable should decide to open a new ticket or not.
