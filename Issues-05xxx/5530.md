RIF has the above methods; it would be nice if CIF did too, defined (like diameter()) as the max of the real and imaginary diameters.

**Keywords:** complex interval field diameter absolute relative

Is that the right definition for relative_diameter?  Another possibility would be the absolute diameter divided by the absolute value of the center of the interval.

For example, a tiny interval centered at 1+eps*I (for tiny eps) would have a huge relative diameter under Nick's definition and a tiny relative diameter under mine.
