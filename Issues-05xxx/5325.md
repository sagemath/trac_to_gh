Hi Jason,

is this all data or also code? 

Optional implies that we actually test this and do some sort of periodic regression testing and unless the demand is there things end up in experimental per default.

Cheers,

Michael

It's both data and code.

It's okay for this to be in experimental.  There was the request for it, and it would be a cool thing to have in Sage.  I'd like to hand off the maintaining of the spkg, but I'm willing to (eventually) create an initial spkg for it.
