I want to use the `GF2X::MinPolySeq` function from my Cython application in Sage, but the function declaration and input data type, vec_GF2, are not included in the current NTL interface shim.

malb, is there a good way to handle the C++ overloading?  For example, in the patch I commented out one of the `put` methods (and I'm not sure if I picked the right one).

You'd have to define two functions:

```
void  (*put_G "put") (long i, GF2_c a)
void  (*put_l "put") (long i, long a)
```

and tell it that they are pointing to the same thing ('put')
