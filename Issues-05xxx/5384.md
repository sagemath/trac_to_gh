There is a new pynac package which includes the fix for this here:

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/burcin/pynac/pynac-0.1.3.spkg

To make the review easier, here is the patch for pynac

REFEREE REPORT



The patch **trac_5384-pynac_compare_add.patch** applied OK against 3.4.alpha0. I upgraded to the new Pynac spkg with this command

```
sage -i -f /path/to/pynac-0.1.3.spkg
```
and ran all doctests with

```
sage -t -long -optional /path/to/devel/sage-main/sage/symbolic/
```
and received these results:

```
sage -t -long -optional "devel/sage-main/sage/symbolic/pynac.pyx"
         [2.8 s]
sage -t -long -optional "devel/sage-main/sage/symbolic/expression.pyx"
         [9.0 s]
sage -t -long -optional "devel/sage-main/sage/symbolic/constants.pyx"
         [0.1 s]
sage -t -long -optional "devel/sage-main/sage/symbolic/ring.pyx"
         [2.1 s]
sage -t -long -optional "devel/sage-main/sage/symbolic/function.pyx"
         [3.2 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 17.0 seconds
```
The above patch adds this new doctest:

```
# check if comparison of constant terms in pynac add objects work 
sage: (y-1)*(y-2) 
(y - 2)*(y - 1)
```
to `sage.symbolic.expression.pyx`, but on #5384 I see this reported bug:

```
sage: var('y', ns=1)
y
sage: (y-1)*(y-2)
(y - 2)^2
```
Just to make sure, again I tested the last 2 lines after having applied the patch and upgraded to the new spkg:

```
sage: var("y", ns=1)
y
sage: (y - 1) * (y - 2)
(y - 2)*(y - 1)
```
Looks to me that the patch and the new spkg fixes the reported problem. So positive review on my part.

I should add that I'm not familiar with Pynac's internals, so someone else should definitely take a look at the diff against the previous version of the Pynac spkg. Because of this, I'm reverting to giving this ticket a partial review, instead of my previous positive review.
