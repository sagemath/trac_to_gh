If one wants to use Sage from a C program, e.g., like this (see below), then it's important that "from sage.all import *" not import Ipython.  The point of this ticket is make the import of IPython lazy -- and only happen if needed.  This will also make "sage -python" and "sage -c" faster, since Ipython startup takes significant time.
