Just delete 
   local/lib/sage-flags.txt

Also, I've opened a blocker ticket about this, since everybody who upgrades will run into exactly the same problem.  

The problem is that the new version of the script that checks the flags doesn't see sse4_1 anymore (nothing in Sage specifically uses that), but it's still in your old sage-flags.txt file.  Two possible solutions:
   (1) delete sage-flags.txt as part of "sage -upgrade"
   (2) make it so sse4_1 is specifically ignored.

I like (1).

The issue with this patch is that the `sage-flags.txt` file will not be regenerated unless sage install directory changes (because `write_flags_file()` is only called from within `install_moved()`.

Maybe the flags file should also be created from the `check_processor_flags()` function. But then, this only works if sage is run at least once after an upgrade.

Otherwise, doing `sage -upgrade` followed by `sage -bdist` ends up with a sage binary with no `sage-flags.txt`, defeating the purpose of the flags file.

I have an alternative fix:

This makes it so that only the flags listed in FLAGS are relevant for `check_processor_flags()`. Thus, after an upgrade, the flag `sse4_1` will still be in the flags file, but it won't be required at runtime.
