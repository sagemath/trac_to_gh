On OSX 10.4 a problem in libgmpxx.la leads to linbox linking gmpxx, mpir **and** gmp at the same time resulting in duplicate symbol errors. The latest upstream release (MPIR 1.0) fixes that.

Spkg coming up.

Cheers,

Extracting the Sage 3.4.rc3 tarball, replacing the gmp-mpir spkg with this "rc4" one (and as only other change replacing the atlas spkg also with the "rc4" version from #5219), Sage builds fine (!) and for "make test" all tests pass.

Tested on my MacIntel OS X 10.4.11 / Xcode 2.5 box / "daily work" installation (but TeX being in the path should be of no concern here).

Cheers, gsw
