With all due respect, the bug was introduced by the author of the patch (me), not the reviewer (you).  You take too much credit :).

This patch looks good, but I haven't applied it or doctested it.  I'm upgrading to 3.3 now to be able to try that.

Really, this should have been caught in a doctest, so another +1 towards getting notebook doctesting working!

The patch applies cleanly and I don't see any errors running the notebook with it applies.  It certainly seems like it would cause errors not to have it applied. Positive review.
