The P1List() constructor for Manin symbols (elements of `P^1(ZZ/NZZ)` was rather inefficient.  It constructed vastly too many symbols, normalised them all and then deleted duplicates.

This is quite unnecessary since it is easy to generate the list with no duplicates (and with simpler code).

As reported on sage-nt:

Before (3.4.1):

```
sage: time P1List(100000)
CPU times: user 3.52 s, sys: 0.03 s, total: 3.55 s
Wall time: 3.55 s
The projective line over the integers modulo 100000
sage: time P1List(1000000)
CPU times: user 129.11 s, sys: 0.64 s, total: 129.75 s
Wall time: 131.96 s
The projective line over the integers modulo 1000000
```

After:

```
sage: time P1List(100000)
CPU times: user 0.41 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 0.42 s
Wall time: 0.42 s
The projective line over the integers modulo 100000
sage: time P1List(1000000)
CPU times: user 8.33 s, sys: 0.12 s, total: 8.45 s
Wall time: 8.80 s
The projective line over the integers modulo 1000000
```

The patch does this for both versions `p1list_int()` and `p1list_llong()`.

I think similar speedups are possible in the p1_normalise functions which would be significant in practice, and will try to get to that tomorrow.

Cool. One question, why are you doing

```
g = arith_int.c_gcd_int(c,N)
if g==c:  # is a divisor
```

instead of simply

```
if N % c == 0:
```

Also, would it be faster to initialize the list with (1, t) for 0 <= t < N (as this is often the bulk of P<sup>1</sup>(Z/nZ)) and then ignore/not compute these ones later?

No good reason.  I just never got around to optimizing the code.

Yes, that would be better.  That's what your g0n library does.  I always wanted that optimization to get implemented.

For the record, on the same machines the previous timings I now get

```
sage: time P1List(10^5)
CPU times: user 0.35 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 0.36 s
Wall time: 0.35 s
The projective line over the integers modulo 100000
sage: time P1List(10^6)
CPU times: user 7.22 s, sys: 0.13 s, total: 7.35 s
Wall time: 7.35 s
The projective line over the integers modulo 1000000
```

Also

```
sage: time P1List(1009*1013)
CPU times: user 7.33 s, sys: 0.02 s, total: 7.35 s
Wall time: 7.36 s
The projective line over the integers modulo 1022117
sage: time P1List(1000003)
CPU times: user 8.25 s, sys: 0.03 s, total: 8.28 s
Wall time: 8.28 s
The projective line over the integers modulo 1000003
```
We could do a lot better if were allowed to factor N: i nthe last example (prime just over `10^6`) there is really nothing to do but it effectively does trial division up to N/5 !

It might be worth having a version which takes as in put as well as N a factorization (as a list of (p,e) pairs.  Or just a list of divisors of N.
which is a worthwhile extra saving.

Robert,

thanks for following up, I did not notice that the review by William was for the first patch only. I did assign reviewer credit to William and you, so now I am waiting on John to tell us in the morning who gets credited for writing the patch (if there is anyone besides him).

Cheers,

Michael

I think I'll take the credit.  Maite and I were looking at the code since we were working out how to do the same over number fields, and I had just written my contribution to sage-nt listing 4 possible methods there.  We noticed the inefficiency together, but I wrote the new code alone.  She can get credit for the number field version when it is ready!
