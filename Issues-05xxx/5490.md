I cannot think of a bank holiday that uses the Julian calendar in any major currency.
Checked Russia but even there they are on the new Orthodox calendar.
What is the preference here-- should I remove Julian?

You should start a discussion on the sage devel list, I think.
There you will find more people who might be interested.

Tests pass:

```
sage -t  "devel/sage-5490/sage/finance/easter.py"           
	 [2.0 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 2.0 seconds
```

I also manually checked the dates (just in case) for the next several years and all three cases seem to hold.

If this module is going to be critical for future libraries, as the ticket description says, then should it perhaps be automatically imported? Just curious.

```
# finance/all.py
...
from easter import easter
```
