I cannot think of a bank holiday that uses the Julian calendar in any major currency.
Checked Russia but even there they are on the new Orthodox calendar.
What is the preference here-- should I remove Julian?

You should start a discussion on the sage devel list, I think.
There you will find more people who might be interested.

Tests pass:

```
sage -t  "devel/sage-5490/sage/finance/easter.py"           
	 [2.0 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 2.0 seconds
```

I also manually checked the dates (just in case) for the next several years and all three cases seem to hold.

If this module is going to be critical for future libraries, as the ticket description says, then should it perhaps be automatically imported? Just curious.

```
# finance/all.py
...
from easter import easter

thank you Chris for checking! 
I think we can safely leave Julian in there -- it doesn't bloat the code, nor does it make the method signature unwieldy.

What's the next step...?

If you mean the next step in this patch getting into Sage: now that it has a positive review, Michael Abshoff will eventually make sure that it merges properly and doesn't cause trouble in unforeseen places, and then it will be in the next release of Sage (either 3.4.1 or 3.4.2).

I don't think easter should be in the global namespace, but in finance.easter.
