I like this patch, but there is a slight doctesting issue:

```
bash-3.00$ ./sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/coding/code_bounds.py
sage -t -long "devel/sage/sage/coding/code_bounds.py"       
**********************************************************************

    sage: plot(f,0,1)
Expected nothing
Got:
    verbose 0 (1365: plot.py, get_minmax_data) ymin was NaN (setting to 0)

```
This is on Solaris and #5779 which RobertWB should have a patch for tonight might then fix the problem. 

Another possibility would be to set verbosity to -1 for this particular doctest, but I would like to avoid that. Positive review for the fix, but I will wait to change the subject once we have dealt with the verbosity.

Cheers,

Michael

Looks good to me. There is another problem unrelated to this in this area of the plotting code, but that is another ticket.
