I know of one place in sage where objects cache their hash for efficiency reasons (e.g., I think Sage matrices do). I hadn't thought about the fact that pickling, moving to an object to a platform where the hashes are different, and unpickling, would result in the subtle issue above, but that makes sense.   Here is an example:

On a 32-bit platform do this:

sage: a = matrix(ZZ,2,[1,-2,4,1993938292]); a.set_immutable(); b = {a:5}; save(b,'/Users/wstein/b.sobj')

Then load b on a 64-bit platform (e.g. ,sage.math):

sage: a = matrix(ZZ,2,[1,-2,4,1993938292]); a.set_immutable(); b = load('b.sobj'); b[a]
boom! KeyError ...
sage: sage: b.keys()[0] == a
True

The fix here is that right before pickling the cached hash of the matrix should be deleted.

I don't know any other places in Sage that do the above.
