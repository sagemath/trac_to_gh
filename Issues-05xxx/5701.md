We currently ship Guava per default in the GAP.spkg. But Guava is limited in functionality, i.e. compared to Magma see http://wiki.sagemath.org/magma#CodingTheory for a list by wdj, and tends to crash at exit, too.  

The following doctests fail when guava is removed from the GAP spkg. 

```
sage -t -long "devel/sage/sage/combinat/combinat.py"
sage -t -long "devel/sage/sage/combinat/designs/block_design.py"
sage -t -long "devel/sage/sage/coding/linear_code.py"
sage -t -long "devel/sage/sage/coding/code_bounds.py"
sage -t -long "devel/sage/sage/coding/code_constructions.py"
sage -t -long "devel/sage/sage/coding/guava.py"
```

I have run tests and checked the code here, and everything seems fine, with the following caveat: I did not run tests on a fresh install, i.e. I ran tests on a system with Guava still installed.

I will give this a positive review, pending the tests passing on a system with the right GAP spkg and workspace setup, and  wdj will follow up on #6094.
