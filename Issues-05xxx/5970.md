At http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/ef01dae47c835137 a memory leak was reported.

Reason for the leak: Many different polynomial rings are created, but used only once. But since we want to have unique parents, they are all cached and thus prevented from deletion.

As Robert pointed out, using weak references enables us to both have unique parents and garbage collection.

With the patch, that should at least apply to sage 3.4.1.rc3, one can do

```
sage: for p in primes(2,1000000):
....:     R.<x,y,z> = GF(p)[]
```
without running into memory problems.

See instead #715.

In case this might help somebody working on this, I've attached a small file with test functions for checking the memory usage for loops with elliptic curve, plane curves, and just polynomial rings.  It should be fairly easy to use:

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Sage Version 3.4.2.rc0, Release Date: 2009-04-30                   |
| Type notebook() for the GUI, and license() for information.        |
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage: attach test.sage
sage: test_poly_leak(2^17)
271.75390625
```

This indicates that the memory usage after the loop is 271MB more than before.

Note also that if you run different tests one after the other you can see, e.g. how much of the leakage in elliptic curves is "independent" of the polynomial ring issue:

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Sage Version 3.4.2.rc0, Release Date: 2009-04-30                   |

----------------------------------------------------------------------

sage: test_poly_leak(2^17)
271.73046875
sage: test_ec_leak(2^17)

Again sorry. Since I thought it is almost trivial, I concluded it could easily be in the next distribution.

If weak references break cython code at a very fundamental level then I see *no chance* for my approach to work, unless Cython changes.

Won't fix, then?

Hehe, I hope you will remember this now :)

This stems from long experience that every even trivial fix has a non-zero chance of breaking things. Weak references are particularly troublesome in this context. And 3.4.2 was supposed to be out two days ago and now William and I will fix the last couple issues today and push out 3.4.2.final, so no potentially risky patches. I can valgrind this in some 4.0.alphaX (assuming the segfaults go away).

No, as mentioned in sage-support RobertWB pointed out some other ticket as guideline to what is wrong.

This patch does not fix the problem the reported in the thread at http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/t/ef01dae47c835137 reported, but it seems to fix something else or is part of the fix to get #5949 resolved, so lets keep this open for now. It seems to be a valuable patch.

Michael

  Caution: Because a WeakKeyDictionary is built on top of a Python dictionary, it must not change size when iterating over it. This can be difficult to ensure for a WeakKeyDictionary because actions performed by the program during iteration may cause items in the dictionary to vanish “by magic” (as a side effect of garbage collection).

Can this be part of the trouble with my patch?

Hi!

I almost forgot this ticket. But now, it hit me while working at #7580 (I had the impression I got a memory leak there, but in fact the Polynomial Ring cache just contains more and more unused items).

Martin, since your patch is quite different from my original suggestion, I guess that I am allowed to be referee? Or must it be someone else?

Cheers,
Simon

This is not a review yet, but some first tests.

There is some progress. Consider the following code snipped (slightly modifying Alex' code):

```
def test_poly_leak(upper):
    a = get_memory_usage()
    c = 0
    for p in prime_range(upper):
        c+=1
        R.<x, y, z> = PolynomialRing(GF(p), 3)
    b = get_memory_usage()
    return (b - a)/c
```

So, the average memory allocation for each created polynomial ring is counted.

Result on sage.math:

```
sage: attach test.sage
sage: test_poly_leak(100000)
0.03225588380942452
```
which I can confirm on my computer with original 4.3.rc0.

With the patch, one has

```
sage: attach test.sage
sage: test_poly_leak(100000)
0.0072749426605504585
```

I did not yet try to crash the patch intentionally. However, I did some indirect stress tests. Namely, I did some series of random examples of Symmetric Groebner bases (this is about infinite polynomial rings, see #7580). Here, many *finite* polynomial rings are created. There was no segfault or so, which I take as a good sign. 

So long,

Simon

Hi!

Taking the `test.sage` file, modifying it by scaling the output by the number of examples, I obtain with sage-4.3.2:

```
sage: attach test.sage
sage: %time test_poly_leak(10^5)
CPU times: user 9.38 s, sys: 0.24 s, total: 9.62 s
Wall time: 9.63 s
0.032462354696622182
sage: %time test_ec_leak(10^5)
CPU times: user 39.26 s, sys: 0.26 s, total: 39.51 s
Wall time: 39.52 s
0.021538141944734097
sage: %time test_pc_leak(10^5)
CPU times: user 14.63 s, sys: 0.05 s, total: 14.68 s
Wall time: 14.70 s
0.0056423158621768136
```
With the patch (that applies, though with a warning), I obtain:

```
sage: attach test.sage
sage: %time test_poly_leak(10^5)
CPU times: user 8.01 s, sys: 0.07 s, total: 8.08 s
Wall time: 8.12 s
0.0073502821361551294
sage: %time test_ec_leak(10^5)
CPU times: user 49.45 s, sys: 0.34 s, total: 49.79 s
Wall time: 49.86 s
0.047167052267987487
sage: %time test_pc_leak(10^5)
CPU times: user 14.94 s, sys: 0.08 s, total: 15.02 s
Wall time: 15.08 s
0.005620324880108424
```
Now that's kind of strange. In one of the three tests, there is an improvement in both memory and CPU consumption, in one example more or less nothing changes, and in one example there is a regression in both memory and CPU.

At least, for quite a while I did heavy polynomial computations, involving the temporary creation of many polynomial rings. It never crashed.

So, I would give it a positive review, if there wouldn't be the regression in one of the tests.

Can you explain why this regression occurs?

Best regards,

Simon

I'd like to revive that ticket.

With `sage-4.6.2.alpha0` and the tickets from #8611, #10467 and #10496 (all with positive review), I obtain:

```
sage: attach test.sage
sage: %time test_poly_leak(10^5)

CPU times: user 13.24 s, sys: 0.04 s, total: 13.29 s
Wall time: 13.29 s

```


Additionally applying Martin's patch from here, one has

```

CPU times: user 13.64 s, sys: 0.03 s, total: 13.68 s

```

So, the situation has not changed: We need to look into the elliptic curves code.

Now I really wonder whether this ticket is relevant at all.

If I understand correctly, the purpose of this ticket is to use weak references, so that unused polynomial rings can be removed from the cache. But the "test suite" in `test.sage` is not affected from the length of the cache:

```
sage: attach test.sage
sage: from sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_ring_constructor import _cache
sage: len(_cache)
16
sage: %time test_poly_leak(10^5)
CPU times: user 11.06 s, sys: 0.13 s, total: 11.18 s
Wall time: 11.19 s
330.40625
sage: len(_cache)
9608
sage: %time test_ec_leak(10^5)
CPU times: user 27.01 s, sys: 0.11 s, total: 27.12 s
Wall time: 27.13 s
192.51171875
sage: len(_cache)
9608
```

The memory consumption depends on applying the patch. But `len(_cache)` is the same, with or without the patch.

Also, the original problem

```
sage: for p in primes(2,1000000):
....:     print get_memory_usage()
....:     R.<x,y,z> = GF(p)[]
```
does not seem to be seriously affected by the patch (at least when one has the patches from  #8611, #10467 and #10496 applied on top of `sage-4.6.2.alpha0`.

Thoughts?

This is related with a couple of other tickets that aim at using weak references:

* #11521 uses weak references for the cache of homsets.
* #715, which aims at using weak references for the coercion cache.

I think the whole project only makes sense if *all three* approaches are simultaneously used. Two of them will not be enough.

Currently, I test on top of #11521 and some preliminary patch for #715, whether it is now possible to simply use a `WeakValueDictionary`. If it still doesn't then we should revive Martin's patch.

sage: import gc
sage: from sage.rings.finite_rings.finite_field_base import is_FiniteField
sage: K = GF(151)
sage: predicate = lambda x: is_FiniteField(x) and x.order() == 151
sage: del K
sage: gc.collect()
174
sage: [bla for bla in gc.get_objects() if predicate(bla)]
[]
```

So, prime fields do not seem to leak.

```
sage: from sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_ring import is_MPolynomialRing
sage: K = GF(151)
sage: P = K['x','y','z']
sage: del P
sage: gc.collect()
33
sage: predicate = lambda x: is_MPolynomialRing(x) and x.variable_names()==['x','y','z'] and x.base_ring() is K
sage: [bla for bla in gc.get_objects() if predicate(bla)]
[]
```

So, where does the leak come from??? The example from the ticket description does use polynomial rings over finite prime fields!

Aha!

The combination of a finite field with a polynomial ring seems to reveal the leak:

```
sage: K = GF(next_prime(1000))
sage: p = K.order()
sage: predicate = lambda x: is_FiniteField(x) and x.order() == p
sage: del K
sage: gc.collect()
23
sage: [bla for bla in gc.get_objects() if predicate(bla)]
[]
sage: K = GF(next_prime(1000))
sage: P = K['x','y','z']
sage: del P
sage: del K
sage: gc.collect()
39
sage: [bla for bla in gc.get_objects() if predicate(bla)]
[Finite Field of size 1009]
sage: predicate = lambda x: is_MPolynomialRing(x) and x.variable_names()==['x','y','z']
sage: [bla for bla in gc.get_objects() if predicate(bla)]
[]
```

So, the polynomial ring is gone, but the base ring remains. And I think this is indeed because of the thing tracked at #12215:

* The polynomial ring belongs to the category of algebras over the base ring (at least by #9138, which I have applied), 
* The category is strongly cached (see #12215)
* The category has a reference to its base ring.

So, indeed we absolutely need to have `UniqueRepresentation` use weak references.

There is no duplicate field, because choosing the resolution of a ticket is reserved to people with administrator rights. Apparently you have these rights, but I haven't.

True, but you forget one important step: you should put the milestone to sage-duplicate/invalid/wontfix yourself, so I know the intention is to close this ticket as duplicate and no patch should be merged.

Nobody except for the release manager should close or reopen tickets (with a few exceptions like spam tickets, tickets marked as duplicate by the person who reported the ticket and with no other activity).

And if it's a duplicate, it would be nice to add a pointer in the description to the ticket of which it is a duplicate of.
