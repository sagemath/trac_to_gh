```
The multifactorial method on integers is different than the one at http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Multifactorial.html and http://www.research.att.com/~njas/sequences/A007661; unless there are multiple competing definitions of multifactorial, this is a bug.

(The references give, for example, (5).multifactorial(3) == 10, whereas Sage currently returns 5.)

There are further problems: k is assumed to be a C-int. Hence,

```
sage: a=2^64
sage: a.multifactorial(a)
```
doesn't work, whereas the appropriate value, a, would be no problem to represent.

How badly do people need these numbers? for which ranges should the computation be optimized? The current implementation can easily be adjusted to give answers that agree with the definition elsewhere, fairly efficiently, for ranges where k fits easily in a "long".

Indeed, the current implementation refuses to compute the multifactorial if n itself doesn't fit in a long. The claim in the current error message, "This is probably OK, since the answer would have billions of digits." is not quite true: if the number of digits is about (n/k) times the number of digits in n, so as long as n/k isn't too large, there isn't really an issue. It may well be that applications of multifactorial never venture in those ranges, though.

I think the problem is that not enough factors are included.  Actually, there are two problems: in the base case, it should return n, not 1; that is, make this change:

```
         # base case
         if 0 < n < k:
-            return ONE
+            return n
```
After making this change, I'm still getting the wrong answers for `a.multifactorial(3)` whenever a is congruent to 2 mod 3 (except for a=2), and for `a.multifactorial(4)` whenever a is congruent to 2 or 3 mod 4 (except for a=2,3).  It seems that not enough factors are used; for example, 10.multifactorial(4) should be 10 x 6 x 2 = 120, but Sage computes it as 10 x 6 = 60.

If we fix this, we can put in doctests like the following:

```
sage: L = sloane_sequence(6882)[2]  # optional - internet
Searching Sloane's online database...
sage: all([Integer(a).multifactorial(2) == L[a] for a in range(1,20)])    # optional - internet
True
```

But one should definitely document that there isn't a universally agreed-upon definition.

Can you indicate what one would change in integer.pyx?   Changing things that seem right yield horrible allocation errors.

A few notes:
- Python is notoriously (and if you believe some of Guido's commentary basicaly intentionally so) bad at recursion, so you should avoid it unless your really need it. Here you don't (and the current implementation carefully avoids deep recursion)
- The current implementation does quite a bit of balancing of factors to ensure good multiplication performance. From what I see on your github branch, you've tacked on a new recursion case to what is called "reflection" there, essentially making the main body (everything below it) unreachable. That code looks like it's pretty carefully written. If you want to throw it out you should do so (and not just leave it in there as unreachable code) but then you should back up your proposal with some serious timings that show your code performs better under all circumstances.
- Whenever you make a change like this you should adjust the documentation as well, ensuring that the new behaviour is reflected in the documentation and is properly tested (probably adding some new tests that differentiate between old and new behaviour.
- Github presently really only is a mirror of the sage repository. It isn't really used for development. So before a change can be considered for inclusion, your change should be uploaded as a git branch here (using the `git-trac` command, probably).

I suspect that the appropriate change to make is in line 3967:

```diff
-         for i from 1 <= i <= n//k:
+         for i from 0 <= i <= n//k:
```
but I didn't check in detail.

 The multifactorial method on integers is different than the one at http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Multifactorial.html and http://www.research.att.com/~njas/sequences/A007661; unless there are multiple competing definitions of multifactorial, this is a bug.
 
 (The references give, for example, (5).multifactorial(3) == 10, whereas Sage currently returns 5.)

+There are further problems: k is assumed to be a C-int. Hence,

+```
+sage: a=2^64
+sage: a.multifactorial(a)

+doesn't work, whereas the appropriate value, a, would be no problem to represent.
+
+How badly do people need these numbers? for which ranges should the computation be optimized? The current implementation can easily be adjusted to give answers that agree with the definition elsewhere, fairly efficiently, for ranges where k fits easily in a "long".

+Indeed, the current implementation refuses to compute the multifactorial if n itself doesn't fit in a long. The claim in the current error message, "This is probably OK, since the answer would have billions of digits." is not quite true: if the number of digits is about (n/k) times the number of digits in n, so as long as n/k isn't too large, there isn't really an issue.

Currently, the code is nicely interruptable with CTRL-C if a particularly long computation was being done. Does your code have that property? (you stripped out the `sig_on/sig_off`. On the other hand you revert to using (python?) integers instead of using gmp directly, so perhaps interrupts get enabled in that code)

Currently, the code is taking efforts to balance the size of the factors it was multiplying. This is a well-known technique to improve performance, because it reduces the number of multiplications where a particularly big number is involved (currently there is a 32/64 bit bug in that code, by the way) You strip that out. Do you have data to confirm this is not a problem?

You may want to try things like

```
sage: %timeit 10000001.multifactorial(2)
1 loops, best of 3: 8.47 s per loop
```
and possibly with larger numbers too. You should compare the current implementation with the new one.

Congratulations on getting a branch attached. Todo list:
- make sure documentation is changed to reflect new behaviour and include doctests that confirm it
- clean up your branch: as you can see in the diffs: `52 files changed, 7057 insertions, 5 deletions`. That's due to your "Merge" commit.

Since the intended change only touches 4 lines, it's probably easier to start with a fresh copy of current "develop", make the edits. and commit that. Then you need no merging at all.

Also note that, as was remarked previously, the original behaviour of multifactorial was consistent with the description in its documentation. So, by changing the behaviour but not the documentation you are basically introducing a bug. Ideally you'd include a reference to a literature source to document which convention you are following, along with a description of what the routine in sage does.

Can I change the definition to 
" Computes the k-th factorial `n!^{(k)}` of self. For k=1
  this is the standard factorial, and for k greater than one it is
  the product of every k-th terms down from self to the smallest possible positive integer. 
  The recursive definition is used to extend this function to the negative integers."
Is this look fine ?

Some people have complained about using "self" in the docstring, and they have a point: in the call
`10.multifactorial(3)` there is never any mention of "self". I think it can be avoided here. Your description in words is pretty good, but requires careful reading to pry out the base cases. That might be difficult for non-native speakers. Perhaps

```
Returns the k-th multifactorial.

The k-th multifactorial n, denoted by n!^{(k)}, as implemented in Sage
 is defined by

n!^{(k)} = n for 1 <= n < k and
n!^{(k)} = n * ( (n-k)^{(k)} for n >= k

The recursive definition is used to extend this function to the negative
integers.
```

You'd have to figure out how to ensure that the formulas are rendered acceptably in all output formats of the sage documentation, though.

That said, your proposal is in the style of the current docstring, so I don't think a positive review would be held back by it.

Note that one of the doctests illustrates the behaviour:

```
      sage: 23.multifactorial(2)
      316234143225
      sage: prod([1..23, step=2])
      316234143225
```
It would be very instructive if you would change the parameters there to a case that distinguishes between the old and the new behaviour.
