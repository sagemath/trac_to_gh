Please email sage-devel http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel
explaining the problem and send the relevant part of

If you want to try to fix the problem, yourself *don't* just cd to

Instead type "/Users/was/build/sage-3.4.rc0/sage -sh"

(When you are done debugging, you can type "exit" to leave the
subshell.)

After futzing around with the spkg-install script, it seems that polymake depends on the system installation of perl. It doesn't build on Mac OS X because it can't find `Config.h` from the system perl installation.

I've packaged the current polymake 2.12 here:

http://www.stp.dias.ie/~vbraun/Sage/spkg/polymake-2.12.p0.spkg

It doesn't compile because it requires more than just our cropped boost. You can't even use the system boost install (on Fedora 16) because it conflicts with our boost version. See also https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-devel/s5FftN1hPB0/discussion
