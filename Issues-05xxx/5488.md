After futzing around with the spkg-install script, it seems that polymake depends on the system installation of perl. It doesn't build on Mac OS X because it can't find `Config.h` from the system perl installation.

Do we need a development version of perl or perl sources installed to build polymake?

Volker, can you put your spkg up on a working link?  http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/vbraun/spkg/ seems appropriate.  Unfortunately the spkg link at #13768 also isn't working :( so it would be quite hard to test #14116.
