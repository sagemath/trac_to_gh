```
Currently, if A has an action on B (where B is not an A-module) one  
implements either a._l_action_ or b._r_action_. This is because  
sometimes it makes sense to put the method on the actor (e.g. Galois  
groups acting on field elements) and sometimes on the acted on (e.g.  
matrices acting on quadratic forms). However, the _x_action_ is hard  
to remember and doesn't always correspond to right/left actions. This  
may be why they're hardly used up to this point.

The proposal is to make the methods a._act_on_(b, self_on_left) and  
b._acted_upon_(a, self_on_left). In other words, a*b would try  
"a._act_on_(b, True)" and "b._acted_upon_(a, False)".

<a id='comment:6'></a>Hi Robert,

Sorry for hopping so late in the discussion. I am not sure how I understand how left vs right actions are handled.

In a*b, are you always making the assumption that a is acting on b?

If I have an algebra B (whose code I don't want to touch), and implement a right B-module A,
am I supposed to implement:

   a.act_on(b)?

Or will a*b try all of:

   b.act_on(a, False)
   b.acted_upon(a, False)
   a.act_on(b, True)
   a.acted_upon(b, True)

Ok. Then I would prefer:

a.act_on_left(b)
b.act_on_right(a)
a.acted_upon_right(b)
b.acted_upon_left(a)

which makes it easier to implement independently the left and right actions on a module, and possibly override just one or the other in a subclass.

That being said, we can leave things as is. Those modules for which left and right action do not coincide can later implement a.acted_upon(...) by delegating the work to
acted_upon_left and acted_upon_right.
