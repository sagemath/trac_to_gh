From David Roe, reviewing #1367:

I'm not completely convinced that the following example is the behavior we want:

```

sage: K.<a> = NumberField?(ZZx?.05 + 2, 'a') 
sage: L.<b> = K.extension(ZZx?.02 + 3*a, 'b') 
sage: u = QQu?.gen() 
sage: t = u.parent()t?.gen()

sage: L(u*5) 5*b
```
I guess if we're going to convert at all this makes the most sense, but I want to think about it a bit more. I'm even less convinced of the following:

```
sage: W.<w> = t.parent()[] 
sage: L(w*5) 5*b 
sage: L(W(t)) 5*a 
sage: L(W(u)) TypeError?
```
