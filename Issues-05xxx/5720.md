Along the lines of #5681: this patch makes the "new worksheet" button open up in a new tab.

Note that the new system with this patch (or even just with #5681) is not perfect: if you open up a worksheet, work for a while, then hit "Save & Quit" or "Discard & Quit", you now have two tabs open listing your active worksheets.
