```
A.<Y> = QQ[]
R.<X> = LaurentPolynomialRing(A)
matrix(R,2,2,[X,0,0,1])
```
gives a

```
TypeError: Unable to coerce X (<type 'sage.rings.polynomial.laurent_polynomial.LaurentPolynomial_mpair'>) to Rational
```

The same problem occurs with `LaurentSeriesRing`, but not with `PowerSeriesRing`.

I have not tried to chase where the problem actually comes from.

Component: **commutative algebra**
