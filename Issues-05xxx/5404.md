Now we have sqrt(a, prec=1000). Also, it doesn't even do what it says.

It would be good to mention the deprecation in the docstring of the function as well.

We could also change the doctests, which test the wrong function now anyway, to demonstrate using sqrt with the prec parameter.

The deprecation message doesn't make sense to me:

```
sage: sqrt(10.1, prec=5)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: sqrt() got an unexpected keyword argument 'prec'
```

We also need some doctests in the sqrt function in calculus/calculus.py using all of the advertised arguments.

Okay, I think with #6171, my main complaint is taken care of.  Here's a new patch; the only difference is the docstring.  The code gets a positive review from me, so if you're happy with my docstring, give the ticket a positive review.

This depends on #6171, not to apply and to pass doctests, but in the sense that the deprecation message is inaccurate without #6171.
