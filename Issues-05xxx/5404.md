Now we have sqrt(a, prec=1000). Also, it doesn't even do what it says. 

```
sage: numerical_sqrt(3)
sqrt(3)

It would be good to mention the deprecation in the docstring of the function as well.

We could also change the doctests, which test the wrong function now anyway, to demonstrate using sqrt with the prec parameter.

The deprecation message doesn't make sense to me:

```
