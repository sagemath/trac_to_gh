The methods simple_roots(), fundamental_weights() and simple_coroots() for the ambient space of a root system are supposed to return a family. This was never correctly implemented for the reducible types, and the patch corrects this.

There are also some changes in weyl_characters.py, where it was assumed that the root system was irreducible in a few places. The patch corrects this.

The patch trac_5831.patch supercedes reducible.patch. It goes on top of trac_5751-rebased-3.4.1.rc4.patch.

Sounds good to me.
Is it needed to implement simple_roots? I would have expected the default implementation
for ambient spaces (as coroots associated to the simple roots) to work.

Replying to the last message, I think it is necessary to implement simple_roots (and also simple_coroots and fundamental_weights).

Nicolas requested a doctest. See:

http://groups.google.com/group/sage-combinat-devel/msg/4004c4a8471f3cfa?hl=en&pli=1

I did this. I put the new doctest in type_reducible.py.

Oops, sorry for the confusion. I was wondering wether it was necessary to implement the simple *coroots*.
For the roots, definitely yes.
