```
The methods simple_roots(), fundamental_weights() and simple_coroots() for the ambient space of a root system are supposed to return a family. This was never correctly implemented for the reducible types, and the patch corrects this.

There are also some changes in weyl_characters.py, where it was assumed that the root system was irreducible in a few places. The patch corrects this.

The patch trac_5831.patch supercedes reducible.patch. It goes on top of trac_5751-rebased-3.4.1.rc4.patch.

Sounds good to me.
Is it needed to implement simple_roots? I would have expected the default implementation
for ambient spaces (as coroots associated to the simple roots) to work.

Oops, sorry for the confusion. I was wondering wether it was necessary to implement the simple *coroots*.
For the roots, definitely yes.
