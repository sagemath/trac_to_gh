<mabs> It can be reproduced on the farm, i.e. the FC10 test box.
<mabs> wstein can create you an account. 
<mhansen> Actually, it don't think we need that.  [17:14]
<mhansen> It most likely comes from this line in cartan_type.py
<mhansen>         if other.__class__ != self.__class__:
<mhansen>             return cmp(self.__class__, other.__class__)
<mhansen> 
<mabs> So you think it is a bug?  [17:15]
<mhansen> Well, I think there are no guarantees on the results of class
          comparisons.
<mhansen> I would be fine with just changing that doctest since the order of
          the types doesn't really matter.  [17:17]
<mhansen> What matters most is deciding if they are equal or not.
