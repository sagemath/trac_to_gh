Following #4688 which wrapped the pari functions ideallog and idealstar, we need to provide functions which access these cleanly from Sage's NumberField and NumberFieldFractionalIdeal classes.

Maite Aranes and John Cremona are working on this and will post a patch based on 3.3 + #4688.

At risk of being really ridiculously pedantic: there's a typo in the new docstring for invertible_residues_mod_units (and invertible_residues): "represnting".

Also, as for our terminological confusion, I think that the whole thing can be explained more clearly by *not* distinguishing between "units" and "invertible residues". You're clearly thinking of taking the quotient of a local unit group by the image of a subgroup of the global units; but the function as coded here works perfectly well for finding any quotient of the form (O_K / I)^* / U where U is an arbitrary subgroup of (O_K / I)^*. E.g.

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x - 1)
sage: I = K.ideal(5)
sage: list(I.invertible_residues_mod_units([4]))
[1, 2]
```

The fact that 4 isn't a unit in K is no problem. And this makes it easier to avoid getting tied up in terminological knots: we can now just drop all mention of "units", and call it "invertible_residues_mod", with the docstring

"Returns an iterator through a set of representatives for the group of invertible residues modulo this ideal, modulo the subgroup generated by the elements in the list u."

I think I've tortured you (and Maite) enough now: I'll write a patch myself for this change, and if you agree it's OK we'll call it a +ve review. 

(I'll also fix a micro-bug: the invertible_residues function ignores its second argument -- it always calls invertible_residues_mod_units with reduce = True.)
