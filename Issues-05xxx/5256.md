There where a lot of inconsistency and bugs in the handling of trivial matrices.
The following patch aims to solve these and to check systematicly the coherence. Here is a selection of weirdness:
* plain wrong answers

```
sage: m = matrix(SR, 1,1, [1])
sage: m.inverse()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

sage: m = matrix(RDF, 0,2)
sage: m.inverse()
[]
```
* Inconsistencies in the answers depending on the base ring

```
sage: m = matrix(RDF, 1,1)
sage: m.inverse()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
LinAlgError                               Traceback (most recent call last)
```
   whereas

```
sage: m = matrix(QQ, 1,1)
sage: m.inverse()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ZeroDivisionError                         Traceback (most recent call last)
```

Aside rewriting some error messages, changing some exception and working around several bug in particular in maxima's handling of matrix over SR, the main contribution of this patch lies in the function `test_trivial_matrices_inverse` in `sage/matrix/matrix_space.py` and its associated doctests. Trough a bunch of assertions this function indirectly checks the behavior of matrix spaces. Any new implementation of a kind of matrices should be checked be this function.

I'm really happy you did all this.  I'll look at this soon, unless someone else gets to it before me.

It'd be great to have a system-wide function that tested different Sage types for consistency on things like this.  That way, all someone would have to remember to do is add their new sage type to a doctest like:

```
sage: check_consistency(MY_NEW_TYPE)
True
```

That function would automatically call things like the function in this patch and other functions for vectors, polynomials, etc.

Attachment: **[empty_matrix_inverse-fh.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket5256/empty_matrix_inverse-fh.patch.gz)**

**Review**
patch looks good except
* typo: "seld" -> "self" (2402)
* docstring INPUT block of `test_trivial_matrices_inverse` does not conform to Sage's conventions
* "TODO: must be adapted to Nicolas check framework (see trac FIXME)." The FIXME should probably be addressed

i.e. all issues are trivial.

I didn't run doctests yet, will do now.

Done ! See the new patch. 

Note that I currently didn't had time to check it. It's currently being done on my machine but it takes times. I only change docs from the first version but who knows...
