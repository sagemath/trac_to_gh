The Sage `.<a>` notation doesn't properly deal with `time foo`.

```
sage: time K.<a> = GF(9)
------------------------------------------------------------
   File "<timed exec>", line 1
     K = GF(Integer(Integer(9)),names=(u'a',)); (a,) = time K._first_ngens(Integer(1))
                                                            ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

Note that the Ipython magic %time works fine:

```
sage: %time K.<a> = GF(9)
CPU times: user 0.11 s, sys: 0.09 s, total: 0.19 s
Wall time: 2.17 s
```

Hi Robert,

this patch is either not the right one or something else went wrong since it does not apply:

```
mabshoff@sage:/scratch/mabshoff/sage-3.3.rc1/devel/sage$ patch -p1 --dry-run < 5106-preparse-gens.patch 
patching file sage/misc/preparser.py
Hunk #7 FAILED at 739.
Hunk #8 FAILED at 825.
2 out of 8 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file sage/misc/preparser.py.rej
```

At SD 12 there were some issues merging the preparser patches including #4405, so it sounds like a very good idea to rebase this against 3.3.rc1 which will be out by the time you get this email on Monday :).

Cheers,

Michael
