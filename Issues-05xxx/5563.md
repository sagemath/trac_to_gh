REFEREE REPORT



The patch **sloane_find_optional.patch** applies OK against Sage 3.4. All tests passed, both on machines with and without Internet connection. Just to be on the safe side, I rebuilt the HTML version of the whole reference manual; rebuilding went fine as expected on machines with and without Internet connection. Positive review.
