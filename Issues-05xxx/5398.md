```
From my newly built 3.4.alpha0 I made a clone but it will not run, 
complaining about things like this: 

SyntaxError: Non-ASCII character '\xc3' in file 
/home/john/sage-3.4.alpha0/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages
/sage/combinat/sloane_functions.py 

on line 6381, but no encoding declared; see 
http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0263.html for details 
(sloane_functions.py, line 6380) 

That one is Mobius, spelled Mo"bius (with an o-umlaut character). 
And before that I had a problem with Gro"bner in interfaces/singular.py.
 
Is this somehow caused by the ReST/Sphinx stuff?  It is hard to 
review  patches when clones don't run...
