Timings:

```
sage: a=Bitset([3*i for i in range(100)])
sage: b=Bitset([4*i for i in range(100)])
sage: d=set([4*i for i in range(100)])
sage: c=set([3*i for i in range(100)])
sage: %timeit a|b
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.55 µs per loop
sage: %timeit c|d
100000 loops, best of 3: 17.6 µs per loop
sage: %timeit a-b
100000 loops, best of 3: 1.53 µs per loop
sage: %timeit c-d
100000 loops, best of 3: 10.4 µs per loop

So I guess we have a pretty good data structure.  And this is even accessing it with python!
