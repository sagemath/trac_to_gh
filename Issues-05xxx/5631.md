I don't understand why you deleted lines 415, 416 below:

```
414	505	    def subscheme_complement(self, X, Y): 
415	 	        X = self.subscheme(X) 
416	 	        Y = self.subscheme(Y) 
```

The way you have the code now, it subscheme_complement has nothing at all to do with self.  Why is it even a method of self as is now.  

Otherwise this patch looks very good.

I had two problems with lines 415 and 416: (1) the doctest that I wrote wasn't working and (2) they aren't there in the corresponding method in `projective_space.py`.  If you look at the docstring that I wrote for `subscheme_complement` (and the doctest), you will notice that X and Y are already subschemes of self (so self is involved in a slightly hidden way).

I guess that one could relax the syntax so that polynomial lists can be passed to `subscheme_complement`; in the example of the doctest this would be

```
sage: A.<x, y, z> = AffineSpace(3, ZZ)
sage: A.subscheme_complement([x+y-z], [x-y+z])
```

Is this what you have in mind?

Couldn't I do this:

```
sage: A.<x, y, z> = AffineSpace(3, ZZ)
sage: [[make an X and a Y over GF(7) say that haven't nothing to do with A]]
sage: A.subscheme_complement(X, Y)
```

Either subscheme_complement needs to check that X and Y are really subschemes of A, or it should just be a method of X, i.e.,

```
sage: X.complement(Y)
```
say, which requires that X and Y live in a common ambient space.
