Consider this situation:

```
sage: f = ModularForms(28,2).q_expansion_basis()[-1]
sage: f
q^7 + O(q^20)
```

At this point, I would like to be able to do f.padded_list() and have this take f.prec() as default parameter.  It's not a big deal, but it would be more convenient than having to type f.padded_list(f.prec()).  There might be other situations (power series in general, for instance?) where this change could also be made.

I'll have a patch up for this soon.

In fact, `padded_list` is actually inherited from power series.
