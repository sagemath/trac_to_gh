That's terrible!  This is now:

The safest is clearly

    return self.value().__nonzero__()

But this can be very expensive.     Always returning true would be excellent,
but if we do that we need to put a test in the Factorization constructor that
all the "primes" are nonzero.  That would be reasonable, especially if you put
a check=False option in, so one can skip checking nontriviality of the primes
for speed reasons.

Maybe they should have a parent...
