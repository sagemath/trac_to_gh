I think just the CSS3 official colors should be sufficient.  Are the names the same for the intersection between CSS3 and X11 colors?  I like the idea of using .lighter and .darker.

We should also have several lists of colors (like the predefined cmaps in matplotlib) that go well together, so you can do

colors.winter[0]

colors.winter[1]

etc. for a nice set of colors that go well together.

The attached patch should add:

* CSS3 / SVG colors - #5601.  Actually, this replaces the previous colors.
* `Color.lighter` and `Color.darker` - #5602.
* HSV and HSL/HLS `Color` constructors - #5605.

Predefined palette:

```python
import sage.plot.colors as cc
p = Graphics()
for i, color in enumerate(cc.colors.keys()):
    x = floor(i / 12) + 1
    y = i % 12 + x * 0.5 + 1
    p += point((x, y), pointsize=500, faceted=True, color=color)
    p += text(color, (x + 0.15, y), rgbcolor='black', fontsize=10, horizontal_alignment='left')
show(p, figsize=[25,10], ymin=0, xmax=14, ymax=19, axes=False)

Oops!  I haven't done this.  Which of matplotlib's [color maps](http://www.scipy.org/Cookbook/Matplotlib/Show_colormaps) should we use?

```python
from matplotlib import cm
summer = []
for i in xrange(cm.summer.N):
    summer.append(tuple(cm.summer(i)[0:3]))
```

`N = 256` for all of them.  Should we make our lists the same length?

How much do we want to invent/wrap things versus just using their classes directly?  Maybe we should just import their colormaps into our color namespace, so people just have to remember colors.winter, rather than having to import matplotlib?

A *really* cool thing we could do with the gradients, though, is somehow helping people pick gradients according to the criteria here:

http://colorbrewer2.org/

(note that lots of the matplotlib color maps came from that website).

Note that on that website, you can easily pick gradients that are color-blind safe, that are safe for photocopying, that are print-friendly, etc.  It would be really cool to have basically the functionality of that flash applet at a user's disposal in Sage.  So, for example:

colors.gradients(num_colors=5,color_blind=True,print_friendly=True)

would return a dictionary of gradients that satisfy the criteria (like clicking the boxes on that flash applet).  Additionally, we should incorporate the recommendations from the phd thesis studying the color-blind aspects of the schemes---see p. 87 of http://www.personal.psu.edu/cab38/ColorBrewer/Steve_Gardner_thesis_PSU.pdf

The following is ad hoc, but it appears to work.  I removed the global import and the code that sets up the module-scope colormaps.  To the *end* of `sage.plot.colors` I added

```python
# matplotlib color maps, loaded on-demand.
class ColormapLoader(object):
    def __init__(self, globs):
        self.cm = None
        for key in globs:
            self.__setattr__(key, globs[key])

    def __getattr__(self, name):
        if name == '__path__':
            return __path__

        if not self.cm:
            print 'loading matplotlib.cm'
            from matplotlib import cm            
            self.cm = cm

        try:
            cmap = self.cm.__getattribute__(name)
        except AttributeError:
            raise AttributeError, 'no colormap with name %s' % name

        self.__setattr__(name, cmap)
        return cmap

colormaps = ColormapLoader(vars())

import sys
sys.modules['sage.plot.colors'] = colormaps
```

From `sage.plot.colors.float_to_html`'s docstring:

```
This may not seem necessary, but there are some odd cases where matplotlib is just plain schizophrenic – for an example, do

sage: vertex_colors = {(1.0, 0.8571428571428571, 0.0): [4, 5, 6], (0.28571428571428559, 0.0, 1.0): [14, 15, 16], (1.0, 0.0, 0.0): [0, 1, 2, 3], (0.0, 0.57142857142857162, 1.0): [12, 13], (1.0, 0.0, 0.85714285714285676): [17, 18, 19], (0.0, 1.0, 0.57142857142857162): [10, 11], (0.28571428571428581, 1.0, 0.0): [7, 8, 9]}
sage: graphs.DodecahedralGraph().show(vertex_colors=vertex_colors)

Notice how the colors don’t respect the partition at all.....
```
Is this still true?  The example appears to work for me, but I could be misinterpreting it.

This is great stuff.

Some initial comments:

 # Lots of doctests are marked #random that shouldn't be (there should be no #random doctests).  Use ... to take care of memory addresses changing, and use sort(dict.items()) to take care of things like dictionaries.

 # .lighter() and .darker() seem to have too little contrast.  Can we make it so that they about double their steps?  In other words, can we make it so that .lighter() does what .lighter().lighter() does in this patch?

 # Interestingly, colors.white.darker() gives gray values, but colors.black.lighter() does not give gray values.

Of these the first is the real technical issue.  Other things are fine-tuning that can be put off to another patch.

I agree.  Let's remove (or at least comment out) the addition stuff right now until we have a better grasp of what we want and how to get it.

I believe MMA just implements a Blend function, and then makes lighter and darker just blending with black or white, and it's also consistent with blending other colors.


> And as for the random doctests... Jason, I think he marked them that way because the default colors and colormaps may change.  But probably that will just be something that should be fixed each time we upgrade matplotlib or something.


I don't think the colormaps in matplotlib have been touched in a long time.  I wouldn't worry too much about having to fix things up very often.  And it's much better to fix it up than to have it not doctested by putting a #random there.

I think MMA just does a weighted average of colors.  In other words, for each component, color1.blend(color2,fraction) would create a new color (1-fraction)*color1+(fraction)*color2.

I thought color1+color2 would be color1.blend(color2,1/2)

MMA then has:

color.lighter() is just color.blend(colors.white,1/3)

color.darker() is just color.blend(colors.black,1/2)

I'm not quite sure what this patch does.

I attached a *rough* patch that implements the mma-style blending, lighter(), and darker().  What do you think?  I don't know that much about color theory, so I don't know what "should" happen, but now colors.yellow+colors.green gives yellowgreenish colors.

According to http://stackoverflow.com/questions/398224/how-to-mix-colors-naturally-with-c/398268#398268, we really want to work in Lab space to mix colors, because then linear changes become linear changes in perception (i.e., Lab is designed so that it is easy to change the perception by a certain amount).

Also, here's some results using alpha values: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/726549/algorithm-for-additive-color-mixing-for-rgb-values

For lightening or darkening, some suggestions here are to convert to hsl or hsv and modify the correct component: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/97646/how-do-i-determine-darker-or-lighter-color-variant-of-a-given-color

So, as always, it is not as easy as it appears at all.  However, it looks like it might be easy to convert to hsl or hsv for the darker/lighter commands pretty easily, especially since we already have functions to do that.
