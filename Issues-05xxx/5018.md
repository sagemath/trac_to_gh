A couple remarks:

* the spkg is missing an hg repo. Please check in everything but src
* SPKG.txt does not conform to the standard - see the SpkgTemplate in the wiki 
* spkg-install needs to be executable
* spkg-check is missing, when you add it please run `make check` with it
* for the make check target: create foo.expected and direct the result from test foo into foo.result. Then diff, i.e. do not create the expected result in the script
* the makefile should have a make install target
* the makefile still uses `gcc -O3 -static` - this should be set via CC and CFLAGS for example

Not all of the above have to be fixed to get a positive review from me, but it would be nice to get those all fixed. The missing hg repo and an updated SPKG.txt should *really* be done.

Cheers,

Michael

I think I have addressed the concerns above, except that I did not add the CC and CFLAGS macros, because I was not sure how to do that for all the compilation cases in the makefile.  The updated version is that the same link as before.

This spkg is enough of an improvement to warrant a positive review. Much remains to be done, but this can be addressed via subsequent spkgs.
