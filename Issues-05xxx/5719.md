Currenctly when calling count on a combinatorial class the deprecation message is:
   
   The usage of iterator for combinatorial classes is deprecated. Please use the class itself

Whereas it should be

   The usage of count for combinatorial classes is deprecated. Please use cardinality

Corrected my patch. Apologies for this mistake. Thanks to Daniel Bump for reporting it.
