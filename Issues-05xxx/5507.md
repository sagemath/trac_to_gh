I think there is a superfluous "shift" in the "sage-sage" script, because this works:

    $ sage -sh -c -c "echo hi there"

    Starting subshell with Sage environment variables set.
    Be sure to exit when you are done and do not do anything
    with other copies of Sage!

    Bypassing shell configuration files ...

    hi there
    Exited Sage subshell.

but this doesn't:

    $ sage -sh -c "echo hi there"

    Starting subshell with Sage environment variables set.
    Be sure to exit when you are done and do not do anything
    with other copies of Sage!

    Bypassing shell configuration files ...

    bash: echo hi there: No such file or directory
    Exited Sage subshell.
