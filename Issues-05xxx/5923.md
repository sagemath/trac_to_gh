The `ModularForms` command has some slightly counter-intuitive behaviour on some types of input:

```
sage: ModularForms(gp(1),12)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError     

[much snipped error message]

TypeError: Error executing code in GP/PARI:
CODE:
        sage[4]=level(sage[3]);
GP/PARI ERROR:
  ***   expected character: ',' instead of: sage[4]=level(sage[3]);
                                                              ^-----
```

I realize that this is because the first element is supposed to be a group, although a (Sage) integer is allowed.

Would there be any support for having an if statement in the function to catch magma or pari elements and transform them into their Sage equivalents?
