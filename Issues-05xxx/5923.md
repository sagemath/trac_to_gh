The `ModularForms` command has some slightly counter-intuitive behaviour on some types of input:

```
sage: ModularForms(gp(1),12)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError     

[much snipped error message]

TypeError: Error executing code in GP/PARI:
CODE:
        sage[4]=level(sage[3]);
GP/PARI ERROR:
  ***   expected character: ',' instead of: sage[4]=level(sage[3]);
                                                              ^-----
```

I realize that this is because the first element is supposed to be a group, although a (Sage) integer is allowed.

Would there be any support for having an if statement in the function to catch magma or pari elements and transform them into their Sage equivalents?

It turns out that the problem is that if x is a gp object, then "x.level" always *exists*: it is a microscopic function wrapper which on being called, executes "level(x)" in gp. Which of course doesn't work. Anyway, I've fixed it by rearranging the ModularForms constructor function a bit, and added a doctest to check that it's fixed.
