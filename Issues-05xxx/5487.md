A few comments:

0. Patches should be included as attachments.

1. content is only well-defined if k appears exactly once in the tableau. How should it work for the following tableau?

```
sage: Tableau([[3,3],[3,3]])
[[3, 3], [3, 3]]
```

2. In case k does not appear in the tableau, perhaps it is better to raise an error?

3. Whatever is decided for 2, it should be documented. You can do this with an OUTPUT section.

This is not exactly a tableau ! :-) I don't know if it's standard but there is a notion of content associated to semi-standard tableau.

When pushing this patch I described it as a content function on standard tableau and then added it to the Tableau class...I'll move it into the StandardTableau class and then all will be well.

The obvious "generalization" of the definition to semistandard tableau is used in the literature but writing the corresponding function is slightly cumbersome because in the classical case you add up the contents of all of nodes labelled k whereas for the q-analogue you add up the q-contents. Perhaps the nicest solution is to define

```
def content(self, k, q=1):
...
```
I have never used contents for tableaux which are not (semi)standard.

> > 2. In case k does not appear in the tableau, perhaps it is better to raise an error?

OK
 
> > 3. Whatever is decided for 2, it should be documented. You can do this with an OUTPUT section.

Thanks.

One last question: is there an easy way to "update" the patch and push it back to the server? Or do I have to somehow delete this patch and then reapply?

Cheers,
Andrew

One slight problem: there doesn't seem to be a StandardTableau or SemistandardTableau class, just a Tableau class. So you'll have to create it, which is not a big deal.

Dear Andrew,

Sorry for bothering you with this first simple patch but before giving a positive review I'd rather see the following first problem fixed. I leave these to you because I understand that you want test the patch workflow. If you want me to fix these please ask. 

1. I agree with Franco's first message: I'd rather raise an error than return False silently. Those `False` or `None` tends to crawl into the programs and to eventually trigger an error at the wrong place. You can always catch the exception if you want. I think `ValueError` is the correct exception (see the similar behavior for list below).

2. I case you don't know, in python, when you have a list `l` the call `l.index(k)` either returns the first position of `k` if it is in the list or raise a

```
ValueError: list.index(x): x not in list
```
maybe it's worth using it ? 

cheers,

Florent

Dear Florent,

I have changed the function to use index() and added an exception. More importantly, I have also created a StandardTableau_class class and a StandardTableau() function for holding and creating standard tableau...previously I was confused and thought that the StandardTableaux class  did this. I discovered my error when I tested the new version (which I confess I had previously just moved into StandardTableaux and not tested...I promise to test properly in future!).

Hopefully the new patch also removes my unintended change to kschur.py.

Regards,
Andrew

I Added a review patch which:

- add some more doctests

- correct the ReST syntax for doctests

- Specifies which exception is caught.

I'm giving the positive review though someone should probably reread my trivial review patch... 

Michael: please tell me if I should not give the review and ask for a formal review of my patch.   

Cheers,

Replying to [@hivert](#comment%3A9):

<SNIP>

Yep. 

> Michael: please tell me if I should not give the review and ask for a formal review of my patch.   

I would consider this review patch non-trivial enough to have someone else take a look since it adds more than a doctest. I looked at the patch and it looks good to me, but I will run doctests before mergin.

Andrew,

I attached trac_5487_tableau-content-5487-AM.patch which is your patch checked in in your name. You attached a diff, but when you used hg queues you to export the patch after committing so that you get credited properly. 

Cheers,

Michael
