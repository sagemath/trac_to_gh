The goal of this ticket is to rewrite QuaternionAlgebra so that it is very very fast.  

Since QuaternionAlgebra is used nowhere else in Sage and much of the code for orders has 0% coverage and is totally broken, and moreover the design of QuaternionAlgebras is a bit odd (according to Gonzalo T. and John Voight), we will remove some functions.   I think deprecation isn't necessary here since this code simply isn't used much if at all by anyone.

Note that the code in sage <=3.3 is between 50 and 250 times slower than Magma on benchmarks I tried... so it's hard to imagine it ever being used for anything.

Assignee: tbd

CC:  bober

Resolution: fixed

I can fix all the doctest failures except

which I don't know how to deal with.

The fix is two one-liners on top of part6

We didn't do quat alg from discriminants for number fields yet.   I'm going to also get rid of "norm" and "trace" and just have "reduced_norm" and "reduced_trace" since even Gonzalo clearly got confused by having both and an alias.

+The goal of this ticket is to rewrite QuaternionAlgebra so that it is very very fast.  
 
+Since QuaternionAlgebra is used nowhere else in Sage and much of the code for orders has 0% coverage and is totally broken, and moreover the design of QuaternionAlgebras is a bit odd (according to Gonzalo T. and John Voight), we will remove some functions.   I think deprecation isn't necessary here since this code simply isn't used much if at all by anyone.
+
+Note that the code in sage <=3.3 is between 50 and 250 times slower than Magma on benchmarks I tried... so it's hard to imagine it ever being used for anything.
 
 Summary: rewrite quaternion algebras -- the current implementation isn't sufficiently good

<a id='comment:10'></a>I found a few issues with jvoight's referee patch, which I'm noting here:

* In inner_product_matrix the docs say: "The standard basis 1, i, j, k is orthogonal, so this matrix is just the diagonal matrix with diagonal entries 1, a, b, a*b."  In the code, though, it's 2,2*a,2*b,2*a*b.  

* Line 475 is:

"and j*i=-i*j.  K is a field not of characteristic and a,b are nonzero elements of K"

but it should say "and j*i=-i*j.  K is a field not of characteristic 2 and a,b are nonzero elements of K"  (the missing 2).

Otherwise the referee patch from jvoight looks very very good!
