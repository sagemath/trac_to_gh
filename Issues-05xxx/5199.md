Consider the following, in 3.3.alpha5:

```
sage: from sage.symbolic.ring import NSR
sage: NSR(10.0).gamma()
362880
```
We have produced an exact integral result of .gamma() on a floating-point number.

After #2898, this behavior makes doctests fail; but the above happens even before #2898.

I don't know if this is the "right" patch, but it does make all doctests pass after #2898.

**Attachment:** [pynac_is_integer.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket5199/pynac_is_integer.patch.gz)

The patch looks good. 

We might think about optimizing this function for speed later. Specialcasing Integer and Rational, and using the _parent attribute should help here.
