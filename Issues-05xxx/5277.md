tachyon - in src/unix/Make-config change -lpng to -lpng12:

```
USEPNG= -DUSEPNG
PNGINC= -I$(SAGE_LOCAL)/include
PNGLIB= -L$(SAGE_LOCAL)/lib -lpng12 -lz
```
We can probably set PNGLIB in spkg-install, so we don't have to edit any build system files.

Spkg coming up. Together with some changes via the libpng update at #5217 this will solve a long standing problem when we run into symbol clashes on OSX with its IOKit.

Cheers,

Michael
