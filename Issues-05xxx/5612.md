This should go into some docs somewhere.  Maybe under solve_right or in a primer?

It's to solve the linear system a*x+b*y=3, c*x+d*y=5.

```
sage: var('a,b,c,d,x,y')
(a, b, c, d, x, y)
sage: A=matrix(2,[a,b,c,d]); A
[a b]
[c d]
sage: result=vector([3,5]); result
(3, 5)
sage: soln=A.solve_right(result) # you could also do soln=A\result
sage: soln
(3/a - b*(5 - 3*c/a)/(a*(d - b*c/a)), (5 - 3*c/a)/(d - b*c/a))


Now, checking our answers:


sage: (a*x+b*y).subs(x=soln[0],y=soln[1]).simplify_full()
3
sage: (c*x+d*y).subs(x=soln[0],y=soln[1]).simplify_full()
5


Or just checking it with matrix multiplication:

sage: A*soln
(a*(3/a - b*(5 - 3*c/a)/(a*(d - b*c/a))) + b*(5 - 3*c/a)/(d - b*c/a), 
c*(3/a - b*(5 - 3*c/a)/(a*(d - b*c/a))) + (5 - 3*c/a)*d/(d - b*c/a))

Let's simplify each entry by applying the "simplify_full" function to 
each entry:

sage: (A*soln).apply_map(lambda x: x.simplify_full())
(3, 5)
```

Make sure to change 

```
matrix(2,[a,b,c,d])
vector([3,5])
```

to

```
matrix(SR,2,[a,b,c,d])
vector(SR,[3,5])
```

since otherwise people get really confused when slight changes lead to breakage (e.g., see sage-support).

Also, I'm concerned about the large number of wishlist-style trac tickets you've been creating lately, like this one.  If everybody made tickets like you're doing it about similar things, trac would soon become unusable.

Well, we're told to make a trac ticket for every item, so I'm also using it as a to-do list for when I have a few minutes.  In reality, I just made this a trac ticket because of the specific request on the sage lists; I wasn't planning on making it a trac ticket originally.  When I have a few minutes, I can just go to tickets that I've created, pick one that fits into the time I have, and make a patch.

I can make them all attached to the wishlist milestone, if that's better.

I was going to make all the color items a single ticket, but then I remembered the rebukes I've received about lumping too much together on a ticket...
