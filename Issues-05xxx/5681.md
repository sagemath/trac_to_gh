I'm so so so SICK (!) of accidentally hitting the back button and corrupting my worksheet.  It happens to me and everybody constantly. It's horrible and confusing.  The attached trivial 1-line patch makes it so when open a worksheet it appears in a new tab (or windows), hence there is *no history*, hence nothing to accidentally go back to.
