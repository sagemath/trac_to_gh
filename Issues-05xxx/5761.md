There are some `True, False` and `None` not surrounded by <code>\`\`</code>.

After

```
"\\ZZ[x]
```
in

```
EXAMPLES::

    # sage: latex.eval("\\ZZ[x], locals(), filename="test") # This would generate a file named "test.png"
    # ''
    # sage: latex.eval("\\ZZ[x], locals(), filename="/path/to/test") # This would generate a file named "/path/to/test.png"
    # ''
```
a " is missing, otherwise the command will fail. You can use *# not tested* at the end of the line instead of commenting out the examples.

Everything else looks good to me.

Could you add an additional patch to fix the trac reference in `repr_lincomb()`:

```
Verify that a certain corner case works (see trac 5707 and 5766)::
```
and in `latex_varify()`:

```
if "is_fname" flag is True or False.

You added one trailing whitespace after "An error"

An error

But I think it's no problem. So I'm giving this a positive review. Let's hope the release manager does not complain about the wrong number in the filename. ;)
