Hmmm,
is there a quick and easy explanation for the change in the last line of the patch (file "sage/modular/modform/constructor.py")?

- 87	 	         <class 'sage.modular.arithgroup.congroup_gamma0.Gamma0_class'>, 

+ 87	         <class 'sage.modular.arithgroup.congroup_gamma0.Gamma0_class_with_category'>, 


I mean, this might be necessary, but due to the rest of this patch or due to some earlier patch??

Hi Johan,
thanks for looking at this one (I guess you're on SD 35 --- if so, I do envy you)!!

I dimly remember that this patch introduced a function with a missing doctest in "sage/modular/arithgroup/congroup_sl2z.py":

 	96	    def __call__(self, x, check=True): 
 	97	        r""" 
 	98	        Create an element of self from x. If check=True (the default), check 
 	99	        that x really defines a 2x2 integer matrix of det 1. 
 	100	        """ 
 	101	        return ArithmeticSubgroupElement(self, x, check=check) 
 	102	 


I'm sorry I never got round to poke David about that (otherwise, the changes were OK for me) --- could you please have second look and check that independently ("sage --coverage ...modular/arithgroups/" or the like should show it)?

Thanks a lot in advance!


Cheers,
Georg

Hang on a minute.

It is true that there is a doctest missing for this call method, but the missing doctest gets added in the next patch in the series (#11601). So I think we can ignore it here, since #11601 has a positive review; and I can safely reinstate Johan's positive review. 

So: **ignore** the patch(es) I just uploaded -- it is not needed. I tried to obliterate the first patch by uploading a new blank patch on top of it, but made a hash of that. Perhaps it's time I went to bed.
