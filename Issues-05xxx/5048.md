<div id="comment:9" align="right">comment:9</div>

I'm raising the priority of this to "major" since it is a prerequisite for the (much more significant) patch #11601.

is there a quick and easy explanation for the change in the last line of the patch (file "sage/modular/modform/constructor.py")?

- 87	 	         <class 'sage.modular.arithgroup.congroup_gamma0.Gamma0_class'>,

Hi Johan,
thanks for looking at this one (I guess you're on SD 35 --- if so, I do envy you)!!

I dimly remember that this patch introduced a function with a missing doctest in "sage/modular/arithgroup/congroup_sl2z.py":

 	96	    def __call__(self, x, check=True): 
 	97	        r""" 
 	98	        Create an element of self from x. If check=True (the default), check 
 	99	        that x really defines a 2x2 integer matrix of det 1. 
 	100	        """ 
 	101	        return ArithmeticSubgroupElement(self, x, check=check) 
 	102	 


I'm sorry I never got round to poke David about that (otherwise, the changes were OK for me) --- could you please have second look and check that independently ("sage --coverage ...modular/arithgroups/" or the like should show it)?

Thanks a lot in advance!


Cheers,
Georg

Hang on a minute.

It is true that there is a doctest missing for this call method, but the missing doctest gets added in the next patch in the series (#11601). So I think we can ignore it here, since #11601 has a positive review; and I can safely reinstate Johan's positive review. 

So: **ignore** the patch(es) I just uploaded -- it is not needed. I tried to obliterate the first patch by uploading a new blank patch on top of it, but made a hash of that. Perhaps it's time I went to bed.
