In sage-3.3.rc0 (presumable from some patch in an alpha release) tab-completion is somewhat broken in the notebook.  If you tab-complete and there is more than one possible completion, if you choose from the drop-down menu and press enter you get the entire command repeated, for example:

QQ. [press tab, get menu, choose absolute_degree and press enter]
QQ.absolute_degreeQQ.absolute_degree

This is currently effecting sagenb's rc0, and has been confirmed on several other installs.

I am not sure where to begin to track this down, or what patch caused it.
