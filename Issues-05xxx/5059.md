At a workshop in Seattle last June, a **massive** number of spaces of modular symbols were computed. However, the pickles were broken in shortly thereafter by a refactoring of some code in Sage. 

The attached patch fixes this -- now the old pickles can be loaded, and new pickles still work fine.

Unfortunately this patch breaks two doctests:

```
        sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/modular/congroup.py # 5 doctests failed
        sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/modular/congroup_element.py # 1 doctests failed
```
