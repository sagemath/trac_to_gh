tachyon does include BSD support (though the code advises that it hasn't been tested for a while). Looking though the source code, there's no obvious bitrot so add FreeBSD support to the spkg-install script.

This patch does not include support for either threaded or 64-bit tachyon. The former shouldn't be too difficult to add and the MacOS-X port implies it is optional. The 64-bit support is solely an optimisation - a test to detect wrap-around of long integers is removed since wrap-around isn't possible with 64-bit longs.
