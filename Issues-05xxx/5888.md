I've never heard of that function, and expected it to be something you defined.
I was surprised to find it is in Sage.

This was some weird crap that Jon Hanke just added to Sage in his big patch (bomb), evidently.

Well, random() returns a python float, so *boom* for anything large. That function should get a max size check, get deprecated and use generic infrastructure.
