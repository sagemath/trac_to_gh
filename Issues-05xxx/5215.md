ipython1-20070130.spkg is very outdated and since ipython 0.9.0 the functionality has been migrated into ipython itself. Since we are now shipping ipython 0.9.1 remove the ipython1-20070130.spkg from the Sage distribution. Besides deleting the spkg one also needs to change deps and install.

I will post diff for deps and install momentarily.

Cheers,

Michael
