Does that mean that `E.0` etc. are not canonically defined? I didn't know that 32/64 bit made a difference there...

Other than this failure, I give it a positive review.

Not surprisingly, mwrank runs differently on 32 and 64-bit computers.

<a id='comment:11'></a>On my 32-bit machine I get the so-called 64-bit answer.

I ought to be able to say what might cause mwrank to produce different gens, but I cannot.  As this curve is in the database, then IF you have the large database installed (with gens) it will use those gens and be deterministic, while ELSE it will compute them.

For this doctest I suggest killing the display of P and changing the last line into 

```
sage: len(P.division_points(2))
1
```

By the way, I am worried that part of this patch will conflict with #4274 which affects the same file, parsing the mwrank output, which I reviewed and repatched earlier today, and which mabshoff has already merged.
