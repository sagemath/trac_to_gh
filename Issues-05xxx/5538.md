When family got a dictionary it does not copy it's input so that one can modify it. Before the patch we had the following wrong behavior: 

```
sage: d = {1:"a", 3:"b", 4:"c"}
sage: f = Family(d); f
Finite family {1: 'a', 3: 'b', 4: 'c'}
sage: d[2] = 'DD'
sage: f
Finite family {1: 'a', 2: 'DD', 3: 'b', 4: 'c'}
```
This is now corrected. 

The second improvement is that list, and tuple can now be transformed to family indexed by `0..n` with the class TrivialFamily; 

The third improvement is that FiniteCombinatorialClass is now fully compatible with family.

A Fourth improvement is that for lazy family the pickling of the  function or the attrcall is done as far as possible. And example of a case where it is not possible to work has been added.   

Finally since family has noting to do with combinatorics, I moved this to the more sensible sage.set.

The uploaded patch improve family in several ways.

- first of all the input is now systematically copied to avoid modification;

- now family can handle list and tuple with the class `TrivialFamily`;

- I also corrected the pickling of function when possible and attrcall;

- since it has nothing to do with combinatorics I moved family to sage.set

Cheers,

Florent

Since the file is moved, the patch is not very useful. I added a diff from the former `sage/combinat/family.py` to the new `sage/sets/family.py`. It is *not* a patch and should not be applied.

On irc, it was decided that we should take chance of this patch to finish the cleanup of the interface of family. I've taken care of this but several issues are still open:

1. The former implementation of family accepted a parameter "name" which was never used and which was there to provide a functionality similar to `SageObject.rename`. Therefore it should be removed. Is it ok to keep it and raise a warning so that people in sage-combinat adapt their code according to ?

2. On the other hand, for `LazyFamily` I can use the name of the function to generate a proper name for the family. Here are some examples:

```
sage: def fun(i): 2*i
sage: f = LazyFamily([3,4,7], fun); f
Lazy family (fun(i))_{i in [3, 4, 7]}

sage: f = Family(Permutations(3), attrcall("to_lehmer_code"), lazy=True); f
Lazy family (i.to_lehmer_code())_{i in Standard permutations of 3}

sage: f = LazyFamily([3,4,7], lambda i: 2*i); f
Lazy family (<lambda>(i))_{i in [3, 4, 7]}
```
Is this ok ? In particular the last one used to be printed

```
Lazy family (f(i))_{i in [3, 4, 7]}
```
I find `<lambda>` more explicit.

3. To have a single interface it was also decided to add a keyword parameter lazy which call's `LazyFamily`. The parameter is False by for now default. I think it depends on the input. In particular if `index` is a combinatorial class which is not a finite one, then the former implementation turned lazy by default. Should we do that ? 

Cheers,

Florent

Agreed on 1, 2, 3. I very much like the printing in 2.
I looked at the current diff, and it looks good to me.

Just two suggestions in TrivialFamily:
-  `__iter__` could return self.set.__iter__()
- self.set is a bit of a misnomer since the order is relevant. self.enumeration?

The current versions of the patch should be definitive ! Please review. 
They are four patch that should applied without problem in the following order:
  
* [attachment:family_improve-fh-5538-submitted.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket5538/family_improve-fh-5538-submitted.patch)

* [attachment:family_adapt-fh-final.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket5538/family_adapt-fh-final.patch)

The last two clean the interface up and adapt part of combinat and in particular root-systems to the new interface. The test should runs without deprecation warning.

Cheers,

Oups ! The problem is due to a file which has been moved and a class which has been renamed. Everything was ready to correctly pickle, but I mixed things up in my backward compatibility import links. I just updated a simple patch which solve the problem on my machine.
