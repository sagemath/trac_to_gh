The "sloan_sequence" command fails on every input I give it, whereas sloan_find works fine!

Doh -- on checking the docs it appears that sloane_sequence takes a sequence number... and it just happens to be perfectly fine letting that "number" be a list.  Much better type checking would save a lot of confusion.
