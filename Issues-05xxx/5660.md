There is one special case of count_points that could be massively faster.  This should definitely be optimized!

I think that count_points is some general scheme thing.  All that needs doing is overriding that for elliptic curves I think.

This is because the generic code for schemes is behaving badly and doesn't sort the list of points before returning it.

I will fix this in #6810, but for now the above doctest should just be changed to `[(0 : 0 : 1), (0 : 1 : 0), (0 : 2 : 1), (1 : 0 : 1), (1 : 2 : 1), (2 : 0 : 1), (2 : 2 : 1)]`, which is the correct behaviour.  I've added a trivial patch that does this.

Thanks, Alex, you are quite right -- and it is my fault for not testing more before posting the patch.
