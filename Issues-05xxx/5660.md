There is one special case of count_points that could be massively faster.  This should definitely be optimized!

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve(GF(97),[1,2])
sage: time E.count_points(1)
[104]
Time: CPU 1.91 s, Wall: 1.93 s
sage: time E.cardinality()
104
Time: CPU 0.00 s, Wall: 0.18 s
```

This is because the generic code for schemes is behaving badly and doesn't sort the list of points before returning it.

I will fix this in #6810, but for now the above doctest should just be changed to `[(0 : 0 : 1), (0 : 1 : 0), (0 : 2 : 1), (1 : 0 : 1), (1 : 2 : 1), (2 : 0 : 1), (2 : 2 : 1)]`, which is the correct behaviour.  I've added a trivial patch that does this.
