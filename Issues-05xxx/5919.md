In 3.4.2.alpha0 we have

```
sage: F.<a> = GF(2^16)
sage: R.<x, y> = F[]
sage: R({(1,2):1})
0*x*y^2
```
which Alex Ghitza tracked down to a line in libs/singular/singular.pyx and which I fixed by replacing one character in that line from 'i' to '0'.  After that:

```
sage: sage: F.<a> = GF(2^16)
sage: sage: R.<x, y> = F[]
sage: sage: R({(1,2):1})
x*y^2
```
and hence also

```
sage: Fx.<b>=GF(2^(4*5))
sage: Ex=EllipticCurve(Fx,[0,0,1,1,1])
sage: Ex.defining_polynomial()
x^3 + y^2*z + x*z^2 + y*z^2 + z^3
```
which was not working properly (as reported to sage-devel).

Thanks -- I did not add a doctest, since the function in which the bug was is a long way (it seems) from the user level where the above examples make sense.

Specifically, the bug is in the cdef function  Conversion.*sa2si_GFqNTLGF2E(self, FiniteField_ntl_gf2eElement elem, ring *_ring) which has an empty docstring!
