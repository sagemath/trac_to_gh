For the patch **5542-referee.patch**, everything looks good except for this line:

```
2017	        The normal subgroups of `H = PSL(2,7) \times PSL(2,7)` are
```
The LaTeX macro `\times` is meant to render as a multiplication symbol that looks like this "x". But after applying **5542-referee.patch** on top of **trac_5542-docstring-fixes.patch** and rebuilding the HTML version of the reference manual, the said macro doesn't render as expected; see the rebuilt ref manual at

to see what it's rendered as.
