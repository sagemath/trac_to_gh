This provides an easy way to make a matplotlib image and combine it with other Graphics() objects:

```
class Matplotlib_Primitive(GraphicPrimitive):
    """
    Primitive class that initializes the
    matrix_plot graphics type 
    """
    def __init__(self, artist, options=None):
        self.artist = artist
        GraphicPrimitive.__init__(self, options)        

    def get_minmax_data(self):
        """
        Returns a dictionary with the bounding box data.
                
        EXAMPLES:
            sage: m = matrix_plot(matrix([[1,3,5,1],[2,4,5,6],[1,3,5,7]]))[0]
            sage: list(sorted(m.get_minmax_data().items()))
            [('xmax', 4), ('xmin', 0), ('ymax', 3), ('ymin', 0)]

        """
        return dict(zip(['xmin', 'xmax', 'ymax', 'ymin'], self.artist.get_extent()))

    def _allowed_options(self):
        return {}

    def _repr_(self):
        return "MatrixPlot defined by a %s x %s data grid"%(self.xy_array_row, self.xy_array_col)

    def _render_on_subplot(self, subplot):
        subplot.add_artist(self.artist)

def matplotlib_plot(mat):
    from sage.plot.plot import Graphics
    g = Graphics()
    g.add_primitive(Matplotlib_Primitive(mat))
    return g
```

Example use:

```
A=random_matrix(RDF,100)
A.numpy()
import pylab
import numpy
B=A.numpy().astype(float)
im = pylab.imshow(B/numpy.max(B),  origin='upper',alpha=0.6)
matplotlib_plot(im)+polygon([[0,10],[10,0],[20,40]])
```


This just needs to be put in a file in the plot/ directory and an entry added to all.py.

This makes things a little better, but not much.  Currently, you can add an axes object.  Note that the doctests involving hist are wrong.

It sounds like we'll probably have to wait until someone (one of us??) volunteers to help on the matplotlib side.

This server is not only down, the replacement news.gmane.io is not exactly obvious how to access this one any more.  I *think* that this is the discussion in question: https://discourse.matplotlib.org/t/saving-images-using-pure-matplotlib-in-sage-cuts-off-the-bottom-part-and-produces-corrupt-file/12286/7 or possibly https://discourse.matplotlib.org/t/saving-an-axes-to-draw-in-a-different-figure/12185

See also https://groups.google.com/g/sage-support/c/N2cgEW3QUG4 for a SageTeX point of view.

I wonder what the current state of the art is.
