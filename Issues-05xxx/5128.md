This provides an easy way to make a matplotlib image and combine it with other Graphics() objects:

```
class Matplotlib_Primitive(GraphicPrimitive):
    """
    Primitive class that initializes the
    matrix_plot graphics type 
    """
    def __init__(self, artist, options=None):
        self.artist = artist
        GraphicPrimitive.__init__(self, options)        

    def get_minmax_data(self):
        """
        Returns a dictionary with the bounding box data.
                
        EXAMPLES:
            sage: m = matrix_plot(matrix([[1,3,5,1],[2,4,5,6],[1,3,5,7]]))[0]
            sage: list(sorted(m.get_minmax_data().items()))
            [('xmax', 4), ('xmin', 0), ('ymax', 3), ('ymin', 0)]

        """
        return dict(zip(['xmin', 'xmax', 'ymax', 'ymin'], self.artist.get_extent()))

    def _allowed_options(self):
        return {}

    def _repr_(self):
        return "MatrixPlot defined by a %s x %s data grid"%(self.xy_array_row, self.xy_array_col)

    def _render_on_subplot(self, subplot):
        subplot.add_artist(self.artist)

def matplotlib_plot(mat):
    from sage.plot.plot import Graphics
    g = Graphics()
    g.add_primitive(Matplotlib_Primitive(mat))
    return g
```

Example use:

```
A=random_matrix(RDF,100)
A.numpy()
import pylab
import numpy
B=A.numpy().astype(float)
im = pylab.imshow(B/numpy.max(B),  origin='upper',alpha=0.6)
matplotlib_plot(im)+polygon([[0,10],[10,0],[20,40]])
```


This just needs to be put in a file in the plot/ directory and an entry added to all.py.

Something doesn't work in the above patch.  I need to figure out how to get the extents of any matplotlib image passed in.  Is there an easy way to that information?

By the way, is this ticket still waiting for something to happen with matplotlib, or is it in working order?

This server is not only down, the replacement news.gmane.io is not exactly obvious how to access this one any more.  I *think* that this is the discussion in question: https://discourse.matplotlib.org/t/saving-images-using-pure-matplotlib-in-sage-cuts-off-the-bottom-part-and-produces-corrupt-file/12286/7 or possibly https://discourse.matplotlib.org/t/saving-an-axes-to-draw-in-a-different-figure/12185
