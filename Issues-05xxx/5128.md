This provides an easy way to make a matplotlib image and combine it with other Graphics() objects:

```
class Matplotlib_Primitive(GraphicPrimitive):
    """
    Primitive class that initializes the
    matrix_plot graphics type 
    """
    def __init__(self, artist, options=None):
        self.artist = artist
        GraphicPrimitive.__init__(self, options)        

    def get_minmax_data(self):
        """
        Returns a dictionary with the bounding box data.
                
        EXAMPLES:
            sage: m = matrix_plot(matrix([[1,3,5,1],[2,4,5,6],[1,3,5,7]]))[0]
            sage: list(sorted(m.get_minmax_data().items()))
            [('xmax', 4), ('xmin', 0), ('ymax', 3), ('ymin', 0)]

        """
        return dict(zip(['xmin', 'xmax', 'ymax', 'ymin'], self.artist.get_extent()))

    def _allowed_options(self):
        return {}

    def _repr_(self):
        return "MatrixPlot defined by a %s x %s data grid"%(self.xy_array_row, self.xy_array_col)

    def _render_on_subplot(self, subplot):
        subplot.add_artist(self.artist)

def matplotlib_plot(mat):
    from sage.plot.plot import Graphics
    g = Graphics()
    g.add_primitive(Matplotlib_Primitive(mat))
    return g
```

Example use:

```
A=random_matrix(RDF,100)
A.numpy()
import pylab
import numpy
B=A.numpy().astype(float)
im = pylab.imshow(B/numpy.max(B),  origin='upper',alpha=0.6)
matplotlib_plot(im)+polygon([[0,10],[10,0],[20,40]])
```


This just needs to be put in a file in the plot/ directory and an entry added to all.py.

This server is not only down, the replacement news.gmane.io is not exactly obvious how to access this one any more.  I *think* that this is the discussion in question: https://discourse.matplotlib.org/t/saving-images-using-pure-matplotlib-in-sage-cuts-off-the-bottom-part-and-produces-corrupt-file/12286/7 or possibly https://discourse.matplotlib.org/t/saving-an-axes-to-draw-in-a-different-figure/12185
