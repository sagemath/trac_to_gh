Logic looks ok, but patch does not apply to 3.3.alpha2 cleanly.  Does it need alpha3?  If so a proper review will have to wait (at least until I get home).

Have you remembered 990h where the optimal curve is not #1?

I did it against alpha0.  I'll rebase it for alpha3.

That's the only example, luckily.

The attached patch implements computation of the Manin constant with some caveats that are clearly spelled out in the docstrings.  Also, it fixes a serious bug in an internal function (_multiple_of_degree_of_isogeny_to_optimal_curve, which was just nonsense before).

Patch applies cleanly to 3.3.alpha2 + #5139.  Tests pass BUT:

```
sage: Ellsage: EllipticCurve('990a1').optimal_curve()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
RuntimeError          
```
since on line 3099 you set the number to 3 when N=990 for all isogeny classes, not just class h.

Somewhere in the database code I think we have utilities for splitting the label into its 3 components, by the way, which might be more transparent than (e.g.) stripping off the last character to get the number.
