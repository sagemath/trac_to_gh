Logic looks ok, but patch does not apply to 3.3.alpha2 cleanly.  Does it need alpha3?  If so a proper review will have to wait (at least until I get home).

Have you remembered 990h where the optimal curve is not #1?

<a id='comment:8'>Comment 8:</a>
Patch applies cleanly to 3.3.alpha2 + #5139.  Tests pass BUT:

```
sage: Ellsage: EllipticCurve('990a1').optimal_curve()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
RuntimeError          
```
since on line 3099 you set the number to 3 when N=990 for all isogeny classes, not just class h.

Somewhere in the database code I think we have utilities for splitting the label into its 3 components, by the way, which might be more transparent than (e.g.) stripping off the last character to get the number.
