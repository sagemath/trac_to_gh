The spkg at

switches to Python 2.5.4. Note that no changes were made aside from 

* rebasing the ctypes/__init__.py patch
* update SPKG.txt, especially with patch information
* rename two patches to be consistent with SPKG guidelines

This looks suspicous:

```
wstein@sage:~/tmp/python-2.5.4.p1$ hg status
? patches/posixmodule.c.patch.rej
```

Otherwise this looks perfect.  

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/wstein/tmp/python-2.5.4.p1.spkg

is the spkg but with that rej file deleted.
