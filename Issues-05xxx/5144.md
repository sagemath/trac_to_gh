left_nullity currently functions by computing the difference between self.nrows() and self.rank().

right_nullity currently functions by calling left_nullity on the transpose of the matrix, and so it can be sped up if it instead computes self.ncols() - self.rank().  The attached patch does this.

To see the effect, try timing some things with

```
sage: m = random_matrix(ZZ, 50, x=2^16)
```
On my machine, I get

```
sage: timeit('m.left_nullity()')
625 loops, best of 3: 2.29 Âµs per loop
timeit('m.transpose()')
125 loops, best of 3: 1.72 ms per loop
```
so the transpose operation is really slow.
