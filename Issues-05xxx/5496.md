}
```
This is not good:

```
sage: is_prime(GF(5)(3))
True
sage: is_prime(GF(5)(4))
False
```

The fix is to totally 100% rewrite is_prime in arith.py so that it first calls x.is_prime() and if that isn't defined, then in some special cases (e.g., python ints) converts to Integer and calls is_prime.  Otherwise, it raises a NotImplementedError.

Right now finite fields don't seem to have an is_prime function, so I believe that currently, is_prime(GF(5)(3)) should raise NotImplementedError.  I'm going to try to fix is_prime so that it raises NotImplementedError for is_prime(GF(5)(3)).

I've now incorporated the handling of symbolic expressions as suggested by Burcin.  The sequence of patches should be applied in the order

- 5496.2.patch
- trac5496_rationals_to_int.patch
- trac5496_symbolic_expressions.patch
- trac5496_lucas.patch
- trac5496_symbolic_expressions2.patch

I am running doctests now, but if they pass this should get positive review again.
