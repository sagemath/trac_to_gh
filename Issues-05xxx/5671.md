Sage lacks a SAT solver.  First step, lets make a spkg and wrap it.  In the future, we should add boolean functions, etc., but one step at a time.

Might I point out that this is a dupe of #418.

You also 

* should assign a milestone when you open a ticket
* not attach spkgs to tickets, but post a link. Given that this one is 77kb it might be a borderline case.

Cheers,

Michael
