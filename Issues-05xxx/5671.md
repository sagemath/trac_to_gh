Might I point out that this is a dupe of #418.

You also 

* should assign a milestone when you open a ticket
* not attach spkgs to tickets, but post a link. Given that this one is 77kb it might be a borderline case.

Cheers,

Michael

This

   http://planete.inrialpes.fr/~soos/CryptoMiniSat/index.html

might be relevant. It is an enhanced MiniSat with:

* Natively handled XOR functions
* Statistics generation
* Search randomization
* Detailed solving process visualization
* Clause grouping and group naming
* Variable naming
* Debug mode
* Code cleanup

As far as I understand the way to have a ticket closes as "wontfix" or similar is to set the milestone to `duplicate/invalid/wontfix` and wait for someone else to review that choice.
