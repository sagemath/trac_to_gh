I have written some code that computes approximations to the q-expansions of overconvergent p-adic modular forms of tame level 1, when p is one of the primes {2, 3, 5, 7, 13} (so X_0(p) has genus 0). See the notes of my talk at the Heilbronn Institute for background:

I say that only because Sage is so broad and in combinatorics/representation theory `WeightSpace` could have some completely different meaning.\n2. Could `WeightSpace?` give more useful documentation?   \n3. I'm very happy with how good `OverconvergentModularForms` docstring is, but there should be doctests that illustrate all of the options to the `OverconvergentModularForms` function. Right now the doctests don't at all test/illustrate `base_ring` or `prec`. \n4. Here's a bug. This was *literally* the first random thing I tried:\n\n```\nsage: M = OverconvergentModularForms(3, 0, 1/2)\nsage: w = M.weight()\nsage: w.Lvalue()\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)\n\n/scratch/wstein/sage/temp/sage.math.washington.edu/30657/_scratch_wstein_sage_init_sage_0.py in <module>()\n\n/scratch/wstein/build/sage-3.4.1.alpha0/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/sage/modular/overconvergent/weightspace.pyc in Lvalue(self)\n    457             return -self.chi.bernoulli(self.k)/self.k\n    458         if self.is_trivial():\n--> 459             return Infinity\n    460         else:\n    461             raise NotImplementedError, \"Don't know how to compute value of this L-function\"\n\nNameError: global name 'Infinity' is not defined\n```\n1. Continuing the above example, the second thing I tried also fails:\n\n```\nsage: w.base_extend(QQ)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)\n...\nAttributeError: 'WeightSpace_class' object has no attribute 'base_extend'\n```\n1. The third thing I tried gives nonsense.  Shouldn't w.base_ring() either raise an error, or return a ring?\n\n```\nsage: w.base_ring()\nsage: w.base_ring() is None\nTrue\n```\n1. Do you really want that I can just change the attribute k (the weight) of the p-adic Weight space like this?\n\n```\nsage: w.k = 10\nsage: w\n10\nsage: M.weight()   # that can't be good\n10\n```\n1.

I would rather get a Sage Integer or a Rational or p-adic or something.  \n\n```\nsage: w.one_over_Lvalue()\n0\nsage: type(w.one_over_Lvalue())\n<type 'int'>\n```\n\n1. This isn't good, and is why I would never ever expose attributes like this.  It's best to use self.__prime and make a method or use the Python \"properties\" protocol. \n\n```\nsage: w.prime = 6\nsage: w.prime\n6\nsage: w.parent()\nSpace of 3-adic weight-characters\n```\n\n1. Moving back to `M=OverconvergentModularForms(3, 0, 1/2)`, and going through some of the methods, the first one I try is broken.  I realize this is broken because a function in the abstract base class for Hecke modules assumes certain things and you wrote code that doesn't satisfy those assumption.  But we have to find a way to make this all work.   Half the functions in the abstract base class assume there is a function `M.hecke_matrix(n)` that works, so if you do `M.<tab>` and try things, you'll find a whole bunch of functions that don't work. \n\n```\nsage: M.hecke_polynomial(2)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)\n   1028         OUTPUT: a polynomial\n   1029         \"\"\"\n-> 1030         return self.hecke_operator(n).charpoly(var)\n   1031 \n   1032     def is_simple(self):\n\nTypeError: hecke_operator() takes exactly 3 arguments (2 given)\n```\n\n1.

REFEREE REPORT:

1. Could we rename `WeightSpace` to `pAdicWeightSpace`?  I say that only because Sage is so broad and in combinatorics/representation theory `WeightSpace` could have some completely different meaning.
2. Could `WeightSpace?` give more useful documentation?   
3. I'm very happy with how good `OverconvergentModularForms` docstring is, but there should be doctests that illustrate all of the options to the `OverconvergentModularForms` function. Right now the doctests don't at all test/illustrate `base_ring` or `prec`. 
4. Here's a bug. This was *literally* the first random thing I tried:

Anyway, as you can see, I hope you could take each of the main new objects that this code introduces, try each method, and fix the issues.   You can probably clean this all up pretty quickly.

Please don't take the above in too negative away.  This is frickin' *awesome* code, and I'm very very happy and excited to finally see a real implementation of overconvergent p-adic modular forms in Sage.  This is wonderful!
