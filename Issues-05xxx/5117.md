```
The Polyhedron class (in the polyhedra module) has a union method

```
def union(self, other):
    """
    Returns a polyhedron whose vertices are the union of the vertices
    of the two polyhedra.
    ....
```
The name is misleading as the method does not return the union of `self` and `other` (which would not be a convex polyhedron).

The method should then be removed or renamed. As the method itself consists in one single line of code (and as I have no idea of a proper name), I would tend to remove it.

The attached patch removes it.

I disagree that this should be removed.  I created it because I use it!

I think the docstring makes it pretty clear what it does, but I do not object to renaming it.  Perhaps union_of_vertices? Or union_by_vertices?

using 

```
p = Polyhedron(p1.vertices() + p2.vertices())
```
instead of

```
p = p1.union(p2)
```
does not make a big difference ;)

> I think the docstring makes it pretty clear what it does,

agreed

> but I do not object to renaming it.  Perhaps union_of_vertices? Or union_by_vertices?

what about extending ot to handle unbounded polyhedra as well in this way:

```
p = Polyhedron(p1.vertices() + p2.vertices(), p1.rays() + p2.rays())
```
We could then name it convex_hull() or something like that?

Current version is doing this:

```
new_vertices = self.vertices() + other.vertices()
new_rays = self.rays() + other.rays()
new_lines = self.lines() + other.lines()
return Polyhedron(vertices=new_vertices,
                      rays=new_rays, lines=new_lines, field=self.field())

```
which is great, but I STRONGLY support the idea of renaming the method to something else.

I was once working with an algorithm where the *union* of polytopes was used, but I interpreted it exactly as the convex hull and of course got wrong results. I was not using this function, that was my own mistake, but since it is so easy to do, I don't think there should be an extra opportunity for confusion. I agree, that the result is described in the documentation, but I don't always read it for "obvious" functions and perhaps there are other users like me.

How about "extend"? "convex_hull" is also great, although it seems more natural to me to have a global function with such a name called like

```
convex_hull(polyhedron1, polyhedron2, polyhedron3, ...)
```
(There is a function with this name in lattice_polytope which works with points and thinking about it now I suspect that I have chosen not the best name for it either... At least it is not imported into global namespace...)
