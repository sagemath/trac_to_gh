The code below works instantly in Sage 3.2.1, but starting with Sage 3.2.2 it doesn't even finish the last command in 30 minutes CPU time:

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Sage Version 3.2.2, Release Date: 2008-12-18                       |
| Type notebook() for the GUI, and license() for information.        |
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage:     sage: x = var('x')
sage:     sage: eqn =  x^3 + sqrt(2)*x + 5 == 0
sage:     sage: a = solve(eqn, x)[0].rhs()
sage:     sage: K.<b> = QQ[a]
```
Carl Witty suggests:

```
[10:23am] mabs: So far it has eaten *4 minutes* of CPU time.
[10:23am] cwitty: It looks like somebody changed the embedding 
system to use QQbar instead of wstein's algdep-of-numerical-value.
```
This is likely related to the new embedding code in Sage 3.2.2, so I am CCing RobertWB.

Cheers,

Michael

You can still access my old (numeric) minpoly code via

```
sage: x = var('x')
sage: eqn =  x^3 + sqrt(2)*x + 5 == 0
sage: a = solve(eqn, x)[0].rhs()
sage: a.minpoly(algorithm='numeric')
x^6 + 10*x^3 - 2*x^2 + 25
```

However, for many cases this is much slower or fails completely.

The problem seems to be here:

```
sage: b = (sqrt(sqrt(2) + 1)/(sqrt(3)) - 1)^(1/3)
sage: c = QQbar(b)
sage: od = c._descr
sage: od.exactify()    # doesn't seem to finish
```

As far as I can see, the latter is getting into an infinite loop.  If that is right, it's real bug and not just a new inefficiency.

We need to wrap raising this error to not be raised if the algorithm is numeric... 

I remember doing it in this order because there were cases where the numeric algorithm was way slower, but at least the numeric one finishes in constant bounded time. 

I really feel there should be a quicker way of computing compositums than using QQbar.
