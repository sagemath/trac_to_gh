The attached patch (based on 3.4) implements a new class UnitGroup for the unit group of a number field.  As before, the units are computed using the pari library, but now it is easier (for example) to obtain all generators of the unit group.  Also, I have added a wrapping for the pari function bnfisunit() which implements a discrete log function to express any unit in terms of the generators.

As well as all the documented code and examples in unit_group.py there are added functions in number_field.py.

This seems to work fine, with some exceptions for relative number fields.  
For example, with my current favourite extension,

```
PQ.<X> = QQ[]
F.<a, b> = NumberField([X^2 - 2, X^2 - 3])
PF.<Y> = F[]
K.<c> = F.extension(Y^2 - (1 + a)*(a + b)*a*b)
K.unit_group()
```
fails.

But the cause lies beyond this patch.  There are many problems with the
existing code for relative number fields, some addressed in my patch in
#5508, others to follow soon in a revised patch.

In this case the culprit is the use of `pari_bnf` in the line `pK = K.pari_bnf(proof)` 
at line 145 of `unit_group.py`.  For in `pari_bnf`,
the lines

```
if self.polynomial().denominator() != 1:
    raise TypeError, "Unable to coerce number field defined by ..."
```  
exclude extensions like `K`.  The solution is, of course, to use 
`self.absolute_polynomial()`; this change could be included 
in the patch.

So my review is positive, subject to some small changes listed below,
with the expectation that forthcoming changes to other functions will make
the code work for all (sufficiently small) relative number fields.

## Minor points

* Three times:
   "but we do use if it is already known"
   should surely be
   "but we do use it if it is already known"

* In `zeta`,

      ```
              z = self.primitive_root_of_unity() ** (N//n)`
   ```
  would be more consistently written as

     ```
              z = K.primitive_root_of_unity() ** (N//n)`
  ```


* In `roots_of_unity` 

      ```
              n = z.multiplicative_order()
   ```
  would surely be better as

     ```
              n = self.zeta_order()
  ```

## Further remark

While we're working on units, one thing that should be fixed is the 
following:

```
sage: K.<b> = NumberField([x^2 - 3])
sage: K.zeta(5)
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
ArithmeticError: There are no roots of unity of order 5 in this unit group
```
compared to

```
sage: C.<z> = CyclotomicField(20)
sage: C.zeta(7)
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
ValueError: n (=7) does not divide order of generator
```
There seems to be no reason why the error type should be different, and I 
found an example where a function failed for cyclotomic fields because of 
this disparity.

This patch set no longer applies after merging #5508.

Francis: Can you rebase this patch set? Once it is rebased the positive review should be reinstated provided the changes are minimal, otherwise we should have another review.

I cannot reproduce this - but I did not try to apply this patch set. What I tried:

* use -tp
* use -t from inside the Sage tree
* use -t from outside the Sage tree

Can someone give me exact instructions on how to reproduce this?

**Attachment:** [units_rebased3.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket5513/units_rebased3.patch)

ok -- see newest patch (units_rebased3.patch, to replace units_rebased2.patch).

I took the lazy way out and added #random to all the outputs which return actual units.  It may be a 32/64 issue, but not just that since when testing this patch on one machine I kept on getting different generating units out of pari.  I seem to remember that there is a way to "reset" pari in doctests  to avoid this random-ness.

Mathematically this is not so unreasonable since any f.g. abelian group will lots (infinitely many) sets of generators and there is no way to pick one canonically.  (William and I thought about this for elliptic curve generators and came up against an unsolved problem which prevents this being possible even in principle!).

Michael,

since all I did here was to add #random to the problem tests, does this need more review or could it be merged now?

John,

William has given his "thumbs up" to this patch and the latest changes, so let's make this a positive review. This patch also passes doctests with my current 3.4.1.rc0 merge tree.
