Attachment: **[trac_5644_esc_kills_introspect.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket5644/trac_5644_esc_kills_introspect.patch.gz)**

The attached patch seems to work in Firefox 3 without breaking other functions.  I'm not sure about the purpose of

```
            if(browser_op) { focus_delay(id,true); }
```
Although I haven't copied this to the new conditional clause, the patch works in Opera 9, too.

By the way, I think the `halt_introspection();` statement just before the new code is unnecessary, since `handle_replacement_controls()` calls it before returning `true`.  But the patch leaves this alone.

To clarify:  This patch works for a "TAB" introspection window but not for a "SHIFT-ENTER" introspection window.  The latter is placed in cell_output_* instead of introspect_div_*, which is more difficult to make disappear, at least for me.

Because of this, I've changed this ticket's status to "needs work."  The TAB-only patch may be enough for some users.

A first take at "unification:" Replace the end of `js.py`'s `set_output_text()` with something like

```
    if(introspect_id == id) {
        if (status == 'd') {
            introspection_loaded = true;
            introspection_text = introspect_html;
        }
        update_introspection_text();
    } else if(introspect_html != '') {
        introspect_id = id;
        introspection_loaded = true;
        introspection_text = introspect_html;
        update_introspection_text();
/*
        cell_output.innerHTML = '';
        cell_output_nowrap.innerHTML = '';
        cell_output_html.innerHTML = introspect_html;
        if (contains_jsmath(introspect_html)) {
            try {
                jsMath.ProcessBeforeShowing(cell_output_html);
            } catch(e) {
                cell_output.innerHTML = jsmath_font_msg + cell_output_html.innerHTML;
            }
        }
*/
    } else {
        introspect_id = id;
        introspection_loaded = true;
        introspection_text = '';
        update_introspection_text();
    }
```
Probably, it's *far* better to eliminate all global variables, starting with those related to introspection.  This would
* Make it easier to understand, maintain, and modify the code.
* Permit independent (i.e., non-interfering) introspection windows for different cells.
* Help with ticket #6001.
