The former implementation of generic_power_c made two assumptions
- `not a` is well defined for any element a
- There is a one
These two assumptions do not always always hold. So I reorganized the initial code which handle particular cases so that:
- it does not call "not a" when the exponent n is different from zero
- it delegates to ~a the responsibility of raising an error when the exponent n is negative and a is not invertible. This allows for monoids with partially defined inversion (e.g. the multiplicative monoid of Z/12Z).

This modification revealed a problem in matrices: the empty matrix 0x0 modulo 2 was tested to be non invertible! I changed the test to the correct value. 

Investigating this revealed many other inconsistencies with matrices; those will be taken care of in a subsequent patch.

Indeed a can be a plain Python int (wich forbid the use of `a.is_zero()`) of any type eg polynomial with forbid the use of `== 0` so I don't know what else to do (I'm far from being a cython expert) :

```
 sage -t  "devel/sage-combinat/sage/rings/polynomial/polydict.pyx"
**********************************************************************
File "/usr/local/sage/devel/sage-combinat/sage/rings/polynomial/polydict.pyx", line 695:
    sage: (f-f)**0
Expected:
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ArithmeticError: 0^0 is undefined.
Got:
    PolyDict with representation {0: 1}
```

So if there is no better suggestion I'll stick with the current patch.
