```
The former implementation of generic_power_c made two assumptions
- `not a` is well defined for any element a
- There is a one
These two assumptions do not always always hold. So I reorganized the initial code which handle particular cases so that:
- it does not call "not a" when the exponent n is different from zero
- it delegates to ~a the responsibility of raising an error when the exponent n is negative and a is not invertible. This allows for monoids with partially defined inversion (e.g. the multiplicative monoid of Z/12Z).

This modification revealed a problem in matrices: the empty matrix 0x0 modulo 2 was tested to be non invertible! I changed the test to the correct value. 

Investigating this revealed many other inconsistencies with matrices; those will be taken care of in a subsequent patch.
