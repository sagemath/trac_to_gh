Make Sage hurt:

```
var('x,y')
implicit_plot(x^2+y^2 == 1, (x,-2,2), (y,-2,2))
```

The problem is that implicit_plot takes a function, not a symbolic equation, so it views "x<sup>2+y</sup>2 == 1" as a function --- and that is very painful.  

SOLUTION: Check if the input is an equation, and if so, make RHS zero, and plot corresponding function equal to 0.

There is one doctest failure in here:
