It would be great if the line

"$SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/sage-sage" $*

in the top level script 'sage' would be changed to

"$SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/sage-sage" "$@"

so it doesn't split up command line arguments that happen to have spaces in them.

Component: **user interface**

Nope, the release manager does that after verifying that it is a dupe. And I have to state that you are right, so closed as a dupe :)
