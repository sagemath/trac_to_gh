It would be great if the line

"$SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/sage-sage" $*

in the top level script 'sage' would be changed to

"$SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/sage-sage" "$@"

so it doesn't split up command line arguments that happen to have spaces in them.

Replying to [GeorgSWeber](#comment%3A3):

This is indeed a dupe of  #4354.

> Am I allowed to close this?

Nope, the release manager does that after verifying that it is a dupe. And I have to state that you are right, so closed as a dupe :)

Cheers,

Michael
