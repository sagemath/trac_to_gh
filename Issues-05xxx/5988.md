I strongly agree with the following feature request.  I have wanted the same feature myself.

```
If the sage notebook server is restarted while a logged in user is
viewing a notebook page, a user attempt to refresh the page results in
a completely blank page titled "Error | Sage Notebook".  The user must
manually edit the URL to go back to the main server page and login
again, presumably because the login credentials have been lost with
the server reboot.

But, it may not be obvious to all users what they need to do to
recover from this situation.  Is there some twisted option I can set
to either redirect the browser back to the login page, or to add
explanatory text to the blank page with a link to the login page?  If
neither of these options is currently possible, I'd like to make a
feature request to enhance the server response to an attempt to access
a page when a user is apparently not logged in, to provide the user
with a useful page, rather than a completely blank page.

I'm running sage 3.4.2.

Thanks,
