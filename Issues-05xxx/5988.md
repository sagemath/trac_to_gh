I strongly agree with the following feature request.  I have wanted the same feature myself.

```
If the sage notebook server is restarted while a logged in user is
viewing a notebook page, a user attempt to refresh the page results in
a completely blank page titled "Error | Sage Notebook".  The user must
manually edit the URL to go back to the main server page and login
again, presumably because the login credentials have been lost with
the server reboot.

But, it may not be obvious to all users what they need to do to
recover from this situation.  Is there some twisted option I can set
to either redirect the browser back to the login page, or to add
explanatory text to the blank page with a link to the login page?  If
neither of these options is currently possible, I'd like to make a
feature request to enhance the server response to an attempt to access
a page when a user is apparently not logged in, to provide the user
with a useful page, rather than a completely blank page.

I'm running sage 3.4.2.

Thanks,

I think this is no longer a problem, at least with SageNB 0.7 (#8051) and maybe even with SageNB 0.6.  If I try to reload the home page or an opened worksheet, I get redirected to the login page or to a page with a message, e.g.,

  You are not logged in or do not have access to the worksheet 'XXX'. Continue

Clicking "Continue" takes me to the login page.  But clicking on "Log," "Settings," or "Help" returns `404 Not Found`, instead of redirecting to the login page.

Actually, this may still be a problem in WebKit browsers.
