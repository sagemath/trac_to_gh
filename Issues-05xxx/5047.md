I believe this ticket is close to being invalid, because Sage is nearly consistent with Python.

In Python, one gets

```
>>> cmp(1j,0)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: no ordering relation is defined for complex numbers
```

Only I would say that the error message in Sage could be clearer. So, I suggest to catch the error and reraise a TypeError with an appropriate error message.

I ran into this when testing new printing code in pynac. ATM, pynac uses the sign function, which is defined to be cmp(x, 0), to determine if it should print a minus sign. Thus, we have the following:

```
sage: var('x',ns=1)
sage: i*x
<boom>
```

I somehow thought that the cmp function was not supposed to raise exceptions, but googling shortly didn't turn up any evidence to support this argument.

I would be ok to live with this fact, and try to figure out a better way to handle the sign function, or printing in pynac.

BTW, the sign function is also mentioned here: #777


I give the attached patch a positive review, provided that doctests are added to test for the new error message.

The second patch `cmp_doc.patch` (to be applied after the first patch) adds more documentation.

Replying to [@burcin](#comment%3A3):
> I ran into this when testing new printing code in pynac. ATM, pynac uses the sign function, which is defined to be cmp(x, 0), to determine if it should print a minus sign. Thus, we have the following:

Ok, but I think there should be a different approach for determining the sign when printing an imaginary number. 
However, personally I believe that `sign(I)` should raise an error.

> I somehow thought that the cmp function was not supposed to raise exceptions, but googling shortly didn't turn up any evidence to support this argument.

... and, as I mentioned above, `cmp` does raise an exception in Python.

> BTW, the sign function is also mentioned here: #777

The `sign` function defined in #777 would simply return 0 on non-real constants, because it tests `bool(x > 0)`. Indeed, we have

```
sage: bool(I > 0)
False
sage: bool(I < 0)
False
```
so, at least it does not go boom (which it *should*, though!).
