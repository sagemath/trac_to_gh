Consider

```
sage: R.<a> = NumberField(x^4 - 2*x^2 - 1)
sage: S.<i> = R.extension(x^2 + 1)
sage: S.subfield(a + i/a)
```

The S.subfield method documentation says that it constructs QQ(alpha), but this is false, I think it constructs R(alpha). In the above example, S.subfield(a + i/a) returns a number field of degree 8 over Q, whereas a + i/a has degree 4 over QQ (the minimal polynomial is `x^4 - 4x^2 + 8`).
