<a id='comment:1'></a>This is highly desirable as a 3 to 5-fold speedup of all the functions in `weyl_character.py`.

I got some new errors with sage-3.4.1.rc1 after applying the patch.

I had failures in

```
combinat/root_system/ambient_space.py
combinat/sf/kschur.py
combinat/sf/jack.py

<a id='comment:4'></a>If you take down the caching it's still an impressive speedup.

I ran `sage -t weyl_characters.py` three ways. First, unpatched 3.4.1.rc1. Second, with the patch.  Third, patched but with the caching removed from three files, `ambient_space.py`, `free_module.py` and `type_B.py`.

Without caching, it actually ran faster.

Run `sage -t weyl_characters.py` unpatched:

59.5 s

With Mike's patch:

16.0 s

With Mike's patch, caching disabled:

14.2 s

<a id='comment:6'></a>The problem seems to be in free_module.py.

In order for __cmp__ method to work with free group elements, no
terms may occur with zero coefficient. But debugging the failure in
jack.py we find that after Mike's patch:

```
sage: Z = ZonalPolynomials(QQ)
sage: p = Partition([2,2,1])
sage: a = p.hook_product(2)*Z(p)
sage: a._monomial_coefficients
{[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]: 0, [2, 1, 1, 1]: 0, [2, 2, 1]: 40}
```

referring to the patch, the fragment following the comment

`#Remove all entries that are equal to 0`

might be incorrect.

For efficiency, the changes in ambient_space.py seem more important than the changes in free_module.py. If we revert the changes in free_module.py we still get about a 3 fold speedup, running `sage -t weyl_characters.py` in about 19 seconds - see above for other timings.

But if we revert the changes in ambient_space.py there is no improvement.

The changes in free_module.py could therefore be abandoned.

<a id='comment:7'></a>Further testing suggests that it is the hash method in class `AmbientSpaceElement`
that is responsible for the most impressive speedup. Remove that method and the
code is still faster than without the patch, but not very much (48 seconds versus 59
for `sage -t weyl_characters.py`).

Removing this hash method has the effect of reordering the dictionaries
that underlie WeylCharacterRing and WeightRing elements. This is why Mike revised
three tests in weyl_characters.py. The change in test results is harmless, but it
seems to me that it raises a problem.

In view of this message:

http://groups.google.com/group/sage-combinat-devel/msg/7e52394814b7779e?hl=en

this would seem to imply that the results of the tests could be different for 64 bit and 32 bit.

Is this a concern?

I have uploaded an abridgment to Mike's patch.

`trac_5721-part.patch` is a subset of the original patch.

It applies cleanly to rc2, introduces no new failures on
`sage --testall` and it is about a 3-fold speedup.

I took out the changes to `free-module.py`. I also
took down all calls to cached_method partly since
Michael Abshoff expressed a reservation, and partly
because my testing shows that these don't help.

I have factored the patch trac_5721-part, and changed the doctests to be deterministic.

The first patch, trac_5721-a.patch contains *only* docstring revision.   The output of `.mlist()` is sorted in three places to make the test deterministic.

The second patch, trac_5721-b.patch contains only code revision. These changes are the same as in trac_5721-part.patch, and are a subset of Mike's original patch.

With the docstring changes, the tests pass either before or after the second patch. But after the second patch, there is a better than 3-fold speed improvement.
