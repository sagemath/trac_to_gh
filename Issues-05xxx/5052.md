```
If you have something like the following in a file:

```
try:
    load foo.sage
except:
    print 'uh oh'
```
it gets preparsed to this, and blows up because of the bad indentation:

```
try:
execfile("foo.py")
except:
    print 'uh oh'
```
The preparser is not honoring the leading space before the `load` statement.

The problem was in sage-preparse; it ran a lstrip() on the line and never took into consideration the indentation.

I wanted to add some doctests, since as we see here, anything not tested is broken -- do the files in `$SAGE_ROOT/local/bin` get doctested?
