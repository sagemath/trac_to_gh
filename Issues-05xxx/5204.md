1. A basic bug in the wrapper, which is probably easy to fix:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve('8320e1').change_ring(QuadraticField(-191,'x'))
sage: E.simon_two_descent()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
---> 98     ans = sage_eval(v, {'Mod': _gp_mod, 'y': K.gen(0)})
NameError: name 'ans' is not defined
```

The problem is my choice of 'x' as generator name for the number field.  The fix is to always change the variable of the base number field to 'a' before feeding anything to pari.

Review:  I can only deduce that rlm did not actually test this!

I have added a second patch (apply after the first one) which checks that K is not QQ before changing names!

Attachment [trac_5204-b.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket5204/trac_5204-b.patch) by @JohnCremona created at 2009-02-20 09:55:02

The trouble is that after changing the name of the field's generator (in that example from 'i' to 'a') there is no coercion from the old field to the new one, even though they only differ i nthe name of the gen.

This could obviously be hacked, and I have done so, but it is not very elegant:   since E's field has changed you have to hack again to get the points found back on the original curve which has the original base field.

I'm sure that there is a better coercion-based way of doing this.  But the tests now pass.  Apply new patch after the other two.

The following example actually came up today:

```
sage: K.<b>=QuadraticField(43)
sage: E=EllipticCurve([0,0,0,0,(-3697884*b - 24248647)])
sage: E.simon_two_descent()
NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
...
NameError: name 'ans' is not defined
```

This is after the patches are applied, so bad news.  I called the field generator 'b' since earlier I had called it 'a' and thought that might be the problem.

It turns out that it is a bug in simon's ell.gp:

Denis Simon says:

```
Dear John,

OK, this is really a bug of ell.gp

The problem is that due to a low real precision, the sign
of an algebraic number at some real embedding is misevaluated.

For a quick fix, you have to get into the function 'nfsqrt'
and remove the small loop
for( i = 1, nf.r1,...

This is not a satisfactory solution, and I am looking for a better one.
In particular, I probably have to change the way I handle the real
embeddings. For the moment, it is just something like
subst(algebraic_number,y,nf.roots[1])

Maybe I have to do interval arithmetic...

Thank you for the report.
Denis SIMON.
```
so that will have to wait until he fixes hos gp script.  This should probably be on a different ticket...
