After some discussion on sage-combinat-devel, it was decided that `__len__` should no be used to get the size of a combinatorial class. Indeed the specifications of `__len__` says that it has to return a plain python int, whereas we want to deal with huge and even infinite sets. Unfortunately due to `__len__` being called by `list / filter / map` and maybe some other functions, it is not possible to issue a warning. So it was decided to simply remove it and issue an error, telling to call `.cardinality()` instead. The former usage of `.count()` is also deprecated.

Combinat has to be adapted to this and also to the deprecation of `iterator` in favor of `__iter__`

I'm preparing a patch to solve those issues. 

Cheers,

Florent

Dear Nicolas,

I sumbmitted a new patch which should addres all the issues except this last one:   

> In the examples (like in SemistandardTableaux), do we want to use: `[t for t in iterable]` or `list(iterable)`


I think both kind of example should by advertised. IMHO, they both are very python idiomatic, the first one allows for extra condition, the second one is shorter. The only clear argument is that the first one is slightly faster:

```
sage: timeit("it = iter(Permutations(6)); list(it)")
125 loops, best of 3: 4.57 ms per loop
sage: timeit("it = iter(Permutations(6)); list(it)")
125 loops, best of 3: 4.45 ms per loop
sage: timeit("it = iter(Permutations(6)); [i for i in it]")
125 loops, best of 3: 4.64 ms per loop
sage: timeit("it = iter(Permutations(6)); [i for i in it]")
125 loops, best of 3: 4.61 ms per loop
```
Do we really what to standardize all the doc on it ? 

Cheers,

Florent

Actually, the problem was that I forgot to re-export the patch from the
combinat server... 

I can't reproduce the problem on word but I don't have access to a 32bit machine. More precisely, `words.size_of_alphabet()` seems now to always return a sage integer. That should fix the problem. Can you please check it ?

Sorry it took so long: I had to compile sage on a 32-bit machine!

The last patch (combinatorialclass_iter_len_count_cleanup-5308-submitted.patch) applies cleanly to sage-3.4 on top of the patches for #5200 and #4549. I ran all the combinat doctests and all tests passed.

You get a positive review from me. I won't change the status though, since Nicolas might still have some issues.

Good point. The speed difference is too negligible that it seems likely to change in the future one way or the other. I guess we can just leave it as it is. Future will tell if any of the two form become more sage-combinat idiomatic. 

Positive review

It should say that one needs to use cardinality instead of `__len__`.

There are a few reasons why this doesn't work. One reason is that `__len__` must return a Python int. So, if the CombinatorialClass is too big, then calling `__len__` will raise an error, which is a bug.

Another problem is that some methods, like `__list__`, call `__len__` behind the scenes. This means that there would be deprecation warnings popping up in various places: for instance, `list(Permutations(3))` would give a warning, and it would be very confusing to a user not familiar with Python internals to see a warning about using `__len__` when they didn't obviously call `__len__`.

Instead, we decided to raise an `AttributeError`, which behaves nicely with Python's specifications on how `__len__` is to behave when called by `list/filter/map`, and also gives an appropriate error message when `len` is called directly. It really is a special case, where the usual deprecation procedure won't work.
