After some discussion on sage-combinat-devel, it was decided that `__len__` should no be used to get the size of a combinatorial class. Indeed the specifications of `__len__` says that it has to return a plain python int, whereas we want to deal with huge and even infinite sets. Unfortunately due to `__len__` being called by `list / filter / map` and maybe some other functions, it is not possible to issue a warning. So it was decided to simply remove it and issue an error, telling to call `.cardinality()` instead. The former usage of `.count()` is also deprecated.

Combinat has to be adapted to this and also to the deprecation of `iterator` in favor of `__iter__`

I'm preparing a patch to solve those issues. 

Cheers,

Florent

Dear Nicolas,

I sumbmitted a new patch which should addres all the issues except this last one:   

> In the examples (like in SemistandardTableaux), do we want to use: `[t for t in iterable]` or `list(iterable)`

I think both kind of example should by advertised. IMHO, they both are very python idiomatic, the first one allows for extra condition, the second one is shorter. The only clear argument is that the first one is slightly faster:

```
sage: timeit("it = iter(Permutations(6)); list(it)")
125 loops, best of 3: 4.57 ms per loop
sage: timeit("it = iter(Permutations(6)); list(it)")
125 loops, best of 3: 4.45 ms per loop
sage: timeit("it = iter(Permutations(6)); [i for i in it]")
125 loops, best of 3: 4.64 ms per loop

Dear Franco,

> I've looked over the changes to the words files. Everything looks good. To fix the problem with the doctests related to 96889010407L that nthiery mentioned above, just have Word_n.cardinality() (in sage/combinat/words/words.py) return a Sage Integer instead of a Python int.  If you do this, then it also deals with #4938.

Actually, the problem was that I forgot to re-export the patch from the
combinat server... 

I can't reproduce the problem on word but I don't have access to a 32bit machine. More precisely, `words.size_of_alphabet()` seems now to always return a sage integer. That should fix the problem. Can you please check it ?

Cheers,

Florent

Sorry it took so long: I had to compile sage on a 32-bit machine!

The last patch (combinatorialclass_iter_len_count_cleanup-5308-submitted.patch) applies cleanly to sage-3.4 on top of the patches for #5200 and #4549. I ran all the combinat doctests and all tests passed.

You get a positive review from me. I won't change the status though, since Nicolas might still have some issues.

Good point. The speed difference is too negligible that it seems likely to change in the future one way or the other. I guess we can just leave it as it is. Future will tell if any of the two form become more sage-combinat idiomatic.

* Oups !!! I probably let the first pass because it's typically one of the few files that triggers the pexpect issue on my fast testing machine...

* Next time I'll check also the .rst files. 

These should be fixed right now. Re-uploaded a new patch and re marked as positive reviewed.
