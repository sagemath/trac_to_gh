Here is *yet another* example of non-tested code being totally broken.  Try this in the notebook.

```
Q = GraphQuery(display_cols=['graph6','num_vertices','degree_sequence'],
   num_edges=['<=',5],min_degree=1)

Q.show(with_picture=True)
```

this silently outputs absolutely nothing. 

The doctests don't test this -- they only test that this fails (with a message) on the command line. 

Shorterm fix: completely remove this option from the documentation and code.

Lonterm fix: actually track down and fix the bug -- this would be nice, since I know the output looks good (I've seen Emily demo it).
