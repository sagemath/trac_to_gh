When looking up cached values of the p-adic L-series of an elliptic curve, there is a problem with the precision (as a powe-series in T) :

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve('389a')
sage: p = 3
sage: L = E.padic_lseries(p)
sage: L.series(3)
O(3^5) + O(3^2)*T + (2 + 2*3 + O(3^2))*T^2 + (2 + O(3))*T^3 + (1 + 3 + O(3^2))*T^4 + O(T^5)
sage: L.series(3,prec=6)
O(3^5) + O(3^2)*T + (2 + 2*3 + O(3^2))*T^2 + (2 + O(3))*T^3 + (1 + 3 + O(3^2))*T^4 + O(T^5)
```

The attached patch changes the inequality sign in question.

One slight nitpick: The trac number in the patch is missing.

And this is not going into 3.4.1 since it is basically done, so better luck in 3.4.2 :)
