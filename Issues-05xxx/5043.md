The above happens because the default GAP workspace evidently that messes up the help system.  I think this is a bug (?), probably in GAP. 

You can do the following instead:

sage: gap_console(False)
...

Or

sage: gap.SymmetricGroup?            # <--- i like this

        I am running Sage on a thinkpad with Fedora 10.

        Any suggestions would be appreciated.


    The above happens because the default GAP workspace evidently that
    messes up the help system.  I think this is a bug (?), probably in
    GAP.

    You can do the following instead:

    sage: gap_console(False)

    which will give you a gap session that by default has less
    functionality loaded than otherwise.

    ...

    Or

    sage: gap.SymmetricGroup?            # <--- i like this

    I've made this bug trac #5043:

             http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/5043

    I've also cc'd Steve Linton in case he has any remarks.
