#5662 introduced a problem when using old clisp builds which we need to use on RHEL5/Itanium since any more current clisp is hopelessly broken there. But since Gonzalo's patch fixes a real issue in the clisp interface I don't want to change any of that patch.

If we've released for 2 months without fixing this, it doesn't make sense to keep it as a blocker. Note that the lisp interface is in fact 100% completely broken right now.

As far as I can tell, this is all no longer true.

```
./sage -t devel/sage/sage/interfaces/lisp.py
sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/interfaces/lisp.py"               
	 [5.7 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 5.7 seconds
```
Random tests that seem to be working fine:

```
sage:  lisp._equality_symbol()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
<snip>
NotImplementedError: We should never reach here in the Lisp interface. Please report this as a bug.
sage: lisp.function_call('sin', ['2'])
0.90929741
sage: lisp.sin(2)
0.90929741
```
I figure this should be closed...

To release manager: I believe this should be closed. It's not even clear what doctests were ever disabled unless you look around a bit.  

In fact, #6294 seems to have cleared this up.  I suggest it be closed.
