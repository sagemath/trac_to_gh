I recently had to compute a maximum stable set in a graph with 100 vertices and ended up waiting a whole day ( to no good end ) for Sage to compute it. The current algorithm uses the library NetworkX whose algorithm is not nearly as efficient as Cliquer :

http://www.tkk.fi/~pat/cliquer.html

It is based on an algorithm published in 2002, and it gave me a result in less than a millisecond ;-)

Here are the modification I made :
- I created a spkg file containing the sources of this software for it to be available in SAGE
- I wrote the interface to use it
- I modified the Graph class to use this software instead.
- Added to the function to compute the maximum clique, I added the function Maximum independant set ( which is a similar notion for the complement of a graph, a bit more customary ). As the algorithm provided a function to compute all the maximum cliques, I also added this function

Note: The spkg can be found in http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/SPKG/cliquer-1.2.spkg

Hi,

a couple remarks:

* do not attach spkgs to trac tickets, but put them up somewhere on the web and post a link. I did that in this case
* the spkg contains binaries and object files, i.e. you need to run "make clean" on the content of the spkg
* the patch deletes working code, i.e. it should still be possible to call the NetworkX code even if it sucks
* your new code has 0% doctest coverage

There is more, but the above should keep you busy for a while :)

Cheers,

Michael

ncohen,

If the patch on this ticket is no longer needed, can you delete the "[with patch, needs work]" in the title?  If it is still needed, can you either reopen this ticket so the patch is not lost or move the patch to another ticket that is open?  It is confusing to have a patch that "needs work" on a closed ticket.

Thanks.
