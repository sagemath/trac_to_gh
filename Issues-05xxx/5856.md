We have

sage: type(EllipticCurve(GF(11), [1,2]))

```

See also #5857.
This means that if you make a curve over Z/pZ then basically nothing works, but if you make the same curve over GF(p), there is tons of functionality.

<a id='comment:2'></a>I see two options:

1. Change the `EllipticCurve` constructor so that if it is given `Zmod(p)` for a prime number `p`, it actually returns the corresponding elliptic curve over `GF(p)`.  This would probably only take a couple of minutes to do.  However, this means that creating a curve over `Zmod(5)` would return a different type than creating a curve over `Zmod(4)`.

2. We keep creating the curve over `Zmod(p)` as before but we attach to it the corresponding curve over `GF(p)` (cached).  We put in the headers of all the methods from `GF(p)` and have them call the corresponding methods from `GF(p)` to do all the work.  This is a somewhat ugly.

Right now I like the first option better than the second.  But maybe there are better ideas out there, or convincing arguments in favour of one thing or the other.

<a id='comment:3'></a>I vote with Alex for 1.  This is in fact similar to the following:

```
Loading Sage library. Current Mercurial branch is: test2
sage: E = EllipticCurve(ZZ, [1,2,3,4,5])
sage: E.base_ring()
Integer Ring
sage: E.conductor()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

AttributeError: 'EllipticCurve_generic' object has no attribute 'conductor'
```
as compared to 

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve([1,2,3,4,5])
sage: E.base_ring()
Rational Field
sage: E.conductor()
10351
```
i.e. we already choose to use the field of fractions as base ring when the entries are integers, and if we try to insist otherwise we get an ell_generic on which we can do rather little.

Of course a purist would say that there is no such thing as an elliptic curve over ZZ (it would have to have everywhere good reduction), and we do not allow singular models.

<a id='comment:5'></a>I was expecting that here,

```
sage: F = Zmod(101) 
 	92	        sage: EllipticCurve(F, [2, 3]) 
 	93	        Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + 2*x + 3 over Ring of integers modulo 101 
 	94	        sage: E = EllipticCurve([F(2), F(3)]) 
 	95	        sage: type(E) 
 	96	        <class 'sage.schemes.elliptic_curves.ell_finite_field.EllipticCurve_finite_field'> 
```
both would end up as EllipticCurve_finite_field objects, but I guess that we have to have a way of constructing the other things, so that is ok.
But would it not be better to change the base_ring (and base_field) of E in the second case to GF(101)?

Next (but not this patch's fault at all):

```
sage: R = Zmod(101)
sage: is_Field(R)
True
sage: is_FiniteField(R)
False
```

Now the second is justified since the is_*() functions are supposed to do a type test, not prove a theorem, but then why should the first not also return False?  Should this be a new ticket?


Here:

```
227	 	        raise ValueError, "sequence of coefficients must have length at 2 or 5" 
 	246	        raise ValueError, "sequence of coefficients must have length between 2 and 5" 
```
It is [2,5] and not [2..5], and the only valid lengths are 2 and 5, so can we put that back to how it was?  

Sorry to be such a pain with my reviews...I'll give it a positive review if the very last point is seen to.

Both of these do end up as `EllipticCurve_finite_field` objects, which is fine because (mathematically) `Zmod(101)` is a finite field.  However, I did not want to just change the base ring to `GF(101)` because I don't think it is necessary, and after all the user specified that she wanted the base ring to be `Zmod(101)`.  It's a bit pedantic, but we should give the user the object she asks for (if possible), not something that's isomorphic to it.  I think the point becomes more clear in another situation, which I ran into while testing this code: say you have an elliptic curve over a number field, and you take its reduction at some good prime.  You end up with an elliptic curve over what is mathematically a finite field, so should we just force this curve to be over `GF(q)` rather than `Residue field of...`?  We would be throwing away some information here, and I think we shouldn't.

So my philosophy in this patch was that we keep the base ring that the user asked for, but we're smart enough to recognise that it's (mathematically) a finite field so we create an elliptic curve of the appropriate type.

I noticed this as well when writing the code because I was getting inconsistent behaviour from these two functions.  It's a bit annoying for the developer (since we somehow assume that `is_*()` just checks types), but I guess it is documented...

Sorry about this one, I saw it from the corner of my eye and my hands did the typing before the brain had time to process it properly.  Also the "at" in "length at 2 or 5" confused me.  I've changed it now, and replaced the patch.
