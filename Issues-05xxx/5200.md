This patches improves subwords and subsets and deals with several issues: 
1. It implements subsets for finite multisets (sets with repetitions). 

``` 
sage: Subsets([2,2,3], multiset=True).list() 
[[], [2], [3], [2, 2], [2, 3], [2, 2, 3]] 
``` 
1. It implement `__contains__` which was missing for subsets and subwords: 
   Before: 

``` 
sage: st = Subsets([1,2,2,3]); Set([1,2]) in st 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
NotImplementedError                       Traceback (most recent call last) 
``` 
     After: 

``` 
sage: st = Subsets([1,2,2,3]); Set([1,2]) in st 
True 
``` 
1. It fixes a bug in smallest_positions: 
   Before: 

``` 
sage: sage.combinat.subword.smallest_positions([2,4,3,3,1,2],[1,3,3]) 
[4, 4, 4] 
``` 
     After: 

``` 
sage.combinat.subword.smallest_positions([2,4,3,3,1,2],[1,3,3]) 
False 
``` 
     which means that 113 is not a subword of 243312.  
4. It finally improves the doc and the tests. 

Cheers,

Florent

It has been decided (direct talk with Nicolas + irssi with Mike) that the user has to explicitely set that he want multisets. Therefore, on the contrary that is anounced, the following is not working:

```
sage: Subsets([2,2,3]).list()
[[], [2], [3], [2, 2], [2, 3], [2, 2, 3]]
```
Instead one should write

```
sage: Subsets([2,2,3], multiset=True).list()
[[], [2], [3], [2, 2], [2, 3], [2, 2, 3]]
```
