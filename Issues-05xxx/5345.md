This patch has two changes to the transpose method in matrix_dense.pyx to provide about a 15% speedup.  If this is accepted, I'll look into the other non-sparse routines for transpose and antitranspose.

1.  A double loop indexes into the list of matrix entries using multiplication to create a reordered list for the transpose.  The effect of the multiplications is replaced by repeated additions.

2.  Retrieving the list in the original matrix makes a copy with list().  This has been replaced by the internal _list() to just reference the original.

Passes  sage -t  for  matrix2.pyx  and  matrix_dense.pyx

```
m = identity_matrix(5000)
time m.transpose()
```
Timings (user + system):

* 11.94s : Stock 3.3
* 11.20s : No multiplication
* 10.18s : No multiplication, with _list()

Component: **linear algebra**

Keywords: **transpose**

I think we can obtain a much bigger speedup if we replace the inner loop:

```
...
    for i in xrange(nr):
        f.append(e[i*nc+j])
...
```
with

```
...
    f.extend(e[j::nc])
...
```

and we should do just the same thing for antitranspose a few lines further

Yann - I like it.  And yes, the antitranspose definitely needs a similar treatment.

I swapped out the inner loop for the suggested slicing.  Same test run as listed above, and I got a total time of 10.14s.  So not a major speedup, but still a gain.

I'll get back to this in the next couple of days and maybe try to do some more timings with multiple runs with the cache'ing of the list turned off.

This transpose function has another problem, it copies the entries multiple times which is very bad for memory usage. For example I can't transpose a 5000x5000 matrix on my laptop.
I suggest something like this (but maybe I'm missing something here?)

```
        (nc, nr) = (self.ncols(), self.nrows())
        trans = self.new_matrix(nrows = nc, ncols = nr,
                                copy=False,
                                coerce=False)
        for j in xrange(nc):
            for i in xrange(nr):
                trans[j,i]=self[i,j]

        if self.subdivisions is not None:
            row_divs, col_divs = self.get_subdivisions()
            trans.subdivide(col_divs, row_divs)
        return trans
```
(sorry, no time to do a proper patch right now)

PS: I also think that there should be an optimized version af transpose in matrix_integer_dense.pyx, but it's probably for another ticket.

I had no time to do it, but of course I did it... Patch added implementing the idea above, plus unsafe access. It's a standalone patch (no need to apply yours) based on sage-3.3.

sage -testall successful.

And some statistics:

```
Before:

sage: m=identity_matrix(3000)
sage: time m2=m.transpose(); m3=m.antitranspose()
CPU times: user 14.13 s, sys: 1.11 s, total: 15.44 s
Wall time: 15.44 s
sage: get_memory_usage()
1254.28125

After:

sage: m=identity_matrix(3000)
sage: time m2=m.transpose(); m3=m.antitranspose()
CPU times: user 2.92 s, sys: 0.46 s, total: 3.38 s
Wall time: 3.38 s
sage: get_memory_usage()
835.6171875
```

I hope it's not too rude to make a patch for your ticket...

Cheers,
      Yann

Yann,

No problem with working up a patch.  I'm learning my way around Sage, and I've got plenty else to keep me busy.

Yes, I think the original worked with four copies of the matrix entries, so this version will just access the original and make the new transposed version, cutting out two copies.

For the record:  5000 x 5000 identity matrix as above, on same hardware.  Your changes result in 2.46s total time for me, so I'm seeing almost a 5x speedup.

I can't find a transpose() in matrix_integer_dense.pyx.  But if there's more like this to be done, would you like to do it on a new ticket (and cc me)?  I didn't see any other matrix classes that might benefit from this sort of speedup - most seemed cython-ized already, both dense and sparse.

I'm going to give this a positive review for the logic, but I don't feel qualified to comment on the cython-ization, since I'm not at all familiar with that, and I'm not sure about policy for the "unsafe" methods.  So I'll change the summary to needing a second look.

Rob

As you can see 15.44s --> 3.38s on my machine, or 11.94s --> 2.46s on Rob's one represent more than a 15% improved performance :). You should change the release tour accordingly.

For example, if p1 is the previous performance time and p2 is the new and improved performance time, how do I calculate the percentage improvement? This assumes that both p1 and p2 are both expressed in the same unit of measurement, e.g. seconds.",

This might be a stupid question: For the record, can you please provide a mathematical formula for calculating the percentage improvement in time/memory? For example, if p1 is the previous performance time and p2 is the new and improved performance time, how do I calculate the percentage improvement? This assumes that both p1 and p2 are both expressed in the same unit of measurement, e.g. seconds.

Minh,

For small changes, I'd quote (p1-p2)/p1 as a percentage.  So 10 seconds down to 8 seconds would be a 20% improvement.  When that percentage gets close to 100%, (like over 50%, 60%, 70%) I'd switch to a factor as a "speedup" given by p1/p2.  From 10 seconds down to 1 seconds would be an 90% improvement, but I'd quote a 10x (10 times) factor.  So for the release tour, I'd just quote a 5x or a "factor of 5" improvement for these results.  The really curious can come see the exact numbers for themselves.  Hope this helps.

Rob
