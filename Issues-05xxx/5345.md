This patch has two changes to the transpose method in matrix_dense.pyx to provide about a 15% speedup.  If this is accepted, I'll look into the other non-sparse routines for transpose and antitranspose.

1.  A double loop indexes into the list of matrix entries using multiplication to create a reordered list for the transpose.  The effect of the multiplications is replaced by repeated additions.

2.  Retrieving the list in the original matrix makes a copy with list().  This has been replaced by the internal _list() to just reference the original.

Passes  sage -t  for  matrix2.pyx  and  matrix_dense.pyx

```
m = identity_matrix(5000)
time m.transpose()
```
Timings (user + system):

* 11.20s : No multiplication
* 10.18s : No multiplication, with _list()

A 18% speed improvement is never "trivial" for something like a basic operation like this :)

I swapped out the inner loop for the suggested slicing.  Same test run as listed above, and I got a total time of 10.14s.  So not a major speedup, but still a gain.

I'll get back to this in the next couple of days and maybe try to do some more timings with multiple runs with the cache'ing of the list turned off.

This transpose function has another problem, it copies the entries multiple times which is very bad for memory usage. For example I can't transpose a 5000x5000 matrix on my laptop.
I suggest something like this (but maybe I'm missing something here?)

```
        (nc, nr) = (self.ncols(), self.nrows())
        trans = self.new_matrix(nrows = nc, ncols = nr,
                                copy=False,
                                coerce=False)
        for j in xrange(nc):
            for i in xrange(nr):
                trans[j,i]=self[i,j]

        if self.subdivisions is not None:
            row_divs, col_divs = self.get_subdivisions()
            trans.subdivide(col_divs, row_divs)
        return trans
```
(sorry, no time to do a proper patch right now)

PS: I also think that there should be an optimized version af transpose in matrix_integer_dense.pyx, but it's probably for another ticket.

sage -testall successful.

And some statistics:

After:

Yann,

No problem with working up a patch.  I'm learning my way around Sage, and I've got plenty else to keep me busy.

Yes, I think the original worked with four copies of the matrix entries, so this version will just access the original and make the new transposed version, cutting out two copies.

For the record:  5000 x 5000 identity matrix as above, on same hardware.  Your changes result in 2.46s total time for me, so I'm seeing almost a 5x speedup.

I can't find a transpose() in matrix_integer_dense.pyx.  But if there's more like this to be done, would you like to do it on a new ticket (and cc me)?  I didn't see any other matrix classes that might benefit from this sort of speedup - most seemed cython-ized already, both dense and sparse.

I'm going to give this a positive review for the logic, but I don't feel qualified to comment on the cython-ization, since I'm not at all familiar with that, and I'm not sure about policy for the "unsafe" methods.  So I'll change the summary to needing a second look.

Is it possible for you to provide some information on the computer/system architecture that you used to get the above statistics? The improved performance is great news and I'll include this in the release tour at
[http://wiki.sagemath.org/sage-3.4](http://wiki.sagemath.org/sage-3.4)
And it would also be good to have some info about the hardware under which you arrived at the above statistics.

Minh,

Timings for size 5000 identity matrix (at very top, then buried in the middle of comment 7 are on stock KUbuntu 8.10 with 3 GHz dual-core processor (Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Duo CPU  E8500 @ 3.16GHz) with 8 GB memory.
