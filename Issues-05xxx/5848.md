**Attachment:** [untabify.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket5848/untabify.patch)

Patch choked twice on `modular/dirichlet.py`, which seems odd, given how fresh it is, and I can't really tell why.  I was applying it to an upgraded 3.4.1.rc4   Maybe it will patch better under mabshoff's firm guidance.

Builds just fine.  Passes `sage -testall`, except some unpickling errors in `structure/sage_object.pyx` and `algebras/quaternion_algebra_element.py` concerning `QuaternionAlgebraElements`, but the changes to these files don't appear implicated in these errors,

Documentation builds fine as well (PDF of reference manual) with no TeX errors.

Positive review, subject to the business above about patching `modular/dirichlet.py`.

Ok, the patch still applies modulo three the diff for three files 

* sage/algebras/algebra_order.py
* sage/algebras/algebra_order.py
* sage/algebras/algebra_order_ideal.py

that no longer exist. This patch besides the latex one I just merged at #5610 has high risks for rejects, but since I merged the other one I might as well merge this one.

David: Some of the padics files are touched, so if you rebase your patch bomb in the morning please also apply the patch I will post in a minute.

Cheers,

Michael
