Consider:

```
sage: QA = QuaternionAlgebra(QQ, -1, -1)
sage: foo = QA(3.0); foo
3.00000000000000
sage: parent(foo)
Quaternion algebra with generators (i, j, k) over Rational Field
sage: parent(foo.vector()[0])
Real Field with 53 bits of precision
```
I don't think the initializer should let you construct an element with RR members but still claim to be over QQ.

I think that QA(3.0) should definitely throw an exception, just as the following does:

```

For what it's worth, this behaviour changed and became more consistent with the recent reworking of the quaternion algebra code:

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Sage Version 3.4, Release Date: 2009-03-11                         |
| Type notebook() for the GUI, and license() for information.        |
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage: sage: QA = QuaternionAlgebra(QQ, -1, -1)
sage: sage: foo = QA(3.0); foo
3
sage: parent(foo)
Quaternion Algebra (-1, -1) with base ring Rational Field
sage: foo[0]
3
sage: parent(foo[0])
Rational Field
```

Do we want to consider this fixed now?
