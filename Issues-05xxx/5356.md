type(100r) returns

<type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>

in the notebook in 3.3.  Similarly, type(1.0r) returns

<type 'sage.rings.real_mpfr.RealLiteral'>

Both of these examples work fine on the command line (i.e., return python int and float, respectively).

This patch fixes the problem and passes doctests in preparser.py.  Someone more familiar with the preparse might look at it, but it's a positive review for me.
