It might happen, but it is something bigger, i.e. we should add a check in the startup script that this is the right arch to begin with, i.e. it should be another ticket altogether.

<a id='comment:6'></a>The patch (spaces-5261.patch) requires that the patch at #7546 be applied first.  

This patch is a hack to ensure there are no spaces in the path.  It would be much better to fix the components that don't support it, but there are too many of them for me to be confident that I found them all.

It also does the location checking from #5254, but I don't actually think it's necessary with the hack above.

The naming Sage-x.y.z and changing from tar.gz were taken care of in #7546.

Someone with a better understanding of the copyright situation should change data/extcode/sage/ext/mac-app/Sage.app/Contents/Info.plist (it's an xml file) in two places.

Location changes seem to work okay, I'll put in final positive review once I've checked a few more things.

Copyright is now #7622, naming for PPC/Intel is #7623.
