This patch changes all_graph_colorings to use the C++ dancing links implementation instead of the Cython implementation.

* sage -testall is all ok
* valgrind is ok
* Roughly 5x speedup on some random graphs (see test.sage):

Sage 3.4 timing:

```
carlo@ka37:~/work/code/graphdlx$ sage test.sage 
5 loops, best of 3: 158 ms per loop
carlo@ka37:~/work/code/graphdlx$ sage test.sage 
5 loops, best of 3: 158 ms per loop
carlo@ka37:~/work/code/graphdlx$ sage test.sage 
5 loops, best of 3: 157 ms per loop
```
Sage 3.4 with patch timing:

```
5 loops, best of 3: 33.5 ms per loop
carlo@ka37:~/work/code/graphdlx$ sage test.sage 
5 loops, best of 3: 33.1 ms per loop
carlo@ka37:~/work/code/graphdlx$ sage test.sage 
5 loops, best of 3: 33.3 ms per loop
```

Works for me.  I'd like to see the test.sage file be reworked into a Test class for randomized testing.  search_src('class Test') for examples.

sage: g = Graph()
sage: c = 0
sage: for h in graph_coloring.all_graph_colorings(g,0,False): c+=1
------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occured in SAGE.
This probably occured because a *compiled* component
of SAGE has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
or is not properly wrapped with _sig_on, _sig_off.
You might want to run SAGE under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
SAGE will now terminate (sorry).
