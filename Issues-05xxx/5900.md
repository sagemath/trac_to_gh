On Ubuntu jaunty, the system Python is 2.6 but Sage is built with Python 2.5.  This results in problems in a few places where Sage directly invokes a python program rather than running it via python.  For example, running "trial" rather than "python $(which trial)" would result in "trial" being started with Python 2.6.

I've attached the set of patches that I applied in order to deal with this issue in Jaunty.  I believe they should be harmless for Sage, since it puts $SAGE_LOCAL at the start of PATH, ahead of any system copies of trial/twistd/etc. that might exist.

They look good to me.  I'm not sure if they are still relevant since Sage switched to Python 2.6, but they shouldn't hurt.
