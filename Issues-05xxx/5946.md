We ran into this at #5921.  There are two separate issues: polynomials with coefficients in a p-adic field should not have a `content()` method, since it doesn't make sense (the same way that having a `content()` method for polynomials with rational coefficients doesn't make sense).

The second issue is with the `content()` method for polynomials with coefficients in p-adic rings.  Here's an example:

```
sage: P.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: f = x + 2
sage: f.content()
1
sage: fp = f.change_ring(pAdicRing(2, 10))
sage: fp
(1 + O(2^10))*x + (2 + O(2^11))
sage: fp.content()
0
```
