From [sage-support](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_frm/thread/5dcc22b42a7227d4):

```
sage: h = PermutationGroupElement('(1,3,2)') 
sage: k = PermutationGroupElement('(1,2,3),(4,5)') 
sage: h
(1,3,2)
sage: k^2
(1,3,2)
sage: k^2 == h, h == k^2 
(False, True)
```
Clearly these comparisons should return the same thing. robertwb pointed out in the thread that, especially since the parents are not explicitly defined here, they should both return True.

I'll post a patch, but I don't know much about this code, and I don't want to slow things down too much.  If anyone else has a faster way, please produce a new patch.

This will fix the error, but doesn't fix the underlying issue that the coercions should happen *before* cmp gets called. Also, I anticipate it will be a massive speed regression--if the sizes are inequal then the longer one should simply be checked to make sure it fixes the larger elements.

Hi Robert,

Much improved.  Correct and faster.  Passed all tests in sage/groups/perm_gps.

Do you think the code for the second loop checking the fixed elements of the longer permutation would be more readable if it mimicked the first loop?  In other words, view the plain i's in the comparison as self.perm[i] and then have everything else match up exactly with the first loop:

```
for i from self.n <= i < right.n:
    if i < right.perm[i]:
        return -swap
    elif i > right.perm[i]:
        return swap
```

John,

I like the clear explanation of the ordering on permutations.

Do the examples with < and > (or != and == in the referee patch) really need to come from the generators of some group?  This just seems to make it harder for someone to decipher.  Would it be clearer to just make two or three elements using `PermutationGroupElement()`, possibly with different "sizes", and then put them through some of the possible comparisons to exercise as much of the new code as possible?

After a double colon, ReST expects some indented text, and in fact if you use 

```
TESTS::

another sentence::
```
in a docstring for a function not starting with an underscore, you get a warning about that.  If you only use one colon after TESTS, the double colon at the end of the next part still signifies an upcoming verbatim block.

As far as the original examples, I don't think they're very illuminating.  I don't think it's that important, though, because it's not a docstring which appears in the reference manual or in a method people will be explicitly calling very much (and hence they won't be asking for interactive help about it, either).

Robert,

If you were agreeable to the cosmetic changes I suggested above for the last bit of the code, then I'd roll up all the patches (your's, John's and mine) into one and John could finish off a review.

OK, final patch (trac_5537_perm_compare) has Robert's "perm-cmp" patch, John's "referee" patch, and my code changes listed above all in one.  So this should be the only file Michael Abshoff will have to deal with.

I think the ball is in your court now, John.
