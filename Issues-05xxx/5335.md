And another issue:

```

[08:32am] mabs: re: "inline text cells"  - I took that from the ticket and I 
tend not to change the summaries in the listing so the original can be easily 
found in trac.
[08:34am] cwitty: I wasn't talking about the ticket, I was talking about this:
[08:34am] cwitty: One of the new major usability
[08:34am] cwitty: 97improvements to the notebook is the addition and integration of the
[08:34am] cwitty: 98TinyMCE editor which now allows to add inline text cells to the notebook
[08:34am] cwitty: 99via a very nice WYSIWYG editor.
