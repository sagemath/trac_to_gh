It's probably bad that it's even using strings here, but this fixes things a bit...

Now, the use of eval() here is bad... for example

sage: sage: R.<x> = QQ[]; S.<q,t> = R[]; F = FractionField(S);
sage: x in S
False

is still wrong. There are better ways of going about this but at least it doesn't crash. And I'm more OK with a False negative, but if this is accepted a new ticket should be created to follow up.

BAD

```
15:38 < wstein2> Ouch.
15:38 < wstein2> It has:
15:38 < wstein2> " except SyntaxError, NameError:"
15:38 < wstein2> As a new addition.
15:38 < wstein2> That is a major annoying python gotcha.
15:38 < wstein2> That assigns the exception to NameError.
15:38 < wstein2> It should be
15:38 < wstein2> except (SyntaxError, NameError):
15:38 < wstein2> Ooops!
15:39 < mabs> mk
15:39 < wstein2> I don't know why that would do any good either...
15:40 < wstein2> also, the patch should have a doctest
15:40 < mabs> Hmm, that might be difficult to do.
15:41 < wstein2> in fac the patch does *not* fix the problem.
15:41 < wstein2> You only wrote "all tests pass".
15:41 < wstein2> But that is because there are no new tests.
15:41 < wstein2> That ticket is a mess.
15:41 < mhansen> Patch up for #5298.
15:41 < wstein2> So you wrote: "With the patch applied to my 3.3.rc2 merge tree all doctests pass. "
15:41 < mabs> I did not write that about #5291.
15:41 < wstein2> But there was nothing to test that the problem was fixed.
15:42 < mabs> I wrote that about #5287
15:42 < wstein2> I'm talking about #5292.
15:42 < wstein2> Sorry.
15:42 -!- You're now known as wstein-5292
15:42 < mabs> Yes.
