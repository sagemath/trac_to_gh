Old French version:

```
Il y a une subtilité dans la définition des nombres complexes. Comme
mentionné ci-dessus, le symbole  ``i`` représente une racine carrée de
:math:`-1`, mais il s'agit d'une racine carrée *formelle* de
:math:`-1`, qui n'appartient pas aux nombres complexes. L'appel ``CC(i)``
renvoie la racine carrée complexe de :math:`-1`.
```

New English version:

```
There is one subtlety in defining complex numbers: as mentioned
above, the symbol ``i`` represents a square root of :math:`-1`, but it is a
*formal* square root of :math:`-1`.  Calling
``CC(i)`` returns the complex square root of :math:`-1`.

Hi Marc,

I was wondering where this was fixed?  In general, we don't close tickets until the appropriate changes have been merged into the main tree.

Actually I sent you an email asking precisely this question when I closed this ticket--but it seems you saw my action on the ticket first. Sorry for my mistake; I have just reopened #4318 too.

And now #5850 has been closed, so I think this ticket should be closed too.
