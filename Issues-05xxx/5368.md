In released sage-3.3, this gives an infinite loop in the command line or notebook in OS X and Linux (sagenb.org):

```
var('x,y')
plot3d(x*y^2 - sin(x), (-1,1), (-1,1))
```

Pretty bad!!

This is (probably) because fast_float isn't being used for some weird reason:

```
sage: var('x,y')
(x, y)
sage: plot3d(x*y^2 - sin(x), (-1,1), (-1,1))
