In released sage-3.3, this gives an infinite loop in the command line or notebook in OS X and Linux (sagenb.org):

```
var('x,y')
plot3d(x*y^2 - sin(x), (-1,1), (-1,1))
```

Pretty bad!!

This is (probably) because fast_float isn't being used for some weird reason:

```
sage: var('x,y')
(x, y)
sage: plot3d(x*y^2 - sin(x), (-1,1), (-1,1))

William's assessment was correct; the function was not being converted into a fast_float form because parametric_plot3d.adapt_to_callable was being invoked incorrectly. I tried to update the documentation of this function according to what I figured out about its workings, so that this mistake might be avoided in the future.

No need to add a complete email address, the account name in trac is sufficient.
