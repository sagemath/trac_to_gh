```
Right now, the html generated for a worksheet does not include a header specifying the encoding, which confuses browsers: http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/t/3d4b400f5afe66fb

As suggested by the OP of that thread, we should add

```
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" />
```
to the worksheet html.

This would be nice to get into 3.3 since it causes trouble for IE users.

Okay. I set the milestone to 3.4.1 because I wasn't sure if you were still considering these kinds of tickets for 3.3, and I didn't add a "[with patch, needs review]" because it's not quite done -- we also need to get Twisted to add the correct header, and I don't know how to do that. I was going to ping some of the usual notebook suspects and ask for some help. I see you've already done that. :)

Also, before we charge ahead and merge this, perhaps we should try and find out if anyone uses notebooks *not* encoded in UTF-8...it seems like we already should be encoding everything UTF-8, but as our continuing problems with accents show, there is some potential for problems to crop up.

Ok, if it isn't ready it should be marked as such. Any ticket with a patch should have the "with patch" marker since there is no way to find tickets with patch otherwise that I am aware of.

It sounds like this ticket will miss the boat in 3.3, but there is another, closely related ticket with patch that needs work at #4547 by Mike, so it seems likely that this will come up again in 3.4 or later.
