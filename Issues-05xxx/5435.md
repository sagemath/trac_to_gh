The attached patch changes the message from

```
Using cached timings.
```
to

```
Using cached timings to run slower doctests first.
```

Hopefully this is enough to explain the otherwise surprising long pause at the beginning of parallel testing runs.

Mhh, I think this needs fixing, but I think `slower` is the wrong term here. Maybe `longer` is better? Either way I want this patch to go in, but if there is a consensus I would be happy to change the patch.

Cheers,

Michael
