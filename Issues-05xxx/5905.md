I worked out what causes this sort of thing.  Suppose you add a file to the ref man by adding to the table of contents, in a branch, and rebuild the docs to test.  Then (after making a patch, say) you roll back that branch to a version where that file is no longer mentioned in the toc.  But the file *.rst (which was automatically created earlier) remains in the doc tree even after both "sage -b" and "sage -docbuild ...", and causes this warning.

I don't know the right way to fix this.  Perhaps Sphinx could just delete such files (it seems too much for "sage -b" to do).
