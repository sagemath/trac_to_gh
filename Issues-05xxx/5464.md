If I download sage-3.4.rc1 and type 'make', the documentation does not get built.  This means that clicking "Help" in the notebook produces a page with dead links to the tutorial, etc.  Sage absolutely needs this documentation easily available.

(#5414 is also filed under "notebook" -- I checked "documentation" and "build" looking for this kind of thing before creating the ticket.)

Feel free to close this one.
