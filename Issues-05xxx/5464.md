If I download sage-3.4.rc1 and type 'make', the documentation does not get built.  This means that clicking "Help" in the notebook produces a page with dead links to the tutorial, etc.  Sage absolutely needs this documentation easily available.


Component: **build**

This is a dupe of #5414 - even though the summary of that ticket doesn't make it obvious :(

Feel free to close this one.
