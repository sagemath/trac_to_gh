Here's a rebased version.  Since the previous one had a positive review, I assume this one does, too.

However, I think we also need something like the attached 'quatalg-reference.patch' to process the moved files for inclusion into the reference manual, but when I apply it and try to build the docs, I get error messages like

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Applications/sage/devel/sage/doc/common/builder.py", line 668, in <module>
    getattr(get_builder(name), type)()
  File "/Applications/sage/devel/sage/doc/common/builder.py", line 348, in _wrapper
    for module_name in self.get_modified_modules():
  File "/Applications/sage/devel/sage/doc/common/builder.py", line 415, in get_modified_modules
    added, changed, removed = env.get_outdated_files(False)
  File "/Applications/sage_builds/sage-3.4.1.alpha0/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/Sphinx-0.5.1-py2.5.egg/sphinx/environment.py", line 400, in get_outdated_files
    newmtime = path.getmtime(self.doc2path(docname))
  File "/Applications/sage_builds/sage-3.4.1.alpha0/local/lib/python2.5/posixpath.py", line 143, in getmtime

OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/Applications/sage_builds/sage-3.4.1.alpha0/devel/sage-main/doc/en/reference/sage/algebras/quaternion_algebra.rst'
```
(This fix should have been part of #5520, I think.)
