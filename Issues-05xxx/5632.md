Here's a rebased version.  Since the previous one had a positive review, I assume this one does, too.

However, I think we also need something like the attached 'quatalg-reference.patch' to process the moved files for inclusion into the reference manual, but when I apply it and try to build the docs, I get error messages like

```
Traceback (most recent call last):

    getattr(get_builder(name), type)()

```
(This fix should have been part of #5520, I think.)
