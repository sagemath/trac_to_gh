I have worksheet with the word "Gr√∂bner" in it which prevents me from using the notebook at all because the listing of worksheets crashes.

Before umlauts where displayed wrong but at least they didn't crash the server.

I tested cloning on sage.math and it works there. I will only merge trac_5176.2.patch. 

Jason: when you review tickets with multiple patches please make clear which patches need to be applied. In this case it was obvious once I looked at both patches.

Cheers,

Michael
