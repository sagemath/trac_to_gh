This patch is wrong. Instead of deleting the tests they should either be rewritten as 

```
sage: f !=g
True
```
or

```
sage: f<g in [-1,1]

And I forgot to mention: In some cases these comparisons are deterministic, so it needs to be dealt with on a case by case basis. I am not sure what applies in this case.
