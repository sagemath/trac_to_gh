+1 to getting rid of them both.   Nobody knows what they are really, and they aren't needed, and they are probably partly broken given the bad coverage (at least of integer).

Hmm, this patch fails to apply:

```
mabshoff@sage:/scratch/mabshoff/sage-3.4.1.rc3/devel/sage$ hg import 5735-remove-extended-QQ-ZZ.patch 
applying 5735-remove-extended-QQ-ZZ.patch
patching file sage/rings/extended_rational_field.py
Hunk #1 FAILED at 0
1 out of 1 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file sage/rings/extended_rational_field.py.rej
abort: patch failed to apply
```
It should be trivial to fix since this hunk just deletes extended_rational_field.py.
