+1 to getting rid of them both.   Nobody knows what they are really, and they aren't needed, and they are probably partly broken given the bad coverage (at least of integer).


Component: **basic arithmetic**

It should be trivial to fix since this hunk just deletes extended_rational_field.py.

For the record: I merged  trac_5735-remove-extended-QQ-ZZ.patch and trac_5735-pickle-number-fix.patch and also checked in the changes to pickle_jar.tar.bz2 in data/extcode/pickle_jar/
