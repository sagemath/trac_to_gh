Since all of COIN-OR is covered by licenses that are incompatible with GNU GPL v2+, I've thought of implementing something along the lines of a knapsack problems solver. The goal of this ticket is to first implement a class for solving the subset sum problem for super-increasing sequences. The long-term goal is to implement a module for solving various knapsack problems.

The patch implements an algorithm for solving the subset sum problem for super-increasing sequences. This is useful in the Merkle-Hellman knapsack cryptosystem, which I plan to work on later.
