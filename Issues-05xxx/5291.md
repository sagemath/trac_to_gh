This problem has come up over and over again. Per default Sage saves a snapshot every 3 minutes regardless if anything has changed or not. This can add up to a *lot* of identical snapshots if a computation is left running a long time. And that in turn causes people with quotas to run out of space as reported in

I am making this a critical issue against 3.3.
