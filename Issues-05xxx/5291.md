This problem has come up over and over again. Per default Sage saves a snapshot every 3 minutes regardless if anything has changed or not. This can add up to a *lot* of identical snapshots if a computation is left running a long time. And that in turn causes people with quotas to run out of space as reported in

I am making this a critical issue against 3.3.

Cheers,

yep.  Snapshotting *only* ever writes a copy of worksheet.txt. 

REVIEW:

* positive review -- but it is not an efficient approach.  

See Trac #5300 which will be about doing the same thing more efficiently.
