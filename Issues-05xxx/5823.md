This is shared credit with Gonzalo and split off from #5662. I have taken on of his patches, integrated it into an updated clisp version and changed his workaround after a clever suggestion by William.

There are two spkgs that work together:

 http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/release-cycles-3.4.1/rc4/clisp-2.47.spkg

and

 http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/release-cycles-3.4.1/rc4/maxima-5.16.3.p0.spkg

Note that the patch from #5662 must be applied for those two above to actually pass doctests.

Cheers,

Michael

<a id='comment:3'>**Comment 3:**</a>
The `clisp-noreadline` script looks ok. The `maxima-noreadline` script, however, has a path issue:

```
tornaria@sage2:~/sage-3.4$ SAGE_ROOT=~/sage-3.4 local/bin/maxima-noreadline 
local/bin/maxima-noreadline: line 3: maxima: command not found
```
Maybe the `maxima-noreadline` script should be changed by

```
#!/bin/sh
SAGE_CLISP_DISABLE_READLINE_HACK="yes"; export SAGE_CLISP_DISABLE_READLINE_HACK
"$SAGE_ROOT/maxima" "$@"
```

OTOH, I don't know if there is a reason to use a separate script with the `-noreadline` option instead of adding a `--disable-readline` command line option to the scripts as I had done in #5662. Particularly for maxima, given that `maxima --help` actually lists `--disable-readline` as one of its command line options (it's broken now).

Other than that, the changes look good to me. I'll run the test suite a couple of times just to be sure, and report back.

Actually, shouldn't the scripts be something like:

```
#!/bin/sh
SAGE_CLISP_DISABLE_READLINE_HACK="yes"; export SAGE_CLISP_DISABLE_READLINE_HACK
exec "$SAGE_ROOT/maxima" "$@"
```
i.e. use `exec` so that we can avoid the (unnecessary) fork?

Ditto for `clisp` and `clisp-noreadline`. The script `maxima` (which is the upstream one) seems to use `exec`.

On my MacPPC, the known culprits like "calculus.py", "functional.py" or "partition.py" still behave badly. I see one new doctests failure I never have seen before:

```
sage -t -long "devel/sage/sage/calculus/tests.py"           
**********************************************************************
File "/Users/georgweber/Public/sage/sage-3.4.1.rc3/devel/sage/sage/calculus/tests.py", line 219:

Expected:
    integrate(1/sqrt(2*t^4 - 3*t^2 - 2), t, 2, 3)
Got:
    integrate(e^(-x^2)*log(x), x)
**********************************************************************
1 items had failures:
   1 of  84 in __main__.example_0

```
This might be blamed on the MacPPC "being of the bronze age", too. But I can't test this on my MacIntel (or sage.math) right now, this will have to wait for tomorrow. Since there is a slight chance that the change from clisp 2.46 to 2.47 did introduce this doctest failure, I hesitate to give a positive review for this ticket, based on my current insufficient knowledge. From mere "code reviewing" the changes in the two spkgs, all is fine resp. looks good to me.

I know they don't work out of the box. The purpose of my second batch of spkg's in #5662 was to implement this, after wstein suggestion. Sorry I neglected to comment properly.

Here's the patch to `maxima.in` (maxima script) to support `--disable-readline` option:

```
$ cat maxima-5.16.3.p1/patches/maxima.in.patch

        --lisp ) MAXIMA_LISP=$2 ; shift;;
        --lisp=*) MAXIMA_LISP=`echo "$1" | sed 's/--lisp=//'` ;;
```

And here's the version of `clisp.sh`, to be installed as `$SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/clisp`:

```
$ cat clisp-2.46.p9/patches/clisp.sh 
#!/bin/sh
case $1 in
    --disable-readline ) export SAGE_CLISP_DISABLE_READLINE_HACK=1 ; shift ;;

Yes, but what if I run `./sage -sh` and then mess with the `PATH` in some random way, i.e. prepending my alternate system-wide maxima to the PATH, etc. Then `maxima-noreadline` won't work as expected.

In the case of maxima, this is even complying with what's offered by `maxima --help`.

I am happy to address the issue with `exec "$SAGE_LOCAL"/bin/...`, but I still prefer my version since upstream clisp and maxima do not have such version.

Thoughts?

Michael
