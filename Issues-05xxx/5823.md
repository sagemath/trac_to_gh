This is shared credit with Gonzalo and split off from #5662. I have taken on of his patches, integrated it into an updated clisp version and changed his workaround after a clever suggestion by William.

There are two spkgs that work together:

 http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/release-cycles-3.4.1/rc4/clisp-2.47.spkg

and

 http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/release-cycles-3.4.1/rc4/maxima-5.16.3.p0.spkg

Note that the patch from #5662 must be applied for those two above to actually pass doctests.

The `clisp-noreadline` script looks ok. The `maxima-noreadline` script, however, has a path issue:

```
tornaria@sage2:~/sage-3.4$ SAGE_ROOT=~/sage-3.4 local/bin/maxima-noreadline 
local/bin/maxima-noreadline: line 3: maxima: command not found
```
Maybe the `maxima-noreadline` script should be changed by

```
#!/bin/sh
SAGE_CLISP_DISABLE_READLINE_HACK="yes"; export SAGE_CLISP_DISABLE_READLINE_HACK
"$SAGE_ROOT/maxima" "$@"
```

OTOH, I don't know if there is a reason to use a separate script with the `-noreadline` option instead of adding a `--disable-readline` command line option to the scripts as I had done in #5662. Particularly for maxima, given that `maxima --help` actually lists `--disable-readline` as one of its command line options (it's broken now).

Other than that, the changes look good to me. I'll run the test suite a couple of times just to be sure, and report back.

This might be blamed on the MacPPC "being of the bronze age", too. But I can't test this on my MacIntel (or sage.math) right now, this will have to wait for tomorrow. Since there is a slight chance that the change from clisp 2.46 to 2.47 did introduce this doctest failure, I hesitate to give a positive review for this ticket, based on my current insufficient knowledge. From mere "code reviewing" the changes in the two spkgs, all is fine resp. looks good to me.

Cheers, gsw

I know they don't work out of the box. The purpose of my second batch of spkg's in #5662 was to implement this, after wstein suggestion. Sorry I neglected to comment properly.

Here's the patch to `maxima.in` (maxima script) to support `--disable-readline` option:

```
$ cat maxima-5.16.3.p1/patches/maxima.in.patch

        --lisp ) MAXIMA_LISP=$2 ; shift;;

```

And here's the version of `clisp.sh`, to be installed as `$SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/clisp`:

```
$ cat clisp-2.46.p9/patches/clisp.sh 
#!/bin/sh
case $1 in

I am happy to address the issue with `exec "$SAGE_LOCAL"/bin/...`, but I still prefer my version since upstream clisp and maxima do not have such version.

Thoughts?
