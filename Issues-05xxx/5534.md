I came across this function in Sage-Combinat,

sage.combinat.subword.smallest_positions(word, subword, pos=0)

Running this function not only returns the positions in "word" where
"subword" occurs, but it modifies "subword" to be this sequence of
positions.  Is there a reason for this?  It seems to me that it should
leave "subword" unchanged, but maybe I'm not thinking of something.

```
sage: w = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
sage: ww = ["b", "d"]
sage: sage.combinat.subword.smallest_positions(w, ww)
[1, 3]
sage: w
['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
sage: ww
[1, 3]
```

Thanks,
Steve

Fixed (see the attached patch):

Now:

```
sage: w = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
sage: ww = ["b", "d"]
sage: sage.combinat.subword.smallest_positions(w, ww)
[1, 3]
sage: w
['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
sage: ww
['b', 'd']
```

Note the patch only applies on top of #5200
