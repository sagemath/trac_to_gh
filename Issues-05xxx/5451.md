Alex Lara reported on sage-support on 20090307:

```
I recently upgrade sage from 3.2.3 to 3.3. I'm also have sage 3.1.1
The thing is that the following commands give different results:

F.<theta>=FiniteField(9)
A.<t> = PolynomialRing(F)
K.<t> = FractionField(A)
f= 2/(t^2+2*t); g =t^9/(t^18 + t^10 + t^2);f+g

In 3.1.1 gives the right answer (I guess) but in 3.2.3 give an error:

ZeroDivisionError                         Traceback (most recent call
last)
...
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero in finite field.
```

In more detail that traceback is

```
ZeroDivisionError                         Traceback (most recent call last)

In sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_ring_generic.py, in the function quo_rem, the test of other.is_zero() is sometimes returning False despite other being zero!  I added some print statements and here is an example:

```
in quo_rem (parent = Univariate Polynomial Ring in t over Finite Field in theta of size 3^2)...
self =  t
other =  0
other.is_zero() =  False
A =  t
B =  0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ZeroDivisionError  
```

That is as far as I got.

This is a consequence of this:

Thanks ylchpuy: I checked that applying the patch at 5434 makes this problem go away.

Hence this ticket can be scrapped, unless we want to add a doctest somewhere.
