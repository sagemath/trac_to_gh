This patch restructures the implementation of symmetric functions in sage

The new implementation makes use of multiple realizations and the category framework. The new access to symmetric functions is via

```
sage: Sym = SymmetricFunctions(QQ)
```
Further new features that are implemented:

* The ring of symmetric functions is now endowed with a Hopf algebra structure. The coproduct and antipode are implemented (which were missing before).

* A tutorial on how to use symmetric functions in sage is included at the beginning of sf.py which is also accessible via

```
sage: SymmetricFunctions??
```

* Symmetric functions should now work a lot better with respect to  specializing parameters like `q` and `t` for Hall-Littlewood, Jack and Macdonald symmetric functions. Certain functionalities before this change were broken or not possible.

* Documentation was added to LLT polynomials (which had very sparse documentation previously).

* The `k`-bounded subspace of the ring of symmetric function was implemented. The `k`-Schur functions now live in the `k`-bounded subspace rather than in the ring of symmetric functions as before.

This patch gained tremendously by the tutorial on symmetric functions written by Jason Bandlow, a draft on the `k`-bounded subspace by Jason Bandlow, and code multiple realizations written by Franco Saliola.

Hi Mike,

I finished the doctests for the following files:

- schur.py

- homogeneous.py

- elementrary.py

- powersum.py

- monomial.py

- classical.py

- dual.py

- multiplicative.py

- orthotriang.py

- sf.py

In particular, at the beginning of sf.py I incorporated the tutorial that Jason and Nicolas
wrote (which was further down the queue) and updated it. I marked them there as coauthors in
that file.

This leaves the doctests for 

- hall_littlewood.py

- jack.py

- llt.py

- macdonald.py

- ns_macdonald.py

- sfa.py

which I suppose you will do in the next couple of days?
In particular, in the sfa.py the deprecation warnings need to be activated which I have
not yet done.

Best,

Anne

Hi Mike,

I completed the doctests for sfa.py and also rebased everything on top of 13109. Please put your changes to 

* hall_littlewood.py 

* jack.py 

* llt.py 

* macdonald.py 

on top of the current patch trac_5457-symmetric_functions-mz.patch. Unfortunately we need to abandon the sage-combinat queue for the moment since it would be very cumbersome to keep it backward compatible with 13109. I will send you a separate e-mail on how to proceed.

Cheers,

Anne

Hi Dan!

Thank you very much for your comments on the failing doctests in 

* devel/sage/sage/algebras/nil_coxeter_algebra.py

* devel/sage/sage/categories/realizations.py

They are fixed in the updated version of the patch. I do not get failures for 

* devel/sage/sage/sandpiles/sandpile.py

on my machine.

I also get a doctest failure in sandpile.py with unpatched sage-5.2.rc0 so this failure is not caused by the patch.

I rebased and folded the three patches with respect to sage-5.3.beta0 from yesterday.
It should apply cleanly now.

Dear Dan and Nicolas,

Thank you so much for your reviews and work on this patch! I incorporated the changes that Dan suggested by e-mail and folded Nicolas' review patch. In addition, Mike had some minor improvements in the documentation of llt.py which are incorporated.

The new patch should apply cleanly on sage-5.3.beta0.

This adds a `__cmp__` method for SymmetricFunctions, which was missing, and that
was uncovered by the test in llt.py. Two SymmetricFunctions instances are
compared equal if and only if they have the same base ring, which is as it
should be.

Unless I'm missing something the patch is obviously correct. I ran --testall --long
in the sf directory and all tests passed.

There is no compelling reason to have a cmp function for symmetric functions (nor its bases). The order has no meaning, and equality testing should be taken care of by UniqueRepresentation.

So altogether, I'd rather not add a cmp function, and instead would rather replace the failing test by:

    sage: cmp(L3Q, L3Z) != 0

which is platform independent, and is all we care about. We could even just discard this test.

Now, I don't want to slow down the integration of this patch, so I am happy leaving this issue for a latter ticket, at the author's choice.

Cheers,
                   Nicolas

Nicolas argued that there is no real reason for Sym to have a `__cmp__`
method and there is no reason for the test to be deterministic. We don't
care if two rings or ring elements are > or < than each other, just whether they are distinct.
Therefore the test that failed can be rewritten and the `__cmp___` method
is not needed.

This patch removes the `__cmp__` method from llt polynomials instead
of adding one for sf. In fact, `SymmetricFunctions` should not have had a
`__cmp__` method because it already inherits one from `UniqueRepresentation`.
(Tested!) On the other hand, there is no reason for the test as previously written
to be deterministic. So this is the correct approach.

I also found that the tests that are currently in llt.py will fail if they are run separately.

```
sage: HSp3 = SymmetricFunctions(FractionField(QQ['t'])).llt(3).hspin()
sage: TestSuite(HSp3).run(skip = ["_test_associativity", "_test_distributivity", "_test_prod"])
sage: HS3t2 = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).llt(3,t=2).hspin()
sage: TestSuite(HS3t2).run(skip = ["_test_associativity", "_test_distributivity", "_test_prod"])
```

Executes without errors (even without the 'skip's).  However, if you delete the first two lines then these tests fail.  I will fix this by putting these tests in their own block.

The failures are related to failures that already existed before this patch.
On sage 5.0.1 (plain) one obtains

The error message is: ('EOF in multi-line statement', (1760, 0))

Mike's patch fixes a bug that is actually in the current version of Sage (as I outlined above). Wouldn't it be better to merge the two extra patches into sage-5.3 instead? Quite a lot of other patches depend on this patch (plus an upcoming book).

Now, this just means that we will have to everyone using a 5.3 beta to switch to 5.3 final; not a big deal.\n\nAnne, Mike: are there specific deadlines (e.g. the book or meetings) for which waiting for 5.4 could be a bother?\n\nOther than that, it's quite a big patch, on a very central feature for people in algebraic combinatorics; and the authors (Mike and Anne mostly) did put quite a lot of work and energy into it.

<a id='comment:81'>**Comment 81:**</a>
Ah shoot, my comment did not get through yesterday; well, it's a bit outaded, but here it is anyway ...

Replying to [@jdemeyer](#comment%3A78):
> Replying to [@anneschilling](#comment%3A76):
> > Will it be merged again in a different version of sage?

> Yes, I don't want to merge any more new patches in sage-5.3 so it will be removed from sage-5.3 and then merged again in sage-5.4 such that it can be tested better.  Does this cause trouble?

Technically, the Sage-Combinat queue can't handle patches that are merged and then unmerged. Now, this just means that we will have to everyone using a 5.3 beta to switch to 5.3 final; not a big deal.

Anne, Mike: are there specific deadlines (e.g. the book or meetings) for which waiting for 5.4 could be a bother?

Other than that, it's quite a big patch, on a very central feature for people in algebraic combinatorics; and the authors (Mike and Anne mostly) did put quite a lot of work and energy into it. So it will be quite frustrating for theim to not be able to cross it out of their TODO list while the semester starts. But that's life ...

Cheers,
                              Nicolas

Hi Nicolas,

> Technically, the Sage-Combinat queue can't handle patches that are merged and then unmerged. Now, this just means that we will have to everyone using a 5.3 beta to switch to 5.3 final; not a big deal.

I have no idea how to handle the sage-combinat queue now. Do nothing until sage-5.3 comes out and then force everyone to move to sage-5.3?

> Anne, Mike: are there specific deadlines (e.g. the book or meetings) for which waiting for 5.4 could be a bother?

Beginning for the quarter for the book since my students are supposed to use it and sage!

Anne

This patch abuses `assert` and `AssertionError`. `assert` should not be used for control flow. An `assert` checks something which should always be true, a failed assertion is always a bug in the program.

For example:

```
            sage: f.skew_by([1])
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
            AssertionError: x needs to be a symmetric function
```
This is a simple user mistake, for which `assert` is not right.

I think this must be fixed.

Given the discussion on sage-devel, do we agree that there is no control flow involved and it's a not so common function, so it's ok to use assert?

Cheers,
                    Nicolas

We had a user who used this method wrongly at FPSAC (he used a partition instead of a symmetric function). That's why we added this (since this can potentially be a common user mistake). If this should be done differently, feel free to change it!

Yes, it should be done differently.  The correct way would be:

```
if not needed_condition:
    raise ValueError("Error message")
```

Short story: for me it was far more important **that** the problem got
fixed, not **how** it got fixed.

A situation where a ticket is merged but then problems are discovered is
a difficult situation to handle.  In the past, I would have re-opened
the ticket and set it to needs_work but that seems to upset people (they
think it will postpone the merging of their patch).  So this time, I
decided not to reopen the ticket but my intention was indeed for the
chances to be made on the same ticket.  However, ideally it would have
been done in a separate additional patch, leaving the original
already-merged patch alone.  But I certainly would have been happy also
with a new ticket.

I have no idea how any of this affect sage-combinat.
