This patch restructures the implementation of symmetric functions in sage

The new implementation makes use of multiple realizations and the category framework. The new access to symmetric functions is via

```
sage: Sym = SymmetricFunctions(QQ)
```
Further new features that are implemented:

* The ring of symmetric functions is now endowed with a Hopf algebra structure. The coproduct and antipode are implemented (which were missing before).

* A tutorial on how to use symmetric functions in sage is included at the beginning of sf.py which is also accessible via

```
sage: SymmetricFunctions??
```

* Symmetric functions should now work a lot better with respect to  specializing parameters like `q` and `t` for Hall-Littlewood, Jack and Macdonald symmetric functions. Certain functionalities before this change were broken or not possible.

* Documentation was added to LLT polynomials (which had very sparse documentation previously).

* The `k`-bounded subspace of the ring of symmetric function was implemented. The `k`-Schur functions now live in the `k`-bounded subspace rather than in the ring of symmetric functions as before.

This patch gained tremendously by the tutorial on symmetric functions written by Jason Bandlow, a draft on the `k`-bounded subspace by Jason Bandlow, and code multiple realizations written by Franco Saliola.

<a id='comment:10'></a>Hi Mike,

I finished the doctests for the following files:

- schur.py

- homogeneous.py

- elementrary.py

- powersum.py

- monomial.py

- classical.py

- dual.py

- multiplicative.py

- orthotriang.py

- sf.py

In particular, at the beginning of sf.py I incorporated the tutorial that Jason and Nicolas
wrote (which was further down the queue) and updated it. I marked them there as coauthors in
that file.

This leaves the doctests for 

- hall_littlewood.py

- jack.py

- llt.py

- macdonald.py

- ns_macdonald.py

- sfa.py

which I suppose you will do in the next couple of days?
In particular, in the sfa.py the deprecation warnings need to be activated which I have
not yet done.

Best,

Anne

<a id='comment:38'></a>Dear Dan and Nicolas,

Thank you so much for your reviews and work on this patch! I incorporated the changes that Dan suggested by e-mail and folded Nicolas' review patch. In addition, Mike had some minor improvements in the documentation of llt.py which are incorporated.

The new patch should apply cleanly on sage-5.3.beta0.

Anne

This adds a __cmp__ method for SymmetricFunctions, which was missing, and that
was uncovered by the test in llt.py. Two SymmetricFunctions instances are
compared equal if and only if they have the same base ring, which is as it
should be.

Unless I'm missing something the patch is obviously correct. I ran --testall --long
in the sf directory and all tests passed.

<a id='comment:50'></a>There is no compelling reason to have a cmp function for symmetric functions (nor its bases). The order has no meaning, and equality testing should be taken care of by UniqueRepresentation.

So altogether, I'd rather not add a cmp function, and instead would rather replace the failing test by:

    sage: cmp(L3Q, L3Z) != 0

which is platform independent, and is all we care about. We could even just discard this test.

Now, I don't want to slow down the integration of this patch, so I am happy leaving this issue for a latter ticket, at the author's choice.

<a id='comment:54'></a>Nicolas argued that there is no real reason for Sym to have a `__cmp__`
method and there is no reason for the test to be deterministic. We don't

is not needed.

This patch removes the `__cmp__` method from llt polynomials instead
of adding one for sf. In fact, `SymmetricFunctions` should not have had a
`__cmp__` method because it already inherits one from `UniqueRepresentation`.
(Tested!) On the other hand, there is no reason for the test as previously written
to be deterministic. So this is the correct approach.

The failures are related to failures that already existed before this patch.
On sage 5.0.1 (plain) one obtains

Jeroen, I have a question. trac_5457-symmetric_functions-mz.patch was already merged into sage-5.2.beta2. Why did you rebase that patch again? Will it be merged again in a different version of sage? I am asking since in the sage-combinat queue it is currently guarded by sage-5.3.beta2.

I believe everything you say in this paragraph, but I see no arguments to merge it in sage-5.3.

You have to convince me that this patch will absolutely not break anything on any system, nor cause doctest timeouts.

Anne, Mike: are there specific deadlines (e.g. the book or meetings) for which waiting for 5.4 could be a bother?

Other than that, it's quite a big patch, on a very central feature for people in algebraic combinatorics; and the authors (Mike and Anne mostly) did put quite a lot of work and energy into it. So it will be quite frustrating for theim to not be able to cross it out of their TODO list while the semester starts. But that's life ...

I have no idea how to handle the sage-combinat queue now. Do nothing until sage-5.3 comes out and then force everyone to move to sage-5.3?

Beginning for the quarter for the book since my students are supposed to use it and sage!

<a id='comment:97'></a>This patch abuses `assert` and `AssertionError`. `assert` should not be used for control flow. An `assert` checks something which should always be true, a failed assertion is always a bug in the program.

For example:

```
            sage: f.skew_by([1])
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
            AssertionError: x needs to be a symmetric function
```
This is a simple user mistake, for which `assert` is not right.

I think this must be fixed.

Given the discussion on sage-devel, do we agree that there is no control flow involved and it's a not so common function, so it's ok to use assert?

Cheers,

We had a user who used this method wrongly at FPSAC (he used a partition instead of a symmetric function). That's why we added this (since this can potentially be a common user mistake). If this should be done differently, feel free to change it!

Yes, it should be done differently.  The correct way would be:

```
if not needed_condition:
    raise ValueError("Error message")
```

As I said: `assert` is only meant to catch *bugs*, not user errors.  Although, as Nicolas Thi√©ry argued, something `assert` is acceptible.  See also the sage-devel thread.

<a id='comment:4'></a>Short story: for me it was far more important **that** the problem got
fixed, not **how** it got fixed.

A situation where a ticket is merged but then problems are discovered is
a difficult situation to handle.  In the past, I would have re-opened
the ticket and set it to needs_work but that seems to upset people (they
think it will postpone the merging of their patch).  So this time, I
decided not to reopen the ticket but my intention was indeed for the
chances to be made on the same ticket.  However, ideally it would have
been done in a separate additional patch, leaving the original
already-merged patch alone.  But I certainly would have been happy also
with a new ticket.

I have no idea how any of this affect sage-combinat.
