As discussed on sage-devel here: http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/b1a03f8fc8ae8fcd/553773d7ba600ae7#553773d7ba600ae7

I added deprecation warnings to the four affected `__call__` functions (two for symbolic values, one for equations, one for matrices), and fixed almost all the warnings in all the doctests other than the doctests specifically for those `__call__` methods.

There's one set of warnings that I didn't figure out how to fix (in piecewise.py), so I just added the warning to the expected output for now.

Thanks for working on this Carl.

I only read the patch, didn't test it yet. Explicitly having to use .function() in two places bothers me:

* for each component of Piecewise
* in the call to generate_plot_points

Perhaps we should modify these to handle non function arguments more gracefully after this change. 

I understand that this might require a new syntax to construct Piecewise objects. One option is to add a new parameter, which includes an ordered list of variables. E.g.,

```
    sage: Piecewise([[(0,1),x^2],[(1,2),5-x^2]] ,[x])
```
or

```
    sage: f = Piecewise([[(-1,1),1/2+x-x^3 + y]],[x,y])
```

Comments?

I've posted a patch that implements the more extensive deprecation described here: http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/97cdf80edb089481#

The patch now depends on #5093.

Apply only the second patch.

There is one tiny doctest issue left - at least in my merge tree :)

```
sage -t -long "devel/sage/doc/en/constructions/calculus.rst"
**********************************************************************
File "/scratch/mabshoff/sage-3.4.1.alpha0/devel/sage/doc/en/constructions/calculus.rst", line 222:
    sage: f.integral()
Expected:
    Piecewise defined function with 2 parts, [[(0, 1), x^3/3], [(1, 2), (15*x - x^3)/3 - 13/3]]
Got:
    Piecewise defined function with 2 parts, [[(0, 1), x |--> x^3/3], [(1, 2), x |--> (15*x - x^3)/3 - 13/3]]
**********************************************************************
1 items had failures:

***Test Failed*** 1 failures.
For whitespace errors, see the file /scratch/mabshoff/sage-3.4.1.alpha0/tmp/.doctest_calculus.py

I am fixing this with a reviewer patch.

Cheers,
