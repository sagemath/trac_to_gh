As discussed on sage-devel here: http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/b1a03f8fc8ae8fcd/553773d7ba600ae7#553773d7ba600ae7

I added deprecation warnings to the four affected __call__ functions (two for symbolic values, one for equations, one for matrices), and fixed almost all the warnings in all the doctests other than the doctests specifically for those __call__ methods.

There's one set of warnings that I didn't figure out how to fix (in piecewise.py), so I just added the warning to the expected output for now.

<a id='comment:6'></a>Thanks for working on this Carl.

I only read the patch, didn't test it yet. Explicitly having to use .function() in two places bothers me:

* for each component of Piecewise
* in the call to generate_plot_points

Perhaps we should modify these to handle non function arguments more gracefully after this change. 

I understand that this might require a new syntax to construct Piecewise objects. One option is to add a new parameter, which includes an ordered list of variables. E.g.,

```
    sage: Piecewise([[(0,1),x^2],[(1,2),5-x^2]] ,[x])
```
or

```
    sage: f = Piecewise([[(-1,1),1/2+x-x^3 + y]],[x,y])
```

Comments?

I've posted a patch that implements the more extensive deprecation described here: http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/97cdf80edb089481#

The patch now depends on #5093.

Apply only the second patch.
