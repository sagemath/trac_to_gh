As discussed on sage-devel here: http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/b1a03f8fc8ae8fcd/553773d7ba600ae7#553773d7ba600ae7

I added deprecation warnings to the four affected `__call__` functions (two for symbolic values, one for equations, one for matrices), and fixed almost all the warnings in all the doctests other than the doctests specifically for those `__call__` methods.

There's one set of warnings that I didn't figure out how to fix (in piecewise.py), so I just added the warning to the expected output for now.

Thanks for working on this Carl.

I only read the patch, didn't test it yet. Explicitly having to use .function() in two places bothers me:

* for each component of Piecewise
* in the call to generate_plot_points

Perhaps we should modify these to handle non function arguments more gracefully after this change. 

I understand that this might require a new syntax to construct Piecewise objects. One option is to add a new parameter, which includes an ordered list of variables. E.g.,

```
    sage: Piecewise([[(0,1),x^2],[(1,2),5-x^2]] ,[x])
```
or

```
    sage: f = Piecewise([[(-1,1),1/2+x-x^3 + y]],[x,y])
```

Comments?

I've posted a patch that implements the more extensive deprecation described here: http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/97cdf80edb089481#

The patch now depends on #5093.

Apply only the second patch.

Jason, I get the same behavior without Carl's patch on Sage-3.4. I suggest moving that to a separate ticket. We could also argue if that is valid syntax there.

I give a positive review to this. It would be good to get this in an alpha and let more people play with it. Thanks again Carl.

Cheers,
Burcin

There is one tiny doctest issue left - at least in my merge tree :)
