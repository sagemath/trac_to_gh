The attached patch adds a lot of documentation to the bitsets in misc/bitset.*.  It also fixes a bug or two dealing with entries that are past the size of the set, but still within the last limb.

The other major contribution of the patch is to make the bitset interface consistent with the python set interface.  This is to make it very easy to transition from code that is written using python sets to changing it to use this bitset class.  Another advantage to changing the interface is that the language is more set-theoretic instead of demanding the user to understand the implementation details.

That said, the only big incompatible change in the interface is to make `bitset_clear` empty the set, rather than deallocate the set.  This is because the python set clear() function just empties a set.  To deallocate a bitset, use the `bitset_free` function after this patch.

I grepped through the sage library and changed the uses of bitset to use the more pythonic interface.

After this patch, doctests in misc/misc_c.pyx, groups/perm_gps/partn_ref/*.pyx, and coding/binary_code.pyx all pass (those were the places I found using bitsets).

Mhh, two issues:

* None of the old functions get deprecated. While this probably isn't too popular an interface I am still not too happy about this.
* Did anyone valgrind this? While it seems like straightforward search and replace I am still not too comfortable merging this patch this late in the merge process.

So: bounced to 3.4.2 for now.

3.4.2 is fine, we need to get 3.4.1 out (I'm getting ready to assemble the release notes for Cython right now :). No, I didn't valgrind it. 

The old functions are still there in the "Aliases for functions" section. (I don't think any got removed...) Actually, I would be happier if the aliases were placed right next to the implementations, rather than elsewhere.

Whoa, why on Earth would we want to deprecate easy notation for hard?

bitset_not -> bitset_complement
bitset_and -> bitset_intersection
bitset_or -> bitset_union
bitset_xor -> bitset_symmetric_difference

All of these are much longer to type, and I don't see why any are better. I also don't think that making things more like Python is a good reason to deprecate what was originally there.

As one of bitset's main consumers, I must say I really dislike having to type "symmetric_difference" when all I want is an "xor". I vote against deprecation.

Okay, either Robert, I think the .3.patch file is a good final version.  Can you look at it one more time?  I drastically cut down on the number of changes to existing code, just doing the necessary bitset_clear to bitset_free transition talked about above.

All tests pass in groups/perm_gps/partn_ref/*.pyx, coding/binary_code.pyx, and misc/*.pyx

You can delete all patches prior to the .3.patch.

Furthermore, after the patch:

```
sage: search_src('bitset_clear')
misc/misc_c.pyx:    bitset_clear(r)
misc/misc_c.pyx:        bitset_clear(r)
misc/misc_c.pyx:        bitset_clear(r)
misc/misc_c.pyx:        bitset_clear(r)
misc/misc_c.pyx:        bitset_clear(r)
misc/bitset.pxi:cdef inline void bitset_clear(bitset_t bits):
misc/bitset.pxi:    This function is the same as bitset_clear(bits).
misc/bitset.pxi:    bitset_clear(bits)
misc/bitset.pxi:        bitset_clear(r)
misc/bitset.pxi:        bitset_clear(r)
```

So I took care of all bitset_clear functions in existing code (the ones above in the misc/ directory use the new bitset_clear).

Because this was such a massive revision of the original patch, I'm calling for review again.

Robert and Robert,

When using this code this weekend, I found a bug in bitset_pop (it forgot to actually discard an element!).  I also implemented a bitset_len function, which corresponds to len(python set) and gives the number of things in the set.

Could you glance at the trac-5796-bitset-bugfix-len-function.patch and, if you like it, again put this patch as positive review?
