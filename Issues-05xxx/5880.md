With the attached patch, you get snapshots when you click the save button, and that's about it (I hope). 

This patch simply deletes a bunch of calls to save_snapshot that were all over the place.   You'll still get snapshots, but not every time you blink.

Bash scripts to properly clean up redundant snapshots in the notebook produced by sage 3.4 and earlier.  This script removes every snapshot which is identical to a previous snapshot, giving statistics at the end. As of sage 3.4.1, redundant snapshots are no longer produced.

<a id='comment:3'></a>This patch removes several unnecessary occurrences of `save_snapshot()` in the notebook.  The most significant is that autosave is disabled by inserting a `return`, so an explicit save is required.

As written the patch breaks several doctests.  It seems that in testing, new worksheets are created, but there is no save done under the change in the patch to the `__init__` method for a worksheet.  For example in the doctest for `__getstate___` the `_Worksheet__saved_by_info` key is not present post-patch, causing the doctest to fail.   One fix is to make an explicit call to `save_snapshot()` after each new creation of a test worksheet in a doctest.  Or, in the reviewer patch, I have just restored the `save_snapshot()` call to the `__init__` method for a worksheet since it (a) seems like not such a bad idea, and (b) isn't really a big contributor to the problem of excessive snapshots.

The change to `SendWorksheetToStop` in `twist.py` eliminates a save as part of the "stop" so the docstring needs an adjustment.  That minor change is in the reviewer patch as well.

This is a positive review, subject to fixing doctests, either with approval of the reviewer patch, or by further changes to problematic docstrings.

Well, I applied your patch, which I like, and ran "make ptestlong" and it passes.  So positive review. 

Regarding credit, if anybody notices this, rbeezer should also get credit for this patch.
