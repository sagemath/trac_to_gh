```
1. The adjacency matrix of a graph constructed from an adjacency matrix should either be the same or one should get an error when constructing the graph:

```
sage: a = matrix(2,2,[1,0,0,1])
sage: Graph(a)
Graph on 2 vertices
sage: Graph(a).adjacency_matrix()  # I think Graph(a) should work or given an error
[0 0]
[0 0]
sage: Graph(a, loops=True).adjacency_matrix()
[1 0]
[0 1]
```

Another example -- this is WRONG, since multiple loops should not be ignored.

```
sage: a = matrix(2,2,[2,0,0,1])
sage: Graph(a,loops=True).adjacency_matrix()
[1 0]
[0 1]
```

Why not just make a graph with loops and multiple edges (or at least weighted edges) if and only if the adjacency matrix has diagonal entries or non-1 entries?  I'm guessing the Graph constructor just grew from a time when these constructions weren't allowed or that networkx is just poorly designed.  Either way, this needs to be fixed for Sage. 

2. When the input matrix is non-square, the error message is wrong in multiple ways:

```
sage: a = matrix([1,0,0,1])
sage: Graph(a)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: Incidence Matrix must have one 1 and one -1 per column.
```

* it should be "adjacency matrix". 

* The exception should be ValueError, not AttributeError

* The Graph constructor doesn't take only 1's or -1's as input (but see above)

* The Graph constructor is perfectly fine with having multiple 1's per column!

I personally would expect a function named "multiple_edges" to return a list of all multiple edges, which no variant of the current function does!

Otherwise I'm good with this patch.
