```
1. The adjacency matrix of a graph constructed from an adjacency matrix should either be the same or one should get an error when constructing the graph:

```
sage: a = matrix(2,2,[1,0,0,1])
sage: Graph(a)
Graph on 2 vertices
sage: Graph(a).adjacency_matrix()  # I think Graph(a) should work or given an error
[0 0]
[0 0]
sage: Graph(a, loops=True).adjacency_matrix()
[1 0]
[0 1]
```

Another example -- this is WRONG, since multiple loops should not be ignored.

```
sage: a = matrix(2,2,[2,0,0,1])
sage: Graph(a,loops=True).adjacency_matrix()
[1 0]
[0 1]
```

Why not just make a graph with loops and multiple edges (or at least weighted edges) if and only if the adjacency matrix has diagonal entries or non-1 entries?  I'm guessing the Graph constructor just grew from a time when these constructions weren't allowed or that networkx is just poorly designed.  Either way, this needs to be fixed for Sage. 

2. When the input matrix is non-square, the error message is wrong in multiple ways:

```
sage: a = matrix([1,0,0,1])
sage: Graph(a)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: Incidence Matrix must have one 1 and one -1 per column.
```

* it should be "adjacency matrix". 

* The exception should be ValueError, not AttributeError

* The Graph constructor doesn't take only 1's or -1's as input (but see above)

* The Graph constructor is perfectly fine with having multiple 1's per column!

William: when the matrix is non-square, we are assuming it is an incidence matrix; the error message is perfect.  See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_matrix.

However, it's not the first time that I've been frustrated with the behavior completely being different when a small change in input happens.  In fact, I remember complaining about the adjacency matrix/incidence matrix assumptions a long time ago.  I think it was part of one of my grand re-architecting schemes, though, so it got abandoned eventually :).

REPORT:

* All doctests pass in the graphs directory

* old doctests don't fail in too disturbing a way

* I definitely do not like at all the new multiple_edges function.  It should be split into two functions: has_multiple_edges() and allows_multiple_edges() and the current multiple_edges should be deprecated.  I personally would expect a function named "multiple_edges" to return a list of all multiple edges, which no variant of the current function does!  Having a check parameter that determines the functionality is particularly bad, given that check is used elsewhere all over in sage in a way that never changes the meaning of the output (it is always for speed).

 
Otherwise I'm good with this patch.

This latest patch requires one trivial doctest fix:

```
sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/groups/perm_gps/partn_ref/refinement_graphs.pyx
**********************************************************************
File "/scratch/mabshoff/sage-3.3.rc2/devel/sage-main/sage/groups/perm_gps/partn_ref/refinement_graphs.pyx", line 808:
    sage: sage.groups.perm_gps.partn_ref.refinement_graphs.random_tests()
Expected:
    All passed: ... random tests on ... graphs.
Got:
    doctest:1: DeprecationWarning: The function loops is replaced by allow_loops and allows_loops.
    All passed: 560 random tests on 28 graphs.
**********************************************************************
```
I am posting a reviewer patch shortly.

Cheers,
