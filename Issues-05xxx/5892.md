When Sage gives a warning about SIMD instructions way too many *experts* just delete the file as indicated and then complain about Sage blowing up. Don't give them the chance to do something stupid any more by removing the work around instructions.

The right fix is to (1) remove this SIMD stuff (already done), and (2) make a SAGE_FAT_BINARY option that actually *works*.  So far, absolutely nothing at all that has been done toward this problem has worked in the list bit.  I'm closing this ticket as invalid.
