This problem is ironically introduced by having database_cremona_ellcurve-20071019.spkg installed :)

I agree, and suggest

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve([1, -1, 0, -79, 289]) 
sage: E.cremona_label()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
RuntimeError                              Traceback (most recent call last)

/home/john/.sage/temp/ubuntu/1126/_home_john__sage_init_sage_0.py in <module>()

/home/john/sage-3.4/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_rational_field.pyc in cremona_label(self, space)
   3034                 X = self.database_curve()
   3035             except RuntimeError:
-> 3036                 raise RuntimeError, "Cremona label not known for %s."%self
   3037             self.__cremona_label = X.__cremona_label
   3038             return self.cremona_label(space)

RuntimeError: Cremona label not known for Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 + x*y = x^3 - x^2 - 79*x + 289 over Rational Field.
```
as that curve will one day have label 234446a1 (or b1 or c1, I forget).

**Attachment:** [trac_5346.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket5346/trac_5346.patch.gz)

The patch cahnges taht example to the one with condictor 234446 as I suggested.

It also make another doctest work ok with & without the database (at line 4941) by hard-wiring in some points instead of getting the gens.

I tested this on sage-3.4.1 with & without the database installed.
