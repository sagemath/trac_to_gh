This was originally reported on ticket #5076 but seems to be a separate issue.

```
sage: K = Qp(11,8)
sage: a = 11^-2 + O(11^5)
sage: a
11^-2 + O(11^3)
```
By contrast:

```
sage: K = Qp(11,8)
sage: 11^(-2) + K(O(11^5))
11^-2 + O(11^5)
```
Note that

```
sage: O(11^5).parent()
11-adic Ring with capped relative precision 5
sage: O(11^5).parent() == K
False
```

The explanation looks good, I'm not sure how one would get around this without doing something lazily. Also, +1 to only allowing `O(x^n)` not `O((x+1)^n)`

However, what's up with the change of comparison direction in the last three files of the patch? Is this fixing an separate bug?

The last seems to get very slow, i.e. only the last step in the following computation

```
Trying:
    E = EllipticCurve('37a')###line 585:_sage_    >>> E = EllipticCurve('37a')
Expecting nothing
ok
Trying:
    E.is_supersingular(Integer(3))###line 586:_sage_    >>> E.is_supersingular(3)
Expecting:
    True
ok
Trying:
    h = E.padic_height(Integer(3), Integer(5))###line 588:_sage_    >>> h = E.padic_height(3, 5)
Expecting nothing
ok
Trying:
    h(E.gens()[Integer(0)])###line 589:_sage_    >>> h(E.gens()[0])
Expecting:

```
takes more than 3 minutes CPU time on sage.math.

I fixed the problem with the laurent series ring, which was also causing the doctest failures.

The change in direction of the coercion maps is one that I discussed with Kiran at AWS.  I think it's a good idea, though it is a somewhat different issue.
