This was originally reported on ticket #5076 but seems to be a separate issue.

```
sage: K = Qp(11,8)
sage: a = 11^-2 + O(11^5)
sage: a
11^-2 + O(11^3)
```
By contrast:

```
sage: K = Qp(11,8)
sage: 11^(-2) + K(O(11^5))
11^-2 + O(11^5)
```
Note that

```
sage: O(11^5).parent()
11-adic Ring with capped relative precision 5
sage: O(11^5).parent() == K
False
```


Component: **number theory**

I fixed the problem with the laurent series ring, which was also causing the doctest failures.

The change in direction of the coercion maps is one that I discussed with Kiran at AWS.  I think it's a good idea, though it is a somewhat different issue.
