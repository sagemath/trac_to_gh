This was originally reported on ticket #5076 but seems to be a separate issue.

```
sage: K = Qp(11,8)
sage: a = 11^-2 + O(11^5)
sage: a
11^-2 + O(11^3)
```
By contrast:

```
sage: K = Qp(11,8)
sage: 11^(-2) + K(O(11^5))
11^-2 + O(11^5)
```
Note that

```
sage: O(11^5).parent()
11-adic Ring with capped relative precision 5
sage: O(11^5).parent() == K
False
```

The explanation looks good, I'm not sure how one would get around this without doing something lazily. Also, +1 to only allowing `O(x^n)` not `O((x+1)^n)`

However, what's up with the change of comparison direction in the last three files of the patch? Is this fixing an separate bug?

This patch causes many doctest failures:

```
	sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/padic_lseries.py # 1 doctests failed

The last seems to get very slow, i.e. only the last step in the following computation

```
Trying:
    E = EllipticCurve('37a')###line 585:_sage_    >>> E = EllipticCurve('37a')
Expecting nothing
ok
Trying:
    E.is_supersingular(Integer(3))###line 586:_sage_    >>> E.is_supersingular(3)
Expecting:
    True
ok
Trying:
    h = E.padic_height(Integer(3), Integer(5))###line 588:_sage_    >>> h = E.padic_height(3, 5)

ok
Trying:

takes more than 3 minutes CPU time on sage.math.

To clarify my previous comment: before the patch, we have correctly:

```
sage: R.<q> = LaurentSeriesRing(Rationals())
sage: O(q^14)
O(q^14)
```
but afterwards we have:

sage: R.<q> = LaurentSeriesRing(Rationals())
sage: O(q^14)
q^14

I fixed the problem with the laurent series ring, which was also causing the doctest failures.

The change in direction of the coercion maps is one that I discussed with Kiran at AWS.  I think it's a good idea, though it is a somewhat different issue.
