This was originally reported on ticket #5076 but seems to be a separate issue.

```
sage: K = Qp(11,8)
sage: a = 11^-2 + O(11^5)
sage: a
11^-2 + O(11^3)
```
By contrast:

```
sage: K = Qp(11,8)
sage: 11^(-2) + K(O(11^5))
11^-2 + O(11^5)
```
Note that

```
sage: O(11^5).parent()
11-adic Ring with capped relative precision 5
sage: O(11^5).parent() == K
False
```

The explanation looks good, I'm not sure how one would get around this without doing something lazily. Also, +1 to only allowing `O(x^n)` not `O((x+1)^n)`

However, what's up with the change of comparison direction in the last three files of the patch? Is this fixing an separate bug?

To clarify my previous comment: before the patch, we have correctly:

```
sage: R.<q> = LaurentSeriesRing(Rationals())
sage: O(q^14)
O(q^14)

q^14

I fixed the problem with the laurent series ring, which was also causing the doctest failures.

The change in direction of the coercion maps is one that I discussed with Kiran at AWS.  I think it's a good idea, though it is a somewhat different issue.
