Previous title: Create a class for SetPartition (with no s)

The Elements of `SetPartitions` of a set A are actually Sets of Sets. But there are specific functionalities I would like for those "Sets of Sets". For example : merge the classes of a an b and ask what is the representant of a, where a, b are in A.

Right now, Arnaud Bergeron and I coded and named it as `DisjointSet` and it is available in the sage-combinat tree. The implementation is inspired from :

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint_set_data_structure

Since this has already been done in #6775, I've recycled this ticket to improve the documentation for `DisjointSet`.

Helloooooooooo !!

Several remarks :
* Could you update the ticket's title and description ?
* Why did you move the description of the data structure from the module to the function ? `:-/` I prefer when it is at the top of the html documentation, and here you have no idea of what is happening in that module... Plus there is a function and three classes in that module, so something should be said at the module level `:-/`
* I know it's not the point of this ticket but what would you think of changing `cardinality()` so that it actually returns the cardinality of the partition, and not the cardinality of its union ? And have another method named "`number_of_elements`" which would return what `cardinality` currently returns ? Would make more sense, wouldn't it ? It does not have to be in this ticket, though.

Nice patch though ! Always good to improve the doc `:-)`

Done

The main reason is for viewing the interactive doc using `DisjoinSet?` since getting the module level doc interactively is unintuitive IMO. I have I've added somethings to the module level directing you to the function for more info.

> * I know it's not the point of this ticket but what would you think of changing `cardinality()` so that it actually returns the cardinality of the partition, and not the cardinality of its union ? And have another method named "`number_of_elements`" which would return what `cardinality` currently returns ? Would make more sense, wouldn't it ? It does not have to be in this ticket, though.


Part of me says yes, part no. However because this is how it's been, I don't want to make any changes. If you feel strongly about it, you can make the change on another ticket.

Thanks Travis for closing this ticket and Nathann for the review.

Having doc in the top of the module (for web doc browsing) vs in the the class (for ?  interactive doc browsing) is a good question. One answer could be to copy the same information in both place... At least now, there is a link at the top of the module linking to the class...

Yup.

Nah, don't duplicate. Better one good piece of documentation than two
things that will diverge.

I aim to put class-specific documentation in the class (so that it can
be accessed by introspection on the class; that's often how the user
will get to that). And when there is more than one class, to put an
overview/tutorial in the module. With cross links.
