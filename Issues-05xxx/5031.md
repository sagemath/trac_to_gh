Also move some function from matrix/misc.pyx to where they belong. 
misc.pyx exists only because of bugs in the *old* Cython that messed up circular imports.  Now circular imports work so that's no longer a problem.   This ticket gets doctest coverage and does part of getting rid of misc.pyx.  More will come in a later ticket.

Some timings

```
BEFORE:
sage: a = random_matrix(GF(19),500)
sage: time b = a.lift()
CPU times: user 0.93 s, sys: 0.02 s, total: 0.95 s
Wall time: 0.96 s
sage: a = random_matrix(GF(19),200,sparse=True)
sage: time b = a.lift()
CPU times: user 0.81 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 0.82 s
Wall time: 0.82 s

AFTER:
sage: a = random_matrix(GF(19),500)
sage: time b = a.lift()
CPU times: user 0.02 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 0.04 s
Wall time: 0.04 s
