Also move some function from matrix/misc.pyx to where they belong. 
misc.pyx exists only because of bugs in the *old* Cython that messed up circular imports.  Now circular imports work so that's no longer a problem.   This ticket gets doctest coverage and does part of getting rid of misc.pyx.  More will come in a later ticket.

**Attachment:** [trac_5031.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket5031/trac_5031.patch)

I get even larger speedups (factor of 21 to 23), the doctest coverage for all 5 touched files is increased, and the code is fine. Positive review.
