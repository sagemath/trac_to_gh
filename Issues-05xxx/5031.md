Also move some function from matrix/misc.pyx to where they belong. 
misc.pyx exists only because of bugs in the *old* Cython that messed up circular imports.  Now circular imports work so that's no longer a problem.   This ticket gets doctest coverage and does part of getting rid of misc.pyx.  More will come in a later ticket.
