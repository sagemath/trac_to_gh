Examine the output of 

```
var('x,y')
contour_plot(x-y^2,(x,-5,5),(y,-3,3),contours=[-4,0,1], fill=False)
```


The last contour line (level curve at z=1) is invisible because the default cmap makes it white.  Compare that to a different color map:

```
var('x,y')
contour_plot(x-y^2,(x,-5,5),(y,-3,3),contours=[-4,0,1],cmap='winter',fill=False)
```

We should make the default cmap something less confusing when fill=False.

As it turns out, no cmap with any better visibility is any better - many of them have white as one of the options.  So this patch creates a custom cmap which is almost the same as 'gray' for the situation where fill is False, a cmap is not specified, but there are a specific number of contours (or exact contours) specified.

Note this patch depends on the patch at #5145.

Thanks for the patch!

I think this patch needs to be rebased after #5448.  The `@`options decorator for contour_plot is changed in that patch.
