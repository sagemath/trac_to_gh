Coverage of some files in algebras:

```
algebra_ideal.py: 0% (0 of 19)
algebra_ideal_element.py: 0% (0 of 1)
algebra_order.py: 0% (0 of 16)
algebra_order_element.py: 0% (0 of 13)
algebra_order_frac_ideal.py: 0% (0 of 17)
algebra_order_ideal.py: 0% (0 of 21)
algebra_order_ideal_element.py: 0% (0 of 1)
```
Furthermore, these don't seem to be used by any of the rest of the Sage code, so let's delete them.

If anybody wants these to be in Sage, they should revert this patch, then get the coverage to 100% and get everything up to how things work in Sage now (e.g., coercion model, etc.).  Right now they are used nowhere and have no tests.
