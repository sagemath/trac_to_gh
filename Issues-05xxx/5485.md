Consider this:

```
sage: R.<x, y> = ZZ[]
sage: I = R.ideal(0)
sage: I.dimension()
verbose 0 (794: multi_polynomial_ideal.py, dimension) Warning: falling back to very slow toy implementation.
1
```

But judging from the docstring of I.dimension(),this should be the Krull dimension of R/I, which is 3 since R/I is (canonically isomorphic to) R:

```
sage: R.krull_dimension()
3
```

Hi John,

I've learned the hard way not to expect dimension to behave coherently when the base ring is not a field.  This being said, I have just spent some quality time with EGA IV and found something that we can use: Corollary 5.5.4 (page 95 in volume 2 of EGA IV) says that if the ring A is noetherian, then the dimension of A[x_1,...,x_n] is equal to n + dim(A).

There are examples due to Nagata of non-noetherian rings A such that dim(A)=1 but dim(A[x])=3.

So here's what we need to do for polynomial rings: check whether the base ring is noetherian; if not, raise a NotImplementedError.  If yes, return the Krull dimension of the base ring plus the number of generators.

If you want to go ahead and do this, that's great.  If not I can probably get around to it sometime before this weekend.

Hi Alex,

What is EGA IV? If my university's library has it, I'd be glad to take a look at it.

You wrote,

Hold on: `dimension()` is a method of an ideal, not of a ring. I can see that this would work with (0), but will it work with other ideals? i.e., can I assume that if R is Noetherian, then I should add the affine dimension? (I'm not sure that *affine dimension* is the right term, probably not, but I hope you get the idea.)

For example:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = ZZ[]
sage: I = R.ideal(x+y)
sage. I.dimension()
```


Should the answer be 1 (current) or 2 (my wholly uninformed guess, dim ZZ + affine dim of ideal) or something else?

OK, so there are several issues here.

One is that we're not sure that the naive algorithm implemented in dimension() works over base rings that are not fields.  The most interesting instance of this (in my opinion) is when the base ring is ZZ.  We are currently returning wrong answers, so even raising a `NotImplementedError` would be preferable.  Of course, it would be nice if we could get it to work -- but note that Singular 3.1.0 will have support for polynomial rings over ZZ, so in the worst case we can wait until they release.

The more pressing issue is that the naive algorithm returns wrong answers even if you run it over QQ.  To see this, try the following as it is now:

```
sage: R.<x, y> = QQ[]
sage: I = R.ideal(0)
sage: I.dimension()
2
```

This is the correct answer, and it's coming directly from Singular.  However, we can force Sage to use the naive algorithm by inserting `raise TypeError` on line 977 of `multi_polynomial_ideal.py`.  Run `sage -br` and try the same computation again:

```
sage: R.<x, y> = QQ[]
sage: I = R.ideal(0)
sage: I.dimension()
verbose 0 (932: multi_polynomial_ideal.py, dimension) Warning: falling back to very slow toy implementation.
1
```

This is wrong and should be our main priority.  In fact, I think it would be ok to just fix this for this ticket and open enhancement tickets for dimension() over tricky base rings.
