Change 'make' to ${MAKE} - is the recommended way to recursively invoke make to ensure that the subordinate make is the same as the parent make (and also ensures that the two make instances will communicate on things like '-jX').

Explicitly use gmake instead of make on FreeBSD.

<div id="comment:3" align="right">Comment 3</div>

I am confused here.  I already have a .p8 version, dated 2009-01-07.  Now you have created a new .p8 which must be different!

Checking the SPKG.txt in my p8 I see this entry:
### eclib-20080310.p8 (John Cremona, January 6th, 2009)
* Change to debugging output in procs/p2points.cc (not relevant for Sage)
* Change to pdivs() in procs/marith.cc (not relevant for Sage)

I suggest that we syncronise, otherwise I will get even more confused.  For a start, this ticket should have had me in its CC list!  I don't see how I can be expected to be responsible for this spkg if people are changing it without even telling me!

Hence I have changed this back to "needs work".
