With the new version of the documentation, the first lines of some files in the Sage library got broken into two lines, and this messes up the table of contents in the reference manual.  The attached patch fixes the instances of that that I found, as well as a few other little things.

Note that in order to see my changes, I couldn't just do 'sage -docbuild reference html' -- the file index.html wasn't getting rebuilt.  I ended up building the manual from scratch, but maybe there's an easier way...

Looks good to me.

In order to have the docs reflect the changes you made, you just need to rebuild the library with "sage -b", and it should pick up the modules that have changed and do the appropriate rebuilding.

I tried that, but it wasn't rebuilding 'index.html', nor was it updating the titles for the individual pages.  For example, just doing "sage -b" then "sage -docbuild ..." gives me a file sage/doc/output/html/en/reference/sage/coding/sd_codes.html with the line

```
<title>This module implements functions useful for studying binary &mdash; Sage Reference Manual v3.4.alpha0</title>
```
not the modified title `Binary self-dual codes`. It looks like the file "doc/en/reference/sage/coding/sd_codes.rst" isn't getting changed after sage -b, just the autogenerated part of it.
