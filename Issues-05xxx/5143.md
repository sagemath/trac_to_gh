This would be more consistent with calculation cells.

References for developement:

It looks like we might be able to do this with the current key handler attaching an event to the tinymce instance that calls the triggerSave tinyMCE trigger: http://wiki.moxiecode.com/index.php/TinyMCE:Functions#tinyMCE.triggerSave

Also, see the bottom of the following page for a way to get tinyMCE to associate an event with a keypress:
