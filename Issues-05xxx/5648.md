The attached patch implements !__mul!__ for ModularFormElement objects, so one can say

```
sage: M = ModularForms(DirichletGroup(3).0, 5)
sage: f = M.0
sage: f * f
```

and get back a modular form (in this case a weight 5 modular form of level 3 and trivial character).

In order to get this to work, I've made a few small adjustments elsewhere: 

* DirichletGroup objects now have a base_extend method

* a bug when multiplying two characters of the same modulus but different zeta orders is fixed

* Dirichlet characters now always compare as unequal unless they have the same modulus (in particular, == for Dirichlet characters is now transitive, which it previously wasn't)

* ambient spaces of modular forms with character now have a decent base_extend method (previously base_extend would forget the character and return an ambient space of modular forms for Gamma1(N)).

<a id='comment:2'></a>Quick comment: I'm concerned the Sturm bound isn't enough when they are Eisenstein series (it's definitely enough for cusp forms):

```
	889	        m = newparent.sturm_bound() 
 	890	        newqexp = self.qexp(m) * other.qexp(m) 
 	891	         
 	892	        return newparent.base_extend(newqexp.base_ring())(newqexp) 
```
Maybe I'm just being dense at the moment.

You could remedy this by increasing m if a given value doesn't work.   There might (should) be a method on newparent that returns the actual precision needed to determine a q-expansion. 

I am happy with all the API changes you list in the ticket summary, including changing the meaning of equals for Dirichlet characters.
