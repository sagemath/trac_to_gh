The plot method on an object should return either a 2d plot or raise NotImplementedError (or not be defined).  On LatticePolytope's it returns a 3d Tachyon object.

```
sage: p = LatticePolytope(random_matrix(ZZ, 3,6, x=7)).plot()
sage: type(p)
<class 'sage.plot.tachyon.Tachyon'>
```

Attachment [11803.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket5635/11803.patch) by @novoselt created at 2009-03-31 04:26:55

The patch removes plot() method and fixes the documentation. I also changed show() to show3d(), which shows the plot without axes.
