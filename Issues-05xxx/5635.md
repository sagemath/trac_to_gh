The plot method on an object should return either a 2d plot or raise NotImplementedError (or not be defined).  On LatticePolytope's it returns a 3d Tachyon object.

```
sage: p = LatticePolytope(random_matrix(ZZ, 3,6, x=7)).plot()
sage: type(p)
<class 'sage.plot.tachyon.Tachyon'>
```

**Attachment:** [11803.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket5635/11803.patch.gz)

The patch removes plot() method and fixes the documentation. I also changed show() to show3d(), which shows the plot without axes.
