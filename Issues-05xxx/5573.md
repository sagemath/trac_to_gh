The code:

```
sage: genus2reduction(x^3 + x^2 + x,-2*x^5 + 3*x^4 - x^3 - x^2 - 6*x - 2)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
ValueError                                
Traceback (most recent call last)
```
William replies:  You have found a bug in Sage.    When I try the above by directly using Liu's program (note that i have to remove the spaces in the polynomials and use an explanation point to run the program), I get the following problem:

```
sage: !genus2reduction
enter Q(x) : x^3+x^2+x        
enter P(x) : -2*x^5+3*x^4-x^3-x^2-6*x-2
 
factorization CPU time = 5
a minimal equation over Z[1/2] is : 
y^2 = x^6+18*x^3+36*x^2-27
 
factorization of the minimal (away from 2) discriminant : 
[2,1;3,15;53,1]
 
p=2
(potential) stable reduction :  (II), j=1
reduction at p : [I{1-0-0}] page 170, (1), f=1
p=3
(potential) stable reduction :  (I)
reduction at p :   ***   expected character: ',' instead of: mod(y,y^2-3)
```
I don't know if this ever worked, but I bet it did, and PARI changed from 2004 or whatever, until now, and we just didn't pick up the change because we didn't test genus2reduction enough.  

2. A second problem is that if genus2reduction works once, then fails, then it fails to work again:

```
sage: R = genus2reduction(x^3 - 2*x^2 - 2*x + 1, -5*x^5)
sage: R.conductor
1416875
sage: R = genus2reduction(x^3 + x^2 + x,-2*x^5 + 3*x^4 - x^3 - x^2 - 6*x - 2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
ValueError: error in input; possibly singular curve? 
(Q=x^3 + x^2 + x, P=-2*x^5 + 3*x^4 - x^3 - x^2 - 6*x - 2)
sage: R = genus2reduction(x^3 - 2*x^2 - 2*x + 1, -5*x^5)  # just worked above
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: error in input; possibly singular curve? 
(Q=x^3 - 2*x^2 - 2*x + 1, P=-5*x^5)
```

When we fix this, we will of course have to write code to run through random curves and verify that genus2reduction works sensibly on millions of inputs.

Liu's program genus2reduction, included with Sage, is a C program that is written to use the Pari C library.
