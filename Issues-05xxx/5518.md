The attached patch vastly improves the efficiency of the multiplicative_order() function for number field elements.  Before, this example:

```
 sage: x = polygen(QQ)
            sage: K.<a>=NumberField(x^40 - x^20 + 4)
            sage: u = 1/4*a^30 + 1/4*a^10 + 1/2
            sage: u.multiplicative_order()
            6
            sage: a.multiplicative_order()
            +Infinity
```
would have required raising a to the power 2**40 (I'm serious).  Now it just works (fast).

Keywords: **number field multiplicative order**

Component: **number theory**

This is excellent.  A great speed up, and it gives the right answer!  

I would suggest adding the doctest

```
sage: K.<a, b> = NumberField([x^2 + x + 1, x^2 - 3])
sage: z = (a - 1)*b/3
sage: z.multiplicative_order()
12
```
because sage-3.4 says the order is `+infinity`.
