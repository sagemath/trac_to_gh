It's really a shame Sage can't produce graphics like http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Jan_Homann/Mathematics yet.

Missing doctests:
	 * get_minmax_data(self):


Possibly wrong (function name doesn't occur in doctests):
	 * _render_on_subplot(self, subplot):

```

* I was puzzled why I couldn't change the aspect ratio (this is *not* a general problem with contour plots (say) in Sage):

```
time complex_plot(zeta, (-5, 5), (-5, 5)).show(aspect_ratio=4)
```

Otherwise the code looks very *very* good.

I added a doctest to get coverage up to 100%. 

As for the aspect ratio issue, no idea. The same happens with density_plot: 

```
sage: density_plot(sin(x) - sin(y), (-5,5), (-5,5)).show(aspect_ratio=4)
```

Maybe we could move that to a new ticket.

Hmm, there are also the following two doctest failures:

Got:
    {'xmin': -1.0, 'ymin': -3.0, 'ymax': 4.0, 'xmax': 2.0}
**********************************************************************
```

The first one is trivial to fix by adding the variables to the plot ranges, the second one is caused by the dictionary being printing differently, so it might be a good idea to print the minmax_data as a list in a consistent format.

I am bumping this ticket to 3.4.2 - if it is fixed it can still go into 3.4.1.

Cheers,

Michael

As a reviewer I am finding this very annoying.  It means I have to somehow revert the patch in my own tree before I can safely apply yours *and* it makes it very very hard for me to see what you actually changed.  I would *much* rather have a part 2 patch that applies on top of the first one. 

On a clean 3.4.1.rc1 build (which I think never had #5606 applied, so far as I can tell) I get:

Just FYI: As mentioned above two hunk that delete and import of "sage.plot.all" in log.py and mathml.py need to be deleted since they are already gone in 3.4.1.rc1. Then the patch applies and passes doctests for me.
