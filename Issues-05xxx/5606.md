Missing doctests:

Possibly wrong (function name doesn't occur in doctests):

```

* I was puzzled why I couldn't change the aspect ratio (this is *not* a general problem with contour plots (say) in Sage):

```

Otherwise the code looks very *very* good.

I added a doctest to get coverage up to 100%. 

As for the aspect ratio issue, no idea. The same happens with density_plot: 

```
sage: density_plot(sin(x) - sin(y), (-5,5), (-5,5)).show(aspect_ratio=4)
```

Maybe we could move that to a new ticket.

The second and third hunk in 5606-complex-plot.patch are already in Sage via another patch, so I am attaching the version I merged (assuming doctests pass for me).

Hmm, there are also the following two doctest failures:

```
sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/plot/complex_plot.pyx

File "/scratch/mabshoff/sage-3.4.1.rc2/devel/sage-main/sage/plot/complex_plot.pyx", line 146:

Expected nothing
Got:

    {'xmax': 2.0, 'xmin': -1.0, 'ymax': 4.0, 'ymin': -3.0}
Got:
    {'xmin': -1.0, 'ymin': -3.0, 'ymax': 4.0, 'xmax': 2.0}
**********************************************************************
```

The first one is trivial to fix by adding the variables to the plot ranges, the second one is caused by the dictionary being printing differently, so it might be a good idea to print the minmax_data as a list in a consistent format.

I am bumping this ticket to 3.4.2 - if it is fixed it can still go into 3.4.1.

Cheers,

Michael

> I've updated the patch, should pass doctests now. 

As a reviewer I am finding this very annoying.  It means I have to somehow revert the patch in my own tree before I can safely apply yours *and* it makes it very very hard for me to see what you actually changed.  I would *much* rather have a part 2 patch that applies on top of the first one. 

On a clean 3.4.1.rc1 build (which I think never had #5606 applied, so far as I can tell) I get:
