On the other hand, `id.right_kernel()` and `id.kernel()` both work, and `id.kernel()` actually computes the left kernel.  Note also that the documentation for both left_kernel and right_kernel says that the answer will be a vector space, not a module over the integers; this should be fixed, too.

A few comments: the documentation still says \"vector space\" when computing the kernel of an integer matrix, but I can live with that.  Perhaps more seriously, if you don't apply patch #5089, then computing the kernel (or left_kernel or right_kernel) of a sparse integer matrix leads to a segmentation fault.

Since #5089 is being merged I am changing this to a positive review. The documentation issue about vector spaces vs. modules should be addressed via a followup ticket. 

Cheers,
