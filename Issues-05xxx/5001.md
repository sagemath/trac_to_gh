sage: id = matrix(ZZ, 2, 2, [[1, 0], [0, 1]]) 
sage: id.left_kernel()
Traceback
...
TypeError: Argument K (= Integer Ring) must be a field.
```
On the other hand, `id.right_kernel()` and `id.kernel()` both work, and `id.kernel()` actually computes the left kernel.  Note also that the documentation for both left_kernel and right_kernel says that the answer will be a vector space, not a module over the integers; this should be fixed, too.



Keywords: **matrix, kernel**

Since #5089 is being merged I am changing this to a positive review. The documentation issue about vector spaces vs. modules should be addressed via a followup ticket.
