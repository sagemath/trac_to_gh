```
If you do

```
sage: G = graphs.CompleteGraph(5)
sage: G.show(edge_colors={'red':(0,1)})
```

what you get is one red edge...

The default color should be black.

Attachment: **[trac_5914.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket5914/trac_5914.patch.gz)**

Quick remark: If you do 

```
sage: G = graphs.CompleteGraph(5)
sage: G.show(edge_colors={'red':(0,1)})
```
as you put in the ticket description, you get an error.  The proper input is:

```
sage: G = graphs.CompleteGraph(5)
sage: G.show(edge_colors={'red':[(0,1)]})
```

This patch works fine.
