The ntl makefile appears to rely on compiler flags specified as a target dependency being passed to the compiler.  This fails on at least FreeBSD, resulting in an attempt to include non-PIC objects in a shared library.

Instead, explicitly pass -fPIC to the sub-make used for the shared object build.
