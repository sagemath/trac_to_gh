REFEREE REPORT



The patch **permgp.patch** applies OK against Sage 3.4 and all doctests passed with the options

```
-t -long
```
The reference manual builds fine. Looking at the HTML doc for `sage/groups/perm_gps/permgroup.py`, I see that the patch fixes the formatting issues that it meant to fix. So positive review. 



However, while reviewing the patch I noticed that there are more formatting issues in `sage/groups/perm_gps/permgroup.py`. But these are addressed in ticket #5542.
