Yes, by gp.  I have no idea if it is in Linbox.

sage: gp(m).matrank()
2
sage: pari(m).matrank()
boom -- matrank not wrapped

Somebody *could* implement this by wrapping pari's matrank then doing the conversion and calling it.  Of course, much better would be to do:

sage: m.change_ring(m.base_ring().fraction_field()).rank()
2

which already works. 

I am puzzled that rank doesn't first change base to the fraction field, *then* call echelon form -- it's stupid that it tries to call echelon form over the same base ring, since that is often much harder (e.g., it is Hermite form over ZZ).

This seems to work now:

```

sage: version()
'Sage Version 4.6.2, Release Date: 2011-02-25'
sage: P.<x> = PolynomialRing(GF(17))
sage: m = Matrix(P,2,2)
sage: m.randomize()
sage: m
[     15*x^2 + 16*x  9*x^2 + 12*x + 12]
[13*x^2 + 16*x + 16   4*x^2 + 5*x + 12]
sage: m.rank()
2
```
