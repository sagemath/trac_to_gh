Yes, by gp.  I have no idea if it is in Linbox.

sage: gp(m).matrank()
2
sage: pari(m).matrank()
boom -- matrank not wrapped

Somebody *could* implement this by wrapping pari's matrank then doing the conversion and calling it.  Of course, much better would be to do:

sage: m.change_ring(m.base_ring().fraction_field()).rank()
2

which already works. 

I am puzzled that rank doesn't first change base to the fraction field, *then* call echelon form -- it's stupid that it tries to call echelon form over the same base ring, since that is often much harder (e.g., it is Hermite form over ZZ).

sage: P.<x> = PolynomialRing(GF(17))
sage: m = Matrix(P,2,2)
sage: m.randomize()
sage: m
[     15*x^2 + 16*x  9*x^2 + 12*x + 12]
