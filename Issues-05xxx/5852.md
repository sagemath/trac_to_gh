Currently, `$SAGE_ROOT/sage` uses (first among other alternate methods) `readlink -n` to detect the directory where the script lives (that's $SAGE_ROOT), but that is broken because
- It only works when `$0` (the sage executable itself) is a symbolic link
- If the sage executable is a symbolic link, then `readlink -n` returns the link itself, not the canonicalized name.  Example: if `/usr/local/sage-4.7.1/sage` is a symbolic link to `sagefoo`, then `SAGE_ROOT` would become `sagefoo` when `'/usr/local/sage-4.7.1/sagefoo` is intended.
- The symlink expansion may not be completely done, and `$SAGE_ROOT` could end up with a non-canonical dirname, which leads to issues with testing.
- The code to detect `SAGE_ROOT` inside `sage-env` does not canonicalize the pathname at all.  This should be fixed as well. (The only case where `sage-env` is run without `SAGE_ROOT` being set is when testing Sage from the `Makefile`, i.e. when running `make ptest` or similar.)

Note that we should do this in a portable way, without using `realpath`, `readlink -f` or the likes.

See also #11704, which solves the same problem for `DOT_SAGE`.

I can confirm that it does not work on MacOS X.10.4.11 (e.g. Anne Schilling's machine)

A fix would be most welcome, as this makes sage -t make false reports of broken test files.

Should I set a positive review?

Besides, what about adding a switch to sage -t to specify manually that the given file is inside or outside the sage source tree?

This would make a workaround for MacOX X, and also be occasionally be useful. For example, I often run tests from one sage source tree with another sage to compare the results.

<a id='comment:8'></a>Question.  Does

```

I wonder who wrote this weird SAGE_ROOT code in the first place?  I wrote something a long time ago, but it bears no resemblance to the current code.


By the way, I've had reports of major failures caused by using `readlink -nf` by one user who has a symlink + nfs mount setup.  Their problems are solved by deleting the `readlink -nf` line.   Why don't we use realpath first and only if that doesn't work use something else?  It seems like realpath is the right choice, since it's supposed to " converts each filename argument to an absolute pathname, which has no components that are symbolic links or the special
       .  or ..  directory entries...  Please note that mostly the same functionality is provided by the ‘-f’ option."

There is no realpath on OS X, but that is ok since readlink doesn't work ever on OS X anyways, so no loss.

Does \n> \n> ```\n> readlink -n sage\n> ```\n> work on any platform?!\n\n\nYes it does: it reads the content of a symbolic link. It succeeds if and only if the argument is actually a symbolic link, e.g.\n\n```\n~/sandbox$ ls -l\ntotal 0\n~/sandbox$ mkdir sage1\n~/sandbox$ readlink sage1 ; echo $?  ## fails b/c sage1 is not a symlink\n1\n~/sandbox$ ln -s sage1 sage2\n~/sandbox$ readlink sage2 ; echo $?  ## ok b/c sage2 is actually a symlink\nsage1\n0\n```\nThe option `-n` means to not print a trainling newline character; I don't think it really make a difference due to bash usual escaping rules.\n\n>  It gives an error on *both* OS X and Linux.  Why is it even there?!\n\n\nIt was there before the patch in this ticket, so that if `$0` (the path to the script one is running) is actually a symlink to the real path of the sage script, the detection of `SAGE_ROOT` works. On systems that support `-f`, that is a more complete solution, but the fallback was left for the benefit of systems where `readlink -f` does not work (e.g. OS X).\n\nFollowing my example above, here's an example where `-f` is needed:\n\n```\n~/sandbox$ ln -s sage2 sage3\ntornaria@bip:~/sandbox$ readlink -n sage3\nsage2tornaria@bip:~/sandbox$ readlink sage3\nsage2\ntornaria@bip:~/sandbox$ readlink -f sage3\n/home/tornaria/sandbox/sage1\n```\n\nThe other major case is when there are symlinks in some of the components of the path, those get canonicalized by `readlink -f`, but not by plain `readlink` (this leads to failures as shown in the description).\n\n\n> By the way, I've had reports of major failures caused by using `readlink -nf` by one user who has a symlink + nfs mount setup.  Their problems are solved by deleting the `readlink -nf` line.   Why don't we use realpath first and only if that doesn't work use something else?  It seems like realpath is the right choice, since it's supposed to \" converts each filename argument to an absolute pathname, which has no components that are symbolic links or the special\n>        .  or ..  directory entries...  Please note that mostly the same functionality is provided by the \u2018-f\u2019 option.\"\n\n\nCan you give a pointer to those? Not using `readlink -f` leads to major failures in testing, as described in the description of the ticket.\n\nDo you actually know that in those cases `realpath` works? It seems to me that both are implemented using `realpath(3)`, so they should be the same unless I'm missing something.\n\n> There is no realpath on OS X, but that is ok since readlink doesn't work ever on OS X anyways, so no loss. \n\n\nThere is no `realpath` in most systems I have access to (other than sage.math).

Yes it does: it reads the content of a symbolic link. It succeeds if and only if the argument is actually a symbolic link, e.g.

```
~/sandbox$ ls -l
total 0
~/sandbox$ mkdir sage1
~/sandbox$ readlink sage1 ; echo $?  ## fails b/c sage1 is not a symlink
1
~/sandbox$ ln -s sage1 sage2
~/sandbox$ readlink sage2 ; echo $?  ## ok b/c sage2 is actually a symlink
sage1
0
```
The option `-n` means to not print a trainling newline character; I don't think it really make a difference due to bash usual escaping rules.

>  It gives an error on *both* OS X and Linux.  Why is it even there?!


It was there before the patch in this ticket, so that if `$0` (the path to the script one is running) is actually a symlink to the real path of the sage script, the detection of `SAGE_ROOT` works. On systems that support `-f`, that is a more complete solution, but the fallback was left for the benefit of systems where `readlink -f` does not work (e.g. OS X).

Following my example above, here's an example where `-f` is needed:

```
~/sandbox$ ln -s sage2 sage3
tornaria@bip:~/sandbox$ readlink -n sage3
sage2tornaria@bip:~/sandbox$ readlink sage3
sage2
tornaria@bip:~/sandbox$ readlink -f sage3
/home/tornaria/sandbox/sage1
```

The other major case is when there are symlinks in some of the components of the path, those get canonicalized by `readlink -f`, but not by plain `readlink` (this leads to failures as shown in the description).


> By the way, I've had reports of major failures caused by using `readlink -nf` by one user who has a symlink + nfs mount setup.  Their problems are solved by deleting the `readlink -nf` line.   Why don't we use realpath first and only if that doesn't work use something else?  It seems like realpath is the right choice, since it's supposed to " converts each filename argument to an absolute pathname, which has no components that are symbolic links or the special
>        .  or ..  directory entries...  Please note that mostly the same functionality is provided by the ‘-f’ option."


Can you give a pointer to those? Not using `readlink -f` leads to major failures in testing, as described in the description of the ticket.

Do you actually know that in those cases `realpath` works? It seems to me that both are implemented using `realpath(3)`, so they should be the same unless I'm missing something.

> There is no realpath on OS X, but that is ok since readlink doesn't work ever on OS X anyways, so no loss. 


There is no `realpath` in most systems I have access to (other than sage.math). In fact, `readlink` is pretty much standard (possibly POSIX), although `-f` option is not (a GNUism?). For GNU systems (e.g. linux), it comes bundled in coreutils, which means it will be available everywhere. OTOH, `realpath` comes in *optional* package `realpath`. Do you know of a system where `readlink -f` doesn't work but `realpath(1)` is available?

OTOH, realpath(3) seems to be a POSIX standard, and it seems to be available on OS X:

```
$ nm /usr/lib/libc.dylib | grep realpath
/usr/lib/libc.dylib(realpath.So):
9003f1f0 T _realpath
```
so an alternative would be to compile our own `realpath` binary and somehow use it from the startup script. But we need a path to SAGE_ROOT so we can find SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/realpath... auch... (doesn't need to be canonical, though.... so we could use readlink a few times to get a path to the actual sage script, and then run `realpath` from there).

<a id='comment:10'></a>It's possible that this ticket should be reverted until a major bug it causes is fixed.   

The reason for this ticket in the first place was the following, as given in the ticket description:

```

4153919efe1edcd34ad7fa193122d679  sage-3.4/sage

/home/sage$ type sage
```

Notice the symlink of the Sage script

```
/home/sage$ ln -sf /home/sage/sage-3.4-symlink/sage /home/tornaria/bin/sage
```

For the record, this is *not* how I meant the sage script is meant to be used.  I bet this isn't documented, but it should be.  The script should never be used that way.  Instead one should do

```
/home/sage$ cp /home/sage/sage-3.4-symlink/sage /home/tornaria/bin/sage

Me not intending this means that elsewhere in the Sage build/test system this assumption is made, and the workaround on this ticket actually seriously breaks things for some users. 

The change in this ticket causes serious breakage for people whose home directory is NFS mounted, and for which their Sage build is on another volume that is symlinked from their home directory. i.e., this sort of setup:

```
    cd ~wstein    # my home directory is NFS mounted.
    mkdir /tmp/wstein       # /tmp is a local disk
    ln -s /tmp/wstein sage-build
    cd sage-build    # 
    # build sage here, doctesting fails completely
```

I'm doing a test build for myself to confirm that this happens, and if so and I can't figure out how to fix this promptly (maybe I will be able to), then we have to revert this change, and document that one can't just symlink the sage script out.

If you only use the script in *that* way, then the

```
if [ "$SAGE_ROOT" = "....." ];  then
```
branch would never be taken, and as the patch in this ticket only touches this branch, it can't break anything.

In practice, it is much more convenient to just use a symlink to the script, if it can be worked out. Before this patch, it turned out that the real, canonical path for SAGE_ROOT could be identified incorrectly, and *this* causes doctesting to fail.

This sort of setup is *exactly* what used to cause breakage for me, because the `SAGE_ROOT` was incorrectly computed (to a non-canonical path). What would you expect `SAGE_ROOT` to be computed to, other than the canonical path? e.g., continuing your example above:

```
    cd ~wstein/sage-build
    tar xvf sage-nnn.tar
    cd sage-nnn
    ./sage -sh
    echo "$SAGE_ROOT"
```
Are you expecting SAGE_ROOT above to be "/home/wstein/sage-build/sage-nnn/", or "/tmp/wstein/sage-nnn" ?

Before the patch, it was the former, non canonical path; after the patch, it is the latter, which is IMO the correct canonical path. When SAGE_ROOT is non-canonical, running doctests for files in the sage library fails b/c they are not recognized as part of the sage library, etc.
    
I don't see how the fact that this is NFS mounted could be relevant to the issue.

Okay, I did find one counterexamples (I only looked in local/bin before):
- The top-level Makefile calls `sage-env` without first setting `SAGE_ROOT`.

I also noticed that `data/extcode/sage/ext/mac-app/start-sage.sh` has its own `SAGE_ROOT`-detecting code but it probably shouldn't and should use `sage-env` instead.

It seems the MacOS X app wants just the opposite, i.e. to **not** resolve symbolic links, since the absolute, canonicalized path may frequently change.

Therefore it always creates (on start-up) the same, "constant" symbolic link from `/tmp/sage-mac-app` to the current, volatile `$SAGE_ROOT`, which can only work if the application is also actually *always* built in (a real directory) `/tmp/sage-mac-app/` (such that no change of hardcoded paths is necessary).

Cf. #11755. In that case, the app should also define some special environment variable, such that `sage-env` (and perhaps also `sage`) can treat this specifically, namely not canonicalize `$SAGE_ROOT`.

The question is: why are things done this way?  It seems to me that the `/tmp/sage-mac-app` symlink is an ugly hack around a problem which can probably be solved in a better way.

Of course it does.  You just have to

* if no path remains after that, it's the current working directory, i.e. path=".".
* `cd` to that path and do `pwd -P`.  Doesn't matter whether the path was relative or absolute.

Yes, it works.

You are right that `/bin/pwd` does not always support `-P`, even on sage.math:

```
jdemeyer@sage:~$ /bin/pwd -P
/bin/pwd: invalid option -- P
Try `/bin/pwd --help' for more information.
```

But it seems `bash` always supports `pwd -P` as shell builtin, so we are safe.
