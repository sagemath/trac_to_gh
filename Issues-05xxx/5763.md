The attached patch adds conversion to polynomial rings.  Two doctests fail at this time; they rely on being able to convert to CDF and ComplexField(100).  I didn't want them to get forgotten so I left them in.

Attachment: **[trac_5763-symbolic-polynomial.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket5763/trac_5763-symbolic-polynomial.patch.gz)**

Thanks Nick!

The patch looks great, I am looking at the doctests right now. 

Note that #5753 fixes the coercion of constants to pynac, so you can use `is_a_constant` in the .is_constant() function.

I will see what I can do about the doctest failures, and hopefully post a patch fixing them soon.

In fact, you can make the doctest works by changing the if is_constant check to coerce the pyobject in.  It's a one line fix that I haven't posted here, it works well for me in practice.

This patch seems to have been forgotten during the "pynac push." I recall that it was briefly mentioned on IRC once.

I suggest closing this issue as wontfix now. Trac doesn't allow me close tickets any more.

The docstring should adhere to ReST formatting. Some examples follow this rule, but most don't. I'm merely enforcing proper ReST formatting, not actually reviewing the whole patch.
