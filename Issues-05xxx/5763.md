Thanks Nick!

The patch looks great, I am looking at the doctests right now. 

Note that #5753 fixes the coercion of constants to pynac, so you can use `is_a_constant` in the .is_constant() function.

I will see what I can do about the doctest failures, and hopefully post a patch fixing them soon.

In fact, you can make the doctest works by changing the if is_constant check to coerce the pyobject in.  It's a one line fix that I haven't posted here, it works well for me in practice.

This patch seems to have been forgotten during the "pynac push." I recall that it was briefly mentioned on IRC once.

I suggest closing this issue as wontfix now. Trac doesn't allow me close tickets any more.
