It is impossible to create ideals in rings of the form Integers mod n:

```
sage: R = Integers(10)
sage: R.ideal(1)

(as above)
```

It looks as if the ideal() method for class  `QuotientRing_generic ` is
only really geared to polynomial ring quotients.

But it seems the resulting ideals still need some work, for example `_contains_()` in `rings.ideal.Ideal_generic` is not implemented.
