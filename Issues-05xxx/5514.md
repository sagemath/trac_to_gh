This feature would emulate Mathematica's [RegionFunction](http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/RegionFunction.html). The user should be able to provide a function to parametric_plot3d which, given a (u,v) coordinate, would return whether to include that point in the overall plot. In this way, the user can specify which region to include in the plot drawn.

The syntax would look something like this:

```
var('u,v')
parametric_plot3d([u,v,u^2+v^2], (-2, 2), (-2, 2), region_function=lambda u,v: u^2+v^2>1)
```
This would draw a paraboloid with a circle cut out of the middle.

Another thing that would be nice is if you could specify the limits on uv in terms of u and v. Like:

```
parametric_plot3d([u,v,u^2+v^2], (-2, v), (-2, 2))
```
Here u would be bounded above -2 and below v. We could automatically translate this into a region function like simply:

```
parametric_plot3d([u,v,u^2+v^2], (-2, 2), (-2, 2), region=lambda u, v: u <= v)
```
But then we would have to automatically choose a concrete upper bound for u somehow...

Here's an implementation of region_function that simply removes all faces which do not satisfy the predicate. It looks pretty bad unless you use a high plot resolution, but it works!

Yesterday William brought to light some issues that made me realize the task of creating a better looking region_function is frought with some subtlety.

You're right that it is really choppy.  I had a go at it: apply trac-5514-region-function.patch instead of the first patch.

This implements region_function for indexed face sets, as well as a specialized version for parametric surfaces.  The nice thing about making it available for indexed face sets is that *any* surface can use it now, and it will be easier after some more glue code is written.

To encourage reviews, here is what is possible (and it looks a lot smoother now; I don't just delete faces, I just delete bad vertices and redefine faces):

```
    We use a region function to plot a figure with a circular region (in u,v coordinates) excluded
    from its center::

        sage: u, v = var('u, v')
        sage: parametric_plot3d([u, v*u, u^2 + v^2], (u, -2, 2), (v, -2, 2), region_function=lambda u,v: u^2+v^2>3, plot_points=(150,150)) 

    Plot part of a sphere (using spherical coordinates):
        sage: theta, phi = var('theta, phi')
        sage: p=parametric_plot3d([cos(theta)*sin(phi), sin(theta)*sin(phi), cos(phi)], (theta, 0, 2*pi), (phi, 0, pi), region_function=lambda theta, phi: phi<math.pi/2, plot_points=(100,100))
        sage: show(p)
        sage: p.clip_region(lambda theta,phi: theta<math.pi/2)
        sage: show(p)
        sage: p.clip_region(lambda x,y,z: z<0.5)
        sage: show(p)

    A region of a function::
        sage: var('x,y')
        (x,y)
        sage: plot3d(sin(x)*cos(y),(x,-3,3),(y,-3,3), region_function=lambda x,y: x<y^2, plot_points=(100,100))     
        sage: plot3d(sin(x)*cos(y),(x,-3,3),(y,-3,3), region_function=lambda x,y,z: z<0 and not x>y, plot_points=(100,100))
        sage: plot3d(sin(x)*cos(y),(x,-3,3),(y,-3,3), region_function=lambda x,y: x^2+y^2<1 or x^2+y^2>4 , plot_points=(100,100))
        sage: plot3d(sin(x)*cos(y),(x,-3,3),(y,-3,3), region_function=lambda x,y: x^2+y^2>1 and x^2+y^2<4 , plot_points=(100,100))
        
    A region of the xy plane::
        sage: var('x,y')
        sage: plot3d(1, (x,-3,3), (y,-3,3), region_function=lambda x,y: x^2+y^2<7 and x<y, plot_points=(100,100))
        sage: plot3d(1, (x,-3,3), (y,-3,3), region_function=lambda x,y: x^2+y^2<7 and x<y, adaptive=True, initial_depth=7)

```

Also, with some glue code written, this should be possible

```
a=sphere()
a.clip_region(lambda x,y,z:z<0)
show(a)
```


THIS PATCH IS NOT READY YET.

Here are some things that still need to be done:

* Several functions need doctests (like the indexed face set clip_region)
* I had to comment out _clean_point_list() in line ~300 of parametric_surface.pyx because it destroyed the relationship between the vertices and the u,v coordinates that generated the vertex.  We really ought to maintain that information separately for a parametric surface, and then update it.  Once we have a way of retrieving that information (i.e, for a vertex, give me the u and v that generated the vertex), we can enable _clean_point_list().  This should probably be done before this patch is merged.

Great progress on this, Bill and Jason!  I had a go with a few of the commands in the doctests and a couple of my own.  Two thoughts.

1.  The JMOL bounding box may be computed pre-clip?  Compare

`plot3d(6-2*x<sup>2-5*y</sup>2, (x, -10, 10), (y, -10, 10), region_function=lambda x,y: 6-2*x<sup>2-6*y</sup>2>0)`

with

`plot3d(6-2*x<sup>2-5*y</sup>2, (x, -sqrt(3), sqrt(3)), (y, -1, 1), region_function=lambda x,y: 6-2*x<sup>2-6*y</sup>2>0)`

The former would seem to use the unseen faces near inputs like (-10,10) to compute the vertical axis and the plot is then a really, really insignificant portion of the bounding box.

2.  I thought maybe something like

`plot3d(sqrt(6-2*x<sup>2-5*y</sup>2), (x, -sqrt(3), sqrt(3)), (y, -1, 1), region_function=lambda x,y: 6-2*x<sup>2-6*y</sup>2>0)`

would now be possible, but it appears the clip comes after the evaluations, thus this raises an error for the negatives in the square root.  So maybe this should be handled with some sort of piecewise definition for the function and then the excess would be clipped by a `region_function` before showing it.

OK, thinking while I write - here's a hack - insert an absolute value, then trim:

`plot3d(sqrt(abs(6-2*x<sup>2-5*y</sup>2)), (x, -sqrt(3), sqrt(3)), (y, -1, 1), region_function=lambda x,y: 6-2*x<sup>2-6*y</sup>2>0)`

Nicely done.  Holler if I can provide more testing as you finish this up.

IndexFaceSet computes the bounding box by finding the min/max of its vertices. The problem you describe appears to occur because we don't remove all of the unused vertices. The issue is somewhat subtle since if we remove a face, that does not necessarily mean the vertices that it references are not in use by another face.

That's because the clipping is done after the function is evaluated at every (u,v) coordinate. Maybe we should modify eval_grid so that it does not perform this unecessary (and sometimes troublesome) computation.

I'm uploading a patch that makes some cosmetic changes, including renaming "clip_region" to "clip" and "region_function" to "region" (following the convention adopted in implicit_plot3d). I'm hoping to get some work done on this ticket this week!

I believe the `_clean_point_list` function clears out unused points (implementing the functionality that Bill describes above).  However, we don't call this (i.e., we commented out the existing call to this) so that we can still get an easy correspondence between the parameter values and the points generated (i.e., the points are still in a grid of parameter values, as long as none are missing).

We need this correspondence between vertices and parameter values so that we can clip based on the parameter values.

So, we could:

* make it so that the region passed into the plot3d command is used during the initial evaluation; if the point passes the region function, then a vertex is calculated from it.  This would probably save time anyway.  If we do this, we need to take into account the different signatures of region functions.  For a two-argument function, check before the vertex is calculated, and for a three- or five-argument region function, check after the vertex is calculated (because the arguments to the region function include the vertex coordinates).  Because of this last possibility, we probably also want to also
* make the indexed face sets handle evaluations which throw errors, in a similar way that 2d plotting handles undefined values.  This would also probably necessitate storing the parameter values with the vertices.

Either way, we violate the assumption that the vertices are from a grid of parameter values.  We probably will have to store the parameter values that generate each vertex.
