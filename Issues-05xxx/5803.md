Ok, positive review on the spkg. I did a number of cleanups and added a proper SPKG.txt changelog entry that Robert has been skipping forever.

Robert: Please base future spkgs on this one since I have cleaned up this spkg before. You have then based it on the a non-clean spkg and last time I let it slide, but it won't happen again and I will give it a non-positive review :)

Doctesting the patch right now, but changing the review in anticipation.
