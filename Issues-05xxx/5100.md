With Safari on an Intel iMac, sage 3.3.alpha1:

From the notebook interface, if I select "Trash" to get the list of deleted worksheets, then clicking "Empty trash" doesn't actually empty the trash.  It sends me back to the list of active worksheets, but if I click on "Trash" again, I see the same list of deleted worksheets.

With Firefox on the same iMac, emptying the trash works just fine.

This sounds similar to #5095. There were also some places where Safari acted differently than Firefox, so this is likely due to the work around TinyMCE.

Jason, Mike: Any idea what might be going on?

The issue we had with TinyMCE acting different under Safari vs. Firefox had to do with the browser executing javascript code when html was inserted dynamically into the DOM of the browser page.  Apparently Firefox automatically executes code inside of <script> tags that are inserted into the DOM, while Safari doesn't.  To overcome this, we ended up stripping out the <script> tags from any HTML that was inserted into the DOM and running the script code separately.

Of course, the above comment only applies to <script> blocks loaded dynamically; any <script> blocks in the original HTML page should execute just normally.

I don't know if that is the issue, but since mabshoff asked, I thought I'd mention it.

"Unmatched </input> encountered.  Ignoring tag."

This linked to line 38 of my HTML, which was:

```
<input id="search_worksheets" size=20 onkeypress="return search_worksheets_enter_pressed(event, 'trash');" value""></input>
```

By the way, this *also* happened pretty much any time I used the Current Folder links in any way, so I'm not sure how this error report actually has anything to do with the onClick="empty_trash(); return false;" (should that be False?), but it did generate an error, so perhaps it will be useful to someone.

Now this is with 3.3.alpha2 + the 5095 patch.

When I click the Trash button to get the list of deleted worksheets, I get this in the error console:

```
Unmatched </input> encountered.  Ignoring tag.
http://localhost:8000/home/admin/?typ=trash (line 68)
```

This points to the line

```
<input id="search_worksheets" size=20 onkeypress="return search_worksheets_enter_pressed(event, 'trash');" 
```

Clicking "Empty Trash" then gives me

```
Unmatched </input> encountered.  Ignoring tag.
http://localhost:8000/home/admin/ (line 68)
```
This points to the line

```
<input id="search_worksheets" size=20 onkeypress="return search_worksheets_enter_pressed(event, 'active');" 
```

(By the way, for what it's worth, you can turn on the Develop menu in Safari from the "Advanced" tab in the preferences -- no need to quit and restart.)
