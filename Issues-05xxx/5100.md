With Safari on an Intel iMac, sage 3.3.alpha1:

From the notebook interface, if I select "Trash" to get the list of deleted worksheets, then clicking "Empty trash" doesn't actually empty the trash.  It sends me back to the list of active worksheets, but if I click on "Trash" again, I see the same list of deleted worksheets.

With Firefox on the same iMac, emptying the trash works just fine.

This sounds similar to #5095. There were also some places where Safari acted differently than Firefox, so this is likely due to the work around TinyMCE.

Jason, Mike: Any idea what might be going on?

"Unmatched </input> encountered.  Ignoring tag."

This linked to line 38 of my HTML, which was:

```
<input id="search_worksheets" size=20 onkeypress="return search_worksheets_enter_pressed(event, 'trash');" value""></input>
```

By the way, this *also* happened pretty much any time I used the Current Folder links in any way, so I'm not sure how this error report actually has anything to do with the onClick="empty_trash(); return false;" (should that be False?), but it did generate an error, so perhaps it will be useful to someone.

<div id="comment:15" align="right">comment:15</div>

Now this is with 3.3.alpha2 + the 5095 patch.

When I click the Trash button to get the list of deleted worksheets, I get this in the error console:

```
Unmatched </input> encountered.  Ignoring tag.
http://localhost:8000/home/admin/?typ=trash (line 68)
```

This points to the line

```
<input id="search_worksheets" size=20 onkeypress="return search_worksheets_enter_pressed(event, 'trash');" 
```

Clicking "Empty Trash" then gives me

```
Unmatched </input> encountered.  Ignoring tag.
http://localhost:8000/home/admin/ (line 68)
```
This points to the line

```
<input id="search_worksheets" size=20 onkeypress="return search_worksheets_enter_pressed(event, 'active');" 
```

(By the way, for what it's worth, you can turn on the Develop menu in Safari from the "Advanced" tab in the preferences -- no need to quit and restart.)
