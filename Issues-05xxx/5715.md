```
Since `matrix_mod2_dense` defines its own `str` function, it overrides the function for general matrices, so for dense matrices over GF(2), subdivisions are not printed.  (See [this discussion](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_frm/thread/a08df4717024f9c0).)

This patch deletes the `str` method for dense matrices over GF(2).

Needs work.  There is a *very good* reason that there is a str method for GF(2) -- it's for speed!  Check this out:

```
BEFORE YOUR PATCH:
sage: a = random_matrix(GF(2),1000)
sage: time b = a.str()
CPU times: user 0.41 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 0.42 s
Wall time: 0.42 s
```

```
AFTER YOUR PATCH:
sage: a = random_matrix(GF(2),1000)
sage: time b = a.str()
CPU times: user 5.02 s, sys: 0.86 s, total: 5.88 s
Wall time: 5.89 s

I posted a new patch that handles subdivisions. I went ahead and sped up the str method while I was there too. 

Before

```
sage: a = random_matrix(GF(2),1000)
sage: time b = a.str()
CPU times: user 0.48 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 0.49 s
Wall time: 0.50 s
```

After

```
sage: a = random_matrix(GF(2),1000)
sage: time b = a.str()
CPU times: user 0.01 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 0.02 s
Wall time: 0.02 s
```
