MPIR 1.0 brings significant speed improvements. An spkg can be found at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/release-cycles-3.4.1/rc0/gmp-mpir-1.0.rc5.spkg

I have integrated two fixes for OSX and Solaris/x86 so that the test suite passes on both systems which will be in the final MPIR 1.0.

Cheers,

Michael
