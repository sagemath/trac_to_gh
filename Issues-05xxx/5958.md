The parameter should be ignored, but for compatibility it is necessary.

E.g. this should work:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = CC[]
sage: I = R.ideal(x^2+y^2-1,x*y-1)
sage: I.variety()
```

but it raises an except in 3.4.1.

The patch fixes the exception, however:

```
sage: sage: R.<x,y> = CC[]
sage: sage: I = R.ideal(x^2+y^2-1,x*y-1)
sage: sage: I.variety()
verbose 0 (1735: multi_polynomial_ideal.py, variety) Warning: falling back to very slow toy implementation.
[{y: -1.00000000000000}, {y: 0}, {y: 1.00000000000000}]
```

which is certainly the wrong answer (`x` is missing), thus there seems to be another bug.

Martin,

Sorry for the late reply, but according to Lazard's paper, the algorithm I used ("Triangular") does NOT need a lexicographic term ordering. On p. 124, beginning of Section 6:

*These algorithms do not depend explicitly on the ordering; however, they are mainly designed for degree orderings for which the base is more easily obtained; they work also for lexicographic ordering, but, for them, we dispose of a structure theorem which permit us to provide a better algorithm (section 8).*

The algorithm I implemented was Triangular (line 6). So the switch the lexicographic is unnecessary.

I don't know how to fix the problem with complex coefficients, though.

I have found two bugs. One of them is not solvable from my end, and possibly not at all (others who know more should comment).

The first one: elim_pol is not always computing the correct polynomial. After removing the switch to lexicographic order, change line 358 (?) of toy_variety.py from

```
  for each in xrange(len(coeffs)-1):
```
to

```
  for each in xrange(len(coeffs)):
```

I have no idea why I had it count until the next-to-last element of coeffs; all of them are necessary. I can submit a patch if you like.

However: even after this fix, a problem remains: line 292 (?) triangular_factorization tries to compute a Groebner basis of an ideal whose generators **should** have a common solution. This is the source of the 1.0 appearing in the triangular variety. Unfortunately, the computed basis is 1.0, suggesting that the ideal has no common solution! I have an idea why this is happening, but I can't yet say for sure.

To follow up, the problem occurs when computing the Groebner basis over CC.

I'll use the example given:

The Groebner basis computed is [y^3 + x - y, x^2 + y^2 - 1.00000000000000, x*y - 1.00000000000000].

The result p from elim_pol is y^4 - y^2 + 1.0. (This reflects the bugfix I identified above; it used to return y<sup>4-y</sup>2.)

The first factor q of p is y - 0.866025403784439 - 0.500000000000000*I.

The reduction of B modulo q gives us

[x - 0.866025403784438 + 0.500000000000001*I,
 x^2 - 0.499999999999999 + 0.866025403784439*I,
 (0.866025403784439 + 0.500000000000000*I)*x - 1.00000000000000]

**This should be a consistent system:** the first polynomial is a factor of the second, and the solution to the third is *nearly* the same as the solution to the first: 0.866025403784438 - 0.500000000000001*I vs. 0.866025403784438 - 0.500000000000000*I. This appears to be a roundoff/floating point error.

The system above should produce a Groebner basis with one polynomial, but it returns [1.00000000000000] instead. This is why nothing is coming back for x. Anyone know how to fix it?
