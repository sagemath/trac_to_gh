That doesn't seem likely to me.  I'm wondering if the error has to do with the variable in the symbolic expression coming from maxima being a different variable than what is requested in SR[var] (i.e., the "t"s in the TypeError are not the same object).  This is just a guess, though.

<div id="comment:13" align="right">Comment 13</div>

Yep, the problem is in this code in `PolynomialConverter` in `sage/symbolic/expression_conversions.py`:

```
        if ring is not None:
            G = map(repr, ring.gens())
            if any([repr(v) not in G for v in ex.variables()]):
                raise TypeError, "%s is not a variable of %s" %(v, ring)
            self.ring = ring
            self.base_ring = ring.base_ring()
```

Note that this does not allow for coefficients to have variables, but coefficients may have variables if the base ring is the symbolic ring!

Note that the error message in the last comment is misleading: it should say that "s is not a variable of ...", but since the test uses "any", it doesn't know which variable is bad.
