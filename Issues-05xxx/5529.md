Looks good, mostly.  I've made a few small changes and a few bigger ones.  The small changes: I changed "EXAMPLE::" to "EXAMPLES::" several times.  I changed "\mathbb{Z}" to "\mathbf{Z}" since this is the Sage style: try `latex(ZZ)`.  One line wasn't indented quite far enough, and I did a little minor rewording.

The more major changes: in the reference manual, methods which begin with an underscore don't appear.  For the most part, this doesn't bother me, but `__init__` methods often have important documentation, so for this file, I moved the docs for the `__init__` methods up a level to documentation for the class. This way it appears in the reference manual (as the first thing for the class) and also when you run sage and type `HillCryptosystem?`, for example.

I give mvngu's part of this a positive review, so only my patch needs reviewing.
