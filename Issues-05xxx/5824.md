DSage isn't actively maintained and not working too well. Since its coverage is basically zero (0.7%):

```
Overall weighted coverage score:  0.7%
Total number of functions:  515
We need  346 more function to get to 68% coverage.
We need  356 more function to get to 70% coverage.
We need  382 more function to get to 75% coverage.
```
Move it to its own spkg and provide hooks that make current code work. These hooks should be deprecated instantly. Hopefully someone can be found to maintain it and eventually improve it, otherwise we should look for some alternative rpc mechanism. 

To do the move one must also pay careful attention to the unit tests, -sdist, -bdist and setup.py.

Note the effect on coverage for 3.4.1.rc4:

Before:

```
Overall weighted coverage score:  68.2%
Total number of functions:  22947
We need  401 more function to get to 70% coverage.
We need 1549 more function to get to 75% coverage.
We need 2696 more function to get to 80% coverage.
```
After:

```
Overall weighted coverage score:  69.8%
Total number of functions:  22432
We need   45 more function to get to 70% coverage.
We need 1166 more function to get to 75% coverage.
We need 2288 more function to get to 80% coverage.
```

If we're deprecating dsage, I think we should remove its section from the tutorial.  (Remove the file 'distributed.rst' and delete the appropriate line from 'index.rst'.) I can provide a patch if you think it's a good idea.

I've never been convinced that it belonged there anyway, but that's another issue...

Michael did have one interesting point in chat, which is that if you do

```
rm -rf devel/sage/build
```
then dsage is gone too, so it has to be reinstalled.

Note that `sage -ba` does not do `rm -rf devel/sage/build`, but instead just touches all cython files.

Yes, I am wrong on that point.

I had assumed wrongly as above that the DSage code would end up in devel/sage which it clearly doesn't, so I am wrong again. 

What I do not like is subpackages installing into a tree in site-packages, i.e. the latest twisted does that with web2 I believe. 

The main question whether we do this or not is:

* Are we going to fix/rewrite DSage? In that case it should stay in the tree.
* If we are going to deprecate it we should move it to its own spkg and add deprecation warnings. The question then is what is going to happen after DSage and I don't think there is a clear answer to that question yet.

Cheers,

Michael
