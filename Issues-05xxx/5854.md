Yes, that needs to be fixed, too.

Good. Can you post an SPKG that has a clean .hg and .hgignore, i.e. just get rid of the old .hg and check the relevant bits back in again.

Hmmm, does rebuilding the spkg lead to "sage -b" rebuilding the extension? That does surprise me and I would be curious what this triggers.
