Yes, that needs to be fixed, too.

Good. Can you post an SPKG that has a clean .hg and .hgignore, i.e. just get rid of the old .hg and check the relevant bits back in again.

Hmmm, does rebuilding the spkg lead to "sage -b" rebuilding the extension? That does surprise me and I would be curious what this triggers.

Thanks.  It is not quite as easy as that, and one part of eclib will need to be rewritten to use this library, but it has all the ingredients which I needs so that is possible and would only take a day or too.

I checked that the spkg installs fine on 4.0.2 and the patch applies and tests pass.

There were some other issues raised by mabshoff, but as I am not an expert on spkgs I do not know if these are enough to stop the ticket from being merged.  So I am giving it a positive review.
