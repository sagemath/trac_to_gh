This ticket implements powering in `QQbar` and `AA` by `QQ` exponents as an action.

This will fix the following two bugs:

So what? I don't plan to change any arithmetic, just the underlying implementation. Since we have an operation between 2 different parents (`QQbar` and `QQ`), an action is the right way to implement this.

Why should there be such a requirement? I see an action purely as a technical way to implement a certain operation.

There are some cases like that already in Sage. I don't see the problem, but if you insist, then I will change it.

That would be a bad idea. Executable commands should be limited to the `EXAMPLES` block.

And if some software really wants to treat `EXAMPLES` blocks specially, it should still recognize <code>EXAMPLES in \`\`QQbar\`\`</code> as `EXAMPLES` block.

Anyway, if you really want me to change it, just say so.
