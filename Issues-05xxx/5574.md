This ticket implements powering in `QQbar` and `AA` by `QQ` exponents as an action.

This will fix the following two bugs:

From sage-support `@`freenode today:

```
<base3___> raising a matrix to a variable power fails with 
NotImplementedError: non-integral exponents not supported,
even if i do assume(n, 'integer')
<base3___> am i missing something or should i file this as a bug?
<burcin> base3___, it's a bug

So what? I don't plan to change any arithmetic, just the underlying implementation. Since we have an operation between 2 different parents (`QQbar` and `QQ`), an action is the right way to implement this.

Why should there be such a requirement? I see an action purely as a technical way to implement a certain operation.

That would be a bad idea. Executable commands should be limited to the `EXAMPLES` block.

And if some software really wants to treat `EXAMPLES` blocks specially, it should still recognize `EXAMPLES in ``QQbar``` as `EXAMPLES` block.

Anyway, if you really want me to change it, just say so.
