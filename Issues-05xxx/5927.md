Hmm, I am not so sure the patch does fix every problem:
Without the patch:

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Sage Version 4.0.rc0, Release Date: 2009-05-21                     |
| Type notebook() for the GUI, and license() for information.        |
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage: singular.eval("intvec G = 4,4,4,0,0,0;")
''
```
With the patch applied:

```
mabshoff@sage:/scratch/mabshoff/sage-4.0.rc1$ ./sage
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Sage Version 4.0.rc0, Release Date: 2009-05-21                     |
| Type notebook() for the GUI, and license() for information.        |
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage: singular.eval("intvec G = 4,4,4,0,0,0;")
'intvec G = 4,4,4,0,0,0;'
sage: 
```

If you look at the attached patch here it seems that we sometimes get the echo of the command and some times not. It might be consistent, i.e. the doctests pass on all platforms (I hope), but something still seems fishy.

I am not saying we shouldn't apply the patch since it fixes a much more severe bug, I just think that there is more to the story. Anyway, doctests do pass, so I will open a followup ticket and merge this patch.

Cheers,

Michael
