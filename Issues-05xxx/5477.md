From a Sage Days 14 user (see below).

In short, in the univariate over-a-field case, `R.quotient_ring(I)` should normalize the generator of the ideal before forming the quotient. 

```
In each case below "I" and "J" are defined by different choices of
generators and are recognized as the same ideal.  In case 1 the
quotients are considered equal and in case 2 they are considered
unequal.

(I checked this with the latest version)

Case 1:
----------

sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: I = R.ideal([x + x^2, x])
sage: J = R.ideal([2*x + 2*x^2, x])
sage: S = R.quotient_ring(I)
sage: U = R.quotient_ring(J)
sage: I==J
True
sage: S==U
True

Case 2:
----------

sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: I = R.ideal([x + x^2])
sage: J = R.ideal([2*x + 2*x^2])
sage: S = R.quotient_ring(I)
sage: U = R.quotient_ring(J)
sage: I==J
True
sage: S==U
False
```
