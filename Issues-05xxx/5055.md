```
About halfway through the documentation of interact, there is this example:

```
sage: @interact
... def _(title=["A Plot Demo", "Something silly", "something tricky" , a=input_box(sin(x*sin(x*sin(x))), 'function'),
...     clr = Color('red'), thickness=[1..30], zoom=(1,0.95,..,0.1), plot_points=(200..2000)):
...     html('<h1 align=center>%s</h1>'%title)
...     print plot_points
...     show(plot(a, -zoom*pi,zoom*pi, color=clr, thickness=thickness, plot_points=plot_points))
<html>...
```
There should be a ] after the " after the word tricky.

sage: interact?
```

And then it comes.  Also, just above that, there is something about an interact "campus", which sounds odd to me... Anyway, this is pretty valid.  Though trivial.  

According to search_src('tricky'), it is in server/notebook/interact.py

Weirdly, when I actually look at that file, I see both [].  So now the question is why doesn't this appear when I type

```
interact?
```
Instead, there is a space showing where the ] is in the actual file.  But that is probably not for a typo ticket, so if it's reproducible it should be a separate ticket.

Attached is a patch fixing the word "campus" to "canvas", though, which **is** a trivial typo in the interact documentation.
