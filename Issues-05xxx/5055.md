About halfway through the documentation of interact, there is this example:

```
sage: @interact
... def _(title=["A Plot Demo", "Something silly", "something tricky" , a=input_box(sin(x*sin(x*sin(x))), 'function'),
...     clr = Color('red'), thickness=[1..30], zoom=(1,0.95,..,0.1), plot_points=(200..2000)):
...     html('<h1 align=center>%s</h1>'%title)
...     print plot_points
...     show(plot(a, -zoom*pi,zoom*pi, color=clr, thickness=thickness, plot_points=plot_points))
<html>...
```
There should be a ] after the " after the word tricky.

And then it comes.  Also, just above that, there is something about an interact "campus", which sounds odd to me... Anyway, this is pretty valid.  Though trivial.  

According to search_src('tricky'), it is in server/notebook/interact.py

Weirdly, when I actually look at that file, I see both [].  So now the question is why doesn't this appear when I type

```
interact?
```
Instead, there is a space showing where the ] is in the actual file.  But that is probably not for a typo ticket, so if it's reproducible it should be a separate ticket.

Attached is a patch fixing the word "campus" to "canvas", though, which **is** a trivial typo in the interact documentation.
