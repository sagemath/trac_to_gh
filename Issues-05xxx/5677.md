When creating a function with a statement like

`f(x,y) = x<sup>2+y</sup>2`

the preparser creates a command to declare the variables and assigns it to underscore.  This renders the underscore unusable for repeating the previous output.

A workaround is to use  

`del _` 

to restore the functionality.

Keywords: **underscore repeat output**

Component: **user interface**

Is this still valid?  It looks more like `__tmp__` is used, not `_`, these days:


```
sage: preparse("f(x,y) = x^2+y^2")
'__tmp__=var("x,y"); f = symbolic_expression(x**Integer(2)+y**Integer(2)).function(x,y)'
sage: 5
5
sage: _
5
sage: f(x,y) = x^2+y^2
sage: _
5
sage: 7
7
sage: _
