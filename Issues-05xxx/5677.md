When creating a function with a statement like

`f(x,y) = x<sup>2+y</sup>2`

the preparser creates a command to declare the variables and assigns it to underscore.  This renders the underscore unusable for repeating the previous output.

A workaround is to use  

`del _` 

to restore the functionality.
