Consider:

```
sage: vector(ZZ, range(3)).apply_map(lambda x: x+1)
(1, 2, 3)
sage: vector(ZZ, range(3), sparse=True).apply_map(lambda x: x+1)
(0, 2, 3)
```

and

```
sage: matrix(ZZ, range(3)).apply_map(lambda x: x+1)
[1 2 3]
sage: matrix(ZZ, range(3), sparse=True).apply_map(lambda x: x+1)
[0 2 3]
```


Component: **linear algebra**

Attachment: **[trac5198_apply_map_sparse.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket5198/trac5198_apply_map_sparse.patch.gz)**

The attached patch fixes the problem, and adds a sparse=True/False argument to apply_map that may be useful if you know that the result will have a different sparsity than the input.

I also fixed a bug along the way: apply_map didn't preserve subdivisions for sparse matrices.  Sorry, reviewer, whoever you are.

Ouch...that is a pretty bad bug. 

The patch fixes the above issues and works well for me (including the subdivisions fix).
