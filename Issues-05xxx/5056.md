It seems like people get confused by the name and assume the function returns the reduced **Gr√∂bner** basis. Thus `reduced_basis()` should be deprecated and `interreduced_basis()` should take its place.

The patch applies cleanly (in spite of its strange name :) ), there is a deprecation warning, and the doc tests of `multi_polynomial_ideal.py` pass. In other words, the patch does what it is supposed to.
Positive review!
