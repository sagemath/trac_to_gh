The following code works:

```
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: f = x^2-1
sage: S = R.quotient_by_principal_ideal(f)
```
but then this fails:

```
sage: S

ValueError: variable names have not yet been set using self._assign_names(...)
```
The routine should require that the name(s) be provided.

Attachment [sage-5482.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket5482/sage-5482.patch) by justin created at 2009-03-11 07:42:22

The fix is to require the generator name at creation time, not when the ring is used.

Why do you change the parameter name from "names" to "name"?  Is this function only used for univariate polynomial rings?  If so, fine.

I discovered that while adding doctests.  I'll reverse that change.

Doctests?

I attached a new patch that assigns names automatically if they are not specified by the user, e.g. a quotient of `R.<x>` will have variable name `xbar`.  This is standard behaviour in other places in Sage.

Apply trac_5482.patch only.
