some functions are not wraped which makes e.g. identity_matrix or transpose awfully slow for matrices over SR.
(we do not use maxime.ident nor maxima.transpose)

This was fixed by converting symbolic matrices to use Sage's generic dense matrix backend:

```
sage: m = MatrixSpace(SR, 1000, 1000)
sage: %time a = m.identity_matrix()
CPU times: user 0.04 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.04 s
Wall time: 0.04 s
sage: %time b = a.transpose()
CPU times: user 0.05 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 0.06 s
Wall time: 0.06 s
```
