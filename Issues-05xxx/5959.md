From sage-devel, regarding whether 

```
Primes()>x^2+x
```
or not



> You should change the doctest to
> 
> sage: P != x^2 + x
> True
> 
> The comparison is completely arbitrary and will be machine specific.
> However equality or not is not arbitrary.

> 
> > sage: cmp(SR(3), x) in [-1,1]
> > True
