```
The code introduced in #4990 uses an incorrect precision bound in a paper of Enge.  Enge has supplied a corrected bound, and the code fixed to use it.  At the same time, 
* The code has been extended to non-fundamental discriminants
* It has been moved to sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/cm.py which had a similar function requiring Magma;  the method for number fields now calls this.
* The function elliptic_j has been added to sage/functions/special.py
* A new method is_primitive() has been added for integral binary quadratic forms, as well as a primitive_only flag to the function `BinaryQF_reduced_representatives`.
* Last but not least, sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/cm.py has been ReST-ified and added to the reference manual

This started out as just a conversion of one small file with only 3 functions in it to ReST!

All doctests pass. It works very well and is a sorely needed addition to sage.

One minor point: In the patch the paper of Enge calls for a constant of log(2*10.163) while the code has a typo which sets this constant to log(2*10.63). This makes no difference whatsoever in the output of the program(indeed there's no difference in the operation of the code for h<~24) but it's worth noting.
