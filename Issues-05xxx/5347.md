```
sage: K = GF(7)
sage: K(3).divides(1)
False
sage: K(3).divides(K(1))
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
ZeroDivisionError: reduction modulo right not defined.
```

This is because of this code added at http://hg.sagemath.org/sage-main/rev/0cb746e1a4bd

```
def divides(self, x):
    return (x % self) == 0
```
