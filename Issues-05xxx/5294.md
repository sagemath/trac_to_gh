I definitely think this is a good idea.

---

The intention of the attached patch is to help developers know what to do when they come across an unpickling error in the pickle_jar due to the automated test

```
sage -t structure/sage_object.pyx
```

What the patch actually does is:
* briefly explains what the purpose of the pickle_jar is
* embellishes the error message of unpickle_all() so that when it is run on the pickle_jar it says that pickles should not be removed from the pickle_jar and that unpickling errors can be fixed using register_unpickle_override
* expands on the documentation to register_unpickle_override() and, in particular, adds two examples to the show how to use register_unpickle_override to fix unpickling issues
* adds two sections to the developers manual: the first is a brief account of the pickle_jar in the sage coding conventions section and the section is a brief note about unpickling cycthon code in the cython section.

Note that the documentation changes affect both the developers guide and the reference manual.

<a id='comment:2'></a>Currently one doc test fails, but I don't think that this is an issue with the patch. This seems to have nothing to do with the patch but, rather, is a consequence of the following which looks like a bug to me:

```
sage: from sage.structure.sage_object import unpickle_all
sage: %timeit unpickle_all()
/usr/local/src/sage/sage-5.3/local/lib/python/timeit.py:195: DeprecationWarning: This class is replaced by Matrix_modn_dense_float/Matrix_modn_dense_double.
See http://trac.sagemath.org/4260 for details.
  timing = self.inner(it, self.timer)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGABRT: An abort() occurred in Sage.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* component of Sage has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off(). You might
want to run Sage under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
Sage will now terminate.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
/usr/local/src/sage/sage-5.3/spkg/bin/sage: line 335: 73974 Abort trap: 6           sage-ipython "$@" -i
```
Can anyone confirm whether this is a bug or known issue? Either way, is there a way around this? 

Alternatively I could just remove this doc test from unpickle_all() as it is now referred to in the section in the developers guide.

<a id='comment:10'></a>A very valuable addition to the documentation!

I think I found two minor issues though:

* In the excerpt from the python docs about `object.__setstate__(state)` you lost some underscores (it should say `__setstate__` and not `setstate__`.)
* You should probably remove the trailing whitespace in the `__reduce__` function that the patchbot complains about

Btw., the patchbot coverage plugin complains that you added one method without a doctest. But this is actually just, the `__reduce___` method in the docstring.

I don't have the time to look at the html version of the documentation now, I'll do that soon, write a review patch with the above two points, and set it to positive review.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGABRT: An abort() occurred in Sage.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* component of Sage has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off(). You might
want to run Sage under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
Sage will now terminate.

Thanks for the explanation. Does that mean that the problem with this patch is fixed or should it depend on, and need to be rebased over, #13899?

<a id='comment:28'></a>I have tested the patch against 5.6.rc1 and the tests pass. For some reason the patchbot isn't checking the ticket, possibly because it's flagged as needing work? I am going to put it back to a positive review in the hope that the patchbot confirms my tests before Jeronen looks at it.
