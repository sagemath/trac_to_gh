The following seems absurd:

```
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: I = (x^2-1)*R
sage: S = R.quotient_by_principal_ideal(I)

Either the procedure should be ...by_polynomial(), or it should really accept an ideal as an argument.

Sheesh.

Justin,

any chance you can add some doctests here? I am marking this as "needs works" until then.
