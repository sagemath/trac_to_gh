The docstring for graphs.RandomRegular says

```
Returns a random d-regular graph on n vertices, or returns False on
failure.
```

However, try calling it a few times with input 3,10 and with probability about 25% you'll get back an empty graph!:

```
sage: graphs.RandomRegular(3,10)
Graph on 0 vertices

sage: [len(graphs.RandomRegular(3,10)) for _ in range(1000)].count(0)
232
```

This is a bug in NetworkX. Their docstring says:

```
Definition:     networkx.random_regular_graph(d, n, seed=None)
Source:
def random_regular_graph(d, n, seed=None):
    """Return a random regular graph of n nodes each with degree d, G_{n,d}.
    Return False if unsuccessful.
