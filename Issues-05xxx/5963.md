Alex reports: 

I can't get this to segfault. I tried on sage.math and on my laptop (macbook running 32-bit archlinux). The problem is that the two machines get different answers after a while (I hope the table is clear -- the last column is a function that's "known" to be a good approximation to prime_pi):

```
x     prime_pi(x) on sage.math     prime_pi(x) on my laptop     Li(x)-Li(sqrt(x))/2
2^46   2280998753949                2280998753949               2.28099863535e+12
2^47   4461632979717                4454203917918               4.46163280359e+12
2^48   8731188863470                8612800813048               8.73118897751e+12
2^49  17094432576778               15793194017311               1.70944327138e+13

```
So it seems that the problem starts somewhere between `2^46` and `2^47`, and that the sage.math output is most likely correct.

Cool.

At least for MMA 6.0 on linux x86-64 the limit seems to be around
2^47:

         MMA        Sage

2^44:   18.04      110.88   (597116381732)
2^45:   29.98      207.61   (1166746786182)
2^46:   47.59      389.98   (2280998753949)
2^47:   89.25      728.84   (4461632979717)
2^48:   NA :)      about an hour - correct?

According to Alex's numbers at least on his laptop 2^46 was correct on
32 bits, but given the length of the test (~6 minutes on sage.math
this isn't really doctestable).

Yep, the old implementation was about 1000 times slower than Andrew's
which is about 5 times slower than MMA 6.0 - so great job from
catching us up from 5000 times to only 5 times :).

Well, what should we pick as upper bound? 2^40 seems to be what Andrew
suggests, but maybe 2^42 or 2^43? In that range we can actually add
#long doctests and I would be much more comfortable that we would at
least catch potential issues.

The attached patch caps the allowed input to `2^40` for now and adds a long doctest to verify the correct value of all n in (30..40) for prime_pi(2**n). The upper allowable limit should be reviewed post Sage 3.4.2.
