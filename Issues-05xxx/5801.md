While looking around for something else I noticed test.txt and todo.txt. Both are surprisingly related to notebook development. Both files should be looked at and dealt with since they do not belong inside the tree. 

* test.txt can probably be removed since we have a webtesting framework written by Mike Hansen
* todo.txt should be looked over and the issues in there that aren't in trac yet should have tickets opened. Then the file should be removed.

Cheers,

Michael
