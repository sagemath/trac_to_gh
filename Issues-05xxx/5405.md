The typical usage of this decorator would be to be applied above a
:obj:`cached_method` or :obj:`cached_function` decorator so that
the correct cached object is returned.

Hi Mike!

I am not so sure about the name, although I can't propose much better than
default_values, or set_default_values.

Could it be generalized to handle both positional and non positional arguments?

I'd suggest to have the doc by starting with what the thing actually does, followed by the typical usage.
Speaking of which: could you add an example of this typical usage? (it was not clear to me).

I prefer partial, since curry does not really encompass the specialization of named arguments.
It's really functools.partial, but made into a decorator.

Fair enough -- but just to clarify, `functools.partial` *is* a decorator, just that it doesn't update the documentation string.
