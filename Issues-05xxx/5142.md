It seems to me that if mat is a sparse integer matrix, then

```
mat.dense_matrix().elementary_divisors()
```
is much faster than 

```
mat.elementary_divisors()
```
Is this correct?  I've checked this on certain families of matrices, but probably not extensively enough.

If so, we should change how elementary divisors for sparse integer matrices are computed.  I've patched this, pretty naively, by sticking a new method in matrix_integer_sparse.pyx which just contains the above code.  I would appreciate any comments or corrections.

This is a simple patch, but may raise complicated issues:

It is rather makeshift, though.  The *right* thing to do is to rewrite the sparse matrix code so that it works and is faster (and also less buggy -- see #5099, for instance).

This patch would be a temporary fix.  Is it a good idea to include this now, with the idea to fix it the right way later?  Or is it better to leave less than ideal code there now, first as an encouragement to fix it, and second so that we don't leave a patch like this in as a longterm solution?

The patch looks good; I have three complaints regarding the docstring:

* in the description of the algorithm 'pari', you presumably mean "works robustly", since "works robustless" doesn't mean anything
* this is a one-line method, and it is pretty self-explanatory, so I don't think it needs a description of the implementation in the docstring
* the OUTPUT description claims that the method returns a list of int's; this is not true, since the output is a list of Integer's

I'll very happily give this a positive review once these issues are resolved.  This patch is a good idea and, as John points out, similar things should be done for other methods for sparse matrices (determinant is another example).  For the record, trying

```
sage: A = random_matrix(ZZ, 100, 100, sparse=True)
sage: time e = A.elementary_divisors()
```

simply fails with a mysterious TypeError in the current code, whereas with the patch applied it works in 1.44 seconds.
