There are a lot of design issues which concern combinatorial classes. They are currently discussed on the mailing list and on the wiki. See

Someones has to lead/moderate these discussions, to summarize the result and to incorporate it into sage doc. After this we should emit a bunch of tickets to update the various combinatorial classes to this design.
