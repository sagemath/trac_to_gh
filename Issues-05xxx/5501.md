The following explodes in sage 3.4:

```

Furthermore, it dumps the contents of dumps(s) to the console, which I'm told is a no-no because when one uses ~20kbits of precision with 24 processes via `@`parallel, the error messages are ridiculously huge.

On a personal note, I'd prefer if my CAS didn't stick its fingers in its ears and chant "lalalala..." whenever it doesn't like what I'm doing.  This is *not* how a mature system should behave.

<a id='comment:2'>Comment 2:</a>
This is presumably due to these lines from mpfi_set_str, in mpfi_io.c (in the MPFI library):

```
  char tmp[1000];

  /* bzero(tmp,1000); */
  memset(tmp,0,1000);

  slen= (int)strlen(s);
  if(slen >=1000) return -1;
```

As a workaround, instead of passing the `RealIntervalFieldElement` x, you could pass (x.parent(), x.lower(), x.upper()); then on the other side, given (parent, lower, upper), reconstruct the original element with parent(lower,upper).
