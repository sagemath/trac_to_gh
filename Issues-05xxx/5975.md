For a graph  g  the command latex(g)  has not been implemented.  The tkz-graph package provides latex commands for drawing graphs in a variety of ways.  So rather than outputting a graphic image, this command would output latex commands that could be incorporated into latex documents.

latex-test-1.patch is just that, a test.  Code by Fidel Barrera-Cruz, which I've got working in this patch.  Strictly experimental for discussion purposes.  The session

```
g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
latex(g)
```

produces

```

\SetVertexNoLabel
\SetVertexMath   

\Vertex[x=2.5cm,y=4.7553cm]{a0}

This new test version supports colors in vertices, labels and vertices. One can also choose among the different styles offered by tkz-graph, 'Art', 'Shade', 'Welsh', 'Classic', etc. A sample session:

```
G=graphs.PetersenGraph()
latex(G)
```
This should give:

Created a new `GraphLatex` object to hold and manipulate options for customizing the latex output of a graph (which was not implemented before).

To test

1.  Make sure your TeX installation has the tkz-graph and tkz-berge packages along with an up-to-date pgf package.

2.  For a graph `g`, `latex(g)` will build a string you can cut/paste into a document.

3.  At the sage command line, `view(g, pdflatex=True)` will create and display a PDF.


The purpose of this patch is to get the infrastructure working, so only one option is implemented.  A wider range of options should follow in a subsequent patch.  Also, see #6089 for details about making this fit into the broader Sage-LaTeX integration.

Apply only the `trac_5975_graph_latex.patch`.  Joint work of Rob Beezer and Fidel Barrera, with assistance from Emily Kirkman.

From a high-level review:

This is fantastic and very, very cool!  rbeezer says he is going to make another pass through things (so I'm changing it to needs work).  After installing the tkz-berge.sty and tkz-graph.sty files into my local tex installation, I could do:

```
sage: G=graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: view(G, pdflatex=True)
```

and the tikz graph popped up.  This will be really cool when combined with sagetex.

When I just did `view(G)`, a dvi popped up, which did not contain the graph.

I am posting a small referee patch touching the docs on a function or two.

Replying to [jhpalmieri](#comment%3A18):

Some answers.

1.  Even if the right tkz-graph packages are not present on a system, then I'd still like the user to be able to get out a proper string.  I often use Sage as a sort of Latex assistant - build an object `obj` and run `latex(obj)` and cut/paste the string into a document.  So a warning should be useful, but an error would be too severe I feel.  You ought to be able to get legitimate Latex snippets from Sage, even if you have no tex on your system.  But if you are asking for a rendering in `view()` or the notebook, then errors and warnings are in order.

2.  Yes, I think the documentation is out-of-sync with the above, since I pulled some warnings at the last minute.  I'll fix that.

3.  The code snippet 
>

``` 
sage: g = graphs.CompleteBipartiteGraph(1,3)
sage: g.latex_options(tkz_style = 'Art')  
```

should have no immediate ovious effect or output.  But `latex(g)` should differ if run before and after these commands - afterwards it should have the tkz-graph commands to use the pre-built "Art" style, rather than the default "Normal" style.

4.
> In the following, the nodes are overlapping, and it doesn't look good.  It looks like there is room to space them out more:


```
sage: g = graphs.CompleteBipartiteGraph(1,15)
sage: view(g)
```

Eventually the user will have control over vertex sizes, bounding boxes, and vertex locations.  The intent of this patch is to get the infrastructure right for changing options, then many, more localized changes, will open up more control.  So I think this can slide for now, but this sort of control should be first on the list of changes.



5.

Great suggestions.  I'll spruce up the documentation when its not so late in the evening sometime tomorrow night and get up a patch with that, plus other suggestions.

Thanks,

Hi John,

1.  The initialization of a `GenericGraph` has the necessary `\usepackage` as you included in your patch and I added the jsmath-avoidance string based on the `tikzpicture` latex environment.  This only happens if the right packages are actually installed, so a user's preamble won't get fouled with missing packages.

2.  After several approaches, I finally created a `check_tkz_graph` method.  This acts as a one-time check and warning on a user's environment.  It is called from the routine that actually builds the latex string (`tkz_picture`).  So if a user never tries to render a graph, they never hear about it.  And when they do try, they get a one-time warning if the packages are missing.  This makes doctesting easier - before testing a latex string, we call `check_tkz_graph` as a "random" doctest and possibly warnings are emitted, but are ignored.  Then we actually build the string and it will be free of error messages for comparison to the expected output.  Consequently, `have_tkz_graph` no longer emits messages, just reports the presence of the packages.  This scheme should scale to other packages that might be employed to draw graphs.

3.  `have_tkz_graph` is now a module level function, as it should be, alongside the new `check_tkz_graph`.

4.  I didn't study your original question very carefully about `GenericGraph.latex_options()`.  No, it wasn't really designed to accept options, but the `kwds` argument was needed to make the `@`options decorator work.  I wasn't very happy with `@`options, since it appeared twice, requiring two (identical) edits to keep the defaults in sync.  So, I've removed the decorators and now default options are set in the `GraphLatex` initialization where they need only be edited once.  And so `latex_options()` will no longer accept any arguments.

5.  Documentation:
    (a)  "Visualization" section for graphs has a short blurb and points to the `sage.graphs.graph_latex` module for details.

    (b)  Module level documentation in sage.graphs.graph_latex is meant to be a fairly comprehensive introduction.  I was asked not to pile too much stuff into `sage/graphs/graph.py` since it is so big already, which mostly explains why I've put it here.

    (c)  Authoritative documentation for the actual options is being kept in the docstring for `GraphLatex.set_option()`, which is were options actually get set.  We only have one option right now, but there will be more.  Necessarily some of these will need to refer to the approximately 100-page manual for tkz-graph.

    (d)  I've added pointers to the module documentation from the `plot()` and `plot3d()` methods for graphs.


Delta patch should help you *see* where latest changes are - it begins after your reviewer patch to my version 3.  I wouldn't trust this delta patch as something to apply on an old branch, please do any testing based on the self-contained version 4, which needs to be applied on top of #6089.

Hi John,

Thanks for the quick review and the improvements.  Fixes in reviewer patch are very welcome.

I've given a lot of thought about how best to react to "missing" parts of a user's environment.  As you've seen, it makes doctesting difficult.  So at the moment, I'm content with the one-time warning and whatever goes boom after that.  ;-)   It did make it easier in my mind to separate a check/warning from an existence test, even though they are very similar.

Two things I did think about though.  `\typeout` in TeX will insert text into the log and/or at the console.  So a message just before a potential problem could happen this way.  Another approach would be to put some TeX comments right before a potential problem.  These might locate information close to where folks might investigate, especially in a %latex_debug cell.  But hopefully thorough documentation and a warning will get folks on track.  I'll add some more protections if they come to me, but I'm ready to cut this one loose.

Minh:  ping me if there isn't a graphic example here for the release tour.  ;-)

Release manager: Apply #6089, revision 4 patch, then latest reviewer patch.  Thanks.

Can I make one small suggestion?

This line:

```
check_tkz_graph()  # random - depends on TeX installation 
```
ought to be

```
check_tkz_graph()  # optional - depends on the TeX installation containing <whatever tex files you need>
```

We really don't like #random doctests if we can help it, and this doctest is really testing the existence of an optional program.  I guess one argument against this is that it is not testing the installation of an optional spkg.

Since we have at least one other spkg installing .sty files (sagetex), maybe (in a different ticket) we could have a small spkg that installs the needed .sty files for this into the sage local tex tree.

Hi Jason,

The purpose of the line in question is not really a doctest of the existence of the packages.

The function `check_tkz_graph()` will emit a warning *once* per session, if needed, and then be silent.  In order to doctest the latex output, I need to be sure that the warning doesn't get mixed in.  So I call this function in the doctest, which *may* produce a warning.  Then the latex output will be "pure."

So I need to be certain this line runs, and I don't want to test its (variable) output.  If it is tagged "optional" will it always be run in testing, no matter what?

In any event, if there is a change here, I'll make it as part of some other revision, so I don't want this to hold up getting this merged.

Rob

ah, good point.  If it's tagged optional, it won't always run.

I retract my comment.

The right way to do something like this is to disable the warnings for that module before the doctest.  But that's probably the subject of another ticket, as I don't have time to make the patch now, and I'd rather not hold this up any more.

Minh,

For the release tour.

See PNG screenshot of PDF output.  Complete code required to get the PDF:

```
g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
g.set_latex_options(tkz_style='Art')
view(g, pdflatex=True)
```

Mostly this patch puts in place the infrastructure to make many of the features of the the tkz-graph latex package available.  Only one option (tkz_style) is actually implemented at the moment - more will follow.
