You don't need the first two lines below in __cmp__ anymore.

```
        if isinstance(right, Primes_class):
            return 0
        return cmp(type(self), type(right))
```

Otherwise, it's a positive review.

This is a weird test. I'm not even sure that it says anything meaningful. In fact, according to the documentation of __cmp__ for Set, it doesn't:

```
        \note{If $X < Y$ is true this does \emph{not} necessarily mean
        that $X$ is a subset of $Y$.  Also, any two sets can be
        compared, which is a general Python philosophy.}
