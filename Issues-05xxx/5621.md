The patch `trac_5621-doctests-calculus.patch` adds doctests to 6 functions/methods in `sage/calculus/calculus.py`, raising the coverage of that module by 1% to 52%. Interestingly, with the command

```
sage -coverage
```
Sage doesn't pick up doctests for functions/methods where there's a blank line between the docstring and the function/method. For example, as it now stands with Sage 3.4, the function `desolve_system_strings()` in the module `sage/calculus/desolvers.py` has doctests but Sage doesn't pick that up. Doing a doctest coverage on Sage 3.4 shows that the coverage for `sage/calculus/desolvers.py` is at 75%.

Given the pynac transformation I don't think it is a good idea to merge this now. calculus.py will be more or less gone before the end of the week anyway :).

Thoughts?
