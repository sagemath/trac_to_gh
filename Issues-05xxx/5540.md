From [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/t/2da54338e1dda0fe):

```
If I do search_doc("orbit") in sage 3.4 (in the notebook), I get
(amongst others) a link:

https://localhost:8000/doc/live/html/en/reference/genindex-F.html

which leads to a "resource cannot be found". The appropriate link
seems to be

https://localhost:8000/doc/live/reference/genindex-F.html

It could be that my sage is just screwed up, but if someone else can
confirm this error, a ticket should be opened. I bet it's easy to fix.}}}

**Attachment:** [5540.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket5540/5540.patch.gz)

Patch solves the problem for me. The patch is also tiny, so while I'm not familiar with the code, I wouldn't expect it to cause any regressions.
