cwitty, this wasn't quite ready -- but thanks for your diligence!  The new patch makes this method default for dimension 4, and removes the algorithm='4x4' option.  Also, I put the code used to generate this code into the matrix_integer_dense.pyx file.  Finally, the _det_4x4 method has been changed to _det_4x4_unsafe.

Timings:

```
Sage 3.4:
    sage: S = MatrixSpace(ZZ,4)
    sage: M = S.random_element(1,10000^200)
    sage: timeit("M.determinant()")
    5 loops, best of 3: 1.75 s per loop
Updated...
    sage: S = MatrixSpace(ZZ,4)
    sage: M = S.random_element(1,10000^200)
    sage: timeit("M.determinant()")
    625 loops, best of 3: 175 µs per loop
Using Pari:
    sage: N = pari(M)
    sage: timeit("N.matdet();")
    625 loops, best of 3: 337 µs per loop
```

So in general, this is hugely faster than the previous version of Sage, and twice as fast as Pari.

Hi Tom. Is it possible for you to give some system/architecture info of the machine from which you got the above timing statistics? Such info plus timing statistics are good for a release tour.

How fast is it on smaller input?  Using PARI more efficiently I was able to get the following timings (in my branch of Sage):

```
sage: M = S.random_element(1,10^8)
sage: timeit('M.det();M._clear_cache()')
625 loops, best of 3: 14.9 µs per loop
sage: M = S.random_element(1,10^10)
sage: timeit('M.det();M._clear_cache()')
625 loops, best of 3: 16.3 µs per loop
``` 

Things slow down for bigger input though:

```
sage: M = S.random_element(1,10^200)
sage: timeit('M.det();M._clear_cache()')
625 loops, best of 3: 104 µs per loop
sage: M = S.random_element(1,10^300)
sage: timeit('M.det();M._clear_cache()')
625 loops, best of 3: 186 µs per loop
sage: M = S.random_element(1,10^1000)
sage: timeit('M.det();M._clear_cache()')
625 loops, best of 3: 1.2 ms per loop
```

The above is on OS X 32-bit core2duo 2.6Ghz.

It will definitely only cut "a few millis".

But I guess I'm OK with this code going in.
