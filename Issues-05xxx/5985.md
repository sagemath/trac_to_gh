```
Original implementation:

The first patch imports the vanilla cPickle.c and test_cpickle.py
from python 2.5.2.p9 as sage.misc.cPickle, and updates accordingly the
cPickle imports throughout the sage library.

The second patch makes a very small modification to cPickle to allow
for customizing how class are pickled via metaclasses.

Final implementation: adds the second patch to the python spkg

Oops, this testsuite used type.__new__(...) which apparently does not work anymore with Python 2.6. I just rewrote the testsuite so that it does not use this feature anymore. See attached patch.

Luckily enough, the real applications of this patch readily did not use this feature anymore!

I'm uploading a new python spkg, which is the same as the previous one I posted, but based on the most recent python spkg in Sage. It's here:

  http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/craigcitro/python-2.6.2.p4.spkg

This fixes the issue by patching the files in our python spkg instead of importing and using our own copy of `cPickle`. It also makes the corresponding changes to `pickle`.

Sounds good to me! Positive review, up to someone double checking the new patch I attached which imports the test file from the original version of the patch.

Carl, Craig, Robert, please do it soon! William is ok integrating this in 4.1.2 (see IRC).
I set back the release to 4.1.2

For the author / reviewer, I don't know exactly what to do since I wrote the first version, Craig reviewed it, wrote the second version which I reviewed :-) Please set whatever you feel appropriate
