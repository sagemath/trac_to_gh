<a id='comment:4'></a>Good work!

Do the doctests pass for the invert function?  If so, I'm surprised; I thought that the doctest output would have to include the deprecation statement.

Regardless, the documentation for the invert function should include a sentence about the deprecation too.

Positive review (based on rbeezer's positive review) pending the changes to documentation and possibly doctests mentioned above.

I'd have assumed the same.  But doctests on the one source file passed, and  `sage -testall` only gave spurious unrelated errors in one file, and I'd seen those recently, so they should be unrelated.
