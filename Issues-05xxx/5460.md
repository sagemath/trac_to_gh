As far as I can tell, the deprecation function produces a warning message the first time you use the deprecated code, but not after that.  If you restart Sage and try the nonsingular matrix, you should get a warning for that one, too.

Right.  I tested it twice, with a restart inbetween, but both times in the same order.  ;-)

Good work!

Do the doctests pass for the invert function?  If so, I'm surprised; I thought that the doctest output would have to include the deprecation statement.

Regardless, the documentation for the invert function should include a sentence about the deprecation too.

Positive review (based on rbeezer's positive review) pending the changes to documentation and possibly doctests mentioned above.
