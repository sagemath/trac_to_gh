As far as I can tell, the deprecation function produces a warning message the first time you use the deprecated code, but not after that.  If you restart Sage and try the nonsingular matrix, you should get a warning for that one, too.

Right.  I tested it twice, with a restart inbetween, but both times in the same order.  ;-)

Good work!

Do the doctests pass for the invert function?  If so, I'm surprised; I thought that the doctest output would have to include the deprecation statement.

Regardless, the documentation for the invert function should include a sentence about the deprecation too.

Positive review (based on rbeezer's positive review) pending the changes to documentation and possibly doctests mentioned above.

I'd have assumed the same.  But doctests on the one source file passed, and  `sage -testall` only gave spurious unrelated errors in one file, and I'd seen those recently, so they should be unrelated.
