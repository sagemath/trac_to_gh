For the attached list, `Ideal(gb).basis_is_groebner()` returns `True` but the basis is not a Gr√∂bner basis!

The code in question:

```
    def basis_is_groebner(self, singular=singular_default):
        self.ring()._singular_().set_ring()

        F = singular( self.gens(), "module" )
        LTF = singular( [f.lt() for f in self.gens()] , "module" )

        M = (F * LTF.syz()).reduce(self._singular_())

        for i in range(M.nrows()):
            if int(singular.eval("%s[1][%s+1]!=0"%(M.name(),i))):
                return False

        self._singular_().attrib('isSB',1)
        return True
```

There were two subtle bugs.
* The first was that `M` only had one row. Thus, `i` would check only the first element of `M`. Hence unpredictable behavior: sometimes the correct answer, sometimes not.
* The second was that Singular (for whatever reason) expects the arrays to be indexed by `[row,col]` and not by `[row][col]`.

The attached patch fixes the issue for me. I've added a second patch which documents that the bug is indeed fixed. mabshoff, this patch should definitely go in for 3.3 because right now Sage gives wrong answers!
