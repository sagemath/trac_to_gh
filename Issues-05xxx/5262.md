# Issue 5262: [with positive review] L-series attached to modular forms has a major bug in how it computes the sign of the functional equation

```
This is wrong:

```

The following computation should produce identical values in the last
line:

E=EllipticCurve('37b2')
h=E.modular_form()
Lh = h.cuspform_lseries()
LE=E.lseries()
h.elliptic_curve()==E, Lh(1), LE(1)

The output is:

(True, 0, 0.725681061936153)
```

This is because the Atkin-Lehner sign is computed wrong in sage/modular/modform/element.py.  In fact, there one finds the code:

```
            m = ModularSymbols(N,l,sign=1)
            n = m.cuspidal_subspace().new_subspace()
            e = (-1)**(l/2)*n.atkin_lehner_operator().matrix()[0,0]
```

Notice that m has absolutely nothing to do with the modular form! 

The right fix is to implement an atkin_lehner_eigenvalue(...) function for modularforms, and that should in turn be implemented correctly, and should be called from the cuspform_lseries command.

I already opened #5247 for this as I mentioned in the email, but I am closing that one as a dupe since this ticket has the better description.

This is not a ReST ticket, so bumping it to 3.4.1.

Cheers,

Michael

Turns out there were actually two separate bugs: one for level 1 forms (which came up whenever the weight was not a multiple of 4) and one for forms of higher level. I've fixed both, and added doctests to check that they're fixed.
