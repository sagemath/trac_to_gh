This is strange: it matters how many variables are specified.  This fails and I think this is a bug:

```
sage: R.<u> = PolynomialRing(RDF, 1, 'u')
sage: v1 = vector([u])
sage: v2 = vector([CDF(2)])
sage: v1 * v2
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

/home/ncalexan/sage-3.4.rc0-sage.math-only-x86_64-Linux/devel/sage/sage/functions/riemann_theta.py in <module>()

/home/ncalexan/sage-3.4.rc0-sage.math-only-x86_64-Linux/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/sage/structure/element.so in sage.structure.el\
ement.Vector.__mul__ (sage/structure/element.c:10435)()

/home/ncalexan/sage-3.4.rc0-sage.math-only-x86_64-Linux/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/sage/structure/coerce.so in sage.structure.coe\
rce.CoercionModel_cache_maps.bin_op (sage/structure/coerce.c:5847)()

TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for '*': 'Ambient free module of rank 1 over the integral domain Multivariate Polynomial Ring i\
n u over Real Double Field' and 'Vector space of dimension 1 over Complex Double Field'
```

But both of these succeed:

```
sage: R.<u, v> = RDF[]
sage: v1 = vector([u])
sage: v2 = vector([CDF(2)])
sage: v1 * v2
2.0*u
```

```
sage: R.<u> = RDF[]
sage: v1 = vector([u])
sage: v2 = vector([CDF(2)])
sage: v1 * v2
2.0*u
```

I've attached a patch that adds a doctest that makes sure this keeps working.

The patch also removes plenty of trailing whitespace in the affected file. I got this for free by putting 

```
(add-hook 'before-save-hook 'delete-trailing-whitespace)
```
into my "`.emacs.rc`".

But maybe it might have been better to just give the "wontfix" a positive review instead...

Hey,

For doctest formatting, I would change:

```
    sage: # check that #5562 has been fixed
    sage: R.<u> = PolynomialRing(RDF, 1, 'u')
...
```
to

```
Check that :trac:`5562` has been fixed::

    sage: R.<u> = PolynomialRing(RDF, 1, 'u')
...
```

I think the trailing whitespace removal should be okay...

Best,

Travis

Hi Travis,

I agree, in theory, that the doctest should be reformatted. However, I don't know how to do this because the patch has apparently already been merged in 5.7.beta1. Would I create a new patch based on beta1, or edit the old one?

Cheers,

Indeed, my working copy had been garbled, presumably by running "hg import" earlier when I meant "hg qimport" which made me believe that this ticket had somehow magically be merged already... anyway, glad we got rid of this now ;-)
