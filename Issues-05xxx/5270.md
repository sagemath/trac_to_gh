The patch implements plot() methods for affine and projective algebraic curves.  In the affine case it simply calls the plot() method of the defining ideal of the curve.  In the projective case it calls the plot() method of an affine patch of the curve.

This is mostly a usability enhancement.  I ran into a few bugs while working on this, so the patch should be applied only after #5267 and #5269 get merged.

Looks great -- I think this ability to plot the idfferent affine patches of a projective curve is a very nice feature.

Patch applies fine to 3.3.rc0.  I had doctest problems in projective_curve.py:
