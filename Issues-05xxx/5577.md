This is a repeat of #4379, changing one word in the tutorial: the change there was undone, perhaps in the ReST conversion, and this reinstates it.

REFEREE REPORT



The patch **tut-typo.patch** applies against Sage 3.4, but with some fuzz:

```
sage: hg_sage.apply("/home/mvngu/patch/5577/tut-typo.patch")
cd "/home/mvngu/scratch/sage-3.4/devel/sage" && hg status
cd "/home/mvngu/scratch/sage-3.4/devel/sage" && hg status
cd "/home/mvngu/scratch/sage-3.4/devel/sage" && hg import   "/home/mvngu/patch/5577/tut-typo.patch"
applying /home/mvngu/patch/5577/tut-typo.patch
patching file doc/en/tutorial/tour_help.rst
Hunk #1 succeeded at 120 with fuzz 1 (offset -1 lines).
```
That didn't prevent me from (re)building the tutorial in HTML format. Viewing the updated section "Getting Help" in the tutorial, I see that the patch fixes the problem it meant to fix. I don't know how significant the above fuzz is, but probably it doesn't matter at all, in which case I'd give a positive review to the patch.

Looks good, positive review. So here's the order in which patches should be applied:
1. First apply patches at #5500.
2. Then apply **tut-typo.patch**.
This ordering should prevent any fuzz.
