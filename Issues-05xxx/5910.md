This is a followup to #545. As discussed at #545, the module `boolopt.py` is moved to this enhancement ticket. So basically, #545 no longer requires boolopt.py to reach 100% doctest coverage in order to be merged into Sage. Thus the only work needed to be done here is to bring coverage of boolopt.py to 100%.
