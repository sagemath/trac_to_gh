REFEREE REPORT:



The following lines result in something weird when viewing the HTML version of the reference manual:

```
486	class QuaternionAlgebra_ab(QuaternionAlgebra_abstract): 
487	    """ 
488	    The quaternion algebra of the form `(a, b/K)`, where `i^2=a`, `j^2 = b`, 
489	    and `j*i = -i*j`.  ``K`` is a field not of characteristic 2 and ``a``, 
490	    ``b`` are nonzero elements of ``K``. 
491	 
492	    EXAMPLES:: 
493	 
494	    """ 
495	    def __init__(self, base_ring, a, b, names='i,j,k'):
```
See the [HTML version](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mvngu/reference/sage/algebras/quatalg/quaternion_algebra.html#sage.algebras.quatalg.quaternion_algebra.QuaternionAlgebra_ab) I've generated after applying the rebased patch. I think the problem is that there's a "EXAMPLES::" tag, which is not followed by any examples at all. Now by alphabetic order, the method `sage.algebras.quatalg.quaternion_algebra.QuaternionAlgebra_ab.QuaternionAlgebra_ab.discriminant()` is thus formatted in a weird way as

```
.. method:: QuaternionAlgebra_ab.discriminant()
```
in the HTML version.



How about some documentation for 

```
627	    def gen(self, i=0):
```
to explain what it does. At the moment, there are examples, but no explanation of what this method is supposed to do.



I think the maths expression in the following lines are typeset in a weird way:

```
1069	    def discriminant(self): 
1070	        r""" 
1071	        Return the discriminant of this order, which we define as 
1046	 	        $\sqrt( det ( Tr(e_i \bar(e_j) ) ) )$, where $\{e_i\}$ is the 
1072	        `\sqrt( det ( Tr(e_i \bar(e_j) ) ) )`, where `\{e_i\}` is the 
1073
```
See the [HTML version](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mvngu/reference/sage/algebras/quatalg/quaternion_algebra.html#sage.algebras.quatalg.quaternion_algebra.QuaternionOrder.discriminant) of the reference manual for a visual.



The maths expression in these lines

```
1481	        The normalized theta series is by definition 
1442	1482	 
1443	1483	        .. math: 
1444	1484	 
1445	 	        \theta_I(q)=\sum_{x \in I} q^{\frac{N(x)}{N(I)}} 
1446	 	         
 	1485	            \theta_I(q)=\sum_{x \in I} q^{\frac{N(x)}{N(I)}}
```
