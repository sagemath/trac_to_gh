"Positive Review" because I just read the patch online on trac and it is definitely an enhancement over the old documentation.

"Minus epsilon" because I actually didn't download and test the patch (whether it applies to Sage-3.4.2, whether the documentation still builds, and such).

There is still room for improvement, e.g. display sample contents of the ".hgignore" file --- this file has to contain necessarily "src" as an exception.

I'm changing this from "positive review minus epsilon" to "needs review" so that it still appears in the list of tickets needing review.  If someone is willing to confirm that the patch applies and that the documentation builds correctly (with `sage -docbuild developer FORMAT`, with FORMAT being "html", "pdf", etc.) then I think it can get a full positive review.

The patch applies to 4.0.rc2 and sage -docbuild developer html works on a mac OS 10.4. I don't have pdflatex installed yet, so the pdf option fails.
