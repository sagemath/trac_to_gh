<a id='comment:1'></a>"Positive Review" because I just read the patch online on trac and it is definitely an enhancement over the old documentation.

"Minus epsilon" because I actually didn't download and test the patch (whether it applies to Sage-3.4.2, whether the documentation still builds, and such).

There is still room for improvement, e.g. display sample contents of the ".hgignore" file --- this file has to contain necessarily "src" as an exception.

If someone is willing to confirm that the patch applies and that the documentation builds correctly (with `sage -docbuild developer FORMAT`, with FORMAT being "html", "pdf", etc.) then I think it can get a full positive review.
