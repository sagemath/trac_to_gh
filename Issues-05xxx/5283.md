If I try to create a subposet of a subposet of something, I have problems:

```
sage: P = BooleanLattice(2)
sage: above = P.principal_order_filter(0)
sage: Q = P.subposet(above)
sage: above_new = Q.principal_order_filter(Q.list()[0])
sage: Q.subposet(above_new)

```
I think that the problem is in the `__contains__` method for posets, where the argument x is converted to x.element, which might be an int.  I'm not sure why I have to iterate the subposet construction twice to get this to happen...

Attachment [trac_5283.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket5283/trac_5283.patch) by @saliola created at 2009-04-30 09:56:11

The poset elements are just wrapping elements, so I modified the subposet constructor to unwrap before constructing the subposet (it was wrapping a wrapped element).

Note that you can still create a poset of poset elements, this is just for the subposet constructor.

This fixes the problem, and all tests pass.  Simple change to the code, good addition to the doctests.
