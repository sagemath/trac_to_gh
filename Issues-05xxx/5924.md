I would like to propose the addition of a method which will give the slopes of the U_p operator acting on a space of overconvergent modular forms. Here is my suggested code:

```
 def slopes(self, n, use_recurrence=False):
        r"""
        Compute the slopes of the `U_p` operator acting on self, using an n x n matrix.

        EXAMPLES::
             sage: OverconvergentModularForms(5,2,1/3,base_ring=Qp(5),prec=100).slopes(5)
             [0, 2, 5, 6, 9]
             sage: sage: OverconvergentModularForms(2,1,1/3,char=DirichletGroup(4,QQ).0)
             [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]
        """ 
        if self.base_ring() == QQ:
             slopelist=self.cps_u(n).truncate().newton_slopes(self.prime())
        elif is_pAdicField(self.base_ring()):
             slopelist=self.cps_u(n).truncate().newton_slopes()
        else:
             print "slopes are only defined for base field QQ or a p-adic field"
        return [-i for i in slopelist]
```

Positive review. The above code works fine for me (modulo a tiny typo fix), so I've made a proper patch for it. Note that although this has my mercurial username on the patch, credit should go to Lloyd.

Lloyd,

next time you open a ticket please use a descriptive summary. "Proposed new methord ..." is next to useless ;)

Lloyd's summary is a little mysterious, but there was already functionality for computing the U_p operator -- that's what the entire overconvergent forms class is there for -- it was just an easy shortcut to access the list of slopes that was missing.
