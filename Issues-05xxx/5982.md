<a id='comment:4'></a>Hi,

M2 isn't a default part of Sage, so the doctest must be made optional. I also don't see a reason why this cannot be implemented via libSingular for example, but maybe I am overlooking things.

You also posted a diff, so please check in the code and post an hg patch to properly preserve credit. 

And since you are not listed at http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/wiki please add yourself there.

Cheers,

Michael

Why is this

```
        The following is Trac #5982.  Note that the quotient ring 
        is not recognized as being a field at this time, so the 
        fraction field is not the quotient ring itself:: 
 
            sage: Q = R.quotient(I); Q 
            Quotient of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field by the ideal (x^2 - y^2 - 1) 
            sage: Q.fraction_field() 
            Fraction Field of Quotient of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field by the ideal (x^2 - y^2 - 1) 
```
part of the documentation of `is_prime` and not of `fraction_field`?

All tests pass with these patches on sage-4.6.2.alpha4. Patches fix the problem in the ticket description, and all changes look good.
