REFEREE REPORT



The patch **hg-rst.patch** applied fine against 3.4.alpha0 and all doctests passed with the options

```
-t -long -optional
```
Well, one doesn't need to run doctests on `sage/misc/` since this is just a minor formatting fix, but I did so anyway just to make sure... The reference manual built OK with this command

```
sage -docbuild reference html
```
Checking the relevant file

```
/path/to/html/en/reference/sage/misc/hg.html
```
I see that the formatting of both `import_patch()` and `patch()` is consistent with each other. So positive review.
