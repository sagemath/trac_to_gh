The attached patch adds doctests for 28 previously undoctested functions in the sage/modular directory, and fixes 2 small bugs uncovered in the process: one in pickling of arithmetic subgroups defined by permutations, and one in dirichlet characters (galois_orbits() returned meaningless garbage when the base ring wasn't an integral domain). 

This brings the doctest coverage to 100% for everything *except* the three big subdirectories modform/, modsym/ and hecke/. I will get to work on these next.

REVIEW:
* Put backquotes aroudn start_weight in the modform_generators docstring: 
  ` - start_weight -- an integer (default: 2) `
* A doctest fails on 32-bit OS X: 

```
sage -t --long devel/sage/sage/modular/arithgroup/arithgroup_perm.py
**********************************************************************
File "/Users/wstein/build/sage-3.4.1.rc1/devel/sage-main/sage/modular/arithgroup/arithgroup_perm.py", line 202:
    sage: cmp(G, 1)
Expected:
    -1
Got:
    1
**********************************************************************
1 items had failures:
   1 of   6 in __main__.example_9
***Test Failed*** 1 failures.
```
I recommend changing the doctest to:

```
   sage: cmp(G,1) in [-1,1]
```
since it depends on the OS.


These are trivial changes, so I've posted a tiny patch that adds them and given this a positive review.

Here's some more -- mostly in sage/modular/hecke/hecke_operator.py and sage/modular/hecke/module.py. This patch also adds Brandt modules into the reference manual.
