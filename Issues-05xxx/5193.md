On a 32-bit computer, `MatrixSpace` will let you create a matrix space with up to 2<sup>32</sup>-1 rows or columns.  But we use Py_ssize_t for matrix indices, which can only hold numbers up to 2<sup>31</sup>-1.

Patch attached; all doctests pass on a 64-bit computer, and .../matrix_space.py doctests pass on a 32-bit computer.

**Attachment:** [fix-max-matrix-size.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket5193/fix-max-matrix-size.patch)

I think the reasoning is that Py_ssize_t is a signed integer to allow for negative indices.

Yep, the reasoning is explained in the patch.  Doctests in matrixspace.py pass on my 32 bit computer.  Positive review.
