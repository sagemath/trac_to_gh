Arrg, this is cause by Integer(2**40) on 32 bit systems being "0" in
Cython. I didn't use any long representation of 2^40 to avoid running
into 32 vs. 64 bit issues. Oh well, please open a ticket, I guess
there will be another "final" 3.4.2 tarball :(

Ahh, I looked at the timeline to make sure there wasn't a ticket already, but Jaap did open this more or less at the same time. And he beat me to it, but since I attached a workaround patch to #5981 I am closing this one as a dupe ;)

Cheers,

Michael
