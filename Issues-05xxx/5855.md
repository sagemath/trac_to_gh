Note that is_prime_power explicitly coerces its input to ZZ first, whereas squarefree_divisors doesn't.  

Also, just because some code wasn't written in a certain way in arith.py long ago, doesn't mean we should continue in that direction now.   You might as well argue that lots of code has no doctests, so "it would seem reasonable to write lots more code with no doctests and then have someone make a new ticket to add doctests".  It's the same argument you make above, but with "doctests" instead of "making sense over more general rings". 

Regarding the actual patch, David says "Hmmm, is this supposed to work only for integers?".  Note that the first sentence of the docstring says "Iterator over the squarefree divisors of the integer N."

The only reasonable options seem to be:

1. This should be a method of integers, or

2. The input should be coerced to ZZ, or

3. The function is modified so it works over more general rings, and it is stated in the docs that it is "squarefree up to units", and works for any ring where the prime_divisors function works.   Note that prime_divisors works for *any* ring where factor works. 


I like 3 the best.

I'm a bit late to this discussion.  I see that the new funtcion applies, for example, tp ZZ[x], but gives the wrong results because factor() is wrong for that ring:

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: f = 30*x
sage: f.factor()
30 * x
```
which should return 2*3*5*x, if we mean the factors to be irreducibles in th parent ring.  Unless we make a deliberate design decision not to (since then factorization obviously becomes as hard as in ZZ).

Thumbs up.

John, I agree the results are wrong for ZZ[x], but that should be on a different ticket. (My 2c on that: I think the return value should be 2*3*5*x in your example, because algebraically that makes the most sense. The user should be aware that integer factorisation is hard, and they always have the option to remove the content manually if that suits their application.)
