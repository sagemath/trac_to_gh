This ticket used to be about prime_pi() segfaulting, but due to a mixup of versions used and switching to a new algorithm in 3.4.2.a0 the cause is the following:

```
mabshoff@sage:/scratch/mabshoff/sage-3.4.2.final$ ./sage
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Sage Version 3.4.2.rc0, Release Date: 2009-04-30                   |

----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage: len(prime_range(2^50))
/scratch/mabshoff/sage-3.4.2.final/local/bin/sage-sage: line 198: 13833 Segmentation fault      sage-ipython "$@" -i
```

Alex's comments are about the old ticket. This problem with wrong results has been moved to #5963.

Cheers,

Michael

I can't get this to segfault.  I tried on sage.math and on my laptop (macbook running 32-bit archlinux).  The problem is that the two machines get different answers after a while (I hope the table is clear -- the last column is a function that's "known" to be a good approximation to prime_pi):

```
x     prime_pi(x) on sage.math     prime_pi(x) on my laptop     Li(x)-Li(sqrt(x))/2
2^46   2280998753949                2280998753949               2.28099863535e+12
2^47   4461632979717                4454203917918               4.46163280359e+12
2^48   8731188863470                8612800813048               8.73118897751e+12
2^49  17094432576778               15793194017311               1.70944327138e+13
2^50  33483379603407               21969300962685               3.34833795774e+13
```

So it seems that the problem starts somewhere between `2^46` and `2^47`, and that the sage.math output is most likely correct.

    PariError: not enough memory (28)
```

What's `sys.maxint` on hawk? I don't have an account there. On my machine:

```
sage: sys.maxint
9223372036854775807
```

Maybe the doctest should test a specific number to avoid vagaries of various platforms? Or maybe we should dig around in the code to find out why there are two different code paths that run out of memory in this operation with two different error messages.
