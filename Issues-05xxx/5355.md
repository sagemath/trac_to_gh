If a number field comes with an embedding into the complex numbers, QQbar should allow coercions (or at least conversions) from that number field.
For example:

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^3 - x + 1, embedding=-1.32)
sage: QQbar.coerce_map_from(K)
Ring morphism:
  From: Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^3 - x + 1
  To:   Algebraic Field
  Defn: a |--> -1.324717957244746?
```
Currently, this map can already be created using `K.hom([QQbar(a)])` (see #13041).

Using the default there would be a coercion possible from K to QQbar; but the  first version would allow the user flexibility.

To automate the embedding, what should be the interface, perhaps something like this?

```
K.<a> = NumberField(x^3 - 7, embedding=1.9, embedding_field=AA)
```
