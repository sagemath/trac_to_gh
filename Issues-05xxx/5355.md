If a number field comes with an embedding into the complex numbers, QQbar should allow coercions (or at least conversions) from that number field.
For example:

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^3 - x + 1, embedding=-1.32)
sage: QQbar.coerce_map_from(K)
Ring morphism:
  From: Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^3 - x + 1
  To:   Algebraic Field
  Defn: a |--> -1.324717957244746?
```
Currently, this map can already be created using `K.hom([QQbar(a)])` (see #13041).

This should not be hard.  Here is what I propose:

* Given a number field K and an emebedding of K into RR or CC, return the corresponding embedding of K into QQbar.  This just requires selecting from K.embeddings(QQbar) the one which maps K.gen() to the element of QQbar closest to the image of K.gen() under the given embedding.  As a variation, if the given embedding was into RR then the output could be an embedding into AA>

* As a default we could give no embedding and then use K.gen().complex_embedding() instead.

Using the default there would be a coercion possible from K to QQbar; but the  first version would allow the user flexibility.

We do have

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^3 - 7, embedding=AA(7)**(1/3))
sage: AA.has_coerce_map_from(K)
True
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^3 - 7, embedding=QQbar(7)**(1/3) * QQbar.zeta(3))
sage: QQbar.has_coerce_map_from(K)
True
```
Isn't it enough? What should be simplified is to automatized the embedding into `AA`/`QQbar`. And it is more or less the purpose of #19356.

To automate the embedding, what should be the interface, perhaps something like this?

```
K.<a> = NumberField(x^3 - 7, embedding=1.9, embedding_field=AA)
```
