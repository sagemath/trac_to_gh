The spkg package is at:

All calculus tests run fine, I am now testing the whole sage. When it's done, I'll append the log.

Unfortunately, the tests hung. It may be that they hung on my machine even before uploading the new sympy. I used sage 3.4.1.alpha0.

So this should be investigated.

Ignore the sympy_test.2.log, I don't know how to delete it.


sympy_test.log now contains the testsuite including the timeout failures.
