Unfortunately, the tests hung. It may be that they hung on my machine even before uploading the new sympy. I used sage 3.4.1.alpha0.

So this should be investigated.

Ignore the sympy_test.2.log, I don't know how to delete it.


sympy_test.log now contains the testsuite including the timeout failures.

Do not attach logs to trac - copy and paste the failures into a comment. I have deleted both logs.
