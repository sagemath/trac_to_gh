The spkg package is at:

http://sympy.googlecode.com/files/sympy-0.6.4.spkg

All calculus tests run fine, I am now testing the whole sage. When it's done, I'll append the log.

Component: **calculus**

Unfortunately, the tests hung. It may be that they hung on my machine even before uploading the new sympy. I used sage 3.4.1.alpha0.
