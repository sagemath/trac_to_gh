The file has zero doctests, imports nonexisting classes and looks like it's never been used.

I'm attaching a patch that implements only the basic constructors and properties of projective and affine hypersurfaces, with 100% doctest coverage (of course :)

I plan to add some more interesting functionality later, but this is a start.

Positive review!

I added this to the reference manual which required a little tweaking (the EXAMPLES in an `__init__` docstring are excluded from the manual since the function name starts with an underscore;  what works well is to copy the same examples into the class's own docstring, then they get into the manual).

I tested that the docs now build ok and look ok in the html ref manual.

I guess Alex should ok the extra patch.
