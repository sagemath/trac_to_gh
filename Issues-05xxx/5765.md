The attached patch brings up the doctest coverage from 24% to 87% (29 of 33).

There is also some fairly straightforward refactoring of code, e.g. moving `_validate` to the ambient spaces where it belongs logically.  I also realised that `self.complement(other)` is counterintuitive and changed it to match normal speech patterns: it should be "the complement of self in other", which is other-self, not self-other.  An added bonus is that now one can write `X.complement()` to get the complement of X in its ambient space, which is highly intuitive.  Normally such a change in behaviour would be tricky but since the functions were just broken until 3.4.1.rc3, this shouldn't lead to any confusion (since nobody has used them yet).

Note that the patch relies on changes that only went in at 3.4.1.rc3, so it should only be applied on top of 3.4.1.rc3.

The new patch replaces the first one and deals with this.  (Sorry, I forgot to do "sage -hg qnew" so it is not a separate patch,

The problem was:  in ell_field.py the function  _check_satisfies_equations called _error_bad_coords which Alex had renamed.  But all it did was riase an error with an appropriate message, so I just raised the error in place.

One remaining question: why is the error raised a TypeError?  In my view the type is fine but the values are wrong if the coordinates do not satisfy the equation.  I would have made it a ValueError.  but for consistence with the general scheme functions I left it as a TypeError.

I put this back to "needs review" but if Michael is happy with test passing there's no more needed.

John's changes look good and fix most of the broken doctests.

There was one left, in `schemes/plane_curves/constructor.py`.  The fix is trivial and in the new patch `trac_5765-2.patch`, which should be applied after `trac_5765-1.patch`.

Very good, that's why I wanted to hear others say something about it.

I don't feel strongly either way.  From what I can see, `EllipticCurve_generic` has stuff that makes sense for elliptic curves over rings.  I agree that it would be good to sift through that and see if there are methods that really only work over fields, and move these to `ell_field.py`.

The patch applies but tests in ell_point.py fila revealing this horror:

```
sage: Fx.<b>=GF(2^(4*5))
sage: Ex=EllipticCurve(Fx,[0,0,1,1,1])
sage: Ex.defining_polynomial()
x^3 + y^2*z + 0*x*z^2 + 0*y*z^2 + 0*z^3
```
-- note the zero coefficients!

Adding a whole lot of print statements I get to this:

```
sage: Ex=EllipticCurve(Fx,[0,0,1,1,1])
K =  Finite Field in b of size 2^20
PP =  Projective Space of dimension 2 over Finite Field in b of size 2^20
PP.coordinate_ring() =  Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y, z over Finite Field in b of size 2^20
PP.coordinate_ring().base_ring() =  Finite Field in b of size 2^20
PP.coordinate_ring()(1) =  1
ainvs =  [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
a1, a2, a3, a4, a6 =  0 0 1 1 1
a4*x*z**2 =  0*x*z^2
a4's parent =  Finite Field in b of size 2^20
 f =  x^3 + y^2*z + 0*x*z^2 + 0*y*z^2 + 0*z^3
```
At which point I am stuck.  We have the constant 1 in the multivariate poly ring in x,y,z over the field GF(2^20), but when I multiply a monomial by it it displays with coefficient zero.

This has surely been caused by something not in this patch!  I tried constructing an example outside this bit of code but failed (to make it fail in this way).  In fact this happens in unpatched 3.4.2.alpha0:

```
sage: Fx.<b>=GF(2^(4*5))
sage: Ex=EllipticCurve(Fx,[0,0,1,1,1])
sage: Ex.defining_polynomial()
x^3 + y^2*z + 0*x*z^2 + 0*y*z^2 + 0*z^3
```

After applying also the patch at #5919, all tests in sage/schemes pass, so I am changing this to "positive review" but note that it does depend on that patch for the tests in ell_point.py to pass.  

The patches (here and at #5919) can be merged in either order.
