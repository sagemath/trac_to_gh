Good question.  I have done almost all I wanted to do with it, but unfortunately it's all mixed up with another patch that already got merged.  It will take me a bit of time to disentangle it, though.  Don't wait on it, although I'll do my best to get it done soon.

I was working on rebasing the patch against 3.4.2.alpha0, when I realised that `ell_field.py` has no reason to implement `_check_satisfies_equations`, since I have fixed the corresponding function "upstream" in `algebraic_scheme.py`.  In other words, the inherited method now works as it should so there's no need to reimplement it for elliptic curves.

Of course, once you remove `_check_satisfies_equations` from `ell_field.py`, there's nothing left.  I think we just just get rid of this file and make classes that currently inherit from `EllipticCurve_field` inherit directly from `EllipticCurve_generic` instead.

The newly attached patch `trac_5765-rebased.patch` implements all this, and is based on 3.4.2.alpha0.  Doctests pass for me, but this is a significant change so I'd like John to review this so he can object if need be.

Very good, that's why I wanted to hear others say something about it.

I don't feel strongly either way.  From what I can see, `EllipticCurve_generic` has stuff that makes sense for elliptic curves over rings.  I agree that it would be good to sift through that and see if there are methods that really only work over fields, and move these to `ell_field.py`.

The patch applies but tests in ell_point.py fila revealing this horror:

```
sage: Fx.<b>=GF(2^(4*5))
sage: Ex=EllipticCurve(Fx,[0,0,1,1,1])
sage: Ex.defining_polynomial()
x^3 + y^2*z + 0*x*z^2 + 0*y*z^2 + 0*z^3
```
-- note the zero coefficients!

Adding a whole lot of print statements I get to this:

```
sage: Ex=EllipticCurve(Fx,[0,0,1,1,1])
K =  Finite Field in b of size 2^20
PP =  Projective Space of dimension 2 over Finite Field in b of size 2^20
PP.coordinate_ring() =  Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y, z over Finite Field in b of size 2^20
PP.coordinate_ring().base_ring() =  Finite Field in b of size 2^20
PP.coordinate_ring()(1) =  1
ainvs =  [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
a1, a2, a3, a4, a6 =  0 0 1 1 1
a4*x*z**2 =  0*x*z^2
a4's parent =  Finite Field in b of size 2^20
 f =  x^3 + y^2*z + 0*x*z^2 + 0*y*z^2 + 0*z^3
```
At which point I am stuck.  We have the constant 1 in the multivariate poly ring in x,y,z over the field GF(2^20), but when I multiply a monomial by it it displays with coefficient zero.

This has surely been caused by something not in this patch!  I tried constructing an example outside this bit of code but failed (to make it fail in this way).  In fact this happens in unpatched 3.4.2.alpha0:

```
sage: Fx.<b>=GF(2^(4*5))
sage: Ex=EllipticCurve(Fx,[0,0,1,1,1])
sage: Ex.defining_polynomial()
x^3 + y^2*z + 0*x*z^2 + 0*y*z^2 + 0*z^3
```

After applying also the patch at #5919, all tests in sage/schemes pass, so I am changing this to "positive review" but note that it does depend on that patch for the tests in ell_point.py to pass.  

The patches (here and at #5919) can be merged in either order.
