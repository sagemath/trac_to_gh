Good question.  I have done almost all I wanted to do with it, but unfortunately it's all mixed up with another patch that already got merged.  It will take me a bit of time to disentangle it, though.  Don't wait on it, although I'll do my best to get it done soon.

The attached patch brings up the doctest coverage from 24% to 87% (29 of 33).

There is also some fairly straightforward refactoring of code, e.g. moving `_validate` to the ambient spaces where it belongs logically.  I also realised that `self.complement(other)` is counterintuitive and changed it to match normal speech patterns: it should be "the complement of self in other", which is other-self, not self-other.  An added bonus is that now one can write `X.complement()` to get the complement of X in its ambient space, which is highly intuitive.  Normally such a change in behaviour would be tricky but since the functions were just broken until 3.4.1.rc3, this shouldn't lead to any confusion (since nobody has used them yet).

Note that the patch relies on changes that only went in at 3.4.1.rc3, so it should only be applied on top of 3.4.1.rc3.

Very good, that's why I wanted to hear others say something about it.

I don't feel strongly either way.  From what I can see, `EllipticCurve_generic` has stuff that makes sense for elliptic curves over rings.  I agree that it would be good to sift through that and see if there are methods that really only work over fields, and move these to `ell_field.py`.

In the meantime, I'll modify the patch so that it just removes `_check_satisfies_equations` and leaves only `pass` in the definition of the class `EllipticCurve_field`.

I really need sleep now, but I'll have a corrected patch up in the morning.

The patch applies but tests in ell_point.py fila revealing this horror:

```
sage: Fx.<b>=GF(2^(4*5))

a4*x*z**2 =  0*x*z^2
a4's parent =  Finite Field in b of size 2^20
 f =  x^3 + y^2*z + 0*x*z^2 + 0*y*z^2 + 0*z^3
```
At which point I am stuck.  We have the constant 1 in the multivariate poly ring in x,y,z over the field GF(2^20), but when I multiply a monomial by it it displays with coefficient zero.

This has surely been caused by something not in this patch!  I tried constructing an example outside this bit of code but failed (to make it fail in this way).  In fact this happens in unpatched 3.4.2.alpha0:

```
sage: Fx.<b>=GF(2^(4*5))
sage: Ex=EllipticCurve(Fx,[0,0,1,1,1])
sage: Ex.defining_polynomial()
x^3 + y^2*z + 0*x*z^2 + 0*y*z^2 + 0*z^3
```

After applying also the patch at #5919, all tests in sage/schemes pass, so I am changing this to "positive review" but note that it does depend on that patch for the tests in ell_point.py to pass.  

The patches (here and at #5919) can be merged in either order.
