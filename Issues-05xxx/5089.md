```
sage: M = matrix(ZZ, 2, 3, [1,2,3,4,5,6])
sage: M.kernel()
```
works fine, while

```
sage: M = matrix(ZZ, 2, 3, [1,2,3,4,5,6], sparse=True)
sage: M.kernel()
```
gives an error, `TypeError: Argument K (= Integer Ring) must be a field.`

The attached patch fixes this -- it adds a kernel method for sparse integer matrices, which just calls `self.dense_matrix().kernel(...)`.



Component: **linear algebra**

Keywords: **sparse integer matrix kernel**
