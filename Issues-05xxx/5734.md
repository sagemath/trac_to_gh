The patch touches only sage/modular/modsym/manin_symbols.py, based on 3.4.1.rc2.

```

sage/modular/modsym/manin_symbols.py
SCORE sage/modular/modsym/manin_symbols.py: 100% (59 of 59)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

I also fixed some small bugs in functions which did not seem to be used, removed (by commenting out) a class `x__ManinSymbolList_gamma1` which was not used, and implemented a slightly more sensible cmp() function for class ManinSymbol (which used to return 1 for any two distinct symbols).  All doctests in sage/modular pass, and I also checked quite thoroughly through the resulting reference manual page, which also looks good.

Review please!

This looks great: applies fine to 3.4.1.rc2, all doctests pass, and documentation builds happily.

I've made a few slight adjustments to the formatting (mainly enforcing a consistent convention that INPUT: is always followed by a bulleted list and OUTPUT: never is, which was true for most but not all of the new doctests), and I've added an x == loads(dumps(x)) doctest for each of the classes that are actually intended for direct use. (There was a loads(dumps()) test in the file already, so sage -coverage didn't protest, but it was commented out, and it was for a different class anyway.)

John: if you're happy with the changes I've made, feel free to change this to "positive review".
