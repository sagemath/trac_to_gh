The goal of this patch is to move some more of the algorithms in (the GAP package for error-correcting codes) Guava over to Sage. Currently Guava is included in Sage (in fact, Guava is the only GAP package included in Sage), but once the commands are implemented in Python (or Cython) it will be possible to remove Guava from Sage, while keeping Guava as an optional package. 

The patch adds a new file/module with 2 decoding methods implemented but does not import it into the namespace. Instead, methods from linear_code import them locally as needed.

Component: **coding theory**

Some suggestions:

* The function `weight_order` doesn't get used anywhere, and should probably be removed from the patch. Also, you should remove the commented lines in `syndrome`.

* The docs for `coset_leader` are identical to those for `syndrome` up to the examples. Perhaps this needs to be updated.

* The patch file itself looks funny, since the

Okay, I redid the patch following these instructions.

It will now not pass sage -t because now it gets lots of print statements "Warning: this should never happen" (from gap.py I think), followed by the correct answer. So the gap interface seems to be printing this message but the code I wrote is returning the correct answer. (After building guava "manually", sage -t -long has the same problem.)
