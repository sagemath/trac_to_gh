sage: imag(complex(0,1))
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

/home/grout/.sage/temp/good/9936/_home_grout__sage_init_sage_0.py in <module>()

/home/grout/sage/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/sage/misc/functional.pyc in imag(x)
    376     Return the imaginary part of x.

--> 378     try: return x.imag()
    379     except AttributeError: return CDF(x).imag()
    380 

TypeError: 'float' object is not callable
```

This is because complex(0,1).imag is a number, not a function, so trying to call that number gives the error.  As Robert Bradshaw said on the mailing list, Sage's imag() should really know about python complex numbers.

So I'm closing this ticket as fixed.
