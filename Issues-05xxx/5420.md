This is because complex(0,1).imag is a number, not a function, so trying to call that number gives the error.  As Robert Bradshaw said on the mailing list, Sage's imag() should really know about python complex numbers.

This also looks OK with Sage 4.1:

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Sage Version 4.1, Release Date: 2009-07-09                         |
| Type notebook() for the GUI, and license() for information.        |
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage: imag(complex(0,1))
1.00000000000000
```
So I'm closing this ticket as fixed.
