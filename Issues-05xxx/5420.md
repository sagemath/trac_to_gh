    379     except AttributeError: return CDF(x).imag()

TypeError: 'float' object is not callable
```

This is because complex(0,1).imag is a number, not a function, so trying to call that number gives the error.  As Robert Bradshaw said on the mailing list, Sage's imag() should really know about python complex numbers.

<a id='comment:3'></a>This also looks OK with Sage 4.1:

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage: imag(complex(0,1))
1.00000000000000

So I'm closing this ticket as fixed.
