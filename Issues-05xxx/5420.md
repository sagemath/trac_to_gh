sage: imag(complex(0,1))
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

/home/grout/sage/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/sage/misc/functional.pyc in imag(x)
    376     Return the imaginary part of x.

    379     except AttributeError: return CDF(x).imag()
    380 

TypeError: 'float' object is not callable
```

This is because complex(0,1).imag is a number, not a function, so trying to call that number gives the error.  As Robert Bradshaw said on the mailing list, Sage's imag() should really know about python complex numbers.
