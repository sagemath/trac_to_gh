    379     except AttributeError: return CDF(x).imag()

TypeError: 'float' object is not callable
```

This is because complex(0,1).imag is a number, not a function, so trying to call that number gives the error.  As Robert Bradshaw said on the mailing list, Sage's imag() should really know about python complex numbers.

This also looks OK with Sage 4.1:

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage: imag(complex(0,1))
1.00000000000000
```
So I'm closing this ticket as fixed.
