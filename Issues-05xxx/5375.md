REFEREE REPORT



The patch **geom-rst.patch** applied cleanly against 3.4.alpha0 and all doctests passed with the options `-t -long -optional`. The reference manual built fine with

```
sage -docbuild reference html
```
Looking at the relevant HTML file

```
/path/to/reference/sage/geometry/lattice_polytope.html
```
the suggested patch fixed the problem it's intends to. So positive review on my part. Note that there are still a large number of typos in the file that **geom-rst.patch** touches, namely

```
sage/geometry/lattice_polytope.py
```
But please open another ticket for that.
