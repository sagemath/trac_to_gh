BEFORE:

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ['x']
sage: f = 389*R.random_element(1000)
sage: timeit('f//389')
625 loops, best of 3: 228 µs per loop
```

AFTER:

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ['x']
sage: f = 389*R.random_element(1000)
sage: timeit('f//389')
625 loops, best of 3: 48.3 µs per loop
```

The bug was doing the shortcut case, but then not returning and hence doing the long case *as well*.
