Unfortunately this patch has bitrotted, so please rebase against 3.4.1.rc3.

```
sage-3.4.1.rc3/devel/sage$ patch -p1 < trac_5599-plot-center.patch 
patching file sage/plot/contour_plot.py
Hunk #1 succeeded at 149 (offset 1 line).
Hunk #2 FAILED at 246.
Hunk #3 FAILED at 264.
Hunk #4 succeeded at 285 (offset 14 lines).
2 out of 4 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file sage/plot/contour_plot.py.rej
patching file sage/plot/density_plot.py
Hunk #1 succeeded at 117 with fuzz 2.
```
Once it is rebased the postive review can be reinstated provided the rejects are trivial to resolve. 

Cheers,
