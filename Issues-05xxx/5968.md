I have one microscopically insignificant quibble: might it not be better to add a couple of minus signs into the `__cmp__` method, changing it to 

```
if not isinstance(other, ModularSymbol):
    return cmp(type(self), type(other))
return cmp((self.__space,-self.__i,self.__alpha,self.__beta),
           (other.__space,-other.__i,other.__alpha,other.__beta))
```
?

This is somehow the sort order that "feels most natural" to me -- so X<sup>2</sup>Y comes before XY<sup>2</sup>. This would then need fewer changes to other files, but of course it means most of the new doctests in your file would need rewriting :-).
