I have one microscopically insignificant quibble: might it not be better to add a couple of minus signs into the `__cmp__` method, changing it to 

```
if not isinstance(other, ModularSymbol):
    return cmp(type(self), type(other))
return cmp((self.__space,-self.__i,self.__alpha,self.__beta),
           (other.__space,-other.__i,other.__alpha,other.__beta))
```
?

This is somehow the sort order that "feels most natural" to me -- so X<sup>2</sup>Y comes before XY<sup>2</sup>. This would then need fewer changes to other files, but of course it means most of the new doctests in your file would need rewriting :-). Also, what is the reasoning behind introducing the space in the `_repr_` method? I would advocate leaving `_repr_` as is unless there is a pressing reason to change it, in order to minimise the likelihood of breaking user code.

The new patch above adds the suggested minus sign to give a more "natural" sort order, and adjusts the doctests accordingly; I've checked that with this modification all doctests still pass on my machine (32-bit Linux). I take back my comment about the `_repr_` method: all the native Python sequence types print with spaces in, so I agree that a space in modular symbols is better for consistency, and it certainly looks nicer.

In the process of fixing this I realised that the file `modular_symbols.py` isn't included in the reference manual, so the new patch does that too (and includes some ReST syntax fixes, so the manual page builds correctly and looks nice-ish). 

William: I'm happy with your changes, so if you're happy with my subsequent ones, I guess we can call this a positive review.

William: just in case you've forgotten about this ticket, it would be good if you could take a quick glance at the changes I made in my third patch above.

BTW, I'm moving this ticket to component "modular forms", which seems to be a better fit for it.

Review: applied all 3 patches to 3.4.2 with no problem.  All tests in sage/modular and doc/en/bordeaux_2008 pass.  This is on a 64-bit machine.

I did not build the documentation (it takes such ages)  but looking at the docstrings could not see anything wrong.

Let's roll!
