It would be nice to unify Sage's two ways of handling Galois groups: as abstract transitive groups, and as sets of explicit automorphisms with no group structure. This can be done by using Pari's galoisinit, galoispoltoperm and galoisapply functions.

The above patch should do the job for absolute fields: it creates a new GaloisGroup class, which has very little resemblance to the old one, and derives from PermutationGroup_generic. The init script calls Pari's galoisinit. Elements are stored as GaloisGroupElement objects, which are basically permutations, but with the addition of a cached method that returns the image of a generator of that permutation under the corresponding automorphism. 

I've also added toy implementations of decomposition and ramification groups and the Artin symbol for prime ideals in number fields; I'm sure there are faster algorithms to calculate these rather than using the definitions directly as I've done, but I am a strong believer in toy implementations.

At present this is all only for absolute fields, because Pari has no direct support for Galois groups of relative extensions. Relative fields could also be implemented, at least when the corresponding absolute field is Galois over QQ, by calculating the Galois group of the absolute extension and checking which automorphisms fix the intermediate field; but I haven't done this.

This looks like great work which will be extremely useful, but needs to be rebased on 3.4  (i.e. change the docstrings in number_field.py into ReST style) before it can be tested.

At the same time, I think you can safely replace the old galois_group.py with the new one instead of leaving there and adding _new to your name.

I'll do a proper review when rebased, as so far as have just read the patch.

I've rebased it to a patch based on (3.4 + the patch for #5508).

This version actually adds quite a bit that wasn't in the previous version: based on the debate on sage-nt, I've made it return the Galois group of the splitting field when the given field isn't Galois, and also added a method fixed_field for subgroups of Galois groups based on Pari's "galoisfixedfield".

In an ideal world, when given a non-Galois field, it would return the Galois group of the Galois closure of the given field, but represented as permutations of the roots of the defining polynomial of the original field. I couldn't work out an easy way of doing this which wouldn't be horribly slow in general, so elements are represented as permutations of the Galois conjugates of some single element generating the Galois closure.

I've also ReSTified class_group.py and number_field_ideal.py (the latter because I was editing it anyway, and the former because it was easy to do); and deprecated galois_group and is_galois for relative fields in favour of explicitly relative and absolute variants.

Good news: this patch applies fine on top of sage-5508.2.patch.

I am very happy with this patch which provides a significant new set of functions and capabilities.  I did have two trivial doctest failures, in two files, nothing serious:

```

I can confirm that the patches apply ok as described, based on 3.4.  I have not yet tried on 3.4.1, or tested whether my rebased patch for #5513 will still work, but will do that.

I have relabelled this "positive review" although on of the new patches -- the very trivial one -- was mine.

I think you cannot rely on pari giveing you the primes in a specific order:

```
sage: P = K.primes_above(17)[0]
sage: P
Fractional ideal (1/492*a^7 - 101/1968*a^5 + 115/328*a^3 - 733/984*a)
sage: P^2
Fractional ideal (-1/492*a^7 + 101/1968*a^5 - 115/328*a^3 + 1717/984*a)
sage: Q = K.primes_above(17)[1]
sage: Q^2
Fractional ideal (-5/2788*a^7 + 587/11152*a^5 - 2791/5576*a^3 + 13915/5576*a)
```
so the doctest needs to be designed to allow for that.  Perhaps define P via

```
sage: P=K.ideal(17,a^2)
sage: P
Fractional ideal (1/492*a^7 - 101/1968*a^5 + 115/328*a^3 - 733/984*a)
sage: P.is_prime()
True
```
(which may or may not be the P i your doctest).

Sorting the list exposed another bug, which I refuse to accept any responsibility for whatsoever: there is something funny going on in the default `__cmp__` routine in sage.structure.element.Element, which meant that if x,y were GaloisGroupElements then cmp(x, y) worked but sorted([x, y]) didn't. 

I've worked around this by implementing `__cmp__` directly for GaloisGroupElements. This gets the doctests in doc/en/bordeaux_2008 to pass on 32bit and 64bit.

Apologies that these things didn't get spotted earlier, but I'm working from home on a clapped out old 32-bit laptop, on which running sage -testall takes over three hours, so when I was working on this I only ran the doctests in sage/rings/number_field. That's a mistake I won't make again.
