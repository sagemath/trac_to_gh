It would be nice to unify Sage's two ways of handling Galois groups: as abstract transitive groups, and as sets of explicit automorphisms with no group structure. This can be done by using Pari's galoisinit, galoispoltoperm and galoisapply functions.

At present this is all only for absolute fields, because Pari has no direct support for Galois groups of relative extensions.

This looks like great work which will be extremely useful, but needs to be rebased on 3.4  (i.e. change the docstrings in number_field.py into ReST style) before it can be tested.

At the same time, I think you can safely replace the old galois_group.py with the new one instead of leaving there and adding _new to your name.

I'll do a proper review when rebased, as so far as have just read the patch.

**Attachment:** [galois.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket5159/galois.patch.gz)

I've rebased it to a patch based on (3.4 + the patch for #5508).

This version actually adds quite a bit that wasn't in the previous version: based on the debate on sage-nt, I've made it return the Galois group of the splitting field when the given field isn't Galois, and also added a method fixed_field for subgroups of Galois groups based on Pari's "galoisfixedfield".

In an ideal world, when given a non-Galois field, it would return the Galois group of the Galois closure of the given field, but represented as permutations of the roots of the defining polynomial of the original field. I couldn't work out an easy way of doing this which wouldn't be horribly slow in general, so elements are represented as permutations of the Galois conjugates of some single element generating the Galois closure.

I've also ReSTified class_group.py and number_field_ideal.py (the latter because I was editing it anyway, and the former because it was easy to do); and deprecated galois_group and is_galois for relative fields in favour of explicitly relative and absolute variants.

I'm not sure whether I did something stupid here but in a fresh clone of 3.4 I applied sage-5508.2.patch from #5508 and then tried to apply the new galois.patch form here, but it does not apply properly:

```

applying /home/john/galois.patch
patching file sage/rings/number_field/number_field.py
Hunk #3 FAILED at 2536
Hunk #4 FAILED at 2555

Hunk #6 FAILED at 4160

Did I misunderstand something?  John

Good news: this patch applies fine on top of sage-5508.2.patch.

I am very happy with this patch which provides a significant new set of functions and capabilities.  I did have two trivial doctest failures, in two files, nothing serious:

```
sage -t  "local/sage-3.4/devel/sage-5159/sage/rings/number_field//number_field.py"
**********************************************************************

I think you cannot rely on pari giveing you the primes in a specific order:

```
sage: P = K.primes_above(17)[0]
sage: P
Fractional ideal (1/492*a^7 - 101/1968*a^5 + 115/328*a^3 - 733/984*a)
sage: P^2
Fractional ideal (-1/492*a^7 + 101/1968*a^5 - 115/328*a^3 + 1717/984*a)
sage: Q = K.primes_above(17)[1]
sage: Q^2
Fractional ideal (-5/2788*a^7 + 587/11152*a^5 - 2791/5576*a^3 + 13915/5576*a)
```
so the doctest needs to be designed to allow for that.  Perhaps define P via

```
sage: P=K.ideal(17,a^2)
sage: P
Fractional ideal (1/492*a^7 - 101/1968*a^5 + 115/328*a^3 - 733/984*a)
sage: P.is_prime()
True
```
(which may or may not be the P i your doctest).

Apologies that these things didn't get spotted earlier, but I'm working from home on a clapped out old 32-bit laptop, on which running sage -testall takes over three hours, so when I was working on this I only ran the doctests in sage/rings/number_field. That's a mistake I won't make again.
