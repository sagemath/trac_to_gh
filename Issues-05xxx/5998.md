Computer no 2 should not be able to run Sage, so let's ignore that for now.

Compute 1: doesn't run Sage

Computer 3: runs Sage

We have

# computer 1
sage: a = "fpu vme de pse tsc msr pae mce cx8 apic sep mtrr pge cmov pat clflush acpi mmx fxse sse sse2 nx up pni rng rng_en ace ace_en."
# computer 3
sage: b = "fpu vme de pse tsc msr mce cx8 apic sep mtrr pge mca cmov pat clflush dts acpi mmx fxsr sse sse2 up"
sage: a = set(a.split())
sage: b = set(b.split())

# what (1) has the (3) doesn't:
sage: ' '.join([x for x in a if x not in b])
'fxse nx rng_en pae ace_en. rng pni ace'

# what (3) has the (1) doesn't:
sage: ' '.join([x for x in b if x not in a])
'fxsr mca dts'

This suggests that fxsr, mca, or dts is relevant.  My build machine has all those flags, but your machine (1) doesn't.

fxsr is: "FXSAVE/FXRSTOR. (The FXSAVE instruction writes the current state of the x87 FPU, MMX technology, Streaming SIMD Extensions, and Streaming SIMD Extensions 2 data, control, and status registers to the destination operand. The destination is a 512-byte memory location. FXRSTOR will restore the state saves)."

dts is your digital thermal sensor, which is irrelevant. 

mca is "Machine Check Architecture."  No clue.

This is from http://blog.hbcom.info/archives/152/.   

Your testing thus suggests that fxsr is really important, and we should be explicitly checking for it and not allowing Sage to run if the user doesn't have it.  Also, we should look to see what part(s) of sage actually use it.
