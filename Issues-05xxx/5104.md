In addition to the problems fixed on trac #5060, we also have the following, reported by `sbarthelemy`:

Hello,

reading the code, I see another problem if ones has the following line in its `.pyx`:

`cimport mod#mycomment`

In such a case, we'll look for a dependency `mod#mycomment.pxd` instead of `mod.pxd`.

Arrg, this code actually does introduce a problem since `\w` does not include the directory separator `/`. Hence:

```
Installing c_lib
scons: `install' is up to date.
