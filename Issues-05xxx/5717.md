Printing of subdivisions of matrices mod 2 is broken.  Also, lifting of matrices should preserve subdivision but doesn't, but that's a separate ticket (#5716)

```
sage: a = random_matrix(GF(2),4)
sage: a.subdivide(2,2)
sage: a
[1 0 1 0]
[1 0 1 0]
[1 1 1 1]
[1 1 0 1]
sage: b = a.lift()
sage: b.subdivide(2,2)
sage: b
[1 0|1 0]
[1 0|1 0]
[---+---]
[1 1|1 1]
[1 1|0 1]
```
