There was a request on [sage-support](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_frm/thread/f12feafb8e4285ce) for the option to change how matrices are displayed, from parentheses to square brackets.  William made this suggestion:

```
How about adding a function to matrix0.pyx that sets a global variable
in that file to the left and right delimiters for matrices?

sage.matrix.matrix0.set_latex_delimiters('[',']')

would set them.  That's minimally intrusive.  Later on somebody could
come up with some grand scheme for customizing latex output, but
please don't until there are a few more use cases. 
```
The attached patch implements "set_matrix_latex_delimiters". (I changed the name slightly.)

Thank you!  This has been a minor annoyance when using Sage in class, since we use different delimiters than Sage...
