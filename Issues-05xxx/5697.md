To review this there are three components: 

* an updated GAP 4.4.10.spkg that reverts to 4.4.10.p10 and on top makes sure to nuke all gap-4.4.* installs, i.e. including 4.4.12.
* a patch reverting functional changes, i.e. the parts of #3337 where random_seed was used due to uspstream changes and reverting #5455 to not skip loading the workspace on Itaniums
* a patch fixing all the doctests due to the above patch. Since #3337 was pre-ReST it was a little messy and some of the changes moved to different files, etc.

I assume that to test this (on an amd64 ubuntu machine) I should

(1) create a clone of 3.4.1.rc3

(2) install http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/release-cycles-3.4.1/rc4/gap-4.4.10.p11.spkg

(3) apply the patches trac_5697-doctest.patch and then trac_5697-functional.patch 

Is this correct?

As mentioned above first functional, then doctests.

Yes, modulo the patch order.

* 1 the spkg works and with the two patches applied, all tests pass.


* Question: why do trac_5697-functional.patch?   It seems like all of that functionality would make sense and be food for any gap version (at least everything but the very last chunk).  Wasn't it just implementing the randgen framework correctly for GAP?   -- I'm ok with this, but we want the functionality back at some point, I think.

* The other changes look fine, in the other patch. 

Install the spkg ends with

```
make[1]: Leaving directory `/scratch/wstein/build/sage-3.4.1.rc2/spkg/build/gap-4.4.10.p11/src/pkg/guava3.4/src/leon'
cp: omitting directory `../../bin'
cp: cannot stat `cp': No such file or directory

real    1m17.533s
user    0m58.840s
sys     0m9.180s
Successfully installed gap-4.4.10.p11
```

That <code>cp: cannot stat \`cp': No such file or directory</code> worries me. 

Fix or explain that, and this gets a positive review.

re failure for <code>cp: cannot stat \`cp': No such file</code> - it was also in the old spkg and everything it where it needs to be, i.e. doctests pass. Since rlm is working on code to replace all of guava I am not too worried since it will be gone soon anyway.

If we don't need to set the random_seed we should not set the random seed. Once GAP 4.4.12+ works as expected it should be more or less trivial to take the two patches and revert them.
