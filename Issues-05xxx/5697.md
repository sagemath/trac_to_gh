As mentioned above first functional, then doctests.

Yes, modulo the patch order.

* Question: why do trac_5697-functional.patch?   It seems like all of that functionality would make sense and be food for any gap version (at least everything but the very last chunk).  Wasn't it just implementing the randgen framework correctly for GAP?   -- I'm ok with this, but we want the functionality back at some point, I think.

* The other changes look fine, in the other patch. 

Install the spkg ends with

```
make[1]: Leaving directory `/scratch/wstein/build/sage-3.4.1.rc2/spkg/build/gap-4.4.10.p11/src/pkg/guava3.4/src/leon'
cp: omitting directory `../../bin'
cp: cannot stat `cp': No such file or directory

real    1m17.533s
user    0m58.840s
sys     0m9.180s
Successfully installed gap-4.4.10.p11
```

That `cp: cannot stat `cp': No such file or directory` worries me. 

Fix or explain that, and this gets a positive review.

If we don't need to set the random_seed we should not set the random seed. Once GAP 4.4.12+ works as expected it should be more or less trivial to take the two patches and revert them.
