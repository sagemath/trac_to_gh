# Description of the bug
The following happens with

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```
| SAGE Version 3.1.2, Release Date: 2008-09-19                       |
| Type notebook() for the GUI, and license() for information.        |

**The function is_irreducible returns True on units:**

```
sage: R.<x>=PolynomialRing( IntegerModRing(13),'x')
sage: (x^2-2).is_irreducible()
True
sage: (x^2).is_irreducible()
False
sage: R(1).is_irreducible()
True
```
The last line should say False or raise an exception as R(0).is_irreducible() does. Because irreducibility of B requires B to be not zero and not a unit. 

# Use case where this bug occured to me

If I want to loop over polynomials in R and count irreducible ones, I need a loop like this:

```
for p in R.polynomials(max_degree=3):
     if not p.is_zero() and not p.is_unit() and p.is_irreducible():
         # count p
```
It is easy to forget the check if p is a unit. Then the count would be wrong. 

# Bug-Fix
The bug is in the implementation:

```
e=R(1)
e.is_irreducible??
```
shows as code after the docstring: 

```
if self.is_zero():
            raise ValueError, "self must be nonzero"
if self.degree() == 0:
            return True
```

**I propose to insert a check**

```
if self.is_unit():
            raise ValueError, "self must not be a unit"
```
between the above ifs. I created a file via commit and  bundle with this modification.

Review:  I agree entirely that units need to be handled properly here, but I do not think that this patch solves the issue.  

Firstly, I don't think that raising an error is necessary or helpful, and would prefer to return False for units.

Secondly, you have left in the code which (now for non-units) returns True for degree 0 polynomials.  But that is wrong for polynomials over rings which are not fields such as ZZ[x], where 6 has degree 0, is not a unit but is not irreducible.  Instead, for degree 0 polynomials (which have already been handled by the is_unit() test) one should test irreducibility in the base ring.

Example:

```
sage: R.<x>=ZZ[]
sage: R(6).is_irreducible()
True
```
is wrong, and it would be nice if the patch handled this also.

Lastly: Lars, when you make a patch to correct some incorrect behaviour in Sage you should add a doctest to the function which shows that the problem has been solved.

To solve this I implemented an is_zero() function for completely general rings (it just tests is the one_element() equals the zero_element(), and some small functions on general rings can now be decided if the ring is zero -- such as is_finite().

I tested everything in sage/rings.
