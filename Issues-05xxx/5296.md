With the switch to an app bundle distribution for Mac OS X, the file "$SAGE_ROOT/sage-README-osx.txt" contains obsolete parts (the "steps 4 - 6", and the last lines right at the end).

A -bdist'ed OS X .dmg contains another README.txt file of the same outdated content, probably it is just the first one copied during creation of the .dmg.

I don't know how to check whether this "works", but at any rate once Sage is automatically distributed in the app bundle, this should go in. 

I'm also changing priority, since no one has complained in half a year.

This looks fine to me.  Positive review if we ever actually distribute these.

What we really need to do is distribute the notebook binary and also just a regular (perhaps non-bundle) binary, but maybe this is a lot to host when it comes to mirrors?  

Or, again, figure out how to make the app bundle let you choose between command line and notebook.
