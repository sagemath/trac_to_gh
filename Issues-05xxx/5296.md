With the switch to an app bundle distribution for Mac OS X, the file "$SAGE_ROOT/sage-README-osx.txt" contains obsolete parts (the "steps 4 - 6", and the last lines right at the end).

A -bdist'ed OS X .dmg contains another README.txt file of the same outdated content, probably it is just the first one copied during creation of the .dmg.

I don't know how to check whether this "works", but at any rate once Sage is automatically distributed in the app bundle, this should go in. 

I'm also changing priority, since no one has complained in half a year.
