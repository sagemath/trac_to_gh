This sentence, which is in the help for contour_plot, should also be in the help for the plot method on matrices:

```
                        cmap -- the name of
                        a predefined colormap, a list of colors
                        or an instance of a matplotlib Colormap.
                        Type: import matplotlib.cm; matplotlib.cm.datad.keys()
                        for available colormap names.
```

It should also be in the output here too:

```
sage: matrix(QQ,1,1).plot(cmap0=0)

verbose 0 (84: primitive.py, options) WARNING: Ignoring option 'cmap0'=0
verbose 0 (84: primitive.py, options) 
The allowed options for MatrixPlot defined by a 1 x 1 data grid are:
    cmap           the name of a predefined colormap, 
                        a list of colors or an instance of a 
                        matplotlib Colormap.
    zorder         The layer level in which to draw                     
```

This should take care of the issue on the description.  Patch may depend on #6269; even though I can't find any specific instances where they overlap on code hunks, they do overlap in files, so better to be safe.  Note that this patch does not take care of #5083.  I have also added/improved documentation on the files in question.
