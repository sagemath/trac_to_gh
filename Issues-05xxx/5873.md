0) Add support for FreeBSD later than 6.x

1) Explicitly add SAGE_LOCAL to the dependency search path for matplotlib for FreeBSD - superceded by #9202

2) gcc-4.3 on FreeBSD (though not the base gcc4.2) appears to define putchar() in <stdio.h> in a way that breaks the putchar() definitions inside ttconv.  It's not immediately clear what the problem is (since there's no immediately obvious difference in the way putchar() is defined in <stdio.h>) so this patch takes
the easy way out and undef's the offending putchar() macro - no longer needed with gcc-4.5

3) Individual character bounding boxes in AFM files do not have to be integral so convert each bounding box to a list of floats, rather than a list of ints. This corrects a problem where most of the tests would fail with "ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '539.621'" on FreeBSD - now integrated into matplotlib

Upstream: **None of the above - read trac for reasoning.**

5873.matplotlib.patch has been updated for matplotlib-0.99.1.p2.  Of the patches mentioned in the original description, only the first part remains (and is still necessary).

The second part (related to putchar problems with gcc43) has been removed as it's no longer practical to build Sage with gcc43 on FreeBSD.

The third part (related to bounding box conversions) has been removed as an equivalent patch has been integrated into matplotlib-0.99.1

Any thoughts about this Peter? I noticed you created (or at least edited) a wiki page about the FreeBSD port, and still reference this old patch, which is probably no longer needed.

If you wish to create one, I'll try to review it reasonably quickly. It makes review a lot easier if you can include things inside 

``` 
#ifdef FREEBSD 
#endif
```

or if appropriate 

```
#ifdef HAVE_BUGGY_GCC_ON_FREEBSD
#undef putchar
#endif
```
or similar. Otherwise, it requires the reviewer to have a much deeper knowledge of the code to evaluate if the changes are desirable or not. If it can be seen the changes only affect FreeBSD, then it will be much easier to get a positive review. That's been my experience with Solaris and OpenSolaris related problems.

Some of the reason this is unnecessary is probably due to the upgrades in gcc.

I don't understand, though, why the patch for newer FreeBSD is no longer necessary.  [The current mpl source (June 2012)](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/master/setupext.py#L70) does not have it incorporated.

This is weird enough that I'm not putting positive review; it seems like there should be a key error at [this spot](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/master/setupext.py#L184) if we don't have something in the dictionary for this system.

TLDR: you don't need this patch.

The mpl `setupext.py` code in question gets used when there is not an entry for `basedirlist` in `setup.cfg`, in which case it'll grab it from this pre-defined `basedir` dictionary using `sys.platform` as they key. From what I see that's checked into hg for SAGE, you do define `basedirlist` in `setup.cfg`, which is why this patch is un-necessary. The code is in the SPKG `matplotlib.../make-setup-config.py:7`


```
config.set('directories', 'basedirlist', os.environ['SAGE_LOCAL'])
```


which is why this patch is not needed for SPKG matplotlib being built on **any** platform.

From what I understand from the discussion at [Python Bug #12326](http://bugs.python.org/issue12326), it seems like we (MPL) should not have been using `sys.platform` in the first place for making these decisions (but given the somewhat exotic nature of the platforms which have exceptions there now, it's best to remain conservative about re-writing that portion of the code to use something like the `platform` modules). But to reiterate, the approach taken in the SPKG bypasses this fragility for SAGE that is completely platform independent.
