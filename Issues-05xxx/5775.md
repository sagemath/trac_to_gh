To reproduce this: **-bdist**, unpack in some other place, run **make** -> **boom**.

Note that deleting the output directory and restarting **make** gets past this problem.

Cheers,

I don't care too much about this, so I am bumping it to 3.4.2 for now.

I don't see this problem any more. The process of "-bdist", unpack at a different directory, then run "make" works for me with Sage 4.3.2.alpha1. I'm closing this as fixed.
