<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

To reproduce this: **-bdist**, unpack in some other place, run **make** -> **boom**.

Note that deleting the output directory and restarting **make** gets past this problem.

Cheers,

I don't see this problem any more. The process of "-bdist", unpack at a different directory, then run "make" works for me with Sage 4.3.2.alpha1. I'm closing this as fixed.
