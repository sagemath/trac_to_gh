2. Another bug related to __cmp__:   #5758 (weird "hello")

3. __nonzero__ is wrong for ring morphisms, since Sage does have the 0 ring where 0 == 1, so this code was wrong:

```
    def __nonzero__(self):
        return True
```

4. Calling .lift() on a morphism returns None.  This is a bug that was caused by cythonizing morphism.pyx:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]; R.hom([x,x]).lift() is None
True
```

Starting to review this, which is in itself non-trivial!

There is some strange terminology here.  I'm not sure what a "Set-theoretic ring endomorphism of Integer Ring" is meant to be, let alone a "set-theoretic ring".  I think that what is meant is (in the first case) a map between rings which is not a ring homomorphism, such as a section of a surjective map.

Also the term "lift" is used for such a section, i.e. if f:R-->S is the surjective ring hom and h:S-->R is a section (so f(h(s))==s for all s in S) then the map h is being called a lift, where I would say that the element h(s) is a lift of s.  And "cover"?   Here R is being called a cover of S?

I think it would be helpful if somewhere in this file this terminology is defined since not all of it is so standard...

A more proper review will follow.

I agree that the notation could be made more consistent, but this patch simply documents what is there (which is good) and fixes some bugs. 

One thing I noticed, which is not just common to this patch, is that when we return a list that we don't want people to change (e.g. im_gens) we (hopefully) make a copy. This is why tuples were invited, shouldn't we just be using those instead?

Yeah, getting it in should be the main goal here and now.

> One thing I noticed, which is not just common to this patch, is that when we return a list that we don't want people to change (e.g. im_gens) we (hopefully) make a copy. This is why tuples were invited, shouldn't we just be using those instead?


**implemented* instead of **invited*' I assume? 

Either way, can you please open a followup ticket so that this doesn't get lost.
