```
The attached patch contains the following improvements for `mq.SR`:
* faster polynomial_system generation by pre-computing S-Box polynomials
* support for finite extension field elements in `mq.SBox` (needed by mq.SR)
* more module level documentation for `mq.sr`
* new `sbox()` function which returns AES (or SR) `SBox` object
* `AllowZeroInversionsContext()` to handle table creation and such
* more user friendly encryption, i.e. accept more inputs and make sense of them
* `varstr()` function to return a specific string rather than a list of strings using `varstrs()`
* `variable_dict()` function which gives fast access to string -> variable mappings
* ring constructor accepts optional `reverse_variables` parameter now
* `SR_gf2_2` class as example how to customize things
* added `constant_coefficient()` function to `BooleanPolynomial`s (needed by `sbox()`)

This patch applied to my 3.3.rc2 merge tree does pass long doctests.

REVIEW:

# In the file sbox.py

I don't like this:

```
sage: S = mq.SBox([7,6,0,4,2,5,1,3])
sage: S(long(7))
TypeError: object of type 'long' has no len()
```

I don't like this:

```
from sage.all import vector 
```
Could you import it a little more precisely?

I *really* don't like this:

```
sage: S = mq.SBox([7,6,0,4,2,5,1,3])
sage: S([1]*10^6)
outputs a *million page* exception!
```

# sr.py

* I'm glad you're fixing your email address. However, even after this patch there are at least 30 other places in the sage core library with your old address:

```
sage: search_src('malb@informatik.uni-bremen.de')
over 30 lines output
```

* Regarding

```
sage: I.variety() # order is random-ish 
```
You could make the output into a sorted list (instead of a dict) so the output can be checked exactly.

* Here is a backslash without r""":

```
 	1451	        """ 
 	1452	        Return a dictionary to access variables in \code{self.R} by 
 	1453	        their names. 
```

* I wish this function had more tests, which at a minimum illustrated all the options:

```
def inversion_polynomials_single_sbox(self, x=None, w=None, biaffine_only=None, correct_only=None, groebner=False):
```
Right now many of the options aren't tested at all.

`@`informatik.uni-bremen.de still works so I see no rush fixing all those. Also, it seems Uni-Bremen is more generous when it comes to old e-mail addresses, you get to keep them forever. On the other hand, I'm not so sure about RHUL. The main reason I'm adding `M.R.Albrecht` to `sr.py` is to indicate that someone from RHUL worked on this. Since a team from RHUL defined SR in the first place, some people might consider this relevant.

It is printed sorted now, but I didn't change what variety() returns, just the doctest.

That's not much better, since computing len(str(X)) can take a very long time:

```
sage: S = mq.SBox([7,6,0,4,2,5,1,3])
sage: S([1]*10^9)
[wait 15 minutes]
TypeError: Cannot apply SBox to provided element.
```

* "The main reason I'm adding M.R.Albrecht to sr.py is to indicate that someone from RHUL worked on this. Since a team from RHUL defined SR in the first place, some people might consider this relevant."

Wouldnt it then be better to explicitly somehow emphasize that this module is authored by a student at RHUL working with the group that defined SR originally, and maybe give a reference to where it originally appeared (?).  It just seems that you are being perhaps more subtle than necessary. 

* 

```
sage: I.variety() # order is random-ish 
```
"It is printed sorted now, but I didn't change what variety() returns, just the doctest."

That doesn't help at all, since in sage-3.4 variety could suddenly return some wrong points, and this doctest would never catch that. 

* "Note that most options are ignored anyway (as documented in the docstring)."

There could be a test that illustrates the options all being ignored, which is in the TESTS: section. 

I'm going to give this a positive review, since perhaps I'm being overly picky.  I don't feel all my referee remarks were addressed.   I'll leave Martin doing the other changes or not up to his conscious.

Replying to [@williamstein](#comment%3A4):
> That's not much better, since computing len(str(X)) can take a very long time:


 ```
 sage: S = mq.SBox([7,6,0,4,2,5,1,3])
 sage: S([1]*10^9)
 [wait 15 minutes]
 TypeError: Cannot apply SBox to provided element.
 ```

Note that the above example does not show what you mean to show:

```
sage: %time l = [1]*10^9
CPU times: user 11.19 s, sys: 5.13 s, total: 16.32 s
Wall time: 16.31 s
sage: %time len(l)
CPU times: user 0.00 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.00 s
Wall time: 0.00 s
1000000000
```

i.e. you're timing the creation of the list --- which is outside of the `SBox` class.

A reference is already given in the module documentation. I don't think adding an explicit statement about authorship is necessary. It's just when people look explicitly they see it. I have no strong feelings about this either way though so if you feel it would improve things, I can address that.

I don't understand, the doctest is now:

```
   sage: I = F.ideal()
   sage: for V in I.variety():
   ...    for k,v in sorted(V.iteritems()):
   ...       print k,v
   ...    print 
```

how does that allow the addition of wrong points? Do you mean I should evaluate the ideal members on all points to show that the result is correct ... hmmm, I could add that.

> * "Note that most options are ignored anyway (as documented in the docstring)."
> 
> There could be a test that illustrates the options all being ignored, which is in the TESTS: section. 

I'll open a new ticket addressing that.

Argh, I am an idiot. Strike that comment I fully get your point.
