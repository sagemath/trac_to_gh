```
Notice that (ZZ/162ZZ)^* *is* cyclic:

```
sage: R = Integers(162)
sage: R(5).multiplicative_order()
54
sage: euler_phi(162)
54
```

However, Sage gets this totally wrong:

```
sage: R.multiplicative_generator()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: multiplicative group of this ring is not cyclic
```

This bug came up for me today while doing some research.  I'm glad I didn't believe Sage :-).

Positive review.  The code looks ok to me, applies to 3.4.2 and tests pass (I tested abelian_groups and all modular).

No doubt the subgroups function in abelian groups will be superseded one day (after #5882) but that's no reason to stop this.  And both the original bugs are fixed.
