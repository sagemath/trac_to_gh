sage: zeta(CDF(1))


------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occured in SAGE.
This probably occured because a *compiled* component
of SAGE has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
or is not properly wrapped with _sig_on, _sig_off.
You might want to run SAGE under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
SAGE will now terminate (sorry).

<div id="comment:1" align="right">Comment 1</div>

I think Robert Bradshaw massively optimized CDF special functions, and that's where this comes from.  Changing the code for zeta in complex_double.pyx to:

```
        cdef pari_sp sp
        sp = avma
        _sig_on
        x = self._new_from_gen_c(  gzeta(self._gen(), PREC),   sp)
        _sig_off
        return x
```
somewhat fixes the problem, though doing 

```
sage: zeta(CDF(0))
```
then raises a RuntimeError.   Unfortunately, doing this doesn't work because the _sig_on/_sig_off stuff doesn't play well with Cython exceptions:

```
        cdef pari_sp sp
        sp = avma
        try:
           _sig_on
           x = self._new_from_gen_c(  gzeta(self._gen(), PREC),   sp)
           _sig_off
        except:
           raise ValueError
        return x
```

So I'm not sure how to fix this in general in a nice way with the right exception, but definitely adding _sig_on/_sig_off's around all the calls to pari is a very very good idea.

The patch looks fine, but results in zeta of a CDF being approximately fifty times slower.  This seems problematic, and perhaps also something that would happen a lot if we start switching things to mpmath?  Mpmath looks like a great package, but if it has the same issue as NetworkX versus C graphs, we might not want to move default behavior there quite yet. 

Marking as needs_info since there does not seem to be a Sage-wide policy on mpmath at this point, and I am reluctant to give positive review to such a marked slowdown.

Can we think of any other places where this needs to be checked?  For instance, zeta(1) returns this error too, though I think it inherits it from the CC example.  

Also, regarding whether it should be Infinity or some signed infinity:

```

I'm not saying which one is better, just what the current behavior is.  What do folks think?

kcrisman:

Starting with the next version, mpmath uses the Riemann-Siegel formula, so it should be much faster than Pari for large imaginary parts near the critical strip. Right now I even get a segmentation fault if I try to compute zeta(CDF(1/2+10000000*I)) in Sage.

For CDF, zeta could also use mpmath.fp.zeta that will be available in the next version of mpmath. This function is currently typically 10-50 times faster than mpmath.mp.zeta. However, fp.zeta loses accuracy proportional to the magnitude of the imaginary part near the critical strip, so the question is whether this loss would be acceptable. For small imaginary parts, it's quite accurate.

Both functions could be accelerated in Sage by overriding the base case of an internal function (mpmath/functions/zeta.py/_zetasum in the svn trunk, if anyone wants a go). This should require just few lines of Cython.

Other than that, I would recommend keeping Pari where it's faster.

Patch applies cleanly to 4.5.alpha1 and builds fine, but some doctests fail:

```

Moreover, it doesn't seem to live up to the promise in the title of making the return value of zeta(1) consistent:

```

sage: zeta(RDF(1))

```

It's really sad we still have this trivial-to-fix hard crash after over a year!

I've attached a patch that fixes the behavior of CDF(1).zeta() and CC(1).zeta(). It leaves the real fields alone, which I think is fine 'cause they have reasonable representations of (an) infinity, and we usually try to return something of the same type.
