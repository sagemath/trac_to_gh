<a id='comment:1'></a>The problem is that siInit doesn't get called on 64 bit OSX (William and I verified by adding a printf() statement). After this patch it gets called, but the allocation still fails, so we need to dig a little deeper.

As is the patch is not applicable since we open the mangled name, but siInit should be declared `extern "C"` to avoid this.

<a id='comment:5'></a>Hi,

I digged around in the Mac OS X documentation, especially: http://developer.apple.com/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/DynamicLibraries/100-Articles/DynamicLibraryUsageGuidelines.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001928-SW10

In the section about "Opening Dynamic Libraries" there is also something said about closing dynamic libraries. Especially, the dynamic loader might or might not after "dlclose()" remove the library from the applications address space. That would be an explanation for seeing segfaults, I guess.

Now in line 168 of "multi_polynomial_libsingular.pyx", there is a call to "dlclose()", and this call most probably is done before any ring is instantiated. I remember to have seen a file where on Sage shutdown many memory deallocations and such are performed, probably that call to "dlclose()" is done better there (I don't remember what that place was).

See also trac #5522 about issues with whether libsingular was loaded or not.

Cheers, gsw

I cannot confirm this, siInit does get called, I just added a `printf` statement myself.
