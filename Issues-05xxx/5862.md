Sage 3.4.1 or similar segault on startup once the first mv polynomial ring via libSingular is created. This is bad ;)

The problem is that siInit doesn't get called on 64 bit OSX (William and I verified by adding a printf() statement). After this patch it gets called, but the allocation still fails, so we need to dig a little deeper.

As is the patch is not applicable since we open the mangled name, but siInit should be declared `extern "C"` to avoid this.

I did just run `make check` after running `spkg-install` manually, so I assume that a proper `configure` run should result in something useful.

I think the removal of `RTLD_GLOBAL` should not happen. I don't think you need it when using `dlsym()`, but it does not hurt either. As is the patch should not go in since we depend on the mangled name of `siInit` and should declare that function as `extern C` to have an unmangled name.

Hi,

I digged around in the Mac OS X documentation, especially: http://developer.apple.com/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/DynamicLibraries/100-Articles/DynamicLibraryUsageGuidelines.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001928-SW10

In the section about "Opening Dynamic Libraries" there is also something said about closing dynamic libraries. Especially, the dynamic loader might or might not after "dlclose()" remove the library from the applications address space. That would be an explanation for seeing segfaults, I guess.

Now in line 168 of "multi_polynomial_libsingular.pyx", there is a call to "dlclose()", and this call most probably is done before any ring is instantiated. I remember to have seen a file where on Sage shutdown many memory deallocations and such are performed, probably that call to "dlclose()" is done better there (I don't remember what that place was).

See also trac #5522 about issues with whether libsingular was loaded or not.

Cheers, gsw

<div id="comment:7" align="right">Comment 7</div>

Here's what I believe is the cause of the problem:

When oMalloc creates a new bucket it assigns the global `om_ZeroPage` to `s_bin->bin->current_page` in `omBin.c`, a NULL pointer so to speak. 

It is defined in `om_Alloc.c` as `omBinPage_t om_ZeroPage[] = {{0, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL}};`. In `omInsertBinPage` it checks whether the current page is this zero page and this is where things go wrong. It should detect that it indeed deals with the zero page and take another code path. However, for some reason there are at least two `om_ZeroPage` objects around, i.e. the pointer comparison fails. 

Linker fun ahead!

Positive review on spkg and patch. Everything looks kosher inside the spkg. 

Of the doctest failures gen.pyx is a real issue, the other two have been fixed by the first two patches at #5929.

W00t - thanks malb :)
