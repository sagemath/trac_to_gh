This problem is specific to attaching files ending with ".py" in the notebook.  It does not seem to affect the command-line, or files ending with ".sage".  Some files that are moved around from different filesystems and editors end up having end-of-line commands that look like: "\r\n".  These raise a syntax error when attached.  Here is an example (of course you need to change the path):

```
testfile = file('/home/marshall/Desktop/misc/testrn.py','w')
testfile.write('my_var = 2\r\n')
testfile.close()
attach /home/marshall/Desktop/misc/testrn.py

    Syntax Error:
        attach /home/marshall/Desktop/misc/testrn.py
```
