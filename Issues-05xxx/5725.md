Bring up the coverage of sequence.py from 59% to 100%.  Also, sequences allowed hashing even when they are mutable which *breaks* all the Python algorithms that rely on hashing!  This was because I didn't understand this fast about Python when I implemented Sequences.  

If there is any fallout as a result of eliminating hashing, then that other code must be fixed, because it would surely exhibit subtle bugs.
