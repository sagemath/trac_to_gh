Hi,

Note that trac-5969-part4.patch removes the abvarsub modular symbols functions for torsion, since I found that they are buggy and not finished.  The same functionality is already available in the modular abelian varieties code anyways, so this is no real loss.

The "part2" patch changes some things in `matrix/matrix_integer_dense.pyx`, and that causes two doctest failures:

```

sage -t -long "devel/sage/sage/modules/fg_pid/fgp_module.py"
**********************************************************************
File "/mnt/usb1/scratch/ghitza/sage-4.3.5-sage.math.washington.edu-x86_64-Linux/devel/sage/sage/modules/fg_pid/fgp_module.py", line 1131:
    sage: phi = Q.hom([0,V.0,V.1]); phi

Got:
    Morphism from module over Integer Ring with invariants (2, 0, 0) to module with invariants (0, 0, 0) that sends the generators to [(0, 0, 0), (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0)]

    sage: phi(Q.1)
Expected:
    (0, 0, 1)
Got:
    (1, 0, 0)
**********************************************************************
```

It was not obvious to me whether this was harmless or an actual problem.

The rest looks good, there are a couple of docstring fixes but I have a reviewer patch that can take care of them.
