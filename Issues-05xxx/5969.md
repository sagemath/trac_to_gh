It was not obvious to me whether this was harmless or an actual problem.

The rest looks good, there are a couple of docstring fixes but I have a reviewer patch that can take care of them.

It turns out that part 2 fixes a *MAJOR* bug in SNF for matrices over ZZ in an edge case.  The doctest in finitely generated modules was just wrong (ouch).    I carefully checked through this with Robert Bradshaw, and posted a patch that updates the doctest.
