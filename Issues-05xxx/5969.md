Hi,

Note that trac-5969-part4.patch removes the abvarsub modular symbols functions for torsion, since I found that they are buggy and not finished.  The same functionality is already available in the modular abelian varieties code anyways, so this is no real loss.

I just checked that all four patches apply fine to sage-4.3.5 still with no rebasing necessary.

The "part2" patch changes some things in `matrix/matrix_integer_dense.pyx`, and that causes two doctest failures:

```

Got:
    Morphism from module over Integer Ring with invariants (2, 0, 0) to module with invariants (0, 0, 0) that sends the generators to [(0, 0, 0), (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0)]

    sage: phi(Q.1)

    (0, 0, 1)
Got:

**********************************************************************
```

It was not obvious to me whether this was harmless or an actual problem.

The rest looks good, there are a couple of docstring fixes but I have a reviewer patch that can take care of them.

It turns out that part 2 fixes a *MAJOR* bug in SNF for matrices over ZZ in an edge case.  The doctest in finitely generated modules was just wrong (ouch).    I carefully checked through this with Robert Bradshaw, and posted a patch that updates the doctest.

Note that the part1 patch applies with some fuzz to sage-4.4.rc0, but it's fine.
