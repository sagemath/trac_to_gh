Roi Docampo and I noticed the following at Sage Days 14.

This works:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = ZZ[]
sage: R.quo(R.ideal(2))
Quotient of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Integer Ring by the ideal (2)
```

But this doesn't:

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: R.quo(R.ideal(2))

<a id='comment:7'></a>
I made the following proposition:

Suppose that `R = PolynomialRing(S,'x')` for some ring `S`, and `f` is a polynomial over `S`. 
* Keep the same thing if `f` has degree `> 0` or `f` is a unit, that is return `PolynomialQuotientRing(S, f, 'x')`;
* Return `PolynomialRing(S.quo(f), 'x')` when `f` is a non-unit constant.

In particular:

```
sage: R = ZZ['x']
sage: R.quo(2)
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Ring of integers modulo 2 (using NTL)
```

Does this make sense?

What do you suggest? I can imagine three solutions:
* Make `R.quotient_by_principal_ideal(R.ideal(2))` return a `Polynomial_quotient_ring`: I doubt this is in principle impossible, but at least it requires quite a lot of changes. 
* Keep `R.quotient_by_principal_ideal(R.ideal(2))` return a `TypeError`
* Implement a `lift` method for `PolynomialRing_dense_mod_p`.

None of the three solutions is really fine to my mind, so feel free to suggest another one!
