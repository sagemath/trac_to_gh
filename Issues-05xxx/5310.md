This addition of Msieve will hopefully enhance Sage's Integer Factorization ability for all integers of a reasonable size, and provide the opportunity for users to utilize the Number Field Sieve.

http://309codesign.com/code/

An explanation of Msieve from its documentation:
"There are plenty of algorithms for performing integer factorization. 
The Msieve library implements most of them from scratch, and relies on
optional external libraries for the rest of them. Trial division and
Pollard Rho is used on all inputs; if the result is less than 25 digits 
in size, tiny custom routines do the factoring. For larger numbers, the code
switches to the GMP-ECM library and runs the P-1, P+1 and ECM algorithms,
expending a user-configurable amount of effort to do so. If these do not 
completely factor the input number, the library switches to the heavy  
artillery. Unless told otherwise, Msieve runs the self-initializing quadratic
sieve algorithm, and if this doesn't factor the input number then you've
found a library problem. If you know what you're doing, Msieve also contains
a complete implementation of the number field sieve, that has helped complete
some of the largest public factorization efforts known."
and
"To be as fast as possible. I claim (without proof) that for
          completely factoring general inputs between 40 and 100 digits
          in size, Msieve is faster than any other code implementing any
          other algorithm."

For mpQS vs. msieve Bill Hart has some numbers: 

```
Anything over about 75 digits will be much slower on mpQS than on 
msieve, due to the fact that the latter implements the double large 
prime variant and I don't. But the time for the second factorization 
is 15min 35s in mpQS. 

Here are some other times:

So for smaller numbers, mpQS is faster than msieve. I just haven't 
worked on speeding it up for numbers of 75 digits and more.

So I can't build this on either of my main devel machines, so it's hard to go anywhere with.

`EXAMPLE:` and `EXAMPLES:` should have a double-colon (`::`).

The indentation of the results in the first examples block looks strange; they should line up with the `sage:` prompt.

Haven't tested, but one should make sure that all temporary files are created in or below `SAGE_TMP` (or `SAGE_TMPDIR`?) [at least] during doctesting, since they should also pass if the user doesn't have write access on the Sage installation tree.

More or less I copied the TMPDIR part from qsieve.py , so this shouldn't be a problem.

Examples are marked as optional now and in case msieve isn't installed there is warning.

There was already a discussion about adding msieve in 2009.

> [...] in case msieve isn't installed there is warning.

How about printing that message and raising `NotImplementedError` (or `RuntimeError`)?

That way other (higher-level) functions can call `msieve()` and catch these exceptions.

We could also put the "warning" into the message of the exception, such that the output isn't messed up by just trying to call `msieve()` (from other parts of Sage).




*SAGE* should be *Sage* btw.




The `TMPDIR` environment variable must not be modified globally; if there's no other way to tell `msieve` where it should put temporary files, a modified environment has to be passed to `msieve`.

explaining the problem and send the relevant part of

If you want to try to fix the problem yourself, *don't* just cd to

Instead, the following commands setup all environment variables
correctly and load a subshell for you to debug the error:
(cd '/localdisk/tmp/sage-4.7.2/spkg/build/msieve-1.49.p0' && '/localdisk/tmp/sage-4.7.2/sage' -sh)
When you are done debugging, you can type "exit" to leave the
subshell.

The fails on my OpenSolaris box, and I can see will fail on any sort of Solaris system. These lines:

```
if [ "`uname -m`" = "SunOS" ]; then
    $MAKE generic ECM=1
fi
```

make no sense, as the -m option to 'uname' is defined by POSIX to return the hardware, not the operating system. See:

http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/uname.html

So it produces:

```
drkirkby@hawk:~$ uname -m
i86pc
```

and on a SPARC would produce something different, like sun4m, sun4u, sun4v and possibly something else for the newer processors. On my old SPARC

```
-bash-3.00$ uname -m
sun4u
```


Rather than invoke the external program 'uname', it is better to use the sage variable UNAME. The following is the most robust way of testing a variable, which will work for any shell, and pretty much any circumstances. 

```
if [ "x$UNAME" = xSunOS ] ; then
```

There's nothing to build a 64-bit version on Solaris - the SAGE64 variable is not used. 

I also got another failure:

```

sage: An error occurred while installing msieve-1.49.p0
```

I suspect this is picking up the Solaris version of patch, not the GNU one which is part of Sage, though I've never seen this issue before. 

Also, this seems a bit pointless

```
$CP msieve "$SAGE_LOCAL"/bin/
```

We should just call 'cp' directly. Variables are useful for programs like "make", but not for a simple copy like this. 

The whole of spkg-install is a bit of a mess. It basically needs a total re-write. 

Also, there is no spkg-check file.

Changed to an experimental package in order to get into Sage for 64-bit systems, seems to work fine on those. Reasonably tested with good speed and documentation for main function provided, may be useful to include additional doctests.

I managed to build the git branch, but I failed to install the upstream package
(renamed to msieve-1.49.tar.gz as mentioned in the description above):

```

```
What did I do wrong?
