This is pretty worrying:

```

So something is going a bit wrong when multiplying trivial_character(16) by another character.

I thought I had fixed this one, as part of #5648: there was a bug with arithmetic operations on characters whose parents had the same moduli but different zeta orders. But it looks like it isn't fixed after all.

Well, I've tracked down the problem, but I'm not sure what the "right" fix is. (There are several possibilities.)

Amusingly, it's not actually the trivial character that causes trouble directly -- it's the other character here. (The exception gets raised trying to raise `psi` above to a power.) Here's what's going on ... the trivial character gets created in the group of characters of conductor 16 and whose only value can be 1:

```
sage: id = trivial_character(16)
sage: id.parent()
Group of Dirichlet characters of modulus 16 over Rational Field
sage: id.parent().zeta_order()
1
```

Then the nontrivial character of conductor 4 gets coerced in, which actually works -- but that's the character that causes trouble: 

```
sage: H = DirichletGroup(4,base_ring=QQ)
sage: psi = id.parent()(H.0)
sage: psi.values()
BOOM!
```

In some sense, this is silly: it should at least have `zeta_order` give 2, since there are two roots of unity in `QQ`. However, the other issue is that coercing `H.0` into `id.parent()` should never have worked -- its order doesn't divide the `zeta_order` of `id.parent()`, so it should have died there. Then step 1 is to make the call `id.parent()(H.0)` fail. 

Of course, now that just makes the call to `half_integral_weight_modform_basis` fail -- so we need to do something there. We have (at least) two choices:

* change the `trivial_character` call to give `zeta_order=2`
* change `half_integral.py` so that it calls differently.

I think the first is probably the more pragmatic choice, though maybe less "philosophically correct"?

I've attached a patch that does the former.

There is a bit more too this, though.

Basically, the whole Dirichlet character machinery goes a bit mad whenever you have two Dirichlet characters with the same modulus and base ring, but where the zeta orders aren't the same. For a start, the parent DirichletGroups compare as equal but their elements are different -- or at least they will be if we fix the !__call!__ method properly.

Similarly, arithmetic coercion is screwed up, in some interesting ways:

```
sage: K.<w> = NumberField(x^2 + x + 1)
sage: G2 = DirichletGroup(7, K, zeta_order=2, zeta=K(-1))
sage: G3 = DirichletGroup(7, K, zeta_order=3, zeta=w)
sage: G2.0 * G3.0
```

Here the coercion model will fail miserably to find the right parent. 

One option would be to prevent Dirichlet groups ever being created for which the zeta order is not maximal for the given base ring. This would sort of work, but would restrict us to Dirichlet groups over integral domains (so we can guarantee that the group of roots of unity in the ring is cyclic) and it would make it a pain to implement base extension (at present the base_extend method for DirichletGroup_class just base extends the zeta element it already knows about.

The alternative is to be "honest" and make Dirichlet groups with the same modulus and base ring but different zeta order into genuinely different objects, comparing as unequal and with different string representations. One can then sort out coercion arithmetic using the machinery from sage.categories.pushout; I coded this up as an experiment (creating a class "DirichletGroupExtensionFunctor" whose effect was to extend Dirichlet groups by adding an nth root of unity into their value group). But it's a bit of a cheat since my "functors" aren't actually functors in any natural category I can think of.
