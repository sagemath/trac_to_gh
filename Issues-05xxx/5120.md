Class deriving from sage.structure.UniqueRepresentation inherit a
unique representation behavior for their instances (and consistent
default implementations of equality testing, copying, pickling, ...).

See the documentation for a brief discussion of the relative merits of
UniqueRepresentation? and UniqueFactory?.

As a prerequisite, this patch implements sage.misc.ClasscallMetaclass,
a (trivial) metaclass for customizing class calls via a static method
of the class.

This class is used extensively in upcoming sage-combinat patches:
- #5879 (crystals)
- #5891 categories
- free modules
- automatic monoid

~500 lines of doctest for 15 lines of code

**Assignee:** @nthiery

**CC:**  sage-combinat

**Keywords:** unique representation

**Resolution:** fixed

Replying to [nthiery](#comment%3A12):

I deleted the old patch.

> Michael: could we change the milestone to 3.4.2?


The assignment of milestones is generally insignificant (an exception is like right now when 3.4.2.rc0 was the last merge release and we are in blocker fixes only mode), but as long as this ticket would have gotten a positive review it would have had a chance to go into 3.4.2 regardless which milestone it would have been assigned to.

This patch is also a new design pattern which warrants to be mentioned on sage-devel. It seems to be very well documented and AFAIK it should be properly covered :)

Cheers,

Michael
