Right now sage consider that there is no empty permutations.

```
sage: [] in Permutations()
False
```
There seems to be an agreement about the fact that the empty permutations exists ! Indeed there exists an empty set, and there exits exactly one function from the empty set to itself which is clearly bijective.

The patch solve this defect:

```
sage: import sage_emacs as emacs
sage: [] in Permutations()
True
sage: Permutations(0).list()
[[]]
sage: Permutations(0).count()
1
```
