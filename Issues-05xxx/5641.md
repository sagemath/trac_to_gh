<a id='comment:1'>Comment 1:</a>
Still broken, though now all three have the latter error message.  I'm not sure I like this even being possible:

```
sage: A = matrix(QQ,5,0)
sage: A.rows()
[(), (), (), (), ()]
```
Does this have meaning?

Anyway, the error is raised while trying to acquire a colormap in matplotlib in imshow, and then Numpy doesn't like one of the inputs.  Having a Numpy or matplotlib-native version of this would be helpful - maybe the problem is upstream?  Or maybe we're just using it wrong and should have a special thing for plotting empty matrices... ??
