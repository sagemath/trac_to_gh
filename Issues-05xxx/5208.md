Calls to left_kernel() don't properly filter down the class hierarchy for matrices, and so do not always use the most efficient algorithm available.  The transcript below illustrates the difference in time for a mathematically equivalent computation on a random 200 x 200 matrix of two-digit integers.

```
sage: a = random_matrix(ZZ, 200, 200, x=100).change_ring(QQ)

sage: time a.transpose().right_kernel()

Vector space of degree 200 and dimension 0 over Rational Field
Basis matrix:
0 x 200 dense matrix over Rational Field
Time: CPU 0.18 s, Wall: 0.18 s

sage: time a.left_kernel()

Vector space of degree 200 and dimension 0 over Rational Field
Basis matrix:
0 x 200 dense matrix over Rational Field
CPU time: 70.76 s,  Wall time: 71.55 s

<a id='comment:1'></a>Attachment [trac_5208_kernels.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket5208/trac_5208_kernels.patch) by @rbeezer created at 2009-02-08 22:52:12

High-level code has been renamed from left_kernel() to simply kernel() to maintain consistency with derived classes.  So kernel() is no longer an alias for left_kernel().

right_kernel() is mostly unchanged, calls kernel() on transpose.

left_kernel() now just calls kernel().  This should all ensure the proper versions of kernel() in derived classes are reached.

Doctests for kernel() and left_kernel() are identical except for names used in explanations and the actual calls.  Doctests for right_kernel now have "right" in explantions, otherwise unchanged.

Each of the three versions has a doctest with a symmetric 500 x 500 matrix of rational entries, which requires about 3 seconds of overhead and 1 second for the actual kernel call when patched.  Unpatched version 3.2.3 will take 589 seconds for left_kernel() on this example.  Runtimes seem to be O(n-cubed) if a smaller (faster) example is better.

Timings on patched versions suggest that for rational matrices, the overhead in right_kernel() of transposing the matrix twice has the effect of doubling the runtime versus left_kernel.

One little thing which doesn't matter too much:

```
if K is not None:

is a bit easier to read than

```
if not K is None:

Should we engage the battle here with these three instances?  ;-)  I'd be happy to add another patch (though I'm not sure how to mark the title).
