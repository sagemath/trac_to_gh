Calls to left_kernel() don't properly filter down the class hierarchy for matrices, and so do not always use the most efficient algorithm available.  The transcript below illustrates the difference in time for a mathematically equivalent computation on a random 200 x 200 matrix of two-digit integers.

```
sage: a = random_matrix(ZZ, 200, 200, x=100).change_ring(QQ)

sage: time a.transpose().right_kernel()

Vector space of degree 200 and dimension 0 over Rational Field
Basis matrix:
0 x 200 dense matrix over Rational Field
Time: CPU 0.18 s, Wall: 0.18 s

sage: time a.left_kernel()

Vector space of degree 200 and dimension 0 over Rational Field
Basis matrix:
0 x 200 dense matrix over Rational Field
CPU time: 70.76 s,  Wall time: 71.55 s

Attachment: **[trac_5208_kernels.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket5208/trac_5208_kernels.patch.gz)**

High-level code has been renamed from left_kernel() to simply kernel() to maintain consistency with derived classes.  So kernel() is no longer an alias for left_kernel().

right_kernel() is mostly unchanged, calls kernel() on transpose.

left_kernel() now just calls kernel().  This should all ensure the proper versions of kernel() in derived classes are reached.

Doctests for kernel() and left_kernel() are identical except for names used in explanations and the actual calls.  Doctests for right_kernel now have "right" in explantions, otherwise unchanged.

Each of the three versions has a doctest with a symmetric 500 x 500 matrix of rational entries, which requires about 3 seconds of overhead and 1 second for the actual kernel call when patched.  Unpatched version 3.2.3 will take 589 seconds for left_kernel() on this example.  Runtimes seem to be O(n-cubed) if a smaller (faster) example is better.

Timings on patched versions suggest that for rational matrices, the overhead in right_kernel() of transposing the matrix twice has the effect of doubling the runtime versus left_kernel.

One little thing which doesn't matter too much:

```
if K is not None:
```

is a bit easier to read than

Replying to [@mwhansen](#comment%3A3):

I agree that the orginal phrasing is awkward to read the first time you see it.  But it's lots of places, in the matrix code it occurs this way whenever the cache is queried.  Across all of the source, grep gives me 627 instances of "is None", with 606 of those being "is not None"

Should we engage the battle here with these three instances?  ;-)  I'd be happy to add another patch (though I'm not sure how to mark the title).
