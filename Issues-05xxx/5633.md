The documentation has been missing a few pictures, and this patch restores them.

(The patch is a little large and only includes the four missing pictures -- no changes to the code at all -- so I decided not to upload it here.  It's at [http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/palmieri/patches/pic.patch](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/palmieri/patches/pic.patch).)
