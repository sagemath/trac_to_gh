The documentation has been missing a few pictures, and this patch restores them.

(The patch is a little large and only includes the four missing pictures -- no changes to the code at all -- so I decided not to upload it here.  It's at [http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/palmieri/patches/pic.patch](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/palmieri/patches/pic.patch).)

This patch will need to be accomplished by a patch that adds those file to MANIFEST.in. Otherwise the repo will be broken for a fresh build.

The patch is fine, it isn't too large and we just don't want spkgs attached here.

I am not happy with the MANIFEST.in changes since if one does build the documentation using pngs instead of jsmath you end up with a boatload of crap in the spkg. You should add the four files explicitly to MANIFEST.in - this is the only true and optimal patch IMHO.
