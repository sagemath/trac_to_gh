If you make a symbolic link to SAGE_ROOT, then doctesting will not work at all:

sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/plot/plot3d/parametric_plot3d.py" 
  File "./parametric_plot3d.py", line 18
    from devel/sage/sage/plot/plot3d/parametric_plot3d import *
              ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

	 [0.8 s]
exit code: 1024
 
```

The reason for this is related to *my* bugfix for testing files outside the tree.  Basically, that we're in the tree is not detected correctly in the case of symlinks, so the doctest program decides we are not in the tree, hence tries to import the function.  This, of course, fails. 

Ideas for solutions:
  
1. Use a different command line option for testing outside tree.
 
2. Improve detection of whether or not in Sage tree. 


Component: **doctest coverage**

I think the "scripts_doctest" patch at #6645 fixes this problem by using `os.path.realpath()` to expand symbolic links.

If this is true, please consider closing this ticket if/when #6645 merges.
