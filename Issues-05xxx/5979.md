```
In Parent, there is a (previously implicit) invariant, namely that:

    self._element_init_pass_parent == guess_pass_parent(between ._element_constructor)

This invariant was broken when self._element_constructor was set from
self._element_constructor_ by __call__. This made the parent not to be
passed properly to _element_constructor.

This patch fixes this (one line), and adds a corresponding doctest.
It also includes a related trivial fix to a line that is apparently never used in coerce_maps, and adds a comment about this.

The category patch #5891 depends heavily on this one, as this way of
setting _element_constructor becomes the default one for simple
parents.
