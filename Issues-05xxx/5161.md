sage-env sets a bunch of environment variables like SHAREFLAGS that cause trouble on Cygwin and Solaris and are also pretty outdated. Setting global flags should be handled in a cleaner matter in case they are required, so for now remove the code from sage-env. It does break previously working setups and has cost me considerable time to work around before I discovered that the problem was introduced by sage-env.

Cheers,

Michael
