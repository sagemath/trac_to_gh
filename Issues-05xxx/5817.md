I've release FLINT 1.2.5. This fixes a serious error that existed in
zn_poly-0.8. Unbeknownst to me, David Harvey had already fixed this
issue in zn_poly-0.9 but I had not realised that had been released,
due to him changing institutions and me not updating my link to his
webpage in my frequently visited tabs list. FLINT now uses zn_poly-0.9
by default for polynomial arithmetic over Z/nZ in zmod_poly.

There is still an issue with z_factor which fails to factor some
numbers very rarely (it prints a message to say it has failed). Tom
Boothby is working on a fix, and this should also speed up the
factorisation function noticeably.

Bill.

After fixing the build problem above, I can replicate mabshoff's doctest failure.

However, if one tries the computation directly, it gives the correct answer:

```
sage: S.<t> = PowerSeriesRing(Integers(1331), default_prec=4)

Here is a simpler failure case:

```
sage: S.<t> = PolynomialRing(Integers(14641))
sage: f = 1 + 9581*t
sage: g = 1 + 4334*t
sage: R = PolynomialRing(Integers(1331), "t")
sage: ff = f.change_ring(R)
sage: gg = g.change_ring(R)
sage: ff
264*t + 1
sage: gg
341*t + 1
sage: ff * gg
925*t^2 + 605*t + 1
sage: (264 * 341) % 1331
847
```

So the `t^2` coefficient is wrong.

Somewhere some coefficients are not being reduced properly:

```
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(Integers(121))
sage: S.<y> = PolynomialRing(Integers(11))
sage: S(50*x)
6*y
sage: R(S(50*x))
50*x     # !!!!!!
```

This happens for both the flint-1.2.4.p2 and flint-1.2.5 spkgs.
