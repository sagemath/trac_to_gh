```
The `hasse_invariant` of a quadratic form doesn't match the standard invariant (brauer class) for quaternion algebras (e.g. for ternary quadratic forms, the ramification of the corresponding quaternion algebra).

The `clifford_invariant` can defined in terms of the clifford algebra of the quadratic form. See Lam (AMS GSM 67) p. 117 for the definition, and p. 119 for the formula relating it to the Hasse invariant.

It also has the property that hyperbolic spaces have `clifford_invariant == +1` at all primes.

It also makes more sense to define a `clifford_conductor` instead of a `hasse_conductor` as the product of all the primes with `clifford_invariant == -1`.
