Currently when encountering assumptions in Maxima we send two CTRL-C and then rerun the computation with assumptions set. This is slow, not particularly robust, i.e. it regularly fails on 64 bit OSX, Solaris and so on. The two patches by Gonzalo do fix the problem.

Note that this came up during the debugging of the ecl->clisp switch, but all that has been moved to #6024.

Cheers,

Michael

Comment for [attachment: trac_5929-fix_assumption_hang.patch:.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket5929/782422236d7863ed31262af32916b34a.gz)

For #5929: fix hang in maxima/ecl due to assumption questions

When maxima asks a question, current code sends CTRL-C
twice to break, then raises an exception. This used to work with
clisp, but for ecl it actually hangs. A test case is given by

```
var("Ax,Bx,By")
t = -Ax*sin(sqrt(Ax^2)/2)/(sqrt(Ax^2)*sqrt(By^2 + Bx^2))
limit(t, Ax=0)
```

It turns out that it is possible to "break" from the question by just
sending ";" by itself to maxima. The current patch changes to this
method of escaping. It works with clisp or ecl.

For #5929: fix timeout in maxima/ecl due to out-of-synch condition

This is triggered by the following doctest

```
sage: maxima._sendstr('1/1'*500)
sage: maxima('2+2')
```
In fact, the first line is missing a semicolon, so maxima is stuck out
of synch; the synchronization code is run for the second line, and
after a timeout, it tries to break by sending a ctrl-c (this happens
in Expect._interrupt()), but ctrl-c is broken with ecl, so this hangs.

The current fix adds an explicit semicolon to the synchronization
code. This fixes the timeout in the above doctest. The hang is still
latent, because there seems to be no way to interrupt maxima/ecl.
