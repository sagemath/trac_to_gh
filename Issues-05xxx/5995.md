This is pretty poor, IMHO:

```
sage: M = ModularForms(17, 4)
sage: S = M.cuspidal_submodule()
sage: M.0 == S.0
True
sage: M.0 in S
False
```

As far as I can tell at a glance this is happening because `S.__call__(x)` tests whether or not the parent of x has a canonical inclusion map to S; it should probably be testing whether the parent of x has a canonical inclusion map to the *ambient space* of S.

Once the above is fixed we should also have a method `is_cuspidal()` for modular forms objects, which would be secretly just `self in self.parent().cuspidal_submodule()`. A corresponding `is_eisenstein()` would be good, too.
