Isn't the current list of software is on the wiki at
http://wiki.sagemath.org/standard_packages_available_for_SAGE?
The list you have in the patch and that list from the wiki don't
agree.

I think the current list is actually in [http://sagemath.org/packages/standard/](http://sagemath.org/packages/standard/) or $SAGE_ROOT/spkg/installed, and the list there doesn't match the one in the installation guide or the one on the wiki.

Anyway, here's a patch (apply on top of the old one) with a new list.
