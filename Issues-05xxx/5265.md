```
Right now we link the matrix_mod2_dense.pyx aginst libpng:

```
     Extension('sage.matrix.matrix_mod2_dense',
               sources = ['sage/matrix/matrix_mod2_dense.pyx'],
               libraries = ['gmp','m4ri', 'png', 'gd']),
```
We need to link against png12 since the new libpng.spkg will only provide libpng12.*.

Cheers,

Michael
