```
We get this: 

```
sage: R=IntegerModRing(8)
sage: m=matrix(R,2,[2,1,3,3]);
sage: m.inverse()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: self must be an integral domain.
```

The inverse operation for matrices over non integral domain, in particular for over integer mod rings, is a missing feature. Somebody should *definitely* implement this.  A
first reasonable thing would be "lift to ZZ, invert, reduce".

Keywords: **inverse**

Component: **linear algebra**

Positive review: applies fine to 3.4.1.apha0 and tests in the file changed pass.

I was disappointed that the similar thing does not work for residue rings of number field rings of integers, since I thought I had fixed it so that the reduction maps worked ok, but unfortunately that only works for residue fields, not residue rings.  (Even then, you have to say OK.residue_field(P) and not OK.quotient(P) for it to work properly).

Never mind, this patch is still good!

You have a slightly misformatted docstring which the second patch fixes.

That sounds very useful.  normally I never use the notebook interface, but with this I can see myself using it to test docstring formats if nothing else!
