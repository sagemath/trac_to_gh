```
Changes between ecm-6.2.3 and ecm-6.3:
* New assembly code for 64-bit PowerPC (thanks to Philip McLaughlin)
* Allow several processes to write to the same -save file
* More routines in new P+-1 stage 2 use multi-threading in OpenMP build
* Fixed incompatibility with GMP 5.0.0
* Fixed several bugs, and now check return value from malloc() calls
* Fixed linking of GMP which prevented successful builds under Darwin 
  (and presumably other systems)
* Allow use of x86_64 asm code under MinGW

Changes between ecm-6.2.2 and ecm-6.2.3:
* Fixed incompatibility with GMP 4.3.0 when testing version in configure
* SSE2 asm code for Visual C added in stage 2 NTT code
* Small improvement to x86_64 mulredc asm code, slight speedup on Core 2
* Fixed incorrect carry propagation in subquadratic REDC code which
  could lead to incorrect arithmetic in rare cases
* Fixed memory leak with -v parameter when factor was found in ECM stage 1
* Fixed bug which caused only one ECM curve to be run in spite of -c
  parameter if input line did not end in newline
* Assembler mulredc code enabled by default on x86_64

Changes between ecm-6.2.1 and ecm-6.2.2:
* Updated build project files for Visual C by Brian Gladman, also adds
missing NTT_GFP_TWIDDLE_DI[FT]_BREAKOVER defines in VC parameter file
* Fixed uninitialised parameter to P-1 probability computation
* In tune.c : fixed generation of NTT_GFP_TWIDDLE_DI[FT]_BREAKOVER values,
avoid calling cputime() excessively often when timing short functions,
fixed access to uninitialised memory
* Fixed serious split infinitive in configure script (thanks Paul Leyland)
* Removed unnecessary carry propagation in x86_64 mulredc code, slight
speedup (thanks Philip McLaughlin)
* Fixed non-portable PIC code in x86_64/redc.asm
* Fixed problem with pattern matching host type names in configure.in
* Converted binary constants in spv.c and ntt_gfp.c to hexadecimal,
some assembler do not support binary constants

**New spkg:** [http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/leif/Sage/spkgs/ecm-6.3.p2.spkg](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/leif/Sage/spkgs/ecm-6.3.p2.spkg)

**md5sum:** `a19f3d4d0e9881abe076d8a9c0ea7e7f  ecm-6.3.p2.spkg`




Apply [attachment: trac_5847-module_list-fix_execstack-sagelib-rebased_to_4.7.1.alpha4.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket5847/trac_5847-module_list-fix_execstack-sagelib-rebased_to_4.7.1.alpha4.patch.gz) **to the Sage library**.

(Should be applied *after* installing the new spkg.)

**Note that this patch is only required (i.e., mandatory) on some Fedora and potentially other SELinux-enabled systems**, and apparently only in conjunction with more recent versions of GCC (>= 4.6).

I.e., you should be able to use the new GMP-ECM spkg on other systems without installing any patches or other spkgs.

I think you may need the latest 6.3

 ./configure --with-gmp=/usr/local/
make -j
make -j check
and it passed
without specifing where gmp/mpir is , it got very confused , , they have their
search paths mixed up.

There is a 6.3 spkg at http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mhansen/ecm-6.3.spkg

I've checked that it works with MPIR 2.1.1 and all tests pass.

Since MPIR 2.1.1 has a bug (see #9837), I've (successfully) built and tested Sage 4.6.prealpha3 (see #9343 and [the NewPARI Wiki page](http://wiki.sagemath.org/NewPARI)) **with GMP 5.0.1** and this new ECM 6.3 spkg on Ubuntu 10.04 x86_64 (Core2, gcc 4.4.3; parallel build from scratch with 32 jobs; native code with O3).

`ptestlong` passed all tests.

It also passed `ptestlong` on the same machine with Sage **4.5.3.alpha2** and **MPIR** 2.1.1 (because the MPIR bug apparently only shows up in combination with the new PARI package, which isn't included in that Sage version).

Same for Fedora 13 x86 (Pentium 4 Prescott, gcc 4.4.4, parallel build with 6 jobs, rest dito).

I've added a reviewer patch (ordinary context diff) with some changes:

* Remove also the manual page of previous installations.
* Typo: `rm -r` -> `rm -f` (header file)
* Removed setting of `CXXFLAGS`, since we don't have C++ code.
* Don't overwrite `CFLAGS` if `SAGE64=yes` (instead, append). Removed `-O2 -g` in that case. Make use of `CFLAG64` if set.
* Quote `$SAGE_LOCAL` in the parameters to `configure`, too.
* Use `$MAKE` in `spkg-check`, too.
* Some messages changed (e.g. all failures now starting with *"Error"*), some added.
* A few comments/notes added (`SPKG.txt`, `spkg-install`).

If you're ok with the changes, I can replace the diff with a Mercurial patch. Or simply merge them...

Well, I think these are the relevant parts:

```
...
checking whether we can link against GMP... yes
checking if gmp.h version and libgmp version are the same... (5.0.1/5.0.1) yes
checking for __gmpn_add_nc... yes
checking for __gmpn_mod_34lsub1... yes
checking for __gmpn_redc_1... no
...
configure: Using asm redc code from directory powerpc64
...
```

So it's probably an upstream problem, either MPIR or ECM.

Or should we pass `-force_cpusubtype_ALL`? (To the assembler?) I think rather not.

What happens on other PPCs?

Can you try installing it with GMP 5.0.1?

Jeroen, can you try configuring with `--disable-asm-redc`?

(The 64-bit PPC asm code is new in 6.3 btw.)

A remark about installing with GMP 5. On Gentoo I had to apply the following
for it to compile

```
	# fixes for gmp-5
	sed -i "s:__GMP_BITS_PER_MP_LIMB:GMP_LIMB_BITS:g" bestd.c mpmod.c \
		schoen_strass.c sp.h || die "failed to patch files for gmp-5"
```
This is backward compatible with GMP 4.3. I am a bit surprised that with the stuff
that mpir has deprecated, they didn't deprecate that as well.

is this a 32-bit machine? What does ECM config.guess return? Can you try the svn version of
GMP-ECM using `svn checkout svn://scm.gforge.inria.fr/svn/ecm`?

Thanks!

Replying to [@jdemeyer](#comment:19):
> Thanks for all the suggestions, I will try them but probably not today.

Should I update the spkg / spkg patch to enable `--disable-asm-redc` (on MacOS X PPC 10.4 and perhaps 10.5, or simply PPC)?

IIRC we don't support 64-bit builds (`SAGE64=yes`) on PowerPC (and MacOS X < 10.6) anyway, and Apple doesn't support MacOS X 10.6 on PPCs.

Setting `ABI=32` would perhaps also work.

The build (outside of Sage) **works**.

Well, technically the processor is 64-bit capable (I believe) but it runs a 32-bit system and `gcc` produces 32-bit code by default.

powerpc-apple-darwin8.11.0

This **works**.

> The build (outside of Sage) **works**.

Well, I'm a bit unsure what to do now. I can of course include the patch, but that does not what we actually want (it's just a work-around).

I think passing `-Wa,-force_cpusubtype_ALL` on MacOS PPCs should also work (which does **not** disable the assembly code, but avoids the odd assembler error, such that we get better performance).

Note that this worked on Dima's **G4** with MPIR, so I expect it to work with a G5, too.

Don't know if G3s run into the same problem, or support these instructions. We then might have to really disable the code on PPCs < G4.

We could of course just test this in `spkg-install`, i.e. feed some extended instruction set assembly code to the assembler with `-force_cpusubtype_ALL` and see if we get an error before we disable the redc asm code. (I'd have to look what option `gas` takes on *Linux* PPC.)

Objections against adding yet another environment variable (`ECM_EXTRA_OPTS`, to add to ECM's `configure`, analoguous to `PARI_EXTRA_OPTS`), to ease working around potential problems showing up later?

P.S.: That the *build* works with `-force_cpusubtype_ALL` (*without* `SAGE_CHECK=yes`) doesn't necessarily mean we couldn't get illegal instruction exceptions when actually *running* the code.

I know that gmp-ecm-6.3 builds on my linux ppc system but I don't believe
I have the assembler enabled. I will try that as soon as I have access to the machine
next week. I will also have a look at mpir. Note that my test machine is a G4.

I am a bit surprised that no changes where needed to build it against GMP 5.0.1
I add a bug report specifically on that in Gentoo and I could reproduce it on one
of my machine which has GMP 5.0.1.

Ok.

> I am a bit surprised that no changes where needed to build it against GMP 5.0.1

Hmmm, we have to upgrade ECM *because of* the upgrade of MPIR / GMP:
  
 ***Changes between ecm-6.2.3 and ecm-6.3:***

* *New assembly code for 64-bit PowerPC (thanks to Philip McLaughlin)*
* *Allow several processes to write to the same -save file*
* *More routines in new P+-1 stage 2 use multi-threading in OpenMP build*
* ***Fixed incompatibility with GMP 5.0.0***
* *Fixed several bugs, and now check return value from malloc() calls*
* *Fixed linking of GMP which prevented successful builds under Darwin (and presumably other systems)*
* *Allow use of x86_64 asm code under MinGW*

I'll have to check my inbox for the details. I imported it on the 7th of July
because it said it was compatible with GMP-5 and one of our user was using that.
The user then reported that he still couldn't get ECM to build and I introduced the
fix above the next day which solved the problem.
A possibility is interference with by a patch to GMP Gentoo side.

On a positive note ECM 6.3 is the default in sage-on-gentoo since the 3rd of August so it has been extensively tested on x86, amd64 and ppc. However assembler code is at the user's discretion.

Can you attach the `config.log`?

I went ahead and tweaked configure with the extra asm command in conftes2.s above. It passes, but then I get it misconfigured to ppc64, and then make does not work, as it wants to build ppc64-specific asm code. The following does it better:

```
$ ./configure --disable-asm-redc
```
with this, both make and make check work OK. This is all so far out of Sage tree.
I'll attach config.log, just in case.

the configure error reported in comment 32 seems to be a ld problem. User "dimpase", do you
manage to configure GMP successfully?

Also, which version of GMP-ECM did you use in comment 32? The svn version (see comment 24) should
fix the fact that 64-bit assembly is used on 32-bit machines. If not, please report the problem
upstream on http://ecm.gforge.inria.fr/.

Yes, I do. MPIR, to be more precise. The version on #8664.

the one packed in the spkg on this ticket.

Subsequent experiments were made on the same version (without whatever patches in the spkg, however).

I then packaged the configure fix and the extra config flag into Sage spkg and am building Sage using it and
the MPIR spkg on  #8664. (it's not done yet, this machine is slooooow...)

Of course you are also free to solve the problem within Sage, but if it is not due to the Sage

I wish I could. The patch is against configure.in. But I cannot make autotools work on the package, neither on any local machine, nor on boxen (where autoreconf is version 2.61):

```
dima@boxen:/tmp/ecm-6.3.p0/src$ autoreconf -i
Remember to add `AC_PROG_LIBTOOL' to `configure.in'.
libtoolize: `config.guess' exists: use `--force' to overwrite
libtoolize: `config.sub' exists: use `--force' to overwrite
libtoolize: `ltmain.sh' exists: use `--force' to overwrite
configure.in:185: error: possibly undefined macro: AC_OPENMP
      If this token and others are legitimate, please use m4_pattern_allow.
      See the Autoconf documentation.
autoreconf: /usr/bin/autoconf failed with exit status: 1
dima@boxen:/tmp/ecm-6.3.p0/src$ 
```
 sorry...

These (i.e. the\n  files 'patches/configure.in' and 'patches/configure') should be\n  removed on the next upgrade to a stable release.\n* GMP-ECM comes with a self-tuning feature; we could support\n  that as an option ($SAGE_TUNE_*=yes) in the future.\n* We currently work around a linker bug on MacOS X 10.5 PPC (with\n  GCC 4.2.1) which breaks 'configure' if debug symbols are enabled.\n  This *might* get fixed in later upstream releases.\n* ECM currently does not use the CC and CFLAGS settings from 'gmp.h'\n  since we pass (other) options in CFLAGS (though MPIR currently doesn't\n  use its own CFLAGS for the same reason); we could fix that somehow\n  s.t. \"optimized\" code generation options ('-mcpu=...', '-mtune=...')\n  are used by gcc. Of course a user can also manually enable them by\n  setting the \"global\" CFLAGS to e.g. \"-march=native\" on x86 systems.\n  Note that this doesn't affect the packages' selection of processor-\n  specific optimized [assembly] code.\n  'spkg-install' already reads those settings now, but doesn't yet\n  use them.\n  If SAGE_FAT_BINARY=\"yes\", we should avoid too specific settings of\n  \"-mcpu=...\", and perhaps pass a more generic \"--host=...\" to \n  'configure'.\n\n---\n\nPlease build, test and report!\n\n(As you know, it still requires the new MPIR spkg from #8664. Note that I didn't have the same versions of autotools, so the patched `configure` looks quite different and might give warnings, but works, at least for me.)",

**New spkg: http://spkg-upload.googlecode.com/files/ecm-6.3.p2.spkg**

**md5sum:** `85eabecaa8974a270d5587ef8de06da1  ecm-6.3.p2.spkg`

---

### ecm-6.3.p2 (Leif Leonhardy, November 23rd, 2010)
* Apply another patch from upstream to 'configure.in' to fix compilation
  on 32-bit x86 processors supporting SSE2. (#10252)
  (There's only a single, cumulative patch file since both patches are to
  'configure.in'.)
* Work around linker bug on MacOS X 10.5 PPC (see Special Update/Build
  Instructions above, and #5847 comment 35 ff.).
* Allow passing extra arguments to 'configure' through ECM_EXTRA_OPTS.
* Add "-march=native" to CFLAGS on platforms that support it if CFLAGS
  do not already contain similar.
* Print settings of CC, CFLAGS etc. and how we configure.
* Print settings of CC and CFLAGS found in 'SAGE_LOCAL/include/gmp.h'
  and eventually a system-wide 'gmp.h'; these aren't yet used though.
* Further clean-up.

---

### Special Update/Build Instructions

* src/ contains "stable" upstream code, to which we currently apply
  two upstream patches (both to 'configure.in'). These (i.e. the
  files 'patches/configure.in' and 'patches/configure') should be
  removed on the next upgrade to a stable release.
* GMP-ECM comes with a self-tuning feature; we could support
  that as an option ($SAGE_TUNE_*=yes) in the future.
* We currently work around a linker bug on MacOS X 10.5 PPC (with
  GCC 4.2.1) which breaks 'configure' if debug symbols are enabled.
  This *might* get fixed in later upstream releases.
* ECM currently does not use the CC and CFLAGS settings from 'gmp.h'
  since we pass (other) options in CFLAGS (though MPIR currently doesn't
  use its own CFLAGS for the same reason); we could fix that somehow
  s.t. "optimized" code generation options ('-mcpu=...', '-mtune=...')
  are used by gcc. Of course a user can also manually enable them by
  setting the "global" CFLAGS to e.g. "-march=native" on x86 systems.
  Note that this doesn't affect the packages' selection of processor-
  specific optimized [assembly] code.
  'spkg-install' already reads those settings now, but doesn't yet
  use them.
  If SAGE_FAT_BINARY="yes", we should avoid too specific settings of
  "-mcpu=...", and perhaps pass a more generic "--host=..." to 
  'configure'.

---

Please build, test and report!

(As you know, it still requires the new MPIR spkg from #8664. Note that I didn't have the same versions of autotools, so the patched `configure` looks quite different and might give warnings, but works, at least for me.)

Ooops, I just noticed I've cleaned up a little bit too much (and did *not* enable building also a shared library by default).

As is, the Sage library won't build with the new package, unless you either install it with
* `CFLAGS` containing (also) `-fPIC`, or
* `ECM_EXTRA_OPTS=--enable-shared`.

(Both together also works. So yet another reason we **have to** pass our custom `CFLAGS`.)

I'll update the spkg later, after some feedback I think.

What C compilers *does* Sage currently support (and will Sage support in the near future)?

Cf. [comment:ticket:10252:20 this comment]:
   *There's very little support for other compilers in Sage, and it's easy to add a distinction when the day it gets necessary comes, though I could add it now.*


Btw, if a user decides or has to set `CC` for some reason (which might even be just to use a different `gcc`), GMP-ECM won't use MPIR's / GMP's `CFLAGS` either. And MPIR isn't omniscient...

Okay, I was referring to older versions of `gcc` which do not support `-march=native` (it is a relatively new command line option, so we cannot assume that it will work).

Anyway, the proper way to do this is to actually run `gcc -march=native` on some stupid .c file and check whether it compiles (there is no need to actually run the compiled program, so we can compile to `/dev/null`).

`gcc -v -march=native` should be sufficient, since the preprocessor also needs to know about it.

GCC 4.0.1 might not support it (could you test that on an x86 machine?); GCC 4.2.1 certainly does.

No, that's not sufficient to test it, it does not run the preprocessor.

If you want to run to preprocessor, the following works:

```
gcc -march=native -E -x c /dev/null -o /dev/null
```

Using this test, `-march=native` works for me on gcc 4.2.3, NOT on gcc 4.0.3

Thanks, I use:

```sh

       ...
    fi
    rm -f foo.*

### ecm-6.3.p2 (Leif Leonhardy, November 25th, 2010)
* #5847: Apply another patch from upstream to 'configure.in' to fix com-
  pilation on 32-bit x86 processors supporting SSE2. (Also #10252.)
  (There's only a single, cumulative patch file since both patches are to
  'configure.in'.)
* Work around linker bug on MacOS X 10.5 PPC (see Special Update/Build
  Instructions above, and #5847 comment 35 ff.).
* Allow passing extra arguments to 'configure' through ECM_EXTRA_OPTS.
* Add "-march=native" to CFLAGS on platforms that support it, or use
  processor-specific CFLAGS from GMP's / MPIR's 'gmp.h' if available,
  but only if CFLAGS do not already contain similar (i.e., don't over-
  ride a user's choice). [Subject to further improvement.]
* Print settings of CC, CFLAGS etc. and how we configure.
* Print settings of CC and CFLAGS found in 'SAGE_LOCAL/include/gmp.h'
  and eventually a system-wide 'gmp.h', although the latter aren't (yet)
  used at all, and only processor-specific parts of the former.
* Add '-fPIC' conditionally, i.e. not if we're also building a shared
  library (or '--with-pic' was given).
* Don't delete previous installations unless the build succeeded.
* Further clean-up.


### Special Update/Build Instructions

 [...]
* ECM currently does not (by itself) use the CC and CFLAGS settings
  from 'gmp.h' since we pass (other) options in CFLAGS, and CC is set
  by Sage and might got set by the user (though MPIR currently doesn't
  use its own CFLAGS for the same reason, which is fixed in an MPIR
  2.1.3.p2 spkg). We now at least partially fix that s.t. "optimized"
  code generation options ('-mcpu=...', '-mtune=...') are used by gcc.
  Of course a user can also manually enable them by setting the "global"
  CFLAGS to e.g. '-march=native' on x86[_64] systems, or '-mcpu=...' and
  '-mtune=...' on other architectures where "native" isn't supported.
  Note that this doesn't affect the packages' selection of processor-
  specific optimized [assembly] code.
  'spkg-install' already reads the settings from Sage's and also a
  system-wide GMP / MPIR now, but doesn't (yet) use all of them.
  If SAGE_FAT_BINARY="yes", we should avoid too specific settings of
  "-mcpu=...", and perhaps pass a more generic "--host=..." to 
  'configure'. (MPIR honors '--enable-fat' to some extent, but this
  option isn't used on anything other than x86 / x86_64.)


---

A new MPIR (2.1.3.p2) spkg which handles `CFLAGS` better (allowing us to use processor-specific settings chosen by MPIR) is on the way, but will live on another ticket (not #8664). Just haven't committed the changes yet.

Well, apparently `SAGE_FAT_BINARY` has *never been* supported by the ECM spkg.

And no, `-march=native` isn't added by `spkg-install` in case `SAGE_FAT_BINARY=yes`:

```sh
if [ "$SAGE_FAT_BINARY" = yes ]; then
    # XXX Disable SSE2 on x86? (by passing '--enable-sse2=no' to 'configure')
    # XXX Disable asm-redc? Or pass some "generic" '--host=...' to 'configure'?
    echo "Warning: SAGE_FAT_BINARY is currently not really supported by this package."
    echo "         Add e.g. '--disable-asm-redc' and/or '--enable-sse2=no'"
    echo "         to ECM_EXTRA_OPTS if you run into problems."
else
    # Tune the code generation to the machine we build on:

    ...
fi
```
(Note that some 'optimized' parameters may come from `gmp.h` anyway, but these aren't used either if `SAGE_FAT_BINARY=yes`.)

We had some discussion on that before, and Paul said they're considering adding a `--enable-fat` switch to ECM's `configure` IIRC. There are also a few comments in ECM's `SPKG.txt`.

If I build a SAGE_FAT_BINARY version of sage on one of the skynet x86_64 machines, then move that build to another skynet x86_64 machine, then all the tests should pass.  That is my understanding of what SAGE_FAT_BINARY should accomplish.

In spite of ecm not explicitly recognizing SAGE_FAT_BINARY, when
I have built SAGE_FAT_BINARY versions of previous versions of sage (for example 4.6.2), I have not run into any problems.  (Perhaps
I have just been lucky.)

Does this spkg maintain this SAGE_FAT_BINARY functionality?

Looking at the build I see

```
Copying patched files...
Adding '-fPIC' to CFLAGS since we don't (also) build a shared library.
Using additional host-specific CFLAGS: -march=native

Settings from SAGE_LOCAL/include/gmp.h:
    CC=gcc 
    CFLAGS=-O2 -m64 -march=k8 -mtune=k8 
Using CC=gcc
Using CFLAGS=-march=native -g -O3  -fPIC
Using CPPFLAGS=
Using LDFLAGS=
Using ABI=
(These settings may get overridden by 'configure' or Makefiles.)
```

**Strongly** suggest ecm be built with same CFLAGS values as gmp/mpir as recommended by ecm INSTALL file.

Hi Mariah,

this failure is rather unrelated to the GMP-ECM package itself (since we only build a static library, see above), but a "common" Fedora (>=14 / SELinux) / GCC problem; cf. e.g. #10188.

The `libecm.so` extension module -- which erroneously carries the "executable stack" flag -- is built by Cython from `libecm.pyx`.

Could you please first try

```sh
$ execstack -c local/lib/python/site-packages/sage/libs/libecm.so
```
and rerun the test?

(Taking the flags from MPIR / `gmp.h` wouldn't help anyway in this case.)

---

If the above works, you could then patch `module_list.py`:

```diff
diff --git a/module_list.py b/module_list.py
--- a/module_list.py
+++ b/module_list.py
@@ -561,6 +561,7 @@
     Extension('sage.libs.libecm',
               sources = ['sage/libs/libecm.pyx'],
               libraries = ['ecm', 'gmp'],
+              extra_compile_args=["-Wl,-z,noexecstack"],
               depends = [SAGE_ROOT + "/local/include/ecm.h"]),
      
     Extension('sage.libs.mwrank.mwrank',
```
Then you probably have to touch `libecm.pyx` in order to convince Cython to rebuild the module before issuing `./sage -b`. Afterwards the tests should pass without the need to rerun `execstack`. (You can check the flag's setting by running `execstack -q ...`.)

Let me know if the above works and/or if you need a Mercurial patch for that... ;-)

(Just curious: Which GCC version are you using now? The problem may or should have arised with earlier version of Sage on Fedora, too.)

**Disclaimer for Dave:**

The patch above is a bit hackish. We should either pass the additional compiler flag *conditionally* (on Linux systems only, where we can rely on a GNU linker), or perhaps instead use GCC's `--noexecstack` parameter, of which I currently don't know whether it is supported by ancient versions of GCC.

**Not supported?** WTF...

No idea what's causing that. Though I don't need it, I can toggle the flag here on Ubuntu (10.4) as I like.

Maybe an obsolete version of `execstack`? Or maybe just a wrong, misleading error message? The path is correct (relative to `SAGE_ROOT`)?

If all doesn't help, simply try applying the patch (to `devel/sage/module_list.py`), touch `devel/sage/sage/libs/libecm.pyx` and run `./sage -b`.

Well, *my* `execstack` (version 1.0) gives an appropriate error message on `non-existing.so`. Perhaps you have an old version installed that only supports 32-bit ELF.

Ok, I'll make the extra linker flag depend on the OS (i.e., Linux).

May take 1-2 hours until I upload a Mercurial patch.
