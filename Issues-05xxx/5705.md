so far `homogenize()` would always create a new parent if the variable was not in the current parent. It should make sure that it reuses a previously created parent if available.

Attachment: **[mpoly_homogenize_parent.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket5705/mpoly_homogenize_parent.patch.gz)**

Indeed, without the patch, we have

```
sage: R=PolynomialRing(QQ,'x',5)
sage: p=R.random_element()
sage: q1=p.homogenize()
sage: q2=p.homogenize()
sage: q1.parent() is q2.parent()
False
```

With the patch, that cleanly applies, we have

```
sage: R=PolynomialRing(QQ,'x',5)
sage: p=R.random_element()
sage: q1=p.homogenize()
sage: q2=p.homogenize()
sage: q1.parent() is q2.parent()
True
```

So, I give it a positive review.

Hmm, I am happy to merge this provided someone post a doctest. With this patch applied doctests do pass. 3.4.1.rc2 will drop in about 18 hours, so there should be plenty of time.

Cheers,

Apply the new patch after the old one.  It just adds Simon's test as a doctest.
