so far `homogenize()` would always create a new parent if the variable was not in the current parent. It should make sure that it reuses a previously created parent if available.

Attachment: **[mpoly_homogenize_parent.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket5705/mpoly_homogenize_parent.patch.gz)**

Indeed, without the patch, we have

```
sage: R=PolynomialRing(QQ,'x',5)
sage: p=R.random_element()
sage: q1=p.homogenize()
sage: q2=p.homogenize()
sage: q1.parent() is q2.parent()
False
```

With the patch, that cleanly applies, we have

```
sage: R=PolynomialRing(QQ,'x',5)
sage: p=R.random_element()
sage: q1=p.homogenize()
sage: q2=p.homogenize()
sage: q1.parent() is q2.parent()
True
```

So, I give it a positive review.

Hmm, I am happy to merge this provided someone post a doctest. With this patch applied doctests do pass. 3.4.1.rc2 will drop in about 18 hours, so there should be plenty of time.
