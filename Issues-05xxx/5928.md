This was uncovered at #5921.  Observe:

```
sage: P.<x> = ZZ
sage: f = 2*x + 2
sage: c = f.content()
sage: g = f//c
sage: F1 = c.factor(); [type(a[0]) for a in F1]
[<type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>]
sage: F2 = g.factor(); [type(a[0]) for a in F2]
[<type 'sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_integer_dense_flint.Polynomial_integer_dense_flint'>]
sage: F1*F2
2 * (x + 1)
sage: [type(a[0]) for a in F1*F2]
[<type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>,
 <type 'sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_integer_dense_flint.Polynomial_integer_dense_flint'>]
```

I think that multiplying two factorisations should make sure that the factors can be coerced into a common universe, so that all factors have the same parent.  If that's impossible, then an error should be thrown.

The attached patch does this for multiplication, gcd, and lcm.  The other operations either inherit it or were dealing with this already.

**Attachment:** [trac_5928.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket5928/trac_5928.patch.gz)

This patch looks good, applies to 3.4.2.alpha0 and tests in sage/structure pass as well as those in sage/rings/*.py (I did not go into subdirectories).

I was a little disappointed by this:

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: S.<y> = QQ[]
sage: f = x^2-1
sage: g = y^3-1
sage: f.factor()
(x - 1) * (x + 1)
sage: g.factor()
(y - 1) * (y^2 + y + 1)
sage: f.factor() * g.factor()
(1) * (y - 1) * (x - 1) * (x + 1) * (y^2 + y + 1)
sage: (f.factor() * g.factor()).universe()
Category of objects
```
and in fact coercion is not clever enough to allow x*y here.  but it does work if you do 

```
sage: S.<x> = QQ[]
sage: y=S.gen(0)
sage: g = y^3-1
sage: f.factor() * g.factor()
(x + 1) * (x - 1)^2 * (x^2 + x + 1)
```
-- i.e. you have to define the two rings with the same name of the variable even if you use a different name for input.  Weird, but it is not going to stop this patch!
