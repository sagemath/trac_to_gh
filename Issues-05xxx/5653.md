The attached patch shouldn't affect docstrings from the command line (well, except that it should replace 'a \times b' with 'a x b'). In the notebook, though:

```
identity_matrix(TAB
```
should pop open the usual docstring, but it's not in html <pre> format: see [this picture](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/palmieri/misc/docstring.png). It's in a variable width font, with math typeset correctly -- see the $n \times n$ in the first line of the docstring -- and with example blocks in <pre> format.

This is marked "needs work" for two reasons, one of which is a mystery to me:

1. (the mystery) start a fresh worksheet and type

```
identity_matrix? [SHIFT-RETURN]
```
This will be typeset in <pre> format. Then type

```
identity_matrix? [TAB]
```
This is typeset nicely. I don't know what the difference is.

2. Math is not handled properly.  I have a hack in place to typeset inline math ("<code>... \`blah\` ...</code>") in the docstring, but not displayed math (directive "`.. math::`"). This is because I'm using docutils to convert the docstring to html, and docutils doesn't know about math. I would like to use Sphinx to do the conversion (in which case more math should be handled, and there would also be some syntax highlighting), but I don't know how to use Sphinx well enough to do that.  I've posted a question to the sphinx-dev group, and if I hear anything, I'll post it here or update the ticket.

Please test out the patch, improve it, rewrite it, whatever.

(By the way, Tom Boothby deserves credit for getting jsMath to process the docstring.)

Okay, here's a new version with [a new picture](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/palmieri/misc/sphinx.png).  This uses Pat LeSmithe's version of set_introspect_html (see [this thread](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_frm/thread/dc89425699137415)), with some modifications. 

Actually, this patch has three versions of set_introspect_html:
* SPHINX_set_introspect_html   (modification of Pat LeSmithe's version using Sphinx)
* PYGMENTS_set_introspect_html  (Pat LeSmithe's version using pygments -- doesn't do much for me)
* DOCUTILS_set_introspect_html  (the version from the first patch)
You can edit server/notebook/cell.py, changing the line

```
set_introspect_html = SPHINX_set_introspect_html
```
to test out each one.

Here's a new patch incorporating Pat LeSmithe's latest ideas, plus a few new things.  This handles everything pretty well, although it might be a bit slow since Sphinx creates various files. I think it's slower than the standard docstring display in the notebook, but on the other hand, I also think it's fast enough to be usable. If we ever figure out how to run Sphinx without reading and writing files, we can do that instead.

This latest version handles math well (via Sphinx), uses pygments to do syntax highlighting (via Sphinx), handles all of `identity_matrix( TAB`, `identity_matrix? TAB`, `identity_matrix? SHIFT-RETURN`, and `identity_matrix??`.  There is now only one version of `set_introspect_html`: the Sphinx version.

One of Pat's recent posts said:

```
* If anyone's interested, here's a way to render an input cell as
syntax-highlighted HTML output:

from pygments import highlight
from pygments.lexers import PythonLexer
from pygments.formatters import HtmlFormatter
from pygments.styles import STYLE_MAP
from pygments.styles import get_style_by_name
from sphinx.highlighting import SphinxStyle

class colorize:
    def __init__(self, style=SphinxStyle):
        self.lexer = PythonLexer(encoding='chardet')
        self.formatter = HtmlFormatter(noclasses=True, style=style)
    def eval(self, s, globals, locals):
        return html(highlight(s, self.lexer, self.formatter))

Then put %colorize('colorful'), say, at the beginning of a cell and
evaluate it, e.g.,

%colorize('colorful')
def f(x):
  return x * x
f(3.0)

STYLE_MAP.keys() gives a list of styles.  This is adapted from
http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/msg/e53caae140cef7df . 
```
There is already a file and a function called "colorize", but I added code like this, so that you can do

```
%pygments('colorful')
def f(x):
  return x * x
f(3.0)
```
(I was thinking of a name like "html" or "jsmath": pygments is what processes the rest of the cell, so that's the name of the decorator.) With the patch, this is automatically available in the notebook.

I'm sure all of this could still use work, but I'll mark it as "needs review".

A new standalone patch, docstring.3.patch, tweaks the Sphinx processing code.  The code now

* Sets the cache directory once per session.

* Deletes doctrees and environment pickles.

* Tries to avoid crossed signals from [near] simultaneous calls to Sphinx.

It'd be great to learn how this performs under heavy server loads, especially when many people access the same (or different) docstrings at once.

The new patch also removes pygmentize.py.  Eventually, it'll return in a separate ticket, along with nascent support for highlighting tracebacks and published input cells of various systems (e.g., python, latex, html, sh).

Thanks. I do agree with you that Evan should be credited for his code, so we do need to add him to the list of people getting credit for this patch.

So, this is a Beautiful Thing.  ;-)  Very nicely formatted docstrings *and* in some cases, formatted source code as well.  This is a great addition to the notebook for both users and developers.

I'm not qualified to do a review, but here are some comments based on a bit of testing.

1. `sudoku??` yields nicely formatted source code, but `matrix??` does not.  Maybe there's something about the source, not the patch?

2.  I'd documented sudoku.py a week ago, which is why I was experimenting with it.

(a) A URL in the references, unadorned, is a live link in the docstring view in the notebook.  Very nice.  Even nicer would be if a click on the link opened in a new tab/window.

(b) An error in the docstring (still) gets reported in the console where I invoked the notebook.  So a person writing docstrings can debug this way.

3.  Would it be possible to build on this code to create a command to test doscstring formatting on a single file from the sage command line?  E.g., `sage -doc misc/sagedoc.py` would build all the docstrings as HTML and view it in the developers's default web browser?

4.  Against 3.4.1.rc3 I had to fix a couple of rejects from the patch by hand.

Great work - I hope this sees a proper review soon.

I don't know why matrix?? doesn't produce nice source code. 

I'm attaching a rebased version of the patch, also.

The other questions are good ones, and I don't have answers for them, but I think they should be dealt with in a later ticket, once this is in.

It seems so.  Doing a search for just a space in emacs, or turning on whitespace-mode [1], reveals several stray TABs (I think) starting around the line 

```
# Ensure we have a list of lists, each inner list

1.  I think of the action being described as "tear off" as being more suggestive than "pop out," but I'm not sure there is a real convention for naming this sort of thing.

2.  In Firefox I get an address bar for the new window, which points back to the whole worksheet.  Can the Javascript create the window without an address bar?

3.  Would it be possible to have a link for "move to new tab"?  I prefer to have all my browser "stuff" in one window with lots of tabs, rather than a proliferation of windows.  Maybe others would feel similarly.

I've written a few JavaScript functions for "tear out" introspection, but I'm not sure where to put them.  For now, I've put them in `javascript_local/introspect.js` and added 

```
head += '<script type="text/javascript" src="/javascript_local/introspect.js"></script>\n'
```
to `notebook.py`, but the "local" repository seems to be gone.  Alternatively, I can put them in `javascript/introspect.js` and use the "extcode" repository, but I think the latter will soon change significantly (see [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/a08b413375558b46/d643be6b6bd04968#d643be6b6bd04968)).

`js.py` is another possibility, but I'd rather not put them there, since it might be useful to load `introspect.js` into a "torn out" window.

A related issue:  It would be nice to have just one `<script>` element load jsMath with all of Sage's customizations (extensions, plug-ins, macros, etc.) into regular, published, printed, and docbrowser worksheets, as well as "torn out" introspection windows and offline documentation.  Maybe `easy/load.js` is the right place (see #4714),
but I think notebook.py generates the macro list on-the-fly.

Davide (author of jsmath) sent these comments about the above paragraph:

Mpatel is right that jsMath/easy/load.js could be used for this.

It provides a bad way to turn those messages back on, because I couldn't figure out a better way, despite trying for quite a while -- see the docstring for `set_instrospect_html`.

To produce the patch, here's what I did: 

1. imported the old patch "docstring.4.patch".  

2. used "hg rollback" to uncommit the changes

3. performed the changes in your patch file (by hand, basically)

4. "hg commit"

This produced an all-in-one patch.

I think the documentation is currently much too colorful and therefore hard to read.
I've attached a few tweaks to the css, which make the background lighter, change the
text color to black, and also tone down the colors of the examples.

This is awesome!

When doing a double-question mark in Sage 4.0, I get:

```

However, this may not be an issue with this patch. The directories above are the directories in which I built sage.  However, I moved Sage since then, so the directories above no longer exist.  Why are the directory paths not updated when I move the Sage directory (and start up Sage)?

I hate to say this, but I get conflicts on my 4.1 tree.  I applied the patches at #6307, then the patch here.  
Can you rebase this?

This looks fantastic.

This sometimes messes up docstrings that are not yet in rest.  However, this also might spur action in getting the rest of the docs into rest format.

I'll try to look through this next week.  I've also applied it to my tree so that I can test it normal usage.

Ideas for possible future improvements:

* Cross-references.  One approach: Post-process Sphinx's output in `cell.py`'s `set_introspect_html()`.  It may help to pass the module name as an argument.
* Browse to the previous / next definition in the current module.
* Live cells.
* Tear-outs (cf. #6001).

Why don't we have figures in the reference manual?

> I regenerated the missing files with `hg revert --all`.  I'm not sure what happened, since I have not touched them at all in v4.1.1.alpha1.  I'll assume it was an isolated oddity.  Or has `MANIFEST.in` struck again?

Yes. For this ticket and also for #4460. I'm about to restore these missing files by posting a patch against `MANIFEST.in`.
