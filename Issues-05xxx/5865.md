Add some documentation to README.txt that explains the 

```
export SAGE_SIMD_MODE="SSE2"
```

flag, which makes it so one can build SAGE with ATLAS without sse3 optimizations.  This is slower but works on way more machines.

Oops, it is **SAGE_SIMD_MODE** - not sure how this confusion arose.

Cheers,
