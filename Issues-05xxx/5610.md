This patch attempts to implement LaTeX customizations for the following things:

1. matrix and vector delimiters (see #5474 -- this patch moves that code around)

2. the use of plain bold vs. blackboard bold for ZZ, RR, etc.

It almost succeeds, except that I don't know how to get jsMath to display blackboard bold fonts, so it doesn't work completely in the notebook.  (This is why the ticket is labeled as not being ready for review.)

Here's what it does: from the command line,

```
sage: latex_customize.use_blackboard_bold(True)
sage: view(ZZ)
```

will pop up a PDF or DVI file with a blackboard bold ZZ.  Similarly, in the notebook,

```
latex_customize.use_blackboard_bold(True)
```
followed by a cell containing

```
%latex
$\ZZ$
```
will show a blackboard bold Z.

From either the command line or the notebook,

```
latex_customize.set_vector_delimiters("\\langle", "\\rangle")
latex_customize.set_matrix_delimiters("\\{", "]")
```
will change the left and right vector and matrix delimiters as indicated.

There are also tons of changes in the second patch of the sort "\mathbf{Q}" --> "\QQ".  The idea here is, first, to make the docstrings more readable, and second, to make it easy to change between \mathbf and \mathbb.  Note that "\QQ" is defined (via #5555) as the output of the `_latex_` method for QQ which this patch redefines to be "\Bold{QQ}", and setting `use_blackboard_bold` controls the definition of the command "\Bold". 

Now, if you want to typeset the reference manual, say, with blackboard bold instead of the default bold, the PDF version is relatively easy: just create the latex version (`sage -docbuild reference latex`) and edit the preamble: change the definition of \Bold, and run latex.  For the html version, you probably have to edit the definition of \Bold in sage/misc/latex_macros.py, or add \renewcommand{\Bold}... in the right place in sage/doc/conf.py; then run `sage -b`, then build the docs. As you can see, I don't have very good ideas about how to change the reference manuals -- should there be a command-line switch to `sage -docbuild`? -- so please chime in if you think of something.

See [this thread](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_frm/thread/68cdf05b40303286) on sage-devel for some more discussion, especially about mathbf vs. mathbb.

This ticket depends on #5359, #5433, and #5568 (all of which will be part of Sage 3.4.1.alpha0), and also on #5555.

Edit: this now depends on #5611 also.

I think it looks good, but why "latex_customize" rather than just attaching methods to "latex"?

Second patch ("-part2") is mostly minor changes in docstrings, but fails on four files.  I'd suspect this is due to some of the recent work on improving doctests.  So comments below pertain to just applying the first patch and testing from there.

The new methods for setting matrix and vector delimiters are a very welcome addition, and the options for "bolding" rings provide a good example for future options like this.  One should note that work still needs to be done to make this work for all rings, this patch appears to only demonstrate use for ZZ and GF (though I could have missed some).

The use of an instance of the Latex class, named "latex" had me confused for a while, since now `latex.__call__` replaces the functionality of the old `latex()`.  Some commentary highlighting the `latex` instance in the source (at some point - either now, or later) might save others the same confusion.

`sage -docbuild pdf reference` seemed to choke on the doctest for the `list_function` method in `misc/latex.py`.  I'm going to attach the generated TeX below, we'll see how it fares.  I also have a screen shot of the output.  Its pretty jumbled up, and in particular the `\begin{array`} has a "b" that is some non-ASCII character, so I wonder if there is a missing backslash and the  b  is being escaped?

I'm ready to give this a positive review with a rebased part2 patch and if the latex problem on the reference manual goes away.  Maybe the best thing to do is just excise the problematic doctest for now and bring it back in another patch.

I think this is easy to fix: put an "r" in front of the triple quotes at the beginning of the docstring.  It was there originally, and then I deleted it (I don't know why) in the new version.

I'll produce a new patch soon with the "r", and with part 2 rebased against 3.4.1.rc4.

Here's are two new patches, same subdivision as before, rebased against 3.4.1.rc4.  I also added a comment about `latex()`, as rbeezer suggested: this is in the first patch, right before the line 

```
latex = Latex()

Arrrg, the second patch has one reject in matrix1.pyx:

```
patching file sage/matrix/matrix1.pyx
Hunk #1 FAILED at 191.
1 out of 1 hunk FAILED -- saving rejects to file sage/matrix/matrix1.pyx.rej
```
I will try to fix it. This patch will likely break some other patches, so I am considering applying the untabify patch, too (in case it applies).
