Folks,

I have one suggestion for the Sage Tutorial.

In Section 2.3, after the text

## sage: def is_even(n):
...       return n%2 == 0
## I suggest that you add an instruction to press [Enter/Return/Newline]
after the

...       return n%2 == 0

to conclude the definition.

When I followed the instruction exactly as it is given, without
inserting a blank line, I got an error like this:
### sage: def is_even(n):
....:     return n%2 == 0
....: sage: is_even(2)
------------------------------------------------------------
   File "<ipython console>", line 3
     sage: is_even(Integer(2))
        ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
### It was only after I emailed sage-support that I was told I needed to
insert a blank line to conclude the definition. Because I am new to
Python, this was not old hat to me. Hence my suggestion to append:
#### Insert a blank line here by pressing [Return or Enter]

(after the line

...       return n%2 == 0)
#### Many thanks.

Chandra

REFEREE REPORT



The patch **5500-tut.patch** mostly looks good: it applies OK against Sage 3.4, but with one doctest failure:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
The following tests failed:


	sage -t -long "devel/sage-5500/doc/en/tutorial/tour_help.rst"
Total time for all tests: 3.3 seconds
```
This is caused by the following lines in the patch:

```
-    ...       return n%2 == 0
+    ...:      return n%2 == 0
+    ...:
```
The other patch **trac_5500-referee.patch** should fix the above doctest failure.
