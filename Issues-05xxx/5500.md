```
Folks,

I have one suggestion for the Sage Tutorial.

In Section 2.3, after the text

==

sage: def is_even(n):
...       return n%2 == 0
==

I suggest that you add an instruction to press [Enter/Return/Newline]
after the

...       return n%2 == 0

to conclude the definition.

When I followed the instruction exactly as it is given, without
inserting a blank line, I got an error like this:
===
sage: def is_even(n):
....:     return n%2 == 0
....: sage: is_even(2)
------------------------------------------------------------
   File "<ipython console>", line 3
     sage: is_even(Integer(2))
        ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
===

It was only after I emailed sage-support that I was told I needed to
insert a blank line to conclude the definition. Because I am new to
Python, this was not old hat to me. Hence my suggestion to append:
====
Insert a blank line here by pressing [Return or Enter]

(after the line

...       return n%2 == 0)
====
Many thanks.

Chandra

The following tests failed:

The other patch **trac_5500-referee.patch** should fix the above doctest failure.
