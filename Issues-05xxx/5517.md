The error reported by `cvxopt-0.9.p7` is:

```
Can't locate File/Copy.pm in @INC (@INC contains: /etc/perl /usr/local/lib/perl/5.10.0 /usr/local/share/perl/5.10.0 /usr/lib/perl5 /usr/share/perl5 /usr/lib/perl/5.10 /usr/share/perl/5.10 /usr/local/lib/site_perl .) at ./spkg-install line 2.
BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at ./spkg-install line 2.
```
I did have perl installed in the system, but only the `perl-base` package (5.10.0-19, debian/lenny).

However, the `File/Copy.pm` module is in `perl-modules` package, which wasn't installed in my system (`perl-base` priority is required, and `perl-modules` priority is standard).

The workaround was to `apt-get install perl-modules`; maybe this issue with `File/Copy.pm` could be checked in the prereq spkg?

The real fix here is to get rid of the dependency since it is introduced by the Fortran library handling code written by Josh Kantor. The spkg-install should just be a shell script instead of a perl script given that we only copy two different setup.py files depending on the Fortran runtime used.

Cheers,

Michael
