The following example illustrates the problem.  Loops are treated seperately, and not correctly colored (they are always black).

```
g = graphs.CompleteGraph(3)
g.loops(True)
g.add_edge(0,0)
c_dict = {"red":[(0,0)], "blue":[(0,1),(1,2),(0,2)]}
show(g.plot(edge_colors = c_dict))
```

Ticket #3541 is going to contain an overhaul of the graph plotting code. Since I'm refereeing, I'll make sure that this is fixed in that patch.
