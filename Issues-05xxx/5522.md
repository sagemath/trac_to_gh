If for some reason libsingular.so doesn't exist, Sage will segfault when trying to call dlerror() when dlopen() was never called.

I've attached a patch which avoids doing so.

With this patch, however, Sage then segfaults sometime after trying to raise the ImportError on the next line.

I don't have time to investigate further, but it is easy to reproduce the condition by just moving aside the libsingular.so and trying to start sage.

Attachment [sage-libsingular-nocrash.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket5522/sage-libsingular-nocrash.patch) by GeorgSWeber created at 2009-03-25 23:36:49

Hi,

right after

```
if handle == NULL
```
one could do

```
print "cannot load libSINGULAR library"
```
and only then try to call dlerror() or raise ImportError or whatsoever. If then the SegFault (sometimes) occurs, the user still knows why. With this change, I would consider this such an enhancement over the current situation, that I would vote to have it in.

This statement is completely false.

Nevertheless, the patch might not be needed, I'll check.

Uh... indeed, I had "applied" the patch by hand yesterday and forgot about it overnight, so it's no surprise it was looking the same :-(

I'll provide the adapted patch when I'll have checked its correctness.

I would prefer to move the error inside the `for` loop, like

```
handle = ...
if not handle:
    dlerror(...)
```

I think that's the simplest solution

Hi, I would suggest to improve the error handling for loading libSingular even further as in 

https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/1e847897b9fce54fa25f1b91dea78f9e225ad0c9
see ticket #17254 (upgrade to Singular 4.0.1)


This issue puzzled me for two days, since the error handling was not clean,
and I failed to interpret the crash messages.


Attention: do not pick 

```
lib = os.environ['SAGE_LOCAL']+"/lib/libSingular."+extension # libsingular renamed to libSingular
```
since this is only for upgrade to Singular 4.0.1 (libsingular renamed to libSingular)

Did you check that this patch was of any use?

If libsingular.so can't be loaded, then that file can't either. So any error handling within that file won't ever run, because the missing library will already have triggered an ImportError.

That is my point in [comment:13](#comment%3A13).

I do not exactly understand, what you mean.

My point is that an error message should be descriptive as possible,
so if a file cannot be found it should be 

```
   raise OSError, "did not find libsingular file!"
```

and if dlopen fails ,it should be something like (I improved the message)

```
        raise ImportError, " failed to dlopen " + lib + " "
```

Before your or mine patch it was even worse,
(a SIGSEGV because dlerror() is NULL in that case) and that 
puzzled me, since because of the compiled cython stuff I could not exactly see what happened.

I have compiled sage from scratch with my patch, moved libsingular.so, tried to launch sage, got the same nice backtrace.

This rules out the case where "./sage -ba" would have made things better.

The issue happened to me when I tried to update Singular (from 3.1.7 to 4.0.1) in a working branch
(and will of course not happen if you compile from scratch!; that is equivalent to
`make distclean` and implies `./sage -ba`

Here are some more hints and  I hope it is reproducible

- Compile from scratch the develop branch  (in doubt use commit d27f8497dcd19d70ec08155888e6fec9c74b839a)
- merge in changes from https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/221c5d63e02d7f1d7fdc57cf6c819677553dd262 
- rename "/lib/libSingular." tp "/lib/libsingular." in singular.pyx
- build (parallelized) again with `make build -j 6` or something similar;

Then I predict that you may hit something you did hit in [comment:13](#comment%3A13).
In fact, I have no idea, how you managed to trigger an `ImportError` as in [comment:13](#comment%3A13)
``
> so playing with dl* is pointless.


are you sidetracking? I issued something different, namely that an error message should be as descriptive as possible;
especially when a file is missing a developer would be happy to see that a file is missing and not an `ImportError` or a SIGSEGV as before

I'm not sure, but it seems you can't see the case I described, because you are too focused on the scenario you have in mind. Try to think "what may happen", not "what do we want to achieve"
``
Case 1: 
 The name of the library is `_hardcoded_` in 'singular.pyx', so we might get an issue if there is a typo or the name of the library changed. That happened in Singular 4.0.1, so I was able to compile sage, but then dlopen tried to open a file which did not exist.

case 2: 
> It will only trigger when the library will have been loaded in memory (because it links to it), but for some reason cannot be reloaded with the new RTLD_* flags!
Exactly. Who knows why dlopen() may fail, so better catch it and watch out for dlerror() == NULL
