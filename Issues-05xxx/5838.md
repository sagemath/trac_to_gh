Here's what I type to provoke the crash:

```
std = os.environ['SAGE_DATA'] + '/extcode/pickle_jar/pickle_jar.tar.bz2'

sage.structure.sage_object.unpickle_all(std)
```
(this is the doctest of unpickle_all, plus an extra repetition of the second line)

Here's the output:

```

Looking a bit further into it, the actual pickles that trigger the problem are those in `sage.combinat.sf.macdonald`. Namely, if these ones are removed from the pickle jar, then the problem disappears...

The crash was quite old (5 years ago) and presumably happened because of an old Singular version. This triggered an unpickling crash. Pickling is the Python name for serialization, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialization

I admit the doctest tests the unpickling issue, i.e., the symptom not the cause. OTOH it has the potential to catch a lot of other bugs. The bug itself was probably fixed by a newer Singular version.

And the winners (apparently) are:

  `_class__sage_combinat_sf_macdonald_MacdonaldPolynomials_*.sobj`

(When I skip these six, I can successfully `unpickle_all()` as often as I want in a row.)

Will investigate later, haven't looked at the code yet.

To no surprise, these objects / classes have been added shortly before Carl Witty reported the issue (for Sage 3.4.1.rc3):

```
type(obj) = <class 'sage.combinat.sf.macdonald.MacdonaldPolynomials_ht'>

obj =
'Macdonald polynomials in the Ht basis over Fraction Field of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in q, t over Rational Field'

type(obj) = <class 'sage.combinat.sf.macdonald.MacdonaldPolynomials_h'>
version = 3.4.rc1
obj =
'Macdonald polynomials in the H basis over Fraction Field of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in q, t over Rational Field'

type(obj) = <class 'sage.combinat.sf.macdonald.MacdonaldPolynomials_j'>
version = 3.4.rc1
obj =
'Macdonald polynomials in the J basis over Fraction Field of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in q, t over Rational Field'

type(obj) = <class 'sage.combinat.sf.macdonald.MacdonaldPolynomials_p'>
version = 3.4.rc1
obj =
'Macdonald polynomials in the P basis over Fraction Field of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in q, t over Rational Field'

type(obj) = <class 'sage.combinat.sf.macdonald.MacdonaldPolynomials_q'>
version = 3.4.rc1
obj =

type(obj) = <class 'sage.combinat.sf.macdonald.MacdonaldPolynomials_s'>
version = 3.4.rc1
obj =
'Macdonald polynomials in the S basis over Fraction Field of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in q, t over Rational Field'

Indeed, since the above failure incidentally vanishes with #21188. (So far only tried with GMP 5.1.3 and GCC 4.9.3 though.)

I.e., when building Sage / Singular with GMP, a `configure` test for FLINT in Singular failed because it used `-lmpir`, such that Singular and libsingular "silently" got built without using FLINT.

I am seeing this doctest (2nd unpickling) failing on FreeBSD (see #22679).

This might be due to some toolchain issues I have there ATM (I see mysterious errors in sympow, depending upon unrecognised compiler options passed, or not...).
