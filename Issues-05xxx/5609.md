Just a question after reading the patch: 

Why do you implement both `__cmp__()` and `__richcmp__()` in `BooleanPolynomialIdeal`? The doctests for these two functions also seem to be the same.

This patch completely moves the docstring of two `__init__` methods to the class. Is that the desired effect, i.e. why not add back minimal doctests? I understand that underscore and double underscore methods aren't in the manual, but this makes a difference for -coverage and ought to be fixed.
