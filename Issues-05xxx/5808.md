Along with #5541, this patch fixes most of the warnings when building the reference manual in 3.4.1.rc3.  I still get these:

```
checking consistency... WARNING: /Applications/sage_builds/sage-3.4.1.rc3/devel/sage-test/doc/en/reference/sage/combinat/family.rst:: document isn't included in any toctree
done
preparing documents... WARNING: html_favicon is not an .ico file
```
but that's it.

John,

I just uploaded a patch at #4933 which fixes some of the same things for ell_rational_field and ell_generic.  We might have difficulties merging these.  I am about to test yours and hope to give a positive review shortly...

PS I would like to add \AA and \PP to the "blackboard bold" list (for affine and projective space).  I read your clear instructions on how to do that, but have not done so as I thought you were probably touching that file.

Applies fine to 3.4.1.rc3.  When I did "sage -docbuild all html" I got lots of warnings in the tutrial (ok, not dealt with here) and a couple in algebras/quatalg/quaternion_algebra.py.

So I added some edits to that file, as in the second patch attached.

My positive review applies to the first patch.  If John likes the second one, that's good.

OK, kill that patch, I should not have wasted my time!

I'm about to add a patch doing what you suggested for mwrank.  Which will make 4933 even harder to merge...so on second thoughts I will not post it here but will rebase my #4933 patch on this one and include the mwrank changes there.

UPSHOT:   Positive review for ref-warnings.patch;  ignore the seond one.
