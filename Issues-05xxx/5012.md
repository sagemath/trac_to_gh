[4:36pm] mabs: cwitty: I have another interesting bug for you:
[4:36pm] mabs: File "/home/mabshoff/build-3.2.3.final/sage-3.2.3.final-fulvia/devel/sage/sage/rings/qqbar.py", line 3826:
[4:36pm] mabs:     sage: cp.complex_roots(30, 1)
[4:36pm] mabs: Expected:
[4:36pm] mabs:     [1.189207115002721?,
[4:36pm] mabs:     -1.189207115002721?,

[4:36pm] mabs:     -1.189207115002721?*I]
[4:36pm] mabs: Got:
[4:36pm] mabs:     [1.189207115002721?, -1.189207115002722?, 1.189207115002721?*I, -1.189207115002721?*I]
[4:37pm] mabs: Notice that the second and third entries are different?
[4:37pm] mabs: Ehh, the second only
[4:38pm] cwitty: Yes.  It's probably not a bug; complex_roots doesn't guarantee to find the tightest possible 
interval, and it depends on ATLAS which doesn't guarantee identical results.
[4:38pm] mabs: ok
[4:38pm] mabs: Should I use "..." then?
[4:38pm] cwitty: Yes.
```

Patch coming up. Credit is shared with cwitty.
