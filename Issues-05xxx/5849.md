MPIR 1.1.1 is about to be released fixing a couple small issues that in rare circumstances can cause trouble, i.e. when a pathscale compiler is installed on x86-64. 

While we are at it: Make sure to select generic x86-64 code since right now we build code using lahf on sage.math that some early P4s did not have as mentioned on #5284. Use the SAGE_SIMD_MODE flag to decide what to do.

Cheers,

Michael

I would like to add that this is extremely important for me, since I cannot build sage-3.4.1 on my laptop, which is what I usually develop on.
