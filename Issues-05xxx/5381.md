From proposal on sage-devel:

Place the guts of kernel computations for each (specialized) class into a right_kernel() method, where it would seem to naturally belong.  Mostly these would replace kernel() methods that are computing left kernels.  A call to kernel() or left_kernel() should arrive at the top of the hierarchy where it would take a transpose and call the (specialized) right_kernel().  So there wouldn't be a change in behavior in routines currently calling kernel() or left_kernel(), and we would retain Sage's preference for the left by having the vanilla kernel() give back a left kernel.  The changes would be more efficient computationally and also make the code more expressive of what is really happening when and where. 

Patch submission:

This patch refactors matrix kernels: left, right, vanilla.

The primary goals were to (1) remove occurences of two consecutive transposes, and (2) make the code easier to follow by aligning method names with actual function.  There could probably still be some small improvements in rows versus columns, but these occurences are fairly localized.

The matrix2 class has each of these three calls, but most of the computation has been moved from left_kernel() to right_kernel().  Previously, two transposes were taken to get back a right kernel.  The vanilla kernel() is still synonymous with left_kernel().

In subclasses only one kernel is implemented, typically a right kernel since the algorithms used are for right kernels.  New advice in  matrix/dos.py  suggests this approach for implementers of new specialized subclasses.

In the matrix_integer_dense class the old  _kernel_gens_using_pari()  has been renamed _kernel_matrix_using_pari() for consistency - it only appears in the source nearby in this class.
Also, kernel_matrix() has been retained, but could probably be deprecated.  It has been replaced in function by the new  _right_kernel_matrix().  Debatable if this should be an internal function or not.

Some doctests were added.  Existing tests were mostly transposed on their inputs, so tests checked out against pre-existing outputs.

sage -testall   only returned two errors.  Both seemed spurious (environment variable, unicode complaint) and unrelated to matrix computations.

Timings:
There was a big speed-up in transposes that was discovered in the course of this work (changes implemented by Yann Laigle-Chapuy).  So much of the gain obtained by removing a double transpose has shrunk simply by improving the transpose itself.  Transpose speedup code is in 3.4.rc0, but not 3.3, so the timings below are consistent when one counts up the time devoted to transposes versus row-reducing.

```
n=2000
entries = [[1/(i+j+1) for i in srange(n)] for j in srange(n)]
a = matrix(QQ, entries)
time a.left_kernel()
time a.right_kernel()
```

```
              Left     Right
3.3:          50.09s  87.48s  
3.4.rc0:      13.22s  14.06s
w/ patch:     13.47s  11.74s
```

Hi Jason,

Thanks for looking at this.  I think the reject was my fault.  Partway through doing this I fixed a bug with #5408 and I don't think I got everything put back together right on this patch.  Apply just the new patch (version 2), and test matrices over ZZ with `algorithm='pari'` since that is where I had to reconstruct the mix-up.  I have tested this against all of the sage/matrix directory.

Thanks again - this will let me get to #5135.

* In matrix_integer_dense.pyx, you add a note to kernel_matrix() that tells the user that the preferred method is to call an underscore function.

Doctests pass in matrix/*.pyx.  They should be run on all of Sage for this one, though, since kernels are probably used in lots of places of Sage.

New patch ("_3") addresses all reviewer comments above, though I could only find one function that needed to have doctests added (`_kernel_matrix_using_pari`).

Passed the following tests:

sage -testall

sage -t --randorder sage/matrix/*

sage -docbuild reference pdf


Apply just this new (third) patch, which was built on 3.4.2.alpha0

Minh - timings are getting a bit dated, but are probably still accurate, though most of the speedup came from improvments discovered in transposes while working through this.  You could say "a 16% improvement in right kernels by eliminating paired transposes."
