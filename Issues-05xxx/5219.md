Many times the binaries cause trouble since we are building ATLAS with SSE3. So add a special flag which given the following setting

```
SAGE_SIMD_MODE=SSE2
```
produce an SSE2 only binary. If those flags are set we also need to make sure that sage-flags are set to sse2 only, i.e. no pni, no ssse3 or sse4_*.

Michael

This was not as simple than I thought it would be. To do this we need to do two things:

* disable the SSE3 detection by making it return "FAILURE" unconditionally
* select ARCH defaults that allow SSE2 on 32 and 64 bit boxen. ATLAS 3.8.2 only offers that for Hammer, i.e. ARCH=20.

When doing both of the above on sage.math we get an libatlas.a without any SSE3 instructions:

```
atlas-3.8.2.p2/Hammer/lib$ ~/SSE2-project/sse-2.bash libatlas.a 
found SSE2 addpd: 2
found SSE2 addsd: 2
found SSE2 movapd: 208
found SSE2 movlpd: 131
found SSE2 movsd: 4057
found SSE2 movupd: 1
found SSE2 mulpd: 2
found SSE2 mulsd: 2
found SSE2 orpd: 174
found SSE2 unpcklpd: 1
found SSE2 xorpd: 174
```

Contrast this with a PNI enabled ATLAS from the same machine:

```
atlas-3.8.2.p2/Hammer/lib$ ~/SSE2-project/sse-2.bash 
/scratch/mabshoff/sage-3.3.rc1/local/lib/libatlas.a

found SSE2 movhpd: 1092

found SSE2 movsd: 27295
found SSE2 movupd: 80

found SSE3 haddps: 530
found SSE3 movddup: 4

```
It is unclear how much of a performance penalty there is when selecting a Hammer ATLAS for a P4 arch, but it could be substantial. Someone needs to collect some numbers. It might be a good idea to tune the P4 kernels by selecting `-A 16`, but this would require adding tuning info for that config in 64 bits.

In the long term it might be beneficial to build ATLAS libs on various CPUs and then use a runtime selection to put the best version in LD_LIBRARY_PATH. 

I will build an spkg with the above changes since the SSE3 issue is really becoming a problem. One should note that for optimum performance one needs to build from sources.

Michael

Ok, no need to do something stupid with the probes. Clint come to the rescue:

Not only is there a plan, but it's been available since 3.8.0!  It's not
the easiest thing to grok, because one machine obviously can support many
vector extensions.  Here is the line from 'configure --help':
  -V #    # = ((1<<vecISA1) | (1<<vecISA2) | ... | (1<<vecISAN))

Now, since xprint_enums for some reason doens't print these values out,
I can oh so conveniently scope ATLAS/CONFIG/include/atlconf.h for:
  enum ISAEXT {ISA_None=0, ISA_AV, ISA_SSE3, ISA_SSE2, ISA_SSE1, ISA_3DNow};

Therefore, if I want no vector code at all, I throw '-V -0'; if I want
SSE2 & 1 but not 3, I throw (1<<3)+(1<<4) = 8+16=24, so '-V 24', and
bingo: no SSE3 even on a machine that does SSE3!

Cheers,
Clint
