The current (generic) code for is_primitive in rings/polynomial/polynomial_element.pyx is

```
        if not self.is_irreducible():
            return False
        p = self.parent().characteristic()
        n = p ** self.degree() - 1
        y = self.parent().quo(self).gen()
        for d in n.prime_divisors():
            if ( y ** (n//d) ) == 1:
                return False
        return True
```
Note that the integer n and its prime divisors are calculated as part of the algorithm.  This calculation can be lengthy for large n, and can dominate the running time of the algorithm.

The proposed patch adds optional arguments to is_primitive to provide the results of these calculations -- useful for is_primitive tests for multiple polynomials of the same degree.

I think the `(default: None)` is supposed to be at the end of the overall description. If you know better I am happy to be convinced otherwise though. 

It might be a good idea to ask somebody else how they feel about this patch because we introduce a neat way to shoot oneself in the foot.

btw. when you add a patch you should add `[with patch, needs review]` to the title of the ticket.

This looks ok to me, though I think you could delete the second paragraph of the docstring (it's a bit too detailed).

For the code itself one could also use the (generic) order_from_multiple() function like this:

```
return order_from_multiple(y,n,n_prime_divs,operation='*')==n
```
since the order_from_multiple() function (which I wrote) already takes the list of prime divisors of n as a parameter, computing it if it is not given.  I just tried that on a poly of degree 257 over GF(2) and it worked fine (I was impressed at Sage's ability to factor the 78-digit number `2^257-1`!).  It does do a little more work though as it finds the exact order.

There seems to be quite a large literature on finding primitive polynomials which may include better tests of primitivity.  I'll take a look at some of those when I'm back at work.

Positive review!  I have made some cosmetic changes, only to the docstring and NotImplemented message, and added some more relevant tests.

The second patch replaces the first, and (also) applies to 3.4.

For future reference, I am running a Pentium 4, 2.4 GHz with 2 GB of RAM.  Here is some sample code I used to measure the performance difference on my system.

```
  R.<x> = PolynomialRing(GF(2), 'x')

  # degree 128
  nn = 128
  max_order = 2^nn - 1
  pdivs = max_order.prime_divisors()

  # find a primitive poly
  print "Finding a primitive polynomial of degree "+str(nn)+" for timing test."
  poly = R.random_element(nn)
  while not (poly.degree()==nn and poly.is_primitive(max_order, pdivs)):
    poly = R.random_element(nn)

  timeit('max_order.prime_divisors()')
  # 25 loops, best of 3: 20.9 ms per loop
  timeit('poly.is_primitive(max_order, pdivs)')
  # 5 loops, best of 3: 1 s per loop
  timeit('poly.is_primitive()')
  # 5 loops, best of 3: 1.03 s per loop

  # degree 256
  nn = 256
  max_order = 2^nn - 1
  pdivs = max_order.prime_divisors()

  # find a primitive poly
  print "Finding a primitive polynomial of degree "+str(nn)+" for timing test."
  poly = R.random_element(nn)
  while not (poly.degree()==nn and poly.is_primitive(max_order, pdivs)):
    poly = R.random_element(nn)

  timeit('max_order.prime_divisors()')  # this takes a long time
  # 5 loops, best of 3: 9.3 s per loop
  timeit('poly.is_primitive(max_order, pdivs)')
  # 5 loops, best of 3: 2.67 s per loop
  timeit('poly.is_primitive()')  # this takes a longer time
  # 5 loops, best of 3: 11.5 s per loop
```
The actual speedup, of course, depends on how many times you're calling is_primitive for the same degree (if you have to call prime_divisors() for each degree) and the actual degrees.  Typically speedups will be greater for higher degrees.
