From sage-support:

```
sage: M1 = matrix(ZZ,2,[[-1,0],[0,1]]) 
sage: M2 = matrix(ZZ,2,[[1,0],[0,-1]]) 
sage: M3 = matrix(ZZ,2,[[-1,0],[0,-1]]) 
sage: MG = MatrixGroup([M1, M2, M3]) 
sage: MG.order() 
    4 
sage: MG.list() 
    Traceback (click to the left for traceback) 
    ... 
    AttributeError: 'sage.rings.integer_ring.IntegerRing_class' object 
has 
    no attribute 'prime_subfield' 
```

The offending code is in groups/matrix_gps/matrix_group.py where the problem is in the list method of MatrixGroup.

```
429        F = self.field_of_definition()
430        n = F.degree()
431        p = F.characteristic()
432        a = F.prime_subfield().multiplicative_generator()
433        b = F.multiplicative_generator()
```

In the class definition of MatrixGroup, any base ring is allowed.  But at least this particular method (others?) assume that the base ring is in fact in a field.  

Since a and b above are definitely used later in list(), as this all calls GAP, someone with a good knowledge of GAP should address this - and look for other places it's assumed that the base ring is a field and at least catch that exception with a better error message.

This passes sage -t but sage -testall has lots of (unrelated I think) failures. It simply fixes the bug reported and adds the required docstring examples.

Against 3.4:

patching file sage/groups/matrix_gps/matrix_group.py
Hunk #1 FAILED at 410
1 out of 3 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file sage/groups/matrix_gps/matrix_group.py.rej
abort: patch failed to apply

The hunk that didn't apply was the documentation hunk, as it turns out, unsurprisingly.

So it does need a rebase.  Sorry it took a while to be able to check this; it's sometimes complicated for me to do these things in a timely fashion, particularly with the 3.4 upgrade this was the case.
