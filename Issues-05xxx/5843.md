```
Consider the following class (simplified from a real life example, after 3 hours of heisenbug debugging):

```
class bla:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
    #
    @cached_method
    def f(self, x):
        return self.value
```

The method f ignores its input, and should return self.value:

```
sage: x = bla(1)
sage: y = bla(2)
sage: x.f(None)
1
sage: y.f(None)
2
```

Then, y.f(x.f) should ignore the inner x.f and return 2. It does not:

```
sage: sage: y.f(x.f)
1
```

The reason is that x.f and y.f, and all other instances of bla share the same cached_method object.

```
sage: x.f is y.f
True
sage: x.f is x.__class__.f
True
```

and the _instance field is set to the latest instance for which this method has been queried:

```
sage: yf = y.f
sage: yf._instance is y
True
sage: x.f
Cached version of <function f at 0xb532d84>
sage: yf._instance is y
False
sage: yf._instance is x
True
```

Most of the time things work well, but there can be race conditions, as in the example above.

Possible correct implementation:
   cached_method could return a closure instead of function object. Upon assignment to the
   class, this closure would become just a usual unbound method, removing the need to handle
   by hand the instance binding.

I added a patch that returns a (newly created) `CachedMethodCaller` object from `CachedMethod.__get__` that stores the instance on which the `CachedMethod` was called.

Additionally this object has a `__get__` of its own that does the same to handle stored copies of `CachedMethodCaller`s, which is something that categories seem to do.

Using a function/closure would also handle the caching (and I added a comment in the patch on how to do it exactly), but you would lose the ability to call methods like `is_in_cache()` which are used in some places in sage.

Excellent patch (I couldn't figure out how to fix this, glad you did), but there doesn't seem to be a test for the main problem:

```
class bla:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
    #
    @cached_method
    def f(self, x):
        return self.value
```

The method f ignores its input, and should return self.value:

```
sage: x = bla(1)
sage: y = bla(2)
sage: x.f(None)
1
sage: y.f(None)
2
```

Then, y.f(x.f) should ignore the inner x.f and return 2. It does not:

```
sage: sage: y.f(x.f)
1
```
