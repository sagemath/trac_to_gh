Positive noninteger powers of RDF(0) give nan rather than zero:

```
  sage: RDF(0)^.5
  nan

  sage: RDF(0)^(1/2)
  nan
```

In contrast, noninteger powers of CDF(0) have the correct value:

```
  sage: CDF(0)^.5
  0

  sage: CDF(0)^(1/2)
  0
```

**Keywords:** RDF, __pow__, zero

Hmm, we have some trivial doctest failures:

```
sage -t -long "devel/sage/sage/rings/real_double.pyx"       
**********************************************************************
File "/scratch/mabshoff/sage-3.4.1.rc3/devel/sage/sage/rings/real_double.pyx", line 1543:
    sage: RDF(0)^.5
Expected:
    0
Got:
    0.0
**********************************************************************
File "/scratch/mabshoff/sage-3.4.1.rc3/devel/sage/sage/rings/real_double.pyx", line 1545:
    sage: RDF(0)^(1/2)
Expected:
    0
Got:
    0.0
**********************************************************************
```

I think other than that this is good to go.
