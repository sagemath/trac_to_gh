```
Positive noninteger powers of RDF(0) give nan rather than zero:

```
  sage: RDF(0)^.5
  nan

  sage: RDF(0)^(1/2)
  nan
```

In contrast, noninteger powers of CDF(0) have the correct value:

```
  sage: CDF(0)^.5
  0

  sage: CDF(0)^(1/2)
  0
```

Assignee: somebody

Keywords: RDF, __pow__, zero

Resolution: fixed

I think other than that this is good to go.
