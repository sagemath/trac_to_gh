If you create a block like this:

```
%time 
2+2
```
in the notebook, then you get the following output:

```
Traceback (click to the left for traceback)
...
NameError: name 'time' is not defined
```

IMPORTANT: There is a single space right immediately after %time in the input!  Without the space things are fine.

Yes.    splitlines and split('\n') have different semantics.  I changed to splitlines in anticipation of windows. 

You're right, using i=0 makes more sense, though of course won't make any difference since in this special case the list we're slicing is empty.
