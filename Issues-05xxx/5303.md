Hi John,

there are several suggestions on how to fix this:

* start off with 40 bit of precision, but this might hide a bug
* check if the value is within some eps of 1, the same comment about hiding a bug might apply here

Thoughts?

Cheers,

Michael

This patch avoids the computation for prec=30 and thus gets rid of the numerical problem. This might not be the right long term fix, but it is a good fix for 3.3.

John: If you think that this should be reverted and fixed in some other way please open another ticket in case this got merged.

Cheers,

Michael
