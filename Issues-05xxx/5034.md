I just noticed that when we do "sage -br" with "export MAKE='make -j3'" on a 2-core machine we get:

```
steragon-2:sage-3.3.alpha0 wstein$ sage -br
...
Execute 4 commands (using 3 cpus)
```

Note the "3 cpus", which looks really dumb, since I have only 1 cpu in my laptop, and it has 2 cores.  To fix this bug change "cpus" to "threads".  That's it!

Of course, "threads" is also technically incorrect; "processes" would be more accurate.
