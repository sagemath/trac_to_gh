This module implements word paths which belongs to Discrete Geometry seen from Combinatorics on Words point of view. A word path is the representation of a word
as a discrete path in a two (or more) dimensions space using a one-to-one
correspondence between the alphabet and a set of vectors called steps. Using combinatorics on words, many problems on discrete polygons on 2d lattice grid may be solved in linear time in length of the perimeter (self-intersecting, area, inertia moment, etc.). For now, the goal is to create all the classes hierarchy. Cool algorithms will come into an other ticket.

Here are some examples taken from the documentation of the current state of paths.py available in the sage-combinat tree.

The combinatorial class of all paths defined over three given steps:

```
sage: P = WordPaths('abc', steps=[(1,2), (-3,4), (0,-3)]); P
Finite Word Paths over 3 steps
```

Creation of a path from the combinatorial class P:

```
sage: p = P('abaccba'); p
Path: abaccba
sage: list(p.points())
[(0, 0), (1, 2), (-2, 6), (-1, 8), (-1, 5), (-1, 2), (-4, 6), (-3, 8)]
sage: p.is_closed()
False
sage: p.plot() 
```

Since p is a finite word, many functions from the word library are available:

```
sage: p.crochemore_factorization()
(a.b.a.c.c.ba)
sage: p.is_palindrome()
False
sage: p[:3]
Path: aba
sage: len(p)
7 
```

Some built-in combinatorial classes of paths:

```
sage: P = WordPaths('abAB', steps='square_grid'); P
Finite Word Paths on the square grid
```

```
sage: D = WordPaths('()', steps='dyck'); D
Finite Dyck paths
sage: d = D('()()()(())'); d
Path: ()()()(())
sage: d.plot()
```

```
sage: P = WordPaths('abcdef', steps='triangle_grid')
sage: p = P('babaddefadabcadefaadfafabacdefa')
sage: p.plot() 
```

sage: p = P('abbbbccd')
sage: p.
p.animate           p.find              p.points
p.area              p.has_prefix        p.rename
p.category          p.has_suffix        p.reset_name
p.count             p.is_closed         p.rfind
p.db                p.is_prefix         p.save
p.directive_vector  p.is_simple         p.start_point
p.dump              p.is_suffix         p.tikz_trajectory
p.dumps             p.length            p.version
p.end_point         p.plot          
```

But since I still want to know if a wordpath is a palindrome and other questions already implemented for words, something like below could exist :

```
sage: P = WordPaths('abcd')
sage: p = P('abbbbccd')
sage: p.to_word()
sage: p.
Display all 146 possibilities? (y or n)
sage: p.is_palindrome()
False
```

Of course I would want the `to_word` to be constant time (no copy) : I am thinking of simply adding the `FiniteWord` class to the base classes of `p`.


Franco, Mike Hansen : Do you have any comments ? I am sure you have useful ideas I could use!

Thank you,

Sébastien

You need to decide whether or not a "wordpath" is a word. If it is, then it
should inherit all the methods. A user will be totally confused if it is
supposed to be a word but doesn't behave like one.

If it is not a word, then having a `to_word` method is fine, but it
needs to return a word. In your suggestion, it returns `None` but this
is unusual since most `to_*` methods in Sage (at least in combinatorics
code) do not modify the original object but return a new object. 

Perhaps you want to work with paths instead of word paths?


> Of course I would want the `to_word` to be constant time (no copy) : I am thinking of simply adding the `FiniteWord` class to the base classes of `p`.


The creation of u in the following is constant time:

```
sage: w = Word([0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1])
sage: u = Word(w._data)
```

Hope this helps.

I want a word path to be a word. So, I will keep it as it is.

> Hope this helps.


Yes, thank you!

I added a patch that improves the documentation and that suggests to use `help(p)` to get the specific word paths functions.

Needs review!
