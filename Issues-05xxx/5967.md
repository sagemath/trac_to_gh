This patch implements a simple class ElementWrapper for wrapping Sage
or Python objects as Sage elements, with reasonable default
implementations of repr, cmp, hash, etc. The typical use case is for
trivially constructing new element classes from preexisting Sage or
Python classes, with a containment relation.

This class is used extensively in the examples of the upcoming category framework patch #5891.

This is broken:

```
 	129	            sage: cmp(l11, l12), cmp(l12, l11)   # values differ 
 	130	            (-1, 1) 
 	131	            sage: cmp(l11, l21), cmp(l21, l11)   # parents differ 
 	132	            (-1, 1) 
```
**Never** check the return value of `cmp` to be -1 or 1, but always write

```
sage: cmp(l11, l21) in [-1,1]
True
```
since the value depends on memory location. I have had to fix this literally dozens of times in doctests.

Cheers,

<a id='comment:8'>**Comment 8:**</a>
The tests of the patch pass when applied to sage-3.4.2.

Besides the application to the category framework #5891,
this patch will be useful for crystals. For example the
class Letter(Element):
in /combinat/crystals/letters.py
can be shortened by inheriting from ElementWrapper.

I give this patch a positive review!
