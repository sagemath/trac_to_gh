As is, it appears that 3d plots are wrong, according to the jmol axes, because the jmol axes apparently don't default to being centered at the origin.  This patch makes the jmol axes centered at the origin.  To show the jmol axes, you still need to right-click on the jmol plot, select Style, then Axes.

Also, and perhaps that merits a new ticket, the orientation of the axis is not what one would expect.

Normally 3d plots are shown with the positive x axis to the viewer's left, the positive y axis to the right, and the positive z upwards. Currently it is: negative y axis to the left, positive x to the right, and positive z upwards.
