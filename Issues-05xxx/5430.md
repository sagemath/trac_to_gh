The coercion seems to be fine, but the Coleman integral fails:

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ['x']
sage: H = HyperellipticCurve(x*(x-1)*(x+9))
sage: K = Qp(7,10)
sage: HK = H.change_ring(K)
sage: import sage.schemes.elliptic_curves.monsky_washnitzer as mw
sage: M_frob, forms = mw.matrix_of_frobenius_hyperelliptic(HK)
sage: w = HK.invariant_differential()
sage: x,y = HK.monsky_washnitzer_gens()
sage: f = forms[0]
sage: S= HK(9,36)
sage: Q = HK.teichmuller(S)
sage: P = HK(-1,4)
sage: b = x*w*w._coeff.parent()(f)            #this is ok
sage: HK.coleman_integral(b,P,Q)              #this is not
```
