Based on a question from Alex Raichev (http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/71483789bc7fefb7#), I discovered this:

```
sage: var('t')
t
sage: F = NumberField(t^2+1, 'a')
sage: R.<x,y> = F[]
sage: type(x.coefficients()[0])
<type 'sage.rings.number_field.number_field_element.NumberFieldElement_absolute'>
sage: F(1) + x.coefficients()[0]


------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occured in SAGE.
This probably occured because a *compiled* component
of SAGE has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
or is not properly wrapped with _sig_on, _sig_off.
You might want to run SAGE under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
SAGE will now terminate (sorry).
