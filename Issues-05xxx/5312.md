There is a weird interaction between time and preparser, almost as if input to time is being preparsed *twice*:

```
wstein@sage:~/build/sage-3.3.rc1$ ./sage
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Sage Version 3.3.rc1, Release Date: 2009-02-16                     |
| Type notebook() for the GUI, and license() for information.        |
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage: k = 3r
sage: type(k)
<type 'int'>
sage: time k = 3r
CPU times: user 0.00 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.00 s
Wall time: 0.00 s
sage: type(k)
<type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>
sage: preparse('k = 3r')
'k = 3'
sage: preparse('time k = 3r')
'time k = 3'
```

In the above, type(k) should have been int in all cases.  Why isn't it the second time.  WEIRD.

<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

This works now:

```
sage: k = 3r
sage: type(k)
<type 'int'>
sage: time k = 3r
Time: CPU 0.00 s, Wall: 0.00 s
sage: type(k)

```

Where's the best place to add a doctest?

I think we can just mark it as invalid since "%time" is now handled by IPython.
