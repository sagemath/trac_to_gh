The spkg at

 http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/release-cycles-3.3/alpha6/mpfr-2.4.0.spkg

updates the mpfr.spkg to latest upstream. For now the test suite is invoked automatically. It passes on

SkyNet:

* eno (x86_64, FC9)
* mark (Sparc, Solaris)
* fulvia (x86, Solaris)
* cicero (x86, FC9)
* menas (x86_64, OpenSUSE 10.3)
* iras (Itanium, SLES 10)
* cleo (Itanium, RHEL 5.2)
* varro (PPC, OSX 10.4)

Misc machines:

* bsd (x86, OSX 10.5)
* sage.math (x86_64, Ubuntu LTS 8.04)
* sprocketer (x86-64, OSX 10.5)

with MPIR-0.9.rc3, which will be updated via a separate ticket.

Paul,

I can supply you with the config.guess output of all the machines above in case you want it for the MPFR website. I can also test on MIPS64/Linux.
