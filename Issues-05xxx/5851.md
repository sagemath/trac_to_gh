The patch fully ReST-ifies the files
* ell_field.py
* ec_database.py
* kodaira_symbol.py
in sage/schemes/elliptic_curves, and adds them to the reference manual.

These are all quite short and simple.  The patch is based on 3.4.1.rc4.

John, at home I manage to produce the correct html output and all tests passed. I am quite certain the patch is ok, but a 50% success rate is maybe too low. So I am going back to see what went wrong in my office.

OK. Now it works on my office installation of sage, too. I can not reproduce the earlier error and hence I can give a positive review.

This issues of this trac, namely to improve the documentation of elliptic curves, continues in trac #5853.
