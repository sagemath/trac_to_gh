```
The patch fully ReST-ifies the files
* ell_field.py
* ec_database.py
* kodaira_symbol.py
in sage/schemes/elliptic_curves, and adds them to the reference manual.

These are all quite short and simple.  The patch is based on 3.4.1.rc4.

OK. Now it works on my office installation of sage, too. I can not reproduce the earlier error and hence I can give a positive review.

This issues of this trac, namely to improve the documentation of elliptic curves, continues in trac #5853.
