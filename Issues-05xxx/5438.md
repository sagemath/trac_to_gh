The following example from documentation seems to work:

```
def b(n): return lambda x: bessel_J(n, x) + 0.5*(n-1)
plot([b(c) for c in [1..5]], 0, 40, fill = dict([(i, i+1) for i in [0..3]]))
```
but the behavior is the same as

```
def b(n): return lambda x: bessel_J(n, x) + 0.5*(n-1)
plot([b(c) for c in [1..5]], 0, 40, fill = dict([(i, 5) for i in [0..3]]))
```
or anything else that evaluates to True as the second element of the dict.  The proper behavior is 

```
def b(n): return lambda x: bessel_J(n, x) + 0.5*(n-1)
plot([b(c) for c in [1..5]], 0, 40, fill = dict([(i, [i+1]) for i in [0..3]]))
```
which is incidentally quite beautiful.

There are a few other such misleading/wrong example, and the documentation for how to use a dictionary which is a little confusing for people not familiar with Python yet

However, this is really related to a bug, namely that for some reason the option of plotting between a function and a line isn't parsing properly.  These should hopefully be easy to fix and are closely related enough that one ticket seemed appropriate.

Problem is that the first check in fill is for 

```
            if fill == 'axis' or fill == True:
```
and we have

```
sage: preparse('5==True')
'Integer(5)==True'
sage: 5==True
True
```
A change to 

```
            if fill == 'axis' or fill is True:
```
solves the problem, and then improving doc is easy.  I should be able to do this within a day or two.

In addition to changing "==" to "is", this patch fixes a lot of minor issues in plot that I discovered while fixing this issue, mostly around documentation of the adaptive refinement, but also some weird bugs in error handling that nobody noticed since who sets verbose=1 on a regular basis?

I didn't add doctests for the change from (msg, x) to (msg, xi) since it refers to the line of code and I figured that is a big hassle to change every time the plot code is changed, but if a referee disagrees they may add some.  I also removed the final exceptions+=1 block in the generate_plot_points since it seemed to be redundant, but if that's wrong then bring it back.  Otherwise I think everything works.

Hmm, I would say that the answer is yes, because I didn't change that part of the code:

```
sage: from sage.ext.fast_eval import fast_float, fast_float_constant, is_fast_float
sage: fill=3
sage: hasattr(fill,'__call__')
False
sage: float(fill)
3.0
sage: fill='3'
sage: hasattr(fill,'__call__')
False
sage: float(fill)
3.0
```
So since that string can be coerced to a float, apparently the original author intended this behavior (even if implicitly).  Which certainly seems reasonable to me; it's not clear that it should throw an exception, and I can't think of another reasonable legitimate interpretation.

It is also unclear to me if the changes here do not degrade the default plot settings since the now the adaptive plotting seems to generate fewer points.

For some reason, I thought the bug in question was evident in the main branch as well, meaning it would have had nothing to do with this patch. I see now that this is not the case; I must have got branches confused. Thanks for catching my mistake :).

kcrisman: Might this bug have something to do with line 3037?

Certainly line 3037 must be the issue.   This was done to be consistent with another place where a delta occurs, which after all had the correct *mathematical* version of delta (since the number of plot points is actually n+1 for the usual definition of n in Riemann sums etc.).  I am sorry I didn't catch this earlier, but my computer consistently times out testing both calculus.py and plot.py, so I literally cannot catch these types of failed tests en masse.  I should have tried them by hand, though.

Anyway, I don't think it necessarily downgrades the adaptive plotting significantly.  Note that for i=15 in the second example it actually increases the plot_points by 3!  When I run the old code, incidentally, I get

```
sage: [len(generate_plot_points(f, (-pi, pi), adaptive_tolerance=i)) for i in [0.01, 0.001, 0.0001]]

which is better for some, worse for others.  Also note that this shows the test is *random* so this should have been caught earlier, unless current_randstate().python_random().random is set earlier?  I'll set randomize=False for the test.

This has added doctest, clarified yet more stuff, changed f to f(x) in anticipation of the Pynac switch (since the doctests would happen outside of plotting), and also fixed one weird but inconsequential bug in the slope field plot (sqrt was imported twice, but only the second one counted - which was good, because symbolic is what you want there).
