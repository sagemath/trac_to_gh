This was reported in IRC:

```

[02:28am] tringlarido: I had a problem with compiling the sage3-3 sources.
[02:29am] mabs: hi
[02:29am] mabs: What platform are you on?
[02:29am] tringlarido: The install exit exactly at the same step than

[02:30am] mabs: Ok, I see what the problem is.
```
I reenabled padlock support in 3.3 since the libgcrypt people claimed that it had been fixed. The spkg at 

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/release-cycles-3.4/alpha0/libgcrypt-1.4.3.p0.spkg

disables it again and also adds Solaris 64 bit build support while I am in there :)

Cheers,

Michael

And it seems to work:

```

[02:44am] tringlarido: I restart the build, but I don't know where it 
starts from (the beginning ?). I well tell you if it works. Thanks.
[02:45am] mabs: It will restart from where it left of.
[02:45am] mabs: I.e it will build libgrcypt first.
[02:45am] tringlarido: OK. I saw the libcrypt build just pass.
[02:45am] mabs: The log should be scrolling by, so you should see 
then the next one is done.
[02:45am] mabs: Ok great.
```

We still do need a formal review of the spkg, but that shouldn't be too much work.

Cheers,

Michael
