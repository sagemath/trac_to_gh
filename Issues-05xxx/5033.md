There are two problem here:

```
sage: B = matrix(QQ, 2, [1..4])
sage: B.lift()
...
AttributeError: 'RationalField' object has no attribute 'cover_ring'
sage: B.lift?
            EXAMPLES:
...
```          

1. lift should first check if there is a cover_ring attribute.  If not, I think lift should just return self.

2. The lift function is undocumented.  It just has examples but no description of what it is supposed to do.
