Pointed out by rlm-- digraphs can have two paths between a pair of vertices without being multiple edged graphs.  So the graph

```
sage: G = DiGraph({1:{2: 'h'}, 2:{1:'g'}})
```
is drawn with only one straight-line arrow even though there are two edges.  Basically, this will just require a quick check for this case and then treating such a graph the same as a multidigraph.

Also, need to update multiple_edges and loops function calls in graph_plot.py to match the new function definitions has_multiple_edges and has_loops in graph.py

Pretty straightforward stuff... I should have a patch up in 3, 2, 1...
