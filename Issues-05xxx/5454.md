It looks like the proposed renaming of _l_action_ etc hasn't yet happened, and we *seriously need* some documentation for the coercion model -- I've written or contributed to dozens of sage parent/element classes and I never knew half of this stuff, I learnt loads just from a five-minute skim-read of the new docs. We must get this into a release ASAP.

It's a great shame that this patch has been in limbo for three months just because our hackish use of text search for "positive review" in the summary field missed it due to a typo.
