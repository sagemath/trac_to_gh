Running

```
sage -t devel/sage/sage/rings/polynomial/pbori.pyx
```
seems to not work for me sometimes when the current working directory is not SAGE_ROOT.  I don't really understand what is going wrong here, since there is a "cd" in $SAGE_ROOT/sage, but I've heard other people complain about issues with this.

The attached patch caused the problems to go away for me.

It should not work.  "sage -t" is supposed to take the path to a file.  If you're not in SAGE_ROOT, then devel/sage/sage/rings/polynomial/pbori.pyx is not a file.  It's like with any other unix command.  E.g., you wouldn't expect 

```
cat devel/sage/sage/rings/polynomial/pbori.pyx
```
to magically work if you're not in SAGE_ROOT.

Note that Mike Hansen just gave this a positive review.  I strongly disagree.

Hi William,

My motivation for this change was that when you run "sage -testall", for each test it prints out what it is running as 

sage -t devel/sage/sage/rings/polynomial/pbori.py

since $SAGE_ROOT/sage changes directory to SAGE_ROOT before proceeding.

So that if you copy-and-paste that output from "sage -testall" to run the test a second time, it doesn't work.
