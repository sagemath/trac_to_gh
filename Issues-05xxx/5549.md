```
At the command line,

```
import scipy
scipy.sin??
```
falls back to just giving the docstring (like `scipy.sin?`), plus an additional notation that says `[source file open failed]`.  In the notebook, the same thing only gives 

```
No object scipy.sin
```
The notebook should fall back to ? help when ?? help fails, like the command line does.

Upstream: **Fixed upstream, but not in a stable release.**

FWIW this appears to be fixed.  I don't know since when, but it's probably been fixed in IPython for a while.  Indeed `??` now falls back on `?` if it can't get the source code of an object.
