```
A few changes to

* Enable jsMath in static and offline docs.

* Display a Sage favicon in static and offline docs.

* Display a Sage logo in live, static, and offline docs.

"Offline" docs are just those accessed via file:///.

I'm not sure whether/how Mercurial handles binary files, so I've attached two patches.  One mentions the added favicon and logo files; the other doesn't.  To get the png files themselves in the right place, I first created doc/common/static.  Then, in this directory I did

wget http://www.sagemath.org/pix/sageicon.png

and

ln -s ../../../../../data/extcode/notebook/images/sagelogo.png .

I've attached these, too.

Note: There's a favicon.ico in the same extcode directory, but it's not transparent.  There is another sagelogo.png in SAGE_ROOT/data/extcode/images, but its dimensions are larger.

The jsMath issue was mentioned on sage-devel:

http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/40eab3f9610e061d/eb93a3930e79ea3a?#eb93a3930e79ea3a

The favicon and logo were mentioned in connection with a doc sidebar toggle:

http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/8c8fe7c5d0c0f725/4807f5553bdbd6b0?#4807f5553bdbd6b0

I'll make a separate ticket for the toggle.

**Resolution:** fixed

**Author:** Mitesh Patel, John Palmieri

**Reviewer:** John Palmieri, Robert Miller

**Merged:** sage-4.1.rc0

To create a patch that contains a png you need to export a git style patch. Then export two patches, one for the Sage library and one for the ext repo. The names should be 

* trac_5799_sage_$FOO
* trac_5799_ext_$BAR
 
respectively. It is generally a good idea to split tickets into independent tasks, i.e. this is a borderline case and can be done via one ticket.

This also strikes me as kind of odd:

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="../../../../../../../local/notebook/javascript/jsmath/easy/load.js"></script> 
```
given that everywhere else we use 

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="/javascript_local/$FOO"></script>
```
but that might be unavoidable. 


Cheers,

Michael

The `*_v2` pair replaces the earlier versions.

* Same [sageicon.png](http://www.sagemath.org/pix/sageicon.png) as in the first patch.
* ImageMagick gives a "true" ico file: `convert sageicon.png favicon.ico`.
* Tested in FF3, O9 on Linux, and in Cr2, FF3, IE8, O9, S3 on Windows XP. Whether the icon is transparent and visible for live, static, and offline docs is browser-dependent.
* Automatic relative paths for the favicon, logo, and jsMath.  This is important, e.g., in the reference manual.
* #4714 should take care of the unknown jsMath macros.

The new patch seems to have the same observable effect as the previous set in the usual browsers on Linux and Windows XP.  But the AMS symbol font `msbm10` won't be available in the static and offline docs.

Perhaps we can make the symbolic link itself in jsMath's `spkg-install`.  Does this mean we should remove the link from version control?  If so, we're [almost] done.

This [attachment:trac_5799-redux_setup_py.patch patch] alters `setup.py` so that it preserves symlinks.  However, I'm far from convinced that it's the right approach.  Is it possible to identify and copy broken links in Python?  In particular:

* In `sage_findall()`, can we refine or avoid using the exception handler?  Perhaps it's better to use [os.walk()](http://markmail.org/message/dcv4g5b2b4exw64u), but the `os.path.is*()` family actually follows symlinks.
* Is there a Pythonic analogue of `cp --preserve=links --no-dereference`?

Possible alternatives:

* Make a symlink in some `spkg-install`.
* Have Mercurial reconstitute the link.
