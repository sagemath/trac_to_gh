The current description for adding a new Cython module is outdated:

http://www.sagemath.org/doc/prog/node29.html

```
3. Create a .pyx file in the Sage library and add a listing for it to the variable
ext_modules in the file SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/setup.py. For example, the file 
SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/sage/graphs/chrompoly.pyx has lines

    Extension('sage.graphs.chrompoly',
              ['sage/graphs/chrompoly.pyx']
              ), \

in setup.py. Also, the module - in this example sage.graphs.chrompoly - needs to be 
added to the packages list in setup.py . Then type sage -b to build Sage with the new 
code.
```

Here is a fix. However, it looks like `SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/doc/en/developer/coding_in_other.rst` isn't under any version control. Therefore, I'll just post a replacement docstring here. Hopefully, someone can help me include it in the appropriate file.

```
#. Create a .pyx file and add it to the Sage library.


   #. First, add a listing for the Cython extension to the variable
      ``ext_modules`` in the file
      ``SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/module_list.py``. See the
      ``distutils.extension.Extension`` class for more information on creating
      a new Cython extension.

   #. Then, add the module name to the ``packages`` list in the file
      ``SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/setup.py``.

   #. Run ``sage -b`` to rebuild Sage with the new code.


   For example, the file ``SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/sage/graphs/chrompoly.pyx``
   has the lines

::

    Extension('sage.graphs.chompoly',
              sources = ['sage/graphs/chrompoly.pyx']),

   in ``module_list.py``. In addition, ``sage.graphs`` is included in the
   packages list under the Distutils section of ``setup.py``.
