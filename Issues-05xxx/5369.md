I did only one ticket for both as they are both gmp based.

I mostly copied the logic used in the __copy__ function (by the way I also simplified the __copy__ function in matrix_rational_dense.pyx)

timings (wall time) for

```
m=identity_matrix(3000);
time m2=m.transpose(); m3=m.antitranspose();
```
* sage 3-3: 15.44
* with #5345: 3.38
* with this patch: 2.01

Looks good.  I updated the patch to the new docstring format in 3.4.

Apply only trac-5369-transpose-gmp-matrix.2.patch
