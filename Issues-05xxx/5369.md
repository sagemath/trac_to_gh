I did only one ticket for both as they are both gmp based.

I mostly copied the logic used in the __copy__ function (by the way I also simplified the __copy__ function in matrix_rational_dense.pyx)

timings (wall time) for

```
m=identity_matrix(3000);
time m2=m.transpose(); m3=m.antitranspose();
```
