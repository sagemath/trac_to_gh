matrix_integer_dense and matrix_rational_dense don't have any optimize transpose functions, so add it.

Attachment: **[trac-5369-transpose-gmp-matrix.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket5369/trac-5369-transpose-gmp-matrix.patch.gz)**

I did only one ticket for both as they are both gmp based.

I mostly copied the logic used in the `__copy__` function (by the way I also simplified the `__copy__` function in matrix_rational_dense.pyx)

timings (wall time) for

```
m=identity_matrix(3000);
time m2=m.transpose(); m3=m.antitranspose();
```
