See a comment on #5366. When one does doctest Sage with -tp and GAP has been updated, but Sage not started the creation of the workspace is racy since many processes will try to update it at the same time.

Starting up Sage once at the start of -tp via "sage -c" ought to fix the problem.

Cheers,

Michael
