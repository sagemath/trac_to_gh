From #5400:

Me:

```
I assume you know about the CC field, so what is the problem? 
```
Jason:

```
The only CC option I have now with the new trac is to add 
myself. It's not a text box anymore. 
```

Cheers,

Michael

Jason,

I have granted authenticated users the permission "TICKET_EDIT_CC" - please check if you now can change the CC field and give this ticket a positive review in that case.
