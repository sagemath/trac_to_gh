The patch makes the cell containing:

```
show(plot(x^2, (x, -2,2)))
print "hi"
```
display the plot before printing "hi".  This makes it much easier to construct nice-looking output.

William should get author credit on this one as well as me, since he showed how it could be done in a demo.

Well, unless William wants to review it.

In a sense, I reviewed his demo; I suppose he could review the actual patch.

A note about the patch: sage.misc.misc was imported twice in plot.py.  I changed one of those imports to import the html function.

Despite rumors to the contrary, there are several hundred doctests in the notebook directory, and your new code breaks two in cell.py, so post a patch that fixes those doctest breaks:
