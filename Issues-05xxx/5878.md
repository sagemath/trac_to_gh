The patch adds functionality to construct Young's seminormal and orthogonal representations as well as the Specht representation. This is done via Yang-Baxter graphs, so the patch implements that as well.

Warning: The patch depends on #5877.

But it doesn't have to though: #5877 fixes an issue that is required for the `to_character` method, and this method is not necessary for the rest of the code.
