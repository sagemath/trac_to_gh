The patch adds functionality to construct Young's seminormal and orthogonal representations as well as the Specht representation. This is done via Yang-Baxter graphs, so the patch implements that as well.

I can't reproduce this. When I run the tests, with or without #6048, I get no failures:

Can you re-check this?

Things look good to me after I've applied my reviewer patch which takes care of the issues with the upgrade to 4.0.
