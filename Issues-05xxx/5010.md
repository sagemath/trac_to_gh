We are seeing the following doctest failure:

```
**********************************************************************
File "/home/mabshoff/build-3.2.3.final/sage-3.2.3.final-fulvia/devel/sage/sage/rings/real_double.pyx", line 1311:
    sage: RDF(0).log()
Expected:
    -inf
Got:
    -Infinity
**********************************************************************
File "/home/mabshoff/build-3.2.3.final/sage-3.2.3.final-fulvia/devel/sage/sage/rings/real_double.pyx", line 1313:
    sage: RDF(-1).log()
Expected:
    nan
Got:
    -NaN
```
This is because we are using the C library instead of RDF to create inf and nan.

Note that this is a different issue than #672.

Cheers,

Michael
