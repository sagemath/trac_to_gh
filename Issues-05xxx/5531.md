REFEREE REPORT



The patch **quaternion_docstring_fix.patch** applied OK against Sage 3.4, doctests passed even with the `-long` option, and the reference manual builds fine. Positive review for the Sphinx formatting issues that the patch fixes.



However, while reviewing the patch I noticed some other formatting issues. But these are addressed in ticket #5541.
