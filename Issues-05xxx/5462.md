CLAWPACK (Conservation Laws Package) is a software package designed to compute numerical solutions to hyperbolic partial differential equations using a wave propagation approach.

http://www.amath.washington.edu/~claw/

This ticket will include an spkg containing a C wrapper of Clawpack's Fortran source code as well as a Cython interface for that wrapper. The spkg and C wrapper are part of the Clawpack package. You can obtain the main development branch's source using Subversion:

```
$ svn checkout http://kingkong.amath.washington.edu/svn/claw/trunk/claw
```

Code for creating the wrapper can be found in the `claw/sageclaw` subdirectory.

The primary developer for this project is Chris Swierczewski <cswiercz`@`gmail.com>.

If licensing doesn't  work out then at the very least I'll develop an "unofficial" package.

Until I hear back about the licensing situation what do people suggest I begin doing now that I've written most of the non-Sage-end stuff. I should be starting on a Cython wrapper for a C library but I'm not sure if that's such a good idea until this issue is resolved. My thought is that I could write said Cython code completely external to Sage and have it be "installed" while the `spkg-install` script is running.
 
Sage seems to be a little dry on the numerics side. Clawpack can be a good first step into providing the functionality and beyond of one of the MA*'s, namely Matlab, for the applied mathematics and sciences community.

I ask about adding code in Sage that uses the contents of the Clawpack spkg because I don't want that code to be subject to a license that isn't compatible with Sage.
