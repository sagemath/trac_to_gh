CLAWPACK (Conservation Laws Package) is a software package designed to compute numerical solutions to hyperbolic partial differential equations using a wave propagation approach.

http://www.amath.washington.edu/~claw/

This ticket will include an spkg containing a C wrapper of Clawpack's Fortran source code as well as a Cython interface for that wrapper. The spkg and C wrapper are part of the Clawpack package. You can obtain the main development branch's source using Subversion:

```
$ svn checkout http://kingkong.amath.washington.edu/svn/claw/trunk/claw
```

Code for creating the wrapper can be found in the `claw/sageclaw` subdirectory.

The primary developer for this project is Chris Swierczewski <cswiercz@gmail.com>.

I don't think this should go into standard Sage or even optional since the license basically sucks:

Or to put it more positively, what is the possibility of a license change to GPLv2+, say, so that it may be more seriously considered for inclusion as an optional spkg instead of an experimental spkg?

I contacted the creator / moderator of the Clawpack software and will get back with information soon.

If licensing doesn't  work out then at the very least I'll develop an "unofficial" package. That is, from what I understand, there can exist code in Sage that uses spkg contents even if the spkg hasn't been installed. That code just doesn't work. (Is that the situation for accepted optional spkgs?) I"ll simply not "set up" use of the Clawpack library, included in the spkg, on Sage before any spkg instalation.

Until I hear back about the licensing situation what do people suggest I begin doing now that I've written most of the non-Sage-end stuff. I should be starting on a Cython wrapper for a C library but I'm not sure if that's such a good idea until this issue is resolved. My thought is that I could write said Cython code completely external to Sage and have it be "installed" while the `spkg-install` script is running.
 
Sage seems to be a little dry on the numerics side. Clawpack can be a good first step into providing the functionality and beyond of one of the MA*'s, namely Matlab, for the applied mathematics and sciences community.
