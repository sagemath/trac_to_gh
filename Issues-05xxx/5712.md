More precisely, one could keep the alert, but make it so that it can *not* appear if it already appeared in the last 5 seconds (say).  It is so annoying!

<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

The "2.0" thing to do is to inject a div somewhere, and just keep sending interrupts to the server until it works or the interrupt process gets cancelled.

"Couldn't immediately interrupt.  Trying again in (seconds 'till next retry) [cancel] [restart worksheet]"

[x] <- is a button that says x.

Is this a high priority issue? I am not convinced and since there is no patch and no sign of anyone working on fixing this I am bumping this to 3.4.2.

Yes. Sure, I'll do so.

Good catch.

The point of #7702 is not to interrupt uninterruptible calculations, but to recognize that a calculation cannot be interrupted and display an appropriate alert.

> * When we do show the alert (with #7702's example or a different one), maybe we should add, e.g., "Please try again in a few seconds.  If that doesn't work, please try restarting the worksheet."?

In another ticket, that is.

(I stopped after about 10 attempts.)  Restarting the worksheet does stop the calculation.  But this need not hold up this ticket, as I can interrupt other examples, such as `import time; time.sleep(10)` and `factor(factorial(100000000))`.

Will do so.
