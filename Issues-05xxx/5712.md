More precisely, one could keep the alert, but make it so that it can *not* appear if it already appeared in the last 5 seconds (say).  It is so annoying!

Good catch.

The point of #7702 is not to interrupt uninterruptible calculations, but to recognize that a calculation cannot be interrupted and display an appropriate alert.

Please ignore V4.  V5

* Adds optional callbacks for the [jQuery achtung plug-in's](http://achtung-ui.googlecode.com/) timeout and close events.  See `ui.achtung-mod.js`.  The notebook actually loads `ui.achtung-mod.min.js`, which I made with the [YUI Compressor](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/).

* Uses the new callbacks to send additional interrupt requests and update an alert every 5 seconds, until a request succeeds or the user closes the alert.  If the process *is* interrupted, or the user restarts it, or the computation is done, etc., the alert should close itself.

Please test (and post feedback)!
