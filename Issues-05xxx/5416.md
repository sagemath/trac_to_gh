As I was reviewing sphinxification patches, I noticed a lot of pre-existing issues in the documentation.  Instead of trying to fix these issues as part of sphinxification, I made notes to take care of things later.

This patch covers many of those defects.

REFEREE REPORT



The patch **misc-doc-fixes.patch** applied OK against 3.4.alpha0 and the documentation built OK with the command:

```
sage -docbuild all html
```
I rebuilt the entire set of documentation because the patch touches files spanning the reference manual, the tutorial, the programming guide, and so on. Although the patch fixes a load of formatting issues and typos, I can still see (in the patch itself) that some typos are not fixed. I'm not saying that the patch introduces any new formatting issues or typos; just that it misses some that I can see in the patch itself. For example,  the patch has the following line to fix `sage/rings/polynomial/pbori.pyx`:

Unfortunately some of the fixes interact with other documentation fixes, likely due to some of the issues already being fixed via other patches:
