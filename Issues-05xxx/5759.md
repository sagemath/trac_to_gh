```
The function "divides" does not work for generic commutative rings.

1. it is not checked that the elements are in the same space, i.e.

Zmod(5)(1).divides(Zmod(2)(1)) is "True"

2. No division by zero checking is done! This gives for example an error if you type

    -> Zmod(2).zero_ideal() == Zmod(2).zero_ideal() 

    -> Zmod(2).zero_ideal() == Zmod(2).unit_ideal()

This patch should fix this. It may not be able to handle all cases but classes who need a more clever function should do their own implementation anyways.

Greetings,
Kilian.

<a id='comment:9'></a>The whole divides function is broken (nearly irreparable) with the effect that "divides" failes or gives *wrong* answers if and only if the ring is no polynomial ring or ZZ (which have their own (buggy) implementation). 

The reason is that not all commutative rings are euclidean domains and "modulo" operation does not do what it is supposed to do in general commutative rings, for example in finite integer rings: Zmod(12)(3) % Zmod(12)(4) gives Zmod(3)(0) (which is also broken, by the way). 

The only correct behaviour would be:

1. to raise a NotImplementedError in element.py and let all subclasses implemenent their own divides. 
     or:
2. define divides as "inclusion of ideals" and give errors if the subclasses can't check the inclusion of ideals. 

Also: all doctests in element.py and other files are for polynomial rings only, with the effect that many functions in SAGE fail or give *wrong* answers if the ring is no polynomial ring.  

Greetings,
Kilian.

<a id='comment:11'></a>I would have thought that even in this generality (element of a commutative ring) it would be worth adding the following special cases:

1. if self=1 return True
2. if x =0 return True; else if self =0 return False
3. if self.is_unit() return True

where in each case the test is wrapped in a try/except block so that if (for example) self.is_unit() is not implemented then it just passes.  Finally, if none of the above works then default to code as it is now.

Any individual ring where the x%self computation will not work but where there is an easy alternative direct test (such as in Integers(n)) can have their own specific implementations.
   
If there is any support for this I'm willing to try to do it.

<a id='comment:12'></a>Note that #5347 (merged in 4.1.2.alpha2) fixes the easy cases I listed above.  We still have

```
sage: Zmod(5)(1).divides(Zmod(2)(1))
True
```
but this looks fine to me:

```

sage: Zmod(2).zero_ideal() == Zmod(2).zero_ideal()
True
sage: Zmod(2).zero_ideal() == Zmod(2).unit_ideal()
False
```

Hence the patches here need to be rebased and simplified to cater for the first one.
