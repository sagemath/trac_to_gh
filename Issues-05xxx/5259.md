# Issue 5259: invalid array elements sent to matplotlib quiver, causing blank plot

A student noticed that sometimes, when a function evaluation gave Inf or NaN, the vector field plot was blank.  Discussing this on the matplotlib-users list revealed that we ought to mask our arrays before sending them to the matplotlib quiver function.  This patch corrects this, so that the plot:

```
plot_vector_field( (-x/sqrt(x^2+y^2), -y/sqrt(x^2+y^2)), (x, -10, 10), (y, -10, 10))
```

now plots (before it was a blank plot, now it just skips the problematic vectors).

To test this, you might try the following plots before and after the patch:

```
        sage: var('x,y')
        sage: plot_vector_field( (-x/sqrt(x^2+y^2), -y/sqrt(x^2+y^2)), (x, -10, 10), (y, -10, 10))
