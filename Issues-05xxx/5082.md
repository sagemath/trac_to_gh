The `power_mod` function is redundant, since python already supports this.
 
```
sage: pow?
Type:           builtin_function_or_method
Base Class:     <type 'builtin_function_or_method'>
String Form:    <built-in function pow>
Namespace:      Python builtin
Docstring:
    pow(x, y[, z]) -> number
    
    With two arguments, equivalent to x**y.  With three arguments,
    equivalent to (x**y) % z, but may be more efficient (e.g. for longs).
Class Docstring:
    <attribute '__doc__' of 'builtin_function_or_method' objects>
```

This would call the `__pow__` method of the function in question with the right arguments, so we can handle the modulo powering operation in the right place. Recall that the signature of the `__pow__` method is actually:
 
```
__pow__(self, other[, modulus]).
```
 
 
So the objective of this ticket should be changed to:
* change the `__pow__` methods in `sage.structure.element` to accept a third argument
* deprecate `sage.rings.arith.power_mod`
* deprecate `Integer.powermod`
