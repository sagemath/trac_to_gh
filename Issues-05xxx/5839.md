In `__dealloc__`, if currRing is NULL on entry, then currRing will be the ring we just deleted on exit.  The patch fixes this bug, so that currRing never points to freed memory.

It took me quite a while to come up with a small reproducible test case for the problem; here it is.  (This test case is also in the patch, as a doctest.)

```
import gc
from sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_libsingular import MPolynomialRing_libsingular
R1 = MPolynomialRing_libsingular(GF(5), 2, ('x', 'y'), TermOrder('degrevlex', 2))
R2 = MPolynomialRing_libsingular(GF(11), 2, ('x', 'y'), TermOrder('degrevlex', 2))
R3 = MPolynomialRing_libsingular(GF(13), 2, ('x', 'y'), TermOrder('degrevlex', 2))
gc.collect()
foo = R1.gen(0)
del foo
del R1
gc.collect()
del R2
gc.collect()
del R3
gc.collect()
```
