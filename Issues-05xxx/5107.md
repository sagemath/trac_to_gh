The computation is done in the function `continued_fraction_list()` of `rings/arith.py`, where it says "This may be slow for real number input, since it's implemented in pure Python. For rational number input the PARI C library is used."

I wonder why we're not using PARI also when the input is a real number.  It's fast, and it looks right:

```
sage: x = sqrt(2)
sage: CFF = ContinuedFractionField()
sage: CFF(pari(x).contfrac().python())
[1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
sage: timeit("CFF(pari(x).contfrac().python())
625 loops, best of 3: 258 Âµs per loop
sage: timeit("CFF(continued_fraction_list(x))")
625 loops, best of 3: 1.17 ms per loop
```

Hi,

I've looked through this carefully.

1. I strongly disagree that any of the examples above are bugs.  They are the result of users misunderstanding what the `continued_fraction` function is supposed to do.  This may be partly because that function has 0 documentation!   

2. Regarding speed: correctness is much more important for starters, and it's also good to have a precise definition of exactly what is being computed.  That is impossible to do in PARI, mainly because of how PARI's precision can't be set exactly in bits.   This is difficult to appreciate without the function continued_fraction being documented.  The right way to make this function faster is to just reimplement continued_fraction_list in Cython. 

So, I've attached a patch that:

1. Brings the coverage of contfrac.py to 100%.

2. Explains in detail what continued_fraction is actually supposed to compute.  

3. Changes the docs in the whole contfrac.py file to use ReST formatting. 


It doesn't change what anything actually does in any significant way.
