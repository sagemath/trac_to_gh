As I reported at http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/b82584e0ee6ba733, it seems that the `SmallGroups` library can not be used in `sage 3.3`.

More precisely: I installed `database_gap-4.4.10`
and `gap_packages-4.4.10_6` -- apparently with success. But when I tried to use it, say, with `gap('NumberSmallGroups(128)')`, an error is raised, complaining about the `SmallGroups` library being missing.

This occurs in the following settings:
- sage-3.3 built from source on x86_64 GNU/Linux, Dual Core AMD Opteron(tm) Processor 270, gcc (GCC) 4.1.2 20061115 (prerelease) (SUSE Linux)
- sage-3.3 obtained by an upgrade of sage-3.1.2 (built from source) on the same machine
- sage-3.3 obtained by an upgrade of sage-3.2.3 (built from source) on x86_64 GNU/Linux, AMD Athlon(tm) 64 Processor 3700+, gcc (GCC) 4.2.1 

It does not occur in a sage-3.3.rc0 install on `sage.math`. Perhaps this helps to locate the source of trouble.

Keywords: **SmallGroups library gap package**

I'm giving a positive review, in the sense that I don't see a problem with the small groups library since many months.

I suggest to resolve it as duplicate, even though I couldn't point my finger to a ticket in which the problem had been solved.
