All doctests in Sage should pass when they are run as a user that does not have write access to the Sage install. To do that, run the doctests on a Sage install that isn't owned by the user:

```
$ ./sage -tp 4 --long devel/sage/doc/common devel/sage/doc/en devel/sage/sage
```

On sage-5.4.beta1, this causes:

```
The following tests failed:

        sage -t --long devel/sage/sage/interfaces/qepcad.py # 3 doctests failed
        sage -t --long devel/sage/sage/misc/inline_fortran.py # 3 doctests failed
        sage -t --long devel/sage/sage/tests/cmdline.py # 2 doctests failed
```

Before applying the patch, I get two doctest failures (with a non-writeable Sage install).  Applying the patch "trac_5155.patch" fixes both.  So positive review for that.

The scripts patch wasn't necessary to get those tests to pass, and it also doesn't apply cleanly to 4.3.1:

```
applying /Users/palmieri/Downloads/scripts_5155.patch
patching file sage-doctest
Hunk #1 FAILED at 55
1 out of 1 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file sage-doctest.rej
unable to find 'sage-dsage-trial' for patching
1 out of 1 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file sage-dsage-trial.rej
patching file sage-maketest
Hunk #1 succeeded at 1 with fuzz 1 (offset -1 lines).
patching file sage-test
Hunk #1 FAILED at 40
1 out of 1 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file sage-test.rej
sage-dsage-trial: No such file or directory
abort: patch failed to apply
```
The changes there look fine in principle, though.  So once it's rebased, positive review there, too.

Sympow will be harder to deal with, because of how the spkg is written: it tries to write files to SAGE_LOCAL/lib/sympow.  See [https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/9703#comment:9](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/9703#comment:9) for a possible fix.

I'm attaching a patch to try to deal with the situation when you run Sage for the very first time as a user without write permissions.

Finally, there may be other issues if you compile Sage but don't run it, and then run doctests as a user without write permissions (the first time doctests get run, they might write some files which don't need to be written later).  These issues should be fixed, too.

A few quick comments:

- you have a typo in line 93, "eyactly"
- on line 583, `# optional - qepcad, note "algeraic" [sic]`, this is not the way to format an optional doctest: it will only run if you do "sage -t -optional-only=qepcad,not,algeraic,sic" or something like that.

No idea how that happened...

Very true, thanks!

> For the scripts patch:

Because `SAGE_ROOT` is already canonicalized by `realpath` at the top of that file:

```
SAGE_ROOT     = os.path.realpath(os.environ['SAGE_ROOT'])
```
