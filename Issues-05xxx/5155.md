```
All doctests in Sage should pass when they are run as a user that does not have write access to the Sage install. To do that, run the doctests on a Sage install that isn't owned by the user:

```
$ ./sage -tp 4 --long devel/sage/doc/common devel/sage/doc/en devel/sage/sage
```

On sage-5.4.beta1, this causes:

```
The following tests failed:

        sage -t --long devel/sage/sage/interfaces/qepcad.py # 3 doctests failed
        sage -t --long devel/sage/sage/misc/inline_fortran.py # 3 doctests failed
        sage -t --long devel/sage/sage/tests/cmdline.py # 2 doctests failed
```

**Apply**:
1. [attachment:5155_sage_location.patch] to the scripts repository.
2. [attachment:5155_root.patch] to the `SAGE_ROOT` repository.
3. [attachment:5155_sagelib.patch] to the Sage library.

<a id='comment:2'></a>Before applying the patch, I get two doctest failures (with a non-writeable Sage install).  Applying the patch "trac_5155.patch" fixes both.  So positive review for that.

The scripts patch wasn't necessary to get those tests to pass, and it also doesn't apply cleanly to 4.3.1:

```
applying /Users/palmieri/Downloads/scripts_5155.patch

Hunk #1 FAILED at 55
1 out of 1 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file sage-doctest.rej
unable to find 'sage-dsage-trial' for patching

patching file sage-maketest
Hunk #1 succeeded at 1 with fuzz 1 (offset -1 lines).
patching file sage-test
Hunk #1 FAILED at 40
1 out of 1 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file sage-test.rej
sage-dsage-trial: No such file or directory
abort: patch failed to apply
```
The changes there look fine in principle, though.  So once it's rebased, positive review there, too.

Sympow will be harder to deal with, because of how the spkg is written: it tries to write files to SAGE_LOCAL/lib/sympow.  See [http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/9703#comment:9](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/9703#comment:9) for a possible fix.

I'm attaching a patch to try to deal with the situation when you run Sage for the very first time as a user without write permissions.

Finally, there may be other issues if you compile Sage but don't run it, and then run doctests as a user without write permissions (the first time doctests get run, they might write some files which don't need to be written later).  These issues should be fixed, too.

No idea how that happened...

Very true, thanks!

Because `SAGE_ROOT` is already canonicalized by `realpath` at the top of that file:

```
SAGE_ROOT     = os.path.realpath(os.environ['SAGE_ROOT'])
```
