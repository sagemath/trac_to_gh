So this is incredibly awful:

```
sage: gamma(RealField(100)(3/4))
1.2254167024651776451290983034
sage: gamma(3/4).n(100)
1.2254167024651776429777783051
```

(for the record, the first one is correct)

and this doesn't agree with that:

```
sage: log(2).n(100)
0.69314718055994530941723212146
sage: log(RealField(2))
