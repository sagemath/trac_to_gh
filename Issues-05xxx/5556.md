So this is incredibly awful:

```
sage: gamma(RealField(100)(3/4))
1.2254167024651776451290983034
sage: gamma(3/4).n(100)
1.2254167024651776429777783051
```

(for the record, the first one is correct)

and this doesn't agree with that:

```
sage: log(2).n(100)
0.69314718055994530941723212146
sage: log(RealField(2))

I just realized I goofed, I meant:

```
sage: log(2).n(100)
0.69314718055994530941723212146
sage: log(RealField(100)(2))
0.69314718055994530941723212146
```

which works as expected.  But the symbolic gamma function is still wrong, and egregiously wrong at that!

```
sage: sin(SR(3/4))
sin(3/4)
sage: sin(3/4)
sin(3/4)
sage: gamma(SR(3/4))
gamma(3/4)
sage: gamma(3/4)

sage: zeta(SR(3/4))
zeta(3/4)
sage: zeta(3/4)

So the problem lies in gamma itself (and friends).  Most likely fix at this point is adding a prec keyword, as in sqrt.
