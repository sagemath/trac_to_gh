```
The following returns an incorrect answer:

```
sage: S.<z> = QQ[[]]
sage: p = 1 + O(z)
sage: q = 1 + z
sage: p(q)          # should return O(z^0)
1
```

This was reported via "report a problem" from the notebook.

As pointed out by Ralf Hemmecke on sage-devel, the correct behaviour is not to return 1, but rather to raise an error if q has a constant term.

I just came across this, which is presumably related:

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[[]]
sage: f = 1 + 24*x^11 + 24*x^22 + O(x^33)
sage: f(x^2)
1 + 24*x^22 + 24*x^44 + O(x^86)
```

The answer should clearly be 1 + 24*x^22 + 24*x^44 + O(x^66). (This is causing some headaches in trying to sort out degeneracy maps for modular forms.)
