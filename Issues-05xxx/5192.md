Integers which result from symbolic expressions live in the symbolic ring, so they are not factored by factor().  E.g.

```
sage: f(n)=n^2+n+41
sage: a=f(40)
sage: factor(a),is_prime(a),a
(1681, False, 1681)
sage: factor(1681)
41^2
```
But this is not obvious from the documentation of factor(), which only refers to e.g. a.factor? as the source of this.  Some example like this should be added to the documentation of the global factor().
