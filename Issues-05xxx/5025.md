This was posted to the mailing list about #4705:

```
I have been using TinyMCE for about three weeks now. My ultimate goal
would be to to do something along the lines that David Joyner mentions
in a previous message (have students create worksheets that have
comments/interpretation between the cells).

TinyMCE works very well as far as editing goes, and I didn't test all
buttons available in the tool bar. I think it would be a nice edition
to Sage. It does not seem to affect how responsively the code is
executed, but what I am doing is not very demanding.

However, I noticed the following: (I'm using it in Firefox 3.0.5 in
Ubuntu 10.2. The Sage version is 3.2.2.)

(1)
If I click the menu Action-Evaluate All, exceptions are thrown in
certain situations. The following is the sequence that will trigger
it:
     - Execute the code in some cells
     - Create text using TinyMCE and save it.
     - Do Action-Evaluate All
The problem does not appear to happen with worksheets that had been
saved in a previous Sage session, and then are opened in a new
session. Quitting the worksheet and reopening it also seems to fix the
problem, as long as there were no previous exceptions thrown. I'm not
including a worksheet reproducing the problem because it seems to be
"dynamic", it only occurs as one is working on the worksheet. I am
attaching a text file with the output of the sage session.

(2)
If one creates a link in TinyMCE (highlight text, use the link
button), save the changes in the TinyMCE editor and then follow the
link, when returning to the page with the worksheet (using the
browser's back button), the text that has just been typed disappears.
It reappears if the reload button in the browser is used. (So, it
seems to be a problem of refreshing the cached page). The same happens
if the HTML is directly edited to create the link. In my opinion, the
default behavior on clicking a link in a worksheet should be to open
it in another tab/window in the browser. The idea is that the links
might have reference to documentation, math references, etc, and users
will want to continue to do their math in Sage.

(3)
This is more in the "weirdness" department. I noticed that, sometimes,
each time I reopen a worksheet, a new empty cell is created at the
bottom. I was not able to reproduce it consistently.

Okay, the (soon-to-be) attached patch fixes (1) and also fixes the bug mhampton pointed out a while ago that there are multiple cells with the same id.

(2) This is how standard linking works in web browsers in general, and is just implemented in TinyMCE to be consistent with most other links on the internet.  I think I'd classify (2) as a wontfix, since there are standard mechanisms for opening a link in another tab that are widely known and understood.

(3) This does seem weird, but we'd need some steps to reproduce the problem.

Hence, I'd say that this ticket is really concerned with the bug in (1), which is addressed in the patch.

I can reproduce this on 3.3alpha2 by:

creating a new worksheet

entering 1+1 and evaluating the first cell

create a text cell below all other cells.  Save changes to text cell

create a calculation cell below all other cells.  Enter 1+1 and evaluate

Select "Evaluate All" from the menu.

Replying to [jason](#comment%3A18):
> kcrisman: also, are you using sage 3.3 alpha 2?  This patch depends on the alpha2 (that alpha contains, for example, the other tinymce patches)

That could be the problem.  I just don't know why Edit would work without this patch, then not work with the patch, as well as why this patch would even apply correctly!  Don't worry, I'll let you know if it happens in 3.3 proper - my sense is not, based on mhansen's review.
