This (series of) patch(es) extends the Sage category framework as a
design pattern for organizing generic code.

Latest version of the patches:

- [categories-framework-nt.patch](http://combinat.sagemath.org/patches/file/tip/categories-framework-nt.patch)          (reviewer: David Roe; review essentially complete up to some doctests)
- [categories-categories-nt.patch](http://combinat.sagemath.org/patches/file/tip/categories-categories-nt.patch)         (reviewer: Florent Hivert, Javier, David Kohel, Anne Schilling, ...) See [CategoriesCategoriesReview](CategoriesCategoriesReview)
- [categories-fixsagelib-nt.patch](http://combinat.sagemath.org/patches/file/tip/categories-fixsagelib-nt.patch)         (positive review: Robert Bradshaw)
   updates to the sage library (import fixes, ...)
- [categories-fix-combinat-nt.patch](http://combinat.sagemath.org/patches/file/tip/categories-fix-combinat-nt.patch)       (positive review: Florent)
- [categories-numberfield_homset-nt.patch](http://combinat.sagemath.org/patches/file/tip/categories-numberfield_homset-nt.patch) (reviewer: William)

Status and roadmap: http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/wiki/CategoriesRoadMap

Some of the things done in this ticket:

- Categories:
  - Infrastructure:
    - sage.categories.category (500 lines of code)
    - sage.structure.parent (100 lines of code)
    - class manipulation: (25 lines of code)
  - All the mathematical categories of Axiom and MuPAD (Courtesy of Teresa Gomez Diaz)
    (except *WithSeveralBases which are not needed anymore; see .abstract_category())
    See the category graph: attachment:sage-category-graph.pdf
  - (Infinite/Finite)EnumeratedSets (with example) (Courtesy of Florent Hivert)
  - Semigroups                      (with example, basic methods, subquotients)
  - FiniteSemigroups                (with example, cayley graphs, basic representation theory, ...)
  - ModulesWithBasis                (with example, morphisms)
  - HopfAlgebras & friends          (with a couple examples)
  - Cleanup:
    - Have unique representation by default (no need to inherit from Category_uniq)
    - Have construction / reduce by default
    - Can systematically use the idiom P in Rings()
  - Lattice structure (join, meet); meet needs cleanup; join and meet
    should be swapped.

- Reorganization of the Sage library to start using the category framework:
  - Groups:
    - AbelianGroup_class.__init__ was missing a call to Groups.__init__
    - Support for Group.__init__(category = ...)
    - AbelianGroups was renamed to CommutativeAdditiveGroups (idem for Semigroups, ...)
      (note: AbelianGroup are about commutative multiplicative groups)
  - NumberFields: bug fix (categories-numberfield_homset-nt.patch):
    Hom(SomeNumberField,SomeVectorSpace) returned a numberfield homset
  - Fixed some import loops
  - Square MatrixSpace in Algebras(...)
  - Added temporary list() methods to:
    - FreeModule_generic
    - MatrixSpace_generic
    - Set_object_enumerated
    - ParentWithAdditiveAbelianGens
    - ParentWithMultiplicativeAbelianGens
    They should eventually be inherited from the EnumeratedSets() category
  - Added sage.sets.finite_enumerated_set
  - Naming conventions and cleanup:
    - parent.product(x,y)   parent.product    parent.product_on_basis
      (was: multiply, _multiply, multiply_basis, _multiply_basis)
    - parent.summation(x,y) parent.summation        # risk of confusion with infinite summation / ...

    - parent.sum ([x,y,z,y])
    - parent.prod([x,y,z,y])

    - parent.coproduct, parent.coproduct_on_basis, parent.coproduct_on_generators
    - parent.antipode, parent.antipode_on_basis, parent.antipode_on_generators
    - cat.example()  cat.counter_example()
    - A.one() A.zero() a.is_one() a.is_zero()   A(1) A(0) when it makes sense
      A.one_element() A.zero_element() deprecated in the doc; fully deprecated later
      Transitional aliases one = one_element, zero = zero_element
    - Use class.an_instance() whenever meaningful
    - parent.an_element() parent.some_elements(); possibly parent.example() parent.counterexample()
    - all_weakly_super_categories -> all_super_categories(proper=False)

On the sage-combinat patch server. It changes too often to keep it updated on trac.

<a id='comment:17'></a>NOTES:

  (1) Post the latest version here -- I don't want to mess with the patch server.

  (2) It says "Experts: please redefine this properly and/or put CC/RR/... in NumberFields()".  I number field is by definition a finite extension of QQ, but CC and RR are infinite extensions of QQ.  So we can't put them in that category.   Having a function is_NumberFieldHomsetCodomain does seem like a good workaround for now.

  (3) The function is_NumberFieldHomsetCodomain in the patch posted here doesn't have any documentation or doctests. Please add them. 

  (4) I would change these two lines:

```
        143	        if is_Field(codomain): 
 	144	            return True 
```
to the single line 

```
        143	        return is_Field(codomain)
```
which should be functionally the same, and clearer to read. 

   (5) in a similar spirit, I would change

```
        145	    except: 
 	146	        pass     
 	147	    return False 
```
to just

```
        145	    except: 
 	146	        return False
```
which is again clearer and equivalent. 

    (6) I'm puzzled by this in your number_field_rel.py patch:

```
	543	            return NotImplemented 
```

What is NotImplemented? It's not defined in the number_field_rel.py file in sage-4.2.

>   (2) It says "Experts: please redefine this properly and/or put CC/RR/... in NumberFields()".  I number field is by definition a finite extension of QQ, but CC and RR are infinite extensions of QQ.  So we can't put them in that category.   Having a function is_NumberFieldHomsetCodomain does seem like a good workaround for now.


Ok.

Oops. Will do.

Yes better. Will do.

It's a builtin python object. Anyway, the function now raises a TypeError, per the latest _Hom_ protocol.
