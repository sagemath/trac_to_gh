This change is a bit arbitrary:

```diff
`@``@` -3109,6 +3110,11 `@``@` cdef class Integer(sage.structure.element.EuclideanDomainElement):
         cdef Integer z
         cdef long yy, res
 
+        if isinstance(y, long):
+            # This should be treated basically the same as if y is an Integer
+            # so go ahead and convert y to an Integer first
+            y = Integer(y)
+
         # First case: Integer % Integer
         if type(x) is type(y):
             if not mpz_sgn((<Integer>y).value):
```


First of all, I think it makes sense to do this both for `x` and for `y`. Second, could you optimize the `Integer()` call a bit by using `PY_NEW` and `mpz_set_pylong` instead?

Erik, could you handle Jeroen's queries ?

I could be missing some subtlety here but why would you do "this" for `x`?  This is in `Integer.__mod__` so `x` would never be a `long`.

I incorporated Jeroen's other suggestion and squashed.  Awaiting clarification on the first comment.

This is a difference between the Python language and the C API.

Python has `__mod__` and `__rmod__`, the C API has `tp_as_number->nb_remainder` where it's not guaranteed that the first argument is of the expected type.

Cython interfaces the C API but with a syntax similar to Python. Most of time, this is useful, but it does cause some confusion. This is probably also the reason why the arguments are called `(x, y)` instead of `(self, other)`.

Ah, I wondered if something like that might be the case but I wasn't sure.  Okay, I'll clean this up a bit more.

I'll split off the `__mod__` changes.

Don't squash! The first commit came from the dependency #24221. Let me try to fix this mess...

I'll redo `Integer.__mod__` on #24293.
