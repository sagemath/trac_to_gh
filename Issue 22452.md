there are quite a few places using
`#!/bin/bash` instead of 
`#!/usr/bin/env bash`.

Not every system will have the former available.

I suppose stuff in `src/sage*/mac-app/` may be left intact, as it's OSX-specific.

There is none of these in `config/`. Have I missed any place where these `/bin/bash` can be, still? (Patching every spkg with this might be a bit too much though).

Not as bad as I thought. Note that `build/make/Makefile` is generated so that instance reflect your setup at configuration time.

Looks good to me. Misbehaving packages should be dealt with on an individual basis, in my opinion.
