We should have


```
        sage: def a(n): yield 1*n; yield 2*n

        sage: CartesianProduct(a(3), b()).list()                                
        [[3, 'a'], [3, 'b']]                                                    
        sage: from sage.combinat.misc import IterableFunctionCall               
        sage: CartesianProduct(IterableFunctionCall(a, 3), IterableFunctionCall\
(b)).list()
