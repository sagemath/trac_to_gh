We should have


```
        sage: def a(n): yield 1*n; yield 2*n                                    
        sage: def b(): yield 'a'; yield 'b'                                     
        sage: CartesianProduct(a(3), b()).list()                                
        [[3, 'a'], [3, 'b']]                                                    
        sage: from sage.combinat.misc import IterableFunctionCall               
        sage: CartesianProduct(IterableFunctionCall(a, 3), IterableFunctionCall\
(b)).list()                                                                     
        [[3, 'a'], [3, 'b'], [6, 'a'], [6, 'b']]                                
                                                                                
    See the documentation for IterableFunctionCall for more information.      
    """
```


Note that the word "See" should align with the triple double quotation marks `"""`.
