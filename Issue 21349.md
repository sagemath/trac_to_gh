Seems good and pass tests. Mark as positive review if this was meant to be reviewed.

ok, but I would prefer to have a bot report before setting to positive.

Compiles and passes tests. I'll wait to see patchbot.

If I read the logs correctly, then this is OK. Some patchbot got a problem that can't relate to this patch. So feel free to mark as positive review.
