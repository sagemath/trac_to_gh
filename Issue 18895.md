# Issue 18895: Fix interrupts in Jupyter

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19132

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2015-09-04 12:40:30

Jupyter messes with Sage's interrupt (`SIGINT`) handler, such that code like

```
factor(2^1000 + 1)
```

cannot be interrupted for example.

LGTM; we don't need the extra process from the shell running around.
