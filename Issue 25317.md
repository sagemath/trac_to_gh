# Issue 25317: Support new-style Parents in RingMap_lift

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2018-06-11 11:34:47

The code for `RingMap_lift` uses some internal functions of the old coercion model (`Parent_old`). There is an example involving matrix spaces which breaks with #25319 because `MatrixSpace` becomes a new-style parent.

Instead, we should implement `RingMap_lift` using proper coercion maps, which are supported by the old and new coercion model.

#23719 passes the testsuite, so I'll assume that this one also does.
