I would expect something like:

Another bug.  If you use Sage for a level outside the Cremona range and you're using a system-wide Sage install, this is the error you get, which is pretty scary looking:

That is really stupid.  I'm sure it never used to do that --but why is there not a dictest for this construction on a failing string?  I wonder if this came in with the new database implmentation.

For the other bug, that looks like it might not be specific to the cremona database.

I have rebased the patch so that it now works after the rebased #12341.

This was not quite trivial as a little extra coding was needed so that "Old Cremona labels" could be parsed properly using the regexp method.

I tested sage/databses/cremona.py and all in sage/schemes/elliptic_curves.
