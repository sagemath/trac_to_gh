Keywords: symbolic ring, conversion

If I want to do simple check whether or not element of SR in NumberField like this:


```
sage: FF = NumberField(x^2+1, 'z')                                                                                                                             
sage: x^2 in FF   
```


I get the error:


```
/usr/lib/python3.8/site-packages/sage/symbolic/expression_conversions.py in symbol(self, ex)
    318             NotImplementedError: symbol
    319         """
--> 320         raise NotImplementedError("symbol")
    321 
    322     def relation(self, ex, operator):

NotImplementedError: symbol
```


It doesn't seem like behavior expected by user.

Sage development has entered the release candidate phase for 9.3. Setting a new milestone for this ticket based on a cursory review.
