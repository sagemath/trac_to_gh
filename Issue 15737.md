Keywords: hyperbolic root systems

They are a important class of indeterminate Cartan types. They will be given in terms of the table given in _Classification of hyperbolic Dynkin diagrams, root lengths, and Weyl group orbits_ by Carbone, Chung, Cobbs, McRae, Nandi, Naqvi, and Penta, as well as in some of the other notations specified in the aforementioned paper.

Changing keywords from "hyperbolic root systems" to "hyperbolic root systems, coxeter".

Current WIP version (I'm not guaranteeing anything to really work, nor for the structure to not change).

Hi Travis!

Just a quick suggestion for less duplication in the code and a better
isolation of the "database" part. Make:

```
if index == 1:
    dd = CartanType_Rank3Cycle._construct_dynkin_diagram((1,1,2))
elif index == 2:
    dd = CartanType_Rank3Cycle._construct_dynkin_diagram((1,1,-22))
elif index == 3:
   dd = CartanType_Rank3Cycle._construct_dynkin_diagram((1,1,3))
...
```


Into, at the start of the file and with a more specific name than data
if possible:

```
    data = (None, (1,1,2), (1,1,-22), (1,1,3), ...)
```


And in the constructor:

```
    dd = CartanType_Rank3Cycle._construct_dynkin_diagram(data[i])
```


Cheers,
                         Nicolas
