Keywords: hyperbolic root systems

They are a important class of indeterminate Cartan types. They will be given in terms of the table given in *Classification of hyperbolic Dynkin diagrams, root lengths, and Weyl group orbits* by Carbone, Chung, Cobbs, McRae, Nandi, Naqvi, and Penta, as well as in some of the other notations specified in the aforementioned paper.

Hi Travis!

Just a quick suggestion for less duplication in the code and a better
isolation of the "database" part. Make:

```
if index == 1:
    dd = CartanType_Rank3Cycle._construct_dynkin_diagram((1,1,2))
elif index == 2:
    dd = CartanType_Rank3Cycle._construct_dynkin_diagram((1,1,-22))
elif index == 3:
   dd = CartanType_Rank3Cycle._construct_dynkin_diagram((1,1,3))
...
```


Into, at the start of the file and with a more specific name than data
if possible:

```
    data = (None, (1,1,2), (1,1,-22), (1,1,3), ...)
```


And in the constructor:

```
    dd = CartanType_Rank3Cycle._construct_dynkin_diagram(data[i])
```


Cheers,
                         Nicolas
