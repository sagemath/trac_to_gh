This patch is ok for me. Nathann, if you are happy with the cosmetic changes in the review patch, you can set a positive review when the bot gives a green light.

Yeahhhhhhhhhhh !! Thank you very much Frederic `:-)`

My patch got a green light by itself, and your changes (thanks for them too!) are not likely to produce bugs outside of `generic_graph.py`. I just applied both on beta4 without any problems and all tests pass on that file, so I set it to `positive_review` before I forget.
