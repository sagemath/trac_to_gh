CC:  ncohen chapoton

Keywords: poset

Documentation says first "Return the characteristic polynomial of a **graded** poset - -", then later "If P is a **graded poset with - -  a unique minimal element**"  and the function can throw "the poset should be **ranked**". Somebody understanding what is characteristic polynomial should check this.

Also the list of poset functions at the beginning of the file does not contain this function.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17485

I can see no problem with the doc.

The method is defined for graded posets with exactly one minimal element, as explained.

Such a poset will be ranked. If it is not, the method raises an error.

The only "problem" I can see is that it will return something (not interesting) for posets with are ranked but not graded with one minimal element. I do not care, but it would be possible to add more checks to prevent this to happen.

Then either it should say "If `P` is a **ranked** poset with rank `n` and - -" OR raise "the poset should be **graded**", whichever you seem to be correct.

Should this kind of function be defined with one-line description "Return the characteristic polynomial of the poset" and longer explanation starting with "The poset is assumed to be - - and - -. If it is not, an exception is raised."?
