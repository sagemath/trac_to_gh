Issue created by migration from Trac.

We should create a new class `SagePariInstance` inheriting from `PariInstance` and move all Sage-specific stuff there (for example, the `sage()` method).

We hav `gen_to_integer` versus `gentoobj`. What convention should we use? I am in favor of Sage's one: `gen_to_sage`. What do you think?

`gen_py.py` has been deprecated 12 months ago. We might as well drop it.

as for `gentosage` vs `gen_to_sage`, it's all the same to me.

I changed it to `gen_to_sage` in my last commit.

This might break the pickle jar. Be sure to run doctests...

Indeed. I propose to get rid of `gen_py.py` in another ticket.

Don't deprecate `sage.libs.cypari2.gentoobj`, just remove it. We don't want Sage deprecations in `cypari2`.
