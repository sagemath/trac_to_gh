# Issue 26927: link sphinx docs of Sage components in reference manual

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27164

As Sage gets increasingly modular, it becomes important (also for the doc website, currently it has broken links to e.g. sagenb interacts in the reference manual) that these spun off docs are still easy to find.

In fact, sphinx has an extension to link different projects, 
see http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/intersphinx.html

so this appears quite doable. 
Here is an incomplete docs to link

* sagetex
* sagenb  (see #25382)
* cypari
* cysignals
* pyppl (not yet in Sage, see #23024)

Question: how does this intersphinx will interplay with distribution installation (e.g. Gentoo, Archlinux, Debian, etc)?

This is a question for packagers. I have no idea what they do with Sage's docs. I cc'd the packagers I can think of.

I don't know much about intersphinx. Doesn't it simply link to online resources? Or does it also link offline docs together?

It can do both. When you declare a mapping let's say for numpy:

```
intersphinx_mapping = {'numpy': (URI, None)}
```


`URI` can be an online link or your numpy's documentation local directory.

Well then as long as sage does The Right Thing with the URI, it shouldn't be an issue with packaging.

Moving all blocker/critical issues from 8.7 to 8.8.

Moving open critical and blocker issues to the next release milestone (optimistically).

Sage development has entered the release candidate phase for 9.3. Setting a new milestone for this ticket based on a cursory review of ticket status, priority, and last modification date.

Changing priority from critical to major.
