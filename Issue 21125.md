At least with non-exact moduli:

```
sage: Pol.<z> = RIF[]
sage: Pol.quo(z - 1/3)                                                          
Univariate Quotient Polynomial Ring in zbar over Real Interval Field with 53 bits of precision with modulus [-infinity .. +infinity]                            
```
