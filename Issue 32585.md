in `src/sage/dynamics/arithmetic_dynamics/endPN_automorphism_group.py`, you could also add the missing space after `#`

```diff
-                    #range over all orders
+                    # range over all orders
```


same in `src/sage/dynamics/arithmetic_dynamics/projective_ds.py` where we see in the diff

```diff
             #computes the error bound as defined in Algorithm 3.1 of [WELLS]
             if Res > 1:
-                if not err is None:
+                if err is not None:
```

and

```diff
                         #for each periodic point get the entire cycle
-                        if not Q in periodic_points:
+                        if Q not in periodic_points:
```



in `src/sage/dynamics/arithmetic_dynamics/wehlerK3.py`, you slightly changed the test. Is it what is expected here ?

```diff
-        if not (i in [0,1,2]) and not (j in [0,1,2]):
+        if i not in [0, 1, 2] or j not in [0, 1, 2]:
             raise ValueError("the two indexes must be either 0, 1, or 2")

Voila pour quelques espaces.

Concernant le test modifié, il est devenu plus cohérent avec le message d'erreur, donc ça me semble correct.
