CC:  @tobiasdiez nthiery tscrim chapoton yzh

`sage.numerical.backends` provides an opportunity to study use of `pytest` as a replacement for `TestSuite` (proposed in #30738) in a small self-contained codebase.

`GenericBackend` defines an API and a small number of `_test_` methods to check that the API is implemented correctly by the backend implementations. 

Apart from converting from `TestSuite` to pytest, this would be a good opportunity to expand the tests to replace what is currently tested using copy-pasted doctests.

Important design constraint:
- The testing framework must be extensible by user-defined classes (or classes from separately installed Python packages - such as the existing `sage_numerical_backends_coin`).

What should happen with the generic tests methods like `_test_new, _test_not_implemented_methods, _test_category, _test_pickling` that sadly make the "small self-contained" part hard?

Great point. This brings me to the question whether it would be possible to either
- invoke the existing `TestSuite` as one pytest method or
- dynamically generate adapter methods that invoke the existing `_test` methods.

That's a great idea, making it possible to step-by-step migrate more test methods without the need to do everything at once! I've used it now.

> - dynamically generate adapter methods that invoke the existing `_test` methods.

That might also work, but is more work since the `_test` methods are instance methods, and for pytest the adapter method would need to be provided with the instance (which in the current design is passed to the `TestSuite`). It's probably easier to simply rewrite the test method in pytest.

By default, pytest expects the compiled cython files to be in the same folder (inplace install). To support sage's build system, one needs to modify `sys.path` in the conftest file as shown here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20971619/ensuring-py-test-includes-the-application-directory-in-sys-path
What is the correct SAGE_XYZ folder to specify there? SAGE_LOCAL?

Moreover, it could be a problem that the test files are present twice (in local and src), which I think leads to the other errors above. Maybe https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/pythonpath.html helps.

I will have a look at these things, but it will take some time as I have to destroy my nicely working inplace install for this. Feel free to play around with the above linked code.
