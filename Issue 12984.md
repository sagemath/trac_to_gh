```
sage: E=ModularForms(3,12).cuspidal_subspace()
sage: f=E.gens()[0]
sage: g=f-f
sage: g.is_old()
False

This is definitely a case where sage returns a wrong answer.

I traced this back to a problem with the `__call__` method's membership testing code for modular forms subspaces. The problem is that it expects imprecise q-expansions, and fails badly when given the zero q-expansion as argument.
