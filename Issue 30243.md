# Issue 30243: Follow-up to #30355: Don't modify $SAGE_LOCAL contents from spkg-install scripts

By design, spkg-install scripts should not directly touch the contents of `$SAGE_LOCAL`.  If some pre-/post-installation steps need to be taken to modify `$SAGE_LOCAL`, it should go in an `spkg-preinst` script.

I understand #30355 is a workaround, but the same workaround can still be implemented without violating this constraint.

Wrong ticket number?

I even double-checked it, and yet...
(caveat, I'm working while sick right now)

Thanks, moving it to `spkg-preinst` is a good idea

Setting new milestone based on a cursory review of ticket status, priority, and last modification date.
