By design, spkg-install scripts should not directly touch the contents of `$SAGE_LOCAL`.  If some pre-/post-installation steps need to be taken to modify `$SAGE_LOCAL`, it should go in an `spkg-preinst` script.

I understand #30355 is a workaround, but the same workaround can still be implemented without violating this constraint.
