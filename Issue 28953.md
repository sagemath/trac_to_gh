# Issue 28953: Polar for combinatorial polyhedron

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29190

Original creator: @kliem

Keywords: polar, dual, combinatorial polyhedron

We implement a method of `CombinatorialPolyhedron` that obtains the polar/dual. We name it `polar` to be consistent with `Polyhedron_base`.

This is obtained by simply copying and interchanging the bitrepresentation of facets and vertices. The object is purely combinatorial and does not have vertex or facet names. A `ValueError` is raised for the unbounded case.

Along the way we implement a `__copy__` method for `ListOfFaces` and allow initializing `CombinatorialPolyhedron` from a tuple consisting of two `ListOfFaces`.

* Maybe add #28608 as a dependency here and change the code accordingly.
* In the documentation of `CombinatorialPolyhedron`. add to `far_face` the option when `data` is a tuple  consisting of facets and vertices (of class ListOfFaces).
* A typo:

```diff
-       * or a tuple consting of facets and vertices as two
+       * or a tuple consisting of facets and vertices as two
```

I'm just going to wait until #28608 is merged, otherwise it's a pain to review.

* I would suggest renaming the method name to `dual` (since this is purely combinatorial) and put `polar` as an alias to `dual` to be consistent with `Polyhedron_base`.

* Add 

```
        .. SEEALSO::

            :meth:`~sage.geometry.polyhedron.base.Polyhedron_base.polar`.
```


Otherwise, the ticket is good to go.
