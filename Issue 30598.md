Setting new milestone based on a cursory review of ticket status, priority, and last modification date.

Is there a need to distinguish several versions of clang / LLVM on the same system for portability testing purposes?

that's probably too much trouble. There is  a distinction w.r.t. which standard C++ library clang uses, GNU's (libstdc++) or LLVM's (libc++), which is more important.

Here's some preliminary distro package information - just guesswork based on reading https://repology.org/project/llvm/versions

Help with refining it is welcome

What's the Fortran situation with LLVM? Use flang or gfortran?

flang is still not quite ready for prime time
(I managed to build Sage using flang/clang, but it was not stable)

gfortran is good.

I tried `tox -e local-direct-llvm` on Fedora 32, seems to work.


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2021-07-13 10:47:39

How do I actually run tests in such a local setup (I can't use docker on that machine)


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2021-07-13 16:27:05

You can do `tox -e local-direct-llvm -- ptest`, or `tox -e local-direct-llvm -- bash` if you want a shell


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2021-07-13 16:58:41

I feel like I've had this happen before: I ran `tox -e local-homebrew-macos-standard-llvm` and by yesterday at 18:13 (according to the timestamp on the file in `logs/pkgs`) it said "  [networkx-2.5.1] successfully installed." Then it sat there with no apparent activity until I hit ctrl-C today at 09:56.

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2021-07-13 17:04:34

Prime suspect is `gfan`'s testsuite - see #32088


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2021-07-13 20:24:01

I reran and `gfan`'s testsuite passed. (I had deleted the old log files, so I don't know if that was the problem the first time.) `pillow` failed to build, though. (This is OS X 11.4.)

I think this is just that some of Apple's system headers can only be compiled with Apple's compiler.


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2021-07-13 23:29:17

[I asked a question like this before](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31567#comment:32), but should there be a `make` target (or similar) that cleans up the `.tox` directory? Or if we are using `tox`, are we just supposed to know what we're doing? Maybe [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59563746/how-to-clean-a-tox-environment-after-running) is relevant.


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2021-07-13 23:49:29

I think what you want, in addition to just removing the .tox directory, is #31111 (`tox -e local-direct`: Clean up the effects of previous `tox -e local-....`)

No, if you just do

```

then Pillow builds with Homebrew's clang (perhaps there is a more intelligent way, including some header?).

Comment by dimpase created at 2021-07-15 11:51:38

with the patch in comment:25, I can build and doctest Sage on Homebrew  llvm/clang/clang++ just fine (modulo few known errors).
(perpending `/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin` to PATH)

Upstream report?

do you have any idea what Pillow is doing in a non-standard way while building Python extensions?
(after all, everything else builds, and these `TARGET_OS_...` are used in the SDK's `stdio.h` and `stdlib.h`)

Perhaps it's a setuptools bug?

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2021-07-15 17:55:26

Pillow's setup.py does a lot of "discovery", the details are messy. To isolate what is happening here, you could use the `PILLOW_BUILD_EXT` setting from tox.ini that I use for the `macos-nohomebrew` environment

Replying to [ticket:30835 mkoeppe]:
> Portability issues (solving them should not be a prerequisite for the present ticket):

Let me emphasize that the scope of this ticket should be to add the test environments, which will facilitate testing and porting. 

It is not within the scope to do all the porting work.

I am not sure I understand how to 
"use the `PILLOW_BUILD_EXT` setting from tox.ini"

If I 

```
export PILLOW_BUILD_EXT="--disable-platform-guessing --disable-jpeg2000 --disable-imagequant --disable-tiff --disable-lcms --disable-webp --disable-webpmux --disable-xcb"
```

it cannot find `zlib`. If I remove `--disable-platform-guessing` it fails with

OK, let's deal with Homebrew clang on #32207
