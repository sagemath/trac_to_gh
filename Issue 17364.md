Keywords: asymptotics

We intend to implement asymptotic expressions in Sage. We would like to do computations with simple expressions such as

n<sup>2</sup> + n<sup>3/2</sup> + O(n<sup>1/2</sup>),

but also with expressions such as

2<sup>n</sup> * n + O(n*log(n))

or even multivariate expressions such as

3*k/n + O(k<sup>2</sup> / n<sup>2</sup>) with |k| <= n<sup>(1/2)</sup>.

Of course, O(n) - O(n) = O(n) must hold.

Eventually, specified O-constants shall also be supported.

The current plan is to implement the following classes (plus derivatives for more concrete situations). For simplicity, the corresponding parents are not listed here.
    
 AsymptoticGrowthElement::
  hold _one_ term, e.g. n<sup>2</sup> or k/n or n*log(n). This can compare, multiply etc.,
  but has **no** coefficient. Here, only the order of magnitude shall be managed.

 AsymptoticTerm::

  holds one AsymptoticGrowthElement, plus information on the coefficient or that it is an O-term etc.

 AsymptoticExpression::

  represents the sum of several AsymptoticTerms.


The idea is to override AsymptoticGrowthElement to obtain specific behaviour (as mentioned in our wishlist) because it seems unlikely to be able to handle everything in one class.
For starters, there will be an GrowthGroupPowerElement.

AsymptoticTerm is expected to be more general; it might be necessary to override it for the case of specified O-constants.

AsymptoticExpression, however, can be general enough to deal with all cases; here, the sum, the product, the exponential function, etc. are implemented in a generic setting.

In #17600, we start with AsymptoticGrowthElement.

Thanks---I'm involved in both tickets ;)

At the moment both are independent, but when the asymptotic expressions are created, one can use them in the calculations (or at least as a possible output format) in #10519.

Are "asymptotic expressions" equivalent to "transseries" (http://arxiv.org/abs/0801.4877, http://www.texmacs.org/joris/ln/ln-abs.html)? Or are they more general, less general, or partially overlapping in scope?

Hi,

Whatever you propose, I would say that the most important thing to do is to consider the integration into Sage. In other words:
- how it will be used from Sage
- how it does interact with the Symbolic ring, polynomials, fraction fields, power series and any objects where asymptotic makes sens
I do not see any of this in the ticket description. And it is definitely important to think of it **before** starting the implementation.

I only see a list of classes, parents and elements whose goal is basically to mimic the symbolic ring by adding some big Oh. I do not see the point of creating so much classes to handle asymptotic terms. Please, motivate and explain your choices.

Vincent

In fact, the appropriate concept would be \"Puiseux series\", which are Laurent series (with negative exponents allowed) in fractional powers of your variables.\n\nFor asymptotic expansions you have x+O(x<sup>(1/2)</sup>) = O(x<sup>(1/2)</sup>), which is consistent with Puiseux series in t=1/x.\n\nThe usual implementation for Puiseux series is as\n\n[d,N,a[N],a[N+1],a[N+2],...,finite number of terms]\n\nmeaning\n\nsum_{i=N..} a_i* x^(i/d)\n\nFor arithmetic you just first bring series in common denominator \"d\" and then do power series arithmetic.\n\nFor multivariate series, the appropriate behaviour is caught by \"local term orders\". SingularLib might offer some useful things already.\n\nNote that a series in n and log(n) can be treated as a bivariate series, with an appropriate term order on the variables signifying \"n\" and \"log(n)\", for asymptotic series probably again modelling these with X=1/n and Y= 1/log(n).\n\nSo I think this ticket can be realized by implementing \"multivariate puiseux series\", which would be useful in a lot of settings. It would be better if (the underlying ring) would also be called \"multivariate puiseux series ring\" because that would improve discoverability.\n\nSearching the literature for these terms will probably also make it easier to find relevant algorithms.",

Yes, and you could get a lot of leverage out of making that link more prominent. In fact, the appropriate concept would be "Puiseux series", which are Laurent series (with negative exponents allowed) in fractional powers of your variables.

For asymptotic expansions you have x+O(x<sup>(1/2)</sup>) = O(x<sup>(1/2)</sup>), which is consistent with Puiseux series in t=1/x.

The usual implementation for Puiseux series is as

[d,N,a[N],a[N+1],a[N+2],...,finite number of terms]

meaning

sum_{i=N..} a_i* x^(i/d)

For arithmetic you just first bring series in common denominator "d" and then do power series arithmetic.

For multivariate series, the appropriate behaviour is caught by "local term orders". SingularLib might offer some useful things already.

Note that a series in n and log(n) can be treated as a bivariate series, with an appropriate term order on the variables signifying "n" and "log(n)", for asymptotic series probably again modelling these with X=1/n and Y= 1/log(n).

So I think this ticket can be realized by implementing "multivariate puiseux series", which would be useful in a lot of settings. It would be better if (the underlying ring) would also be called "multivariate puiseux series ring" because that would improve discoverability.

Searching the literature for these terms will probably also make it easier to find relevant algorithms.

We are aware of Puiseux series.
The restrictions imposed by Puiseux series are that they cannot handle non-rational exponents like `sqrt(2)` or symbolic constants. However, we'd like to be able to handle these.
Moreover, we can work with terms like `exp(x+O(1))=O(exp(x))`.

> For multivariate series, the appropriate behaviour is caught by "local term orders". SingularLib might offer some useful things already.

> Note that a series in n and log(n) can be treated as a bivariate series, with an appropriate term order on the variables signifying "n" and "log(n)", for asymptotic series probably again modelling these with X=1/n and Y= 1/log(n).

In addition to the relation between `n` and `log(n)`, our asymptotic expansions will be able to handle dependencies between the variables as well, e.g. `x <= sqrt(y)`.

> So I think this ticket can be realized by implementing "multivariate puiseux series", which would be useful in a lot of settings. It would be better if (the underlying ring) would also be called "multivariate puiseux series ring" because that would improve discoverability.

As mentioned above, once we have expansions at `0`, we have a MultivariatePuiseuxSeriesRing as a special case; renaming it now is not expedient.
