This is a follow-up to #13605. I think that several `__classcall_private__` methods in sage.combinat.partition are not needed.

There are some `__classcall_private__` methods that do an extensive preprocessing, or that deal with optional arguments. I work on making the latter automatic. But currently, thee `__classcall_private__` applications make sense.

However, I doubt that a `__classcall_private__` method makes sense that simply puts a `Integer(k)` around an argument `k` that is supposed to be an integer (python int or whatever). Since caching is by equality and since k as int, Integer, NN, QQ etc. evaluates equal, caching is not an issue here.

In addition to that, in my patch I suggest to cache a couple of data in a cached_method. This is because these data inherit from `UniqueRepresentation` and hence are only weakly cached, so that it makes sense to cache them in a partition, if this partition will need the data repeatedly.

I think it is better to keep separate topics on separate tickets. Hence, I *only* remove `__classcall_private__` here, but do not cache stuff.

Could you rebase this over #11410 (which is essentially done)? Other than that, it looks good.

Thanks Simon,
