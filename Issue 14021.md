# Issue 14021: Remove redundant classcall_private from partitions

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14225

Original creator: SimonKing

Original creation time: 2013-03-04 23:06:35

Assignee: sage-combinat

CC:  sage-combinat tscrim

Keywords: partition classcall

This is a follow-up to #13605. I think that several `__classcall_private__` methods in sage.combinat.partition are not needed.

There are some `__classcall_private__` methods that do an extensive preprocessing, or that deal with optional arguments. I work on making the latter automatic. But currently, thee `__classcall_private__` applications make sense.

However, I doubt that a `__classcall_private__` method makes sense that simply puts a `Integer(k)` around an argument `k` that is supposed to be an integer (python int or whatever). Since caching is by equality and since k as int, Integer, NN, QQ etc. evaluates equal, caching is not an issue here.

In addition to that, in my patch I suggest to cache a couple of data in a cached_method. This is because these data inherit from `UniqueRepresentation` and hence are only weakly cached, so that it makes sense to cache them in a partition, if this partition will need the data repeatedly.

Oops, I forgot to document the new cached function. Patch updated.

I think it is better to keep separate topics on separate tickets. Hence, I _only_ remove `__classcall_private__` here, but do not cache stuff.

Could you rebase this over #11410 (which is essentially done)? Other than that, it looks good.

Thanks Simon,

Travis

I am just thinking: Shouldn't `Partitions()` (called without arguments) be cached? This is only a single value, and it occurs frequently in the code.

"Pending" because of #11410?

Yes, but in any case it would be sage-5.9, not sage-5.8.

Changing my mind because of #14228.
