As noted in #29397, Cygwin has openblas but does not provide openblas.pc; instead blas.pc, cblas.pc, lapack.pc are provided

From http://cygwin.1069669.n5.nabble.com/Updated-openblas-0-3-3-1-td142613.html:

  2) No devel package is provided as liblapack-devel already provide the needed headers and import. Openblas is fully compatible with Netlib BLAS.

  3) libopenblas consist of a single file /usr/bin/cygblas-0.dll that will precede in PATH the liblapack0 /usr/lib/lapack/cygblas-0.dll    and used instead. Removing libopenblas will restore the    usage of Netlib BLAS

if we use openblas we would need to generate missing openblas.pc
(same problem on fedora)

build/pkgs/openblas has a python script for this purpose, by the way.

we should ask cygwin maintainers to fix the install and provide pc file.

write_pc_file.py seems to do the opposite direction -- it writes blas.pc, cblas.pc, lapack.pc. Cygwin already has those

For checking whether a system blas on Linux is actually openblas, we can use a function test for openblas_get_config.

On Cygwin, I don't know a better solution than to do `strings $(which cygblas-0.dll) | grep openblas` to distinguish the good openblas from the bad generic blas.
