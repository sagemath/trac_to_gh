# Issue 22321: .volume() of polyhedron does not handle unbounded polyhedron properly

Keywords: days84, geometry, volume

Currently, the method `.volume()` of the polyhedron class (see [.volume()](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/geometry/sage/geometry/polyhedron/base.html#sage.geometry.polyhedron.base.Polyhedron_base.volume)) does not handle unbounded polyhedron internally and lets `.triangulate()` return an error:


```

sage: P = Polyhedron(vertices = [[1, 0], [0, 1]], rays = [[1, 1]])
sage: P.volume()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
in triangulate(self, engine, connected, fine, regular, star)
...
NotImplementedError: I can only triangulate compact polytopes.

```


One possibility would be to return infinity `oo` in this case.

Or zero depending on whether it is full-dimensional or not?

> Or zero depending on whether it is full-dimensional or not? 

This is related to #16045, the user may want a different output in this case: the volume in the euclidean sense, or the "area" relative to the affine space, or even relative to the lattice index...

What should be the expected behavior for non-compact non-fulldimensional polyhedra?

From reading #16045 it seems that currently `engine='lrs'` provides the volume in the affine hull while `auto` provides the volume in the ambient space. To make your new function agree with this, I would expect the following output:


```
sage: Q = Polyhedron(ieqs=[[0, 1, 0], [0, -1, 0], [0, 0, 1]]); Q
A 1-dimensional polyhedron in QQ^2 defined as the convex hull of 1 vertex and 1 ray
sage: Q.volume()
0
sage: Q.volume(engine='lrs')
+Infinity
```


Your version give `+Infinity` in both cases. 
I added the changes necessary for this, feel free to reset to your commit, if you don't like it. Perhaps it would be best to fix #16045 first.

Yes, I agree to your changes. Looks good to me.

Yes, one should first agree on #16045 and set this properly here afterwards. I put it as a dependency.

What about:


```
sage: P = Polyhedron(ieqs = [[1,1,1],[-1,-1,-1],[3,1,0]]); P
A 1-dimensional polyhedron in QQ^2 defined as the convex hull of 1 vertex and 1 ray
sage: P.volume(measure='induced_rational')

Sage should return directly `+Infinity` in this case as well.

Further, in the docstring, I would change:


```
* ``induced_rational``: Scaling of the Lebesgue measure for lattice polytopes
```


for


```
* ``induced_rational``: Scaling of the Lebesgue measure for rational polytopes
```

There is a line in a doctest that is not needed; please delete:

```
+            sage: v = Dexact.faces(2)[0].as_polyhedron().volume(measure='induced', engine='internal')
```

Otherwise, this looks good to me!

Comment by saliola created at 2017-08-25 20:57:49

I made the change myself and pushed it.

JP says that the last thing to do is the run the optional tests.

Ok!

Looks good to go! The bot seems to get unrelated errors. The one done at 2017-08-27 22:33:58 seems to be fine.

I set this as positive review.
