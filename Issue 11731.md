Apparently fast_callable doesn't know that there is a C log function, for some reason:


```
sage: f(x)=log(x)
sage: g=fast_callable(f,vars=[x],domain=float)
sage: g.python_calls()
[log]
```


A quick glance at the source code indicates that the log function should be translated to the C equivalent.  So maybe it's an issue with not recognizing the log for some reason.
