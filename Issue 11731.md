# Issue 11731: fast_callable doesn't know about natural log

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/11903

Original creator: jason

Original creation time: 2011-10-07 00:53:23

Assignee: burcin

Apparently fast_callable doesn't know that there is a C log function, for some reason:


```
sage: f(x)=log(x)
sage: g=fast_callable(f,vars=[x],domain=float)
sage: g.python_calls()
[log]
```


A quick glance at the source code indicates that the log function should be translated to the C equivalent.  So maybe it's an issue with not recognizing the log for some reason.

I guess it's been a while since I submitted a patch!

I think it's okay to set it back to positive review.
