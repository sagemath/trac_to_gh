Seems good.

However, is there reason to use formal trac reference in comments? See for example `modular/dims.py`. You have also removed some dot - intentionally? "See trac 1234" or "See trac 1234." - I don't know which one it should be.

Well, I agree that doing that in the comments is not useful, but not harmful either. It will simplify the grep in the future by removing false positives.

OK, good to go then.

This shouldn't be done in code:

```diff
diff --git a/src/sage/calculus/functions.py b/src/sage/calculus/functions.py
index 29482d9..3048347 100644
--- a/src/sage/calculus/functions.py
+++ b/src/sage/calculus/functions.py
`@``@` -94,7 +94,7 `@``@` def wronskian(*args):
             row = lambda n: [diff(f, n) for f in fs]
         # NOTE: I rewrote the below as two lines to avoid a possible subtle
         # memory management problem on some platforms (only VMware as far
-        # as we know?).  See trac #2990.
+        # as we know?).  See :trac:`2990`.
         # There may still be a real problem that this is just hiding for now.
         A = matrix([row(_) for _ in range(len(fs))])
         return A.determinant()
```

Sorry, but what do you mean ? Do you want to go back to `trac #2990` in the comments ?

Of course. It's ridiculous to put ReST markup outside of docstrings.

Impressive.

This is OK for me.

Did somebody check that the documentation actually builds? Apart from this: positive review.

I built html docs. And to be sure, I am now (again) running short doctests just to be sure.

I did not check every one of built html page, just some random sample. Those were good. I mark this as positive review.

Resolution: fixed

This ticket is closed. The most recent commits that were made after the positive review are not in the release, so open a new ticket for that.

See #19534.
