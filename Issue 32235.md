Case in point (many other examples exist...) :


```
sage: var("x", domain="positive")
x
sage: u = -1/2*I*x + 1/2*I*sqrt(x^2 - 1) + 1/2*I/(x - sqrt(x^2 - 1))
sage: u.simplify()
-1/2*I*x + 1/2*I*sqrt(x^2 - 1) + 1/2*I/(x - sqrt(x^2 - 1))
sage: u._giac_().simplify()._sage_()
I*sqrt(x^2 - 1)
sage: u._fricas_().simplify()._sage_()
-(I*x^2 - I*sqrt(x^2 - 1)*x - I)/(x - sqrt(x^2 - 1))
sage: u._sympy_().simplify()._sage_()
-I*(x^2 - sqrt(x^2 - 1)*x - 1)/(x - sqrt(x^2 - 1))
sage: mathematica.FullSimplify(u).sage()
I*sqrt(x^2 - 1)
```


Suggestion : give to the `simplify` method of symbolic expressions (and its wrapper function) an `algorithm` keyword selecting an alternative to our "default" (which is to send the expression to Maxima and accept whatever Maxima sends back to us...).

This might be also useful for the more specialized methods/functions (such as `simplify_trig`). Advice required...

Advice also required about adding it to `simplify_full`, which aims to be a useful helper in complicated cases, but often bites more than it can swallow...

This does the job excusively for the `simplify` method of symbolic expressions and the `simplify()` function.

Passes `ptestlong` without failure ==> `needs_review`.

Lgtm, except that the examples in `sage.calculus.functional.simplify()` should use `simplify(foo)`, not `foo.simplify()`.

(I am unable to help with deciding exactly what to do with other simplification methods, unfortunately, but I like the idea of having keywords to choose a backend there as well.)

Right. I cut n' pasted the method examplen and forgot to modify it for the functional syntax. Shame on me.

Done, passes its doctest after rebasing on 9.5.beta7. Running `ptestlong` to be damn sure. Stay tuned...

Too bad. The specialized methods may (Maxima) or may not (giac, fricas) exost in the other backends... Advice still needed.

`ptestlong` gives exactly the same failures as thos observed in 9.5.beta7 ==> probably worth `positive_review`.

Temporarily setting `needs work` , I'll set `needs_review` after pushing my edits.
