This is a meta ticket for tracking improvements on combinatorial
Species and decomposable classes.

Projects
--------

(TODO: create a ticket for each of them)

 - Port over the beautiful documentation on species of Aldor-Combinat

 - Support for my_species().structures() returning the decomposable
   class of all labelled structures for this species. Same thing for
   unlabelled classes

 - Support for weighted enumeration, as in MuPAD-Combinat

 - Support for the "Alias" feature of MuPAD-Combinat

 - Support for pluging in unlabelled and labelled enumerated sets
   into a species

 - Make labelled enumerated sets (i.e. enumerated sets which take a
   bunch of distinct labels as input) into species.

 - Add a module sage.combinat.species.labeled (and unlabelled)
   containing objects like Atom, Prod, Union, ... to almost emulate
   the syntax of combstruct/CS/decomposableObjects, while using
   species under the scene

 - Improve the user interface and error messages

 - Standalone Python library containing just what is needed for simple
   species

 - Generation of C code? Probably not needed anymore

 - Random generation (based on counting, or Boltzman)

 - Ranking/unranking

Hi,
This ticket is almost 2 years old. Is there any progress on using combinatorial species for random generation (based on counting or Boltzmann)?

Thanks.

Best regards,

Changing keywords from "" to "species".
