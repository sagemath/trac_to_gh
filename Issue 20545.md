# Issue 20545: missing cimport in module '.': sage/rings/rational.pxd

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20782

Original creator: jdemeyer

When cythonizing Sage, the following shows up:

```
[sagelib-7.3.beta3] missing cimport in module '.': ./sage/rings/rational.pxd
[sagelib-7.3.beta3] missing cimport in module '.': sage/rings/rational.pxd
```


This is potentially a serious error, since it indicates a problem in Cython's dependency checking.

The whole "rings" folder is an horrible mess of circular imports, see #20629
for a first cleanup.

I would suggest to *not* change any more imports until this is fixed.

Thanks! Please keep this ticket in mind when changing `cimport` statements.

ok. Do you understand what is the problem with #20629 ?

I haven't really looked at that. But in any case, it has nothing to do with the Cython issue on this ticket.
