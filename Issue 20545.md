When cythonizing Sage, the following shows up:

```
[sagelib-7.3.beta3] missing cimport in module '.': ./sage/rings/rational.pxd
[sagelib-7.3.beta3] missing cimport in module '.': sage/rings/rational.pxd
```


This is potentially a serious error, since it indicates a problem in Cython's dependency checking.

I haven't really looked at that. But in any case, it has nothing to do with the Cython issue on this ticket.
