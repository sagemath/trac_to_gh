We fix these Cython warnings either by

1. Removing `inline` for the declaration in the `.pxd` file

2. or, not declaring the function in the `.pxd` file at all (in case the function is never used outside of the module defining it).

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23771
