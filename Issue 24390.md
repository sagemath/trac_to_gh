Good move.

However, i got a failing doctest in `src/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_element.pyx`, that reveals a criminal (though documented) failure in the previous behaviour of `RBF`, that `x = RBF(1.0, 0.1) ; x == x` returns `True`. The doctest seems to have been introduced in #22087 without complain.

Let me suggest to:

- move the doctest `x = RBF(1.0, 0.1) ; x == x` to something specific to ARB (it has nothing to do with polynomials actually)
- add the doctest that triggered #22087 proposed at [/22076#comment:5 #22076:comment:5] in `src/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_element.pyx`
- adapt the doctests corresponding to `RIF` in `src/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_element.pyx` (the block just above) to the `RBF` case.
