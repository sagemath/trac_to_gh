# Issue 29242: Forward Breadth first search

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29479

Original creator: @Shlokatadistance

Original creation time: 2020-04-08 13:15:57

So I have been working on an algorithm, which was described in a research paper, where it makes use of the forward breadthfirstsearch, a new type of bfs algorithm, which simply traverses from one vertex in a 'forward' directed sense, while I am working on this proper implementation, I am currently stuck at the point because sage math can return in and out vertices as a list, but won't that process for each vertex be simply too tedious and longer in the run-time?
In a nutshell, is there any method of traversing in a directed sense beginning from a particular vertex?

If I understand the ticket description clearly, you are asking if we can traverse from a particular vertex in fixed direction(that is to say either towards its in-neighbors or out-neighbors). right?

If that's the case you can call `g.breadth_first_search(source, neighbors = neighbors=g.neighbors_out)` for Forward_BFS and `g.breadth_first_search(source, neighbors = neighbors=g.neighbors_in)` for Backward_BFS

I see, that was the issue, because the direction flag in my case would turn void, especially if both forwards and backwards path were present between a pair of vertices.

I guess that solves it. \\
Please change milestone to `invalid/duplicate/wontfix`
