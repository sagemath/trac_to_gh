Even though the field fell out of fashion a century ago, sometimes it is useful to have the formula for invariants of algebraic forms. This ticket implements some a basic framework, and in that the binary quartic and ternary cubic.

IMHO, the docstring "algebraic forms" needs a bit of explanation, something like "algebraic forms, i.e., homogeneous polynomials"

`AlgebraicForm` an abstract base class, you'll never get to see its docstring unless you want to extend the module. So I don't see any point in being pedagogical there. If you never heard the term and can't be bothered to google it then you shouldn't extend this module.

google, schmoogle... :â€“)

it's not about being pedagogical, it's about being understood. I have never seen the expression "algebraic form" used to mean what you mean, and I suppose many mathematicians would share my point of view here.

OK, added.

Of course I'm realistic enough to see that nobody is ever going to bother to review this ticket, but its still important for my work so I'll keep adding stuff :-P

I'm very interested!  And could use this, specifically binary quadratics and quartics and ternary cubics come up in 2- and 3-descent on elliptic curves.  I just have too many other things right now, but I'm happy to see the updates being added.

I think the documentation of various parts of `QuadraticForm()` ought to be improved: one needs to explicitly define the order on monomials used in `coeffs()` (and `monomials()`).
Somehow, `coeffs()`'s docs still talk about binary forms --- is it a leftover from the previous version?

As well, what about an alias `coefficients()` for `coeffs()` ?

I also think it should be placed into `sage/rings` rather than `sage/schemes`, as it deals with ring elements (of the corresponding ring of invariants).

I've addressed Dima's corrections. Also, folded into one patch.

Patchbot didn't get the memo about the folded patch.

Cool :-)

```
        ary = ['unary', 'binary', 'ternary', 'quaternary', 'quinary',
               'senary', 'septenary', 'octonary', 'nonary', 'denary']
        try:
            s += ary[self._n-1]
        except IndexError:
            s += 'algebraic'
        ic = ['monic', 'quadratic', 'cubic', 'quartic', 'quintic',
              'sextic', 'septimic', 'octavic', 'nonic', 'decimic',
              'undecimic', 'duodecimic']
        s += ' '
        try:
            s += ic[self._d-1]
        except IndexError:
            s += 'form'
```

I actually think this should be documented in Latin...

Also, there is some dubious use of `assert` where `raise ValueError` would be more appropriate.

The `_check_covariant` method containing the assertions are only used in testing the module, but not any user-visible functionality. I fixed the LaTeX error, printing the 8059 page reference manual now (j/k ;-)

Indeed, I always wondered why we bother with the PDF manual...

Just finished checking the 8059 pages.

Comment by nbruin created at 2013-01-25 09:15:57

Just curious: What's the point of `InvariantTheoryFactory`? Is there a benefit to the routines in there being methods rather than just module-level functions?


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2013-01-25 10:36:30

I'm pretty sure you could do the same thing with module-level functions, there is little difference in Python between the two. You'd have to use an extra file to isolate the module, but you save yourself instatiating the class.
