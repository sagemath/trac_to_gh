Even though the field fell out of fashion a century ago, sometimes it is useful to have the formula for invariants of algebraic forms. This ticket implements some a basic framework, and in that the binary quartic and ternary cubic.

I think the documentation of various parts of `QuadraticForm()` ought to be improved: one needs to explicitly define the order on monomials used in `coeffs()` (and `monomials()`).
Somehow, `coeffs()`'s docs still talk about binary forms --- is it a leftover from the previous version?

As well, what about an alias `coefficients()` for `coeffs()` ?
