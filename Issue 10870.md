Keywords: Spec prime ideals spectrum

Spec doesn't take an optional argument to check if a point (ideal) is prime. For example,

```
sage: Spec(Z)(ZZ.ideal(6))
```

returns a "Point on Spectrum...".

Passing check=True only through `sage.schemes.generic.point.SchemeTopologicalPoint_prime_ideal.__init__`
