# Issue 22466: proper polymake preferences, perhaps using Python 'with'

Polymake's `prefer` is bad because it is too persistent, writing to a preference file.
We cannot use `prefer_now` directly because it is local to the current line.
We should have a way to set preferences local to a code block.
Perhaps a Python context manager (using the `with` keyword) would be the right solution.

I agree that we don't want Sage to set preferences permanently (unless the user asks it). Although a "with" block may be a good solution for modules, I don't think that we want that in an interactive session.

So, I think ideally we would have a method `polymake.preferences`, so that

```
sage: polymake.preferences(...)
```

would set preferences that expire when the sage session ends, and

```python
with polymake.preferences(...):
    many
    lines
    of
    code
```

would set preferences that expire when the "with" block ends.
