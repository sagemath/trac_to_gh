The doctests in the new code are raising errors. 

This seems to be because `ZZ.hom()` creates a `RingHomomorphism_coercion` object, rather than an Integer_to_IntegerMod object.

I noticed the same thing with the dependency. Everything works well now that it has been added.

These tests are failing on other tickets as well. So does not seem to be related to this.
