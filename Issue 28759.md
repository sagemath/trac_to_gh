# Issue 28759: Have `implementation='NTL'` work for series over ZZ

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28996

Original creator: soehms

Original creation time: 2020-01-12 17:22:00

CC:  tscrim

Keywords: Power series, Laurent series, Puiseux series, NTL

Currently, we can use NTL for polynomials defined over the integers. But for power and Laurent series this option is not available:


```
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(ZZ, implementation='NTL')
sage: P.<y> = PowerSeriesRing(ZZ, implementation='NTL')
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: unknown power series implementation: 'NTL'
```


The aim of this ticket is to have NTL available here, as well.

If this gets a (morally) green patchbot, then positive review.

On Python 2:

```
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/rings/power_series_ring.py", line 89, in sage.rings.power_series_ring
Failed example:
    type(t.polynomial())
Expected:
    <class 'sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_integer_dense_flint.Polynomial_integer_dense_flint'>
Got:
    <type 'sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_integer_dense_flint.Polynomial_integer_dense_flint'>
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/rings/power_series_ring.py", line 92, in sage.rings.power_series_ring
Failed example:
    type(s.polynomial())
Expected:

Sebastian, just replace `<class` with `<...` for compatibility.
