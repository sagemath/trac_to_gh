CC:  @tscrim

Keywords: Power series, Laurent series, Puiseux series, NTL

Currently, we can use NTL for polynomials defined over the integers. But for power and Laurent series this option is not available:

```
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(ZZ, implementation='NTL')
sage: P.<y> = PowerSeriesRing(ZZ, implementation='NTL')
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: unknown power series implementation: 'NTL'
```

The aim of this ticket is to have NTL available here, as well.
