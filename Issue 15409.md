# Issue 15409: Move monsky_washnitzer.py from elliptic_curves to hyperelliptic_curves

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: kedlaya

Original creation time: 2014-01-07 23:07:31

CC:  defeo

Keywords: Monsky-Washnitzer, elliptic curves, hyperelliptic curves

The code for computing Frobenius matrices in sage/elliptic_curves/monsky_washnitzer.py applies to hyperelliptic curves, not just elliptic curves. As such, it should be relocated accordingly. (This ticket is an unresolved issue from #8305.)

Still needs work.
For some reason I now get a few `fftRep` errors in the matrix folder (`benchmark.py` and `matrix_modn_dense_template.pxi`).
Maybe soimething like #2843.

Documentation doesn't build after a "make doc-clean". Without the cleaning it works due to cached data.

I've just merged trac/develop on my branch on gcc110 and make doc-clean and make and no problem.
I'll give it another round of doc-clean and then distclean if I get no problems.

Everything is still fine even after a make distclean.
May I have forgotten aother cache?

Oh, or you mean I have to modify the rst stuff?

My bad, after a distclean it errors out.
