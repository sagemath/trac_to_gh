It would be very convenient to have a function such as RR.to_prec(prec) for p-adic rings and field, i.e. given a p-adic field K (or ring), I wish there was a function K.to_prec(prec) that would return a field just like K, but with precision prec. For instance, when doing a computation one could run into the issue of having to increase precision. I would favour a name like "change_precision", though "to_prec" should probably at least be used as an alias.
