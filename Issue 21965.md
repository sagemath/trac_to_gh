Changing status from new to needs_review.

Fixed by disabling the warning when the pari and sage polynomials only differ by their variable names... but I really don't know if that's the right thing to do.

Could you find a doctest involving only number fields?

An example only involving number fields: 


```
  y = QQ['y'].gen()
  R = QQ.extension(y^2-2,'a')['x']
  R("a*x").factor()
```
