MacPorts does not install a `python3` executable, only versioned executables `python3.8`, `python3.9`. 

Unclear why it gets stuck in the build -- look like yet another library threads vs. python multiprocessing problem, like the ones that we chased in the parallel docbuild ticket not so long ago.
Does it go away if you repeat the build (it will not start from scratch)

Yes, the additional isolation work to ignore homebrew in /usr/local is only done if you use the factors `macos-nohomebrew`. 

> so I had to use `tox -e macos-nohomebrew-local-macports-minimal` — I hope I got that right

This variant should work better now. What went wrong in the previous version is that it prescribed using the MacPorts-provided gfortran compiler, but in the configuration `macports-minimal` that one is not actually installed.

I thought about this yesterday but decided against it. I think it's useful for developers to be able to reproduce the build behavior on user machines that have both homebrew and macports installed.

> Conversely, and I haven't tried seriously installing macports on a system, so I don't know if this is an issue, but should homebrew builds also try to exclude macports?

I haven't tried yet with a global installation of macports. Given that macports by default does not install into `/usr/local`, there is much less potential for macports leaking into the build, although there could be packages that check the standard macports install location explicitly.

With `--enable-editable`, it did at least end when building the Sage library failed. The end of the log file looks like this:

Thanks for testing!

This `error: command '/usr/bin/gcc' failed with exit code 1` without an actual gcc error message is really puzzling. 

Also in the previous logs that you sent, there was such a message at the end but I didn't see an actual error either.

Could you try what happens now if you do 
`SKIP_SYSTEM_PKG_INSTALL=1 SKIP_BOOTSTRAP=1 SKIP_CONFIGURE=1 EXTRA_CONFIGURE_ARGS="--enable-editable --disable-r" tox -e macos-nohomebrew-local-macports-standard` (note, no `-r` for tox, so this should be fast)

Yes, it looks like not all packages are prepared for installation in a custom prefix.

I've tried installing in the default prefix (`/opt/local`) with sudo (that's `tox -e local-macports-optlocal-standard`), and installation of texlive went through without error. Just did `sudo /opt/local/bin/port install texlive-latex-extra` to get some of the missing files.

There are a few installation notes

```
  gpatch has the following notes:
    The patch tool provided by this port is prefixed with the character 'g' by default making it available as 'gpatch'.
    
    If you want to use 'patch' and other GNU coreutils by default, add this directory to the front of your PATH environment variable:
        /opt/local/libexec/gnubin/

  py310-tox has the following notes:
    To make the Python 3.10 version of tox the one that is run when you execute the commands without a version suffix, e.g. 'tox', run:
    
    port select --set tox tox310
  py310-virtualenv has the following notes:
    The executable is installed as '/opt/local/bin/virtualenv-3.10'. To symlink it to '/opt/local/bin/virtualenv', run:
    
        sudo port select --set virtualenv virtualenv310
  python310 has the following notes:
    To make this the default Python or Python 3 (i.e., the version run by the 'python' or 'python3' commands), run one or both of:
    
        sudo port select --set python python310
        sudo port select --set python3 python310
```


In particular, `tox -e local-macports-optlocal-standard` uses `/usr/bin/python3` as the python.
