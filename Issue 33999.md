This change will make installations of Sage more robust.

Currently, 

```
    /SAGE_ROOT_A/sage -sh -c '/SAGE_ROOT_B/venv/bin/python3 -c "import sage.env; print(sage.env.SAGE_ROOT)"'
```
will give `SAGE_ROOT_A` (bad), whereas

```
    /SAGE_ROOT_A/sage -sh -c '/SAGE_ROOT_B/venv/bin/sage -c "import sage.env; print(sage.env.SAGE_ROOT)"'
```
will give `SAGE_ROOT_B` (good).

Similarly to #33786 (Top-level sage script: Unconditionally set SAGE_ROOT)

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/34236

I am a bit dubious when I see the title. I don't think you should override environment variables unless you absolutely have to.

What I think the ticket is about, and feel free to correct me, is that some variables, needed for sage's own operation, should be internal to sage and not exposed to be modifiable by environment variables. They should be private. If my interpretation is correct we need to start with a list of those variables that should be private.

Well, that's a slightly stronger form than what I've written.

In what I wrote, the value would still be taken from the environment if it is not defined in `sage_conf`.

The stronger form would be fine for me as well.

Thanks for the clarification. I guess from the point of view of what I have written, that makes all variables in `sage_conf` private.

From my distro point of view that may mean adding variables there that I did not care to have. Like `SAGE_ROOT`.

The stronger form can be implemented by just adding `force=True`.

```
    - ``force`` -- boolean (optional, default is ``False``). If
      ``True``, skip the environment variable and only use the
      fallbacks.

When you say in `sage_conf` I think of variables in this file https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/develop/pkgs/sage-conf/_sage_conf/_conf.py.in - do you mean something else? I am asking because I am not sure where `UNAME` comes from.

Yes

It's set in the `sage-env` script and then again there's the fallback in sage.env.

Well, many environment variables set in `sage-env` are completely useless, but I've been reluctant to remove them in case user scripts make use of them.

But by using `force=True` we can at least eliminate the useless dataflow from environment variables to sage.env variables

Agree on the uselessness. sage-on-gentoo is `sage-env` less and so far I haven't had complains. If we had some kind of repo of user scripts, it would be an interesting thing to test.
