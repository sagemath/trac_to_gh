# Issue 14441: cvxopt 1.1.6.p0 fails to build with SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS=yes

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14645

Original creator: strogdon

Original creation time: 2013-05-25 22:53:33

Assignee: leif

CC:  dimpase vbraun schilly mvngu

Keywords: spkg

This is because the pre-built HTML docs have moved in cvxopt 1.1.6.

`.p1` spkg on the way...

>  * Run more tests in `spkg-check` (i.e., those in `src/examples/book/` as well).

P.S.:  Tested with `SAGE_CHECK=yes` on Ubuntu 10.04.4 x86 and x86_64 (FSF GCC 4.7.2 and 4.8.0, respectively).

tested with `SAGE_CHECK=yes` on Sage 5.9 OSX10.6.8 (native lapack/blas), all good. 

I understand that cvxopt docs not integrated into Sage Reference manual, but are installed in `SAGE_LOCAL/share/`. Wouldn't it be good to add a link somewhere in Reference manual to `SAGE_LOCAL/share/` ? Otherwise it's quite hard to find, unless you know something either not really documented, IMHO.

How does one force doc building/installing? I tried 

```
SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS=yes sage -f cvxopt-1.1.6.p1.spkg
```

to no avail.

?  They're in `$SAGE_ROOT/local/share/doc/cvxopt/html/`, indeed probably hard to find ...

I looked at the install log, and it didn't say anything :-)
Please add a message saying that docs were installed (and where to)...

rather, to `SAGE_LOCAL/share/doc/`, The main problem is how to add a relative link. One can in principle do `../../../../...../local/share/doc/`
somewhere in `doc/<LANG>/website/templates/index.html`, but I'm not sure it's a good idea (IMHO the idea to put any docs in `$SAGE_LOCAL/share/doc/` is not so good... )

Perhaps at least there should be a symbolic link `sage/doc/local` pointing there, although I'm not sure how well this works with webservers. 

If this is OK then I can create a patch (hmm, but how? Does hg understand symbolic links? Or it should be in some script, this link creation?)

Harald, as this is www-related (docs structure), could you comment please?


---

Comment by schilly created at 2013-05-26 08:58:55

Uhm, I can't really follow you, sorry … also, the website is rather independent from what you might want to do inside Sage. Is there anything already existing that's similar to what you try to do here? Also, the documentation is usually maintained by minh, I've CCed him.

What I found is this dedicated page: http://www.sagemath.org/doc/numerical_sage/cvxopt.html


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2013-05-26 10:02:56

The docs should link to upstream (http://cvxopt.org) and not to a local file that isn't even installed unless you build with `SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS=yes`. Also, the link in http://www.sagemath.org/doc/numerical_sage/cvxopt.html is broken.

we can have `SAGE_LOCAL/share/doc/cvxopt/index.html` redirecting to  `cvxopt.org` by default, and overwrite it with the local docs if `SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS=yes` during the cvxopt installation.

But there is much more stuff there than just cvxopt docs. E.g. I have currently, on Sage 5.9, 

```
NTL				ipython				ppl
cvxopt				mpfr				pwl
eclib				networkx-1.7.dev_20130506064154	sagetex
```

and again these docs are largely lost to a typical user. I wonder why are they (except cvxopt, that was explicitly installed with `SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS` on) 
there in the first place. It looks like the other packages ignore the value of `SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS`, no?

oops, I meant the setup when the sagenb server is run on a remote host (rather than on localhost); then the docs are served somehow via a web interface, isn't it?

Generally speaking, do  Unix webservers allow symbolic links in the docs they serve?


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2013-05-26 10:28:59

Any feature requests beyond installing cvxopt should go to a different ticket.

Some packages just install their docs by default. Unfortunately, correct usage of autotools often eludes upsteam, requiring manual copying of documentation if desired. The latter is only attempted if `SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS` is set.

Apache disallows symlinks by default. Not that that would help with http://sagemath.org, there we serve only the Sage docs and not a complete Sage installation afaik.

yes, but i don't know enough about sagenb/notebook server to give you any answer, sorry. there are also related issues, e.g. that the sagenb/notebook server doesn't show documentation in other languages – but that's in my eyes outside of the scope of this ticket.

> Generally speaking, do  Unix webservers allow symbolic links in the docs they serve?

yes and no. the documentation on the sage website is served as static file via apache. Following symlinks is explicitly enabled and it's basically just a copy/paste of the output files.
What the notebook server does is different, because it serves the files via its own server – there is also this live-documentation served via /doc/live/… 

So, in conclusion, there are (at least?) three independent things moving around:
* local installation of Sage
* Sage Documentation at sagemath.org/doc (that's where mvgnu and I can weight in, we also have our own script that updates sagemath.org/help.html) 
* sagenb.org [and others] /doc/live/ <- and the menu that's in the help popup window.

actually my idea about the main index.html is not listing individual packages, but just a general link to  `SAGE_LOCAL/share/doc` for "more stuff"... OK, I will open a separate ticket, and set this one to positive review, as soon as my request for a message saying that docs were installed (and where to) in `spkg-install` is honoured.

PS. I've opened #14646 to deal with the main index.html, etc.

I was actually first going to add that, but then did not for a couple of reasons:

 * I hate absolute paths there (as have unfortunately been added back to (additional) messages in the "main" docbuilding, although the messages there are even worse, since they claim the documents had been built even upon errors), but was 100% sure at least some would complain about a relative path in the message.

 * Most other packages don't.

 * Then I'd also added a message in case `SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS!=yes`, telling that the [HTML] docs have not been installed (and why), and how one can change that, which is pretty redundant, as that _should be_ the same for all spkgs.

Orthogonal to that:

Should I delete previous (potentially outdated) docs regardless of `SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS`, which could probably be considered unexpected behaviour?  (E.g. if one reinstalls an spkg just with different flags, or in order to run its test suite, but forgets to set `SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS` to the previous setting?  Does anyone use that variable on a per-package basis?  To me it seems a few people have it set in their shell rcs, and most people don't use it, probably just because they don't know about... B) )

well, how about just saying "installed in SAGE_SHARE/doc" ?

if they are in "wrong" location, yes. Otherwise, that's probably too much trouble --- although I as proposed on #14646, there ought to be a default `SAGE_SHARE/doc/cvxopt/index.html` forwarding to cvxopt website, so, ideally, `SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS!=yes` would mean putting this forwarding back in place...  Well, even more ideally, this functionality shouldn't be on the `spkg-install` level, but above, at `sage -i` level.

That's kind of a relative path... [I would have used] ;-)

So, should I move the `rm -rf ...` out of the `if [ "$SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS" = yes ] ...` branch?  (With a separate message on what's going on ... :-) )

IMHO the idea is that html docs should be built, and then installed, not just copied from provided html/* ?

this is a minimal fix to docs being built/installed. Feel free to add more stuff, or just set it to positive review...

Comment by fbissey created at 2017-08-30 21:24:14

From experience on the sphinx upgrade ticket, you may want to add `typing` along with `sphinx`. And it should be on the other side of the `|` since you don't need to rebuild `cvxopt` each time `sphinx` or `typing` is upgraded.


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2017-08-30 21:29:35

You may have to depend on #23023 because of `typing`. The ticket is merged but not in a released beta yet.

if I try to build with `SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS=yes`

Any idea what `sphinxcontrib-websupport` is all about? Is it another `sphinx` package we need to distribute, but we don't?

Yes it is a runtime dependency. It used to be part of sphinx proper. I had to write a new ebuild for it for Gentoo (actually it was a bit more complicated than that but I digress). So far we didn't appear to have a use for it in sage, cvxopt is the first package to require it.


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2017-08-30 23:57:37

Indeed, build with `SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS=yes` completes after

```
./sage --pip install sphinxcontrib-websupport
```

Do we thus open another ticket to make it a standard (pip) package?

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2018-03-08 16:41:19

1. The dependencies are not quite right: `sphinx` depends on `sphinxcontrib-websupport`, not the other way around. Also, it makes little sense to add `sphinxcontrib-websupport` as direct dependency of `cvxopt`. Adding `sphinx` should be sufficient.

In `cvxopt/spkg-install`:

2. You can simplify

```
    if [ -d $SAGE_LOCAL/share/doc/cvxopt/html ] ; then
       rm -rf $SAGE_LOCAL/share/doc/cvxopt/html
    fi
```

to

```
       rm -rf "$SAGE_LOCAL/share/doc/cvxopt/html"
```


3. You should quote `"$SAGE_LOCAL"`

4. It would be good to fix the indentation: use 4 spaces and also indent the comments.

I don't understand, are you saying one can install `sphinxcontrib-websupport` without installing `sphinx` first? This sounds strange to me, as the former is a component of the latter.

Also, it makes little sense to add `sphinxcontrib-websupport` as direct dependency of `cvxopt`. Adding `sphinx` should be sufficient.

Only if the dependencies are changed as you proposed.

It's not really a component. It's more like an extra package.

```
sphinxcontrib-webuspport provides a Python API to easily integrate 
Sphinx documentation into your Web application.
```


From this one concludes that it is useless without sphinx, and thus it is its optional component. Do you know other uses for it? I don't.

It's not optional. Even if you don't use it, Sphinx won't run without `sphinxcontrib-websupport`.

No they are not! Why are you saying that Sphinx won't run without `sphinxcontrib-websupport` while it is perfectly doing this on the current beta?
Do you think I have added a link to the tarball merely as work of art?

I had to set it back to "needs work" because it was wrong and I didn't want anybody accidentally setting this to "positive review" in that state.

The reason for the silence is that I need more time to test things, gather evidence and explain you properly why it is wrong.

How hard is to add a comment saying "I need more time to explain"? Otherwise I  take it as "I have already explained this" and it makes makes me feel stupid.

And I am most probably not the only one who gets upset this way.

I wonder whether the call to the sphinx-build command needs some MathJax-specific options. This is cause I get source TeX formulas in e.g.
`SAGE_LOCAL/share/doc/cvxopt/fftw.html` (compare it with http://cvxopt.org/userguide/fftw.html)

It could also be that some other things need to be done to get MathJax working here, I don't know (perhaps it's not relevant to this ticket)

On  ​http://cvxopt.org/userguide/fftw.html there is no MathJax, they generate png images for formulae. E.g.

```
<dd><p>Replaces the columns of a dense complex matrix with their inverse
discrete Fourier transforms: if <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">X</span></code> has <img class="math" src="_images/math/e11f2701c4a39c7fe543a6c4150b421d50f1c159.png" alt="n"/> rows,</p>
<div class="math">
<p><img src="_images/math/ea898f4dc35c3010225ae66a6d7993bae88b3a56.png" alt="X[k,:] :=
    \frac{1}{n} \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} e^{2\pi j k \sqrt{-1}/n} X[j,:],
    \qquad k=0,\ldots,n-1."/></p>
</div></dd></dl>
```


I don't know whether we should follow the suit, or leave it as it is, or
make it use MathJax...
