This should be rebased to #13756 (which partially serves the same goal as this ticket).

Patch looks good again.

Oh, this has nothing to do with the patch, but while reading (again) the "conventions for coding in SAGE" document, I noted that we explicitly deviate from the PEP-257 by saying : "if you are defining a class, you might put a long informative docstring after the class definition, not for the `__init__` method".
