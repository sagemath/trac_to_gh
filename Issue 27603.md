Keywords: polytopes, ppl

The following line throws a conversion error only with the (default) backend `ppl`:


```
sage: Q = Polyhedron(backend='ppl', vertices=[(1, 2, 3), (1, 3, 2), (2, 1, 3), (2, 3, 1), (3, 1, 2), (3, 2, 1)],rays=[[1,1,1]],lines=[[1,2,3]])
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: no conversion of this rational to integer
```


Replacing the backend by any other goes through without problems.

Interesting. Here the heuristic that guesses the parent and base ring goes wrong. If one passes `base_ring=QQ`, then one can see that PPL chooses a representation using a fractional "vertex".

What should be done? Set `base_ring=QQ` when there is rays or lines?

Do you have any idea why PPL prefers a presentation with vertices with non-trivial denominators?

I believe that when the polytope is a cone (namely with a unique vertex at 0) then everything should be fine. No? Don't we want `base_ring=ZZ` in this case?

Also, the constructor should be tested when the user enforces `base_ring=ZZ`.
