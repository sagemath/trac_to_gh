What happens is that GCC builds stage 2 with debug symbols, stage 3 without debug symbols. Then GCC checks that the code is identical using some tools from binutils. This checks are indeed broken on some systems.

The line in `spkg-install`

```
# Disable bootstrap-debug, since it doesn't work on an OS X 10.4 PPC
# machine, nor on some Solaris machine. bootstrap-debug only does
# additional checks during the build, so it is safe not to use it.
MAKE="$MAKE BUILD_CONFIG="

It seems that this line is the culprit in this case, somehow disabling bootstrap-debug (if this is still actually disabling it) is now breaking the build.

The object files from stage 2 and 3 have the same size for me. That is, before stripping the size is the same, after stripping the size is the same, but stripping reduces the size. They compare identical after stripping. The difference is not in something that is human-readable (at least not to me ;-)

Confirmed. I tried a few things but I completely missed that line. That takes my number 2 spot in the "configuration option that leads to a build of gcc to fail" [my number one spot can be summarised with "it fails in stage 1 when I change the installation prefix (yes I mean --prefix=...)"].

I am relieved that clang++ is enough to build gcc 4.8+.
