The following code crashes in Sage v7.2 with a ZeroDivisionError:

```
V = FreeModule(Zmod(3^10), 1)
v = V.gen(0)
x = v * v
x.valuation(3)
```
The variable x is just 1 (mod 3<sup>10</sup>), and if you just do ` Zmod(3^10)(1).valuation(3)` it returns 0 (as it should), but creating it via linear algebra in this way seems to somehow return a broken object. 

Oddly enough, only powers of 3 between 3<sup>10</sup> and 3<sup>19</sup> (inclusive) seem to raise this error -- larger or smaller powers work fine. Similarly powers of 2 between 2<sup>16</sup> and 2<sup>30</sup>, or powers of 5 between 5<sup>7</sup> and 5<sup>13</sup>. This strongly suggests there is an overflow error occurring somewhere when the modulus is too large for a 16-bit integer but large enough for a 32-bit.
