This needs to depend on #21441, otherwise the upgrade will not work.

I was able to install the upgrade, but it did not fix `%attach`. `%attach` does load the file (which makes it better than `%load`, which copies in the file), but it does not reload it upon changes.

True, fixing attach is not what this ticket is about.

Changing status from needs_review to positive_review.

I've updated the description to reflect what the upgrade does wrt %attach. As far as I can tell, everything still works as before.
