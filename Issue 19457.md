The method `CachedFunction.get_cache()` should be deprecated because

1. It is not needed: there already exists the `.cache` attribute.

2. The methods `set_cache()` and `get_cache()` sound like there are complimentary, but they are not: `set_cache()` sets a specific value while `get_cache()` returns the whole cache.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19694

Thanks for the review. Could you look at #19695 by chance?

I want to make further changes to cached functions, in particular optimize them. But I would like to do that on top of #19695.
