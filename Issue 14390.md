# Issue 14390: dot2tex not detected any longer

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14594

Original creator: aschilling

Original creation time: 2013-05-15 16:30:14

Assignee: sage-combinat

CC:  sage-combinat

Keywords: dot2tex

Since sage-5.10.beta2 there is a problem with the detection of dot2tex. Even with dot2tex installed  via

```
    sage -f http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/nthiery/dot2tex-2.8.7-2.spkg
```

it is not detected any longer:

```
    sage: import dot2tex
    ...
    ImportError: No module named pyparsing
```

This is crucial though since in combinatorics we heavily rely on being able to draw pictures:

```
    sage: B = CrystalOfTableaux(['A',2],shape=[1])
    sage: view(B)
    dot2tex not available.  Install after running 'sage -sh'
```

Some things I've tried:

- installing pyparsing on my system directly (on ubuntu)
- installing pyparsing 1.5.5 using `sage -sh` as:
  {{{
  easy_install http://cheeseshop.python.org/packages/source/p/pyparsing/pyparsing-1.5.5.tar.gz
  }}}
  I also tried `easy_install pyparsing` but that just returned an error (likely because of it being python 3).

I'm guessing we will need to make it a spkg?

Best,

Travis

PS - I haven't tried restarting my system after trying these, but I don't think anything will change. If it does work, I'll post, otherwise it didn't.

Changing priority from major to blocker.

Comment by tscrim created at 2013-05-17 19:15:27

I think this should be a blocker since none of the crystal pictures/latex work anymore.

MPL now ships with `pyparsing_py2` and `pyparsing_py3`, so apparently simply `dot2tex`'s import statement has to be changed.

FWIW, installing `dot2tex` with `SAGE_CHECK=yes` _does_ fail, and without just succeeds because of

```
.../sage-5.10.beta3/local/lib/python/distutils/dist.py:267: UserWarning: Unknown distribution option: 'install_requires'
  warnings.warn(msg)
running install
running build
running build_py
running build_scripts
running install_lib
...
```

i.e.,

```python
      install_requires = ['matplotlib.pyparsing'],
```

in (the patched) `setup.py` simply doesn't work.

Tentative fixed spkg:  http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/leif/Sage/spkgs/dot2tex-2.8.7-2.p1.spkg

Works for me, modulo not all tests passing (`SAGE_CHECK=yes`, but I've also changed `spkg-check` to fail on _any_ test suite error).

Since the original spkg doesn't conform to the usual conventions (naming, style of `SPKG.txt`, `src/` not in `.hgignore` and hence all upstream files under revision control as well), I haven't updated `SPKG.txt`, nor committed any changes.  (Diff is attached.)

New version of `patches/use-matplotlib-pyparsing.patch`.  For reference / review only (as the spkg diff looks pretty ugly).

Attachment

Hey Leif,

Thank you for fixing this. That works for me as well and all the tests in the `combinat/crystals` folder. I'll run all tests later tonight.

Thanks,

Travis

Just that the new (optional) dot2tex spkg works with both the old and the new matplotlib spkg (in Sage 5.10.beta0 and later), but see [comment:6 my note above], i.e., it's not yet ready to get "merged".

I'd also like to get some feedback w.r.t. `spkg-check`;  it now (IMHO correctly) returns an error if _any_ of the tests failed, while it previously only did if _the last_ failed.

Haven't investigated, but it seems at least some of the tests (`src/tests/test_*`) have prerequisites not commonly installed, and presumably not necessary for (typical) use with Sage.

It probably makes sense to exclude these by simply changing the pattern, or explicitly listing only those reasonable for Sage's purposes.

P.S.:  Just noticed there are _only four_ test files, so we may actually have to _modify_ some of them instead of simply excluding them.




Feel free to forward this to sage-combinat-devel ... :P

I had actually made a search in the new matplotlib, but looking for
pyparsing.py so I missed it ... Well, that's very good news! Thanks
so much for investigating and for working on the spkg!

Just checking: did you start from the latest spkg dot2tex-2.8.6.2 advertised on #7004 (see #13624)?
Otherwise we should merge the two spkgs.

By the way: what about using the occasion to make dot2tex a standard package? After all, it's very small, it's used quite extensively, and that would be a good step toward simplifying the installation instructions for graph drawing with graphviz.

+1

I haven't looked at them recently; is there anything beyond graphviz and latex's preview package?
Maybe the tkz-berge and friend style files?

For those, it would actually be good to ship them with the standard Sage installation, for they are tiny and required for tikz graph drawing without dot2tex, and yet a pain to install by hand. But that might be another ticket.

What do you think?

Both options are fine for me, with a small preference for the first
one which does not require touching the upstream sources.

Nope, at least I'm not sure; #7004 mentions some 2.8.7-dev spkg (ticket "merged" long time ago), but I took the one from the optional spkgs repository:

[http://sagemath.org/packages/optional/dot2tex-2.8.7-2.spkg](http://sagemath.org/packages/optional/dot2tex-2.8.7-2.spkg) (or probably the one with the same name mentioned in the ticket's description, I don't recall.)

(I wasn't aware of other pending(?) changes.)




> Otherwise we should merge the two spkgs.

Probably...  I just created a new clean one (named `dot2tex-2.8.7.p1.spkg`) from the above, which doesn't include my changes [except for `.hgignore`], where I removed all traces of upstream from the Mercurial history, and added tags for a `2.8.7.p0` and the `.p1`.  `src/` is (still) *vanilla* upstream version 2.8.7 (released "stable", no svn version).

I was going to add my changes (and some clean-up of `SPKG.txt`) into a `.p2` based on that `.p1`.

I can of course add further changes later on top of that, probably into a `.p3`, if you just tell me what these changes are ...  (Portions from upstream's devel version, which we could also add as patches, or just Sage-specific patches, changes to `spkg-{install,check}`?)




> By the way: what about using the occasion to make dot2tex a standard package? After all, it's very small, it's used quite extensively, and that would be a good step toward simplifying the installation instructions for graph drawing with graphviz.

I thought it was (or had to be) optional because of its MIT license, but IANAL.

Otherwise my new one with `src/` in `.hgignore` is only a fraction of the size of the previous one: :-D

```
3,1M	        dot2tex-2.8.7-2.spkg
944K        dot2tex-2.8.7.p1.spkg
```

It doesn't:

```sh
$ md5sum /home/nthiery/dot2tex-2.8.7-2.spkg /home/sagemath/www-files/packages/optional/dot2tex-2.8.7-2.spkg

But now I see there's also the newer

I'll take a look at that later ...

Changeset !#7 corresponds to the `dot2tex-2.8.7-2` spkg, so you mainly updated to some devel version, thereby removing a patch.

Yes indeed! The devel version also fixes the issue mentioned
in #14408. You can grab the latest version from:

	http://code.google.com/p/dot2tex/source/

Again, thanks so much for handling this! I'll be happy to review it.

After having installed `pdftk`, `spkg-check` still fails for me at least because of

```
IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'testgraphs/parsetests/current.dot'
IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'testgraphs/parsetests/ports.dot'
IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'testgraphs/parsetests/unicode1.dot'
```

which doesn't seem to be a regression ...  8-/

They're missing in the original 2.8.7-2 spkg as well as in upstream's 2.8.7 release tarball.  But perhaps _I'm_ just missing something...

Did anyone recently (or ever ;-) ) successfully install the spkg with `SAGE_CHECK=yes`?

I didn't find any traces of those three files in the svn nor the Mercurial repo.

So we could patch out the last three tests in `tests/test_comparedotparsing.py`:

```python
class DotparsingTest(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        if not os.path.exists(PNG_DIR):
            os.mkdir(PNG_DIR)
        if not os.path.exists(DOT_DIR):
            os.mkdir(DOT_DIR)

    def test_ids(self):
        self.assertEqual(test_dotfile("ids.dot"),1)
    def test_multilines(self):
        self.assertEqual(test_dotfile("multilines.dot"),1)
    def test_subgraphs(self):
        self.assertEqual(test_dotfile("subgraphs.dot"),1)
    def test_quoting(self):
        self.assertEqual(test_dotfile("quoting.dot"),1)
    def test_unicode1(self):
        self.assertEqual(test_dotfile("unicode1.dot"),1)
    def test_current(self):
        self.assertEqual(test_dotfile("current.dot"),1)
    def test_ports(self):
        self.assertEqual(test_dotfile("ports.dot"),1)
```

(Note that these tests are still present even in the latest versions; actually, the whole file hasn't changed at all since at least when the Mercurial repo was created.)

Or _someone<sup>TM</sup>_ would have to create the missing reference files...

Comment by leif created at 2013-05-21 01:10:54

Another dumb thing:

`tests/test_buildexamples.py` apparently fails just because the examples are built in the wrong order.

The generated `graphofgraphs.tex` includes a couple of PDFs built by other examples, but that fails in the first place.  (Rerunning it with the other temporary files in `tests/exrender/` still present works.) 

Besides that, `spkg-check` now succeeds for me (skipping the above-mentioned comparisons to non-existent reference files).

Comment by nthiery created at 2013-05-21 01:31:10

It's kind of you to be investigating those failing tests, but we don't need them. So I would say: just report upstream and skip them.

Thanks!

Doctesting the Sage library (5.10.beta3) with `sage -t --long --optional=dot2tex ...`, I get:

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------

```

Most of these presumably due to wrong tagging (`NameError: name 'foo' is not defined`).

With `--optional=dot2tex,sage` in contrast, only the following doctest error:

```

:-)




It seems there are no dot2tex-optional tests in the documentation (`*.rst`):

```
Doctesting 3 files.

    [0 tests, 0.03 s]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

But, ooops, just noticed they're tagged `# optional - dot2tex graphviz`...

Same problem without adding `sage` to the `--optional` list:

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage -t --long devel/sage/doc/en/thematic_tutorials/lie/affine_hw_crystals.rst  # 2 doctests failed

Leif, thanks for the report! Are you saying that the tags in the code are wrong? The view commands in the code make the pdf files, but they are supposed to show pictures (not just `sage.pdf`).

Best,

Anne

Rerunning the tests of the Sage library with `--optional=dot2tex,graphviz,sage` (i.e., this time also `graphviz`), I get _eleven_ pop-up windows.




> Leif, thanks for the report! Are you saying that the tags in the code are wrong?

IMHO yes.  Some tests marked optional depend on data that's not defined unless one also specifies `sage`.  I'm not entirely sure whether the _behaviour_ w.r.t. that changed with the new doctesting framework (in Sage 5.9 and later); the (syntax of the) options to `sage -t ...` did.




> The view commands in the code make the pdf files, but they are supposed to show pictures (not just `sage.pdf`).

Yes, I of course meant I get the generated PDFs shown (entitled `sage.pdf`), but that shouldn't happen when doctesting.

Replying to [comment:29 nthiery]:
> It's kind of you to be investigating those failing tests, but we don't need them. So I would say: just report upstream and skip them.

I've added two patches, one skipping comparisons to the three non-existing reference files, the other fixing the build order of the examples.

In case they're still needed with #14408 (at least the former most probably will be), we can submit them upstream, but I'm not going to do this right now.

Comment by tscrim created at 2013-05-21 04:50:15

Leif,

I know a few of the popup windows come from `view(a_crystal)` type commands (there might also be some `a_crystal.plot()`), but I thought `view()` was not suppose to display anything during doctests (I believe there is a ticket about this, but I can't find it...)

As for the optional tests, I believe some of them have tests which are run on the object, which doesn't require !`dot2tex`, and then the same object is also run through a `view()`.

To recap, currently we should (I suspect they might have been broken beforehand) fix optional doctests in the following files:

- `combinat/kleber_tree.py`
- `graphs/graph_latex.py`
- `combinat/posets/posets.py`

As well as (possibly) adding additional optional tags, and making sure the doctests don't show pdfs. Correct?

Thanks for your work on this,

Travis

Attachment

Just for the record, the [.p1 spkg](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/leif/Sage/spkgs/dot2tex-2.8.7.p1.spkg) is a remake of Nicolas' `dot2tex-2.8.7-2.spkg`, with all traces of upstream files removed from the Mercurial history (and `src/` now in `.hgignore`), and some tags added.

For the [new .p2 spkg](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/leif/Sage/spkgs/dot2tex-2.8.7.p2.spkg) with my fixes, based on the above-mentioned `.p1`, see the ticket's description; [attachment:dot2tex-2.8.7.p1-p2.diff diff for easier reviewing] also attached.  Please build, test, and report! ;-)

(Supposed to work with older Sage / matplotlib versions as well.)

Note that my review patch available at #13624 (trac_13624-review-sl.patch) is (1) adding one doctest and (2) fixing broken optional dot2tex doctests for the `graph_latex.py` and `generic_graph.py` files. Maybe the part (2) could be moved to this ticket?

I'd prefer to leave it there (or, more precisely, not to move it here), since it's unrelated to this ticket, which could get "merged" simply by putting the new spkg into the optional spkg repo.  (The fixed spkg doesn't change the output of `dot2tex` or any doctest; #14408 _might_.)

I have been through the diff's and am happy with them. I have installed the spkg and ran its test succesfully on 5.10.beta2 as well as 5.10.beta4 git style. Assuming all sage tests pass, feel free to set a positive review on my behalf.

I'd say no, that's for #14408.

As mentioned before, I thought its MIT license would prevent us from doing so (but IANAL).  Besides that, I don't think anybody would object (since it's much smaller now ;-) ), but it also *requires* graphviz, doesn't it?

According to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License, MIT is GPL
compatible, so that should not be an issue. I think it has not been
standard so far just because we never took the time to discuss and do
it.

Granted dot2tex is not so useful without graphviz (and graphviz is
supposed to have a GPL incompatible license; though we don't link to
it, well, IANAL either). I still think it would simplify our user's
life to have dot2tex standard, and only have to worry about installing
graphviz if not already preinstalled in the distro.

What do you think? Should I make a poll on sage-devel for making
dot2tex a standard spkg, either in this ticket or a later ticket?

Cheers,
                              Nicolas

We could ship it as a standard spkg, and only build / install it if its prerequisites (e.g. graphviz) are present.

Or install it regardless (although then certainly `spkg-check` would fail if not all necessary parts are available), but then IMHO Sage must not bail out in a bad way if the user tries to use it without having the other parts.  Don't know how much of an effort that would mean.

I personally don't care much...

I'd like this to also be a standard package.

However just running `sage -i` on the spkg, I get the following:

which was working with the p1 spkg. I presume I shouldn't have to do anything else to get it to work, but what else should I try/do? (I don't think installing the (experimental) graphviz would work, nor does it seem like the right solution...)

For the record, I just tried the above command (adding a call to view)
with Sage 5.10.beta4, and it worked for me (Ubuntu, with graphviz
provided by the distribution).

I assume graphviz is in Sage's path?

(I hope Sage did _not_ really exit...)

I don't fully understand what you did or tried to do;  installing Sage and the dot2tex spkg on a "virgin" system without dot2tex's prerequisites (and without `SAGE_CHECK=yes`)?

Also, the `.p1` would not work with Sage 5.10.* (because of matplotlib 1.2.x).

Seems like I somehow accidentally deleted my installation of graphviz. It works okay. Sorry for the white noise. (And no, sage did not actually exit.)

About making `dot2tex` standard: I see no point in this unless you also make `graphviz` standard, which cannot legally be done for license reasons. What would probably make more sense is combining `graphviz` and `dot2tex` in one optional package.

See my comments on sage-devel. History seems to tell that we do not really have the manpower to maintain a graphviz spkg, and anyway it probably does not really makes sense: it's as easy to install as an optional spkg or as an os package.

I just installed the p2 version on MacOS and it works great! Thank you.

There's a new preliminary spkg available for testing at #14408.  (dot2tex's test suite is more than likely to fail atm.)

Doctesting the Sage library with that may still make sense.

Since it seems like the question of making `dot2tex` a standard package is controversial and the changes currently fix the problem, what's left to do before setting this to positive review? Has anyone tried this on `5.9` or below? The spkg diff looks good to me and running:

However I do *not* have `pdftk` installed on my system. From comment:25 I'm guessing this is okay? I'll also try it with `pdftk` installed.

And anyway that would be for #14408.

I think we should not worry about this. This package will be updated
in the optional spkg for 5.10 and later; this has to be a different
repository from the optional spkg for earlier versions of Sage (or
not???).

No clue about the pdftk thing.

With `pdftk`, all tests pass:

```
sage -i -f -c http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/leif/Sage/spkgs/dot2tex-2.8.7.p2.spkg
...
dot2tex's test suite passed successfully.

Leif, is it okay for the tests not to pass without `pdftk`?

Okay.

Since this works (as before), with `pdftk` all the spkg tests pass, and it would be good to get this as the default `dot2tex` spkg before `5.10` is released, I'm setting this to positive review.

Changing status from needs_review to positive_review.

I just put the file on the server. I double checked it, 2.8.7.p2. in optional.

For fixing broken optional dot2tex doctests, see #14680.

For matplotlib >= 1.3.x (#14993, merged into Sage 6.2.beta5), we apparently have to adapt the spkg again, as MPL no longer ships with pyparsing (but Sage now ships it as a _separate_ package), so importing `matplotlib.pyparsing` fails.  (The installation of the optional dot2tex package still succeeds -- unless one also tries to run its test suite, but using dot2tex now more or less *silently* fails.  Quite odd.)

I just ran into that issue -- are there any solutions so far?

I just tried an ugly monkey fix which worked. First I did `sage -i pyparsing` and in my case that package was already installed.

Then, I edited the file `/Users/slabbe/Applications/sage-git/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/dot2tex/dotparsing.py` in the following way:


```diff
26,27c26,30
-     import matplotlib.pyparsing as pyparsing
-     # just raise if that failed, too
+     try:
+         import matplotlib.pyparsing as pyparsing
+     except ImportError:
+         import pyparsing
+         # just raise if that failed, too
36c39
-     ParseException, ParseResults, CharsNotIn, _noncomma, dblQuotedString, QuotedString, ParserElement,
+     ParseException, ParseResults, CharsNotIn, dblQuotedString, QuotedString, ParserElement,
```


Then, I tested this example:


```python
sage: G = DiGraph()
sage: G.add_edge(3333, 88, 'my_label')
sage: G.set_latex_options(format='dot2tex')
sage: view(G)
```


and it worked again.

Hi Christian,

Are you using the latest version of the package? See

http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16026

This works for me!

Anne

​I am using the latest development version 6.2.rc0​ and got the error there. But that patch is already merged there, isn't it?

But did you install

 ​http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/vbraun/upstream/dot2tex-20120520.tar.bz2

or the old version?

I guess the old version -- I just used `sage -i dot2tex` as I am supposed to do to install an optional package...

Anne, can you tell me how to install the new git version of dot2tex spkg? I tried:


```
$ sage -f http://www.sagemath.org/packages/upstream/dot2tex/dot2tex-20120520.tar.bz2
```


and I got:


```

Download the tar.bz2 file and put it in `sage/upstream`. Verify that the file `sage/build/pkgs/dot2tex/package-version.txt` contains "20120520". Then do `sage -f dot2tex`.

(I think that once Sage 6.2 becomes official, then the new tar.bz2 file will go to the mirrors and replace the old package.)

Did that. Here is my setup:


```
$ ls upstream/dot2tex*
upstream/dot2tex-2.8.7.p2.spkg
upstream/dot2tex-20120520.tar.bz2
$ ls build/pkgs/dot2tex/
package-version.txt
$ cat build/pkgs/dot2tex/package-version.txt 
20120520
```


But I also need the content of the checksum (where can I find it?):


```
$ sage -f dot2tex
sed: /Users/slabbe/Applications/sage-git/build/pkgs/dot2tex/checksums.ini: No such file or directory
Found local metadata for dot2tex-20120520
Attempting to download package dot2tex-20120520
>>> Trying to download http://www.sagemath.org/packages/upstream/dot2tex/
[.]
No checksum file: /Users/slabbe/Applications/sage-git/build/pkgs/dot2tex/checksums.ini
```


Also, why does it try to download it since it is in `upstream` directory?

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2014-05-02 14:50:57

Something is wrong with your branch. With the current develop branch, I see

```
$ ls build/pkgs/dot2tex/
SPKG.txt             package-version.txt  spkg-check*
checksums.ini        patches/             spkg-install*
$ cat build/pkgs/dot2tex/package-version.txt 
20120520
```

You're missing most of the files in `build/pkgs/dot2tex`.

(If you had a `checksums.ini` file which matched the file in `upstream`, it wouldn't download anything.)

The way to install a spkg does not seem to be clear. I suggest to move the discussion concerning the installation of an optional spkg on sage-devel. I start a new thread now.
