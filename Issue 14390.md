Assignee: sage-combinat

CC:  sage-combinat

Keywords: dot2tex

Since sage-5.10.beta2 there is a problem with the detection of dot2tex. Even with dot2tex installed  via

```
    sage -f http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/nthiery/dot2tex-2.8.7-2.spkg
```

it is not detected any longer:

```
    sage: import dot2tex
    ...
    ImportError: No module named pyparsing
```

This is crucial though since in combinatorics we heavily rely on being able to draw pictures:

```
    sage: B = CrystalOfTableaux(['A',2],shape=[1])
    sage: view(B)
    dot2tex not available.  Install after running 'sage -sh'
```

Some things I've tried:

- installing pyparsing on my system directly (on ubuntu)
- installing pyparsing 1.5.5 using `sage -sh` as:
  {{{
  easy_install http://cheeseshop.python.org/packages/source/p/pyparsing/pyparsing-1.5.5.tar.gz
  }}}
  I also tried `easy_install pyparsing` but that just returned an error (likely because of it being python 3).

I'm guessing we will need to make it a spkg?

Best,

Travis

PS - I haven't tried restarting my system after trying these, but I don't think anything will change. If it does work, I'll post, otherwise it didn't.

MPL now ships with `pyparsing_py2` and `pyparsing_py3`, so apparently simply `dot2tex`'s import statement has to be changed.

Just checking: did you start from the latest spkg dot2tex-2.8.6.2 advertised on #7004 (see #13624)?
Otherwise we should merge the two spkgs.

By the way: what about using the occasion to make dot2tex a standard package? After all, it's very small, it's used quite extensively, and that would be a good step toward simplifying the installation instructions for graph drawing with graphviz.

I haven't looked at them recently; is there anything beyond graphviz and latex's preview package?
Maybe the tkz-berge and friend style files?

For those, it would actually be good to ship them with the standard Sage installation, for they are tiny and required for tikz graph drawing without dot2tex, and yet a pain to install by hand. But that might be another ticket.

What do you think?

> P.S.:  Just noticed there are *only four* test files, so we may actually have to *modify* some of them instead of simply excluding them.

Both options are fine for me, with a small preference for the first
one which does not require touching the upstream sources.

Nope, at least I'm not sure; #7004 mentions some 2.8.7-dev spkg (ticket "merged" long time ago), but I took the one from the optional spkgs repository:

[http://sagemath.org/packages/optional/dot2tex-2.8.7-2.spkg](http://sagemath.org/packages/optional/dot2tex-2.8.7-2.spkg) (or probably the one with the same name mentioned in the ticket's description, I don't recall.)

(I wasn't aware of other pending(?) changes.)




> Otherwise we should merge the two spkgs.

Probably...  I just created a new clean one (named `dot2tex-2.8.7.p1.spkg`) from the above, which doesn't include my changes [except for `.hgignore`], where I removed all traces of upstream from the Mercurial history, and added tags for a `2.8.7.p0` and the `.p1`.  `src/` is (still) **vanilla** upstream version 2.8.7 (released "stable", no svn version).

I was going to add my changes (and some clean-up of `SPKG.txt`) into a `.p2` based on that `.p1`.

I can of course add further changes later on top of that, probably into a `.p3`, if you just tell me what these changes are ...  (Portions from upstream's devel version, which we could also add as patches, or just Sage-specific patches, changes to `spkg-{install,check}`?)




> By the way: what about using the occasion to make dot2tex a standard package? After all, it's very small, it's used quite extensively, and that would be a good step toward simplifying the installation instructions for graph drawing with graphviz.

I thought it was (or had to be) optional because of its MIT license, but IANAL.

Otherwise my new one with `src/` in `.hgignore` is only a fraction of the size of the previous one: :-D

Changeset !#7 corresponds to the `dot2tex-2.8.7-2` spkg, so you mainly updated to some devel version, thereby removing a patch.

Yes indeed! The devel version also fixes the issue mentioned
in #14408. You can grab the latest version from:

	http://code.google.com/p/dot2tex/source/

Again, thanks so much for handling this! I'll be happy to review it.

After having installed `pdftk`, `spkg-check` still fails for me at least because of

```
IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'testgraphs/parsetests/current.dot'
IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'testgraphs/parsetests/ports.dot'
IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'testgraphs/parsetests/unicode1.dot'
```

which doesn't seem to be a regression ...  8-/

They're missing in the original 2.8.7-2 spkg as well as in upstream's 2.8.7 release tarball.  But perhaps *I'm* just missing something...

Did anyone recently (or ever ;-) ) successfully install the spkg with `SAGE_CHECK=yes`?

I didn't find any traces of those three files in the svn nor the Mercurial repo.

So we could patch out the last three tests in `tests/test_comparedotparsing.py`:

```python
class DotparsingTest(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):

Another dumb thing:

The generated `graphofgraphs.tex` includes a couple of PDFs built by other examples, but that fails in the first place.  (Rerunning it with the other temporary files in `tests/exrender/` still present works.)

It seems there are no dot2tex-optional tests in the documentation (`*.rst`):

But, ooops, just noticed they're tagged `# optional - dot2tex graphviz`...

Same problem without adding `sage` to the `--optional` list:

Leif, thanks for the report! Are you saying that the tags in the code are wrong? The view commands in the code make the pdf files, but they are supposed to show pictures (not just `sage.pdf`).

Rerunning the tests of the Sage library with `--optional=dot2tex,graphviz,sage` (i.e., this time also `graphviz`), I get *eleven* pop-up windows.




> Leif, thanks for the report! Are you saying that the tags in the code are wrong?

IMHO yes.  Some tests marked optional depend on data that's not defined unless one also specifies `sage`.  I'm not entirely sure whether the *behaviour* w.r.t. that changed with the new doctesting framework (in Sage 5.9 and later); the (syntax of the) options to `sage -t ...` did.




> The view commands in the code make the pdf files, but they are supposed to show pictures (not just `sage.pdf`).

Yes, I of course meant I get the generated PDFs shown (entitled `sage.pdf`), but that shouldn't happen when doctesting.

I've added two patches, one skipping comparisons to the three non-existing reference files, the other fixing the build order of the examples.

In case they're still needed with #14408 (at least the former most probably will be), we can submit them upstream, but I'm not going to do this right now.

Leif,

I know a few of the popup windows come from `view(a_crystal)` type commands (there might also be some `a_crystal.plot()`), but I thought `view()` was not suppose to display anything during doctests (I believe there is a ticket about this, but I can't find it...)

As for the optional tests, I believe some of them have tests which are run on the object, which doesn't require !`dot2tex`, and then the same object is also run through a `view()`.

To recap, currently we should (I suspect they might have been broken beforehand) fix optional doctests in the following files:

- `combinat/kleber_tree.py`
- `graphs/graph_latex.py`
- `combinat/posets/posets.py`

As well as (possibly) adding additional optional tags, and making sure the doctests don't show pdfs. Correct?

Thanks for your work on this,

Travis

According to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License, MIT is GPL
compatible, so that should not be an issue. I think it has not been
standard so far just because we never took the time to discuss and do
it.

Granted dot2tex is not so useful without graphviz (and graphviz is
supposed to have a GPL incompatible license; though we don't link to
it, well, IANAL either). I still think it would simplify our user's
life to have dot2tex standard, and only have to worry about installing
graphviz if not already preinstalled in the distro.

What do you think? Should I make a poll on sage-devel for making
dot2tex a standard spkg, either in this ticket or a later ticket?

Yes, I think it would be a good idea to make it a standard package!

We could ship it as a standard spkg, and only build / install it if its prerequisites (e.g. graphviz) are present.

Or install it regardless (although then certainly `spkg-check` would fail if not all necessary parts are available), but then IMHO Sage must not bail out in a bad way if the user tries to use it without having the other parts.  Don't know how much of an effort that would mean.

I personally don't care much...

For the record, I just tried the above command (adding a call to view)
with Sage 5.10.beta4, and it worked for me (Ubuntu, with graphviz
provided by the distribution).

I assume graphviz is in Sage's path?

I don't fully understand what you did or tried to do;  installing Sage and the dot2tex spkg on a "virgin" system without dot2tex's prerequisites (and without `SAGE_CHECK=yes`)?

Also, the `.p1` would not work with Sage 5.10.* (because of matplotlib 1.2.x).

However I do **not** have `pdftk` installed on my system. From comment:25 I'm guessing this is okay? I'll also try it with `pdftk` installed.

I think we should not worry about this. This package will be updated
in the optional spkg for 5.10 and later; this has to be a different
repository from the optional spkg for earlier versions of Sage (or
not???).

No clue about the pdftk thing.

> I just ran into that issue -- are there any solutions so far?

I just tried an ugly monkey fix which worked. First I did `sage -i pyparsing` and in my case that package was already installed.

Then, I edited the file `/Users/slabbe/Applications/sage-git/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/dot2tex/dotparsing.py` in the following way:


```diff
26,27c26,30
-     import matplotlib.pyparsing as pyparsing
-     # just raise if that failed, too
+     try:
+         import matplotlib.pyparsing as pyparsing
+     except ImportError:
+         import pyparsing
+         # just raise if that failed, too
36c39
-     ParseException, ParseResults, CharsNotIn, _noncomma, dblQuotedString, QuotedString, ParserElement,
+     ParseException, ParseResults, CharsNotIn, dblQuotedString, QuotedString, ParserElement,
```


Then, I tested this example:


```python
sage: G = DiGraph()
sage: G.add_edge(3333, 88, 'my_label')
sage: G.set_latex_options(format='dot2tex')
sage: view(G)
```


and it worked again.

Hi Christian,

Download the tar.bz2 file and put it in `sage/upstream`. Verify that the file `sage/build/pkgs/dot2tex/package-version.txt` contains "20120520". Then do `sage -f dot2tex`.

(I think that once Sage 6.2 becomes official, then the new tar.bz2 file will go to the mirrors and replace the old package.)

Replying to [comment:71 jhpalmieri]:
> Download the tar.bz2 file and put it in `sage/upstream`. Verify that the file `sage/build/pkgs/dot2tex/package-version.txt` contains "20120520". Then do `sage -f dot2tex`.

Did that. Here is my setup:


```
$ ls upstream/dot2tex*
upstream/dot2tex-2.8.7.p2.spkg
upstream/dot2tex-20120520.tar.bz2
$ ls build/pkgs/dot2tex/
package-version.txt
$ cat build/pkgs/dot2tex/package-version.txt 
20120520
```


But I also need the content of the checksum (where can I find it?):


```
$ sage -f dot2tex
sed: /Users/slabbe/Applications/sage-git/build/pkgs/dot2tex/checksums.ini: No such file or directory
Found local metadata for dot2tex-20120520
Attempting to download package dot2tex-20120520
>>> Trying to download http://www.sagemath.org/packages/upstream/dot2tex/
[.]
No checksum file: /Users/slabbe/Applications/sage-git/build/pkgs/dot2tex/checksums.ini
```


Also, why does it try to download it since it is in `upstream` directory?

Something is wrong with your branch. With the current develop branch, I see

```
$ ls build/pkgs/dot2tex/
SPKG.txt             package-version.txt  spkg-check*
checksums.ini        patches/             spkg-install*
$ cat build/pkgs/dot2tex/package-version.txt 
20120520
```

You're missing most of the files in `build/pkgs/dot2tex`.

(If you had a `checksums.ini` file which matched the file in `upstream`, it wouldn't download anything.)

The way to install a spkg does not seem to be clear. I suggest to move the discussion concerning the installation of an optional spkg on sage-devel. I start a new thread now.
