I suggest to fix a default version of the C and C++ standard to compile the Sage library with.

The reason is that different C/C++ compiler come with different standards as default (older GCC defaults to C89 and C++98, newer GCC default to C11 and C++11 and I have no idea what Clang does). Explicitly adding a `-std=` flag will hide those differences.

I suggest to default to C99 and C++11 because those are the versions which are already explicitly listed in a few places. So choosing those versions would also reduce some clutter in `module_list.py`. And given that we can already use `-std=c99` and `-std=c++11`, we know that our compilers support that.

Let me try again. In one of the upgrade of `ntl` _I_ purposefully disabled a switch enabling C++11 because `ntl` consumers such as `eclib` and `singular` couldn't use it (as in they would fail to build if it was enabled). 

I suggest that stopping to prevent `ntl` from using C++11 construct is in scope for this ticket.

This ticket is only about the Sage library, in other words the Cython modules using those libraries. So are you talking about Cython modules or about the libraries themselves?

OK, I diagnosed this.

Linbox really needs GNU extensions, it compiles with `-std=gnu++11` but not with `-std=c++11`.

When building Linbox, it checks for C++11 support. With GCC 5.x, a flag is required to add C++11 support. By default, `configure` tries `-std=gnu++11` first. So, the `-std=gnu++11` flag is added to the `CXXFLAGS` of Linbox, which is propagated to the Sage library using the pkgconfig mechanism.

When building Linbox with GCC 6 or 7, the default is `-std=gnu++11` (or `-std=gnu++14` but that difference doesn't matter here). So Linbox doesn't add any `-std` flag to `CXXFLAGS`. Now this ticket sees that no `-std` flag is added, so it adds `-std=c++11` which breaks Linbox.

It is actually tricky to do because the m4 macros that looks for support for C99 and C++11/14 do not return  a flag. They return a new value for CC/CXX, the needed flag, if any,  is not easily accessible from the macro.

To make it even worse: Givaro (which is the real culprint here) uses `std=gnu++11` with gcc but switches to `std=c++11` when compiling with clang. This is due to a sequence of bugs as explained there:
https://github.com/linbox-team/givaro/issues/47

Surprinsingly, `--std=c++11` does not make the compilation fail with clang.
Therefore, one should be carefull not to "force" the `gnu++11` flag, although in the context of sage compilation, it may be a safe assumption that we are using gcc.

I take note that Givaro/FFLAS-FFPACK/LinBox should be more consistent in the c++11 flag that they expose in their .pc file. Since LinBox depends on FFLAS which depends on Givaro, I would preferably only state the c++11 flag in Givaro.
However, I was told [1] not to pollute the CFLAGS field in pkgconfig with anything else than preprocessor flags (-I and -D and -U).
