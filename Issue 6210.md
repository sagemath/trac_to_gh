A sentence in the docs for the property parameter should say something about possibly missing graphs, due to the reasons explained in the docs for the augment parameter.  See http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/e8516faf818a6fb7

Hello !!!

It's true that this part's tricky, but what about just saying after 

```
``property`` -- (default: ``lambda x: True``) any property to be tested on graphs before generation
```


Something like "The property must fill an inheritance property to work as intended. Please refer to the help of parameter ``augment``" ?

Otherwise the explanations are given twice and we're sure users will read them `:-)`
