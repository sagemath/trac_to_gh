`sage_getargspec` seems broken for functions with keyword-only arguments.

In #31307, the sphinx documentation for

```
@staticmethod
def random_element(m, n, bound=5, special_probability=0.2,
                   *, is_primal=True, **kwds):
```

is generated as

```
static random_element(m, n, bound, special_probability=5, is_primal=0.2, **kwds)
Construct a random InteractiveLPProblemStandardForm.
```

Without #26254, `inspect.signature` is not able to return signatures of Cython-defined functions -- so the plan to just replace all uses of `sage_getargspec` by `inspect.signature` cannot work.

Instead we should create a function `signature` in `sage.misc.sageinspect` that is compatible with `inspect.signature` and switch all uses of `sage_getargspec` to that.
