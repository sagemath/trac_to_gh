# Issue 21265: empty graph YET AGAIN, this time chrpoly

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: kcrisman

Original creation time: 2016-09-16 01:01:18

In 7.3.beta7:

```
sage: graphs.EmptyGraph().chromatic_polynomial()
------------------------------------------------------------------------
0   signals.so                          0x0000000103b01525 print_backtrace + 37
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* module has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off().
Python will now terminate.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
```


See [this ask.sagemath question](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/34831/chromatic-polynomial-of-empty-graph/) where however they just get an infinite loop?  Apparently #14528 is also related and perhaps its status is why this never got fixed.

Confirming this is still there on 7.4.beta4. Likely just needs a special case for the empty graph.
