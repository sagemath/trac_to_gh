What's the problem? If you don't want the warning:

```
sage: f(x) = function('exp', x)
sage: f(8)
exp(8)
```

Ah ok, I thought it was connected to #17547. But it's quite unclear from the warning what's amiss here.

Since you opened it and now understand it (seems related to #17447, in fact), you can feel free to do your own review in this limited case.  At least, that is my opinion; I don't know how others would react, but I have a fairly liberal interpretation of common Sage practice for that.
