what is the purpose of these tautological `def plot(self):` ? To support ` PLOT::` blocks in docstrings?

It is the way Nathann Cohen implemented the code in sphinx_plot (#17498), it works fine but some objects need a plot method to be invoked in sphinx_plot().

Could you add to docstrings of these two `plot()` functions something like `needed to support PLOT in doctrings` ?

Otherwise it's quite baffling to see...

Where exactly in the docs should one see these new figures?

I don't get any pictures in reference/plot3d/sage/plot/plot3d/parametric_plot3d.html
