# Issue 12462: detach list of files and also be able to detach relative filenames

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/12634

Original creator: ppurka

Original creation time: 2012-03-06 07:52:13

Assignee: jason

Keywords: detach

1. The `detach` method is only able to detach filenames with absolute paths whereas `attach` is able to take in relative paths

2. Secondly, the `detach` method could be made to accept lists so that all the attached files can be removed in one invocation:

```
detach(attached_files())
```

Two relevant tickets: #12671 and #12719. It is possible that after the IPython upgrade, this will/should be rewritten.

* It says `"To see a list of attached files, call attached_files()"`. Technically, `attached_files()` _is_ a list, so it doesn't make any sense to call it.  It would be technically correct  to write "To see a list of attached files, call the attached_files function" or "To see a list of attached files, type attached_files()."

* This violates Python idioms:

```
    if type(filename) in [list, tuple]:
```

It should be `if isinstance(filename, (list, tuple))`.

* Instead, you could do:

```
if isinstance(filename, basestring):
    filelist = [filename]
else:
    filelist = [str(x) for x in filename]
```

which would (a) work on any iterable (e.g., a generator expression), and (b) ensure that each entry in filelist is a string.

I think this should be orthogonal to the IPython upgrade, but we'll see.

Hi,

Sorry to nitpick again, but can you add a test that illustrates the error case, e.g., 

```
   sage: detach('nonexistent_file.sage')
   ... error
```


With that, we should be good to go!
