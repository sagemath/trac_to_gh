Its only needed if you ask matplotlib to do stuff with time zones, i.e. create axis date labels with timezones. Its not a build-time dependency.

> It's not a build-time dependency.

It is because `setuptools` make any dependency into a build-time dependency. After installing matplotlib, you see something like
