# Issue 18145: Installation Guide no longer lists g++, gfortran in prerequisites for Linux

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18382

Original creator: leif

Original creation time: 2015-05-08 12:31:02

For installation from source, the Installation Guide suggests

```
     sudo apt-get install binutils gcc make m4 perl tar
```

on Linux, which might work (building Sage's GCC), but with no mention that the above is not sufficient to build Sage _without its GCC_.

I'd simply add `g++` and `gfortran` there, or a second line including these with a remark that those are the packages one has to install if one doesn't want to build Sage's GCC (which I think is the usual case).

Not sure whether we should add `dpkg-dev` (cf. [System-specific requirements](http://sagemath.org/doc/installation/source.html#system-specific-requirements), for !Debian/Ubuntu and derivatives) there, too.

should we mention that the list of applications not to build gcc is necessary, but not always sufficient (your system gcc might be broken).

Replying to [comment:3 dimpase]:

Well, that's a rather unusual case (and I'm not aware of any distro where this would currently happen), and mentioned in the previous section [Fortran and compiler suites](http://sagemath.org/doc/installation/source.html#fortran-and-compiler-suites).  The (second) list of packages is sufficient in any case, whether Sage's GCC will get built or not.
