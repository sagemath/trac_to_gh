This ticket addresses several issues:

- when defining chain complex morphisms, we don't check the size of the defining matrices, and we should.

- the `__mul__` method multiplies the factors in the wrong order.

- it may be useful to have an `in_degree` method: `f.in_degree(5)` will return the matrix defining `f` in degree 5.

It looks like you also fixed a bug if there was a mismatch in the matrix dictionaries (which would result it a `KeyError` being thrown). Do you think you could also add a test for this? If this could never happen, then I'd revert back to directly calling `x._matrix_dictionary[i]`

Could you also make this doc tweak:

```diff
         """
-        The matrix representing this morphism in degree n
+        The matrix representing this morphism in degree `n`.
 
         INPUT:
 
-        - ``n`` - degree
+        - ``n`` -- degree
```


If you make those changes and the patchbot approves, then you can set this as a positive review on my behalf. Thanks.

Good idea. In fact, this led me to find another bug (in the "product" `self * x`, we need to check that `self._domain == x._codomain`, not `self._codomain == x._domain`).
