These should all import from `sage.sets.family`:

```
$ git grep sage[.]combinat[.]family
src/sage/algebras/iwahori_hecke_algebra.py:from sage.combinat.family import Family
src/sage/categories/modules_with_basis.py:            from sage.combinat.family import Family
src/sage/categories/modules_with_basis.py:                    from sage.combinat.family import Family
src/sage/combinat/chas/fsym.py:            from sage.combinat.family import Family
src/sage/combinat/fqsym.py:            from sage.combinat.family import Family
src/sage/combinat/root_system/type_E.py:from sage.combinat.family import Family
src/sage/combinat/root_system/type_F.py:from sage.combinat.family import Family
src/sage/combinat/root_system/weight_lattice_realizations.py:from sage.combinat.family import Family
src/sage/libs/coxeter3/coxeter_group.py:        from sage.combinat.family import Family
```
