# Issue 34326: polynomials over InfinityRing are broken

The condition `y^3 == Q.one()` in the code below evaluates to `False` while it should be `True`. If does result in `True` if `InfinityRing` is replaced with `ZZ` or `QQ`. So something is wrong with implementation of polynomials over `InfinityRing`.


```
R.<x> = InfinityRing[]
Q.<y> = R.quotient([x^3 - R.one()])
print( y^3 == Q.one() )
```
