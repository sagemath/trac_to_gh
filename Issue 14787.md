CC:  @burcin @fchapoton @paulmasson

For some reason Sage has spherical Hankel functions but not regular ones. This patch adds Hankel functions and makes spherical Hankel and Bessel functions symbolic, as well as adding arbitrary-precision numeric evaluation.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15024

[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bessel_function#Spherical_Bessel_functions:_jn.2C_yn) and [DLMF](http://dlmf.nist.gov/10.51) agree that the derivative formulas for the various spherical functions only apply if the index is an integer.  I'm not sure how this connects to [W|A](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=derivative+of+spherical+bessel+j)'s solution to that.

Also

```
sage: integrate(spherical_bessel_J(1,x)^2,(x,0,oo))
1/6*pi
sage: integrate(spherical_bessel_Y(1,x)^2,(x,0,oo))

```

is just too cool not to include.

This is very nicely put together and other than these comments mostly needs just pseudo-random testing that mpmath or whoever doesn't have any weird error spots.  'Needs work' for updating updating documentation, otherwise 'needs info' for the other points raised.

```

Random numeric testing of new Hankel functions is accurate. Both functions plot. Symbolics behave as expected.

Per #20496 we are now supposed to escape abbreviated first names in references. There are three instances in the current branch that don't do that. If you fix those then I think it's ready to go.

There are changes in here I was planning to make, so I'm glad I read your list of open symbolics tickets beforehand!

Thanks for the review. It's good to see again someone is interested in special functions. I am motivated in having at least the most known holonomic functions implemented symbolically (for experimental symbolics) but had stopped because very few tickets were reviewed.

Positive review after cosmetic changes but there is now a merge conflict with 7.3.beta7.

Do I need to review again after conflict is resolved? What's the protocol on this?

In principle I could have introduced any possible change with it, so yes. But it is easy to check this, either per eyeball by skimming the diff again, or automatically (I just tried this the first time ever):

```
git diff develop >diff1
git co 821c307        (the commit before the merge)
git diff 7.3.beta6 >diff2
diff -u diff2 diff1
```

The output of the last diff should not contain lines that start with `++/+-/-+/--`. This way I found I somehow introduced some `orig` files into the branch so I'll delete those files. But as introducing and removing these files create completely unnecessary data I'll upload a new branch with an improved merge commit.

Doctests pass and documentation builds. Numerics look good. A few problems resulting from the merge conflict resolution:

1) A line has been modified in `hypergeometric.py`. This modification appears to be inaccurate and has the wrong variable anyway. Please remove the condition `x>0` on `hypergeometric_U`.

2) The definition of the spherical Bessel function of the second kind has been left behind in `special.py` after the definition of spherical harmonics. This one needs to be deleted since it's already in `bessel.py`.

3) The evaluation of spherical harmonics has changed. I'm assuming this is because `meval` is gone, but please confirm. This change has no apparent problems.

4) There are doctests added to the complete elliptic integral which are outside this ticket. Since they pass I'm fine leaving them here, but let me know that they are included just to avoid an extra ticket.
