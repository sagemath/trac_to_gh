There are [some examples](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/thematic_tutorials/tutorial-programming-python.html#using-sage-types-the-srange-command) but often this is crowded out.  A new user might be proud to have discovered the dot notation for methods, and then get a nasty surprise, like

```
     for p in range(1,50) :
        if (p.is_prime()) :
           print p
```

from #1678.

Anyway, in various places this would be a good idea - especially various tutorials and intros to programming.
