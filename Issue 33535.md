Well it depends on a python package named psutils because it mimics that functionality, but the python package in question do not require the C package psutil.

https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil https://pypi.org/project/psutil/

So the plot twist is that we can really dump the old "psutil" package in favor of something designed to be more cross platform from the start.

Hm? No, it's the same Python package that was dumped in #32656 but is now needed again for ipykernel.

Well, I know when I'm beaten. It looks like ipykernel is making the same mistakes that sage did; (a) reckless introduction of dependencies to obtain (b) meaningless memory metrics.

I don't have the energy to fight it, I'm going outside.

After some fresh air, we can try to get a simple patch into `psutil` that minimally supports Cygwin by just returning a meaningless positive constant.

(The last attempt to get Cygwin support into `psutil` was trying to get a highly intrusive megapatch in.)

but the upstream (Jupyter & Co) don't even try to support Cygwin.

I think it's OK to make ipython and jupyter optional. After all, although I'm not 100% sure, it ought to be possible to use a native Windows Jupyter to connect to the cygwin Sage jupyter kernel.
