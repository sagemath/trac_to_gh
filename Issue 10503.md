# Issue 10503: Add button to Mac App to add sage executable to PATH

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/10556

Original creator: iandrus

Original creation time: 2011-01-04 14:56:55

Assignee: iandrus

Keywords: mac app

Since the Mac application comes with a sage executable which is not readily accessible, there should be an easy way to add it to PATH.

I added a button to Preferences which allows the user to create a symlink in ~/bin or /usr/local/bin and explains briefly how to do that for users of bash.  I have attached a screenshot so that feedback can be given without having to install and build it.

Does this depend on #10555 and #8473?  Just checking.

I may be able to test and check this all still works on 10.4 PPC next week.

It doesn't depend on #10555, but it does rely on 8473 (because of nib changes), so we should probably say (for the patchbot):

Depends on #8473

Exactly why is this 'needs work' and not 'needs review'?

Because I think it should prompt on startup to add to `PATH`, provided of course that `sage` isn't already in `PATH`.  And of course there would also be a "Do not ask again" button.  I haven't gotten around to this yet, so if you think it's a bad idea then you can go ahead and review this.

I think that could be another ticket.  Especially since this will confuse people who don't know what a `PATH` is.

By the way, I use .profile to add things to the path.   Just sayin'.

That's part of why I haven't gotten to it yet.  I'm not sure how to clearly ask the question.  You're probably right that it's better to split this into a new ticket.  I was planning to do it, but it's harder than I thought (not technically, but design-wise).

Good point.  Yet another thing to confuse them with :-)

#8473 is solved, see  the [sagenb upstream pull request](https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/pull/31).

Putting this to "needs info" because I don't know whether this patch will be compatible with the new notebook.


---

Comment by iandrus created at 2012-06-14 20:17:18

This only depends on #11026, because it changes the interface, which is essentially a binary file.  So there should be no problems with compatibility with the notebook.

Status:  I like this.  But I couldn't get it to work with the `~/bin` version.  Even after moving my .profile (confirmed in effect) and then creating the .bashrc with only the requested line, it didn't work.  Yes, I closed the terminal and opened a new one.  

Now, the soft link works, because `./bin/sage` works.  And the /usr/local/bin version works great.  So this is almost ready.  In some sense, it IS ready - when I change my .profile to include the requested line, it works!  

So I'd just say to change your advice.  See [this apple.stackexchange question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/12993/why-doesnt-bashrc-run-automatically).

```	
By default, Terminal starts the shell via /usr/bin/login, which makes the shell a login shell.
On every platform (not just Mac OS X) bash does not use .bashrc for login shells
(only /etc/profile and the first of .bash_profile, .bash_login, .profile that exists and is readable). 
This is why “put source ~/.bashrc in your .bash_profile” is standard advice. –
```


Otherwise this is fine, modulo whatever problems in #11026 that would cause this to need rebasing if that were changed.

In `sage/ext/mac-app/PreferencePanelController.m`, should `mkdir ~/bin` be replaced by `mkdir -p ~/bin`?

I can confirm that the directory is in fact created.  And what intermediate directories would there be?  The permissions seem right too...

```
drwxr-xr-x   3 k...crisman  staff     102 Jul  5 22:47 bin
```

and similarly for `bin/sage`.

So let me be clear that the thing created works; it just doesn't work when you put it in .bashrc unless you go to some trouble, because Mac doesn't seem to respect that very much.

My suggestion was really in case the directory already existed, you don't want an error, you want to continue with the rest of the command.  And I agree with using `.profile` instead of `.bashrc`.


---

Comment by kcrisman created at 2012-07-06 11:09:58

Ok, that seems like a good point.  That should be the case for the `rm` commands as well, though even though there was nothing to remove the commands still worked, but they did raise the message.  Maybe `rm` is different in that regard.


---

Comment by iandrus created at 2012-07-12 13:54:00

I have implemented the suggestions which were all good.  Since I make all my changes to `~/.bashrc` which is included by my `~/.profile`, I always forget that `~/.profile` is the one that's actually used.  Thanks.

Okay, this works fine now, in all situations discussed above.

I'm wondering whether you might want to add a comment in the scripts patch about how to REMOVE this from one's path.  Just wondering.

Finally, is there a whole bunch of commented code in this?  The stuff about spotlight and 10.5 versus 10.6, etc., all inside `/* stuff */`?  Should that be removed, or at least should it be pointed out that this is a comment?

I haven't tested this on anything but Snow Leopard.  Probably we should (and it would be easy to do when #11026 is) but I seriously doubt there would be problems, since the main thing is the Unix command.

That's a good idea.  I've added a patch.

This was a different approach that I decided not to go with.  I thought the code might be useful, but you're right it shouldn't be there.

I asked it to create a link in ~/bin.  It did.

This broke building the Sage app on 10.4 PPC at least.

```
- (void)alertDidEnd:(NSAlert *)alert returnCode:(NSInteger)returnCode contextInfo:(void *)contextInfo { 
```
