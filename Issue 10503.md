I added a button to Preferences which allows the user to create a symlink in ~/bin or /usr/local/bin and explains briefly how to do that for users of bash.  I have attached a screenshot so that feedback can be given without having to install and build it.

Because I think it should prompt on startup to add to `PATH`, provided of course that `sage` isn't already in `PATH`.  And of course there would also be a "Do not ask again" button.  I haven't gotten around to this yet, so if you think it's a bad idea then you can go ahead and review this.

Status:  I like this.  But I couldn't get it to work with the `~/bin` version.  Even after moving my .profile (confirmed in effect) and then creating the .bashrc with only the requested line, it didn't work.  Yes, I closed the terminal and opened a new one.  

Now, the soft link works, because `./bin/sage` works.  And the /usr/local/bin version works great.  So this is almost ready.  In some sense, it IS ready - when I change my .profile to include the requested line, it works!  

So I'd just say to change your advice.  See [this apple.stackexchange question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/12993/why-doesnt-bashrc-run-automatically).

```	
By default, Terminal starts the shell via /usr/bin/login, which makes the shell a login shell.
On every platform (not just Mac OS X) bash does not use .bashrc for login shells
(only /etc/profile and the first of .bash_profile, .bash_login, .profile that exists and is readable). 
This is why “put source ~/.bashrc in your .bash_profile” is standard advice. –
```


Otherwise this is fine, modulo whatever problems in #11026 that would cause this to need rebasing if that were changed.

and similarly for `bin/sage`.

So let me be clear that the thing created works; it just doesn't work when you put it in .bashrc unless you go to some trouble, because Mac doesn't seem to respect that very much.

Okay, this works fine now, in all situations discussed above.

I'm wondering whether you might want to add a comment in the scripts patch about how to REMOVE this from one's path.  Just wondering.

Finally, is there a whole bunch of commented code in this?  The stuff about spotlight and 10.5 versus 10.6, etc., all inside `/* stuff */`?  Should that be removed, or at least should it be pointed out that this is a comment?

I haven't tested this on anything but Snow Leopard.  Probably we should (and it would be easy to do when #11026 is) but I seriously doubt there would be problems, since the main thing is the Unix command.

That's a good idea.  I've added a patch.

This was a different approach that I decided not to go with.  I thought the code might be useful, but you're right it shouldn't be there.
