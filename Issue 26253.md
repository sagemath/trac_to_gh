As reported on [this ask question](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/43946/desolve-initial-condition-involving-e-gives-strange-answer/):


```
var('t') 
y = function('y')(t)
de1 = t^3*diff(y, t) + 4*t^2*y == e^(t^2)
desolve(de1, y, ics = [1,e])
```


leads to


```
1/2*(e^(t^2) + y(t))/t^4
```


Which is incorrect. The correct answer is:


```
1/2*(e + e^(t^2))/t^4
```


which can be obtained when replacing the symbolic constant `e` with the wymbolic expression `e*1` in the initial conditions:


```
desolve(de1, y, ics = [1,e*1])
```


Note that we have:


```
sage: type(e)
<type 'sage.symbolic.constants_c.E'>
sage: type(e*1)
<type 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression'>
```


so perhaps, symbolic constants are not properly passed to maxima.

not really helpful, I guess, but

```
sage: desolve(de1, y, ics = [1,e], algorithm="fricas")
1/2*(e + e^(t^2))/t^4
```

works...
