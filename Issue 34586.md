```
 def is_GapElement(x):
     """
+    Deprecated function
+
+    Use isinstance(x,GapElement)
+
     Returns True if x is a GapElement.
 
     EXAMPLES::
 
         sage: from sage.interfaces.gap import is_GapElement
         sage: is_GapElement(gap(2))
+        doctest:...: DeprecationWarning: The function is_GapElement is deprecated. Use isinstance(x, GapElement) instead
+        See https://trac.sagemath.org/34823 for details.
```


This needs better rst markup. Also, I think the message should point to sage.interfaces.abc specifically
