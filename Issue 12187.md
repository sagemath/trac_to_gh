The default hnf for integral matrices uses a heuristic choice of pivots and loops until it found working pivots. But a subroutine in the loop can call hnf again, which soon leads to `RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded`. The actual loop is

```
  File "/home/vbraun/opt/sage-5.0.beta1/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/matrix/matrix_integer_dense_hnf.py", line 1006, in hnf
    H, pivots = probable_hnf(A, include_zero_rows = include_zero_rows, proof=True)
  File "/home/vbraun/opt/sage-5.0.beta1/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/matrix/matrix_integer_dense_hnf.py", line 838, in probable_hnf
    H = hnf_square(C, proof=proof)
  File "/home/vbraun/opt/sage-5.0.beta1/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/matrix/matrix_integer_dense_hnf.py", line 574, in hnf_square
    x = add_column(W, H, b.stack(matrix(1,1,[k*A[m-2,m-1] + l*A[m-1,m-1]])), proof)
  File "/home/vbraun/opt/sage-5.0.beta1/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/matrix/matrix_integer_dense_hnf.py", line 413, in add_column
    return add_column_fallback(B, a, proof)
  File "/home/vbraun/opt/sage-5.0.beta1/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/matrix/matrix_integer_dense_hnf.py", line 292, in add_column_fallback
    H, _ = hnf(W, proof)
  File "/home/vbraun/opt/sage-5.0.beta1/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/matrix/matrix_integer_dense_hnf.py", line 1006, in hnf
    H, pivots = probable_hnf(A, include_zero_rows = include_zero_rows, proof=True)
```

Attached is a Sage script that constructs a particular 391x391 matrix that exhibits this problem. Computing the hnf with `algorithm='pari'` gives the result in seconds, but by default the echelon form crashes with the above `RuntimeError` after a much longer wait.

This ticket should probably closed, as the pathway through the code taken by this example (and similar others) no longer occurs: instead, this matrix simply goes back into pari, and then hangs due to pari's choice of algorithm. Correct functionality should be mostly included in the fix to ticket #19081
