Keywords: finite_state_machine

Provide methods
`sage.combinat.finite_state_machine.FSMState.__lt__`
and 
`sage.combinat.finite_state_machine.FSMTransition.__lt__`
in order to have default ordering. For instance, this helps enforcing a unique output in
doctests.

I am preparing a patch and will push it in a few days.
