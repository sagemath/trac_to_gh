# Issue 15612: Default ordering of States and Transitions in FiniteStateMachine

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: cheuberg

Original creation time: 2014-02-23 14:10:38

Keywords: finite_state_machine

Provide methods
`sage.combinat.finite_state_machine.FSMState.__lt__`
and 
`sage.combinat.finite_state_machine.FSMTransition.__lt__`
in order to have default ordering. For instance, this helps enforcing a unique output in
doctests.

I am preparing a patch and will push it in a few days.
