If that's all I forgot that's not a bad score. This particular one was different in sage-on-gentoo because I don't ship this database separately from `gap` like it is done in sage so it doesn't need testing.
I'll still need to patch that one one way or another because the path will be different on gentoo. Alternative proposal welcome.

It seems we are working on the same issue ;)
#20382 does essentially the same, maybe you want to have a look.
