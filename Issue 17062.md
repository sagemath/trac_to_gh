I almost just got in trouble doing some research due to the following rather serious bug in modular symbols:


```
/scratch/wstein/sage-6.4.rc1$ ./sage

│ Type "help()" for help.                                            │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────sage: x = EllipticCurve('64a1').modular_symbol_space(sign=1).basis()[0]

{-1/3, -1/4} - {1/5, 1/4}
sage: latex(x.modular_symbol_rep())
\left\{\frac{-1}{3}, \frac{-1}{4}\right\}
```


Notice that the latex representation completely omits the second summand.  I was using show(x) to typeset output nicely, and getting massively misled.

This is really a bug in latex printing, not modular symbols, hence very, very critical.  I think it will produce mathematically incorrect results in a lot of situations, potentially.  So raising the priority to critical.  

Hao's patch as I write this isn't correct, but I've emailed him about what to do.

This bug is my fault: I introduced it in 2009.
