# Issue 17062: nasty bug in modular symbols, which is likely very easy to fix.

Issue created by migration from Trac.

I almost just got in trouble doing some research due to the following rather serious bug in modular symbols:


```
/scratch/wstein/sage-6.4.rc1$ ./sage
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Sage Version 6.4.rc1, Release Date: 2014-11-01                     │
│ Type "notebook()" for the browser-based notebook interface.        │
│ Type "help()" for help.                                            │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────sage: x = EllipticCurve('64a1').modular_symbol_space(sign=1).basis()[0]
sage: x.modular_symbol_rep()
{-1/3, -1/4} - {1/5, 1/4}
sage: latex(x.modular_symbol_rep())
\left\{\frac{-1}{3}, \frac{-1}{4}\right\}
```


Notice that the latex representation completely omits the second summand.  I was using show(x) to typeset output nicely, and getting massively misled.

Changing priority from major to critical.

This is really a bug in latex printing, not modular symbols, hence very, very critical.  I think it will produce mathematically incorrect results in a lot of situations, potentially.  So raising the priority to critical.  

Hao's patch as I write this isn't correct, but I've emailed him about what to do.

This bug is my fault: I introduced it in 2009.

Something like this seems to work.


```diff
--- a/src/sage/misc/latex.py
+++ b/src/sage/misc/latex.py
`@``@` -2349,6 +2349,8 `@``@` def repr_lincomb(symbols, coeffs):
                     s += " + %s"%b
             else:
                 coeff = coeff_repr(c)
+                if coeff == "-1":
+                    coeff = "-"
                 if first:
                     coeff = str(coeff)
                 else:
`@``@` -2359,6 +2361,8 `@``@` def repr_lincomb(symbols, coeffs):
                 try:

                 except Exception:

             first = False
```

Is this ready for review? It looks like a complete solution to me. If so, please set the "status" to "needs_review" (and enter an author name).

Replace `trac ticket 17299(latex representation of modular symbols)` by `:trac:`17299``.

Looks good to me. The patchbot is green, and this ticket has been waiting for too long.

As I made only cosmetic formatting of code, I allow myself to put this to positive review.
