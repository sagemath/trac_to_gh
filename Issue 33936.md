Keywords: vector_bundles

Currently, the method `total_space` of a vector bundle does not contain any topological information. Moreover, the dimensions do not match:


```
sage: M = Manifold(3, 'M')
sage: E = M.vector_bundle(2, 'E')
sage: E.total_space()
6-dimensional differentiable manifold E
```


This ticket attempts to fix this.
