Right now `sage -startuptime` reports startup time including children. This isn't particularly useful since that just means that the first module (which loads most of sage as dependencies) is the slowest. The more meaningful number is exclusive children, which can tell us if the module does computations during initialization.

Two questions:

- would it be useful to be able to sort by times including children (keeping the default as is) by specifying a command-line argument? (I don't know the answer to this one.)

- should the usage `sage --startuptime [modulename]` be documented in `sage --advanced` and in `devel/sage/doc/en/reference/options.rst`? (I think the answer to this one is "yes". See the attached referee patches.)
