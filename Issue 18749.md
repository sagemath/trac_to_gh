Three methods that we miss. One of them seems to be useful for #18972.

I have been trying to find a way for those methods to tell you at the same time if a hypergraph is `k` uniform, and the value of `k`. There is an unfortunate corner-case, but I still think that it is the best way to implement it.

How would I use `complement` in #1897 ? I need it to be called with `uniform=True`. How does one write this:

```
def complement(): # not actual code
    return self.???inherited???.complement(uniform=True)
```


thanks,
Dima

Oh, I see, it must be `super(TwoGraph,self)`. Then it works, OK, question answered, sorry for noise.
