Assignee: @williamstein

CC:  @malb

Keywords: unpickle libsingular unique parents

First session:

```
sage: P.<foo,bar> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: save(P,'tmp')
```


Second session:

```
sage: Q = load('tmp.sobj')
sage: P.<foo,bar> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: Q is P
False
sage: Q2 = load('tmp.sobj')
sage: Q2 is P
True
sage: Q2 is Q
False
```


That is fixed with the attached patch.

Remark: I consider it a feature of my patch that old pickles of polynomial rings will automatically be transformed into a new format, should Sage ever drop libsingular.

Please fix this comment, I believe it contains at least three mistakes :-)

```
# If future Sage versions remove libsingular by a different implementation,
# the unpickled ring will be long the the new implementation.
