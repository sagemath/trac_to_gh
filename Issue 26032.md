Keywords: rational matrix

There are special `LeanMatrices` for matroids for `GF(k)` with `k = 2,3,4` and for matrices with entires `+-1` and `0`. However, `QQ` is a common realization field for matroids, so we should implement a custom subclass of `LeanMatrix` for working over `QQ` that directly manipulates an array of mpq values. This way Cython can optimize these code paths rather than falling back on the generic implementation.

Okay, things seem to work now. I also fixed a bug with `IntegerMatrix.resize`.

Here is my test case:

```
sage: W = WeylGroup(['F',4], prefix='s')
sage: def test(W):
....:     d = {}
....:     for w in W:
....:         I = w.inversion_arrangement()
....:         M = I.matroid()
....:         c = M.chordality()
....:         if c in d:
....:             d[c].append(w)
....:         else:
....:             d[c] = [w]
....:     return d
sage: %time d = test(W)
CPU times: user 19.4 s, sys: 12 ms, total: 19.4 s
Wall time: 19.4 s
```
vs before

```
sage: %time d = test(W)
CPU times: user 40.1 s, sys: 8 ms, total: 40.1 s
Wall time: 40.1 s
```

Perhaps Jeroen has some extra tricks for getting some more speed out, but I am happy with a ~2x speedup.
