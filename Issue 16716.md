Hello,

Some quick comments (I will not be able to check most of the mathematical contents of the code).

Some cached method are really not needed. The multiplicative generator of finite field is already cached. So you could remove the `FiniteFieldPointEnumerator.multiplicative_generator`. And the multiplicative order of the multiplicative generator is `q-1` (where `q` is the cardinality of the field), isn't it?

Instead of using `CartesianProduct`, use `itertools.product` (actually this is indirectely used). `CartesianProduct` is about to disappear.

If you want to copy a list, the fastest is by far `zero[:]` and not `copy(zero)`.

```
sage: timeit("copy(zero)")
625 loops, best of 3: 2.59 µs per loop
sage: timeit("zero[:]")
625 loops, best of 3: 248 ns per loop
```


The fastest way for zero test is `X.is_zero()` and not `X == 0`. The latter might involves coercion.

```
sage: K = GF(53**3, 'a')
sage: b = K('a')+3*K('a')**2+12
sage: timeit("b == 0")
625 loops, best of 3: 2.17 µs per loop
sage: timeit("b.is_zero()")
625 loops, best of 3: 317 ns per loop
```


Vincent

PS: the hook for modifying the category code was very funny! Hopefully I erase the `Sets.ParentMethods.cardinality` before this ticket gets in ;-)

Really? what about #18411? Citation:

```
sage.combinat.cartesian_product.CartesianProduct is deprecated.
```


And these were not my only remarks...

I don't see how mixing up function bodies with import statements is ever going to yield a viable argument. In any case, I stand by my opinion that `copy(zero)` is much more readable that `zero[:]`.

> Really? what about #18411? 

There is no code on that ticket, and even if there were it depends on unfinished tickets. Its also unclear to me if it is ever going to be merged as some people have previously expressed a strong opinion on sage-devel for something that is named after cartesian product instead of `itertools.product`. In any case, this ticket long predates #18411 and is ready to be merged right now.

Its also unclear to me if it is ever going to be merged as some people have previously expressed a strong opinion on sage-devel for something that is named after cartesian product instead of `itertools.product`. In any case, this ticket long predates #18411 and is ready to be merged right now.

Then there is `cartesian_product_iterator`.

What about all your useless `cached_method`?

What annoys me is that you add 20 lines of code + documentation + a non documented function for something which can be replaced by `self.ring.cardinality() - 1` and `self.ring.multiplicative_generator()` for which the names are not at all mysterious.

> And I'm using the general pattern of caching frequently-accessed methods, an extra `cached_method` has no performance impact but a forgotten `cached_method` can be very bad.

`cached_method` can also have **negative** impact on performances (for not that frequently-accessed methods). Creating dictionaries is costly, object creation is costly, function call is costly.

> Also, why should you have to read the finite fields implementation just to decide whether to cache something in this module?

Hopefully I did it for you. It is clear that `multiplicative_generator` is something critical in many application and it looks natural to cache this method at the level of finite fields. And as a finite field is mostly defined by its cardinality, you can expect the method `cardinality` to be fast.

Let me copy&paste what I sad before: Its true that you can replace the multiplicative order with q-1 everywhere, but it is not true that q-1 in a formula always refers to the order

> `cached_method` can also have **negative** impact on performances (for not that frequently-accessed methods). Creating dictionaries is costly, object creation is costly, function call is costly.

Benchmark or it is simply not true. There is no point in wasting effort on O(1) things. In fact it saves the `.ring` dictionary lookup but I didn't want to point that out since I consider that a stupid argument.

You are missing the point, it is for the benefit of somebody reading the code in the future.
