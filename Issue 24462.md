1. Due to the recent changes in the GCC configure logic, several patchbots have upgraded to GCC-7.2.0.  This reveals trouble with coxeter3:

```
[sagelib-8.2.beta5] [  4/174] gcc -fno-strict-aliasing -g -O2 -DNDEBUG -g -fwrapv -O3 -Wall -Wno-unused -fPIC -I./sage/cpython -I/home/patchbot/sage-patchbot/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/cysignals -I./sage/libs/ntl -I/home/patchbot/sage-patchbot/local/include -I/home/patchbot/sage-patchbot/local/include/python2.7 -I/home/patchbot/sage-patchbot/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/numpy/core/include -I/home/patchbot/sage-patchbot/src -I/home/patchbot/sage-patchbot/src/sage/ext -Ibuild/cythonized -I/home/patchbot/sage-patchbot/local/include/python2.7 -c build/cythonized/sage/modules/vector_rational_dense.c -o build/temp.linux-i686-2.7/build/cythonized/sage/modules/vector_rational_dense.o -fno-strict-aliasing -DCYTHON_CLINE_IN_TRACEBACK=1 -std=c99
[sagelib-8.2.beta5] In file included from ../local/include/coxeter/coxgroup.h:67:0,
[sagelib-8.2.beta5]                  from build/cythonized/sage/libs/coxeter3/coxeter.cpp:599:
[sagelib-8.2.beta5] ../local/include/coxeter/files.h:113:8: error: redeclaration of 'template<class H> void files::printHeckeElt(FILE*, const H&, const schubert::SchubertContext&, const interface::Interface&, files::OutputTraits&, const Length&)' may not have default arguments [-fpermissive]

```


2. It gives doctest failures on ppc64le

3. According to #24361, it doesn't pass its own testsuite.

Unless somebody wants to fix it, it should be downgraded to experimental.

I will try to fix this ASAP, but I may not know when that will be. It would be helpful to have access to a machine that can reproduce the failures.

I diagnosed issue 2: it's because something is assuming that `char` == `signed char` and this is not the case on ppc64le (and on ARM neither): `char` is unsigned.

Compiling coxeter3 with `-fsigned-char` fixes the problem. Ideally, the source code should be fixed by replacing `char -> signed char` where needed but in the worst case, we can just compile with `-fsigned-char`.
