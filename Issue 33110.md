```
HTML pages of our documentation that contain maths only in TOC trees do not render maths by MathJax because Sphinx does not include MathJax javascript files as the Sphinx MathJax extension does not recognize maths in TOC trees and to save loading time. See for instance,

  https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/schemes/index.html

There could be several solutions in the order of preference:

1. Fix in the upstream Sphinx MathJax extension. A relevant discussion is

   https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/10192

2. Add dummy :math:... to every inflicted pages to enable MathJax.

3. Enable MathJax by brute force by adding line
   {{{#!python
   html_js_files = ['MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS_HTML-full', 
   'mathjax_sage.js']
   }}} 
   for `conf` files. But this results in duplicate MathJax inclusion 
   in the generated html file.

A good solution would be implemented in this ticket.

+1.

Good main title "p-adic analysis" there,
subsection title "P-adic quantum mechanics" needs work:

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-adic_analysis#P-adic_quantum_mechanics

though the main title "p-adic_quantum_mechanics"
at the dedicated page for it is good:

One easy-to-fix doctest failure, otherwise looks good to me.

For a future ticket: if we can think of a way to solve it, changing the html title of the web page to not use math would be nice. As it is, the title bar in my browser says `Ring \(\ZZ/n\ZZ\) of integers modulo \(n\) — Finite Rings`. Is there a handy way to autoconvert the title?

Simply removing `\(`, `\)` pairs, backslashes, (and `$` perhaps) would be enough. This could be done on the fly by javascript...
