Assignee: jason, was

CC:  mhampton @novoselt

The attached patch allows you to do this:

```
sage: a = animate(a = animate([sin(x + float(k)) for k in srange(0,2*pi,0.7)])
sage: a.ffmpeg('output.mpg')
```

or

```
sage: a.ffmpeg('output.avi')
```

Also, calling

```
sage: a.save('output.mpg')  # or a.save('output.avi')
```

for example will work, calling the ffmpeg method.  If ffmpeg is installed, it is also used to construct animated gifs, since it's faster than convert.

There was some discussion of this here: [https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-support/TdQ29S32K9k/discussion](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-support/TdQ29S32K9k/discussion).

This also clean up some doctest flags, using `# optional -- ImageMagick` and `# optional -- ffmpeg` to mark the appropriate tests.  For me, tests pass with each of the following combinations, and there are no stray graphics files created:

```
sage -t -long -optional animate.py    (with convert and ffmpeg installed)
sage -t -long -only-optional=imagemagick (with only convert installed)
sage -t -long -only-optional=ffmpeg (with only ffmpeg installed)
sage -t -long
```

Would it be sensible to use *cksum* to create a checksum of the files, so we know if the expected file is generated? Since otherwise I don't think we know if this is actually producing a decent animation That might cause an issue if the version of the external software is changed. Differnet versions might change the algorithm, or add the string of the version in some way, so this might not work. (*cksum* is portable - unlike any attempt to get an md5 checksum will be.) Another option would be to check the file is of the correct size. If one measured it in KB, for example with:


```
drkirkby@laptop:~$ du -k testcc.sh
4	testcc.sh
```


then I doubt the size of the file would change much from version to version. Note we would need the -k option on du. Whilst that is the default on Linux, POSIX states the output should be in blocks of 512 bytes, but Linux ignores this, and by default prints the output in block of 1024 bytes. This is one of the things that makes Linux non-POSIX compatible)

I think it would be more useful to suggest checking for programs like *conjure* or  *mogrify *, as anyone could have a program called *convert* on their system, which is unrelated to ImageMagick, since the word is in such common use. One can easily imagine something having something to convert between different units (mm, inches etc) and calling the program *convert*. 

I think somewhere, at some point, we should try to document what packages would be useful to have with Sage. We say LaTex is *highly recommended*, but it would be worth documenting things that are useful like *FFmpeg* and *ImageMagick*. But that of course is for another ticket.

Nice!  Here are a few things I noticed in the patch:

line 334: "neither ffmpeg or ImageMagick is not installed...": needs to be cleaned up

line 458: "Returns an mpeg showing...": this is from the docstring for .ffmpeg -- should it be reworded to include other video formats?

line 527: "saving an animation to an mpg file..." : this error message is shown even if another format is chosen -- could be confusing if a user misunderstands and thinks that mpg format is the underlying problem.

Meanwhile, recommending the installation of ffmpeg or ImageMagick seems like a good idea, and so I've added it to the patch.

Good. I think we really need a list of such programs (outside the scope of this ticket). I'll raise that on sage-devel. If we can get a list, these can be added to the installation guide. 

As you are aware, I'm not a Python guru, so don't feel able to give this a proper review, but there was something else that I found a bit odd. I don't know if there is any standard for specifying if optional tests get run. Take a look at for one example for Mathematica


```
    sage: mobj = mathematica(x^2-1)             # optional - mathematica
```


in the file


```
./devel/sage-main/sage/interfaces/mathematica.py
```


and now compare that to yours on this ticket. 


```
sage: a.show() # optional -- ImageMagick 
```


Two obvious things are different can be seen. 

* The Mathematica example uses two hypens, your example uses one. 
* The Mathematica example uses all lower case, despite Wolfram Research use an upper case M at the start. Your example uses the proper case for ImageMagick

**IF** this means that one needs to specify how to run the Mathematica and ImageMagick tests differently, then I think that's a bad idea. But I've got no idea what is considered "right" in sage, but I think we should at least be consistent. 

I suspect the most robust solution is for the code to accept either case - i.e. convert all to lower case, then accept that. Then it would not matter what the user typed. Again outside this ticket, but if it has been agreed to use all lower case, then perhaps you should use that).

For either ffmpeg or ImageMagick by themselves, this might be right, but ffmpeg produces GIFs which are larger (by a fair amount) than ImageMagick does, it seems to me in my limited testing.

> This looks very good, and I'm excited to get it in. I do see one tiny problem: in the `ffmpeg()` function, line 524, you import `have_program` but don't use it -- that's the job of `self._have_ffmpeg()`. So I think you can delete line 524.

Done -- here's a new patch.  I also rebased it against 4.7.rc1 -- there were some changes to the same parts of the installation guide, so the old version wasn't applying cleanly.
