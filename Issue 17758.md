# Issue 17758: ascii_art in Tableaux.global_options has outdated documentation

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17995

In Tableaux.global_options, the ascii_art documentation is out of date: "normal"  is no longer an option.  The "table" option could possibly use a new alias.

Good work! I have posted the underlying bug in the doctest framework as #18051.

First, Darij, reviewer name.

Second, you should set `.boxes` as an alias for `table` and `plain` for `diagram` by adding `alias=dict(plain='diagram', boxes="table")`, see the options above the `ascii_art` for instance. This way you need far less code for the same effect you're trying to achieve (and it's easier to maintain).

Unfortunately, due to the current limitations of the doctesting framework, it doesn't know to run those tests in (dynamically) generated doc. See #14272. Also you'll have to update `doctest/sources.py` and it has a test to catch exactly how many tests we are currently skipping.

Thank you for the info! This is far down my queue, though, so I think my reviewer name has no business being there.

todo: ascii art should also take into account that tableaux can have huge entries
