Should we recommend GNU make 3.82?

W.r.t. Clang, I'd mention that Sage's GCC currently won't build with it [either], because of #13948 (but a couple if not most of Sage's packages already do, and help in getting the remaining ones to build is welcome).

My changes add the sentences "Clang currently does not work." and "Clang is currently not supported, see :trac:`12426`." I think that's clear enough, and it points to #12426 where further details can be found.

It may indeed be worth suggesting to use GNU make 3.82 if possible.

Other than that I'm happy with the patch.

Just out of curiosity, what's the definitive reason for dropping OpenSolaris support?
We only have one intermittent patchbot and there is no upstream anymore?

Mostly this. It became impossible to test. And people have asked before about dropping OpenSolaris support.

OK, made some further changes, needs_review.

I also bumped the space requirement to 5 GB, since I just noticed my full Sage 5.10 install (for testing) takes 4.2 GB of disk space.

Great, you also added/changed the RAM requirement which I just thought about (I could build Sage on a Raspberry Pi with just 256 MB of RAM and 512 MB of swap).

Changing status from needs_review to positive_review.

I'd still have clarified that currently even bootstrapping Sage's GCC with Clang doesn't work (out of the box), but for a subtle reason (with a link to _that_ ticket).

Related, it's also unclear what exactly is meant by "a wide variety of compilers is supported", i.e., whether they're supported in the sense that Sage can bootstrap its own GCC with these, or whether they're really able to build Sage.

Something for Sage 5.11.* ...

Somebody<sup>TM</sup> should investigate why...

Not that long ago, 2 - 2.5 GB were indeed sufficient (without clones and the like).

(And while we've added some spkgs, we also dropped some, like MoinMoin and Twisted.)

* `$SAGE_LOCAL` takes 1.9 GB
* `devel/sage/build` takes 1.4 GB of stuff which (I believe) is only temporary and not really needed
* `devel/sage/doc/output` takes 0.6 GB
* `spkg/standard` takes 0.3 GB
