# Issue 13072: make some simplicial complexes faster

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13244

Original creator: jhpalmieri

Original creation time: 2012-07-12 20:09:21

Assignee: jhpalmieri

Keywords: sd40 simplicial

A few simplicial complexes in the file `sage/homology/examples.py` are defined by computing orbits of a some lists under the action of a specific group. This can take a second or two, so we can save time by doing the computations once and then just using the explicitly computed orbits after that. The attached patch does this: it moves the G-orbit code out of the methods for the appropriate simplicial complexes, replacing it with an explicit list of facets. It stores the G-orbit code as a stand-alone function, in case anyone wants to see how the facets were constructed in the first place.

This also adds a minimal triangulation of the Klein bottle, and it uses proper reST formatting for references.

Changing status from new to needs_review.

The patch looks good, even if I am not quite convinced by the trading of time-consumption versus dataspace-usage.

But where is the patchbot ?

My belief is that this is the better approach since memory/disk space is cheap, especially compared to CPU cycles since it takes seconds. However I would argue that each of these should be implemented as (immutable) singletons unless someone can think of a reason why you would need a true duplicate. Perhaps that should be another ticket and this one be set to positive review?

Also a minor technical thing, from looking at the patch file I believe the reference in SimplicialComplexExamples() on line 1027 is missing the linking underscore.

I added the missing underscore; thanks for catching that.

I certainly agree with this, but I wrote the patch.

I'm not sure what you mean by this. Do you mean that any two instances of `simplicial_complexes.K3Surface()` should be identical as far as Python is concerned? We could try making `SimplicialComplex` inherit from `UniqueRepresentation`, for example, or maybe we could do this for `SimplicialComplexExamples`. But I think it could be put off to another ticket.

I think so. I think sage's ``@`cached_method` would take care of this...or perhaps something like

```
def an_example(self):
   if not self.has_attr(_an_example_output):
      self._an_example_output = SimplicialComplex(facets)
   return self._an_example_output
```

But I'm happy moving this to a later ticket.

Everything is looks good to me. I've created a ticket for the above #13566.
