Keywords: polytope, normaliz, IMA-PolyGeom

Using Normaliz can compute several things that are currently not interfaced. For example:

- Integral points generators
- Volume
- Euclidean volume
- Triangulations

This ticket provides some new features.

Replying to SimonKing

Normaliz can compute Hilbert series of the integral closures of monomial ideals, not of arbitrary monomial ideals. If one wants to apply it: input the monomials as vertices, the polynomial ring as cone (= unit matrix), and put the weights of the indeterminates into the grading.

Example for Normaliz input (integral closure of (x^2, y^2, deg x = 2, deg y =1)



```
amb_space 2
vertices 2
2 0 1
0 2 1
cone 2
1 0
0 1
grading 
2 1
HilbertSeries
```

How to use the new interface to normaliz to compute the Hilbert series of (the integral closure of) `J`?\n\nSince I never worked with the integral closure of a monomial ideal: How are the Hilbert series of the ideal and its integral closure related?",

Thank you. But my question was really: Given a monomial ideal **in Sage**, how to compute the Hilbert series of it (or maybe of its integral closure) using normaliz as a backend (not: *in* normaliz).

I.e.:

```
        sage: n=4;m=11;P = PolynomialRing(QQ,n*m,"x"); x = P.gens(); M = Matrix(n,x)
        sage: I = P.ideal(M.minors(2))
        sage: J = P*[m.lm() for m in I.groebner_basis()]
```

and what now? How to use the new interface to normaliz to compute the Hilbert series of (the integral closure of) `J`?

Since I never worked with the integral closure of a monomial ideal: How are the Hilbert series of the ideal and its integral closure related?

"What now?" is a question that Jean-Philippe should answer. I have no overview which of the Normaliz computation goals can be reached from Sage. However, all of them can be reached via PyNormaliz. For example, Normaliz can take a binomial ideal (suitably encoded) as input. It finds the affine monoid A defined by the binomial ideal, and then computes invariants of the normalization of A.

I think there is no way to relate the Hilbert series of an ideal I and the Hilbert series of its integral closure in a useful way.

My knowledge of the theory lacks in order to give you a satisfactory answer to your questions.

The present ticket allows you to get the Hilbert series *of a rational polyhedron*. Whether this Hilbert series *is* or corresponds to the Hilbert series of a monomial ideal should be clarified. In case they match, then, what I would do in Sage is

1) a function that transfers the data of the monomial ideal to a polyhedron that uses the backend normaliz and compute its hilbert series (a function implemented in this ticket).

2) use PyNormaliz package directly as the normaliz backend of polyhedron is currently doing. This is not really well documented as its usage is currently only in the backend for polyhedron.

For this, the present ticket provides some useful functions to deal with PyNormaliz that builds on #25090.

I looked back at this now, and I'm getting a weird result from an example in Normaliz' manual:


```
sage: P = Polyhedron(vertices=[(1/2,1/2),(1/3,1/3),(1/4,-1/2)],backend='normaliz')
sage: P
A 2-dimensional polyhedron in QQ^2 defined as the convex hull of 3 vertices
sage: P.hilbert_series()
0
```


From calling PyNormaliz, I get:


```
sage: h = PyNormaliz.NmzResult(new_cone, "HilbertSeries")
sage: h
[[], [], -1L]
```


So it's not the parsing from PyNormaliz to sage, but rather something weird is happening here. It has been a while since I wrote the code so I am a bit lost in trying to figure out what is going on...

I'll try to do some more searching...

I guess you want the Ehrhart series. The Normaliz computation goal HilbertSeries requires the existence of a grading which is not defined with this input. 

This is an intricate point, but it is inevitable: the grading is defined on the space in which the polyhedron lives, not on the cone over it.

Replying to [comment:47 Winfried]:

Yes, in the end I want the Ehrhart series, but I was doing both computations to understand their difference again...

> This is an intricate point, but it is inevitable: the grading is defined on the space in which the polyhedron lives, not on the cone over it.  

Yes, agreed. I take this example from p.23 of the Normaliz manual. I thought that HilbertSeries would work out of the box like in the example. That's why I am asking myself what I did wrong.

In the code for hilbert_series, if no grading is given, we canonically give the all 1's grading on the ambient space, and then ask for the HilbertSeries, in which case we get the empty result(!?). (Is that a good choice of canonical grading?)

So, my question would be, how do I get the result from the Normaliz manual?

This issue makes me wonder also if the results in the current examples are actually true (because maybe I am doing something wrong). For example, what would be the expected outputs of for the 3-dimensional 0-1 cube?

Currently it gives me:


```
sage: C = Polyhedron(vertices = [[0,0,0],[0,0,1],[0,1,0],[0,1,1],[1,0,0],[1,0,1]
....: ,[1,1,0],[1,1,1]],backend='normaliz')
sage: C.hilbert_series()
t^3 + 3*t^2 + 3*t + 1
sage: C.ehrhart_series()
(t^2 + 4*t + 1)/(t^10 - t^9 - t^8 + 2*t^5 - t^2 - t + 1)
sage: C.ehrhart_series().denominator().factor()
(t + 1)^2 * (t - 1)^4 * (t^2 + 1) * (t^2 + t + 1)
sage: C.ehrhart_quasipolynomial()
t^3 + 3*t^2 + 3*t + 1
```


Hilbert series and ehrhart polynomials look fine, but the denominator of the Ehrhart series is not what I would expect. Is that related to the discussion on p.24 of Normaliz' manual?

I would have expected (1-t)^4, so that the degree would be -2 so that when we dilate by a factor two, we see the first interior integer point. Right?

HilbertSeries works out of the box, provided you use the right input type:

**polytope** defines a cone and a grading, and the Hilbert series of the cone under this grading is the Ehrhart series of the polytope that arises as the intersection of the cone and the hyperplane of degree 1 elements. **polytope** is a homogeneous input type.

The inhomogeneous type **vertices**  only defines a polytope P, or in connection with cone a potentially umbounded polyhedron. We can have an grding on the space in which the polytope lives, and then HilbertSeries makes sense.  This Hilbert series is the generating function of the lattice point enumerator of the points **in** P. You can ask Normaliz to compute the Ehrhart series of P if P is bounded. It constructs a cone with a grading behind the scenes and computes the Hilbert series of that cone.

So far, so good.

In your cube example: the vertices are in principle rational vectors. What are your denominators? Does Sage choose them automatically? If so what are they? 

Moreover, it seems to me tat Sage implicitly defines a grading on the space of the polytpe, taking the sum of the coordinates. This explains why you get a Hilbert series and that it is exactly the result shown: 1 point of degree 0, 3 points of degree 1, 3 of degree 2 and 1 of degree 3.

The denominator of the Ehrhart series is for a 3-dimensional polytope that has vertices of degree 4,3,2 qnd 1.

Before I can say more, I must know what happens on the way from Sage input to Normaliz input.

Dear Winfried,

Thanks for your quick reply. This explanation is really good, and probably I should add it to the top to shortly describe how the translation from sage to normaliz is done.

Here is the verbose of the example for the cube, we can see the input given by sage to normaliz.
The current way is to always use inhomogeneous (vertices, cones, and subspaces). Eventually, inhom. equations and inequalities are added.


```
sage: C = Polyhedron(vertices = [[0,0,0],[0,0,1],[0,1,0],[0,1,1],[1,0,0],[1,0,1],[1,1,0],[1,1,1]],backend='normaliz',
....: verbose=True)
# Calling PyNormaliz.NmzCone(**{'subspace': [], 'vertices': [[0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 0, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1]], 'cone': []})
# ----8<---- Equivalent Normaliz input file ----8<----
amb_space 3
subspace 0
vertices 8
 0 0 0 1
 0 0 1 1
 0 1 0 1
 0 1 1 1
 1 0 0 1
 1 0 1 1
 1 1 0 1
 1 1 1 1
cone 0
# ----8<-------------------8<-------------------8<----
```


Once I have this, I compute the hilbert series, **without** giving any grading. In this case, Sage assign the grading [1,...,1] and passes it to normaliz (as you observed) and get:


```
sage: C.hilbert_series()
t^3 + 3*t^2 + 3*t + 1
```


Now, for the Ehrhart series, I get:


```
sage: C.ehrhart_series()
(t^2 + 4*t + 1)/(t^10 - t^9 - t^8 + 2*t^5 - t^2 - t + 1)
```


As you said:

>  It constructs a cone with a grading behind the scenes and computes the Hilbert series of that cone. 

What is the grading in this case?

So there seems to be a difference between the above input and the one you mentioned:


```
amb_space auto
vertices
[[0,0,0,1],[0,0,1,1],[0,1,0,1],[0,1,1,1],[1,0,0,1],[1,0,1,1],[1,1,0,1],[1,1,1,1]]
EhrhartSeries
```


because they give different output for the Ehrhart series?

So far I simply created the 0-1-cube using normaliz. Then, I get the normaliz cone and the enclosed data:


```
sage: cone = C._normaliz_cone;cone
<capsule object "Cone" at 0x7fcc880cf210>
sage: data = C._get_nmzcone_data()
```


From there, if I compute the Hilbert Series directly, it will complain, because it does not have a grading:


```
sage: PyNormaliz.NmzResult(cone,"HilbertSeries")

```


So far so good. Then, I ask for the Ehrhart series and then, it unlocks the Hilbert series:


```
sage: PyNormaliz.NmzResult(cone,"EhrhartSeries")
[[1L, 4L, 1L], [1L, 1L, 1L, 1L], 0L]
sage: PyNormaliz.NmzResult(cone,"HilbertSeries")
[[1L, 4L, 1L], [1L, 1L, 1L, 1L], 0L]
```


For now, there is no way to access the difference in the normaliz cone. It is now equipped with a grading in the background, but it seems that we can not extract it:


```
sage: new_C = C.parent().element_class._from_normaliz_cone(parent=C.parent(),normaliz_cone=cone)
sage: PyNormaliz.NmzResult(new_C._normaliz_cone,"HilbertSeries")
[[1L, 4L, 1L], [1L, 1L, 1L, 1L], 0L]
sage: PyNormaliz.NmzResult(new_C._normaliz_cone,"Grading")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
error                                     Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-43-809cb91899e5> in <module>()
----> 1 PyNormaliz.NmzResult(new_C._normaliz_cone,"Grading")

error: Could not compute: Grading !
```


But, when creating a whole new cone from the data and adding by hand the grading (which is what is done in `hilbert_series` in sage, we get the enumeration of the lattice points with respect to this grading:


```
sage: C.hilbert_series()
t^3 + 3*t^2 + 3*t + 1
```


This can be reproduced manually as:


```
sage: data['grading'] = [1] * C.ambient_dim()
sage: new_cone = C._make_normaliz_cone(data)
sage: h = PyNormaliz.NmzResult(new_cone, "HilbertSeries");h
[[1L, 3L, 3L, 1L], [], 0L]
```


So, right now, we get two potential output for Hilbert series.

Further, if we actually change the normaliz cone while doing the computation of the Hilbert series (instead of doing it on a distinct cone created on the side), it then breaks the ehrhart series:


```
sage: C._normaliz_cone = new_cone
sage: C.ehrhart_series()

Everything above is as it should be, with 2 exceptions:

1) The computation of the Ehrhart series should not make the Hilbert series computed. This requires a correction in libnormaliz.

There is no grading in the background. The Ehrhart series was computed on an auxiliary cone.

2) Sage should not add a default grading if one asks for the Hilbert series. This is not in my hands.

Further remark: if one changes the grading later on (or defines one), all grading dependent results are erased.

Ok!!

So I went back to PyNormaliz and had a look at the tutorial mentioned in Appendix E of the normaliz manual:

https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Normaliz/NormalizJupyter/master

In there, the PyNormaliz output of .hilbert_series is explained. **Importantly**, it seems that the output is different than the one of normaliz(!). This was the source of one of the above problems.


```
[[1L, 4L, 1L], [1L, 1L, 1L, 1L], 0L]
```


As to be interpreted as `t^2+4t+1` divided by `(1-t)(1-t)(1-t)(1-t)` and a `0` shift.

So, it's all good. But it indicates that the code should be more explicit on those output formats... I'll put this on my list of TODO to add on some comments on the pynormaliz side...

Yes, makes sense now. Somehow got it wrong from the beginning. I just commited an update that should cover the mistake. I added several examples coming from normaliz manual to be able to compare.

I still have to smoothen the usage for the user. But now, at least things look like they work and make sense...

Here is a bug, which I think is coming from the PyNormaliz side of things:


```
sage: v = [[0,0,0],[0,0,1],[0,1,0],[0,1,1],[1,0,0],[1,0,1],[1,1,0],[1,1,1]]
sage: cube = Polyhedron(vertices=v,backend='normaliz')
sage: cube._volume_normaliz()
sage: cube._volume_normaliz('induced_lattice')
6
sage: cube._volume_normaliz()
1.0
```


Equivalently:


```
sage: v = [[0,0,0],[0,0,1],[0,1,0],[0,1,1],[1,0,0],[1,0,1],[1,1,0],[1,1,1]]
sage: cube = Polyhedron(vertices=v,backend='normaliz',verbose=True)

I have some comments:

This is a general Python convention we try to follow with the messages, moreover, the error is because the class has the wrong type (you are not expecting it to be implemented at some point, right?):

```diff
-raise NotImplementedError("The backend should be normaliz.")
+raise TypeError("the backend should be normaliz")
```

A similar comment applies elsewhere too. However, the `ImportError` can be the exception to this guide as it is "long".

The `INPUT:` bullet points are not considered to be complete sentences, so they should not end in a period/full-stop.

PEP8:

```diff
-sage: S = Polyhedron(vertices = [[0,1],[1,0]],backend='normaliz') # optional - pynormaliz
+sage: S = Polyhedron(vertices=[[0,1],[1,0]], backend='normaliz')  # optional - pynormaliz
```

and similar such things.

In `ehrhart_series()`, i think this will look better in latex formatting:

```
-``t^k`` is number of integer lattice points inside the ``k``-th dilation of
+`t^k` is number of integer lattice points inside the `k`-th dilation of
```

Note that `k` and `t` are not input variable names.

Thank you for changing the error message strings.

You also need to make a changes in the `combinat/rigged_configurations/kleber_tree.py`

```diff
         try:
             poly = Polyhedron(ieqs=ieqs, backend='normaliz')
             self._has_normaliz = True

             poly = Polyhedron(ieqs=ieqs)
             self._has_normaliz = False
```

to reflect the new error message is thrown. That should take care of all of the errors reported on the patchbot (for when `normaliz` is not installed).

Modulo that, I am happy with this and am willing to set a positive review. Jeroen, any other comments?

You definitely seem to have done quite a bit in your workshop. However, now there are serious things failing: I am getting an infinite recursion happening that ends with

A function that only calls itself will definitely infinitely recurse. `;)`

Additionally, a couple of little details noted by the patchbot from pyflakes for `backend_normaliz.py`:

In `def _cone_generators(pynormaliz_cone):`, you have

```
return self._nmz_result(pynormaliz_cone, "Generators")
```

In particular, `self` is not been defined in this ``@`staticmethod`.

Do you require the `import PyNormaliz` here in `_nmz_result`:

```
        PythonModule("PyNormaliz", spkg="pynormaliz").require()
        import PyNormaliz
        return self._nmz_result(normaliz_cone, property)

Hm. Annoying.

I can reproduce this with `--optional=4ti2,bliss,dochtml,e_antic,gfortran,latte_int,lidia,lrslib,memlimit,mpir,ninja_build,python2,sage,topcom`

and all tests pass with `pynormaliz` added. Dammit.

Got it! It's from a previous test... That's a easy fix. I forgot to put both latte_it and pynormaliz as optional...
