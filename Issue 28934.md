As discussed on [this sage-devel thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/uYXGzG_py28), we propose to move the Cython code that used to be in the optional package `giacpy_sage` into `sage/libs/giac/`.

Thank you.
The doc you want for a giac keyword (Ex: gbasis) is avaible like this:


```
sage: from sage.libs.giac.giac import *
sage: libgiac.gbasis._help()
sage: libgiac.gbasis._sage_doc_()
```

Indeed 
`libgiac.gbasis?` doesn't give the good help string. 
NB: you removed the def help(self):
so now libgiac.gbasis.help()   crashes. You should also remove the property help or use _help in it.

NB: we should think about the new name you chose. Ex backward compatibility or confusions?

Ex: in the past I had often to say: "This  already appears in giac, it doesn't come from giacpy_sage".
giac is already the name of the C++ library, the name of the external giac program and the pexpect interface...

No I think it this situation where giacpy_sage is not a package anymore it is not important to keep backward comptatibility. I think here it is better to just drop the giacpy_sage setup.py and let sage build it via the entry in module.py as vincent did in this branch.

the problem if I add `lazy_import('sage.libs.giac.giac', 'libgiac')`
is that the first time one type libgiac(2) the user might be confused by the loading message of the giac library:

is it better to not use lazy_import or to force the loading at startup  or just keep this message during the first use of libgiac?

There's something wrong with our installation, as mentioned in #29552
