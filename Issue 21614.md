In ` multi_polynomial_ring_generic.pyx `, maybe you forgot list around the second ` range(1,11) ` in that line?

You're going to hate me, but...I think the polynomials should take `range` as input for when we do switch to Python3 and is better future-proof...

Well, I am getting used to get wishes and suggestions but not much help..

I think I tried to do that, and failed, because I did not find where to make the required addition of "range".

Do you have any idea where precisely the input of R(something) is taken care of, when R is a polynomial ring ?
