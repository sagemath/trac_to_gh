# Issue 22962: missing sig_on/off in symbolic arithmetics

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Throwing exceptions from Pynac when Python raises some will crash Sage in a Pynac prototype because signal guards are missing in `exception.pyx`.

You can simplify

```
try:
    [...]
    X
except (...):
    X
    raise
```

to

```
try:
    [...]
finally:
    X
```

This is wrong:

```
try:
    sig_on()
    [...]
finally:
    sig_off()
```


It should be

```
sig_on()
try:
    [...]
finally:
    sig_off()
```

With sage 8.0.beta11 building against Debian packages we still get this segfault after the docbuild. We are already using pynac 0.7.8.

Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* module has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off().
Python will now terminate.

The crash log file is empty.

Moved to #23264

I have some doubts about this ticket now. The problem is that Pynac is executing Python code and executing Python code during `sig_on()` is not supported. This is especially problematic in case that garbage collection is done during `sig_on()`. See #27060

Ralf, do you remember exactly which problem this ticket was supposed to address? When removing those `sig_on()` statements again in #27060, I don't see any problems appearing. So either the problem here is fixed in a different way or we are missing tests for it.
