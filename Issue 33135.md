In #28485, we made a performance improvement to `any_root`, but it can be taken further.  Here's the setup:

```
sage: P.<x> = PolynomialRing(GF(401^13, 'a'))
sage: t = 2*x^14 - 5 + 6*x
sage: k = t.base_ring()
sage: l = GF(401^(13*14), 'b')
sage: g = k.modulus()
sage: %time z = g.change_ring(l).any_root()
Wall time: 15.3 s
sage: %time z = g.any_root(l)
Wall time: 66 ms
```

The change ring paradigm is common (it occurs in Sage library code) and has unfortunate performance consequences, since it requires computing `q`th powers modulo `g` for a 1573-bit value of `q`.

One solution is to test the input polynomial to see if the coefficients actually lie in a smaller field.  For the prime field, this is cheap and easy and this change is included in #28485.  We've left other such improvements for this ticket.
