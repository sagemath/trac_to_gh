CC:  dimpase mkoeppe chapoton

One doctest continuously fails in the build workflow. I couldn't reproduce the error locally, but hopefully it goes away by slightly increasing the timeout from 1sec to 1.5sec.

We also extend the doctest to provide a bit more debug information, and to actually test parallel processing by using two roots and thus two threads.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33834
