# Issue 16021: DirichletGroup does not work for rings with unhashable elements

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: saraedum

Original creation time: 2014-04-28 11:01:22

The following fails because p-adics are not hashable:

```
sage: K.<a> = Qq(9)
sage: DirichletGroup(2,base_ring=K,zeta=K(-1),zeta_order=2)
TypeError: unhashable type: 'sage.rings.padics.padic_ZZ_pX_CR_element.pAdicZZpXCRElement'
```

What's the relation between #16342 and #16258? In any case, needs rebasing.
