# Issue 9755: Symmetric Function coercion issue

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jbandlow

Original creation time: 2010-08-17 15:27:40

Assignee: jbandlow

CC:  sage-combinat

Keywords: symmetric functions

The following was reported to me by Nicolas Thi√©ry and Lenny Tevlin.


```
R.<q,t> = ZZ[]
R = FractionField(R)
P = MacdonaldPolynomialsP(R,q,t) 
Q = HallLittlewoodQ(R,t) # or Q or P (Qp = H)
Ph=HallLittlewoodP(R,t)
SF = SymmetricFunctions(R)
SF.inject_shorthands()
Q(s.one())

Traceback (click to the left of this block for traceback)
...
AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'subs'
```

The same error occurs with `Ph(s.one())`, although `P(s.one())` works.

Could someone make the commit string a bit more descriptive, e.g., `#9755: Fix coercion problem for Hall-Littlewood polynomials`?

Could you move `#9755: Fix...` to the first line of the commit string?  Otherwise, `hg log` gives, e.g.,

Sorry.  How's the new version (I forgot to overwrite the old one)?
