Assignee: jbandlow

CC:  sage-combinat

Keywords: symmetric functions

The following was reported to me by Nicolas Thi√©ry and Lenny Tevlin.


```
R.<q,t> = ZZ[]
R = FractionField(R)
P = MacdonaldPolynomialsP(R,q,t) 
Q = HallLittlewoodQ(R,t) # or Q or P (Qp = H)
Ph=HallLittlewoodP(R,t)
SF = SymmetricFunctions(R)
SF.inject_shorthands()
Q(s.one())

Traceback (click to the left of this block for traceback)
...
AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'subs'
```

The same error occurs with `Ph(s.one())`, although `P(s.one())` works.
