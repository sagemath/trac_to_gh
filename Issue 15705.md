```
actual=`md5 $file | sed 's/[^0-9a-f].*//'`
```

makes no sense, because that's not what's returned (at least on Macs).

```
md5 -q
```

actually does work, though I don't know how portable this is.

I can't guarantee this will work on other systems with possibly different `md5` implementation, but at any rate the sed doesn't mess things up, as makes sense.  For reference, with `-q`, `md5` on Mac outputs

```
$ md5 Downloads/974230_10103787412222420_571824162_n.jpg
MD5 (Downloads/974230_10103787412222420_571824162_n.jpg) = bf36ca4308ce426d74d095681ebd5a18

So fine with me, but maybe someone else should be asked as well who knows about such things?

`md5` is not posix so whats your question? IMHO we can only try it out and see if its better. The real solution is to not try a handful different non-posix utilities. Instead use Python and the standard md5 Python module.

Why do we use different invocations of `md5` in `sage-spkg` vs. `sage-fix-pkg-checksums`? We could instead change `sage-spkg` to use

```
actual=`md5 $file | sed 's/.*= *//'`
```

This works for me after I disable `shasum` and `md5sum` on my Mac. (I suppose I have the same questions about invoking `shasum` and `md5sum` in the two scripts, but since `md5` is the one causing the problems, that's obviously the most relevant.)
