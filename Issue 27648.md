# Issue 27648: Py3: symbolic/expression.pyx fix some errors

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27885

Original creator: vklein

Original creation time: 2019-05-28 13:45:14

- Fix the errors
`AttributeError: 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression' object has no attribute '__nonzero__'` appearing in python3. 
`'__nonzero__'` is renamed into `'__bool__'` in python3.
The directs calls in the `EXAMPLES` have been moved into the `TESTS` and replaced by calls of the bool function as it is the correct way to call these special methods.

- Use #py2 #py3 tag to manage the difference of messages for `TypeError` when an object is not subscriptable.
