Might as well go all the way

```diff
-        if len(variables[0]) > 0:
+        if len(variables[0]):
```

to `if variables[0]:`. :) LGTM otherwise.

Patchbot is now green. Hmm...interesting. Some bikeshedding, but I feel it makes the code more clear to have the more explicit `len(foo) > 0`. Up to you, but feel free to set it to a positive review whichever way you want to have it.

Hmm.. I am setting to positive in the present state.
