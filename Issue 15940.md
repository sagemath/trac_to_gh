```
sage:             sage: from sage.algebras.clifford_algebra import ExteriorAlgebraDifferential
  File "<ipython-input-4-6c4dbe5dff5e>", line 1
    sage: from sage.algebras.clifford_algebra import ExteriorAlgebraDifferential
        ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

sage:             sage: E.<x,y,z> = ExteriorAlgebra(QQ)
  File "<ipython-input-5-7a32afb1555a>", line 1
    sage: E.<x,y,z> = ExteriorAlgebra(QQ)
        ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```


It would work without the space before "sage:", but that's how these things come in the doctests. I know it is not a required feature, but it's annoying not to have it! Is there an alternative for debugging doctests?

Yes, this is very annoying indeed. Probably the new IPython ?

This has been solved by #16196 and #16297
