So far you just moved the methods to a `.pyx` file and specified the type of some variables. Have you tried to go deeper in the code in order to get significant speed up improvements ? May be some data structures could be changed.

I will look into it. I did some benchmarking and even with these improvements, it seems that the methods run a bit faster.

That's for sure, but we cythonize if there is a significant speed-up or reduction of memory consumption. Otherwise, the benefit is rather limited.
