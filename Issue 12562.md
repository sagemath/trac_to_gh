# Issue 12562: inconsistency in points of schemes

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/12734

Original creator: AlexGhitza

Original creation time: 2012-03-23 10:22:53

Keywords: scheme point

We have


```
sage: AffineSpace(2, ZZ)(ZZ)
Set of rational points of Affine Space of dimension 2 over Integer Ring
```


but


```
sage: Spec(ZZ)(ZZ)
Point on Spectrum of Integer Ring defined by the Principal ideal (1) of Integer Ring
```


We should probably fix the Spec one to have the documented behavior (return the Set of ZZ-rational points).  Note of course that the current interpretation is completely wrong, since (1) is not a prime ideal of ZZ.  This is due to the prime ideal check being disabled by default (this is documented in a comment in the code).
