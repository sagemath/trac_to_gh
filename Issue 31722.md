... we only need to be careful with the method `ambient_dim`, which is the dimension of the polyhedron, not of the space.

Every function needs a doctest, even if they are just ``@`abstract_method` stubs. (This annoys me too at times, but it is the current policy. Although it is good for showing how an implementation should (or does) work.) One in particular is `ConvexSet_base._test_contains` needs a doctest (since it was added in e66448e).

Can you please remove the import of `SageObject` in `face.py`.

It's redundant now.

It was positive before and the unused import was the only complaint.
