Not really, since it removes yet another instance of sage trying to write to someplace it shouldn't be at runtime.

The purpose of `GAP_STAMP` seems to be a check on whether it needs to refresh the workspaces. Really, this will all become a moot point if/when libgap is finished.

I don't write to `SAGE_EXTCODE`, I just use its creation for the timestamp that gap wants. It used to be that when you first started sage, it would touch `SAGE_LOCAL/bin/gap_stamp` and then use the timestamp of that.

I agree, nothing should try to write to `SAGE_LOCAL` or its subdirectories in the long run.

OK. If we just want a GAP_STAMP file for everyone and in SAGE_EXTCODE it should really be created by the extcode spkg. Is it a file we really need?

I would argue for `local/share` because the stuff in `SAGE_DATA` (apart from extcode) isn't part of Sage.  It's part of external packages/databases.  So I think it's wrong to use a `sage` subdirectory.

Installing databases in `local/share/sage/data` is like installing all binaries in `local/bin/sage/binaries` and we don't do that either.

For extcode, `local/share/sage` makes sense.

`@`fbissey

Because the commented out code references `SAGE_DATA/extcode` and hasn't been used in a long long time (see #6233).

* Removed refactoring of `sage.databases.cremona`
* Reverted change of `SAGE_ROOT -> SAGE_LOCAL` in `sage.interfaces.gap` (better done in #13432)
