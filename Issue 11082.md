defaultdict allows to initialize automatically values of a dict to zero::


```
sage: from collections import defaultdict      
sage: d = defaultdict(int)                     
sage: d['aa'] += 1                             
sage: d                                        
defaultdict(<type 'int'>, {'aa': 1})           
sage: d['bb'] = 9                              
sage: d                                        
defaultdict(<type 'int'>, {'aa': 1, 'bb': 9})  
```


It might be better to use this instead for `evaluation_dict` method of finite words.

Here are some timings. The patch improves the timing for small alphabet. But it makes it slower for bigger alphabet... So, I don't know anymore if it is a good thing...


SMALL ALPHABET

without the patch:


```
sage: w = Word( [i % 4 for i in range(1000000)])  
sage: time w.evaluation_dict()                    
CPU times: user 0.80 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 0.80 s
Wall time: 0.82 s                                 
{0: 250000, 1: 250000, 2: 250000, 3: 250000}      
```


with the patch:


```
sage: w = Word( [i % 4 for i in range(1000000)])                       
sage: time w.evaluation_dict()                                         
CPU times: user 0.55 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.55 s                     
Wall time: 0.56 s                                                      
defaultdict(<type 'int'>, {0: 250000, 1: 250000, 2: 250000, 3: 250000})
```


BIG ALPHABET

without the patch:


```
sage: w = Word(range(1000))          
sage: %timeit w.evaluation_dict()    
625 loops, best of 3: 577 µs per loop
```


with the patch:


```
sage: w = Word(range(1000))           
sage: %timeit w.evaluation_dict()     
625 loops, best of 3: 915 µs per loop 
```

Salut Alex,

What do you think?
