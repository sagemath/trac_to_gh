# Issue 18178: Cleanup of documentation in combinat.nscf_qsym

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18415

There are a significant number of problems with the documentation in ncsf_qsym.  One major component of this cleanup involves fixing broken links.  There is also missing documentation for some of the bases because the doc strings were hidden in the `__init__` file instead under the header of the basis.  I will also try to fill in any missing TODOs.

One todo indicated that the coercions between multiplicative bases should probably be algebra morphisms rather than module morphisms.  I checked and the example `S(basis[1,2,3,4,5,6])` and `basis(S[1,2,3,4,5,6])` in had a roughly x4 speedup for each basis elementary/Phi/Psi.  I went ahead and implemented `_to/from_complete_on_generators` and deleted `_to/from_complete_on_basis` for the Phi and Psi bases.

Hey Mike,

Mostly looks good. I took the opportunity to make some minor additional tweaks. If you're happy with my changes, then positive review.
