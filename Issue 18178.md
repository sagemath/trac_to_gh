There are a significant number of problems with the documentation in ncsf_qsym.  One major component of this cleanup involves fixing broken links.  There is also missing documentation for some of the bases because the doc strings were hidden in the `__init__` file instead under the header of the basis.  I will also try to fill in any missing TODOs.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18415
