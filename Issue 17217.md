This is a metaticket listing **existing** functions for which symbolic implementations are urgently needed because
* they exist in Sympy, Maxima, or Fricas symbolically, and might be returned as result
* they belong to the holonomic repertoire

special:
* Airy functions (#12455)
* elliptic modular j-function (#15354)
* Kummer confluent hypergeometric functions (#14896)
* spherical Bessel and Hankel functions (#15024)

combinatorial:
* Bell numbers
* Bernoulli numbers
* Catalan numbers
* Fibonacci(n), general Lucas(u,v)
* subfactorial

polynomial (metaticket #16670):
* Legendre P,Q (#16813)
* Laguerre (#17151)
* GegenbauerC
* HermiteH
* JacobiP

Also the Dirichlet Eta function which however is not holonomic.
