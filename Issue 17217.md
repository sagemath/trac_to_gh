Issue created by migration from Trac.

This is a metaticket listing *existing* functions for which symbolic implementations are urgently needed because
 * they exist in Sympy, Maxima, or Fricas symbolically, and might be returned as result
 * they belong to the holonomic repertoire

special:
 * Airy functions (#12455)
 * elliptic modular j-function (#15354)
 * Kummer confluent hypergeometric functions (#14896)
 * spherical Bessel and Hankel functions (#15024)

combinatorial:
 * Bell numbers
 * Bernoulli numbers
 * Catalan numbers
 * Fibonacci(n), general Lucas(u,v)
 * subfactorial

polynomial (metaticket #16670):
 * Legendre P,Q (#16813)
 * Laguerre (#17151)
 * GegenbauerC
 * HermiteH
 * JacobiP

Also the Dirichlet Eta function which however is not holonomic.
