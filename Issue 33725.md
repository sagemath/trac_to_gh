# Issue 33725: wrong sign for value of Legendre polynomial at 0

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33962

Keywords: orthogonal polynomial, legendre polynomial, pynac

As discussed in [this sage-devel thread](https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/ES00LNWv6DQ/m/YLPkmAxRAgAJ), `legendre_P(n, 0)` should be negative when `n` is congruent to 2 modulo 4, but sagemath returns a positive value:

```
sage: [legendre_P(n, 0) for n in range(0, 10, 2)]
[1, 1/2, 3/8, 5/16, 35/128]
```

The correct values are `[1, -1/2, 3/8, -5/16, 35/128]`. (The signs should alternate when restricted to even values of `n`.)


This is a pynac bug. It only arises in the code branch where `n` is an integer variable, so we get the correct values when `n` is real:

```
sage: [QQ(legendre_P(RR(n), 0)) for n in range(0, 10, 2)]
[1, -1/2, 3/8, -5/16, 35/128]
```

Follow-up ticket: #33963. The patch does not solve the problem when `n` is a symbolic variable, rather than an explicit integer.

LGTM overall. Just a small change to the doc formatting:

```diff
-    TESTS::

-        # verify that :trac:`33962` is fixed
+    Verify that :trac:`33962` is fixed::

         sage: [legendre_P(n, 0) for n in range(-10, 10)]
         [0, 35/128, 0, -5/16, 0, 3/8, 0, -1/2, 0, 1,
-        1, 0, -1/2, 0, 3/8, 0, -5/16, 0, 35/128, 0]
+         1, 0, -1/2, 0, 3/8, 0, -5/16, 0, 35/128, 0]
```

Once changed, you can set a positive review on my behalf.
