As discussed in [this sage-devel thread](https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/ES00LNWv6DQ/m/YLPkmAxRAgAJ), `legendre_P(n, 0)` should be negative when `n` is congruent to 2 modulo 4, but sagemath returns a positive value:

```
sage: [legendre_P(n, 0) for n in range(0, 10, 2)]
[1, 1/2, 3/8, 5/16, 35/128]
```

The correct values are `[1, -1/2, 3/8, -5/16, 35/128]`. (The signs should alternate when restricted to even values of `n`.)


This is a pynac bug. It only arises in the code branch where `n` is an integer variable, so we get the correct values when `n` is real:

```
sage: [QQ(legendre_P(RR(n), 0)) for n in range(0, 10, 2)]
[1, -1/2, 3/8, -5/16, 35/128]
```
