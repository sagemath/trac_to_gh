I've submitted a pull request to IPython that would allow us to raise SyntaxErrors properly instead of the hack at #14961. See https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/4089

Not sure if that is related, but the following syntax error is not caught by #14961 and makes sage 6.2 crash:


```python
R.<x> = #crashes when pressing <Enter>
```


The crash does not happen if there is no space after the equal sign though.
