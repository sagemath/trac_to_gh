Your are certainly right, apologies for not seeing that. I had thought that you were avoiding points of finite order just to stay away from the kernel.  It would have been nice to have had a comment to the effect that "if two isogenies agree on a point of infinite order then they must be equal", just as you explained, but never mind.

Thanks a lot for your time!

One question: Did you look at the entire diff including #32502, or just the changes made on top of #32502? In the first case, I think you can also set #32502 to "positive review".
