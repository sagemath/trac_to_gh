... just for recording the corresponding names of system packages.
This is to make testing commands such as `tox -e local-homebrew-macos-standard-python3.7` more automated.

Python 3.x distro package name guesses for

- Arch Linux, Cygwin, Debian, Fedora, FreeBSD,
  Homebrew, MacPorts, OpenSUSE.

Some Python 3.10 names might need a "-devel"
decoration or not be available yet.

Missing:

- Conda, Gentoo, Nix, Slackware, Void Linux.

This can now be tested using commands such as `tox -e docker-ubuntu-bionic-standard-python3.7`

Some of the system package info needs more work -- for the above command I am getting this error:
