sage.combinat.partition.PartitionsInBox(h, w) is the combinatorial class of partitions that fit in a h by w box. Therefore, PartitionsInBox(h,w).list() is supposed to return a list of Partitions. However, if h=0, it returns [[]] (a list containing a list) instead of [Partition([])] (a list containing a Partition).


Example (with Sage 4.6.2 and sage-combinat):

sage: type(PartitionsInBox(0,0)[0])
<type 'list'>

while we should have:
sage: type(PartitionsInBox(0,0)[0])
<class 'sage.combinat.partition.Partition_class'>

I am going to add a patch in the Mercurial queue to fix this.
