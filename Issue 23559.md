This makes a few changes to Sage to allow it to be compatible with both PARI stable 2.9.3, as well as PARI git master.

The main change is one call to `ellwp()`, where the current PARI version returns a value which is a factor 2 too small. Interestingly, Sage compensates for this by using a wrong formula later, to get correct results anyway.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23796
