This is so we can define methods that require rational data in `Polyhedron_QQ`.

All tests pass on the base classes files and the library of polytopes.

LGTM, once the bot gives the green light, I'll change it to positive review.

Any idea why it does not build on the bot?

As far as I can see, the build failed because of an unrelated error (upstream package lrslib-062+autotools-2017-03-03.tar.gz not present on mirrors -- this seems to have been fixed since)

The last bot test passed on 7.6.rc0. This looks good to me.
