Ah... the unicode rabbit hole.


Superscripts that actually have glyphs on typical systems:

Using `⁻` and `₋` you can print negative integers too

Yes, I should support negative numbers. Since fractions are easy for superscripts, I added that. For now, I will leave off the rest as I don't need them for my current purposes. However, they will likely be good to add eventually.
