# Issue 8169: include TOPCOM

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/8169

Original creator: vbraun

Original creation time: 2010-02-03 12:11:31

Assignee: AlexGhitza

CC:  mhampton novoselt

TOPCOM is a C++ program for triangulating polyhedra. More generally, it can find a single triangulation as well as enumerate all triangulations of a "point configuration", that is, the convex hull of points in euclidean space such that all vertices of simplices of the triangulation are in the given (finite) list of points.

One problem with the upstream distribution is that it statically links many helper programs, yielding almost 200mb of binaries. Therefore, I suggest the following:

 - dynamically link TOPCOM via libtools to reduce size
 - Write a sage<->TOPCOM interface at sage.geometry.triangulation.py

As an initial submission, my libtoolized TOPCOM spkg is here:

http://www.stp.dias.ie/~vbraun/TOPCOM-0.16.2.spkg

and a first draft of triangulation.py is attached. The basic usage is


```
sage: points = PointConfiguration([[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[1,1],[-1,-1]]);
sage: points
A point configuration in QQ^2 consisting of 5 points.
sage: triang = points.triangulate()   # find one triangulation       
sage: triang
A triangulation in QQ^2 consisting of 4 simplices.
sage: triang.plot(axes=False)                                        
```


After we confirm that the libtoolized TOPCOM builds on all sage platforms, I'll contact upstream for eventual inclusion of the autotools sources.

Note: see #8115 for a modified cddlib (required by TOPCOM) that provides a non-static cddlib library.

This looks great.  I looked into TOPCOM briefly but because of its size and some build issues I gave up thinking about it.  I don't have time to review this week, but I will try to take a look at it soon.

Thanks to a contribution by Josh Whitney we can now compute volumes and the secondary polytope.

Still todo: the TOPCOM spkg crashes when checking for coherency/regularity of a triangulation, investigating...

I fixed the segfaulting regularity check, it works for me now. Updated spkg is here:

Also, doctests now all pass in the updated triangulation.py

Updated patch for timeout issue


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2010-08-09 19:42:12

The previous version would raise `pexpect.TIMEOUT` after 30 seconds of computation. The new version will unconditionally wait for the computation to end. 

Whoever is interested in using it can now either apply `trac_8169_triangulate_using_TOPCOM.patch` or manually load the `triangulation.py` code as before.

I get the following error when trying to install the spkg on a mac (10.5.8):

The `patches/autogenerated/m4` directory had symlinks to `/usr` instead of copies, this probably caused the build failure on OSX. I guess all previous users had `automake-1.11` already... I've updated the spkg, can you try the updated spkg at http://www.stp.dias.ie/~vbraun/Sage/spkg/TOPCOM-0.16.2.p2.spkg

Comment by mhampton created at 2010-08-14 16:22:34

Great! That fixed it.  Patch applies fine too (to sage-4.5.2).

I get the following coverage issues, which I would be happy to work on if you don't mind:


```
SCORE devel/sage-p1/sage/geometry//triangulation.py: 66% (14 of 21)

Missing documentation:
	 * __len__(self):
	 * _TOPCOM_points(self):
	 * liststring(container, conversion=str):


Missing doctests:
	 * __iter__(self):
	 * __getitem__(self, i):
	 * __init__(self, points, projective=False):
	 * _repr_(self):


Possibly wrong (function name doesn't occur in doctests):
	 * _render_2d(triangulation, **kwds):
	 * _render_3d(triangulation, **kwds):
	 * _repr_(self):
```

Comment by mhampton created at 2010-08-14 18:46:20

I'm getting lots of doctest failures; I think most of them are because points2placingtriang doesn't work:


```
(sage subshell) thorn:bin mh$ ./points2placingtriang
Bus error
```


I didn't see any errors relating to this during compilation; not sure what is going on.

Comment by drkirkby created at 2010-08-14 23:02:57

A few comments. 
 * There appears to be no code for 64-bit builds on systems which don't default to 64-bit, but want it. Take a look at spkg-install of the latest GSL library for an example how to do it. 
 * There's no spkg-check file. It is possible to add one? I note you delete the examples, but often those can be used in tests of the package. 
 * You appear to copy over configure.ac, but no configure script. Is that intentional? Whilst I agree configure.ac is the preferred usage over configure.in, I'm not sure its actually worth patching that. I think the patch will cause more confusion. If you have actually patched the file, then sure, call it configure.ac. But in that case the configure script will need to be updated too. 
 * Since we don't ship GMP, I think the dependencies should list MPIR rather than GMP, or at least have a note like "MPIR (used in Sage instead of GMP)"

Comment by vbraun created at 2010-08-14 23:31:41

I'll try to add the 64-bit stuff and a spkg-check. The examples are huge (the upstream distribution is 22M gzipped), but we probably should keep some for the check. 

Since the intention is to eventually move the changes upstream I would prefer to move the deprecated `configure.in` to `configure.ac`. We do copy `patches/autogenerated/configure` over the configure script.

As for the bus error, I don't have a OSX machine to test on. But running points2placingtriangs in gdb and producing a stack trace would probably help.

Replying to [comment:11 vbraun]:
> I'll try to add the 64-bit stuff and a spkg-check. The examples are huge (the upstream distribution is 22M gzipped), but we probably should keep some for the check. 

I think we should keep them *all* for the check myself if they can be used in a check. The problem with the doc tests is that they test so little really in most cases. 

> Since the intention is to eventually move the changes upstream I would prefer to move the deprecated `configure.in` to `configure.ac`. We do copy `patches/autogenerated/configure` over the configure script.

I must have missed that.

William will give you access to bsd.math I expect. That runs OS X.

Comment by novoselt created at 2010-09-10 03:53:50

I do not plan to review this ticket since it involves a package, but I'll allow myself some critical remarks anyway ;-)

 1. Module level description is probably not what it was supposed to be ("all vertices of points" does not quite make sense).
 1. It would be nice to explain what's the point of using projective coordinates even when the input is affine.
 1. I think it is counter-intuitive that iterating over a point configuration deals with projective coordinates and over its points - affine ones. If the default input is affine, I think that default iterating also should be over affine version with `points(projective=True)` returning projective coordinates.
 1. I personally don't like getting generators as output of methods like `points` and people less familiar with Python find it quite confusing. So I think it would be better to return a tuple (or a list, if it is not cached) and obtain a generator either using something like `point_generator()` method or by passing an optional argument like `points(generator=True)`. I understand that generators are more efficient, but when efficiency is an issue users should be willing to work a little harder to get them, while for interactive work and new users tuples and lists are more convenient.
 1. I like the interface to restricting type of triangulations, but it would be nice for each restricting function to have a precise definition of the corresponding triangulation type.

P.S. My previous attempts to install and use TOPCOM didn't succeed, but with Volker's package installation was completely painless. So I hope that it will make its way into Sage in the near future!


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2010-09-10 11:55:30

4. I think thats fine with points, but triangulations should default to a generator. Almost always there will be a lot of them and we should train the user to not create an unpacked list of them all :-)

Other TODO's:

  6. If the point configuration is not full-dimensional TOPCOM will refuse to work. We should keep an internal auxiliary copy of the point configuration on the spanned hyperplane.

  7. Implement the basic edge traversal algorithm on the secondary polytope without resorting to TOPCOM, hence making TOPCOM optional :-) This would really help in getting the triangulation code into Sage, I think.


---

Comment by novoselt created at 2010-09-10 14:31:47

4. Good point, let triangulations be implemented as a generator. Looking at a list of triangulations is not enlightening anyway (in their default repr-output, that is).

 7. In what sense it will make TOPCOM optional? If you already have both the point configuration and its secondary polytope?


---

Comment by mhampton created at 2010-09-11 14:02:35

I will post a patch improving the coverage sometime today (US Central time).

I am wondering what the point of the function "liststring" is in the _TOPCOM_points method.  Seems like overkill to make this function given the very limited way its used.  

I still haven't fixed the build on OS X; on the TOPCOM page it says "The current version compiles successfully under Darwin gcc-4.0 and gcc-4.2 if you choose the -m32 or -m64 architecture manually for all libraries." - which maybe means that we need to add such flags somewhere.  I am not good with build issues though.


---

Comment by mhampton created at 2010-09-11 19:28:45

I think this is a bug in the secondary polytope code, maybe from the optional argument reduce_dimension not being set correctly in the LatticePolytope call.


```
c = polytopes.n_cube(3)
p = PointConfiguration(c.vertices())
p.secondary_polytope()
```


...this results in:


```
RuntimeError: Error executing "poly.x -fv" for a polytope sequence!
Output:
poly.x: Vertex.c:613: Finish_Find_Equations: Assertion `_V->nv<64' failed.
Aborted
```


A similar command with an octahedron instead of a cube works fine.


---

Comment by mhampton created at 2010-09-11 19:32:55

Oops, I don't think my initial guess about the above problem was correct, since the octahedron secondary polytope is also in a larger ambient dimension.  Would it be OK to switch the secondary polytope to a Polyhedron instead of a lattice polytope?


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2010-09-11 21:40:10

Yes, the secondary polytope needs to be returned as a Polyhedron to avoid the dimension and #of point restrictions of PALP.


---

Comment by mhampton created at 2010-09-11 22:21:49

I was checking some things from the TOPCOM examples, and this seems odd:

```
sage: q = [[0,0,0,0,0,1],[1,1,1,1,1,1],[2,4,8,16,32,1],[3,9,27,81,243,1],[4,16,64,256,1024,1],[5,25,125,625,3125,1],[6,36,216,1296,7776,1],[7,49,343,2401,16807,1],[8,64,512,4096,32768,1],[9,81,729,6561,59049,1],[10,100,1000,10000,100000,1]]
sage: p = PointConfiguration(q)
sage: t = p.triangulations_list()
sage: len(t)
0
```


This is a 5-dimensional point configuration with 11 points.  Shouldn't it have some triangulations?


---

Comment by mhampton created at 2010-09-11 22:51:38

Here's a simpler example with similar problems.


```
sage: p = [[0,0,0,1],[0,3,0,1],[3,0,0,1],[0,0,1,1],[0,3,1,1],[3,0,1,1],[1,1,2,1]]
sage: pc = PointConfiguration(p)
sage: t = pc.triangulations_list()
sage: len(t)
0
```


And this blows up:


```
sage: pc.restrict_to_nonregular_triangulations()
sage: t = pc.triangulations_list()
```


Is this the same problem that is noted by the line:
# TOPCOM bug: points2alltriangs --nonregular does not work
?


---

Comment by mhampton created at 2010-09-11 23:07:26

OK, I have to work on some other things now.  I didn't finish adding doctests to some of the restrict_to_* functions since I am a little stymied by failures.  My current version is:
[http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mhampton/triangulation_mh1.py](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mhampton/triangulation_mh1.py)


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2010-09-12 00:25:35

As a general PSA: please use the `pc.triangulate(verbose=True)` option when reporting bugs. 

  * Your problem is point number 6. above. 
  * Indeed, `points2alltriangs --nonregular` segfaults (as indicated by my comments in the source). There is a workaround already in place. But thats not the reason why it blows up in your example.

I'll work on it later today.

I've dealt with 3. and 4. in comment 15, and 6. in comment 16. Now generally tuples instead of lists are returned, and a new `class Point` is added which has methods for affine, projective, or reduced (with linearities removed) coordinates. This should also fix Marshall's problems.

Now `PointConfiguration`/`Triangulation` have a Parent/Element relationship. In particular, the `PointConfiguration` is unique and immutable. The `restrict_to_...` interface for restricting the admissible triangulations has been slightly changed, and now returns a *new* `PointConfiguration`. I think that also fits better with the general Sage philosophy.

Comment by vbraun created at 2010-09-16 11:29:49

I've split off a self-contained triangulation module into #9918. This ticket will focus on getting the TOPCOM spkg build on all platforms. In particular, OSX seems to be broken at the moment. 

I still don't have access to an OSX machine, but will get this sorted out eventually...

Comment by vbraun created at 2010-09-26 16:16:25

Ok, I got a Mac OS X machine (10.6.4, 64 bit) and TOPCOM compiles and runs fine, including the regular/nonregular checks. In particular, I don't get the "bus error". I also don't get the segfault with the nonregularity check any more. Marshall, can you try again? 

All I did was refresh the automake files, maybe there was a bug in the older autotools that got fixed? I did upgrade from Fedora 12 -> Fedora 13 in the meantime.

In any case, doctests pass on OS X and Fedora 13 x86_64

The warnings are ok except for the "cannot open m4/ltoptions.m4"; This looks like you have the old version where I had not correctly packaged the m4/ directory. The current TOPCOM spkg should be 766185 bytes long. Can you double check that?

OK, sorry about that.  I had some older versions lying around and mistakenly installed one of those.  The new one seems to build fine, but after installing 9918 it doesn't seem to work.  The first doctest failure looks like this:

I tried installing the patch for this ticket but it seems to conflict with the one at 9918.  Are these out of sync now?  Sorry for my confusion.

Comment by mhampton created at 2010-09-26 19:17:32

I tried directly running points2facets from $SAGE_LOCAL/bin and got this:

```
sage-4-x: local/bin/points2facets 
dyld: Library not loaded: /Users/mh/sagestuff/sage-4.6.alpha0/local/lib/libgmpxx.3.dylib

  Reason: image not found
Trace/BPT trap
```


I had renamed my sage folder from "sage-4.6.alpha0" to "sage-4-x" after upgrading to 4.6.alpha1, and apparently that is causing some problems.  So I'll try this again with a cleaner 4.6.alpha1 but that will take me a while.

Thanks for testing!

The precise version of the sage<->TOPCOM interface in #9918 should not matter. Of course you need *some* version, or there is no interface.

In case anyone else wants to give it a try: Since TOPCOM compiled correctly it should work.

To be more precise in my question:  should I ignore the patch http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/attachment/ticket/8169/trac_8169_triangulate_using_TOPCOM.patch if I install the patch from #9918?

Either patch should work should work for testing the TOPCOM spkg. You can't install both of them as they definitely conflict. If you have a choice, I would recommend using the newer one at #9918.

I started with sage-4.6.alpha1 compiled from source on OS X 10.5.  After cloning I installed the TOPCOM package and the patch from 9918.  Everything seemed to compile OK with TOPCOM.

If I try to run one of the TOPCOM programs in $SAGE_ROOT/local/bin, I get a "bus error".  If I do "sage -sh" and try again, it seems to work.  But if I test geometry/triangulation/base.pyx or triangulation/point_configuration.py, everything fails.  So I think there is some sort of linking issue here.

That sounds strange; can you post the output of `otool -L points2alltriangs` before running `sage -sh` (when you get the bus error) and `gcc --version`?

OK, here it is:


```

Sounds like it should work? Is this on `bsd.math`? Trying to debug this via trac is painfull... Maybe you can post a stack backtrace from gdb?

This works for me now on OS X 10.5.  Works for OS X 10.6 and linux, so I think this is OK for an optional spkg.
