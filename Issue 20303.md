Manually checked all changes, LGTM. As soon as the patchbot confirms, this is a positive review.

IMO, I think it would be better to not convert the print to tuples with, e.g.,

```
print((i, g^i, (g^i).value()))
```

but instead

```
print("{} {} {}".format(i, g^i, (g^i).value()))
```

However, I don't hold a very strong opinion on this.

Thought about it for a moment when reviewing, but I am fine with any variant. Feel free to change it.

Yes, I understand. This is merely an esthetic detail, I would say.

But there is already a large number of tickets, and still more (and larger) to be done. Maybe we can be happy enough with something that works ?

It seems that this ticket is going to be more complicated than the others of the same kind. One probably has to remove some of the future imports introduced here, in order not to break doctests all over the place.
