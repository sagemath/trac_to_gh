# Issue 21060: Ideals in a polynomial ring don't have meaningful hashes

Keywords: hashing, polynomial rings, ideals

This came up in the course of addressing #20511:

```
sage: R.<x,y,z> = PolynomialRing(QQ, 3)
sage: hash(R.ideal([x]))
0
sage: hash(R.ideal([x,y]))
0
```

But hashing for individual polynomials is itself broken (see #21272 and #21284), so probably best to fix that first.
