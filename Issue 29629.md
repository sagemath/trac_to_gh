in this example a closest vector in L is not in L: 

```
sage: from sage.modules.free_module_integer import IntegerLattice
....: L0 = matrix(ZZ,[[20957228, -4966110],[ 9411844, 19625639]])
....: L = IntegerLattice(L0)
....: v0 = vector([-423434678248195, -18882583298608161305227077482])
....: cv = L.closest_vector(v0)
....: print(cv in L)
....: 
False
```

Hi, I'm the person who came up with these examples. I can be sure that it is not only about membership testing. I've checked my examples with Smith normal form and indeed some of the closest vectors returned is not in L. So both membership and closest_vector are broken.

~~this is the same vector as computed by Sage code in the ticket description, oops. So the bug may be narrowed to fp(y)lll.~~

This vector is different from what Sage outputs, namely 

```
(-423434671769860, -18882583298608161305225815339)
```

and may be verified to be in L by calling libgap, say, or just
directly:

```
sage: vector((-423434681577544, -18882583298608161305224294058)) in L
True
```


Note a comment on https://github.com/fplll/fpylll/issues/124 which says that the basis should be LLL-reduced for this to work correctly.

rather, Sage has a different implementation --- which seems to be unchanged since 2015 (i.e. much before Sage 8.5...)

```

The containment is "broken", as the 1x2 matrix `coef*bMat` fails to be coersed to a vector.
Namely, with the example in the 

```
sage: vector(coef)*bMat in L
True
sage: vector(coef*bMat) in L
True
sage: coef*bMat in L
False
sage: M=matrix([1,1])
sage: M*bMat in L
False
```


so this is not really a bug, it's just a conversion issue, absence of automatic conversion.
