# Issue 18644: Remove comparison boilerplate - part 1

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18881

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2015-07-11 21:30:07

Now that #18329 is merged, we can remove

```
    def __richcmp__(left, right, int op):
        return (<Element>left)._richcmp(right, op)

    def __cmp__(left, right):
        return (<Element>left)._cmp(right)
```


Since there are a lot of changes like this to be made, this ticket only does part of them (in directories where just a few changes needed to be made).
