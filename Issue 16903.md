# Issue 16903: Remove usage of deprecated scipy.linalg.expm2 and expm3

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: aapitzsch

Original creation time: 2014-10-12 20:26:06

`scipy.linalg.expm2` and `scipy.linalg.expm3` have been deprecated in Scipy 0.13 [0] and will be removed in a later release. Therefore remove both from sage.

Are you missing an `or order is not None`?

I can't reproduce this error. But when I add `# tol 1e-15` I get

```
sage -t --long --warn-long 39.1 src/sage/matrix/matrix_double_dense.pyx

I don't see any difference between _Expected_ and _Got_.
Except for `...` and `851` which should be fine.

P.S. I merged recent origin/develop into my local copy of this branch

That's the problem. The `# tol` framework doesn't handle the case where numbers are covered by `...` (and the `851` is indeed a number)

You could do

```
sage: E = A.exp(algorithm='eig')
doctest:...: DeprecationWarning: The algorithm and order arguments are deprecated.
See http://trac.sagemath.org/17140 for details.
sage: E  # tol 1-15e

```

I know this is really a detail, but this looks manually edited with the strange alignment:

```
