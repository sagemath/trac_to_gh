This change will produce slightly different output:

```diff
-                print "term counting of second summand was wrong!",P2.nterms
+                print("term counting of second summand was wrong!", P2.nterms)
```

IMO, the easiest way to fix this would be

```
print("term counting of second summand was wrong!" + str(P2.nterms))
```
