[Pygments](http://pygments.org/) is the syntax highlighter used by Sphinx to highlight the documentation.  Currently, we ship version 0.11.1 of Pygments which has no Cython support, the latest upstream version does support Python.  I think this is a good reason to upgrade Pygments.

The Sage documentation looks much more beautiful now, especially Cython code blocks that have been specially designated to use Cython code highlighting. I love the demonstration of how to highlight a Cython code block. I'm OK with the patch to Pygments 1.3.1; the patch is small enough to be easily understood.
