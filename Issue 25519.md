Converting symbolic products from Sage expression to sympy's fail because [sympy expects](http://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/concrete.html#sympy.concrete.products.Product) two arguments `Product(k, (k, 1, n))` and instead we have:


```sage
sage: var("n,k")
(n, k)
sage: f = product(factorial(k)*k^7,k,1,n)
sage: f._sympy_()
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
[snip]
ValueError: Invalid limits given: (k, 1, n)
```


Note that sums do work:

```sage
sage: g = sum(factorial(k)*k^7,k,1,n)
sage: g._sympy_()
sum(k**7*factorial(k), k, 1, n)
```

Also fails:

```sage
sage: product(factorial(k)*k^7,k,1,n, algorithm="sympy")
sage: sum(factorial(k)*k^7,k,1,n, algorithm="sympy")
```


The bug might come from `symbolic_sum` and `symbolic_product` in `src/sage/calculus/calculus.py`.

One possible solution might be implementing `_sympy_()` methods in `src/sage/functions/other.py` for `Function_sum` and `Function_prod`.
