```
G = Graph();
G.allow_multiple_edges(True);
#edges are (u,v,l), where (u,v) is the edge and l is the label, which determines edge order
G.add_edges([(0,1,1),(1,5,2),(5,3,3),(5,2,4),(2,4,5),(0,2,6),(0,3,7),(0,4,8),(0,5,9)]);
g = G.tutte_polynomial();
print g(1,1);
print G.spanning_trees_count();

produces

T(1,1): 60
Number of spanning trees: 52
```
