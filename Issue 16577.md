This, it seems, gives only the filename, e.g. integer.pyx.  Is it possible to modify the profiling so that we get the full path?

I investigated on this. It's not an issue of cProfile. Rather Cython must be changed. Line 688 of Cython/Compiler/ModuleNode.py one has to put os.path.abspath. Such a change would be really useful for citation management. How big, do you think, are chances that we have a downstream patch or upstream accepts such a change?

That's a nice suggestion, and we should indeed include such a note.

For citation management (re)compiling Sage is probably too much of a burden. This will exclude everybody with a system-wide Sage installation, for starters.
