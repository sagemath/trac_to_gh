Currently, an instance of `OpenInterval` just belongs to the category of smooth manifolds even though it is also connected. Same for Euclidean spaces and spheres.

The category of connected manifolds will be joined.

Part of metaticket #30189.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31243

It would be easier just to call the `Connected()` on the category:

```diff
-        category = Manifolds(RR).Smooth() & Manifolds(RR).Connected()
+        category = Manifolds(RR).Smooth().Connected()
```

```diff
-                       TopologicalSpaces().Compact() & Manifolds(RR).Connected()
+                       TopologicalSpaces().Compact().Connected()
