# Issue 28889: Add a lmfdb_page function for number fields

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29126

Original creator: alexjbest

Original creation time: 2020-01-31 20:36:59

Keywords: lmfdb

In #21533 a convenience function was added to elliptic curves to open the corresponding page on the lmfdb which can contain information which is non-trivial to recompute in sage on the fly.

This ticket adds the corresponding thing for number fields.

Suggestions for other objects both in Sage and the LMFDB where something similar could be added would be great and can be added to this ticket.

you should use "https" everywhere, if it works

It does work. But I believe http redirects to https.

This does not work at all on python3-sage:

```
AttributeError: module 'urllib' has no attribute 'quote'
```

Are you using the most recent sage for development, as strongly advised ?

Here is a better branch, working with sage 9.0. If you agree, you can set to positive

I'm a little confused what is different in my sage install, I based it off 9.1beta2 according to my git log, maybe I should have make distcleaned or something. But if the patchbots happy I will set positive.

The command "banner()" tells you if you are running python2 or python3.
