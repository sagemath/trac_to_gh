Please note that Sage 3.0.alphaX will contain updated flint-1.06 spkgs, so this will likely need to be rebased vs. that spkg.

Cheers,

Michael

I am closing this as invalid. We should only ship stable versions of flint unless there is a very compelling argument to the contrary.  See ticket #3523 for a stable version.
