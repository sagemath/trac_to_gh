Just in case you haven't changed it yet, in line five of the docstring for `universal_polynomials` it should read:


```
`[e_i, e_j] = \tau_{ij}^a e_a` is given by
```


It's missing the second ```

Also, the definition in the docstring does not seem to coincide with equation (6) in the reference. In the paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.00711.pdf the definition of the universal polynomials in this case is


```
 P_{aij} = \sum_{u \in I} \tau_{ij}^u X_{au}
                - \sum_{s,t \in I} \tau_{st}^a X_{si} X_{tj},
```


as opposed to the current:


```
 P_{aij} = \sum_{u \in I} \tau_{ij}^u X_{au}
                - \sum_{s,t \in I} \tau_{st}^a X_{ai} X_{tj},
```

The issue in comment:3 is only a typo in the docstring, the code seems fine.

Finally, don't you have a problem reading your variables if the dimension of the Lie algebra is >10?

The rest looks good to me.

Good point about the variable names. I have fixed this and the other two typos.

ran it in my bot and came back green, I don't know why you would want different naming schemes for Lie algebras of different dimensions, but either way this looks fine to me. If I'm allowed to be a reviewer you can put a positive review on my behalf.

Replying to [comment:7 heluani]:

I want the more compact version for the variables when the dimension is small. The larger dimensions was just to remove the ambiguity.

Yes you most certainly are. Just put in your full name as the reviewer and you can set the positive review.
