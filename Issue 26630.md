I get a few doctest failures:

```
sage -t --warn-long 53.7 src/sage/algebras/lie_algebras/lie_algebra_element.pyx
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/algebras/lie_algebras/lie_algebra_element.pyx", line 496, in sage.algebras.lie_algebras.lie_algebra_element.LieAlgebraElementWrapper.__iter__

    sorted(x)
Expected:
    [((2,3), 1), ((1,2), 1), ((1,3), 1),
     ((1,2,3), 1), ((1,3,2), 1), ((), 2)]
Got:
    [((), 2), ((2,3), 1), ((1,2), 1), ((1,2,3), 1), ((1,3,2), 1), ((1,3), 1)]
**********************************************************************
```

This is with Python 2. I get a similar failure in `sage/categories/finitely_generated_semigroups.py`. Is the sorting different with Python 2 vs. Python 3? I'm not sure how to fix that. There are others that can be fixed with this change:

Apologies, I have been too fast in setting to needs_review.. I'm still building 8.5.rc0, so that I could not test my changes. Indeed, this should be easily fixed, by changing the results in the newly sorted doctests, and making your other fix.

should be ready now. The modified doctests also work on python3.

Failed example:
    sorted(S.some_elements(), key=str)
Expected:

Got:

```


'yxz' is not generated in py3 we got 'zxy' instead.

Remove assignee vklein.

Side Note:
If keeping `on_generators` info is interesting, using pprint.pformat work well for these cases.

I just undid the problematic change, kept for another ticket

Comment by chapoton created at 2018-12-13 16:43:20

I have been told not to use pprint from pformat by Volker in #26628, but he was not very clear about what one should use instead..


---

Comment by vklein created at 2018-12-13 17:20:11

It's not very clear for me either.

Anyway as you confirmed (by setting the ticket in need_review) that the `ValueError` message is fine without `on_generators`, i will review it as it is.

ok. The bot is green, but there is a red plugin for "iteritems". I am not sure about that

Changing status from needs_review to positive_review.


---

Comment by vklein created at 2018-12-14 09:26:55

I suspect the red plugin for "iteritems" just comes from "dict.iteritems" removal in python3. The plugin don't analyse that iteritems is defined in `FreeModuleElement`.

Resolution: fixed

This tickets were closed as fixed after the Sage 8.5 release.
