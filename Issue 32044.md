We install a modern gcc, but without modern binutils we get a lot of errors like this:

```
  [nauty-27r1.p1]   /tmp/cch93yUy.s:4216: Error: no such instruction: `vmovdqu8 (%rbx),%xmm3'
  [nauty-27r1.p1]   /tmp/cch93yUy.s:4218: Error: no such instruction: `vmovdqu8 %xmm3,(%rcx)'
  [nauty-27r1.p1]   /tmp/cch93yUy.s:4220: Error: no such instruction: `vmovdqu8 -16(%rbx,%rax),%xmm4'
```

So we should probably drop this configuration (added in #31526) from the CI

This approach is fine. A different apporach is to compile with `SAGE_FAT_BINARY` which might be a solution here. However, I don't know if it is worth it for such old systems.

Let's not do that, it's getting too complicated
