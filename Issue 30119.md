CC:  dimpase

Added a function `distance_regular_graph` with the purpose to build distance-regular graphs given their intersection array. At the moment we grouped only the sporadic constructions and serious existence checks are only done via the external package https://github.com/jaanos/sage-drg.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30356

I will add more constructions to this function later on.
Now I'm mainly concerned with how to handle the drg package.
