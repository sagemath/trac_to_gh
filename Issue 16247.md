Do you have some links for examples of syntax or functionality from other programs?  That could be helpful to anyone trying to do this - right now it's somewhat vague.  I like the idea.

I had in mind the same syntax as for plot3d (up to the obvious adaptations), so that one could write dimension-agnostic code whenever possible. Here are some things you can do with them:

```
sage: p =  plot3d(lambda x, y: x^2 + y^2, (-2,2), (-2,2))
sage: p.translate(<vector>)
sage: p.rotateX(<angle>)
sage: p.scale(3)
sage: p.transform(rotate=..., scale=..., translate=...)
sage: p.transform(<matrix>)
sage: p.transform(<transformation>) # haven't checked that but would be natural
```


By the way: the documentation of Plot3d.transform does not make it clear that one can pass in a matrix; and it needs to be passed as m=<matrix>... which is not great.

But I haven't checked on matplotlib, and being consistent with it would be nice too.
