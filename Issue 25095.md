I created several tickets for the individual issues.

Ouch, there are some `is_package_installed` that should have been removed and aren't.

I'm not sure. I don't think that the `Feature` stuff is really ready to replace all `is_package_installed` checks.

You are right, those instances should be checked for whether it was over-eager removal of imports or failures to remove the call.

Since all tickets have been fixed, I guess this can be closed.
