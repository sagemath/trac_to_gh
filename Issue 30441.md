Possible improvements to `LLL_gram` after #5178.

See #5178#comment:6
and #5178#comment:20.

- Examples with noninteger entries

- Something from a class group computation

- Add optional parameter `force_orientation_preserving=True`.
  Setting it to `False` when calling the method would skip
  the last part (that checks whether the determinant is 1 or -1
  and changes the sign of the last column in case it is -1)
  and save some time.

- Maybe PARI has an option to force returning a determinant 1
  transformation matrix? If so, use it.

- Add cross-references in the documentation to/from any similar
  methods, e.g. provided by fplll.

Course notes or other materials that prompted work on #5178
might still be recovered.

But that was long ago, and the participants in that ticket
may have lost interest.

I'll set the milestone here to sage-wishlist
to avoid bumping it at each release.
