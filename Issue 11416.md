Assignee: @nathanncohen

Keywords: MixedIntegerLinearProgram, copy

It would be useful to copy a linear program, so that one doesn't have to recopy the constraints. Unfortunately, this crashes Sage, and pretty hard.

sage: eqs = MixedIntegerLinearProgram()
sage: eqs2 = copy(eqs)
sage: eqs2

------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred in Sage.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* component
of Sage has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off().
You might want to run Sage under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
Sage will now terminate (sorry).

But all in all, I got through.... Here's a patch ready for review ! Please test it extensively, as I do not know why you need to copy them for I probably did not think of enough use cases `:-)`

Yo !

It actually only failed when using the lp[x] variables instead of creating new variables and using the to define the constraints `;-)`

Patch updated.

It is better to create a new ticket as this one already has a patch and fixes a nasty bug.

> Sorry I didn't answer sooner; I thought jdemeyer would. I don't see any instance of either free() or sage_free() in the patch, so I don't know whether to mark it as positive_review. If I understand the conversation correctly, though, the original patch contained some free()'s that were not needed, but those have now been removed?

Precisely `:-)`

Interrupts.  An interrupt during `malloc()` or `free()` will likely crash Sage but `sage_malloc()` and friends contain code to block interrupts.
