Assignee: @nexttime

The following works right after extracting the Sage source tarball:

```
./sage -i /path/to/foo.spkg
```

But this doesn't work for remote packages:

```
./sage -i http://example.com/foo.spkg
```

or

```
./sage -i foo
```

Using either `wget`, `curl` or system Python, we should also make this work.

```

So we need some `sage-latest-online-package` and `sage-download_package` [replacement / wrapper] scripts in `spkg/bin/`?

(In case there's some capable system-wide Python in the user's `PATH`, the original scripts [copied to `spkg/bin/`] should already work, right?)

To not have different files with the same name (in `local/bin/` and `spkg/bin/`), we might rename the current [Python] versions to `*.py` and make `sage-{latest-online-package,download_package}` plain shell scripts (then moved to `spkg/bin/`), which just call the original Python implementation if appropriate (Sage's or some other Python available), or otherwise mimic the behavior using `wget` or `curl`.

We could probably drop the Python implementations completely in favor of Bash versions (although in theory neither `wget` nor `curl` [nor `perl`], but some `python` may be available), but as the features of these scripts are IMHO unlikely to change, we can keep parallel implementations without hassle as well.

Ok, couldn't resist to write [attachment:latest-online-spkg.sh some shell script] to replace `sage-latest-online-package`, using `curl`, `wget` or `$URL_GRABBER` instead of Python (which the shell script currently doesn't support at all), and not requiring any "Sage environment".

Do what you want with it... ;-)

Replacing `sage-download_package` like that should be even easier, I just haven't [yet] done so...

Why do you use `>&2` on line 280 in `echo >&2 "Found $PKG_NAME"`?

I just ran into a tangentially related problem: if you unpack the Sage tarball and run `./sage -i openssl....`. On a system like mark on skynet (Solaris), the system version of `patch` is stupid, so it can't apply the patches in the spkg, and the build fails. Is it worth trying to address this somehow (on another ticket, not here)? Or should we not worry about it? I'm inclined to not worry about it, personally.

With Sage's Python, hitting ctrl-c not only interrupts the download but also causes the file to be deleted: the `if` block in the following gets executed:

```sh
    sage-download-file "$PKG_URL" >"$PKG_TMP"
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
        # Delete failed download
        rm -f "$PKG_TMP"
        echo >&2 "Error: failed to download package $PKG_NAME"
        exit 1
    fi
```

But with curl, and I think wget, hitting ctrl-c dumps me out of the script entirely, so I still end up with the temporary file. What do you think about something like this:

Personally, I wouldn't worry about the non-deleting of that temporary file and just leave things as they are.  That temporary file will be overwritten anyway if the user tries to download that package again.

Concerning `patch`: one can always do

```
./sage -i patch
./sage -i openssl
```

That should work, so I wouldn't worry too much either.
