(from #33088)

In the developer guide, move "git the hard way" earlier and present "git-trac" only as an additional convenience. 
Also note that the first configuration using sagetrac-mirror is not recommended for users who use VS Code (https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33589#comment:13)

Also explain effective use of `git worktree` for Sage development

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33648
