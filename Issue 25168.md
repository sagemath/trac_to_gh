We have parsed about 15k generating functions of the OEIS sequences and as a use case, generated a few million relations. It would be great if we could include the generating functions (and maybe even the relations) in the OEIS module.
There is a simple [SageMath](SageMath) package here https://github.com/eluzhnica/oeis_gf
