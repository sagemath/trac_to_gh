Keywords: vscode pycodestyle pep8

The goal of this ticket is to configure the vscode pycodestyle linter to check against Sage's minimal style conventions:
* E111: indentation is not a multiple of four
* E306: expected 1 blank line before a nested definition, found 0
* E401: multiple imports on one line
* E701: multiple statements on one line (colon)
* E702: multiple statements on one line (semicolon)
* E703: statement ends with a semicolon
* E711: comparison to None should be ‘if cond is None:’
* E712: comparison to True should be ‘if cond is True:’ or ‘if cond:’
* E713 test for membership should be 'not in'
* E721: do not compare types, use isinstance()
* E722: do not use bare except, specify exception instead
* W605: invalid escape sequence ‘x’
