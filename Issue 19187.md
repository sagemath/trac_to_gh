In sage.ring.asymptotic_ring.AsymptoticRing there is

```
        sage: from sage.rings.asymptotic.asymptotic_ring import AsymptoticRing as AR_class
        sage: class AR(AR_class):
        ....:     class Element(AR_class.Element):
        ....:         __eq__ = AR_class.Element.has_same_summands
        sage: A = AR(growth_group='z^QQ', coefficient_ring=QQ)
        sage: from itertools import islice
        sage: TestSuite(A).run(  # not tested  # long time
        ....:     verbose=True,
        ....:     elements=tuple(islice(A.some_elements(), 10)),
        ....:     skip=('_test_some_elements',  # to many elements
        ....:           '_test_distributivity'))  # due to cancellations: O(z) != O(z^2)
```

which is marked as not tested. This is due to some failures with pickling. Correct this and enable this test.
