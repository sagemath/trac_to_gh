CC:  @yuan-zhou @novoselt

`random_element` is the standard method that Sage parents provide to produce a random element.

As the objects in `interactive_simplex_method` do not use the parent/element framework, we just make it a static method of the class.

The existing function `random_dictionary` is kept as an alias.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31307

I don't quite understand what the argument `special_probability` means (in both methods). 

I thought that in order to meet the claimed probability, one has to scale the value `special_probability` using the other variables `m`,`n` and `bound` in 

```
if special_probability < random():

I agree that it's not very clearly explained.  The docstrings make the words "is allowed to be" and "potentially" do a lot of work here.  As you can see in the code, with this probability it will allow negative lower bounds for the random b; and again (independently), with this probability it will allow positive upper bounds for the random c.

Yes, I seem to understand the code, and I agree with this simple design of randomness.

The probability `p*(1-1/2^m)` of getting infeasible dictionary and the probability `p+(1-p)/2^n` of getting dual feasible dictionary are actually close to `p` when `n,m` are large. However, the probability of getting optimal dictionary is quite off. I guess it's the hidden meaning of "potentially" that I didn't understand.
