# Issue 29751: Ring morphism does not look like a ring morphism

Using the following code, I tried to construct the Galois action on a ramified extension of Q11. However, the result does not seem to be a ring morphism.


```
S = Qp(11)
R.<a> = S.ext(x^2 - 11)
rho = R.hom([-a])
print(rho(a^(-1)) * rho(a) == 1)
```

Moving to 9.4, as 9.3 has been released.
