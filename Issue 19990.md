The Chow form associated to a projective variety is a homogeneous equation in Plucker coordinates associated to the variety. It describes the variety as a hypersurface in a Grassmannian.  It was introduced by Cayley and generalized by Chow and van der Warden.

This ticket has two tasks

- Given a projective subscheme, compute the associated Chow form

- Given a Chow form, compute the associated variety.

Chow form to variety: equations describing the variety set-theoretically can be found, but they only describe the variety scheme-theoretically if it is smooth or is a hypersurface.
