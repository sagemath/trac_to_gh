# Issue 26922: py3: fix doctests in strongly_regular_db.pyx

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27159

Original creator: dcoudert

Original creation time: 2019-01-28 13:46:49

Keywords: py3, graph

The construction of `SRG_196_91_42_42()` was not correct in py3 due to the change of behavior of `map` that is now a one time iterator.

also, mark one doctest as `py2` and `py3`.

ok. Although some other people dislike very much the use of `list(map(...))` which is indeed ugly.

If you prefer, I can rewrite it as `A = [frozenset([x + z for x in A]) for z in G]`.
