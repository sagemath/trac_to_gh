Kevin: First part is #20980, but a question about interface part:

What should be the certificate? I.e. a sublattice, a list of five elements of the sublattice, or list of three elements violating the defining property? Or a choise between those?

I thinked about this, and here is first part.

First, this is faster for almost all cases. But for small lattices with already computed meet, join and rank function this is slower. However, the speedup for, say, `BooleanLattice(10)` is big. With current code the time to check semimodularity is 4,9 seconds for first time and 0,6 seconds for second time. With this patch it drops to 0,1 seconds.

Second, this adds a `certificate`-option.

I thinked this, and I guess we should use this by-definition -certificate, and later implement `isomoprhic_sublattices()`.

I will put this to needs_review and later try to do something similar to `is_modular()` and `is_distributive()`.

Even though it's a "hidden" function, I don't think the method in `hasse_diagram.py` should be called `is_semimodular()` if it's not in some way return a boolean (either directly, or as part of a tuple along with certificate).
