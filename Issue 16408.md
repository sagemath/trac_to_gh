# Issue 16408: Restore displaying animations in notebook

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: gagern

Original creation time: 2014-07-11 07:10:33

Keywords: notebook, animate

#12827 broke display of animations, and while #16608 restored that functionality for `Animation.show()`, it remains broken for methods `Animation.gif()` and `Animation.ffmpeg()`. Based on #15515, a more complete fix is possible.

Note that only [9f30e94](http://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit/?id=9f30e9400f6fda042bf579e720ffee772c751f1e) is new for this ticket here, all the other commits listed above are parts of some already closed tickets and should end up in the develop branch pretty soon. So it is enough to review just that single commit.

`tmp_filename` is already a global in Sage, you don't need

```
sage: f = sage.misc.temporary_file.tmp_filename(ext='.png')
```

in doctests.`

Replying to [comment:6 vbraun]:
> `tmp_filename` is already a global in Sage [â€¦]

Thanks for the review, and for pointing this out. I did copy and paste that from [745a3bb](http://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit/?id=745a3bbdb8ac6499b0c650d005ab77dc1e47434f) from #12827, and addressed both instances now.
