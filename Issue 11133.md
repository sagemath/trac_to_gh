```
class CrystalPaths(AbstractCrystalPaths):
    r"""
    A crystal path is a tensor product of
    :class:`CrystalPathFactors<certain crystals>` which are a generalization
    of Kirillov Reshetikhin (KR) crystals of some affine Kac-Moody algebra.
    
    The reason they are not KR crystals is because the bijection from rigged
    configurations (RC) to crystal paths does not always generate a valid
    tableaux. In particular, for type `D_n^{(1)}` the highest weight RC's will
    correspond to Kashiwara-Nakashima crystals that are highest weight KR
    crystal `B^{r,s}` with some vertical dominos removed from the rectangle.
    The bijection constructs the full rectangle, but in general it is not
    semi-standard.

- I think the names "CrystalPaths" and "CrystalPathFactors" are not optimal. Perhaps "KirillovReshetkhinTableaux" instead of "CrystalPathFactors" as in http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.3523 and "TensorProductsOfKirillovReshetkhinTableaux" or something like this.

- Your description of Kleber trees

```
r""" 
 		Kleber trees 
 		 
 		This is a standard tree data structure implementation where the nodes 
 		store a weight and are connected to their children and their parent. 
 		However this is also an edge labeled tree and we store the end labels in 
 		the child nodes since this makes the manipulations of this Kleber's tree 
 		easier to implement. 
 		 
 		Note that iteration is done by breath-first since this is how the list is 
 		created. To do depth-first, call depth_first_iter(). 
```

is very implementation oriented. I think a brief mathematical summary would be appropriate. Say what Kleber trees are used for, how the nodes are labelled etc..

- Can you fix the method _latex_ in KleberTree line 343 and beyond?

- At the beginning of sage/combinat/rigged_configurations/rigged_configuration_element.py please give a brief description of what a rigged configuration element is (like a sequence of partitions together with labelings of the parts).

- Could you please comment on your changes to root_system/cartan_type.py and dynkin_diagram.py. Why are you making these changes?

- Last, but not least: you need to export your file so that it has the right header. The patch should also contain a summary of the changes at the top (before the code). You can achieve this by hg qrefresh -e and then writing the summary.

So much for now!

Travis incorporated all comments I made above and via e-mail. We tested his implementation of the bijection between rigged configurations and KR tableaux against a Mathematica program written by Reiho Sakamoto.

Once all tests pass, I will set a positive review!

Thanks, Travis, for your work on this!
