Keywords: Jmol 3D 3-D

Update Jmol to Jmol-14.0.11 which supplies the JSmol pure javascript version of Jmol.  Utilizing this requires significant changes to how the notebook utilizes Jmol/JSmol.  The notebook changes are in ticket  XXXX (haven't made yet).

In addition to the updates to the new-style SPKG, the tar.gz from Jmol needs to be renamed before it matches the Sage standards.  The Jmol project distributes a large number of different archives.  The appropriate one for this SPKG is the Jmol-14.0.11-binary.tar.gz, which needs to be renamed to Jmol-14.0.11.tar.gz.

This will break the current Jmol in the notebook as a serious reorganization of supporting files was required to support both java and javascript live 3-D.

Hello,

I have rebased on 6.3.rc1.

Weirdly, I do not see this problem when using a Jmol (from command line, of course) - it seems to acquire the correct info from system itself.  So in principle we don't even have to change this.

I think this is ready for positive review as long as it actually applies properly, and of course pending #16004 or some variant thereof.

This is about `SageMenu.mnu` - in the notebook Jmols it also finds this info fine until we switch to the custom one, very weird.  I'm trying to figure out where that `.mnu` file is defined but the one at the Jmol website is clearly several (major) versions out of date.

"unzip" is not one of our build-time dependencies so far: http://www.sagemath.org/doc/installation/source.html#general-requirements I'm not terribly concerned about that one, but this is why I went a different route in #17020. But if you want to require unzip then it should be documented.

Why does this ticket depend on #16004? We should merge the jmol update asap, no need to wait as long as it doesn't break something that is currently working. Anything related to jsmol can then be dealt with in #16004 if necessary.

The notebook jmol viewer is working with #17020, and I suspect it is also working with this ticket. Of course not in chrome, which has by now permanently kicked the old java applet to the curb. Works in firefox with the icedtea plugin, though.

Unless somebody objects I would propose that we make a modified tarball that does not require unzip, that is, by re-packing the upstream tarball.

Frederic, it seems that 14.2.5 is not out yet? Since you seem to know upstream, maybe you can suggest that they put jsmol uncompressed inside their archive, and not a zip-with-tar file.

Huh, that's surprising, Jonathan made it sound like the interface had changed enough that it wouldn't.  We're even having trouble with icedtea here at AIMS in any case :-(

That seems reasonable; Jonathan, did you have a reason for including that?  Maybe it's just because that's how upstream packages it...
