As reported in [this ask question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/33623/bug-in-cos-function-in-version-72/?answer=33624#post-id-33624), Sage makes wrong simplifications in symbolic trigonometry:


```
sage: cos(pi+pi*1/42)
cos(1/42*pi)
```


While it should be `-cos(1/42*pi)`.

Same with `sin(pi+pi/42)`.

I do not have intermediate versions of Sage with me, but i confirm that it is a regression since on Sage 5.12, we have:


```
sage: cos(pi+pi*1/42)
cos(43/42*pi)
sage: sin(pi+pi/42)
sin(43/42*pi)
```

No, the changes were just a few months ago, will get to it tomorrow.

More precisely, on a 7.2.beta4 version of Sage which i can reach by ssh, it works well:


```
sage: cos(pi+pi*1/42)
cos(43/42*pi)
sage: sin(pi+pi*1/42)
sin(43/42*pi)
```


So the regression is very recent, could it be due to the last update of pynac/ginac ?

Changing component from porting: Solaris to symbolics.

Almost certainly so.  See e.g. [this bug](https://github.com/pynac/pynac/issues/170), though I assume it is a different particular one.

Determined to be invalid/duplicate/wontfix (closing as "wontfix" as a catch-all resolution).
