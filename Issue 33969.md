`DESTDIR` is used twice in the `-o`.

My original spkg was always a quick and dirty job. It shouldn't be a surprise that some bugs appear.


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2022-12-07 20:08:28

I guess I should have a stab at this.


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2022-12-07 20:30:43

Way too many things are built by default. We can split the package or at least not building the big stuff that we do not need like graphblas and mongoose which are very specialised stuff.


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2022-12-07 20:40:48

I think our optional `igraph` package uses graphblas


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2022-12-07 20:53:32

That's new and graphblas wasn't built before because I had removed all the subpackages using cmake at the time the initial suitesparse was included in sage. But if it can be used, why not.

In other news, `DESTDIR` works properly in 6.0.1 after some basic testing.


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2022-12-07 21:06:26

Cannot see a dependency on GraphBLAS in igraph but if you can point to it, I'll certainly include it.


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2022-12-07 21:41:37

I am testing a first draft locally. The changes are big enough that none of the current patches actually apply or are meaningful. I will need your input for any tweaks you require for BLAS/LAPACK on OS X. It should be easy enough to figure out if something is needed.

Sorry for the noise - looks like I misremembered

Do we want to build and install static libraries?

However it builds against the Accelerate framework, not our openblas:

```

That's what I thought could happen. I think, I can make it go for openblas easily, I found the doc for it, the other day.

This is also a relatively stripped down build like boost_cropped. I probably should add a few more sub-packages if we want to really dignify it with the full "suitesparse" name. And I also should write a few comments.


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2022-12-09 22:18:23

And upstream is preparing 6.0.2. But the bump would be trivial on this branch.

This gets openblas but not the right one on my macOS system.

Failing on `centos-stream-9-python3.9-standard` (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/actions/runs/3662737597/jobs/6192051075)

```
CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:14 (cmake_minimum_required):
  CMake 3.22 or higher is required.  You are running version 3.20.2
```

This will need an increased lower bound for system cmake - increased from #34746, which set 3.11)

Can't seem to see the log from that run. What compiler is sid currently using?


---

That's gcc 12.2.0-9.1

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2022-12-11 19:01:50

Same on `debian-bookworm-minimal` (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/actions/runs/3662737597/jobs/6200588437, `docker run -it  ghcr.io/mkoeppe/sage/sage-docker-debian-bookworm-minimal-with-targets-pre:9.5-107209-g31c5448dc1-failed bash`)
and on `ubuntu-kinetic-minimal` and `fedora-36-minimal`


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2022-12-11 21:42:24

I wonder if it has to do with 

```
-- Detecting Fortran/C Interface
Failed to compile
```

When cmake is run to configure cholmod. It looks like we are trying to mix C and Fortran and it is failing.


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2022-12-11 21:47:20

While it is annoying, we could turn off the bits needing blas/lapack which seem to be the one involved here. But really I suspect there is something fishy in the compiler.

---

Comment by fbissey created at 2022-12-12 00:31:15

I am running out of ideas on what can cause this. Some compiler setting is the most obvious culprit, but what would it be. Can you get access to the docker instance to fish stuff out of it?


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2022-12-12 02:56:24

6.0.2 is just out, so I will bump that and we will see if it helps.

Yes, I think that's the problem


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2022-12-12 08:08:13

The only thing I can think about is that openblas was compiled with a different gfortran but it feels far fetched.

In one of the failing builds, I see the following in `SuiteSparse_config/build/CMakeFiles/CMakeError.log`:

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2022-12-12 08:11:20

In the failing configurations, we are using system `gcc` but our own `gfortran`. This may be a mismatch between them regarding `zstd` support.


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2022-12-12 08:15:48

Yes, it starts making much more sense.


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2022-12-12 08:17:49

But there should be other similar failures potentially - at least you would think, since this is also tested in autoconf packages as soon blas/lapack is mixed with C code.

If it works, I'll have to re-enable "supernodal" in cholmod.

In gentoo we just seem to do `make -C lib install`. Although there is also a `make -C lib libzstd.pc` during the build phase.


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2022-12-12 09:53:31

Installing `zstd` may not be enough, you may have to tell gcc's configure to use it `--with-zstd`. But really, we want to match the support from the host gcc. So, it may be more complicated to achieve.


---

gfortran is now configured correctly

Quite possible that this is needed, yes

I have given it some thoughts. bookworm and sid are the only you report failing at this stage. It looks to me that they are both using gcc-12.2.0+patches - gentoo currently similarly ship gcc-12.2.1_pre20221210, some kind of pre-release. It seems it has incompatibilities with earlier gcc/gfortran releases, at least in debian. And our gcc/gfortran is an earlier and official release. I don't see a way out of this that doesn't forbid this version of the compiler unless there are both gcc and gfortran installed.

I agree, the Debian patches are likely the cause for the incompatibility. I think the LTO data comes with a version annotation, and Debian should probably have bumped the version along with their patches.

(We also carry a patch, for macOS M1/M2 support, but I don't think it is the problem here.)
