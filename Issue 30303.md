Keywords: graph_editor

This ticket is about providing a graph editor that
works in Jupyter (Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab).

Possibly in the form of a Jupyter widget, using any
existing one if possible.

This is part of

- #29889: Metaticket: Jupyter improvements for things that were in sagenb

I cc-ed a lot of people who have had historical involvement with this topic.

If you mind, email me to un-cc you (un-cc-ing yourself would have the
opposite effect of subscribing you forever to updates on this ticket).

And if I forgot someone who wanted to be cc-ed, it's easy: just cc yourself.

Candidates could be francy, bqplot, networkx+matplotlib.
A promising one:

Some nice features would be:
* ability to disable any automatic layouting: not as annoying as an editor that keeps moving vertices while you're trying to construct a complicated graph
* ability to have a layout-only mode: if you have a graph, you might want to change the layout without accidentally changing the graph structure

Probably some more, but these are the first two I could think of.

The "CS academy" graph editor (not sure about the license -- I'm asking them)
has those features. There's a button "Force" to let some force reshape the graph,
and buttons "Draw", "Edit", "Delete", "Config" that stop the movement to let
the user edit the graph. There's also a text column on the left where one can
manually edit the graph vertices and edges.

Setting new milestone based on a cursory review of ticket status, priority, and last modification date.

Hello,

I just see this ticket.
Last year I started to (occasionally) develop a graph editor for sage using ipycanvas and ipywidgets, that can be found in the following repository:
https://gitlab.limos.fr/jfraymon/phitigra

It is not completely finished (and the code could/will be improved) but it is functional: one can draw a graph and export it, zoom in/out, change vertex colors, use layout algorithms, etc.

I did not make a ticket here to include it in sage because it depends on external libraries (ipycanvas and ipywidgets) and I thought it would be annoying to review (also it is still work in progress).

I tried to install `phitigra` and it works well with jupyter on safari/macOS 12.12.1. Quite easy to use to edit basic graphs.

Great, thank you for this addition! I'm glad to see there is interest for my graph editor.
