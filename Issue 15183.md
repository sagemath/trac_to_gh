Looks like we just need to sort this list.

The docstring says it should be sorted by last commit time, and the code looks like it does that, so sorting the output (alphabetically) is wrong. Really we should spoof the commit time using an environment variable (it is something like `GIT_COMMITTER_DATE`), rather than using `time.sleep`.

Seems like `os.environ` is ignored (at least on my system). I changed the doctest to explicitly set the environment. Otherwise, positive review.
