It's worth paying attention to the fact that Mathjax 3 is missing a significant feature that might be really critical for Sage, which is "automatic line breaking".  See the discussion here:

https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax/issues/2312#issuecomment-692695446

E.g., "So line breaking and other features will most likely have to wait until next year."  "That's the reason why nearly nobody is using MathJax 3."   etc.

I think this is very important to be aware of, and it's one reason why CoCalc doesn't use MathJax 3, and uses KaTeX by default.

To support #33600, I prepared a new package for mathjax3.

I've never done creating a spkg before and don't understand everything about this business. So please help. This is a public branch!

I used the mathjax2 spkg as a template, and managed to place a tarball in `upstream/` directory and install from it to `local/share/mathjax3` by `sage -i mathjax3`.

I thought of adding mathjax3 side by side with mathjax(2). But it seems that we don't need to keep mathjax(2) once we have mathjax3 in sage.

So now I am thinking of replacing the mathjax(2) with the new mathjax(3). Then we don't need a sage-devel discussion...

As I understand it, it is only relevant with the mathjax used with jupyter.

Presently the mathjax used by Sphinx for sage documentation is different from the mathjax used by jupyter. So we don't need to worry about the issue.

Isn't it enough to only copy the `tex-chtml.js` file from the mathjax release? It looks like this file is self-contained (hard to say as its minified).

Okay, makes sense to leave the tar untouched. What about only copying the tex-chtml file to `SAGE_SHARE` in `spkg-install.in`? This could then be easily extended to include other extensions etc if needed in the future.

Also I think the uncommented code in `spkg-src` can be safely deleted. The folder structure of the mathjax releases changed completely, so the mathjax 2 stuff is outdated. And if there is something useful in it, one could also use git history to recover it easily.

It would be "easy" only if all mathjax files are already in `local/share/mathjax`. The size of this directory only slightly increases with this ticket.

While I see no difference in the quality of typeset maths in mathjax3 docs from mathjax2 docs, I observe mathjax3 docs load slightly slower than mathjax2 docs. Do you see the same? This is strange because mathjax3 is supposed (said) to load faster than mathjax2...

I cannot confirm these performance issues. On the contrary, the mathjax 3 version seems to load faster.

According to the answer, mathjax3 is not to blame if the performance issue is ever real. It's also not clear if the performance issue really exists.

I don't know how the distro package works. Can't they change the installation script to install the package as they want, that is, into `/usr/share/mathjax`?

If they can't, would it solve the problem that the spkg tarball consists of mathjax files instead of the single directory? If we do so, then we need to touch the spkg installation procedure.
