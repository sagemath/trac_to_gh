How about an implementation with a decorator:

```python
r"""
Abstract base classes for interface elements
"""
def _add_doc():
    def wrapped(c):
        c.__doc__ = "\n Abstract base class for :class:`~sage.interfaces.gap." + c.__name__
        c.__doc__ += """
    
  This class is defined for the purpose of ``isinstance`` tests.  It should not be
  instantiated.

  EXAMPLES:

  By design, there is a unique direct subclass::

  """
        c.__doc__ += "    sage: len(sage.interfaces.abc."+c.__name__+".__subclasses__()) <= 1\n      True"
        return c
    return wrapped


@_add_doc()
class GapElement: pass


@_add_doc()
class GpElement: pass

...
```


Needless to say, docstrings etc work as they should this way. Decorator overhead - very small, if at all, IMHO.

Replying to [comment:17 Matthias Köppe]:
> Doctests are discovered by parsing files; they cannot be supplied by decorators.

Yes, they can. In fact, very easy to amend and doctest the docstring of a function:

```
$ cat d.py 
def docstr(f):
    """
    amends the docstring
    """
    f.__doc__ += """
    >>> tst(1)
    42
    """
    return f

@docstr
def tst(x):
    '''adds 1 to x
    >>> tst(0)
    1
    >>> tst(42)
    42 
    '''
    return x+1

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import doctest
    doctest.testmod()
$
$ python3 d.py 
**********************************************************************
File "/tmp/d.py", line 16, in __main__.tst

    tst(42)

**********************************************************************

**********************************************************************
1 items had failures:
   2 of   3 in __main__.tst
```


See, the original `tst()` had 2 doctests, one was added by ``@`docstr` - and 3 were tested.
So it's perfectly doable for functions.

As a sanity check:

```
$ ipython3 
Python 3.9.2 (default, Feb 28 2021, 17:03:44) 
Type 'copyright', 'credits' or 'license' for more information
IPython 7.20.0 -- An enhanced Interactive Python. Type '?' for help.

In [1]: from d import  *

In [2]: tst?
Docstring:
adds 1 to x
>>> tst(0)
1
>>> tst(42)
42 

>>> tst(1)
42
File:      /tmp/d.py
Type:      function
```


------

As we see, doctests are run on `__doc__` attributes of functions, not by scraping the text of the file.

And it works, in vanilla Python 3.9, with classes too:

```python
def docstr(f):
    """
    amends the docstring
    """
    f.__doc__ += """
    >>> len(tst.__subclasses__()) > 0
    True
    """
    return f

@docstr
class tst:
    '''testing
    >>> len(tst.__subclasses__()) <= 1
    True
    '''
    pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import doctest
    doctest.testmod()
```

and so we see 2 doctests being run, one from the class body, one added by the decorator.

(You can easily modify this so that the class has empty `__doc__`, then one can create it in the decorator, so it's all sane here in vanilla Python).


I can only conclude that Sage's doctest system is borked at this point,and somehow
does a non-vanilla thing. 
Indeed,  `sage -t c.py` does not see the doctests added by the decorator.
