CC:  @tscrim sage-combinat @anneschilling vivianepons

Keywords: schubert, polynomials, divided differences

Title stolen from Stanley, but this is, alas, a bug, not a determinant conjecture:

```
sage: X = SchubertPolynomialRing(ZZ)
sage: X([]).expand()
1
sage: X([1]).expand()
1
sage: X([]) == X([1])
False
```

Normally, `X(perm)` reduces the permutation `perm` by removing all fixed points attached to its right end (i.e., if a permutation in `S_n` sends `n` to `n`, then it reduces it to a permutation in `S_{n-1}` and so on, until this reduction is no longer possible). And rightfully so, since the Schubert basis is indexed by reduced permutations.

```
sage: X = SchubertPolynomialRing(ZZ)
sage: X([1])
X[1]
sage: X([1,2])
X[1]
sage: X([1,2,3])
X[1]
```
However, it fails to reduce `[1]` to `[]` due to the behavior of `Permutation.remove_extra_fixed_points`.

Can we just fix it, or does symmetrica break on contact with the empty list? In the latter case, should we reduce `[]` to `[1]` instead?

Related: #23403.

I've updated the ticket description to better describe where the error is coming from (rather than the symptom).

There does seem to be some issue with symmetrica and empty lists:

```
sage: X([]) * X([1])
function: copy code: 4294967295 
python: : Numerical argument out of domain
sage: X([]) * X([])
function: copy code: 4294967295 
python: : Numerical argument out of domain
```
More shenanigans:

```
sage: it = iter(X.basis())
sage: [it.next() for _ in range(10)]
[X[],
 X[1],
 X[1, 2],
 X[2, 1],
 X[1, 2, 3],
 X[1, 3, 2],
 X[2, 1, 3],
 X[2, 3, 1],
 X[3, 1, 2],
 X[3, 2, 1]]
```
So one of the definite problems is that the indexing set could be considered too big. However, we could also consider `X` as a tower of polynomial rings, so it would make sense to distinguish `X[1, 2]` from `X[1]`, etc. by considering each within a homogeneous component with a fixed number of variables.

The way I understand Schubert polynomials, you either deal with them in a fixed number of indeterminates (in which case the basis is indexed by `S_n`), or in infinitely many indeterminates (in which case the basis is indexed by `S_0 \cup S_1 \cup S_2 \cup ...`, and this is an increasing union, not a disjoint union -- i.e., we identify permutations that only differ in trailing fixed points).
