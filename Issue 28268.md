# Issue 28268: Non-ASCII character in file

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28505

Original creator: zimmerma

Original creation time: 2019-09-16 11:55:11

with Sage 8.8 (the version shipped with Debian):

```
$ sage
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ SageMath version 8.8, Release Date: 2019-06-26                     │
│ Using Python 2.7.15. Type "help()" for help.                       │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
sage: from scipy.stats import norm
   File "/usr/local/SageMath/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/scipy/stats/_continuous_distns.py", line 3345
     pp. 1–13, 1997.
                    ^
SyntaxError: Non-ASCII character '\xe2' in file /usr/local/SageMath/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/scipy/stats/_continuous_distns.py on line 3346, but no encoding declared; see http://python.org/dev/peps/pep-0263/ for details
```

The following line should be added in the file:

```
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
```

Same for `_stats_mstats_common.py`

Works fine with python3-built sage. Time to switch ?

Is this fixed with #28154?

Works fine for me.

I will try with Sage 9.0, if I manage to compile it from source on my machine, which was not the case for 8.8 and 8.9. See #28768.

Moving tickets to milestone sage-9.2 based on a review of last modification date, branch status, and severity.

Likely outdated after our switch to Python 3.

Changing status from new to needs_review.

I confirm `from scipy.stats import norm` works with 9.0.

Changing status from needs_review to positive_review.
