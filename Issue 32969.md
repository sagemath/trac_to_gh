To replicate the issue:
* ./configure --enable-sagemath_doc_pdf=yes
* make
* ./sage -n jupyter
* select `New -> [SageMath](SageMath) xxxx`
* select `Help -> Sage Documentation`

`Clicking` on any of the PDF icons gives, for example, in the terminal:

```
[W 20:13:44.654 NotebookApp] Kernelspec name pdf cannot be found!
[W 20:13:44.655 NotebookApp] 404 GET /kernelspecs/pdf/en/tutorial/SageTutorial.pdf (::1): Kernel spec pdf not found
[W 20:13:44.656 NotebookApp] 404 GET /kernelspecs/pdf/en/tutorial/SageTutorial.pdf (::1) 2.920000ms referer=http://localhost:8888/kernelspecs/sagemath/doc/index.html
```

with a corresponding `404 : Not Found` browser page

Note:

if Sage is configured with `--enable-sagemath_doc_pdf=no` then PDF documentation icons/links will not appear in the Documentation.

It seems (1) we only need the symlink in the "website" directory, and (2) the symlink creation is the job of the sphinx "website" builder.

Unless I'm mistaken, in addition to now creating the `pdf` symlink under the "website" folder the entire `pdf` tree under `local/share/doc/sage/pdf` had been copied to `local/share/doc/sage/html/en/pdf`. Is this intended?

OK, so the copied stuff under `local/share/doc/html/en/pdf` are needed for the PDF links to work in the Documentation. Couldn't this be a symlink? I'm not sure what the created symlink under the "website" folder does. If I move `local/share/doc/html/en/pdf` out of the way the links in the Documentation are broken.

The absolute link is a bit of an issue in my opinion. It certainly can lead to problem in distros where `SAGE_DOC` at build time is different from `SAGE_DOC` at runtime once everything is put in place. Vanilla sage builds in place of course so doesn't see that problem.

So my suggestion is something like [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54825010/why-does-os-symlink-uses-path-relative-to-destination](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54825010/why-does-os-symlink-uses-path-relative-to-destination)

```
html_output_dir = self._output_dir('html')
pdf_doc_dir = os.path.join(SAGE_DOC, 'pdf')
relpath = os.path.relpath(pdf_doc_dir, os.path.join(html_output_dir, '..', 'pdf'))

try:
      os.symlink(relpath, os.path.join(html_output_dir, '..', 'pdf'))
