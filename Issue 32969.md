To replicate the issue:
* ./configure --enable-sagemath_doc_pdf=yes
* make
* ./sage -n jupyter
* select `New -> [SageMath](SageMath) xxxx`
* select `Help -> Sage Documentation`

`Clicking` on any of the PDF icons gives, for example, in the terminal:

```
[W 20:13:44.654 NotebookApp] Kernelspec name pdf cannot be found!
[W 20:13:44.655 NotebookApp] 404 GET /kernelspecs/pdf/en/tutorial/SageTutorial.pdf (::1): Kernel spec pdf not found
[W 20:13:44.656 NotebookApp] 404 GET /kernelspecs/pdf/en/tutorial/SageTutorial.pdf (::1) 2.920000ms referer=http://localhost:8888/kernelspecs/sagemath/doc/index.html
```

with a corresponding `404 : Not Found` browser page

Note:

if Sage is configured with `--enable-sagemath_doc_pdf=no` then PDF documentation icons/links will not appear in the Documentation.

Unless I'm mistaken, in addition to now creating the `pdf` symlink under the "website" folder the entire `pdf` tree under `local/share/doc/sage/pdf` had been copied to `local/share/doc/sage/html/en/pdf`. Is this intended?

OK, so the copied stuff under `local/share/doc/html/en/pdf` are needed for the PDF links to work in the Documentation. Couldn't this be a symlink? I'm not sure what the created symlink under the "website" folder does. If I move `local/share/doc/html/en/pdf` out of the way the links in the Documentation are broken.

Never. It was my mistake to put the symlink `pdf` to the website folder, which triggered the whole copy. Now it is put in the folder one level up.

The absolute link is a bit of an issue in my opinion. It certainly can lead to problem in distros where `SAGE_DOC` at build time is different from `SAGE_DOC` at runtime once everything is put in place. Vanilla sage builds in place of course so doesn't see that problem.

So my suggestion is something like [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54825010/why-does-os-symlink-uses-path-relative-to-destination](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54825010/why-does-os-symlink-uses-path-relative-to-destination)

```
html_output_dir = self._output_dir('html')
pdf_doc_dir = os.path.join(SAGE_DOC, 'pdf')
relpath = os.path.relpath(pdf_doc_dir, os.path.join(html_output_dir, '..', 'pdf'))

try:
      os.symlink(relpath, os.path.join(html_output_dir, '..', 'pdf'))
except FileExistsError:
      pass
