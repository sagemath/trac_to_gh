# Issue 22361: __len__() should raise TypeError when objects have no finite size

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22598

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2017-03-13 18:25:49

Whenever `__len__()` makes no sense on some object, `__len__()` should `raise TypeError`.

Some classes currently `raise NotImplementedError`, which is not meant for this.

I would like to work on this issue. I looked up for some .pyx and .py files which contain __len()__ out of which lazy_string.pyx and mrange.py look like the ones to be fixed. However I could not find any function where __len()__ raises a NotImplementedError , mrange.py already raises a TypeError when the object size is not finite.

I didn't look very well, but there is at least also `src/sage/rings/ring.pyx`

This might also come from the category of infinite (enumerated) sets.

Yea, this looks good. I don't find any of the __len__() functions raising NotImplementedError in misc component. Anyway, I will fix the function in ring.pyx.

Please check if there are any modifications required. Also, I guess we will have to change the component to rings.

Please use more interesting commit messages instead of `Fixed #22598:`: describe what you actually did.
