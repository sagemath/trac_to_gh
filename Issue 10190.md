I guess you haven't been aware of #9426...

There are two (almost) identical patches to the Sage library, where the `.2` is the _older one_.

P.S.: Does Sphinx now also raise an error because of "`then ``None`` wil be returned.`"?

True.

The .2 was a mistake by me, apply [attachment:10191_catch_sphinx_error.patch] like the description of the ticket says :-)

I don't understand what you mean...

I meant does it now do spell-checking as well. Your "Sphinx error example" was a bit ambiguous in that way.

Allright, see #10210.

Any obstructions for this patch ([attachment:10191_catch_sphinx_error.patch]) to get positive review?
