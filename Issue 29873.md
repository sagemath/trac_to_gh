# Issue 29873: py3: remove doctests tagged py2 in graphs

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30110

Original creator: dcoudert

Original creation time: 2020-07-11 14:04:10

Since the switch to Python3, we don't need to have both doctests for py2 and py3. We remove py2 tests in the graphs module.

a `#py2` tag remains in `graph_database.py`. I don't know what to do with this tool anyway since it uses `sagenb`...

This looks good to me.

Replying to [comment:3 dcoudert]:

Eventually, the `interactive_query` method should be changed to work with Python 3 or it should be removed. Until that is done, I think it is fine to keep the py2 test for clarity.
