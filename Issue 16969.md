Keywords: beginner

This is an easy beginner ticket.  This should work but doesn't

```
var1 = var('var1', latex_name=r'\sigma^2_1')  # braces shouldn't be needed, but are
show(e^(var1**2))
```


This does work

```
var1 = var('var1', latex_name=r'{\sigma^2_1}')  # braces shouldn't be needed, but are
show(e^(var1**2))
```


The fix is to wrap the input of latex_name in braces always.  In SageMathCloud I just made that fix already.

```
File "src/sage/calculus/var.pyx", line 73, in sage.calculus.var.var
Failed example:

Expected:
    's_{u,i}'
Got:

```
