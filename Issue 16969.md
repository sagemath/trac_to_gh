Keywords: beginner

This is an easy beginner ticket.  This should work but doesn't

```
var1 = var('var1', latex_name=r'\sigma^2_1')  # braces shouldn't be needed, but are
show(e^(var1**2))
```

This does work

```
var1 = var('var1', latex_name=r'{\sigma^2_1}')  # braces shouldn't be needed, but are
show(e^(var1**2))
```

The fix is to wrap the input of latex_name in braces always.  In SageMathCloud I just made that fix already.
