# Issue 24991: Use coercion maps when initializing polynomials in â„¤[x]

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25228

In #22956 we are having trouble creating some integer polynomials:

```
TypeError: unable to coerce <class 'henselization.base_element.BaseElement_Ring_with_category'> to an integer
```


The proposed patch fixes this problem.

This is sort-of-documented feature. Elements must implement `_rational_` and `_integer_` to make this work. Conversion maps are often ignored here.
