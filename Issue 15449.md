As prompted by http://ask.sagemath.org/question/3410, this ticket is meant for discussion to improve the documentation of the `constraint_generation` option of MixedIntegerLinearProgramming.

From the ref: http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/numerical/sage/numerical/mip.html:

> constraint_generation – whether to require the returned solver to support constraint generation (excludes Coin). False by default.


From the source: https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/master/src/sage/numerical/backends/generic_backend.pyx#L983:

>  - ``constraint_generation`` (boolean) -- whether the solver returned is to be used for constraint/variable generation. As the interface with Coin does not support constraint/variable generation, setting `constraint_generation` to `False` ensures that the backend to Coin is not returned when `solver = None`. This is set to `False` by default.


First issue: in the source the phrase “setting `constraint_generation` to `False` ensures that the backend to Coin is not returned when `solver = None`” seems incorrect, as setting `constraint_generation` to `False` is meant to *allow* selection of Coin.

Second issue: upon first reading the ref and source documentation, I understood that Coin would not be selected if `constraint_generation` were set to `True`, but not what was exactly meant by ‘constraint generation’ in the context of the module. I thought it would enable passing a constraint generator. Now I understand that constraint generation means: after a first call `solve()`, one or more constraints is added to the solved instance, and then `solve()` is called again. Perhaps the documentation should be changed to make this clearer.

Hellooooooo !!

> You forced my hand:


Ahahah. Well, wasn't the only alternative for me to rewrite a doc that I already find clear ? `:-P`

> Do I create pull requests for these, or what is the preferred workflow?


Well, depending how you are used to git, the workflow is more or less simple :
- Get the Trac server to know your public ssh key
- Modify Sage's source code, and upload the commits as a branch
- Change the "branch" field of this ticket if it is not done automatically.

It is all explained there [1], and I can help with any specific question you have if it isn't clear. And we will update the developper's documentation if something isn't clear, too `^^;`

By the way, your changes as I see them are not correct : When `constraint_generation` is set to `False`, it may very well be that the solver returned does supports constraint generation. That will actually happen whenever Coin is not installed on the machine.

And I don't know if it is a good idea to mention Coin explicitly in the docstring, for there may come a time when another solver that does not support `constraint_generation` may be made available in Sage, and it's quite likely we will forget to update the documentation when the code is changed... But well `:-P`

As I said earlier, you cannot say that a solver returned when calling `constraint_generation=False` does not support constraint generation. You can only say that it does support constraint generation when `constraint_generation` is set to `True`. Also, as far as I know you can only add constraints, not modify them.

I don't know exactly. My use of LP is pretty simple : I add constraints and solve them. Sometimes, I then add constraints and solve them another time. What I can swear is that I cannot so the following with Coin, and that they told me it was not supported.

Removing constraints or modifying them is what I consider a "fancy use" of LP already. I mean, these things are meant to solve sets of equations, they are not text editors `:-P`

I've made a modification much like the one you suggest, but in the `constraint_generation` documentation

>But I don't know what a guy specifying both a solver and a value to `constraint_generation` would expect `O_o`


Well, currently, as far as I can tell from the code, the selected solver is used. Only if `solver=None` is the constraint_generation parameter taken into account. The current reformulation is compatible with this.
