Please be patient, this is the first time I have ever tried to review a git ticket.

I had an up-to-date sage git build with precisely  branches, master (the current HEAD) and build_system (presumably obsolete).  I did 

```
 ./sage -dev checkout --ticket 15526  
```

and saw this:

```
On ticket #15526 with associated local branch "ticket/15526".

#  Use "sage --dev merge" to include another ticket/branch.
#  Use "sage --dev commit" to save changes into a new commit.
```

but now

```
./sage -dev diff
```

shows no changes.  However "git diff HEAD master" does show the expected diffs.  Is this a bug in "./sage -dev diff" or did I do something wrong already?

Thats the expected behavior:

```
$ sage -dev help diff
usage: sage-dev diff [-h] [--base BASE]

Show how the current file system differs from "base".

optional arguments:
  -h, --help   show this help message and exit
  --base BASE  a string; show the differences against the latest "'commit'"
               (the default), against the branch "'master'" (or any other
               branch name), or the merge of the "'dependencies'" of the
               current ticket (if the dependencies merge cleanly)
```

It matches what `git diff` does, by default is shows the changed local files relative to the current head commit. I.e., nothing if you haven't made any changes yet.

OK, that makes perfect sense, though it is not what I was expecting after reading the development guide which says that (with nothing after the diff) "which lists all source code changes that are part of the current branch. That is, it lists the changes from the current master to the current branch."   I'm learning, but I think the dev. guide could be clearer.

OK, so after applying the patch (in oldspeak) i.e. creating the branch from this ticket and waiting for "make" to finish, the banner is exactly the same: 5.13.  So, I don't know what to do to test this.  At least it passes the "patch applies ok"  test since that seens automatic with git.

I am running a "make ptestlong" and see the string "sage-6.0.rc0" appearing,  but I don't know if that is a waste of time.

This seems to suggest that people other than release managers will have difficulties in testing this, then!  I get 3 errors in cmdline.py, all like

```
File "src/sage/tests/cmdline.py", line 185, in sage.tests.cmdline.test_executable
Failed example:
    out.find(version()) >= 0
Expected: 
    True
Got:
    False
```


I'll go and look for a different and more normal ticket to test out my reviewing skills.
