This was fairly easy to fix by passing the appropriate space of modular symbols instead of just its level to the `degeneracy_map()` method.  I took the opportunity to slightly improve the documentation.

LGTM modulo the more standard input:

```diff
-    - ``simple`` -- boolean (default: True).  If set to False,
-      isogenous simple factors are grouped together.
+    - ``simple`` -- boolean (default: ``True``); if set to
+      ``False``, isogenous simple factors are grouped together
```

Once that is changed, you can set a positive review on my behalf.
