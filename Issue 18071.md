This is essentially #4105 but for Galois group elements.


```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^6 + 40*x^3 + 1372)
sage: G = K.galois_group()
sage: L = [G.artin_symbol(Q) for Q in K.primes_above(5)]
sage: L[0] * L[1]
TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for '*': 'Subgroup [(), (1,5)(2,4)(3,6)] of Galois group of Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^6 + 40*x^3 + 1372' and 'Subgroup [(), (1,2)(3,4)(5,6)] of Galois group of Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^6 + 40*x^3 + 1372'
