Thank you for working on these.  I'm excited to try it on Cygwin

Regarding your comments about zmq that's an interesting point I hadn't thought about.  For something like pyzmq I generally assumed that if a system libzmq were used then likely there would be a system pyzmq as well.  But it's true that that doesn't *have* to be the case.

So the question is what to do if some package has as a dependency another package (like libzmq) that was detected at `configure`-time.  If the dependent package can just automatically detect the right location for its dependency, then there is no problem, as I assume is the case for your pyzmq change.

For other packages we might not be so lucky.  So we may have to have the `configure` script output, in some cases, some variables related to dependencies detected at configure-time.  For example, if some package really needed to know the correct prefix for libzmq (as opposed to just assuming it's `$SAGE_LOCAL`) we ought to output some `LIBZMQ_PREFIX=...` variable to a file that can be sourced by `spkg-install`.  I don't have a precise plan for this, but it is a thought I've had before.  This could also be useful for sagelib itself, as we want to be able to tell it exactly where it can find certain runtime dependencies.

Relatedly, I've thought of adding a `configure` script just for sagelib that repurposes this machinery, but just detects the direct build- and runtime dependencies for Sage itself: This would be useful for packaging and installing just sagelib on systems where all other indirect dependencies are already assumed satisfied.  That is, outside the context of sage-the-distribution.

Obviously what I'm describing is something like a limited pkg-config.  I don't know what the issues are with relying on pkg-config on macos, but I don't think it should be a requirement.  There are certainly Python packages that use pkg-config where available to check for dependencies, but there usually end up being fallbacks for mac and windows when pkg-config isn't available.

Whether dependency checks are written in Python, or balled up in a `configure` script generated by autoconf, those checks would also probably use pkg-config where available, and provide fallbacks where not.  Inconvenient and annoying, but a fact of life I suppose :(

There appears to be a bug in build/pkgs/xz/spkg-configure.m4.  On my Linux machine I'm getting:


```
configure: === checking whether to install the xz SPKG ===
checking if lzma is wanted... yes
checking for inflateEnd in -llzma... no
checking lzma.h usability... yes
checking lzma.h presence... yes
checking for lzma.h... yes
configure: error: either specify a valid lzma installation with --with-lzma=DIR or disable lzma usage with --without-lzma
```


It appears that my `xz` version is too low (do we really need it to be a specific version for any known reason)?

Then, it looks like there might be some improper nesting or something, or not fully handling every possible failure case, because I shouldn't get that error.

This includes the update you mentioned for `ax_check_liblzma`.  I had forgotten that you said you wrote that by basically copying the one for zlib.

I also tried lowering the required version to 5.0.0.  I don't know for sure whether or not that's acceptable but I'll try it for now.

AFAICT no: it was just the latest version when the xz SPKG was first added to Sage.  Unless there is a known problem with some lower version, setting 5.0.0 as a minimum seems fine (if indeed we even need to bother with the version check).

I now recall seeing something along these lines on Fedora, only there this lib is in `/lib64/`, and it's not checked by the macro. Not sure it's the same problem or a different one.

yes, this should do doable. 

But, as well, the more I think about it the more it looks to me that we should seriously consider using Homebrew on OSX, with this sort of approach we won't be having library clashes one sometimes sees with Homebrew...

It's definitely on the list.  For the sake of keeping *this* ticket tractable I don't think I want to add too many additional package checks on this one ticket, but we should definitely have a followup for bz2, and many other packages (ncurses is high on my list because it takes *forever* to compile on Cygwin for some reason).

I'm now trying this branch on OSX/Homebrew, with everything for which we have spkg-configure.m4 coming from either the Xcode or Homebrew; looks promising.

and a very similar one in `src/sage/doctest/external.py`.
And few timeouts - not surprising for an 8-year old machine...

Looks good enough for a positive OSX review to me.

We have seen this stuff already, I just already forgot (as one does with nightmares :-))

I thought maybe it had something to do with that too, but I wasn't sure if you re-ran those tests before/after this patch.

This broke the build on an OS X Mojave machine. With Mojave, it is possible to have no directory `/usr/include`, for example, but with this branch, `./configure` found `zlib` somewhere. The problem is that Python doesn't find it, so Python is built without zlib support, and that breaks the `pip` build, for example.
