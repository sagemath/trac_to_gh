We implement arrays of fast callable. We use it when there is a need to consider gradient or hessian of multidimensional functions (typically `numerical/optimize.py`).

Such array should be compatible with numpy arrays as with #29235.

It would be good to consider this in the larger context of graph representations that modern libraries such as `pytorch` provide. There's little point in rolling this our own.
