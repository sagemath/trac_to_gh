Keywords: Rtree, spatial index,

Rtree is a ctypes Python wrapper of libspatialindex that provides a number of advanced spatial indexing features for the spatially curious Python user. These features include:

Nearest neighbor search

Intersection search

Multi-dimensional indexes

Clustered indexes (store Python pickles directly with index entries)

Bulk loading

Deletion

Disk serialization

Custom storage implementation (to implement spatial indexing in ZODB, for example).

Although it is named as Rtree, it also provides options for its variants in terms of splitting. There are 3 ways for it, that is, linear, quadratic, and R* tree splitting. The difference of them can be found here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-tree.


We create a normal package for `Rtree`.

The lastest pushed branch has been changed for lowercase. Because the git is not case-sensitive, it still kept the same capital letters of those distribution files, even though I had changed them on my computer. After I realized the reason for that, I followed this solution https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17683458/how-do-i-commit-case-sensitive-only-filename-changes-in-git#1 and so that committed the code twice. Somehow, it is sort of not smart, but I did not figure out a better method for that.
