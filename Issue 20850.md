> Note that sip requires flex and bison...

Are you sure? The `README` says

```
If you are using a copy of SIP cloned from the Mercurial repository, or are
using a Mercurial archive, then you have to prepare it first before you follow
the normal installation instructions.

The preparation is done using the ``build.py`` script which can be found in the
same directory as this ``README`` file.  If it isn't there then you probably
have a packaged release and should just follow the normal installation
instructions.

The ``build.py`` script requires that ``flex`` and ``bison``, and the Mercurial
Python bindings are installed.  If you want to create the HTML documentation
then Sphinx must also be installed.
```


So I understand that flex and bison are not needed for a "packaged release" (which is how it should be!).

1. You need to check for errors in `spkg-install`.

2. You should use `$MAKE` instead of `make`.

Two nitpicks:

1. Use 4 spaces for indentation, also in `spkg-install`.

2. The license can be also GPL version 2 or GPL version 3 (which is very important for Sage!)

It's not "or later". It's GPL version 2 or 3.

Anyway, my point is that this needs to be documented in `SPKG.txt`.
