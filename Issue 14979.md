Also, the docstring of `ParkingFunction` is wrong; this method returns elements, not the class.

The call `ParkingFunction([1]).diagonal_reading_word()` results in a ValueError; I don't think it should. That, and its docstring shouldn't refer to its pretty print for the definition.

Travis, are you planning to give `parking_function.py` the #12913 treatment?

```

My guess is the problem is elements aren't being created with the right parent:
`ParkingFunctions_all.__iter__`: (I also prefer to avoid iteration over `NN` as it is simple to implement)

```diff
-        for n in NN:
-            yield from ParkingFunctions_n(n).__iter__()
+        n = 0
+        while True:
+            for pf in ParkingFunctions_n(n):
+                yield self.element_class(self, list(pf))
+            n += 1
```

`ParkingFunctions_n.__iter__`:

```diff
-yield ParkingFunction(list(pi))
+yield self.element_class(self, list(pi))
```

`ParkingFunctions_n.random_element`:

```diff
-return ParkingFunction([(i - free[0]).lift() for i in fun])
+return self.element_class(self, [(i - free[0]).lift() for i in fun])
```


Also, in `ParkingFunction`, this is bad:

```
    if pf is not None:
        return ParkingFunction_class(None, pf)
```

Everything should have a parent.

One drawback is that parking functions for different parents will not be comparable (unless a coercion is implemented); in particular for the `all` and the `n` parents.

A few last little details:

This is (still) bad:

```
+    return ParkingFunction_class(None,
+                                 [L.index(i) + 1 - D[L.index(i)]
                                   for i in range(1, len(L) + 1)])
```

You could construct a parent (probably all parking functions) and pass the list to that.

`def __repr__` -> `def _repr_`

It is better to put `UniqueRepresentation` before `Parent` in the MRO so the equality/hashing/etc. is called earlier.

`.. warning::` -> `.. WARNING::`

Something that I prefer is to not have a separate function `ParkingFunction` and element class `ParkingFunction_class`, but instead just have a `ParkingFunction` class that uses `__classcall_private__` for direct construction (see, e.g., `Partition`). I think this is less confusing for the user and is a more logical grouping (at the small expense of an indirection for someone new to the code/mechanism). I can do this if you want.

Thanks, Travis.

I would rather postpone further refactoring to another ticket. Unless you are really motivated to do the job, of course.

Calling `ParkingFunction_class` with `None` as parent will set a correct parent automatically, namely `ParkingFunctions_n`. So in my mind, it is not so bad.

Okay, I did the refactoring. I think this becomes a lot easier for users because then they can do `if isinstance(PF, ParkingFunction)` and not wonder why this is always `False`. This also gives consistent documentation.

I also fixed a bug with the containment check.

Cleanup-wise, I fixed another `.. warning::`, removed `self` as an input, and a few other 80 chars/line.

If all of my changes are good, then you can set a positive review.
