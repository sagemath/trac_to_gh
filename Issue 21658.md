Keywords: metaclass

When creating a dynamic class, (e.g., when creating an object in a category,) the following code is used to figure out the metaclass:

```
metaclass = DynamicMetaclass
# The metaclass of a class must derive from the metaclasses of its
# bases. The following handles the case where one of the base
# classes is a known Sage metaclass.  This approach won't scale
# well if we start using metaclasses seriously in Sage.
for base in bases:
    if isinstance(base, InheritComparisonClasscallMetaclass):
        metaclass = DynamicInheritComparisonClasscallMetaclass
    elif isinstance(base, ClasscallMetaclass):
        metaclass = DynamicClasscallMetaclass
    elif isinstance(base, InheritComparisonMetaclass):
metaclass = DynamicInheritComparisonMetaclass
```

This does not work if two bases have conflicting metaclasses, say `InheritComparisonMetaclass` and `ClasscallMetaclass`. As a result, one can currently not let a subclass of `Morphism` (which is a `InheritComparisonMetaclass`) inherit from `UniqueRepresentation` (a `ClasscallMetaclass`).
