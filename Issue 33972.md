The current implementation of `--enable-editable` uses `pip install --editable --no-build-isolation`, which goes through legacy `setup.py develop`.

Here we change to the PEP 660 implementation in setuptools 65.x from	#34344. We drop `--no-build-isolation` too, so that setuptools from the wheel, not the installed setuptools 63.x is used.



Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/34209
