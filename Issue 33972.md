The current implementation of `--enable-editable` uses `pip install --editable --no-build-isolation`, which goes through legacy `setup.py develop`.

Here we change to the experimental PEP 660 implementation in the setuptools feature branch - https://discuss.python.org/t/help-testing-pep-660-support-in-setuptools/16904
