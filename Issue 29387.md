Fix PermutationGroup_generic.__richcmp__ usage of op_NE

Could you add a doctest that actually checks that the problem is fixed (including a reference to the ticket). Something like

```
We check that :trac:`29624` is fixed::

    sage: G1 = MyPermGroup1()
    sage: G2 = MyPermGroup2()
    sage: G3 = MyPermGroup3()
    sage: G1 != G2
    X
    sage: G1 != G3
    Y
```

This would better inside a `TESTS` section.

The syntax is not correct

```
TESTS:    <--- only one colon

Check that :trac:`29624` is fixed::   <--- here no indentation and two colons in order to delimit a block code
                                      <--- line break
    sage: G = SymmetricGroup(2)
    sage: H = PermutationGroup([(1,2)])
    sage: not G == H
    False
    sage: G != H
    False
```


Once this is fixed, you could set the ticket in `needs_review` so that it can be tested by patchbots.

I'll make those changes immediately, but I didn't find something explicitly about this on the guide and I checked three things before pushing: 1) The doc build html did not include the test block. 2) The test pass by sage -t and 3) the tests do not pass if I change a FALSE to a TRUE.

This is about Rest documentation syntax (mostly disjoint from sage doctesting with `sage -t`). With your version, the doc would not have compiled correctly. You could look at "building the doc" in the developer guide.

I apologize for using this as a discussion, but I'm new here and it's  the second time I see something like this so I better understand it. I did build the doc before to make sure that it did fine without an error as per 
https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/sage_manuals.html#building-the-manuals 

That's why I pushed anyway.

Always better to ask questions! And there is also someting that I don't quite know.

Here the situation is a bit weird. The `TESTS` blocks are excluded from the documentation because we thought that most users would not want to see that. What I meant is that these blocks are excluded from the final compiled HTML or pdf documents. I am not exactly sure how sphinx process the blocks but it might be the case that even with a syntax error it just builds fine.
