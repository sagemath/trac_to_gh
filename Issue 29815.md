It looks like there is some ABI confusion. This is supposed to be a 32-bit build, but it seems like cvxopt is doing a 64-bit build.

This build uses system `suitesparse`.

IIRC Debian puts its suitesparse headers in `/usr/include/suitesparse` instead of `/usr/include`. Could that be the problem here?

To answer my own question, it's probably half of the problem. The other half is that the guessing in cvxopt's setup.py is not sufficiently advanced:
