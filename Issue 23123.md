No, Cython 0.26 is not released yet. This is just for testing the beta version now.

Windows patchbot just got to it.

Patchbots will do nothing for this kind of spkg ticket.

Ah, I keep forgetting that.  Why is that?  You'd think one would want them to test new packages?


---

Comment by chapoton created at 2017-07-20 16:33:23

For safety reason, and because not so many people care about enhancing the patchbots. I have done my share.

If there were safety issues with an upstream package wouldn't we want to know that in the patchbots first, before just declaring them "fine" and then pushing them on all users?
