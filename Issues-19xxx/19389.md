<a id='comment:5'></a>Ignore comment about missing period, I fail at reading diff.

First sentence of doc for `to_dyck_word()` should be a single compact sentence, caveats/explanations should be pushed to a second paragraph, or included in `INPUT:`.

Methods should be `last_diagonal` and `link_pattern`.

Lastly, there should be some kind of error raised if the parameter is set to be something other than one of those two options.
