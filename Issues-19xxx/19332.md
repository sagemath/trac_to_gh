Any sort of "linear property" on a cone can usually be verified on a generating set of the cone instead of the whole thing. This involves a finite number of steps for a polyhedral cone.

The discrete complementarity set is a finite subset, consisting of generators, of the usual complementarity set that appears in complementarity and mathematical programming problems. Having it available lets us check complementarity properties on the cone.

The only thing "new" here is the name (which I coin in the reference). The idea of taking a finite subset of the complementarity set is old, but usually only in the context of extreme vectors and proper cones.

I do not like the implementation at all, why do we need to do

```
sage: self = Cone([(1,0),(0,1)])
sage: V = self.lattice().vector_space()
sage: G1 = [ V(x) for x in self.rays() ]
sage: G2 = [ V(s) for s in self.dual().rays() ]
sage: [ (x,s) for x in G1 for s in G2 if x.inner_product(s) == 0 ]
[((1, 0), (0, 1)), ((0, 1), (1, 0))]
```
when exactly the same is achieved with

```
sage: [(x, s) for x in self for s in self.dual() if x * s == 0]
[(N(1, 0), M(0, 1)), (N(0, 1), M(1, 0))]
```
which uses only memory for tuples (but not their elements) and can be cached??? 

Products work just fine between rays of dual cones and to big extent the whole point of introducing toric lattices was to allow only "correct" ways of mixing them, i.e. you cannot multiply rays that live in the same lattice. If the user is not happy with the type of the above output and wants to do illegal products, that user is welcome to do explicit conversion.

Note also that the result can be achieved using

```
sage: [[(r, n) for r in f] for f, n in zip(self.facets(), self.facet_normals())]
[[(N(1, 0), M(0, 1))], [(N(0, 1), M(1, 0))]]
sage: self.orthogonal_sublattice()
Sublattice <>
```
which will not be as short of a code and above, but may be faster if face lattice is used (and thus computed/cached) for something else. Not sure if there is any point in using it for the implementation, but perhaps the relation can be mentioned in the documentation (and I definitely like your detailed docstrings!).

A bipartite graph also seems to be a natural structure for the output ;-)

A few months ago, I'm sure I had a reason... but this works just fine now. I used your implementation and updated all of the doctests. I did use an explicit `x.inner_product(s)` because it's not easy to figure out what `x*s` does.

You got my hopes up: this is an order of magnitude faster. But it also outputs the wrong answer =)

```
sage: K = Cone([(1,0)])
sage: [[(r, n) for r in f] for f, n in zip(K.facets(), K.facet_normals())]
[[]]
sage: K.discrete_complementarity_set()
[(N(1, 0), M(0, 1)), (N(1, 0), M(0, -1))]
```

Now that it's outputting lattice elements, sure, but can we do anything cool with the graph? The only thing I ever do with the complementarity set is loop through it and check properties.

The complementarity set can be huge so I don't want to build a graph unless I can do something with it.

It does work correctly if you take into account `orthogonal_sublattice` mentioned earlier, I was just too lazy to write the combination, but how about

```
sage: self = Cone([(1,0)])
sage: dcs = [(r, n) for f, n in zip(self.facets(), self.facet_normals()) for r in f]
sage: dcs.extend((r, n) for r in self for n in self.orthogonal_sublattice().basis())
sage: dcs.extend((r, -n) for r in self for n in self.orthogonal_sublattice().basis())
sage: dcs
[(N(1, 0), M(0, 1)), (N(1, 0), M(0, -1))]

sage: self = Cone([(1,0),(0,1)])
sage: dcs = [(r, n) for f, n in zip(self.facets(), self.facet_normals()) for r in f]
sage: dcs.extend((r, n) for r in self for n in self.orthogonal_sublattice().basis())
sage: dcs.extend((r, -n) for r in self for n in self.orthogonal_sublattice().basis())
sage: dcs
[(N(1, 0), M(0, 1)), (N(0, 1), M(1, 0))]
```

Note that some rays here will be immutable while others not, so perhaps the actual implementation should be

```python
@cached_method
def discrete_complementarity_set(self):
    dcs = [(r, n) for f, n in zip(self.facets(), self.facet_normals()) for r in f]
    # Extra elements for non-full-dimensional cones
    orthogonal_generators = list(self.orthogonal_sublattice().gens())
    orthogonal_generators += [-g for g in orthogonal_generators]
    [g.set_immutable() for g in orthogonal_generators]
    dcs.extend((r, g) for r in self for g in orthogonal_generators)
    return tuple(dcs)
```
with doc fixes that a tuple is returned.

If your tests for large cones show that it is indeed faster, let's use this one. I am quite positive that it will be faster on its own, but if you take constructing the face lattice into account it is not so obvious anymore.

The graphs was more of a joke, typical use would probably be iterating over edges and that's exactly what your function is returning directly.

Ohhh OK. I see what you're doing. I actually use that trick in a few places in the paper, but I never thought to apply it to the complementarity set. Thank you!




> Note that some rays here will be immutable while others not, so perhaps the actual implementation should be... with doc fixes that a tuple is returned.


Why return a tuple instead of a list? This was the fastest I could make it (prior to making it a cached method):

```
dcs = [ (r,n) for (f,n) in zip(self.facets(), self.facet_normals())
              for r in f ]
orthogonal_gens = list(self.orthogonal_sublattice().gens())
orthogonal_gens += [ (-g).set_immutable() for g in orthogonal_gens ]
return dcs + [ (r,g) for r in self for g in orthogonal_gens ]
```




> If your tests for large cones show that it is indeed faster, let's use this one. I am quite positive that it will be faster on its own, but if you take constructing the face lattice into account it is not so obvious anymore.


It is still much faster.

Whoops, this is obviously wrong:

```
orthogonal_gens += [ (-g).set_immutable() for g in orthogonal_gens ]
```

However this still speeds things up a bit:

```
return dcs + [ (r,g) for r in self for g in orthogonal_gens ]
```

Does the tuple/list choice matter for caching?

I made an embarrassing mistake in my benchmarks. I've been using one big cone for all my tests, but I accidentally saved the cone after its face lattice was cached.

After fixing that mistake, the naive implementation takes around 400ms consistently. The "fast" one takes over a second for the first call, and then is much faster afterwards. But if we're going to cache the result anyway, the naive implementation will do fine.

I've attached the cone object (without the face lattice cached!) if you want to check. This is how I've been timing a single call.

```
sage: K = load('/home/mjo/K.sobj')
sage: timeit('K.discrete_complementarity_set()', repeat=1, number=1)
```
