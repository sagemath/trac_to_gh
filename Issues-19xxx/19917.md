<a id='comment:14'></a>The gap (not: libgap) tab completion also doesn't have GeneratorsOfGroup:

```
sage: G = gap.SymmetricGroup(3)
sage: G.GeneratorsOf[TAB]
G.GeneratorsOfDomain             G.GeneratorsOfMagmaWithInverses  
G.GeneratorsOfMagma              G.GeneratorsOfMagmaWithOne       
sage: G.GeneratorsOfMagmaWithInverses()
[ (1,2,3), (1,2) ]
