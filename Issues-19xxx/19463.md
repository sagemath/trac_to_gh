This ticket creates a new coding/two_weight_db module.

In it are stored all codes that were stored in graphs/strongly_regular_db.pyx. I expect that this file will change heavily, if we end up enriching our list of two weight codes for their own sake.

A first commit moves out of the `strongly_regular_graph` function the code that builds the database of small strongly regular graphs. Which turned out to be a good idea later, as building this list actually takes some time in order to guess the parameters of the SRG from the 2-weight code.

Depends on #19624

in [BJ03], you get name wrong; it is
Iliya Bouyukliev, Juriaan Simonis, i.e. the 1st names are Iliya and Juriaan.
(Juriaan is not so uncommon given Dutch name, Simonis is a relatively rare !Dutch/Flemish surname).

Isn't there a simpler way of getting the set of weights than

```
_,w1,w2 = sorted(set([x.hamming_weight() for x in LinearCode(M)]))
```
You are going through the whole set of vectors! But I admit that the module is not imported on sage startup.

One possibility: hard code the values + add a (long) doctest that checks that these values are indeed correct?

I now call `LinearCode.weight_distribution`.

That was done in an early version of this patch. I removed it to not see data repeated. I guess that it cannot hurt... All this code may eventually be wiped out however, if we start adding generic code constructions instead of fixed-size examples. That will probably change all the design, but well. We'll see.

I was thinking that it would be nice to refactor the DB by creating a class `TwoWeightCode`; a two-weight code has, after all, rather special properties and certain properties could be computed much faster for it.

I would give this class a flag at construction time `verify = True`. When this is true, it computes the weight distribution and verifies the code is two-weight. When it is false, the code is assumed two-weight: the two weights could either be given to the constructor, or they could be inferred very easily by running through the code until two distinct weights had been encountered. This can be expected to happen very quickly. A long test could then run a `verify_is_two_weight` in the codes or something.

I have no objection to that if you plan to do it yourself.

I expect all this code to be totally wiped out and rewritten in the future.

As you saw in the emails I sent about 2-weight codes the plan is to make it the 'new database' for those objects, and from what Eric Chen was saying it seems that all these codes belong to known families that we will be able to generate easily later.

I do not know what this code will look like, if it will totally replace what we have or only replace it partially, and how soon this will be implemented.

What I did here is extract the codes from the strongly regular graph module, in what will eventually become an independent database. Which, for the moment, is nothing but a dictionary with a bit of doc.

Most of them are infinite series. It's 30 years old paper, one should check if there is a newer survey...

A class is just a dictionary with code attached to it :-) Two-weight codes are special codes that allow certain properties to be calculated much faster than the general exponential bounds. Such as, obviously, minimum distance and which hamming weights are in the code, but there's surely more. Since such codes are apparently interesting in graph theory and combinatorics, it seems likely that someone might want to play around with them as codes, before you build graphs. "playing around" would then be computing stuff on them. Making them a class would give a natural place to put this code. By just making them `LinearCode`s, we miss out on the opportunity of putting these fast algorithms in a natural place. I'm not really talking about encoding/decoding, since I don't know that anyone should be interested in that.

One concrete example in your use where a class might be useful is in lazy computation of the two weights, using the faster, probabilistic algorithm.

The constructions of families that Dima talks about could be either functions that instantiate `TwoWeightCode` or subclasses, depending on whether the first would be overkill or not.

I concede that it might look like over-engineering from your point of view, however. From my point of view, this is a very special class of codes that is seemingly useful and (now) used in Sage. Therefore its natural that it should have a class :-)
