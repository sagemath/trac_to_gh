I can definitely attest to the Python prereq!

Do Debian and Redhat not require you to install Python, e.g. is it already on the system by default?  If so this looks good, except I can't attest to the redhat perl necessity so someone should.

However, I'm willing to give Volker the benefit of the doubt that those commands do what they need to do. The patch adds "Python 2.6" as general dependency, which is a good thing. Finally, as Volker likes to remind us, "perfect is the enemy of the good".
