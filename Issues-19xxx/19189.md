I can definitely attest to the Python prereq!

Do Debian and Redhat not require you to install Python, e.g. is it already on the system by default?  If so this looks good, except I can't attest to the redhat perl necessity so someone should.

I believe it!  I just can't review it, if that makes sense?  I'll leave that to someone with access to redhat.

I'm not a Debian or Redhat user either (I use Gentoo).

However, I'm willing to give Volker the benefit of the doubt that those commands do what they need to do. The patch adds "Python 2.6" as general dependency, which is a good thing. Finally, as Volker likes to remind us, "perfect is the enemy of the good".
