With this patch it is now possible to set a logfile for `Cplex`. This is useful for instance when you want to remember the logs or when you want to have access to them but don't want to see them on screen.

I don't know how to do the same for other backends, in particular `GLPK`.

Mostly up to you. The only way I see to see things differently is this: given that this is not a 'solver parameter' in the same sense than others, it could be worth creating an individual function to do that -- as it exposes a specific CPLEX API function.

Either way it must appear in the documentation somewhere.

They say in the doc that it returns an 'error code' when somethings goes wrong. You should probably call the 'check' function defined in the cplex backend file, just in case. It is done almost everywhere in the file.

<a id='comment:6'></a>Hello,

since `LogFile` is a solver parameter for `Gurobi`, I prefer to have similar access method for `Cplex`.
I have added the parameter to the documentation and I'm now using the `check` method.

Also, I had to
- modify all doctests of the `cplex_backend.pyx` file for the following reason: a call to `./sage -t -l --optional=CPLEX src/sage/numerical/backends/cplex_backend.pyx`  was reporting 149 doctests failures!

   Adding `# optional - CPLEX` to all the lines `from sage.numerical.backends.generic_backend import get_solver` solve the problem. Don't know why.

- change some doctests to get rid of deprecation warnings. E.g.,

```
    doctest:858: DeprecationWarning: The default value of 'nonnegative' will change, to False instead of True. You should add the explicit 'nonnegative=True'.
    See http://trac.sagemath.org/15521 for details.

I have a remaining doctest error for method `solve`

   I don't know how to fix the example. I can off course change it to something more understandable. Let me know what you prefer.

Okayokay. Could you write it in the doc somewhere? It only appears as examples so far.

That's because you are meant to run optional=sage,cplex.

But people here let things like #18904 to die, so whatever...
