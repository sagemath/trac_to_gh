A semi-standard way of doing things in github is to keep development happening
in `master` and to use tags for releases. I guess this discussion is more suited
for sage-devel though. 

As for the content of the ticket, I will be glad to accommodate Travis request as
soon as my sage install finishes a run of tests.
