Actually, a somewhat radical thought, what if we do make `master` somehow be the more granular bumps and not call them betas but, e.g., `6.10.4`, and then we have a latest merged branch that Volker includes? This way we could stop with those "wait until next beta to deal with conflicts/problems" messages for closed tickets that Volker has already included but not released.

A semi-standard way of doing things in github is to keep development happening
in `master` and to use tags for releases. I guess this discussion is more suited
for sage-devel though. 

As for the content of the ticket, I will be glad to accommodate Travis request as
soon as my sage install finishes a run of tests.
