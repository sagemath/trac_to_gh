Hello Daniel,

This is cool!

I guess that the line

```
verbose('iteration %s with results in %s of %s cells' %
   (iteration, len(result), len(open)), level=2)
```
is quite bad for performances. The string formatting is done whatever the verbose function is doing. Did you do some profiling?

Just for curiosity, do you know how good is `fast_callable` with interval fields? It looks pretty bad on the following example

```
sage: f(x) = log(exp(x*sin(x)) + exp(x*cos(x)))
sage: F = fast_callable(f, domain=RIF)
sage: r = RIF(0.1,0.2)
sage: %timeit F(r)
10000 loops, best of 3: 54.6 µs per loop
sage: %timeit ((r*r.sin()).exp() + (r*r.cos()).exp()).log()
10000 loops, best of 3: 32.8 µs per loop
```
compared to reals

```
sage: F = fast_callable(f, domain=RR)
sage: r = 0.1
sage: %timeit F(r)
100000 loops, best of 3: 12.4 µs per loop
sage: %timeit ((r*r.sin()).exp() + (r*r.cos()).exp()).log()
10000 loops, best of 3: 16.5 µs per loop
```

No, I didn't do any with this line included (I did on my old code, which used if and print für debugging).

> Just for curiosity, do you know how good is `fast_callable` with interval fields? 


Don't know. I used it with some larger symbolic expressions, and what I remember, I had a significant speedup there.

Not so good...

Any suggestions on the bisect-code using fast_callable?

If you really want these verbose you should use lazy formatting. I do not remember what is the state of the art, but you can have a look at `sage.misc.lazy_string` and `sage.misc.lazy_format`. But you are really creating a string within the critical loop. I do find it not very reasonable (the other is fine though).

I am pretty sure that `fast_callable` is better than symbolic and you seem to confirm that. However, you can see in my small snippet above that `fast_callable` looks worse than using Python. I should try on a larger expression but then you have to translate into an object call oriented expression and I am lazy...

Check what `fast_callable` is doing with `domain=RIF` and `domain=CIF` (quickly looking at `ext/fast_callable.pyx` I would say nothing). It can be done independently of this ticket.

Other comments:

- What is your variable `result` for?

- did you try to more typing. In other words `open = [] -> cdef list open = []` and `iteration = 0 -> cdef size_t iteration = 0`, etc. Cython does good job with Python list when it knows that these are lists.

Merged in 8.6, so back to needs review again.

When I see this correctly, all comments given on this ticket so far have been incorporated or answered, but noone gave a positive review three years ago.....I guess, however, we are close to a positive review after all. Can someone have a look again, please.

I don't think that "bisection on success"/"bisection on failure" is enough. In many instances you have better than a boolean test. Let me consider the situation where you want to isolate all roots of the function `f` (e.g. a square-free polynomial). Interval arithmetic allows you to:
- prove that a cell contains a single zero (if `f(left)` and `f(right)` have different signs and `f'(cell)` does not vanish)
- prove that a cell does not contain a zero (if `f(cell)` does not contain zero)
In this situation, you want to perform bisection if the two above certificate failed. It is a `True/False/Unknown` situation.

I think that the bisection should be general enough to handle this search because it does provide a proof of what you are looking for. The return value would be a pairs of lists: the one you are interested in and the pieces for which bisection failed to determinate their status.

Also, isolating roots in an example such as

```
sage: def contains_zero(fct, cell):
....:     return fct(cell).contains_zero()
sage: result = bisect(lambda x: x^3-4*x+2, RIF(-10, 10), contains_zero)
```
would be faster since you would not refine the already valid cells.

I agree that at some point this would be an extension to do. However, I think that it should not be now and that the current implementation has its advantages:

- The test at the moment is compatible and in the sense as comparisons etc. work in RIF/CIF:

  ```
  sage: RIF(1,3) < RIF(2,4)
  False
  ```
  returns `True/False` and not unknown. I think there were a lot of discussions going on about this during Py3 comparison discussions. Apparently this is still so in SageMath, so this should be done consistently in all of the module.

- It is easy to use in the sense what the input test-function should be/return and what the result of `bisect` will be. Therefore this function is suitable for the end user; one main goal of this function.

- The proposed change has a different result; see below.

Faster yes, but gives a different result. The current implementation results in small intervals that satisfy the condition, whereas your proposed solution would find some possible large intervals. One could, of course, do this by the proposed functionality, but rather complicated by searching for the inverse and then inverting the result again, which speaks against the simplicity in usage.

This can only be simplified if we talk about real intervals, but not if we talk about complex intervals, or do I miss something here?

Indeed. For complex intervals you want a quad-tree not a binary tree.

Good. Then it shoud be clear that all the functionalities will be forward compatible.

The workaround is very simple

```
sage: def is_really_less_than(a,b):
....:     if a < b: return True
....:     elif b <= a: return False
....:     else: return Unknown
sage: is_really_less_than(RIF(1,2), RIF(3,4))
True
sage: is_really_less_than(RIF(1,3), RIF(2,4))
Unknown
```

When roots are isolated you typically switch to something else. If you know that f has a unique root in [0,1] you would not implement the bisection the way this function proceed. Moreover, if you want really small intervals, Newton method is better suited. So the fact that the code in the current branch does more than the minimum amount of work is a downside to me.

Newton can only be done if the function is differentiable, which is not assumed by the current implementation.

After all, this might be difficult, as already the output and the desired functionality seems to be different in our two cases. Do you have something particular in mind here?
