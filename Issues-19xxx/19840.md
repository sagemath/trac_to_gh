There is a bug in the code to compute 5-isogenies of elliptic curves of j-invariant 1728, when 5 is a square.

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^4 - 5*x^2 + 5)
sage: E = EllipticCurve([a^2 + a + 1, a^3 + a^2 + a + 1, a^2 + a,
17*a^3 + 34*a^2 - 16*a - 37, 54*a^3 + 105*a^2 - 66*a - 135])
sage: E.j_invariant()
1728
sage: K(5).is_square()
True
sage: E.isogenies_prime_degree(5)
ValueError: The polynomial does not define a finite subgroup of the elliptic curve.
```
or more directly

```
sage: from sage.schemes.elliptic_curves.isogeny_small_degree import isogenies_5_1728
sage: isogenies_5_1728(E)
ValueError: The polynomial does not define a finite subgroup of the elliptic curve.
```

I wrote this code about 5 years ago, and will fix it.

Depends on #19689

Component: **elliptic curves**

I found the bug: on line 868, `a*(beta**2-2)/6` should be `(beta**2-2*a)/6`.

The bug was not caught by the doctests since the only example where this code was tested had a=1.
