by the way, `bool` is only a smaller part of the slowness:

```
sage: timeit('matrix(ZZ, [[1 if (x-y).is_square() else -1 for x in K_list] for y in K_list])')
25 loops, best of 3: 27.9 ms per loop
sage: timeit('matrix(ZZ, [[2*((x-y).is_square()-5) for x in K_list] for y in K_list])')
5 loops, best of 3: 57.1 ms per loop
sage: timeit('matrix(ZZ, [[2*((x-y).is_square()-.5) for x in K_list] for y in K_list])')
5 loops, best of 3: 265 ms per loop
```
appearance of `float` causes most of the slowness.

Replying to [dimpase](#comment%3A13):
> why are there tests marked `# random` ?


the only possible source of randomness here I can imagine is in the construction of
the finite fields. But if you add `conway=True` then it's deterministic for sure, for Conway polynomial is unique for any given order...

The random is indeed caused by the finite field, and the order in which the elements are enumerated. Also these functions are now tested heavily, so whatever is returned by those functions should be what the user expects.
