We currently have no generic class for subalgebras. In this ticket, we should implement basic features for magmatic subalgebras of a magmatic algebra with a basis:

- finding a basis,
- centralizers of a subset of elements, and
- some improvements for submodules.

This will also promote some methods such as `center` to the category of magmatic algebras.

<a id='comment:3'></a>Some things that might need a discussion:

- I made the lift map from a submodule a coercion.
- I made a distinction between a subalgebra and a unital subalgebra, where the latter enforces that unit match in the subalgebra.
- Move code up to magamatic algebras, but it should be okay since it only involves products of 2 elements.
- How to better incorporate axiomatic information to the category of the subalgebras. For example, subalgebras of algebras of finite groups are always unital, but this is not reflected currently in the category setup because it seemed like too much of a headache right now.

Thoughts?

For a future ticket, we should implement `idealizer` (equivalent to a normalizer for Lie algebras).
