I had a quick look at the code:

IMHO inefficient; `has_same_summands` should do better, since no new mutable posets have to be created.

`SR` uses the commutativity of the multiplication sometimes, so LaTeX-output might differ from repr-output. I suggest to implement `_latex_` for terms and growth groups as they know what to do.

I'd even use `_has_same_summands_`, the parent is certainly the same so this is even more efficient. Will change later.

That was/is my original plan, and this is also the reason why I didn't set this to `needs_review`. ;-) However, I wanted to have nice (growth-ordered) latex-output quickly in order to check the output of the singularity analysis generator; and this was the simplest implementation I could think of. The code is just dumped here.

I'll also split this ticket into two.
