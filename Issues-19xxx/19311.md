We can have one if you feel like adding it. What I fear the most is writing the doc, personally... e.g. define it properly.

So as it is only used once for the moment.

Here are my last 30 minutes, just because you requested it.

Since you wanted an independent function, there are holes that you can help fill: the matrix is currentl a matrix of homogeneous coordinates but the zeroes must not be anywhere (if I remember correctly), and that needs to be explained properly. There is also an obvious need of a doctest.

Feel free to change the function's arguments if you do not want a matrix but something else instead.
