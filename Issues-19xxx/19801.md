Replying to [@jm58660](#comment%3A3):
> Daniel showed some signs of life, hence selected as a possible reviewer. `:=)`.

I had a quick look; here are a first few comments:

1. Everywhere: I believe the term "maximal element" is wrong; it should be "greatest element" (Wikipedia confirms this).

2. Link to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocomplement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocomplement) in the doc.

3. `None` vs. raising an exception if pseudocomplement does not exist. Although I prefer the exception variant; it seems that `None` seems to be the design choice in the poset-files. Am I right? However, this should definitely be documented in an OUTPUT-block; so include OUTPUT-blocks.

4. PEP8: IMHO it should be: `{0: [1, 2], 1: [3], 2: [4], 3: [4]}` (spaces after `:`)

5. `None not in [H.pseudocomplement(e) for e in H]` is inefficient, since the full list is created. You can use `all(H.pseudocomplement(e) is not None for e in H)` instead.

<a id='comment:7'>Comment 7:</a>
Some more comments (sorry I've missed some things last time):

7. lattices.py, L261: ident to after "(" of line above and PEP8-ify.

8. INPUT-blocks in hasse_diagram.py and lattices.py: According to developer guide put a `--` instead of the `-` after the parameter name.

9. I see the INPUT/OUTPUT-blocks more as a technical description, so instead of

```
``element`` - an element of the lattice whose pseudocomplement is returned.
```
  I would write simply

```
``element`` - an element of the lattice
```
  Similarly in the OUTPUT-block I would rewrite

```
The pseudocomplement of an ``element``, if it exists. Otherwise ``None``.
```
  to

```
An element of the lattice or ``None`` if the pseudocomplement does not exist.
```
  (maybe rewrite the second part...)
  Now you get the additional information that the element returned is from the lattice (instead of the already known fact that I get the pseudocomplement).

10. hasse_diagram.py

```
[...] It may not exist, and then the function returns ``None``.
```
  This paragraph contains the actual defintion of the pseudocomplement. May the return value should be mentioned in the OUTPUT block (add an OUTPUT block to this function). INPUT/OUTPUT-block here could say that ``element`` and the returned value are integers.

I hope you don't find this too picky... (on the other hand, you wanted me to review it ;) )

Test pass, doc builds and looks okay.

Better to do this correctly in first time. And both picky and non-picky reviewer are better than no reviewer at all.

> 8. INPUT-blocks in hasse_diagram.py and lattices.py: According to developer guide put a `--` instead of the `-` after the parameter name.

Yes, clearly.

> 7. lattices.py, L261: ident to after "(" of line above and PEP8-ify.

I corrected this, and also same for `is_pseudocomplemented()`. Actually I don't know what would be best way to make an example. They should be small but not trivial. Also 80 character limit is maybe too restrictive for examples? A picture?

OK. There is a point in this (and on comment 10 which is similar).
