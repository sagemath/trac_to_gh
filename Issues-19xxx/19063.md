<a id='comment:10'></a>I have now reviewed this patch and added a few reviewer commits.

Questions:

* `ComplexBall.__init__`: why `Element.__init__` instead of `RingElement.__init__`

* `.some_elements`: Is `1/3` intentional (this is an elaborate way of writing 0 in python)

* Why is the representation `real - imag*I` restricted to exact negative imaginary parts and does not apply to
  `1 + [-0.333]*I`

* `.__contains__`, `.contains_exact`: why do we have two distinct methods here? Why is an integer or a rational as the argument of `.__contains__` not handeled separately by the relevant .acb functions?

Apart from that, a few documentation issues:

* `_complex_mpfr_field_`: missing INPUT: section (parameter `parent`)

* `_real_mpfi_`: missing INPUT: section (parameter parent), One-sentence-description mentions "real number" instead of "real interval".

* `_mpfr_`: missing INPUT: section (parameter `parent`)

* `.mid`, `.squash`: missing OUTPUT: section

* `.mid` should have "see also" section (`.squash`)

* `.identical` refers to a method `contains` which does not exist.

* `.contains_exact`, `.identical`, `.overlaps`: missing INPUT: section (parameter `other`)

Thanks!

> Questions:

Because I neglected to change it after changing the parent class. (I hate Python...)

> * `.some_elements`: Is `1/3` intentional (this is an elaborate way of writing 0 in python)


It wasn't intentional.

> * Why is the representation `real - imag*I` restricted to exact negative imaginary parts and does not apply to
>   `1 + [-0.333]*I`


The old version would return things like `1.000000000000000 + - 0.5000000000000000*I` for exactly representable imaginary parts. I only implemented a minimal fix, thinking that the version with `... + [...]` was clear enough and perhaps clearer otherwise (especially for intervals containing zero), but I have no strong feelings either way.

> * `.__contains__`, `.contains_exact`: why do we have two distinct methods here? Why is an integer or a rational as the argument of `.__contains__` not handeled separately by the relevant .acb functions?


The idea was to have a version that first converts its argument to a ball (and thus can accept a wide range of argument types), but may not recognize that the argument is contained in the other ball if the conversion is not precise enough, and a version for which a result of `False` always guarantees that the argument is not in the ball.

Thanks. But note that the formal requirement of pointless INPUT/OUTPUT sections in docstrings is apparently going to be relaxed (#19041), so I'm not sure we need them INPUT sections every time you noted they were missing.

If I remember correctly, there is some reason not to use `super`.

I only implemented a minimal fix, thinking that the version with `... + [...]` was clear enough and perhaps clearer otherwise (especially for intervals containing zero), but I have no strong feelings either way.


No strong feelings from my side; I was just wondering reading the code. For intervals containing the zero, it might indeed be strange.

I think that `rational in ball` and `integer in ball` should give correct results in any case.

I know; the question is what is obvious and what not. My feelings are not very strong here.

Yes.

Regarding `center()`, I'd prefer to keep the name `mid()`, if only to emphazise that the midpoint is part of the defining data of the ball (and thus always is exact, while `mpfi_mid()` involves a rounding), but I have nothing against adding `center()` as an alias.

For most practical purposes, the rounding or not is just an implementation detail. Personally, I would prefer to use just one method name (for example, I don't like that some types implement `prec()` and some implement `precision()` but not all implement both: that's just confusing). Given that `center()` has been around for a while, I would prefer to use `center()` (and only that) also for arb.
