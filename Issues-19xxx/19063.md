I have now reviewed this patch and added a few reviewer commits.

Questions:

* `ComplexBall.__init__`: why `Element.__init__` instead of `RingElement.__init__`

* `.some_elements`: Is `1/3` intentional (this is an elaborate way of writing 0 in python)

* Why is the representation `real - imag*I` restricted to exact negative imaginary parts and does not apply to
  `1 + [-0.333]*I`

* `.__contains__`, `.contains_exact`: why do we have two distinct methods here? Why is an integer or a rational as the argument of `.__contains__` not handeled separately by the relevant .acb functions?

Apart from that, a few documentation issues:

* `_complex_mpfr_field_`: missing INPUT: section (parameter `parent`)

* `_real_mpfi_`: missing INPUT: section (parameter parent), One-sentence-description mentions "real number" instead of "real interval".

* `_mpfr_`: missing INPUT: section (parameter `parent`)

* `.mid`, `.squash`: missing OUTPUT: section

* `.mid` should have "see also" section (`.squash`)

* `.identical` refers to a method `contains` which does not exist.

* `.contains_exact`, `.identical`, `.overlaps`: missing INPUT: section (parameter `other`)

Thanks!

Because I neglected to change it after changing the parent class. (I hate Python...)

It wasn't intentional.

The old version would return things like `1.000000000000000 + - 0.5000000000000000*I` for exactly representable imaginary parts. I only implemented a minimal fix, thinking that the version with `... + [...]` was clear enough and perhaps clearer otherwise (especially for intervals containing zero), but I have no strong feelings either way.

> * `.__contains__`, `.contains_exact`: why do we have two distinct methods here? Why is an integer or a rational as the argument of `.__contains__` not handeled separately by the relevant .acb functions?

The idea was to have a version that first converts its argument to a ball (and thus can accept a wide range of argument types), but may not recognize that the argument is contained in the other ball if the conversion is not precise enough, and a version for which a result of `False` always guarantees that the argument is not in the ball.

Thanks. But note that the formal requirement of pointless INPUT/OUTPUT sections in docstrings is apparently going to be relaxed (#19041), so I'm not sure we need them INPUT sections every time you noted they were missing.

No strong feelings from my side; I was just wondering reading the code. For intervals containing the zero, it might indeed be strange.

I think that `rational in ball` and `integer in ball` should give correct results in any case.

I know; the question is what is obvious and what not. My feelings are not very strong here.

Just a comment for a follow-up: it would be better to use method names more consistent with `RIF`/`CIF`:
* `above_abs` and `below_abs` should be renamed `magnitude` and `mignitude` for analogy with `RIF` and, after #19403, also `CIF`.
* `mid` should be `center`

Yes.

Regarding `center()`, I'd prefer to keep the name `mid()`, if only to emphazise that the midpoint is part of the defining data of the ball (and thus always is exact, while `mpfi_mid()` involves a rounding), but I have nothing against adding `center()` as an alias.
