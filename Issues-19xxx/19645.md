We remove explicit `depends` which are not needed because they are picked up by Cython anyway. In the case of `eclib`, it's not needed to depend on *every* header file, it is reasonable to assume that all `eclib` headers have the same timestamp.

This patch was checked by comparing the Cython metadata before and after this patch: look at the diff of the directory `$SAGE_ROOT/src/build/cythonized`.
