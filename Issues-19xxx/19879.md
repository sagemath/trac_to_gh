The file `src/sage/rings/arith.py` contains a bunch of "arithmetic" functions. I think this does not really belong in `rings` but in a new top-level directory. Eventually, we should move some more files (integer factorisation, sum of squares, Bernoulli numbers, continued fractions) there but we start with just the file `arith.py`.

I think that for the continuation `continued_fraction` should also move.

Do you mind waiting the next release cycle for starting moving things around?

On the contrary, I think that going to a new major release (6.10 -> 7.0) is a very good time to move things around.

But eventually that is the decision of the release manager and it should not affect reviewing this ticket.
