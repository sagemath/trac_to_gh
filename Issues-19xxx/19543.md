Here is another problem to fix:

```
sage: findstat({l:l.length() for l in Partitions(4)})

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
IOError                                   Traceback (most recent call last)
...
IOError: FindStat did not answer with a json response: Could not find FindStat collection for Binary words.
```
Before, we had the problem that FindStat was broken, so the thrown error was

```
IOError: FindStat did not answer with a json response: St000288 is not a FindStat statistic identifier.
```
I think that the finder functionality should never throw an error if one of the results is corrupted in any way (this way, the interface is robust even if FindStat is broken).

One quick idea: what about having a method `findstat.collections` such that

```
sage: findstat.collections()
{'Binary words': 'not supported',
 'Dyck paths': 'supported',
 'Permutations': 'supported'}
```
and if an unsupported collection is used, we throw an error like the one you have.
Good:

```
sage: findstat(289)
ValueError: Could not find FindStat collection for Binary words.
```
but unclear what to do in the above situation where a binary word statistic is found and we cannot throw an error...
