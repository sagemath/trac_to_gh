This patch makes `is_complemented()` much faster. Basically it does not compute every complement of every element, just what is needed. I.e. if `2` is a complement of `1`, it does not check if `3` and `1` are also complements; and if `4` has no complements, it returns `False` without searching complements for `5`, `6` and so on.

Let `L10` bet the list of all lattices of 10 elements and `B10` be the Boolean lattice with `2^10` elements. Then without the patch it takes 7,76 seconds to run `len([L for L in L10 if L.is_complemented()])` and 101,84 seconds to run `B10.is_complemented()`. With the patch the time for both of them reduces below one second.

Maybe this could be optimized further, as join and meet are commutative. However, now it is already quite fast.

HMmmm... The speedup is cool, but the algorithm is slightly less clear. Is it slower to do it like that:

```
from itertools import izip
for row1,row2 in izip(meet,join):
    for c1,c2 in izip(row1,row2):
        if c1==0 and c2==n-1:
            break
    else:
        retun False
return True
```

Sorry but it is a bit hard for me to try it today: I burned the two main fingers of my right hand while cooking, and I type mostly with my left hand `:-/`

She has a different opinion about mining? Amazing.

In the case at hand (if I may say), I do not see the need to generalize to cooking in general. Let me just hope that I will not make the same mistake, with the same hand, tomorrow morning.

I meant that mine was "matrix-based", i.e. the speed come from speed of matrix operations.

> Keep the one that is the fastest

Your implementation is faster.

Mélodie, can you review this? The code is now mostly from Nathann, but if it does not work, it might also be that I have made a mistake.

Even your code is not optimal, because meet and join are commutative operations. But it may be slower to optimize that, because the code would be more complicated.

Hi Jori,
I'm Mélodie's colleague and I reviewed the graph documentation ticket with her.

About your new ticket, now.

```diff
+        n = self.cardinality()-1
+        for row1,row2 in izip(mt, jn):
+            for c1,c2 in izip(row1,row2):
+                if c1==0 and c2==n:
```

You should respect the Python / Sage conventions and add spaces before and after binary operators of the lowest priority : `self.cardinality() - 1`, `c1  == 0`, etc. This includes equality and assignments.

As well, there should be spaces after every coma sign:  `row1, row2`, `c1, c2`, `izip(row1, row2)`. For more info on these conventions, see http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#python-code-style
