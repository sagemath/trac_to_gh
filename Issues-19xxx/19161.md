This patch makes `is_complemented()` much faster. Basically it does not compute every complement of every element, just what is needed. I.e. if `2` is a complement of `1`, it does not check if `3` and `1` are also complements; and if `4` has no complements, it returns `False` without searching complements for `5`, `6` and so on.

Let `L10` bet the list of all lattices of 10 elements and `B10` be the Boolean lattice with `2^10` elements. Then without the patch it takes 7,76 seconds to run `len([L for L in L10 if L.is_complemented()])` and 101,84 seconds to run `B10.is_complemented()`. With the patch the time for both of them reduces below one second.

Maybe this could be optimized further, as join and meet are commutative. However, now it is already quite fast.

```
from itertools import izip
for row1,row2 in izip(meet,join):

I meant that mine was "matrix-based", i.e. the speed come from speed of matrix operations.

Your implementation is faster.

Mélodie, can you review this? The code is now mostly from Nathann, but if it does not work, it might also be that I have made a mistake.

Not really. Original code checks ALL element pairs. My code takes one element, and kind of check it against all other elements, and stops when an element has no complement. Your code jumps to next element when it founds a complement and return `False` if it found an element without the complement.

Even your code is not optimal, because meet and join are commutative operations. But it may be slower to optimize that, because the code would be more complicated.

In any case, this is now quite fast and IMO ready for review.

<a id='comment:13'></a>Hi Jori,
I'm Mélodie's colleague and I reviewed the graph documentation ticket with her.

About your new ticket, now.

```diff
+        n = self.cardinality()-1
+        for row1,row2 in izip(mt, jn):
+            for c1,c2 in izip(row1,row2):
+                if c1==0 and c2==n:
```

You should respect the Python / Sage conventions and add spaces before and after binary operators of the lowest priority : `self.cardinality() - 1`, `c1  == 0`, etc. This includes equality and assignments.

As well, there should be spaces after every coma sign:  `row1, row2`, `c1, c2`, `izip(row1, row2)`. For more info on these conventions, see http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#python-code-style

sage: L = LatticePoset({0:[1,2,3],1:[4],2:[4],3:[4]})

```
sage: L = LatticePoset({0:[1,2],1:[3],2:[3],3:[4]})
