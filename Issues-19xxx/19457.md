We add a generator for full binary trees, and two methods :

- to_full() :
    Return the full binary tree `bt` obtained from `self` by replacing
    each leaf of `self` by nodes with two child leaves.

- remove_nodes_with_two_child_leaves()
    Return the binary tree obtained by replacing each node of `self`
    with two child leaves, by a leaf.

<a id='comment:4'>Comment 4:</a>
Yes.

I use the terminology given by the definition used in the implementation of binary trees : (see the documentation of the class BinaryTree from sage.combinat.binary_tree)

    Binary trees here mean ordered (a.k.a. plane) finite binary
    trees, where "ordered" means that the children of each node are
    ordered.

    Binary trees contain nodes and leaves, where each node has two
    children while each leaf has no children. The number of leaves
    of a binary tree always equals the number of nodes plus `1`.

Replying to [@tscrim](#comment%3A3):
> I would very much like this as I want to implement free magmatic algebras generated by a set `X` (which are indexed by complete binary trees and a word in the alphabet `X`). However the `to_full` will also add a leaf to internal nodes which do not have 2 children, and the other method will remove all leaves, correct?

The definition in `BinaryTree` is not correct as it does not allow for the "nodes" with one element. IMO, a leaf is a node too.

From a quick lookover, the reason why binary trees don't compare to full binary trees is that they have different parents. There is an abuse that `BinaryTrees_size` does not know it is a facade parent for `BinaryTrees_all`, but it is why the equality works. To make the equality work by continuing this abuse, you should make `FullBinaryTrees_all` act as a facade for `BinaryTrees_all`.

Let me know when you're ready for me to do a formal review.

As mentioned in [comment:7](#comment%3A7), why aren't you using facade parents in both `FullBinaryTrees_all` and `FullBinaryTrees_size`? This is designed for parents for which elements have other parents. Like non negative integers

```

You should put definitions of `FullBinaryTrees`.

I don't think the definition of `to_full` you give is correct: <code>Return the minimal full binary tree that is strictly larger than \`\`self\`\`.</code> With this definition, I would expect

  o                    o   o
```

What is the point of defining locally a function `to_full_rec` which is used only once in the code?

Thank you Travis for taking care of the façade issues, I did not know how to do it.

I did not find a nice name to replace `to_full`.

What about making a function `to_full` with an optional argument completion that can be equal to `minimal` or `bijective` :
 *`minimal` would give access to the operation you mentioned

 *`bijective` to the operation I wanted to implement initially

I don't think `to_full` should have such an argument and instead have it be the bijection to full binary trees. If we wanted this extra functionality, it would be better served as another method `to_minimal_full`.

Perhaps as another option, we rename `to_full` to the more verbose `to_full_binary_tree`. Although I do appreciate the more concise name.

Lastly, Vincent and I disagree with the inclusion of <code>\`\`self\`\`</code> in the docstrings in general. I do agree that it should not appear in the INPUT: block (unless special restrictions are needed), and I should have not included it as such. However, the rest of the file uses <code>\`\`self\`\`</code>, so I think that is a good case to continue using it in this file.

Patchbot is complaining about this (I believe):

```
+            k = (self._size - 1) / 2 # number of internal nodes
+            for i in range(k):
```
It says:

```
    TypeError: range() integer end argument expected, got float.
```
I assume you want `//`, not `/`, particularly with py3 in mind.
