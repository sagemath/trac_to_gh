```
The default "legend options" are empty, but this defaults everywhere to a gray legend with black text. This is difficult to read, especially when the result is printed (journal, thesis, etc.) or projected (as in a presentation).

Black-on-white is much better, and a drop shadow helps the legend stand out without affecting the text within.

It feels a little weird "enabling" something by default, but what it came down to for me is that it just looks better with the drop shadow than without. I realized that I was thinking about making it look worse just so a bit could be turned off.


> At least according to a lot of design stuff I read at some point about the equivalent CSS thing in web pages.


Creating drop shadows with CSS was a nightmare for other reasons. The standard way didn't work, and each browser had its own "beta" implementation (none of which agreed), and as usual, nothing worked in MSIE.

I do understand that adding bling bling should be done with care, but hopefully people agree that the drop shadow is unobtrusive and creates a nice contrast.


> Do you think a much lighter gray would work better?  Maybe the white might not distinguish enough between the stuff and the legend (sort of a random box).


Yeah, that's why I enabled the drop shadow by default. Anything darker than white makes the text harder to read, and "light gray" prints terribly.


> otherwise you can just change YOUR defaults, if I recall correctly.


It's really hard! But that argument works against me if somebody really likes the gray. This was the best I could come up with:

```
plot_impl = sage.plot.plot._plot

def mjo_plot(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    Replacement for the default plot function.

     - If there's a legend, set the background color to 'white' and
       give it a drop shadow.

    """
    default_legend_opts = { 'back_color': 'white',
                            'shadow': True }

    p = plot_impl(*args, **kwargs)
    p.set_legend_options(**default_legend_opts)

    return p

sage.plot.plot._plot = mjo_plot
```

You need to do the same for `list_plot` and all of the graphics primitives, too.

Put it where?

The old settings were equivalent to,

```
sage: p = plot(sin(x), legend_label='$\sin(x)$')
sage: p.set_legend_options(back_color=(0.9,0.9,0.9), shadow=False) # option 1
sage: p.show(legend_options={'back_color': (0.9,0.9,0.9), 'shadow': False}) # option 2
```

but there's no easy way to change the behavior wholesale. In[comment:3](#comment%3A3) I showed how I was able to do it for `plot`, but you would also have to do it for `list_plot`, `line`, `circle`, etc.
