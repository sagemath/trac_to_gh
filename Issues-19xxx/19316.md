```
Currently we have

```
sage: A.<y> = AsymptoticRing(growth_group='y^ZZ', coefficient_ring=QQ)
sage: (y^2 + O(y))^(1/2)  # not tested
y + O(1)
```
It is not tested, since the current implementation rewrites it to `exp(log(...))` which is not possible in `A`. There is a workaround:

```
sage: B.<z> = AsymptoticRing(growth_group='z^QQ * log(z)^QQ', coefficient_ring=QQ)
sage: (z^2 + O(z))^(1/2)
z + O(1)
```

The aim of this ticket is to make such things possible directly.

LGTM, merged in #19423 again and removed two code lines (were already commented out), which were used for testing purposes.
