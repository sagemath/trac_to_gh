As recommended by SageManifolds co-creator Eric Gourgoulhon, I added, in the folder for this new project named "Gravite" the Python script Rn.py which contains a number of classes to automate the creation of Euclidean spaces as manifolds, where one can call class methods to automatically construct the usual spherical and cylindrical coordinates, as expected.  I'll attach this Rn.py file to this ticket, and it's also available separately in my github repository Gravite, author being me, ernestyalumni.  Thanks, -EY
