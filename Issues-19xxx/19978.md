As recommended by SageManifolds co-creator Eric Gourgoulhon, I added, in the folder for this new project named "Gravite" the Python script Rn.py which contains a number of classes to automate the creation of Euclidean spaces as manifolds, where one can call class methods to automatically construct the usual spherical and cylindrical coordinates, as expected.
