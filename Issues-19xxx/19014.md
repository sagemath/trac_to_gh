Hi!

I think Sage was really missing a linear-time algorithm for strongly connected components (in particular, I implemented it because I need it for other algorithms). It improves a lot the old algorithm when the graph has many components, but it is a bit slower when the graph is connected, as shown by the following examples. In any case, I removed the old algorithm: I know that it might have been faster in some rare cases, but the difference is small, and the time spent to input the graph is usually bigger than the time needed to run this algorithm.

Do you like it?

Michele

Hello,

You have inverted the timing for GNM. I got

```
OLD algorithm
sage: set_random_seed(0)
sage: g = digraphs.RandomDirectedGNM(10000,30000)
sage: %timeit g.strongly_connected_components()
1 loops, best of 3: 7.87 s per loop
sage: g.add_cycle(g.vertices())
sage: %timeit g.strongly_connected_components()
100 loops, best of 3: 21 ms per loop
sage: g = digraphs.Circuit(100000)
sage: %timeit g.strongly_connected_components()
10 loops, best of 3: 142 ms per loop

NEW algorithm
sage: set_random_seed(0)
sage: g = digraphs.RandomDirectedGNM(10000,30000)
sage: %timeit g.strongly_connected_components()
100 loops, best of 3: 21.5 ms per loop
sage: g.add_cycle(g.vertices())
sage: %timeit g.strongly_connected_components()
10 loops, best of 3: 22.1 ms per loop
sage: g = digraphs.Circuit(100000)
sage: %timeit g.strongly_connected_components()
10 loops, best of 3: 260 ms per loop
```

I agree that the gain for non-strongly connected digraphs is so high that it is worth the small increase for strongly connected digraphs.

I have some remarks:
- Do we really need to have both `_tarjan_strongly_connected_components` and `tarjan_strongly_connected_components` ? Same for other methods. What's the motivation behind?
- What's the need for returning a dictionary? it is immediately converted to a list of lists in `strongly_connected_components`. Do you need this feature for something else?
- You have let another version of `strongly_connected_components` in `static_sparse_graph.pyx`. Is this method used somewhere?
- Have you tried using an array of short instead of a bitset for `in_scc_stack` ? We don't have memory issue here so we can save some operations, plus you already do that for `visited`
- In `_strongly_connected_components_digraph` you have but you don't use `MemoryAllocator`. Here also, you could use array of shorts instead of bitset.
- I don't really see the benefit of using numpy (I don't know it). Is it just more convenient or also faster that other methods? You could use something like

```
d = {i:list() for i in range(nscc)}
for u,i in scc.iteritems():
    d[i].append(u)
output = [d[i] for i in range(nscc)]
```

Is there any slowdown for `is_strongly_connected`?

{

Hello!

I think that the method `is_strongly_connected` does not depend on this patch, and what you are proposing is already implemented in routine `is_strongly_connected` in `c_graph` (which also saves some time since it does not copy the whole graph). 

Indeed, this method is much simpler than computing SCCs: it performs a forward and backward visit from any node, and sees if we reach all vertices. Hence, I think it should be left as it is. For completeness, I attach the code of this routine.

Soon I will correct all the issues you raised in comment 5!

See you,

Michele

```
    def is_strongly_connected(self):
        cdef int v_int = 0
        cdef CGraph cg = self._cg

        # Pick one vertex
        v_int = bitset_first(cg.active_vertices)

        if v_int == -1:
            return True

        v = self.vertex_label(v_int)

        cdef int n = 0
        for _ in self.depth_first_search(v):
            n += 1
        if cg.num_verts != n:
            return False
        n = 0
        for _ in self.depth_first_search(v, reverse=True):
            n += 1
        return cg.num_verts == n
```

Ups, sorry! Clearly, the fastest method was the new one.

Well, probably the problem is that I'm a theoretical guy, and if the algorithm is linear I want a linear implementation. This is why I used an array and not a dictionary (and, as far as I know, numpy is the only way to build an array of Python objects). However, if we use a dictionary, the running-time is almost the same, even when there are a lot of SCCs. I deleted numpy and now I use dictionaries.

If you plan to call these methods directly from other cython files, it make sense to split the method in two pieces.
With Nathann we recently started to name such methods `compute_cool_stuff_C` rather than `_compute_cool_stuff`. I don't know if there is a general rule for that.

Well, bitsets are really fast, and to be honest we save very little using an array instead. The code is shorter. This is already something.

This is why I used an array and not a dictionary (and, as far as I know, numpy is the only way to build an array of Python objects).

another option (don't know if it is faster or not)

```
cdef int i
cdef list output = list(list() for i in range(nscc))  # We cannot use [] here
for i,v in enumerate(G.vertex_iterator()):
    output[scc[i]].append(v)
```

Method `strongly_connected_components_digraph`:
- is not currently called by `DiGraph().strongly_connected_components_digraph()` and will certainly never be
- seems more complicated than what it should. Indeed, as soon as you have a mapping `vertex->scc` you can simply iterate over the edges `(u,v)` of the input digraph and add edges `(scc[u],scc[v])` to the output digraph. I don't see the need for the `_strongly_connected_components_digraph` method and it is rather complicated.



General comments:
- `if visited[u] == 0:` -> `if not visited[u]`
- `return [output, {v:scc[i] for i,v in enumerate(G.vertices())}]` -> `return output, {v:scc[i] for i,v in enumerate(G.vertices())}`  no need for explicitely creating a list
- you have broken doctests caused by this ticket. I have not tracked the dependencies.

The problem is the order in which strongly connected components are outputted in the list: we can change the results without any problem. In the following, I try to explain why.

The J-classes are sets of elements in a semigroups satisfying a specific property (for more information, see http://www.liafa.jussieu.fr/~jep/PDF/HandBook.pdf). The difference amont the results is the order in which the elements are listed, but since in sets the order does not count, both results are correct.

Here, the difference is the order in which the two classes of idempotents are outputted. Since method j_classes_of_idempotents does not set a specific order, both results are correct.

> **********************************************************************

Here, we simply get one element from the classes found in the previous example: the order is maintained. Hence, both results are again correct.

Here, 'abc' is in the same class of idempotents as 'acb', and 'bc' is in the same class of idempotents as 'cb', as shown by the example before this one. Since this routine should output one idempotent per class, we are fine!

Just a detail, for future references:

```
cdef int i
cdef list output = list(list() for i in range(nscc))  # We cannot use [] here
for i,v in enumerate(G.vertex_iterator()):
output[scc[i]].append(v)

```
If we use `G.vertex_iterator()`, the vertex labels are not correct (I also added an example with labels, that shows the problem). With `G.vertices()`, everything works fine.

Why?

In method `tarjan_strongly_connected_components_C`, you could do the following:

```
if visited[v]:
   continue
```
and then remove one level of indentation.

In method `strongly_connected_components_digraph_C`.

```
   output.edges = <uint32_t *> sage_malloc(m*sizeof(uint32_t))
   if output.edges == NULL and output.m != 0:
       raise ValueError("Problem while allocating memory (edges)")
   output.neighbors = <uint32_t **> sage_malloc((1+<int>output.n)*sizeof(uint32_t *))
   if output.neighbors == NULL and output.m != 0:
       raise ValueError("Problem while allocating memory (neighbors)")
```
must be replaced by something link

```
   if output.m==0:
      << DO APPROPRIATE OPERATIONS FOR THIS CASE >>
      << RETURN >>

   output.edges     = <uint32_t *> sage_malloc(m*sizeof(uint32_t))
   output.neighbors = <uint32_t **> sage_malloc((1+<int>output.n)*sizeof(uint32_t *))
   if output.edges == NULL or output.neighbors == NULL:
       raise MemoryError("Problem while allocating memory (edges or neighbors).")
```
This is not only a cosmetic change since when `m==0` you allow `output.neighbors==NULL` before the instruction `output.neighbors[0] = output.edges`. So your code is currently not safe.


Otherwise, the method is working very well

```
Before
sage: set_random_seed(0)
sage: D = digraphs.RandomDirectedGNM(100000,500000)
sage: D.is_strongly_connected()
False
sage: %time res = D.strongly_connected_components()
len(res)
CPU times: user 3min 50s, sys: 4.28 s, total: 3min 55s
Wall time: 3min 56s
sage: len(res)
1413

With this patch
sage: set_random_seed(0)
sage: D = digraphs.RandomDirectedGNM(100000,500000)
sage: D.is_strongly_connected()
False
sage: %time res = D.strongly_connected_components()
CPU times: user 481 ms, sys: 16.2 ms, total: 497 ms
Wall time: 499 ms
sage: len(res)
1413
sage: D.allow_multiple_edges(True)
sage: D
Multi-digraph on 100000 vertices
sage: D.add_edges(D.edges())
sage: D.size()
1000000
sage: %time res = D.strongly_connected_components()
CPU times: user 566 ms, sys: 20.4 ms, total: 587 ms
Wall time: 594 ms
sage: len(res)
1413
```
and as you can see, I also tried with a multi-digraph and its working as expected.

David.

Probably, you meant

```
if visited[u]:
    continue
```
because the line `if visited[v]:` is followed by an else. Correct?

Hmm, I did as you said, but the same problem might occur also in `init_short_digraph`: if there are no edges, we set `edges=malloc(0)`, and in the next line we test if edges is `NULL`. The result of `malloc(0)` depends on the compiler implementation ![1], so for some compilers it might output `NULL` by default. Do you think we should open a ticket solving this issue?

I have checked in files `sage/ext/memory_allocator.pyx`. It uses methods like `check_allocarray` which can be found in `memory.pxd`. These methods ensure that if `n==0` then the returned pointer is `NULL`, and this is compiler independent. Furthermore, these methods raise an error if something goes wrong with malloc. So no need for opening a ticket, it's already done ;)
So if you want to be on the safe side and to ease your life, use the memory allocator and/or the `check_alloc` methods, depending on the context.
In your code, it means that you can call

```
output.edges = <uint32_t *> check_allocarray(m, sizeof(uint32_t))
```
and then remove the NULL test.

Of course, what you did for the case `m==0` is also important. 

David.

Hello,

could you change in the doctest of `tarjan_strongly_connected_components`

```
       sage: for i in range(100):                                     # long
       ...        g = digraphs.RandomDirectedGNP(100,.05)
```
with

```
       sage: for i in range(100):                                     # long
       ....:      g = digraphs.RandomDirectedGNP(100,.05)
```
so use `...` with `....:` for continuation.
Sorry to miss it before.
And also you can now change `for i in range(100)` with something small in all test.

David.
