For some packages which can be installed without dependencies, add an explicit `# no dependencies`. Note that this list of packages might not be exhaustive.

<a id='comment:5'>Comment 5:</a>
After applying the branch, the following packages still miss a `dependencies` file:

```
4ti2
benzene
bliss
cbc
cmake
configure
csdp
database_gap
database_odlyzko_zeta
database_pari
dot2tex
fricas
gambit
gap_packages
gdb
gf2x
git_trac
igraph
latte_int
libtheora
lidia
lrslib
mathjax
mcqd
modular_decomposition
normaliz
nose
ore_algebra
palp
sage_mode
threejs
topcom
```

I am not sure regarding the description of the ticket, does this means that for the packages you created a `dependencies` file, you are sure that they do not have any dependency, while the remaining still have to be checked ?

Concerning the ones from the previous list, the `SPKG.txt` sometimes give good hints.
