Currently, `determinisation`, `product_FiniteStateMachine` and related functions construct colors as frozensets or tuples of colors of its constituent states. If all colors are None, this leads to strange artifacts:

```
sage: A = Automaton([(0, 0, 0)], initial_states=[0], final_states=[0])
sage: [s.color for s in A.determinisation().iter_states()]
[frozenset({None})]
sage: [s.color for s in A.cartesian_product(A).iter_states()]
[(None, None)]
sage: T = Transducer([(0, 0, 0, 0)], initial_states=[0], final_states=[0])
sage: [s.color for s in T.composition(T).iter_states()]
[(None, None)]
sage: [s.color
....:  for s in T.product_FiniteStateMachine(
....:       T, lambda t1, t2: (0, 0)).iter_states()]
[(None, None)]
```

In those case, just use the color `None` if all constituent states have color `None`.
