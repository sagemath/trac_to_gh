Work around for #18192 such that the documentation builds properly when `-Infinity` is used as default argument.

Also replace

```
if name not in firstline:
    ...
signature = firstline.split(name, 1)[-1]
if signature.startswith("(") and signature.endswith(")"):
    ...
```
by a single regexp search.
