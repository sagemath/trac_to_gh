In this ticket, we propose a default implementation of `__ne__` methods for `AbstractLinearCode`, `Encoder` and `Decoder` classes, which means one will only need to implement `__eq__` in the subclasses.

This new `__ne__` simply returns the inverse of the return value of `__eq__`.

<a id='comment:3'></a>I removed the old implementation of `__ne__` in `grs.py`, created generic implementation for the top classes `Decoder`, `Encoder` and `AbstractLinearCode` and implemented `__eq__` for encoders in `linear_code.py`.

This is now open for review.
