This branch adds a zoom+move feature to Graph.show(method='js').

A graphical bug remains when moving the whole graph after moving a specific vertex, but I have no idea how to fix that and the feature is really useful, even like that `:-/`

<a id='comment:3'></a>ok, works. A bit rough, certainly. Jumps in strange ways. And the size of vertices
grows with the zoom, as well as the width of the edges. So it is not very useful
to see large graphs more clearly. Still interesting to have, I would say, but this
really breaks the nice smoothness of the existing viewer.

By the way, may we close #13418, now that there is method='js' ?

<a id='comment:4'></a>I use it to visualize very large graphs. Some of them are a bit like that:

```
sage: g = Graph()
sage: g.add_cycle(range(1000))
sage: g.show(method='js')
```

As you can see, without a zoom this javascript visualization is totally useless.

The zoom, as you noticed, is a 'graphical' zoom and not a 'semantic' zoom.

<a id='comment:11'></a>Hellooooooo !

Thanks for having looked at this ticket.

What do you mean by 'reapply it to the latest version' ? The git branch is a bit old indeed but that file has not been touched since, and the fact that the branch's name appears in green in the ticket means that it is still compatible with the latest beta.

I can add a merge commit if you prefer, but that's technically useless.
