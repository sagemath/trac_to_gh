This branch adds a zoom+move feature to Graph.show(method='js').

A graphical bug remains when moving the whole graph after moving a specific vertex, but I have no idea how to fix that and the feature is really useful, even like that `:-/`

By the way, may we close #13418, now that there is method='js' ?

I use it to visualize very large graphs. Some of them are a bit like that:

```
sage: g = Graph()
sage: g.add_cycle(range(1000))
sage: g.show(method='js')
```

As you can see, without a zoom this javascript visualization is totally useless.

The zoom, as you noticed, is a 'graphical' zoom and not a 'semantic' zoom. Another zoom that adapts the size of nodes may be doable (I don't know much about javascript), though perhaps 'zooming out' to visualize the whole graph (as you can don on the example I gave) would become useless, with too big vertices that would then hide the actual graph. I don't know.

> By the way, may we close #13418, now that there is method='js' ?


+1 from me.

Here is a very very small commit that changes the default list of colors used by d3js. We used to select "category20" but as you can see consecutive colors can be very close to each other, and it made visualization more difficult.

http://bl.ocks.org/aaizemberg/78bd3dade9593896a59d

Now this looks better:

```
sage: graphs.PathGraph(10).show(method='js',vertex_partition=[[i] for i in range(10)])

Hellooooooo !

Thanks for having looked at this ticket.

What do you mean by 'reapply it to the latest version' ? The git branch is a bit old indeed but that file has not been touched since, and the fact that the branch's name appears in green in the ticket means that it is still compatible with the latest beta.

I can add a merge commit if you prefer, but that's technically useless.
