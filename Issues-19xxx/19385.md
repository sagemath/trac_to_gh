As was done earlier with #19381, this branch strips some code out of digraph.py and stores it in `graph_input.py`.

Fortunately, most of `graph_input.py` can be reused for digraphs, so that's a net decrease in code volume in general.

Nathann

P.S.: I cannot believe all that this code does in order to guess what the user meants when he provides bad/incomplete/crazy input.

Depends on #19381

Simon: sorry to disturb, but I think I will need your help for this branch. All doctests pass in graph/ except for a test in `DiGraph.path_semigroup` that I absolutely do not understand `:-/`

Here is a trace, though it will appear soon on the patchbot (and I expect other related doctests to fail in combinat/).

I'll have a look. Obviously, we should either use an immutable version of a digraph, or (something which seems to be new) implement _cache_key.

I tried to make `Q` immutable but the result was the same. And anyway, this branch shouldn't have any effect on that `:-/`

Somehow you're breaking this behavior:

```
Q = Q.copy(immutable=True, weighted=True)
```
and the result is a mutable digraph.

If you build a graph from a matrix in which all weights are 1 it is not considered as weighted. If any weight is different from 1 then it is considered to be weighted.

To me, this looks like a dangerous behaviour.

Of course, if now some of the weights is not integer, then what will it be ?...

```
sage: Graph(0.5*graphs.PetersenGraph().adjacency_matrix())
Graph on 10 vertices
sage: Graph(0.5*graphs.PetersenGraph().adjacency_matrix()).weighted()
True
```

Weighted !!!!
