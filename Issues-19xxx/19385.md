As was done earlier with #19381, this branch strips some code out of digraph.py and stores it in `graph_input.py`.

Fortunately, most of `graph_input.py` can be reused for digraphs, so that's a net decrease in code volume in general.

Nathann

P.S.: I cannot believe all that this code does in order to guess what the user meants when he provides bad/incomplete/crazy input.

Depends on #19381

Simon: sorry to disturb, but I think I will need your help for this branch. All doctests pass in graph/ except for a test in `DiGraph.path_semigroup` that I absolutely do not understand `:-/`

Here is a trace, though it will appear soon on the patchbot (and I expect other related doctests to fail in combinat/).

I'll have a look. Obviously, we should either use an immutable version of a digraph, or (something which seems to be new) implement _cache_key.

Somehow you're breaking this behavior:

```
Q = Q.copy(immutable=True, weighted=True)
```
and the result is a mutable digraph.

If you build a graph from a matrix in which all weights are 1 it is not considered as weighted. If any weight is different from 1 then it is considered to be weighted.

+1 here. Not only it drives me mad, but the code has to deal with all that and decide it (and God it is ugly), and of course this comes at the cost of over-analysing the input, which takes time.

Gladly. Anyway, I prefer to explain why people have to be explicit in what they want rather than explain the 10 different combinations of parameters that [will/will not] yield what they expect.
