This branch improves the interface of hadamard_matrix.

- It adds it in `matrix.<tab>`
- It checks the returned results ('check' flag)
- It can test for the existence of a construction in Sage (useful for SRG code)

You might consider using the flint functions fmpz_mat_hadamard and fmpz_mat_is_hadamard, which should be faster.

Checking by default seems kind of useless since this is much slower than generating the matrix (generating a size 1000 Hadamard matrix takes 0.01 seconds and checking it takes 0.5 seconds), and unit testing should provide reasonable certainty that the algorithm is correct.

How easily can I call them on a Sage matrix?

Sorry to disappoint, but I have thousands of line behind me (in combinat/designs/) that implement old combinatorial designs from lost papers. I know the value of this kind of testing.

Are you saying that flint can be easily accessed from Sage *and* that it contains a database of hadamard matrices? If so, I woulld be glad to call it from the general constructor of hadamard matrices in Sage.

It should be enough (untested) to add the following declarations in libs/flint/fmpz_mat.pxd

```
    int fmpz_mat_hadamard(fmpz_mat_t A)
    int fmpz_mat_is_hadamard(const fmpz_mat_t A)
```

and the following methods in matrix/matrix_integer_dense.pyx

```
    def _hadamard(self):
        # in-place, returns whether successful
        return fmpz_mat_hadamard(self._matrix)

    def is_hadamard(self):
        return fmpz_mat_is_hadamard(self._matrix)
```

Then you can do something like this in hadamard_matrix()

```
    if not(n % 4 == 0) and (n > 2):
        raise ValueError
    mat = Matrix(ZZ, n, n)
    if mat._hadamard():
        return mat
    else:
        # use database here
        raise ValueError
```

You may well be right about combinatorial designs in general. But, having written the flint code, and considering that it implements a fairly simple algorithm, when it's already exhaustively tested up to size 300, I think it's highly unlikely to give an incorrect matrix for larger sizes. So I can't agree with slowing it down many orders of magnitude by default.

It doesn't have a database; it uses the Paley construction. As noted above, you can easily use a fallback database/algorithm if it fails.

BTW, fmpz_mat_hadamard succeeds for every multiple of 4 below 92; current code for the Paley construction in Sage doesn't succeed to construct a size 20 Hadamard matrix.

HMmmm.. I don't feel much at ease with adding matrix code, sorry. Especially if it is only implemented for a specific data structure and such.

> You may well be right about combinatorial designs in general. But, having written the flint code, and considering that it implements a fairly simple algorithm, when it's already exhaustively tested up to size 300, I think it's highly unlikely to give an incorrect matrix for larger sizes. So I can't agree with slowing it down many orders of magnitude by default.

Unless you do intend to use this code, couldn't you trust the opinion of those who do and develop it?

I know how many hours, night and weeks I wasted because of a typo in data or in code. You wouldn't mind slowing by "several orders of magnitude" a function like `.__repr__` because it is never a critical. Do you generate Hadamard matrices intensively? Furthermore you can disable the check with 'check=False'. Please don't turn this ticket into a war just because of a check you can disable, which saved my skin innumerable times in similar code. It's not worth it. I know it, and I need the flag. Besides, checking the constructions is already the default for all other design constructions.

> It doesn't have a database; it uses the Paley construction. As noted above, you can easily use a fallback database/algorithm if it fails.

More constructions of hadamard matrices may come. Others may be pure data. Other may be recursive constructions on both.

> BTW, fmpz_mat_hadamard succeeds for every multiple of 4 below 92; current code for the Paley construction in Sage doesn't succeed to construct a size 20 Hadamard matrix.

Then there must be another bug somewhere. This code clearly needs some testing.

Two updates:

1) With this branch, Sage can build a matrix for n=20. It's one of the bugs I fixed
2) There is no Paley construction for 52 on [1]. Either you get the data somewhere else or there is something wrong in that code.

IMHO it says that your fmpz_mat_is_hadamard is far from optimal.
Indeed, you neither need to take the transpose nor to do full matrix multiplication.

As you fisrt check that the matrix is +/-1, you don't need to check that the diagonal entries of HH.T are all n.
So you only need to do scalar products of n(n-1)/2 rows...

(I understand that Hadamard matrices in FLINT don't do any serious job, they are there for testing or so; if one was after real speed there, you'd be using BLAS...)

No, I am not saying that you can do the scalar product of two matrix rows in constant time. :-)

But at least you can replace

```
   for (i = 0; i < n && result; i++)
        for (j = 0; j < n && result; j++)
            result = (*fmpz_mat_entry(C, i, j) == n * (i == j));

```
with

```
   for (i = 0; i < n && result; i++)
        for (j = i+1; j < n && result; j++)
            result = (*fmpz_mat_entry(C, i, j) == 0);
```

another possible optimisation would be to have a dedicated function for matrix multiplication with the symmetric result (for `HH^T` is symmetric; other possible use would be to compute product of commuting symmetric matrices).

That part of the tests amounts to approximately 0.000% of the total running time.

In any case, a constant factor anywhere in the code doesn't fundamentally change the imbalance between testing and generating, as you suggested above.

The reason testing is far slower is not a factor 2 inefficiency (or even a factor 6 or whatever from not using BLAS) in the matrix multiplication, but the fact that constructing a Hadamard matrix is only  `O(n^2)` while testing is `O(n^omega)`.

On a good BLAS, the speed-up is a function of the number of cores available... Then, as we know, the devil is in the constants; if matrices were optimised for the task at hand, you would only have started to notice on 10000x10000 matrices, not on 1000x1000.

Anyhow, this is an academic discussion.
