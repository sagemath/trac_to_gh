When doing "make test" and getting errors, it is visible in the terminal which test failed, what output was expected and what output was received. For example:

```
File "src/sage/matrix/matrix2.pyx", line 3804, in sage.matrix.matrix2.Matrix.diagonal.right_kernel
Failed example:
    P = B.right_kernel(basis = 'pivot'); P
Expected:
    Vector space of degree 4 and dimension 2 over Finite Field in a of size 5^2
    User basis matrix:
    [      4       4       1       0]
    [  a + 2 3*a + 3       0       1]
Got:
    Vector space of degree 4 and dimension 2 over Finite Field in a of size 5^2
    Basis matrix:
    [      4       4       1       0]
    [      0 2*a + 1   a + 2       1]
```

However, SAGE_ROOT/logs/test.log only says:

```
sage -t src/sage/matrix/strassen.pyx
    [69 tests, 1.60 s]
sage -t src/sage/matrix/matrix2.pyx
    [2191 tests, 5 failures, 18.24 s]
sage -t src/sage/modules/vector_complex_double_dense.pxd
    [0 tests, 0.00 s]
...
sage -t src/sage/matrix/matrix2.pyx  # 5 doctests failed
```

In other words, test.log does in fact *not* log test.
