Change the default notebook application in Sage to be `sagenb_export`. This small web application, built on top of Jupyter, acts as migration wizard which can convert legacy Sage notebooks to Jupyter. It also has buttons to run either the legacy Sage notebook server or the new Jupyter notebook server.

**Tarball**: http://sage.ugent.be/www/jdemeyer/sage/sagenb_export-3.1.tar.gz

Depends on #22458

Shouldn't the `DEPRECATION_NOTICE` be shown only when the "default" notebook is run?

And I certainly think this ticket needs a discussion on sage-devel (I have no opinion on the matter).

Small wording suggestion: change "The default notebook implementation changed" to "The default notebook implementation has changed".

Maybe it should say "The default notebook implementation has changed to Jupyter notebooks". I would prefer it if there were a method to convert old-style notebooks to new ones and that the deprecation notice described this method. I'm not sure if this is important enough to hold up a positive review for this ticket.

What happens to the Sage app on OS X? It starts a SageNB notebook server by default. Shouldn't that change, too? And print some sort of deprecation warning? I don't even see a way directly from the app to start a Jupyter server.

```

There is no information in the launch message as to where these notebooks are saved.  Turns out it is in the directory you launch from - dangerous for newbies to the Jupyter, especially if they have only launched with the Mac app bundle.  Also would cause that directory to get quite cluttered.

Is there a way to get output to typeset in Jupyter?  I don't know the answer.

Obviously, I get

```
NameError: name 'DATA' is not defined
```
when I rely on that.  Any solutions in mind for what to do with this folder?  Where do people using Jupyter keep data (in this case, an image file)?  I imagine there is a canonical answer to that but I'm not familiar with it.

Final comments. 
*  Interacts and even 3d stuff in the Jupyter notebook (done this way, I don't know about in general) seems ... very slow.  I think that lag explains the double images I occasionally see in interacts.  And since the only indication a cell isn't done is the little asterisk on the side, it's very different in style from sagenb.  That isn't a criticism but a comment.  I still feel ipynb is made more for power users... but anyway maybe the lag is weird.  Even `2+2` in a brand new notebook takes forever.  Maybe the issue is that the sagenb didn't start until Sage was started, but ipynb can open before the Sage kernel is "ready", Sage is notorious for taking forever to start up.

* `ERROR:root:Cell magic `%%fortran` not found.`

* I have similar problems with `%%cython` though it completes running such a cell.

As to the exporter itself, looks very nice. Thoughts:
*  I suspect it isn't possible to click on the "use Sage notebook" button once one has started converting, correct?  A message to that effect would be nice.
* A message for using the converter that says "your stuff will be saved in the following location" would be good - probably could be gotten on the fly from `pwd`, right?
* Ideally you'd get to click a button that says "remember my decision" for the default, but that might be too much extra work.
* More importantly, the button to the Jupyter just gives you a file listing - again, maybe not so helpful.  Ideas about what the default should be - maybe opening a new notebook with Sage kernel?

Is it? That would be good news. And a surprise to me indeed, at least
for the second part which I still consider as a quick hack.

Nothing is wrong with it (or maybe it is? I didn't test it yet), but people who had used it would be completely clueless as to this since they wouldn't have been exposed to command line at all, in principle, much less having to save it somewhere.

The cell runs, but then I can't use the function defined in it.  `%%fortran` is not recognized; `%%r` works but no graphics.

That is very understandable, as it is not used there much, more in later things.  I do know a fair number of people who have used it, and if it can't be emulated it means multi-input interacts become far less useful (because too hard to see all the controls at once).

Hmm, I guess I am even more of a beginner there :) What I would say is that the UI at a very minimum could have a warning the top saying something like "Want to export several worksheets at once?

I regularly use `%%cython` myself and never found any problems with it in Jupyer.

> kcrisman: what would be needed for you to give positive review to this ticket?

List (modulo merging this ticket and opening new 8.0 blockers for these):

* Some kind of batch conversion option (perhaps as Volker suggests), including detailed instructions as to exactly where they end up.  Opening a dialog as to where to save them would be really by far the best.  Here's why: any user who has not used the command line except to start the notebook (in particular, Mac app users) will be completely lost trying to find them if they are sent to the `pwd`.  In the Mac app that is in the midst of the bundle.
* Probably more wording on the export main page about exactly what it's doing, where things end up.  That wouldn't be too hard to get feedback on once one sends a beta out for testing.  Maybe that would include instructions on what to do to start a new notebook in Jupyter, how to get "text cells", typesetting as in the recent sage-devel post, etc.
* Testing whether this works properly with Mac app bundle at startup etc.  I have no idea how this interfaces with it (haven't had time to test that), but if we send 8.0 and basically drop GUI Mac support, that is really bad marketing.
* I would say that supporting remaining interact stuff (beyond what Jeroen has already fixed) would not be blocker, except that I think that Jupyter would be the only interface not supporting the layout parameter - is that correct?

A lot of this will be revealed in heavy testing.  We should definitely recruit *non*-Jupyter users to test this out.  Don't skimp!

> Yeah, I would hope we could have a pretty lengthy beta period for this 8.0, even if that means a few tickets have to wait to get in as I guess 8.0 is only about this and a few attendant things.  There are a few lists I'd like to spam about testing this out once a download of a beta becomes available (preferably also a Mac app version of the download, only for testing purposes).

See #19881 which was merged quite a while ago - I have never tried that out but perhaps it would be easy to integrate with this.

That should be fixable by chdir-ing to $HOME in the mac app...

Absolutely, but would have to be implemented - I don't want to ask a user who thinks dollar signs are for money to do it :-)

What happens with this in Jupyter?  Is it a supported thing (whether single or double percent)?

```
%hide
```
Same question for `#auto`/`%auto`.  These will be in many converted worksheets.
