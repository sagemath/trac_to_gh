Change the default notebook application in Sage to be `sagenb_export`. This small web application, built on top of Jupyter, acts as migration wizard which can convert legacy Sage notebooks to Jupyter. It also has buttons to run either the legacy Sage notebook server or the new Jupyter notebook server.

<a id='comment:9'></a>Small wording suggestion: change "The default notebook implementation changed" to "The default notebook implementation has changed".

Maybe it should say "The default notebook implementation has changed to Jupyter notebooks".

I'm not sure if this is important enough to hold up a positive review for this ticket.

What happens to the Sage app on OS X? It starts a SageNB notebook server by default. Shouldn't that change, too? And print some sort of deprecation warning? I don't even see a way directly from the app to start a Jupyter server.

Does the script decide which tickets to merge? I thought that was still done by a human, or am I wrong?

In any case, I added #21267 as dependency, which is not merged yet.

Is there a way to get output to typeset in Jupyter?  I don't know the answer.

Obviously, I get

```
NameError: name 'DATA' is not defined

As to the exporter itself, looks very nice. Thoughts:
*  I suspect it isn't possible to click on the "use Sage notebook" button once one has started converting, correct?  A message to that effect would be nice.
* A message for using the converter that says "your stuff will be saved in the following location" would be good - probably could be gotten on the fly from `pwd`, right?

<a id='comment:63'></a>> kcrisman: what would be needed for you to give positive review to this ticket?


List (modulo merging this ticket and opening new 8.0 blockers for these):

* Some kind of batch conversion option (perhaps as Volker suggests), including detailed instructions as to exactly where they end up.  Opening a dialog as to where to save them would be really by far the best.  Here's why: any user who has not used the command line except to start the notebook (in particular, Mac app users) will be completely lost trying to find them if they are sent to the `pwd`.  In the Mac app that is in the midst of the bundle.
* Probably more wording on the export main page about exactly what it's doing, where things end up.  That wouldn't be too hard to get feedback on once one sends a beta out for testing.  Maybe that would include instructions on what to do to start a new notebook in Jupyter, how to get "text cells", typesetting as in the recent sage-devel post, etc.
* Testing whether this works properly with Mac app bundle at startup etc.  I have no idea how this interfaces with it (haven't had time to test that), but if we send 8.0 and basically drop GUI Mac support, that is really bad marketing.
* I would say that supporting remaining interact stuff (beyond what Jeroen has already fixed) would not be blocker, except that I think that Jupyter would be the only interface not supporting the layout parameter - is that correct?

A lot of this will be revealed in heavy testing.  We should definitely recruit *non*-Jupyter users to test this out.  Don't skimp!

I don't think all that should be on the export page. "more wording on the export main page about exactly what it's doing" sounds like a good idea, but explaining everything about Jupyter notebooks not.

Yup; better link to a good existing notebook tutorial rather than duplicating one there. One option would be to link to [existing thematic tutorial](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/thematic_tutorials/tutorial-notebook-and-help-long.html) after having updated it w.r.t. the Jupyter notebook.

With Sébastien, we will be running this tutorial at the upcoming Sage Days in Montréal at the end of April; this would be a good occasion to beta test it (and work on it beforehand).

Well, to be honest, none of this can be done easily in Jupyter:

Indeed. That's why we need a round of beta test to see in practice
what's the best way to present a tutorial with similar aims but using
the Jupyter notebook.
