We should remove the default `random_element`, which just raises a `NotImplementedError` to allow for the `random_element` from the category to be used. In particular, finite groups should be able to get a random element:

```
sage: W = CoxeterGroup(['D',4])
sage: W.random_element()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NotImplementedError                       Traceback (most recent call last)
...
NotImplementedError: 
```
