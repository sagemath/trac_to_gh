The **Symbolic computation software composability protocol** (SCSCP) is a
generic open protocol for communication between math software systems.

- Home page:
  http://www.openmath.org/standard/scscp/

- Specification:
  https://github.com/OpenMath/scscp/tree/master/revisions

- C/C++ library interface **libscscp**:
  https://www.imcce.fr/trip/scscp/

- Python package py-scscp:
  - on PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/scscp/  
  - on GitHub: https://github.com/OpenMath/py-scscp

To use in Sage:

```
sage --pip install scscp
```

See also:
- #19970 "Provide an OpenMath interface".

  Both tickets would improve interoperability of SageMath
  and other mathematics software (both ways: accessing other
  software from Sage, and accessing Sage from other software).

It contains a command-line synchronous client, base classes to implement a server, and a (pure-python) demo server exposing a very limited content dictionary.

At this point, client support for SCSCP can be considered done for Sage (modulo bugs). We may have to decide whether to make an spkg or not, but `sage -pip scscp` is probably good enough.

True server support requires #19970, and this is a long way coming.
