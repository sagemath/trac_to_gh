I read the modifications and have the following comments.
1. `arf.pxd`: You define `arf_rnd_t` as an enum and rely on the fact that the numeric values of `ARF_RND_DOWN` etc. will never change in the C header files. However, there, the values are macros, so I do not know whether we can safely assume the values never to change.
2. `polynomial_element.pyx`:
  	- I am very surprised to see this change here in an arb ticket.
  	- The documentation of `is_gen` states: "Important - this function doesn’t return True if self equals the generator; it returns True if self is the generator." I.e., the outcome differs from the old behaviour.
3. `power_series_ring_element.pyx`: I am surprised to see this change here in an arb ticket, but I guess that it will not do any harm.
4. `RealBall.__hash__`: I do not like the fact that the fractional part of the midpoint is ignored completely:

```
sage: hash(RBF(3/4))
1048577
sage: hash(RBF(5/8))
1048577
sage: hash(RBF(7/8))
1048577
```
5. `RealBall.upper`, `RealBall.lower`, `RealBall.endpoints`: missing INPUT: and OUTPUT: sections, document and test parameter `rnd`
6. `RealBall.add_error`: missing INPUT: and OUTPUT: sections
7. `RealBall.is_nonzero`: The note section is hard to understand because `__nonzero__` and `is_zero` should do very different things.
8. `RealBall.__lshift__`, `RealBall.__rshift__`: why is the first parameter called `val` instead of `self` and how can it happen that it is not a `RealBall` if this is a method of `RealBall`?
9. `ComplexBall._is_atomic`: `self.is_real() or self.imag().is_zero()` seems to be redundant. Do you want to say `self.real().is_zero()` instead?
10. `ComplexBall.add_error`: missing INPUT: and OUTPUT: sections
21. `ComplexBall.is_nonzero`: The note section is hard to understand because `__nonzero__` and `is_zero` should do very different things.
32. `ComplexBall.__lshift__`, `ComplexBall.__rshift__`: why is the first parameter called `val` instead of `self` and how can it happen that it is not a `ComplexBall` if this is a method of `ComplexBall`?

I am having a quick look though this branch, mostly to check for technicalities. It's a lot, so I'm not saying that you really must fix all these for positive_review.

1. The naming of the files is inconsistent: why `real_arb` and `complex_ball_acb`?

2. You can remove the `include_dirs=[SAGE_INC + '/flint'])` from `src/module_list.py`.

3. Ideally, the type declarations in the arb `.pxd` files should be in a different file: try to follow the model of `src/sage/libs/gmp` for example. Then you should add `# distutils: libraries = arb` to the files with library functions (i.e. not types).

4. The `__hash__` for `RBF` is bad:

```
sage: from sage.rings.real_arb import RBF
sage: hash(RBF(0.6))
1048577
sage: hash(RBF(0.7))
1048577
sage: hash(RBF(0.8))
1048577
sage: hash(RBF(0.9))
1048577
```

5. For `CBF.__hash__`, what's the point of `>> 7`?

6. This is a very strange way to handle exceptions, what's wrong with `raise`?

```
        if arf_get_mpfr(rad.value, tmp, GMP_RNDN):
            abort()
```

7. Replace the `GMP_RND` macros by `MPFR_RND`.

8. You can replace

```
cdef extern from "math.h":
    long lrint(double)
```
by `from libc.math cimport lrint` (although I would prefer to not use it in the hash).

9. What's with this comment?

```
                # FIXME: RBF is not even associative, but CompletionFunctor
                # only works with rings, and other coercion features require
                # methods like is_integral_domain() to be defined
                category=category or sage.categories.fields.Fields().Infinite())
```
Your class models a mathematical field (real or complex numbers), so I don't see the problem. How would you want to fix this?

10. Now that all this is standard, can you add `RBF`, `RealBallField`, `CBF` and `ComplexBallField` to the global namespace and then remove all doctest lines of the form `from sage.rings.real_arb import RBF`.

21. You should really avoid this: `include "sage/ext/python.pxi"`, just `cimport` what you need.

32. What's the difference between `contains_exact` and `__contains__`? I don't understand why you need both these methods.

43. When raising exceptions, add a string: don't just `raise TypeError`, but `raise TypeError("useful message here")`

54. You write `.. SEEALSO:: :meth:`abs` but there is no such method.

65. I still don't understand why `below_abs` and `above_abs` return a ball instead of a real number. At the very least, this should be documentated in an `OUTPUT:` block in those methods.

76. This is confusing documentation: `Return the right endpoint of this ball, viewed as an interval.` I would read it like this method returns an interval. Why not `Return the right endpoint of this ball.`?

87. I don't understand the purpose of this comment: `# TODO: once CBF is there, also wrap functions that only exist in acb*`

I tend to consider that what matters is commits, not tickets. So I don't have any problem with that as long as it doesn't make the review harder, and I actually feel if it makes reviews easier... But please tell me if you don't like that and I will try to create separate tickets in the future.

Good catch! I'd say it is okay, because the operation that really should be fast IMO is `x^n` where `x = Pol.gen()`, not `(2*x - x)^n`, and the new version seems to be about 10% faster when `n == 2`. But I'm open to suggestions.

Yes, I don't know what I was doing with that hash!

The problem here is that, unlike elements of `RealIntervalField(p)`, elements of `RealBallField(p)` may have endpoints that are not be representable on `p` bits. I wasn't sure what to do in this case, so I implemented a quick wrapper for the interval version and then forgot to come back to it. (This is also the reason for the clumsy formulation “viewed as an interval” Jeroen asks about.)

The main options I see are:
- either to return the endpoints rounded (in which direction? we can't be 100% compatible with interval fields!) to the parent's precision,
- or return the exact endpoints, but then, the output parent will be hard to predict.

Which do you think is best?

> 6. `RealBall.add_error`: missing INPUT: and OUTPUT: sections


What would you suggest to say there?

> 7. `RealBall.is_nonzero`: The note section is hard to understand because `__nonzero__` and `is_zero` should do very different things.


I'm not sure I understand your comment. As far as I understand (but all this stuff is very badly documented!), in the rest of Sage, `__nonzero__()` means “syntactically nonzero” (for example, the `degree()` methods of polynomials look for the leading `__nonzero__` term), which for balls is exactly the negation of `is_zero()`.

> 8. `RealBall.__lshift__`, `RealBall.__rshift__`: why is the first parameter called `val` instead of `self` and how can it happen that it is not a `RealBall` if this is a method of `RealBall`?


That's how special methods work in Cython... See http://docs.cython.org/src/userguide/special_methods.html#arithmetic-methods

> 9. `ComplexBall._is_atomic`: `self.is_real() or self.imag().is_zero()` seems to be redundant. Do you want to say `self.real().is_zero()` instead?


I think so, yes, thanks! But actually I don't understand what `_is_atomic()` *really* should do: for example, the documentation seems to suggest that `-2` should not be atomic (since `x + -2` is not correct), while it is atomic in various standard rings, and I think it has to in order to avoid redundant parentheses...

Hello Jeroen,

Thank you very much for your remarks.

Replying to [jdemeyer](#comment%3A15):

Well, people seem to disagree about the meaning of categories in Sage, and some people apparently assume that a parent that belongs to the category of fields will satisfy the axioms of fields, not just vaguely model a field. This is particularly harmful in the context of interval arithmetic.

In the long term, I'd want to fix this by (i) clarifying the “global conventions” that need to be used consistently across the whole sage codebase and (ii) depending on the outcome, perhaps creating categories for “inexact fields” and the like.

Why: because I often compute upper or lower bounds on quantities represented by balls and then do arithmetic operations on the bounds that may result in rounding errors. Representing the bounds themselves as thin intervals is pretty convenient then. I also find that choice more consistent with the rest of the interface of real/complex balls...

Indeed! See my answer to Clemens above.

There are special functions in arb that are only implemented for complex arguments, but that would make sense on sage real balls.

> 18. I don't understand what this means: `Return a copy of this ball rounded to the precision of the parent.`


An arb ball has no intrinsic precision, and (more or less because of that), an element of `RealBallField(p)` can have a midpoint that doesn't fit on `p` bits. The `round()` method rounds such elements to the precision of their parent.

I agree, there is no issue here. Cython doesn't care about the values.

I would go for: rounding endpoints in the obvious direction (i.e. up for the upper endpoint and down for the lower endpoint)

Yes, put the type declarations all in `types.pxd`.

You can use `sig_error()` for that, it just calls `abort()` but it's more explicit.

But that's not at all specific to `arb` right, so I'm just confused by this comment. I propose to remove it.

Why not?

Now I'm even more confused... I still have no clue what you mean.

Because it doesn't make any sense to me to import tons of specialized stuff on startup. It is so much better to import the things you use in your personal `init.sage`... (And `sage -min`, which would mitigate the problem, hasn't worked for years afaik.)

It causes too much confusion for example with the `round()` function. It's also too different from all other places in Sage which handle precision.

In particular, the first issue is a property of arb, see its documentation. Therefore, working around that might have involved that we make copies ourselves.

What is now the status of this ticket? Is it still `needs_work`, in particular after Jeroens remark earlier today?

I do not understand what you mean.

[Arb's documentation](http://fredrikj.net/arb/issues.html#aliasing) says that "An important caveat applies to aliasing of input variables. Identical pointers are understood to give permission for algebraic simplification."

The [documentation of the real_arb class](https://www.math.aau.at/user/cheuberg/sage/doc/6.10.beta3/en/reference/rings_numerical/sage/rings/real_arb.html#comparison) has a "Warning" box stating  "Identical RealBall objects are understood to give permission for algebraic simplification. This assumption is made to improve performance."

It makes reviewing harder as I do not really want to interfere with the polynomials guys ...

current behaviour is fine for me.

I'd like to know what `ampl` shall be (any rational number? ball?) and that I'd prefer to state that 
OUTPUT:

A complex ball.

(the description seems to be worded as an inline operation, but it actually returns a new ball).

As far as I understand (but all this stuff is very badly documented!), in the rest of Sage, `__nonzero__()` means “syntactically nonzero” (for example, the `degree()` methods of polynomials look for the leading `__nonzero__` term), which for balls is exactly the negation of `is_zero()`.


I'd prefer something which separates the two messages of the one sentence, e.g. "Use `__nonzero__()` to check that a ball is not exactly the zero ball (for instance, to determine the “degree” of a polynomial with ball coefficients). In fact, `__nonzero__()` is the negation of `is_zero()`, whereas `is_nonzero()` only returns `True` if `0` is known not to be in the ball."


Further remark:

19. The AUTHORS section at the beginning of the files is not accurate: I started those files, but most of their contents has been written by you. So please either add your name or remove mine.

I would not mind having `RBF`, `CBF`, `RealBallField` and `ComplexBallField` in the global name space; this is how most of sage seems to work. But this could also happen in another ticket ...

Done.

> I'd prefer something which separates the two messages of the one sentence, e.g. "Use `__nonzero__()` to check that a ball is not exactly the zero ball (for instance, to determine the “degree” of a polynomial with ball coefficients). In fact, `__nonzero__()` is the negation of `is_zero()`, whereas `is_nonzero()` only returns `True` if `0` is known not to be in the ball."


Done.

I'll be consistent with what I said on sage-devel a few weeks ago and simply remove the AUTHORS block :-). But of course please feel free to add us both back if you prefer.

Done — I still don't like that very much, but since everyone seems to agree...

Is there a particular reason for not using `lazy_import`?

Apart from that question, all my concerns have been dealt with and as far as I can see, Jeroen's comments are also all taken into account.

I think that #19568 is not too related to the changes in this ticket (`RealBallField` was never marked as experimental, as that decorator did not yet exist when it was introduced).

Therefore, I intend to set this ticket to positive as soon as the question about lazy imports is settled.

It's not related but it would be nice to fix #19568 before too many people start using `RBF`.

Yes:  I'm not sure that the modules are expensive enough to be worth importing with `lazy_import`, and it causes doctest failures that I didn't have the time or motivation to investigate...

So the patchbot could reproduce the problem (and in the meantime, I could also reproduce it). Thus I reset the branch to the earlier commit.

The commit with the lazy import is still available as branch `u/cheuberg/19152-arb-misc-lazy-import` if somebody wants to debug this.

My intention now is to set this ticket to positive review as it is in the next few days unless somebody objects.
