These two should yield the same result:

```
sage: a = RIF(-1, 1)
sage: (a ** 2).endpoints()
(0.000000000000000, 1.00000000000000)
```

```
sage: a = RIF(-1, 1)
sage: (CIF(a) ** 2).real().endpoints()
(-1.00000000000000, 1.00000000000000)
```

> excepted compliance with `generic_power_c`

Yes exactly, that's the reason. I just used what `generic_power_c` used. For this application, actually `fmpz_t` (from FLINT) might even be better, since that's optimized better for small values.

> - Shouldn't the `pari_gen` be cimported?

Probably.

> - In each loop you are creating a new `ComplexFieldElement` (with `z2 = z._new()`)... while the same `z2` can be reused! Of course, it will be slower for very small powers.

Right, I'll think about it.
