```
With the infrastructure of #19101, we can make it such that

```
sage -i pyopenssl
```
actually runs `pip`.

All the following optional packages need to be removed from the server as they are now supported by the above command:
- beautifulsoup
- biopython
- brian
- guppy
- mercurial
- mpi4py
- nibabel
- pybtex
- pyflakes
- pyopenssl
- sqlalchemy
- trac

follow-up: #19213, #19220

Hi Jeroen,,

Do you consider your solution as temporary? I am afraid that it would become an open door to have thousands of packages in `piprules`. Shouldn't we reorient users toward `sage -pip install X`?

which is problem because...? Besides, we didn't have "thousands" of optional/experimental packages before, so I don't see why this would suddenly become thousands now.

> Shouldn't we reorient users toward `sage -pip install X`?

I don't think so, because how is the user supposed to know if he should use `sage -i PKG` or `sage --pip install PKG`? With my patch here, the user just needs to know `sage -i PKG`.

I just tested all the list of packages provied in [comment:5](#comment%3A5) and everything worked fine.

Replying to [jdemeyer](#comment%3A13):
> Replying to [vdelecroix](#comment%3A10):
> > Do you consider your solution as temporary?

> No.

Then it should be complient with `sage --optional` which lists the packages. Right now (after installing all the packages supported) I got:

```
$ sage --optional
beautifulsoup........................... 3.2.1 (not_installed)
biopython............................... 1.61 (not_installed)
brian................................... 1.4.1.p0 (not_installed)
mpi4py.................................. 1.2.2 (not_installed)
trac.................................... 0.11.5.p0 (not_installed)
etc
```

And also with `sage -t` that uses optional packages.

```
$ sage -t whatever
...
Using --optional=cbc,mpir,python2,sage,scons
...
```

> > I am afraid that it would become an open door to have thousands of packages in `piprules`.

> which is problem because...? Besides, we didn't have "thousands" of optional/experimental packages before, so I don't see why this would suddenly become thousands now.

Because it becomes now very easy. But you might be right.

> > Shouldn't we reorient users toward `sage -pip install X`?

> I don't think so, because how is the user supposed to know if he should use `sage -i PKG` or `sage --pip install PKG`? With my patch here, the user just needs to know `sage -i PKG`.

No. And as Karl-Dieter said it would be good to add tests for them `# optional - biopython`.

You should consider upgrading via the 'pip install --upgrade pip' command.

An alternate version could introduce a new package type ("pip"?), with one directory for each of these packages, just containing `type` and `SPKG.txt`.

You need to omit it since `pip list` does list `BeautifulSoup` and our package name is `beautifulsoup` (unless you grep without case sensitivity).

Whats the point of whitelisting only specific packages? Including *trac*, which has no mathematical relevance nor any utility to non-developers (and for those only barely). Having special entries in the Sage package list only makes sense if there is a need for it, e.g. because they are dependencies of non-pip (optional) packages.

IMHO if the user runs `sage -f packagename` and `packagename` is not a Sage package then either
* always try to `pip install packagename`, or 
* finish with `pip search packagename` and, if it finds something, tell the user that it can be installed via `sage --pip`

We can merge the current to appease the cargo cultists and finally get rid of some of the broken packages, but its not entirely satisfactory.
