Apologies. Probably my develop branch is messed up, and messing up anything on top of it. Anyhow, I did not overwrite anything this time.

Hmmmmm... Everything in "generators/" is usually exposed in `graphs.<tab>`, and in this case I am not sure that we want that.

To me having this stuff in this file means that it is not very important of its own. What about only reorganizing the file by moving all the graph constructors at the end of it? It does not bother me much personally.
