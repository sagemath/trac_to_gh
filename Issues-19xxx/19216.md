I pushed back my original branch, on top of which I cherry-picked (git terminology) what I believe to be the only two commits that you added that are related to this branch. I also updated their message so that it contains the ticket number (please do this in the future).

I did not overwrite `public/19216` but pushed everything to `u/ncohen/19216`, you can thus find your old branch if you need it. In the future, however, please ask me whenever you want to see one of my tickets merged with something else, as by doing it yourself you give me much more work.

I agree with your two commits, and I thank you for the improvements and addition. You also told me often to use libgap, and I often forget to. Sorry for that.

Please check that I did not miss any of the commits you wanted to see here, and set the ticket to `positive_review` if you agree with it. Please fill your name in the 'reviewer' field, or Volker will invalidate the ticket.

Apologies. Probably my develop branch is messed up, and messing up anything on top of it. Anyhow, I did not overwrite anything this time.

Hmmmmm... Everything in "generators/" is usually exposed in `graphs.<tab>`, and in this case I am not sure that we want that.

To me having this stuff in this file means that it is not very important of its own. What about only reorganizing the file by moving all the graph constructors at the end of it? It does not bother me much personally.
