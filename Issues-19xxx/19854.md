Daniel: I think that after #18489 there has been several additions and I want to add at least `is_relatively_complemented()`, and so this categorizing makes sense. Basically this "needs_review" asks if you agree on that. 

There are two broken links, but they will work after #19801, which I suppose to be merged.

(Of course this is *not* good even after this because of categories, but...)

Good point. This can be a good test ball for that.

There are two points. First is technical one:

`lattices.py` contains three classes, i.e. (whole) lattice and semilattices. Now, hand-made version contained a table like

```
**Meet and join**

    :meth:`~FiniteMeetSemilattice.meet` | Return the meet of given elements.
    :meth:`~FiniteJoinSemilattice.join` | Return the join of given elements.
```

and this seems to be impossible to do with this.

Second is not so technical. It is possible to have for example

```
:meth:`~FiniteLatticePoset.is_geometric` | Return ``True`` if the lattice is atomic and upper semimodular.
```

in the index and

```
def is_geometric(self):
    """                                                                     
    Return ``True`` if the lattice is geometric, and ``False`` otherwise.   
                                                                                
    A lattice is geometric if it is both atomic and upper semimodular.
```

in the function documentation. I think that hand-made index can be better than automatically generated; and of course it needs more work.

But I am a fan of Nathann's code. I think I could use it at matrices and groups, at least. They are used is basic courses at university, so they should have good documentation page.

There I really don't see the problem in having the same message twice. Setting both to <code>Return \`\`True\`\` if the lattice is atomic and upper semimodular.</code> can't hurt anybody.
