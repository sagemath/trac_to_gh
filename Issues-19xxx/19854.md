This patch modifies index of functions of finite lattices (`lattices.py`) to categorized like finite posets (`posets.py`) already have.

Daniel: I think that after #18489 there has been several additions and I want to add at least `is_relatively_complemented()`, and so this categorizing makes sense. Basically this "needs_review" asks if you agree on that. 

There are two broken links, but they will work after #19801, which I suppose to be merged.

(Of course this is *not* good even after this because of categories, but...)

Good point. This can be a good test ball for that.

(I suppose that this was also implicit "yes", so that ~20 functions is enough to have categorized index.)

There are two points. First is technical one:

`lattices.py` contains three classes, i.e. (whole) lattice and semilattices. Now, hand-made version contained a table like

```
**Meet and join**

    :meth:`~FiniteMeetSemilattice.meet` | Return the meet of given elements.
    :meth:`~FiniteJoinSemilattice.join` | Return the join of given elements.
```

and this seems to be impossible to do with this.

Second is not so technical. It is possible to have for example

```
:meth:`~FiniteLatticePoset.is_geometric` | Return ``True`` if the lattice is atomic and upper semimodular.
```

in the index and

```
def is_geometric(self):
    """                                                                     
    Return ``True`` if the lattice is geometric, and ``False`` otherwise.   
                                                                                
    A lattice is geometric if it is both atomic and upper semimodular.
```

in the function documentation. I think that hand-made index can be better than automatically generated; and of course it needs more work.

But I am a fan of Nathann's code. I think I could use it at matrices and groups, at least. They are used is basic courses at university, so they should have good documentation page.

OK. I return this to needs_review again; in any case it will be better with full and categorized index than with partial uncategorized. #19801 was closed, so I think this can be safely be reviewed without waiting for next beta.

I guess it will make quite a big difference for a student to start using Sage for graph theory or for linear algebra... http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/matrices/index.html vs. http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/graphs/index.html . There should be at least index in the `matrix2.py` -- but the file (or compiled .html) itself is quite hidden.

Yo,

> OK. I return this to needs_review again; in any case it will be better with full and categorized index than with partial uncategorized. #19801 was closed, so I think this can be safely be reviewed without waiting for next beta.

Err... Hmmm, technically you do something weird here: add a link toward a function that is not even defined in the branch.

But well, it is already merged so it probably doesn't matter. Do you compile the doc with '--warn-links' ? It helps a lot when you work on the doc.

There should be at least index in the `matrix2.py` -- but the file (or compiled .html) itself is quite hidden.

An index of functions would *really* make a difference. Seriously `>_<`

No. I have done that before, and then forgotten the option. Thanks. And thanks for review.

I opened #19859 for index of matrix functions.
