The installation of cliquer can fail randomly with:

```
error: /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/install_name_tool: changing install names or rpaths can't be redone for: /Users/vbraun/Code/binary-pkg/source/SageMath/jc4b6yulaujayb9sr94ia88eourzeqip0oidmas391yaj24ng0bmdu/local/lib/libcliquer.dylib (for architecture x86_64) because larger updated load commands do not fit (the program must be relinked, and you may need to use -headerpad or -headerpad_max_install_names)
```
Really the current cliquer has no business being a standard package:
* No build system to speak of

get autotoolized tarball at http://users.ox.ac.uk/~coml0531/sage/cliquer-1.21.tar.gz

* Errors are not caught
  (probably another ticket?)

* A libcliquer.so is installed on Darwin (in addition to libcliquer.dylib)
  (not with the new autotoolized version)

https://github.com/dimpase/autocliquer has the dirty stuff done; one can build shared libs on Linux and OSX and cliquer's own tests pass. I don't know how to properly hook the tests into the autohell (so that `make check` does the right thing), please advice (or submit a pull request :-))

`make check` should run `test/testcases`, reading data from the same directory.

 what the the right Makefile.am magic for them?

Similarly, there are `include/cliquer/test*` files that should not really be installed, they only needed for `make check`

I can't also figure out how to set up the proper version number on the `.so` file. It's again something for `configure.ac` or one of `Makefile.am`.

(thanks Volker!)

I have already used it and make a proper testsuite; tests pass. Now to the version thing, and it will be ready for making its way into Sage.

This is getting silly. I made a sane directory layout to begin with, and created bog-standard Makefile.am and configure.ac

I forwarded you the email I just got from the maintainer. Go figure. I don't think we have this option in the "Report Upstream" menu.
