Similarly to #19822 we implement polynomial evaluation for real ball. Contrarily to the case of mpfr/mfpi it needs some non-trivial modification to `sage/rings/real_arb.pyx` because of loops in import statements.

Depends on #19822

I do not completely understand the end your comment. The code I have written was precisely to avoid any conversion. You can have a look at #19822: there is no type conversion at all (except some `NTL -> FLINT` integer conversions).

I agree that we have two places for the implementation of `IntegerPolynomial.__call__(ArbType)`:

1. in integer polynomials  `__call__` (as in #19822)

2. in arb `_evaluate_polynomial`

I have no strong opinion about what is best. Though I provided a shurtcut `p._eval_mpfr_(x)` which is useful and avoid type checking. This is does not discard using 1. or 2. for the generic call to `__call__`.

We could add some methods to arb to evaluate an fmpz_poly or fmpq_poly for arb or acb input, without conversion overhead.

Using arb's evaluation would definitely be faster at high precision for polynomials with small coefficients, even with conversion overhead, since a faster algorithm than Horner's rule will be used.

That would be much better than doing the implementation in Sage. However, I think that a template approach would be useful here to do all kind of input/output (`NTL`, `gmp`, `fmpz`, `fmpq`, `mpfr`, `mpir`, `arb`, ...). There is an (almost dead) ticket #13358 in that direction.

Right now, my usage is for polynomial of small degree (< 10). Though the template approach would allow different algorithms as well.
