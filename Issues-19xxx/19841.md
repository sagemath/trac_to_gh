Similarly to #19822 we implement polynomial evaluation for real ball. Contrarily to the case of mpfr/mfpi it needs some non-trivial modification to `sage/rings/real_arb.pyx` because of loops in import statements.

I do not completely understand the end your comment. The code I have written was precisely to avoid any conversion. You can have a look at #19822: there is no type conversion at all (except some `NTL -> FLINT` integer conversions).

I agree that we have two places for the implementation of `IntegerPolynomial.__call__(ArbType)`:

1. in integer polynomials  `__call__` (as in #19822)

2. in arb `_evaluate_polynomial`

I have no strong opinion about what is best. Though I provided a shurtcut `p._eval_mpfr_(x)` which is useful and avoid type checking. This is does not discard using 1. or 2. for the generic call to `__call__`.

We could add some methods to arb to evaluate an fmpz_poly or fmpq_poly for arb or acb input, without conversion overhead.

Using arb's evaluation would definitely be faster at high precision for polynomials with small coefficients, even with conversion overhead, since a faster algorithm than Horner's rule will be used.

That would be much better than doing the implementation in Sage. However, I think that a template approach would be useful here to do all kind of input/output (`NTL`, `gmp`, `fmpz`, `fmpq`, `mpfr`, `mpir`, `arb`, ...). There is an (almost dead) ticket #13358 in that direction.

Right now, my usage is for polynomial of small degree (< 10). Though the template approach would allow different algorithms as well.

Yes, I agree that your implementation must be faster. I was thinking in terms of code complexity rather than running time. But if you think the speed difference is worth it, I have no problem with that!

(As for the case of balls, as Fredrik said, arb has code for polynomial evaluation that will likely work better in some cases at least.

The “template approach” you mention looks interesting too.)
