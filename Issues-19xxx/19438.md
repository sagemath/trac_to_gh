```
sage: MS=MatrixSpace(QQ,2)
sage: A=MS([0,1,1,0])
sage: B=MS.identity_matrix()
sage: G = MatrixGroup([A,B])
sage: G
Matrix group over Rational Field with 2 generators (
[0 1]  [1 0]
[1 0], [0 1]
)
sage: P = G.as_permutation_group()
sage: P
Permutation Group with generators [(), (2,3)]
```

One can see that the generators of the permutation group do not correspond to those of the matrix group. They should be given in the very same order.

This is a one-line change.

Should it return the same generators literally? The basic routine doesn't do that:

```
sage: PermutationGroup([[2,3,1],[3,1,2],[2,1,3],[3,2,1],[1,3,2],[2,3,1]])
Permutation Group with generators [(2,3), (1,2), (1,2,3), (1,3,2), (1,3)]
```
It doesn't matter so much how the permutation group is represented, as long as the isomorphism to the permutation group is given. You should probably check if the cost of "canonicalize=false" is acceptable.

Precisely, here canonicalize=True is assumed. Adding canonicalize= False forces it to return the same generators, literally, yes.

I had assumed that canonicalize= False actually *reduced* the time needed for the computation, since it simply does a little less. This is confirmed by

(a) looking at the code for the class PermutationGroup_generic, which has


```
if canonicalize:
            gens = sorted(set(gens))
```

and as far as I can tell, this is the one and only place where the flag is used.

(b) When using GAP directly, if you try


```
G:= Group([(1,2,3), (1,3,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (1,2,3)]);
GeneratorsOfGroup(G);
```

then you get

```
[ (1,2,3), (1,3,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (1,2,3) ]
```

that is, they are kept in the same order *by default.*

> It doesn't matter so much how the permutation group is represented, as long as the isomorphism to the permutation group is given. 


It would be best to just return the isomorphism itself (that is what GAP does), yes. I'm not sure that Sage has anything on group homomorphisms, though.

OK, thanks.

The basic infrastructure for homomorphisms and isomorphisms is there, so it should be fairly straightforward to interface with the gap computations. That's for another ticket, though.
