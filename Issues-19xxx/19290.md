Currently, in MatroidUnion `_rank(X)` can only accept objects `X` that we can take the set difference with another frozenset. There are objects having `frozenset` interface, but cannot be used in taking differences.

The PartitionMatroid can't handle empty partition.

Hi Chao,

It is OK if underscored methods like ._rank are picky about the kind of input they can handle. The idea behind having both .rank() and ._rank() is that .rank() should be convenient to use (by checking the input, possibly reformatting it), and ._rank() as efficient as possible (by assuming the input is of the right form).  

So unless there is no efficiency hit whatsoever, I don't like the idea of adjusting ._rank to accept more varied input.
