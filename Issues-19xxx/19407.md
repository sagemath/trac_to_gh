We currently have the following inconsistency:

```
sage: G = GL(2, GF(3))
sage: H = GL(3, ZZ)
sage: Hom(H, H)
Set of Homomorphisms from General Linear Group of degree 3 over Integer Ring to General Linear Group of degree 3 over Integer Ring

sage: Hom(G, G)
Set of Homomorphisms from General Linear Group of degree 2 over Finite Field of size 3 to General Linear Group of degree 2 over Finite Field of size 3

sage: Hom(G, H)
Set of Morphisms from General Linear Group of degree 2 over Finite Field of size 3 to General Linear Group of degree 3 over Integer Ring in Category of groups

sage: Hom(H, G)
Set of Morphisms from General Linear Group of degree 3 over Integer Ring to General Linear Group of degree 2 over Finite Field of size 3 in Category of groups
```
This is due to the category check done in `MatrixGroup_generic._Hom_` is too restrictive.

<a id='comment:1'></a>I just removed this check altogether and let `Hom` construct the appropriate category and the `is_MatrixGroup` handle making sure we have a (matrix) group.

I also touched up some other aspects of the homset construction for (matrix) groups.
