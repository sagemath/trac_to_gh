Okay, LGTM then.

Could you quickly explain the different between `.pxd` and `.pxi` files then? Or should we just move everything over to `.pxd`? (I'm trying to learn more about Cython and the best practices.)

Cython certainly considers the use of `.pxd` files best practice. Essentially, `.pxi` files are almost deprecated but there are still some specialized use-cases for `.pxi` files.

As one example, Cython upstream recently rejected a patch of me which would add support for `# distutils` declarations in `.pxi` files. I guess they rejected this because they do not want to make `.pxi` files more useful.
