```
L = LatticePoset({1:[]})
L2 = L.product(L)
L3 = L.ordinal_product(L)
type(L) == type(L2), type(L) == type(L3)
```

outputs `(False, True)`.

(Also the docstring needs some polishing, at least oneliner to "Return the cartesian product of the poset with `other`.")

The difference is in the constructions, `product` goes through `FiniteLatticePoset` whereas `ordinal_product` goes through `LatticePoset` (which sets category). So it's a code path problem, not anything with the categories.

IMO, one should implement an `__init__` method for each of `*LatticePoset` classes which handles telling `Poset` which category to use. I'm not so much in favor of these construction functions because they cause problems exactly like this one.

OK. Corrected that.

Should this be part of #18776?

This is now ready for review. I corrected the bug, added the definition of the function and added a test.

Also there is non-relating change that rearranges the functions in the "Other & not yet classified" part of index and changes some phrasing.

Some questions/comments.

- You've not added any tests which check that this is fixed.
- Cartesian should be capitalized.
- Why did you make all of the changes to the table of methods?

Also I'm not going to set a positive review on tickets that change <code>\`\`self\`\`</code> to `this poset` (that's not to say I'm not going to allow a positive review, but it's my somewhat mild form of protest).

Because it is more logical to have for example `comparability_graph()` and `comparability_graph()` together and `promotion()` and `evacuation()` as a pair. All changes are for "uncategorized" functions at the index.

Duh. Can you make a patch to convert all `the poset` and `this poset` to <code>\`\`self\`\`</code>? Maybe a year ago I was pointed to style guide that adviced against `self`. But almost everything is OK for me, as long as it is uniform accross the software.
