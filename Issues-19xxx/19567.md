sage: UCF = UniversalCyclotomicField()
sage: UCF(1)*SR(1)
0
sage: UCF(1)+SR(1)
1
```
Clearly the first one should be 1 in some ring or raise an exception. Similarly the second should be 2 in some ring or raise an exception.

This seems to have been fixed by #19912.

<a id='comment:1'></a>It's an off-by-one error in loop bounds:

```
sage: 1+UCF.4
1 + E(4)
sage: (1+UCF.4)._symbolic_(SR)
I
```
The routine lives in `sage/rings/universal_cyclotomic_field.py` and the range should be `range(k)` rather than `range(1,k)` there.
