Sometimes the way that git keeps tracks of changes doesn't quite work the same way that we think of changing a file, and it's not smart enough to figure out what happened.

In this case, I pulled in your branch to my local version, and got this output

git_trac.git_error.GitError: git returned with non-zero exit code (1) when executing "git merge FETCH_HEAD"
    STDOUT: Auto-merging src/sage/combinat/set_partition_ordered.py
    STDOUT: CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in src/sage/combinat/set_partition_ordered.py
    STDOUT: Auto-merging src/sage/combinat/set_partition.py
    STDOUT: Auto-merging src/sage/combinat/permutation.py
    STDOUT: Auto-merging src/sage/combinat/composition.py
    STDOUT: Auto-merging src/sage/combinat/all.py
    STDOUT: Auto-merging src/doc/en/reference/categories/index.rst
    STDOUT: Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.


That means it had problems figuring out what happened in the file `set_partition_ordered.py`. Then when you go into that file, at some point in the middle there will be a block of text that looks like

```
<<<<<<< HEAD

what was originally in this space
================

what your new branch has in this space

>>>>>>>  
```



In this case, 'what was originally in this space' was just `class OrderedSetPartitions(Parent, UniqueRepresentation):`, which I think was originally a place holder until that code got written. Then your code added some methods before that class was defined, and then defined that class. I think git just got confused because that line wasn't changed or deleted, but moved into the middle of a bunch of other changes.

Anyways, you solve the merge conflict by combining the two sections of code into what you actually want it to be. In this case, I just had to delete the 'what was originally in this space' and the conflict markers.
