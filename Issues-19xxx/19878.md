Volker, what is the policy on rc-phase to new patches? There is a small error (by myself) in the index of functions on `lattices.py`. It is corrected in this patch along with other change.

But no animals will be harm if this is delayd to 7.1.

Replying to [@fchapoton](#comment%3A4):
> Why do you change ('simplify') the code ? What you propose has to run over all the lattice, even after it has already found more join irreducibles than atoms..

I tested with

```
B10 = Posets.BooleanLattice(10)
B10_ = B10.with_bounds()
```

and then timed both

```
[B10.is_atomic() for i in range(1000)].count(True)
[B10_.is_atomic() for i in range(1000)].count(True)
```

For `B10` the time drops from 5,57 second to 0,85 seconds, for `B10_` it raised from 0,78 to 0,85 seconds. But I can revert this back if you want.

(It is not reasonable to think about something like `BooleanLattice(20)`, as just `BooleanLattice(12)` takes 43 seconds to complete.)
