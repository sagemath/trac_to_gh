We just make `CartesianProduct` an alias for `sage.sets.cartesian_product.CartesianProduct` (with some tweak to support the previous behavior which considered the cartesian product as a set of lists).

`sage.combinat.cartesian_product.CartesianProduct` is deprecated.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19192
