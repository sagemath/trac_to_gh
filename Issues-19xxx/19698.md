> its not pretty

Indeed.  I'd rather not use `CXX` for linking *on Darwin* instead, but if we really switch to Singular 4.x **soon** anyway...




After all, I think #18892 caused this trouble, and now you're fixing a broken hack by adding another hack.  And the following does no longer apply (since #18892):

```sh
if [ "$UNAME" = "Darwin" ]; then
    # Singular needs $LD set to "libtool", not "ld" on Darwin.
    # If we unset it, Singular will figure it out correctly.
    unset LD
fi
```

In a lot of case you don't want to use the linker directly and let the compiler do the magic for you. 

Furthermore, if you are going to add `LDFLAGS=-Wl,-rpath=.....` globally you don't want to use `ld` as your linker anywhere. `-Wl,` is a compiler instruction to pass its argument to `ld`. Anywhere `ld` is used directly you'll have to strip `-Wl,` from `LDFLAGS`.

Well, on Linux.

> In a lot of case you don't want to use the linker directly and let the compiler do the magic for you.

Sure, but in this case (previously) libtool did the magic on Darwin, so if you change that, upstream's assumptions do no longer hold and it's not too surprising that such a change broke things elsewhere.

Hopefully we won't have to maintain Singular 3.x much longer.

... which would probably be easier with `-Xlinker` (by just dropping it), since you wouldn't have to replace commas by spaces... ;-)

You can by the way also set `LD_RUN_PATH`, which is used by the linker if no `-rpath` option is given.
