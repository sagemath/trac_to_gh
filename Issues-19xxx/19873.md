update the giac spkg to the current upstream stable version: 1.2.2-37

The tarball built from spkg-src to put in upstream/ can be downloaded at

http://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~frederic.han/xcas/sage/giac-1.2.2.37.tar.gz

Update the giacpy spkg to 0.5.5. The tarball to put in upstream can be downloaded at

http://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~frederic.han/xcas/giacpy/sage/giacpy-0.5.5.tar.gz

This new release of giacpy is just an update of giac keywords + an update of setup.py for #20258. cf https://gitlab.math.univ-paris-diderot.fr/han/giacpy-sage
 
From 1.2.0.x to 1.2.2.x some multithreading was introduced in groebner basis computation over prime fields.

on a Xeon E5520`@`2.27Ghz (2 cpu with 4 cores) I got a groebner basis (from the sage with conversion to sage and 8threads allowed) for cyclic9 over GF(101)
giac 1.2.0: Time: CPU 1328.82 s, Wall: 1328.61 s
giac 1.2.2: Time: CPU 824.29 s, Wall: 326.89 s

<a id='comment:36'></a>All right. I was able to run the doctests after decompressing the archive

```
$ sage -t --long --force-lib exemple.sage giacpy.pyx
Doctesting 2 files.
sage -t --long exemple.sage
    [0 tests, 0.00 s]
sage -t --long giacpy.pyx

This is good enough for this version...


Though

1. you should think about fitting Sage conventions for doctests:

   - `a = b` instead of `a=b` for affectation

   - no semicolon at the end of the statement

2. The way the two packages are organized do not follow the Sage conventions, see [Packaging from the developer manual](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/packaging.html). In particular, it would be good to have a test suite for giac. And to explicit the dependencies of the packages.

I don't understand,

```
env SAGE_CHECK=yes make giac
```
has a long test suite, and build/pkgs/giac and giacpy have both a dependencies file.

http://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/tree/build/pkgs/giac?id=98506d3754ddb14ca4548d644b2ed6b7a2d2a5d7 

http://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/tree/build/pkgs/giacpy?id=98506d3754ddb14ca4548d644b2ed6b7a2d2a5d7

NB: running the giacpy testsuite is not enough for a review because some sage doctests have the # optional - giac or giacpy flag.

```
