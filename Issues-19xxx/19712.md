Reported by Georgi Guninski:

```
sage: graphs.strongly_regular_graph(10,2,1)
<crash>
```

(and more of these).

This is because of a "<whatever>%0" and "<whatever>/0" in the code in several places. Which happened, as it was confusion over the corner cases mu=0 and mu=k.

Well, either we require that the graph AND its complement are connected, or we live with mu=0.

Don't we have mu=0 in 6.9? If yes, we'd need to do deprecation to switch to mu>0...

I'd rather keep mu=0 - the classification of graphs in this case is trivial.

In fact, this is an inconsistency present already before this branch.

Also, note the docs of `is_strongly_regular()` that do not forbig mu=0 (or mu=0 for the complementary graph).

> Looks good to me. I don't like the 'mu=0' much, given that it actually "isn't defined" but well, that's life. Well. What would you think of testing `l == k-1` instead or testing `mu=0`, however? Would do the trick to, and so we wouldn't suppose that the undefined 'mu' must be equal to 0?..


I don't see what do you mean when you say "the undefined 'mu'". Do you mean that it is an optional parameter? But it is uniquely determined by the other parameters, so it's not what I call "undefined"...
