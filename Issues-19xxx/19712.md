Reported by Georgi Guninski:

```
sage: graphs.strongly_regular_graph(10,2,1)
<crash>
```

(and more of these).

This is because of a "<whatever>%0" and "<whatever>/0" in the code in several places. Which happened, as it was confusion over the corner cases mu=0 and mu=k.

Well, either we require that the graph AND its complement are connected, or we live with mu=0.

Don't we have mu=0 in 6.9? If yes, we'd need to do deprecation to switch to mu>0...

I'd rather keep mu=0 - the classification of graphs in this case is trivial.

because of the latter, I always thought that Sage does allow mu=0...
In fact, this is an inconsistency present already before this branch.

Also, note the docs of `is_strongly_regular()` that do not forbig mu=0 (or mu=0 for the complementary graph).

if we allow mu=0 then the disjoint union of m copies of `K_n` is s.r.g.
(and its complement, complete m-partite graph with parts of size n). not only for m=2.
E.g. for m=3, n=5 one gets
(15, 4, 3, 0)
and
(15, 10, 5, 10)

The wikipedia page says that often both are excluded, i.e. both the disjoint complete graphs and the complete bipartite graphs.

Now, my former patch excluded both and you complained about it. Now, you seem to complain that I only exclude one of the two.

Make up your mind.
