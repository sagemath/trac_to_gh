```
On `generic_graph.py` function `canonical_label()` parameter `return_graph`:

- The parameter has no effect when `algorithm='sage'`:

```
sage: G = Graph({10: [20]})
sage: G.canonical_label(algorithm='sage', return_graph=False)
Graph on 2 vertices
sage: G.canonical_label(algorithm='sage', return_graph=True)
Graph on 2 vertices
```

compared to

```
sage: G.canonical_label(algorithm='bliss', return_graph=False)
[(1, 0)]
sage: G.canonical_label(algorithm='bliss', return_graph=True)
Graph on 2 vertices
```

- Docstring is badly formulated. It should say that it returns list of edges of canonically labelled graph.

- Indentation in docstring is wrong.

- (And is it meaningful? Why not return dictionary of vertex relabeling instead of edges?)

Same function has other problem:

- Canonically relabeled graph forgets vertex positioning. This is contrary to `relabel` that remembers them. This can be seen with

```
P = graphs.PetersenGraph()
P1 = graphs.PetersenGraph()
P1.relabel(lambda x: chr(ord('a')+x))
P2 = P1.canonical_label()

P.show()
P1.show()
P2.show()
```

All your remarks seem correct (and easy to fix) but I have no idea what the problem with the bliss package comes from `O_o`

```
G = graphs.PetersenGraph()
G.relabel(lambda x: chr(ord('a')+x))

```

And why it deletes vertex positioning contraty to `relabel`? Try for example

```
G = graphs.PetersenGraph()
G.relabel(lambda x: chr(ord('a')+x))
G.show()
G = G.canonical_label()
G.canonical_label().show()
```

Something like that happened during the last update of bliss, but Jeroen noticed it at the last minute:
[#19483 comment:15](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/19483#comment:15)

> `return_graph` is not converse of `inplace`. I guess. It is badly documented. What is the meaning of it's output?

(assuming that you are talking of 'canonical_label')

`return_graph` tells whether or not you want the actual graph. Somethimes you only need the labelling, and not the whole graph.


 A list of pairs somehow... Try
> 
> ```
> G = graphs.PetersenGraph()
> G.relabel(lambda x: chr(ord('a')+x))
> G.canonical_label(return_graph=False)
> ```

These pairs are the edges of the relabeled graph

```
sage: Graph(G.canonical_label(return_graph=False)) == graphs.PetersenGraph().canonical_label()
True
```

Can't say that I see the point to return this instead of a `Graph` object...

> And why it deletes vertex positioning contraty to `relabel`? Try for example

Probably because the graph is built from the list of edges, instead of being built as a relabelled copy of the original graph. Why do you ask these questions like there is a mystical explanation behind? It's a bug, that's all. It just needs to be fixed.

Getting back to this old ticket... First of all I changed the check for parameters to better understand what happens. Now `algorithm='bliss'` will always raise an error if Bliss is not installed, even when the graph has multiedges and Bliss could not be used anyway.

I think that this should just compute canonical relabeling and call `.relabel()`. That would take care the problem of vertex positions.

It's true that this method needs significant cleaning. 
- The first line of description is not standard and could be `Return a canonical labeling of the vertices of this (di)graph `.
- In the INPUT block, the parameters could be better explained
- an OUTPUT block could be useful as the output depends on the parameters
etc.



one doctest fails because I have bliss installed. So you could do:

```
-            sage: G.canonical_label(edge_labels=True, certificate=True)
-            (Graph on 5 vertices, {0: 4, 1: 3, 2: 0, 3: 1, 4: 2})
+            sage: G.canonical_label(edge_labels=True, certificate=True, algorithm='sage')
+            (Graph on 5 vertices, {0: 4, 1: 3, 2: 0, 3: 1, 4: 2})
+            sage: G.canonical_label(edge_labels=True, certificate=True, algorithm='bliss') # optional - bliss
+            (Graph on 5 vertices, {{0: 4, 1: 3, 2: 1, 3: 0, 4: 2})
```
The last 2 lines might be placed with the examples using bliss.

Currently Bliss have no verbose mode, and the docstring of `search_tree` says "verbosity â currently ignored". Hence I just removed the parameter.

I changed docstring and allowed `return_graph=False` only when `bliss=True` is explicitly said.

Docstring modified.

Now this needs comments.

In `bliss.pyx`:
- `canonical graph of G. Otherwise, it returns its set of edges.` -> <code>canonical graph of \`G\`. Otherwise, it returns its set of edges.</code>

In `generic_graph.py`:
- unfortunately you can not remove parameter `verbosity` like that, although it is `currently ignored`. A deprecation warning is needed.
- In the documentation, you must use <code>\`\`True\`\`, \`\`False\`\`</code>

I don't see any place where the `certificate` parameter is used, but it might be useful to some users, no ?

put the ticket to needs review when ready.

In `bliss.pyx`, you changed some <code>\`\`G\`\`</code> and `G` to <code>\`G\`</code>, but this last form is not well taken into account when building the doc. You must also use `r"""`. You should also do the same in `generic_graph.py`.

In the toc, you added `Return the canonically labeled graph.` but this is different from the sentence in the method. I suggest to use only `Return the canonical graph`.

You don't want to use [canonization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonization) but [canonicalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonicalization), right ? ;)


Some comments on the parameters

```
-        - ``certificate`` -- if ``True``, a dictionary mapping from the
-          (di)graph to its canonical label will be given.
+        - ``certificate`` -- boolean (default: ``False``). When set to ``True``,
+          a dictionary mapping from the vertices of the (di)graph to its canonical
+          label will also be returned.
```

```
-        - ``edge_labels`` -- default ``False``, otherwise allows
-          only permutations respecting edge labels.
+        - ``edge_labels`` -- boolean (default: ``False``). When set to ``True``,
+          allows only permutations respecting edge labels.
```

```
-        - ``algorithm``, a string -- the algorithm to use; currently available:
+        - ``algorithm`` -- a string (default: ``None``). The algorithm to use;
+          currently available:
```

```
-        - ``return_graph`` -- if set, instead of graph return the list of
-          edges of the the canonical graph; only available when Bliss is
-          explicitly set as algorithm
+        - ``return_graph`` -- boolean (default: ``True``). When set to ``False``,
+          returns the list of edges of the the canonical graph instead of the
+          canonical graph; only available when ``'bliss'`` is explicitly set as
+          algorithm.
```

use `bliss` and not `Bliss` to avoid confusion.

`return_graph='false'` -> `return_graph=False`

`graph with multiedges` -> `graph with multiple edges` to be consistent with the names of methods (ok, not with the constructor parameter).


Failing example in `generic_graph.py`:

```
Failed example:
    g
Expected:
    Graph on 6 vertices
Got:
    Grid Graph for [2, 3]: Graph on 6 vertices
```

For parameter `partition`, I tried the following:

```
sage: G = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: C = G.coloring()
sage: C
[[1, 3, 5, 9], [0, 2, 6], [4, 7, 8]]
sage: C[::-1]
[[4, 7, 8], [0, 2, 6], [1, 3, 5, 9]]
sage: A = G.canonical_label(partition=C, algorithm='bliss')
sage: B = G.canonical_label(partition=C[::-1], algorithm='bliss')
sage: A == B
False
sage: B = G.canonical_label(partition=[C[0], C[2], C[1]], algorithm='bliss')
sage: A == B
False
sage: A = G.canonical_label(partition=C, algorithm='bliss')
sage: B = G.canonical_label(partition=[C[0], C[1], C[2][::-1]], algorithm='bliss')
sage: A == B
True
```
By the way, it's boring to type `algorithm='bliss'` when bliss is your default algorithm...

Replying to [@dcoudert](#comment%3A25):

Thanks for comments. I did most of them, but some comments:

> In `bliss.pyx`, you changed some <code>\`\`G\`\`</code> and `G` to <code>\`G\`</code>, but this last form is not well taken into account when building the doc.

This is sometimes hard to decide. I guess we should use <code>\`x\`</code> only when referring to mathematical definition without any connection to the specific function parameters we are documenting.

> In the toc, you added `Return the canonically labeled graph.` but this is different from the sentence in the method. I suggest to use only `Return the canonical graph`.

I changed that.

In general I try to write a one-line description of the function to TOC when possible. For example `is_uniform` is explained as "Return True if all congruences of the lattice consists of equal-sized blocks." in TOC, but the function starts with "Return True if the lattice is uniform - -" and then explains what is uniform.

> You don't want to use [canonization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonization) but [canonicalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonicalization), right ? ;)

But then there is [Graph canonization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_canonization), so what to do?

> For parameter `partition`, I tried the following:

For that we must first define what means to be "canonical" but still "restrict permutations". That's why I suggest postponing that to another ticket.

> By the way, it's boring to type `algorithm='bliss'` when bliss is your default algorithm...

True, but there is no other choise for most examples.

E: I am not sure if the function should keep the graph's name or not. However, now it is consistent with `relabel()`.

For example `is_uniform` is explained as "Return True if all congruences of the lattice consists of equal-sized blocks." in TOC, but the function starts with "Return True if the lattice is uniform - -" and then explains what is uniform.

 
Agreed. A significant effort remains to be done for cleaning the graph module.

You are right. I did not see that. So let's use graph canonization.

Could you add a link to the wikipedia page ?

Agreed. It's already much better

I have no opinion on that.
