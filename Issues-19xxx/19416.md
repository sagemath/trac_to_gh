We implement a generic `is_commutative` test for finite-dimensional algebras with a basis and a `cardinality` for modules with a basis.

I would prefer if the docstring for `is_commutative` said "Return *whether* self is a commutative algebra" (or "Return whether this algebra is a commutative algebra").

Is it worth saving any time by removing `self.one()` from the basis before doing the iteration? With the following change:
