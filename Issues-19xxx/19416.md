I would prefer if the docstring for `is_commutative` said "Return *whether* self is a commutative algebra" (or "Return whether this algebra is a commutative algebra").

Is it worth saving any time by removing `self.one()` from the basis before doing the iteration? With the following change:

The only possible issue I see is that not all algebras in Sage have `one` as a basis element, so for those algebras, by adding this extra `remove` check, it might be longer. However, since the vast majority of algebras in Sage do have `one` as a basis element, and probably it appears early on, this should be faster and I think it is worthwhile to have it.
