So GAP3 has `IsIdentical`, which was changed to `IsIdenticalObj` in GAP4b3. I think what we need to do is either:

- a subclass of the GAP interpreter for backwards compatibility with GAP3 which just has the one difference in `function_call()`,
- check the GAP version in the `__init__` and set some private attribute which gets used in `function_call()`, or
- store the GAP version as an attribute and use an `if` statement in `function_call()`.

@anneschilling For now you should be able to make that one line change mentioned above to `sage.interfaces.gap.function_call` (but I haven't tested it).

Hi!

> - a subclass of the GAP interpreter for backwards compatibility with GAP3 which just has the one difference in `function_call()`,

There already is a separate class for GAP3 which inherits from `Gap_generic`. The cleanest solution IMO would be to have a method `_identical_function` in `Gap_generic` (parallel to `_equality_symbol` etc.), say:

```python
def _identical_function(self):
    return "IsIdenticalObj"
```
and then have it overridden in `Gap3`.

Good; let us use that.

I think it should be a class-level attribute instead of a method because it speed cost and a method is IMO somewhat overkill (because no work is done).

Anne, can you check to see if this works?
