This will provide a fast uniform (almost) random generator for triangulations.

This uses the algorithm via a bijection with blossoming trees due to Schaeffer and Poulalhon.

<a id='comment:2'></a>Hello,

If you add this then I do not think that we need our former 'randomtriangulation' anymore.

Nathann

P.S.: The difference between `listA += listB` and `listA.extend(listB)` is that the first one creates a copy og `listA` first.

<a id='comment:5'></a>Hello Frédéric,

Yours is clearly better, and unless there is a specific reason why we should
keep the old one (please enlighten me) I do not see the point to have it around.

First, because 'graphs.RandomTriangulation' should preferably be what you
implement now: at least the notion of 'random' is clear (and what one would expect).

If you insist on keeping the other, then perhaps it could be a (non-default)
option of `RandomTriangulation`? Let us not kee code just for the sake of not
throwing anything away. What you did is what `RandomTriangulation` should be. If
it had been like this from the start, we certainly wouldn't have added the other
function later.

> Should I use `.append` and `.extend` everywhere possible ?


Yes, please. Let us not waste ressources when we can easily avoid it.

<a id='comment:10'></a>Hello Frédéric,

I only read the content of `auxiliary_random_word` so far (one cannot say that the construction appears very explicitly in the paper `:-/`) and added a small commit at `public/19520`, mainly to point to where the constraints on the binary word are provided in the paper.

Is there any reason why you add +3n and -n in to 'height', instead of compution '3*number_of_1 - number_of_zeroes' like in Proposition 4.2?

<a id='comment:17'></a>Hello Frédéric,

Here is another (incomplete) review:

- The names of the two functions `contour_and_graph_from_word` and
  `auxiliary_random_word` are not very descriptive of what they do, and this is
  not really a problem since they are not meant to be called directly by the
  user. As they do not appear in the documentation anyway, could you turn them
  into private functions by adding a `_` at the beginning of their name?

  If you do so, please update the sphinx links.

- As a french person I understand why 'f' would denote a leaf, but that probably
  isn't the appropriate letter. Is there actually anything stopping you from
  using 'inner' and 'leaf' instead of 'i' and 'f'?

- As my notion of up/down is apparently the opposite of what the paper use, I
  rearranged the sentences of the doc of `contour_and_graph_from_word` so that
  'away/toward the root' appears before the notion of up/down (which matches the
  paper, as in your original text).

- What do you call 'every inner vertex has two leaves' ? In the sequence
  `[1,0,0,0,0,0]` that you use as an example in the docstring of
  `contour_and_graph_from_word`, the root vertex (that you consider to be an
  'inner' vertex) has exactly one neighbor, which is not a leaf.

- In `contour_and_graph_from_word` the variable `active_vertex` was always equal
  to `inner_stack[-1]`. I removed it. Less variables to keep track of --> easier
  to understand.

- This is a search operation in a list
  {{{
  inner_stack[-1] in leaf_stack:
  }}}
  This is not very efficient. Same for `leaf_stack.remove(x)`, which first looks
  for an occurrence of `x` in `leaf_stack`, then removes it.

  Fortunately none of these operations is necessary, for if there is a leaf to
  add to the current inner vertex it is the last element of `leaf_stack` (which
  also means that all 'search' operations actually read the list completely).

- Where exactly is the algorithm of `RandomTriangulation` to be found in
  [PS2006]_? In the documentation you say that it comes from this paper,
  but... where? `O_o`

The modifications I mention can be found at public/19520.

Thanks,

Nathann

No, no, in the example `1,0,0,0,0,0`, the inner-root does have two leaves.

One must be careful about what is called the root. There is a leaf-root and an inner-root. In the paper, the leaf-root is considered as the "true" root. And so the inner root would have only one leaf.

In the algorithms, it turns out to be more convenient to use the inner-root as "true" root, and to transform the leaf-root to become the rightmost leaf of the inner-root. In this case, the inner root also has two leaves.

This algorithm is my own implementation
of the bijective map described in section 2.1. I am not sure that it is really efficient. I perform the closure moves by successive reductions of the contour word,
until there is no sequence (in,in,in,lf) in the cyclic contour word.

Yepyep. I agree that the code seems consistent with this definition: all internal vertices have two leaves.

At first, I expected that discovering a leaf resulted in two consecutive '0' in the word, as going there (one 0) and going back (one 0) would take two moves. Turns out that 'discovering a leaf' takes only one 0.

This is the reason why I added in the documentation a comment about the expected length of a sequence with respect to its associated tree.

I see. Could you add in the doc some pointers toward the corresponding sections of the paper (e.g. section 2.1) so that it is easier to know while reading the code which part of the paper you were 'translating'?

Thanks,

Where did you see that?

```

sage: m = l
sage: l += [4,5]
sage: m

<a id='comment:33'></a>Hellooo Frédéric,

I am reading the 'main' part of the algorithm, and trying to understand how you find the subsequences of the form 'in,in,in,lf,in'. It seems (I am not sure) that you do this manually. Here is something that you may like:

```
sage: 'abcdefghihijk'.index('def')
3
```

This 'index' function of str also takes an optional argument that means that the search should not start from the first character of the string, but from some later index. Eg

```
sage: 'abcdefghihijk'.index('def',5)
...
ValueError: substring not found
```

If you do what I think you are doing, then you are rewriting this .index function.

Now, you cannot directly use this function, because it is a member of 'str' and not a member of 'list'. And your list is a sequence of pairs. Thus, it could be 'made to work' by creating a 'copy' of your list that only contains the indication of in/lf. Something like that

```
sage: w=[('in',3)]*5+[('lf',4)]+[('in',3)]
sage: s="".join(x[0] for x in w)
sage: s.index('inininlfin')
4
```

With this index you can now do whatever operation on w you need.

This requires a copy of the list into a string, though on the other hand it would make your code much easier to read -- if you actually do what I think you do.

What do you think?

Alternatively, you could 'rewrite' an index function that applies to lists. Something like:

```
sage: def find_pattern(l):
....:     for i in range(len(l)-4):
....:         if 'in' == l[i] == l[i+1] == l[i+2] == l[i+4] and l[i+3] == 'lf':
....:             return i
```

It is not the 'best algorithmic way to compute it', but it would work. Do you think something like that may improve the code?

So, what to do ? 

0) Keep more or less the current algo

1) try to make it clearer, maybe by using `index`

2) try to find an optimal or at least better algo, maybe with stacks

I have no clear opinion, but I would rather avoid doing a lot of work.

<a id='comment:35'></a>Hello Frédéric,

My last comment was written with 'if' everywhere, because I was not sure of what you were doing exactly by looking at the code. Hence, my message was both a request for a confirmation that I understood correctly what you were doing, and a proposal to rewrite the code in a more readable way.

I had totally missed the constraint that those merging operations had to be made cyclically, for instance. And right now, though I have 'some idea' of what you try to do in the code, I still do not understand it.

My proposition was not mainly a proposition to rewrite it more efficiently (and the 'string' of index version does have the 'copy' drawback I mentionned) but to rewrite it more clearly.

Tomorrow I will have a long bus trip, and I can try to rewrite a cyclic merging algorithm using 'index' that will only work on a string, leaving you to fill it with whatever it does at the same time with the graph.

At the moment I do not understand what your code does, and I try to do what I can to understand it and make life easier for whoever next will read it.

Nathann

<a id='comment:36'></a>Hello Frédéric,

I thought about it for a while and ended up with the following design: a function scans for a pattern through a list l and -- if it finds it -- rotates l so that it starts with that pattern.

Here is the code, hoping that it may help rewrite your code a bit more clearly:

```python
def rotate_l_to_next_pattern(pattern):
    global l
    # Find 'pattern' in l, and rotates l so that l starts with 'pattern'.
    n = len(n)
    for i in range(n):
        if all(l[(i+ii)%n] == x for ii,x in enumerate(pattern)):
            l = l[i:] + l[:i]
            return True
    return False

l = [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1]
while rotate_l_to_next_pattern([0,1]):
    l[0] = 2
```

<a id='comment:40'></a>Helloooooo Frédéric,

Thanks, this code is a bit easier to understand (and I almost get what it does)!

I admit that I am still looking with longing at the `rotate_l_to_next_pattern` function I gave in an earlier comment hoping that it could fit, but so far I have a couple of questions left:

1) It seems that you consider the word as a circular word, but I am not convinced that your code would notice the pattern 'in,in,in,lf' if it appeared 'wrapped around' in this way: 'lf,in,in,in,in,in,in'. Is that correct? My previous code was written to handle this situation.

2) I do not understand the purpose of the second condition in `if not stack_in or (x != stack_in[-1]):`. I thought you were only looking for the pattern 'in,in,in,lf' but it seems that some additional constraint has to be added?

Also, could you add a check at the end of your function that the graph you return has the expected number of edges (as it is a planar triangulation)?

Thanks,

You say in a comment that 'in1,in2,in3,lf' gets replaced by 'in1,in3', but your code removes the last two elements of the stack (which should be `in2,in3`). 

Thus, I get the impression that your code replaces 'in1,in2,in3,lf' by 'in1'.
