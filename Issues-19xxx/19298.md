Several packages need C++11:
* pynac (#19312)
* Givaro + Linbox + FFLAS-FFPACK (#17635)
* cryptominisat (#15674)

They need different subsets of C++11. The first full featured C++11 gcc version is 4.8.1. The version shipped with Sage at the moment is 4.9.2. This ticket should implement install/usage of Sage's gcc if the native gcc version is less than 4.8.1. The resp. package tickets will depend on this ticket and activate the C++11 switch in their compile process.
