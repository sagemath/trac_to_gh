```
Steps to reproduce:
* Start `sage --notebook=jupyter`
* In the Jupyter file browser, select New -> Folder
* Click on the newly-created "Untitled Folder" (name does not matter)
* Create a new Sage kernel notebook in this subfolder

Result:
* The "Failed to retrieve MathJax from '../nbextensions/mathjax/MathJax.js" dialog pops up
* Notebook url is `http://localhost:8888/notebooks/Untitled%20Folder/Untitled.ipynb`

Since the notebook folder is in the url path, we cannot use a relative path for mathjax.

I doubt this is fixable without changes to upstream. I'll think about a solution which works in all cases.

Passes testlong (no errors).

I'm tempted to give positive review, but I'd rather have a second opinion with a different use case.
