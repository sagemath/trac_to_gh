Seems to be OK, but there are 24 "dictionnary" left, and one "dictonary". Try

```
egrep -w -o 'd[a-z]+t[a-z]+y' -R src/sage | cut -f 2 -d :  | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
```

Do you want me to just review this, or want to add more corrections into the ticket?

Peter, I read your commit. It is OK. So, if you can read mine, then this is cross-checked and can be marked as positive review.
