The function `sage.schemes.plane_conics.con_field.ProjectiveConic_field.hom(x, Y)` with `x` a matrix and codomain argument `Y` given fails on base fields for which sage does not simplify fractions of multivariate polynomials. It raises a `ValueError` for perfectly valid input.

```

    659             x = Sequence(x*vector(self.ambient_space().gens()))
    660             return self.Hom(Y)(x, check = False)

ValueError: The matrix x (= [1 0 1]

```

Here is the code that raises the `ValueError`. It should test whether q is constant, but instead tests whether its numerator and denominator are constant.

```
                q = Y.defining_polynomial()/im.defining_polynomial()
                if not (q.numerator().is_constant()
                        and q.denominator().is_constant()):
                    raise ValueError("The matrix x (= %s) does not define a " \
                                      "map from self (= %s) to Y (= %s)" % \
                                      (x, self, Y))
```

Here is a less direct example, which shows that consequently `diagonalization()` fails for such base fields.

**Example:**

```python
sage: K = FractionField(PolynomialRing(QQ, 't')); (t,) = K.gens(); C = Conic(K, [1/2,0, 1, 2, 0, 3])
sage: C.diagonalization()

    340         con = Conic(D, names = names)
