The function `sage.schemes.plane_conics.con_field.ProjectiveConic_field.hom(x, Y)` with `x` a matrix and codomain argument `Y` given fails on base fields for which sage does not simplify fractions of multivariate polynomials. It raises a `ValueError` for perfectly valid input.

```
sage: C = Conic(QQ, [1,0,0,1,0,1])
sage: D = Conic(QQ, [1,0,-2,1,0,2])
sage: T = Matrix([[1,0,1],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]])
sage: C.hom(T, D) # works fine over QQ
Scheme morphism:
  From: Projective Conic Curve over Rational Field defined by x^2 + y^2 + z^2
  To:   Projective Conic Curve over Rational Field defined by x^2 + y^2 - 2*x*z + 2*z^2
  Defn: Defined on coordinates by sending (x : y : z) to
        (x + z : y : z)
sage: K = FractionField(PolynomialRing(QQ, 't'))
sage: CK = C.base_extend(K)
sage: DK = D.base_extend(K)
sage: TK = T.base_extend(K)

/Users/marcostreng/sage_builds/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/schemes/plane_conics/con_field.pyc in hom(self, x, Y)
    656                     raise ValueError("The matrix x (= %s) does not define a " \
    657                                       "map from self (= %s) to Y (= %s)" % \
--> 658                                       (x, self, Y))
    659             x = Sequence(x*vector(self.ambient_space().gens()))
    660             return self.Hom(Y)(x, check = False)

ValueError: The matrix x (= [1 0 1]
[0 1 0]
[0 0 1]) does not define a map from self (= Projective Conic Curve over Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in t over Rational Field defined by x^2 + y^2 + z^2) to Y (= Projective Conic Curve over Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in t over Rational Field defined by x^2 + y^2 + (-2)*x*z + 2*z^2)
```

Here is the code that raises the `ValueError`. It should test whether q is constant, but instead tests whether its numerator and denominator are constant.

```
                q = Y.defining_polynomial()/im.defining_polynomial()
                if not (q.numerator().is_constant()
                        and q.denominator().is_constant()):
                    raise ValueError("The matrix x (= %s) does not define a " \
                                      "map from self (= %s) to Y (= %s)" % \
                                      (x, self, Y))
```

Here is a less direct example, which shows that consequently `diagonalization()` fails for such base fields.

**Example:**

```python
sage: K = FractionField(PolynomialRing(QQ, 't')); (t,) = K.gens(); C = Conic(K, [1/2,0, 1, 2, 0, 3])
sage: C.diagonalization()

    340         con = Conic(D, names = names)

-The function `sage.schemes.plane_conics.con_field.ProjectiveConic_field.hom()` with codomain argument `Y` given fails on base fields for which sage doesn't know how to simplify fractions of polynomials. Consequently `diagonalization()` fails for cases that I need to implement #6881.
+The function `sage.schemes.plane_conics.con_field.ProjectiveConic_field.hom(x, Y)` with `x` a matrix and codomain argument `Y` given fails on base fields for which sage does not simplify fractions of multivariate polynomials. It raises a `ValueError` for perfectly valid input.
 
-My current workaround is to, in case of characteristic 0, convert the fraction `q` to a symbolic expression and back. I'm not sure if this is mathematically okay, and this still leaves infinite fields of positive characteristic.

+
+Here is the code that raises the `ValueError`. It should test whether q is constant, but instead tests whether its numerator and denominator are constant.
+
+```
+                q = Y.defining_polynomial()/im.defining_polynomial()
+                if not (q.numerator().is_constant()
+                        and q.denominator().is_constant()):
+                    raise ValueError("The matrix x (= %s) does not define a " \
+                                      "map from self (= %s) to Y (= %s)" % \
+                                      (x, self, Y))
+```
+
+Here is a less direct example, which shows that consequently `diagonalization()` fails for such base fields.
