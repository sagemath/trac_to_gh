Now I finally have something useful to contribute.

The "Lyapunov-like" matrices/transformations provide a way to generalize the complementarity slackness condition over other cones. Essentially you expand `<x,s> = 0` into a system of equations `<L(x),s> = 0` and hope to solve that. The space of all such transformations turns out to be the Lie algebra of the automorphism group of the cone.

And now that we have `discrete_complementarity_set()`, we can find every Lyapunov-like transformation using some basic linear algebra tricks: `<L(x),s> = 0` if and only if `<L, sx^T> = 0` (trace inner product), so all we have to do is compute an orthogonal complement.

The name `LL()` for the space of all Lyapunov-like transformations appears in 5-10 papers, but isn't very descriptive. If you prefer, I like `lyapunov_like_basis` just as much.

> Are these matrices expected to be non-integer? I.e. why base_field and not base_ring?


The tensor products are integer matrices, but when we convert to long vectors, I think a field is required. I assume the `complement()` algorithm needs a field anyway, and the matrices that pop out can be rational:

```
sage: K = Cone([(-5, -1, 0), (53, -2, 1), (-1, -1, 6)])
sage: K.lyapunov_like_basis()
[
[1 0 0]  [       0        1        0]  [        0         0         1]
[0 1 0]  [ 44/4505 681/4505 -126/901]  [  -15/901    75/901   911/901]
[0 0 1], [ -15/901   75/901  911/901], [   87/901  -435/901 -5464/901]
]
```

I could normalize those after the fact?
