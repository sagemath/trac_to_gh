Hello,

Well, it pops out absolutely everywhere because this bug is very very bad, and can generate wrong results absolutely everywhere.

> Another option, would be to move some of the commits from #19016 here (e.g. it would at least avoid the error on polyhedron). At the same time it will decrease the complexity of #19016 which is good. What do you think?


I think that it would make 1000x more sense to create a new ticket entitled "some new hash functions" (or something) and move your commits there rather than here. Splitting #19016 into subtickets does make sense, but I do not see a reason to merge it with this one.

Which you can also flag as 'blocker' if this is what you are after?...

It only leads to possibly wrong results for elements where elements that are considered equal can have different string representations.

This is a very entertaining opinion. I am glad that I do not have to convince you to change it in order to add this stopgap.

I think the consensus was that this is a different issue: equality isn't transitive *across different parents*, and hence "equal => equal hash" cannot hold. However, within a parent we do need to try and keep "==" transitive, and we should try to have "equal => equal hash". In cases where we cannot do this, we should make elements unhashable. Via the "_cache_key" method we can still allow such objects to appear as part of cache keys.

I do think that sage 6.9 could still have this flaw unflagged, but we should really try to fix 6.10 significantly in this respect, and progress has shown this is quite attainable (there probably plenty of other bad hashes around but the "hash(str(self))" catchall is definitely a bad offender)

So I'd say: merge the stopgap right after the 6.9 release to ensure we fix this stuff.

Of course the bug did not appear yesterday, but today we know it exists.

And you don't tell the users? That's irresponsible.

Do you seriously expect them to come here and figure it out?

Or is the whole point of not having a stopgap to *not have them know* and, thus, not worry?

> But I know for a fact that Sage has hundreds (maybe thousands) of bugs.  That doesn't mean that every time you start Sage it should show a big message about that.   


Your code hygiene is a personal taste. All I can say is that this doesn't happen in graphs/, nor in combinat/designs/, nor in the LP code. Seems that we have different expectations.

To impress me you will have to enforce the idea when it takes guts to do so.

It's funny how we have to explain everything in docstrings or users get it wrong, and on the other hand we expect to figure out hash issues by themselves while browsing the developer's manual. Bullshit.

Since you want a review from me: -1

Warnings need to be specific. There are lots of elements that have canonical representations, there hashing it is definitely a bit hacky but perfectly valid. 

There is definitely room for improvement, but it skirts a bit the line of design choice with hashes and coercion.

Attach the stopgap to finitely presented group elements if you want, or fix it in sage-6.10.

You cannot really demand the second part ("fixed in sage-6.10"). Basically, at the end of the 6.10 release cycle, you might easily end up in the same situation as now. So any argument to not add the stopgap now is also a valid argument to not add the stopgap in the next release.

I think the logical conclusion (which Volker seems to agree with) is simply to not add this stopgap and close this ticket as wontfix.

Grow a sense of responsibility. You know what lies ahead? We all get used to return wrong results and do not care anymore.

I think that it really makes no sense to merge this ticket *now*. Either you think that the broken hash is serious enough to merit a stopgap, or you think it's not serious enough. There is really no way that it can be a serious problem in Sage 6.10, but not a serious problem in Sage 6.9.
