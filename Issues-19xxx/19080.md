Janko groups currently need `gap_packages`, and `internet`. We will cure them from internet addiction and reliance on optional stuff, and add few other interesting low-degree permutation representations of them.

The doctests from `sage.graphs.strongly_regular_db` that rely on it and are currently marked as optional will also be updated.
