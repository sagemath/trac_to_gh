<a id='comment:4'></a>I had a first look at this implementation.

1. I am not sure that three different implementations (beta=0, beta in ZZ and beta>0, otherwise) are needed: the only difference is the range over with `k`, `l`, `r` iterate and possibly the growth groups. But the basic coefficients stay the same. Perhaps we should even abolish the function `_sa_coefficients_e_` because collecting for a single `Gamma(alpha)` is not really worthwhile. That would mean removing the parameter `skip_constant_factor` which seems to be less important here.

2. the error term in the case of beta not in NN is not good, it should depend on beta (I very much prefer the strategy for beta in ZZ).

3. summation index `k` should be replaced by `r` in case beta not in ZZ in order to have consistent naming of summation indices.

4. Could you please post values for `compare_with_values` for `alpha=2` and `beta=1/2`? With `precision=10`, I get

at second glance, the error term seems to be fine.

this is settled, much larger values apparently lead to convergence.

done.

done.

This amounts to a major rewrite of the code (old case beta=0 as well as new case). Please review.

What is `n`? Could it be that it is the generator of an asymptotic ring with lower default precision?

I cannot reproduce the problem:

```
result = {}
for p in range(1, 20):
    a = asymptotic_expansions.SingularityAnalysis('n', alpha=0, beta=2, precision=p)
    n = a.parent().gen()
    result[p] = a.subs(n=n-2)
    error = result[p] - result[p].exact_part()
    if p >= 2:
        print p, error, result[p] - result[p-1]
```
yields

```
2 O(n^(-1)) O(n^(-1)*log(n))
3 O(n^(-2)*log(n)^2) O(n^(-1))
4 O(n^(-2)*log(n)) O(n^(-2)*log(n)^2)
5 O(n^(-2)) O(n^(-2)*log(n))
6 O(n^(-3)*log(n)^2) O(n^(-2))
7 O(n^(-3)*log(n)) O(n^(-3)*log(n)^2)
8 O(n^(-3)) O(n^(-3)*log(n))
9 O(n^(-4)*log(n)^2) O(n^(-3))
10 O(n^(-4)*log(n)) O(n^(-4)*log(n)^2)
11 O(n^(-4)) O(n^(-4)*log(n))
12 O(n^(-5)*log(n)^2) O(n^(-4))
13 O(n^(-5)*log(n)) O(n^(-5)*log(n)^2)
14 O(n^(-5)) O(n^(-5)*log(n))
15 O(n^(-6)*log(n)^2) O(n^(-5))
16 O(n^(-6)*log(n)) O(n^(-6)*log(n)^2)
17 O(n^(-6)) O(n^(-6)*log(n))
18 O(n^(-7)*log(n)^2) O(n^(-6))
19 O(n^(-7)*log(n)) O(n^(-7)*log(n)^2)
```
so the result gets better in every iteration. Due to cancellations, some of the coefficients are not present ...

It was an easy option to implement the transfer theorem: `O((1-z)^(-alpha) log(1/(1-z))^beta )` -> `O(n^(alpha-1) log^beta(n))`.

Having this for `precision=0` allows us to reuse the same logic for handling the location of the singularity, for constructing the ring etc. It even does not require us the write any specific code, apart from the one position where we explicitly do not `raise NotImplementedOZero`.

Finally, setting `precision=0` calls for an `O`-term to be returned, so returning the `O`-term which arises naturally seems to be a good option.

In some sense, returning `NotImplementedOZero` at all is perhaps some kind of hack, but the alternative would be to return something like `O(n^(alpha-1-precision))` which does not seem to be that attractive --- and would cause pain later on in #19944.
