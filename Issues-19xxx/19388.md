One of the current doctests on parent.register_embedding doesn't actually do what it should:

```
           sage: x = QQ['x'].0
            sage: t = abs(ZZ.random_element(10^6))
            sage: K = NumberField(x^2 + 2*3*7*11, "a"+str(t))
            sage: a = K.gen()
            sage: K_into_MS = K.hom([a.matrix()])
            sage: K._unset_coercions_used()
            sage: K.register_embedding(K_into_MS)
            sage: L = NumberField(x^2 + 2*3*7*11*19*31, "b"+str(abs(ZZ.random_element(10^6))))
            sage: b = L.gen()
            sage: L_into_MS = L.hom([b.matrix()])
            sage: L._unset_coercions_used()
            sage: L.register_embedding(L_into_MS)
            sage: a * b.matrix()
            [this shouldn't test a registered embedding at all]
```
The problem here is that there is an "action" defined of `K` on `parent(b.matrix())` (namely, scalar multiplication on the base changed matrix) and actions are supposed to be discovered before coercions are, as documented on, e.g. `get_coercion_model().bin_op`. Previously, action discovery failed with an embedding map that produces unhashable elements, so the test above would use the registered embedding due to a covered up unexpected error. So the test only accidentally had anything to do with the registered embedding. With #19016 this is no longer the case. Can we replace this test with something more sensible? (also, note that anything calling `_unset_coercions_used` is a hack).

<a id='comment:1'>Comment 1:</a>
One possible fix:

```
M = MatrixSpace(QQ,2,2)
Kt.<at> = NumberField(x^2+2)
K.<a> = NumberField( at.minpoly(), embedding=at.matrix())
Lt.<bt> = NumberField(x^2+3)
L.<b> = NumberField( bt.minpoly(), embedding=bt.matrix())
M.coerce_map_from(K)(a)*M.coerce_map_from(L)(b)
```
The last should really be spelled `M(a)*M(b)` but that currently doesn't work (coercions should always be valid conversions too, and `M(a)` should try conversion).
