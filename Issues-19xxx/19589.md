AFAICT, `libgmp.so.16` is MPIR 2.7.**0**, whereas -- for whatever reason ;-) -- MPIR 2.7.1 is `libgmp.so.10`*[*`.6.1`*]*.  (The latter may clash with GMP 6.0.0 btw.)

So probably you should follow Jeroen's advise to [first] try a clean build.

In principle, `LIBGMPXX_LT_REVISION` should get fixed as well.

(In 2.7.1, we still end up with `-version-info 8:1 :4`, which leads to `libgmpxx.so.8.0.1`.)

Doesn't really matter for Sage, but if you can send upstream a patch that would be great.

I propose to reissue MPIR-2.7.1 with fixed .so version numbering. 

LIBGMP_LT_CURRENT = 22
LIBGMP_LT_REVISION = 1
LIBGMP_LT_AGE = 6

LIBGMPXX_LT_CURRENT = 12
LIBGMPXX_LT_REVISION = 1
LIBGMPXX_LT_AGE = 4

which (I have checked) leads to 16.6.1 and 8.4.1.

Is this ok with everyone?

To avoid a "downgrade" compared to 2.7.0's mistaken version numbers I guess.

I'd of course prefer fixing those of 2.7.0... B)




While you're at it, some of the confusion presumably arose from the use of periods instead of colons (libtool syntax) in the version table, starting with MPIR 2.1.2 and on:

Nope, but the ordinary (human) reader is tempted to interpret "22.1.6" as the effective library version, as opposed to "22:1:6", which in contrast clearly(?) indicates a libtool CURRENT:REVISION:AGE tuple, the parameter passed to it, which the table is supposed to reflect or document.

Do we really want to remove the test for #19280 in favour of not patching MPIR?

Could we alternatively add a test to the Sage library?

Otherwise positive review (modulo #19610 which needs review/info and the previous failures on ARM I cannot check -- I think the buildbot will try again).

Since the major `.so` version of MPIR 2.7.2 is now the same as that of MPIR 2.7.0, this ticket does not really depend on #19610 (nor #19606) anymore.

I also noticed a minor flaw in `spkg-install` w.r.t. the allegedly empty `CXXFLAGS` used, but it's unrelated (I think) to and IMHO beyond the scope of this ticket.

Because the "major" `.so` version number (and only that) is part of the `soname`, in this case `libgmp.so.16` (for both MPIR 2.7.0, our current version, and MPIR 2.7.2; MPIR 2.7.1 did have `libgmp.so.10`, causing all that trouble -- in conjunction with overlinking *and* missing dependencies).
