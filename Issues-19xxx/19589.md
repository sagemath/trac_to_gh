First thing to try is to check with a clean build (after `make distclean`) to check if it might be a dependency issue.

Second thing to check is a different version of GCC.

AFAICT, `libgmp.so.16` is MPIR 2.7.**0**, whereas -- for whatever reason ;-) -- MPIR 2.7.1 is `libgmp.so.10`*[*`.6.1`*]*.  (The latter may clash with GMP 6.0.0 btw.)

So probably you should follow Jeroen's advise to [first] try a clean build.

I propose to reissue MPIR-2.7.1 with fixed .so version numbering. 

LIBGMP_LT_CURRENT = 22
LIBGMP_LT_REVISION = 1
LIBGMP_LT_AGE = 6

LIBGMPXX_LT_CURRENT = 12
LIBGMPXX_LT_REVISION = 1
LIBGMPXX_LT_AGE = 4

which (I have checked) leads to 16.6.1 and 8.4.1.

Is this ok with everyone?

To avoid a "downgrade" compared to 2.7.0's mistaken version numbers I guess.

I'd of course prefer fixing those of 2.7.0... B)




While you're at it, some of the confusion presumably arose from the use of periods instead of colons (libtool syntax) in the version table, starting with MPIR 2.1.2 and on:

Yeah, fixing 2.7.0 is obviously not possible. It's too widely deployed. It wouldn't fix it for us anyway. We can't even tell where it is picking up the broken GMP/MPIR from.

As for periods vs colons, I'm not sure what you mean. These are comments aren't they? Or are you telling me libtool actually reads the comments?

Another massive facepalm if so.

Nope, but the ordinary (human) reader is tempted to interpret "22.1.6" as the effective library version, as opposed to "22:1:6", which in contrast clearly(?) indicates a libtool CURRENT:REVISION:AGE tuple, the parameter passed to it, which the table is supposed to reflect or document.

Ok, well I fixed this in the `_repo_` by replacing all the dots with assorted punctuation :p.

I'm going to push the fixed 2.7.1 which I had already prepared, to the website now.

Otherwise positive review (modulo #19610 which needs review/info and the previous failures on ARM I cannot check -- I think the buildbot will try again).

Since the major `.so` version of MPIR 2.7.2 is now the same as that of MPIR 2.7.0, this ticket does not really depend on #19610 (nor #19606) anymore.

I also noticed a minor flaw in `spkg-install` w.r.t. the allegedly empty `CXXFLAGS` used, but it's unrelated (I think) to and IMHO beyond the scope of this ticket.

Because the "major" `.so` version number (and only that) is part of the `soname`, in this case `libgmp.so.16` (for both MPIR 2.7.0, our current version, and MPIR 2.7.2; MPIR 2.7.1 did have `libgmp.so.10`, causing all that trouble -- in conjunction with overlinking *and* missing dependencies).
