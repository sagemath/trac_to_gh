In terms of documentation:

* Change the two paragraphs after the first one into `INPUT` and `OUTPUT` blocks ( http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#the-docstring-of-a-function-content ).
* Change the start of the docstring from `"""` to `r"""`. This changes the way the text is read when compiled. Then things enclosed in two graves (like <code>\`\`self\`\`</code>) will show up kind of bolded with a background, and is used to indicate variable names in the code. Things encased in a single set of graves will be read in math-mode. So things like numbers can go in there, and you can also do `'m\times n'`, and it should tex that.

In terms of the code:
* I wouldn't use sparse matrices. Your code goes through defines what the `partial_sum_matrix` and `sign_matrix` is at every single entry, so you're not taking advantage of the structure of sparse matrices. In fact, I picked a random SSYT of shape `[1000,999,998,...,2,1]` with `max_entry=10000`, and using sparse matrices was 4 times slower than not using sparse matrices.
* Add some tests, one or two simple examples to check, one or two checking possible fringe cases (ie, making sure your code can handle things like the empty tableau, if such a thing exists).
* Is m actually a parameter, or is m always the largest entry in the tableau? If it's always going to be the largest entry in the tableau, then it shouldn't be a parameter. But sometimes you want to consider the largest *possible* entry, in which case something like the SSYT `{[[1,1],[2]]`} would be a valid member of the set of SSYT of shape `[2,1]` with largest possible entry 3. In that case, I would change the name of the parameter m to `max_entry`. Make it default to the largest entry appearing in the tableau if the user doesn't specify a parameter.
