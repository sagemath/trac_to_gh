Before #19525, this would instead crash Sage. A crash still happens with COIN (#20360).

This ticket is to actually fix the error completely or give a better error message.

And low-level error message with the PPL and InteractiveLP (#20296 ) backends.

The CVX backend silently adds a new variable that is accessible only to the backend:.

```
sage: sage: default_mip_solver("cvxopt")
sage: sage: p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram()
sage: sage: q = MixedIntegerLinearProgram()
sage: sage: q.add_constraint(p[0] <= 1)
sage: q.number_of_variables()
1
```

While `MIPVariable` objects know which MIP they belong to,
their "components" gotten by `p[0]` etc. are elements of `LinearFunctionsParent(base_ring)`, and do not remember their MIP (nor even their name).
So with the current design it does not seem possible to catch the error of adding constraints to the wrong MIP. 
So unfortunately only lower-level error checking, catching out-of-bounds indices, is possible.

No. It should be always an error, or never an error. If it's only an error "when there's a dimension mismatch between the two problems", that will be more confusing than either extreme.

Then I strongly prefer to always raise an error in this situation. This requires changes to `LinearFunction` (a class that is I think only used in the context of `MixedIntegerLinearProgram`), so that it remembers the MIP that it relates to.

The mapping from MIP variables (and their indexed components) to integer indices (designating backend columns) is determined dynamically, adding a backend column when a MIP variable component is accessed.
Because of this there's simply no good way to write correct code that interchanges MIP variables between two `MixedIntegerLinearProgram`s, or to use `LinearFunction`s directly somehow (without referring to the correct MIP's variables).

> A solution could be to change `LinearFunctionsParent` etc. so that it not only has remembers the `base_ring` but also the MIP.

In contrast the example in the ticket description, no error is raised in the following examples, which is very confusing. 

```
sage: p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram(solver="glpk")                              
sage: q = MixedIntegerLinearProgram(solver="glpk")                              
sage: v = q.new_variable()                                                      
sage: q.add_constraint(v[0] <= 1)
```

and 

```
sage: p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram(solver='InteractiveLP')                     
sage: v = p.new_variable()                                                      
sage: x,y = v[0], v[1]                                                          
sage: pp = MixedIntegerLinearProgram(solver='InteractiveLP')                    
sage: vv = pp.new_variable()                                                    
sage: xx,yy = vv[0], vv[1]                                                      
sage: p.add_constraint(x + y, max = 10)                                         
sage: p.add_constraint(xx + 3*yy, max = 15)                                     
sage: p.set_objective(x + 3*y)                                                  
sage: p.solve()                                                                 
15
sage: p.show()                                                                  
Maximization:
  x1 + 3 x2 

Constraints:
  x1 + x2 <= 10
  x1 + 3 x2 <= 15
Variables:
  x1 = x_0 is a continuous variable (min=-oo, max=+oo)
  x2 = x_1 is a continuous variable (min=-oo, max=+oo)
```

It would be nice to have `LinearFunctionsParent` etc. remember its MIP.
