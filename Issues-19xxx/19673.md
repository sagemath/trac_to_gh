I tried it out on Mac OS X 10.11.3 and it works like a charm.

The Makefile has (almost) not a single comment in it and at least I would find it helpful if it had comments about
- what it is basically for: it is producing a dmg containing the Sage App, to be called directly with make and after sage itself has already been build with make at the root
- the relocability of the resulting App (as far as I understand, the path where we compiled sage needs to be longer than the relocation target?)
- whether the binaries compiled previously by calling make at the root are suitable for distribution to older processors which might not have all the capabilities of the host machine
- maybe a line explaining the $(APP) target
