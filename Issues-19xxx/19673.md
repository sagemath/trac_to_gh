Move the OSX app.dmg build to `src/mac-app/Makefile`

This is a further step to saner binary creation. The makefile is already used in the binary builds, this ticket just documents that fact.

sage-bdist will be deleted when the transition to the new binary packging is done, so no need to beautify it. It still would be nice to use the new mac app Makefile during the transition.

I tried it out on Mac OS X 10.11.3 and it works like a charm.

The Makefile has (almost) not a single comment in it and at least I would find it helpful if it had comments about
- what it is basically for: it is producing a dmg containing the Sage App, to be called directly with make and after sage itself has already been build with make at the root
- the relocability of the resulting App (as far as I understand, the path where we compiled sage needs to be longer than the relocation target?)
- whether the binaries compiled previously by calling make at the root are suitable for distribution to older processors which might not have all the capabilities of the host machine
- maybe a line explaining the $(APP) target
