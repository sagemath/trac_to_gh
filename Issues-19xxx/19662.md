I hate loops,
I hate multiple edges,
I hate edge labels.

A colleague of mine recently reported very slow performances with our graphs, and he was using edge labels. There were.... Let's say "obvious loss of performances" to stay calm.

If you are sensitive to bad algorithms, be warned -- what you will see while reviewing this branch may shock you.

As an illustration. Before

```
sage: %time Graph([(u,v,1) for u,v in combinations(range(200),2)])
CPU times: user 1.82 s, sys: 0 ns, total: 1.82 s
Wall time: 1.83 s
Graph on 200 vertices
```

After

```
sage: %time Graph([(u,v,1) for u,v in combinations(range(200),2)])
CPU times: user 88 ms, sys: 12 ms, total: 100 ms
Wall time: 86.6 ms
Graph on 200 vertices
```
