Hellooooo!

I have implemented max flow/min cut through igraph, which is faster than the old Python-based implmentation of Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. I hope you like it!

Michele

The usual benchmarks:

```
sage: g = graphs.RandomGNM(2000,20000)
sage: for u,v in g.edges(labels=False):
....:     g.set_edge_label(u,v,random())

8.742625820571515
sage: g.flow(0,1,method='FF')
8.742625820571511
sage: g.flow(0,1,method='igraph')
8.742625820571515

sage: %timeit g.flow(0,1, method='FF')
1 loops, best of 3: 256 ms per loop
sage: %timeit g.flow(0,1, method='LP')
1 loops, best of 3: 1.8 s per loop
sage: %timeit g.flow(0,1, method='igraph')
10 loops, best of 3: 66.8 ms per loop

sage: g = digraphs.RandomDirectedGNM(5000,60000)
sage: for u,v in g.edges(labels=False):
    g.set_edge_label(u,v,random())
....:     

sage: g.flow(0,1, method='FF')
4.122947644386753
sage: g.flow(0,1, method='LP')
4.122947644386753
sage: g.flow(0,1, method='igraph')
4.122947644386753

sage: %timeit g.flow(0,1, method='FF')
1 loops, best of 3: 404 ms per loop
sage: %timeit g.flow(0,1, method='LP')
1 loops, best of 3: 2.86 s per loop
sage: %timeit g.flow(0,1, method='igraph')
1 loops, best of 3: 226 ms per loop

sage: g.flow(0,1,use_edge_labels=False, method='FF')
10
sage: g.flow(0,1,use_edge_labels=False, method='LP')
10.0
sage: g.flow(0,1,use_edge_labels=False, method='igraph')
10.0

sage: %timeit g.flow(0,1,use_edge_labels=False, method='FF')
1 loops, best of 3: 324 ms per loop
sage: %timeit g.flow(0,1,use_edge_labels=False, method='LP')
1 loops, best of 3: 2.49 s per loop
sage: %timeit g.flow(0,1,use_edge_labels=False, method='igraph')
10 loops, best of 3: 42.6 ms per loop
```
In conclusion, igraph is always the fastest, and the improvement is maximum when all edges have capacity 1.

Helloooooo Michele,

Thank you very much for those speedups `:-P`

Here are the results of my review:

- They run a max flow algorithm and *silently* ignore the weight if they do not
  understand it? Crazy `O_o`
  `Sometimes, Sage integer/floats are not compatible with igraph::`

  P.S.: I just noticed that we do *exactly* the same: `capacity=lambda x: x if x
  in RR else 1`. This is out of the scope of this ticket, but what would you
  think of getting rid of this 'default' and use 'x' at all times (which would
  raise an exception when the weights are obviously wrong)?

- `"None"`? Or `None`?
  `if method in ["FF", "igraph", "None"]:`

- The code imports 'igraph' even when not necessary, i.e. when `method=None`. I
  tried to figure out how to rewrite it better, but many patterns lead me to
  write the `import/except` block twice, which is a bit unpleasant. Instead of
  importing `igraph` in order to guess if it is available, what would you think
  of using `is_package_installed("python_igraph")`? This way, you do not have to
  define `igraph_available` at all, and you can use the output of
  `is_package_installed` to decide whether method should be set to
  `igraph`. Then, in the `elif (method == 'igraph'):` block, you can actually
  import igraph and raise the exception otherwise. What do you think?

- Is there a reason why you import `floor` from `sage.functions.other` and not
  from `math` (i.e. from python)? Usually 'our' functions can handle symbolics
  and are much slower as a result.

- Instead of differentiating between 'if integer' and 'else' in the igraph code,
  wouldn't it be easier to replace the weight function (in all cases) by
  'floor'?

- It worries me everytime I see a line like 
  `g_igraph = self.igraph_graph(edge_attrs={'capacity':[float(capacity(e[2])) for e in self.edge_iterator()]})`
  I always think: are we even sure that the *right*
  weight will be associated with the *right* edge? `O_o`

- Wow. That's even scarier: 
  ` for e in self.edge_iterator(): f =next(igraph_flow) `
  Could you iterate on the igraph graph's edges instead?
  If the order of edges changes in their data structure, we would output
  gibberish, won't we? `O_o`
  By the way, you may be interested by `zip` and `izip`:

  ```
  sage: a=[1,2,3]
  sage: b=[4,5,6]
  sage: a=iter([1,2,3])
  sage: b=iter([4,5,6])
  sage: from itertools import izip
  sage: for x,y in izip(a,b):
  ....:     print x,y
  1 4
  2 5
  3 6
  ```

- I did not do any profiling so I may be wrong, but I expect that you are making
  your life a bit too difficult, and the code a bit slower, by working with
  those Sage edges. It seems that you "mix" Sage's edge objects with igraph flow
  values in order to build a *labelled* graph while igraph is
  integer-labelled. In particular, in the code which builds the flow graph of an
  undirected graph, you relabel all the edges on the fly. As you use a
  dictionary, this means `2m` dict queries, which can take some time (probably
  negligible compared to everything else, of course). Instead, you could work to
  build an *integer* Sage graph (which would simplify the relabelling) and
  *relabel* it (using the relabel function) once that it is built. Relabelling a
  graph is much faster than doing `2m` dict queries. Theoretically, it only
  needs to query each value once, i.e. `n` queries.

Sorry for being rather absent these days. The "main" excuse is that I am on
vacation (worse, on vacations with people around!), but the truth is that I
spend all the time I have alone trying to build in Sage all strongly regular
graphs promised by Brouwer's database
http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/graphs/srg/srgtab.html. Which requires a *LOT* of
digging work in old books `;-)`

Good luuuck !

I agree: I have replaced that line with capacity=lambda x: x. However, this way, some tests were wrong, because they provided a graph with no edge label, implying that the capacity would be 1 for each edge. To solve this issue, I decided to set `use_edge_labels` to `False` by default (as it is already done in the min-cut algorithm).

I like it! I was also looking for a better solution, but I didn't know the routine `is_package_installed`.

Yes, there is: I didn't know the function floor :-P... Corrected!

Hmmm, could you explain a bit more what you mean? In my opininon, the user should decide whether (s)he wants integer-valued flow or real-valued flow. For instance:

```
sage: g = Graph([(0,1,0.5)])
sage: g.flow(0,1,use_edge_labels=True)
0.5
sage: g.flow(0,1,use_edge_labels=True,integer=True)
0.0
sage: g = Graph([(0,1,0.5),(0,2,1.5),(1,2,1.5)])
sage: g.flow(0,1,use_edge_labels=True)
2.0
sage: g.flow(0,1,use_edge_labels=True,integer=True)
1.0

```

In this case, yes: the edges are added in order, and they are assigned an integer, as "explained" by the igraph tutorial [1]. I tried to stick as much as possible with the examples in the tutorial, but if you have a better idea, please let me know! To me, it seems that this is the standard in igraph.

I have added an attribute 'name' to igraph vertices, and now I iterate on igraph edges, using the attribute when I create the new graph. Do you like it as it is?

Sorry, my sentence was highly confusing. When I said 'in all cases', I meant "for all values of 'method' so that there is no need for this block of code

```
if integer:
    g_igraph = self.igraph_graph(vertex_attrs={'name':self.vertices()}, edge_attrs={'capacity':[int(floor(capacity(e[2]))) for e in self.edge_iterator()]})
else:
    g_igraph = self.igraph_graph(vertex_attrs={'name':self.vertices()}, edge_attrs={'capacity':[float(capacity(e[2])) for e in self.edge_iterator()]})
```

> In this case, yes: the edges are added in order, and they are assigned an integer, as "explained" by the igraph tutorial [1].

Crazy. I don't even want to know how it behaves when you add/remove edges, and the time complexity of it.

> I have added an attribute 'name' to igraph vertices, and now I iterate on igraph edges, using the attribute when I create the new graph. Do you like it as it is?

It is not exactly what I had in mind, but do not worry about that: went the other points will be fixed I will add a commit, and we will either take it if you like it or keep with your code if you do not.

Thanks. I know that it is unpleasant to do, sorry `:-/`

Thanks.

> Great! I will wait for your code, then!

I just pushed a commit at public/19003. It does not do much, but I hope that it simplifies the code "a bit". Don't hesitate to tell me if you do not like it. In theory it should also "do less computations", though it probably cannot be measured.
