When generating the documentation *from the exact same sources*, sometimes links
appear as

```
<a title="(in Sage Reference Manual: Utilities v6.9.beta5)">sage.misc.lazy_import</a>
```
and sometimes as

```
<a title="(in Sage Reference Manual v6.9.beta5)">sage.misc.lazy_import</a>
```
and it's not clear why this happens.
