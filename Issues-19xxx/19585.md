When calling a GAP function, the current code outputs its result twice for each call - first time when the function is called, and once again when checking whether the function actually returned something. Then, when the result is actually needed, it is once again read from the variable storing it.

This ticket removes the first two outputs, thus greatly speeding up the (still slow) GAP interface. The first output is dealt with by `;;`, which suppresses outputting the result, but not any explicitly printed output (which is caught when the function doesn't actually return anything). The second output, which would be printed and compared with the marker, is now stored in an auxiliary variable, which is then compared with the marker using GAP's `IsIdenticalObj` function (which will also give the correct result in the unlikely case when the function returns `"__SAGE_LAST__"`, except in the even more unlikely case when it returns the marker object itself).

The speedup achieved by this fix can be quite dramatic. For example, calling `A.conjugacy_classes_subgroups()` for a permutation group `A` of order 2000 took about 20 seconds on my laptop, but this is now cut down to under 10 seconds (which is still slower than it needs to be, IMO).

This does not appear to be a universal speedup. With branch:

```

sage: %time S = P.conjugacy_classes_subgroups()
CPU times: user 432 ms, sys: 44 ms, total: 476 ms
Wall time: 507 ms

sage: P = groups.matrix.GL(3, 3)
sage: %timeit P.conjugacy_classes_representatives()
1000 loops, best of 3: 1.08 ms per loop

sage: P = groups.permutation.Suzuki(8)
sage: P.cardinality()
29120
sage: %time S = P.conjugacy_classes_subgroups()
CPU times: user 115 ms, sys: 10.3 ms, total: 125 ms
Wall time: 296 ms
```
vs before:

```
sage: P = groups.permutation.Symmetric(7)
sage: %time S = P.conjugacy_classes_subgroups()
CPU times: user 368 ms, sys: 40.4 ms, total: 408 ms

sage: P = groups.matrix.GL(3, 3)
sage: %timeit P.conjugacy_classes_representatives()
1000 loops, best of 3: 1.02 ms per loop

sage: P = groups.permutation.Suzuki(8)
sage: %time S = P.conjugacy_classes_subgroups()
CPU times: user 139 ms, sys: 121 µs, total: 139 ms
Wall time: 264 ms
```
(For these timings, I ran it 10 times and took the best.)

Perhaps this change is asymptotically better. Could you post the group(s) you are using to test this?

I have attached the sparse6 string of a graph the automorphism group of which I was working with. I guess the problem here is that the domain is very large (unlike the cases above), so actually printing and reading the result is what takes most time, rather than the computation itself.

I suspect the reason we are seeing a slowdown in these smaller function calls is because of the extra GAP call:

```python
if self.eval('IsIdenticalObj(__SAGE_VAL__, __SAGE_LAST__)') != 'true':
```
I think we could probably just check if `res` is non-empty:

```python
self.eval('__SAGE_LAST__ := "__SAGE_LAST__";;')
res = self.eval("%s(%s);;"%(function, ",".join([s.name() for s in args]+
                ['%s=%s'%(key,value.name()) for key, value in kwds.items()])))
if not res: # No printing was done
    if self.eval('IsIdenticalObj(last, __SAGE_LAST__)') != 'true':
        return self.new('last2')
else:
    if res.strip():
        from sage.interfaces.expect import AsciiArtString
        return AsciiArtString(res)
```

By the way, apart from the result the last call, `last`, GAP stores results of two previous calls, in `last2` and in `last3`.
It looks like using these might avoid doing an extra GAP call...

Here is the above tweak (which I did some editing to) that has about a %1 slowdown of the current Sage version but doesn't do the extra printing.

Is `IsIdenticalObject` really that expensive in GAP? It seems like it would be the equivalent of `is`, and so it should be fast...

I have removed the check for empty output. Since most functions we call will return a value and not print anything, there is actually one check less in these cases.

As far as `IsIdenticalObj` is concerned, it surprises me too that it should not be cheap. I don't suppose that `=` is actually cheaper?

Actually, what we could do is cut the number of times `eval` is called, by simply running the three GAP commands in one `eval`. I'll try that, and if there is any speedup from doing that, I'll push the change to this ticket.

This is the current behavior in Sage, so it's not really a problem. However, with our current approach, we could print out any non-trivial print statements along with functions that print and give outputs.

Although I think we do need 2 function calls, where the second one is the current call to `IsIdenticalObject`.

Hi!

I've tried a few alternatives. First of all, for reference, the timings on my laptop with the develop branch (i.e., 6.10.beta4):

```
sage: P = groups.permutation.Symmetric(7)
sage: %time S = P.conjugacy_classes_subgroups()
CPU times: user 944 ms, sys: 64 ms, total: 1.01 s
Wall time: 1.33 s

sage: P = groups.matrix.GL(3, 3)
sage: %timeit P.conjugacy_classes_representatives()
100 loops, best of 3: 3.26 ms per loop

sage: P = groups.permutation.Suzuki(8)
sage: %time S = P.conjugacy_classes_subgroups()
CPU times: user 300 ms, sys: 40 ms, total: 340 ms
Wall time: 421 ms
```

With the current branch, there is a small slowdown when there wasn't much output to cut, as expected:

```
sage: P = groups.permutation.Symmetric(7)
sage: %time S = P.conjugacy_classes_subgroups()
CPU times: user 1.08 s, sys: 120 ms, total: 1.2 s
Wall time: 1.42 s

sage: P = groups.matrix.GL(3, 3)
sage: %timeit P.conjugacy_classes_representatives()
100 loops, best of 3: 3.31 ms per loop

sage: P = groups.permutation.Suzuki(8)
sage: %time S = P.conjugacy_classes_subgroups()
CPU times: user 220 ms, sys: 40 ms, total: 260 ms
Wall time: 343 ms
```

I've tried removing `IsIdenticalObj`:

```python
marker1 = '"__SAGE_LAST1__"'
marker2 = '"__SAGE_LAST2__"'
self.eval('__SAGE_LAST1__ := %s;;' % marker1)
self.eval('__SAGE_LAST2__ := %s;;' % marker2)
res = self.eval("%s(%s);;"%(function, ",".join([s.name() for s in args]+
                ['%s=%s'%(key,value.name()) for key, value in kwds.items()])))
if self.eval('last2') == marker2:
    return self.new('last2')
else:
    ...
```
But it seems that `IsIdenticalObj` isn't that expensive after all:

```
sage: P = groups.permutation.Symmetric(7)
sage: %time S = P.conjugacy_classes_subgroups()
CPU times: user 1.08 s, sys: 132 ms, total: 1.22 s
Wall time: 1.5 s

sage: P = groups.matrix.GL(3, 3)
sage: %timeit P.conjugacy_classes_representatives()
100 loops, best of 3: 3.27 ms per loop

sage: P = groups.permutation.Suzuki(8)
sage: %time S = P.conjugacy_classes_subgroups()
CPU times: user 240 ms, sys: 28 ms, total: 268 ms
Wall time: 371 ms
```

I've also tried making all calls in a single `eval`, but it seems that `last` doesn't work when used in a file. So it will probably be best to keep the latest version with `IsIdenticalObj`.

By combining the two commands, I get a net speedup:

```
sage: P = groups.permutation.Symmetric(7)
sage: %timeit P.conjugacy_classes_subgroups()
1 loops, best of 3: 390 ms per loop
sage: P = groups.permutation.Symmetric(2)
sage: %timeit P.conjugacy_classes_subgroups()
100 loops, best of 3: 7.87 ms per loop
```
vs current `develop`:

```
sage: P = groups.permutation.Symmetric(7)
sage: %timeit P.conjugacy_classes_subgroups()
1 loops, best of 3: 403 ms per loop
sage: P = groups.permutation.Symmetric(2)
sage: %timeit P.conjugacy_classes_subgroups()
100 loops, best of 3: 8.08 ms per loop
```
I think we need to mitigate then number of `eval` calls that get made more so than doing the check in Sage. So if you're happy with my last change, then I'm okay with setting this to positive review.

interestingly, libGAP is quite slow here.

```
sage: %time S = P.conjugacy_classes_subgroups()
CPU times: user 143 ms, sys: 24 ms, total: 167 ms
Wall time: 181 ms
sage: P = libgap.SuzukiGroup(libgap.IsPermGroup,8)
sage: %time S=P.ConjugacyClassesSubgroups()
CPU times: user 220 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 220 ms

I guess there handling of `P` and `S` on the Sage side is not optimal...

Hello again!

OK, I added the check for overlong function calls, and it doesn't seem to affect runnning times. Such calls would probably never happen, but we can simulate one with something like

```python
gap.function_call("ConjugacyClassesSubgroups", sage.interfaces.gap.GapElement(gap, 'SymmetricGroup(2)', name = 'a_variable_with_a_very_very_very_long_name'))
```
Without the latest commit, this would return a wrong result.

I have also experimented with also making the check for identical objects in the same `eval` if the function call was short enough, but this invariably caused slowdowns.

I've added the doctest. However, now doctesting fails on a seemingly unrelated issue:

```
sage -t src/sage/interfaces/gap.py
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/interfaces/gap.py", line 1001, in sage.interfaces.gap.GapElement_generic.bool
Failed example:

Expected:

Got:
    True
**********************************************************************
```
This doesn't happen on the develop branch, and not even with the last commit. It seems that the failure has to do with the overlong variable name being reused:

```python
sage: gap.function_call("ConjugacyClassesSubgroups", sage.interfaces.gap.GapElement(gap, 'SymmetricGroup(2)', name = 'a_variable_with_a_name_so_very_very_very_long_that_even_by_itself_will_make_expect_use_a_file'))
[ ConjugacyClassSubgroups(SymmetricGroup( [ 1 .. 2 ] ),Group( [ () ] )), 
  ConjugacyClassSubgroups(SymmetricGroup( [ 1 .. 2 ] ),SymmetricGroup( [ 1 .. 2 ] )) ]
sage: F = gap('false')
sage: F.bool()
True
sage: F.name()
'a_variable_with_a_name_so_very_very_very_long_that_even_by_itself_will_make_expect_use_a_file'
sage: F = gap('false')
sage: F.bool()
False
sage: F.name()
'$sage1'
```
Will look into it.

While in principle, I think these recent changes are okay, could someone else double-check that we want to do things this way?

As for the current code, I would change:

```diff
-        if isinstance(self._name, six.string_types) and parent._eval_using_file_cutoff and \
-           parent._eval_using_file_cutoff < len(self._name):
-            self._get_using_file = True
+        self._get_using_file = (isinstance(self._name, six.string_types)
+                                and parent._eval_using_file_cutoff
+                                and parent._eval_using_file_cutoff < len(self._name))
```
so we don't have to do a `try/except` block:

```diff
         if use_file is None:
-            try:
-                use_file = self._get_using_file
-            except AttributeError:
-                use_file = False
+            use_file = self._get_using_file

I agree with the change.

By the way, earlier in `Expect.__init__`, `_get_using_file` is set if the *value* is too long - I don't see how that helps (except when `is_name == True`, but the new code also covers this case). So we can probably remove that piece of code, too.

On the other hand, this comment

```python
# idea: Joe Wetherell -- try to find out if the output
# is too long and if so get it using file, otherwise
# don't.
```
makes me wonder whether `_get_using_file == True` was meant that fetching the result would be done using a temporary file (rather than using one to communicate the variable name). But of course, a long command may give a very short answer, and the output of a short command may be very long, so this isn't something that can be decided here. Also, the only `get_using_file` methods apart from the new one in `gap.py` are the generic one in `interface.py` (which simply calls `get`), and one in `lie.py` which raises a `NotImplementedError`. So we're probably safe redefining the meaning, if that's what's happening here.

Hello everybody!

It turns out that we still have some issues here.

Firstly, GAP function calls don't actually work when done through a temporary file, nor does getting a variable (which is essentially a `Print` call). The reason for this is that when `_eval_line_using_file` is called, it first looks for a `:=` token - if there is one, all is well; but since we are relying on `last`, we don't have one, and a `Print()` is wrapped around our function call. If the function actually returns a value, this gives an impression of working, since the correct result is printed - but we get an `AsciiArtString` instead of a `GapElement`. When the function does not return a value, the situation is even worse, since printing the result of a function which does not return a result results in an error (which is silently suppressed, and an empty string is returned).

Now, it seems that we can't really solve this problem, since `last` is not updated when commands are read from a file. So I'd suggest this is how we deal with it:
* If the command is short, evaluate it directly (one or two `eval`s, as in the latest commit).
* If the command is long, we assign its result to a variable. This will of course cause an error if the function does not return a value - but such functions are few and it is much more likely that a (long) function does return a value.
* When getting a variable, we make a direct call to `Expect._eval_line_using_file` if a file should be needed to avoid having two `Print`s and hence an error.

This problem has existed before this ticket was opened, so the cases when a temporary file is used are marginal at best. If you think it is OK, I can implement the above solution (or maybe someone else can do it, since I'll probably be busy in the following days).

Secondly, `get_using_file` is indeed meant to use a file to read the results. So the code regarding `_get_using_file` should probably be left as it is (of course we can always set `_get_using_file`, so we don't need `try`/`except` blocks to check it), although the length of the input may be a poor predictor of the length of the output. Now, we should check whether getting with a file is actually faster with GAP than directly reading the output.

The other ticket is #19607, and I don't have the technical knowledge of that part of Sage to do a good review of that.

However I have figured out the problem with [comment:23](#comment%3A23), and it is essentially what you wrote in [comment:28](#comment%3A28). I added the following right at the offending doctest:

```
sage: x.str()   # This is why it is returning True
''
sage: x._name   # Because this is making use the file
'a_variable_with_a_name_so_very_very_very_long_that_even_by_itself_will_make_expect_use_a_file'
sage: gap(x._name)   # At least the variable is stored and retrieved correctly...
false
```
So we could likely to suppress this by doing another test with a shorter name being passed. I'm guessing we are somehow recycling variable names in the session, and we either shouldn't or will actually have to handle long variable names before this can get merged (possibly both too). I'm okay with suppressing with a note in the doctest referencing this issue. Anyone familiar with the interface have a better idea of what is going on?
