Keywords: GAP functions interface

When calling a GAP function, the current code outputs its result twice for each call - first time when the function is called, and once again when checking whether the function actually returned something. Then, when the result is actually needed, it is once again read from the variable storing it.

This ticket removes the first two outputs, thus greatly speeding up the (still slow) GAP interface. The first output is dealt with by `;;`, which suppresses outputting the result, but not any explicitly printed output (which is caught when the function doesn't actually return anything). The second output, which would be printed and compared with the marker, is now stored in an auxiliary variable, which is then compared with the marker using GAP's `IsIdenticalObj` function (which will also give the correct result in the unlikely case when the function returns `"__SAGE_LAST__"`, except in the even more unlikely case when it returns the marker object itself).

The speedup achieved by this fix can be quite dramatic. For example, calling `A.conjugacy_classes_subgroups()` for a permutation group `A` of order 2000 took about 20 seconds on my laptop, but this is now cut down to under 10 seconds (which is still slower than it needs to be, IMO).

I suspect the reason we are seeing a slowdown in these smaller function calls is because of the extra GAP call:

```python
if self.eval('IsIdenticalObj(__SAGE_VAL__, __SAGE_LAST__)') != 'true':
```
I think we could probably just check if `res` is non-empty:

```python
self.eval('__SAGE_LAST__ := "__SAGE_LAST__";;')
res = self.eval("%s(%s);;"%(function, ",".join([s.name() for s in args]+
                ['%s=%s'%(key,value.name()) for key, value in kwds.items()])))
if not res: # No printing was done
    if self.eval('IsIdenticalObj(last, __SAGE_LAST__)') != 'true':
        return self.new('last2')
else:
    if res.strip():
        from sage.interfaces.expect import AsciiArtString
        return AsciiArtString(res)

This is the current behavior in Sage, so it's not really a problem. However, with our current approach, we could print out any non-trivial print statements along with functions that print and give outputs.

Although I think we do need 2 function calls, where the second one is the current call to `IsIdenticalObject`.

Hi!

I've tried a few alternatives. First of all, for reference, the timings on my laptop with the develop branch (i.e., 6.10.beta4):

```
sage: P = groups.permutation.Symmetric(7)
sage: %time S = P.conjugacy_classes_subgroups()
CPU times: user 944 ms, sys: 64 ms, total: 1.01 s
Wall time: 1.33 s

sage: P = groups.matrix.GL(3, 3)
sage: %timeit P.conjugacy_classes_representatives()
100 loops, best of 3: 3.26 ms per loop

sage: P = groups.permutation.Suzuki(8)
sage: %time S = P.conjugacy_classes_subgroups()
CPU times: user 300 ms, sys: 40 ms, total: 340 ms
Wall time: 421 ms
```

With the current branch, there is a small slowdown when there wasn't much output to cut, as expected:

```
sage: P = groups.permutation.Symmetric(7)
sage: %time S = P.conjugacy_classes_subgroups()
CPU times: user 1.08 s, sys: 120 ms, total: 1.2 s
Wall time: 1.42 s

sage: P = groups.matrix.GL(3, 3)
sage: %timeit P.conjugacy_classes_representatives()
100 loops, best of 3: 3.31 ms per loop

sage: P = groups.permutation.Suzuki(8)
sage: %time S = P.conjugacy_classes_subgroups()
CPU times: user 220 ms, sys: 40 ms, total: 260 ms
Wall time: 343 ms
```

I've tried removing `IsIdenticalObj`:

```python
marker1 = '"__SAGE_LAST1__"'
marker2 = '"__SAGE_LAST2__"'
self.eval('__SAGE_LAST1__ := %s;;' % marker1)
self.eval('__SAGE_LAST2__ := %s;;' % marker2)
res = self.eval("%s(%s);;"%(function, ",".join([s.name() for s in args]+
                ['%s=%s'%(key,value.name()) for key, value in kwds.items()])))
if self.eval('last2') == marker2:
    return self.new('last2')
else:
    ...
```
But it seems that `IsIdenticalObj` isn't that expensive after all:

```
sage: P = groups.permutation.Symmetric(7)
sage: %time S = P.conjugacy_classes_subgroups()
CPU times: user 1.08 s, sys: 132 ms, total: 1.22 s
Wall time: 1.5 s

sage: P = groups.matrix.GL(3, 3)
sage: %timeit P.conjugacy_classes_representatives()

sage: P = groups.permutation.Suzuki(8)
sage: %time S = P.conjugacy_classes_subgroups()
CPU times: user 240 ms, sys: 28 ms, total: 268 ms

```

I've also tried making all calls in a single `eval`, but it seems that `last` doesn't work when used in a file. So it will probably be best to keep the latest version with `IsIdenticalObj`.

interestingly, libGAP is quite slow here.

```
sage: %time S = P.conjugacy_classes_subgroups()
CPU times: user 143 ms, sys: 24 ms, total: 167 ms
Wall time: 181 ms
sage: P = libgap.SuzukiGroup(libgap.IsPermGroup,8)
sage: %time S=P.ConjugacyClassesSubgroups()

I guess there handling of `P` and `S` on the Sage side is not optimal...

Hello again!

OK, I added the check for overlong function calls, and it doesn't seem to affect runnning times. Such calls would probably never happen, but we can simulate one with something like

```python
gap.function_call("ConjugacyClassesSubgroups", sage.interfaces.gap.GapElement(gap, 'SymmetricGroup(2)', name = 'a_variable_with_a_very_very_very_long_name'))
```
Without the latest commit, this would return a wrong result.

I have also experimented with also making the check for identical objects in the same `eval` if the function call was short enough, but this invariably caused slowdowns.

While in principle, I think these recent changes are okay, could someone else double-check that we want to do things this way?

As for the current code, I would change:

```diff
-        if isinstance(self._name, six.string_types) and parent._eval_using_file_cutoff and \
-           parent._eval_using_file_cutoff < len(self._name):
-            self._get_using_file = True
+        self._get_using_file = (isinstance(self._name, six.string_types)
+                                and parent._eval_using_file_cutoff
+                                and parent._eval_using_file_cutoff < len(self._name))
```
so we don't have to do a `try/except` block:

```diff
         if use_file is None:
-            try:
-                use_file = self._get_using_file
-            except AttributeError:
-                use_file = False

{
    "body": "Hello everybody!\n\nIt turns out that we still have some issues here.\n\nFirstly, GAP function calls don't actually work when done through a temporary file, nor does getting a variable (which is essentially a `Print` call). The reason for this is that when `_eval_line_using_file` is called, it first looks for a `:=` token - if there is one, all is well; but since we are relying on `last`, we don't have one, and a `Print()` is wrapped around our function call. If the function actually returns a value, this gives an impression of working, since the correct result is printed - but we get an `AsciiArtString` instead of a `GapElement`. When the function does not return a value, the situation is even worse, since printing the result of a function which does not return a result results in an error (which is silently suppressed, and an empty string is returned).\n\nNow, it seems that we can't really solve this problem, since `last` is not updated when commands are read from a file.

Hello everybody!

It turns out that we still have some issues here.

Firstly, GAP function calls don't actually work when done through a temporary file, nor does getting a variable (which is essentially a `Print` call). The reason for this is that when `_eval_line_using_file` is called, it first looks for a `:=` token - if there is one, all is well; but since we are relying on `last`, we don't have one, and a `Print()` is wrapped around our function call. If the function actually returns a value, this gives an impression of working, since the correct result is printed - but we get an `AsciiArtString` instead of a `GapElement`. When the function does not return a value, the situation is even worse, since printing the result of a function which does not return a result results in an error (which is silently suppressed, and an empty string is returned).

Now, it seems that we can't really solve this problem, since `last` is not updated when commands are read from a file. So I'd suggest this is how we deal with it:
* If the command is short, evaluate it directly (one or two `eval`s, as in the latest commit).
* If the command is long, we assign its result to a variable. This will of course cause an error if the function does not return a value - but such functions are few and it is much more likely that a (long) function does return a value.
* When getting a variable, we make a direct call to `Expect._eval_line_using_file` if a file should be needed to avoid having two `Print`s and hence an error.

This problem has existed before this ticket was opened, so the cases when a temporary file is used are marginal at best. If you think it is OK, I can implement the above solution (or maybe someone else can do it, since I'll probably be busy in the following days).

Secondly, `get_using_file` is indeed meant to use a file to read the results. So the code regarding `_get_using_file` should probably be left as it is (of course we can always set `_get_using_file`, so we don't need `try`/`except` blocks to check it), although the length of the input may be a poor predictor of the length of the output. Now, we should check whether getting with a file is actually faster with GAP than directly reading the output.

The other ticket is #19607, and I don't have the technical knowledge of that part of Sage to do a good review of that.

However I have figured out the problem with comment:23, and it is essentially what you wrote in comment:28. I added the following right at the offending doctest:

```
sage: x.str()   # This is why it is returning True
''
sage: x._name   # Because this is making use the file
'a_variable_with_a_name_so_very_very_very_long_that_even_by_itself_will_make_expect_use_a_file'
sage: gap(x._name)   # At least the variable is stored and retrieved correctly...
false
```
So we could likely to suppress this by doing another test with a shorter name being passed. I'm guessing we are somehow recycling variable names in the session, and we either shouldn't or will actually have to handle long variable names before this can get merged (possibly both too). I'm okay with suppressing with a note in the doctest referencing this issue. Anyone familiar with the interface have a better idea of what is going on?
