 Anything still referring to \`devel/sage\` is a bug.
+
+I kept the following in \`src/mac-app/AppController.m\`, since I don't know how to fix it:
+
+\`\`\`
+    NSString * base_dir = nil;
+    if (neverOpenedFileBrowser) {
+        base_dir = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%@/../devel/sage/sage",sageBinary];
+        neverOpenedFileBrowser=NO;

+\`\`\`
