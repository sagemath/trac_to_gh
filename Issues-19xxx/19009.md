<a id='comment:13'></a>The problem is quite linux specific. The `FLINT_LIB` target creates `libflint.so.x.y.z` and link it to `libflint.so.x` but doesn't create `libflint.so`. That last one is only created on installation. So if you configure flint to only build shared libraries on linux and run `make check` you don't have a usable `libflint.so` in your build directory. If you have one in a `-Lpath` or global location it will be used. If not you'll go for a straight failure.

There's also a bug in gmpcompat.h (fixed in trunk).

I hope it won't take long.

Unfortunately libtool is broken on msys2, so we can't even use that.

And some systems don't make /dev/null executable. What a mess this soname business is!
