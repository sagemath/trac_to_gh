Bill did something for !Cygwin/Mingw (setting `LDCONFIG=/dev/null`). But not OS X. The last state of `configure` in the `trunk` branch shows

```
# sometimes LDCONFIG is not to be found in the path. Look at some common places.

   *)
      if [ -z "$LDCONFIG" ]; then
         if command -v ldconfig > /dev/null; then
            LDCONFIG="ldconfig"
         elif [ -x /sbin/ldconfig ]; then
            LDCONFIG="/sbin/ldconfig"
         else
            echo "Warning: ldconfig was not found. You can specify a path on the command line with LDCONFIG=<name>";

I'm afraid there is going to be a 2.5.2. This soname versioning is causing problems everywhere, even with the fixes.

There's also a bug in gmpcompat.h (fixed in trunk).

I hope it won't take long.

Unfortunately libtool is broken on msys2, so we can't even use that.

And some systems don't make /dev/null executable. What a mess this soname business is!

Can someone verify that "true" is available on OSX as an alternative to /dev/null and that it ignores arguments, i.e.

true blah 1 2 3 "hello"

does nothing. I want to use this instead of /dev/null in lieu of LDCONFIG, since more and more systems are making /dev/null not executable.
