ATLAS builds lots of executables during the build/tuning process. Not all these use rpath correctly. This causes in particular problems with a GCC installed in `$SAGE_LOCAL` when building ATLAS 3.11.38:

```
./xf77test: error while loading shared libraries: libgfortran.so.3: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```
