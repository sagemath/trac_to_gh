A bug? I don't know.

Should this be marked as dependency to #19061? It is quite meaningless without this, even if technically not dependig.

With this last commit, I ready to bet that this ticket is now in conflict with #19061. I will have to fix the conflicts with a merge, but I would prefer this branch to be reviewed first, in order to avoid having to merge and re-merge things several times in case this review requires other changes.

Well, then we will have to find a way around, i.e. expose a parameter to change the delimiter manually, if needed. This being said, I am no magician: I looked at the table of ASCII characters and tried to figure out one that I could use. I picked that one because I thought it was okay, but it can be whatever else you prefer.

Just to confirm: the character is required to be in ASCII, not even ISO-8859-1?

Can it be non-printing character, i.e. some code between 1 and 31?

True. That is what I noticed in comment 7. But should there be a warning about non-ascii characters, now when there is about ``@``?

Not a big deal, of course. So don't let this prevent giving positive review.

The thing is that the docstrings of the code constructors do not respect the convention that the first line must be a short sentence describing the function, and as a result the first paragraph contains a *LOT* of text (including some latex).

Previously, only one (broken) sentence was displayed in the index. At least now the "sentence" is complete.

A meta-ticket about that? Do you have an easy way to get a list of those? I mean something like "oneliners with more than one dot" or "oneliners with more then 150 characters"?

No. I guess it has to be written "from scratch", or else it must be some long regexp.

What? Long regexp? Those are always fun!

But actually this is easier with some bash magic. Here is one example:

```
(while egrep -m 1 '^    def [^_]'; do head -10 | egrep -m 1 -B 10 '^$' | tr '\n' ' '; echo; done) <
src/sage/combinat/posets/posets.py | tr -d '`' | egrep '.{250,}' -B 1 | egrep '^    def [^_]'
```

This founds `level_sets()` and `coxeter_transformation()`.
