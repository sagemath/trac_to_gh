<a id='comment:4'></a>One reviewer commit and to minor issues:
1. `TermMonoidFactory`. When reading its documentation because it was used by `change_parameter`, I am no longer happy with the description (and probably also the name) of the parameter `term`:  "or an existing instance of a term." should be replaced by "or an existing instance of a term monoid". Also "the kind of term that shall be created" is not really precise ("the kind of terms held in the new term monoid")
2. `map_coefficients`: `== 0` vs. `is_zero()`?
