```
Improve `FiniteStateMachine.number_of_words`:
- provide a parameter `base_ring` (currently, `QQbar` is always used)
- remove `assert` statements (may produce `DivisionByZero` due to evaluation for small `n`)
- add doctest for eigenvalue zero
- compute in `base_ring` as long as possible and move to symbolic ring as late as possible
- do not compute inverses, but solve linear systems of equations
