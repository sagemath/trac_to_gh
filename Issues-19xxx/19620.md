In order to have fast infinite words, we implement a new class `WordDatatype_char_infinite` that uses an `unsigned char *` as data. It lazily updates this cache on demand. The previous `WordDatatype_char` is renamed `WordDatatype_char_finite`. With this branch we have several predefined classes

- `WordDatatype_iter_char`
- `WordDatatype_callable_char`
- `WordDatatype_substitutive_char`

And it is very simple to create a new class for a word by inheritance (either in Python or Cython) from `WordDatatype_char_infinite`.

As a prerequisite, we need to add one indirection level for finite words (i.e. use an `unsigned char **` instead of an `unsigned char *`) as the data pointed by an infinite word might be reallocated.

Some timings with the develop branch

```
sage: w = WordMorphism({0: [0,1], 1:[0]}).fixed_point(0)
sage: %time w[2**15]
CPU times: user 1.26 s, sys: 16 ms, total: 1.27 s
Wall time: 1.23 s
sage: w = WordMorphism({0: [0,1], 1:[0]}).fixed_point(0)
sage: %time w[2**16]
CPU times: user 4.58 s, sys: 24 ms, total: 4.6 s
Wall time: 4.48 s
sage: w = WordMorphism({0: [0,1], 1:[0]}).fixed_point(0)
sage: %time w[2**17]
CPU times: user 21.7 s, sys: 28 ms, total: 21.8 s
Wall time: 21.7 s
```
while on `u/vdelecroix/19620` we have

```
sage: w = WordMorphism({0:[0,1], 1:[0]}).fixed_point(0)
sage: %time w[2**20]
CPU times: user 16 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 16 ms
Wall time: 18.3 ms
```
Moreover, since the finite slices now shares with the infinite words it is very fast to get the prefixes. On develop we had

```
sage: W = InfiniteWords([0,1])
sage: w = W(lambda n: Integer(n).popcount()%2)
sage: %time w[2**16]
CPU times: user 0 ns, sys: 0 ns, total: 0 ns
Wall time: 169 Âµs
sage: %timeit w[:2**16]
10 loops, best of 3: 50.3 ms per loop
```
while on `u/vdelecroix/19620`

```
sage: W = InfiniteWords([0,1])
sage: w = W(lambda n: Integer(n).popcount()%2)
sage: %time w[2**16]
CPU times: user 60 ms, sys: 12 ms, total: 72 ms
Wall time: 61.2 ms
sage: %timeit w[:2**16]
1000000 loops, best of 3: 913 ns per loop
```
Note that however the call to `w[2**16]` is slower in the new version. The reason is that this computation actually caches **all** letters up to `w[2**16]`.

<a id='comment:15'></a>Right. For me a word already has some combinatorial flavour. It is already a mathematical object. The `lazy_list` would be one possible backend. An other one (which is the object of this ticket) is using a reallocable `char *`.

Note that you can avoid precomputations with word initialization with the option `check=False`

```
sage: W = Words()
sage: w = W(lambda n: haha[n], check=False)  # no precomputation
sage: w[0]
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NameError: global name 'haha' is not defined
```
Ideally you should start with `W = W = Words(SymmetricFunctions(QQ))` but that ends up with `AttributeError: 'SymmetricFunctions_with_category' object has no attribute 'cardinality'`.

And, at least for the moment, I'm not concerned about speed but only about the interface.  There are several sage objects that seem to have similar objective but different user interface: eg. `Family`, `Sequence`.  There is also #16107...",

Yes, this makes sense to me - I just thought that #16137 is dead.  And, at least for the moment, I'm not concerned about speed but only about the interface.  There are several sage objects that seem to have similar objective but different user interface: eg. `Family`, `Sequence`.  There is also #16107...
