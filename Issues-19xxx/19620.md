In order to have fast infinite words, we implement a new class `WordDatatype_char_infinite` that uses an `unsigned char *` as data. It lazily updates this cache on demand. The previous `WordDatatype_char` is renamed `WordDatatype_char_finite`. With this branch we have several predefined classes

- `WordDatatype_iter_char`
- `WordDatatype_callable_char`
- `WordDatatype_substitutive_char`

And it is very simple to create a new class for a word by inheritance (either in Python or Cython) from `WordDatatype_char_infinite`.

As a prerequisite, we need to add one indirection level for finite words (i.e. use an `unsigned char **` instead of an `unsigned char *`) as the data pointed by an infinite word might be reallocated.

Some timings with the develop branch

```
sage: w = WordMorphism({0: [0,1], 1:[0]}).fixed_point(0)
sage: %time w[2**15]
CPU times: user 1.26 s, sys: 16 ms, total: 1.27 s
Wall time: 1.23 s
sage: w = WordMorphism({0: [0,1], 1:[0]}).fixed_point(0)
sage: %time w[2**16]
CPU times: user 4.58 s, sys: 24 ms, total: 4.6 s
Wall time: 4.48 s
sage: w = WordMorphism({0: [0,1], 1:[0]}).fixed_point(0)
sage: %time w[2**17]
CPU times: user 21.7 s, sys: 28 ms, total: 21.8 s
Wall time: 21.7 s
```
while on `u/vdelecroix/19620` we have

```
sage: w = WordMorphism({0:[0,1], 1:[0]}).fixed_point(0)
sage: %time w[2**20]
CPU times: user 16 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 16 ms
Wall time: 18.3 ms
```
Moreover, since the finite slices now shares with the infinite words it is very fast to get the prefixes. On develop we had

```
sage: W = InfiniteWords([0,1])
sage: w = W(lambda n: Integer(n).popcount()%2)
sage: %time w[2**16]
CPU times: user 0 ns, sys: 0 ns, total: 0 ns
Wall time: 169 µs
sage: %timeit w[:2**16]
10 loops, best of 3: 50.3 ms per loop
```
while on `u/vdelecroix/19620`

```
sage: W = InfiniteWords([0,1])
sage: w = W(lambda n: Integer(n).popcount()%2)
sage: %time w[2**16]
CPU times: user 60 ms, sys: 12 ms, total: 72 ms
Wall time: 61.2 ms
sage: %timeit w[:2**16]
1000000 loops, best of 3: 913 ns per loop
```
Note that however the call to `w[2**16]` is slower in the new version. The reason is that this computation actually caches **all** letters up to `w[2**16]`.

 ```
-while with the uplodaded one
+while on `u/vdelecroix/19620` we have
 
 ```
 sage: w = WordMorphism({0:[0,1], 1:[0]}).fixed_point(0)
 sage: %time w[2**20]
 CPU times: user 16 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 16 ms
 Wall time: 18.3 ms
-1
-sage: %timeit w[:2**15]
-1000000 loops, best of 3: 905 ns per loop
+```
+Moreover, since the finite slices now shares with the infinite words it is very fast to get the prefixes. On develop we had
+
+```
+sage: W = InfiniteWords([0,1])
+sage: w = W(lambda n: Integer(n).popcount()%2)
+sage: %time w[2**16]
+CPU times: user 0 ns, sys: 0 ns, total: 0 ns

-sage: %timeit w[:2**17]
-1000000 loops, best of 3: 910 ns per loop
-sage: %timeit w[:2**18]
-1000000 loops, best of 3: 909 ns per loop
+10 loops, best of 3: 50.3 ms per loop
 ```
+while on `u/vdelecroix/19620`
+
+```
+sage: W = InfiniteWords([0,1])
+sage: w = W(lambda n: Integer(n).popcount()%2)
+sage: %time w[2**16]
+CPU times: user 60 ms, sys: 12 ms, total: 72 ms
+Wall time: 61.2 ms
+sage: %timeit w[:2**16]
+1000000 loops, best of 3: 913 ns per loop
+```
+Note that however the call to `w[2**16]` is slower in the new version. The reason is that this computation actually caches **all** letters up to `w[2**16]`.

`p` are the powersum symmetric functions (injected into the name space by `inject_shorthands`.  However, I just realised that I asked a stupid question.  Evidently, I can simply do

```
sage: w_new = Word(lambda l: p(w_old[l]))

Possibly another stupid question: I did `WordOptions(truncate_length=4)`, but it seems that `Word(lambda n: f(n))` still computes many values of `f`.  I'll double check, in any case.

OK, well, I came here from #16137... I am confused by so many different possibilities to create something lazy.  I thought the goal was to have a single entry point (possibly with various backends).

Right. For me a word already has some combinatorial flavour. It is already a mathematical object. The `lazy_list` would be one possible backend. An other one (which is the object of this ticket) is using a reallocable `char *`.

Note that you can avoid precomputations with word initialization with the option `check=False`

```
sage: W = Words()
sage: w = W(lambda n: haha[n], check=False)  # no precomputation
sage: w[0]
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NameError: global name 'haha' is not defined
```
Ideally you should start with `W = W = Words(SymmetricFunctions(QQ))` but that ends up with `AttributeError: 'SymmetricFunctions_with_category' object has no attribute 'cardinality'`.
