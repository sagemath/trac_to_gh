As was pointed in #19781, tides_mpfr does not work properly in the last beta. 

I could trace the problem to the loading of libgmp. I attach a branch that seems to fix it, but it could be that now it is using system's libgmp/libmpfr .

Can somebody test it in a platform without libgmp installed system wide?

You can just test it using `ldd /path/to/binary`

You should **always** add `$LDFLAGS` when creating a binary. That includes shared libraries.

Static libraries (libtides.a) aren't executable so you don't need `$LDFLAGS`.
