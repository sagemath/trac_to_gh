```
Currently we have too many parent for words:
- for finite and infinite words (`Words_all`, `Words_over_alphabet`, `Words_over_OrderedAlphabet`)
- finite words (`FiniteWords_over_OrderedAlphabet`)
- infinite words (`InfiniteWords_over_OrderedAlphabet`)
- words of fixed length (`FiniteWords_length_k_over_OrderedAlphabet` and `Words_n`)

This lead to subtle bug like

```
sage: W = Words([0,1], finite=False, infinite=True)
sage: u = W.an_element()
sage: u[2:5].parent()   # a finite word !!
Infinite Words over {0, 1}
```

The proposal of this ticket is to have only four classes:
- `FiniteWords`
- `Words_n`: words of length `n` (as a slice of the one before)
- `InfiniteWords` (or `FullShift`)
- `FiniteOrInfiniteWords`
The parent `FiniteWords` should hence have a method `.shift()` that return the associated shift (e.g `u ** Infinity` will belong there). Similarly, the parent `InfiniteWords` should have a method `.factors()` that return the set of factors (and finite slices will belong there).

We also:

- deprecate `size_of_alphabet` and `has_letter`
- use a bit more of categories in `lyndon_word.py`
- use more often `Word_char` if possible
- implement a better iterator for periodic points that avoids computing huge power of the morphism (that is not always doable)

It took me much more time than expected... It is not yet completely finished but all tests pass in `combinat/words/`, `combinat/lyndon_word.py` and `combinat/e_one_star.py`.

Read for review. The TODO can be removed. It was because of the `cmp_letters` method. Now its status is decided on construction as follows

```
        if alphabet.cardinality() == Infinity or \
           (alphabet.cardinality() < 36 and
            all(alphabet.unrank(i) > alphabet.unrank(j) for
            i in range(min(36,alphabet.cardinality())) for j in range(i))):
            self.cmp_letters = cmp
        else:
            self.cmp_letters = self._cmp_letters
```
where `_cmp_letters` is the previous version which compares by ranking in the alphabet. It is of course not ideal, but I think that we should get rid of this `cmp_letters` anyway.

In `words.py`, I can add some:

```
TESTS:

    sage: print "hello"
    hello
```
but I do not see the point. The missing doctest are in the deprecated class ``Words_all`` I do not see any relevant test...

For `morphism.py` and `paths.py` I will complete the missing ones.

`AbstractLanguage` is designed to disappear. For the moment it just holds the `_alphabet` attributes and some deprecated methods. I am not sure that all language should keep this `_alphabet` attribute. That can be changed. Do we want that languages implement a method `alphabet` or simply provides an alphabet to the constructor of a base class?

`Words_n` does not care about an attribute `_alphabet` since it is initialized with a `FiniteWords` as first argument. It is essentially an empty shell.

There are other parents doing the same

```
sage: NN.an_element().parent() == NN
False
sage: Primes().an_element().parent() == Primes()
False
```
And this is the concept of facade (in the Sage category sense).

With my branch you always have:
- finte words have a parent `FiniteWords`
- infinite words have a parent `InfiniteWords`
- words with indefinite status have a parent `FiniteOrInfiniteWords`
In particular

```
sage: W = Words('ab')
sage: W('ab').parent() is W.finite_words()
True
sage: W(lambda n: 'a', length='infinite').parent() is W.infinite_words()
True
sage: W(iter("ab"*100)).parent() is W
True
```

It is interesting that you write `FiniteOrInfiniteWords` here instead of `FiniteAndInfiniteWords` in the code because I was going to suggest to call that class `FiniteOrInfiniteWords` instead.

I am still not done with the review as I need more time to think and look at the code... Will continue this tomorrow.

  - Argument `length` in unused in `InfiniteWords.__call__`.
  - Documentation of `InfiniteWords.__call__` should not mention list, str, tuple, char and the length argument.
  - The below lines in `FiniteWords._word_from_word` seem useless. Same comment for `InfiniteWords._word_from_word`:

```python
from sage.combinat.words.finite_word import CallableFromListOfWords
if isinstance(data._func, CallableFromListOfWords):
    # The following line is important because, in this case,
    # data._func is also a tuple (indeed
    # CallableFromListOfWords inherits from tuple)
    datatype = "callable"
```
- `Words_n.__call__` should include a `INPUTS:` block
- The following imports are not used:

```
from sage.misc.mrange import xmrange
from sage.structure.parent import Set_PythonType
from sage.combinat.combinat import InfiniteAbstractCombinatorialClass
```

Definitely not. We do not want to impose the class of elements for (future) languages. Moreover:
- you should not be able to build infinite words from `FiniteWords` or finite ones from `InfiniteWords`.
- the code is now much simpler, isn't it?

To my mind, the documentation is completely useless. Which user will do

```
sage: W = Words('ab')
sage: W.__call__?
```

I think this comment inside `FiniteWords._word_from_word`

```
+            # this must be put first for the reason that CallableFromListOfWords
+            # inherits from tuple
```

is unnecessary and date from the time were one method was doing everything for the creation of a word. Then, data could be a tuple or a `CallableFromListOfWords` which inherits from tuple explaining the reason we needed to test for `isinstance(data, CallableFromListOfWords)` first.

Now, in that method, data is word (not a tuple neither a `CallableFromListOfWords`) so the isinstance tests can be done in any order. Question: what is best to test first?

I tried to do my best for `FiniteWords._word_from_word`. I also removed `_word_from_callable` from `FiniteOrInfiniteWords` and simplified its `__call__`.

I would prefer if the code of `FiniteOrInfiniteWords.__call__` be like the others `FiniteWords.__call__` and `InfiniteWords.__call__` in the sense that first the function does:

```
if datatype is not None:
    #return directly the good word
    if datatype in ['str', 'list', 'char', 'tuple']:
        return etc...
else:
    #guess the datatype, the length, etc.
```

if you agree. It makes the code easier to read and be convince anybody that it does the minimal and most efficient path in the function.

Doing what you do in `InfiniteWords.__call__` essentially reverts ticket #17021 where that kind of guessing was done first. Note that to avoid duplication of code, it is possible that you will have to recreate `_word_from_callable` because of that... or maybe not.

If a user provides `datatype` **and** `length` there will be no guessing... And with what I changed the first step is to determine the length (in order to determine the parent). I do not see how to handle what you suggested without copy/paste.

Some timings with the branch

```
sage: W = Words()
sage: FW = FiniteWords()
sage: L = range(1000)
sage: %timeit W(L, check=False)
100000 loops, best of 3: 2.54 µs per loop
sage: %timeit W(L, length="finite", check=False)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.58 µs per loop
sage: %timeit W(L, datatype="list", check=False)
100000 loops, best of 3: 1.75 µs per loop
sage: %timeit W(L, length="finite", datatype="list", check=False)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.49 µs per loop
sage: %timeit FW(L, check=False)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 823 ns per loop
```
Whereas we have on develop

```
sage: W = Words()
sage: %timeit W(L, check=False)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 800 ns per loop
```
It looks like the code in the branch is:
- 3x slower now if nothing is provided
- 2x slower if length or datatype is provided
- 1x if call directly `FiniteWords`
Plenty of reasons: more inheritance, more function calls.
