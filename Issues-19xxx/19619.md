```
Currently we have too many parent for words:
- for finite and infinite words (`Words_all`, `Words_over_alphabet`, `Words_over_OrderedAlphabet`)
- finite words (`FiniteWords_over_OrderedAlphabet`)
- infinite words (`InfiniteWords_over_OrderedAlphabet`)
- words of fixed length (`FiniteWords_length_k_over_OrderedAlphabet` and `Words_n`)

This lead to subtle bug like

```
sage: W = Words([0,1], finite=False, infinite=True)
sage: u = W.an_element()
sage: u[2:5].parent()   # a finite word !!
Infinite Words over {0, 1}
```

The proposal of this ticket is to have only four classes:
- `FiniteWords`
- `Words_n`: words of length `n` (as a slice of the one before)
- `InfiniteWords` (or `FullShift`)
- `FiniteOrInfiniteWords`
The parent `FiniteWords` should hence have a method `.shift()` that return the associated shift (e.g `u ** Infinity` will belong there). Similarly, the parent `InfiniteWords` should have a method `.factors()` that return the set of factors (and finite slices will belong there).

We also:

- deprecate `size_of_alphabet` and `has_letter`
- use a bit more of categories in `lyndon_word.py`
- use more often `Word_char` if possible
- implement a better iterator for periodic points that avoids computing huge power of the morphism (that is not always doable)

Read for review. The TODO can be removed. It was because of the `cmp_letters` method. Now its status is decided on construction as follows

```
        if alphabet.cardinality() == Infinity or \
           (alphabet.cardinality() < 36 and
            all(alphabet.unrank(i) > alphabet.unrank(j) for
            i in range(min(36,alphabet.cardinality())) for j in range(i))):
            self.cmp_letters = cmp
        else:
            self.cmp_letters = self._cmp_letters
```
where `_cmp_letters` is the previous version which compares by ranking in the alphabet. It is of course not ideal, but I think that we should get rid of this `cmp_letters` anyway.

`AbstractLanguage` is designed to disappear. For the moment it just holds the `_alphabet` attributes and some deprecated methods. I am not sure that all language should keep this `_alphabet` attribute. That can be changed. Do we want that languages implement a method `alphabet` or simply provides an alphabet to the constructor of a base class?

`Words_n` does not care about an attribute `_alphabet` since it is initialized with a `FiniteWords` as first argument. It is essentially an empty shell.

There are other parents doing the same

```
sage: NN.an_element().parent() == NN
False
sage: Primes().an_element().parent() == Primes()
False
```
And this is the concept of facade (in the Sage category sense).

With my branch you always have:
- finte words have a parent `FiniteWords`
- infinite words have a parent `InfiniteWords`
- words with indefinite status have a parent `FiniteOrInfiniteWords`
In particular

```
sage: W = Words('ab')
sage: W('ab').parent() is W.finite_words()
True
sage: W(lambda n: 'a', length='infinite').parent() is W.infinite_words()
True
sage: W(iter("ab"*100)).parent() is W
True
```

Definitely not. We do not want to impose the class of elements for (future) languages. Moreover:
- you should not be able to build infinite words from `FiniteWords` or finite ones from `InfiniteWords`.

To my mind, the documentation is completely useless. Which user will do

is unnecessary and date from the time were one method was doing everything for the creation of a word. Then, data could be a tuple or a `CallableFromListOfWords` which inherits from tuple explaining the reason we needed to test for `isinstance(data, CallableFromListOfWords)` first.

Now, in that method, data is word (not a tuple neither a `CallableFromListOfWords`) so the isinstance tests can be done in any order. Question: what is best to test first?

<a id='comment:47'></a>I would prefer if the code of `FiniteOrInfiniteWords.__call__` be like the others `FiniteWords.__call__` and `InfiniteWords.__call__` in the sense that first the function does:

If a user provides `datatype` **and** `length` there will be no guessing... And with what I changed the first step is to determine the length (in order to determine the parent). I do not see how to handle what you suggested without copy/paste.

<a id='comment:50'></a>Some timings with the branch

```
sage: W = Words()
sage: FW = FiniteWords()
sage: L = range(1000)
sage: %timeit W(L, check=False)
100000 loops, best of 3: 2.54 µs per loop
sage: %timeit W(L, length="finite", check=False)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.58 µs per loop
sage: %timeit W(L, datatype="list", check=False)
100000 loops, best of 3: 1.75 µs per loop
sage: %timeit W(L, length="finite", datatype="list", check=False)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.49 µs per loop
sage: %timeit FW(L, check=False)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 823 ns per loop
```
Whereas we have on develop

```
sage: W = Words()
sage: %timeit W(L, check=False)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 800 ns per loop
```
It looks like the code in the branch is:
- 3x slower now if nothing is provided
- 2x slower if length or datatype is provided
- 1x if call directly `FiniteWords`
Plenty of reasons: more inheritance, more function calls.
