```
Currently we have too many parent for words:
- for finite and infinite words (`Words_all`, `Words_over_alphabet`, `Words_over_OrderedAlphabet`)
- finite words (`FiniteWords_over_OrderedAlphabet`)
- infinite words (`InfiniteWords_over_OrderedAlphabet`)
- words of fixed length (`FiniteWords_length_k_over_OrderedAlphabet` and `Words_n`)

This lead to subtle bug like

```
sage: W = Words([0,1], finite=False, infinite=True)
sage: u = W.an_element()
sage: u[2:5].parent()   # a finite word !!
Infinite Words over {0, 1}
```

The proposal of this ticket is to have only four classes:
- `FiniteWords`
- `Words_n`: words of length `n` (as a slice of the one before)
- `InfiniteWords` (or `FullShift`)
- `FiniteOrInfiniteWords`
The parent `FiniteWords` should hence have a method `.shift()` that return the associated shift (e.g `u ** Infinity` will belong there). Similarly, the parent `InfiniteWords` should have a method `.factors()` that return the set of factors (and finite slices will belong there).

We also:

- deprecate `size_of_alphabet` and `has_letter`
- use a bit more of categories in `lyndon_word.py`
- use more often `Word_char` if possible
- implement a better iterator for periodic points that avoids computing huge power of the morphism (that is not always doable)

Replying to [@seblabbe](#comment%3A10):

Read for review. The TODO can be removed. It was because of the `cmp_letters` method. Now its status is decided on construction as follows

```
        if alphabet.cardinality() == Infinity or \
           (alphabet.cardinality() < 36 and
            all(alphabet.unrank(i) > alphabet.unrank(j) for
            i in range(min(36,alphabet.cardinality())) for j in range(i))):
            self.cmp_letters = cmp
        else:
            self.cmp_letters = self._cmp_letters
```
where `_cmp_letters` is the previous version which compares by ranking in the alphabet. It is of course not ideal, but I think that we should get rid of this `cmp_letters` anyway.

In `words.py`, I can add some:

```
TESTS:

    sage: print "hello"
    hello
```
but I do not see the point. The missing doctest are in the deprecated class ``Words_all`` I do not see any relevant test...

For `morphism.py` and `paths.py` I will complete the missing ones.

`AbstractLanguage` is designed to disappear. For the moment it just holds the `_alphabet` attributes and some deprecated methods. I am not sure that all language should keep this `_alphabet` attribute. That can be changed. Do we want that languages implement a method `alphabet` or simply provides an alphabet to the constructor of a base class?

`Words_n` does not care about an attribute `_alphabet` since it is initialized with a `FiniteWords` as first argument. It is essentially an empty shell.

There are other parents doing the same

```
sage: NN.an_element().parent() == NN
False
sage: Primes().an_element().parent() == Primes()
False
```
And this is the concept of facade (in the Sage category sense).

With my branch you always have:
- finte words have a parent `FiniteWords`
- infinite words have a parent `InfiniteWords`
- words with indefinite status have a parent `FiniteOrInfiniteWords`
In particular

```
sage: W = Words('ab')
sage: W('ab').parent() is W.finite_words()
True
sage: W(lambda n: 'a', length='infinite').parent() is W.infinite_words()
True
sage: W(iter("ab"*100)).parent() is W
True
```

It is interesting that you write `FiniteOrInfiniteWords` here instead of `FiniteAndInfiniteWords` in the code because I was going to suggest to call that class `FiniteOrInfiniteWords` instead.

- Are sure that we do not prefer the `__call__` to be implemented in one place in `AbstractLanguage`? Lot of documentation is a copy paste...
  - Argument `length` in unused in `InfiniteWords.__call__`.
  - Documentation of `InfiniteWords.__call__` should not mention list, str, tuple, char and the length argument.
  - The below lines in `FiniteWords._word_from_word` seem useless. Same comment for `InfiniteWords._word_from_word`:

```python
from sage.combinat.words.finite_word import CallableFromListOfWords
if isinstance(data._func, CallableFromListOfWords):
    # The following line is important because, in this case,
    # data._func is also a tuple (indeed
    # CallableFromListOfWords inherits from tuple)
    datatype = "callable"
```
- `Words_n.__call__` should include a `INPUTS:` block
- The following imports are not used:

```
from sage.misc.mrange import xmrange
from sage.structure.parent import Set_PythonType
from sage.combinat.combinat import InfiniteAbstractCombinatorialClass
```

Definitely not. We do not want to impose the class of elements for (future) languages. Moreover:
- you should not be able to build infinite words from `FiniteWords` or finite ones from `InfiniteWords`.
- the code is now much simpler, isn't it?

To my mind, the documentation is completely useless. Which user will do

```
sage: W = Words('ab')
sage: W.__call__?
```

```
+            # this must be put first for the reason that CallableFromListOfWords
+            # inherits from tuple

is unnecessary and date from the time were one method was doing everything for the creation of a word. Then, data could be a tuple or a `CallableFromListOfWords` which inherits from tuple explaining the reason we needed to test for `isinstance(data, CallableFromListOfWords)` first.

Now, in that method, data is word (not a tuple neither a `CallableFromListOfWords`) so the isinstance tests can be done in any order. Question: what is best to test first?

I would prefer if the code of `FiniteOrInfiniteWords.__call__` be like the others `FiniteWords.__call__` and `InfiniteWords.__call__` in the sense that first the function does:

```
if datatype is not None:
    #return directly the good word
    if datatype in ['str', 'list', 'char', 'tuple']:
        return etc...
else:
    #guess the datatype, the length, etc.
```

if you agree. It makes the code easier to read and be convince anybody that it does the minimal and most efficient path in the function.

Doing what you do in `InfiniteWords.__call__` essentially reverts ticket #17021 where that kind of guessing was done first. Note that to avoid duplication of code, it is possible that you will have to recreate `_word_from_callable` because of that... or maybe not.

If a user provides `datatype` **and** `length` there will be no guessing... And with what I changed the first step is to determine the length (in order to determine the parent). I do not see how to handle what you suggested without copy/paste.

Some timings with the branch

```
sage: W = Words()
sage: FW = FiniteWords()
sage: L = range(1000)
sage: %timeit W(L, check=False)
100000 loops, best of 3: 2.54 µs per loop
sage: %timeit W(L, length="finite", check=False)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.58 µs per loop
sage: %timeit W(L, datatype="list", check=False)
100000 loops, best of 3: 1.75 µs per loop
sage: %timeit W(L, length="finite", datatype="list", check=False)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.49 µs per loop
sage: %timeit FW(L, check=False)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 823 ns per loop
```
Whereas we have on develop

```
sage: W = Words()
sage: %timeit W(L, check=False)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 800 ns per loop
```
It looks like the code in the branch is:
- 3x slower now if nothing is provided
- 2x slower if length or datatype is provided
- 1x if call directly `FiniteWords`
Plenty of reasons: more inheritance, more function calls.
