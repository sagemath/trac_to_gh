1. make `_get_object()` a `cpdef` method again, like it was with Cython 0.18 and before, see #14452. This exposes a Python bug (incorrectly claimed to be a Cython bug) which needs to be fixed.

2. use `PyObject_RichCompare()` as a shortcut in `__richcmp__()`.

3. use `print` syntax compatible with Python 3.

**Upstream bug**: [http://bugs.python.org/issue25750](http://bugs.python.org/issue25750)

Upstream: Fixed upstream, but not in a stable release.

Reviewer: Travis Scrimshaw

Author: Jeroen Demeyer

Branch: 308fa0258773ac7a9b3d797aab268febaa09846e

Resolution: fixed
