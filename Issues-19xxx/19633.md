1. make `_get_object()` a `cpdef` method again, like it was with Cython 0.18 and before, see #14452. This exposes a Python bug (incorrectly claimed to be a Cython bug) which needs to be fixed.

2. use `PyObject_RichCompare()` as a shortcut in `__richcmp__()`.

3. use `print` syntax compatible with Python 3.

**Upstream bug**: [http://bugs.python.org/issue25750](http://bugs.python.org/issue25750)

Branch: **[308fa02](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/308fa0258773ac7a9b3d797aab268febaa09846e)**

Upstream: **Fixed upstream, but not in a stable release.**

Nearly trivial, but from my interpretation of [the 3rd party packaging doc](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/packaging.html#package-versioning), we were suppose to have the first patched version be `.p0`? If we are suppose to be `.p1`, then you can set a positive review. Otherwise, you can set positive review after the appropriate change.

I really don't think it matters if it's `.p0` or `.p1`. But I'll change it because you ask.
