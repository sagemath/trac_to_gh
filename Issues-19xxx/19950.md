The hidden doc can be build using

```
sage -docbuild -u
```
but this does not work for a single file. Let us allow that.

later aim: use that in a patchbot plugin.

Duh, why not in `sage`-directory? And sorry for dumb question, should have used `strace`. Or read the output...

When I ran this for `posets.py` I got doc for `posets.is_poset(dig)`, not for `sage.combinat.posets.posets.is_poset(dig)`. Is this a planned feature?

This does not put functions to index generated by `{INDEX_OF_METHODS}`. I think that it is not needed, but I mention this in any case.

Seems to work. I will read the code lines little later.

There is no reason to assume that the user has write access to the Sage directory.
