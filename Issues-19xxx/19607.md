As observed in #19585, evaluating GAP commands using a temporary file can cause problems as the output is handled differently - for example, strings printed from the console are wrapped in `""`, but not when they are `Print`ed, as would happen when fetched using a file.

This patch aims to fix the difference by assigning the results of a command to an auxiliary value when applicable, and then print the contents of the variable from the console. This replaces the call to `Print`, which gave possibly malformed results. It still causes an error when calling a function that does not return a variable, but since the side effects still apply, the behaviour doesn't change in these cases.

However, now we attempt to detect whether `Print` or `Display` is being called. In this case, the command is passed on unchanged, as trying to assign would cause us to lose the output due to the error. Of course, this does in no way cover all cases when such an output may be lost.

The branch includes commits from #19585, since it builds upon the changes made there.
