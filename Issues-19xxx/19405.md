Last one in this series, I promise.

The Lyapunov rank measures the length of a `lyapunov_like_basis()` and quantifies how many equations you can get out of the complementarity condition `<x,s> = 0`. Counting a basis is easy but unnecessarily slow when, for example, you have a single ray in a 100-dimensional space.

The new `lyapunov_rank()` method computes the rank using a shortcut based on considering that single ray as living in its own span. Then the remaining 99-dimensions worth of zeros are easily dealt with.

The operation of "considering the ray as living in its own span" is a bit tricky, and can only be done up to linear isomorphism. A private helper method `_restrict_to_space()` handles that.

This is new stuff, but I've presented it to the department (http://michael.orlitzky.com/presentations/the_lyapunov_rank_of_an_improper_cone_-_part_i_-_algorithms.pdf) and a few people have even read the preprint. Perhaps more importantly, there's a doctest that checks the answer against the naive algorithm: `len(K.lyapunov_like_basis())`. So I'm Pretty Sure it works.

I read enough to make sure that we're actually talking about the same thing when we say \"dual cone.\" I think the difference is that you construct the dual cone from the dual vector space whose elements then act on primal vectors via multiplication (function application). Then a rational cone is one that can be represented on an integer lattice?\n\nIn optimization, I've only ever seen the dual cone defined in the primal space, but our definition starts in essentially the same way. Rather than a cone of row vectors in a dual space, we just think of the associated column vectors in the original space. That is, the cone of `v`s such that `f_v(w) >= 0` for all `w` in the cone (where the `f_v` live in the dual vector space).\n\nThe out-of-place subspace argument is part of the reason why I made `_restrict_to_subspace` private. The other is that it's probably less useful than you think, since it only does what it's supposed to up to linear isomorphism. Unless you're studying something (like Lyapunov rank) that's invariant under linear isomorphism, the restriction just doesn't work.\n\n\n> I will look closer in a few day (remind me if I don't ;-)), but it is something worth thinking about: each cone `K` is coming with its associated space in Sage `K.lattice()` which is not an innter-product space, and `K.dual()` lives in a different space. It would be best if all methods and implementations were in agreement on this point.\n\nMy use of the fact that `K.lattice().vector_space()` and `K.dual().lattice().vector_space()` both have column-vector bases is a bit unsanitary maybe. I guess the latter should be row vectors, and I'd have to convert them before taking their span in the primal space. Acknowledging that the primal/dual rays live in dual spaces isn't a problem as long as I can convert between the two.\n\nAnyway thanks for looking and I'll do what I can to clean it up.",

Replying to [@novoselt](#comment%3A2):
> `_restrict_to_subspace` sounds more appropriate and in principle can be of interest on its own, but after reading a bit of your presentation I see that you think of dual cones as living in the same space.

It's safe to say that everything I know about toric geometry is from your docstrings. I read enough to make sure that we're actually talking about the same thing when we say "dual cone." I think the difference is that you construct the dual cone from the dual vector space whose elements then act on primal vectors via multiplication (function application). Then a rational cone is one that can be represented on an integer lattice?

In optimization, I've only ever seen the dual cone defined in the primal space, but our definition starts in essentially the same way. Rather than a cone of row vectors in a dual space, we just think of the associated column vectors in the original space. That is, the cone of `v`s such that `f_v(w) >= 0` for all `w` in the cone (where the `f_v` live in the dual vector space).

The out-of-place subspace argument is part of the reason why I made `_restrict_to_subspace` private. The other is that it's probably less useful than you think, since it only does what it's supposed to up to linear isomorphism. Unless you're studying something (like Lyapunov rank) that's invariant under linear isomorphism, the restriction just doesn't work.


> I will look closer in a few day (remind me if I don't ;-)), but it is something worth thinking about: each cone `K` is coming with its associated space in Sage `K.lattice()` which is not an innter-product space, and `K.dual()` lives in a different space. It would be best if all methods and implementations were in agreement on this point.

My use of the fact that `K.lattice().vector_space()` and `K.dual().lattice().vector_space()` both have column-vector bases is a bit unsanitary maybe. I guess the latter should be row vectors, and I'd have to convert them before taking their span in the primal space. Acknowledging that the primal/dual rays live in dual spaces isn't a problem as long as I can convert between the two.

Anyway thanks for looking and I'll do what I can to clean it up.

Ping =)

I'm only being annoying because I'm waiting to submit this paper and I'd like to be able to say "these algorithms are all implemented in sage-6.10..."

You are of course under no obligation to review this -- much less positively -- so if you think it might take a while, I can just submit the paper as-is and try to add that blurb later.

Well, I do intend to review this positively, I just usually try to really understand the code and read documentation ;-) Life got a bit busier, but I still hope to manage in time for 6.10.

1. Can we please remove "yet we have no way to perform operations like :meth:`dual` in the subspace" or augment it to the effect of "it is not implemented at the moment" since mathematically there is nothing wrong with taking a cone in a saturated sublattice and considering its dual, which will live in the torsion-free quotient of the dual of the original lattice. I actually had a hope that it will work already, but apparently it does not.
2. The last test in the helper method goes very much against the philosophy of toric dualities with dual lattices being distinct:

```
+        Through a series of restrictions, any closed convex cone can be
+        reduced to a cartesian product with a proper factor [Orlitzky]_::
+
+            sage: set_random_seed()
+            sage: K = random_cone(max_ambient_dim = 8)
+            sage: K_S = K._restrict_to_subspace(K.span())
+            sage: P = K_S.dual().span()
+            sage: K_SP = K_S._restrict_to_subspace(P)
+            sage: K_SP.is_proper()
+            True
```
 Given that this method is there only for the sake of `lyapunov_rank`, I would suggest making it an internal function of `lyapunov_rank`. In this case you can do whatever you want and in fact there is no need at all for documentation and tests - you are of course welcome to still explain what it does, but I am not even sure if test will run on internal functions.
1. Note that there is already `strict_quotient` doing one of the restrictions you need:

```
sage: K = Cone([(1,1,1), (1,0,0), (-1,0,0)])
sage: K
2-d cone in 3-d lattice N
sage: K.rays()
N( 0, 1, 1),
N( 1, 0, 0),
N(-1, 0, 0)
in 3-d lattice N
sage: K.strict_quotient()
1-d cone in 2-d lattice N
sage: K.strict_quotient().rays()
N(1, 1)
in 2-d lattice N
```
1. The recommended spacing for keywords is `random_cone(max_ambient_dim=8)` rather than `random_cone(max_ambient_dim = 8)`

Replying to [@novoselt](#comment%3A9):
> Well, to start with, we should realize that it is NOT a quotient! And that's one of those cases when all the fuss about distinct lattices M and N is handy. If our cone lives in N, then `orthogonal_sublattice` is in M and there is no way to quotient N by it.

So that I don't make the same mistake again, I have a few disorganized questions:

1. What exactly is the problem with the quotient? Is it that `M` and `N` are different, so we don't think of the thing in `M` as being a subthing of the thing in `N`? (This makes sense to me, I just didn't expect a "sublattice" method to give me something in another lattice.)

2. I borrowed the quotient terminology from `strict_quotient` where we go through the back door of `linear_subspace()` -- why isn't that cheating too, since it drops down to vector spaces?

3. Sage will let me take the lattice quotient of `N` and a sublattice `M`. Isn't it supposed to stop me? The docstring says it checks for a valid sublattice. Here's an example:

```
sage: K = Cone([(1,0,0),(0,1,0)])
sage: K.lattice()
3-d lattice N
sage: K.orthogonal_sublattice()
Sublattice <M(0, 0, 1)>
sage: K.lattice().quotient(K.orthogonal_sublattice())
2-d lattice, quotient of 3-d lattice N by Free module of degree 3 and rank 1 over Integer Ring
Echelon basis matrix:
[0 0 1]
```

4. If the only problem is the `M`/`N` distinction, can I use `sublattice_complement()` instead of `orthogonal_complement()`? I think this gives me the correct subthing:

```
sage: K.sublattice_complement()
Sublattice <N(0, 0, 1)>
```

Could I now consider `K.lattice().quotient(K.sublattice_complement())` a true quotient?

I'd like to stick to things that make sense in your framework but I may need some hints. I'd hate to use an internal function because then we'd lose the doctests.

It is a true quotient in the sense that it is a mathematically legal operation, however this is not what you want. What you want is just `K.sublattice()` - get coordinates of rays of `K` in the basis of this sublattice and return a new cone in the generic lattice of this dimension generated by those coordinates. Something like

```
N_K = K.sublattice()
L = ToricLattice(N_K.dimension(), <name tweaks>)
Cone([L(N_K.coordinates(r)) for r in K], check=False)
```

The docbuild process throws a fit about duplicate references -- those two appear as references to `discrete_complementarity_set()` and `lyapunov_like_basis()`. That leaves two bad choices: decide it's okay for your build system to spit out big red errors, or mess up the formatting of the references block. I flipped a coin.


> Not for this ticket - couldn't you use this more efficient algorithm for computing the Lyapunov basis as well? I.e. compute it for the restriction and then modify appropriately to account for the space and trivial factors?

Probably =)

Any closed convex cone `K` is isomorphic to a cartesian product of three factors:

1. `K.solid_restriction().strict_quotient()`
2. `K.linear_subspace()`
3. The trivial cone in `K.span().complement()`

Suppose some matrix `A` sends the cone `K` to this nice representation as a product. If we let `L` be a 3x3 block matrix, then you can figure out what the entries should be if `L` is to be Lyapunov-like on `A(K)`. That's basically what I did in Lemma 1 in the paper, but then I threw away some information and just counted dimensions.

The block entries of `L` will be one of three things:

1. Lyapunov-like transformations on `K.solid_restriction().strict_quotient()`
2. Zero
3. Arbitrary

You can fill them in with some coordinate juggling. Afterwards, Proposition 5 shows you how to get back in terms of `K`: simply conjugate by the matrix `A` that put `K` into the nice cartesian product. The only complications I see are aesthetic.

And I told you this boring story... so that I would have a good example below!


> I think it would be better to have `solid_restriction` return the original cone if it is already solid. The amount of time required for the check is not much compared to constructing a new cone and the advantages are common sense and being able to reuse all cached data. My version of changes are posted.

The problem I foresee with this is that it gives you different behavior for solid/nonsolid cones. If `K` is solid, you'll get its representation in one basis, but if it's not, you'll get it in another basis.

Suppose I actually wanted to implement the fast `lyapunov_like_basis` algorithm above. I would need to know which change-of-basis occurs when I call `K.solid_restriction()`, because I would eventually need to do a conjugation involving it. But the change-of-basis depends on whether or not `K` was solid to begin with.

In similar cases where you need to know what happened in `solid_restriction()`, you'll need to prefix that call with `if K.solid()...`, duplicating the check inside the method. Two possible behaviors inside the function forces two possible responses outside it.


Everything else looks fine, tests pass, etc.

I can tell you exactly what matrix to use for the change of coordinates when the cone itself is returned, but I suspect you know it yourself ;-)

The method does not claim anything about which basis is used (although we can mention it, of course) and mathematically there is no good (=canonical) choice of basis for the sublattice of the cone. In this case I think the best option would be to return with the cone also the matrix of the transformation, perhaps only when requested explicitly, `K.solid_restriction(transformation=True)`, and this matrix will be identity in the solid case.
