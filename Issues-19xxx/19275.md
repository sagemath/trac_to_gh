I have added the corner case.
Also, I realized it should return a empty list, instead of a list that contains a empty set.

Yea, that is better.

In a related issue; I tried the following ways to naturally create an empty matroid:

```
sage: Matroid()
...
UnboundLocalError: local variable 'M' referenced before assignment
sage: Matroid([])
...
ValueError: min() arg is an empty sequence
sage: Matroid(groundset=[], bases=[])
...
ValueError: min() arg is an empty sequence
```
You might want to consider changing things so that these could give you an empty matroid. Also, is this correct?

```
sage: M = Matroid(Graph()); M
Regular matroid of rank 0 on 0 elements with 1 bases
sage: list(M.bases())
[frozenset()]
```
(All of that is another ticket.)

However, this worked:

```
sage: Matroid(matrix([]))
Linear matroid of rank 0 on 0 elements represented over the Rational Field
```
Could you use that for the test since it uses the top-level interface?
