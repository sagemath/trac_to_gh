We implement the cactus group *J*<sub>n</sub> (of type A). The cactus group has important applications in category and representation theory.

This group is not available in GAP as far as I can tell.

I asked Peter Tingley, who asked Joel Kamnitzer, and they do not know of a normal form.

What I ended up doing on this ticket is just iterating over the ambient group J<sub>n</sub> and returning the element in the kernel.

What might work is a kind of argument one sees for presentations of soluble groups, where one has commutator relations, allowing one to "sort" generators in words; but as we have S_n acting, unsolvable for n>4...


I am guessing it would be too much to ask for a Garside-type structure coming from the projection onto S<sub>n</sub>, where every element can be written as `xy^k` where `x` is the natural section of S<sub>n</sub> and `y` is some special element in J<sub>n</sub> (similar to a normal form for the braid group elements, where `y` corresponds to the section of the long element).

Are you thinking that there might be reduced expressions which require using the `x^2 = 1` identity to add letters temporarily to get between them for n > 4?

I'm also emailing Joel and Peter about possible assistance we might get from geometric information.

I don't see an immediate connection, as the presentation there seems to include more relations, of the form `(xy)^m=1` ?

Anyhow, it might be quite hard to prove that an f.p. group is linear --- you probably heard the story of braid groups in this respect...

A Garside-type structure would not work here because that is used for passing from the braid monoid to the braid group. So I really don't think this will work for the cactus group.

According to R. Scott's paper [Right-angled Mock reflections and mock Artin groups](http://www.ams.org/journals/tran/2008-360-08/S0002-9947-08-04452-8/S0002-9947-08-04452-8.pdf), the cactus group is a special case of the presentation in that paper.

Yea, but here I think we are closer to the Coxeter group than the braid group (and even have a representation to test). Yet, I do agree that this could be a hard thing to prove.

I forgot to mention it, but thank you Darij for testing it and the example showing my proposed normal form won't work.

Daan Krammer has constructed an analogue of the Tits representation for the cactus groups.
He proves this is faithful. The preprint version is:

https://arxiv.org/pdf/0708.1273.pdf

[You need to leave out the six term relations.]

Is there a class for permutation representations of a finitely presented group?

I implemented the action on highest weight words in the tensor power of a crystal many years ago
(using the Henriques-Kamnitzer definition).
