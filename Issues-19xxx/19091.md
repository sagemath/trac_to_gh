I fixed a bug in mwrank reported by William Stein and Jen Balakrishnan.
Before:

```
sage: "Warning" in mwrank("[0, 0, 0, -532, -4374]")
True
```
and

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve( [0, 0, 0, -532, -4374])
sage: E.rank()
!!! n3 = 5 not a power of 2, rounding up to 8
Unable to compute the rank with certainty (lower bound=1).
This could be because Sha(E/Q)[2] is nontrivial.
Try calling something like two_descent(second_limit=13) on the
curve then trying this command again.  You could also try rank
with only_use_mwrank=False.
...
RuntimeError: Rank not provably correct.
```

I have made a new eclib release, available at [http://homepages.warwick.ac.uk/staff/J.E.Cremona/ftp/progs/eclib-20150827.tar.bz2](http://homepages.warwick.ac.uk/staff/J.E.Cremona/ftp/progs/eclib-20150827.tar.bz2) and the branch does the necessary stuff in Sage.

After:

```
sage: "Warning" in mwrank("[0, 0, 0, -532, -4374]")
False
```

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve( [0, 0, 0, -532, -4374])
sage: E.rank()
Unable to compute the rank with certainty (lower bound=1).
This could be because Sha(E/Q)[2] is nontrivial.

```

This may not look good, but mwrank is unable to compute the rank in this case since there 2-Selmer rank is 3 while the Mordell-Weil rank is in fact 1 (as can be checked independently, either by computing the analytic rank:

```
sage: E.rank(only_use_mwrank=False)

```
or by using 3-descent -- not available in Sage, sadly.
