but that's what spkg-check already does, no?

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash

if [ "$SAGE_LOCAL" = "" ]; then
   echo >&2 "SAGE_LOCAL undefined ... exiting";
   echo >&2 "Maybe run 'sage -sh'?"
   exit 1

cd nauty*

# runalltests doesn't exit with a zero status.
# So we check $fails instead.

$MAKE checks
source ./runalltests

if [ "${fails}" -ne "0" ]; then
   echo >&2 "Error checking nauty."
   exit 1

Now the gihub repo has the 26b17 updates over the version 25r9 we have (and which is the current publicly available version)
You can take a look at a long diff...

I've tried. The relevant diffs would be between 26b17 and your repository, but I can't figure out how to do that in github (the main problem is that 26b17 doesn't seem to be available in your repository).

26b17 is the 2nd commit, 25r9 is the 1st commit.
Diff is too big to be viewed online, thus check the repo out and do `git diff HEAD^`
I'll mention this in `SPKG.txt`.

the relevant license file is in `nauty-h.in`.
Just make sure that whenever you pour over the next nauty release, the relevant part of the file containing the  license stays intact.
Suggestions how to make this foolproof are welcome. But releases are not frequent at all, so I am not worried.

there is no "my" branch. The repo is the released version 25r9 patched by 26b17.

The git repo in question should be in https://github.com/sagemath and not in https://github.com/dimpase
