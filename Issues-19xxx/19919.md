For the record, does he know that is completely pointless since the nauty-in-Sage gives everybody permission to copy the code under the weaker license?

there is no official tarball of this version available (we got the tarball by email), and the licence is in a .in file to be run with the tarball.

26b17 is the 2nd commit, 25r9 is the 1st commit.
Diff is too big to be viewed online, thus check the repo out and do `git diff HEAD^`
I'll mention this in `SPKG.txt`.

the relevant license file is in `nauty-h.in`.
Just make sure that whenever you pour over the next nauty release, the relevant part of the file containing the  license stays intact.
Suggestions how to make this foolproof are welcome. But releases are not frequent at all, so I am not worried.

there is no "my" branch. The repo is the released version 25r9 patched by 26b17.
