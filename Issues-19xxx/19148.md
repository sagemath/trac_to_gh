Sometimes in the code we found

```
from foo cimport bar
from foo import bar
```
or

```
cimport foo
import foo
```
Do you know if there is (there was) a reason to do that? You removed one instance of that in `sage.libs.ecl`.

Well, I assume there once was a reason to do that in earlier versions of Pyrex or Cython. However, I don't know of any reason to do it *currently* (except for `numpy`, the Cython interface doesn't cover everything).
