Reported on [this ask question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/29797/non-negative-integer-relations-on-vertices/):

```
sage: vertices = [(1,1,-1,-1,-1),(-1,-1,1,1,-1),(1,-1,-1,-1,1),(-1,1,1,1,1),(1,-1,1,-1,-1)]
sage: p = LatticePolytope(vertices)
sage: lattice_polytope.positive_integer_relations(p.vertices().column_matrix())
TypeError: unable to make sense of Maxima expression '"Problemnotfeasible!"' in Sage
```

Note that there is a non-negative nontrivial integer relation:

```
sage: p.vertices().column_matrix().right_kernel()
Free module of degree 5 and rank 1 over Integer Ring
Echelon basis matrix:
[1 1 1 1 0]
```

Timing against what? The old code crashes on most examples...

The new version obviously has a different return type.

There is also some helper Maxima method that can be removed if it is not used anymore.

Timings against the old code are indeed irrelevant - that was just something that I managed to get into a working code back when I was young ;-)

Right. Fixed.

The example provided in the doc is:

```
      sage: points = [(1,1,-1,-1,-1), (-1,-1,1,1,-1), (1,-1,-1,-1,1),
      ....:           (-1,1,1,1,1), (1,-1,1,-1,-1)]
      sage: positive_integer_relations(points)
      [(1, 0, 0, 1, 0)]
```

Could you explain how `(1,1,-1,-1,-1) + (-1,1,1,1,1) == 0` ?

The result should be `[(1, 1, 1, 1, 0)]`, see the ask question for the expected answer.

Given a list of tuples, is it more natural to interpret it as a list of vectors, or as a list of rows of a matrix whose columns are vectors ? We might argue that the doc says that the points "are given as columns of a matrix". But when the doc writes `points = [(1,1,-1,-1,-1), (-1,-1,1,1,-1), (1,-1,-1,-1,1), (-1,1,1,1,1), (1,-1,1,-1,-1)]`, should the user consider this as a natural way to define the vectors `[(1, -1, 1, -1, 1), (1, -1, -1, 1, -1), (-1, 1, -1, 1, 1), (-1, 1, -1, 1, -1), (-1, -1, 1, 1, -1)]` ?

It could be even worse if the user explicitely writes `points = [vector([1,1,-1,-1,-1]), vector([-1,-1,1,1,-1]), vector([1,-1,-1,-1,1]), vector([-1,1,1,1,1]), vector([1,-1,1,-1,-1])]` so that no ambiguity appears on her side, but the first line of the code `M = matrix(points)`, silently forgot all this information.

Good point. The old code would break right away on anything but the matrix and it looked at first as a good idea to have matrix constructor built in, but apparently it is not.

Interestingly, it is not used anywhere in Sage (I thought that somewhere in toric code it may be handy) but I am pretty sure I used it at some point in my worksheets.
