Reported on [this ask question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/29797/non-negative-integer-relations-on-vertices/):

```
sage: vertices = [(1,1,-1,-1,-1),(-1,-1,1,1,-1),(1,-1,-1,-1,1),(-1,1,1,1,1),(1,-1,1,-1,-1)]
sage: p = LatticePolytope(vertices)
sage: lattice_polytope.positive_integer_relations(p.vertices().column_matrix())
TypeError: unable to make sense of Maxima expression '"Problemnotfeasible!"' in Sage
```

Note that there is a non-negative nontrivial integer relation:

```
sage: p.vertices().column_matrix().right_kernel()
Free module of degree 5 and rank 1 over Integer Ring
Echelon basis matrix:
[1 1 1 1 0]
```

See also #19367, which however I think is, if not orthogonal, at least not spanned by this question.

Why wasn't this triggered in the old code?

I suggest you run some timing on this code too, and see what it reports when there isn't a relation, etc.  I wonder why this non-generic code was used?

The new version obviously has a different return type.

There is also some helper Maxima method that can be removed if it is not used anymore.

Timings against the old code are indeed irrelevant - that was just something that I managed to get into a working code back when I was young ;-)

The example provided in the doc is:

```
      sage: points = [(1,1,-1,-1,-1), (-1,-1,1,1,-1), (1,-1,-1,-1,1),
      ....:           (-1,1,1,1,1), (1,-1,1,-1,-1)]
      sage: positive_integer_relations(points)
      [(1, 0, 0, 1, 0)]
```

Could you explain how `(1,1,-1,-1,-1) + (-1,1,1,1,1) == 0` ?

The result should be `[(1, 1, 1, 1, 0)]`, see the ask question for the expected answer.

Given a list of tuples, is it more natural to interpret it as a list of vectors, or as a list of rows of a matrix whose columns are vectors ? We might argue that the doc says that the points "are given as columns of a matrix". But when the doc writes `points = [(1,1,-1,-1,-1), (-1,-1,1,1,-1), (1,-1,-1,-1,1), (-1,1,1,1,1), (1,-1,1,-1,-1)]`, should the user consider this as a natural way to define the vectors `[(1, -1, 1, -1, 1), (1, -1, -1, 1, -1), (-1, 1, -1, 1, 1), (-1, 1, -1, 1, -1), (-1, -1, 1, 1, -1)]` ?

It could be even worse if the user explicitely writes `points = [vector([1,1,-1,-1,-1]), vector([-1,-1,1,1,-1]), vector([1,-1,-1,-1,1]), vector([-1,1,1,1,1]), vector([1,-1,1,-1,-1])]` so that no ambiguity appears on her side, but the first line of the code `M = matrix(points)`, silently forgot all this information.
