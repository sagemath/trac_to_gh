Some code in `LinearCode.py` is quite old and/or slow, and could be optimized.
This tickets proposes a faster implementation for `__eq__` and `dual_code` methods.
It also removes a lot of commented debug lines.

<a id='comment:2'></a>Let `C` be a linear code with `H` a parity check matrix of `C`. The generator matrix of `C`'s dual is `H`. I made changes in `AbstractLinearCode`'s `dual_code` method to use that property instead of the old implementation and got something faster.

I also rewrote `AbstractLinearCode`'s `__eq__` which is now less heavy and a bit faster.

Finally, I removed a lot of old debug prints that were still present in this file as commented lines.

This is now ready for review.
