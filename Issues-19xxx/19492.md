Some code in `LinearCode.py` is quite old and/or slow, and could be optimized.
This tickets proposes a faster implementation for `__eq__` and `dual_code` methods.
It also removes a lot of commented debug lines.

Let `C` be a linear code with `H` a parity check matrix of `C`. The generator matrix of `C`'s dual is `H`. I made changes in `AbstractLinearCode`'s `dual_code` method to use that property instead of the old implementation and got something faster.

I also rewrote `AbstractLinearCode`'s `__eq__` which is now less heavy and a bit faster.

Finally, I removed a lot of old debug prints that were still present in this file as commented lines.

This is now ready for review.

The following would be cleaner on two lines.

```

```
Otherwise it looks good.

Thanks for your input.

I changed the code to what you suggested. I also fixed a silly copy-paste mistake two lines below the one you mentioned.

print " t = ",t," , v = ",n," , k = ",w," , lambda = ",wts[w]*binomial(w,t)/binomial(n,t)
