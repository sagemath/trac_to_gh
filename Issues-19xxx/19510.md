<a id='comment:11'></a>Reviewed the code (without its dependency #19521) and the documentation, but did not yet verify the final output of the doctests. I had to modify the "constant factor" in order to get rational coefficients when `k-1` is not a square.

I am not happy with the growth group of the output:
- `(e<sup>(n*log(n)))</sup>(Symbolic Constants Subring)` will never occur.
- `log(n)^(Symbolic Constants Subring)` will never occur.
- `(e<sup>n)</sup>(Symbolic Constants Subring)` is hard to read; actually, the only exponential factor that will ever occur is `(k<sup>k/(k-1)</sup>(k-1))^n`, so `FractionField(k.parent())^n` would be enough (so `QQ^n` in all examples). However, it is not clear to me how to implement this without pain.
