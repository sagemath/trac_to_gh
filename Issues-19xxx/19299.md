As reported in [this sage-devel thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/hbF_0XVpq_k) the product of elements of a cartesian product are very slow

```
sage: X = cartesian_product([IntegerModRing(2)] * 8)
sage: A = X.addition_table() # very very long
```
One problem is the default implementation of `cartesian_factors` for element of such product provided by `sage.categories.sets_cat`

```
def cartesian_factors(self):
   # TODO: optimize
   return tuple(self.cartesian_projection(i) for i in self.parent()._sets_keys())
```
An other one is that `OperationTable` is using a lookup in a tuple with `.index()` rather than using a hash table (e.g. with a `dict`). We fix those two issues and obtain a dramatic speedup:

Before

```
sage: X = cartesian_product([IntegerModRing(2)] * 8)
sage: %time A = X.addition_table()
CPU times: user 12.4 s, sys: 32 ms, total: 12.5 s
Wall time: 12.4 s
```
After

```
sage: X = cartesian_product([IntegerModRing(2)] * 8)
sage: %time A = X.addition_table()
CPU times: user 644 ms, sys: 48 ms, total: 692 ms
Wall time: 604 ms
```

Could you see if this is enough speedup for your purpose?

Hello !

The speedup is cool indeed, thanks! My constructions are still very slow but while I was trying to figure out why exactly I noticed that `Graph.complement` was rather slow too. I'll finish that and get back to the constructions, to this patch and to my slow code.

Yo !

My graph generation is still slow, but 10 seconds for a 1024-nodes graph is, well, not as bad as some gap-based construction.

I could save a couple of seconds on the graph side, however, but that would require some rewrite of the dense graph backend. I'll get to that.

Is there any reason why you stored the dictionary as a parameter of `self`? I added a small commit on top of yours at u/ncohen/19299 which avoid lambda functions. It also removes the caching of the dictionary, but if you really think it can be useful, well, that can be reverted.

Thanks,

Nathann

I do prefer your version!

An index attribute might be useful for the method `OperationTable.__getitem__`. But as it is not used intensively for building the table I did not touched it.
