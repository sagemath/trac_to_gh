The following crashes Sage

```
sage: from sage.libs.ppl import Variable, Constraint_System, MIP_Problem
sage: x = Variable(0)
sage: y = Variable(1)
sage: cs = Constraint_System()
sage: cs.insert(x + y <= 2)
sage: MIP_Problem(2, cs, 0)
...
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred in Sage.
```
If we replace `0` by `x` or `y` it also crashes... but with `x-x` or `x+y` or `x+0`it is fine!

This is just a problem of types.
