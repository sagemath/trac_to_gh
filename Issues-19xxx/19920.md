This is a pretty simple bug report:

```
sage: matrix.ones(10).apply_map(lambda x:int(1))
TypeError: base_ring (=<type 'int'>) must be a ring
```

It looks a bit 'forced' when you specify 'int' directly, but it works without it from the inside of a .py file.

We also fix

```
sage: import numpy
sage: matrix([[numpy.int8(1)]])
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: unable to find a common ring for all elements
```

Yepyep. Even without the 'R='. Clearly it is not a big problem, for me at least. I just thought it might be worth fixing. I am actually surprised that 'apply_map' seems to guess the ring differently from the matrix constructor, e.g. the following works:

```
sage: matrix([[int(1)]])
[1]
```

Helloooooooooo !

Thanks for the branch. It seems to do the job well, though the patchbot reports several broken doctest.

And I will use the matrix constructor and apply_map a bit more carefully, now that I know that they create several copies of the data in the process of deducing the ring.
