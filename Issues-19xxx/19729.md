Replying to [@kiwifb](#comment%3A9):
> I thought latest upstream was `7.4.2` not `7.2f` or is there a particular reason to stick to the `7.2` series?

It's not really clear what upstream considers the most recent version. The website [http://www.hboehm.info/gc/](http://www.hboehm.info/gc/) has the following statement:

> Currently a fairly recent stable version is gc-7.2f.tar.gz. A later version is available as gc-7.4.2.tar.gz.

Regardless, the main reason for this ticket is #19701 and version 7.2f seems to work for that. There seem to be non-trivial changes to gc-7.4.x such as a new dependency.
