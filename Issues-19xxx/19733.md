In Cython, you cannot do

```
cdef class Foo:
    __str__ = whatever
```
and expect it to work.

I asked upstream about this: [https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/cython-users/aE7Tn-XLZnI](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/cython-users/aE7Tn-XLZnI)

---

When deriving a `class` (not `cdef class`) this kind of assignment suddenly works::

```
cdef class Base(object):
    def my_str(self):
        return "good"
    __str__ = my_str

class Derived(Base):
    pass
```
gives

```
sage: str(Base())
'<_home_jdemeyer__sage_temp_tamiyo_8430_tmp__MunIM_spyx_0.Base object at 0x7fb54ae544d0>'
sage: str(Derived())
'good'
```

This also explains why the `__len__ = cardinality` in `src/sage/rings/finite_rings/finite_field_base.pyx` works. It doesn't work on the level of `sage.rings.finite_rings.finite_field_base.FiniteField`, but it works at the level of the actual finite field classes (which are Python classes).
