<a id='comment:4'></a>Some minor comments:
* ` _new_uninitialized_matrix` should probably be called `_new` (or `_new_c`...), since these are the names most other `Elements` use (including `Matrix_double_dense` — only `Matrix_integer_dense` calls this method `_new_uninitialized_matrix`);
* `Matrix_generic_dense.__init__`: “we affect” should probably be “we assign”
* (`Matrix_generic_dense.__init__`: I find the new logic a bit hard to follow, but I didn't try to simplify it)
