Interesting patch. Whoever does the maintenance in Gentoo has not been inspecting the makefile to closely in the latest bump. I see that threaded versions using boost libraries are also available and you have patched them too even so we don't build this (or have a full boost) at the moment. In the future probably should go back to using `install` (with proper options) instead of `cp`.
