<a id='comment:1'></a>Kevin, what you think about "Relations are also often called intervals."? I would say that every comparable element pair *defines* an interval, not that it *is* an interval. Actually the name of `intervals()`/`relations()` could be `comparable_pairs()`, or even not-yet-implemented `chains(size=2)`. But maybe that would go too far.

But should we deprecate `intervals`, as it does not return intervals but a pairs of elements?

I don't think relations are often (or ever) called intervals. So deprecate that, but maybe add a docstring comment to `relations()` indicating that the number of relations is the number of intervals, and is thus the dimension of the incidence algebra. 

Not especially a fan of `comparable_pairs()`, just because technically speaking pairs are unordered, and we care about the order of the pair. I also don't think `chains(size=2)` would be a good option, either.

The way that I think of posets (and the way the poset constructor thinks of them) is that you have data of a ground set and relations, and how all of that data interacts makes a poset structure. Things like chains and intervals are properties of the entire poset structure, whereas relations are an individual piece of the defining data.
