As reported in [[#19249 comment:6](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/19249#comment:6)] the function `Graph.treewidth` makes an incorrect assumption by extending the current 'cut' with vertices adjacent to it only. 

It is fixed by this branch.

Simple patch that does the job. For me the patch is good to go.

Let's hope we will have other methods to compute treewidth soon ;)
