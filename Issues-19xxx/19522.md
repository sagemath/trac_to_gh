Aaaaaaaaand as this trick is pretty unknown, some advertisement cannot hurt `:-)`

If the constraint that the variables should be nonnegative is not necessary in the LP you change, then our problem has a trivial solution.

There are frequent cases in which it is valid. Let us say that you have many variables `x[v]` and that you want to minimize their maximum. Then you can do this:

```
p.set_objective(p['max'])
for v in g:
    p.add_constraint(x[v] <= p['max'])
```
