If "the syntax" often yields ugly code, then perhaps "the syntax" shouldn't be illustrated as much.

There are frequent cases in which it is valid. Let us say that you have many variables `x[v]` and that you want to minimize their maximum. Then you can do this:

```
p.set_objective(p['max'])
for v in g:
    p.add_constraint(x[v] <= p['max'])
