Hellooooo Jeroen,

This look good to me, but could you say why you replace exmples which use the "p[x]" variables with examples that do not use this trick? It was added because it is useful, from time to time, when instead of needing a 'dictionary' of variables you just need 'one' specific variable. With this trick, you avoid needing to create a dictionary that you wouldn't use much otherwise.

Aaaaaaaaand as this trick is pretty unknown, some advertisement cannot hurt `:-)`

There are frequent cases in which it is valid. Let us say that you have many variables `x[v]` and that you want to minimize their maximum. Then you can do this:

p.set_objective(p['max'])
