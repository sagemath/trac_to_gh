The primary goal of this ticket is to improve the creation speed for the quantum Bruhat graph. We do this in a number of ways:

- Better management of data associated to `lattice.nonparabolic_positive_roots`.
- Implement a (temporary) cache of the lengths of elements.

In addition, we also provide some general speedups to all matrix groups and Coxeter groups that came from looking into the above improvements. The net result is over 12x speedup of the creation of the quantum Bruhat graph:

```
sage: W = WeylGroup(['D',5], prefix='s')
sage: %time G = W.quantum_bruhat_graph()
CPU times: user 14 s, sys: 60.6 ms, total: 14 s
Wall time: 14 s
```
whereas previously this took over 3 minutes to compute. The downside is this has a larger memory footprint because of the temporary cache, but repeatedly computing the lengths of the elements was far too expensive.

This also includes a speedup of iterating over the entire Coxeter/Weyl group.

sage: WC = CoxeterGroup(['D',4]) # base_ring=UniversalCyclotomicField()
sage: %timeit L = [x for x in WC]

1) What is a quantum Bruhat graph, and where can I read about it?

2) Have the indirect doctests from `_finite_recognition` been salvaged?

Also, when changing DiGraph, can you please add the right format in analogy to https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/6cb47c00ca2315caf9b873506a0ea167d6706c41 ? Thank you!

It is the usual Bruhat poset but with added "quantum" edges that are used for many purposes. One particular use in Sage is for specializations of Macdonald polynomials at `t=0`. See, e.g., 

- http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.2042
- http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.2203
- http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.00465

> 2) Have the indirect doctests from `_finite_recognition` been salvaged?


Not exactly, but essentially the same tests in `recognize_coxeter_type_from_matrix` in `sage.combinat.root_system.coxeter_matrix`. So I would say everything is covered.

> Also, when changing DiGraph, can you please add the right format in analogy to https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/6cb47c00ca2315caf9b873506a0ea167d6706c41 ? Thank you!


Technically I didn't change the input for the digraph, but I can add it in if you're not going to make other additions.

Added. The `__matrix` was just duplicating what `matrix()` already does and resulted in quite a big speedup to iteration (it cut it in half IIRC).

With #19825 and my recent changes, it just takes 4 seconds on my laptop to iterate over D<sub>5</sub>. Now the biggest speed gain (about 2.5s) will be in improving matrix multiplication over the UCF, as opposed to speeding up the comparisons (about 1.5s)

One takeaway message: if you are working in a simply-laced type for `CoxeterGroup`, use `ZZ`.

Or more generally a crystalographic type, I assume?

No, it only works for simply-laced types as the `cos(\pi / m)` needs to be rational:

```
sage: W = CoxeterGroup(['B',2])
sage: W.gens()
(
[           -1 E(8) - E(8)^3]  [            1             0]
[            0             1], [E(8) - E(8)^3            -1]
)
```

I also added my datapoint for #9285, but it seems infeasible at this point using `CoxeterGroup`. The majority of the time is spent looking through the descents, which has to be done for keeping the constant memory iteration.

Moreover, a non-trivial amount of time is spent gathering the information to run the check for descents:

```
So there is definite room for optimization, but it would likely lead to some code duplication. I think Florent's parallelization of `SearchForest` and its move to the cython file will help a fair amount. Similarly, we could cythonize `MatrixGroupElement_generic` and its superclass `MatrixGroupElement_base`. We also get a bit of a penalty for the indirection (I implemented `has_right_descent` instead of `has_descent`).

However, this data will be rendered obsolete in a moment because I will be pushing a specialized version of `descents` and `first_descent`.

`@`chapoton I haven't looked too closely at the changes to #11010, but I do suspect it will improve things there.

`@`stumpc5 In case you didn't catch it, Jeoren had mentioned on sage-release that you will need to run `make distclean && make` for the version bump to `7.0.beta2` (which is why I haven't bumped yet from `7.0.beta1`).

`@`all At some point we should all sit down and port everything that we need from GAP3 to GAP4/sage/separate-library. Although that could likely be quite a project for any one particular package...

Yep, realized that after compiling for a few hours.
