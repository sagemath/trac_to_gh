Cross-review...ok.

> 1. `growth_group.combine_exceptions`: missing INPUT and OUTPUT blocks


Added.

> 2. Why is the default category now a monoid instead of a group?


A monoid is all what is needed to make the asymptotic ring a ring. Of course usually this will be a group to allow inversions in the ring, but as a minimal requirement, we have Monoids()

`elif` forgotten in the line following this. Rewritten completely.

No point; changed. (I think this changed at some point and was forgotten)

Removed (this was planned to be done on #19083).

Ok, this explains why a `GenericGrowthGroup` is only a monoid.

The derived classes `MonomialGrowthGroup` and `ExponentialGrowthGroup`, however, will be groups in many cases.
Perhaps this can be resolved in or after #19083.

I reworded that and added further doctests.

However, the helper functions only need the keys, I added a commit to do so.

Please cross-review my changes and add item 2. to the TODO list of #19083 or, alternatively, open a ticket for that.
After that, consider this to be a conditional `positive_review` from my side, conditional on #18182.

Ok. Added it as a work issue on #19083.

Corrected PEP8.

Thanks.

> Please cross-review my changes and add item 2. to the TODO list of #19083 or, alternatively, open a ticket for that.
> After that, consider this to be a conditional `positive_review` from my side, conditional on #18182.


Everything done.
