The use of `CFF` in `oeis.py` has been fixed already (see the header of the file), so no problem here.

It is indeed a duplicate of #20012. However this latter has been closed and does not take into account the commit about latex of this ticket, i guess this macro should be removed once we remove the deprecation warning, so let us not forget about that in one year.
