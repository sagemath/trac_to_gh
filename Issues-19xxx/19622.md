We add some magic to the Sage setup scripts such that `OptionalExtension`s whose package is not installed automatically raise an user-friendly exception:

```
sage: G = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: G.automorphism_group(algorithm='bliss') 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
PackageNotFoundError                      Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-2-8e034558a836> in <module>()
----> 1 G.automorphism_group(algorithm='bliss')

/usr/local/src/sage-config/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/graphs/generic_graph.pyc in automorphism_group(self, partition, verbosity, edge_labels, order, return_group, orbits, algorithm)
  20062             if edge_labels:
  20063                 raise ValueError("bliss cannot be used when edge_labels is True")
> 20064             from sage.graphs.bliss import automorphism_group
  20065 
  20066             A = automorphism_group(self, partition)

PackageNotFoundError: the package 'bliss' was not found. You can install it by running 'sage -i bliss' in a shell

See `PackageNotFoundError` in `src/sage/misc/package.py`.

> As an artificial example, print "Aarghs!" after division by zero.

That's a different question since `ZeroDivisionError` is a builtin Python exception which we cannot just change. That's the advantage of using a custom exception class for `PackageNotFoundError`: you can easily change the string which is displayed.

Now, you can probably still play with IPython to customize displaying of exceptions in general, but then that's a very different story.
