We add some magic to the Sage setup scripts such that `OptionalExtension`s whose package is not installed automatically raise an user-friendly exception:

```
sage: G = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: G.automorphism_group(algorithm='bliss') 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  20062             if edge_labels:
  20063                 raise ValueError("bliss cannot be used when edge_labels is True")

  20065 
  20066             A = automorphism_group(self, partition)

PackageNotFoundError: the package 'bliss' was not found. You can install it by running 'sage -i bliss' in a shell

What would you propose as user interface for customizing the message?

For command line it could be a `$SAGE_ROOT/messages.conf`, by default a symlink to `/etc/sage/messages.conf`.\n\nWhen this error happens the system should try to open `$SAGE_ROOT` for writing. If it can, then the message would be \"...install with sage -i...\". If not, it would open `$SAGE_ROOT/messages.conf` and print out the content. If that would not exists, then the default message would be something like \"...ask your system administrator to...\".\n\nRationale: Let's say we have users `root`, `teacher` and `user`. If `user` installs it, it would be used only for him/her. If `root` install, it will be on `/usr/local/...` and when installing new version the symlink would still point to same help text file. If `teacher` installs, and ask students to run `~teacher/sage/sage`, he/she must manually make the configuration file after every reinstall.",

Replying to [@jdemeyer](#comment%3A13):

> What would you propose as user interface for customizing the message?

SageNB already has Settings-tab when logged in as admin. For command line it could be a `$SAGE_ROOT/messages.conf`, by default a symlink to `/etc/sage/messages.conf`.

When this error happens the system should try to open `$SAGE_ROOT` for writing. If it can, then the message would be "...install with sage -i...". If not, it would open `$SAGE_ROOT/messages.conf` and print out the content. If that would not exists, then the default message would be something like "...ask your system administrator to...".

Rationale: Let's say we have users `root`, `teacher` and `user`. If `user` installs it, it would be used only for him/her. If `root` install, it will be on `/usr/local/...` and when installing new version the symlink would still point to same help text file. If `teacher` installs, and ask students to run `~teacher/sage/sage`, he/she must manually make the configuration file after every reinstall.

See `PackageNotFoundError` in `src/sage/misc/package.py`.

That's a different question since `ZeroDivisionError` is a builtin Python exception which we cannot just change. That's the advantage of using a custom exception class for `PackageNotFoundError`: you can easily change the string which is displayed.

Now, you can probably still play with IPython to customize displaying of exceptions in general, but then that's a very different story.
