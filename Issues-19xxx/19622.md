We add some magic to the Sage setup scripts such that `OptionalExtension`s whose package is not installed automatically raise an user-friendly exception:

```
sage: G = graphs.PetersenGraph()

See `PackageNotFoundError` in `src/sage/misc/package.py`.

> As an artificial example, print "Aarghs!" after division by zero.

That's a different question since `ZeroDivisionError` is a builtin Python exception which we cannot just change. That's the advantage of using a custom exception class for `PackageNotFoundError`: you can easily change the string which is displayed.

Now, you can probably still play with IPython to customize displaying of exceptions in general, but then that's a very different story.
