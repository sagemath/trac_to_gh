We add some magic to the Sage setup scripts such that `OptionalExtension`s whose package is not installed automatically raise an user-friendly exception:

```

SageNB already has Settings-tab when logged in as admin. For command line it could be a `$SAGE_ROOT/messages.conf`, by default a symlink to `/etc/sage/messages.conf`.

When this error happens the system should try to open `$SAGE_ROOT` for writing. If it can, then the message would be "...install with sage -i...". If not, it would open `$SAGE_ROOT/messages.conf` and print out the content. If that would not exists, then the default message would be something like "...ask your system administrator to...".

Rationale: Let's say we have users `root`, `teacher` and `user`. If `user` installs it, it would be used only for him/her. If `root` install, it will be on `/usr/local/...` and when installing new version the symlink would still point to same help text file. If `teacher` installs, and ask students to run `~teacher/sage/sage`, he/she must manually make the configuration file after every reinstall.
