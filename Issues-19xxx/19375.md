We have

```
sage: E = CombinatorialFreeModule(ZZ, [1,2])
sage: F = CombinatorialFreeModule(QQ, ['a', 'b'])
sage: cartesian_product([E, F])
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: 'CommutativeAdditiveGroups.CartesianProducts_with_c' object has no attribute 'FiniteDimensional'
```
The error message does not say what is going on.
