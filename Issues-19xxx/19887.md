Angelos Koutsianas has written code to solve general 3-term S-unit equations over Q, i.e. to find all solutions to x+y=1 where x,y are rationals supported on the primes in a given finite set S.  This is based on de Weger's thesis.

The code is currently being tested, and will be made into a new branch here.
