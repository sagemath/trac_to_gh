cause it takes `IntersectionGraph` of relatively few sets on a much bigger set; e.g. for q=5 we work in the set of over 3000 elements (lines of GQ(5,25)), and take 378 subsets, each of size 26, there.

Whether (or rather, how) this can be made more efficient is a good maths research question :-)

It is not a GAP script, it is a GAP function. If you know other ways to define a new GAP function within Sage library code, pray tell me how to do it. Apart from it, I only know `eval` functions (libgap/gap), which are much uglier. 
I hope you don't want me to replace what I have with a sequence of `libgap.eval...`.
(Hint: `libgap.function_factory` was created for a reason...) 

There ways for doing this with C/C++ (in Cython files you can do something like `cdef extern from C-source-file.c"), but it's because they have to be compiled. Whereas GAP functions are interpreted. 

If you really want I can move computations of e and nu over to Python.

Consequently you must use it right now, in this patch, for whatever you want to do with it? Fuzzy logic.

What I mean is that there are apparently some mathematical computations tht you do not know how to perform with Sage only. If there is no way to do it in Sage directly, do you think there could be a way to add those features to Sage (calling gap in the background)?

e and nu are no variables of your gap script, so I do not understand.

Nothing fuzzy - it's the right tool for the job. You don't know a better one, right? In fact many functions in this file would've become much cleaner, had I known about it then...

>

yes, I do know how to do them in Sage, in C, or on a Turing machine if I must...
But it's suboptimal, for reasons of efficiency, and of the code length.

> If there is no way to do it in Sage directly, do you think there could be a way to add those features to Sage (calling gap in the background)?

Well, every time I talk to you guys about a graph backend that can do things with symmetric graphs as good as GRAPE does it in Sage, I don't hear cheers and screams "yes, let's do it!" I rather hear "hmm, how do we remove an edge then" or something equally compelling...

I still think it would be great for this (SRGs) project to have such a backend. But not on this ticket...

Okay, before anything let's be clear: I won't give a review to this patch if it injects 10 lines of GAP code. Perhaps you will find somebody who will, but I will not. Now let us discuss.

It may be a necessary tool for libgap, and I quite agree that this function is necessary. I claim that it is not necessary here, and in particular that the mathematical features you need from gap should not be called *directly* from gap, and that we should instead expose in the Sage mathematical objects those features from GAP that you need. 

This code could then be Sage/Python code that calls other Sage/Python functions. Those other functions may have reasons to rely on this `function_factory` function, or they may not. I have absolutely no idea a priori, and neither do I have any objection to that a priori.

We try to build a software that can handle all kind of maths. If you must inject GAP code to get it to do what you want, then it means that we should expose some feature somewhere. At least that's how I interpret it.

> Well, every time I talk to you guys about a graph backend that can do things with symmetric graphs as good as GRAPE does it in Sage, I don't hear cheers and screams "yes, let's do it!" I rather hear "hmm, how do we remove an edge then" or something equally compelling...

I don't feel guilty of not writing your code for you.

On the other hand, I have to admit that I still do not know what you exactly want this backend to be. So no, I don't feel terribly overjoyed when you answer my "you code is ugly" remarks with "it's because we don't have a backend for symmetric graphs".

Which, again, would not simplify in any way your need for GAP code injection.

GAP error reporting is pretty good. (Jeez, people, try GAP once, don't be lazy :-)). Plus, you can debug a GAP function in GAP, as a GAP function, while debugging the above `libgap...()....`-Python (or `gap...()) code is a nightmare, cause GAP errors aren't well-reported then.

Has it ever crossed your mind that strings are Sage objects, too? Every piece of code is a string, you know...
By the way, I wrote that `libgap-`code, and it did cost me some grey hair, as opposed to the GAP
code you are objecting to on very unclear grounds.

I claim that it is not necessary here, and in particular that the mathematical features you need from gap should not be called *directly* from gap, and that we should instead expose in the Sage mathematical objects those features from GAP that you need. 

No, we don't need to force objects to cross the still nontrivial Sage/GAP border unnecessarily. There is absolutely no reason for this piece of GAP code, that takes a number as an input, and returns a graph, to expose its finite fields and matrix groups guts to Sage, for this exposure does not benefit anything here, it only degrades the performance.

You might see that the code already calls a !Sage/Python function, which relies on this `function_factory` function. In that sense we are already here, and I don't see what you're trying to tell me here.

yes, we create graphs in GAP, and copy them into Sage, completely ignoring the underlying symmetries. Instead, we could be using GRAPE/GAP Graph as a backend.  We could be handling sufficiently symmetric dense graphs on 10000 vertices with ease.
E.g. with GAP/GRAPE it takes about 3 sec to create the graph on the ticket for q=13, it's 15386 vertices...
(testing adjacency is still instant, by the way)

No, I honestly do not understand what you are trying to say. 

You seem to be saying that I should write some amazing and huge piece of code that would then make the code one would write on this ticket more acceptable for you. 

You also seem to be saying that I can use `function_factory` on one hand, but I cannot using it one the other hand. 

You also seem to be saying that you fear and distrust GAP code (despite using GAP left and right in your work...).

None of this makes any sense to me.

As to really "Sage proper", no, it would require much more work, basically taking an algorithm from GRAPE/GAP and reimplementing it. (why reimplementing, see (*) below).

As you see, GRAPE's Graph is very similar to Sage's construction of a graph given by a set V of vertices and a 2-variable function that tells edges from non-edges, but doing this modulo a group G acting on V (and respecting the edges, of course). That is, you only need to check adjacency per orbital of G (i.e. an orbit of G on VxV), not per each pair of vertices. And once you know these, you can use the group to generate (or just to decide - GRAPE does not generate the graph edges) adjacency of the rest.

So by far the hardest part would be code to construct orbital representatives for a permutation group (G,V) in the right way (not in the naive way of just computing orbits of G on VxV and taking representatives of these, for this is too slow and memory-hungry). 

(*) While it might be tempting to use GRAPE to do this job, it's not clear how to design a clean interface, as the function to be used by GRAPE to decide adjacency is a GAP function, and I don't know how to create GAP function that will call a Sage function (there are no callbacks implemented in (lib)GAP, that is).

Can't we ask GAP to give us a representative per orbit, assuming they have a smarter implementation?

Talking about the code on this ticket, 
yes, you can extract this information from GRAPE's Graph data structure.  And? Why is this any better than letting GAP/GRAPE do the whole job of building the adjacencies? Mind you, this is one GAP call: `List([1..OrderGraph(G)],x->Adjacency(G,x));` in the last line of the GAP function before `end;`. Besides, in GAP I directly work with matrix groups, while in Sage these are a bit brain-damaged, and this would mean I would need to do stuff like

```
    W=libgap.FullRowSpace(libgap.GF(q), m)  # F_q^m
    B=libgap.Elements(libgap.Basis(W))      # the standard basis of W
```
and express vectors I need as linear combinations of elements of B, and not in a natural way, just by coordinates.

Be sure that I only asked you to remove them in cases where it was an appalling waste of time.

I still remember something like `Graph([V,lambda e:G1.has_edge(e) and G2.has_edge(e)])`.

I was trying to see how we could have a constructor of the form `Graph([a_group,a_set,a_function])` that would use the symmetries to not call the function too often. If we can ask GAP to give us representants of the orbits of (u,v) under G, then we could only call our function on those pairs and compute the orbits of the actual edges.

Because you cannot give GAP a Sage function. You can give the `a_group` to GAP, or give it `a_set`, but I do not think that you can give it `a_function`. Thus having those representants would enable us to write this constructor in Sage, a bit better than it is possible now. If we can give everything to GAP and get the result back then, then it is probably better indeed.

Somewhat surprisingly, there is no separate functionality in GAP for this; the only place
you get it is in GRAPE's Graph.

Perhaps there should be (actually, I just opened a [GAP issue](https://github.com/gap-system/gap/issues/437) on this), but at the moment there is none.

As I already explained in comment 46, I'd also need to work around shortcomings of matrix groups and GAP vectors dealt with this way, and this is really ugly and fragile boilerplate. E.g. I'd need to do something like

```    
W=libgap.FullRowSpace(libgap.GF(q^2), 3)
B=libgap.Elements(libgap.Basis(W))
...

v=e*B[0]+B[1]+B[2]  # (this order! B[0]=[0,0,0,..,1], B[1]=[0,0,..,0,1,0],...)
```
So the correctness of this actually relies on B being ordered in this particular way, and can be nuked by a major GAP release quite easily.

While in GAP it is just

```
...
v:=Z(q)^0*[1,1,e];

Considering the function, I don't think that you will detect the difference in running time. It is probably possible, though probably a bit ugly as we would have to catch the exception raised by GAP and check that the error message is what we expect.

Yo,

> I don't actually know how to deal with creating an exception from a libgap function returning `fail`.

If you start the GAP function without the package installed, I think you'll get an exception.

> It can be converted to Sage's `bool` just fine, and the previous version (in public/19661 branch) did  `bool(libgap.LoadPackage(...))` and raised an exception based on its result. I don't know the rationale behind this changed to using `is_package_installed`.

Because that's how it is done everywhere else. I don't care much about the 'if', I just thought that it would make sense to say "install this package" right after having checked that the package was installed.

> I can install a GAP package directly into SAGE_LOCAL, and this would work with `libgap.LoadPackage(...)`, but won't work with `is_package_installed`.

I agree with whatever you just said, but in your original branch the error message was 'install gap_package', and that does not work at all with the case where the guy installed his own version of gap. Once you are set on which situations you want to deal with please change the exception to whatever you like.

The only thing is that if you want to advise the user to install 'gap_package', please do it with `PackageNotFoundError` for it generates the appropriate message automatically.

Well, I never said "own version of GAP". I said "own version of GRAPE". And 
`sage -i gap_packages` would do the job just fine.

Sure. By the way, how about promoting the GAP function wrapped in `function_factory` to a proper member of the module? It can then be doctested by itself, and it will be loaded only once, at import time.
