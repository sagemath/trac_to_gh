A few docs of underscore methods in /graphs are broken.
They can be found using

sage -docbuild -u -k reference/graphs html

Most of them are in schnyder.py, where doc needs a general clean-up.

Let us fix this and that.

You are free to think so, but by not reviewing it nothing gets solved. I expect a reviewer to discuss the implementation if (s)he does not like it.

So if you want to see this problem solved (a thematic index that stays up to date, no branch conflict when two guys update it simultaneously, and making sure that all functions appear in the index) you are quite welcome to review the ticket by saying what you do not like and how you think it should be done instead.

Otherwise, well. All we have is a 'needs_review' ticket that nobody likes.

And that will have to be rebased from time to time.
