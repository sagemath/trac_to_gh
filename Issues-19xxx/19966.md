<a id='comment:4'></a>Hi Travis,

I merged the latest development branch and made some changes to the documentation (including fixing some old errors of `littlemann` to `littelmann`).  If you agree with these changes, then you can set the ticket to positive review on my behalf.

Thanks for doing this!

Best,
Ben
