A grep of the word `deprecation` in the source code of `sage/combinat` indicates that there are many functions which have expired.  All warnings which were placed there with the intention of eventually removing them.  We will clean up some of this code and remove deprecations which have been in Sage for at least one year (the focus will be on those that have been merged since two years).

Code deprecated from:
- merged in sage-5.X: #8920 (5.8.beta2), #14140 (5.9.beta3), #14101 (5.12.beta4), #14496 (5.10.beta2), #14673 (5.10.rc1), #14772 (5.12.beta3), #14875 (5.13.beta0), #15142 (5.13.beta0), #15327 (5.13.beta3)
- merged in sage-6.X: #13872 (6.1.beta?), #15473 (6.1.beta?), #15882 (sage-6.2.beta?), #6637 (6.3.beta?), #16446 (6.3.beta?), #16472 (sage-6.3.beta?), #16553 (sage-6.3.beta?), #16933 (sage-6.4.beta?)

I will still have to go through the documentation and ensure that removed code does not appear there (this was just a first pass).

I just added a large number of people to the cc list hoping that they will all check that the code that they are responsible for deprecating really should be removed.

NOTE: whenever `deprecated_callable_import()` is used (as opposed to other kinds of deprecation), you should only remove the functionality from the global namespace but not remove it completely.

For example, `TransitiveIdeal` itself is not deprecated, it's just deprecated within `src/sage/combinat/all.py`. Especially since the deprecation warning says "This class soon will not be available in that way anymore", nothing indicates that the whole class will be removed.

I can restore it if you (or Nicolas or Florent) think that it should remain, however I was following the instruction:

```
-- Once the deprecation has been there for enough time: delete
-  ``TransitiveIdeal`` and ``TransitiveIealGraded``.
```
that was in the file.  Note that I did not delete `SearchForest` for that reason.

No, they were not. From #6637 (emphasis mine):

> 2. Deprecate `TransitiveIdeal`, `TransitiveIdealGraded` and `SearchForest` **as entry point**.

Those classes should have been deprecated in #16352, but they weren't.

That last commit was a merge with develop.

I'm not quite sure what should be done with the deprecated code in `words/alphabet.py` from #8920 since deleting that code raises unpickling errors.

We probably could setup a `register_unpickle_override` going to a slightly tweaked `OrderedAlphabet_backward_compatibility` to handle those old pickles.

1) Why are we deprecating `RestrictedPartitions`? From the way it looks, this functionality is not implemented elsewhere in its full strength (i.e., fixing both a set and a length).

3) I have just realized that `CyclicPermutations` of a multiset misbehave: e.g., the cardinality method is inherited from `Permutations` and thus disagrees with the list method. What should we do about this?

4) Another lost child:

```
sage: Permutations(["c","a","t"])[0]

sage: _ in Permutations()
False
```
(Yet, the class of `Permutations(["c","a","t"])[0]` inherits from `Permutations`.)

The deprecation warnings were only an indication that the function is being removed from the global name space since there were previously no deprecation warnings if you just imported the functions and started using them.

Yes.  I agree that both of these are problems.  I tested:

```
sage: len(CyclicPermutations(range(4)))==CyclicPermutations(range(4)).cardinality()
False
```
