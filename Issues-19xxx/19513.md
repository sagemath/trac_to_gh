A grep of the word `deprecation` in the source code of `sage/combinat` indicates that there are many functions which have expired.  All warnings which were placed there with the intention of eventually removing them.  We will clean up some of this code and remove deprecations which have been in Sage for at least one year (the focus will be on those that have been merged since two years).

Code deprecated from:
- merged in sage-5.X: #8920 (5.8.beta2), #14140 (5.9.beta3), #14101 (5.12.beta4), #14496 (5.10.beta2), #14673 (5.10.rc1), #14772 (5.12.beta3), #14875 (5.13.beta0), #15142 (5.13.beta0), #15327 (5.13.beta3)
- merged in sage-6.X: #13872 (6.1.beta?), #15473 (6.1.beta?), #15882 (sage-6.2.beta?), #6637 (6.3.beta?), #16446 (6.3.beta?), #16472 (sage-6.3.beta?), #16553 (sage-6.3.beta?), #16933 (sage-6.4.beta?)

-1 to this ticket. There is no reason to just remove all deprecations like that. Those deprecations *may* be removed, that's true. But does this imply that it's the right thing to do? Not always. I doubt that any one person really understands all the deprecated code in Sage and you obviously should not remove deprecations that you don't understand.

Besides that, this ticket is simply too broad. If you want to remove specific deprecations, just remove those. But not all at once.

Fair enough. At least `sage/combinat` merits a bit of cleanup and I do know something about those deprecations.

I will still have to go through the documentation and ensure that removed code does not appear there (this was just a first pass).

I just added a large number of people to the cc list hoping that they will all check that the code that they are responsible for deprecating really should be removed.

split_nk.py and choose_nk.py are in ticket #18674

Replying to [@tscrim](#comment:10):

No, they were not. From #6637 (emphasis mine):

> 2. Deprecate `TransitiveIdeal`, `TransitiveIdealGraded` and `SearchForest` **as entry point**.

>
>   B. `TransitiveIdeal` and `TransitiveIealGraded` **are used** in the code of `sage/combinat`, `sage/categories` and `sage/groups` at least. These should be updated to use `RecursivelyEnumeratedSet` for speed improvements and also to avoid issues explained in C below. See #16352.

Those classes should have been deprecated in #16352, but they weren't.
