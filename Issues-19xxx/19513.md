A grep of the word `deprecation` in the source code of `sage/combinat` indicates that there are many functions which have expired.  All warnings which were placed there with the intention of eventually removing them.  We will clean up some of this code and remove deprecations which have been in Sage for at least one year (the focus will be on those that have been merged since two years).

Code deprecated from:
- merged in sage-5.X: #8920 (5.8.beta2), #14140 (5.9.beta3), #14101 (5.12.beta4), #14496 (5.10.beta2), #14673 (5.10.rc1), #14772 (5.12.beta3), #14875 (5.13.beta0), #15142 (5.13.beta0), #15327 (5.13.beta3)
- merged in sage-6.X: #13872 (6.1.beta?), #15473 (6.1.beta?), #15882 (sage-6.2.beta?), #6637 (6.3.beta?), #16446 (6.3.beta?), #16472 (sage-6.3.beta?), #16553 (sage-6.3.beta?), #16933 (sage-6.4.beta?)

No, they were not. From #6637 (emphasis mine):

> 2. Deprecate `TransitiveIdeal`, `TransitiveIdealGraded` and `SearchForest` **as entry point**.

Those classes should have been deprecated in #16352, but they weren't.

The deprecation warnings were only an indication that the function is being removed from the global name space since there were previously no deprecation warnings if you just imported the functions and started using them.  I restored a comment that `TransitiveIdeal` and `TransitiveIdealGraded` do need to be deprecated.

Yes.  I agree that both of these are problems.  I tested:

```
sage: len(CyclicPermutations(range(4)))==CyclicPermutations(range(4)).cardinality()
False
```
