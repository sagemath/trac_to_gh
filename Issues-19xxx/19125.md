As reported on [https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/nion2hqoKbE/E8Kd5OFSEAAJ](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/nion2hqoKbE/E8Kd5OFSEAAJ) we get the wrong result:

```
sage: var('a b c x y')
sage: eq1 = y == a*x+x^b
sage: eq2 = b == c/2
sage: eq3 = c == a^2
sage: eq1.subs_expr(eq2.subs_expr(eq3))

__main__:1: DeprecationWarning: subs_expr is deprecated. Please use substitute instead.
See http://trac.sagemath.org/12834 for details.
1/2*a^2 == 1/2*c
```
This result is consistent with

```
sage: eq2.subs_expr(eq2.subs_expr(eq3))
```
which is indeed what the code currently effectively does. This affects any (nested) deprecated method lookup at the moment, so needs to be fixed ASAP.

In any case, the code proposed at least should ensure that results are not changed by wrapping, even if name printing is not entirely reliable.

The other changes are fine with me.
