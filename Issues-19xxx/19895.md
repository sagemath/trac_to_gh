This ticket extends `sage.misc.lazy_list` by the following:

- Sublists `dropwhile` and `takewhile` (similar behavior as those in the `itertools`; we share the same cache).

- Simplify code in `__repr__` and allow custumization.

- Creating sublists/slices of derived instances (e.g. if there is a class `Z` inheriting from `lazy_list_generic`, then now a slice of an instance of `Z` can now be an instance of `Z` as well.

- Improve documentation

- Various smaller code improvements and simplifications.

Note: This is also meant as a preparation for (infinite) homogenous sequences #19896.

Depends on #16137

```
#empty_lazy_list = lazy_list_generic(initial_values=[],
#                                    start=0, stop=0, step=1)  # ... does not work
```
which is commented since it does not work. The following workaround is used:

```
empty_lazy_list = lazy_list_generic.__new__(lazy_list_generic)
empty_lazy_list.start = 0
empty_lazy_list.stop = 0
empty_lazy_list.step = 1
empty_lazy_list.cache = []
...
```
It simply sets all the attributes manually. Commenting in the "direct command", one gets

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
  File "/local/dakrenn/sage/7.0.beta3/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/combinat/words/morphism.py", line 144, in <module>
    from sage.misc.lazy_list import lazy_list
ImportError: cannot import name lazy_list
```
Any ideas? (But I am happy with any solution; deleting the commented-out lines as well)

Hello,

This does not look like an improvement to me. Lazy lists aimed to be **simple**. You are introducing nine new attributes. If you want a `fancy_list`, just inherit.

On the other hand, you can make only one object for `dropwhile/takewhile`. It is not good to multiply the number of classes in this file. I am already not happy that we have 4. I am also not happy with the fact that `start` might change. Could you make this computation in the constructor of `dropwhile` and avoid complicating the code of the generic list?

What is the usecase of `dropwhile/takewhile` that would not be taken care with `itertools.dropwhile` or `itertools.takewhile`?

Hello Vincent,

Not so good ;) So we need to discuss...

> Lazy lists aimed to be **simple**.


Ok. What exactly does simple mean for you? I ask, because it makes difference if simple means only a few methods and little code or something else. What I think: lazy lists are meant as flexible data structures to be used in various other classes (words, sequences, species, lazy power series, ...). Thus there should be some flexibility and freedom.

> You are introducing nine new attributes. If you want a `fancy_list`, just inherit.


I am afraid it is not that easy. The new attributes for formatting should provide a way to easily change the appearence of the representation string, e.g. for words (no idea if there is a plan to use this) this could be `word: 10111010100...`. Concerning sequences: the existing `Sequence`-class for finite sequences offers a way to add a newline after each comma in the formatting; this should be possible with the `HomogenousSequences`, which are in fact lazy lists, as well. Special sequences (and words as well) might have a name: `fibonacci sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, ...`.
However, I can think of alternative ways to implement these formatting features. What comes in my mind right now would be a formatting function, to which these attributes can be passed. Thus they don't have to be stored in the class, and one can change them by overriding `_repr_`, but still get the advantage of not needing to write the full similar code every time. What is left of these formatting attributes in the class would be the `name` attribute only.
Since I want to do slicing in inherted classes correctly (i.e. a slice of a `HomogenousSequence` should again be a `HomogenousSequence` and not a plain `lazy_list_generic`) the attributes `cls` with the corresponding keywords are needed.

Concerning a class `fancy_list`: I do not see a point of having another class, which has the same technical functionality as `lazy_list_generic`, but only offers more possibilites to work with (like if needed changes its appearance). 

> On the other hand, you can make only one object for `dropwhile/takewhile`.


What is the disadvantage of having two classes? One class per Feature (and those two are distinct features, although their name does not reflect this) is usually a good design choice.

> It is not good to multiply the number of classes in this file. I am already not happy that we have 4.


Can you tell me why you are unhappy with 4 classes? I just see the advantage that separate features are into separate classes, which makes the code better read and understandable. (Indeed I needed a lot of time understanding the current generic class, which can track a master lazy list, do slicing and all the other basic stuff at once; however, I am now good with this design choice)

> I am also not happy with the fact that `start` might change. Could you make this computation in the constructor of `dropwhile` and avoid complicating the code of the generic list?


`stop` is already allowed to change, so why should `start` be not allowed to change? Indeed I thought about doing the computations in the constructor, but I believe this is not a desired feature. Because then something already happens, even if no element is accessed. The main advantage of having the iterator-like lazy lists is that elements are considered only if needed and not before.

> What is the usecase of `dropwhile/takewhile` that would not be taken care with `itertools.dropwhile` or `itertools.takewhile`?


Sharing caches (and other information). As I understand that's one of the main points of having lazy lists.

Looking forward to your answers/comments.

Best, Daniel

Hi Daniel,

Sorry for the long delay.

Simple for me means: few attributes and few methods. No room for customization. Changing the appearance of a lazy list is certainly useful but adding +5 attributes to **all** lazy lists is a big waste. However, I fully agree that a better representation code would be useful. What about writing a customizable method:

```
def str(self, prefix, start, max_nb_elements, separator, ...):
```
That would overload the class but **not** the objects. Hence a memory footprint close to zero.

I am against the multiplication of classes since this can go forever. I would be happier if each class would actually have concrete usecase (i.e. at least used in 2 other classes). Perhaps you have some in mind for `dropwhile`?

I (now) agree that adding a lot of attributes is a waste and I agree that a customizeable method is what fits better. I've refactored this part of the code into #21164.
(Note that I included a couple of small bugfixes in #21164 as well as they were fixed on the fly in the branch attached to this ticket here.)
