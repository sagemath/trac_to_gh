Hi, I think there has to be a change in line 77 here :
https://github.com/sagemath/documentation/blob/gh-pages/html/en/reference/graphs/sage/graphs/hyperbolicity.html

Should I send a PR on Github ?

No, all changes go through this trac system here. The documentation is embedded into SageMath's code and therefore it requires a change in the source code of the software. That way, we have doctests, etc.
