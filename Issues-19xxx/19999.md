Using `q^x` for negative `q` leads to errors.

```
sage: 1 + (-1)^x + (1/2)^x
```
gives

```
RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded in __instancecheck__
```
But

```
sage: (-1)^x + (1/2)^x + 1
1 + (-1)^x + (1/2)^x
```
works.

Thus make `q^x` and `(-q)^x` incomparable; also making cartesian products of growth groups fit to have lexicographic products of non-linear orders.

It seems that there is a problem with the comparison in these cartesian products of growth groups.

This might also cause this behavior:

```
sage: (-1)^x + O(1/x)
O(x^(-1))
```

I've tried to find the actual reason for this infinite loop. It turns out that the entire poset structure breaks down after inserting `(-1)^x`:

```
sage: ex = 1 + (-1)^x
sage: s = ex.summands; s
poset((-1)^x, 1)
sage: print s.repr_full()
poset((-1)^x, 1)
+-- (-1)^x
|   +-- predecessors:   1
|   +-- successors:   1
+-- null
|   +-- no predecessors
|   +-- successors:   1
+-- 1
|   +-- predecessors:   (-1)^x, null
|   +-- successors:   (-1)^x, oo
+-- oo

The problem is that, in general, `q^x` and `(-q)^x` can be compared in the sense of

```
sage: q^x <= (-q)^x and (-q)^x <= q^x
True
```

For example, the same problem occurrs here:

```
sage: print (2^x + (-2)^x).summands.repr_full()
poset((-2)^x, 2^x)
+-- (-2)^x
|   +-- predecessors:   2^x
|   +-- successors:   2^x
+-- null
|   +-- no predecessors
|   +-- successors:   2^x
+-- 2^x
|   +-- predecessors:   (-2)^x, null
|   +-- successors:   (-2)^x, oo
+-- oo
|   +-- predecessors:   2^x
|   +-- no successors
```

I see three possibilities (well, two proper ones...) to fix this. 

1. Making the (exponential growth) elements `(-q)^x` and `q^x` incomparable. (very simple)

2. The other (equally simple) option would be to check for `l <= r and r <= l` (in `le_lex` of `combinat/posets/cartesian_product.py`) after `l == r`, and then return `False` (this means that the poset sees the two elements as incomparable, when actually, they very well are comparable). This introduces inconsistencies (behavior in `QQ^x` vs. `QQ^x * x^QQ`...) and should probably not be implemented.

3. Refactoring parts of the `MutablePoset` such that it properly handles the case where some element can be the successor as well as the predecessor of another element simultanously. I'm not an expert regarding the code there, but I think that while this might be the "correct" solution, it is also the most complicated and it might also have a negative impact on the overall performance of the `AsymptoticRing` (which is, needless to say, bad).

Opinions?

For the sake of completeness: the fact that absorption does not work properly (`O(2^x)` should absorb both `2^x` and `(-2)^x`) speaks against the first option.

+1 for 1., since then the elements really build a poset.

It's not that nice to have both terms; however, I don't see a good way to fix this at the moment.

My impressions:

- Refactoring `MutablePoset` seems to be incorrect. We should make sure to have a poset when we call it a poset.

- Having `(-q)^x` and `q^x` incomparable is inconvenient, but no tragedy. (doubles the number of `O` terms, but I do not see other side effect)

I forgot that the proposed refactoring of `MutablePoset` would result in a structure that does not resemble a poset any more; thanks for the hint.

Therefore, as the resulting increased number of required `O`-terms is just inconvenient I've implemented option 1.

I believe the `-other.base` in

```
return bool(abs(self.base) <= abs(other.base)) and \
       bool(self.base != -other.base)
```
is not general enough (you could have complex bases as well).
Why not

```
bool(abs(self.base) < abs(other.base)) or bool(self.base == other.base)
```
?

Yep, I was thinking of reals a bit too much; I'll change the statement.
