Add a function to see if a poset is series-parallel (or "N-free").

First wait for #19659 to get closed. Series-parallel decomposition is just recursive applying of `connected_components()` and `ordinal_sum_decomposition()`.

Do we agree that being series-parallel is not at all equivalent to being prime in the sense of modular decomposition?

Arghs, `is_prime()` was not what I think. So maybe there is no direct function to wrap. But anyway, if `modular_decomposition()` ends "withot any Prime", then the corresponding poset is N-free.

Thanks for correcting.

"Horizontal decomposition", i.e. `connected_components()` is commutative, but "vertical decomposition" of course is not. But I guess we don't have a tree for this specific situation. Maybe Frédéric can comment on this.
