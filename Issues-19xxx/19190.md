I did some (additional) touchups to the finite lattice category and minor tweaks. While I still prefer <code>\`\`self\`\`</code> over `this lattice`, `the lattice` is not correct as there is not a unique lattice. If you agree with my changes, then go ahead and set a positive review.

<a id='comment:7'>**Comment 7:**</a>
In html documentation "See also: FinitePosets, LatticePosets, LatticePoset" the "LatticePoset" is a broken link. Where is it supposed to point?

About "the": I don't understand. For example docstring for `cardinality()` is "Return the number of elements in *the* poset." I have think that "the" means about same as "this" in that sentence.

Anyways, Sage with this patch is better than without, hence I mark this as *positive_review*.

Broken links are more general problem. Nathann give one suggestion at #20095, but that should be talked separately.

Trying to understand... There is no direct translation for a/an/the in Finnish.

I have learnt that if I say "Travis, open the window", it means that I have one specific window in my mind and I suppose that you also know what window I mean. "Open a window" means that there are several to choose one, and I don't care which one you open.

In "Return the number of elements in the poset." I suppose that it is clear what poset we are referring to.

I have absolutely zero understanding of Finnish (I don't think I've ever really encountered any before).

> I have learnt that if I say "Travis, open the window", it means that I have one specific window in my mind and I suppose that you also know what window I mean. "Open a window" means that there are several to choose one, and I don't care which one you open.

Yes, provided there is only one window we are discussing.

> In "Return the number of elements in the poset." I suppose that it is clear what poset we are referring to.

In a way, yes, but it is more precise to say "this poset" as there might be one more poset around (especially when there is another input of a poset).
