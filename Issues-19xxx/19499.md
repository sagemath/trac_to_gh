Hello Dima,

Though I can't really say why, the doctests do not pass because of some syntax error.

Also, I don't get why you put in graphs/generators/classical_geometries a function that returns matrices, and in strongly_regular_db.pyx the function that returns the graph.

Is there a reason to not merge mathon_pseudocylcic_merging_graph and mathon_graph_on_784_vertices?

I noted a 'preseerved' somewhere, and nothing else seems odd `:-)`

Nathann

Doctests do not pass because of the presence of `sage: sage:`

do you mean "orbit" when you write "orbital" ?

do you mean "cyclic" when you write "cylcic" ?

`orbital` is a standard term in the theory of permutation groups, meaning
the 0-1 matrix corresponding to an orbit of the group on 2-tuples.

> do you mean "cyclic" when you write "cylcic" ?

that's a misrpint...

as pointed out in comment #4, extra `sage:` in doctests... fixed in the latest commit.

> Also, I don't get why you put in graphs/generators/classical_geometries a function that returns matrices, and in strongly_regular_db.pyx the function that returns the graph.

the latter returns an s.r.g., and we have such functions in strongly_regular_db.pyx, no?
The former, hmm - well, it's a combinatorial object that can be described as an edge-coloured complete graph.

I can move it to combinat/matrices, but where? Or I can make it an edge-coloured graph. Both of these ways will need an extra code to get out the matrices then.

Anyhow, tell me what you like more (but don't ask me to start a new module for association schemes, not yet :-))


>

one is more general than the other, you can build other graphs using the former,
given the right input.

> 
> I noted a 'preseerved' somewhere, and nothing else seems odd `:-)`

fixed, too.

What I find weird is that you don't find the graph constructor worthy of appearing in the generator/ folder, though you put there something that does not even build a graph `:-P`

What about moving the graph constructor there, and consider the other function as a helper function (which can stay in the same folder, it's up to you)

HMmmmmmm... Well, I thought about this for a while and.... What about creating an association scheme module? `:-P`

It would be just a file somewhere, with your two functions `EllipticLinesProjectivePlaneScheme` and `mathon_pseudocylcic_merging_graph` only. A module's doc saying "This module gathers everything related to association schemes", and that's all? `:-P`

No big class, no nothing complicated, only those functions. As they would fit there much better than here `:-P`

a proper assoc. schemes module is a lot of work, as you could see by looking at
sect 11 of http://homepages.cwi.nl/~aeb/math/ipm/ipm.pdf --- which only scratches
the surface of this topic.
People would laugh at us if we created a module you propose...

Yeah yeah yeah, but I'm not asking for any large amount of work. Given that you write two methods which are related to association schemes and that we have nowhere to put them, I thought that creating a file with those two functions would be better.

Of course we couldn't say anything like "Sage supports associations schemes", but then we wouldn't have to keep those functions in the graph folder.

I am very well trained at answering people who laugh at other people's work.

it'd actually be just one function, `EllipticLinesProjectivePlaneScheme`, for `mathon_pseudocylcic_merging_graph` creates a (s.r.) graph, and functions creating srg's from stuff are normally in graphs modules...

For me, creating such a module would be a commitment to make it proper (for I know all too well what should be there), and I have too many of these already...
(Unless you feel an itch to partake, and in this case I'd go ahead with this...)

I can move the function there for you if you prefer. I don't take this as a commitment for anything: I barely know what an association scheme is, and every time I read the definition all I could think of is "who in their right minds would define something so contrained"?

as you can claim a bit of understanding of strongly regular graphs, you can say you understand a bit of assoc. schemes with 2 classes, too :-)

well, given that the complementary pair of s.r.graphs is an association scheme
with 2 classes, I don't quite follow your last comment :-)

It took off when people wanted to use orbitals to study permutation groups. Orbitals of a permutation group (0-1 matrices specifying the partition of the set of 2-tuples induced by the group action) define an object called, variously, coherent configuration, coherent algebra... Restricting to transitive groups, one has homogeneous coherent configurations, a.k.a. (non-commutative) association schemes. And then in several important cases one gets commutativity of these matrices, and thus the (usual) association schemes.
 
A bit later coding theorists wanted to use algebra to study codes, which are special kinds of cliques in Hamming (or Johnson) graphs.
But the distance k graphs, for all, k, of these graphs also form association scheme...

And so this was born...
