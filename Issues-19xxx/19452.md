The constructor of `PolynomialSequence` treats coefficient rings of characteristic 2 specially when really it should treat finite fields of characteristic 2 specially. As a result

```
PolynomialSequence(R, [])
```
will fail when `R.characteristic() == 2` but `R.degree()` is not defined. This happens in particular for infinite fields of characteristic 2.

The fix is to check whether R is a finite field and treat it generically if not.
