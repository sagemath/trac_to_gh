```
At the moment we have

```
sage: M.<n> = AsymptoticRing(growth_group='QQ^n * n^QQ', coefficient_ring=SR)
sage: (n.rpow(2)).parent()
Asymptotic Ring <QQ^n * n^SR> over Symbolic Ring
```
but the "nicer" and more expected result would be

```
Asymptotic Ring <QQ^n * n^QQ> over Symbolic Ring
```

This is a follow-up ticket to #19946.
