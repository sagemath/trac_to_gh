Hello Jori,

Here is a way to improve the algorithm a bit:

Let us say that a set `S` is "locally_minimal" if the join of the elements in `S` is different from the join of the elements in <any proper subset in `S`>. What you are looking for is the set `locally_mininal` set of maximum cardinality.

Why do you iterate on antichains? You iterate on antichains, because you know that in *any* "locally_minimal" set `S`, any 2-subset of `S` must be locally minimal. And the sets of locally minimal sets of cardinality 2 are precisely the antichains.

Why wouldn't you go further? Indeed, the same works for anything greater than 2: in any locally minimal set, *any* proper subset is also locally minimal.

Your implementation, however, does not use that. You test all antichains, but when testing those of size 5 you do not use the information obtained from those of size 4.

So here is a way out: enumerate all locally minimal sets directly, in increasing order of size. This can be done with `subsets_with_hereditary_property` [1], to which you can feed a function that detects if a given set of points is locally minimal (when you remove only one element).

This should do the trick, and *use* the information that <some given set of size 3 is not locally minimal> when trying to figure out one of size 4.

Note: It may be slower for small cases, but better above.

Additionally, your code may spend a lot of time hashing your elements: it may be better to work directly with the integer ID of the poset's elements (and to access the matrix directly).

Also, could you be a bit more formal in the definition of 'breadth'? I did not follow it at first (english is not a well-paenthesized language). It would also be cool if you could redirect toward a textbook/paper that defines it: I found it in "Semimodular Lattices Theory and Applications" where it is said to originate from "Lattice Theory" by Birkhoff.

OK... So you think something like

```
f = lambda ac: self.is_antichain_of_poset(ac) and self.join(ac) not in
  [self.join(set(ac).difference(set([e]))) for e in ac]
l = list(subsets_with_hereditary_property(f, self))
len(l[-1])
```

? Seems faster, but still stucks for 132-element `Posets.TamariLattice(6).canonical_label()`. Btw, what is faster way to iterate over "list `L` minus an element for every element"?

There is no need to check that it is an antichain. Also, if you do not write it as a lambda function you have more freedom and do not need to create sets at each test, test.

>btw, what is faster way to iterate over "list `L` minus an element for every element"?

What's wrong with `L[:i] + L[i+1:]` ?

If br(L)=4, there must be an antichain `A` of `4` elements with join `j`. Element `j` must cover at least four element. They can not be the set `A`. They can not directly cover `A`, because it is just impossible to make the lattice so that three element from `A` would not have meet `j`.\n\nSo to check take one element a time and try to put in as a `j` in this structure. If the element covers less than four element, it is not right one. If it does, take all four-element subsets of the lower covers of `j`-candidate. For those... somehow continue a-kind-of backtracking.\n\nWe can remove all doubly irreducible elements, as removing thme won't change the breadth, except from 2 to 1 in a diamond-like stucture.",

<a id='comment:10'>**Comment 10:**</a>
Here is, if I thinked this right, the smallest lattice with breadth 4:

```
n = 4
l = [[0,i] for i in range(1,n+1)]

l += [[i, i+n] for i in range(1,n+1)]
l += [[i, i+n+1] for i in range(1,n)]
l += [[n, n+1]]

l += [[i, i+n] for i in range(n+1, 2*n+1)]
l += [[i, i+n+1] for i in range(n+1,n*2)]
l += [[n*2, n*2+1]]

l += [[i, n*3+1] for i in range(2*n+1, 3*n+1)]

L = Poset(( [], l)).completion_by_cuts().canonical_label()
```

This is not easily generalized. `n=5` will not make a lattice of breadth 5.

However, can this be used as a part of test for a lattice to have breadht 4? If br(L)=4, there must be an antichain `A` of `4` elements with join `j`. Element `j` must cover at least four element. They can not be the set `A`. They can not directly cover `A`, because it is just impossible to make the lattice so that three element from `A` would not have meet `j`.

So to check take one element a time and try to put in as a `j` in this structure. If the element covers less than four element, it is not right one. If it does, take all four-element subsets of the lower covers of `j`-candidate. For those... somehow continue a-kind-of backtracking.

We can remove all doubly irreducible elements, as removing thme won't change the breadth, except from 2 to 1 in a diamond-like stucture.

Hello Jori,

Here is a first-pass review while on the bus.

- I was very surprised to see a 'distance' argument in the depth-first-search
  function. You do not compute the 'distance' when running a
  depth-first-search. At least not the usual notion of distance in graph
  theory. We should probably remove it, as it is *highly* dangerous to advertise
  it this way `O_o`

- In your code, please use breadth-first-search instead.

- Definition of 'elems': this line often test for containment in 'too_close'. Do
  not run containment tests in a list. use a 'set' for that: containment is
  faster.

- Anyway, you probably should do this differently, i.e. with
  `breadth_first_search(report_distance=True)` while filtering 'too close'
  elements according to their distance.

- I still believe that it would be faster to use
  'subsets_with_hereditary_property' inside of your code. It would also make the
  code slightly clearer, as the test you perfom on each antichain would be an
  independent function.

- Why do you deal with breadth 2 differently from the rest? That could mean a
  couple more operations, but compared to everything else that should not mean
  much.

Besides that, congratulations for this algorithm. It works, and it works well.

Nathann

For me the parameter name `distance` feels very clear. But could like also `max_depth`. I think that it is useful to have a function that tells for example to what cities you can reach using max three bus.

Why? Doesn't it use more memory?

I am not sure about that. If I am right, it will make all 2-element antichains, then all 3-element antichains and so on. There will be many of them, only one is needed. (But the one must be the right one, of course...)

> - Why do you deal with breadth 2 differently from the rest?

There was some complication with breadth 2. Maybe it is not needed now in the near-to-final version.

And then, this depends on what one is doing. I guess it makes no difference for a big lattice, but for `10^4` small it might be different thing.

> Besides that, congratulations for this algorithm. It works, and it works well.

And it is not the graph-theoretic distance in the graph, right? Plus there may be vertices at distance 2 from your start vertex that *never* get explored because you set distance=3. Do we also agree there? This is due to the fact that a vertex is at 'distance' k from the source vertex in a DFS if "there exists a path of length k from the source vertex to it" (possibly a *very long* path) and that if this vertex is once discovered at 'distance' 10 000 it may not be 'rediscovered' again at distance 2.

no reason to. It may be trigger additional copies of the 'queue' list (unless we implement a deque), but that's all. Additionally, if this cost worries you then you probably shouldn't use list-comprehension in your code `:-P`

> I am not sure about that. If I am right, it will make all 2-element antichains, then all 3-element antichains and so on. There will be many of them, only one is needed. (But the one must be the right one, of course...)

With your algorithm: if the antichain {a,b,c} is not "locally minimal", then your code will test all antichains which contain the antichain {a,b,c} too. With `subset_with_hereditary_property` it would be filtered out.

No. The vertex was not discovered at distance 10 000, because search in that path was stopped at distance 3.

Let us say that you have a path of length 10 on {0,1,...,9}, and that you add a path of length 3 from 0 to 1, i.e. {0,a,1}.

If you want all vertices at distance 2 through a DFS starting from 0, you may discover 'a' first (at distance 1) then 1 (at distance 2). You will not explore 2 (because it would be a distance 3).

When next you will test edge (0,1) and re-discover 1 (this time at distance 1), you will stop there because '1' has already been discovered.

Thus you will never discover vertex '2'.

If, on the other hand, the algorithm discovered 1 first, then you would proceed to 2 without any problem.

This is what is wrong.

True. Now I understand.

So vertices at exactly the limit distance should be handled differently. They must be on different list, from where they will be moved to "normal" `already_seen` list if they are re-discovered by smaller distance.

False. After

```
elems = [e[0] for e in H.breadth_first_search(j, neighbors=H.neighbors_in, report_distance=True) if e[1] > B-2]` 
```

it took about infinite time to compute breadth of `TamariLattice(6)`, whereas

```
too_close = set(H.breadth_first_search(j, neighbors=H.neighbors_in,  distance=B-2))
elems = [e for e in H.order_ideal([j]) if e not in too_close]
```

did it in 40 milliseconds.

Don't know. Please not that this code tries first with maximal breadth and then goes down one by one. subsets_with_hereditary_property would work to other direction. I guess that it will stuck with too many pairs, triples and so on.

True. This only slowed down the code like `sum(L.breadth() for L in L10)`, where `L10` is a list of 10-element lattices. And even it was very slight loss.

Anyways, I did some tests with product lattices and so. This code seems to be "fast enought". For example it takes 4,4 seconds to create a Tamari lattice, and 4,6 seconds to compute it's breadth. So this should not be a bottleneck.

I made an example of smallest lattice with breadth 4 with `completion_by_cuts()` and did not notice that the result was just `BooleanLattice(4)`. Oops.

And that means that my example of lattice with breadth 4 is stupid, as it hides the structure to dig6 string.
