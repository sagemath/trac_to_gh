* `cryptominisat`: crashes Sage on 32-bit.
* `lie`: a very arcane build process (copies over the complete build directory and requires `bison`).

That would be more of an upstream issue than changing around the `spkg-install` file, right?

However, note that the sources are in the author's literate programming system CWEBx, a clone of CWEB by Levy and Knuth. The fact that there is a tarball that does not need CWEBx is already great. I won't expect things magically changed to something even more Sage-compatible...

You can automatically set up a series of 32bit VM and build/test Sage there at http://sagebuilder.metelu.net/ which i used when there was not enough binary builds for Debian and Ubuntu.

The 4ti2-dependent functionality of sandpiles (the one the causes the test failures) is deprecated.
Fixing something that will be removed in half a year is a waste of time and effort.

I don't think we should demote 4ti2 to experimental  just because of this.

I see no reason to split it up. Are you even sure that there is a "library"? At least I know that Sage does not use any library.

I will send them a message and see what they say. However, I'm not sure we will necessarily receive a quick response, so I'm thinking we should start working on converting it to autotools.

What do you think about the `bison` dependency? Keep with the current concept of failing with an error message recommending the user install a system-wide `bison`?

At present, there isn't really a reason because we only have the interface in Sage. I'm somewhat planning on interacting with the algorithms in `lie` once more of #14901 is done, but I don't think that will happen until next year.

None of the above: it shouldn't be a build-time dependency.

Normally, `bison` is a packaging-time dependency, but not a build-time or run-time dependency (unless there are very specific reasons why this cannot work for `lie`).

Well, given that I was added to the Cc list unasked, I am somewhat irritated.

It seems not to be a general trac bug, so it is probably a setup issue. Is there a ticket for this issue, so that I don't have to hijack this one? (Of course, I cannot fix it, given that I'm not an administrator of the trac instance.)

BTW: I shouldn't have to create filters; this should be fixed by the tract instance admin.

For the record: I added you in CC because you reported a cryptominisat issue in the past, so I assumed that you were interested in cryptominisat.

It is perfectly acceptable among Sage developers to be CC'd on tickets without first asking.
As you appear to be knowledgeable about  `cryptominisat`, it was certainly done in good faith.

Maybe. Do you know how to fix it? I certainly don't.

> Is there a ticket for this issue, so that I don't have to hijack this one? (Of course, I cannot fix it, given that I'm not an administrator of the trac instance.)


I don't know. It's not hard to search Sage trac for specific tickets; please feel free to do so, and open a new ticket.

Please no! That would only make it worse.

The problem to be fixed is not that lie depends on bison, that's only a symptom. The real problem is the crazy build system.

`bison` is a small stable program, available for all platforms you can imagine. In this sense it's much easier than `autotools`.
