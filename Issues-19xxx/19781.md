The following optional packages are broken and should either be fixed or moved to experimental:

* `cryptominisat`: crashes Sage on 32-bit.
* `lie`: a very arcane build process (copies over the complete build directory and requires `bison`).

I have opened a ticket on this, #19783

`lie` just needs to be packaged properly using a real build/install system.

That would be more of an upstream issue than changing around the `spkg-install` file, right?

However, note that the sources are in the author's literate programming system CWEBx, a clone of CWEB by Levy and Knuth. The fact that there is a tarball that does not need CWEBx is already great. I won't expect things magically changed to something even more Sage-compatible...

I opened #19807 for the tides issue. I think i solved the problem on 64 bits (but please test it). Will try to look at the 32 bits problem in a VM.

The 4ti2-dependent functionality of sandpiles (the one the causes the test failures) is deprecated.
Fixing something that will be removed in half a year is a waste of time and effort.

I don't think we should demote 4ti2 to experimental  just because of this.

I see no reason to split it up. Are you even sure that there is a "library"? At least I know that Sage does not use any library.

I will send them a message and see what they say. However, I'm not sure we will necessarily receive a quick response, so I'm thinking we should start working on converting it to autotools.

What do you think about the `bison` dependency? Keep with the current concept of failing with an error message recommending the user install a system-wide `bison`?

At present, there isn't really a reason because we only have the interface in Sage. I'm somewhat planning on interacting with the algorithms in `lie` once more of #14901 is done, but I don't think that will happen until next year.

None of the above: it shouldn't be a build-time dependency.

Normally, `bison` is a packaging-time dependency, but not a build-time or run-time dependency (unless there are very specific reasons why this cannot work for `lie`).

Well, given that I was added to the Cc list unasked, I am somewhat irritated.

It seems not to be a general trac bug, so it is probably a setup issue. Is there a ticket for this issue, so that I don't have to hijack this one? (Of course, I cannot fix it, given that I'm not an administrator of the trac instance.)

BTW: I shouldn't have to create filters; this should be fixed by the tract instance admin.

It is perfectly acceptable among Sage developers to be CC'd on tickets without first asking.
As you appear to be knowledgeable about  `cryptominisat`, it was certainly done in good faith.

Maybe. Do you know how to fix it? I certainly don't.

I don't know. It's not hard to search Sage trac for specific tickets; please feel free to do so, and open a new ticket.

Given that Volker wants to release 7.0 since we are already at `7.0.rc0`, I don't think we would be able to autotoolize `LiE` in time. I really thought we would have more time...

`bison` is a small stable program, available for all platforms you can imagine. In this sense it's much easier than `autotools`.
