The macro `_signals` is defined in `interrupt_api.h` and also in Cython modules when cimporting `interrupt.pxd`. Since the includes are set up in the correct order, this does no harm, but it is better to fix this anyway.

Normally, the compiler warns about this, but Sage silences this warning with the `-w` option.
