Now, the closeness centrality algorithm simply calls the corresponding NetworkX routine (only for undirected graphs).

This ticket will move this routine to file generic_graph (closeness centrality is defined also in this case ![1]), and it will modify input/output variables as in routine shortest_path. Then, it will call our shortest path new routines instead of NetworkX routines.

This ticket is a first step towards the inclusion of the algorithm in ![2].

In the ticket description you say that you will move everything in `generic_graph`, but it might be more readable/clean to create a new file for centrality measures, no?
Also, you moved only references to the methods, right? (or the modifications are hidden in the merge with #18931).

Hello!

Thank you for the comment, I will try to address the main issues raised.

I have put everything in a single commit, which simply removes the closeness centrality routine from `graph.py` and rewrites it in `generic_graph.py`. Now the ticket should be much easier to review. Since closeness centrality highly depends on shortest paths, the new routine follows all conventions in ticket #18931.

About the creation of a new file: we already have file `centrality.pyx`, containing fast algorithms for betweenness centrality. However, these routines are called from a `centrality_betweenness` routine in file `generic_graph.py`, which should be used by the user. In this ticket, I just copied this policy.

In my opinion, if we want to create a new file, we should at least move also betweenness centrality and degree centrality: in my opinion, this goes beyond the scope of this ticket. Do you agree?

Best,

Michele

I assume you want first to have `v_vert = iter(list(vert))

The default of calling `distances = self.shortest_path_all_pairs(by_weight,algorithm, weight_function, check_weight)[0]` is that you get a dictionary of dictionary, that is a huge data structure for large graphs (lost of memory and long to create). At least the second part of this method should be cythonized to get the array of distances, as is done for `centrality_betweenness`.

In some cases a vertex can be a pair, and thus is iterable. This would react badly with this code.

```
sage: g=graphs.KneserGraph(5,2)
sage: v=g.vertices()[0]

Hello!

I hope you spent a great Assumption day!

With this new commit, (hopefully) I solved the problems with `v_vert`  and I cythonized the Johnson algorithm. In my opinion, it is not worth  cythonizing Floyd-Warshall, because it is much slower than Johnson,  especially on sparse graphs.

Thank you very much!

Hello,

I'm trying to understand the behavior of the method on digraphs.
You wrote that the centrality of vertices of degree 0 is not reported. Does it means that for digraphs you don't report the centrality of vertices with out-degree 0?
Also, what's the expected behavior on strongly connected digraphs?

David.

Hello!

I tried to improve the documentation, answering your questions.

Michele

Replying to [@dcoudert](#comment%3A13):

> You wrote that the centrality of vertices of degree 0 is not reported. Does it means that for digraphs you don't report the centrality of vertices with out-degree 0?

Yes, I changed in the documentation "degree" with "(out)degree"

> Also, what's the expected behavior on strongly connected digraphs?

The closeness centrality of a vertex v is 1/farn(v), where farn(v) is the average distance between v and a random vertex w different from v (as in the case of connected graphs). I added an example about this.

Yep, I add to `make doc-clean && make doc` to get it compiled.

I just saw in the doc of `centrality_degree` in `graph.py`, in section See also, that the link to `centrality_closeness` is broken. In fact, the code is <code>:meth:\`centrality_closeness\`</code>. Could you check that?
In fact we should also move this methode to `centrality.pyx`, but in another ticket.

After that I think it will be ok.

David.
