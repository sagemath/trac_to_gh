This rounding mode is "new" since MPFR 3.

Also use MPFR 3 names:
* `GMP_RNDx` -> `MPFR_RNDx`
* `mp_prec_t` -> `mpfr_prec_t`
* `mp_rnd_t` -> `mpfr_rnd_t`

RNDA is marked experimental in the MPFR manual, and Vincent Lefèvre recently insisted on mpfr-devel that it "is not part of the API" and "could disappear entirely without notice", so I'm not sure it is such a good idea to start supporting it unless we have a real use for it.

First paragraph of Section 4.4 (or just grep for "experimental").

Edit: oh, no, sorry, it *was* marked as such in the manual of MPFR 3.0, but that no longer seems to be the case with the current release. Well, then I don't know why Vincent said that.
