No need to change anything.

Just a few small comments:
1. is there any doctest or Sage interface to check that the package works?
2. replace `$SAGE_LOCAL/share` by `$SAGE_SHARE`.
3. add a file `build/pkgs/database_mutation_class/dependencies` (which could be just saying `# no dependencies`)

Thanks for checking.

1. Yes, but it wasn't very explicit. I made it more so.
2. Done.
3. Done. Is this a new thing? Most of the spkg folders don't seem to have one unless they have an actual dependency.

It's not a disaster. The default for optional packages is that they depend on every standard package. It's a safe default, but not really efficient, especially given that `sage -i` will install dependencies soon (#19101).

What is happening is that there is a test in one of the other files which saves some data to your `.sage` folder. This should fix things and isolates the tests specific to the database.

Christian, I'm cc-ing you in case you have any opinions on the name of the database (and to let you know that it is changing).

Isn't this actually a bug?

```
# random - depends on the data the user has stored
```
If `load_data()` returns essentially random data, how can it be useful?

It wasn't the test which was broken (hence, no need for `test_database`), the function itself was broken.

I think it's a bug that it *does* depend on that.

Anyway, I don't care much about this package. I will not set this ticket to needs_work for this, but I also won't set it to positive_review either.
