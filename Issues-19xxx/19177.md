Is there any place I need to change in the docs/scripts/etc. regarding the optional spkg name, or has that all become automated?

No need to change anything.

Just a few small comments:
1. is there any doctest or Sage interface to check that the package works?
2. replace `$SAGE_LOCAL/share` by `$SAGE_SHARE`.
3. add a file `build/pkgs/database_mutation_class/dependencies` (which could be just saying `# no dependencies`)

1. Yes, but it wasn't very explicit. I made it more so.
2. Done.
3. Done. Is this a new thing? Most of the spkg folders don't seem to have one unless they have an actual dependency.

It's not a disaster. The default for optional packages is that they depend on every standard package. It's a safe default, but not really efficient, especially given that `sage -i` will install dependencies soon (#19101).

# random - depends on the data the user has stored

If `load_data()` returns essentially random data, how can it be useful?

It wasn't the test which was broken (hence, no need for `test_database`), the function itself was broken.

I think it's a bug that it *does* depend on that.
