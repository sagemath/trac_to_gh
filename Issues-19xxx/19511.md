Hi,
I had a look at the code. It looks fine :-) I clarified some documentation wrt. alphabets and spaces, please look at that. I also fixed a bug in the while-loop for adding errors.

Apart from that I have a few questions/requests:
- Should this channel-intro text really be in the q-ary symmetric channels doc?
- Can you please make a test that input space is of the form Sigma^n, and that Sigma has random_element
- It would be nice with a "probability_of_exactly_t_errors" and a "probability_of_at_most_t_errors" method :-) But I don't insist for now, the channel is functioning as it is.

Best,
Johan

    "body": "<a id='comment:9'>Comment 9:</a>\nHello,\n\nThanks for your remarks!\n\nI agree with your clarifications, and of course with your fix.\n\n> Should this channel-intro text really be in the q-ary symmetric channels doc? \n\nWell, I did that in the case one reads only the documentation for a channel class, and not the abstract class one. If you think it's useless, I'm ok to remove it.\n\n> Can you please make a test that input space is of the form Sigma^n, and that Sigma has random_element \n\nDone. Note that I wasn't able to find an example of a Sigma which can be of the form Sigma^n\nbut can not have a `random_element` method... \n\n>It would be nice with a \"probability_of_exactly_t_errors\" and a \"probability_of_at_most_t_errors\" method :-) But I don't insist for now, the channel is functioning as it is. \n\nNo need to insist, it's done ;) These two methods can be called on any instance of the class, with `t` as parameter. Maybe it can be better to propose generic methods, which take `epsilon`, `t` and `input_space.dimension()` as parameters, so the user can actually look for the best epsilon without having to construct the channel...

Hello,

Thanks for your remarks!

I agree with your clarifications, and of course with your fix.

> Should this channel-intro text really be in the q-ary symmetric channels doc? 

Well, I did that in the case one reads only the documentation for a channel class, and not the abstract class one. If you think it's useless, I'm ok to remove it.

> Can you please make a test that input space is of the form Sigma^n, and that Sigma has random_element 

Done. Note that I wasn't able to find an example of a Sigma which can be of the form Sigma^n
but can not have a `random_element` method... 

>It would be nice with a "probability_of_exactly_t_errors" and a "probability_of_at_most_t_errors" method :-) But I don't insist for now, the channel is functioning as it is. 

No need to insist, it's done ;) These two methods can be called on any instance of the class, with `t` as parameter. Maybe it can be better to propose generic methods, which take `epsilon`, `t` and `input_space.dimension()` as parameters, so the user can actually look for the best epsilon without having to construct the channel... As you prefer.

Best,

David

Hi,

> Well, I did that in the case one reads only the documentation for a channel class, and not the abstract class one. If you think it's useless, I'm ok to remove it.

I don't think it belongs there. But the text is nice, so perhaps it can be moved/merged somewhere else?

> Done. Note that I wasn't able to find an example of a Sigma which can be of the form Sigma^n
> but can not have a `random_element` method... 

Hmm, I'm worried that the check for the "dimension" method is not the right thing to do. For instance, the following structure has a "dimension":

```
   X = CombinatorialFreeModule(QQ, [1,2])
```

But I think that the last line of your `transmit_unsafe` is going to blow up on this structure. I don't think there is a bullet-proof-while-flexible way of checking for what we want. So perhaps your check at construction time could be a dummy `transmit_unsafe` call, and if that throws an exception, catch it and throw another exception telling the user that apparently his input space is not satisfactory.

Another thing: you added some text saying "the input space has to be a vector space", but if `\Sigma` is not a field, then `\Sigma^3` is not a vector space: it is a free module with a basis. Just write something like I did in the docstring that we check input space has the form `\Sigma^n`.

> No need to insist, it's done ;) These two methods can be called on any instance of the class, with `t` as parameter. Maybe it can be better to propose generic methods, which take `epsilon`, `t` and `input_space.dimension()` as parameters, so the user can actually look for the best epsilon without having to construct the channel... As you prefer.

Cool! I think having them available only non-static, after construction is
completely fine. Your implementation of `at_most_t_errors` should sum over `exactly_t_errors` to avoid code-replication. I'm pretty sure you have an off-by-one error in the `exactly_t_errors` as well, since you're not summing the `t`'th error.

Best,
Johan

Just a simple question before working on this again:

That was actually my first idea , but then I thought it's basically calling a method inside a loop. 
Well, I know it's not much of an optimization, but calling a method is slower than evaluating of an expression, isn't it?
