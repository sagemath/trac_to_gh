```
sage: DiGraph({0:[3], 1:[2], 2:[3], 3:[4]}).edges()
[(0, 3, None), (1, 2, None), (2, 3, None), (3, 4, None)]
sage: DiGraph({0:[3], 1:[2], 2:[3], 3:[4], 0:[7]}).edges()
[(0, 7, None), (1, 2, None), (2, 3, None), (3, 4, None)]
```

I.e. adding `0->7` makes `0->3` to disappear.

<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

A `dict` is a mapping, so there can be only one value for each key.
