```
In SageMath 6.9.beta2:

```
sage: K.<z> = CyclotomicField(8)
sage: G = DirichletGroup(13, K)
sage: chi = G([z^2])
sage: chi.gauss_sum()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: Cannot coerce zeta52 into Cyclotomic Field of order 8 and degree 4
```
This arises because `chi` is actually defined over a smaller cyclotomic field.  It can be fixed by letting `gauss_sum()` minimize the base ring.

Depends on #19056

Keywords: **Dirichlet character Gauss sum**

Hmm. Precision seems too high to me.. Maybe 1e-15 would be better ?

and maybe replace the very small imaginary part in the doctest by 0.0*I ?
