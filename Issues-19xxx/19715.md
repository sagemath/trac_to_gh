ATLAS should just skip the "fast" option if it is not available:

```
Third attempt: use "fast" options.
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./spkg-install", line 526, in <module>
    rc = build(arch='fast')
  File "./spkg-install", line 454, in build
    rc = configure(arch, isa_ext)
  File "./spkg-install", line 254, in configure
    arch, isa_ext, thread_limit = configure_fast()
  File "./spkg-install", line 374, in configure_fast
    raise NotImplementedError('I don\'t know a "fast" configuration for your cpu.')
NotImplementedError: I don't know a "fast" configuration for your cpu.

If I remember correctly there is another issue with POWER8 and Atlas.
Configuration (or tuning, who knows) fails because there are too many registers on POWER8 !!!

See http://sourceforge.net/p/math-atlas/bugs/225/
Oh it was POWER7 already actually.
