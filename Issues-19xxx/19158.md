Ticket #19004 has the very user-unfriendly consequence that all old-style packages are effectively gone:

```
$ ./sage -i chomp
Attempting to download package chomp
Error: could not find a package matching chomp
       Try 'sage --package list' to see the available packages
       Did you mean: csdp, gmp, cbc, cmake, cvxopt?
```

Instead of removing support for old-style packages, we should deprecate them.

The mixture of old and new packages has always been broken. Let it die. We can support old packages as legacy but not mash it up with new packages in an utterly confusing manner to users.

(1) The chomp spkg actually doesn't compile with modern gcc due to tighter C++ checking

Agreed. But #19004 wasn't the right fix.

This ticket isn't about `chomp` at all, I'm just using that package as one example of an old-style package.

That's "you can" for a very dubious value of "can". To users, it really looks like the package is completely gone.

Sure, that's an easy change (although not very relevant if we merge #19105).

But I'm confused by your comment. Does it imply you're in favour of this ticket now?

Great! My last commit does that, since we no longer look for standard packages:

```
Attempting to download package python
>>> Checking online list of optional packages.
>>> Checking online list of experimental packages.
>>> Checking online list of huge packages.
Error: could not find a package matching python
       Try 'sage --package list' to see the available packages
       Did you mean: cython, ipython, python2, python3, patch?
