Ticket #19004 has the very user-unfriendly consequence that all old-style packages are effectively gone:

```
$ ./sage -i chomp
Attempting to download package chomp
Error: could not find a package matching chomp
       Try 'sage --package list' to see the available packages
       Did you mean: csdp, gmp, cbc, cmake, cvxopt?
```

Instead of removing support for old-style packages, we should deprecate them.

<a id='comment:2'></a>IMHO the only thing that needs to be done is make chomp a new-style package.

The mixture of old and new packages has always been broken. Let it die. We can support old packages as legacy but not mash it up with new packages in an utterly confusing manner to users.

(1) The chomp spkg actually doesn't compile with modern gcc due to tighter C++ checking

This ticket isn't about `chomp` at all, I'm just using that package as one example of an old-style package.

That's "you can" for a very dubious value of "can". To users, it really looks like the package is completely gone.

Great! My last commit does that, since we no longer look for standard packages:

```
Attempting to download package python
>>> Checking online list of optional packages.
>>> Checking online list of experimental packages.
>>> Checking online list of huge packages.
Error: could not find a package matching python
       Try 'sage --package list' to see the available packages
       Did you mean: cython, ipython, python2, python3, patch?
```

See #19220 for `TOPCOM`. That and `python` are the two serious problems with old-style packages, as far as I understand. Other old-style packages may be broken, but that's not new. I don't know of any other packages which will break the Sage installation if you try to install them.
