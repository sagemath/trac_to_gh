After upgrading MPIR, not all modules depending on MPIR are rebuilt. The offending modules are

```
sage/ext/interrupt/interrupt.so
sage/symbolic/substitution_map.so
sage/symbolic/constants_c.so
sage/symbolic/expression.so
sage/symbolic/getitem.so
```

The latter 4 are because `ginac.pxd` links against gmp, but there is no reason. The dependency was added in #8844 without apparent justification.
