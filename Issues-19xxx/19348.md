```
g1 = Graph({0: [1]})
g2 = Graph({'a': ['b']})
g1.edge_connectivity(value_only=False), g2.edge_connectivity(value_only=False)
```

should output `([1, [(0, 1)]], [1, [('a', 'b')]])`, but it does not look vertex labels at all.

Hello Jori,

Sorry but the "bug" is more in the boost function that in generic_graph.py. Otherwise we still have a function somewhere that takes a vertex-labelled graph as input and returns an integer-labelled answer.

Furthermore, it is in any case better if instead of having a doctest returning 'a' you just check that the vertex belongs to the graph: the answer 'b' would be valid too.

OK. I mark this as needs_work. (And let others to do it.)

> Furthermore, it is in any case better if instead of having a doctest returning 'a' you just check that the vertex belongs to the graph: the answer 'b' would be valid too.


Ah, then I misunderstood some documentation about this kind of functions.

Assuming for example that vertices are ASCII-strings, will `.vertices()` give them alphabetically?

Hello!

You are right: the edge connectivity is the first Boost algorithm I implemented, and I missed the vertex labels. Thank you very much for noting this.

Since I made the mistake, I think I should solve it: let me know if you like my solution. I replaced Jori's branch with a different one, that corrects `boost_graph.pyx` instead of `generic_graph.pyx`. I hope this is the correct procedure: if not, let me know!

Have fun!

Hello,

What is the point of making a dict to map `0, 1, 2, 3, ...` to Python objects? Use a list!

More precisely:
- A python object is a `PyObject *`
- A list or a tuple is a `PyObject **`
- A set/dict is a hash table
So you that you can not beat a Python list.

On the other hand, if you want faster access to `my_list[i]` you can have a look at [Cython  compiler directives](http://docs.cython.org/src/reference/compilation.html#compiler-directives).
