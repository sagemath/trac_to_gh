Add `-L$SAGE_LOCAL/lib` to `LDFLAGS` in `sage-env`

---

See #19782 for symlinking `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib64` to `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib` (which rather incidentally is *not* a prerequisite for adding just `-L$SAGE_LOCAL/lib` here).

Well I don't use any of this mechanic to install sage-on-gentoo. I have a very simple `sage-env` that I ship in `/etc` but it is nowhere like the beast in vanilla. It just mirrors `sage/env.py`. On Gentoo prefix on the other hand I believe everything is wrapped to add the equivalent of your `LDFLAGS` and probably `CPATH` (for include path) but I am not sure of the details, I would have to dig - my own preference would be to wrap `ld` but I give hashdist a patch to insert a rpath in gcc's spec [this is highly platform dependent, I gave them x86_64 and arm but my OS X patch is not complete].

On `gcc` installing in `lib64`, hashdist's gcc doesn't. gcc on my prefix on a linux x86_64 machine doesn't.
