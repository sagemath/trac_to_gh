Would checking the dimension of the ideal in the whole coordinate ring coincide with checking that the Segre embedding of the map is a projective morphism? It would be stricter than checking that the coordinates share no common zeros componentwise, right? Maps such as

```
T.<x,y,z,w,u,v> = ProductProjectiveSpaces([2,2],QQ)
H = T.Hom(T)
F = H([x^2*u,y^2*w,z^2*v,w^2,u^2,v^2])

wouldn't be considered morphisms with this check.

One solution that has come to mind is do something like define the subscheme of the productprojectivespaces for each set of coordinates of the map and check that there are no points on each such subscheme. Then we have a set of polynomials defined at every point in the product (the definition of a morphism)

For products of 2 projective spaces, the .dimension function works fine via segre embeddings, but calling dimension on the defining ideal for empty subschemes does not give the 'right' answer in products:

```
P.<x,y,z,u,v,w>=ProductProjectiveSpaces(QQ,[2,2])
H=End(P)
f=H([u,v,w,u^2,v^2,w^2])
m=0
for i in range(P.num_components()):
    t=P[i].dimension_relative()+1
    X=P.subscheme(list(f)[m:m+t])
    print X.defining_ideal().dimension(), X.defining_ideal().dimension() - P.num_components()
    print "dim:",X.dimension()
    m+=t    
```

at the moment segre embedding (and hence dimension) is only implemented for products of 2 projective spaces. It would be nice to get that to work in general, but maybe the solution for this particular function is to be dependent on the dimension function for subschemes and then improve the dimension function as part of a separate ticket.

What do you think?

Alright, here is a revision. While testing I found that the dimension function doesn't seem to work unless the base rings of the product spaces are fields:

```
P.<x,y,z,w,u> = ProductProjectiveSpaces([2,1],ZZ)
H = End(P)
f = H([x^2,y^2,z^2,w^2,u^2])
X = P.subscheme(list(f)[0 : 3])
X.dimension()
```

Is there any way around this?
