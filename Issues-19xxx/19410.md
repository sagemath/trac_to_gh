These are issues that were raised in #19370:

On OSX10.11 the Sage installation is not functional when moved to a different folder - `sage` must be executed in the original build-folder since many libraries have their complete path compiled in. The following changes seem therefore necessary:

   1) "sage --bdist" should build sage in the directory "/Application/SageMath?-$Version-..." and sage will only run in this directory.
   2) The README in the resulting app should be updated to say that the Sage icon should be dragged into the Application folder. Alternatively, we should implement an installer.
   3) sage should print a warning "This copy of sage can only be run in dirctory /Application/Sage?..." and exit.

The issue is not so much that the complete path are compiled in than setting `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` is not working as expected.

I think it is actually reasonable to ask the Sage Mac binary to run in this directory, just because Mac stuff is now getting more tightly locked down anyway... though it's still annoying because one might want it to run elsewhere.  Say, in a subfolder of `Applications`.

Also there is the `/Applications` versus `~/Applications` thing to wonder about in different settings where users might not have permission to install globally (maybe that's a problem? I don't have access to a machine like that though).

However, I think maybe it would be nice to only do this check for now when the OS is actually 10.11.
