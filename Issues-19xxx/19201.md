In `FiniteStateMachine.disjoint_union`, doctests had Automata with output letters.
Remove those output letters.

Furthermore, fix the labels of the states in the final example in order to be more robust with respect to random order of the states due to sets used in determinisation. Otherwise, a minor modification in #19199 would lead to other labels and breaking the doctest.
