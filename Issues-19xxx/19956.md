```
We have

```
sage: K = GF(2).algebraic_closure()
sage: a = K.an_element()
sage: hash(a)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: ...
```
and this prevent resultant computation of bivariate polynomials

```
sage: R.<x,y> = K[]
sage: x.resultant(y)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: ...
```

On the way we also provide a straightforward faster powering.

---

Just as a remark, the hash we had in sage-6.8 was **completely** broken

```
sage: F = GF(2).algebraic_closure()
sage: z3 = F.gen(3)
sage: z2 = F.gen(2)
sage: hash(z2)
15616093818140894
sage: hash(z3+z2-z3)
5386247743066594243
```
But thanks to #19016 the error now shows up!

How does this interact with #17569? If finite fields will now embed by default in the algebraic closure, the hashes should be preserved.

No interaction as far as I can see.

True. But it is disjoint from #17569, isn't it? Even without this patch hashes are incompatible by restriction to finite fields (except the prime field). It might be tricky to provide a coherent hash that would depend on the embedding... a (far from optimal) solution for finite field could be

```
def __hash__(self):
    cf = self._parent.coerce_embedding()
    if cf is not None:
        return hash(cf(self))
    else:
        ... old code ...
```
What do you think? But I would consider this as disjoint from this ticket.

I am not sure that this really is a good idea: https://wiki.sagemath.org/EqualityCoercion
In the long run we might have to move away from our "mathematical" implementation of `==` but this is not the focus of this ticket.
The changes propose here are a clear improvement of the current situation and seem perfectly fine to me.
