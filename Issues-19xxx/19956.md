We have

```
sage: K = GF(2).algebraic_closure()
sage: a = K.an_element()
sage: hash(a)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: ...
```
and this prevent resultant computation of bivariate polynomials

```
sage: R.<x,y> = K[]
sage: x.resultant(y)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: ...
```

On the way we also provide a straightforward faster powering.

---

Just as a remark, the hash we had in sage-6.8 was **completely** broken

```
sage: F = GF(2).algebraic_closure()
sage: z3 = F.gen(3)
sage: z2 = F.gen(2)
sage: hash(z2)
15616093818140894
sage: hash(z3+z2-z3)
5386247743066594243
```
But thanks to #19016 the error now shows up!

Here is a naive implementation. We need to do some kind of canonicalization to get the hash value... hence it is necessarily slow. There might be some faster option if we have more compatibility with the multiplicative generators.

I am not sure about the optimal size of `p1` and `p2`... But you are right anyway, I should get rid of the branch!

How does this interact with #17569? If finite fields will now embed by default in the algebraic closure, the hashes should be preserved.

No interaction as far as I can see.

True. But it is disjoint from #17569, isn't it? Even without this patch hashes are incompatible by restriction to finite fields (except the prime field). It might be tricky to provide a coherent hash that would depend on the embedding... a (far from optimal) solution for finite field could be

```
def __hash__(self):
    cf = self._parent.coerce_embedding()
    if cf is not None:
        return hash(cf(self))
    else:
        ... old code ...
```
What do you think? But I would consider this as disjoint from this ticket.

I am not sure that this really is a good idea: https://wiki.sagemath.org/EqualityCoercion
In the long run we might have to move away from our "mathematical" implementation of `==` but this is not the focus of this ticket.
The changes propose here are a clear improvement of the current situation and seem perfectly fine to me.
