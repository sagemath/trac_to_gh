This ticket introduces a new decoder for GRS codes, the Guruswami-Sudan list decoder.
The code proposed here relies extensively on the code written by Johan Nielsen in [codinglib](https://bitbucket.org/jsrn/codinglib/). He wrote all the algorithms and mathematical content.

Alongside with the decoder itself, this ticket introduces a root-finding algorithm based using Roth-Ruckenstein algorithm and an interpolation algorithm using linear algebra to solve a linear system of equations.

First of all, I set it to `needs_review` because I can't set it to `needs_work`, but it still lacks a small enhancement before being open for review.

I already added myself as a reviewer because I read Johan's code while porting it.
Of course, I'll need someone to review my changes and documentation `;)`

I've reviewed the code by hand now, and modified a bunch of stuff, most of it related to docs and doc-tests. Please look through my changes and see if you agree.

Tomorrow, I'll do some blackbox-testing of the code. Then the green light should come (if you accept my modifications).

(note that there are more commits than the 10 listed below)

Best,

I read all your changes, and I agree with most, I made a few small changes by myself:

- There was an typo in `decode_to_message`'s doctest because of which the test failed. I fixed it.

- `_flatten_once` doctest had the flag `#random` while its output is not random, thus I removed this flag.

One remark: In #19653, I changed all my hardcoded doctests related to `decode_to_*` methods by examples looking like this:

```
build the code, say C
build the decoder, say D
generate a random element of the code, say c
create a channel which creates as many errors as the decoder's decoding radius
transmit c to get y
check if c == D.decode_to_code(y) [resp. D.connected_encoder().unencode(c) == D.decode_to_message(y)]
```

which I think is a bit better. For instance, it allows us to pick larger codes for tests as you don't have to write the codewords...

Here, I noticed you picked your examples so you get a list of `size > 1`, which I think is a good idea. I don't see a way to use this kind of tests AND guarantee that list size will be at least two though...

Also, I don't really like the new title of `interpolation.py` module as it appears in the index of modules: 

> Finding F[x]-roots, or modular F[x] roots, in polynomials over F[x][y], where F is a (finite) field.


With such a title, one does not immediately see how this module refers to codes/decoding imho.
It's a matter of taste I guess, so I'm not asking to change it, I'm just pointing it.

On my side, I give the greenlight to all your changes. If you agree with mine, I think we're good to go.

David

OK.

Well, there is a way to autogenerate received words with a list size > 1, but I think that would be total overkill.

Fair point. I guess I was exactly thinking about the modules' potential outside coding theory. Can we strike a balance:

   Finding F[x] roots for (F[x])[y] polynomials, with F a (finite) field, as used in the Guruswami-Sudan decoding algorithm.


> On my side, I give the greenlight to all your changes. If you agree with mine, I think we're good to go.


Cool. Let's agree on the above title and then ship it.
