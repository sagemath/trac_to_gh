The current implementation of syndrome decoder for linear codes actually uses a nearest neighbor decoding algorithm.

It should be rewritten.

I replaced the old "syndrome" decoder by a new implementation which creates a lookup table for syndromes.

This ticket is now open for review.

I fixed a few bugs:

- the check related to lexicographic order in `_build_lookup_table` was wrong, as it ignored the weight of the vectors. Now the vector with the smallest weight is kept, and if both vectors have the same weight, the smallest in lexicographic order is kept.
- I added an early termination condition on the loop to fill the table, which triggers if no vector was added to the table during a full iteration.
- I also added an early termination to `decode_to_code`: if received vector's syndrome equals to zero, it does not contain any error and thus can be returned as is.
- Finally, I added checks over the input, especially, it is no longer possible to take `number_errors` > `code.length()`.

This is still open for review,

David

Quick remark

- Since the covering radius of a linear code is always at most `n-k`, does it
  make any sense to let the table search beyond that?

- Did you prove that if there are no coset leaders of weight `t`, then there are no coset leaders of `t+1`? (i.e. that your early termination is sound)

It comes from theorem 1.12.6, prop. 5 (page 51) in Huffman and Pless

**Theorem 1.12.6** Let C be an [n, k] code over F q . Let C*
a code obtained from C by puncturing on some coordinate. The following hold:

(v) Assume that x is a coset leader of C. If x' ∈ `(F_q)^n` all of whose nonzero components agree
with the same components of x, then x' is also a coset leader of C. In particular, if
there is a coset of weight s, there is also a coset of any weight less than s.

Indeed, we seem to have an issue with what `decoding_radius` should mean. Should it here be `min(number_errors, halft-min-dist)`, or should it just be `number_errors`, with the understanding that it chooses the nearest neighbour?

This should also be reflected in the `decoder_type`. (btw. is this even set for this decoder?!).

I have the same feeling, I'll perform some tests to verify this (empirically), and I will remove these checks if they prove themselves useless.

Yes it is, for now it's:

```
LinearCodeSyndromeDecoder._decoder_type = {"hard-decision", "unique", "always-succeed", "complete"}
```

It's not shown in the diff because it was set like this before, and I did not change it.

It's true, `e_cur` will always be less than `e` in the lexicographical order (including having lower weight).

I have a question: why is that loop written in this bizarre way? I mean, wy not do a `for nerrors in range(1, t+1):` and then call `break` within the loop if you need to jump out early?

I agree with Julian that `_list_all_error_values` is memory-wise inefficient.
But furthermore, I don't understand your use of `Permutation`? What you need is `cartesian_product`.

I think your `decode_to_code` *modifies* the input vector without copying it. This is very bad!

Best,
Johan

Hmm, I'm not sure this is my solution ;-) There are decoding methods which decode up to, say t > d/2 errors, but which might fail with low probability (interleaved codes, power decoding, ao.). Should `decoding_radius` really return `d/2` for all these? Perhaps it's the definition of `decoding_radius` which should change.

OK, I missed it when browsing the local file then. "complete" should only be
added if one sets `number_errors` at least the covering radius of the code.

Hello,

I changed the following in my code:

- I renamed `number_errors` as `maximum_error_weight`. I changed accordingly the description given by representation methods `_latex_` and `_repr_`. I also renamed its getter (from `number_errors` to `maximum_error_weight`), and changed its docstring.
- `covering_radius` now returns `min(maximum_error_weight, half-min-dist`). I changed its docstring and added a note to explain it performs a minimum distance computation, which can be long...
- I rewrote `_list_all_error_values`, which now takes an input parameter `weight` and builds only the exhaustive list of error values of weight `weight`. It now uses `cartesian_product` instead of `Permutation`.
- I rewrote `_build_lookup_table`, which now uses a `for` loop. I removed the useless lexicographic order check. It still terminates early if no new pattern is added during a loop.  
- The input of `decode_to_code` is now copied *before* modification.
- Finally, I fixed a few broken doctests, and removed the keyword `complete` in `decoder_type` as computing the covering radius can only be done by a call to a method forcing the use of optional library Guava. Ticket #19913 proposes a new `covering_radius` method which has a Python alternative to Guava. Once this ticket (or #19913) gets reviewed, I'll do the appropriate updates wrt. covering radius in the remaining one.

Sorry about this poorly written code, it should be better now.

Hi

You mean `decoding_radius` I'm sure :-) But you completely misunderstood what I wrote before, I'm afraid. By your updated docstring, then clearly `decoding_radius` should return `maximum_error_weight`.

I just had a pretty cool idea: When building the lookup-table you're actually *computing the minimum distance*! If `t` is the lowest weight at which you detect a collision, i.e. see a syndrome that has already occurred before, then the minimum distance is `2t` or `2t-1` (you can determine which it was by inspecting the weight of the errors that collided). In any case, "half the minimum distance decoding" will be `t` errors.

If `maximum_error_weight < t` then `_build_lookup_table` will never see a collision, and so it can *know* that the minimum distance is greater. Hence, it can know it is a bounded distance decoder. If `maximum_error_weight = t`, then a collision will be seen at this weight, and so the decoder can know it is a minimum distance decoder. If `maximum_error_weight > t`, then it knows that it will sometimes fail, but it will mostly decode up to `min(maximum_error_weight, covering_radius)` (see below). There should be some appropriate keywords in `type` distinguishing these cases.

Once the infrastructure we talked about previously is in place, the `Code` could be informed of this minimum distance.

In the same vein, you're *also* computing the covering radius. For if `w+1` is the first weight where *every* error weight collides with a lower-weight error, then `w` is the covering radius.

Now, if `maximum_error_weight < w`, then `_build_lookup_table` will never see this event, and so it clearly doesn't determine the covering radius. In that case, `maximum_error_weight` is truly the decoding radius (except that if `maximum_error_weight >= d/2$` then it might sometime return another minimum weight error, and not the one that was added).

There's no need to return a `list`. Just return the `cartesian_product` object. And in the inner `for`-loop of `_build_lookup_table`, instead of looping over `j`, do a `for error in error_values_of_weight[t]` or something.

In Python, a `list` is concretely instantiated and takes space in memory. A
`generating_expression` takes next to no memory. When you can, use
`generating_expression`.

We're down to aesthetics now, but wouldn't it be nicer to inline `_list_all_error_values` so you don't need to construct `l` time and again? You could e.g. make a generating expression which generates the generating expressions:

```
   error_position_tables = [ cartesian_product([l]*weight) for weight in range(maximum_error_weight) ]
```


> - Finally, I fixed a few broken doctests, and removed the keyword `complete` in `decoder_type` as computing the covering radius can only be done by a call to a method forcing the use of optional library Guava.

Once this ticket (or #19913) gets reviewed, I'll do the appropriate updates wrt. covering radius in the remaining one.


By my arguments above, you can add `complete` whenever the covering radius was determined during `_build_lookup_table`.


Also, I just noticed that `__eq__` is wrong: it doesn't compare `maximum_error_weight`.

Best,
Johan

Thank you for your comments.

But now another problem arises, namely how to design a generic mechanism to inform codes about some of their "properties".

Consider you have a code and you perform syndrome decoding.

If you already computed its minimum distance, you can fill `decoder_type` at construction time. If you did not, you will fill it while building the table of syndromes and you have to inform the code that it now knows its minimum distance.
This can be done for instances of `LinearCode` as they have a class argument `minimum_distance` but how to do that properly for other codes (e.g. `GeneralizedReedSolomonCode`) that do not possess this class parameter?  

The same issue arises with covering radius, but for any code this time, as there is no class with a `_covering_radius` parameter.

I might again be completely missing the spot here, but it does not appear to me as a simple mechanism to implement, especially if we want something generic. I'm working on it, so for now 
I did not change `maximum_error_weight` nor `decoding_radius`.

All the other requested changes has been made. Leaving this in `needs_work` for now.

Hi David,

I agree, David, that the "informing the code"-feature is advanced and shouldn't be done in this ticket. Sorry for not making that clear.

So, firstly, I want to say that my comments actually make sense even as a completely internal mechanism of `SyndromeDecoder`. That is, harvesting the true minimum distance and covering radius while the lookup-table is being build enables the decoder to give useful feedback to the user, such as its decoding radius and a more precise decoder type.

Secondly, I hope you realise that this is "just" yet another example of the usefulness of a general mechanism for specifying upper- and lower-bounds on the minimum distance of a code, and it shows that, indeed as could have been expected, that minimum distance is *not* special in this regard: there are other parameters for which me might want such a mechanism (in this case, covering radius).

To be more precise, say we design a general system for informing a `LinearCode` that new knowledge has been obtained on a property it has. It could be something like (and now I'm totally making this up on the spot):

```
   `LinearCode._update_property_bound(property_name, update_type, value)
```

With such a mechanism, `SyndromeDecoder` would call

```
   `self._code._update_property_bound("minimum_distance", "upper", t)
   `self._code._update_property_bound("minimum_distance", "lower", t)
```

or simply

```
   `self._code._update_property_bound("minimum_distance", "exact", t)
```

Then the function `minimum_distance` should be changed accordingly. And various functions for computing or bounding the minimum distance should also be changed accordingly.

As we have discussed before, we should be very careful not completely over-engineering this. I think it might be useful to start compiling a list of examples where such bound computation is possible and could be useful.

> So, firstly, I want to say that my comments actually make sense even as a completely internal mechanism of SyndromeDecoder. That is, harvesting the true minimum distance and covering radius while the lookup-table is being build enables the decoder to give useful feedback to the user, such as its decoding radius and a more precise decoder type.


Of course they are, I'm perfectly aware of that! I was not criticising the usefulness of it, I was just saying it seems quite difficult and a bit out of purpose in this ticket.

> Secondly, I hope you realise that this is "just" yet another example of the usefulness of a general mechanism for specifying upper- and lower-bounds on the minimum distance of a code, and it shows that, indeed as could have been expected, that minimum distance is *not* special in this regard: there are other parameters for which me might want such a mechanism (in this case, covering radius).


Definitely. `dimension` should be added to this list of lower- and upper-bounds...
I realized that while working on shortened codes (and subfield subcodes as well). Well, this mechanism is actually useful with any code manipulation class.


For the mechanism, why not working on a set of decorators? Or maybe a generic decorator with arguments, like `bound` which can be set to `lower`, `upper` or `exact` and an argument `parameter`, which can be set to `minimum_distance`, `dimension` or `covering_radius`?
Once properly implemented, it should be easy to use, and very flexible (adding new parameters would be very simple).

Note it's just an idea in the wind, I'm definitely no expert in decorators, I just read the documentation in the bus 20 min ago `;)`But it seems feasible. Anyway, I opened a follow-up ticket #19959.

You were saying a lot on how the code-parameter mechanism had issues and was difficult, and possibly implied that it was out of place. You didn't comment on the fact that my suggestions still made sense for `SyndromeDecoder` completely isolatedly.

But I do realise that this ended up being a larger kettle of fish than we originally intended. In case you're against implementing the decoding radius and covering radius thing, *internally in SyndromeDecoder* for now, I would say the only sensible semantics/documentation are:

- `decoding_radius` returns `maximum_error_weight`. It's main docstring remains
  as it is, while the Note is, of course, removed. Possibly add a Note saying
  something like "When correcting beyond half the minimum distance, correct
  unique decoding is not always possible. This decoder returns a codeword of
  minimum distance to the received. In particular, if `maximum_error_weight` is
  beyond the covering radius of the code, decoding of this many errors is
  guaranteed to be incorrect.".

- `maximum_error_weight` is capped at `n-k` in the constructor.

On an unrelated note, I also noticed: The docstring of `SyndromeDecoder` should explain in 2-3 lines what the decoder does. There's a "a" missing before "syndrome" in the first line.

Hmm, yes it's an interesting idea. I could imagine that the decorator be backed by some functions that should be callable directly. What we discussed on this ticket would likely use those functions and not a decorator (since `SyndromeDecoder` is another object than the code itself, and since `_build_lookup_table` has the potential to discover 0, 1 or 2 parameters of the `Code`.

That's what I have in mind. I read more carefully the documentation, it seems interesting to do, and definitely possible.
The reason I thought about decorators in the first place is because, we, as usual, want a mechanism which has the best genericity/simplicity ratio. And with a decorator, if one wants to implement his own methods, one only has to add a decorator over some specific methods, which is definitely simple!

Another question:

For now, `_build_lookup_table` is called on the first decoding attempt, and not at construction time.
I made this choice, because, as a user, I prefer objects I use to be constructed quickly, and then spend some time when calling methods over this objects rather than waiting at construction time. It's a matter of taste I guess. Also, I might be working in a very strange way for which I need to construct decoders but not using their decoding methods. From this point of view, the faster the better.

Anyway, here we have the following behaviour:

- I build my decoder.
- If I call directly `maximum_error_weight()`, `decoding_radius()` or representation methods, it will return me results based on either the value I chose for `maximum_error_weight` or `n-k` depending on which is the lowest.
- Then I perform some decoding, call the methods I listed above again, and their output might have change... The same occurs with `decoder_type()`.

From the user point of view, it can be quite confusing (imho).
So, wouldn't it be better to build the lookup table at construction time, so "internal" `minimum_distance` and `covering_radius` might be found (if possible) and results updated accordingly?

In that configuration, whenever I call representations methods, `decoder_type` and so on, their output will remain the same. 

What do you think?

Hello,

I did the required changes:

- `covering_radius` and `minimum_distance` for the code are now internally saved whenever found,
- `decoder_type` is updated accordingly, `decoding_radius` and `maximum_error_weight` likewise.
- The lookup table is now computed at construction time to solve the problem presented in comment 24.
- I also added `"dynamic"` to the list of types for this decoder.

I made some naming choices for the new decoder types here, which I like you to discuss, especially `"might_create_decoding_error"` which is awful. I did not have a better idea, sorry...

I commented my code as best as possible, because the chain of `if` statements at the end of `_build_lookup_table` is pretty ugly.
I chose to not write getter methods for the internal `minimum_distance` and `covering_radius`, because depending on how far it went into the computation, it can fill these fields - or not. I preferred these to be properly filled when #19959 will be ready instead of implementing something clumsy. But I think this is somehow bizarre, as we might get useful information and not pass it to the user. This choice is of course open to discussion.

By the way, this question is more or less related, does anyone remember what a `complete` decoder is? I cannot remember this... Which once again proves I need to write a proper list of these types in the introductory thematic tutorial.

Best,

David

Hi,

Sounds cool! I'll take a closer look later on.

Yeah, `might_create_decoding_error` is pretty bad :-) `complete` refers to the fact that it decodes every word in the ambient space. It's more or less a synonym of one of the meanings of "maximum-likelihood", I guess, whenever the decoder is also `unique`. I.e. Syndrome decoder is `complete` when the decoding radius is the covering radius.

There is a type-discussion on this Issue on our bitbucket repo: https://bitbucket.org/lucasdavid/sage_coding_project/issues/40/decoder-introspection

The decoder you're doing now is similar to Power decoding of RS codes (which I gave types `hard-decision`, `unique`, `might-fail`): both decoders give a unique answer and return a closest codeword. However, Power decoding "might fail" in the sense that it doesn't give *any answer at all*. While SyndromeDecoder "might fail" in the sense that it gives you *another* close codeword than what you sent. As opposed to this, Guruswami-Sudan "always succeeds" in the sense that *your* codeword is guaranteed to be on the list of outputs (up to the decoding radius).

We therefore seem to have an issue with what we mean by "might-fail" in case of decoding beyond d/2. Perhaps "might-error" is a good choice, to mirror the "decoding failure/decoding error" terminology of coding theory.

Yes, a list should be made of the "common" types (all we have used so far) of decoders, and an explanation. In the doc-string of `decoder_type`, there should be a clear explanation on how to look up what they mean. (another ticket of course). Perhaps even in the doc-string for `decoder_type`, if the explanations can be made short enough, since the function is always the original `Decoder.decoder_type`.

Best,
Johan

Okay, thanks!

> Yes, a list should be made of the "common" types (all we have used so far) of decoders, and an explanation. In the doc-string of decoder_type, there should be a clear explanation on how to look up what they mean. (another ticket of course). Perhaps even in the doc-string for decoder_type, if the explanations can be made short enough, since the function is always the original Decoder.decoder_type.


Mmhh, I'm not sure i'll be able to keep it short, especially as it might grow when we will implement new decoders.
I'll give it a try, and if it's too long, I will add an extra paragraph dedicated to decoders and types in #19897.

It's changed in #19897

I changed the terrible type name by `might-error` as suggested. I also removed `always-succeed` from the default set of types, as in the case `might-error` occurs it cannot always succeed...
It's now dynamically added to the relevant cases.
And I replaced all underscores by hyphen in type names for consistency purposes.

OK, so I looked through the new version of the ticket, and I took the liberty of patching various things directly.

- I think the semantics that `decoding_radius` returns `d/2` when you decode way beyond `d/2` makes no sense. I've changed `decoding_radius` to have same semantics as `maximum_error_weight`, and I've removed `self._decoding_radius`.

- I changed a number of docs and elaborated on the description of the decoder. I added a note that it's exponential time. I didn't check typesetting of the compiled docs, sorry.

- I renamed `self.lookup_table` to `self.syndrome_table`. Hope you agree with me.

- I fixed how the types are dynamically assigned. It was done weirdly before.

- I fixed several bugs in your by-now quite overworked `_build_lookup_table`. There were bugs related to both the minimum distance and covering radius, leading to catastrophic behaviour in the final decoder. Firstly, since you hadn't added the zero-syndrome to your table, both early termination and determination of minimum distance was buggy. I added this to the table. Secondly, your early termination didn't actually break out of the loop. Consequently, you never terminated early and you usually did not correctly determine the covering radius. This was blatantly obvious in the doctest you used everywhere, since the covering radius for that code is actually 1. This leaves all the doctests currently failing. I didn't fix it properly since I realised that a better example is probably called for, and I didn't have time to do that myself now.

- Probably the above calls for some doctests that actually tests the minimum-distance determining and covering-radius determining behaviour. I leave it to you to be the judge of that.

Please, try to test your code and sanity check the output before you put it up for review. This is getting bothersome...

I changed the doctests to something better.
I also added a whole paragraph to explain how the dynamic types worked, illustrating the creation of three syndrome decoders over the same code, one with `maximum_error_weight` less than both the covering radius and half the minimum distance, one with `maximum_error_rate` between the two values, and one with `maximum_error_rate` bigger than the two values.

Finally, I also changed `union` by `add` when adding a type to `_decoder_type`, because for some reason, `union` was doing nothing.

I identified the problem, it was because of a [12, 4] GRS code over `GF(13)` in my examples.
Decoding over this code using the new syndrome decoder required to build a huge syndrome lookup table, hence the memory error.

I replaced it by a [6, 3] code over `GF(7)`, so it should be fine now.

Reopening for review...

David

Hah, that's pretty funny: before, the syndrome decoder was actually a nearest neighbor decoder, and therefore ran in `q^k`. Now, it's really a syndrome decoder and runs in `q^(n-k)`, which is too big for the previous example in the tutorial.

Perhaps, a linear code should default to using syndrome or nearest neighbor depending on which of `q^(n-k)` or `q^k` is biggest?

For this ticket: green again.
