Actually "return", not "returns". And there is a missing space before it. (I.e. an indentation of 3 spaces instead of 4.)

Looks good. A few comments on the doc: 

In the second sentence, the color 'yellow' is missing.

Add 'For example,' to the start of the fourth sentence.

The fourth, fifth, and sixth sentences need periods at the end.

Under `INPUT:`, you should have <code>\`\`False\`\`</code> instead of just `False`.

Try making it "totally self-complementary plane partitons in a <code>\`2n \times 2n \times 2n\`</code> box".

Description for optional parameter `int_label` should be more explicit in saying which boolean value gives which labeling.

`ordinal_sum()` in posets have optional parameter `labels` with possible values `'pairs'` and `'integers'`. Should this follow that pattern instead of `int_label`, as Sage uses `int_label` nowhere before this? If not, at least try to copy some existing pattern for the parameter.
