Actually "return", not "returns". And there is a missing space before it. (I.e. an indentation of 3 spaces instead of 4.)

Under `INPUT:`, you should have ```False``` instead of just `False`.

Try making it "totally self-complementary plane partitons in a ``2n \times 2n \times 2n`` box".

Description for optional parameter `int_label` should be more explicit in saying which boolean value gives which labeling.
