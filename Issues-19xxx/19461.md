While Sage already has `falling_factorial` and `rising_factorial` functions they are not symbolic. Always using gamma or product expansions may be inconvenient in some cases, and does not offer the option to rewrite expressions in terms of them. Especially the product form cannot be easily rewritten as gamma expression. So the product expansion should be made optional.

Keywords: **falling_factorial, rising_factorial**

Component: **symbolics**

It seems that this has been fixed in recent versions of Sage.  At least, the functions can now be used as part of symbolic expressions:

```
sage: rising_factorial(x, 3)
(x + 2)*(x + 1)*x
sage: rising_factorial(x, x)
gamma(2*x)/gamma(x)
```
I have therefore set the ticket to "invalid".  Please change back if I am misreading the description.

The planned behaviour would be expanding as the default. Adding `hold=True` will prevent it.

However, it seems at first the ticket cannot be implemented unless matrices etc. coerce into SR:

```
File "src/sage/arith/misc.py", line 4377, in sage.arith.misc.falling_factorial
Failed example:
    falling_factorial(A, 2) # A(A - I)
...
      File "sage/symbolic/function.pyx", line 996, in sage.symbolic.function.BuiltinFunction.__call__ (build/cythonized/sage/symbolic/function.cpp:11436)
        res = super(BuiltinFunction, self).__call__(
      File "sage/symbolic/function.pyx", line 474, in sage.symbolic.function.Function.__call__ (build/cythonized/sage/symbolic/function.cpp:6321)
        raise TypeError("cannot coerce arguments: %s" % (err))
    TypeError: cannot coerce arguments: no canonical coercion from Full MatrixSpace of 4 by 4 dense matrices over Integer Ring to Symbolic Ring
```
The reason is that making the symbolic `rising/falling_factorial` the default will switch on some checks that are in `symbolic/function.pyx` so the doctests in `arith/misc.py` will fail unless the `arith/` version is explicitly called, which is a viable option IMHO. Compare #17489 which is stuck because the overriding of the `arith/` version (of `factorial()`) causes failure of the algorithm keyword.

The pragmatic solution would be to accept there are two versions of the functions `rising/falling_/factorial()` (more?) and that the versions in `arith/` must be explicitly called if the symbolic ones don't suffice.
