While Sage already has `falling_factorial` and `rising_factorial` functions they are not symbolic. Always using gamma or product expansions may be inconvenient in some cases, and does not offer the option to rewrite expressions in terms of them. Especially the product form cannot be easily rewritten as gamma expression. So the product expansion should be made optional.

Keywords: falling_factorial, rising_factorial

Status: needs_work

<a id='comment:1'></a>It seems that this has been fixed in recent versions of Sage.  At least, the functions can now be used as part of symbolic expressions:

```
sage: rising_factorial(x, 3)

I have therefore set the ticket to "invalid".  Please change back if I am misreading the description.

It was not fixed. I would like at least the option of not converting to gamma fractions, which is impossible without a symbolic function. Also, you don't want `rising_factorial(x, 3000)` expanded. The function itself is worthwhile to have.

I would disagree on that part.  If I ever do explicitly write `rising_factorial(x, 3000)`, then I would like it expanded (just as I appreciate that `factorial(3000)` returns a huge integer).  For what it's worth, that is what Mathematica does.

That's of course a different matter.  Maybe you could update the description?  (The part after "i.e." and the second sentence about implementations like Gosper do not apply anymore.)

<a id='comment:9'></a>The planned behaviour would be expanding as the default. Adding `hold=True` will prevent it.

However, it seems at first the ticket cannot be implemented unless matrices etc. coerce into SR:

```
File "src/sage/arith/misc.py", line 4377, in sage.arith.misc.falling_factorial
Failed example:
    falling_factorial(A, 2) # A(A - I)
...
      File "sage/symbolic/function.pyx", line 996, in sage.symbolic.function.BuiltinFunction.__call__ (build/cythonized/sage/symbolic/function.cpp:11436)
        res = super(BuiltinFunction, self).__call__(
      File "sage/symbolic/function.pyx", line 474, in sage.symbolic.function.Function.__call__ (build/cythonized/sage/symbolic/function.cpp:6321)
        raise TypeError("cannot coerce arguments: %s" % (err))
    TypeError: cannot coerce arguments: no canonical coercion from Full MatrixSpace of 4 by 4 dense matrices over Integer Ring to Symbolic Ring
```
The reason is that making the symbolic `rising/falling_factorial` the default will switch on some checks that are in `symbolic/function.pyx` so the doctests in `arith/misc.py` will fail unless the `arith/` version is explicitly called, which is a viable option IMHO. Compare #17489 which is stuck because the overriding of the `arith/` version (of `factorial()`) causes failure of the algorithm keyword.

The pragmatic solution would be to accept there are two versions of the functions `rising/falling_/factorial()` (more?) and that the versions in `arith/` must be explicitly called if the symbolic ones don't suffice.
