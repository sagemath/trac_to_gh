The current implementation of Farey symbols has a bug only visible for the general congruence subgroups GammaH.

I am fixing this bug, and at the same time add a check option (enabled by default) that will help in detecting similar problems in the future.

<a id='comment:3'></a>Here is an example check of correctness:

```
N = 147
G = GammaH(N,[8])
gens = G.generators()
ngens = len(gens)
F = G.farey_symbol()

# Test that both generators and their inverses give the right one-letter word.
for i,g in enumerate(gens):
    assert F.word_problem(g,output = 'standard') == tuple([i+1])
    assert F.word_problem(g**-1,output = 'standard', check = True) == tuple([-i-1])

# Test some random words
for ntests in range(200):
    print 'ntests = %s'%ntests
    a, b, c = ZZ.random_element(ngens), ZZ.random_element(ngens), ZZ.random_element(ngens)
    g = gens[a]**-5 * gens[b]**2 * gens[c]**-1
    wd = F.word_problem(g, output = 'syllables')
    assert g == prod(gens[j]**n for j,n in wd)
