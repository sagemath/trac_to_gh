It was migeruhito's change (which is where that runtime error comes from, html built from this is not created without making *some* app) that affected this, but for testing we had to do a weirder workaround but I'm not quite sure how building doc should come from sagenb, nor exactly how these changes fix it (Sloane functions?  Really?).  I did check that the documentation builds.\n\nHowever, the live documentation does not seem to work.  In fact, I can't get it to work in Sage 6.9 either!  Can you confirm this?  (Regular notebook seems to work fine.)

<a id='comment:23'></a>So... the documentation builds for me with this.  Is that all that you would need for positive review?  It was migeruhito's change (which is where that runtime error comes from, html built from this is not created without making *some* app) that affected this, but for testing we had to do a weirder workaround but I'm not quite sure how building doc should come from sagenb, nor exactly how these changes fix it (Sloane functions?  Really?).  I did check that the documentation builds.

However, the live documentation does not seem to work.  In fact, I can't get it to work in Sage 6.9 either!  Can you confirm this?  (Regular notebook seems to work fine.)  I guess if it is already broken maybe this isn't so horrible, but it would be best to have it working, and it did work fairly recently or I would have noticed.

Another problem is that I think the security change has [messed with some of the live documentation](https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/pull/324#issuecomment-162136411).
