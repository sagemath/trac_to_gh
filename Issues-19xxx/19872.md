Implements the construction from 

Z.Janko, H.Kharaghani, V.D.Tonchev, The existence of a Bush-type Hadamard matrix of order 324
and two new infinite classes of symmetric designs. Des. Codes Cryptogr. 24(2001), 225-232

and use its RSHCD of '+' type to build an srg on v=324, k=153. Also, use it to construct an RSHCD of '-' type and build an srg on v=324, k=152.

What would you think of moving your code to a new function? I understand that it seems a bit silly considering that the code is 10 lines long, but that would give you a proper place to add your doc. As it is, it feels a bit weird to have a lengthy explanation of how this specific RSHCD is built when there is none for the others.

A new list in memory only because you want j[0] instead of j?...

Of course we don't care, or course it's totally negligible, but what the hell. Don'you want to write Python code instead of badly translating GAP code into Python?..

Did you try to figure out where was the loss of time coming from? I don't see Sage ever improving if you switch to using GAP directly whenever Sage's interface is too slow.

no, it's actually two changes; say, if `st` was a Sage `PermutationGroup` it would be

```
-        for j in b:
+        for j in map(lambda x: x[0], st.orbits(b)):
```
to discard taking representatives of the same orbit of `st` (a 3 to 4-fold speedup), and then the translation to libGAP (another 3-fold speedup) is 

```
-        for j in map(lambda x: x[0], st.orbits(b)):
+        for j in map(lambda x: x[0], st.OrbitsDomain(b)):
```
OK, I should have used `imap`.
