Should this ticket be in `needs_review`?

What would you think of moving your code to a new function? I understand that it seems a bit silly considering that the code is 10 lines long, but that would give you a proper place to add your doc. As it is, it feels a bit weird to have a lengthy explanation of how this specific RSHCD is built when there is none for the others.

A new list in memory only because you want j[0] instead of j?...

Anyway.

Did you try to figure out where was the loss of time coming from? I don't see Sage ever improving if you switch to using GAP directly whenever Sage's interface is too slow.

no, it's actually two changes; say, if `st` was a Sage `PermutationGroup` it would be

```
-        for j in b:
+        for j in map(lambda x: x[0], st.orbits(b)):
```
to discard taking representatives of the same orbit of `st` (a 3 to 4-fold speedup), and then the translation to libGAP (another 3-fold speedup) is 

```
-        for j in map(lambda x: x[0], st.orbits(b)):
+        for j in map(lambda x: x[0], st.OrbitsDomain(b)):
```
OK, I should have used `imap`.
