I tried to make a branch using the brand new possibilities of "richcmp(x,y,op)". (see #21128)

I am a bit disappointed by the results of comparison with op in `<,>,>=,<=`.

Travis, what do you think ?

I am pretty sure this is not correct:

```python
if parent(self) is not parent(other):
    return NotImplemented
```
You need to check if the comparison is `!=` as otherwise you would have `1 == b` and `1 != b` both return `False`.

Could you also elaborate more on what you mean by this?

I have replace `__richcmp__` by `_richcmp_`, for which one can assume that
arguments have the same parents. Now one gets

```
sage: b==1
False
sage: b!=1
True
```
But

```
sage: cmp(b,c)
-1
sage: cmp(c,b)
1
sage: c<b
False
sage: b<c
False
```
Maybe for coherence we will need to apply the same treatment to all crystals ?

```

False
sage: cmp(b,c)

sage: b.__cmp__(c)

what is the first line doing, if not calling either cmp or `__cmp__` or rich comparison ?

So the problem with the pickling and `_richcmp_` has to do with equality versus identical parents. The parents are equal but not identical. This causes problems for `__richcmp__`, where it relies on parents being identical. It then creates an element wrapping an element of the test parent.

We can either implement the following the test parent to fix the doctest:

```sage
    def _element_constructor_(self, x):
        if isinstance(x, ElementWrapper):
            if x.parent() == self:
                return self.element_class(self, x.value)
        return Parent._element_constructor_(self, x)

    def _an_element_(self):
        return self.element_class(self, "_an_element_")
```
The other way is to override `__richcmp__` for `ElementWrapper` to handle when parents are equal but not identical.

I'm thinking the latter option is the way to go forward as it is backwards compatible.

The problem is

```sage
sage: TestParent4() == TestParent4()
True
sage: TestParent4() is TestParent4()
```

Yes. `__richcmp__` is called by Python, whereas `_richcmp_` is the Sage version that is called from `__richcmp__`.

So `self` is known to Cython to be an `ElementWrapper` for speed for `_richcmp_` (or so I've been told). For `__richcmp__`, it was a result of copy/paste and laziness. I'm okay with changing both of them.
