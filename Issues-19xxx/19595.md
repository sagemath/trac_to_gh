Replying to [@fchapoton](#comment%3A4):
> * do you check for "freeness" or some stronger "inductive freeness" ?

As I understand it, this is just freeness, but I will make a detailed reading and double-check this.

> * in `to_symmetric_space`
> 
> ```
> return S.sum(G[i]*c for i,c in enumerate(self.coefficients()[1:]))
> ```
> why is there `[1:]` ?

Because the first coefficient of a hyperplane is the constant part (as the arrangements do not need to be central, i.e., they are allowed to be affine hyperplanes).

> * maybe you should rather write
> `chordality is equivalent to freeness`
> and name the files "`check_freeness`"

Will change.

This does not check inductive freeness because it does not check both the exponent condition and the freeness of the restriction. However this would make for a good followup.

In my recent push, I now forbid affine hyperplanes since I don't believe they make sense in the symmetric space.

I have just given a very quick look at the code, but it seems to me that you are actually computing a free resolution of the logarithmic derivation module. Or at least the first steps of it. Is that correct?

If this is the case, maybe it would be worth doing so by using Singular, which already has this implemented.

Something like

```
sage: R.<x,y,z,t> = QQ[]
sage: f = x^3 + y^3 +z^3+ t^3
sage: I = f.jacobian_ideal()
sage: IS = I._singular_()
sage: res = IS.mres(0)
sage: res
[1]:
   _[1]=t^2
   _[2]=z^2
   _[3]=y^2
   _[4]=x^2
[2]:
   _[1]=z^2*gen(1)-t^2*gen(2)
   _[2]=y^2*gen(1)-t^2*gen(3)
   _[3]=y^2*gen(2)-z^2*gen(3)
   _[4]=x^2*gen(1)-t^2*gen(4)
   _[5]=x^2*gen(2)-z^2*gen(4)
   _[6]=x^2*gen(3)-y^2*gen(4)
[3]:
   _[1]=y^2*gen(1)-z^2*gen(2)+t^2*gen(3)
   _[2]=x^2*gen(1)-z^2*gen(4)+t^2*gen(5)
   _[3]=x^2*gen(2)-y^2*gen(4)+t^2*gen(6)
   _[4]=x^2*gen(3)-y^2*gen(5)+z^2*gen(6)
[4]:
   _[1]=x^2*gen(1)-y^2*gen(2)+z^2*gen(3)-t^2*gen(4)
sage: len(res)
4
```

should give you a minimal free resolution of the logarithmic derivation module of every homogenous polynomial f, so it would be free iff len(res)<=2 .

For the  non homogenous case, one might need to work a little bit with the homogenization of the polynomial, but it can also be done.

Could you please compare the timings of your code with the singular method?

Barakat and Cuntz say explicitly at the beginning of Section 6 "free *central* arrangement". So it works well beyond inversion arrangements.

I am not surprised, but a lot of Singular does not seem to be (well) exposed with good interface classes. (Actually, AFAIK this is the first implementation of a not-necessarily-free module in Sage.) I came across Singular's free resolution code after I had made this, but I was lazy. This did what I wanted and I didn't want to figure out the Singular interface and write the wrappers.

I am all but certain your code works faster when the arrangement is not free. I could (should) optimize my code by doing a backtracking algorithm too; at least that would make it a more fair comparison. On my next push, I will include an option for both algorithms.

The Singular code rips my implementation to shreads. It at least 2x faster (often times much more so) in the cases I tested (inversion arrangements for types A<sub>3</sub> and B<sub>3</sub>), so I am making that the default.

I implemented by backtracking in a recursive fashion since I didn't want to deal with managing my own stack, and if you're doing something with 1000 hyperplanes (reaching Python's recursion depth limit), then you are probably better off waiting for the universe to implode.

Hmmm, usually when I want to compute a basis I do so by taking the syzygy module of the jacobian ideal of the polynomial. This procedure has always given me a basis, but now I am not sure if it is granted to work always.

```

Perhaps we should just include this as-is for now and do a follow-up ticket for finding a faster way to construct the basis?

That is good with me. I made some other little tweaks:

- Since we are removing the trailing whitespace, I changed the indentation to make things easier to read.
- I made the errors Python3 compatible and capitalized correctly (since they are not full sentences).

If you're happy with my changes, then positive review.

Thank you for doing the review.
