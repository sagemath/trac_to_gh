As I understand it, this is just freeness, but I will make a detailed reading and double-check this.

Because the first coefficient of a hyperplane is the constant part (as the arrangements do not need to be central, i.e., they are allowed to be affine hyperplanes).

This does not check inductive freeness because it does not check both the exponent condition and the freeness of the restriction. However this would make for a good followup.

In my recent push, I now forbid affine hyperplanes since I don't believe they make sense in the symmetric space.

<a id='comment:10'></a>I have just given a very quick look at the code, but it seems to me that you are actually computing a free resolution of the logarithmic derivation module. Or at least the first steps of it. Is that correct?

If this is the case, maybe it would be worth doing so by using Singular, which already has this implemented.

Something like

```
sage: R.<x,y,z,t> = QQ[]
sage: f = x^3 + y^3 +z^3+ t^3
sage: I = f.jacobian_ideal()
sage: IS = I._singular_()
sage: res = IS.mres(0)
sage: res
[1]:
   _[1]=t^2
   _[2]=z^2
   _[3]=y^2
   _[4]=x^2
[2]:
   _[1]=z^2*gen(1)-t^2*gen(2)
   _[2]=y^2*gen(1)-t^2*gen(3)
   _[3]=y^2*gen(2)-z^2*gen(3)
   _[4]=x^2*gen(1)-t^2*gen(4)
   _[5]=x^2*gen(2)-z^2*gen(4)
   _[6]=x^2*gen(3)-y^2*gen(4)
[3]:
   _[1]=y^2*gen(1)-z^2*gen(2)+t^2*gen(3)
   _[2]=x^2*gen(1)-z^2*gen(4)+t^2*gen(5)
   _[3]=x^2*gen(2)-y^2*gen(4)+t^2*gen(6)
   _[4]=x^2*gen(3)-y^2*gen(5)+z^2*gen(6)
[4]:
   _[1]=x^2*gen(1)-y^2*gen(2)+z^2*gen(3)-t^2*gen(4)
sage: len(res)
4
```

should give you a minimal free resolution of the logarithmic derivation module of every homogenous polynomial f, so it would be free iff len(res)<=2 .

For the  non homogenous case, one might need to work a little bit with the homogenization of the polynomial, but it can also be done.

Could you please compare the timings of your code with the singular method?

Barakat and Cuntz say explicitly at the beginning of Section 6 "free *central* arrangement". So it works well beyond inversion arrangements.

From some quick Googling (your paper no less) and my (relatively small) understanding of this area of math, I believe so.

I am not surprised, but a lot of Singular does not seem to be (well) exposed with good interface classes. (Actually, AFAIK this is the first implementation of a not-necessarily-free module in Sage.) I came across Singular's free resolution code after I had made this, but I was lazy. This did what I wanted and I didn't want to figure out the Singular interface and write the wrappers.

I am all but certain your code works faster when the arrangement is not free. I could (should) optimize my code by doing a backtracking algorithm too; at least that would make it a more fair comparison. On my next push, I will include an option for both algorithms.
