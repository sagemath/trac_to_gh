`breadth_first_search` of (di)graphs accpepts also a list of elements as an argument, so it is unnecessary to iterate over them in `order_filter()` and `order_ideal()` on `hasse_diagram.py`.

Nathann,

It was said in some web page that a code like `[c for c in self.cover_relations_iterator()]` is slower than `list(self.cover_relations_iterator())`. Is it true? If so, please mark this as needs_work and I'll do that also. (And `[z for z in range(self.order())[x:y+1]` seems odd too.)

If not, this is free to review.

Hello,

I do not know about the difference between those two writings. If there is a difference, I would expect it to be marginal, possibly in favor of 'list' indeed. That would not worry me.

> And `[z for z in range(self.order())[x:y+1]` seems odd too.

That's ridiculous indeed.

About the two functions you touch: why do you insist on *sorting* the elements? This does not seem to be necessary.

Also: reversing the *whole diagram* only to run a BFS is clearly wasteful. Use the `neighbors` argument to the `breadth_first_search` function, and give it `neighbors_in`. Should be much better.

I can't see any reason for that, but that is what is was before. Sorting was kind of hidden inside `uniq`, which gives sorted output when input consist of only `int`s.

Back to needs_review. I somehow think that `[x for x in some_iterator]` is odd, seems like something has been forgotten. ("Should it be `x+1 for x...`?)

`interval()` says "The order is that induced by the ordering in `self.linear_extension`". These functions do not, but the doctests suppose sorted output.
