Now that [let's encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) is available for everybody, the github.com certificate of sagemath.org and the self-signed certificate of trac.sagemath.org should be replaced. Then ***https*** can be used everywhere by default.

Hey Miguel,

I saw you got access to update the wiki certificate. In case you have the rights, could you update the certificate to also cover
* sagemath.org
* www.sagemath.org
* trac.sagemath.org
* patchbot.sagemath.org

Thanks.
