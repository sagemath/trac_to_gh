<a id='comment:7'>Comment 7:</a>
For the reverse implication counterexample, could you also have it display that `L` is (co)atomic.

Also, could you make the following changes:

```diff
             sage: [Posets.ChainPoset(i).is_relatively_complemented() for
-            ....: i in range(5)]
+            ....:  i in range(5)]
             [True, True, True, False, False]
```

```diff
         Usually a lattice that is not relatively complemented contains elements
-        `l`, `m`, and `u` such that rank(`l`)+1 == rank(`m`) == rank(`u`)-1
-        and `m` is the only element in the interval `[l, u]`. We make an
+        `l`, `m`, and `u` such that `r(l) + 1 = r(m) = r(u) - 1`, where `r` is
+        the rank function and `m` is the only element in the interval `[l, u]`.
+        We construct an example where this does not hold::
```

```diff
         C = Counter(flatten([H.neighbors_out(e2) for e2 in H.neighbors_out(e1)]))
-            for e3, c in C.iteritems():
-                if c == 1:
-                    if len(H.closed_interval(e1, e3)) == 3:
-                        return False
+            if any(c == 1 and len(H.closed_interval(e1, e3)) == 3 for e3, c in C.iteritems()):
+                return False
         return True
```

Otherwise it is a positive review.

I can do that, but `is_coatomic()` is not yet closed, see #19878.

Your suggestions to code and documentation seems good.
