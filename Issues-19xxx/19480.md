Bumped the version.

Can you please explain why do I need to quote it? Just the variable name or the whole file name including it? Just in my change or in all other places in this file? (What's the point in quoting it in my command if there are other places in Sage that don't do it?..)

Replying to [@novoselt](#comment%3A5):
> Can you please explain why do I need to quote it?

Because `$SAGE_LOCAL` might contain special characters interpreted by the shell.

> Just the variable name or the whole file name including it?

Doesn't matter. I prefer `"$SAGE_LOCAL/some/file/name"` for aesthetic reasons.

> Just in my change or in all other places in this file?

Preferably in all places in this file.

> What's the point in quoting it in my command if there are other places in Sage that don't do it?

What's the point in fixing bugs in Sage if there are other places in Sage that still have bugs?
