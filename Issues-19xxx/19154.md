In finite_word, there are two functions that do the same thing : lps_lengths and lengths_lps. The second one is quadratic and the first one is linear. In order not to delete the longest function, we create a new one calling the fastest by default and the longest if the naive_algorithm parameter was set to True.

I think this ticket should be closed. It would need to be re-written to agree with the actual version of Sage and I don't think Stéphanie (or someone else) would do it. Moreover, I'm not convinced that creating a new function is the right thing to do to solve that problem.
