* They are a nuisance since they can't contain relative paths. 
* Fedora packaging guide line says "Libtool archives, foo.la files, should not be included"
* the whole idea of Libtool Archives is, nowadays, considered obsolete (https://autotools.io/libtool/lafiles.html)
* Anything that can be done with libtool archives can be done better with pkg-config
