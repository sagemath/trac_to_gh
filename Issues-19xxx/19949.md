Also, I think `SymbolicSubringFactory` does not achieve unique representation semantics because the same subring can be created using different (functor, parent) pairs.
I think a possible way to fix it would be to give `UniqueRepresentation` to `GenericSymbolicSubringFunctor` and `GenericSymbolicSubring`, and to turn `SymbolicSubringFactory` into a simple function.
