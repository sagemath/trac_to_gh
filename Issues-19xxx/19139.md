The aim of this ticket is to implement a category for KR crystals and their tensor products. We do so by implementing a category for (abstract) U<sub>q</sub>'(*g*)-crystals, which I have called `LoopCrystals` in regards to thinking of them as modules in the loop algebra *g*[t]. There will be a regular loop crystals subcategory, and from that, the subcategories with be KR crystals and their tensor products (which do not have a subcategory relationship).

This allows for a uniform interface for all KR crystals, allowing us to define things like `energy_function` for only tensor products of KR crystals where we don't have to check types. This also makes the default weight lattice for general crystals of affine type be the extended affine weight lattice, but anything in the affine derived subalgebra category will use the non-extended weight lattice. As a consequence, it removes duplication of trivial `weight_lattice_realization` methods. This category also allows a better interface which to draw 0-arrows in reverse for digraphs.

This also makes the default weight lattice for general crystals of affine type be the extended affine weight lattice, but anything in the affine derived subalgebra category will use the non-extended weight lattice. As a consequence, it removes duplication of trivial `weight_lattice_realization` methods. This category also allows a better interface which to draw 0-arrows in reverse for digraphs.\n``````\n",

+The aim of this ticket is to implement a category for KR crystals and their tensor products. We do so by implementing a category for (abstract) U<sub>q</sub>'(*g*)-crystals, which I have called `LoopCrystals` in regards to thinking of them as modules in the loop algebra *g*[t]. There will be a regular loop crystals subcategory, and from that, the subcategories with be KR crystals and their tensor products (which do not have a subcategory relationship).
 
 This allows for a uniform interface for all KR crystals, allowing us to define things like `energy_function` for only tensor products of KR crystals where we don't have to check types. This also makes the default weight lattice for general crystals of affine type be the extended affine weight lattice, but anything in the affine derived subalgebra category will use the non-extended weight lattice. As a consequence, it removes duplication of trivial `weight_lattice_realization` methods. This category also allows a better interface which to draw 0-arrows in reverse for digraphs.

<a id='comment:31'></a>First, the documentation does not build.

Second, I merged beta5, removed a typo introduced in `monomial_crystals.py`, and added `loop_crystals` to the `src/doc/en/reference/categories/index.rst`.

Some comments/questions:

- In `affinization.py`, there is a `#TODO` which suggests that the `digraph` method should be removed when this category gets implemented.  Probably either that `#TODO` or the method should be deleted?

- While not added on this ticket, there is a reference to "pg. 48 of Kac" under the `affine_weight` method in `KR_type_E6`.  That reference should be explicit, and why not fix it now?

I'll read through the html documentation of `LoopCrystals` after it's been added to rst file.

A better link would be to `:meth:`maximal_vector``; changed.

Because the stuff not in `<...>` is what is actually displayed (which could be anything). For comparison, if you have `:meth:`foo <bar>``, it is like the html `<a href="bar">foo</a>`.
