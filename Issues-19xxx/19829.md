TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'NoneType' and 'int'
```

and

```
sage: asymptotic_expansions.Stirling('n')
Traceback (most recent call last):

For the Stirling generator, I couldn't get something along the lines of

```
if precision is not None and precision < 3:
    raise ...
```
to work: while it works in Sage on the console, the doctest-framework wasn't happy with my tests. Suggestions are welcome.
