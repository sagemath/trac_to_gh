sage: 1 == hash(2/3) == hash(3/2) == hash(5/4) == hash(4/5) == hash(9/8) == hash(8/9)
True

The hash function of rationals is only a xor between numerator and denominator. As shown above this is too naive to avoid collisions!

There are fractions in Python3, shouldn't we try to be complient with it?

```
>>> import fractions
>>> fractions.Fraction(2,3)
Fraction(2, 3)
>>>  hash(fractions.Fraction(2,3))
768614336404564651
```
The code is actually pure python and takes care of exactly representable float... and Python seems to have a different politics than Sage to that respect.

```
    def __hash__(self):
        """hash(self)

        Tricky because values that are exactly representable as a
        float must have the same hash as that float.

        """
        # XXX since this method is expensive, consider caching the result
        if self._denominator == 1:
            # Get integers right.
            return hash(self._numerator)
        # Expensive check, but definitely correct.
        if self == float(self):
            return hash(float(self))
        else:
            # Use tuple's hash to avoid a high collision rate on
            # simple fractions.
            return hash((self._numerator, self._denominator))

Also Python 2 by the way. Not sure if it's important that Sage is compatible with that. It's easy to do that, but also more expensive.
