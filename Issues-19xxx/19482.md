Would I be correct to guess that you followed the instructions for an index of *functions* in a file that does not define any?

In that file, I'd say that what you want are the methods of a specific class.

> I guess that I should change `__name__` to something.

Nono, this should work.

> And should it be told in these instructions?

Let us first figure out what went wrong in your test.

I just checked my terminology, but it seems correct: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_(computer_programming)

A 'method' is a function defined in a class. The functions are the functions defined in a module.

```
sage: import inspect
sage: P = Poset()
sage: inspect.ismethod(P.is_lattice)
True
sage: inspect.isfunction(P.is_lattice)
False
```

OK. Now I tried to read `incidence_structures.py` and copypaste it to `finite_posets.py`. It start with

```
r"""
Finite posets

List of functions:

{METHODS_OF_FinitePosets}
"""
```

and ends

```
from sage.misc.rest_index_of_methods import gen_rest_table_index
__doc__ = __doc__.format(METHODS_OF_FinitePosets=gen_rest_table_index(FinitePosets))
```

There might be no problem at all for clever people, but I do not understand.

That's because of the syntax of python's format thing:

```
sage: "a is {a} and b is {b}".format(a=4,b=5)
'a is 4 and b is 5'
```

Then you have to know that `__doc__` is the name of the module's docstring (the string that starts with 'Finite posets'. And then `gen_rest_table_index` does its job from the class that you give it.

I don't mind your telling me that it is not clear or has to be explained in the developer's manual: it would be cool if we don't have to explain how python works there, though. 

But then perhaps those details should not appear in the developer's manual but rather on the module's doc of this `rest_index_of_methods` module.

I guess the question is whether we really want widespread use of a hack that does large-ish string processing at each import (including during Sage startup).

An example for how to do things right is http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/nddata/index.html, the auto-generated class table at the bottom is created only once while running sphinx to build the docs.

Not at all. The question here is whether you want the interface of this code to be documented, so that people can use it.

How it is implemented is a different problem, and you are most welcome to help if you think that it should be written differently.

Back to this one...

I would not say "Optionally, the module's documentation can include a list - -", but something like "Module documentation should include a list of all functions. If there are only few of them, the list can be generated - -".

Maybe after example it could also say something like "The list will not contain functions that are deprecated or whose name start with underscore." I am not sure if this is good addition or just noise.

After "An index of **all methods** of a specific class - -" add "There is no automatic way to get a list of all functions defined in a module containing several classes."

"When a class/module defines many methods/functions it can become interesting - -" should be "When a class/module defines many methods/functions the list should be grouped thematically - -".

Otherwise I think that I have now understood how to use this and what can be done with automatic indexing.

Well, to me this is more documentation specific to the reference manual. There is a link toward the rest_index_of_methods module that people can follow, and see what is there. So what you say is necessary <somewhere> but I don't personall believe it must be here.

> After "An index of **all methods** of a specific class - -" add "There is no automatic way to get a list of all functions defined in a module containing several classes."

Errr... This sentence is 'wrong', technically. A function, by definition, does not belong to a class. A method, by definition, belongs to a class. You want to say that you cannot have one big table that mixes together the methods of different classes? That's rather expected, isn't it?.. `:-P`

Sorry, same reason. I don't want to use 'should' here. I don't mind making tools available, though I don't want to force people to use them. Especially when some don't like them.

Actually I would like to have a kind of rule that new modules must have an index. Not necessarily made with this, but somehow.
