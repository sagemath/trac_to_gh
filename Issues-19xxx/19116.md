Now that we have #19101, we should change `sage -p` (the low-level command to install a single package) to stop checking whether the package is already installed: all dependency checking should be moved to `build/make/Makefile`, used by `sage -i`.

If `-p` is to always force a reinstall, then it doesn't behave the same as `-i` (and if I read your changes correctly, `-p` does not support the `-f` option). Would you be opposed to being explicit about `-p` and the options it supports in `advanced`?

Of course not. We wouldn't have two `-i` and `-p` options if they behaved the same.

I'll think about your "help" suggestion.
