More or less. The current generic code (from `sage.structure.parent`) tries to compare the tuple with the corresponding object of the cartesian product. And they of course compare as different:

```
sage: C = cartesian_product([srange(5), srange(5)])
sage: c = C((1,1))
sage: c
(1, 1)
sage: c == (1,1)
False
sage: (1,1) == c
False
```

Warning: your example is completely broken

```
sage: C = cartesian_product([range(5), range(5)])
sage: C((1r,1r))
(1, 1)
sage: C((1,1))
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: Cannot convert int to sage.structure.element.Element
```

Warning++: you can not use `range` and `srange` in the same Sage session since `FiniteEnumeratedSet` uses `UniqueRepresentation`... I guess a safer way to implement this unique representation, would be to force a common universe for the elements... (see #19562)

They are just wrappers around tuples, and at times, it is beneficial to not wrap/unwrap such objects, such as if the Cartesian product is the set of keys of a dict/Family.

Then in that case I would actually implement an option in `CartesianProduct` to actually **use** tuples directly.

```
sage: C = cartesian_product([range(5), range(5)], with_elements_as_tuple=True)

<type 'tuple'>
```
Though, I am just asking for your opinion. I am not considering it good for inclusion in this ticket.

On the other hand, with your laxism with respect to tuples the equality test is about 3x slower. We had

```
sage: C = cartesian_product([srange(5), srange(5)])
sage: c = C((1,1))
sage: d = C((1,1))
sage: e = C((1,2))
sage: %timeit c == d and c == e
1000000 loops, best of 3: 327 ns per loop
```
And with your branch

```
sage: %timeit c == d and c == e
100000 loops, best of 3: 1.93 µs per loop
```
If the comparison has to be touched, it has to be at the level of `ElementWrapper`. Probably a new class.

<a id='comment:19'></a>Ahh...the speed of Cython. I created a new class in between `ElementWrapper` and `CartesianProduct.Element` that has specialized equality comparisons against the wrapped class.

Current:

```
sage: C = cartesian_product([ZZ, ZZ])
sage: c = C((1, 1))
sage: d = C((1, 1))
sage: e = C((1, 2))
sage: %timeit c == d
1000000 loops, best of 3: 183 ns per loop
sage: %timeit c == e
10000000 loops, best of 3: 183 ns per loop
```
vs old:

```
sage: %timeit c == d
1000000 loops, best of 3: 175 ns per loop
sage: %timeit c == e
10000000 loops, best of 3: 179 ns per loop
```
So we might loose up to ~2%, but I think this will get lost in noise if someone is doing Cartesian products of things with any harder comparison operators. (Although IMO the previous slowdown would likely have been negligible in computations (at least I would recommend using `itertools` and `tuple`s if this was an issue)).

As suggested in the parenthetical, if you wanted this to be a facade parent for tuples, which is I think what you would end up with, then you likely could just use `itertools`.

But itertools does not care about `rank`, `unrank`, `__contains__`. Python iterators might not be rich enough.
