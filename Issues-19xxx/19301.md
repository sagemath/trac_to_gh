This branch improves the algorithm behind `Graph.complement()`, which currently calls `has_edge(u,v)` for every pair of points.

With this, the computation of the complement is done on a dense graph, as it should.

Before

```
sage: g=graphs.PaleyGraph(1009)
sage: %time g.complement()
CPU times: user 2.14 s, sys: 64 ms, total: 2.2 s
Wall time: 2.14 s
complement(Paley graph with parameter 1009): Graph on 1009 vertices
```

After

```
sage: %time g.complement()
CPU times: user 164 ms, sys: 12 ms, total: 176 ms
Wall time: 160 ms
complement(Paley graph with parameter 1009): Graph on 1009 vertices
```

In dense_graph.pyx, this branch mostly does the following:
- Turn 'radix' and radix_mod_mask' into module variables (they do not depend on the instance)
- remove 'radix_div_shift'. This variable is meant to turn a division by radix into a shift. As radix is determined at compile-time, the compiler already does this simplification (for free)
- Turn multiplication/division by powers of two from 'shift' to multiplication/division. The code is easier to read, and the compiled binary is the same anyway.
- Uses calloc (instead of malloc) to initialize memory. This is slightly wasteful, and the code is much cleaner as a result.

Yo !

Yeah, me too. I have been giving a bad look to this `complement` function for a long time now, as it was clearly wasteful. Incidentally, this will "produce" many graphs with a 'dense' backend, while they are mostly non-existent in Sage nowadays. Perhaps new bugs related to this backend will pop out, or none if we are lucky.

> However, there is a small issue:

Arg, right. There were *two* checks for multiple edges in the same function, so I removed one but the error message changed. Will be fixed in a second.

Why don't you use `check_allocarray` or `MemoryAllocator`?
