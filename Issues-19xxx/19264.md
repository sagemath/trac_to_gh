When we want to design a Hopf algebra, we ask "Where can I find a good code?" and the first idea is "The symmetric functions..." Wrong... 

In this ticket I try to provide a simple and efficient design such that this becomes fast to implement a graded connected hopf algebra (see: `sage.combinat.hopf_algebras.example.fqsym.py`).

Mike, could you read the code of this file such that we discuss about the design? Other comments are welcome...
