Everything seems to be already done in graphs... I CC Nathann because I just noticed at #19118 the function

```
g.subgraph(vertices=g.cores(k=2)[1])
```

So propably there is some very easy way to make this.

​​​Frédéric? Someone? This is quite easy one.

Would be nice if at 2016-01-07 I could say that this will be at Sage version 6.10. I will mention dismantlable lattices then in a little talk.

ok, good to go. I have put the code into pep8 standard.

If you approve my small changes, you can set to positive review.

By the way, please avoid the final underscores in your branch names, as it makes rather hard to copy/paste. Better to keep the branch names short and simple, I would say.

I did, and also put your name to reviewer field.

That this was generated name from `git trac`, I guess. I will try to use better names from now on. And maybe some day I will remember to use PEP 8 standard...

Thanks - for this, and for many other reviews.
