Currently, the `....:` doctest continuation lines are not parsed correctly by Pygments. As a consequence, those lines are not syntax highlighted.

We should also investigate if we can extend Pygments without patching it and whether the highlighting for Sage can be pushed upstream.

Depends on #19968

I think this has been solved. `src/sage/docs/conf.py` has the lines

```
# Default lexer to use when highlighting code blocks, using the IPython
# console lexers. 'ipycon' is the IPython console, which is what we want
# for most code blocks: anything with "sage:" prompts. For other IPython,
# like blocks which might appear in a notebook cell, use 'ipython'.
highlighting.lexers['ipycon'] = IPythonConsoleLexer(in1_regex=r'sage: ', in2_regex=r'[.][.][.][.]: ')
highlighting.lexers['ipython'] = IPyLexer()
highlight_language = 'ipycon'
```
and in particular, `in2_regex` defines `....:` as syntax for an input prompt. The documentation looks okay to me: [here for example](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/matrices/sage/matrix/matrix0.html#sage.matrix.matrix0.Matrix.str).

More evidence: if you look at the html source, with the highlighting code in place, "sage:" and "....:" are labeled as, for example:

```
<span class="gp">....: </span>
```
and looking at the file basic.css, "gp" stands for "generic prompt". Without the highlighting code (that is, if you make the change in the previous comment), the whole line instead is marked `class="go"`, and "go" stands for "generic output".

I suppose we could write a doctest for this, but I don't have the energy right now.
