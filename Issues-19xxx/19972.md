Currently, the `....:` doctest continuation lines are not parsed correctly by Pygments. As a consequence, those lines are not syntax highlighted.

We should also investigate if we can extend Pygments without patching it and whether the highlighting for Sage can be pushed upstream.

<a id='comment:5'></a>More evidence: if you look at the html source, with the highlighting code in place, "sage:" and "....:" are labeled as, for example:

```
<span class="gp">....: </span>

and looking at the file basic.css, "gp" stands for "generic prompt". Without the highlighting code (that is, if you make the change in the previous comment), the whole line instead is marked `class="go"`, and "go" stands for "generic output".

I suppose we could write a doctest for this, but I don't have the energy right now.
