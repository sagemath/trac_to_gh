They are used in a lot of places and should be cythonized. With my branch, I get ~10% speedup of my operations. Moreover, the class hierarchy for matrix group elements can and needs to be changed in order to do this. Specifically, I removed the `MatrixGroupElement_base` (the `AffineGroupElement` overrode all but 1 method) and `GroupElementMixinLibGAP` (only used by `MatrixGroupElement_gap`).

<a id='comment:5'></a>For `MatrixGroupElement_generic` the `__invert__` is very bad since it actually **does** a copy. If you have a matrix over `ZZ` its inverse belongs to matrices over `QQ`.

```
sage: m = matrix(3, [6, -1, -22, -5, 1, 18, -2, -4, 17])
sage: m.inverse().parent()
Full MatrixSpace of 3 by 3 dense matrices over Rational Field
```
Hence it would be better to use `change_ring` before the wrapping.

On the other hand there exists `_invert_unit()`. Compare

```
sage: m = matrix(3, [6, -1, -22, -5, 1, 18, -2, -4, 17])
sage: %timeit m.inverse().change_ring(ZZ)
10000 loops, best of 3: 53.7 µs per loop
sage: %timeit m._invert_unit()
100000 loops, best of 3: 6.56 µs per loop
