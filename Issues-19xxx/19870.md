They are used in a lot of places and should be cythonized. With my branch, I get ~10% speedup of my operations. Moreover, the class hierarchy for matrix group elements can and needs to be changed in order to do this. Specifically, I removed the `MatrixGroupElement_base` (the `AffineGroupElement` overrode all but 1 method) and `GroupElementMixinLibGAP` (only used by `MatrixGroupElement_gap`).

While this new structure has some near-duplication by not using the calls to `matrix()`, it does away with a diamond problem and has fewer function calls overall by accessing the internal structure when necessary. Moreover, the original doctests for `MatrixGroupElement_generic` were not actually testing that class.

<div id="comment:5" align="right">Comment 5</div>

For `MatrixGroupElement_generic` the `__invert__` is very bad since it actually **does** a copy. If you have a matrix over `ZZ` its inverse belongs to matrices over `QQ`.

```
sage: m = matrix(3, [6, -1, -22, -5, 1, 18, -2, -4, 17])
sage: m.inverse().parent()
Full MatrixSpace of 3 by 3 dense matrices over Rational Field
```
Hence it would be better to use `change_ring` before the wrapping.

On the other hand there exists `_invert_unit()`. Compare

```
sage: m = matrix(3, [6, -1, -22, -5, 1, 18, -2, -4, 17])
sage: %timeit m.inverse().change_ring(ZZ)
10000 loops, best of 3: 53.7 µs per loop
sage: %timeit m._invert_unit()
100000 loops, best of 3: 6.56 µs per loop
```

It turns out that `_invert_unit` is only applicable to dense matrices over `\\ZZ`, but it deserves a special case since checking if the base ring (in python) is less than 100 ns on my machine. I also made sure that the result lives in the base ring it should (which covers the sparse `\\ZZ` case).",

<div id="comment:7" align="right">Comment 7</div>

At some point we do have to make a copy of the underlying matrix, and we can't modify `self._matrix`. It turns out that `_invert_unit` is only applicable to dense matrices over `\ZZ`, but it deserves a special case since checking if the base ring (in python) is less than 100 ns on my machine. I also made sure that the result lives in the base ring it should (which covers the sparse `\ZZ` case).
