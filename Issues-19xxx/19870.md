They are used in a lot of places and should be cythonized. With my branch, I get ~10% speedup of my operations. Moreover, the class hierarchy for matrix group elements can and needs to be changed in order to do this. Specifically, I removed the `MatrixGroupElement_base` (the `AffineGroupElement` overrode all but 1 method) and `GroupElementMixinLibGAP` (only used by `MatrixGroupElement_gap`).

While this new structure has some near-duplication by not using the calls to `matrix()`, it does away with a diamond problem and has fewer function calls overall by accessing the internal structure when necessary. Moreover, the original doctests for `MatrixGroupElement_generic` were not actually testing that class.

For `MatrixGroupElement_generic` the `__invert__` is very bad since it actually **does** a copy. If you have a matrix over `ZZ` its inverse belongs to matrices over `QQ`.

```
sage: m = matrix(3, [6, -1, -22, -5, 1, 18, -2, -4, 17])
sage: m.inverse().parent()
Full MatrixSpace of 3 by 3 dense matrices over Rational Field
```
Hence it would be better to use `change_ring` before the wrapping.

On the other hand there exists `_invert_unit()`. Compare

```
sage: m = matrix(3, [6, -1, -22, -5, 1, 18, -2, -4, 17])
sage: %timeit m.inverse().change_ring(ZZ)
10000 loops, best of 3: 53.7 µs per loop
sage: %timeit m._invert_unit()
100000 loops, best of 3: 6.56 µs per loop
```

Why not

```
try:

except AttributeError:
    M = ~M
    if M.base_ring() is not parent.base_ring():
        M = M.change_ring(parent.base_ring())

The exception handling is slower when it has to occur:

```python
def foo(M):
    try:                                    
        return M._invert_unit()
    except AttributeError:
        return ~M

def bar(M):
    if M.base_ring() is ZZ and M.is_dense():
        return M._invert_unit()
    else:                 
        return ~M
```

```
sage: M = random_matrix(ZZ, 3, 3, sparse=True)
sage: M.det()
-1
sage: %timeit foo(M)
The slowest run took 15.06 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
1000 loops, best of 3: 643 µs per loop
sage: %timeit bar(M)
1000 loops, best of 3: 639 µs per loop
sage: M = random_matrix(QQ, 3, 3)
sage: M.det()
1
sage: %timeit foo(M)
The slowest run took 20.62 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
100000 loops, best of 3: 10.4 µs per loop
sage: %timeit bar(M)
The slowest run took 17.06 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
100000 loops, best of 3: 7.5 µs per loop
```
However, it is faster when no exception is generated:

```
sage: M = random_matrix(ZZ, 3, 3)
sage: M.det()
1
sage: %timeit foo(M)
The slowest run took 16.19 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
100000 loops, best of 3: 4.39 µs per loop
sage: %timeit bar(M)
The slowest run took 11.94 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
100000 loops, best of 3: 4.61 µs per loop
```
Yet, I don't think that is enough of a speedup to justify the other cases (in particular, the `\QQ` example).

1. I think you should add a `.pxd` file such that other Cython modules can `cimport` this if needed.

2. Use the standard [copyright template](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#headings-of-sage-library-code-files).

3. Remove `__cmp__ = _cmp_` twice (it doesn't work and it's not needed).

4. You don't actually use this: `from sage.structure.element import have_same_parent`.

5. There is not much point in making `matrix()` a `cpdef` method: you can just directly access the `_matrix` attribute from Cython.
