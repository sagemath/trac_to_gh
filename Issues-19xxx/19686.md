P = Posets.PentagonPoset()
print P.principal_order_ideal(3)
print P.principal_lower_set(3)
print P.order_ideal([3])

```

gives

```
[0, 2, 3]
[0, 2, 3]
[0, 2, 3]
TypeError: 'NotImplementedType' object is not callable
```

And this seems like a bug. Same applies to `upper_set`.

Good point: the alias `lower_set` -> `order_ideal` as implemented in the category `Posets.ParentMethods.lower_set` does not work. One probably needs to write it as
a trivial method which calls `order_ideal`. The same issue applies to `upper_set`.

By the way: the rationale for those aliases is that, in the long run, I am in favor of migrating from `order_ideal` to `lower_set`: the former is ambiguous with two distinct widely accepted meanings in the community.

Note: this is about (the abstract classes for) posets ; not to the category infrastructure.

I never remember which one is "ideal" and which "filter". Hence "lower (/upper) set" is better. OTOH the order ideals lattice of a poset is established term.

Yep. But you may know what to do with `@abstract_method` that seems to be the difference between `lower_set` and `principal_lower_set`. I do not.

<div id="comment:4" align="right">Comment 4</div>

What you think about this? At least now `lower_set` and `upper_set` seems to work.

There is also `is_order_filter` (and `...ideal`). They should be changed too, if we make `[lower|upper]_set()` the preferred name.

I would like to see html docs with functions like this hidden. Just like we now have deprecated function removed, we should have a way to hide non-preferred alias names.

(The patch contains also one-letter typo correction for another file.)

Frédéric? Few lines long patch, but is there something against this kind of "alias-defining" function?

Of course the file should have index of functions etc, but at least this will correct a clear bug.

I would rather remove the not-working aliases.

Otherwise, if you create new functions as you propose (that I find rather ugly), to ensure 100% coverage, you have to duplicate the doctests.

The best solution would of course to make sure that the aliases just work as they are written currently.

It is of course OK, supposing that this has never worked. Or actually not at least for normal deprecation period. Here is a removal patch.

There is of course a sligth inconsistency with existing `principal_lower_set`, but that can be thinked later.
