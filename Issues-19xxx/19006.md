Following #19005 we use flint functions for `exp`/`log`/`sin`/... of polynomials. This only concerns polynomials over `QQ` (for which the flint type is `fmpq_poly`).

The restriction is part of the definition of the series. The type of errors might be documented though. But as these are private function (ie intended for programmers) with very short code it is easy to find out what these are.

Not really: for example, `(1+x).exp_series()` might very well return `exp(1) + exp(1)*x + 1/2*exp(1)*x^2 + ...`. But I agree that it is less of an issue if the methods are private.
