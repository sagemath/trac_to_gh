It needs a little work to change "abelian" to "Abelian", as some of the strings are generated. This is kind of spin-off from #19753.

There is no compelling reason to change "abelian" to "Abelian". I think this should be closed.

Not a big thing, but this would be consistent with for example #19788. At least Wikipedia uses always caps for Abelian, Hamiltonian etc.

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelian_group#A_note_on_the_typography.

That is, I don't think there is consistency in the mathematical world for the capitalization, or not, of "abelian".
