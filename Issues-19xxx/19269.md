`ZZ` and `QQ` should have the category `Posets` as well.

Hola,

We should try to make the cartesian products of copies of `ZZ` compatible with the current behavior of `ZZ^n` (actually, I would feel more confortable if `cartesian_product([ZZ,ZZ])` would return `ZZ^2`). But vectors are compared with respect to the lexicographic ordering

```
sage: V = ZZ^2
sage: my_list = [V((i,j)) for i in range(3) for j in range(3)]
[(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2)]
```
So it is not (strictly speaking) a cartesian product of posets. Several solutions:
- change the behavior of comparisons for vectors
  - modify `richcmp` to be the product order and keep `cmp` to be the lexicographic ordering in order to keep the sort feature... we will have some Python3 troubles later on
  - break the sort operation
- find a compromise with respect to the order of the product (how?)

Having so many category for `ZZ` might also be a problem when it comes to morphisms. What should be

```
sage: Hom(ZZ,ZZ)
sage: Hom(ZZ^2, ZZ^2)
```
In the category of `Euclidean domains + Posets` there are few elements! And most of the time, when people think about `ZZ^2` they do not care about the poset structure. Something likethe following should work out of the box

```
sage: Hom(ZZ^2, ZZ^2, Posets())
sage: Hom(ZZ^2, ZZ^2, Modules(ZZ))
```
My question is about the default behavior of `Hom` with this multiple categories.

Vincent

Indeed, it was a question... One possibility: make some priorities for the `Hom` functor in `sage.categories.homset`.

Currently, to deduce the category of `Hom(X,Y)` the functor does `X.category()._meet_(Y.category())` which is documented as being "the largest common subcategory of self and other". Instead of `_meet_` one could try to implement a more dedicated method that forget some of the categories (such as the Poset one if there is some algebraic structure).
