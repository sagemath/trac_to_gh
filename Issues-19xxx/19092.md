This ticket implements tangent vectors and tangent spaces on differentiable manifolds. This is a follow-up of #18843 within the [SageManifolds project](http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/) (see the metaticket #18528 for an overview). As in #18843, the non-discrete topological field K over which the differentiable manifold is defined is generic, although in most applications, K=**R** or K=**C**.

This ticket implements the following Python classes:
- the parent class `TangentSpace` for tangent spaces to a differentiable manifold
- the element class `TangentVector` for tangent vectors to a differentiable manifold
It also implements 
- the method `at()` in tensor field classes (introduced in #18843) to take the value of a given
  tensor field (in particular a vector field) at a given point;  the method `at()` is
  implemented for vector frames and coframes as well. 
- the method `plot()` in class `VectorField`, to get some graphical representations of vector
  fields 
- the methods `differential()`, `differential_functions()` and `jacobian_matrix()` to the class 
  `DiffMap` introduced in #18783 (differential of a map between differentiable manifolds at a
  given point).

<a id='comment:33'></a>Thank you so much for the review!

In the first commit above (23eb9d8), I've corrected a doctest error and fixed some documentation issue revealed by the patchbot.

In the second commit (b4a4530), I've added sphinx directives to render the 3D plots in the documentation of `VectorField.plot` (as well as in `RealChart.plot`), on the same footing as what is now done in the "3D Graphics" section of the reference manual.

Thanks for the addition of ``@`options` to `VectorField.plot`; I've added `color` to these options, to be consistent with what is done in `RealChart.plot`. I've also added some documentation about the use of `v.plot.options`.

A question: in the keyword arguments of `VectorField.plot`, you have changed `nb_values` to `number_values`, but it is still `nb_values` in `RealChart.plot`. For consistency, both plot methods should use the same name. It seems that *nb* is not a standard English abbreviation for *number*, is it? (I find `number_values` a little bit long, especially that we don't have the TAB completion to type the options).

Not a problem; sorry it took so long.

Not to my knowledge. The standard abbreviation is "no." (with a period) but "num" has become standard (at least in the programming world), but IMO the verbosity is better. However, you can do tab completion for explicit arguments.
