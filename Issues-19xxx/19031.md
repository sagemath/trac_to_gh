This is the first draft of this new closeness centrality algorithm. It is able to conclude in reasonable time even on very big graphs, with millions of nodes and billions of edges. The new algorithm is in the last commit (while all previous commits simply merge with dependent tickets).

In method `_estimate_reachable_vertices_dir`
- `The lower bound is stored in reachableL[v]` -> `The lower bound is stored in reachL[v]`
- Although the method will not be tested, could you please add an `INPUT` section specifying the type and expected size of arrays. You could also briefly document the algorithm implemented in the method.

- What's the need for using type `uint64_t` instead of `int`? the corresponding variables are later cast to `int`.
- You could use `maxscc = max(scc_sizes[i] for i in range(nscc)`

For method `_compute_reachable_vertices_undir`, you should add some documentation at the beginning of the method.

Method counting sort: no comment, but in the future we should certainly create a method somewhere.

In method `def centrality_closeness_top_k(G, int k=1, int verb=0)`
- `verb` -> `verbose`
- the tests for the validity of the results are excessive. There is no need for the loop `range(1000)`. Testing for *one* randomly chosen graph with say `n=20` nodes and `random.randint(1, n*(n-1) / 2)` edges is sufficient.
- we can do that `for x in sorted_vert[:n]:` when `sorted_vert` is an array of ints ???

- when `stopped == True` you don't quit the `for j in range(layer_current_beginning,layer_current_end):`. May be you should replace this loop with a while.
- you set `gamma = 0`. So you need `gamma==1` only once for undirected graphs. Correct?

Well, it's a bit tricky. The point is that in the recursion for `reachU_scc` I might find values that are much bigger than `g.n`.

I don't think so, `maxscc` is not the maximum size of a SCC, but it is the SCC with maximum size. In other words, your instruction outputs `scc_sizes[maxscc]`, not `maxscc`. Am I missing something?

Agree!

> In method `def centrality_closeness_top_k(G, int k=1, int verb=0)`
> - `verb` -> `verbose`


Done!

Done! I left it because I had to test it 100,000 times to find the last bug...

> - we can do that `for x in sorted_vert[:n]:` when `sorted_vert` is an array of ints ???


Yep: !http://docs.cython.org/src/reference/language_basics.html

> - `if directed: gamma = 0  else: gamma = 1 ` -> `gamma = 0 if directed else 1`


Done!

> - when `stopped == True` you don't quit the `for j in range(layer_current_beginning,layer_current_end):`. May be you should replace this loop with a while.


I added an 'if' at the end of the loop.

> - you set `gamma = 0`. So you need `gamma==1` only once for undirected graphs. Correct?


Hmm, correct, but I realized that I could do a little better by slightly changing the implementation. So this does not apply anymore.

Right, it should be `maxscc = max((scc_sizes[i],i) for i in range(nscc))[1]`, but this is ugly.

That's a lot!
However, I don't like the `n = random.randint(2,20)`. You could safely let `n=20`, no?

That's funny.
 
Can we always assume that `farness[v]>0`? This is for the `return sorted([(1.0/farness[v],...`. 

Instead of `G.vertices()[v]`, you should add a line like `cdef list V = G.vertices()` before the return statement and then use `V[v]`. 


About the behavior when `k>=n`. What you propose is in fact to return the centrality closeness (as a list of couples (centrality,vertex) ). 
- Is your method faster than `centrality_closeness` in this case?
- This behavior should be documented for the parameter `k`

That's all for now ;)

David.

Done!

Yep.

The only instructions that modify the farness are `farness[x] = n` (if a visit is stopped) and `farness[x] = ((<double> f) * (n-1)) / (<double>(nd-1) * (nd-1))`, where `f` is a (positive) sum of distances, `nd-1` is positive because `nd` is the number of reachable vertices from a vertex `x`. If `nd==1`, it means that the out-degree of `x` is 0, and we skip the analysis of `x`, so this case never occurs. Then, `n>=nd`, and hence also `n-1` is positive.

> Instead of `G.vertices()[v]`, you should add a line like `cdef list V = G.vertices()` before the return statement and then use `V[v]`.


Done!

No, it should be the same (actually, a bit slower because we make some computations during the BFSes).

> - This behavior should be documented for the parameter `k`


Done!

So you should add a test `if k>=n` at the beginning of the method and if True call the other method and format the result. You could also add a test `n==0` and/or `n==1` where the result is obvious.

<a id='comment:19'></a>Michele,

in this tests, nodes 2 and 7 are both correct answers since we have:
- on a 64bit machine (i.e. my laptop)

```
sage: from sage.graphs.centrality import centrality_closeness_top_k
sage: g = graphs.PathGraph(10)
sage: centrality_closeness_top_k(g, 5, 1)
Final performance ratio: 0.766666666667
[(0.36, 5),
 (0.36, 4),
 (0.3333333333333333, 6),
 (0.3333333333333333, 3),
 (0.29032258064516125, 2)]
sage: g.centrality_closeness()
{0: 0.2,
 1: 0.24324324324324326,
 2: 0.2903225806451613,
 3: 0.3333333333333333,
 4: 0.36,
 5: 0.36,
 6: 0.3333333333333333,
 7: 0.2903225806451613,
 8: 0.24324324324324326,
 9: 0.2}
```
- on a 32 bits computer (old desktop)

```
sage: from sage.graphs.centrality import centrality_closeness_top_k
sage: g = graphs.PathGraph(10)
sage: centrality_closeness_top_k(g, 5, 1)
Final performance ratio: 0.805555555556
[(0.36, 5),
 (0.36, 4),
 (0.3333333333333333, 6),
 (0.3333333333333333, 3),
 (0.29032258064516125, 7)]
sage: g.centrality_closeness()
{0: 0.2,
 1: 0.24324324324324326,
 2: 0.2903225806451613,
 3: 0.3333333333333333,
 4: 0.36,
 5: 0.36,
 6: 0.3333333333333333,
 7: 0.2903225806451613,
 8: 0.24324324324324326,
 9: 0.2}
```
The good point is that the numbers are the same on both machines ;)

One part of the solution is to call `centrality_closeness_top_k(g, 4, 1)`.

However, for the performance ratio it is more difficult.
In fact, we have `visited=138` on my mac, and `visited=145` on the 32 bits computer. So we have to understand what could change the number of visited nodes depending on 32-64 bits.

David.

<a id='comment:22'></a>Hello!

I have installed Sage on a 32bit Virtual Machine: the problem was a comparison between (equal) doubles, and probably due to roundings the error popped out. Indeed, both results were correct. 

By asking only top-4 in the doctest, we avoid such comparisons, and everything works.

Thank you very much!

Michele
