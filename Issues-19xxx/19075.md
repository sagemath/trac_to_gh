Currently, generating the first level of the Kleber tree grows poorly as the rank and the complexity of the root system increases. This is due to the fact that it uses all positive roots. Instead we use integral points (when expressed as simple roots) in the intersection of the negative root cone and a shifted positive weight cone.

Also due to the number of operations involved, this ticket changes all lower levels to use the polytope enumeration for small rank unless normaliz is available.

Depends on #22938

With the branch, we have (on SMC):

```
sage: %time RiggedConfigurations(['E',8,1], [[8,1]]).module_generators
CPU times: user 384 ms, sys: 80 ms, total: 464 ms
Wall time: 430 ms
```
whereas previously this took

```
sage: %time RiggedConfigurations(['E',8,1], [[8,1]]).module_generators
CPU times: user 23.9 s, sys: 72 ms, total: 24 s
Wall time: 24.5 s
```
As an added benefit, this allows us to combine the children iterators into a single method.

To note, from looking over the profiling data, the majority of time is devoted to doing arithmetic using combinatorial free modules and just taking so long due to the sheer number of calculations.

It seems like on small rank, this is slower change is ~3-5x slower:

```
sage: RC = RiggedConfigurations(['D',4,1], [[4,2], [1,3], [2,4]])
sage: %time len(RC.module_generators)
CPU times: user 928 ms, sys: 84 ms, total: 1.01 s
Wall time: 1.47 s
586
```
vs the current version:

```
sage: %time len(RC.module_generators)
CPU times: user 340 ms, sys: 4 ms, total: 344 ms
Wall time: 348 ms
586
```
But for larger rank, it still is faster:

```
sage: RC = RiggedConfigurations(['D',8,1], [[4,2], [1,3], [2,4]])
sage: %time len(RC.module_generators)
CPU times: user 38.4 s, sys: 148 ms, total: 38.6 s
Wall time: 40.7 s
19234
```
vs I didn't have the patience to wait.

More data:

```
sage: RC = RiggedConfigurations(['D',6,1], [[4,6]])
sage: %time len(RC.module_generators)
CPU times: user 392 ms, sys: 56 ms, total: 448 ms
Wall time: 648 ms
28
```
previous:

```
sage: %time len(RC.module_generators)
CPU times: user 1.46 s, sys: 0 ns, total: 1.46 s
Wall time: 1.52 s
28
```

For F<sub>4</sub><sup>(1)</sup>, I get the new version is 2-20x faster for B<sup>i,1</sup>, where i = 1,2,3,4.

The question then becomes should we deal with the slowdown in small ranks, or keep both algorithms and have a heuristic which chooses between the two?

From doing some more testing, as soon as the rank hits 7, the children iterator by using integer points of polytopes is faster than going over all possible up roots. I'm fairly certain this will hold true for all cases as this was true for even small examples in type A (the `use_uproot` was just an extra parameter I added for testing):

```
sage: from sage.combinat.rigged_configurations.kleber_tree import KleberTree

This is blazingly fast with normaliz (i.e. with the optional spkg `pynormaliz`):

```
sage: %time [len(RiggedConfigurations(['E',8,1], [[r,1]]).module_generators) for r in [1,.

Without it, the B<sup>4,1</sup> takes longer than I want to wait for it (and nearly impossible without this branch).

HTML and PDF docs build and all tests passed on my machine.

One question/comment before giving a positive review:  Should the following tests have the `#long time` tag removed?

```
sage: from sage.combinat.rigged_configurations.kleber_tree import KleberTree
sage: KT = KleberTree(['E', 6, 1], [[4, 2]])  # long time (9s on sage.math, 2012)
sage: KT.cardinality()  # long time
12
```

Both of these calculations are now immediate with this update.

I think they are only immediate when using `normaliz`, so I'm not yet ready to remove them.
