For testing and demonstration it's sometimes useful to be able to get "any" element of a cone. Other structures use `random_element` for the same purpose.

In the end comment "coercion" is not the right word - it is what happens automatically when mixing objects. Explicit one is "conversion".

I am a bit unsure about rationality. Seems like returning a random element of the lattice would be more natural and those who want can then scale by a rational or even real factor. Or there could be an optional parameter for this, defaulting to all integral weights?

This wouldn't be too bad but it makes all of my uses of it ugly. Each invocation is `K.random_element()` versus `QQ.random_element().abs()*vector(K.random_element())`.

I'm using rationals because some of the properties I'm testing involve norms (say, in a denominator) where you really want to test a value between zero and one.

This would be no problem, but how should the return type work? If we use integral weights we could return a lattice element but with any other field it would have to be a vector.

I definitely would like to get an appropriate lattice element for (default) integral weights and with anything else a vector is fine, that's consistent with other places that attempt to work with lattices but fall back to generic vectors/modules when this is not possible/implemented.

That works for me; it only adds two characters to most invocations.

I decided to limit the possible choices to `ZZ`/`QQ` for a few reasons. First, for "nonnegative" to make any sense, we need to have a subthing of `RR`. But `RR.is_subring(RR)` doesn't work, and more importantly, the resulting elements don't live in either the cone's lattice or its ambient vector space. That means matrix multiplication (on the ambient space) might crash even though `K.contains(x)` still returns `True`.

Maybe it makes more sense to have e.g. `latticial=True` instead of `ring=ZZ` when there are only two choices (ambient lattice or ambient vector space)?
