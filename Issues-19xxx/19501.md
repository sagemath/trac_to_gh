outputs

Also indentation is wrong in proof-keyword.

This gives three errors:

```
File "src/sage/tests/cmdline.py", line 106, in sage.tests.cmdline.test_executable
Failed example:
    out.find(version()) >= 0
Expected:
    True
Got:
    False
```

I suppose those do not relate to this patch and so mark this as needs_review.
