brings up

```
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    CoercionException: Infinite loop in action of Growth Group QQ^x * x^QQ (parent <class 'sage.rings.asymptotic.growth_group_cartesian.UnivariateProduct_with_category'>) and Growth Group ZZ^x * x^QQ (parent <class 'sage.rings.asymptotic.growth_group_cartesian.UnivariateProduct_with_category'>)!
```
It is caught, so it does not make a problem at all, but IMHO shouldn't be there.

Depends on #19083
