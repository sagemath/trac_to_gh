```
It seems in some cases the infinities returned from mpmath need to be changed by the function's `evalf()` in order to be correct:
Before:

```
sage: zeta(SR(1))
Infinity
sage: zeta(SR(1.))   <---------
+infinity
sage: type(zeta(SR(1)))
<type 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression'>
sage: type(zeta(SR(1)).pyobject())
<class 'sage.rings.infinity.UnsignedInfinity'>
sage: type(zeta(SR(1.)))
<type 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression'>
sage: type(zeta(SR(1.)).pyobject())
<type 'sage.rings.real_mpfr.RealNumber'>
```

The ticket should result in:

```
sage: zeta(SR(1))
Infinity
sage: zeta(SR(1.))
Infinity
sage: type(zeta(SR(1)))
<type 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression'>
sage: type(zeta(SR(1)).pyobject())
<class 'sage.rings.infinity.UnsignedInfinity'>
sage: type(zeta(SR(1.)))
<type 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression'>
sage: type(zeta(SR(1.)).pyobject())
<class 'sage.rings.infinity.UnsignedInfinity'>
```

Ideally, fix other such cases too in this ticket.

Depends on #22838

Polylog uses zeta here, so it's mainly because of `RR(1).zeta()` not being converted in `symbolic/function.pyx` or the `RR` functions not using the `InfinityRing` elements.
