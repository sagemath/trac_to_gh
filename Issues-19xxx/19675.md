It makes no sense that `normalize_names` appears in the TAB-completion of all `CategoryObject`s. It also makes little sense that it's a *method* of `CategoryObject`. 

1. Move `normalize_names` and `_certify_names` out of `CategoryObject` and make them non-method functions.

2. Remove the redundant `parent_gens.normalize_names`, `parent_gens._certify_names`, `parent.normalize_names` and `sage.schemes.toric.variety.certify_names`.

3. Always interpret `ngens=-1` as "unknown number of generators" and `ngens=0` as "no generators". The previous implementation did this inconsistently.

4. Add doctests.

Note that many more classes should probably use `normalize_names`. I didn't fix this here. Example from `src/sage/algebras/jordan_algebra.py`:

```
        if names is not None:
            if isinstance(names, str):
                names = names.split(',')
            names = tuple(names)
```
