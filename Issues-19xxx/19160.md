Note: This branch is currently added on top of Sage version 8.2 Master

Add a new class SnakeGraphs and SnakeGraph. 

A snake graph is a connected sequence of square tiles which goes north and east. For example of where snake graphs come up in mathematics, see the following articles:
* :arxiv:`0906.0748`
* :arxiv:`abs/1209.4617`

Note: 
* A SnakeGraph class only has the attribute of shape (list of sizes of each row of the snake graph). For example, the edges do not have weights attached to them. For the purpose of doing computation with cluster algebra objects, we will create another class ClusterWeightedSnakeGraph(SnakeGraph) later.
* Our motivation for creating this snake graph class is to compute cluster variables for cluster algebras from surfaces (see https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/16310). However, an abstract snake graph exists outside the context of cluster algebras from surfaces.

Thank you for your work on this.

Some things that need to be addressed from a quick glance:

- Full doctest coverage (`shape`).
- `print 'print an error message here TODO'` in `_element_constructor_` needs to raise an actual error.
- `The snake graphs` -> `Snake graphs`.
- You should include more information in the `SnakeGraphs`'s class level docstring.
- Remove the module variables `RIGHT` and `UP`; just use the python strings (I've never noticed a speed decrease; <technobabble>in fact, python probably keeps string instances in a pool and/or has special compiler behavior for hardcoded strings</technobabble>).
- You might consider using `ClonableArray` instead of `Element` since the former gives you list-like behavior for free (and by handling the internal storage in python, will be faster) and is a subclass of `Element`.
- You should explain the association between your internal data structure and the behavior of the snake graph (i.e., what integer makes the graph go in which direction?). This can be in python comments, not necessarily in the docstrings.

Looks pretty, and I like the ascii art.

For the ticket on trac, you should use real names for author and reviewer.

See u/egunawan/snake_graphs-19160 (on top of Sage 7.5) for the most current work. I have questions about using `Words` on Sage.

Currently the parent `SnakeGraphs` takes one parameter (the number of boxes), but for what I'd like to do mathematically, it would make sense to let `SnakeGraphs` be the set of all snake graphs (of any number of boxes).

Instead of enumerating them with compositions, we can also enumerate them by binary numbers, i.e. words on two alphabets 0 and 1 where the first alphabet must be 1 (except the the number 0). For example, the binary number 1 corresponds to the one-box; the word 10 corresponds to the shape (1,1) snake graph; the word 11 corresponds to the shape (2) snake graph; the word 100 corresponds to the shape (1,2) shape snake graph; the word 101 corresponds to the shape (1,1,1) snake graph; etc.

`Words` are already implemented in Sage, so maybe I can use that and append the alphabet 1 to the beginning of every word (in order to get the correct words for my need). What do you think? I am cc-ing Franco in case he may be interested in giving his input on my question. Thank you for reading!
