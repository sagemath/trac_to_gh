```
If `p` is a prime divisor of `m` there is currently no natural coercion morphism from `Integers(m)` to `GF(p)` when `p` is a prime that divides `m`:

```
sage: Integers(9).hom(GF(3))
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError [...]
```

I don't see why there shouldn't be: there is a natural coercion morphism from `Integers(p)` to `GF(p)` and there is one from `Integers(m)` to `Integers(p)`.

Also it seems like to change it would just involve changing one line of code.

Do you understand the purpose of the check

```
(not isinstance(S, ResidueField_generic) or
                     S.degree() == 1)):
```
If `is_instance(S, IntegerModRing_generic)` is True, then I think `S.degree()==1` always, and furthermore I don't see how `not isinstance(S, ResidueField_generic)` could be False. I would be tempted to just delete this, but I don't know this code well.
