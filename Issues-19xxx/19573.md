```
If `p` is a prime divisor of `m` there is currently no natural coercion morphism from `Integers(m)` to `GF(p)` when `p` is a prime that divides `m`:

```
sage: Integers(9).hom(GF(3))
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError [...]
```

I don't see why there shouldn't be: there is a natural coercion morphism from `Integers(p)` to `GF(p)` and there is one from `Integers(m)` to `Integers(p)`.

Also it seems like to change it would just involve changing one line of code.

1. I would put the test you added in the `EXAMPLES` block, not `TESTS`.

2. Add a test showing that there is no coercion from `Integers(9)` to `GF(5)` for example.

Do you understand the purpose of the check

```
(not isinstance(S, ResidueField_generic) or

If `is_instance(S, IntegerModRing_generic)` is True, then I think `S.degree()==1` always, and furthermore I don't see how `not isinstance(S, ResidueField_generic)` could be False. I would be tempted to just delete this, but I don't know this code well.

I also don't understand why `ZZ.residue_field(5)` does not just return the same thing as `Integers(5)`, but I'm not a number theorist.

So my very loose understanding is that they all should essentially be the same objects, but they are all considered as different constructions.

For [comment:9](#comment:9), it could be something like `GF(5)`, but that also seems to force a degree of 1. So I think you're right, that we don't need that extra check. However, I also don't know the code enough, but we could just remove it and see if anything breaks.

I agree that the coercion issues should be dealt with, but on another ticket.
