```
If `p` is a prime divisor of `m` there is currently no natural coercion morphism from `Integers(m)` to `GF(p)` when `p` is a prime that divides `m`:

```
sage: Integers(9).hom(GF(3))
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError [...]
```

I don't see why there shouldn't be: there is a natural coercion morphism from `Integers(p)` to `GF(p)` and there is one from `Integers(m)` to `Integers(p)`.

Also it seems like to change it would just involve changing one line of code.

<a id='comment:10'>Comment 10:</a>
Well, I do see how `not isinstance(S, ResidueField_generic)` can be false: `R = ZZ.residue_field(2)` (but I still do not see how `S.degree() == 1` could be false). This residue field does not have good coercion properties, either: as far as I can tell, there is no coercion map from either `ZZ.residue_field(p)` to `Integers(p)`, or from `GF(p)` to `Integers(p)`. Not that this is directly part of this ticket...

I also don't understand why `ZZ.residue_field(5)` does not just return the same thing as `Integers(5)`, but I'm not a number theorist.
