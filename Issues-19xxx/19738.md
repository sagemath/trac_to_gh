I stumbled on the following oddity during an exercise class (sage-6.8, x86_64-linux, debian 8.2).

```
sage: simplify(cos(pi/12))
1/12*sqrt(6)*(sqrt(3) + 3)
sage: simplify(sin(pi/12))
-1/12*sqrt(6)*(sqrt(3) - 3)
sage: simplify(exp(i*pi/12))
e^(1/12*I*pi)
```
Is there any rationale for this ? It looks like an inconsistency.

See https://github.com/pynac/pynac/issues/113

Since this is fixed in Sage now, this ticket should provide doctests.

Note expansion is done without the need for simplify.

Certainly the enhancement is within reach. There is a minor catch: although shortly before we have extended the values `m` for which `sin/cos/tan(n/m*pi)` is expanded in roots, simply doing `I*sin+cos` can result in mixed expressions because implementations differed for `sin` vs `cos`, e.g.

```
sage: sin(pi/15)
sin(1/15*pi)
sage: cos(pi/15)
1/8*sqrt(5) + 1/4*sqrt(3/2*sqrt(5) + 15/2) - 1/8
sage: I*sin(pi/15)+cos(pi/15)
1/8*sqrt(5) + 1/4*sqrt(3/2*sqrt(5) + 15/2) + I*sin(1/15*pi) - 1/8
```
The reason for the difference was the complexity of results---we stopped when the roots were nested more than twice.
