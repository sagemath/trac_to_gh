There is really no reason to source `sage-env` in `configure`. There are a few environment variables needed (like `SAGE_ROOT` and `SAGE_LOCAL`) but these are defined in `configure` anyway.

Also drop `$SAGE_ROOT/build/bin` and `$SAGE_ROOT/src/bin` from the `$PATH`.

The problem with the `gcc` test did not appear if you *don't* have a C compiler. The problem was if you have a *broken* C compiler. Apparently, having a broken C compiler is a hard error in `autoconf`.

In any case, I tested all `configure`-related tickets on `home.vbraun.cc`, simply compiling Sage. I have not yet tested `make clean` with this new version.
