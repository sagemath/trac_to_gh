Hi Jeroen,

Sorry for the slow response. This method should be able to return isometries for forms over fields, where I believe is_globally_equivalent_to just works over the ring of integers. For example:

```
sage: Q = DiagonalQuadraticForm(QQ, [1, 5])
sage: F = QuadraticForm(QQ, 2, [1, 12, 81])
sage: Q.is_globally_equivalent_to(F)
False
sage: Q.is_rationally_isometric(F)
True
sage: T = Q.isometry(F)
sage: T
[  1  -2]
[  0 1/3]
sage: Q.Gram_matrix() == T.transpose() * F.Gram_matrix() * T
True
```

So Q is equivalent to F over the rationals, but is_globally_equivalent_to doesn't recognize this. This method was intended to complement the is_rationally_isometric method, so perhaps it should be refactored to work in a similar manner as is_globally_equivalent_to, i.e, adding an optional flag to is_rationally_isometric to return the transition matrix for the isometry.

That being said, I think you are really over-complicating the algorithm.

Suppose one of the forms is given by the diagonal `5*x0^2 + ...`. Then really all you need to do in the first step is to find a vector `v` of "length" 5. This can be done with some algorithm based on PARI's `qfsolve()`: the only issue is that `qfsolve()` finds a projective point, but you really want an affine point.

So I suggest to do the following:
1. implement an affine version of `qfsolve()` to solve equations of the form `Q(x) = C` where `Q` is a quadratic form and `C` is a constant. Do this in a separate Sage ticket.
2. use this new function to implement `isometry` on this ticket.

This will have several major advantages:
1. your code will be a lot faster.
2. it will no longer run forever if there is isometry (which is unacceptable).
3. you can remove the assumption that your quadratic form is positive-definite.

I can fix this by throwing an exception when `is_rationally_isometric()` returns false for the two forms. The reason I didn't include this initially is that I was working off of Sage 6.8 but `is_rationally_isometric()` was added in 6.9.

I will fix the formatting in the docstring.

About solving quadratic forms:

Suppose you want to solve `Q(x) = c`. Consider the quadratic form `Q(x) - c*z^2 = 0`, where `z` is an extra variable. Find a solution `(x,z)` to this quadratic form using `qfsolve()`.

**Case 1**: If `z != 0`, then `Q(x/z) = c`.

**Case 2**: We found a solution `Q(x) = 0`. Let `e` be any vector such that `B(x,e) != 0`, where `B` is the bilinear form corresponding to `Q`. To find `e`, just try all unit vectors `(0,..0,1,0...0)`. Let `a = (c - Q(e))/B(x,e)` and let `y = e + a*x`. Then `Q(y) = c`.

It would be great if you could implement this on a separate ticket.

Can you move the helper functions out of the `diagonal_isometry` function and also doctest them?

It was originally necessary because the `short_vector_list_up_to_length()` function didn't work for 1-dimensional quadratic forms, and the final iteration of the algorithm operates on two 1-dimensional forms.

I believe this is necessary. The loop that looks for two vectors such that the modified bases including them will be non-singular will try vectors indefinitely until it finds a satisfactory pair. If the forms aren't equivalent there's no guarantee such a pair will be found.

Nope. That's a relic from an early version when `isometry` and `diagonal_isometry` were one function. I'll remove it, thanks for catching that.

Sorry, I still don't understand the algorithm. You really need more comments *in the code*. In particular, you need to explain the purpose of the variables `i`, `q_basis`, `f_basis`, `qb` and `fb`.

My feeling is that the current algorithm is too complicated (I don't think you need to loop for `v`), but I cannot really say how to improve it since I don't understand it.

I have looked over tgaona's algorithm, and it makes sense to me.  The block of code mentioned in comment 26 is a bit confusing, but I believe that it is necessary since its eventually necessary to invert, and therefore avoid the possibility of having a singular change of basis matrix.  

Another source of confusion, I believe, is in the description of the helper function `modify basis`.  I do believe that it does precisely what it needs to do in the context of the code, but the description is not quite correct, and a little bit misleading, since it is always a function acting on a submatrix of the original basis matrix.

The functions `diagonal_isometry`, `compute_gram_matrix_from_basis`, `modify_basis`, and `graham_schmidt` are all very particular to this parent function `isometry`, so (I believe) the standard Sage convention is to begin those with an underscore.

Other than that, I'll concede that there may very well be a faster way to run this algorithm, but as tgaona has it, it's certainly correct.

I understand the algorithm, I don't think it's so complicated.  It just looks for a vector w in W of length corresponding to, V[0][0], the upper left most entry in V.

I feel satisfied the the algorithm does what it claims to do, and that it is mathematically correct. 

A few notes on the documentation: 

1.  In your documentation for `_diagonal_isometry()` you call the function `isometry()` (of course it works out to be the same thing here, since the forms are diagonal to begin with. 

2. Your documentation for `_gram_schmidt()` is a bit misleading, since it looks like you are treating the columns of a Gram matrix as a set of vectors to be orthogonalized, rather, do the process on some sort of (preferably basis) matrix.   

In response to comment 45, I'm also not sure why v=parilist[i] got added.  Is there a reason you're touching `short_vector_list_up_to_length()`?  I think something may have happened on the merge.

Thank you for writing this code. It is well documented and easy to read. 
The basic algorithm works. Good job!
After computing some examples I noticed that coefficients tend to explode and
examples beyond n=4 take ages. Is this expected? Is there an algorithm avoiding coefficient blowups?

I can review it. Here are some comments:

- use imperative in the docstrings: "Computes something". Should rather be: "Compute something" 
- There is no need to introduce a new method `isometry()`. Instead give `is_rationally_isometric` a new argument `return_matrix`. You can model analogous behavior as in `is_globally_equivalent_to`.

- In the current implementation you do not check the `base_ring` is `ZZ` or `QQ`. This should be done. Or does it work more generally? For example the code does not work over the p-adics. 
- You do not need a new method`_compute_gram_matrix_from_basis`. Instead you can just use `Q(T).Gram_matrix_rational()`. Here `Q` is a quadratic form and `T` a transformation matrix.
- make sure degenerate quadratic forms work as well and doctest it.
- add a random doctest. For example something in the direction of:

```
sage: n = 4
sage: G = matrix.random(QQ,n) #random
sage: G = G + G.transpose()
sage: Q = QuadraticForm(QQ,G)
sage: T = matrix.random(QQ,n)
sage: S = Q.isometry(Q(T))
sage: Q == Q(S)
True
```
