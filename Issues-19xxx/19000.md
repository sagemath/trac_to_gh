This ticket collects tickets necessary to strengthen Maxima `solve` with a state-of-the-art SMT-solver. The interface will be the open SMT-LIB 2.0 and so there is a wide choice of packages of which Z3 certainly is the best at the moment.

* #18999 - add assumptions on defined/hard-coded functions
* - SMT-solver benchmark on typical solved and unsolved (by Maxima) problems
* - SMT-LIB interface
* - experimental SMT-solver package

Pynac will have access to Sage assumptions with version 0.4.3 but the kind of solver is irrelevant with this.

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisfiability_modulo_theories
* http://smtlib.cs.uiowa.edu/papers/smt-lib-reference-v2.5-r2015-06-28.pdf
* https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06945
* https://github.com/smtrat/smtrat
* https://github.com/pysmt/pysmt

Solving with SMT solvers rather means proving satisfiablity, in which they are very good. They also can give an example solution.

SMT is quantifier elimination with booleans. Here one really needs quantifier elimination in other, more complicated, 1st order theories (pardon the logic terminology).
While algorithms are known how to do quantifier elimination with complex and reals (assuming the only functions involved are polynomials, otherwise it's harder, or even algorithmically unsolvable), there are not really any off the shelf OSS for this.
(Sage includes `qepcad` to do this over reals, but it's not so easy to use and very slow).
