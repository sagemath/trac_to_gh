Hello,

I moved the code around in `difference_family` in order to have all constructions that does not need the factorisation of `v` before. In other words

```
if does_construction1_work(v,k,l):
    ....
elif does_construction2_work(v,k,l):
    ...
else:
    v = factor(v)
    ...

I'm not being passive-aggressive here, just asking the question: considering the following timings, do you think that we should care?

```
sage: %timeit [factor(i) for i in range(2,10000)]
10 loops, best of 3: 78.7 ms per loop
sage: %timeit [designs.difference_family(i,3,existence=True) for i in range(10000)]
1 loops, best of 3: 1.58 s per loop
```

I don't know if another timing makes more sense. I merely tried the first I could think of.

This is more about code organization rather than timings. The previous version of the code was

```
D = None
... # try some stuff
if D is None:
    ... # try other stuff
if D is None:
    ... # try another one
```

If we chose to not care about this call to 'factor', could we have something like that?

```
f = factor(v)
if does_construction1_work(v,k,l):

Hello again,

I have been staring for a while at the parameters v,k,l, looking for a way to avoid the database. Now number theory really isn't my thing, but I wonder about that: shouldn't the gcd of 'v,l,m' be *very* close to `q^s`? Actually, in the factorization of `gcd(v,l,m)` into `pi,si`, aren't we sure that `q^s` is equal to the largest value of `pi^si`.

Actually (please tell me if I am wrong) by developping k as a series I get that `k=lambda+q^(2s)`, thus `gcd(lambda,k)` is a power of `q` greater than `q^s` (because both k and l can be divided by `q^s`).

I'm getting very convinced that `q^s` is actually equal to `gcd(lambda,k)`.

Well, what do you think? `:-/`

Nathann

Hello again,

> Other people might need to learn to spell, you know...


I have received complaints because my posts on sage-devel had a space before "!?;:", and that while it is the rule in french it is not so in english.

You and I are both right.
