When building on Cygwin32, I get the following error:

```
.libs/libpynac_la-numeric.o: In function `ZN5GiNaC7numericD2Ev':
/home/Travis/sage/local/var/tmp/sage/build/pynac-0.5.2/src/ginac/numeric.cpp:621:
 undefined reference to `_imp____gmpq_clear'
```
This indicated to me there is a linking issue with Pynac to GMP. Full log is [here](http://trac.sagemath.org/attachment/ticket/19663/pynac-0.5.2.log) on #19663.

---

Fixed by the update to Pynac 0.5.3 on #19744.

<a id='comment:5'></a>FWIW, Pynac's `configure` doesn't check for libgmp, just for its header.

In GiNaC's Makefile we still have

```make
#The -no-undefined breaks Pynac on OS X 10.4.  See #9135
if CYGWIN
libpynac_la_LDFLAGS = -version-info $(LT_VERSION_INFO) -no-undefined
else
libpynac_la_LDFLAGS = -version-info $(LT_VERSION_INFO)
endif
```

though, so it must fail on Cygwin (unless we link to libgmp there).




The libtool versioning (0.0.0) IMHO doesn't make sense either.
