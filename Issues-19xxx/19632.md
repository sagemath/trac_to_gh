Are you saying that relabel() can reorder vertices? Indeed, the code depends on it keeping them 
in the same order.

'reorder' ? Nono, it will not 'reorder' them, i.e. the ith vertex of g.vertices() is the ith vertex of g.vertices() after a relabel

```
        if perm is None:
            perm = dict({v:i for i,v in enumerate(self.vertices())})
```

But if you have to explain in the doc what exactly the ith vertex represents when he provides a partition, well, we might as well use their original labels (i.e. before relabelling)

`partition` is partition of the points of the underlying `hyperoval` (not a partition of vertices). 

```
   * "partition" -- if "None" (default), pair each i-th point of
     "hyperoval" with (i+1)-th. Otherwise, specifies the pairing in
     the format ((i_1,i'_1),(i_2,i'_2),...).

   * "hyperoval" -- a hyperoval defining T_2^*(q)^*. If "None"
     (default), the classical hyperoval obatined from a conic is used.
```

<a id='comment:15'></a>Hello Dima,

As the end of december is coming fast, I started this review before the next beta. I added a commit at public/19632 that cleans a couple of things, and simplifies some code too. It would be really great if you could start thinking of what your computer does when you give it instructions, because a lot of computations was done for nothing.

Two remarks:

- For me the following doctest is too long, even for a "#long" doctest. Recently some guys were trying to figure out how to do something like "#long 2m" doctests for a better filtering.

```
sage: %time g=graphs.HaemersGraph(8); g
CPU times: user 11.1 s, sys: 20 ms, total: 11.1 s
Wall time: 11.1 s
```

- It seems that `partition` is not a partition of the vertex set but a partition of ... a partition of G into independent sets. Would it be possible to change the terminology a bit to avoid confusion?

Thanks,

Nathann
