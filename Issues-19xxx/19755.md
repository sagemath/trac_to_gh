lcalc also ignores LDFLAGS, though it seems to work despite that; From the build log:

```
g++ -shared  -o libLfunction.so Lglobals.o Lgamma.o Lriemannsiegel.o Lriemannsiegel_blfi.o Ldokchitser.o
```
It only uses gcc libraries that are possibly bundled in Sage

```
$ ldd local/lib/libLfunction.so 
	linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007fff7af81000)
	libstdc++.so.6 => /lib64/libstdc++.so.6 (0x00007f16509c9000)
