<a id='comment:10'></a>Helloooooo Vincent,

Here is the review for this second ticket:

- In the docstring of `hadamard_difference_set_product_parameters`, could you
  specify the inputs of the product construction (i.e. could you specify which
  difference sets you are looking for)?

- This look like something that should not be there:

  {{{
+    try:
+        fac1 = tuple(G1.cartesian_factors())
+        tup1 = tuple
+    except AttributeError:
+        fac1 = (G1,)
+        tup1 = lambda x: (x,)
  }}}

  Can you explain why you need this (twice)?

- docstring of `turyn_1965_3x3xK` -- can you wrap the `C3x...` with backticks so
  that it displays properly as mathematics notations?

- As this functions is only building two difference families, shouldn't it be in some kind
  of database instead?

- Typo:
  `"can not exists"`

- Is it correct to have a 'else' inside of `elif
  are_hadamard_difference_set_parameters(v,k,l)` which says that no construction
  is known? Couldn't another construction be able to build it?

- To simplify the flow of those if/else if you need to break it into several
  smaller ones, you can use a trick like that:
  {{{
  if are_hadamard_difference_set_parameters(v,k,l) and (k-2*lmbda).is_prime():
      <whatever>
  }}}

Because cartesian product does not flatten stuff.

```
sage: G1 = cartesian_product([Zmod(2),Zmod(2)])
sage: G2 = cartesian_product([Zmod(3),Zmod(5)])
sage: cartesian_product(G1,G2)
The cartesian product of (The cartesian product of (Ring of integers modulo 2, Ring of integers modulo 2), The cartesian product of (Ring of integers modulo 3, Ring of integers modulo 5))
```
versus

```
sage: cartesian_product(G1.cartesian_factors() + G2.cartesian_factors())
The cartesian product of (Ring of integers modulo 2, Ring of integers modulo 2, Ring of integers modulo 3, Ring of integers modulo 5)
```

Not the one which are after. `4N^2` is a prime power if and only if `N=2^k`. In which case the construction is taken care before (McFarland 1973). The twin primes construction does not apply.

It will cost 3 of them and I need the `N` to dispatch to the constructors.

I was more thinking of moving its two difference families into the existing database of difference families, in database.py.

> Not the one which are after.


I see. But then the order is important, and it is not really straightforward to figure it out.

> It will cost 3 of them and I need the `N` to dispatch to the constructors.


Only two if the `turyn_1965_3x3xK` enters the database. We can also hardcode the parameters in the if/else, given that they are known.

One option is to add a `flatten` option to the cartesian product functor... but I will still have an issue to build an element of `G1 x G2` from an element of `G1` and `G2`.
