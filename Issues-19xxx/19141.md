Check documentation in functions like `is_bounded()`, `is_ranked()` and so on.

This continues the series started with #18925, #18941 and #18959.

This contains one code change: `is_chain()` for empty poset returns `True`.

`is_incomparable_chain_free` rejects argument `0`, as it makes no sense. Also I added "interval order" etc. for googlers. (Code could be changed from recursive to iterative. Or maybe just drop support for list type argument?)

Otherwise this is mostly polishing. I tried to explain intuitively what means for example to be ranked. Actually pictures would be good here.

I also added test for empty poset to all functions that I checked.

I think that it depends on what mathematicians think. There is no mathematical definition for "mathematically interesting".

For a graph we have the chromatic number. We might also want to see an example of some coloring. Or maybe we want to count how many different coloring the graph has. Or make a list of them. Or maybe just check that the graph is not 4-colorable.

Just writing down my comments as I read through, I may make some of the changes mentioned if I get a chance.

- In `is_incomparable_chain_free()` the three cases of (m+n)-free having a special name, the case (1+2) is missing the parentheses around 1+2.

- I think the input for `is_incomparable_chain_free` is a bit confusing, since m can be an integer or a list of pairs of integers. Or at least the first part of the decription needs to be a bit more verbose to describe what's happening.

- I don't like the name `is_chain()` being used for checking if a poset is totally ordered. Shouldn't this be called `is_totally_ordered`, to avoid confusion with checking that a given subset of the poset forms a chain? Or maybe `is_chain_poset()`?

- Maybe the definition of a poset being connected could mention that an equivalent definition is the Hasse diagram being connected?

- Informal definition of a ranked poset should be touched up a bit. Should say something more along the lines of 'all cover relations are between elements on adjacent levels'. Strictly speaking, saying they can't skip levels doesn't exclude the possibility of them being on the same level. I also think the 'formal definition' should come before the informal one, and not be branded as 'formal'.

- I'm not sure the informal definition of a graded poset helps at all. Saying all maximal chains have the same length is pretty clear. And if it does stay, there's one typo ('throught').

As I asked: "Or maybe just drop support for list type argument?". It is easy to guess why the list argument is done: to have slightly easier way to filter semiorders. But it is still oneliner to write without list type argument.

To drop it, to keep and clarify the documentation, or to deprecate it?

Very true. Not `is_chain_poset`, as it is too easy to confuse with `is_chain_of_poset`. So, deprecation and a new name?

> - Maybe the definition of a poset being connected could mention that an equivalent definition is the Hasse diagram being connected?


Yes. Actually it seems obvious from the name what the function does.

This is a function where formal definition is easy, but still very hard compared to informal definition - or to a picture. But yes, I must think the wording.

> - I'm not sure the informal definition of a graded poset helps at all. Saying all maximal chains have the same length is pretty clear. And if it does stay, there's one typo ('throught').


Yeah, maybe I remove it.

True, *antiordered* does not sound good.

So I guess I will revert this change. The reason was possible confusion of a set being a chain of poset and a whole poset being a chain.

You can have both

```

    r"""
    Test whether a given subset of elements is a chain.

    By default, does the test for all the elements of the poset.
