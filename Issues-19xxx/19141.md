<a id='comment:8'></a>Just writing down my comments as I read through, I may make some of the changes mentioned if I get a chance.

- In `is_incomparable_chain_free()` the three cases of (m+n)-free having a special name, the case (1+2) is missing the parentheses around 1+2.

- I think the input for `is_incomparable_chain_free` is a bit confusing, since m can be an integer or a list of pairs of integers. Or at least the first part of the decription needs to be a bit more verbose to describe what's happening.

- I don't like the name `is_chain()` being used for checking if a poset is totally ordered. Shouldn't this be called `is_totally_ordered`, to avoid confusion with checking that a given subset of the poset forms a chain? Or maybe `is_chain_poset()`?

- Maybe the definition of a poset being connected could mention that an equivalent definition is the Hasse diagram being connected?

- Informal definition of a ranked poset should be touched up a bit. Should say something more along the lines of 'all cover relations are between elements on adjacent levels'. Strictly speaking, saying they can't skip levels doesn't exclude the possibility of them being on the same level. I also think the 'formal definition' should come before the informal one, and not be branded as 'formal'.

- I'm not sure the informal definition of a graded poset helps at all. Saying all maximal chains have the same length is pretty clear. And if it does stay, there's one typo ('throught').

As I asked: "Or maybe just drop support for list type argument?". It is easy to guess why the list argument is done: to have slightly easier way to filter semiorders. But it is still oneliner to write without list type argument.

To drop it, to keep and clarify the documentation, or to deprecate it?

Very true. Not `is_chain_poset`, as it is too easy to confuse with `is_chain_of_poset`. So, deprecation and a new name?

> - Maybe the definition of a poset being connected could mention that an equivalent definition is the Hasse diagram being connected?


Yes. Actually it seems obvious from the name what the function does.

This is a function where formal definition is easy, but still very hard compared to informal definition - or to a picture. But yes, I must think the wording.

> - I'm not sure the informal definition of a graded poset helps at all. Saying all maximal chains have the same length is pretty clear. And if it does stay, there's one typo ('throught').


Yeah, maybe I remove it.

True, *antiordered* does not sound good.

So I guess I will revert this change. The reason was possible confusion of a set being a chain of poset and a whole poset being a chain.

I guess there could also be `is_antichain()`, as it can too be useful as filter-out -function.

You can have both

```
def is_chain(self, data=None):
    r"""
    Test whether a given subset of elements is a chain.

    By default, does the test for all the elements of the poset.
    """
    if data is None:
        data = self

No! Please no!

They do very much different thing. Already `rank` gives me a headache, as it can return a property of a poset (height, not depending if the poset is ranked or not) or a a property of an element (rank in ranked poset).
