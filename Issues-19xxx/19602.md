Dependencies on library files (e.g. `.so` files) are not picked up by `distutils`. We monkeypatch Cython to add the missing dependencies.

To test this, first build Sage with this patch. Then run

```
$ touch local/lib/*.so
$ ./sage -b
```
This will rebuild 223 Cython extensions (apparently 223 extensions depend on some library).

After applying this patch and running `sage -f sagelib`, the top of `src/build/cythonized/sage/ext/interrupt/interrupt.c` looks like

```

Wow, getting more and more inefficient (memory footprint, number of system calls/filesystem accesses).  (W.r.t. reinventing the wheel, we should probably consider dynamically creating Makefiles to build the Sage library... ;-) )

You could at least cache the mapping of library names to their (existing, probably single) pathnames (and reuse them instead of creating hundreds of copies); if there's a shared library, you don't have to record another potential static one of the same library -- on *nix at least.  Not sure whether hardcoding the library folders (`SAGE_LOCAL/lib*/`) there makes sense, or is appropriate.

After all, not relying on (say) timestamps of headers but recompiling and relinking on every change of a shared library is pretty much against one of their purposes.




`libFOO.dll` is not the convention used on Windows AFAIK; we may specialize according to the platform, also avoiding unnecessary calls of `glob()`.




Do you want to keep the verbose listing of (lengthy!) dependencies by default?




You've renamed the parameter `library_order` to `library_sort_key`, the docstring of `wrap_create_extension_list()` doesn't yet reflect that change.

I'd love to, but I think neither upstream Cython nor upstream distutils will want to support that.

Right.

> if there's a shared library, you don't have to record another potential static one of the same library -- on *nix at least.

Well, it doesn't really hurt either. It's just to be safe.

> After all, not relying on (say) timestamps of headers but recompiling and relinking on every change of a shared library is pretty much against one of their purposes.

Again, you are right but I don't see an easy way to express this in the build system.

> Do you want to keep the verbose listing of (lengthy!) dependencies by default?

Which "verbose listing of (lengthy!) dependencies"?

Relying no the timestamp of the header sounds good to me.

It assumes that we don't overlink, but thats obviously to be avoided anyways.

I just checked

```
find local/ -type f |xargs ls -l --sort=time
```

and the only old files were from `numpy`. So everything except numpy seems to install everything with recent timestamps.

Explicitly using `depends` should only be done in exceptional cases where the normal dependency checking doesn't work. #19610 is such an exceptional case (because the dependency is through a `.c` or `.h` file).

As we have seen, you can easily add `distutils: libraries = foo bar` **without** making the modules *depend* (in distutils' sense) on the libraries (i.e., their proper headers).  This was more transparent or obvious in our older `module_list.py` (where we by the way could also use things like `uname_specific()`).
