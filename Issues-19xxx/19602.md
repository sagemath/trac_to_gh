Dependencies on library files (e.g. `.so` files) are not picked up by `distutils`. We monkeypatch Cython to add the missing dependencies.

To test this, first build Sage with this patch. Then run

```
$ touch local/lib/*.so
$ ./sage -b
```
This will rebuild 223 Cython extensions (apparently 223 extensions depend on some library).

After applying this patch and running `sage -f sagelib`, the top of `src/build/cythonized/sage/ext/interrupt/interrupt.c` looks like

```

<a id='comment:10'></a>Wow, getting more and more inefficient (memory footprint, number of system calls/filesystem accesses).  (W.r.t. reinventing the wheel, we should probably consider dynamically creating Makefiles to build the Sage library... ;-) )

You could at least cache the mapping of library names to their (existing, probably single) pathnames (and reuse them instead of creating hundreds of copies); if there's a shared library, you don't have to record another potential static one of the same library -- on *nix at least.  Not sure whether hardcoding the library folders (`SAGE_LOCAL/lib*/`) there makes sense, or is appropriate.

After all, not relying on (say) timestamps of headers but recompiling and relinking on every change of a shared library is pretty much against one of their purposes.




`libFOO.dll` is not the convention used on Windows AFAIK; we may specialize according to the platform, also avoiding unnecessary calls of `glob()`.




Do you want to keep the verbose listing of (lengthy!) dependencies by default?




You've renamed the parameter `library_order` to `library_sort_key`, the docstring of `wrap_create_extension_list()` doesn't yet reflect that change.

I'd love to, but I think neither upstream Cython nor upstream distutils will want to support that.

Right.

> if there's a shared library, you don't have to record another potential static one of the same library -- on *nix at least.

Well, it doesn't really hurt either. It's just to be safe.

Again, you are right but I don't see an easy way to express this in the build system.

> Do you want to keep the verbose listing of (lengthy!) dependencies by default?

Which "verbose listing of (lengthy!) dependencies"?

I just checked

```
find local/ -type f |xargs ls -l --sort=time

Explicitly using `depends` should only be done in exceptional cases where the normal dependency checking doesn't work. #19610 is such an exceptional case (because the dependency is through a `.c` or `.h` file).

As we have seen, you can easily add `distutils: libraries = foo bar` **without** making the modules *depend* (in distutils' sense) on the libraries (i.e., their proper headers).  This was more transparent or obvious in our older `module_list.py` (where we by the way could also use things like `uname_specific()`).
