<a id='comment:21'>Comment 21:</a>
Still not sure what is going on here. This passage in `zeta_function.py` is nonsensical:

```
            # Reduce remaining part
            meta = Gm.parent()(m * eta[i])
            x_i = Gm.parent()(x[i])
            Gmbar = -sum([x_i * meta.derivative(x_i) for i in range(n + 1)])
```
but fixing it doesn't have any effect on the doctests (the terms in the sum are all zero anyway).

Another data point: the ratio of the answers with `affine=True` and `affine=False` is not correct either.
