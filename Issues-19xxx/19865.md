The Sperber-Voight algorithm being implemented here has as a complexity parameter the number of interior monomials, so it probably doesn't stand much of a chance for dense equations (although descending it from Sage to Cython might help near the borderline).

For smooth projective hypersurfaces, we also have tickets #20265 (deformation) and #23863 (controlled reduction). For nondegenerate toric hypersurfaces, Edgar Costa has functioning C code doing controlled reduction, but I believe it is not yet available for public consumption.

Still not sure what is going on here. This passage in `zeta_function.py` is nonsensical:

```
            # Reduce remaining part
            meta = Gm.parent()(m * eta[i])
            x_i = Gm.parent()(x[i])
            Gmbar = -sum([x_i * meta.derivative(x_i) for i in range(n + 1)])
```
but fixing it doesn't have any effect on the doctests (the terms in the sum are all zero anyway).

Another data point: the ratio of the answers with `affine=True` and `affine=False` is not correct either.
