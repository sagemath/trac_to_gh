```

R.<x,y>=PolynomialRing(ZZ,2);

Q=y^2-(x^3+x+1); p=13;
ffzeta(Q,p,verbose=True);

# does not work:
Q=y^4+(5*x-4)*y^3+(3*x^2+2*x-3)*y^2+(x^3+4*x^2-2*x+3)*y+(3*x^4-2*x^3-4*x^2+2*x+2); p=11;

Just tried this and there is still something wrong:

Failed example:

Expected:

I was not one of the people working on this at sd91, so I wouldn't know what the issue is.

Still not sure what is going on here. This passage in `zeta_function.py` is nonsensical:

```
            # Reduce remaining part
            meta = Gm.parent()(m * eta[i])
            x_i = Gm.parent()(x[i])
            Gmbar = -sum([x_i * meta.derivative(x_i) for i in range(n + 1)])
```
but fixing it doesn't have any effect on the doctests (the terms in the sum are all zero anyway).

Another data point: the ratio of the answers with `affine=True` and `affine=False` is not correct either.
