I think I've done the deprecation in a proper way, though I'm not so sure... The developer's guide is not so clear about it for someone who never did it.

I started a new branch since I changed the version of sage I had on my computer in between. It's now based on 6.9beta5.

1. You cannot just put docstrings in arbitrary places. So in `src/sage/combinat/lyndon_word.py`, you should replace

```
"""
docstring
"""

code

"""
doctests
"""
```
by

```
"""
docstring

doctests
"""

code
```

2. The indentation of the docstring is wrong:

```
TESTS::

sage: ...
```
should become

```
TESTS::

    sage: ...
```

3. Instead of testing `import *`, I would prefer to see a more concrete import (say `LyndonWord`)
