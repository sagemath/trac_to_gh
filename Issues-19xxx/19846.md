Most of the READMEs of Github repositories are markdown files (.md extension). Markdown files are rendered by Github and they look nicely formatted and better to the eye than plaintext files.

The existing README.txt has to be converted to a README.md for better aesthetic look for users viewing Github repository, while preserving the readibility if viewed as a plaintext file.

Reviewer: Thierry Monteil, Dima Pasechnik

Branch: 3624bbfbcc0976ff9343f4226d54aab1f6955735

The beautified version, README.md looks like this:

I have taken care of your advice and fired another commit to improve the readability of markdown version also as a plaintext.

Here is the raw plaintext version of the markdown file:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karandesai-96/sage/t/19846/beautify_readme/README.md

This ticket can be reviewed and closed now. Though I'll be happy to have any type of suggestions and workarounds.

<a id='comment:7'></a>`@`nbruin:

README.md as a plaintext file looks like this :

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karandesai-96/sage/t/19846/beautify_readme/README.md

where each line contains 80 characters or less.

Github renders this README.md by compiling it to html and displaying it beautifully as:

https://github.com/karandesai-96/sage/tree/t/19846/beautify_readme

Anywhere else other than github (in text editors on local machine for example), the README will appear as the first link and not the second one.

To create a new line in markdown, the plaintext version must have one complete blank line between two lines, or a <br> tag written at the end of each line. This will make the plaintext version of the file very lengthy and containing too many blank lines or <br> tags at the end of each line.

Is it fine to have too many <br> tags in the README paintext version (as per first link) ?

Please reply and I will take necessary actions.

<a id='comment:9'></a>Hi `@`nbruin

I wrapped the text in the Markdown version too, and I looks more cleaner and appealing to the eye than before.

Have a look: https://github.com/karandesai-96/sage/tree/t/19846/beautify_readme

The clutter in plaintext version of file was saved as I did not have to put <br/> tags at the end of each line. Appending two blankspaces at the end of line means a line break, in markdown! :)

The plaintext version is has two blank spaces after each line, but it looks same:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karandesai-96/sage/t/19846/beautify_readme/README.md

I hope the README now serves both ways:

> It renders in a beautiful way, for the users on Github to view.


> It is retained readability in plain text format too, for another users.


Regards, Karan.

Hi `@`tmonteil,

I have done the task as you asked to.

Please do have a look: [​https://github.com/karandesai-96/sage/tree/t/19846/beautify_readme](https://github.com/karandesai-96/sage/tree/t/19846/beautify_readme)

Raw content of MarkDown (.md) version: [​https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karandesai-96/sage/t/19846/beautify_readme/README.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karandesai-96/sage/t/19846/beautify_readme/README.md)

Raw content of PlainText (.txt) version: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sagemath/sage/master/README.txt

Please compare the readability of raw content of both the versions and let me know your thoughts ! :)

I hope the recent two commits pushed by me have improved the readability of the markdown file viewed in plaintext.

Regards, 

Karan
