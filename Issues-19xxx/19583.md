I don't mind if there is no way around it, and if there is an easy way out I prefer it.

Do you plan a third copy/paste because of some information that you cannot find from the function you implement here? `:-P`

I think it would not be easy to manage the embedding in the rotate-and-close algo. Every single edge addition would have to do a lot of job to do to change the embedding.

ok. If you insist on no-code-duplication, as I said, one can get the graph from the simplicial complex, maybe at the prize of some (big?) speed loss.

Could well be. My aim is to build a random interval in the Tamari lattices. For this I have to
obtain a random minimal Schnyder wood. For the moment, this is only a project, so I cannot
say right now how much code I will re-use.

In Sage, the embedding is represented by a list associated to each vertex. Given the picture  have in mind of the algorithm (though perhaps it is wrong) the algorithm starts from a tree and keeps adding edges, each of which is, when it is added, on the outer face.

I wonder if when adding edge uv, it does not boil down to adding v at the end of u's list, and adding u at the beginning of v's list.

And something slightly more specific for a and b.

> ok. If you insist on no-code-duplication, as I said, one can get the graph from the simplicial complex, maybe at the prize of some (big?) speed loss.


A big speed loss is a good justification for code duplication.

Some timings:

```
sage: %timeit simplicial_complexes.RandomTwoSphere(1000)
1 loops, best of 3: 246 ms per loop
sage: %timeit graphs.RandomTriangulation(1000)
1 loops, best of 3: 222 ms per loop
```

That's what happens when you replace the last line of `RandomTwoSphere` this way:

```diff
-    return SimplicialComplex(triangles)
+    return triangles
```

Another timing:

```
sage: %timeit simplicial_complexes.RandomTwoSphere(1000)
1 loops, best of 3: 269 ms per loop
sage: %timeit graphs.RandomTriangulation(1000)
1 loops, best of 3: 219 ms per loop
```

That's what happens when you do the following replacement instead:

```
-    return SimplicialComplex(triangles)
+    return SimplicialComplex(triangles,maximality_check=False)
```


Once this (second) replacement is done, here is the effect on the `.graph` function:

```
sage: %timeit simplicial_complexes.RandomTwoSphere(1000).graph()
1 loops, best of 3: 345 ms per loop
sage: %timeit graphs.RandomTriangulation(1000)
1 loops, best of 3: 222 ms per loop
```

If that is still too much for your (I assume computer-intensive) needs, it seems that the .graph function is unnecessarily slow

```
sage: def simplex_to_graph(S):
    g = Graph()
    for S in S._facets:
        g.add_cycle(g)
    return g
sage: %timeit simplex_to_graph(simplicial_complexes.RandomTwoSphere(1000))
1 loops, best of 3: 288 ms per loop
sage: %timeit graphs.RandomTriangulation(1000)
1 loops, best of 3: 226 ms per loop
```

So please stop messing around by moving around blocks of 5 lines, and keep only one of these two functions (unless you still find the speed penalty too big).

<a id='comment:28'></a>Hello Nathann.

Thanks for your comments, and for your time.

Concerning the suggestion of Travis, I can of course revert this factorisation. But you may qualify this as "just doing everything that a potential reviewer asks for".

I was trying to think about adding the embedding information on the graph method, as you suggested before. I am not sure that this data is easily recoverable from the simplicial complex. So it seems to me that keeping both still has a value, if I manage to add the embedding.

1) the graph method would give an embedded (planar) graph. 

2) the simplicial complex method (besides giving an interesting object by itself) allows to compute easily the planar dual of this graph, which would give another class of nice random graphs.

I don't have anything against people telling me why they think one of my suggestions is wrong. If you think useful to keep this independent function, I'm all ears.

> I was trying to think about adding the embedding information on the graph method, as you suggested before. I am not sure that this data is easily recoverable from the simplicial complex. So it seems to me that keeping both still has a value, if I manage to add the embedding.


If you manage to add the embedding to the `Graph` function, then it will be straightforward to build the `SimplicialComplex` from it. So again in this case, you can do without the `SimplicialComplex` constructor, which will merely list the faces of the `Graph` object (assuming that it contains the embedding).

I have nothing against that.

so going through the graph to get the simplicial complex is not efficient..

Some other timings:

```
def triangles(G):
    G = G.relabel(inplace=False)
    return [(u,v,w) for u,L in G._embedding.iteritems() 
            for v,w in zip(L,L[1:]+[L[0]]) if u<v and u<w]

sage: %timeit graphs.RandomTriangulation(1000)
1 loops, best of 3: 258 ms per loop
sage: %timeit SimplicialComplex(triangles(graphs.RandomTriangulation(1000)),maximality_check=False)
1 loops, best of 3: 304 ms per loop
sage: %timeit simplicial_complexes.RandomTwoSphere(1000)
1 loops, best of 3: 299 ms per loop
```

And a check:

```
sage: g=graphs.RandomTriangulation(1000)
sage: h=Graph()
sage: _=map(h.add_cycle,triangles(g))
sage: g == h
True
```

I have too much respect for you to think that you even gave it a decent try. You would have at least added `maximality_check=False`, as I made this remark this very morning.

Thank you. I have absolutely nothing against the current design of functions. And I may take a look at `Graph.faces()`, just in case it may not be slow for triangulations only.

To be fair, what really made it longer is the docstrings and doctests, which is not a bad thing either. Also, it would have made it easier in terms of long-term maintenance (you only have to make changes in one place).

<a id='comment:39'></a>Hello,

The branch looks good. I only wonder about that: why keep it?

```
+    # graph.relabel()   # does not act on the embedding !
```

If you expect `.relabel()` to apply to the embedding, then the right reaction is to write a bugfix, isn't it?

Could you also add a doctest like that?

```
sage: for i in range(10):
....:    g = graphs.RandomTriangulation(10)
....:    assert g.is_planar(on_embedding=g.get_embedding())
```

I let it run for a long time, but that's probably safer to have it in the tests.

Thanks,

Nathann
