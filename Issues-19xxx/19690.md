As #19383 seems dead (and latest push do not merge anymore), I suggest adding standard example in it's own in this ticket.

It is logical to have `StandardExample(n)` to always have dimension `n`. This is not the case when `n=1`. Hence I added a restriction `n >= 2`.

Nathann, you already saw this in #19383, so I guess this is an easy review.

Documentation could be extended and said that Dedekind-Macneille completion of standard example is the Boolean lattice. (That is, this is also kind of standard example showing that completion by cuts can be exponential in size.) But then, doc can not say every mathematical fact.

What kind of reference? Googling founds books "Handbook of Discrete and Combinatorial Mathematics" and "Introduction to Lattice Theory with Computer Science Applications" and there are many papers. And Wikipedia uses the term.

But what is more important, I have not seen this poset named as something else, and neither seen "standard poset" used to refer any other poset.
