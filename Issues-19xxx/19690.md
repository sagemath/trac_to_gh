As #19383 seems dead (and latest push do not merge anymore), I suggest adding standard example in it's own in this ticket.

It is logical to have `StandardExample(n)` to always have dimension `n`. This is not the case when `n=1`. Hence I added a restriction `n >= 2`.

What kind of reference? Googling founds books "Handbook of Discrete and Combinatorial Mathematics" and "Introduction to Lattice Theory with Computer Science Applications" and there are many papers. And Wikipedia uses the term.

But what is more important, I have not seen this poset named as something else, and neither seen "standard poset" used to refer any other poset.

I would add both references.

I made a few tweaks to the documentation. Once you add the references, you can set this to a positive review on my behalf (in part because I can't think of a better name at this point).
