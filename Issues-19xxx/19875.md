Sage currently ships MathJax 2.5. [MathJax 2.6 was released 2015-12-30](https://www.mathjax.org/news/).

Upgrading would solve the trailing vertical bar that appears after each
mathjax-rendered formula in the Chrome and Opera browsers, see eg

http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/rings_standard/index.html

as a result of a known MathJax bug fixed in MathJax 2.6, see

https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax/issues/1300

I'm not sure if this is the ticket for it, but just regarding building the documentation, it would help to just point to mathjax's latest version in the CDN. Maybe, that could be an option, set by an env variable? But I have no idea how this is setup right now and how hard it would be to make the URL of mathjax dynamic.
