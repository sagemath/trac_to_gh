Sage currently ships MathJax 2.5. [MathJax 2.6 was released 2015-12-30](https://www.mathjax.org/news/).

Upgrading would solve the trailing vertical bar that appears after each
mathjax-rendered formula in the Chrome and Opera browsers, see eg

http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/rings_standard/index.html

as a result of a known MathJax bug fixed in MathJax 2.6, see

https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax/issues/1300
