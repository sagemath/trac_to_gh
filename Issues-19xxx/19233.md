Hi Paul,

this is different from the build failure that is currently on the `gmp-ecm` tracker. By the look of things it is something that has been going on for a while but xcode 7.0 made it break. With the previous version of xcode we had this kind of message

```
/bin/sh ../libtool   --mode=compile gcc  -march=corei7 -mtune=corei7-avx -g -O3  -fPIC -c -o mulredc1.lo mulredc1.s
libtool: compile:  gcc -march=corei7 -mtune=corei7-avx -g -O3 -fPIC -c mulredc1.s -o mulredc1.o
/bin/sh ../libtool   --mode=compile gcc  -march=corei7 -mtune=corei7-avx -g -O3  -fPIC -c -o mulredc2.lo mulredc2.s
libtool: compile:  gcc -march=corei7 -mtune=corei7-avx -g -O3 -fPIC -c mulredc2.s -o mulredc2.o
mulredc2.s:40:Alignment too large: 15. assumed.
mulredc2.s:150:Alignment too large: 15. assumed.
/bin/sh ../libtool   --mode=compile gcc  -march=corei7 -mtune=corei7-avx -g -O3  -fPIC -c -o mulredc3.lo mulredc3.s
libtool: compile:  gcc -march=corei7 -mtune=corei7-avx -g -O3 -fPIC -c mulredc3.s -o mulredc3.o
mulredc3.s:40:Alignment too large: 15. assumed.
mulredc3.s:26:Alignment too large: 15. assumed.
```
As can be seen in the log attached to the ticket "it stopped" assuming and decided it was invalid.

I see two ways to solve this issue:

1) the easy way with `--disable-asm-redc`. There should not be too much speed regression (if any).

2) the hard way. Maybe the alignment values should be replaced by something different, or simply removed. If GMP compiles successfully on the same machine, you could copy what GMP does. It seems other people hit the same issue, but I say no definite solution with google.

I didn't say it correctly: those files can be autogenerated, but they're not by default. The file `x86_64/README` explains why:

```
mulredc[1..20].asm are size-specific asm functions for mulredc.
These are generated by the Python autogen.py script (old version, still
used for sizes 1 and 2) and the m4 script mulredc.m4 (all other sizes). 
In order to avoid dependency on the Python and m4 packages, this generation 
is not done automatically with the autoconf/automake stuff.
```

You could have changed the comment as well, as the L1 cache line size is 64 bytes on any (recent) Intel x86_64, too. ;-)

indeed, I've changed Opteron to x86_64 upstream (revision 2974).
