Now with hermite normal forms. Added a new algorithm choice ("flint") to hermite form, and updated cutoffs to account for the fact that pari0 generally beats flint < 125 rows/cols and FLINT wins above that. pari1 and pari4 seem to always be much worse, as is ntl and the built-in padic method, but I only tested up to matrices of a few hundred entries. Also, flint does better for smaller matrices with larger entries, so that should be accounted for as well, but this is a reasonable first pass.
