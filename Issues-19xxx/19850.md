We have

```
sage: log(2).is_constant()
False
sage: SR(2).is_constant()
False
```
which is confusing. Moreover, it is inconsistent with

```
sage: P.<p> = ZZ[]
sage: P(2).is_constant()
True
```

<a id='comment:2'></a>I've created a patch. The old `is_constant` was renamed to the private `_is_registered_constant_` and a new `is_constant` was created (simply chekcing if the symbolic expression contains a variable).

I also did

```
sage -grep "is_constant"
```
and look at the rest of the library; only at one point there the now old `is_constant` was used:

```
sage/interfaces/maxima_lib.py:    elif expr.is_symbol() or expr.is_constant():
```
changed to `_is_registered_constant_`
