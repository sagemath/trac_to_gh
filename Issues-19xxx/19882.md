> So, what should be done ?

As quick fix, the following might work:

1. try to build the documentation normally.
2. if that fails, run `make doc-clean` and rebuild the documentation.

Step 1 is crucial to avoid a lot of needless rebuilds of the documentation.

The current Makefile already calls `$(MAKE)`, see e.g. in #18710:

```
bdist-clean: clean

```

That said, there is no real recursivity since the `doc` target depends on `doc-html` and `doc-clean`, and none of those depend on `doc`, so i do not see any loop possibility. I am currently doing a few tests to see how it works in various cases.

Maybe you can solve this with an extra level of indirection:

```
doc-html: $(DOC_DEPENDENCIES)
    $(MAKE) docbuild-html || ( $(MAKE) doc-clean ; $(MAKE) docbuild-html )

docbuild-html:
    cd ../.. && sage-logger './sage --docbuild --no-pdf-links all html $(SAGE_DOCBUILD_OPTS)' logs/dochtml.log
```

Ugly, but I guess it would work.

I would just create a dummy file with some simple doc<sup>1</sup>, build the doc, delete the file, and rebuild the doc (perhaps on a branch based on this one).

Alternatively, you could create a branch where you just remove a file and try to build the doc.

<sup>1</sup> - Don't forget to add an entry in the `.rst` files.

#21378 got positive review (duplicate won't fix) saying that this ticket (#19882) is a better solution. But there was no update on #19882 since 8 months...

No later than yesterday, I run `make ptestlong` overnight to realize the day after that the doc failed and no test at all were ever made:

```
[dochtml] OSError: [homology ] Exception occurred:
[dochtml] 
[dochtml] 
[dochtml] Note: incremental documentation builds sometimes cause spurious
[dochtml] error messages. To be certain that these are real errors, run
[dochtml] "make doc-clean" first and try again.
Makefile:1061 : la recette pour la cible « doc-html » a échouée
```

I would like that `make ptestlong` always work...

I guess I don't know what you mean, now that I've tested it. With the current develop branch, if I run `make` successfully, then I see

```
$ make -q
$ echo $?
1
```
So it doesn't work (IMHO) with the develop branch. It continues to not work with this branch. Is that working "as expected"?
