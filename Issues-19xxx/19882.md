> So, what should be done ?


As quick fix, the following might work:

1. try to build the documentation normally.
2. if that fails, run `make doc-clean` and rebuild the documentation.

Step 1 is crucial to avoid a lot of needless rebuilds of the documentation.

I would just create a dummy file with some simple doc<sup>1</sup>, build the doc, delete the file, and rebuild the doc (perhaps on a branch based on this one).

Alternatively, you could create a branch where you just remove a file and try to build the doc.

<sup>1</sup> - Don't forget to add an entry in the `.rst` files.

<a id='comment:17'></a>#21378 got positive review (duplicate won't fix) saying that this ticket (#19882) is a better solution. But there was no update on #19882 since 8 months...

No later than yesterday, I run `make ptestlong` overnight to realize the day after that the doc failed and no test at all were ever made:

```
[dochtml] OSError: [homology ] Exception occurred:
[dochtml] 
[dochtml]

I guess I don't know what you mean, now that I've tested it. With the current develop branch, if I run `make` successfully, then I see

```
$ make -q
$ echo $?
1
```
So it doesn't work (IMHO) with the develop branch. It continues to not work with this branch. Is that working "as expected"?
