In Sage, mathematical structures as dendrifom algebras, algebras with internal product, scalar products, *etc* involve to implement operators in several class. For example, if I wish define a new amazing operator `foo` in the category `CategoryOfSomeWonderfulStructures`, I have to do:

```python
        class CategoryOfSomeWonderfulStructures(Category):

            def super_categories(self):
                return [...]

            class ParentMethods:

                def foo(self, I):
                    '''
                    My amazing unary operator with definition
                    '''

            class ElementMethods:

                def foo(self):
                    '''
                    My amazing unary operator applied
                    '''
                    return self.parent().foo(self)

            class WithRealizations(WithRealizationsCategory):
                class ParentMethods:

                    def foo(self, I):
                        return self.a_realization().foo(I)

            class Realizations(RealizationsCategory):
                class ParentMethods:

                    def foo_by_coercion(self, I):
                         look for a good realization which knows how to foo


            class WithBasis(CategoryWithAxiom_over_base_ring):
                class ParentMethods:

                    @abstract_method
                    def foo_on_basis(self, i):
                        pass

                    def foo_by_linearity(self, I):
                        return self.linear_combination(...)
```

I propose to provide two methods (one for unary operator and one other for binary operator) such that the implementation could be simplified to 

```python
        class CategoryOfSomeWonderfulStructures(Category):

            def super_categories(self):
                return [...]

            class ParentMethods:

                def foo(self, I):
                    '''
                    My amazing unary operator with definition
                    '''

        expand_unary_operator(CategoryOfSomeWonderfulStructures, CategoryOfSomeWonderfulStructures.ParentMethods.foo)
```
