<a id='comment:2'></a>Could you add the new graph function to the index at the top of the file? Sorry for asking this now, before you even set the ticket to `needs_review`, but that's one of the things that easily goes unnoticed.

(I have plans to make the building of this index a bit easier in the future)

After fixing of tickets #19275, #19027, #19254. We can restart the work on this. I have added doctest for `G=Graph()`.
The only remaining issue is of time complexity which heavily depends on the `Partition` method of Matroids.

<a id='comment:16'></a>Several comments.

- There is a TAB that must be removed. To know that is suffices to run the tests `./sage -t src/sage/graphs/graph.py`

```
sage -t src/sage/graphs/graph.py
    Error: TAB character found at line 8648
    [1081 tests, 16.44 s]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage -t src/sage/graphs/graph.py  # Tab character found
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

- At the beginning of the method, use `r"""` instead of `"""` to enable latex mode. Then ``a`` is treated using latex

- small change to unify the style with other methods

```diff
-        - ``certificate`` -- boolean (default: ``False``) Whether to return 
-          a certificate.
+        - ``certificate`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); whether to return 
+          a certificate.
```

- ```(a, F)``` -> ``(a, F)``

- I propose to remove the seealso block and to do

```diff
-        Represent the graph as a graphical matroid, then apply matroid partition
-        algorithm in the matroids module.
+        Represent the graph as a graphical matroid, then apply matroid
+        :meth:`sage.matroid.partition` algorithm from the matroids module.
```

- add spaces around `==`, so `)==G.size()` -> `) == G.size()`

- `g=Graph()` -> `g = Graph()`

- a space is needed after the `,`, and the parenthesis are optional here

```diff
-          return (len(P),[self.subgraph(edges=forest) for forest in P])
+          return len(P), [self.subgraph(edges=forest) for forest in P]
```
