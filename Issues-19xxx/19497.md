Completely remove `Element._richcmp` and `Element._cmp`.

Add a new method `richcmp` of the coercion model which replaces the different-parents case of `Element._richcmp`.

Thanks to #19016, we can remove the `__richcmp__` in padics to make them intentionally unhashable.

Why are there both a `richcmp` in `class CoercionModel_cache_maps` and `class CoercionModel`? Moreover, in the latter it is undocumented.

Perhaps cython is smart enough to be as fast as a direct call to the C API but `PyInt_CheckExact` is faster than `PyInt_Check`... Do we really want to consider a thing inhering from `int` as an `int` in a comparison? Do you have a usecase that would help to decide?

For `CoercionModel` it is good as it is.

Both are equally fast (and very fast).

I guess so, since it will be converted to an `Integer` anyway by the coercion framework. So, the `instance()` check is really just a fast path for that.

> Do you have a usecase that would help to decide?

I don't have a particular use-case. However, given the comments above, I think that `isinstance()` is the right thing to do.
