Completely remove `Element._richcmp` and `Element._cmp`.

Add a new method `richcmp` of the coercion model which replaces the different-parents case of `Element._richcmp`.

Thanks to #19016, we can remove the `__richcmp__` in padics to make them intentionally unhashable.

For `CoercionModel` it is good as it is.

Both are equally fast (and very fast).

I don't have a particular use-case. However, given the comments above, I think that `isinstance()` is the right thing to do.
