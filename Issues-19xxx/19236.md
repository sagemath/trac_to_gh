When building in parallel and the local `mirror_list` file is not up-to-date, running `make` will start updating the `mirror_list` many times in parallel. Solve this by locking the `mirror_list` file. This will also fix potential race conditions in reading/writing the `mirror_list` file.

The most portable solution would be https://github.com/openstack/pylockfile/blob/master/lockfile/mkdirlockfile.py

Just ignoring ENOLCK is probably good enough.
