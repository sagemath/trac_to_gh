1) GQs don't necessary admit parameters; e.g.

```
o----o----o

o----o----o
```
is a GQ with 6 points and 5 lines, of which 2 are of size 3, and 3 of size 2.
(or you can take the dual, and get 5 points and 6 lines, all lines of the same size, 2, but points incident to different number of lines).
Admittedly this is a somewhat degenerate case, where either all lines have size 2, or all points are incident to exactly 2 lines; otherwise one indeed has uniformity.

2) the incidence graph is bipartite, and thus must have even girth (equal to 8, to get a GQ).

it is a definition that is unnecessarily restrictive, and actually contradicts with what wikipedia defines as a polar space. Saying that a GQ is a polar space (and it is saying it) in wikipedia sense will disallow t=1 or s=1.

well, in a comment in the code you say that the girth must be at least 7; but you never ever get 7 or any odd number...

here is another point of view: http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/2WF02/genq.pdf if my authority is not enough (I only published a dozen papers dealing with GQs :-)).

what in wikipedia is called GQ is called **regular** GQ in some other sources. They are also called GQs admitting parameters...

How would you want to see the code, then? Just a function that returns true/false, and the users can obtain the s/t by themselves through a call to is_regular/is_uniform?

There several streams to cover for GQs; in addition to already mentioned,
there is a stream where GQs without a restriction on s,t are called weak GQs, 
see e.g. http://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-0348-0271-0

Okay Dima, first you tell me that the Wikipedia definition is incorrect and ask me to implement another, and then you tell me that Wikipedia's definition is not so incorrect after all.

So let's do that: either you can give me a textbook which uses the definition that you want so that I can link to it, otherwise I will implement Wikipedia's definition which happens to coincide with "Finite Generalized Triangles" [1]

you might want to check out the definition (7.4.1 p.323) of polar space here:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B92yb82dH00zM1lNc1Y1eGVHZDQ/view?usp=sharing

that I keep in mind, instead of the wikipedia one:

A line space (P,L) is a polar space if, for each point p ∈ P and
each line l ∈ L, the set of points of l which are collinear with p, is either a singleton
or l.



They keep on mentioning GQs immediately after this definition, in Example 7.4.2:

Each projective space is a polar space in which, for each point p
and each line l, the set of points of l collinear with p, coincides with l. At the other
extreme, a generalized quadrangle is a polar space in which, for each point p and
each line l not on p, the set of points of l collinear with p, is a singleton.

I edited this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_space to begin with.

for x, y at distance j+1, it is number of neighbours of y in diameter j neighbourhood of x.

E.g. mu in SRG is c_2.

It is one of parameters of a distance-regular graph, no wonder it's used freely in [BCN]_
