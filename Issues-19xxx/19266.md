Is there a particular reason why you removed the SAGE_LOGS assignment and not the others? I would think this environment variable is still needed to be set for

```
echo >&7 " sage-logger 'sage --pip install $PKG_NAME' \$(SAGE_LOGS)/$PKG_NAME.log"
```
Or is it only okay because it will be set by `configure` and then only run in the generated `makefile` (and the others are used by `configure`)?

Just because `$SAGE_LOGS` isn't used.

You are mis-reading that. That command is writing the literal string `$(SAGE_LOGS)`, not the current value of `SAGE_LOGS`.
