`adams_operator` was added at the level of bialgebras and is defined as `\mu^{n-1} \circ \Delta^{n-1}` however in symmetric functions the method `adams_operation` is an alias to `frobenius`.  Since this is confusing.  We propose removing `adams_operation` as an alias for `frobenius`.  `adams_operation` was added in #14775, `adams_operator` will be added in #18678.

The documentation explains: The `n`-th Frobenius operator is also the `n`-th Adams operator of the `\Lambda`-ring of symmetric functions over the integers.  This does not seem to agree with what we found in a paper by Aguiar and Lauve "The characteristic polynomial of the Adams operators on graded connected Hopf algebras" which says the Adams operators are the "Hopf powers or Sweedler powers" and it gives the definition that was defined at the level of bialgebras.

I see now.  Both operations are Adams operators.
`frobenius` is the Adam's operator for the bialgebra `p_r \circ p_n = p_{rn}` and `\Delta^{\circ}(p_n) = p_n \otimes p_n`.  Thanks.  We will try to make that clear.
