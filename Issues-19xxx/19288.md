We should detect and work around this catastrophic cancellation:

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2-x-104)
sage: D = -4754362903238080086532729679384769785488*a - 46166237460580684378417136025570042177152
sage: [v(D) for v in K.embeddings(RR)]
[0.000000000000000, -9.70868378243995e40]
```

This is fixed by adding a new class `NumberFieldComplexEmbedding` (and also `NumberFieldRealEmbedding`) which automatically increases the precision when computing the image.

Note: I also do some minor clean-up in this branch, like removing redundant methods (defined more than once in the same class) and cleaning up some imports.

Note 2: When most of this patch was already written, I discovered there is a `NumberFieldEmbedding` in `src/sage/rings/number_field/number_field_morphisms.pyx` which seems to have the same purpose as my new class. I propose to deal with this redundancy later.
