We should detect and work around this catastrophic cancellation:

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2-x-104)
sage: D = -4754362903238080086532729679384769785488*a - 46166237460580684378417136025570042177152
sage: [v(D) for v in K.embeddings(RR)]
[0.000000000000000, -9.70868378243995e40]
```

This is fixed by adding a new class `NumberFieldComplexEmbedding` (and also `NumberFieldRealEmbedding`) which automatically increases the precision when computing the image.

Note: I also do some minor clean-up in this branch, like removing redundant methods (defined more than once in the same class) and cleaning up some imports.

Note 2: When most of this patch was already written, I discovered there is a `NumberFieldEmbedding` in `src/sage/rings/number_field/number_field_morphisms.pyx` which seems to have the same purpose as my new class. I propose to deal with this redundancy later.

Here is a concrete proposal:

subclass `NumberFieldHomomorphism_im_gens` with a new class `NumberFieldRealComplexEmbedding` for embeddings of number fields into `RR` or `CC`. The implementation can be close to [comment:12:ticket:19276] but more efficient.

I don't completely agree with re-purposing this ticket.  In my opinion a method `logabs()` would still be useful.  It should implement *x* ↦ log |*x*|<sub>v</sub> for any place *v*: either an Archimedean place defined by a real or complex embedding, or a non-Archimedean place defined by a prime ideal of the ring of integers.  For Archimedean places it would do this by simply computing the embedding to sufficient precision and then taking the logarithm of the absolute value.  For non-Archimedean places it should return `-x.valuation(p) * RR(p.norm()).log()`, which would presumably be more efficient than `RR(p.norm()^-x.valuation(p)).log()`.

Anyway, I'm not going to do that now, so I don't mind too much if this becomes the ticket for fixing the accuracy of real/complex embeddings.  Still, I would be in favour of having a `logabs()` method at some point (on a different ticket).

It is a pity that this ticket and the related #19362 have been abandoned, since the issues they are trying to solve still cause problems: see #29666 which I have fixed using a different approach.  Perhaps the approach used there is more generally applicable, so for the record I'll say something about it here.

Right now if you define an embedding (real, say) of a number field with some precision using K.embeddings(RealField(prec)) and then use the embedding to map individual number field elements, the images you get are in RealField(prec)  but can be very far from the correct values.
