We should detect and work around this catastrophic cancellation:

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2-x-104)
sage: D = -4754362903238080086532729679384769785488*a - 46166237460580684378417136025570042177152
sage: [v(D) for v in K.embeddings(RR)]
[0.000000000000000, -9.70868378243995e40]
```

This is fixed by adding a new class `NumberFieldComplexEmbedding` (and also `NumberFieldRealEmbedding`) which automatically increases the precision when computing the image.

Note: I also do some minor clean-up in this branch, like removing redundant methods (defined more than once in the same class) and cleaning up some imports.

Note 2: When most of this patch was already written, I discovered there is a `NumberFieldEmbedding` in `src/sage/rings/number_field/number_field_morphisms.pyx` which seems to have the same purpose as my new class. I propose to deal with this redundancy later.

Here is a concrete proposal:

subclass `NumberFieldHomomorphism_im_gens` with a new class `NumberFieldRealComplexEmbedding` for embeddings of number fields into `RR` or `CC`. The implementation can be close to [[#19276 comment:12](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/19276#comment:12)] but more efficient.

I don't completely agree with re-purposing this ticket.  In my opinion a method `logabs()` would still be useful.  It should implement *x* ↦ log |*x*|<sub>v</sub> for any place *v*: either an Archimedean place defined by a real or complex embedding, or a non-Archimedean place defined by a prime ideal of the ring of integers.  For Archimedean places it would do this by simply computing the embedding to sufficient precision and then taking the logarithm of the absolute value.  For non-Archimedean places it should return `-x.valuation(p) * RR(p.norm()).log()`, which would presumably be more efficient than `RR(p.norm()^-x.valuation(p)).log()`.

Anyway, I'm not going to do that now, so I don't mind too much if this becomes the ticket for fixing the accuracy of real/complex embeddings.  Still, I would be in favour of having a `logabs()` method at some point (on a different ticket).

 sage: [v(D) for v in K.embeddings(RR)]
 [0.000000000000000, -9.70868378243995e40]
 ```
+
+This is fixed by adding a new class `NumberFieldComplexEmbedding` (and also `NumberFieldRealEmbedding`) which automatically increases the precision when computing the image.
+
+Note: I also do some minor clean-up in this branch, like removing redundant methods (defined more than once in the same class) and cleaning up some imports.
+
+Note 2: When most of this patch was already written, I discovered there is a `NumberFieldEmbedding` in `src/sage/rings/number_field/number_field_morphisms.pyx` which seems to have the same purpose as my new class. I propose to deal with this redundancy later.

Does this really depend on #19362, which needs work?
I would be really interested in having this improved functionality and would be willing to review the ticket (but #19362 seems a bit tricky as jdemeyer wrote that he does not remember what exactly needs to be done...).
