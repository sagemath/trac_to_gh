I didn't mention that one because it is an acknowledged issue for a long time. The failure in `sage/libs/libecm.pyx` and `sage/interfaces/maxima.py` I was expecting. The other two are new I think, I'll have to check carefully.
The only way to get out of the one with `maxima` is upgrading `ecl`. For `ecm` we may have to change the doctest, I'll dig my emails to Paul about it.

I looked this up and this seems to be since GMP-4.2.3:

```
Changes between GMP version 4.2.2 and 4.2.3
[...]
  Features:
  * The allocation functions now detect overflow of the mpz_t type.  This means
    that overflow will now cause an abort, except when the allocation
    computation itself overflows.  (Such overflow can probably only happen in
    powering functions; we will detect powering overflow in the future.)
```
