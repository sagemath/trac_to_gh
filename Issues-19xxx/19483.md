Hey there!

That is weird. As far as bliss is concerned I can reproduce the bug in bliss-0.72 but not in bliss-0.73

```
azi@bodysnatcher:~/bliss-0.72$ ./bliss -directed -can -sh=f /tmp/foo.dimacs 
bliss: graph.cc:3875: virtual bool bliss::Digraph::nucr_find_first_component(unsigned int, std::vector<unsigned int>&, unsigned int&, bliss::Partition::Cell*&): Assertion `sh_return' failed.
Aborted (core dumped)
```

And

```
azi@bodysnatcher:~/bliss-0.73$ ./bliss -directed -can -sh=f /tmp/foo.dimacs 
Generator: (2,3)(6,7)
Generator: (3,5)(4,6)
Canonical labeling: (1,8)(2,7)(3,6)
Nodes:          6
Leaf nodes:     4
Bad nodes:      0
Canrep updates: 1
Generators:     2
Max level:      2
Total time:	0.00 seconds
```
|Aut|:          6

Every other heuristic -sh works as well in bliss-0.73. So that makes me wonder, are we 100% that the spkg really installs bliss?

Sorry sorry, I am a bit sick these days and with half of my brain I did not realise that indeed this 'touch' thing was a problem. I added an empty line in the file.

I did not understand what you said about the mv/cp change but I did it anyway. Could you be more verbose about it? I do not know of which dependency problem you are talking.

Thanks, and sorry if the questions are stupid. Just slept 12 hours, and I may have to do the same tonight `:-/`

Sorry, it wasn't clear indeed.

The "dependency problem" is the problem that you manually needed to touch the `.pyx` file. Let me explain more:
* with `mv`, the file is moved *with the same timestamp*, which in practice is the timestamp the package was made. So, Cython thinks this is an old file and sees no reason to recompile `bliss.pyx`.
* with `cp`, the new file really is a new file so it has a new timestamp. Cython will detect this file as changed and automatically recompile `bliss.pyx`.
