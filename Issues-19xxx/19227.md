This bug is visible at least on normal 64-bit Linux machine running self-compiled Sage. This is architechture-dependent if you have for example both integers and strings as vertices.

```
G = DiGraph({1:[2,10],2:[3],3:[4],4:[5],5:[6],10:[4]})
list(G.depth_first_search(1, distance=3))
```

This could output also `5` as it is three jumps from 1: `1->10->4->5`. It is not outputted because `4` is already marked as seen vertex for `1->2->3->4`.

Vbraun added to CC.

I am not exactly sure what counts as a bug and what not. See #18944.

I think that somebody might have code that uses this, maybe even working code (i.e. using DFS with `distance` only for trees). Can we give deprecation warning AND raise and exception? Then the user would at least know what has happened and why the code does not work any more.

Volker, #19197 contains some discussion about this; that is where Nathann saw this bug.

<a id='comment:6'></a>Hello,

the behavior of the `G.depth_first_search(1, distance=3)` is not machine dependent but it depends on the labels of the vertices which define an ordering between vertices. So if you relabel `10->1` and `1->10` in your example, you will get different result.

I don't see a bug here, I see a definition problem: what are we expecting?
If we are not able to provide a clear definition of the expected behavior of the `distance` parameter, we should not have it in DFS.

David.

So if you have labels `42` and `'hello!'`, it is machine-dependent.

I agree with that, the fact that it is architecture-dependent is merely a way to show that we will never find a clear explanation of what can be expected.

The other reason is that this being named 'distance' is very misleading.

<a id='comment:9'></a>Now I agree that not only we don't have a proper definition, but also that the result is machine-dependent.

on my mac:

True
```
on a linux desktop I have 

```
sage: 42>'hello!'
False
```


Could you:
- add your name as author
- change in the ticket description, `This should output` -> `This could output`.
- To show that the DFS can go backward, you could provide a simpler (and machine-independent) example, instead of this of `sorted([d_in.next(), d_in.next(), d_in.next()])`:

```
sage: D = digraphs.Path(10)
sage: list(D.depth_first_search(5, neighbors=D.neighbors_in))
[5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
sage: list(D.depth_first_search(5, neighbors=D.neighbors_out))
[5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

Thanks.
David.

But is plain path a good example? It won't show any difference between `depth_first_search()` and `breadth_first_search()`.
