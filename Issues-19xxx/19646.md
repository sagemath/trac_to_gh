This ticket is mostly just copying stuff from #14304 and #16664. I did add a few more changes, so somebody should still look at the branch.

Thanks for splitting this out of the other tickets.
A note on the `fq` bindings, could you add the `fq_div` functions?
They were mysteriously left out of the release when I started #16664, but should be in now.

I saw them commented out, so I didn't know what to do with them.

Note that there was no need to comment them out in the first place: it's not a problem to declare functions which don't actually exist. You will get a compiler error when you use them, but not if you just declare them.
