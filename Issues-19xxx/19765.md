The file `src/sage/data_structures/bounded_integer_sequences.pyx` should be linked to flint because it uses `FLINT_BIT_COUNT()`. On systems without a specialized assembly implementation, this needs an external variable `__flint_clz_tab`.

We fix this problem in general by adding

```
# distutils: libraries = flint
```
to the flint `.pxd` files.

Note that this change only affects `bounded_integer_sequences.pyx` since all other modules which use FLINT are already explicitly linking against `flint`.

Replying to [vbraun](#comment%3A3):
> Its a macro, not a library function.


Actually, it's an inline function calling a macro `count_leading_zeros()`.

Depending on the system, this needs `extern const unsigned char __flint_clz_tab[128]` and this is what causes the linking problem.
