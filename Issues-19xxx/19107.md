The following computation takes a lot of time:

```
sage: from sage.games.quantumino import QuantuminoSolver
sage: QuantuminoSolver(0).number_of_solutions()  # long time (several days)
```

A solution is a tiling of a 5x8x2 box. Since a 5x8x2 box has four orientation preserving isometries that preserves it, each solution up to rotation is counted four times in the computation above.

It is possible to avoid to compute 4 times the same solution. This ticket does this by choosing a piece and considering 4 times less positions for that piece.

This ticket was created from a split into two parts of #18987.

Salut,

This is bad

```
H = [h for h in G if all(i==j for (i,j) in h.matrix().nonzero_positions())]
```
You are iterating through the whole group to get the subgroup of diagonal matrices... but you know already what they are!

You can remove this line

```
assert MatrixGroup(H).cardinality() == len(H)
```

To build the cosets, you would better use something smarter

```python
G_set = set(G)
cosets = []
while G_set:
    g = G_set.pop()
    left_coset = sorted(h*g for h in H)
    right_coset = sorted(g*h for h in H)
    assert left_coset == right_coset  # must be a normal subgroup
    G_set.difference_update(left_coset)
    cosets.append(left_coset)
```

There are some trailing whitespaces in ` _rows_modpi`

... more to come

The code below would be nice but leads to this bug: #19270.

```python
from sage.misc.misc_c import prod  
it = itertools.product((1,-1), repeat=n)
if orientation_preserving:     
    H = [diagonal_matrix(L) for L in it if prod(L) == 1]
else:                                                                    
    H = [diagonal_matrix(L) for L in it]
H = G.subgroup(H)
```

If you can find a way of creating `G` and `H` so that `g * h` works and returns an hashable object for all g in G and h in H, tell me.

The documentation of both `orientation_preserving` and `mod_box_isometries` are now written in terms of the group of isometries of the n-cube. The first restrict to a subgroup whereas the second is quotient by a subgroup. And they are compatible. Tell me if it is better now.
