There are just a few wrong "REFERENCES" with double colons.

Let us correct them.

And also put the code in hexad.py into more pep8-like shape.

Some remarks:

```
-        L is a list of cards of length 6, taken from {0,1,...,11}.
+        """L is a list of cards of length 6, taken from {0,1,...,11}.
```

The usual style in Sage is to start the docstring at the line that follows `"""`


```
-        MINIMOG = self.minimog
+        # MINIMOG = self.minimog
```

Why the comment? If it is useless, why don't you remove the line?

Finally, the reference toward `error-correcting codes from game theory` (and the next one) are not formatted as they should.

You can fix those as you see fit, and set this ticket to `positive_review` afterwards on my behalf.
