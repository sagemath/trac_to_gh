<a id='comment:8'></a>Here was my testing protocol:

For each package `pkg`, start from a Sage with only

```
    make distclean
    make base
```

Then do `make $pkg` and see what happens.

The things that made me crazy is that if some package do not have a `dependencies` file, then the build system starts to build every standard package, i didn't underdtood that... Because of that "feature", we have to ensure that all dependencies of a package that is tested has a (possibly trivial) `dependency` file, recursively, or we are not testing much. So, to be tested well, this ticket should depend on #19261.

Now about the packages involved in the ticket, i had problems with the following:

- autotools still creates a bug, but i do not know what is missing, see the attached log.

- database_gap: because of the last line in `spkg-install` script, `sage -c "gap_reset_workspace()"`, it should depend on a working Sage installation. So i added `SAGERUNTIME` as a dependency. It is overkill ?

- `igraph` requires the `libxml2` (which we are not shipping), see the attached log. Perhaps we should package it, or perhaps move it to expermiental ? I added some hints on `SPKG.txt`. Moreover, from https://github.com/igraph/igraph/blob/master/debian/control it seems that `igraph` would be happy with blas/lapack and glpk, so perhaps should we also add `atlas` and `glpk` as dependencies ?

- `libtheora` depends on `libogg`, see the attached log. I updated the dependency file.

- `normaliz` depends on `boost_cropped`, see the attached log. I updated the dependency file. Also, Singular appears in the dependencies, but i am not sure it is the case, to my understanding of the documentation, i am not sure, but it seems that Singular can use Normaliz, but the converse. Shall we remove `singular` from `normaliz` dependencies ?

- i added a `# no dependencies` for `configure`.

Also, only configure is a "base" package, while "make base" installs:

```
base: $(INST)/$(BZIP2) $(INST)/$(PATCH) $(INST)/$(PKGCONF)
```

Shall those 3 packages have "base" priority too ?

Are you sure that you tested this correctly? Because it seems from the log that `ncurses` wasn't installed. Note that I added the autotools dependency in an additional commit.

> - database_gap: because of the last line in `spkg-install` script, `sage -c "gap_reset_workspace()"`, it should depend on a working Sage installation. So i added `SAGERUNTIME` as a dependency. It is overkill ?
 
No overkill, it is correct.

> Perhaps we should package it, or perhaps move it to expermiental ?

Let's leave this for now.

> it seems that `igraph` would be happy with blas/lapack and glpk, so perhaps should we also add `atlas` and `glpk` as dependencies ?

Well, `igraph` doesn't use them even if they are present. While `igraph` might be able to use those libraries, it doesn't do so by default. So no extra dependencies are needed.

> - `libtheora` depends on `libogg`, see the attached log. I updated the dependency file.
 
Good.

> - `normaliz` depends on `boost_cropped`, see the attached log. I updated the dependency file.
 
Good.

> Shall we remove `singular` from `normaliz` dependencies ?

The `spkg-install` file for `normaliz` really installs things specifically for Singular, so I think we need the dependency.

> - i added a `# no dependencies` for `configure`.
 
Well, `configure` isn't really a package... If you really want a dependencies file, it should perhaps say something like `# not a real package`.

> {{{

No. Like I said, `configure` isn't a package, but these 3 are real packages.
