In `sage.categories.pushout.SubspaceFunctor` we have the example

```
sage: M = ZZ^3
sage: S = M.submodule([(1,2,3),(4,5,6)]); S
Free module of degree 3 and rank 2 over Integer Ring
Echelon basis matrix:
[1 2 3]
[0 3 6]
sage: S.construction()
(SubspaceFunctor,
 Ambient free module of rank 3 over the principal ideal domain Integer Ring)
```
The subspace functor uses `coercion_reversed=True`. The pushout

```
sage: sage.categories.pushout.pushout(S, M)
Ambient free module of rank 3 over the principal ideal domain Integer Ring
```
is wrong.
