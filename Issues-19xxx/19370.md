Currently sage is not working at all on OS X 10.11. The aim of this ticket is to remedy to that.

Points identified so far:
* Libraries which do not have a properly set `install_name` fail to load
* The fix for #18254 (`R`) should have been applied more widely on future release
* The fix for building `git` without `openssl` on OS X in #17091 is not working anymore and needs replacing with something less subtle

Will all these problems fix `sage` can build an run on OS X 10.11. This ticket is only concerned with building `sage`, issues about binary distribution and checking of optional packages is left for other tickets.

PS: The libsingular compile log (logs/pkgs/singular-3.1.7p1.p0.log) shows that it links against omalloc. Maybe double check that its not the Singular build system's fault

I'll think about the offer but I may be too split for time to run things on the two fronts at the same time. I will definitely check what happens here regarding `singular`.

I really need to get a debug build in shape if I want to track that segfault.

OK I think the `singular` problem was due to left over stuff from an install without `SAGE_DEBUG=yes` first before a properly built version with debugging enabled. It looks all right now.

But debugging doesn't come easy

Well I had to build `ecl` without `SAGE_DEBUG=yes` for `maxima` to build. Same thing with `zn_poly`, I had to build `mpir` without `SAGE_DEBUG=yes` for it to build.

I think we are hit by this incredibly trivial (and incredibly powerful) bug in the gmp build-system: https://lists.macosforge.org/pipermail/macports-tickets/2014-September/170442.html 

The problem is that OS 10.10 and OS 10.11 are erroneously recognized as OSX 10.1 (!) Among other things this leads to a corrupted gcc which is hit by internal compiler errors when optimization is turned on.

I have added a (somewhat hasty) patch for gmp which at least fixes the two test failures t-divrem_1 and t-fat. This patch is on the trac branch u/cnassau/capitan . The gmp test-suite still fails, but now at a later stage (cxx).

Replying to [@kiwifb](#comment%3A34):
> OK testing it. Andrew, is it ok if I review your changes and you review mine? I guess Christian can do some reviewing too. That would mean we would have one reviewer that is not also an author.

Andrew's last changes for `lcalc` also fixes the one doctest failure that I saw previously. `"make ptest"` works for me now, so I think compile-wise everything is as it should be. 

I have a couple of issues on my mind that I think should be addressed. Pls feel free to convince me that these are non-issues and/or better addressed in a different ticket:

- testing compilation of optional packages (so far no tests have been done)

- how do we deal with the fact that the resulting sage is broken when you move it to a different folder?

This second issue is not fixable by changing compilation options, I believe, so we should just forbid relocation. I think something like this is required:

  1) "sage --bdist" should build sage in the directory "/Application/SageMath-$Version-..." and sage will only run in this directory.
  2) The README in the resulting app should be updated to say that the Sage icon should be dragged into the Application folder. Alternatively, we should implement an installer.
  3) `sage` should print a warning "This copy of sage can only be run in dirctory /Application/Sage..." and exit.

Thanks for your comments Christian. I believe they raise very important point.

In this ticket I focused on getting sage to build, but we may need to emphasise that it is not currently relocatable at the end of the build process somewhere. There may be ways to fix that situation in the future but unless someone builds a special tool the task is complicated.

The suggestion of building in a standard location to produce redistributable binaries is interesting.

Some optional packages may have similar issues with `install_name` that `singular` and al were displaying. Those should be inspected and fixed.

But I think we have an important milestone, `sage` can be built on `El Capitan` and I think after adding a warning we should merge it immediately. I also should note that this ticket basically fixed outstanding issues from other old tickets (#16044 and #17513 were basically all about fixing `install_names` and it is now done properly). I would argue that it generally improves the quality of the build on any version of OS X. 

Issues about producing binaries, optional package and so on can be put in a follow up ticket, let people be able to build the thing.

With this branch on OS X 10.11, Cython failed its test suite for me. See [log file http://www.math.washington.edu/~palmieri/Sage/cython-0.23.1.p0.log].

Should we set this back to "needs work"?
