This ticket aims at improving the method `valuation` for polynomials in two ways:

1. The method `valuation` for dense polynomials can be called in the following ways:
   * Without argument, return the largest power of the variable that divides the input polynomial.
   * With a polynomial (with the same parent) as argument, return the largest power of this polynomial which divides the input polynomial.

   I propose to allow another possible argument: If the argument is an element of the base ring of the parent, it returns the minimum of the valuations of the coefficients. This is consistent with PARI.

2. The method `valuation` for sparse polynomials is much less capable than the method for dense polynomials. I propose to have the same behaviors in both cases.

I don't understand what that specification means. Valuation has two arguments, namely `self` and `arg` resp. `p`. So, if the argument (`p`?) is an element of the base ring of "the parent" (the parent of `self`?) then it returns the minimum of the valuations of the arguments (i.e., of `self` and of `p` --- but with respect to what shall the valuation of `self` be taken? And what do you do if the base ring of the parent does not support a valuation, so that the valuation of `p` is not defined?).
I am sure you mean something else, but this is what I understood from your specification.

There was a typo: I meant "it returns the minimum of the valuations of the coefficients." So it means that if `self` is a polynomial over a ring `R` and `p` is an element of `R`, `self.valuation(p)` computes for each coefficient of `self` its valuation with respect to `p` and returns the minimum of these values. This is very convenient when working over `QQ['x']['y']` and asking the valuation with respect to `'x'`, or even over `ZZ['x']` and asking for the valuation with respect to any prime number.

Of course, this implies that the base ring must have a method `valuation`. The ticket is rather old so I don't have everything fresh in my memory, but do we have examples of rings that do not have such a method?
