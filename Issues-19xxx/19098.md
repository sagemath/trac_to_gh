implement Taylor 2-graphs for U_3(q) and related srg's; 
the latter have to be constructed directly, as the two-graph gets very big and slow.

see §7E of [Brouwer and van Lint](http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/preprints/srgsurvey.pdf) and note the [correction](http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/preprints.html) saying 

§7E, A construction by D. Taylor, it should say: ... 
"the triples {x,y,z} for which H(x,y)H(y,z)H(z,x) is a square in GF(`q^2`) if q ≡ 3 mod 4, a nonsquare if q ≡ 1 mod 4"

It committed suicide last month, but through an exorcist I was able to get in touch with one of its members: what about just removing the only entry that exists in this file, given that it is not representative of anything, instead of leaving it alone and adding your note?

Two questions about this branch:

- It seems that you do not use the `taylor_twograph` function anywhere. If you
  think that it is useful in its own right I do not mind, but I couldn't help
  but notice the apparently large overlap between the code of `taylor_twograph`
  and the code of `TaylorTwographDescendantSRG`. Couldn't you let one of the two
  functions call the other? Especially since with the speedup commit, it takes
  less time to build the graph.

- I do not understand the point of this line. Could you explain? To me all it
  does is add a vertex `v0`
  {{{
  G = H.union(Graph([[v0], lambda x, y: x != y])) # to make sure vertices are not relabeled

OK, see my last commit.

it makes `Graph([v0])` have vertex named by what's in `v0` rather than just by number 0.
And so `G`'s vertex names stay uniform. Perhaps there is a less ugly way, I don't know.

What about `your_graph.add_vertex(v0)`?

<a id='comment:43'></a>Hellooooooooo,

- Could you add an INPUT: section for every function that takes arguments as input?

- It is not necessary to check in `taylor_twograph` that `q` is an odd prime power, as this is done by the call to the subfunction

- Why?

```diff
-        sage: G = SRG_253_140_87_65()                # optional - gap_packages
-        sage: G.is_strongly_regular(parameters=True) # optional - gap_packages
+        sage: G = SRG_253_140_87_65()
+        sage: G.is_strongly_regular(parameters=True)
```

- (Unrelated) turns out that we have another problem with names

```
sage: graphs.strongly_regular_graph(126,50,13,24)
Subgraph of (Distance graph for distance 2 in ): Graph on 126 vertices
```

oops, I forgot to merge later updates to #19133. Fixed in the last push, as well as fixed
a further trivial typo in #19133.

IMHO all these `SRG_...` functions ought to return proper graph names.
not on this ticket...
