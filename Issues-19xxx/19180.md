You mentioned (on https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-support/dPG73HQZK-Y) that the function takes 40s. I don't have time right now to check out the ticket and compile and test, but I get

```
sage: %timeit L = [ w for w in codes.ExtendedQuadraticResidueCode(47,GF(2)) if w.hamming_weight() == 12 ]
1 loops, best of 3: 16.4 s per loop
```

By the way, glancing through your code, you should probably use `hamming_weight` and not `sum` to determine the hamming weight. Sum could (should?) behave as over `GF(2)` in something like this code.

Right, it is faster indeed. It now takes ~12s. `hamming_weight` does the job at a much lower level.

> and not `sum` to determine the hamming weight. Sum could (should?) behave as over `GF(2)` in something like this code.


I apply it to ints, not to `GF(2)` elements.

Thanks,
