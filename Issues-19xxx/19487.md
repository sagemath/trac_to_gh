Ooh fugly, unzip and re-tar and pipe and untar? Of course its really the original script's fault for not being modular...

Can we at least put sage-unzip into build/bin/ and not expose it via a `sage -unzip` command line argument? It has no mathematical purpose, its just an internal tool for building Sage packages.

neither `sage --git`, nor `sage --twisted` have any maths purpose, yet they are still there...

Yeah well. I minimize my changes to the current scripts. So I adapted to what was already there. I loved that line in particular:

```
lbzip2 -d -c "$1" 2>/dev/null || bzip2 -d -c "$1" 2>/dev/null || gzip -d -c "$1" 2>/dev/null || cat "$1"
```

> Can we at least put sage-unzip into build/bin/ and not expose it via a `sage -unzip` command line argument? It has no mathematical purpose, its just an internal tool for building Sage packages.

Can you make this comment on the right ticket, i.e. #19484?

The GNU sed implementation explains pretty well what are GNU extensions. And yes, if one always used the GNU version it's stunning how restrictive the classic UNIX versions were.

Perhaps best to rewrite the whole thing using a sequence of bash substitutions instead.

It does not work. UNIX sed does not understand any command line option with double dashes.

And, by the way, your original regexp does not work because you're confusing [] and \( \).

Do you mean the " ? Are those called "double dashes" ? Does it still fail if you use simple quotes instead, i.e. `sed --posix 's/[\.zip|\.tar|\.gz]*$//g'`

By double dashes, he meant the option `--posix`.

On OS X, use the `-E` flag for sed:

```
echo whatever.tar.2.0.zip.tar.gz.tar.tgz | sed -E "s/(\.zip|\.tar|\.gz|\.tgz)*$//g" 
```
But `-E` is not a posix option or a GNU sed option, so I guess we can't use it. A Python script would avoid these compatibility issues.

Oh, okay sorry. This being said, my command also works without the '--posix'. So if we can have 

```
~$ echo whatever.tar.2.0.zip.tar.gz.tar.tgz | sed "s/[\.zip|\.tar|\.gz]*$//g"

Hello !

I updated this ticket a bit in order to use the original .zip archive for the bliss package. It is the same version as the one we use, so it is not even a package update and there is no risk of anything. I used to test the ticket, and it works well: if you also agree with it, then we can get it merged.

Thanks,

Nathann
