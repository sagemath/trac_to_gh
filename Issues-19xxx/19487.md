Yeah well. I minimize my changes to the current scripts. So I adapted to what was already there. I loved that line in particular:

```
lbzip2 -d -c "$1" 2>/dev/null || bzip2 -d -c "$1" 2>/dev/null || gzip -d -c "$1" 2>/dev/null || cat "$1"

It does not work. UNIX sed does not understand any command line option with double dashes.

And, by the way, your original regexp does not work because you're confusing [] and \( \).

Do you mean the " ? Are those called "double dashes" ? Does it still fail if you use simple quotes instead, i.e. `sed --posix 's/[\.zip|\.tar|\.gz]*$//g'`

Yep yep sorry, I noticed that while working on this new version. Which seems to work reliably, on my distro at least.
