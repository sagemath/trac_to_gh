Ooh fugly, unzip and re-tar and pipe and untar? Of course its really the original script's fault for not being modular...

Can we at least put sage-unzip into build/bin/ and not expose it via a `sage -unzip` command line argument? It has no mathematical purpose, its just an internal tool for building Sage packages.

neither `sage --git`, nor `sage --twisted` have any maths purpose, yet they are still there...

Yeah well. I minimize my changes to the current scripts. So I adapted to what was already there. I loved that line in particular:

```
lbzip2 -d -c "$1" 2>/dev/null || bzip2 -d -c "$1" 2>/dev/null || gzip -d -c "$1" 2>/dev/null || cat "$1"
```

> Can we at least put sage-unzip into build/bin/ and not expose it via a `sage -unzip` command line argument? It has no mathematical purpose, its just an internal tool for building Sage packages.

Can you make this comment on the right ticket, i.e. #19484?

It does not work. UNIX sed does not understand any command line option with double dashes.

And, by the way, your original regexp does not work because you're confusing [] and \( \).

By double dashes, he meant the option `--posix`.

On OS X, use the `-E` flag for sed:

```

> Your command works but is probably not what we want. The regular expression `[\.zip|\.tar|\.gz]*` matches any string formed by the characters between the brackets, so it is equivalent to `[\.ziptarg|]*`.

Arg... Yeah, it just doesn't work at all. Sorry `:-/`

I'll try to find something else `:-/`

Hello !

I updated this ticket a bit in order to use the original .zip archive for the bliss package. It is the same version as the one we use, so it is not even a package update and there is no risk of anything. I used to test the ticket, and it works well: if you also agree with it, then we can get it merged.

Thanks,

Nathann
