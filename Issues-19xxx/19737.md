The docstring of `SetPartition.to_permutation` says:

```
Convert self to a permutation by considering the partitions as cycles.
```
However, I was very surprised to learn that it does not do this by sorting the blocks.  That is, there is currently no guarantee that:

```
SetPartition([[1,2,3]]).to_permutation() == Permutation([2,3,1])
```
Since this caused some discomfort (I thought a conjecture I like a lot would be wrong...) I propose to change this behaviour.

The following looks reproducible:

```
p = SetPartition([(1, 9, 8), (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)]); p.to_permutation().cycle_tuples()
[(1, 9, 8), (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)]
```

**Keywords:** set partitions, permutations

Oh, I missed that, I thought that Permutation would handle bijections, not just Permutations of `{1,...,n}`.  That's really strange, I must say.

Hm, now I'm not sure what should be done.  I guess, the only reasonable thing then is to fail when the ground set is not of this form.  Well, that might make sense anyway.

On the sage-devel thread I opened (se [comment:6]) I proposed to rename the class (or to create a new one) which checks from the start that its ground set is 1...n. This way, one could write methods like `to_permutation` without having to check it manually, each time.

There is a usage from a `SetPartition` class with arbitrary ground set (I do have examples in mind) and usage for a specific `IntegerSetPartition` class restricted to those 1...n integers, which is the only case many seem to be interested in.

Mixing the two, as it is done in this class, is a bad idea.

I am not quite convinced that this is true.  But if you are convinced, is there an easy way to do it?  Can I simply do

```
class IntegerSetPartition(SetPartition):

    def to_permutation(self):
        ....

```

where should I put the check that the ground set is {1,...,n}?

To me such a design would work nicely. And the check that is needed by all those functions can be performed there:

```
class IntegerSetPartition(SetPartition):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        SetPartition.__init__(self,**kwargs)
        assert set(self.base_set()) == set(range(self.base_set_cardinality()))
```

Or something nicer, which would yield a clearer error message when the input is wrong.

I believe that this is the way to go. Really, look at the functions of `SetPartition`: how many are defined for integer partitions *only*? I don't know much about this kind of combinatorics, but `is_noncrossing` seems to be of that kind. Hell, I'd even be surprised if less than half of the methods of `SetPartition` should not be there, or is plain broken (.N(), .base_extend(), .base_ring(), .count(), db(), .n(), .numerical_approx(), .rename(), .reset_name(), .subs(), .substitute(), .version()).

I'm guessing this is because `SetPartition` uses `__metaclass__ = InheritComparisonClasscallMetaclass`, whatever that is.

Also, I have to remark that none of `.N(), .base_extend(), .base_ring(), .count(), db(), .n(), .numerical_approx(), .rename(), .reset_name(), .subs(), .substitute(), .version())` are defined in `SetPartition`.  Eg., `.N()` is from `Element`.

> Turning `SetPartition` into a function would really be a completely new design.  Out of curiosity: why would you dislike this solution, too?


Because I love simple things. From time to time I have to touch combinat code, and from time to time I have to use 'isinstance'. And, well, `isinstance(my_object,IncidenceStructure)` works but `isinstance(my_object,Poset)` does not, because the first is a class while the other is not.

Usually in Sage we have a way to tell whether something is a function or a class: MyClass is a class, and `my_function` is a function.

But well, what is true in Sage and what is true in the combinat/ folder are different things.

Hellooooo,

> For example, in Aldor I can simply say: if the parameters are the integers from 1 to n, then export the method "to_permutation" (i.e., make it visible to the user). Otherwise, do not export this method.


Sounds hard to write documentation for something like that. To me it sounds like the other approach "Have every method available, but check that the data is what you expect before running the computation and raise a *clear* error message if it is not".

You would have all methods available, some of which would raise an exception. Not ideal, but at least you don't wonder where the method is. Well, this being said I can totally hear that when one is used to this behaviour, one expects this kind of situation too.

> OK, but you said you don't like `SetPartition` having methods that do not apply to all its instances.  Or would you prefer to type `IntegerSetPartition` all the time, and make `SetPartition([This is the Trac macro *1* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#1-macro))` and `IntegerSetPartition([This is the Trac macro *1* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#1-macro))` different objects?


That's indeed how I would have implemented it. Two classes, one which inherits from the other.
