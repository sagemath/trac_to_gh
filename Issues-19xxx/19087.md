I thought we had a `'auto'=='automatic'` in that event?  Man, I really have not been keeping up.

```
sage: polar_plot(sec(x),(x,-pi/8,pi/8),ticks=[.1,None],aspect_ratio='automatic') 
/Users/karl.crisman/Downloads/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/repl/rich_output/display_manager.py:570: RichReprWarning: Exception in _rich_repr_ while displaying object: Expand the range of the independent variable to allow two multiples of your tick locator (option `ticks`).
  RichReprWarning,
Graphics object consisting of 1 graphics primitive
```
It still shouldn't say it returns a graphic object, should it?

plot() does return a graphics object, this is precisely what is wrong with plot. It shouldn't return a graphics object if the input is invalid. But it does, and the graphics object can't display itself graphically.
