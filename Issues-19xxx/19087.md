Its `aspect_ratio='automatic'`. Really the fault of plot for not verifying input and then tripping over its feet with useless diagnostics when its time to display the plot.

It still shouldn't say it returns a graphic object, should it?

plot() does return a graphics object, this is precisely what is wrong with plot. It shouldn't return a graphics object if the input is invalid. But it does, and the graphics object can't display itself graphically.
