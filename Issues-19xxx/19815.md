Where do the extra two zeroes come from/go to?

```
sage: QQbar(e^(pi*I/3))
0.500000000000000? + 0.866025403784439?*I
sage: QQbar(1/2+I/2*sqrt(3))
0.50000000000000000? + 0.866025403784439?*I
```

If you don't get the number of digits you ask for then there is something to work on, but I don't think QQbar has a responsibility to work internally with a particular number of digits -- only with enough digits to distinguish numbers uniquely (if taken together with their minimal polynomials)",
