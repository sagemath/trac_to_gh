There should be the ability to convert binary and hex strings into elements from the fields `GF(2^n)` and `GF(2^(4n))` and vice versa.

- A field `GF(2^(4n))` should accept length `n` hex strings of the form `0xfff...` and produce the corresponding field element.
- A field `GF(2^n)` should accept length `n` binary strings of the form `0b111...` and produce the corresponding field element.
- Elements of the field `GF(2^(4n))` should be able to convert themselves into length `n` hex strings of the form `0xfff...`.
- Elements of the field `GF(2^n)` should be able to convert themselves into length `n` binary strings of the form `0b111...`.

One of the ultimate goals for adding this is to use it for conversion in cryptographic modules which involve finite fields, such as `mq.SR`.

Why strings? I think it's better to deal with numbers and then convert the numbers to strings if needed.

And this is already implemented in one direction:

```
sage: K.<a> = GF(2^8)
sage: (a^3+1).integer_representation()
9
sage: hex((a^3+1).integer_representation())
'0x9'
```

For the other direction (number -> field element), I propose to use `__getitem__` for this.

In crypto people really like to write 0xdeadbeef for a 32-bit number and so.

Sure, I believe that. I just don't think that Sage finite fields should directly deal with such strings. We already have conversion between strings and integers, so it makes much more sense to implement conversion between finite field elements and integers.

The finite field:

```
sage: K.<a> = GF(2^8)
sage: K[9]
a^3 + 1
sage: K[0x9]
a^3 + 1
```

Uh ... what? Where does this enumeration order on K come from? I think you mean the element for which the coefficient vector with respect to the power basis on a corresponds to the bit vector corresponding to the binary representation of the index, but that requires further adaptations. Surely we'd need it to bring agreement with

```
sage: list(GF(2^8,name="a"))[9]
a^5 + a^4 + a^3 + a
```
which seems motivated by

```
sage: K.<a> = GF(2^8)
sage: L=list(K)
sage: M= [0] + [a^i for i in [1..255]]
sage: L==M
True
```

Bringing two things in arrangement can be solved by changing either of the two things. My vote would be on changing `list(GF(q, impl="givaro"))` since it's implementation-dependent:

```
sage: list(GF(8, 'a', impl="givaro"))
[0, a, a^2, a + 1, a^2 + a, a^2 + a + 1, a^2 + 1, 1]
sage: list(GF(8, 'a', impl="ntl"))
[0, 1, a, a + 1, a^2, a^2 + 1, a^2 + a, a^2 + a + 1]
```

```
sage: list(GF(13, 'a', impl="givaro"))
[0, 2, 4, 8, 3, 6, 12, 11, 9, 5, 10, 7, 1]
sage: list(GF(13, 'a', impl="modn"))
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]
```
