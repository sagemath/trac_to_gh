This is a long but quite trivial patch. Mostly bikeshedding.

I don't know easy way to make `with_bounds()` work with non-facade posets. At least now the code gives nicer error message. I also changed `completion_by_cuts()` to return the empty lattice from the empty poset. It is now consistent with definition "smallest lattice containing..."
