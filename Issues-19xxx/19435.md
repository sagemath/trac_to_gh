<a id='comment:2'></a>This is a long but quite trivial patch. Mostly bikeshedding.

I don't know easy way to make `with_bounds()` work with non-facade posets. At least now the code gives nicer error message. I also changed `completion_by_cuts()` to return the empty lattice from the empty poset. It is now consistent with definition "smallest lattice containing..."

This is true, and I do not know a good way to overcome this. `# random order` is one possibility. For a user perspective I see no problem when documentation says that a function returns `[3, 5]`, but he/she gots `[5, 3]`; if the user has any clue at all, he will understand that the list represents a set.

For some posets we could use `linear_extension=True`, but it only applies to list of elements, and is kind of noise to the user.

Could we have an option to show this clearly? I.e. somehow show what are "original" and "added" elements on the completion?
