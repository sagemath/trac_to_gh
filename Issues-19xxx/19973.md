Here is a fix to a few cases where things fail with immutable graphs due to `subgraph` preserving the mutability of the graph. The affected methods are `traveling_salesman_problem` (and then also `is_hamiltonian` and `hamiltonian_cycle`) and `is_clique` with the parameter `directed_clique=True`.

These problems have either been missed, or, more likely, introduced in #19526.

Hi!

This is the default for `subgraph` since #19526 (if that's what you meant). But in these cases the algorithms change these subgraphs (in fairly trivial ways, but still), so we need them to be mutable.
