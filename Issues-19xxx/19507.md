It is encouraged that concrete parents be a subclass of `UniqueRepresentation`, it gives us default `__hash__`, `__eq__` (which actually, I think I just broke by not removing the `__eq__` and I will fix shortly), and pickling, and it helps in standardizing the input.

> Travis: if you are OK with my changes, please set to positive_review. And sorry for the delay in about everything I'm doing.


This isn't quite right:

```
- ``category`` -- (default:
  ``MagmaticAlgebras(k).FiniteDimensional().WithBasis()``
  when ``assume_associative`` is ``False``, else
  ``Algebras(k).FiniteDimensional().WithBasis()``)
```
as the latter category also has the unital assumption and is not what the code uses. I will tweak this when I fix the hash issue noted above.
