This is an improvement to the analytic_rank() function in the Elliptic curves over the rational numbers class. The current implementation only produces a value that is probably the analytic rank. This ticket is based on error bound computations to give a provable value of analytic rank. The computations were derived in my MSc thesis, "Proving the weak BSD conjecture for elliptic curves in the Cremona Database".

I noticed that the old 'pari' code for analytic rank manages to call ellanalyticrank *twice* which should be fixed whether or not we keep this.  But I hope it will be judged as correct, since I use the analytic rank function a lot.

I suspect that that the author has disappeared as this is the work of a 5-year old MSc thesis.

<a id='comment:14'></a>A few comments:

The while loops in the last few functions can be simplified.

Why is k>15000 an indication that something is wrong? Doesn't k increase as sqrt{N} and so we expect it that large when the conductor is in the millions.

I guess we are certain that precision loss in the sum is never larger than epsilon, are we?

The sums can be made a bit faster by using Horner's scheme; especially in _G2 etc. Though I would guess that these sums are already implemented in pari. Probably much faster.
