<a id='comment:12'></a>RTFM :-) The most meaningful output seems to be with `contours=0`. The docs of `contour_plot` say

```
  * "contours" -- integer or list of numbers (default: "None"): If
     a list of numbers is given, then this specifies the contour
     levels to use.  If an integer is given, then this many contour
     lines are used, but the exact levels are determined
     automatically. If "None" is passed (or the option is not given),
     then the number of contour lines is determined automatically, and
     is usually about 5.
```
and this explains why `None` gives you nonsense, usually. `contours=1` give 2 contours, not 1, apparently there is a shift by 1 somewhere...
