From what I recall from the discussion at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-combinat-devel/_dtk67RaTFA , the `ModulesWithBasis` and `CombinatorialFreeModule` classes are supposed to be an ABC (abstract base class) and a concrete implementation, respectively. However, in practice, the former provides too little abstract interface to be useful, and so a lot of code that uses a module-with-basis as input (explicitly or implicitly) expects to be given a `CombinatorialFreeModule` instead. Usually this kind of code fails when being passed a `ModulesWithBasis` instance.

    TODO: Formulate an interface and a contract for
`FilteredModulesWithBasis` objects. Is a `CombinatorialFreeModule` with a
`degree_on_basis` method enough? Or is `basis` still needed? (See the
FIXME in `src/sage/categories/examples/filtered_modules_with_basis.py`.)

    TODO: Make sense of `A.basis(d)` for `A` a filtered module and `d` an
integer. This has always been broken.

    TODO: doctesting `A.basis(d)` for `A` graded. Very easy once above is fixed.

About why I think `FilteredModulesWithBasis` needs a contract:

Here are the methods on `F` that are used in the implementations of the
methods of `FilteredModulesWithBasis` when `F` is cast as a
`FilteredModulesWithBasis`:

```
ParentMethods:
degree_on_basis
sum_of_terms
monomial
_indices

ElementMethods:
support
leading_support
is_homogeneous
is_zero
```

I hear the quacking of a `CombinatorialFreeModule` duck here (except for
`degree_on_basis` which should be explicitly required). Are there any
more general categories which offer these methods?

I think a good part of this is taken care of by #18066, but there will probably be some remaining things related to filtered/graded modules that we will need to address.

For a package of mine, I needed these uniform accessors that would work over various kinds
of vector spaces in Sage (polymomials, ...):

https://github.com/nthiery/harmonic-modules/

See: utilitiles.py, matrix_of_vectors.py and subspace.py there.

With Darij, we made an attempt at extracting a dedicated package out of it,
with the idea of integrating it into Sage once stabilized. But we did not get
to push this further.
