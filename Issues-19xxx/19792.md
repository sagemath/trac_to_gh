The method `is_power_of` of integers does not allow to get the actual power. We introduce an option `get_data` in order that `n.is_power_of(m)` returns the number `b` so that `n = m^b`. The name of the option is inspired from `is_prime_power`

```
sage: 16.is_prime_power()
True
sage: 16.is_prime_power(get_data=True)
(2, 4)
```

Moreover, it is not clear that `fmpz_remove` currently used in `_is_power_of` is the fastest way of checking whether an integer is a power of another.

Alternative: one can implement `n.logrem(b)` similar to `sqrtrem` that returns the pair of integers `(m,r)` so that `n = b^m + r` where `0 <= r < b^m+1 - b^m`

Remark: there exists in FLINT `fmpz_flog` and `fmpz_clog` that returns the floor and the ceil of the logarithm in a given base (assuming that it fits into an `slong`).
