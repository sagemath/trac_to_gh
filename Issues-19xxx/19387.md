Posets included in `poset_examples.py` are not consistent as to whether they provide a `facade` option. They probably should be.

I'm ok with all the changes that were made, but I think it probably makes sense to add facade options to *all* posets in `poset_examples.py` in this ticket, rather than dragging it out over multiple tickets (it will also make it clear for the future that having a facade option is "the convention").
