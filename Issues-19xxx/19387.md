I'm ok with all the changes that were made, but I think it probably makes sense to add facade options to *all* posets in `poset_examples.py` in this ticket, rather than dragging it out over multiple tickets (it will also make it clear for the future that having a facade option is "the convention").

True, but this ticket at least do some of them, and is mergeable. The bigger the patch, the bigger change to have a collision.
