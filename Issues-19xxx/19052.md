The file `zero_sums.pyx` uses a variable named `_N`. It imports `ctypes.h`, which also defines `_N` on some systems (including cygwin)... The patch renames `_N` to `_level` in `zero_sums.pyx`.

Salut SÃ©bastien,

A global definition interfers with an attribute of a class!? Cython should be able to compile the following

```
cdef n
cdef class A:
    cdef n
```
(and it does for me)

No, it is a preprocessor command `#define _N 04` in `ctypes.h`... Which, of course, breaks every appearance of `_N`...
