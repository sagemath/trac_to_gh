This introduces a new "script" type of packages that only run a script. This is supposed to be an alternative for optional/experimental packages so we can use third-party package managers to install things. 

In this case, the R package manager, though it would presumably be useful for TexLive (instead of `src/ext/texlive/texlive-install`) and npm. But thats for future tickets...

Replying to [@vbraun](#comment%3A5):

This describes a way to test dependencies:
[http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/packaging.html#package-dependencies](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/packaging.html#package-dependencies)

If `make distclean && make base && make PACKAGE_NAME` succeeds, the dependencies are probably correct.

I would certainly like to make `dependencies` mandatory, I am in the process of adding missing dependency files (see for example #19295).

Dear Volker,

1. Great idea ! I am sure a lot of use cases exist in the Sagemath ecosystem.

2. Your ticket (tested against a fresh clone of 6.10rc0) :
* builds, and
* passes ptestlong.
* Installing r_jupyter effectively installs an R kernel in Sagemath's Jupyter notebook.
* This notebook is functional (i. e. one can create a worksheet whose native language is R).

3. However, over Sage 6.10rcO, the Rpy2 interface cannot be used in a Sagemath notebook :
* The "%load_ext rpy2.ipython" command is not recognized
* The "%load_ext rmagic" command is recognized (with a warning), but :
* The %R (and %%R) commands are not recognized

You can compare these results (illustrated in "Untitled3-native.pdf") with those obtained on 6.10rc0+Trac#19638+manual installation of IRKernel in R, which also illustrates the problems with this current implementation :
* uses a different instance of R than the Sage's pexpect interface
* converts the output in strange formats, different from those used by Sages's pexpect interface.

If your goal was strictly limited to providing an R notebook in Sage's Jupyter, I think it's good to go. If you aimed at providing Sage with an alternative interface to R, it needs work (needs [Trac#19638](http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19638), IMHO, but I'm biased...).

I would be interested in your point of view in the question I posed in sage-devel. William's sarcastic non-answer misses a part of the point.

Sincerely yours,
