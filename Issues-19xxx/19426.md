As a suggestion: you should keep fixes for unrelated problems (like in this case the brial problem) separate from the code for this ticket (basically, separate fixes deserve separate tickets).

Hi!
I've fixed the conflict and committed the changes.

In principal, I agree with your suggestion. The problem was I could not build sage on my PC without fixing this problem, and it took a while until I could get everything to work (trac user, git, etc.).

Anyway, hopefully it can be reviewed now.
Thanks,
Eran
