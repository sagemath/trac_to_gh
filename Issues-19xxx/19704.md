Apart from needing `ABI=mode64` (a trivial change), there are linker errors because MPIR mistakes the assembly for `ppc64` as applying for `ppc64le`:

```
/usr/bin/ld: mpn/.libs/add_n.o: ABI version 1 is not compatible with ABI version 2 output
/usr/bin/ld: failed to merge target specific data of file mpn/.libs/add_n.o
/usr/bin/ld: mpn/.libs/sub_n.o: ABI version 1 is not compatible with ABI version 2 output
/usr/bin/ld: failed to merge target specific data of file mpn/.libs/sub_n.o
