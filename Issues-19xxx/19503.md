```
When a user types

```
sage: foo?
```
we should hide the `TESTS` block: it should hold doctests which are too technical to be helpful. (They should still be visible from `foo??`: if a user wants to see the source code, we shouldn't hide anything.)

`TESTS` blocks should be shown in the reference manual by default, for completeness, but running `sage --docbuild --no-tests DOCUMENT FORMAT` will cause them to be skipped, as will setting the environment variable `SAGE_SKIP_TESTS_BLOCKS`.

The branch currently has two commits. One is brief and contains the main code for skipping these blocks. The other is long and does clean up on various TESTS blocks scattered through the Sage library. Some of the clean up just fixes indentation errors. Some is needed to make the blocks work with the skipping code: "TESTS::" (singular or plural, one colon or two) must be on a line by itself, so I changed

```
TESTS: text here::
```
to

```
TESTS:

text here::
```
Also, the end of a "TESTS" block is detected when we come across a word in all capitals followed by a colon ("REFERENCES:") or by a Sphinx directive (two dots, space, word, double colon, ".. TODO::"). In some cases, we had

```
TESTS:

.. note::
```
so I moved the ".. note::" to before the test, if that seemed to make sense.

I only did this when there was a block like this:

```
TESTS:
   some tests
TESTS:
   more tests
```
Then I removed the second instance.

Regarding the manual, I added something. I can put it more detail if you want.

Regarding the environment variable, is there another good way to control the docbuilding process? (Is it even worth providing the option for skipping these blocks in docbuilding?)

So you are suggesting deleting the addition to the installation guide, right? We could also add a target to the makefile that does this, by the way.

The lines after the original test,

```

are not detected by the regular expression for the end of the test, so they would be hidden upon introspection, so I moved the test from the top-level to the class being tested.

> For some time, 

The [very first example](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/master/src/sage/calculus/calculus.py) I looked at has this problem.

```
TESTS:
Substitution::
    sage: f = x
    sage: f(x=5)
    5
Simplifying expressions involving scientific notation::
    sage: k = var('k')
    sage: a0 = 2e-06; a1 = 12
    sage: c = a1 + a0*k; c
    (2.00000000000000e-6)*k + 12
    sage: sqrt(c)
    sqrt((2.00000000000000e-6)*k + 12)
    sage: sqrt(c^3)
    sqrt(((2.00000000000000e-6)*k + 12)^3)
The symbolic calculus package uses its own copy of Maxima for
simplification, etc., which is separate from the default
system-wide version::
    sage: maxima.eval('[x,y]: [1,2]')
    '[1,2]'
    sage: maxima.eval('expand((x+y)^3)')
    '27'
If the copy of maxima used by the symbolic calculus package were
the same as the default one, then the following would return 27,
which would be very confusing indeed!
::
    sage: x, y = var('x,y')
    sage: expand((x+y)^3)
    x^3 + 3*x^2*y + 3*x*y^2 + y^3
Set x to be 5 in maxima::
    sage: maxima('x: 5')
    5
    sage: maxima('x + x + %pi')
    %pi+10
Simplifications like these are now done using Pynac::
    sage: x + x + pi
    pi + 2*x
But this still uses Maxima::
    sage: (x + x + pi).simplify()
    pi + 2*x
Note that ``x`` is still ``x``, since the
maxima used by the calculus package is different than the one in
the interactive interpreter.
```
and so forth.  Obviously a lot of this is not particularly useful to end users, but a lot of this is.  (It also has `TESTS:` and not `TESTS::` though presumably that isn't relevant here.)

More examples:
* [desolvers](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/master/src/sage/calculus/desolvers.py) I assume this could be useful for some users

```
    TESTS:
    :trac:`9961` fixed (allow assumptions on the dependent variable in desolve)::
        sage: y=function('y',x); assume(x>0); assume(y>0)
        sage: sage.calculus.calculus.maxima('domain:real')  # needed since Maxima 5.26.0 to get the answer as below
        real
        sage: desolve(x*diff(y,x)-x*sqrt(y^2+x^2)-y == 0, y, contrib_ode=True)
        [x - arcsinh(y(x)/x) == _C]
```
* Presumably the only documentation for this function [here](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/master/src/sage/plot/animate.py):

```

        - ``delay_denominator`` -- denominator of the delay in seconds
        If the delay is not specified, the default from the constructor
        applies.
        TESTS::
            sage: from sage.plot.animate import APngAssembler
            sage: from StringIO import StringIO
            sage: buf = StringIO()
            sage: apng = APngAssembler(buf, 2)
            sage: fn = APngAssembler._testData("input1", True)
            sage: apng.add_frame(fn, delay=0x567, delay_denominator=0x1234)

            ...
            RuntimeError: Already reached the declared number of frames

  Yeah, I guess I'd want to know that it isn't implemented...

My point: there is an awful lot of stuff grandfathered in under this that will vanish which might end up giving ask.sagemath a lot more (unnecessary) activity.

> So I guess the question is whether to hide too much now, or to live with the situation where we don't hide anything. (I don't think we will find anyone willing to examine and evaluate each possibly omitted block, which would be the best choice.)

Then can this be made at least optional? I.e. have an environment variable or something, defaults to `True`, that controls if `TESTS` are shown with `?`? Just what is suggested to html-docs.

Sage will always be unfinished product. That it true for documentation also.

At the very least, we should keep the doc reformatting which was done in this branch.

One the one hand, I think it's good to hide the `TESTS` blocks since I don't think they contain useful information for the user.

On the other hand, I also see some value in @kcrisman's comment: are those `TESTS` blocks really bothering people?
