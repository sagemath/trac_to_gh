(FYI: `ZZ` already has an extended `some_elements()` gotten from `sage.sets.categories.EnumeratedSet`)

<a id='comment:5'></a>I'd change the short description of your `some_elements()` method to

`Return some elements of `\QQ`.`

(just for the sake of consistency; see, e.g. `random_element`).

Other than that: LGTM, the documentation builds and I'm currently testing `make ptestlong`.
