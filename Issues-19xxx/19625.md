For highest weight crystals, we can use a graded recursive set approach to construct the digraph. We move `digraph_fast` from `CrystalOfAlcovePaths` up to the highest weight crystals and deprecate `digraph_fast`.

<a id='comment:1'></a>This results in at least a 2x speedup:

```
sage: B = crystals.infinity.RiggedConfigurations(['A',2])
sage: general_digraph = Crystals().parent_class.digraph
sage: %timeit B.digraph(depth=6)
100 loops, best of 3: 6.2 ms per loop
sage: S = list(B.subcrystal(max_depth=6))
sage: %timeit general_digraph(B, subset=S)
100 loops, best of 3: 15.8 ms per loop
```

There is a mild issue of do we want a default for `depth` for infinite crystals. If we don't, this would be a change of behavior for `digraph_fast`. I don't have too strong of an opinion, but I lean towards raising a `ValueError` if it is not a finite crystal and both `depth` and `subset` are not specified.
