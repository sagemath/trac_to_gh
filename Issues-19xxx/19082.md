What do you mean? Unless I made a mistake while checking, the branch merges without conflict into 7.0.

> and I also don't see any explanation of what CBF is in the docs.

Yes, that's similar to the situation with `RR`, `CC`, `RIF`... that aren't documented in the corresponding modules either. So I'm not convinced that this ticket is the right place to make the change. But I added a commit with a bit of documentation about `CBF`; please tell me if that's what you had in mind.
