Since 

```
class GraphicsArray(WithEqualityById, SageObject)
```
 has not plot method, defined one to return self

```
    def plot(self):
        """
        Draw a 2D plot of this graphics object, which just returns this
        object since this is already a 2D graphics object.

        EXAMPLES::

            place some example here
            
        """
        return self
```

What do you suggest? Do I create another ticket for that or just leave it in this ticket?

There is an option 

```
sage --docbuild --no-plot
```

documented as "do not include graphics auto-generated using the 'plot' markup". I just tested it and it works.

That sounds familiar.  So then the question is which one should be *default*?  I think you have already linked to the discussion about that somewhere.  

PS there is at least one typo:

```
-    sage: plot(x**2, (x,0,3), ticks=[[1,2.5],pi/2], tick_formatter=[["$x_1$","$x_2$"],pi]) # long time
+    sage: plot(x2, (x,0,3), ticks=[[1,2.5],pi/2], tick_formatter=[["$x_1$","$x_2$"],pi]) # long time
```
will definitely raise an error about `x2`.

This is very nice; thank you for this work!

I've noticed some doctest error though: with sage 7.1.beta3, 
`./sage -t --long src/sage/plot/plot.py`
results in 
`Error: TAB character found at line 1518`
Indeed there are 2 tab characters at that line. 

Moreover, there are spurious blank spaces in that file. You should suppress them by telling your editor to remove trailing whitespaces.
