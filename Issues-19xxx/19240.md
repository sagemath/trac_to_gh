The name `matrix_mod2e_dense` suggests that it's about matrices in `ZZ/(2^e)ZZ`, while it's really for matrices in `GF(2^e)`.

Since the module and class names are non-public implementation details, there is no need for deprecation.

Even if you think that no deprecation is needed, I do believe that it is at least needed to be able to read old pickles of matrices over `GF(2^e)`. Users are likely to have those stored somewhere, as part of ubiquitous applications.

I don't see how you take care of that in your commit.
