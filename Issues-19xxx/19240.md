The name `matrix_mod2e_dense` suggests that it's about matrices in `ZZ/(2^e)ZZ`, while it's really for matrices in `GF(2^e)`.

Since the module and class names are non-public implementation details, there is no need for deprecation.

<a id='comment:14'></a>Since tests pass and the code and docstrings now seem fine, I'm giving it a positive review.

Unless of course you don't like my reviewer commits, or unless you worry about the patchbot reporting a slowdown in startup time (which I find hard to believe, given that you merely rename a module).
