The workarounds in #19945 and #19946 both use `rpow`. This should be documented more prominently.

Background: If `n` is an asymptotic expansion and one types `(1/2)^n`, then `__pow__` of the rationals is used. When `1/2` is not contained in the asymptotic ring, then this fails. However, it is still possible doing it with `rpow`.
