Power series with negative precision are meaningless, but Sage currently allows creating these:

```
sage: R.<x> = PowerSeriesRing(ZZ)
sage: R(1, prec=-5)
O(x^-5)
```
Furthermore, the default precision for power series rings is allowed to be negative, leading to errors in subsequent computations:

```
sage: R.<x> = PowerSeriesRing(ZZ, default_prec=-5)
sage: ~(1+x)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: N (=-5) must be a positive integer
```


Keywords: power series precision
