I had to do some computations of the following kind... which are damn slow

```
sage: w = words.FibonacciWord()[:10000]
sage: %time L = [[len(w[n:].longest_common_prefix(w[n+fibonacci(i):])) for i in range(5,20)] for n in range(1,1000)]
CPU times: user 20.6 s, sys: 44 ms, total: 20.7 s
Wall time: 20.5 s

sage: w = Words([0,1])(list(words.FibonacciWord()[:10000]))
sage: %time L = [[len(w[n:].longest_common_prefix(w[n+fibonacci(i):])) for i in range(5,20)] for n in range(1,1000)]
CPU times: user 7.99 s, sys: 56 ms, total: 8.04 s
Wall time: 7.93 s
```
and with the branch

```
sage: w = Words([0,1])(list(words.FibonacciWord()[:10000]))
sage: %time L = [[len(w[n:].longest_common_prefix(w[n+fibonacci(i):])) for i in range(5,20)] for n in range(1,1000)]
CPU times: user 172 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 172 ms
Wall time: 168 ms
```

We also implement `longest_common_suffix` and fix the following annoying feature of `has_prefix`

```
sage: W = Words([0,1,2])
sage: w = W([0,1,0,2])
sage: w.has_prefix(words.FibonacciWord())
False
```

Hello Vincent,

Looks good. A couple of remarks:

1) You *can* use min/max in Cython code. Contrary to Python `:-P`

2) longest_suffix/Python case: what about 'caching' `len(other)` instead of recomputing it at every test?

3) longest prefix/Python case: the code generated by python for this 'slice' is scary. Isn't it possible to reimplement it without it? Plus if you need to import 'islice' it is maybe better to do so at module level, it's not thaaat bad either and it may happen that the prefix be one character long, in which case importing stuff could be comparatively more expensive (?).

4) Have you considered returning a 'new word' (through new_c) even when that new word is equal to one of self and other? It would simplify the code, and I don't know if it matters as it does not allocate new memory anyway?

5) I do not understand your 'not able to initialize a word from [..]'. The code does not try to initialize a word, does it? It's more something like "unsupported type"?..

Nathann

Hello Nathann,

I implemented your remarks excepted 4. It does allocate memory to call `_new_c`: the one you need for a Python object. But I don't know whether it is justified or not (ie the ratio between "simple code" versus "efficient code").

Okay okay, you decide, just felt like bringing it up when I reviewed this code.

Stamped, and good to go.
