Hi, 

First time posting a bug report on trac. The bug I'd like to report is "random_prime" returns composite numbers for large integers. For example  


```
random_prime(100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000)
```

returned 71944724797690175157403755256108218794891687825722145298657347991279721529
which is a composite number. I am using the [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath) cloud notebook but believe it's reproducible on other implementations of Sage.

Looking at the source in rings.arith.py it seems that the problem is this line which generates a probable prime for large numbers.


```
prime_test = is_pseudoprime
```

The is_prseudoprime function then generates the erroneous output. According to the documentation this is an implementation of the Miller Rabin Test and the Lucas Test.

Suggestions: Perhaps there could be some more error checking for large numbers so Sage doesn't return obviously composite numbers?

<div id="comment:10" align="right">Comment 10</div>

As far as I can tell, that is a prime number:

```
sage: x = 71944724797690175157403755256108218794891687825722145298657347991279721529
sage: sum(x.digits())
368
sage: 3+6+8 % 3
11
sage: (3+6+8) % 3
2
sage: x.is_prime()
True
```
If I'm mistaken, could you tell me its prime decomposition?
