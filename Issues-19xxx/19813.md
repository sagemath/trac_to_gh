It makes sense to me that a vector basis should be mutable. For example, what if you wanted to normalize the basis, order it or replace a basis vector? The resulting contents of the instance could still be a valid basis. There could also be some abstract vector spaces whose basis vectors make sense as strings.

No, this is indeed quite a bad bug, since VectorSpaces are UniqueRepresentation:

```
sage: V=VectorSpace(QQ,3)
sage: W=VectorSpace(QQ,3)
sage: b=V.basis()
sage: b+="a"
sage: len(W.basis())
4
```
Note that V and W are (to the user) obtained independently, so a change on one should not affect the other.

Also note that some effort is undertaken to make the thing immutable:

```
sage: b.append("a")
ValueError: object is immutable; please change a copy instead.
sage: type(b)
<class 'sage.structure.sequence.Sequence_generic'>
sage: b.is_mutable()
False
sage: type(b).__iadd__
<slot wrapper '__iadd__' of 'list' objects>
```
So it seems we just failed to shadow the "__iadd__" method.

Specifically, in this case, the python docs (https://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html) say that `x += y` is equivalent to `x = operator.iadd(x, y)`, and `Sequence_generic` is a subclass of `list`, which implements the in-place `iadd` via mutation.

I guess we should fix the default value of `immutable` too, one way or the other:

```python
class Sequence_generic(sage.structure.sage_object.SageObject, list):
    """
    ...
        - ``immutable`` - (default: True) whether or not this sequence is           
          immutable
    ...
    """
    def __init__(self, x, universe=None, check=True, immutable=False,
                 cr=False, cr_str=None, use_sage_types=False):

The delegation behavior of `iadd` and `imul` is reasonable, but I think the docs should mention that they'll give you back a copy when `immutable=True`.

But before we address **that**... there's actually another bug that the description highlights: should these methods always return another sequence? And when they do, what should its universe be? The immutable behavior now returns a list, which I personally would not expect:

```python
sage: s = Sequence([1,2], immutable=True)

```

The mutable behavior, on the other hand, can invalidate the universe:

```python
sage: s = Sequence([ZZ(1),ZZ(2)])                                                                                                                                            
sage: s.universe()                                                                                                                                                           
Integer Ring
sage: s += [x]                                                                                                                                                               
sage: s                                                                                                                                                                      
[1, 2, x]
sage: s.universe()

```

We should probably think about that before worrying about the wording of the docs.

We should probably specify how that common parent is constructed. I suspect it should be whatever `coercion_maps(universe(seq1), universe(seq2))` comes up with. For one thing, it should not be driven by the parents of the elements (think of joining sequences of length 0).

It looks like the present version just rederives the universe from the concatenation of lists of elements. That's not what we need. Instead, we need something like:

M = Sequence([x,1])                                                         
u,v = coercion_model.coercion_maps(L.universe(),M.universe())               
import itertools                                                          
LplusM = Sequence(itertools.chain(map(u,L),map(v,M)),universe=u.codomain(),check=False)

Yes, it does that *if no universe is specified*. However, if a universe is specified, then it just coerces the elements into the universe specified. There is no "common parent discovery" necessary in that case anymore.

I maintain that operations on sequences should *not* look at individual elements (since a sequence of length 0 does not have any), but derive the universe from the universes of the input sequences.

In particular, I think it's fine to have:

```
Sequence(list1) + Sequence(list2) != Sequence(list1+list2)
```
(although I'm pretty sure it will actually hold anyway in most/all reasonable cases)

> It could probably be simplified using `coercion_model.common_parent`, but the constructor's parameter `use_sage_types=False` and fallbacks for non-coercible inputs are a complication


You should be able to tell those cases from the universes of the inputs. Perhaps if one of the input universes does not play nice with `coercion_maps`, other fallbacks are necessary (and perhaps just generate an error that no common parent can be found).

Given that previously these operations just generated a list (clearly not desirable), I don't think you need to be worried about backwards compatibility. So better start out with restrictive, well-defined behaviour. It'll become more relaxed and messy by incremental patching afterwards anyway.

Given that you're using the coercion maps in a coercion environment, I don't think you need to copy them.

In your case, you already know you're holding a reference to the domains.

I guess there may be a very small chance that the codomain is deleted just before you can get a hold of it (but the "copy" does not exclude that, because the codomain could vanish between the return of coercion_maps and the invocation of "copy"), so you could try and look if instead of coercion_maps, there is a routine that also returns the common parent (the codomain) explicitly with a strong reference. It looks like this low-probability event has been ignored and it hasn't led to big trouble (and in any case, your "copy" doesn't address it any better than just capturing the codomain explicitly). If you look in `discover_coercion` you see that `Z=pushout(R,S)` constructs the common parent, but that after that, internal coercion maps from R and S into Z are computed and that, upon return, the explicit reference to Z is dropped. So I suspect that `coerce_R` and `coerce_S` could be defunct once the return has completed, but I don't think it's ever been observed to happen.

In any case, watch out that `None` as a coercion map means identity map, so `coercion_maps(ZZ,ZZ)==(None,None)`.

Yes, the coercion model is a nasty beast to work with and has been a source of endless memory leaks.

The warning about copying the maps internal to the coercion system is only for the case when someone wants to extract a morphism for a longer time and expects that holding on to the morphism will keep domain and codomain alive.

Yes, the code is handling that already
