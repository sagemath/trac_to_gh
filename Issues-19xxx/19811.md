<a id='comment:12'></a>Well, there are four precision-related doctest failures when rebased on the latest develop branch.

Two tests got better.

One test - rising factorial - got slightly worse. This is expected as I changed the algorithm to use a gamma function quotient when n is large, which gives a speedup but slightly worse error bounds.

One test - a hypergeometric function - got a lot worse (all digits are lost). You need some 110 bits of precision now to get a similar result. The reason is that Arb uses some heuristics when choosing where to truncate asymptotic series, and these heuristics don't fully take the parameters into account. With large parameters (in this case a = 100) some precision is lost when z is not larger by orders of magnitude (in this case z = 1000+1000i).

The current code in Arb is more correct, but errs on the side of stopping early, which is worse for this particular test case.
