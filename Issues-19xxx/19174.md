<a id='comment:4'></a>It seems that there was none in the old spkg. Well. Could you add a quick one? There is a model there: http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/packaging.html#the-spkg-txt-file

You can then set this ticket to `positive_review`: I checked that the content is exactly the content of the old .spkg, installed it and ran the tests.

Thanks,
