bool((1/8*sqrt(2)*(sqrt(2)*(sqrt(2) - 2) + 4*sqrt(2)) + 1/4*sqrt(2)*(sqrt(2) - 2) + 3/4*sqrt(2) - 1/2) < (1/8*sqrt(2)*(sqrt(2) + 2) + 1/4*sqrt(2) + 1/4))
```
apparently yields `True`, though these expressions are apparently actually equal.  See [this ask.sagemath question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/29228/unexpanded-symbolic-inequalities-yield-erroneous-results/) for details.
