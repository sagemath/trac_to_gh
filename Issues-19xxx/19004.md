    "body": "<div id=\"comment:16\" align=\"right\">Comment 16</div>\n\nI'm sorry, I'm confused again. Are you just proposing the changes in the branch, or also to remove files from the server? It's important that commands like `sage --optional` still list the old-style packages. If you actually remove them from the server, that won't happen, right?\n\n```\n$ sage -i p_group_cohomology\nAttempting to download package p_group_cohomology\nError: could not find a package matching p_group_cohomology\n       Try 'sage --package list' to see the available packages\n       There is no package similar to p_group_cohomology\n```\nThen since `sage --package list` doesn't actually list `p_group_cohomology`, it is not clear how someone is supposed to find out about it or find its URL. `sage --optional` does list it, but doesn't say how to obtain it. If I were a novice user, I would be confused about whether this was a valid package or not.\n\nIt might be better if, instead of deleting item 2b, it behaved differently: it should never install a package, but only print a warning, something like: \"Old-style Sage package available from <URL>. Run <CMD> to install it. Only do this if you know what you're doing.\" In addition, it should print the apropos message (probably first), so someone running `sage -i python` will be given appropriate advice.",

<div id="comment:16" align="right">Comment 16</div>

I'm sorry, I'm confused again. Are you just proposing the changes in the branch, or also to remove files from the server? It's important that commands like `sage --optional` still list the old-style packages. If you actually remove them from the server, that won't happen, right?

```
$ sage -i p_group_cohomology
Attempting to download package p_group_cohomology
Error: could not find a package matching p_group_cohomology
       Try 'sage --package list' to see the available packages
       There is no package similar to p_group_cohomology
```
Then since `sage --package list` doesn't actually list `p_group_cohomology`, it is not clear how someone is supposed to find out about it or find its URL. `sage --optional` does list it, but doesn't say how to obtain it. If I were a novice user, I would be confused about whether this was a valid package or not.

It might be better if, instead of deleting item 2b, it behaved differently: it should never install a package, but only print a warning, something like: "Old-style Sage package available from <URL>. Run <CMD> to install it. Only do this if you know what you're doing." In addition, it should print the apropos message (probably first), so someone running `sage -i python` will be given appropriate advice.

Absolutely.
