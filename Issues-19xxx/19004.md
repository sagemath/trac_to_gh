```
$ sage -i p_group_cohomology
Attempting to download package p_group_cohomology
Error: could not find a package matching p_group_cohomology
       Try 'sage --package list' to see the available packages
       There is no package similar to p_group_cohomology
```
Then since `sage --package list` doesn't actually list `p_group_cohomology`, it is not clear how someone is supposed to find out about it or find its URL. `sage --optional` does list it, but doesn't say how to obtain it. If I were a novice user, I would be confused about whether this was a valid package or not.

Replying to [vbraun](#comment%3A17):
> Nobody in their right mind is going to want to install the old python spkg.


Absolutely.

> If you want to distribute code outside of Sage (in a spkg) then imho its not too much to ask that you also tell your users the download url.


Okay, but Simon's package is not being distributed outside of Sage: you are proposing with this ticket to move it outside of Sage. I think a deprecation period makes a lot of sense, giving the late-adopters time to update their old-style packages. It is not reasonable, on the other hand, to just say "we are immediately deleting all old-style packages from the servers with no warning."

Actually, http://files.sagemath.org/spkg/ is a better link.

The spkgs can actualy stay where they are now if we don't search for them.
