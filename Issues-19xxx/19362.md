You probably know that, but just in case: it is not strictly true that you cannot use the interval Newton method and must switch to bisection when the slope interval contains zero. Another option is to interpret 1/[-a,b] as a kind of ”projective interval” containing ∞ (which gives rise to two disjoint complex intervals after intersecting with the previous estimate, so you'll still need to deal with several pieces).
