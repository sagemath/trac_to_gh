This ticket introduces four new different decoders for GRS codes, namely:

- `GRSBerlekampWelchDecoder`,
- `GRSGaoDecoder`,
- `GRSKeyEquationSyndromeDecoder` and
- `GRSErrorErasureDecoder`.

It requires the new structure for GRS codes introduced in ticket #18928

Depends on #18928
Depends on #19897

<div id="comment:16" align="right">comment:16</div>

I removed `__ne__` method in every decoder as a generic one was implemented in another ticket, so these ones are useless.

Now, for the broken doctests, I'm experiencing a weird problem: while trying to build a [10, 5, 6]-GRS code (lines 1549, 1591, 1631 and 1669) the doctesting framework (`sage -t grs.py`) actually builds a [9, 5, 5]-GRS code. 

Which is quite weird, because if I copy these lines in my Sage terminal, everything works perfectly...

Everything else is still on the clear, so I consider this suitable for review. I'm of course working on the above.

But I can post my first comments so that you start modifying the code while I go further on key equation.\n\ncoding_theory.srt\n\n* l.125: created --> create\n* l.146: to build the [12, 6] GRS code --> to build a ...\n* in the example which follows, you give a [6, 3] GRS code (instead of [12, 6]). As your example is quite big, I think you should put the [6, 3] everywhere.\n* l.253: it seems that your decoder decodes 2 errors, whereas the [6,3] GRS minimum distance is 4. It means the standard decoder you use is not a half minimum distance one, which is quite inefficient for such a structured code. Two possibilities: either you keep this standard decoder, or you change it to Gao decoder.

Hi,

Well, I don't know key equation decoding that much, so I didn't review all the ticket yet. But I can post my first comments so that you start modifying the code while I go further on key equation.

coding_theory.srt

* l.125: created --> create
* l.146: to build the [12, 6] GRS code --> to build a ...
* in the example which follows, you give a [6, 3] GRS code (instead of [12, 6]). As your example is quite big, I think you should put the [6, 3] everywhere.
* l.253: it seems that your decoder decodes 2 errors, whereas the [6,3] GRS minimum distance is 4. It means the standard decoder you use is not a half minimum distance one, which is quite inefficient for such a structured code. Two possibilities: either you keep this standard decoder, or you change it to Gao decoder. If you choose to change, do not forget to modify the tutorial.
* l.337: put quotes around `EvaluationVector` and `C`
* l.352: match --> matches
* l.375: "The default encoder for a code is always one with vector behaviour, so when we call..." To me, this sentence is strange. Maybe "always uses vectors" or "always has a standard vector space as message space".
* l.380: whose length are --> is
* l.390: remove the "then"
* l.364, 442, 446, 550: why did you write "#random" ?
* l.547: "over which has 1" sounds weird.
* l.567: "For instance, we did not mention how Sage manages bounds on codes." Does it manage them ?
* l.585: "to create you own codes" --> your




decoders_catalog.py
* l.16: broken link with `grs.GRSKeyEquationSyndromeDecoder <sage.coding.grs.GRSKeyEquationDecoder>`


grs.py
* l. 1083: I dislike the function naming: `precompute` is too general. I also think your documentation is not precise enough : there are many monic polynomials vanishing on the evaluation points; your function returns the only one whose zeroes are exactly the evaluation points.
* l. 1107: `G = 1` --> `G = PolRing.one()`
* l. 1113: Your documentation is not very clear:
    - "Returns the greatest common divisor of a and b." --> your function doesn't do that
    - "where d is the dimension of self.code() and  k its dimension." --> I think you meant the code length for d.
    - OUTPUT: a tuple of polynomials (r, s) where r is to the xgcd of a and b and s is the Bezout coefficient of a.
      ---> as it is written, it is not an *extended* gcd algorithm, as you don't perform the "backward step". It doesn't either return a gcd, but one of its multiples. And I think you should mention the Euclidean algorithm somewhere. Maybe something like: "the algorithm performs the classical Euclidean algorithm until a remainder has degree less than (n+k)/2, and return (r,s) such that in the last step, we have r = a*s + b*t". 
* l. 1280: Don't you need to check the `input_space` also (as in GRSGaoDecoder and GRSBerlekampWelchDecoder)?
* l. 1383: if `e` is the number of erasures and `d` the minimum distance, then the decoding_radius is `(d-1-e)//2`.
* l. 1372 and after: you can remove backslashes when you wrap a line 
* l.1470: `(code.base_field())(0)` --> `code.base_field().zero()`. Besides, your comment: `ValueError("Impossible to decode a GRS code which contains 0 amongst its evaluation points")` is a bit wrong. I would prefer: "This decoder can't be initialized with a GRS code whose evaluation points contains 0"

Awesome remarks Julien.

Just a small clarification

> * l. 1083: I dislike the function naming: `precompute` is too general. I also think your documentation is not precise enough : there are many monic polynomials vanishing on the evaluation points; your function returns the only one whose zeroes are exactly the evaluation points.

To be clear: it returns the *minimal-degree* polynomial that vanishes at all the evaluation points (in the algebraic closure, that's equivalent to what you say, but perhaps not everyone would think like that).

Hello,

Thanks a lot for this thorough review work!

A general remark: at the time I wrote my thematic tutorial, there was no decoder in Sage but `syndrome` and `nearest_neighbor`, which both are quite slow - hence the small codes.
Now that we have fast decoders, I prefer to default to bigger codes than [6,3]-GRS in examples, just to illustrate that we are fast over not-so-small codes.

## `grs.py`

- I changed default decoder, which is now `Gao`.
- I rewrote the documentation of `precompute`, which is now called `_polynomial_vanishing_at_alphas`. Maybe not the best name ever (`alphas`?) but it's better than `precompute`. By the way, it's now a private method, which I think is quite better.
- I rewrote both `partial_xgcd` as you advised. I also made these private methods, which was actually written in the doc but not done in practice...
- No need to check the `input_space` in `__eq__` as it comes directly from `code`. If you check the input of all my decoders, you'll see the user only provides `code`, and the input space is extracted from `code`. As the user has no direct way to influence this, it's not necessary to test it in equality checks.
- Fixed my mistake in error-erasure decoder's `decoding_radius`.
- I removed the hideous, useless backslashes which were lurking all over the place.
- I rewrote the error message related to the construction of a key equation syndrome decoder over a GRS code including a 0 in its evaluation points. I also introduced a test to illustrate this check. 

By the way, Roth's book explains well the key equation decoding (that's where I learnt it). Chp 6, pp 183-196, especially 6.3.1 and 6.3.2 related to key equations, 6.4 for the Euclidean algorithm, 6.5 for Forney's formulæ, 6.6 for a summary of the algorithm.

## `coding_theory.rst`

- I fixed all the typos you notice.
- I "upgraded" all my [6,3] codes to [12, 6] codes. Twice better! 
- With these new codes, d/2 now equals to 3, I updated the number of errors accordingly. 
- I rewrote the weird sentences you noticed.

To answer your questions:

> l.567: "For instance, we did not mention how Sage manages bounds on codes." Does it manage them ? 

In a way. There's no central mechanism to take care of bounds, register the best upper- and lower-bound computed so far while working on a code. 
However, some bounds are implemented, and I hid them behind `codes.bounds`.
So, Sage can somehow compute a few bounds on minimum distance, best parameters for codes and so on. 

> l.364, 442, 446, 550: why did you write "#random" ? 

Because I don't control the output. E.g., l507 a random element of `C` is picked, and l550 (example flagged `#random`) I use my channel to create *randomly* some errors/erasures in it.

Now, there's a way to control this randomness: 
1) Use "hardcoded" vectors.
2) Write `set_random_seed(42)` before any random method. In that way, we guarantee the error pattern will always be the same, and thus can write the output of our method. See `channel_construction.py`, ll 210-215 for an example.

I chose to *not* use this, as it's an introductory tutorial, designed for beginners. I wanted to illustrate the ability of channels to add random errors in words, and of decoders to correct these random errors. Plus, for beginners, finding a statement such as `set_random_seed` might be confusing imho.

So I more or less sacrificed doctest purity on the altar of understandability. Which is not a big deal as these methods are properly doctested in their respective files.

Thus the following error is raised: `ValueError: The dimension must be a positive integer at most the length of the code.` I suggest two solutions (but the second one seems to be the best one, see remark below):\n  - we prevent the construction of a decoder for such a code (in a way, it has no sense to decode that code)\n  - the decoder returns the input word\n\n- when running [`Gao`/`Key`/`Berlekamp`] decoder with a GRS code of dimension k=n-1 (distance 2) on a noisy word with 1 error, some weird things happen (for the moment, I don't have any solution for these issues):\n  - for `KeyEquationDecoder`, it tries to decode and fails almost every time (I would say with proba (q-1)/q, as if it was random).\n  - for `GaoDecoder`, `decode_to_code` raises `ValueError: The polynomial to encode must have degree at most k-1 when trying to re-encode the message`. It means `decode_to_message` outputs a polynomial with too high degree (k).\n  - for `BerlekampDecoder`, that's a random mix of the two previous behaviour (sooo weird...).\n\nIn fact, the previous issues are more important that I thought. For example, see the following script:\n\n```\nC = codes.GeneralizedReedSolomonCode(GF(16,'a').list()[1:], 12)\nD = C.decoder('ErrorErasure')\nChan = channels.ErrorErasureChannel(C.ambient_space(), 0, 3)\nc = C.random_element()\ny,era = Chan(c)\nmp = D.decode_to_message(tuple([y, era]))\n```\nThe [15,12,4]-GRS code is clearly not a trivial code, but I still get the strange error from the \"full code\", because in the `ErasureError` decoding algorithm, we puncture the code on erasures, and call the error decoding algorithm on the punctured code (which is the full code).\n\n*** Another remark ***\nIf you set Gao decoder as the default decoder for GRS, you should also set `EvaluationPolynomial` as the default encoder, otherwise we do not have `decode_to_message(encode(x)) = x`.",

- when running [`Gao`/`Key`/`Berlekamp`] decoder with a GRS code of dimension k = n (a "full code" with distance 1, ok that's a weird code...): the decoder is built, but when trying to `decode_to_message` a word `y`, it begins by checking if `y` is a codeword by compute its syndrome, which is done by using the parity check matrix, which doesn't exist due to dimension issues. Thus the following error is raised: `ValueError: The dimension must be a positive integer at most the length of the code.` I suggest two solutions (but the second one seems to be the best one, see remark below):
  - we prevent the construction of a decoder for such a code (in a way, it has no sense to decode that code)
  - the decoder returns the input word

- when running [`Gao`/`Key`/`Berlekamp`] decoder with a GRS code of dimension k=n-1 (distance 2) on a noisy word with 1 error, some weird things happen (for the moment, I don't have any solution for these issues):
  - for `KeyEquationDecoder`, it tries to decode and fails almost every time (I would say with proba (q-1)/q, as if it was random).
  - for `GaoDecoder`, `decode_to_code` raises `ValueError: The polynomial to encode must have degree at most k-1 when trying to re-encode the message`. It means `decode_to_message` outputs a polynomial with too high degree (k).
  - for `BerlekampDecoder`, that's a random mix of the two previous behaviour (sooo weird...).

In fact, the previous issues are more important that I thought. For example, see the following script:

```
C = codes.GeneralizedReedSolomonCode(GF(16,'a').list()[1:], 12)
D = C.decoder('ErrorErasure')
Chan = channels.ErrorErasureChannel(C.ambient_space(), 0, 3)
c = C.random_element()
y,era = Chan(c)
mp = D.decode_to_message(tuple([y, era]))
```
The [15,12,4]-GRS code is clearly not a trivial code, but I still get the strange error from the "full code", because in the `ErasureError` decoding algorithm, we puncture the code on erasures, and call the error decoding algorithm on the punctured code (which is the full code).

*** Another remark ***
If you set Gao decoder as the default decoder for GRS, you should also set `EvaluationPolynomial` as the default encoder, otherwise we do not have `decode_to_message(encode(x)) = x`.

Yum, border cases! I'll investigate this.

Regarding your
> ***Another remark***

your example actually works. See as follows:

```
sage: C = codes.GeneralizedReedSolomonCode(GF(59).list()[:40], 12)
sage: c = C.random_element()
sage: Chan = channels.StaticErrorRateChannel(C.ambient_space(), C.decoder().decoding_radius())
sage: y = Chan(c)
sage: c == C.encode(C.decode_to_message(y))
True
```

What might be bothering you is:

```
sage: C.decoder().connected_encoder() == C.encoder()
False
```

But actually, `AbstractLinearCode.decode_to_message` has been written such that it *always* returns the element of the message space as a vector, because it seems the more natural way of seeing messages. This generic `decode_to_message` is more designed for beginners/people who don't want to bother with all the underlying structure, thus we defaulted the the most intuitive representation.

And that's one of the reasons for which we ask `default_encoder` to be always set to an encoder whose `message_space` is a vector space.

Hello,

So I fixed the bug related to full codes.

I added a specific test in every decoder's decoding method to check if `C.length() == C.dimension()`.
If that's the case, the input word is returned as is/unencoded as is (depending if it's `decode_to_code` or `decode_to_message`).
I also added a note in these methods to document this behaviour.

As `C.decode_to_message()` was also failing in the full code case, I overrode it.

Finally, I renamed `shorten_word` to `punctured_word` in `GRSErrorErasureDecoder`, and store `C.length()` and `C.dimension()` in variables when they were called multiple times (as it was the case in Berlekamp-Welch.

Hi David,

I found a weird thing in your functions `_partial_xgcd()` :
- in Key equation decoder, you define a `stop` variable, but never use it; your halting condition is related to the polynomial `t`, contrary to what you say in your documentation.
- in Gao decoder, you use a variable `stop` which (I think, though Gao paper is not so clear about it) isn't well-defined. You write: `stop = floor(self.code().dimension() + self.code().length()) / 2`; I think that's `stop = (self.code().dimension() + self.code().length()) // 2` instead (note the integer division).

Apparently, it could solve the previous "too-high degree re-encoding" issue.




You also told me to point out when you used numbers instead of field elements. Here is a small list (I don't know if all of them belong to your code):
- l. 197: `0 in ...` --> `F.zero()`
- l. 317: maybe the 1/... 
- l. 1702: `e.append(0)` --> `e.append(C.base_ring().zero())`. Maybe also the previous 1 and 0 in lines 1698 and 1699.


Otherwise, the code is pretty good. I've nothing to add.

Julien

Hello,

I changed what you asked, except the integer division in Gao decoder. I re-read Gao's paper and it's indeed unclear.
So I tried the empirical method, and ran some tests.
In the case `/` this snippet:

```
sage: C = codes.GeneralizedReedSolomonCode(GF(59).list()[:40], 39)
sage: D = C.decoder("Gao")
sage: Chan = channels.StaticErrorRateChannel(C.ambient_space(), 1)
sage: for i in range(100):
....:    c = C.random_element()
....:    y = Chan(c)
....:    assert c == D.decode_to_code(y)
```

indeed returns the "too-high degree" weird error...


But in the case `//`, the same snippet returns an `AssertionError`!
I'm really stuck here. If anyone has an idea, I'll be glad to hear it.

David

I was actually checking something completely different, but then I noticed that the key equation syndrome decoder has absolutely no sanity checks! If too many errors occurred, or you just gave it a random input, then it will always return something, and often not a codeword!

In the same vain, are you sure that the output of the other decoders will always be codewords? I don't think the divisibility test is sufficient.

Two completely different things I just noticed:

* I think the line `R(S.list_from_positions(xrange(0, l0+1)))` can, and should, be written `R(S[:l0+1])`.

* In Berlekamp-Welch, and in Gao, you do a divisibility test followed by the actual division, i.e. you divide twice. You should instead use the `quo_rem` function to do the division once, and do the divisibility test by seeing if the remainder is zero.

Ok, I found something very annoying while working on writing an actual check on the output of decoding algortihms:

```
sage: C = codes.GeneralizedReedSolomonCode(GF(59).list()[1:40+1], 12)
sage: c1 = C.random_element()
sage: c2 = C[1]
sage: c1.parent() == c2.parent()
False
```

So if the input of `decode_to_code`, say `r` is generated through `random_elements`, all code like t his:

```
(r - decoded_word).hamming_weight() > self.decoding_radius():
    raise DecodingError("Decoding failed because the number of errors exceeded the decoding radius")
```

systematically fails because one cannot properly subtract two vectors whose parents are diffrent.

So I'll fix `random_element` method...

That's like pissing your pants to keep warm: it doesn't fix the problem in the gazillion other ways this could explode (such as using a `StaticErrorRateChannel`).

Try harder, seriously... You need to call `list` on `S[:l0+1]` as well because the `R(...)` call is picky about getting a list and not a vector. I just did it, but it turns out it's slower than `list_from_positions`, so I guess you should just keep that though it looks horrendous.

I totally take that back! I just looked through `LinearCode` and it seems there is no other way that we could end up with a codeword whose parent is the subvector-space. So the problem really *was* with `random_element`. Which means your fix is a *good* way to solve the problem :-) Sorry about the flame.

Let's discuss another time whether there is a more efficient way to do it, and whether this bizarre passing through of `*args` and `**kwargs` to random shouldn't be deprecated (can you please note this down somewhere so we don't forget though?).

Hello,

Nah, it's librae which has gone and done it again, see [here](http://patchbot.sagemath.org/log/19653/Ubuntu/14.04/x86_64/3.13.0-76-generic/librae/2016-02-26%2014:15:08?short), it's a completely unrelated test, which fails only on librae, not on the other bots.

> I let you put the ticket in positive review

Please do, I don't want to take that from you (plural) ;)
