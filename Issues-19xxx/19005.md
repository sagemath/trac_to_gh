The polynomials in Sage lack many series operation (see #18356 for some motivation). We implement a generic `cpdef Polynomial inverse_series(self, long prec)` method and specialized ones for polynomials using flint backends.

Thanks!\n\n1. A power series just wraps a polynomial. So it would be better to have specialized algorithms for polynomials and wrap them at the power series level. Would you prefer one power series element per polynomial class? As soon as this is reviewed, I will change the power series implementation to use this method and it will be much faster. I can do that here if you prefer.\n\n2. Power series are much slower and involving them in a polynomial algorithm implies a creation of parent (which is damn slow). Moreover you only care about the polynomial at the end. You can have a look at #18356 for motivation from this side.\n\nVincent",

The docstring of `inverse_series` claims that it works over any ring, but after patching `matrix0.pyx` to make `is_unit` synonymous with `is_invertible`, I get:

```
sage: R.<x> = MatrixSpace(QQ, 2)[]
sage: pol = R.random_element()
sage: list(pol)
[
[   2    0]  [2 1]  [-1  0]
[-1/2 -1/2], [0 2], [ 2 -2]
]
sage: inv = pol.inverse_series(5)
sage: (inv*pol).truncate(5).degree()
4
sage: (pol*inv).truncate(5).degree()
4
```
Did you intend it to work over non-commutative rings?

Though I am not definitive on this, I find it weird to have the two distinct methods `inverse_mod` and `inverse_series` with `p.inverse_series(10) == p.inverse_mod(x^10)`. Wouldn't it be possible to make your code a special case of `inverse_mod`, or to make it a hidden function (`_inverse_series`) which is called as a special case of `inverse_mod`? Actually, these are two distinct changes I propose, with two distinct reasons:

1. It would be make `inverse_mod` faster for monomials:

     ```python
     sage: %timeit p.inverse_series(10)
     The slowest run took 24.39 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
     100000 loops, best of 3: 1.96 µs per loop
     sage: %timeit p.inverse_mod(x^10)
     The slowest run took 6.16 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
     10000 loops, best of 3: 26.2 µs per loop
    ```

   2. The name `inverse_series` make me think that the result will be a series, so if I want a truncated series (that is a polynomial), I am more naturally inclined to try the `inverse_mod` method. And I suspect other users may have the same behavior.

What about `truncated_inverse_series` or `inverse_series_trunc`? (there is already a `_mul_trunc_`).

Ore perhaps `inverse_mod_xk`? I thought about suggesting a different name when I wrote my comments above, but I didn't find anything that I really liked better than `inverse_series`...

Well, a `SEEALSO` looks like a good solution to me also.

My preferred choice goes to `inverse_series_trunc` (or `inverse_series_truncated` if you do not find it too long) since it will easily be found using tabulation and describes well the behavior.

* The generic version fails when the truncation order is negative (inconsistency with the others versions) or zero (which is a problem by itself):

```
sage: (1 + polygen(GF(2))).inverse_series_trunc(0)
...
ValueError: N (=0) must be a positive integer

sage: (1 + polygen(ZZ)).inverse_series_trunc(-1)
0
```
* I believe the doctest in `rings.py` that you fixed was meant to test the code path resulting in a `NotImplementedError`.
* You may want to change `two*current` to `current + current` in the generic implementation? (Not sure if this is a good idea, but it could be much faster for some rings.)
* Why the blank line in `matrix0.py`?
* “The method works *over* any polynomial ring”?

Otherwise looks good to me.
