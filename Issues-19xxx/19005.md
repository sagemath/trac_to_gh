The polynomials in Sage lack many series operation (see #18356 for some motivation). We implement a generic `cpdef Polynomial inverse_series(self, long prec)` method and specialized ones for polynomials using flint backends.

The docstring of `inverse_series` claims that it works over any ring, but after patching `matrix0.pyx` to make `is_unit` synonymous with `is_invertible`, I get:

```
sage: R.<x> = MatrixSpace(QQ, 2)[]
sage: pol = R.random_element()
sage: list(pol)
[
[   2    0]  [2 1]  [-1  0]
[-1/2 -1/2], [0 2], [ 2 -2]
]
sage: inv = pol.inverse_series(5)
sage: (inv*pol).truncate(5).degree()
4
sage: (pol*inv).truncate(5).degree()
4
```
Did you intend it to work over non-commutative rings?

Though I am not definitive on this, I find it weird to have the two distinct methods `inverse_mod` and `inverse_series` with `p.inverse_series(10) == p.inverse_mod(x^10)`. Wouldn't it be possible to make your code a special case of `inverse_mod`, or to make it a hidden function (`_inverse_series`) which is called as a special case of `inverse_mod`? Actually, these are two distinct changes I propose, with two distinct reasons:

1. It would be make `inverse_mod` faster for monomials:

     ```python
     sage: %timeit p.inverse_series(10)
     The slowest run took 24.39 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
     100000 loops, best of 3: 1.96 µs per loop
     sage: %timeit p.inverse_mod(x^10)
     The slowest run took 6.16 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
     10000 loops, best of 3: 26.2 µs per loop
    ```

   2. The name `inverse_series` make me think that the result will be a series, so if I want a truncated series (that is a polynomial), I am more naturally inclined to try the `inverse_mod` method. And I suspect other users may have the same behavior.

What about `truncated_inverse_series` or `inverse_series_trunc`? (there is already a `_mul_trunc_`).

Ore perhaps `inverse_mod_xk`? I thought about suggesting a different name when I wrote my comments above, but I didn't find anything that I really liked better than `inverse_series`...

Well, a `SEEALSO` looks like a good solution to me also.

My preferred choice goes to `inverse_series_trunc` (or `inverse_series_truncated` if you do not find it too long) since it will easily be found using tabulation and describes well the behavior.

* The generic version fails when the truncation order is negative (inconsistency with the others versions) or zero (which is a problem by itself):

```
sage: (1 + polygen(GF(2))).inverse_series_trunc(0)
...
ValueError: N (=0) must be a positive integer

sage: (1 + polygen(ZZ)).inverse_series_trunc(-1)
0
```
* I believe the doctest in `rings.py` that you fixed was meant to test the code path resulting in a `NotImplementedError`.
* You may want to change `two*current` to `current + current` in the generic implementation? (Not sure if this is a good idea, but it could be much faster for some rings.)
* Why the blank line in `matrix0.py`?
* “The method works *over* any polynomial ring”?

Otherwise looks good to me.
