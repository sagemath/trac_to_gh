Currently, when a timelimit is pass to a MIP solver, we can access the best integer solution found. However, we cannot access the best known bound value and the optimality gap. This patch enable access to these values (implemented for GLPK and CPLEX).

However, it's working only with cplex. For GLPK, I have to understand how to access

```
int glp_ios_best_node(glp_tree *tree);
/* find active subproblem with best local bound */

double glp_ios_mip_gap(glp_tree *tree);
/* compute relative MIP gap */
```

Also, I have enabled access to these methods only through the backends. I don't know if I should also add these methods to `mip.pxd/pyx`.

If you figure out how to make it work for GPLK, then I'd say yes. I expect that we will find such a feature in all solvers, eventually.

<a id='comment:7'></a>Hellooooooo David !

At `u/ncohen/19090`, you will find a commit that lets you compute the relatve mip gap in GLPK. From there, more information cab easily be gathered, read and returned.

Even though it seems that this information is gathered at every node, and not only once at the end of the exploring. The good news is that:
- It is probably cheap.
- We will see the callback function if we run a profiler, as it cannot be inlined.

{
    "body": "<a id='comment:10'></a>Helloooooo David,\n\nI find that the name of `get_best_objective_value` clashes heavily with what the method is supposed to do. When I read `get_best_objective_value`, all I can think of is that it returns the cost of the best solution found so far.\n\nWhat would you think of something like `best_known_objective_bound` instead ?\n\nSimilarly, the description of the function is sometimes confusing. I am not sure that I understand what \"the minimum objective function of all unexplored nodes\" means.\n\nWhat about something like that:\n\n---\nThis method returns the current best upper (resp. lower) bound on the optimal value of the objective function in a maximization (resp. minimization) problem.

<a id='comment:10'></a>Helloooooo David,

I find that the name of `get_best_objective_value` clashes heavily with what the method is supposed to do. When I read `get_best_objective_value`, all I can think of is that it returns the cost of the best solution found so far.

What would you think of something like `best_known_objective_bound` instead ?

Similarly, the description of the function is sometimes confusing. I am not sure that I understand what "the minimum objective function of all unexplored nodes" means.

What about something like that:

---
This method returns the current best upper (resp. lower) bound on the optimal value of the objective function in a maximization (resp. minimization) problem. It is equal to the output of :meth:`get_objective_value` if the MILP found an optimal solution, but it can differ if it was interrupted manually or after a time limit (cf :meth:`solver_parameter`).

Just a proposition of course, we can modify whatever you don't like in this text.
