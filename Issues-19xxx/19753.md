This is a container ticket for minor documentation typos found in version 6.10, to be fixed for 7.0. I'll add them here, if I am not doing another ticket for same part of Sage. Of course others can also make additions to this.

- "abelian" vs. "Abelian" and maybe still other name-based terms that should start with capital in English. (Moved to #19942)

- Should `is_parent_of` be in the index of functions in `posets.py`? It is an alias on `__contains__` and shown in the manual page.

X On finite lattices `complements()` and `is_[lower|upper]_semimodular()` uses "poset" when there should be "lattice".

- Set partitions, `sup` and wrong seealso-link.

- After #13250 change `SetPartitions` to an example in `is_geometric()`.

X src/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_generic.py:        Reduces a point R on an **ellipitc** curve to the corresponding point on

X src/sage/graphs/generators/families.py:    Graph `K(n,2)`.  In **paritcular** the complement of `J(5,2)` is isomorphic to

X `ordered_tree.py`, indentation in first input block.

X `linear_extensions_graph` missing from index of functions in finite posets.

Thanks.

At #13250 can you add a little modification: in `lattices.py` function `is_geometric()` remove

```
sage: S = SetPartitions(3)
sage: L = LatticePoset( (S, lambda a, b: S.is_less_than(a, b)) )
```

and instead put

```
sage: L = Posets.SetPartitions(4)
```

?
