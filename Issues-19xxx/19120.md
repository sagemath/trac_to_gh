Implement a method which, taking continued fraction x as an input, computes the continued fraction of (a*x+b)/(c*x+d) using Gosper's algorithm. Call this method with proper arguments upon

```
sage: 3*x
sage: x+1
```

(overlaps with the following TODO item of sage/rings/continued_fraction.py:
Add Gosper’s algorithm to compute the continued fraction of (ax + b)/(cx + d) knowing the one of x (see Gosper (1972, http://www.inwap.com/pdp10/hbaker/hakmem/cf.html), Knuth (1998, TAOCP vol 2, Exercise 4.5.3.15), Fowler (1999).

<a id='comment:4'></a>Hello,

Some remarks:

1. You would better edit the description of this ticket to explain what you want to do.

2. Your branch does not merge cleanly with the last beta. The reason is that you added a line in `lazy_list.pyx`: `from sage.rings.all import Infinity`. It is always better to base your work on the latest available version of the source code. You can consult the [developer manual](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/manual_git.html).

3. The commit message should reflect what is inside the commit. Not your mood at the time you did the commit.

4. The file with gosper algorithm should not be in `sage/misc/`. Put it in the same directory as `continued_fraction.py`. And you would better call it `continued_fraction_gosper.py`.

5. In `continued_fraction.py` you added the following in the comparison code

```diff
@@ -530,6 +530,8 @@ class ContinuedFraction_base(SageObject):
             if a == ZZ_0 and b == ZZ_0 and i:  # rational case

             i += 1
+            if i == 300:

```
  I understand why you did it but it is definitely not a solution. What you can do is to raise a `RuntimeError` after a certain limit.

6. All methods must be documented as explained in details in the [developer manual](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#documentation-strings).

<a id='comment:6'></a>Hi,

thanks for the great input. 

As for 5.: We need a way to compare instances of _infinite, and even though this is not a valid test, if enough terms are the same, the two continued fractions could be regarded as equal for most practical purposes. Another option would be to compare values, as in _real, but the problem is that

1. value() method is by documentation optional,

2. in case of _infinite, this would delegate the computation of value to RLF, which itself may use comparison,

3. this solution would effectively do the same thing - compute the value of the operands with certain precision and then compare the intervals.

What do you think?

Everything would be better than an silent approximate comparison. If equality can not be decided just raise an error (see [Python exceptions](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/errors.html)). I think that in that case an `ArithmeticError` would make sense.

If you want to check equality up to some precision, you should do

```
sage: abs(cf1 - cf2) < 2**-100
```
or

```
sage: R = RealIntervalField(256)
sage: R(cf1).overlaps(R(cf2))
```
