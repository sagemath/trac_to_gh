Implement a method which, taking continued fraction x as an input, computes the continued fraction of (a*x+b)/(c*x+d) using Gosper's algorithm. Call this method with proper arguments upon

```
sage: 3*x
sage: x+1
```

(overlaps with the following TODO item of sage/rings/continued_fraction.py:
Add Gosper’s algorithm to compute the continued fraction of (ax + b)/(cx + d) knowing the one of x (see Gosper (1972, http://www.inwap.com/pdp10/hbaker/hakmem/cf.html), Knuth (1998, TAOCP vol 2, Exercise 4.5.3.15), Fowler (1999).

4. The file with gosper algorithm should not be in `sage/misc/`. Put it in the same directory as `continued_fraction.py`. And you would better call it `continued_fraction_gosper.py`.

5. In `continued_fraction.py` you added the following in the comparison code

<a id='comment:6'></a>Hi,

thanks for the great input. 

As for 5.: We need a way to compare instances of _infinite, and even though this is not a valid test, if enough terms are the same, the two continued fractions could be regarded as equal for most practical purposes. Another option would be to compare values, as in _real, but the problem is that

1. value() method is by documentation optional,

2. in case of _infinite, this would delegate the computation of value to RLF, which itself may use comparison,

3. this solution would effectively do the same thing - compute the value of the operands with certain precision and then compare the intervals.

What do you think?

Everything would be better than an silent approximate comparison. If equality can not be decided just raise an error (see [Python exceptions](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/errors.html)). I think that in that case an `ArithmeticError` would make sense.

If you want to check equality up to some precision, you should do

```
sage: abs(cf1 - cf2) < 2**-100
```
or

```
sage: R = RealIntervalField(256)
sage: R(cf1).overlaps(R(cf2))
```
