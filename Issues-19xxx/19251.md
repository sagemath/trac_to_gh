Also, a matrix is not a basis. Matrices have row and column spans, its not clear which one you mean if you just return a matrix. This is how it is supposed to work:

```
sage: (QQ^3).span([(1,2,3)]).basis()
[
(1, 2, 3)
]
sage: _.universe()
Vector space of degree 3 and dimension 1 over Rational Field
Basis matrix:
