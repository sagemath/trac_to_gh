`generic_graph.py` contains several functions where documentation says that there are several algorithms available. However there is no explanation of their difference. Is some faster, other uses less memory? Better for sparse/dense graphs?

As an example `flow()` has three algorithm and no clear explanation when to choose `FF` or `LP`.

A possible explanation is that we have absolutely no idea of which is best in which situations, and so merely inform the users that (s)he should try them on his/her instances to find out.

Let's start from `wiener_index()`. I have no idea about what it does.

What is the difference between 'Floyd-Warshall-Cython' and 'BFS'? By default "Sage chooses the best algorithm: 'BFS' for unweighted graphs" -- so when should 'Floyd-Warshall-Cython' be used?

OK, I did a suggestion of documenting this. Now the last question for this: Is it really so that for one algorithm "no negative weight is allowed" and another "works only with positive weights", i.e. they have difference with zeros?

And then to `triangles_count()`... This will take some time.
