arb does not build on cygwin, failing at configure step:

```
Configuring...x86_64-CYGWIN64
Building both static and shared versions of MPIR/GMP on CYGWIN64 is currently
unsupported, and so is it for MPFR, FLINT and ARB.
You should pass --disable-shared or --disable-static to configure
depending on the versions of MPIR/GMP, MPFR and FLINT you built.
```

FLINT, for instance, is configured with --disable-static.
