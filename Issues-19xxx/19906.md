in Sage 6.10:

```
sage: dilog(-1.0)
-1/12*pi^2
sage: dilog(1)
1/6*pi^2
sage: dilog(0.5)
1/12*pi^2 - 1/2*log(2)^2
```
we should not get symbolic output with floating-point input.

Could you be more careful and actually check the parent of the output? In other words something like

```
sage: y = dilog( RealField(13)(1.0))
sage: assert parent(y) is RealField(13)
sage: y = dilog( RealField(100)(1.0))
sage: assert parent(y) is RealField(100)

I don't know to which extent this function is available on intervals, balls and complexes but they should be tested as well with various precision.

(The case of intervals, balls and complexes can be dealt with in a different ticket.)\n\nNo, actually the given doctest fails (that's why I didn't set needs review). But the notion that `dilog(RealField(13)(1.0))` should return anything real I commented on in [#18386 comment:8](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/18386#comment:8). More obviously, demanding that `dilog(RealField(13)(1.1))` should have `RealField(13)` as parent is a red herring because the result just is complex.\n\nHowever, there are still issues with `polylog` (and thus `dilog`) , I just reopened https://github.com/pynac/pynac/issues/219 to fix them. I believe #18386 is more fitting to be the ticket to add a doctest once it's fixed so I propose to make this a duplicate. As you seem to be of similar attitude I take the liberty to set positive all at once.",

No, actually the given doctest fails (that's why I didn't set needs review). But the notion that `dilog(RealField(13)(1.0))` should return anything real I commented on in [#18386 comment:8](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/18386#comment:8). More obviously, demanding that `dilog(RealField(13)(1.1))` should have `RealField(13)` as parent is a red herring because the result just is complex.

However, there are still issues with `polylog` (and thus `dilog`) , I just reopened https://github.com/pynac/pynac/issues/219 to fix them. I believe #18386 is more fitting to be the ticket to add a doctest once it's fixed so I propose to make this a duplicate. As you seem to be of similar attitude I take the liberty to set positive all at once.

<div id="comment:12" align="right">comment:12</div>

since the initial issue in the description of this ticket is now fixed (here with Sage 7.6):

```
sage: dilog(-1.0)
-0.822467033424113
sage: dilog(0.5)
0.582240526465012
```
I would simply add those two tests in the doctests, maybe with one test checking the parent:

```
sage: y = dilog(RealField(13)(0.5))
sage: parent(y)
Real Field with 13 bits of precision
```
and indeed defer to #18386 the other issues (branch point, complex values).
