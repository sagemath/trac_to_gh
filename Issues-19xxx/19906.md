Could you be more careful and actually check the parent of the output? In other words something like

```
sage: y = dilog( RealField(13)(1.0))
sage: assert parent(y) is RealField(13)
sage: y = dilog( RealField(100)(1.0))
sage: assert parent(y) is RealField(100)
```
I don't know to which extent this function is available on intervals, balls and complexes but they should be tested as well with various precision.

No, actually the given doctest fails (that's why I didn't set needs review). But the notion that `dilog(RealField(13)(1.0))` should return anything real I commented on in [#18386 comment:8](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/18386#comment:8).

since the initial issue in the description of this ticket is now fixed (here with Sage 7.6):

```
sage: dilog(-1.0)
-0.822467033424113
sage: dilog(0.5)
0.582240526465012
```
I would simply add those two tests in the doctests, maybe with one test checking the parent:

```
sage: y = dilog(RealField(13)(0.5))
sage: parent(y)
Real Field with 13 bits of precision
```
and indeed defer to #18386 the other issues (branch point, complex values).
