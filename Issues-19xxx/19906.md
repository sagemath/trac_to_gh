in Sage 6.10:

```
sage: dilog(-1.0)
-1/12*pi^2
sage: dilog(1)
1/6*pi^2
sage: dilog(0.5)
1/12*pi^2 - 1/2*log(2)^2
```
we should not get symbolic output with floating-point input.

sage: y = dilog( RealField(100)(1.0))

(The case of intervals, balls and complexes can be dealt with in a different ticket.)\n\nNo, actually the given doctest fails (that's why I didn't set needs review). But the notion that `dilog(RealField(13)(1.0))` should return anything real I commented on in [#18386 comment:8](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/18386#comment:8). More obviously, demanding that `dilog(RealField(13)(1.1))` should have `RealField(13)` as parent is a red herring because the result just is complex.\n\nHowever, there are still issues with `polylog` (and thus `dilog`) , I just reopened https://github.com/pynac/pynac/issues/219 to fix them. I believe #18386 is more fitting to be the ticket to add a doctest once it's fixed so I propose to make this a duplicate. As you seem to be of similar attitude I take the liberty to set positive all at once.",

No, actually the given doctest fails (that's why I didn't set needs review). But the notion that `dilog(RealField(13)(1.0))` should return anything real I commented on in [#18386 comment:8](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/18386#comment:8). More obviously, demanding that `dilog(RealField(13)(1.1))` should have `RealField(13)` as parent is a red herring because the result just is complex.

However, there are still issues with `polylog` (and thus `dilog`) , I just reopened https://github.com/pynac/pynac/issues/219 to fix them. I believe #18386 is more fitting to be the ticket to add a doctest once it's fixed so I propose to make this a duplicate. As you seem to be of similar attitude I take the liberty to set positive all at once.

<div id="comment:12" align="right">Comment 12</div>

since the initial issue in the description of this ticket is now fixed (here with Sage 7.6):

```
sage: dilog(-1.0)
-0.822467033424113
sage: dilog(0.5)
0.582240526465012
```
I would simply add those two tests in the doctests, maybe with one test checking the parent:

```
sage: y = dilog(RealField(13)(0.5))
sage: parent(y)
Real Field with 13 bits of precision
```
and indeed defer to #18386 the other issues (branch point, complex values).
