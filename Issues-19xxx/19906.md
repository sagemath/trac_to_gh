<a id='comment:12'></a>since the initial issue in the description of this ticket is now fixed (here with Sage 7.6):

```
sage: dilog(-1.0)
-0.822467033424113
sage: dilog(0.5)
0.582240526465012
```
I would simply add those two tests in the doctests, maybe with one test checking the parent:

```
sage: y = dilog(RealField(13)(0.5))
sage: parent(y)
Real Field with 13 bits of precision
```
and indeed defer to #18386 the other issues (branch point, complex values).
