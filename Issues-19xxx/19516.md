Add a function that adds a bottom and a top element to a poset.

But what about others? Should the new top element be string 'top', for example? What if the poset already contains it? Or make a pairs, so that `'a'` in the original poset would be `('a', 0)` in the new poset?

<a id='comment:3'></a>Nathann, any opinions? The code works, but

1) What should be the name of the function? This does not modify the poset, so "add"-something seems wrong.

2) What about default value of top and bottom elements?

<a id='comment:6'></a>Better yet: `with_bounds`.

It could be good to have `with_bounds(min_element='bottom', max_element='top')`. But to be consistent with other functions there should be way to think posets as abstract structures, i.e. something like `labels='integers'`. Is it too complicated to have three parameter? Maybe not.

I'll make some code according to this.
