Add a function that adds a bottom and a top element to a poset.

(I.e. return a new poset with bounds added, as posets are immutable.)

Kevin: I am mostly interested in abstract posets, so it is fine to just relabel the result to integers.

But what about others? Should the new top element be string 'top', for example? What if the poset already contains it? Or make a pairs, so that `'a'` in the original poset would be `('a', 0)` in the new poset?

Nathann, any opinions? The code works, but

1) What should be the name of the function? This does not modify the poset, so "add"-something seems wrong.

2) What about default value of top and bottom elements?

Hello,

1) What about `add_top_and_bottom(inplace=False)` which does both inplace and a copy?

2) `add_top_and_bottom(min_element,max_element,inplace=False)`?

Better yet: `with_bounds`.

It could be good to have `with_bounds(min_element='bottom', max_element='top')`. But to be consistent with other functions there should be way to think posets as abstract structures, i.e. something like `labels='integers'`. Is it too complicated to have three parameter? Maybe not.

I'll make some code according to this.
