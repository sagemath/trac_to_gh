A mistake at the certificate authority used by Jmol has revoked the old security certificate for Jmol.  This means that the java versions older than 14.4.0_2015.10.14 will not work in any browsers.Â  Since we default to the javascript version, this is not a disaster but may cause problems for those using complicated 3D.

Also, a tiny PHP script was for some reason deleted - let's not do it.

 A mistake at the certificate authority used by Jmol has revoked the old security certificate for Jmol.

Thank you for reviewing!

I've seen #20978, but I don't really care about Java version for a few years - even when it works it is annoying to keep pressing confirmations and then of course there is no way to save it on campus computers. My main motivation for this upgrade having the PHP script included.
