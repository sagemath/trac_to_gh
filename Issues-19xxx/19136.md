They are like the main race of the graphs that we still can't build.

most of it should be trivial modifications of polar graph functions.
I think I also should do refactoring of `graphs/generators/families` here...

there still `skewhad*` and `Pasechnik`, which need some skew-Hadamard matrices...
These still need few not  too trivial constructions by Williams to be implemented.

Yepyep, create the new module and update the names.

I'm eager to have a `graphs.PasechnikGraph` `;-)`

As you do not even include the number of the tickets in the commit, you can't even tell what belongs to this ticket and what belongs to another.

The closest approximation of this is the 1st commit on the ticket, 	22114b7a6ada54c4c66a9b5705a2c2233046a61f

The bottom part of graphs/generators/families.py was chopped off and saved into the initial
graphs/generators/classical_geometries.py
And stuff happened to SymplecticGraph (it got renamed and deprecated).

Unfortunately I did not record this as two separate commits, and I don't see how I could change this now without much effort...

<a id='comment:23'></a>Hello Dima,

Here is a first-pass review.

- `graphs.SymplecticGraph` does not exist. It is not enough to create a
  deprecation alias, it must also be available in `graphs.<tab>`.

- In `NonisotropicOrthogonalPolarGraph`. Replace
  {{{
  else:
      if not perp is None:
         <code>
      else:
  }}}
  with
  {{{
  elif not perp is None:
         <code>
  else:
  }}}
  No need to indent everything twice.

- same function: `q` does not appear in the INPUT block

- same function: move the checks on q (prime power) and sign (+-) to the
  beginning of the function (not in a 'if' block). This function builds a
  (dense) graph, we are not at a level where we try to minimize the amount of
  unnecessary 'if'.

- REFERENCE block happens at the end of the docstring

- Remove the commented code that your functions contain

- Why 5 `is_NO*` functions instead of one `is_NO` ? I remember a comment of
  yours about copy/paste...

- If your function is slow it is because of that line
  {{{
  G = Graph([V,lambda x,y:P(vector(x),vector(y))==0],loops=False)
  }}}
  When you do this, 'vector' is called 'binomial(n,2)' times, and `vector` is
  *SLOW*. In a previous branch of yours, I added a commit to remove this in
  order to gain a large speedup (do you remember)? Try to find a way to avoid
  vectors. If you cannot, then instead of building `n^2` vectors you should turn
  everything into a vector *once*, and work on vectors instead. Observe that
  vectors have a `.set_immutable` method.

  Then, perhaps we will be able to remove those `# long time` everywhere in
  `_orthogonal_polar_graph` (and elsewhere).

- Same in `UnitaryPolarGraph`.

Next time, please think of the reviewer when you built your commits. When you
save minutes by not doing it, the reviewer loses hours trying to figure out what
exactly you did.

Thanks for the addition, however. I couldn't have done that.

Nathann

P.S.: Fill the 'authors' field. Think of doing it when you set your tickets to `needs_review`.

Splitting a file into two isn't really specially supported by git, no?
That is, in the new file one can potentially put anything..

%%% while I was writing this I saw your review, thanks! anyhow I'll leave it here just in case.

You can do the following: check out 22114b7a6ada54c4c66a9b5705a2c2233046a61f, 
take graphs/generators/classical_geometries.py and remove the top part before the first def.
Now join the result to the bottom of graphs/generators/families.py

Now you can look at the diff of the resulting graphs/generators/families.py and 
graphs/generators/families.py from the appropriate beta.
You will see all what happened at 22114b7a6ada54c4c66a9b5705a2c2233046a61f this way.

After that you can review the diff of the ticket branch against 22114b7a6ada54c4c66a9b5705a2c2233046a61f.

No indeed, but you can make it easier for the reviewer this way:

1) Make a first commit that just *moves* code from one file to another. It is very easy to check something like that: I only have to make the same move in the other direction, and check that the two commits add up to no modification at all.

2) After this first commit the code may not compile (because of broken import and stuff). You can then change code wherever you like to adapt to it.

3) Do whatever else you need to do in this branch.

This way, after checking the first commit, I can review the diff of all commits except the first.

> You can do the following:


Thanks. I'll try it.

it's because the arithmetic properties of parameters are quite different in each of these

OK, I did the latter. Totally getting rid of `vector()` in these cases seems tricky.

So the test is different in each case, but the tests for prime powers, the ordering or `s,r`, the eigenvalues.. All this is common (not to mention a big part of the doc). Why not one function, with several 'if' for each case?

no, read the code: in some cases eigenvalues aren't even computed; if they are used then they are used differently in different functions, etc. Also note that there is a lot in common between all of the following:

```
is_affine_polar,is_orthogonal_polar,is_NOodd, is_NOperp_F5,
is_NO_F2, is_NO_F3, is_NU,
is_unitary_polar,is_unitary_dual_polar
```

And most of these test for more than one series of graphs, if you count all these '+', '-', etc.

> All this is common (not to mention a big part of the doc). Why not one function, with several 'if' for each case?


because several ifs suck and make code unreadable and harder to debug, and hard to document and test. Imagine e.g. how hard it would be to figure out what doctest tests what.

Perhaps I'll do this some time later, if you don't mind.

OK, so we still have big classes to cover: 

* GQs (of order (q-1,q+1) and (q+1,q-1), the others are there already).
* skew-Hadamard and relatives (I promised to work on this already...)
* Goethals-Seidel (8.C in [BvL84]; seems to be easy to do)
* Mathon: symmetric conference matrices (8.B in [BvL84])

I easily can do GQs, too, unless you already are on them...

Indeed. No need to think of that before computing the eigenvalues becomes a critical cost.

Err.. To be honest I don't know exactly which ones I could work on. If you tell me that you know how to deal with these classes then I can print the list of those that remain and see those that I can settle, as that would give me a starting point.
