Isn't that #19311?

isn't #19311 about something different -- two-intersection code(s)?

I recall having a long tread, either in email, or in some google groups, or on trac, where I explained (to myself mostly) the stuff on projective codes. I can't seem to locate it. Did I just dream about it? Or  perhaps you know where to find this?

It's up to you. I read somewhere that two-intersection codes were equivalent to two-weight codes.

I do not mind much myself, as long as the graph is generated.

OK, so if we knew this transformation, then no need for a new way to build graphs would be needed, right?
