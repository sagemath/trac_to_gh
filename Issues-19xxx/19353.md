Isn't that #19311?

And you would be right to. It takes a lifetime to compile this cython module, and most of it has no reason to be cython code. Would you feel like writing this two-code module in sage.coding? It is clear that it belongs there, but given that I still do not totally understand all the meaning of all parameters in a "projective 9-ary [42,3] code with weights 36, 39", I do not feel much at ease implementing and documenting all that...

isn't #19311 about something different -- two-intersection code(s)?

I recall having a long tread, either in email, or in some google groups, or on trac, where I explained (to myself mostly) the stuff on projective codes. I can't seem to locate it. Did I just dream about it? Or  perhaps you know where to find this?

It's up to you. I read somewhere that two-intersection codes were equivalent to two-weight codes.

I do not mind much myself, as long as the graph is generated.

OK, so if we knew this transformation, then no need for a new way to build graphs would be needed, right?
