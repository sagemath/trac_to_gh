As #19930 introduces a new encoder which computes a generator matrix for codes defined from their parity check matrices, it would be nice to update `codes.LinearCodeFromCheckMatrix`.

It could be renamed, made a class, and thus use the encoder described above.

Depends on #19930

Hi David

Which encoder are you mentionning in the description of the ticket ?

Are you suggesting to use the encoder `codes.encoders.LinearCodeParityCheckEncoder` ?

This encoder is deprecated.

Daniel

Actually, the point was to use the `ParityCheckEncoder` to as a building brick
for some codes, instead of having `LinearCodeFromCheckMatrix`
But as you said, `ParityCheckEncoder` is deprecated, and #21165 deprecates `LinearCodeFromCheckMatrix`.

So, let's set this ticket to `invalid/won't fix`.
