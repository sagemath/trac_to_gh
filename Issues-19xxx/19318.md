This (small) patch allows one to compute the inverse of a unit in an `IntegerModRing`. It provides the following functionality:

```python
sage: R = IntegerModRing(10)
sage: R(7).inverse_of_unit()
3
sage: R(4).inverse_of_unit() # 4 is not a unit in ZZ/10ZZ
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ZeroDivisionError: Inverse does not exist.
```

As this `inverse_of_unit` does not implement a special algorithm to compute the inverse, it should not be a method of `IntegerModRing`. On the other hand, adding `inverse_of_unit` method to a general ring as a more intuitive alternative to `^-1` seems not a good idea. Is it really more intuitive? I would suggest `multiplicative_inverse`. Anyway, this is a separate issue.

I advise you to ask in Sage support or Sage devel first if you think you found something missing in Sage.

I will mark this ticket as "won't fix"
