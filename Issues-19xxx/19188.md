Following your suggestion, I have modified the pdf(...) function in the builder.py so that it recognizes the  'ja' language option to run “make all-pdf-ja” instead of “... all-pdf”.
It is rough and ready, but it works with “make doc-pdf” and in the context of “sage –docbuild...”.
I have made a patch file for builder.py of sage-6.9. The name is builder-ja.patch.
Please look at it.
