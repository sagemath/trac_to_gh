We implement a reasonably fast lexicographic iterator for modules over `ZZ/nZZ`. We integrate a `minimum_weight` method that could be used as an alternative to GAP in some part of `sage.codings`.

Setup

```
sage: R = IntegerModRing(6)
sage: M = FreeModule(R, 4)
sage: U = M.span([M((1,1,0,2)), M((2,2,3,0))])
```

Before

```
sage: timeit('for u in M: pass')
25 loops, best of 3: 9.11 ms per loop

sage: timeit('for u in U: pass')
625 loops, best of 3: 641 µs per loop
```

After

```
sage: timeit('for u in M: pass')
625 loops, best of 3: 283 µs per loop

sage: timeit('for u in U: pass')
625 loops, best of 3: 41.5 µs per loop
```
