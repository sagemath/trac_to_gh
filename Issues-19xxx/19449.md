What the title says, essentially. Not only is there no clear way to do this, but I don't even see a tricky way to do this. The input structure for `LatticePoset` is weird, and not in a good way.

Maybe I was just half asleep and called `LatticePoset` of the hyperplane arrangement instead of its intersection lattice. Anyway, sorry for the spam!",
