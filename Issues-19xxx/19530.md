This small patch corrects several indentation errors in graph documentation. They do no harm, but irritate me.

(An example command to found lines containing those:

```
FILE=graph.py; egrep '^ +- [^ ]' $FILE -n | cut -f 1 -d ':' | while read n; do echo -n "$n: ";
a=$(tail -n +$n $FILE | head -1 | egrep -o '^ +' | wc -c | tr '\n' ' ');
b=$(tail -n +$((n+1)) $FILE | head -1 | egrep -o '^ +' | wc -c);
echo $((b-a)); done | egrep ': 3$'

```
