- For this asymptotic expansion project we had to create a separate `asymptotic_expansion_index.rst` in `src/doc/en/reference/rings`, which seems a bit unnatural. Including it also was not easily possible. Thus having it in `sage.asymptotic` will create less unnatural constructions and seems to be more like it should be.

- Also the structure of the reference manual supports this choice: In its main index there is a section on standard rings and fields (`sage.rings`). The asymptotic expansions definitly do not belong there. The best fit (and a good one as well) is the main calculus section of the reference manual, where it now (since #19083) is. 

- #18528 will live in `sage.manifolds` as well. There are already projects directly in `sage.*`, e.g. quivers, quadratic forms, ...

- The asymptotic expansion project not only consist of the `AsymptoticRing` (public), but there are term monoids and growth groups (but both more private than the ring) as well.

All in all `sage.asymptotic` seems to be the right choice.

Why unnatural? We have a separate index in the manual about finite rings for example, but I don't think we should have `sage.finite_rings`.

So you should move to `sage.calculus.asymptotic` or `sage.symbolic.asymptotic` then...

> - #18528 will live in `sage.manifolds` as well. There are already projects directly in `sage.*`, e.g. quivers, quadratic forms, ...

Are those things rings? A manifold and a quadratic form certainly is not a ring, I don't know about quivers.

Asymptotic expansions might not form a ring in the mathematical sense, but it is sufficiently ring-like (just like the symbolic "ring") that it can remain in `sage.rings`.

> - The asymptotic expansion project not only consist of the `AsymptoticRing` (public), but there are term monoids and growth groups (but both more private than the ring) as well.

How is this relevant?

I think that asymptotic expansions fit nicely next to `polynomials` for example in `sage.rings`. I just don't want to end up with 100 subdirectories directly in `src/sage`.

Anyway, I don't want to bikeshed too much over this, I'm not going to actively prevent anybody from moving this to `sage.asymptotic`. Just don't expect me to review this ticket :-)

I added a commit related to documentation which was lost during work on #19399.

Apart from that: documentation builds and works as expected. Thus from my side, this is a positive review. I'll set this to positive review in a few days if there are no objections by anybody else.
