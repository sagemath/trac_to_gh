Why not having a default when `R` is not provided?

Isn't the octave interface completely broken

```
sage: o = octave('[1,2,3,4]')
sage: o


 1 2 3 4


sage: o[1]

sage: o[2]
sage3
parse error:

  syntax error

sage: o

sage:

oh, well, maybe. Which ring to choose ?

> Isn't the octave interface completely broken

not really completely, because it passes its tests.
But yes, I find it very fragile and it works only if you are very cautious.

In your example, o[1] is not an allowed operation.

Didn't you forgot `# optional - octave`? And what is the point of all these methods: `_equality_symbol`, `_true_symbol` and `_false_symbol`?

For the choice of the ring, you need to get it from the octave side (and raise an error if you are not able to translate it to a Sage ring saying that the ring is not optional). There are builtin functions in octave
- `isnumeric`
- `isinteger` -> Sage `ZZ`?
- `isfloat` -> Sage `RDF`?
- `isreal` -> ?
- `iscomplex` -> Sage `CDF`?
And it would be better to test first with `isvector` if the octave object is actually a vector.

The `_equality_symbol` is missing in the interface, which prevent to use the boolean from octave in sage tests. It is also recommended to have the true and false symbols in the interface.

I have made some more things, but I am not able to test that. I do not have a machine with both octave and sage git repo, even if I have both separately.
