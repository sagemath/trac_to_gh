As discussed in #19623 (see comments 17 and below), it would be nice to have, at some point, a generic mechanism to remember and carry on useful information on codes.

Indeed, while performing computations with codes, some parameters might be found, which would require some work to compute in another case.
E.g. while building a lookup table for syndrome decoding, `minimum_distance` can be computed. As computing the minimum distance is an exhaustive search over all the codewords, it would be a shame to lose this information...

This ticket focuses on implementing such an machanism.
