This ticket introduces a new, faster algorithm for the interpolation step of the Guruswami-Sudan list decoder proposed in #19666, called Lee O'Sullivan algorithm.

The code proposed here relies extensively on the code written by Johan Nielsen in [codinglib](https://bitbucket.org/jsrn/codinglib/). He wrote all the algorithms and mathematical content.

<a id='comment:13'></a>Hi, I've looked through the code and it looks good. I made a number of minor modifications directly. The most major are:

1. Rename "weight" to "shift". This is the standard nomenclature in computer algebra.
2. Remove support for fractional shifts in the helper methods of `utils.py`. This is not needed for Lee and O'Sullivan, and it simplifies those helpers a lot.

Apart from that, I just simplified a few things, renamed some things and reformulated some docs. I also elaborated some doc strings here and there, where I found that further details might be nice for the user.

I'm currently recompiling after `make distclean` and I will re-test and re-check documentation after that.
