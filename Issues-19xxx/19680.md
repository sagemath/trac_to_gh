Well, I would like to eventually change the build system to make such packages automatic dependencies if `SAGE_CHECK=yes`. Many Python packages have a test suite, but we don't run them because they require these extra packages.

Since `pip` packages bypass the usual `local/var/lib/sage/installed` system, they should not be used as dependencies of other packages.
