Can't these all be installed via pip? Why not make them pip-type packages?

Well, I would like to eventually change the build system to make such packages automatic dependencies if `SAGE_CHECK=yes`. Many Python packages have a test suite, but we don't run them because they require these extra packages.

Since `pip` packages bypass the usual `local/var/lib/sage/installed` system, they should not be used as dependencies of other packages.

A pip-type package could just update `local/var/lib/sage/installed` with the output of `pip list`

IMHO we are going to fight an uphill battle if we keep repackaging more and more of pypi for stuff that has no direct mathematical use. It just wastes our own resources that could be spent elsewhere. We should be relying more on pip, not less.

How about requiring internet access for building with SAGE_CHECK=yes? Then all those pip packages could just be installed by a script-type `check_dependencies` package that just contains

```
if SAGE_CHECK
    pip install -r check-requirements.txt
