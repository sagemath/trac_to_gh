This ticket enhances the module `sage.misc.package` and the script `sage-list-packages`:
- add independent functions in `sage.misc.package` to list the (new style) packages
- add pip functionalities to `sage.misc.package`
- do not list anymore old style packages (see also #21132)
- relies on `sage.misc.packages` in `sage-list-packages`

pip type packages were created in #19187. This ticket is such that these packages will be listed with `sage -optional`. Sadly, it will still not be possible for these packages to be used in optional doctests. The reason for that is that we do not have proper version control for them.

Do you mean

- you want them listed in `sage --experimental`, not `sage --optional`, or
- you don't want them detected for the purpose of doctests,

or both?

The default for `--optional` flags in doctests really should be optional packages only, so I don't want pip packages to be tested by doctests by default. Therefore, I also don't want those packages to appear in `sage --optional`. So I really prefer to see them as a new category: not standard, not optional, not experimental.

I see several solutions to deal with "pip packages":
1. having a new category of packages (let say python-optional)
2. be stricter about versioning, i.e. in piprules specify the version of the packages we support

```
brian=1.3.1
trac=2.3
```
  Very simple to maintain!

I agree that it would be hard to prevent a pip package to just break because versions are not backward compatible. So solution 2 looks appropriate to me. Otherwise, we can have a more precise tagging system for python-optional packages

```
sage: my_test()  # python-optional -- 3.5 <= beautifulsoup <= 4.1.2
```
It is more flexible than the piprules strict versioning solution but the cost of maintenance is much higher.

biopython (pip) ........... latest version (installed version)

chomp (experimental) ...... latest version (installed version)
...
ore_algebra (optional) .... latest version (installed version)
...
```
 I'm not really sure, though.
- Regarding the versions, I am not convinced that we can accurately specify which version of each package we support. Who is going to maintain this? Unless there is some automatic way of determining the versions supported by Sage, the versions will quickly get out of date. If `brian` gets updated to 1.4.2 but we list `brian=1.4.1`, what happens if a user does `sage -i brian`? What happens if a user does `sage --pip install brian`?
