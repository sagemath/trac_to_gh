-The checksum of the upstream tarball for GAP3 (added in #8906) does not match what Sage believes it to be (see [this sage-combinat-devel thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-combinat-devel/UWBqVjcFiKc)).
+The GAP3 package (#8906) contains binaries instead of installing from source. This is not acceptable.
 
-The new branch reverts the merge of #8906, as it would have brought binary executables from an external source into Sage.
