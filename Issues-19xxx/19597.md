```
Replace code of the form

```
x.__eq__(y)
x.__len__()
x.__getitem__(y)
x.__contains__(y)
...
```
by

```
x == y
len(x)
x[y]
y in x
...
```
because the latter are more efficient.

The obvious exceptions are `super()` calls and `Class.__method__(...)` calls.

In a few cases, we reorganize the code to avoid special functions/methods altogether:
1. for `__repr__()`, we instead change `%s` to `%r` for `%`-formatting and `{}` to `{!r}` for `.format()`.
2. certain calls to `__iter__()` can be changed to a simple list comprehension.
3. there are subtle differences between `x.__eq__(y)` and `x == y` and in certain technical cases they do matter.

`combinat/root_system/weyl_characters.py`: a very strange way to compute powers `self * self ** (n-1)`. I guess that generic power would be better here!

`groups/perm_gps/permgroup.py`: Is there any difference between `list(L)` and `[x for x in L]`? As far as I understand `list` is smarter and call for `__len__` to allocate directly the right amount of memory. Whereas the second uses `.append`.

Let me also mention that this is the only place in Sage where a comparison method `__lt__`, `__gt__`, `__le__` or `__ge__` returns `NotImplemented`.

In `src/sage/combinat/words/abstract_word.py`, there is an `__eq__` which can return `NotImplemented`, but I don't think there is a problem there: I believe calling `self == other` in `__ne__` is still the right thing to do.

And there are several other places where a `__richcmp__` can return `NotImplemented` but those are not affected by this ticket.

It's apparently intentional. The doc says that it's more efficient to compute `a*(a*(a*a))` than `(a*a)*(a*a)`. Still, I can change the code to use a loop instead of recursion.

Well, there wasn't a single non-optional doctest for `str(<libgap object>)`.

The issue is fixed at #19733 and needs review.
