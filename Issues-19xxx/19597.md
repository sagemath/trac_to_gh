Replace code of the form

```
x.__eq__(y)
x.__len__()
x.__getitem__(y)
x.__contains__(y)
...
```
by

```
x == y
len(x)
x[y]
y in x
...
```
because the latter are more efficient.

The obvious exceptions are `super()` calls and `Class.__method__(...)` calls.

In a few cases, we reorganize the code to avoid special functions/methods altogether:
1. for `__repr__()`, we instead change `%s` to `%r` for `%`-formatting and `{}` to `{!r}` for `.format()`.
2. certain calls to `__iter__()` can be changed to a simple list comprehension.
3. there are subtle differences between `x.__eq__(y)` and `x == y` and in certain technical cases they do matter.

More comments:

`combinat/root_system/weyl_characters.py`: a very strange way to compute powers `self * self ** (n-1)`. I guess that generic power would be better here!

`groups/perm_gps/permgroup.py`: Is there any difference between `list(L)` and `[x for x in L]`? As far as I understand `list` is smarter and call for `__len__` to allocate directly the right amount of memory. Whereas the second uses `.append`.

About `__dealloc__`: there is no `__dealloc__` method, it's a "fake" Cython method just like `__cinit__`. It's just not possible to call it.

In `src/sage/combinat/crystals/tensor_product.py`, you are probably wondering why I still use `__lt__` instead of `<` for example. That's because the `__lt__` method can return `NotImplemented`. In this case, the output of `x < y` is not the same as `x.__lt__(y)`.

Well, there wasn't a single non-optional doctest for `str(<libgap object>)`.

The issue is fixed at #19733 and needs review.
