Seems good, and Sage is better with this than without. Hence set to positive_review.

However, there are some dollar signs used at docstrings. I have been said that I should use backstick. As you don't introduce new dollar signs, this patch can't make things any worse. I don't remember the rationale behind dollar-backstick -difference.

(Also "computes" and "returns" should be "return", but that's a place for a new ticket, I think.)

Thanks!

I also use backticks, and I thought that both were equivalent in docstrings but I changed replaced some of them <code>$ -> \`</code> as it apparently interfered with the index table (some LaTeX formulas surrounded by $ were misinterpreted).

My pleasure. I guess this is one of the four places where Sage should have good help pages, and so a very good addition.

Sphinx, I think. It is unfriendly piece of software.
