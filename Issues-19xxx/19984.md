Hmm, I presume one doesn't need to fix checksums before Sage's python is up and running.
I'd rather just rely on built-in argparse of Sage's python.

Or rather rely on system's python having argparse. I cannot imagine people on Python 2.6 who must build Sage from source, but cannot update Python, or at least install argparse.

`sage-download-file` is used for **downloading** packages, which we must do in order to install Python in the first place.

The fixing checksums is just an extra at this point, but of course its almost the same code as checking  the checksum.

Btw pip itself bundles about 10 required packages because it can't be used to install its own dependencies either.
