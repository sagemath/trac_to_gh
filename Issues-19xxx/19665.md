In #18662 I implemented global and semi-global minimal models for elliptic curves over number fields.  I have used this code a lot in preparing data for he LMFDB.  I just ran into a bug -- the curve here is defined over a non-Galois cubic field and the error comes when doing a computation with the base change to the Galois closure:

```
K.<a> =	NumberField(x^3 - 7*x - 5)
E = EllipticCurve([a, 0, 1, 2*a^2 + 5*a + 3, -a^2 - 3*a - 2])
assert E.conductor().norm() ==	8
G = K.galois_group(names='b')
def conj_curve(E,sigma): return EllipticCurve([sigma(a) for a in E.ainvs()])
EL = conj_curve(E,G[0])
L = EL.base_field()
assert L.class_number()	== 2
EL.isogeny_class()
#RuntimeError: Error in check_Kraus_global combining transforms at 2 and 3                                     
```

I will work on fixing this right away.
