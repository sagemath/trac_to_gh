When upgrading GSL, there are problems with `sage/ext/interpreters` due to missing dependency checking. I could have gone for a minimal fix, but I decided to fundamentally simplify the building of interpreters, at the expense of making this branch more complicated.

Those "interpreters" involve a lot of files (there are generated .pyx, .pxd, .c and .h files), so the dependencies are difficult for Cython to follow. With this patch, the .h files are completely gone.

This commit was cherry-picked from the positively-reviewed branch at #19756.
