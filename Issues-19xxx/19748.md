Haluk Sengun reported this:

```
sage: k.<a> = NumberField(x^2 + 7)
sage: N = k.ideal(9)
sage: from sage.modular.cusps_nf import number_of_Gamma0_NFCusps
sage: number_of_Gamma0_NFCusps(N)
...
PariError: inconsistent variables in nf_to_scalar_or_basis, u != y
```

For a simpler sequence which triggers the bug:

```
sage: k.<a> = NumberField(x^2 + 7)
sage: ugens = k.unit_group().gens(); ugens
(u,)
sage: I = k.ideal(3)
sage: I.invertible_residues_mod(ugens)
```

The following works, showing how to fix it (possibly):

```
sage: I.invertible_residues_mod([k(u) for u in ugens])
```
