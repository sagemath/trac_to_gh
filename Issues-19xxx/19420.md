```
At the moment we have

```
sage: G = GrowthGroup('(e^x)^ZZ*x^ZZ')
sage: e1 = G('e^x'); e1
e^x
sage: var('e')
sage: log(e1^2, base=e^2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ArithmeticError: Cannot build log((e^x)^2) since log(e^x) is not in Growth Group (e^x)^ZZ * x^ZZ.
```
Make this give a result...

Depends on #19083
