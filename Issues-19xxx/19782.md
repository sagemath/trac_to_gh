Why? I think this should be done as early as possible in the build process. It is convenient if all other scripts in Sage can assume the existence of the basic directory structure.

And given that this basic directory structure is created by `configure`, it is most natural to create also the `lib64` symlink there.

That's purely a "release management" thing. There is no fundamental reason for it, it's only because of your workflow.

How many Sage developers are comfortable working with configure.ac? Maybe 5%? 

> That's purely a "release management" thing. There is no fundamental reason for it, it's only because of your workflow.


There is a fundamental reason, OSX doesn't come with autotools so we can't do the configure.ac -> configure at the client. Any change to configure.ac necessarily entails further release steps, which is why I really don't like stuff thats absolutely not configureable in there.

Replying to [comment:18 jdemeyer]:
> It allows for example `sage-env` and other scripts to assume that those directories exist. 


`sage-env` shouldn't do anythning besides setting up the environment, it certainly shouldn't do anyhing different depending on how far along we are in the install process.

1. You could do a custom install of autotools on those clients.

2. You could run `./bootstrap -s` on your "release management" machine and then copy over the `configure` tarball. This is easily automated.
