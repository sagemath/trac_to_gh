Implementation in the category of posets works but is unoptimal for finite posets. It compares every pair of elements twice, using only `le()` function.

Also there is a slight bug:

```
P = Posets.PentagonPoset()
print P.is_antichain_of_poset([2,3,'junk'])
print P.is_antichain_of_poset(['junk',2,3])
```

Prints `False` and then gives an error.

After `P = Posets.BooleanLattice(10); l = P.level_sets()[5]` this patch reduced time for `P.is_antichain_of_poset(l)` from 642 ms to 558 ms. That is 13% faster.

At the same time the index in `posets.py` can be slightly better, as now both `is_chain_of_poset()` and `is_antichain_of_poset()` are defined in the same file. Also the user will get error message always, if there is an element of `elms` not in the poset.

The code may seem slightly odd, but AFAIK there is no built-in way in Python to get pairs `(a,b)` from list `L` such that `L.index(a) < L.index(b)`. This implementation was fastest I found.

However, I am waiting for #18941 to get accepted (or rejected). Then I'll add this to index of functions. (Assuming that #19061 isn't done yet.)

I would want that to return `False` since that is not an antichain of the poset, but I know some people agree that it would be a bug (see the `is_similar` discussion).

At least then `P.is_antichain_of_poset(['junk',2,3])` should also return `False`, not raise an exception. And for example `is_induced_subposet()` raises exception in similar situation.

I guess for this one we have no common view and so this can be closed as *wontfix*, but I'll wait for a week or two if others have more opinions.

We have a clear disagreement here. I want to change this to be like `is_induced_subposet`, you want just the opposite.

I'll write to sage-devel.

OK. It's not actually very big, as even the current version is fast.
