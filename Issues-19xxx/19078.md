Implementation in the category of posets works but is unoptimal for finite posets. It compares every pair of elements twice, using only `le()` function.

Also there is a slight bug:

```
P = Posets.PentagonPoset()
print P.is_antichain_of_poset([2,3,'junk'])
print P.is_antichain_of_poset(['junk',2,3])
```

Prints `False` and then gives an error.

It depends. Do you consider `P.is_antichain_of_poset([2,3,'junk'])` (where `2<3` in the poset) a bug or a good short-circuit evaluation?

Nope, we already have `is_chain` and `is_chain_of_poset`. Better to have `is_antichain_of_poset` for symmetry.

I would want that to return `False` since that is not an antichain of the poset, but I know some people agree that it would be a bug (see the `is_similar` discussion).

At least then `P.is_antichain_of_poset(['junk',2,3])` should also return `False`, not raise an exception. And for example `is_induced_subposet()` raises exception in similar situation.

I guess for this one we have no common view and so this can be closed as *wontfix*, but I'll wait for a week or two if others have more opinions.

We have a clear disagreement here. I want to change this to be like `is_induced_subposet`, you want just the opposite.

I'll write to sage-devel.

OK. It's not actually very big, as even the current version is fast.

True, but other possibility is worst, as it can pass some errors unnoticed.
