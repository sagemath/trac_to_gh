Implementation in the category of posets works but is unoptimal for finite posets. It compares every pair of elements twice, using only `le()` function.

Also there is a slight bug:

```
P = Posets.PentagonPoset()
print P.is_antichain_of_poset([2,3,'junk'])
print P.is_antichain_of_poset(['junk',2,3])
```

Prints `False` and then gives an error.

After `P = Posets.BooleanLattice(10); l = P.level_sets()[5]` this patch reduced time for `P.is_antichain_of_poset(l)` from 642 ms to 558 ms. That is 13% faster.

At the same time the index in `posets.py` can be slightly better, as now both `is_chain_of_poset()` and `is_antichain_of_poset()` are defined in the same file. Also the user will get error message always, if there is an element of `elms` not in the poset.

The code may seem slightly odd, but AFAIK there is no built-in way in Python to get pairs `(a,b)` from list `L` such that `L.index(a) < L.index(b)`. This implementation was fastest I found.

However, I am waiting for #18941 to get accepted (or rejected). Then I'll add this to index of functions. (Assuming that #19061 isn't done yet.)

At least then `P.is_antichain_of_poset(['junk',2,3])` should also return `False`, not raise an exception. And for example `is_induced_subposet()` raises exception in similar situation.

I guess for this one we have no common view and so this can be closed as *wontfix*, but I'll wait for a week or two if others have more opinions.

We have a clear disagreement here. I want to change this to be like `is_induced_subposet`, you want just the opposite.

I'll write to sage-devel.

OK. It's not actually very big, as even the current version is fast.

This done, but we got only one answer. It voted for raising an exception. Should we proceed with that ("vote" 2-1), or ask for more opinions?
