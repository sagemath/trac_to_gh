```
sage: (x^(1/2)).coefficient(x, 1/3)
sqrt(x)
```
It seems that `1/3` gets `0` (floor division, whyever).

EDIT: because the function takes an integer:

```
        INPUT:

        - ``s`` - expression

        - ``n`` - integer, default 1
```
so it's rather an enhancement.

This branch needs pynac-0.7.11+ and allows any coefficient. There is different behaviour in this doctest:

```
             sage: f = (a*sqrt(2))*x^2 + sin(y)*x^(1/2) + z^z
...
             sage: f.coefficient(x, 0)
-            sqrt(x)*sin(y) + z^z
+            z^z
```
