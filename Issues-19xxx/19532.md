<a id='comment:11'></a>I reviewed the code, doctests pass, documentation and code are mostly fine. I added a few reviewer commits, please cross-review.

There is only the question on what to do with integral `alpha <= 0`. Currently, the result is `0` which is certainly correct for sufficiently large values of the parameter. However, the rest of the asymptotics code as I remember it does not really assume "sufficiently large values of the parameter".

I am not really sure which result is appropriate. Several options:
- `0` - valid for sufficiently large values of the parameter. (current version)
- `O(1)` - correct, but bad for applications.
- raise an error
- add a warning to the documentation
- add a note to the documentation

I think the result should be `O(0)`. Currently I am thinking about an implementation of such a term and playing around a bit. If you want to get this ticket to positive, then I would raise a NotImplementedError at the moment. But give me a couple of days to figure out how `O(0)` would be possible.

`f(n)` is in `O(0)` if there is an `N` such that `f(n)=0` for `n >= N`. Thus the coefficients of polynomials (seen as power series) would be in `O(0)`.

> How would that affect #19944?


E.g. inserting the generating function `(1-z)^alpha` for non-negative integers `alpha` would result in a `O(0)`, but this behavior comes from this ticket here. I am not sure if #19944 would need adaptions.

so `O(0)` would be smaller than any other element in the poset and be absorbed by any other error term? Would it live in some kind of `n^ZZbar` with `ZZbar = {- infinity} \cup ZZ`?

ok, may be.

The question is whether it is worth the effort. After working on #19944 I doubt that this generator here will frequently be called outside of #19944. After all, calling #19944 with a polynomial as an argument is erroneous anyway, because polynomials do not have singularities. Thus we should never have to return `O(0)` so we might as well go for a warning box here and be done with the problem.

I'm afraid, we would really need a growth of `0` to make it work correctly with cartesian products.
