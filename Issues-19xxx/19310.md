`src/sage/symbolic/expression.pyx` claims

```
        The hash of an object in Python or its coerced version into
        the symbolic ring is the same::
```

This is unfortunately not true since Pynac uses the 32-bit `unsigned` data type for hashes:

```
sage: hash(ZZ(2^32))
4294967296
sage: hash(SR(2^32))
0
```
