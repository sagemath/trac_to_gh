After #19101, `sage -f PKG` first deletes `local/var/lib/sage/installed/PKG-*` and then runs `sage -i PKG`.

I propose to move the rule of removing `local/var/lib/sage/installed/PKG-*` to `build/make/Makefile` as a `PKG-clean` target. This would make it easier to extend the functionality of `sage -f FOO` to non-packages, for example

```
sage -f optional   # force install all optional packages
sage -f python     # force install correct version of Python (python2 or python3 package)
```

I don't see why... so far Sage has always appended log files and I see no reason to change that on this ticket.
