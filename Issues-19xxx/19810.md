The code to determine the actual key from `*args` and `**kwds` for cached functions is duplicated (even with slightly different implementations!) in many methods. There is also a lot of indirection and Python calls.

We add a new Cython method `get_key_args_kwds()` to solve this problem and do a lot of optimizations.

**Before**:

```
sage: def f(x): return x
sage: cf = cached_function(f)
sage: timeit('cf(1)', number=10^6, repeat=100)
1000000 loops, best of 100: 395 ns per loop
```

**After**:

```
sage: def f(x): return x
sage: cf = cached_function(f)
sage: timeit('cf(1)', number=10^6, repeat=100)
1000000 loops, best of 100: 348 ns per loop
```

<a id='comment:8'></a>Do we have figures on what kind of optimization gain is obtained by these changes? Or are we just getting the benefit of having more streamlined and hence more maintainable code?

I noticed this one:

```
-        new = lambda x: not has_key(get_key(*x[0],**x[1]))
+        new = lambda x: not has_key(self.get_key(*x[0],**x[1]))
         arglist = filter(new, map(normalize_input, arglist))
```
Writing that as a list comprehension should avoid an extra (expensive) python call, so should be a little faster.

That's an additional advantage. Cached functions need a big cleanup, and this ticket is part of that (I already did #19695 and #19768 earlier).
