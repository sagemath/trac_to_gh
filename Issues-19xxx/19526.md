The following methods fail for immutable graphs:

* `GenericGraph.disjoint_routed_paths`
* `GenericGraph.genus`
* `GenericGraph.is_circular_planar`
* `GenericGraph.is_cut_edge`
* `GenericGraph.is_interval`
* `GenericGraph.layout_planar`
* `GenericGraph.multicommodity_flow`
* `GenericGraph.set_planar_positions`
* `GenericGraph.steiner_tree`
* `GenericGraph.to_simple`
* `GenericGraph.vertex_disjoint_paths`
* `Graph.gomory_hu_tree`
* `Graph.is_long_antihole_free`
* `Graph.is_long_hole_free`
* `Graph.is_weakly_chordal`
* `Graph.join`
* `Graph.seidel_switching`
* `Graph.topological_minor`
* `Graph.tutte_polynomial`

I have changed these methods (or ones they depend on) to make a copy of the appropriate (sub)graph if one is needed. To prevent making unneeded copies of (potentially large) graphs, the methods `to_directed`, `to_undirected`, `to_simple`, `subgraph`, `disjoint_union`, `union` and `join` now take an additional parameter `immutable` specifying whether the returned graph should be mutable or not (with the default `None` specifying the old behaviour, i.e. keeping the mutability of the input).

A minor exception is the `subgraph` method, which would always return a mutable graph when the "add" algorithm was being used, but this is now made consistent with the "delete" algorithm and other methods.

The reason I need these methods to work on immutable graphs is that I am part of a team building a database of graphs with precomputed attributes (so the graphs being mutable would make no sense) which will be accessible through Sage - of course we still want to do stuff with the graphs that won't change them.

<a id='comment:3'></a>Helloooooo Janos,

Here is a first-pass review.

- Modification to `DiGraph.to_undirected` -- adding a `immutable` flag as you do
  it in this function is problematic. What is the intended behavior of
  `g.to_undirected(sparse=False,immutable=True)` ? `:-/`

  This kind of compatibilities should be handled by the constructor. So, to
  avoid to do its job again, the best is probably to give it all the arguments
  you get and hope that it does its job.

- Could you write this `is_immutable` function? Then this
  {{{
  +        if getattr(self, '_immutable', False):
  +            G = copy(self)
  +        else:
  +            G = self
  }}}
  Could become
  {{{
  G = self.copy(immutable=False) if self.is_immutable() else self
  }}}

- I don't think it is worth testing if we work on a copy here `^^;`
  {{{
  -        self.add_edge(u,v,label)
  +        if not getattr(self, '_immutable', False):
  +            G.add_edge(u,v,label)
  }}}

- `Graph.to_directed` -- same remark as for `DiGraph.to_undirected`

- Same function -- the documentation of `immutable` is not indented right. You
  can build the doc to observe it with
  `sage -b && sage -docbuild reference/graphs html`

Thanks,

Nathann

<a id='comment:4'></a>Hi!

Thanks for the review. I'll implement the suggestions shortly.

I guess the right thing to do here is to remove the `immutable` flag from `to_(un)directed` in both `Graph` and `DiGraph`, and use `Graph(G)` instead of `G.to_undirected(immutable=False)`, and `DiGraph(G)` instead of `G.to_directed(immutable=False)`.

As for `g.to_undirected(sparse=False,immutable=True)`, there should've been a check to yield an error if this is called (instead of just returning a sparse immutable graph), but since I'm removing `immutable`, this is now a non-issue.

What about `GenericGraph.to_simple`? Since there is no corresponding constructor, it would probably be OK to have `immutable` here?

Yep. And it convinces me even more that we should remove those functions totally. In another ticket, if you don't feel like doing it.

Yepyep, that should be good.

<a id='comment:8'></a>Hellooooooooooooooo,

It all looks good, but I have one question left about this modification:

```diff
-    G = G.relabel(inplace=False) # making sure the vertices are integers
+    if G.is_immutable():
+        G = G.copy(immutable=False)
+        G.relabel(inplace=True)
+    else:
+        G = G.relabel(inplace=False) # making sure the vertices are integers
```

Why wouldn't you add the same argument 'immutable' to 'relabel' instead? It seems that you only want something like `G.relabel(inplace=False,immutable=False)`?..
