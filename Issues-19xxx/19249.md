Hello,

This looks very nice indeed, but because I expect the review to be rather long in this case, it would probably be best to start by exposing a reduced amount of features from your library. A general function to compute the treewidth exactly, for instance, would be ideal as we would be able to compare its output with what we already have (which is *slow*).

For a start, I guess that some things should be done directly in your library: is it necessary to have Sage apply a patch to it? Is there a reason why what your patch does cannot already be included in your code?

Your makefile appears to be manual, and it would probably be best to have it created by autotools. I had to learn this not so long ago and I found it rather painful to learn, but the purpose is to make sure that your code will compile everywhere, so that you do not need to test every platform manually. I can probably help with that, as well as send you a pdf book that helped me a lot while learning it.

Finally, I am not sure if you are aware that you can have C instructions in a 'def' function of a cython file. I see that you have several `cdef cython_<something>` functions with a `def <something>` couterpart, and there is no technical reason to do that. If you have another reason for doing this, then consider this remark as an mistake from my part.

Is your code available on some web page? Is there a public repository for it? Are you the only author? Are there theoretical publications related to it? This kind of information would be interesting to us, and is expected to be found in a SPKG.txt file.

<a id='comment:6'>Comment 6:</a>
While testing my version of an exact algorithm for treewidth against the sage version, i noticed that the sage version doesnt work: it is NOT sufficient to just consider the neighbourhood of computed cut. Counterexample:

G = Graph()
G.add_vertex(0)
G.add_vertex(1)
G.add_vertex(2)
G.add_vertex(3)
G.add_vertex(4)
G.add_vertex(5)
G.add_vertex(6)
G.add_vertex(7)
G.add_vertex(8)
G.add_edge(0,2)
G.add_edge(0,3)
G.add_edge(0,5)
G.add_edge(0,6)
G.add_edge(1,4)
G.add_edge(1,8)
G.add_edge(2,8)
G.add_edge(3,4)
G.add_edge(4,5)
G.add_edge(4,7)
G.add_edge(6,8)
G.add_edge(7,8)
G.treewidth()

But G has treewidth 2. (you possibly have to change the vertex labeling to see the error).

And the error can be arbitrary bad. One can construct a graph, such that a cut is not connected in a graph and has to be included in a bag of a tree decomposition. Here it is {0,4,8}.

I have to instantiante template functions and convert a "sage graph" to a boost graph.

Is there a minimal example for that? 

The "tdlib"-part of the documentation has failed to build (UNABLE TO IMPORT MODULE): Is there some import-statement missing? What can be the reasons (its not the content of the *.pyx-file)?

I still believe that you can do it without patching your code. Let your code deal with boost graphs only, and let Sage only call it on Boost instances (see sage/graphs/base/boost_graph.pyx). This issue should not be a reason to patch your library.

In this case, the patches are inevitable (treedecompositions are boost graphs with a set as a vertex property). I could merely displace some graph conversion stuff into the library..

Some technical points: the source tarball is *not* meant to be committed, you should just provide a link on this ticket (or attach it to this ticket).

Second, can you write to upstream about the autotools-based build system? Ideally, it should be added to upstream instead of Sage.

Third, autotools is not part of Sage: you must not run `autogen.sh` in `spkg-install`. If upstream does not want autotools, then you should put the autotools-based build system in the source tarball directly (both the autotools source files and the generated files).

Indeed. And when the original (aka 'upstream') tarball is updated (and if we want this update to be reflected in Sage) then we must open a ticket to update it. That's the workflow nowadays.

<a id='comment:33'>Comment 33:</a>
Helloooooooooo Lukas,

Here is another review:

- From the url at which you placed your tarball I found your website, and this
  page [1] really looks like "TdLib's official page". Could you add this url at
  the end of the 'description' section of the SPKG.txt file?

- It would be cool if your tarball contained a 'license' (or 'copying') file
  asserting that it is licensed under the GPL2.

- I do not understand why you need to copy/paste sage_tdlib.cpp into your
  tarball if you want it to compile. Could you please explain me? In no other
  package do we need to do such a thing. Usually the tarball works by itself,
  and we have in Sage some interface code that is linked with it.

- One such instance is the interface with boost. You will find it in the
  following files:

      sage/graphs/base/boost_graph.pyx
      sage/graphs/base/boost_graph.pxd
      sage/graphs/base/boost_interface.cpp

- Your 'spkg-install' file copies files that you removed from your tarball
  (i.e. ./.libs/*)

- I do not understand what exactly this warning means. Could you tell me? `^^;`

  ```
  +#!!!!!!   NOTICE   !!!!!!!!
  +#Sage vertices have to be named by unsigned integers
  +#Sage bags of decompositions have to be lists of unsigned integers
  +#!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
  ```

- Could you strip 'cython_' from the beginning of the functions you define?

- The code of `get_width` can be replaced by:

  ```
  return max(len(x) for x in T)-1
  ```

- It is slightly incorrect to have your class `TreeDecomposition` inherit from
  `Graph`, while having a function like `get_width` rely on the vertices' labels
  (you assume that they are sets). Indeed, the vertices of a graph can be
  relabeled, which would break this function. I don't think that you need this
  class, to be honest.

- We have something like `for(auto i: something)` in python. You can rewrite

  ```
  +    V_python = G.vertices()
  +    for i in range(0, len(V_python)):
  +        V.push_back(V_python[i])
  ```
  As

  ```
  +    for v in G:
  +        V.push_back(v)
  ```

  (it occurs several times in your code)

- Similarly (don't scream -- I know it can hurt when you see it for the first
  time) you can write this in Python:

  ```
  a,b = 1,2
  ```
  Which means that this also works

  ```
  for u,v,l in G.edges():
      E.push_back(u)
      E.push_back(v)
  ```
  Note that if you don't need the labels, then this also works:

  ```
  for u,v in G.edges(labels=False):
      E.push_back(u)
      E.push_back(v)
  ```

  spaces).

Since there is no cython-way to generate a boost graph with an appended struct for the vertices (boost_graph.pyx only supports appended structs for edges), a boost graph has to be generated manually (make_tdlib_graph in *.pyx, sage_tdlib_*). 

If there would exist a cython-interface for the required graphs, one could build the *.so by instantiating the exact algorithm, which would require to copy a *.cpp file (that only containes a line that instantiates the exact algorithm) and a makefile into the tarball.

Do you have a idea for this?

./libs is generated by make (automake creates a .libs by default) -> ./libs should exist

G.vertices() should return a list of unsigned integers, e.g. treedecomposition_exact() does not work with TutteGraph(), since TutteGraph().vertices() returnes a list of tuples

Ok, i just thought something like that would be nice:

sage: T = tdlib.treedecomposition_exact(G)
tree decomposition of width 4 computed
sage: T
Treedecomposition of width 4 on 15 vertices <--

Would it be better to use g.name("tree decompostion") for this purposes?

I'm still not understand exactly what you explain. I may be missing something obvious, but we will probably understand each other eventually:

I understand from what you tell me that the graph data structure that is used in your library is not exactly a boost graph, but 'a boost graph plus something'.

If this 'something' is about a list of labels for vertices, then it probably means that boost_interface should be updated to handle it. If it is something more specific to tree-decompositions, then it should belong to the files you create.

Here is how I see the situation (tell me if -- for some reason -- it does not apply):

1) You have a library that take a data X as input, and returns a data Y as output. To us that is "upstream's design decision", and we usually have no control over X nor over Y.

2) We have some Cython code that takes a graph, and converts it into format X. We call the library's functions on the data it expects, and get some data Y as a result, which we convert back into Cython/Python before handing it back to the user

3) If, because of some limitation of Cython, we cannot directly convert Python into X (or turn Y into Python) then we can have another layer in the middle, i.e. a c++ file, which is what happens with boost_interface.

This way we adapt to whatever the library expect, and there is no need to have anything sage-related in the library.

Oh, I see. Usually the copying of the files produced by a 'make' is performed by 'make install'. Is there a reason why you don't use it?

> G.vertices() should return a list of unsigned integers, e.g. treedecomposition_exact() does not work with TutteGraph(), since TutteGraph().vertices() returnes a list of tuples

I see. That happens very often with any kind of 'efficient' code, as handling labels really is a hassle (trust me `:-/`). That shouldn't be a constraint on the user, however, but on ourselves. In those cases, we usually call the library's function on a *relabelled* copy of the graph (so that the vertices are integers), and apply the inverse treatment on its output so that the user gets what (s)he expects (and in particular so that (s)he can call the function on any kind of graph).

Definitely `:-)`

Hello,

Replying to [@nathanncohen](#comment%3A36):
> 3) If, because of some limitation of Cython, we cannot directly convert Python into X (or turn Y into Python) then we can have another layer in the middle, i.e. a c++ file, which is what happens with boost_interface.

In my opinion, this is the case and for that reason sage_tdlib.cpp exists. In addition, i cannot use boost_interface, since vertex properties are not covered there. As mentioned above, i need a 

ctypedef BoostGraph[vecS, vecS, undirectedS, vecS, X] BG,

where X is some struct. Concrete (see sage_tdlib.cpp):

For the input graph

```

struct Vertex{
    ...
    ...
    unsigned int id;
    ...
};

typedef boost::adjacency_list<boost::setS, boost::vecS, boost::undirectedS, Vertex> TD_graph_t;
```


And for the output treedecomposition:


```
struct bag{
    ...
    ...
    std::set<unsigned int> bag;
    ...
};

typedef boost::adjacency_list<boost::vecS, boost::vecS, boost::undirectedS, bag> TD_tree_dec_t;
```

The reason for sage_tdlib.cpp is to do the conversion

sage graph -> V,E as vectors -> boost graph

and

boost graph (tree decomposition) -> V, E, bags as vectors -> sage graph.

> This way we adapt to whatever the library expect, and there is no need to have anything sage-related in the library.

Currently, nothing sage-related (except for the build-system) is in the library.

Helloooooooo Lucas !

I see I see, thank you for the details. Why then do you need to copy `sage_tdlib.cpp` *inside* of your archive before compiling it? This is the thing that bothers me.

Where is the right place for the automake-generated makefiles and related stuff? Currently, this files are located in the tarball, but that is misguided since they refer to sage_tdlib.*. Maybe in some directory in spkg/tdlib along with sage_tdlib?

In the official upstream tarball.

Somehow, your none of the files contained in your tarball (including the makefiles) should mention this sage_tdlib file.

<a id='comment:53'>Comment 53:</a>
Current state:

-Since tdlib is a template library, an installation just copies the headers to SAGELOCAL/include/tdlib

-The sage-distutils build-system will build a shared library out of sage_tdlib.cpp and the headers in /include/tdlib

-sage_tdlib.cpp is necessary until /base/boost_graph supportes vertex properties (especially std::set). currently, edge properties are supported and vertex properties are pre-defined by some vertex ids

-Even if /base/boost_graph is updated, s.t. vertex properties are supported, some c-code layer is necessary for instanciating the library code with the needed type -> in each case, a c-code layer is necessary.

Hellooooooooooo Lukas !

Okay, I give up `:-)`

I tried to shortcut your .cpp file but I wasn't able to, and even though I may have gotten 'close' my solutions were very awkward and would probably be a shot in our feet if we ever need something more generic. Let it stay as it is.

What would you think of modifying `Graph.treewidth` right now in order to make it call your library when it is installed?

The way we do it is (see `Graph.automorphism_group`) to have an 'algorithm' selector set to `None`  by default (which means 'use the best routine available'), which can also be defined manually if one wants to call Sage's algorithm or yours, explicitly.

This also lets us write doctests to check that both algorithms return the same value.

Either way this ticket will soon be merged in Sage. Thanks,

Nathann

I agree =)

Currently, the tdlib-algorithm computes the treewidth in each case and k is a lower bound on the resulting width. I will add some code to support the version 'treewidth < k?' soon. 

Thanks for your review!
