Symbolic expressions may be part of type-neutral computations, e.g. matrices, polynomials. Developers do not expect proof machinery to crank up when writing `if x!=0`, but this is just what happens. So `bool(x1!=x2)` should be changed to mean `not (x1-x2).is_trivial_zero()` for symbolic `x`. The ticket should provide a different interface for cases requiring simplification/proof:
* `bool(rel)` equivalent to `(not)(LHS-RHS).is_trivial_zero()` for ==,!= ; and for <, >, <=, >= the result follows alpha order of lhs and rhs
* `satisfiable(rel)` attempting simplification/proof, returning `(Yes,example)/False/Undefined`
* `solve(rel)` in case of `satisfiable=Yes` returning the full solution set
* `holds(rel)`, quick alias of `satisfiable` (later without giving an example)
* `ex.is_zero(simplify=False)` (default) calling the fast `bool(ex==0)`
* `ex.is_zero(simplify=True)` attempting simplification/proof by calling `ex==0`.holds()
* `prove(rel)` showing more or less steps of simplification (which is out of reach for the moment)

This ticket will implement the new behaviour of `bool(rel)` and put all other functionality of `ex.__nonzero__()` into `holds()` and `ex.is_zero(simplify=True)`.

`bool(not x)` calls `PyObject_IsTrue` which calls `Expression.__nonzero__` which atm tries to prove that `x` is nonzero
> or with `not x` replaced by `x.is_zero()`.

This calls `PyObject_IsTrue` as well.

Right, `Expression.__nonzero__` will then call `x.is_trivial_zero()` and everyone who wants a proof needs a dfferent method.

I agree that the change would be actually good (for the reason why you created this ticket). 

Thoug, for symbolic expression we want to create equations and check their validity

```
sage: cos(x)**2 + sin(x)**2 == 1
cos(x) == sin(x)
sage: bool(_)
True
```
The above will not be enough anymore. What would be the new way of checking? This needs to be emphasized a lot in the documentation as it is backward incompatible. And I guess it is worth a thread on sage-devel. Not necessarily right now, it is always good to have concrete propositions.

You should also have a look to `sage/tests/*` where I am sure some of the things are broken.

This is a long-standing omission, and it would resolve conceptual problems of #17700. It would use #19000 and, if that finds no solution, Maxima as before. SMT solvers can also give a satisfying `x` in case of satisfiability, but no full solution which is the task of `solve`.

Three fails.

A small remark: From the documentation of the method `holds`

```
If Sage knows exactly that the relation is
undecidable it will throw an ``AttributeError``.
```
For **one** relation there **always** is an algorithm which is either `return True` or `return False`. What is not possible is to design an algorithm whose input is an equation and answers the validity of the input. Your sentence makes no sense. A right formulation would be

```
If Sage does not know if the equation is valid it will
throw a ``NotImplementedError``. Note that the validity
of equations is an undecidable problem. Hence there will
always be instances for which such error is raised.
```
(`AttributeError` makes no sense here).

What would be the difference between the output `NotImplemented` and `Undecidable`!?

As I already mentioned in [comment 24](#comment%3A24), it makes few sense that `satisfiable(expr)` returns `Undecidable`. Each formula is either `True` or `False`. I am here only assuming that mathematics are consistent. Of course `satisfiable` can not work for all input and when it can not it should return `NotImplemented`. That being said, some formula `expr` have no proof of their truthness (from Godel), but then I doubt any computer would actually be able to prove it.

In an ideal world, the function `satisfiable(expr)` would return one of:
- `(True, example)`
- `(False, proof)`
- `NotImplemented`

But do you have a syntax in mind for it. It would be cool to not multiply ad libitum the `satisfiable`, `holds`, etc which are exactly the same thing with a choice of quantifiers.

Which probably means lots of user code being broken, see my experience on [sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-devel/ojHqBy7oUVU/discussion).

In my opinion, for any change in this area, be it fixing a perceived bug or not, we definitely need a deprecation. We do not need on what user's code relies and `sage/tests/*` is in no ways a representative sample (but even some code fails there).

The existing deprecation framework may not be enough: for some time, old and new code should be compared and a warning should be raised if the outcome is different. Users should be able to silence this warning once they have converted their code to the new behaviour; and the sage library should also silence the warning for its own use only. No idea how to implement this nicely, but I see no other option.

We are speaking about users, not developers.

The most we could perhaps expect from users is to read well-written release notes giving a hint what changed. We do not currently have those.

> Since Sage cannot know which of your changes should be monitored for different behaviour (because there is no distinction between a user adding code and a developer adding code), you would need to initiate this subscription yourself. Anyway, a deprecation message every time `bool(relation)` is called is out of the question, much more so for all possible changes to Sage. Also, performance would suffer because of all the checks.

Library code could call a *new* method or something like that. But it is certainly ugly.

We do have a deprecation policy for much less serious cases: if a method is renamed, we have a one-year deprecation period; the only harm done is that a user gets a message that a method does no longer exist.

Changing the behaviour of `bool(...)` **silently** leads to different results which might be wrong.

I see the following options:
1. Not changing fundamental behaviour.
2. Changing fundamental behaviour at some really **major** release where we support old user code for much longer than usual (compare Python 2/Python 3)
3. Some kind of deprecation system

Simply making a fundamental change in a random version (say 7.2) and letting users alone with their old code is not an option for me.

> You seem to be of the opinion that there exists a representative sample of tests that covers all eventualities.

Certainly not, I think the contrary.

I was surprised that at some point on this ticket, changed behaviour was caught by tests in `src/sage/tests`, given that those tests there seem to be quite random.
