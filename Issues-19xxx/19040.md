Symbolic expressions may be part of type-neutral computations, e.g. matrices, polynomials. Developers do not expect proof machinery to crank up when writing `if x!=0`, but this is just what happens. So `bool(x1!=x2)` should be changed to mean `not (x1-x2).is_trivial_zero()` for symbolic `x`. The ticket should provide a different interface for cases requiring simplification/proof:
* `bool(rel)` equivalent to `(not)(LHS-RHS).is_trivial_zero()` for ==,!= ; and for <, >, <=, >= the result follows alpha order of lhs and rhs
* `satisfiable(rel)` attempting simplification/proof, returning `(Yes,example)/False/Undefined`
* `solve(rel)` in case of `satisfiable=Yes` returning the full solution set
* `holds(rel)`, quick alias of `satisfiable` (later without giving an example)
* `ex.is_zero(simplify=False)` (default) calling the fast `bool(ex==0)`
* `ex.is_zero(simplify=True)` attempting simplification/proof by calling `ex==0`.holds()
* `prove(rel)` showing more or less steps of simplification (which is out of reach for the moment)

This ticket will implement the new behaviour of `bool(rel)` and put all other functionality of `ex.__nonzero__()` into `holds()` and `ex.is_zero(simplify=True)`.

<a id='comment:2'></a>Replying to [comment:1 vdelecroix]:
> `    if not x:`

`bool(not x)` calls `PyObject_IsTrue` which calls `Expression.__nonzero__` which atm tries to prove that `x` is nonzero
> or with `not x` replaced by `x.is_zero()`.

This calls `PyObject_IsTrue` as well.
> So this change would also implies to change all of these in a uniform way.

Right, `Expression.__nonzero__` will then call `x.is_trivial_zero()` and everyone who wants a proof needs a dfferent method.

Thoug, for symbolic expression we want to create equations and check their validity

```
sage: cos(x)**2 + sin(x)**2 == 1
cos(x) == sin(x)
sage: bool(_)
True
```
The above will not be enough anymore. What would be the new way of checking? This needs to be emphasized a lot in the documentation as it is backward incompatible. And I guess it is worth a thread on sage-devel. Not necessarily right now, it is always good to have concrete propositions.

You should also have a look to `sage/tests/*` where I am sure some of the things are broken.

{{{

True
}}}
This is a long-standing omission, and it would resolve conceptual problems of #17700. It would use #19000 and, if that finds no solution, Maxima as before. SMT solvers can also give a satisfying `x` in case of satisfiability, but no full solution which is the task of `solve`.

Three fails.

Could. #19000 is not a necessity.

<a id='comment:24'></a>A small remark: From the documentation of the method `holds`

```
If Sage knows exactly that the relation is
undecidable it will throw an ``AttributeError``.
```
For **one** relation there **always** is an algorithm which is either `return True` or `return False`. What is not possible is to design an algorithm whose input is an equation and answers the validity of the input. Your sentence makes no sense. A right formulation would be

```
If Sage does not know if the equation is valid it will
throw a ``NotImplementedError``. Note that the validity
of equations is an undecidable problem. Hence there will
always be instances for which such error is raised.
```
(`AttributeError` makes no sense here).

Which probably means lots of user code being broken, see my experience on [sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-devel/ojHqBy7oUVU/discussion).

In my opinion, for any change in this area, be it fixing a perceived bug or not, we definitely need a deprecation. We do not need on what user's code relies and `sage/tests/*` is in no ways a representative sample (but even some code fails there).

The existing deprecation framework may not be enough: for some time, old and new code should be compared and a warning should be raised if the outcome is different. Users should be able to silence this warning once they have converted their code to the new behaviour; and the sage library should also silence the warning for its own use only. No idea how to implement this nicely, but I see no other option.

    "body": "<a id='comment:51'></a>The easiest way for the user to see if behaviour has changed is to give the command `git diff original-version /path/to/file` and check if doctests were changed. Since the system is huge and users have different needs you either need to do this yourself or Sage automates this by providing some sort of subscription service. Since Sage cannot know which of your changes should be monitored for different behaviour (because there is no distinction between a user adding code and a developer adding code), you would need to initiate this subscription yourself. Anyway, a deprecation message every time `bool(relation)` is called is out of the question, much more so for all possible changes to Sage. Also, performance would suffer because of all the checks.\n\nYou seem to be of the opinion that there exists a representative sample of tests that covers all eventualities. Needless to say there isn't---however, Sage development tries to come close with the code coverage tools.

<a id='comment:51'></a>The easiest way for the user to see if behaviour has changed is to give the command `git diff original-version /path/to/file` and check if doctests were changed. Since the system is huge and users have different needs you either need to do this yourself or Sage automates this by providing some sort of subscription service.

We are speaking about users, not developers.

The most we could perhaps expect from users is to read well-written release notes giving a hint what changed. We do not currently have those.

Library code could call a *new* method or something like that. But it is certainly ugly.

We do have a deprecation policy for much less serious cases: if a method is renamed, we have a one-year deprecation period; the only harm done is that a user gets a message that a method does no longer exist.

Changing the behaviour of `bool(...)` **silently** leads to different results which might be wrong.

I see the following options:
1. Not changing fundamental behaviour.
2. Changing fundamental behaviour at some really **major** release where we support old user code for much longer than usual (compare Python 2/Python 3)
3. Some kind of deprecation system

Simply making a fundamental change in a random version (say 7.2) and letting users alone with their old code is not an option for me.

Certainly not, I think the contrary.

I was surprised that at some point on this ticket, changed behaviour was caught by tests in `src/sage/tests`, given that those tests there seem to be quite random.

The branch is not listed in the ticket field but the recent commits are visible in the comments. The branch can be checked out via `git trac checkout 19040 --branch=u/rws/19040-2`.
