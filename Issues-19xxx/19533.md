One quick comment (I have not fully checked the patch): it would be useful to change the function to

```
def solve(self, c=0)
```
such that `Q.solve()` without argument finds a zero of `Q`. Then adjust the documentation and add a test for this case.

Why divide by `abs(z)` instead of `z`? I'm not saying it's wrong, there is just no reason for it.

You should limit the length of lines to 72 characters if possible,
so wrap this comment:

```
    # Case 2: We found a solution self(x) = 0. Let e be any vector such that B(x,e) != 0, where B is the bilinear form corresponding to self.
    # To find e, just try all unit vectors (0,..0,1,0...0). Let a = (c - self(e))/2*B(x,e) and let y = e + a*x.
    # Then self(y) = B(e + a*x, e + a*x) = self(e) + 2B(e, a*x) = self(e) + 2([c - self(e)]/[2B(x,e)]) * B(x,e) = c.
```
