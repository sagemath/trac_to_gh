Documentation for `graph_plot.py` is something like

```
sage: G = graphs.WheelGraph(15)
sage: P = G.plot()
```

. . . some explanation, list of options . . .

```
sage: sage.graphs.graph_plot.DEFAULT_PLOT_OPTIONS['vertex_shape'] = 's'
 . . .
```

If the user runs second example, the result is

```
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-2-aa626427af43> in <module>()
----> 1 sage.graphs.graph_plot.DEFAULT_PLOT_OPTIONS['vertex_shape'] = 's'

AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'graph_plot'
```

That's because `.plot()` runs `import sage.graphs.graph_plot` which is needed for `DEFAULT_PLOT_OPTIONS` to work. This patch adds `import` to second example.

So the bug is that you have to import the module first? The reason why the second call works is that `.plot()` loads it for you.
