This code provides a fix to use the function `view` on object represented by a picture tikz, in the jupyter notebook (or ipython I guess).

I don't understand the goal of #18116 (the code of this ticket does not work on my sage 6.9) and why the function `show` is better than `view` but... whatever my code works (see the joint notebook)!

I've tried your patch, but appearently I'm doing something wrong:

1) checkout your branch, `./sage -b` (or `make`)

2) `./sage -n jupyter`

3a) New notebook with

```
view(transducers.GrayCode())
```
opens a pdf and shows the transducer there (not embedded)

3b) New notebook with

```
sage.misc.latex.EMBEDDED_MODE = True
view(transducers.GrayCode())
```
returns

```
<IPython.core.display.Image object>
```

Any ideas?

Hello Daniel,

I don't if it is significant but I run 

```
sage -ipython notebook
```
and 

```
sage -n jupyter
```
fails on my mac os laptop with sage 6.9.

I think the problem is that tikz is not loaded by default. I use the following lines in my config file `00-init.ipy` :

```
from sage.misc.latex import latex
latex.add_package_to_preamble_if_available("tikz")
latex.add_to_mathjax_avoid_list("tikz")
sage.misc.latex.EMBEDDED_MODE = True
```

This helps?

Makes not difference for me

Maybe I have `00-init.ipy` in some wrong place (didn't use it up to now). Where should this file be located?

I've put this directly into a notebook cell, but this didn't change anything; it still doesn't work.

PS: I have a Linux machine (Linux Mint 17.2; since you mentioned some other OS)

The file `00-init.ipy` is located in `$HOME/.sage/ipython_genutils-0.1.0/profile_default/startup/`. 
My file contains exactly:

```
from sage.all import *
from sage.misc.latex import latex
latex.add_package_to_preamble_if_available("tikz")
latex.add_to_mathjax_avoid_list("tikz")
sage.misc.latex.EMBEDDED_MODE = True
```

If it does not work... I have no idea how to fix that...

Can this be set automatically (by default) when using the (Jupyter) notebook?

Mucking around with EMBEDDED_MODE global variables is phenomenally fugly, we should work to get rid of that. Most certainly we should not build new stuff that relies on it.

Also, this ticket doesn't let you do anything useful with the pdf file besides immediately showing it, it still doesn't work as displayhook, and further deepens the weird differences between view/show/pretty_print.
