<a id='comment:2'></a>Hello,

1. You wrote

```
from math import sqrt
cdef int n = int(sqrt(n_2_p_1-1))
```
  Sage integers do have a method `sqrtrem` that gives you the square root and the rest

```
sage: x = ZZ.random_element(0,10000)
sage: s,r = x.sqrtrem()
sage: x == s**2 + r
True
```
  But as you are using int from Cython you would better use standard C functions

```
from libc.math cimport sqrt, floor
```

2. Why are you testing withtout the option `resolvable=True`

```
if (k % n          or
   ...
   not orthogonal_array(c+1,n,existence=True)):
      return None
```
  while using in the function

```
def switch_OA_srg(c,n):
    ...
    OA = map(tuple, orthogonal_array(c+1,n,resolvable=True))
    ...
```

3. Use better spacings: `int v,int k,int l` -> `int v, int k, int l`.

4. Do you mind moving out the function `switch_OA_srg` into a global function? With such local definition you are generating again and again different Python functions with the very same code

```
sage: f1 = is_switch_OA_srg(290, 136, 63, 64)[0]
sage: f2 = is_switch_OA_srg(290, 136, 63, 64)[0]
sage: f1 is f2
False
```

5. Could you add an example of a SRG that was not available before?

It is not that I would mind, but mostly that I would not know how to write its documentation to my taste. The subfunction takes `c` and `n`  as parameters, whose role has to be explained. Plus 'c' is actually used twice in the function in "different ways" (it has two different meanings in the construction), so that the independent function should probably differenciate the two uses of 'c' instead of tying them to be equal (and I have no use for that generalization).

What about the 4 that already appear in the doctest?
