Hello,

1. You wrote

```
from math import sqrt
cdef int n = int(sqrt(n_2_p_1-1))
```
  Sage integers do have a method `sqrtrem` that gives you the square root and the rest

```
sage: x = ZZ.random_element(0,10000)
sage: s,r = x.sqrtrem()
sage: x == s**2 + r
True
```
  But as you are using int from Cython you would better use standard C functions

```
from libc.math cimport sqrt, floor
```

2. Why are you testing withtout the option `resolvable=True`

```
if (k % n          or
   ...
   not orthogonal_array(c+1,n,existence=True)):
      return None
```
  while using in the function

```
def switch_OA_srg(c,n):
    ...
    OA = map(tuple, orthogonal_array(c+1,n,resolvable=True))
    ...
```

3. Use better spacings: `int v,int k,int l` -> `int v, int k, int l`.

4. Do you mind moving out the function `switch_OA_srg` into a global function? With such local definition you are generating again and again different Python functions with the very same code

```
sage: f1 = is_switch_OA_srg(290, 136, 63, 64)[0]
sage: f2 = is_switch_OA_srg(290, 136, 63, 64)[0]
sage: f1 is f2
False
```

5. Could you add an example of a SRG that was not available before?

Vincent

you do not test anywhere that graphs you construct in this functions are SRGs with parameters you claim they will have. IMHO such tests must be present.

I do in the doctest that builds the SRG by calling `graphs.strongly_regular_graph` (remember that it checks its output). Before, I had the usual "build the graph + test" doctest, but Vincent wanted me to query the general constructor instead.

So well, this doctest actually builds the graph and tests it. Like the one that was there before it.
