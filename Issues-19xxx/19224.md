Hello,

1. You wrote

```
from math import sqrt
cdef int n = int(sqrt(n_2_p_1-1))
```
  Sage integers do have a method `sqrtrem` that gives you the square root and the rest

```
sage: x = ZZ.random_element(0,10000)
sage: s,r = x.sqrtrem()
sage: x == s**2 + r
True
```
  But as you are using int from Cython you would better use standard C functions

```
from libc.math cimport sqrt, floor
```

2. Why are you testing withtout the option `resolvable=True`

```
if (k % n          or
   ...
   not orthogonal_array(c+1,n,existence=True)):
      return None
```
  while using in the function

```
def switch_OA_srg(c,n):
    ...
    OA = map(tuple, orthogonal_array(c+1,n,resolvable=True))
    ...
```

3. Use better spacings: `int v,int k,int l` -> `int v, int k, int l`.

4. Do you mind moving out the function `switch_OA_srg` into a global function? With such local definition you are generating again and again different Python functions with the very same code

```
sage: f1 = is_switch_OA_srg(290, 136, 63, 64)[0]
sage: f2 = is_switch_OA_srg(290, 136, 63, 64)[0]
sage: f1 is f2
False
```

5. Could you add an example of a SRG that was not available before?

Vincent

What about the 4 that already appear in the doctest?

I do in the doctest that builds the SRG by calling `graphs.strongly_regular_graph` (remember that it checks its output). Before, I had the usual "build the graph + test" doctest, but Vincent wanted me to query the general constructor instead.

So well, this doctest actually builds the graph and tests it. Like the one that was there before it.
