We should add declarations for `mpz_class` and `mpq_class` in the usual place and use them. I also do some trivial Cython cleanup.

Is that fine to remove the `libraries` keyword from `Extension`? Some people complained that it is mandatory under Cygwin. Declaring `# distutils: libraries = gmpxx gmp` in the corresponding `.pyx` file is enough to make them happy?

Yes, it's really the same. However, the `# distutils` thing is better because it's more local (you declare the library in the actual files which need it).
