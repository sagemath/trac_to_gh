Add an iterator, which goes over the elements of a cartesian product of (possible infinite) inputs along the diagonals like the [Cantor pairing function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pairing_function#Cantor_pairing_function).

This was initially factored out from #19048.

If you don't care, I just gave it a try:

```
def product(A,B):
    B = iter(B)
    lb = []
    b_done = False
    for a in A:
        try:
            if not b_done:
                lb.append(B.next())
        except StopIteration:
            b_done = True
        for b in lb:
            yield (a,b)
```

Does the job.

About your 5 copy/paste: if you want to link every function to all others, I think the best is to have an index of methods at the head of the module and add a link toward the module.

In #19048 it does not really (except from aesthetic aspects) matter (but it has to deal with the finite case as well and it would be nice if then all pairs would occur). But I use the same code in some other Sage projects as well (not public (yet)), where it matters: There I need an order my the sums of the indices, which is Cantor.
Thus having this tool in SageMath would be great.

I think having SEEALSO blocks with links pointing directly to related functions/classes is a very useful thing (There have been some discussions on sage-devel about this.); it makes it easy for the user to find functions without a long search (Finding the "correct" function is definitly a problem for Sage users have...)

You got me wrong: I did not ask you to remove the seealso block. I proposed to have a

```
SEEALSO::

    For related functions, refer to the module's documentation
```
with a link of course.

Linking n functions to each other requires n*(n-1) different links. If a function is moved, if a function is added, that requires much more work. Additionally, it possible that somebody *adding* a function may forget to update the others, which will not happen if we have an index of function at the head of the module.

I understood.

> Linking n functions to each other requires n*(n-1) different links. If a function is moved, if a function is added, that requires much more work. Additionally, it possible that somebody *adding* a function may forget to update the others, which will not happen if we have an index of function at the head of the module.


Having these links directly in the `SEEALSO` block of the function helps the user...and this ranks higher to me than what a developer has to add when moving something around (and of course there is `--warn-links` which alerts when something is not where it should be). When adding a new function it is fine that not all `SEEALSO` blocks contain it; maybe only the close related ones. In `sage.misc.mrange` there are just a few functions and all those should IMHO be linked. In larger files I would *not* link all in all, but only build "cliques" of very related functions (but this depends on the functions, of course).

Short answer: iterating over pairs is what we need right now.

Iteration over the product of n iterators will, as far as I can see, always need some recursive algorithm. I do not know whether avoiding iterators internally would make that much of a difference with respect of speed; IMHO it will not make it more readable.

What about replacing `product_cantor_pairing(A, B)` by `product_cantor_pairing([A, B])` and implementing products of `>= 3` iterators by a recursive call to `product_cantor_pairing` (and flattening the results) for the time being?

I perfectly understand.

Is that the canonical order you want for a triple?

for infinite iterators, I suppose that things get somewhat trickier.

Well, I am not really eager for ordering triples anyway.

But I imagine that having 
`product_cantor_pairing([A, B, C])` returning the elements in the same order as
`product_cantor_pairing([product_cantor_pairing([A, B]), C])` (or the other way around, i.e., `product_cantor_pairing([A, product_cantor_pairing([B, C])])`) would make sense.

thanks --- however, using `IntegerListsLex` amounts to a little cheating with respect to the length of this routine `;-)`.

I added three minor commits.

Any particular reason that you return lists instead of tuples?

Good question. `itertools` used to output tuples. But sometimes you want to play with the result (like appending some more elements). For me it is fine either way.

Using lazy list you would also need to catch `IndexError` or so until we use the Cython API I would not go with it.

I will add a trivial commit for handling sharing of slices (very good idea!).

Hi Clemens,

I added a commit on top of yours for returning tuples and accepting a `repeat` argument (with the very same specification as for `itertools.product`).
