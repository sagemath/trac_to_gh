Add an iterator, which goes over the elements of a cartesian product of (possible infinite) inputs along the diagonals like the [Cantor pairing function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pairing_function#Cantor_pairing_function).

This was initially factored out from #19048.

Yeah, I also believed that it should be shorter.

Do you really need this Kantor enumeration, or perhaps you don't care for as long as the product of two infinite iterators works correctly?

If you don't care, I just gave it a try:

```
def product(A,B):
    B = iter(B)
    lb = []
    b_done = False
    for a in A:
        try:
            if not b_done:
                lb.append(B.next())
        except StopIteration:
            b_done = True
        for b in lb:
            yield (a,b)
```

Does the job.

Yeah true, it's really bad. Soooooo I need two lists. Wanted to avoid that.

The question remains, though: is there a reason to insist on Kantor ordering, or would any other order do the job?

In #19048 it does not really (except from aesthetic aspects) matter (but it has to deal with the finite case as well and it would be nice if then all pairs would occur). But I use the same code in some other Sage projects as well (not public (yet)), where it matters: There I need an order my the sums of the indices, which is Cantor.
Thus having this tool in SageMath would be great.

Linking n functions to each other requires n*(n-1) different links. If a function is moved, if a function is added, that requires much more work.

Having these links directly in the `SEEALSO` block of the function helps the user...and this ranks higher to me than what a developer has to add when moving something around (and of course there is `--warn-links` which alerts when something is not where it should be).

Short answer: iterating over pairs is what we need right now.

Iteration over the product of n iterators will, as far as I can see, always need some recursive algorithm. I do not know whether avoiding iterators internally would make that much of a difference with respect of speed; IMHO it will not make it more readable.

What about replacing `product_cantor_pairing(A, B)` by `product_cantor_pairing([A, B])` and implementing products of `>= 3` iterators by a recursive call to `product_cantor_pairing` (and flattening the results) for the time being?

I perfectly understand.

Is that the canonical order you want for a triple?

for infinite iterators, I suppose that things get somewhat trickier.

Well, I am not really eager for ordering triples anyway.

But I imagine that having 
`product_cantor_pairing([A, B, C])` returning the elements in the same order as
`product_cantor_pairing([product_cantor_pairing([A, B]), C])` (or the other way around, i.e., `product_cantor_pairing([A, product_cantor_pairing([B, C])])`) would make sense.

thanks --- however, using `IntegerListsLex` amounts to a little cheating with respect to the length of this routine `;-)`.

I added three minor commits.

Any particular reason that you return lists instead of tuples?

Using lazy list you would also need to catch `IndexError` or so until we use the Cython API I would not go with it.

Hi Clemens,

I added a commit on top of yours for returning tuples and accepting a `repeat` argument (with the very same specification as for `itertools.product`).
