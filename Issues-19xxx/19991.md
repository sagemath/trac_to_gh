Currently, the dimension function for subscheme of products of projective spaces computes the dimension via the dimension of the image of the Segre embedding. This has two drawbacks. One, the Segre embedding is for products of two components. Two, this adds computation complexity.

This dimension can be computed without the embedding.

In algebraic_scheme:
- line 2738 - spacing with ' -1', should be ' - 1'
- line 2759 - spacing around '='
- line 2774 - make exception message lower case
- line 2776 - parentheses around k not needed, can change (k) to k
