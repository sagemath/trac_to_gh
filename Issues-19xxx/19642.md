<a id='comment:7'></a>With the current branch, during the build process I get:

```
In file included from /home/travis/sage/src/build/cythonized/sage/libs/lrcalc/lrcalc.c:286:0:

compilation terminated.
```
So I updated the patch in the new branch. If my change is good, then you can set a positive review.

Also, could you resend the updated patch Jeroen?
