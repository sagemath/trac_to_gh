It seems that upstream has fixed the previously reported bugs, so the old patches and build hacks can be removed.

We add one patch from upstream to fix include paths: `lrcalc` should use `#include "..."` instead of `#include <...>` to include private headers.

<a id='comment:7'>Comment 7:</a>
With the current branch, during the build process I get:

```
In file included from /home/travis/sage/src/build/cythonized/sage/libs/lrcalc/lrcalc.c:286:0:
/home/travis/sage/local/include/lrcalc/schublib.h:4:21: fatal error: hashtab.h: No such file or directory
 #include <hashtab.h>
                     ^
compilation terminated.
```
So I updated the patch in the new branch. If my change is good, then you can set a positive review.

Also, could you resend the updated patch Jeroen?

I understand why I didn't get this error: on my system, there is a `/usr/include/hashtab.h` (from `glibc`, nothing to do with `lrcalc`). So that file must have been included.

Your patch does the right thing.
