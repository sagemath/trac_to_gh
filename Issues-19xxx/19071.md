As opposed to a separate class with different methods. Advantages:
- uniform behaviour with cones
- all polytope methods are available to their faces as well
- less dependence on a particular backend

Since there is now `lattice_polytope.ambient()` returning "the canonical" containing polytope, `amibient_dim` was renamed to `lattice_dim` to avoid confusion. Unfortunately, there is now less consistency in names with generic polyhedra (for which `lattice_dim` makes no sense), but they are very different anyway.

There is some performance penalty associated with the new way of constructing faces (#19077 improves things somewhat), but it is mostly due to constructing face lattice as a poset. So less speed, but more features. Plus "more speed" was available only through the use of batch methods that few people use/are aware of.
