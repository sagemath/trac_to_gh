Found by Nicolas and Anne:

```
sage: t = StandardTableaux([3,2,1]).an_element()
sage: tt = Tableau(t[:])
sage: t == tt
True
sage: hash(t) == hash(tt)
False
```
Objects that compare as equal should have equal hashes.

The branch fixes this by factoring the hash through the underlying list (or, rather, tuple) that represents the tableau. Is that a good idea, or should we preserve something more about the class?

Don't we only want things to equal if they have the same parent?

<a id='comment:7'></a>To be precise, I indeed in favor of:

- Making sure that each object specifies clearly what equality means.

- Having hash be consistent with that definition of equality to
  conform to the Python specifications. Otherwise we can get all sort
  of weird, if not non-deterministic behavior when building sets of
  dictionaries of mixed objects. Note that some people consider that
  this is to be weighted against usability of equality.

- Distinguishing syntactical equality (to be tested by `==`) and
  mathematical equality. See also
  http://wiki.sagemath.org/EqualityCoercion for some comments on the
  topic. Alas in Sage we don't have (yet?) a separate idiom for
  mathematical equality, so we are kind of stuck here.

So now what needs to be decided is what equality should mean for
tableau-like objects.

I would tend to consider that, when `A` and `B` are two parents where
`A` is naturally a subset of `B` (operations on elements don't depend,
or not too much, on whether the elements are considered as in `A` or
as in `B`), and both parents use the same data representation for
their elements (no non-trivial embedding), it can be ok to consider
`a` with `A` as parent or `a` with `B` as parent as equal, if that's
what the user would expect.

With that rule of thumb, that is ok::

```
sage: A = StandardTableaux([2,1])
sage: B = StandardTableaux()
sage: A([[1,2],[3]]) == B([[1,2],[3]])
True
```

But a tableau and a Gelfand Tsetlin Pattern would not be equal (same
data representation, but no canonical subset relation). Nor would I
consider the partition 321 as equal to the permutation 321. I probably
would not want either to consider a skew tableau with trivial inner
shape equal to the corresponding tableau (different data
representations).

Now all of this is a just a preliminary rule of thumb. The most
important is to be well defined, as consistent as possible within a
given context (e.g. tableau-like objects, permutation like objects,
...), and to advertise the specs to the user.

Cheers,
