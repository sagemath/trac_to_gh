On page http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/constructions/number_theory.html one finds:
"Sage uses divisors(n) for the number (usually denoted d(n)) of divisors of n"
Correct is: "Sage uses divisors(n) for the list of divisors of n"

No. The sentence continues: " [...] (so divisors(n) and sigma(n,0) are the same)." Which is clearly nonsense and is to be deleted. 

Something which could be added is:
"The number of divisors of n can be defined as: tau = lambda n: sloane.A000005(n). Then tau(n) and sigma(n,0) are the same."

For this see: http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/combinat/sage/combinat/sloane_functions.html

Yes, this is much better!

"Sage uses divisors(n) for the list of divisors of n, number_of_divisors(n) for the number of divisors of n and sigma(n,k) for the sum of the kth powers of the divisors of n (so number_of_divisors(n) and sigma(n,0) are the same)."

There are several remaining typos:
- remove the space before the comma in `of :math:`n` ,` (first line of this paragraph)
- `number_of_divisor` should be `number_of_divisors` (second line)
- add a space before the parenthesis in `of :math:`n`(so` (fourth line)
Also, if you're willing to make more changes, I think that
- ``k`-th` looks better than ``k^{th}``
- the `:math:` tags are unnecessary because ``...`` does TeX-like formatting by default.
