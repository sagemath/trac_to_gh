OK. Pushed, compiling now.

There are also some `OUTPUTS`, but better to get this closed before it clashes with some other change. And still many docstrings have wrong indentation etc.

Btw, there is also `TESTS` vs `TEST`... There should be something semiautomatic to prevent this. Like trac giving warnings, i.e. developer would be forced to explicitly click "Yes, I know there are >80 char lines. I know and did it intentionally."
