I think I have now managed to correct more of the problems, but the remaining ones seem to
be more difficult.

I propose to stop here, and let the rest for another ticket.

<a id='comment:6'></a>LGTM modulo:

- Why did you strip the leading whitespace in `combinatorial_map.py`?
- In `root_system/weyl_group.py`, could you make it ```self```.
- In `words/paths.py`, you should also change that so that it is `- ``alphabet`` -- ordered...`.
- For `cluster_algebra_quiver/mutation_type.py`, you could also standardize that input block as well?

Thanks.
