We implement functions that allow fast evaluations of integer polynomials with real input:
- `fmpz_poly_evaluation_mpfr(mpfr_t res, const fmpz_poly_t poly, const mpfr_t a)`
- `fmpz_poly_evaluation_mpfi(mpfi_t res, const fmpz_poly_t poly, const mpfi_t a)`
- `ZZX_evaluation_mpfr(mpfr_t res, ZZX_c poly, const mpfr_t a)`
- `ZZX_evaluation_mpfi(mpfi_t res, ZZX_c poly, const mpfi_t a)`

These functions are integrated in the polynomial code within the methods `_eval_mpfr_` and `_eval_mpfi_`.

Follow up: #19841, #19824

Some quick comments:

1. `only do` -> `only does`

2. What's the point of the `mpfr_rnd_t rnd` parameter, given that you don't make any guarantees about exact rounding or rounding direction? Given the code, the only sensible rounding mode is `MPFR_RNDN`.

3. Did you investigate special-casing small degrees (say, degree <= 1)?

4. Both `fmpz_poly_degree(poly)` and `ZZX_deg` return `long`, so the loop variable must be `long` too.

For 2. I just forward the rounding mode to the mpfr functions. Having exact rounding for polynomials might actually be tricky... and also useful. The main reason for having this option is to handle simply polynomial evaluations with different RealField input.

What kind of polynomials did you use? The old code tries to minimize the number of operation in evaluation. For example `(x+1)^3` is infinitely smarter than `1 + x(3 + x(3 + x))`.

I see. I guess that those "random" polynomials are somewhat sparse, so less operations are needed. I will try again with very dense polynomials.

On second thought, what if the polynomial is `x^1000`? Then we will lose a lot with your code.

Indeed. It is possible to implement a less stupid Horner with grouping. In other words `x^6 + 3x^2 + 1` would be `1 + x^2(3 + x^4)`. There would be a small overhead for dense polynomials.

**Attachment:** [degree_20_256.png.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket19822/degree_20_256.png.gz)

I attached files which compare the various possibilities for Horner scheme:

- `eval1`: the current version which is straightforward Horner expansion (red)
- `eval2`: the same but skip addition if the term is 0 (green)
- `eval3`: use `mpfr_pow` (blue)

There are files `degree_{deg}_{prec}.png` for fixed degrees where the number of terms vary and `poly_{deg}_{nb_terms}.png` where the percision vary.

`eval2` seems superior over `eval1`. But `eval3` seems only interesting for very sparse polynomials or very large precision. Indeed, for half dense polynomials (degree=20, nb_terms=13), `eval3` gets better than the other two around prec=2<sup>8</sup>
