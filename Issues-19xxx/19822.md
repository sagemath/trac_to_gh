We implement functions that allow fast evaluations of integer polynomials with real input:
- `fmpz_poly_evaluation_mpfr(mpfr_t res, const fmpz_poly_t poly, const mpfr_t a)`
- `fmpz_poly_evaluation_mpfi(mpfi_t res, const fmpz_poly_t poly, const mpfi_t a)`
- `ZZX_evaluation_mpfr(mpfr_t res, ZZX_c poly, const mpfr_t a)`
- `ZZX_evaluation_mpfi(mpfi_t res, ZZX_c poly, const mpfi_t a)`

These functions are integrated in the polynomial code within the methods `_eval_mpfr_` and `_eval_mpfi_`.

Follow up: #19841, #19824

I know that but it doesn't make sense to do that!

What would be the point of doing every single operation with `MPFR_RNDU`? That doesn't guarantee anything about the rounding of the result (if I take a number obtained with `MPFR_RNDU` and multiply it with -1, it effectively becomes rounded with `MPFR_RNDD`). Since polynomials use a mixture of additions and multiplications, it becomes difficult to avoid this problem.

This makes no sense to me! I would guess that both implementations should scale the same way if the precision is increased. Any clues?


What kind of polynomials did you use? The old code tries to minimize the number of operation in evaluation. For example `(x+1)^3` is infinitely smarter than `1 + x(3 + x(3 + x))`.

I see. I guess that those "random" polynomials are somewhat sparse, so less operations are needed. I will try again with very dense polynomials.

I attached files which compare the various possibilities for Horner scheme:

- `eval1`: the current version which is straightforward Horner expansion (red)
- `eval2`: the same but skip addition if the term is 0 (green)
- `eval3`: use `mpfr_pow` (blue)

There are files `degree_{deg}_{prec}.png` for fixed degrees where the number of terms vary and `poly_{deg}_{nb_terms}.png` where the percision vary.

`eval2` seems superior over `eval1`. But `eval3` seems only interesting for very sparse polynomials or very large precision. Indeed, for half dense polynomials (degree=20, nb_terms=13), `eval3` gets better than the other two around prec=2<sup>8</sup>
