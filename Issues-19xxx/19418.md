I just merged #19309 with the latest beta. Could you do *rebase* this branch on top of it (not merge) so that your commits appear on top of that other branch and are easier to review ?

By the way, I've left a function _L_g_n_params in the source

Helloooooo Dima,

First-pass review:

- Why don't you call `normalise_hadamard` instead of adding a keyword inside of
  `hadamard_matrix_paleyI` (without changing `hadamard_matrix_paleyII`)? Those
  two functions are not directly available to the users, who are meant to call
  `hadamard_matrix` directly.

- `is_hadamard_martrix` -- could you move 'skew=False' to before 'verbose=False'
  ? Usually the verbosity/check flags are the last ones to appear as they do not
  change the behaviour of the functon.

- Call `is_skew_symmetric` instead of doing it yourself. In theory you shouldn't
  have to create two copies of the matrix in memory in order to check that.

- `zero_position=1` -- you have to write documentation for private functions
  too. Does [the paraeter that you add] appear in the lemma cited in the
  docstring?

- `zero_position=1` -- if you meant `True`, write `True`.

- `_circulant_matrix` -- if it does not exist yet, this constructor should be
  added in the matrix/ code and be available through `matrix.<tab>`

- `mod(j-i,n)` is `(j-i)%n`. One day you will have to accept that you write
  Python code.

- Instead of a `_GS_skew_hadamard` function that encodes 4 matrices, why don't
  you reserve cases `if n == 36' (and others) in the main function
  `skew_hadamard_matrix`? That would also solve the problem that this function
  has no documentation whatsoever.

- 'and' (see wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#AND) is
  a useful operator in computer science. E.g.:

```
+    if M is None: # try Williamson-Goethals-Seidel construction
+        if _GS_skew_hadamard(n, existence=True):
```
  becomes

```
+    if M is None and_GS_skew_hadamard(n, existence=True):
```

- `switch_skewhad_pow2` -- please respect the current standard for the names in
  `graphs.<tab>`. Upper case, no underscore, ends with `Graph`. Actually, it
  could be named 'SwitchSkewhadGraph` and only mention the `pow2` part in the
  docstring.

- `graphs.Pseudo_L_2n_4n_m_1`? Seriously? If you cannot give it a clear and
  meaningful name easily, then take it as a sign that this function should not
  be exposed to the users directly.

- `_L_g_n_params` -- yes, please remove this function if you do not use it.

`normalize_hadamard` does not do what I need; I need a different type of normalization, in fact, where the matrix has the 1st row consisting of 1s, and still H+H.T==2*I, 
i.e. the 1st column of H is all -1 (with exception of the top left entry)

Should I perhaps introduce `skew_normalize_hadamard`, 
that can only be applied to skew Hadamard matrices?
(I'd have uses for it in graph constructions, too)

right. I forgot that keyword args can be positional, too...

OK

I'd rather add documentation, thanks for reminding. 
I find `skew_hadamard_matrix` already hard to read, and
it would positively turn ugly if I start adding that explicit data for matrices there.

oops - there is an extra `if` there that should go...

How about we have a `PseudoLatinSquaresGraph(m,n)` or `PseudoOrthogonalArrayBlockGraph(m,n)` ? (I'd prefer the former name; or maybe we can have both?)

It would include `Pseudo_L_2n_4n_m_1` and `OrthogonalArrayBlockGraph` as subcases.
(Perhaps there are more subcases, in fact, but we don't have to worry about it now).

sure.

Sounds right. Then you can have a proper documentation and stuff. If you plan to use it elsewhere that's even better.

Okayokay.

+1 to the former. With a description of what it is in its doc, if possible `^^;`

oops, this won't fly. The problem is that once a skew-Hadamard matrix was de-skewed (e.g. by the usual normalization procedure, producing the 1st row and column of 1s),
there is no general way known to make it skew again. 
(and in fact not every Hadamard matrix can be made skew, AFAIK).

That is, I have to disable normalization right at the point it is done in `hadamard_matrix_paleyI`. (writing an ad hoc code to undo this specific normalization seems silly).

this won't fly either, as a skew Hadamard matrix H is not skew-symmetric.
What is skew-symmetric is the matrix H-I, so it has to be created anyway

(by the way, this explains why making a Hadamard matrix skew is not too obvious; indeed,
the trick mentioned in the docs of `is_skew_symmetrizable` would only work if H had
constant diagonal.)

I cannot say that I understand what you have in mind, but as long as what happens is made clear in the documentation I guess that it is okay.

> this won't fly either, as a skew Hadamard matrix H is not skew-symmetric.

Then create H-I, but don't create -S nor S.T.

OK, sure, I will make it catch `NoneType`

I want to implement something like this:

```
    def f(vector v):
         stuff...

    def f(list v, sparse=False):
         stuff...
```
and this is what my code does.

The user-provided value of sparse for vector `v` is present in `v` already.
If the user wants to make it explicit, he can call the function with the
parameter `vector(v, sparse=whatever)` instead of just `v`

Usually the explicit value overrides the implicit value:

```
sage: Graph(graphs.PetersenGraph())._backend
<type 'sage.graphs.base.sparse_graph.SparseGraphBackend'>
sage: Graph(graphs.PetersenGraph(),sparse=False)._backend
<type 'sage.graphs.base.dense_graph.DenseGraphBackend'>
```

It is not the case in your code.

Helloooooooooo Dima,

Here is another pass:

- I don't think that you need to import functions at the top of every single
  '::' block. If you imported them in a previous doctest of the same function
  they are usually around. I say 'usually' because I don't think I read that
  anywhere, but it just works. If the order in which doctests are run can be
  'random', I think that it just shuffles the functions and not the doctests
  inside of a function.

- docstring of zero_position: bad alignment of 'place it first'. Misses one
  space.

- Same line: the sentence is not complete -- what about adding 'When it' at its
  beginning?

- You did not doctest your new flag. Also, the code *looks* wrong.

- Docstring of `williamson_goethals_seidel_skew_hadamard_matrix`. Things seem to
  miss from the first sentence of the paragraph. Or it's me being sick again.
  P.S.: syntactically, a ')' is missing at least.

- Same function. The following doc should be in the function that actually
  returns those matrices:

  ```
  +    Matrices for `n=36` and `52` are given in [GS70s]_. Matrices for `n=92` are given
  +    in [Wall71]_.
  ```

- `_GS_skew_hadamard` -- the name of that function is a bit too vague. What
  about `GS_skew_hadamard_smallcases`? You don't necessarily need to make it
  private, by the way. It lives in a module and does not appear in the global
  namespace, so only the interested guys will find it. And it's not technically
  complicated to use, the input/output is well defined and reliable. It can't be
  misused.

- private functions need doctests too. 'cdef' is the only situation in which you
  don't need them.

- `def pmtoZ(s):` could be defined in the only 'if' that requires it (not very
  important).

- docstring of `skew_hadamard_matrix` -- in the block of doc about 'existence',
  one reads 'but that design does not exist'. Could you replace 'design' by
  'matrix'?

- I don't see why the following doctest has a 'long' flag

  ```
  sage: skew_hadamard_matrix(784,existence=True) # long time
  ```
  If you actually built the matrix, however, that would be correct.

- I don't think that `check=False` is useful when `existence=True`

  ```
  skew_hadamard_matrix(n//2,existence=True, check=False)
  ```

- In the `n%8==0` case you implement the product construction of skew hadamard
  matrices with a 2x2 matrix only. Is there a reason to that?

- `if _GS_skew_hadamard(n, existence=True)` -- it hardly matters, but it would
  be 'cleaner' to call this (quick) function before checking the more
  complicated (recursive) constructions.

- Shouldn't you also check that the matrix is 'skew-normalized', as we do with
  the regular normalization?

  ```
  +    if skew_normalize:
  +        dd = diagonal_matrix(M[0])
  +        M = dd*M*dd
  +    if check:
  +        assert is_hadamard_matrix(M, normalized=False, skew=True)
  ```

- If you are too humble to do it yourself, I will change that to 'Return the
  Pasechnik graph of order n' `:-)`

  ```
  +    Pseudo-`OA(2n-1,4n-1)`-graph from a skew Hadamard matrix of order `4n`
  ```

- Please add your new graphs to the `graphs.<tab>` constructor.

Nathann

huh? I have there

```
    elif n % 8 == 0:
        if skew_hadamard_matrix(n//2,existence=True, check=False):
            if existence:
                return true()

            M = block_matrix([[H,H], [-H.T,H.T]])

        else: # try Williamson construction
            for d in divisors(n)[2:-2]: # skip 1, 2, n/2, and n
             ... more stuff
```
so I first check if I can multiply with 2x2 matrix, and if not, I `try Williamson construction`.

well, actually in this case the code is not doing what is advertised; without my flag the matrix for n=4k-1 is not symmetric w.r.t. the anti-diagonal; the submatrix obtained by removal of the 1st row and the 1st column is  symmetric w.r.t. the anti-diagonal.
I changed the doc accordingly.

oops - forgot about it. Tonight I'll have more time to look at it.

The last commit fixes the n=816 bug (--facepalm--) -  thanks for the example. I checked now the values of n up to 1200, they appears to work fine...

Thanks! By the way, _check_database() now says for me:

```
...
Sage can build a (1024, 462, 206, 210), Brouwer's database cannot
Sage can build a (1024, 561, 308, 306), Brouwer's database cannot

In Andries Brouwer's database:
- 448 impossible entries
- 2950 undecided entries
- 1140 realizable entries (Sage misses 36 of them)
```
On the other hand the graphs above can be found in http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/graphs/srg/srgtab1001-1050.html
Does it mean that Sage's copy of the DB needs an update?

OK, so should I next take out Mathon's v=45?

> Does it mean that Sage's copy of the DB needs an update?

Yes. We gave him info to update his database but we didn't update our copy. By the way, the difference between our copy and his can be seen as 'one of the side-effects' of the work we have been doing. We may need that info.

Take as many as you can out. I don't think that there is any left that I can implement: those that I thought manageable were apparently wrong constructions, and the authors 'play dead'.
