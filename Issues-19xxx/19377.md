sage: v = random_vector(QQ, 5, sparse=True)
sage: w = random_vector(QQ, 5, sparse=False)
sage: v.dot_product(w)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred in Sage.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* component of Sage has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off().
Sage will now terminate.

<a id='comment:1'></a>I'm pretty sure the problem is this line in the sparse `_dot_product_coerce_`:

```
cdef dict e = (<FreeModuleElement_generic_sparse>right)._entries
```
which assumes the right vector is a sparse vector. I will fix this and post shortly.
