Currently, the input `i` for the method `get_vacancy_number` returns the vacancy number for the `i`th row. This prohibits the user from calculating vacancy numbers p<sub>k</sub><sup>(a)</sup>. This ticket makes the following changes:

- the internal and public behavior;
- changes `get_vacancy_number` to `vacancy_number`;
- removes the `get_vacancy_numbers` method.

This is a backwards incompatible change.

Besides the ticket number, the numbering of the rigged partitions seems to be off 

```
sage: RC = RiggedConfigurations(['D',8,1],[[8,1],[6,3]])
sage: H = RC.module_generators
sage: rc = H[34]
sage: rc

I guess the indexing for `a` starts at 0 rather than `1`. But then the documentation is misleading since it is not the math labeling. Also, wouldn't it be useful to be able to do

```
rc.vacancy_number(a,i)
```

Best,
