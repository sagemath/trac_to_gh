From another ticket: "Maybe implement up-down posets generally, and then have `zigzag_poset(n)` as an alias for `updown_poset(1,n)` ? Zig-zag poset is something that people might be interested in without necessarily knowing the generalized notion of up-down posets."

At least the docstring must mention "zigzag" and "fence" so that they will be found by search. (Compare to my addition about "weak order" etc. to `is_incomparable_chain_free`.

Also nothing prevents the index to have

```

This was not marked as needs_review, but I'll comment anyway.

- Parameter checking is missing. Compare to `DiamondPoset`. Might be easier to test like `if not n in NN or n<...`.
- `UpDownPoset(m,n)` should be `UpDownPoset(m, n)`.
- "fence" should be said in the documentation for googlers.
- `UpDownPoset` has unnecessary empty lines.
- Standard example should be explained, i.e. to tell what it is.

Should it be said that for `n >= 4` the standard example is only poset with dimension `n` and `n` elements? Maybe no. (It is not true for `n=3`.) Cases `n=1` and `n=2` are special - should them just be rejected as a parameter?

What is best way to give parameters to `UpDownPoset`? To give the number of elements or to give the number of minimal elements, or number of maximal elements? I suppose that most users don't want `UpDownPoset(50, 6)` or similar, where the fence is kind of uncomplete.

Should every function have a `facade`-argument? Does not bother me, and I'm not going to use non-facade posets, but it is kind on inconsistent that some have it.

I don't think we should reject n=1,2 for the standard example. Just because they're simple and can more easily be described in other ways doesn't mean the definition doesn't make sense and should raise an error.

Sadly, "standard example" is the accepted terminology. I don't know what the original source would be, but there are tons of papers that use the term, and it's also mentioned on the Wikipedia page for Order-Dimension. Suggestions for what to use?

For UpDownPoset, I just followed the convention that Wikipedia had (although I think I reversed up steps and down steps...there's a reason I didn't mark this for review yet). I don't see any real reason to exclude "kind of incomplete" fences. It just makes the code more complicated, and limits what kind of posets the user can create. Plus I'm not even sure exactly how one would define an "incomplete" fence.

The more I think about it, the more I realize the code should be a little more general to allow more cases. For example, we always start with an up step...but what if we want a fence starting with a down step? What if instead of wanting one down-step after every m up-steps, we want k down-steps after every m up-steps?

I think what I really want is a method where you put in `n` and a subset `D` of `[n-1]`, and it creates the poset on  where `i>i+1` if `i in D` and `i<i+1` otherwise. The motivation being linear extensions of these posets are in bijection with permutations that have descent set `D` (and the fence example corresponds to alternating permutations). We could still have an UpDownPoset method that does roughly what the code currently does to match what Wikipedia has as the definition of those posets, but it would really just construct an appropriate `D` based on the input and use the more general method.

Since all of poset examples isn't consistent with including `facade` options, I'll make another ticket that focuses just on making `poset_examples.py` consistent.

Replying to [@kevindilks](#comment%3A7):

> I don't think we should reject n=1,2 for the standard example. Just because they're simple and can more easily be described in other ways doesn't mean the definition doesn't make sense and should raise an error.

Hmm... OK. How about `n=0`? I guess that usually the user has made a mistake if he or she ask for Standar example of '2*2' elements. But it is easily seen error.

> The more I think about it, the more I realize the code should be a little more general to allow more cases. For example, we always start with an up step...but what if we want a fence starting with a down step? What if instead of wanting one down-step after every m up-steps, we want k down-steps after every m up-steps?

Hmmm number two... Will interface be too complicated? There are tons of different posets that the user could want to get easily. Some of them are trivial to make by hand, like `DiamondPoset`, other not so easy like `TamariLattice`. But I wait to see the code.

(I'll be mostly offline for some time. Looking reindeers from kitchen's window...)

Computing dimension of `StandardExample(6)` will take about forever, if the user has no MILP solver. Hence it is not good test, at least without `# optional` tag.

"Returns" should be "Return" in one-line description.
