`CyclotomicField(k).zeta()` is documented as

```
        -  ``n`` - integer (default: None, returns element of
           maximal order)
```
However, this is not actually the reality:

```
sage: C = CyclotomicField(5)
sage: C.zeta().multiplicative_order()  # NOT of maximal order!
5
sage: C.zeta(10).multiplicative_order()
10
```

This branch will change `zeta()` to be consistent with what was documented. It will also make it consistent with `zeta_order()`, such that `C.zeta().multiplicative_order()` is equal to `C.zeta_order()`.

I don't think this is quite ready.

It would be reasonable to expect that `C.primitive_root_of_unity()` and `C.zeta()` gave the same answer.  But

```
sage: C = CyclotomicField(5)
sage: C.primitive_root_of_unity(), C.zeta()
(-zeta5, -zeta5^3)
```

The new error message

```
sage: C.zeta(4)
...
ValueError: 4 does not divide order of generator (10)
```
is somewhat misleading, since

```
sage: C.gen().multiplicative_order()
5
```
The error message for generic fields is better:

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^3 - 5)
sage: K.zeta(3)
...
ValueError: There are no 3rd roots of unity in self.
```
and negative arguments are handled differently:

```
sage: C.zeta(-2)
-1
sage: K.zeta(-2)
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
ValueError: n (=-2) must be positive
```
But there is incompatibility with generic fields, for which n=2 is the default (surely a mistake):

```
sage: K = NumberField(x^2 - x + 1, 'a')
sage: C = CyclotomicField(6)
sage: K.zeta(), C.zeta()
(-1, zeta6)
sage: C.is_isomorphic(K)
True
```

Maybe reasonable, but there are good reasons why this is not the case:

1. `C.zeta()` is a very fast, almost trivial operation because it's specialized for cyclotomic fields.

2. `C.primitive_root_of_unity()` uses a computation in PARI. This must be so, in order to be consistent with other uses of the PARI unit group.

So neither making `zeta` an alias of `primitive_root_of_unity` nor making `primitive_root_of_unity` an alias of `zeta` looks like a good idea.

It's not a *new* error message, only a rephrasing of the old message. But I see your point.
