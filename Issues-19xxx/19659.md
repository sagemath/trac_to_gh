I suggest adding a function that decomposes a poset "vertically", i.e. has same relationship to `ordinal_sum()` as `connected_components()` has to `disjoint_union()`. This ticket contains code for the "backend", i.e. to `hasse_diagram.py`.

I am not sure about the name. Maybe `ordinal_decomposition`. Or maybe it could be `ordinal_components` or `vertical_components`.

Bonus question: What should be the name for inverse function of `ordinal_product()`?

-    r"""
-    Return the ordinal decomposition of the poset.
-    
-    This function is kind of inverse to ordinal_sum(). Ordinal
-    decomposition of a poset `P` is the list of posets
-    `P_1, \ldots, P_n` so that `P` is ordinal decomposition of them.
-
-    OUTPUT:
-        
-    List of numbers `e_1, \ldots, e_n`
-    so that `P_1` is subposet containing `0, \ldots, e_1`,
-    `P_2` is subposet containing `e_1+1, \ldots, e_2` and so on.
-   
-    ALGORITHM::
-        
-        Suppose that poset `P` is the ordinal sum of posets `L` and
-        `U`. Then `P` contains maximal antichains `l` and `u` such that
-        every element of `u` covers exactly every element of `l` and
-        every element of `l` is covered by exactly every element of `u`; they
-        correspond to maximal elements of `L` and minimal elements
-        of `U`.
-
-        We know that the Hasse diagram is a topologically sorted DAG,
-        starting numbering from zero. Hence, if `L` has `n` elements, 
-        then `l` contains element `n-1` and `u` contains element
-        `n`.
-
-        We keep track of the maximal elements of subposet induced
-        by elements 0..e and minimal elements of subposet induced
-        by elements e+1..n, incrementing e one by one. Then we just
-        check if they can be `l` and `u` in previous description.

Other possibility would be `posets.py`. But then recursive `ordinal_decomposition`-`connected_components` would unnecessarily create intermediate posets instead of `HasseDiagram`s. It is slower.

And series-parallel decomposition is nothing more than just trying "ordinal and parallel decomposition" until there is nothing that can be done.

Why do you insist on having it return a Hasse Diagram? If you want the decomposition feature without having to build posets, then you could have a 'as_posets=True` optional argument in the Poset method, which would either return a list of posets or return a partition of the elements.

This is true. But then, what's wrong with having functions at `hasse_diagram.py`?

You do not need to build posets even though you are a Poset method. Because you can access `_hasse_diagram` directly, and because there is no constraint whastoever on the type of what you should return. You can have optional arguments to return the result as whatever you want: posets, digraphs, partitions...

And if the Poset constructor was even remotely sensible you would have no reason to *fear* the time loss in the poset constructor.

Hasse diagram is a poset with some constraints... I can change that docstring.

But the question remains: What is the meaning of `hasse_diagram.py`? Whole poset class could be implemented with just a digraph as one member variable. But then I guess we would have more internal functions starting with `_`. Or more functions returning something actually only useful for internal use.

An example: check (broken!) parameter `partial` at `maximal_chains`. It is needed for `order_complex`. I think that the whole concept of "partial maximal chain" is odd and should be removed. It could have placed in `hasse_diagrams.py`, which is meant for internal implementation. (Btw, see #18944 - my suggestion to drop `partial`-option was rejected.)

I think that I can generate something like all posets of size 7 in the same time as all Hasse diagrams of size 8. So it really loses some cpu time to make posets.

What we have now is Poset.X *and* HassDiagram.X.

I am tired to find ways to not call the constructor because it does things you never asked it to do.

Is this any more clear? I think that if the code needs clarification, first step would be adding comments. But at least the basic idea is quite clearly said in docstring.

If I do

```
all(self.degree_out(l) == len(upper) for l in lower)
```

then `len(upper)` will be called many times.

I can change that, if you want. But actually the code at one function level can always be optimized later. Real question is how to arrange this code. I think that it is fruitless to think about `posets.py` vs. `hasse_diagram.py` in context of one specific function. If we want to change it, then we would need to think those files (and `lattices.py`) as a whole.

So actually I want an answer to two questions: 1) Is Sage better with or without this patch? 2) Is there some trivial things that would make this patch better? Those two are my criteria for giving a positive review.

`break-else` is really a python special feature. Quite nice sometimes with this kind on mathematical code.

Not only that. Earlier in this ticket you said

>> Perhaps something like "whatever was once useful to one must be a public method". In the case of very very specific functions, sometimes hard to document properly, I do not believe that it is a good choice.


I think that "visible" poset functions, i.e. those not starting with `_`, should give meaningful set of operations to do with posets. It does not always directly correspond with good structure for internal functions. So should I add a `_`-function to `posets.py` or add a strange option for `ordinal_decomposition` to be used just for series-parallel decomposition? Both options sounds strange, as the already have "internal" class.

I do not understand a word of what you are saying. Please, I try to make each of my sentences accurate to be sure that I do not get misunderstood, and as it is I can't get a straight answer. I assure you that I spend *minutes* over each of my comments.

I am trying to understand, as I asked in [comment:30], if you need HasseDiagram only because of the slow Poset constructor or if there is another reason. You told me in [comment:35] that you wanted to be able to return something which is *not* a poset, and I said in [comment:36] that you could do so with Poset only. Now the two sentences to which I am replying right now say again that what you want to avoid is the Poset constructor.

Could you confirm that the cost of the Poset constructor is the only thing that bothers you, or else tell me what exactly is the problem? At the moment, I am convinced that the only reason for which you implement everything twice is because you want to avoid building posets. Tell me if I am wrong.

I just went through your code and made small modifications, some to the code some to the doc. Most of the time by removing/shortening things. You are of course welcome to discuss any character of it. Also, you sometimes forget articles 'a/an': I am no expert in english but sometimes they really are necessary to the sentence.

My modifications have been pushed to public/19659.

Could you point me toward a book/paper that uses this "ordinal components" terminology?

Thanks,

As I write in the description: I am not sure about the name.

"On the number of distributive lattices" by Marcel Erné, Jobst Heitzig and Jürgen Reinhold (http://www.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/EMIS/journals/EJC/Volume_9/PDF/v9i1r24.pdf) uses "vertical decomposition". I choose the name to be parallel to `connected_components()`.

Okay okay. I don't trust myself when it comes to Posets, so let's ask.

Frédéric? Jori implemented here a function that decomposes a poset P into components P1,...,P_k such that P is the ordinal sum of the Pi. We are not sure which name should be picked for it, and right now the branch uses the name `ordinal_components`. What do you think of it?

I would suggest 'is_ordinal_sum', with boolean output, with a certificate option to see
a decomposition.

Another possibility would be 'ordinal_sum_decomposition'.

'ordinal_components' is ambiguous because there exists also 'ordinal product' (not yet in sage maybe), besides ordinal sum.

EDIT: maybe 'ordinal_summands' would be ok

Some thoughts, not a clear opinion yet:

We do have `ordinal_product` already. An "inverse function" of if would be `ordinal_factors`, I think. Compare to "factoring (undirected) graphs" (done be Nathann IIRC).

`certificate=True` sounds natural to for example `dimension`: there is not **the** set of realizers, just bunch of minimal sets and one of them is returned. For this function we do have exact "components", "parts" or something like that.

There is now `is_connected` and `conneced_components`. It would be orthogonal design to have two functions for this one also.

This should really be discussed on sage-devel. Someone has originally implemented this, and I guess he/she have had a reason for this.

I am sure that you know "a"/"an"/"the" better than I do; my native language belongs to Uralic languages family. I just added commas to math blocks so that they are uniform.

Your code is, as usual, better than mine.

If I am right, now we just needs to decide the name.

Hello,

> This should really be discussed on sage-devel. Someone has originally implemented this, and I guess he/she have had a reason for this.


True, but it would be a mistake to value a reason that we do not know more than those we figured out ourselves. Maybe something smart may come from sage-devel indeed, though. I hope that we will hear something different from the frequent refusal to change things 'on principle'.

> If I am right, now we just needs to decide the name.


Yep. I concur with Frédéric's proposal of a `is_ordinal_sum` with an optional certificate. The same is done differently for `is_connected/connected_components`, but there at least there is no doubt on which terminology should be used. Perhaps it's worth asking on sage-devel too if you prefer.

Depends on what *you* plan to use it for. `.is_ordinal_sum(as_posets=True)` or `.is_ordinal_sum(as_partition=True)` would work for me, and either return an empty list (when it is not) or return a list of whatever is requested.

What do you want us to compare in the naming of this function and the content of #19123?

It could be a building block for series-parallel decomposition.
