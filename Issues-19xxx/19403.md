What do you mean with "bounds on..."?

Are you referring to the inexact rounding? Because then essentially every function returning a real number should be amended (e.g. for plain complex numbers, `abs(a)` isn't *really* the absolutely value, it's the real number which gives the best possible approximation to the actual absolute value). I think such things are always implicit when working with floating-point approximations and don't need to be mentioned in the documentation.

Yes, I'm referring to the rounding. And I agree that it is implicit when working with real numbers, but here we are working with intervals, and the corresponding function in the real case does return exact results.

But the `OUTPUT` block clearly states that a real number (with specific rounding) is returned. I personally think that's clear enough.

If you really insist, let me know how I should rephrase the documentation.
