What do you mean with "bounds on..."?

Are you referring to the inexact rounding? Because then essentially every function returning a real number should be amended (e.g. for plain complex numbers, `abs(a)` isn't *really* the absolutely value, it's the real number which gives the best possible approximation to the actual absolute value). I think such things are always implicit when working with floating-point approximations and don't need to be mentioned in the documentation.

But the `OUTPUT` block clearly states that a real number (with specific rounding) is returned. I personally think that's clear enough.

If you really insist, let me know how I should rephrase the documentation.
