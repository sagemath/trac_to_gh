I also did some crude benchmarks and `arb` seems pretty close to `flint`, certainly faster than `pari` or `bernmm`. I will do some finer benchmarks later today.

Really? I also did some crude benchmarks and `arb` seems pretty close to `flint`, certainly faster than `pari` or `bernmm`. I will do some finer benchmarks later today. And we should probably get rid of the `bernmm` algorithm since we have 3 faster implementations in Sage now.
