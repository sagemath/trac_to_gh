Got `AssertionError` when constructing `Polyhedron` from an H-representation that has unusual base_ring and is infeasible,

```
sage: Polyhedron(ieqs=[(-sqrt(2),1,1),(0,-1,-1)])
AssertionError
sage: Polyhedron(ieqs=[(-sqrt(2),1,1),(0,-1,-1)], base_ring=AA)
AssertionError
```
whereas the following works well.

```
sage: Polyhedron(ieqs=[(-1.414,1,1),(0,-1,-1)])
The empty polyhedron in RDF^2
sage: Polyhedron(ieqs=[(sqrt(2),1,1),(0,-1,-1)])
```
