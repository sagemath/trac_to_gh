Add an `edges()` method to intervals (elements of `RIF` and `CIF`).

1. For complex intervals, return the 4 edges of the rectangular interval as intervals.
2. For real intervals, return the endpoints as single-point intervals.

For `CIF`, we also add an `endpoints()` method returning the 4 corners of the interval.

In other words, if the given interval lives in some N-dimensional space, then:
1. `edges()` returns the (N-1)-dimensional faces as intervals.
2. `endpoints()` returns the 0-dimensional faces as points.

The rationale is the following: suppose you need 2 endpoints defining the interval (i.e. such that the union is the whole interval). In that case, those endpoints are `interval.endpoints()[:2]` both in the real and complex case.

For the `edges()` method, I put pairs of opposing edges next to each other, because an application might want to process such pairs of opposing edges. The fact that the `endpoints()` method also returns pairs of opposing endpoints is consistent with that.

"needed" is always very subjective. I mean, is Sage (the program as a whole) "needed"?

The main motivation is to allow more easily code which can run unchanged for both `RIF` and `CIF`. Depending on the application, that would be either `edges()` or `endpoints()` which happen to coincide for `RIF` but not for `CIF`.

I understand that you need an implementation in both `RIF` and `CIF`. I do not understand why you need two methods. My comment concerned the fact that `edges` can easily be deduced from `endpoints`.

It's not really obvious to me how can one easily construct `edges` given `endpoints`.

But even then, there is very little harm in having redundant methods. For `CIF`, I think that both `endpoints` and `edges` are useful. Since I want something consistent for `RIF` and `CIF`, I also added `edges` to `RIF`.
