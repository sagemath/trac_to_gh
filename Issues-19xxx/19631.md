The following should work:

```
sage: from sage.monoids.automatic_semigroup import AutomaticSemigroup
sage: R = IntegerModRing(101)
sage: M = AutomaticSemigroup(Family({1: R(3), 2: R(5)}), one=R.one())


sage: sage: sage: e = M.from_reduced_word([1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2])
sage: e.reduced_word()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

AttributeError: 'AutomaticMonoid_with_category.element_class' object has no attribute 'construct'
```
I'm uploading a fix.

This is done by the call to `self.parent().construct(up_to=self)`:

```
sage: sage: from sage.monoids.automatic_semigroup import AutomaticSemigroup
sage: sage: R = IntegerModRing(101)
sage: sage: M = AutomaticSemigroup(Family({1: R(3), 2: R(5)}), one=R.one())
sage: sage: e = M.from_reduced_word([1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2])
sage: e
42
sage: e.__dict__
{'_reduced_word': None}
sage: e.reduced_word()
[1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2]
sage: e.__dict__
{'_cache__transition': {},
 '_reduced_word': [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2],
 'transition': Cached version of <function transition at 0x7f91a1a87a28>}
```
