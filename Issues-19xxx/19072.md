It turned out I needed to show a student something using one of the files I run using SageTeX and it turned out okay.  But I didn't move anything.  Are you referring to https://github.com/dandrake/sagetex/commit/fddc5c1cb5760905c59d8fbf7a84df066c3e3436 which doesn't appear to be in 3.0?

The new package will install in SAGE_ROOT/local/share/texmf/tex/latex/sagetex/

<a id='comment:31'></a>the new path can be seen here: https://github.com/dandrake/sagetex/blob/master/setup.py#L13

I tried the following - take the example.tex, put it somewhere outside the Sage tree, and run it through latex/sage/latex.
And I was getting Sagetex version mismatch until I removed the old directory SAGE_ROOT/local/share/texmf/tex/generic/

The example.log will show you which sagetex version is being loaded.

<a id='comment:32'></a>Okay, finally back to this.  I didn't get the mismatch but I did get #18969.  In fact, I seem to still get that problem no matter what I do.  Likely because of this:

```
(/Users/.../Library/texmf/tex/generic/sagetex/sagetex.sty
Package: sagetex 2012/01/16 v2.3.3-69dcb0eb93de embedding Sage into LaTeX docum

```
I had to do a lot of work to completely remove that from my system, I'm not sure why (maybe having several terminals open at once messed something up, though I've never had that happen before).

Then I finally get the version mismatch, but now the opposite one you get, I think, which is that I am finally generating using the right SageTeX but not the right Sage.

```
sagetex.VersionError: versions of .sty and .py files do not match.
example.sagetex.sage was generated by sagetex.sty version "2015/08/26 v3.0-92d9f7a", but
is being processed by sagetex.py version "2012/01/16 v2.3.3-69dcb0eb93de".
Please make sure that TeX is using the sagetex.sty
from your current version of Sage; see
http://www.sagemath.org/doc/installation/sagetex.html.
```
By the way, this message you referring to being outdated is fixed in upstream master but not in 3.0, I believe - see comment:28.

Anyway, it seems that I have

```

this is old version, an up to date version of Sage should have v.2.3.4.

it's not "extra", it's the right one; however, it must be the same as in `local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage`. This is because `local/lib/python` is a symbolic link to `local/lib/python2.7`.
(or at least it should be - if it is not then your installation must be seriously
broken, and `make distclean` is the only way out, IMHO...)

You can see what `sage -f sagetex` is doing by inspecting `logs/pkgs/sagetex-*`.
For me, I see the following lines there:

```
copying build/lib/sagetex.py -> <mysageroot>/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages
byte-compiling <mysageroot>/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sagetex.py to sagetex.pyc
```

Yes yes, I just was too lazy to type the 2.7 when tab-completing.   However,

```
__version__ = """
  [2012/01/16 v2.3.3-69dcb0eb93de embedding Sage into LaTeX documents]
""".strip()
```
so indeed I still have 2.3.3 in there and not 2.3.4, which I don't understand.

<a id='comment:41'></a>> I'll try reproducing this on an OSX system. Can you say how you installed this instance of Sage in the 1st place?

That's a good question.  Maybe git clone?  Or tarball?  My `upstream/` goes back pretty far, e.g. to pynac-0.3.0.tar.bz2.  Note above though it only has the site-packages for `sage-xyz` from 7.0 on, which makes sense because I think the build system changed then and so maybe I had to do `make distclean` at that point.

Tomorrow I can try to build a previous version (say, 7.1) from scratch and then try this branch and hopefully it will work okay.

> The fact that you still have v2.3.3 probably means that already update to v2.3.4 silently failed for you.


I agree.  But since I probably never installed the 'right' new style file it didn't cause trouble before.

I just tried on OSX and latest beta, and installation works. This means that your install is broken, and needs another `make distclean`...
