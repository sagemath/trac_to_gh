There is a lot of duplicate code in the `CachedFunction` and `WeakCachedFunction` types. Several methods are literally copied, with the only difference that `CachedFunction` uses `<dict>self.cache` while `WeakCachedFunction` uses `self.cache`.

The speed gain of using `<dict>self.cache` instead of `self.cache` is so tiny that it doesn't justify the code duplication. In the light of future optimizations to `CachedFunction`, it is better to remove this duplicate code.

The description is not quite clear to me, so I am not sure what to look at in the code. What exactly were the purposes of two classes, which one should be gone, and should the class be gone eventually or just some methods?

No, the class should not be gone. The two classes are `CachedFunction` and `WeakCachedFunction` which are exactly the same except for the type of `self.cache`. The two classes are both useful.
