```
In order to skip too long doctests we introduce time indications to `long time` flag like

```
sage: (2**2000 + 31).is_prime()  # long time: 1h
```
The allowed units are: `s` (seconds), `m` (minutes), `h` (hours), `d` (days).

We also:
- modify the `--long` option of `sage -t` to accept an arguemnt such as in

```
$ sage -t --long 1m
$ sage -t --long 3
```
  In the first example, doctest flagged with a time > 1min will be skipped and in the second case, doctest flagged with a time > 3sec will be skipped. The default is set to 10secs.
- document this enhanced `long time` option in the manual

That is what I wanted but I do not know how to make an option that at the same time is valid with or without a value. I don't think that is even possible since the following is a valid syntax

```
sage -t --maxtime 1s test.py
```
In the above example, you can not distinguish between the value of your option and an argument of the command line.

The only way would be to always wait for an argument to `--long`. What do you think?

What is the default behaviour of `--long` ? Run *all* long tests while ignoring their length? Or will `--long` become an alias for `--long 2s` or something?

The patch says "If set to `True` it will  be set to 10 seconds."

Btw, I think that http://sage.sis.uta.fi/documentation/developer/doctesting.html#testing-a-module should contain a link 
to http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#special-markup-to-influence-tests , or maybe the whole paragraph should be moved?
