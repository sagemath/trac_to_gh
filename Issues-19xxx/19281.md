```
            sage: class C(object):
            ....:     @property
            ....:     @cached_method
            ....:     def f(self):
            ....:         print 'not cached'
            ....:         return 42
            sage: c = C(); c.f; c.f
```
gives

```
    not cached
    42
    not cached
    42
```
....so no caching of the method/property.
