There is a formatting error in TESTS-part in documentation of `is_triangle_free()` function. Look at phrase "Asking for an unknown algorithm".

And I guess that `::` in EXAMPLES-part in documentation of class sage.graphs.graph.Graph, in part 7, is just an error.

For such trivial things, it is no problem to integrate those changes inside of some other ticket.

OK. But how about other idea: A ticket "Minor typos 6.8", collect trivial errors to it, and make the patch just before 6.9 will be released?

Still more work than integrate trivial typo fixes in "any patch". You can create such a ticket, nobody will hate you for that. Just make sure that it gets reviewed when you need, just before the release.
