There is a formatting error in TESTS-part in documentation of `is_triangle_free()` function. Look at phrase "Asking for an unknown algorithm".

And I guess that `::` in EXAMPLES-part in documentation of class sage.graphs.graph.Graph, in part 7, is just an error.

OK. But how about other idea: A ticket "Minor typos 6.8", collect trivial errors to it, and make the patch just before 6.9 will be released?
