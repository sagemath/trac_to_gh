This ticket includes [https://github.com/otfried/ipe-tools/tree/master/matplotlib](https://github.com/otfried/ipe-tools/tree/master/matplotlib) into matplotlib's spkg and add the option to save graphics objects as .ipe files to be edited with ipe [http://ipe.otfried.org/](http://ipe.otfried.org/)

For some reason `figure.tight_layout()` fails with `FigureCanvasIpe` and I had to put it in the part of the code that runs conditionally.

The doctest of save as ipe is not formatted correctly (missing `::` and blank line after that)

There is a trivial failing doctest (see patchbot report)

But most importantly, changing matplotlib pkg without changing the version seems rather strange..

If it is a copy-paste then:
- mention from where it is copied
- do you ask to the copied people whether they care about inclusion in matplotlib or Sage?

As you said it should be the editor's job to be able to import from a standard format. This is not the case at the moment and I guess it will never be: if I understood correctly the idea is to keep the editor as minimal as possible. 

I personally am interested in post-processing images produced by sage and,
thinking this might be interesting for others, I made a patch. Of course this
introduces a maintaining cost that we probably could avoid. On the other hand I
do not see this feature being implemented upstream any time soon so this is the
only reasonable option I could come up with. If you feel it goes beyond the
guidelines of sage development I am ok with retiring this patch.
