```
The `quotient` method of toric lattices accepts a sublattice and should check that the argument is in fact a sublattice. According to the documentation,

```
   INPUT:

   * "sub" -- sublattice of self;

   * "check" -- (default: True) whether or not to check that "sub"
     is a valid sublattice.
```

However, it is possible to take the quotient of a lattice `N` with a sublattice of `M` that is not compatible:

```
sage: K = Cone([(1,0,0),(0,1,0)])
sage: K.lattice()
3-d lattice N
sage: K.orthogonal_sublattice()
Sublattice <M(0, 0, 1)>
sage: K.lattice().quotient(K.orthogonal_sublattice())
2-d lattice, quotient of 3-d lattice N by Free module of degree 3 and rank 1 over Integer Ring
Echelon basis matrix:
[0 0 1]
```

This should raise an error instead.

I added some tests/examples to the `quotient` method but noticed something strange when I went to do the same for the `ToricLattice_quotient` class. The code in the class calls `submodule()` which is where the error is expected to occur:

```
if check:
    try:
        W = V.submodule(W)
    except (TypeError, ArithmeticError):
        raise ArithmeticError("W must be a sublattice of V")
```

But the `submodule()` method isn't throwing one of those two errors -- it's throwing a `ValueError`. The result is that the user sees the exception thrown from `submodule()` and not the (nicer) error from the quotient class:

```
sage: from sage.geometry.toric_lattice import ToricLattice_quotient
sage: N = ToricLattice(3)
sage: M = ToricLattice(3, name='M')
sage: ToricLattice_quotient(N,M)
...
ValueError: M(1, 0, 0) can not generate a sublattice of 3-d lattice N
```

For the wishlist, it might help to report something other than the variable names in the `ToricLattice_quotient` error message. So instead of,

```
ArithmeticError: W must be a sublattice of V
```

it could be,

```
ArithmeticError: 3-d lattice M must be a sublattice of 3-d lattice N
```

but I realize that's hard to do if the user passes in weirder objects. We could get part of the way there by checking that `V` is in fact a lattice before doing the `submodule()` check. That way `V` will print nicely, and even if the user passes in something stupid it would read alright:

That's OK, I didn't have my hopes up for the error message.

My other concern was basically that this branch looked unreachable,

```
try:
    W = V.submodule(W)
except (TypeError, ArithmeticError):
    raise ArithmeticError("W must be a sublattice of V")
```

because the error that gets thrown in `submodule()` is a `ValueError`. But I see that I was wrong, and I added the doctest once I figured out how to cause that `ArithmeticError`.

Positive review otherwise.

That branch is probably due to copy-pasting from general span modules. Thanks for the review!
