If you draw an hyperbolic arc between two points with almost the same real part, it may result in a wrong arc. 

You can see it as follows:

```
g = hyperbolic_triangle(-1+I, 1.0000000000001+I, 1000*I+1, fill = true);
g.set_axes_range(-1.5,1.5,-.5,2.5)
g.show()
```

Hello,

Why 10<sup>-3</sup>? Moreover it can be very wrong if the imaginary part is very small. Just try

```
sage: hyperbolic_triangle(0, 0.0001, 0.0001*I)
```
The above example just works fine without your patch.

Hello Vincent,

thanks for reviewing my first patch!

Would a smaller boundary for the comparison be more eligible? Let's say 10<sup>-12</sup>? Of course, the analogue example of ours will still produce a wrong result:

`g = hyperbolic_triangle(0, 10**(-12),10**(-12)*I);g`

But scaled to a larger region of hyperbolic geometry, it is quite hard to see:

`g.set_axes_range(0,10**(-10),0,10**(-10));g`

Or do you know a better way to compare a value to zero in sage? 

best regards,
Stefan

Hello,

Putting a smaller value would not solve anything. The main problem is that this subtelty should depend on the window parameters (i.e. `xmin`, `xmax`, `ymin`, `ymax`). Hence decided at the time you generate the image.

I have no miracle to propose.

Hello,

Some trac administrative things:
- Once you are done with some modification, you should switch the status to `needs review` (it was in `needs work`).
- the `Authors` field should be with plain names (not the login)
This is fine for now.

Your solution is great! I set to positive review and it will be soonly merge in the development release.

Vincent
