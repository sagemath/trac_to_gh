The bug here is two-fold:

1. The roots for a `CoxeterGroup` are constructed as in Humphreys "in the Coxeter sense, that all have the same norm". Therefore it seems more natural to not at all introduce a type C and to follow Humphrey's classification of finite Coxeter groups given on page 32.

2. The current implementation of types B/C (which I suggest to remove and to only keep type B) is also broken:

* First Sage start

```
sage: W = CoxeterGroup(['B',4])
sage: W.coxeter_matrix().coxeter_type()
Coxeter type of ['B', 4]
sage: W = CoxeterGroup(['C',4])
sage: W.coxeter_matrix().coxeter_type()
Coxeter type of ['B', 4]
```
* Second Sage start

```
sage: W = CoxeterGroup(['C',4])
sage: W.coxeter_matrix().coxeter_type()
Coxeter type of ['C', 4]
sage: W = CoxeterGroup(['B',4])
sage: W.coxeter_matrix().coxeter_type()
Coxeter type of ['C', 4]
```

```
These are roots in the Coxeter sense, that all have the
same norm. They are given by their coefficients in the
base of simple roots, also taken to have all the same
norm.
```
How is this true if the sum of the coefficients is not one? As in

```
sage: W = CoxeterGroup(['A',2])
sage: W.roots()
[(1, 0), (1, 1), (0, 1), (-1, 0), (-1, -1), (0, -1)]

What ? Type A2 is simply laced, so the roots are just the roots in the Weyl sense..

The scalar product is the one that is invariant by the group, of course..

Isn't this just that the basis of the simple roots is not orthonormal? So one can't read of the norm of vectors expressed there right away.

Here is a fix for relabelling issues that I came across. Although I think this might be better on a separate ticket.

`@`darij the previous test for checking for relabelled types gave false negatives. Consider F<sub>4</sub> under cyclic shift and under interchanging 1 and 3. These are the *same* type and our relabelling check does not distinguish between them (nor can any algorithm).

How do we want to handle Coxeter vs Dynkin classification of the affine types or the general case? I'm guessing for the affine types, we just use the untwisted types. Do we even want to consider the general case at this point?

Oh, that!

I have to admit I don't know what the current recognition code is doing (the path-dependent output suggests some caching is going on), but my original code in #16630 never outputted a C_n. Maybe we should do the same?

The B/C issue isn't so much having to do with type recognition (which won't result in a C<sub>n</sub>), but instead what to do when we do things like `CoxeterType(['C', 5])`.
