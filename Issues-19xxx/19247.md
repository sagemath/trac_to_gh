The typo is fixed, and you will notice that it had nothing to do with this branch. Next time you spot a typo in a function which is not related to ticket X, instead of having the author of X fix it for you it would be better manners to add a commit yourself if you care.

About sum: by default in a .py file the 'sum' is Python's sum. The symbolic sum would have to be imported manually, which I did not do.

same in .pyx ? OK; it seems I'd remove some such imports I did... OK, not here, certainly.

Otherwise, looks good to me.
