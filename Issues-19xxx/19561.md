  Can you let n,q,i alone and just keep the changes
`l = ZZ(l)` and
`for j in srange(1,l+1):`

  These changes should be enough to ensure that the correct coercions take place and the division does not become an integer division. I will send you a document from Matti Aaltonen which shows that almost all properties of Krawtchouks hold even for noninteger n,q,i. Alternatively, you can refer to his paper "A new upper bound on nonbinary block codes", M. Aaltonen, Discrete Maths, 83 (1990), 139-160.
