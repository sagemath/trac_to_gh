Say you have a package A depending on B and you decide to (re)build B. Then you should also rebuild A before running Sage. For example:

```
        echo "Warning: it might be needed to update the Sage library before"
        echo "installed packages work: you should run 'make' from \$SAGE_ROOT"
        echo "before running Sage."
```
Implementation suggestions:
* print that warning simply after `make B`
* use `make --question`

I think it's slightly better to put the message in `build/make/install` such that it appears as very last message when the user installs a package.
