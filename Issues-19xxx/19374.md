```
The LaTeX display of output cells in the Jupyter notebook, which was working in Sage 6.8, is broken in Sage 6.9rc3: the LaTeX code is shown instead of the formula:

```
./sage -n jupyter
```


```
In[1]: %display latex
In[2]: sin(x^2)
Out[2]: \newcommand{\Bold}[1]{\mathbf{#1}}\sin\left(x^{2}\right)
```


Keywords: **jupyter, latex**

Thanks for the fix !
Seems good to me: LaTeX display is OK now and all doctests in src/sage/repl/ipython_kernel are passed.
A remark though: `sage -coverage src/sage/repl/ipython_kernel` reports some missing documentation.

The normal `git pull` will never throw away your local branch, `git trac pull` just mirrors that.

If you want to reuse the existing local branch you can fetch+reset instead of delete+checkout:

```
git trac fetch 19374
git reset --hard FETCH_HEAD
```
just like how you would use git directly.
