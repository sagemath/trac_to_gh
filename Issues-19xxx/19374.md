```

Thanks for the fix !
Seems good to me: LaTeX display is OK now and all doctests in src/sage/repl/ipython_kernel are passed.
A remark though: `sage -coverage src/sage/repl/ipython_kernel` reports some missing documentation.

The normal `git pull` will never throw away your local branch, `git trac pull` just mirrors that.

If you want to reuse the existing local branch you can fetch+reset instead of delete+checkout:

```
git trac fetch 19374
git reset --hard FETCH_HEAD
```
just like how you would use git directly.

Better use a relative path: absolute paths don't work with Jupyterhub (see also #19373)

If somebody can review my commit, you can set this ticket to positive_review.
