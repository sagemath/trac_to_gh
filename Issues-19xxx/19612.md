Suggestion:
#14243 was originally included to avoid interference from installation done outside of `sage`. Something `SMC` and `sage-on-gentoo` don't really have to worry about. A middle ground could be to have `sage`'s python to look for user installed packages in `DOT_SAGE/site-packages`.

I realize that.  Yet how many people reported problems with this -- one over 10 years?  I think we should revert #14243, and instead just add something to the FAQ about `export PYTHONNOUSERSITE=yes`.  If somebody really does have ~/.local/ stuff that is interfering with sage's python, they could set `export PYTHONNOUSERSITE=yes` themselves easily enough.
