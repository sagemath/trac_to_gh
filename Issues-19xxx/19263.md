In the category coalgebra, there is this problem with the method `coproduct_by_coercion`:

```python
return self.tensor_square().sum(coeff * tensor([self(R[I]), self(R[J])])
                                                for ((I, J), coeff) in R(x).coproduct())
```

First: I don't know why the code is not simply:

```
return tensor([self, self])(R(x).coproduct())
```

is it more efficient?

Second: `R[I]`, we should stop using alias in the code... this is not consistent. The code should use robust and indicative methods, so `R.monomial(I)`.
 
Whatever, it follows my fix.

This is an easy review.  I noticed minor changes in speed (perhaps it would be more dramatic on larger examples, but perhaps it will always be minor).
