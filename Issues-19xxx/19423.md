1. What I had in mind was more commonality between the three methods: Most of the methods deal with writing `self = max_elem * (1 + geom)`. This part could be done by a common routine. (log and inversion a slightly more comfortable with `1 - geom`, but I'd prefer to read standard taylor coefficients.
2. `_taylor_`:
   - I am not convinced of the name of the method. `_power_series_` ?
   - The role of `precision` is not explained.
   - There should be a doctest where a fixed point is reached before reaching `precision`
3. logarithm: I think that it would be more readable to start with 0 and let the coefficients start at `k=1`.

I used `-x` and everything is fine.

done.

still to do.

still to do.

I can live with the previous implementation for efficiency reasons.
