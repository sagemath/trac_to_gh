done.

>   (log and inversion a slightly more comfortable with `1 - geom`, but I'd prefer to read standard taylor coefficients.


I used `-x` and everything is fine.

> 2. `_taylor_`:
>    - I am not convinced of the name of the method. `_power_series_` ?


done.

>   - The role of `precision` is not explained.


still to do.

>   - There should be a doctest where a fixed point is reached before reaching `precision`


still to do.

> 3. logarithm: I think that it would be more readable to start with 0 and let the coefficients start at `k=1`.


I can live with the previous implementation for efficiency reasons.
