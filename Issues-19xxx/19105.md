I don't understand what the ticket proposes.
* Renaming python2 -> python is backward
* Renaming python3 -> python is too soon 
* Adding more spaghetti code to the install script to special-case python sucks
IMHO the current behavior is ideal, throw an error and point the user to either python2 or python3

Luckily, none of the above applies.

There is already code in `build/make/install` which deals with Python 2 vs. Python 3. The resulting file `build/make/Makefile` contains what is needed to make this work very easily.

That's where the problematic Python package is, right? And with recent versions of Sage, is there any reason to search "standard" packages? I think that all of those are either outdated or have more recent new-style replacements.

As you recall from #19004, we aren't searching anything anymore.

There are two partially separate issues here:
1. make sure that `sage -i python` **does not** install the **wrong** Python package.
2. make sure that `sage -i python` **does** install the **correct** Python package.

This patch here is more about the second point.
