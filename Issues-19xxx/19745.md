This year, we reworked the API of Sage's coding theory library and now have an object-oriented structure to manage code families, encoders and decoders.

In this ticket we introduce a thematic tutorial which explains how to use this new API to develop new code families.

This tutorials relies on a step-by-step example, in which we construct a code, a few encoders for it, a decoder for it and a somehow related channel.

I wrote the tutorial and pushed the branch which contains it...
But there's a bug I cannot fix:

anytime I try to compile the documentation, I receive the following error message:

```
OSError: [thematic_] /home/david/Desktop/sage_coding_project/src/doc/en/thematic_tutorials/structures_in_coding_theory.rst:: WARNING: document isn't included in any toctree
```

even after running `make doc-clean` and adding this tutorial to `index.rst`.
Thing is, my file appears in `thematic_tutorials` html index page, properly formatted...

If someone knows how to deal with it, I'll be glad!

In the meanwhile, one can still read this tutorial and do some comments ;)

Some comments:

- The second line of

  ```
    ....: class BinaryRepetitionCode(AbstractLinearCode):
    ....:   _registered_encoders = {}
  ```
  should be indented 4 spaces from the beginning of `class` to reflect Python coding conventions (similar changes are needed throughout the whole tutorial).
- I would put all of these in <code>\`\`code_format\`\`</code> or <code>:meth:\`reference_them\`</code>:

```
- dimension,
- length,
- base_field and
- ambient space
```
- This is not formatted properly. In particular, I would make these changes:

  ```diff
  3. Add this line in the class' constructor::
  +
  -    super(ClassName, self).__init__(base_field, length, "DefaultEncoder", "DefaultDecoder")
  +      super(ClassName, self).__init__(base_field, length, "DefaultEncoder", "DefaultDecoder")
  ```
  Similar changes in Section VI.
- All of those numbered points in the summary are missing periods.
- You should make this change because `\t` is a tab character:

  ```diff
  -return "\textnormal{Binary repetition code of length } %s" % self.length()
  +return "\\textnormal{Binary repetition code of length } %s" % self.length()
  ```
- It is considered better to have multiline statements wrapped in parentheses rather than use the line break `\`. The parentheses have the effect that it groups things together in logical units and the line break is not needed.
- Errors should be phrases, and as such, should not start with a capital letter: `DecodingFailure("impossible to find a majority")`

Otherwise it looks good to me. (Although I'm somewhat torn about using contractions in tutorials/documentation. I leave that decision up to you.)

Hi all,

I think most of the corrections have been done; I add a few comments:

* The repetition code can correct up to `:math: \lceil n-1/2 \rceil` errors (you wrote `n/2`); you should also change the `decoding_radius` method in the code.
* In `decode_to_code`: maybe you should return `vector(GF(2), [GF(2).one()] * n]` instead of `vector(GF(2), [1] * n]`; it's the same for `0`.
* Some typos: "all we have to do know is to implement", "we can store a lists".
* In the channel: maybe change `w[i] += 1` into `w[i] += GF2.one()`.
* You mixed `message` and `word` in:

```
def encode(self, message):
    return vector(GF(2), [word] * self.code().length())
```
* You didn't repeat some of the previous fixes of your code, in the big scripts of part VII (for example: `for i in sample(xrange(V.dimension(), number_err)`), so that it doesn't compile. Take care to do it also for the fixes related to my comments.
* I don't know if that's a real problem (that's also the case for other chapters): in the .pdf output of the tutorial, some code lines are cropped because they are too long.

Otherwise it looks fine!

Two other things from me (last things, promise):

- `\mathbb{F}_{2}` can use the standard Sage latex macro `\GF{2}` (it makes the docs uniform).
- Where possible, keep line lengths under 80 characters. (I know this isn't possible for some of the code blocks, but in particular, in the tutorial's text this should be achievable).

I'm happy with the changes, thanks for the help! I'm giving the green light.

> This is very well done tutorial, can we get you to write more (and for other areas of Sage)?

My plans was to rewrite the [original thematic tutorial on coding theory](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/thematic_tutorials/coding_theory.html#coding-theory), which can be quite improved according to me.

I'm actually working for Inria's [ACTIS](https://bitbucket.org/lucasdavid/sage_coding_project/wiki/Home) project which aims to enhance Sage's coding theory library, so I have to admit I barely looked at other tutorials `^^'`

If you think I can improve some of these, I'll be happy to help!

David

Feel free to cc me on the tickets. I'd be happy to help where I can (although I can't do a mathematical review since I really don't know too much about coding theory).
