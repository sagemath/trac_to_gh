This year, we reworked the API of Sage's coding theory library and now have an object-oriented structure to manage code families, encoders and decoders.

In this ticket we introduce a thematic tutorial which explains how to use this new API to develop new code families.

This tutorials relies on a step-by-step example, in which we construct a code, a few encoders for it, a decoder for it and a somehow related channel.

I wrote the tutorial and pushed the branch which contains it...
But there's a bug I cannot fix:

anytime I try to compile the documentation, I receive the following error message:

```
OSError: [thematic_] /home/david/Desktop/sage_coding_project/src/doc/en/thematic_tutorials/structures_in_coding_theory.rst:: WARNING: document isn't included in any toctree
```

even after running `make doc-clean` and adding this tutorial to `index.rst`.
Thing is, my file appears in `thematic_tutorials` html index page, properly formatted...

If someone knows how to deal with it, I'll be glad!

In the meanwhile, one can still read this tutorial and do some comments ;)

David

Some comments:

- The second line of

  ```
    ....: class BinaryRepetitionCode(AbstractLinearCode):
    ....:   _registered_encoders = {}
  ```
  should be indented 4 spaces from the beginning of `class` to reflect Python coding conventions (similar changes are needed throughout the whole tutorial).
- I would put all of these in <code>\`\`code_format\`\`</code> or <code>:meth:\`reference_them\`</code>:

```
- dimension,
- length,
- base_field and
- ambient space
```
- This is not formatted properly. In particular, I would make these changes:

  ```diff
  3. Add this line in the class' constructor::
  +
  -    super(ClassName, self).__init__(base_field, length, "DefaultEncoder", "DefaultDecoder")
  +      super(ClassName, self).__init__(base_field, length, "DefaultEncoder", "DefaultDecoder")
  ```
  Similar changes in Section VI.
- All of those numbered points in the summary are missing periods.
- You should make this change because `\t` is a tab character:

  ```diff
  -return "\textnormal{Binary repetition code of length } %s" % self.length()
  +return "\\textnormal{Binary repetition code of length } %s" % self.length()
  ```
- It is considered better to have multiline statements wrapped in parentheses rather than use the line break `\`. The parentheses have the effect that it groups things together in logical units and the line break is not needed.
- Errors should be phrases, and as such, should not start with a capital letter: `DecodingFailure("impossible to find a majority")`

Otherwise it looks good to me. (Although I'm somewhat torn about using contractions in tutorials/documentation. I leave that decision up to you.)

Hi all,

I think most of the corrections have been done; I add a few comments:

* The repetition code can correct up to `:math: \lceil n-1/2 \rceil` errors (you wrote `n/2`); you should also change the `decoding_radius` method in the code.
* In `decode_to_code`: maybe you should return `vector(GF(2), [GF(2).one()] * n]` instead of `vector(GF(2), [1] * n]`; it's the same for `0`.
* Some typos: "all we have to do know is to implement", "we can store a lists".
* In the channel: maybe change `w[i] += 1` into `w[i] += GF2.one()`.
* You mixed `message` and `word` in:

```
def encode(self, message):
    return vector(GF(2), [word] * self.code().length())
```
* You didn't repeat some of the previous fixes of your code, in the big scripts of part VII (for example: `for i in sample(xrange(V.dimension(), number_err)`), so that it doesn't compile. Take care to do it also for the fixes related to my comments.
* I don't know if that's a real problem (that's also the case for other chapters): in the .pdf output of the tutorial, some code lines are cropped because they are too long.

Otherwise it looks fine!

Julien

Hello,

Thank you for your comments!

I fixed everything you noticed.
I also fixed a few more bugs I noticed, several syntax errors and inconsistencies (`DecodingFailure` against `DecodingError` as discussed in #18376) with the existing coding theory library naming conventions.

Done! And don't worry, I prefer this to stay a little longer in review and be perfect. 
Especially I wasn't aware of the `\GF` macro, it will definitely save me some time later.

I'm happy with the changes, thanks for the help! I'm giving the green light.

My plans was to rewrite the [original thematic tutorial on coding theory](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/thematic_tutorials/coding_theory.html#coding-theory), which can be quite improved according to me.

I'm actually working for Inria's [ACTIS](https://bitbucket.org/lucasdavid/sage_coding_project/wiki/Home) project which aims to enhance Sage's coding theory library, so I have to admit I barely looked at other tutorials `^^'`

If you think I can improve some of these, I'll be happy to help!
