<a id='comment:12'></a>I've been playing around with this for the last week and I'm essentially ready to give the ticket a positive review. I can think of a couple of very minor improvements that might be better addressed in a follow-up ticket:
- add syntactic sugar to replace `H._g` with something like `H[1]`, or `H.endpoint(1)` or whatever
- create a parent for chain homotopies so that linear combinations can be taken easily

I encountered one more serious surprise in my experiments, and I'm not quite sure how to address this: I was starting with a chain complex `C` over the integers, and I wanted to work with its reduction modulo 2. The code that I came up with actually messed up the original complex:

```
sage: d1 = matrix([[-1,1,0],[1,-1,0],[-1,0,1],[1,0,-1]]).transpose()
sage: d2 = matrix([[-1,-1,+1,+1],[1,1,1,1]]).transpose()
sage: C=ChainComplex({2:d2,1:d1},degree_of_differential=-1,base_ring=ZZ)
sage: ascii_art(C)
                                [-1  1]      
            [-1  1 -1  1]       [-1  1]      
            [ 1 -1  0  0]       [ 1  1]      
            [ 0  0  1 -1]       [ 1  1]      
 0 <-- C_0 <-------------- C_1 <-------- C_2 <-- 0 
sage: D=ChainComplex(C._diff,degree_of_differential=C.degree_of_differential(),base_ring=GF(2))
sage: ascii_art(C)
                            [1 1]      
            [1 1 1 1]       [1 1]      
            [1 1 0 0]       [1 1]      
            [0 0 1 1]       [1 1]      
 0 <-- C_0 <---------- C_1 <------ C_2 <-- 0 
```
I would have expected an error here, and possibly a more convenient way to carry out the base change.

As for the patchbot errors: these are a bit confusing; I think they're all due to the fact that the dependencies of the ticket have not been properly merged for the test. Given the dependencies with #6101, #6102 I wonder if it isn't the best approach to approve them all at once, eventually.... (?)

Done (removed `\circ`)

This was already there, but I added a sentence.

Right, fixed.

Done.
