<a id='comment:1'></a>Here's an initial mock-up. Thought you might be interested. Also I was wondering if you knew of a better way to compute the cohomology and how much you think we should abstract these concepts for doing more general homology computations?

Related, would you be interested in an implementation of modules and free resolutions over polynomial rings?

<a id='comment:2'></a>Hi Travis, I'm finally getting around to looking at this. I have some issues with the documentation. I don't have much experience with Hochschild homology, so some of these may just be my own ignorance.

- If you're working over a base ring *R* which is not a field, do things go wrong if *M* is not projective as an *R*-module?

- I think the face maps *d_i* would be better without signs, and then the boundary map would be their alternating sum (as the Wikipedia page says). The point is that the unsigned face maps would be part of a simplicial structure.

- When you mention Tor and Ext, they should be over the ring *A<sup>e</sup>*, the tensor product of *A* and *A<sup>op</sup>*, instead of *A*.

Looking at the code, I wonder if it would be better to use Sage's `ChainComplex` class, at least when computing homology: to compute homology in dimension *d*, construct the chain complex by

```
C = ChainComplex({d: self.boundary(d).matrix(), d+1: self.boundary(d+1).matrix()}, degree_of_differential=-1)
```
Then compute `C.homology(d)` and lift the answer back to the original Hochschild complex. I didn't try any kind of lifting, but it seemed that constructing `C` and then computing `C.homology(d)` was faster than directly computing `HH.homology(d)`, at least in the cases I tried. One possible advantage is that if some day we speed up computations with general chain complexes, then this class would benefit.

Thanks!

I don't so much either, but I felt this provided a nice test case for infinite chain complexes (two of the things I'd like to eventually get would be group and Lie algebra (co)homology).

> - If you're working over a base ring *R* which is not a field, do things go wrong if *M* is not projective as an *R*-module?


I have no idea. Wikipedia was the most general reference as (IIRC) all of the other references I had found either assumed *R* was a field or made some implicit assumption (i.e., the base ring of the algebra was not specified).

> - I think the face maps *d_i* would be better without signs, and then the boundary map would be their alternating sum (as the Wikipedia page says). The point is that the unsigned face maps would be part of a simplicial structure.


Good point; changed. I also added the part about the simplicial structure to the doc.

> - When you mention Tor and Ext, they should be over the ring *A<sup>e</sup>*, the tensor product of *A* and *A<sup>op</sup>*, instead of *A*.


Fixed.

<a id='comment:13'></a>In #20686, I will mark `TestSuite(H).run()` as `# known bug` because `HochschildComplex` does not properly implement everything needed for its category. For example, it does not implement `zero()`.

These problems were not seen before simply because the category tests were not run. #20686 ensures that the correct tests are run, but then they fail for `HochschildComplex`.

Luckily, #20686 fixes this:

```
             sage: H in ChainComplexes(QQ)
             True
```
which was `# known bug` before.
