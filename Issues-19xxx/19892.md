The branch implements the closed faces of a hyperplane arrangement, the multiplication of the face semigroup, and its semigroup algebra.

The semigroup itself is not implemented, since I cannot find a way to build a finite semigroup (or magma) out of a multiplication table. I could make this myself, but I feel stupid doing this, as I would likely just duplicate something existing (and not very well, as I still don't grok the category framework). I *can* add it if you want me to.

When your hyperplanes have the equations x == 0, y == 0 and x + y == 0, then the face (x == 0 & y == 0) of the hyperplane arrangement formed by the first two will intersect the halfspace x + y >= 0 in itself, and we want to record this as a 0 sign, not as a +1 sign. Remember that all the faces here are closed faces.

Sorry for the doc bug! If you could fix this (in the hopefully obvious way; I tend to get the "::"s wrong in docstrings), I'd be really grateful.

But wouldn't that case already be covered by this section?

```
                if zero_part_dim == face_dim:
                    # If the intersection of ``face`` with ``hyperplane``
                    # has the same dimension as ``face``, then this
                    # intersection *is* ``face``, so we can continue
                    # (without adding the other two intersections, since
                    # those are empty):
                    subdivided.append((signs + (0,), face))
                    continue
```

Also, I added the missing colons, but still the doc building complains.

Nevermind, I understood the logic behind it now.

The code looks correct to me. But I have a couple suggestions/comments/questions:

- The way to construct the closed faces seems a bit overcomplicated. My impression is that a recursive approach (take the delition of the last hyperplane, compute the closed faces, and then intersect them with the three sides of the deleted hyperplane) would probably be simpler (but maybe slower). Did you consider it?

- I think that the semigroup algebra should provide an option to provide the names of the generators.

Good point, done.

I'll take care of the doc shortly, once it's done building.

Yes, that is what i meant. I don't think it will be faster than what you do, but maybe more readable. Anyways, if there is some problem with the ordering, it is probably better to leave it the way it is.
