The branch implements the closed faces of a hyperplane arrangement, the multiplication of the face semigroup, and its semigroup algebra.

The semigroup itself is not implemented, since I cannot find a way to build a finite semigroup (or magma) out of a multiplication table. I could make this myself, but I feel stupid doing this, as I would likely just duplicate something existing (and not very well, as I still don't grok the category framework). I *can* add it if you want me to.

When your hyperplanes have the equations x == 0, y == 0 and x + y == 0, then the face (x == 0 & y == 0) of the hyperplane arrangement formed by the first two will intersect the halfspace x + y >= 0 in itself, and we want to record this as a 0 sign, not as a +1 sign. Remember that all the faces here are closed faces.

Sorry for the doc bug! If you could fix this (in the hopefully obvious way; I tend to get the "::"s wrong in docstrings), I'd be really grateful.

Nevermind, I understood the logic behind it now.

The code looks correct to me. But I have a couple suggestions/comments/questions:

- The way to construct the closed faces seems a bit overcomplicated. My impression is that a recursive approach (take the delition of the last hyperplane, compute the closed faces, and then intersect them with the three sides of the deleted hyperplane) would probably be simpler (but maybe slower). Did you consider it?

- I think that the semigroup algebra should provide an option to provide the names of the generators.

Isn't this what I am doing? Or do you want me to make the method fully recursive, i.e., build a hyperplane arrangement out of the first n-1 hyperplanes, then call the `closed_faces` method on that, and then just cut with the last hyperplane? I think that wouldn't be any faster than what I have done, plus I am not sure that it would work, because when you call `HyperplaneArrangement` the hyperplanes are getting sorted in some way, and I'm not sure whether removing a hyperplane wouldn't mess up the order of the remaining ones.

> - I think that the semigroup algebra should provide an option to provide the names of the generators.

Good point, done.

I'll take care of the doc shortly, once it's done building.

Yes, that is what i meant. I don't think it will be faster than what you do, but maybe more readable. Anyways, if there is some problem with the ordering, it is probably better to leave it the way it is.
