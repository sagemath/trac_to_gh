The last class to use `sage.combinat.cartesian_product.CartesianProduct_iters` is the `CombinatorialFreeModule`. 

It is not simple to get rid of this since there is no check in constructing element of a combinatorial free module... hence changing the basis from being tuples to be element of a cartesian product might lead to subtle errors (e.g. http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18411#comment:24). This is addressed in #18750

This will solve #18849 and probably #24900.

Therefore, we do not put such objects\nin the :class:`~sage.structure.unique_representation.UniqueRepresentation` cache.\n```\nIt depends on what you mean by equality. Now we normally think of equality of sets as containment in both ways, but it might be better to think of them like knots or polytopes. You might have the same polytope (same subset of **R**<sup>n</sup>) but different representations. So it could make sense for them to not be equal. Consequently, I do not support this disabling of `UniqueRepresentation`. Either you need to remove that altogether, which I strongly oppose because of the consequences with parents and how much nicer `UniqueRepresentation` behavior makes things, or you test by equality, which uses whatever definition of equality the object uses.\n\nThis statement is needs correcting:\n\n```diff\n-When the first factor is infinite (or not known to be finite), it still\n+When all but the first factor is known to be finite, it\n uses the lexicographic order::\n```\nI believe your code would produce\n\n```\nsage: list(islice(cantor_product(NN, NN, GF(2)), 6))\n[(0, 0, 0), (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1), (2, 0, 0), (1, 1, 0)]\n```\n\nSomething else to be aware of is elements of `cartesian_product` are actual Sage elements rather than `list`s. So this could lead to performance regressions. Lots of things use the `CFM_tensor` class; all of the Hopf algebras basically. We might want a base or sub class of the `cartesian_product` that acts as a fa\u00e7ade parent for tuples. So the only difference is essentially in the `_element_constructor_` and/or `__call__`.\n\nI am wondering why we did not put `EnumeratedSets().CartesianProducts()` in the category of `EnumeratedSets()`. We might want to do this to have access to some of the generic methods from there, such as `unrank()`. Likewise, it would be good to port over some of these extra methods to `cartesian_product`, which would improve the (generic) implementation, and/or move things into the category.",

<a id='comment:63'></a>Thank you for working on this. It definitely would be good to have things more centralized. Hopefully these comments are fairly simple to incorporate.

I think this is a very dangerous test:

```python
if not repr(self) == repr(other):
```
(which it should use `!=` anyways) because

```
sage: x = 1.0
sage: y = 1
sage: repr(x) == repr(y)
False
sage: x == y
True
sage: hash(x) == hash(y)
True
```
Equal objects need not have equal (string) representations. So you have introduced a change in behavior in a way that does not respect equality.

On the other hand, I disagree with this reasoning:

```
Two :class:`EnumeratedSetFromIterator` objects that are not known to be finite
cannot be reliably tested for equality. Therefore, we do not put such objects
in the :class:`~sage.structure.unique_representation.UniqueRepresentation` cache.
```
It depends on what you mean by equality. Now we normally think of equality of sets as containment in both ways, but it might be better to think of them like knots or polytopes. You might have the same polytope (same subset of **R**<sup>n</sup>) but different representations. So it could make sense for them to not be equal. Consequently, I do not support this disabling of `UniqueRepresentation`. Either you need to remove that altogether, which I strongly oppose because of the consequences with parents and how much nicer `UniqueRepresentation` behavior makes things, or you test by equality, which uses whatever definition of equality the object uses.

This statement is needs correcting:

```diff
-When the first factor is infinite (or not known to be finite), it still
+When all but the first factor is known to be finite, it
 uses the lexicographic order::
```
I believe your code would produce

```
sage: list(islice(cantor_product(NN, NN, GF(2)), 6))
[(0, 0, 0), (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1), (2, 0, 0), (1, 1, 0)]
```

Something else to be aware of is elements of `cartesian_product` are actual Sage elements rather than `list`s. So this could lead to performance regressions. Lots of things use the `CFM_tensor` class; all of the Hopf algebras basically. We might want a base or sub class of the `cartesian_product` that acts as a façade parent for tuples. So the only difference is essentially in the `_element_constructor_` and/or `__call__`.

I am wondering why we did not put `EnumeratedSets().CartesianProducts()` in the category of `EnumeratedSets()`. We might want to do this to have access to some of the generic methods from there, such as `unrank()`. Likewise, it would be good to port over some of these extra methods to `cartesian_product`, which would improve the (generic) implementation, and/or move things into the category.

I think you are trying to tell me that when I disabled `UniqueRepresentation`, I also need to disable `WithEqualityById`.

I agree with this, it needs to be corrected.

Actually, not even a `CachedRepresentation`. I've now introduced a new class `WithPicklingByInitArgs`, which `CachedRepresentation` subclasses.

```
    - ``category`` -- (default: ``None``) an optional category for that

If we use

F = EnumeratedSetFromIterator(lambda: iter([1, 2]), category=FiniteEnumeratedSets())
```
then the doctest passes. How is it supposed to function if it doesn't know whether the arguments are finite?

    TypeError: __init__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'category'
```

I think what's happening there is that `super().__init__` is being used in a situation where the `__init__` methods do not have compatible signatures.

```
class GenericGrowthGroup(UniqueRepresentation, Parent, WithLocals):
    def __init__(self, base, category, var): ...
class CartesianProduct_base(WithPicklingByInitArgs, Parent):
    def __init__(self, sets, category, flatten=False): ...
class CartesianProductPoset(CartesianProduct_unique):
    def __init__(self, sets, category, order=None, **kwargs):
```
