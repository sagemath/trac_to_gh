Well, it passes if the machine is not under extremely high load...

If you really want the doctests to pass always, the only option is removing the test.

Why do we need a timeout different from the doctest timeout? Its not a benchmark, we just want to know if abort works or not. And doctests are totally unsuitable for benchmarks anyways, as can be seen here.

That's too long.

You have a find a time `T` such that
1. no machine can finish the actual computation in less than time `T`
2. every machine can process the interrupt in at most time `T`

> And doctests are totally unsuitable for benchmarks anyways

It's not meant as benchmark, it's meant to show that interrupts work.

There are two different times. I'm talking about the `t < 10`, not the `alarm(2)`. The former unnecessarily duplicates the doctest timeout. Your 1. is referring to the latter.

No, because I want to test that the function was actually interrupted. If some function takes 5 seconds to run, then it will always take at most 5 seconds to "interrupt", even if the interrupt doesn't work.
