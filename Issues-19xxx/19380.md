If you really want the doctests to pass always, the only option is removing the test.

That's too long.

You have a find a time `T` such that
1. no machine can finish the actual computation in less than time `T`
2. every machine can process the interrupt in at most time `T`

> And doctests are totally unsuitable for benchmarks anyways

It's not meant as benchmark, it's meant to show that interrupts work.

No, because I want to test that the function was actually interrupted. If some function takes 5 seconds to run, then it will always take at most 5 seconds to "interrupt", even if the interrupt doesn't work.
