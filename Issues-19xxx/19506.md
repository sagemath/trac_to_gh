Cellular algebras are a class of algebras that have a well-behaved representation theory generalizing that of the Hecke algebra:

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_algebra
- http://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~bernhard.keller/ictp2006/lecturenotes/xi.pdf

We give a basic category implementation of cellular algebras and add the symmetric group algebra into this category as an example implementation.

This is mostly just a marker of constructing the cell datum (to which I coined some names). Follow-ups will include the natural representations a cellular algebra has and putting more algebras into this category.

Hi Travis,

I am intrigued. Which cellular basis are you using for the symmetric group? I have a few implementations of cellular bases but the nuts and bolts are always non-trivial so I am wondering what your category code provides and how easy it is to massage the symmetric group example into your framework. Of course, I really should read your code but I haven't done this. The ticket description does not give much information.

I was originally following the lecture notes by Xi above, where RSK was define the basis (see example 5). However my test suite actually told me this was incorrect. So instead I switched to the seminormal basis, which as far as I can tell, is the specialization of the Murphy basis of the Hecke algebra.

To implement an object in cellular algebras, one needs to implement the following:

- `cell_poset` which returns the poset parameterizing the cells.
- `cell` which takes an element `la` in the cell poset and returns the cell `M(la)`.
- One of the following:
  * `_to_cellular_element` which takes a basis index `i` and return an element in `cellular_basis`.
  * `_from_cellular_index` which takes `(la, s, t)` and returns an element of the algebra.
  * `cellular_basis` which returns an algebra with a basis indexed by `(la, s, t)` and has coercions to and from the algebra.

The first two are simply data, but the non-trivial part is the third one. However my current framework in a way assumes a distinguished cellular basis, but that is not to say it limits the algebra to one cellular basis.

[Edit - I should actually think a little bit more and remember that I am testing this mechanism for the tensor product.]

The next step would be to implement the representations, bilinear form, decomposition matrix, and Cartan matrix.

    "body": "<a id='comment:8'></a>\nReplying to [tscrim](#comment%3A5):\n> I was originally following the lecture notes by Xi above, where RSK was define the basis (see example 5). However my test suite actually told me this was incorrect. \n\n\nExample 5 of Xi's notes says that the Kazhdan-Lustig basis, via RSK, defines a cellular basis: that is, the cellular basis element indexed by (P,Q) is C_w if w corresponds to (P,Q) under RSK. This was Graham's motoviating example (and it is certainly correct). From the way that Xi has written it, however, I think that this result is only clear if you have already seen it before. Rather than Xi's notes the original Graham-Lehrer paper or my book would be a better reference (of course I am biased!)\n\n>So instead I switched to the seminormal basis, which as far as I can tell, is the specialization of the Murphy basis of the Hecke algebra.\n\n\nA seminormal basis is a Wedderburn basis for the semisimple symmetric group or algebra. Wedderburn bases are always cellular but they are not particularly interesting examples of cellular bases because once you have a Wedderburn basis all of the consequences of cellularity are already obvious. The Murphy basis is an *integral* basis of the group algebra of the symmetric group (there are generalisations of the Murphy basis to other algebras). The transition matrix between the Murphy basis and one particular seminormal basis is unitriangular -- the off- diagonal entries of this transition matrix are not at all understood.

Example 5 of Xi's notes says that the Kazhdan-Lustig basis, via RSK, defines a cellular basis: that is, the cellular basis element indexed by (P,Q) is C_w if w corresponds to (P,Q) under RSK. This was Graham's motoviating example (and it is certainly correct). From the way that Xi has written it, however, I think that this result is only clear if you have already seen it before.

A seminormal basis is a Wedderburn basis for the semisimple symmetric group or algebra. Wedderburn bases are always cellular but they are not particularly interesting examples of cellular bases because once you have a Wedderburn basis all of the consequences of cellularity are already obvious. The Murphy basis is an *integral* basis of the group algebra of the symmetric group (there are generalisations of the Murphy basis to other algebras). The transition matrix between the Murphy basis and one particular seminormal basis is unitriangular -- the off- diagonal entries of this transition matrix are not at all understood. I have no idea which seminormal basis is implemented in sage but I would guess that it is not the one that is closely related to the Murphy basis.

I have had a quick look at your code. I don't think that it makes much sense to have a CellularBasis class without first developing a non-trivial example because without a proper example you will not see what is likely to be needed in general. 

I think that the idea is to provide extra functionality/structure on top of an AlgebraWithBasis. The non-trivial work in implementing a real example is in writing the coercion/conversion code going from a standard basis (for example, the permutation basis of the group algebra of the symmetric group) to a cellular basis (for example, the Murphy or Kazhdan-Lusztig bases of the group algebra of the symmetric group). Typically it is easy to write the cellular basis elements in terms of standard bases elements but the inverse operation is often tricky.

If `C` were a cellular basis class then I would expect `C(s,t)` to return the cellular basis element indexed by `s` and `t`. Strictly speaking, this should be `C(mu,s,t)` but in all of the interesting examples the "shape" `mu` (=element of the indexing poset) is implicitly encoded in `s` and `t` so there is no need to specify it. The methods `_to_cellular_element` and `_from_cellular_index` should be hidden, as you have them. I would expect them to be called implicitly via commands like `A(C(s,t))` and `C(A(w))`.

There probably should be a `cell_poset` method, as you have, but the `cell` method seems slightly strange to me, I might call this `cell_module_indices`. The most important method should be a `cell_module` method that returns the (left or right) cell module: `C.cell_module(mu)` or perhaps `C.left_cell_module(m)` and `C.right_cell_module(mu)`. These should be something like a CombinatorialFreeModules and they should come with actions of the algebra. The bilinear form on the cell module would of course be defined on this module. I would expect things the like following to work:

```
sage: M=SymmetricGroupAlgebra(ZZ,4).Murphy_basis()
sage: Smu=M.cell_module(3,1)
sage: Smu.basis()   
{ S([[1,2,3],[4]]), S([[1,2,4],[3]]), S([[1,3,4],[2]]) ]
sage: M([[1,2,4],[3]], [[1,2,3],[4]]) * S([[1,2,3],[4]])
6*S([[1,2,4],[3]])   
sage: Smu.inner_product([[1,2,3],[4]], [[1,2,3],[4]])
6
```

Note that indexing set for the basis of the cell modules is your `.cell` method and that the action of the cellular basis on the cell module gives the inner product.

There are no (good) algorithms for computing the decomposition matrices and Cartan matrices -- except for special cases like the Iwahori-Hecke algebras of types A and B using Kazhdan-Lustzig polynomial combinatorics.

Ah, I see. I had a suspicion that it was going to be the KL basis. I misinterpreted the `w \in \Sigma_n` as an element of the natural basis since RSK of w vs w<sup>-1</sup> switches the two tableaux. At least that tells me a way to implement the cellular basis for the Iwahori-Hecke algebra (for type A). 

Math question, do you know if the other type analogues of RSK extend to give a cellular basis for the Iwahori-Hecke algebras of other types, such as Lecouvey's insertion for type C?

Hmm...interesting and good to know. I will have to change some of my documentation.

We definitely have to implement each of these bases as actual instances and some point in the near future I will (finally) convert the symmetric group algebra into the `WithRealizations` framework. (Yes, I know I have said this a few times in the past.)

The nice thing about the way I've done it using `module_morphism` is that it computes the inverse transition for free (at least when working over a field). So it is sufficient to define the transition from the cellular basis to the standard basis.

You are correct; that is what currently occurs by passing them to `module_morphism`.

I'm glad to know that we are on the same page for this.

We have the capacity to compute the radical and the quotient in Sage. I guess the trouble is determining the exact decompositions in the quotient. I wasn't so hopeful on this.

Here is a basic implementation for the cell modules. I haven't fully tested it yet, but it should work. I will do more testing tomorrow and get it to full doctest coverage.

Question, what should I rename the method `cells` to? It doesn't quite fit now that `cell` -> `cell_module_indices`.

Okay, so I've tried working on reducing the input for the cellular algebra down to 2 indices at the level of the category and I was running into trouble. I think what I will have to do to implement this is do a subclass of `CellularBasis` which overrides the category methods.

I'm not sure if I want to put the Iwahori-Hecke algebra into the cellular algebras category unless there is a way we can do it for all (finite) Coxeter groups. This would also work as a good followup ticket too IMO.

The other big thing I want to do is get the action extended to the base algebra and working on the simple modules.
