This patch changes some `method` to `algorithm` in graphs. Also it corrects some too deep indentation in nested lists in the documentation.

what do you think of `algorithm="igraph"`, where igraph is a graph library?

That at least it is better to have only `algorithm` than both `algorithm` and `method`. There is two keywords that we can get rid of: `method` and `impl`.

Theoretically there is a big difference between algorithm and implementation. For example we could have a buggy implementation of Newton's method. But does Sage has any function that could be used like `solve(f, algorithm='newton', implementation='buggylibrary')`?

I don't think that `algorithm='igraph'` is very proper either, but at least we will get some kind of simplification by using 'algorithm' indeed.

Good to go,
