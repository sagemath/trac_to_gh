This patch changes some `method` to `algorithm` in graphs. Also it corrects some too deep indentation in nested lists in the documentation.

what do you think of `algorithm="igraph"`, where igraph is a graph library?

I don't think that `algorithm='igraph'` is very proper either, but at least we will get some kind of simplification by using 'algorithm' indeed.

Good to go,
