The .convert() function converts units to their base units, e.g.

```
sage: (units.energy.joule).convert()                            
```

```
kilogram*meter^2/second^2
```
The units of heat capacity are joule/kelvin/kilogram and since joule is not a base unit, it should be possible to convert them to base units. However, this throws an error:

```
sage: (units.energy.joule/units.temperature.kelvin/units.mass.kilogram).convert()
```

```
Traceback (click to the left of this block for traceback)
...
ValueError: Cannot convert
```

This seems to be the case whenever something is divided by temperature.

Keywords: **units**
