This commit belongs to the other branch, not to that one. If you remove it from this branch, it will be in Sage when #19018 will be merged.

So what do we do? With two papers that say contradictory things?

I was comparing your definition with the one from
http://homepages.cwi.nl/~aeb/math/ipm/ipm.pdf
and your definition is more complicated.
I did not check the other one.

If look at combinat/matrices/hadamard_matrix.py there is a paragraph saying

```
The module below implements the Paley constructions (see for example
[Hora]_) and the Sylvester construction. It also allows you to pull a
Hadamard matrix from the database at [HadaSloa]_.
```
But there is no word about RSHCDs. 
Should it instead get a list of methods, etc, as more modern Sage modules have?

As well, you're not in the list of authors.

As I am gearing up for skew-Hadamard matrices, it can be done on the corresponding ticket.

I don't see how. In the paper you give the matrix is requested to have 1 on the diagonal, that's the only difference I see.

Skew-hadamard? *sigh*.... Someday we will have all kind of designs in Sage. But today is not this day.

yes, this is the difference that makes your definition different.
I suppose this is very close to the original one, as all is needed is multiplication by -1 to convert one into the other. But still not the same...
