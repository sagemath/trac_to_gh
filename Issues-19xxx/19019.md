In the local branch you have this commit. In the branch of #19018 you have another copy of it. Because you cherry-picked it, when the two branches will be merged you will have two copies of it.

This commit belongs to the other branch, not to that one. If you remove it from this branch, it will be in Sage when #19018 will be merged.

You should have merged the branches, not cherry-picked the commit.

I was comparing your definition with the one from
http://homepages.cwi.nl/~aeb/math/ipm/ipm.pdf
and your definition is more complicated.
I did not check the other one.

If look at combinat/matrices/hadamard_matrix.py there is a paragraph saying

```
The module below implements the Paley constructions (see for example
[Hora]_) and the Sylvester construction. It also allows you to pull a
Hadamard matrix from the database at [HadaSloa]_.
```
But there is no word about RSHCDs. 
Should it instead get a list of methods, etc, as more modern Sage modules have?

As well, you're not in the list of authors.

As I am gearing up for skew-Hadamard matrices, it can be done on the corresponding ticket.

I don't see how. In the paper you give the matrix is requested to have 1 on the diagonal, that's the only difference I see.

Probably. I am working on a patch related to index of functions at the moment, though. Something to make building a thematic index easier.

How I hate this "I am the one who did it" bullshit...

> As I am gearing up for skew-Hadamard matrices, it can be done on the corresponding ticket.

Skew-hadamard? *sigh*.... Someday we will have all kind of designs in Sage. But today is not this day.

yes, this is the difference that makes your definition different.
I suppose this is very close to the original one, as all is needed is multiplication by -1 to convert one into the other. But still not the same...

well, if only for uniformity...

For all practical purposes it is the same. One says that the diagonal has to be 1, the other says that it can be -1 but adapts the value of row sums. If you get one which does not have a 1 on the diagonal, then `-your_matrix` does the job, and all results of existence/non-existence apply.
