The source is in pynac package, in C++. Let me dig this up more precisely.
By the way, it's essential that the argument is a float, if it is an integer (e.g. `42`) or a half-integer (e.g. `39/2`) then there is no leak.

Probably it's here, but I'm not sure
https://github.com/pynac/pynac/blob/master/ginac/inifcns_gamma.cpp#L423

It does not seem to be easy to get more details, one has to know how pynac/ginac works, at least a bit...
The cython interface is in `src/sage/libs/pynac`, and there are some py_phi*-functions
defined there, but they don't seem to leak.

Seems promising. But there seems to be no `new` or `malloc` in that file.

Personally I do not even understand what really happens when you say `psi(0.5)`. Classes are created, used, discarded?

A first guess would be buggy usage of the Python C API in https://github.com/pynac/pynac/blob/master/ginac/numeric.cpp. Note that `gamma(SR(-.5))` leaks while `gamma(-.5)` does not. The first calls Pynac (`inifcns_gamma.cpp:gamma_eval`), explanations can be found in https://github.com/pynac/pynac/wiki/%7C-floating-point-evaluation, while the second goes through `src/sage/symbolic/function.pyx`, calling the `gamma` member of `RealNumber`. Because mpfr has no `psi` nor `beta`, Pynac provides these by calling arb via the Python C API.

...see e.g. the last two lines of `numeric::lgamma`. Or do you mean how they are wrapped? Please see `numeric.h` for the class which has:

```
union Value {
        Value() {}
        Value(signed long int i) : _long(i) {}
        signed long int _long;
        mpz_t _bigint;
        mpq_t _bigrat;
        PyObject* _pyobject;
};
```
The line `numeric rnum(ret);` calls the constructor `numeric::numeric` and the line `ex_to<numeric>(rnum.evalf(0, parent));` converts the ball it to the needed parent.

I had a quick look at the code. The only thing I see that could potentially leak is when a Python exception happens, for example in

```C
    PyObject* ret_ball = PyObject_CallMethodObjArgs(aball, name, NULL);
    if (ret_ball == nullptr)
        throw(std::runtime_error("GiNaC::CallBallMethod1Arg(): PyObject_CallMethodObjArgs unsuccessful"));
```
you are throwing but not calling `Py_DECREF()`.

I meant calling `Py_DECREF()` on things which have been allocated before. Pseudo-code:

```
a = PySomething()
if a is NULL:
    throw("something failed")

b = PySomethingElse()
if b is NULL:
    # Should do Py_DECREF(a) here
    throw("something else failed")
```
