Fixes an issue for the is_mutation_finite method of ClusterSeed.  

This method would enter an infinite loop when called on the ClusterSeed of a single vertex digraph.  

In order to avoid mutating twice in the same direction, the code would enter an indefinite loop (which could not terminate on a single vertex).  

This ticket corrects the issue by returning 'True' for the single vertex case before the indefinite loop can begin.

This was a bad bug as it looped forever.

Overall it looks good to me, but you should add something like
