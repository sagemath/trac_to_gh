Fixes an issue for the is_mutation_finite method of ClusterSeed.  

This method would enter an infinite loop when called on the ClusterSeed of a single vertex digraph.  

In order to avoid mutating twice in the same direction, the code would enter an indefinite loop (which could not terminate on a single vertex).  

This ticket corrects the issue by returning 'True' for the single vertex case before the indefinite loop can begin.

This was a bad bug as it looped forever.

Overall it looks good to me, but you should add something like

```
Check that :trac:`19495` is fixed::
```
before the test so that anyone who wonders why this test is there, they can refer to this ticket.
