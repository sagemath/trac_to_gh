There are several related problems here, and it seems best to solve them together:
- the error described in the ticket description
- after fixing this in a minimal way, the base ring of the Cartesian product in the example is not initialised
- after fixing this as well, coercion from the base ring is not implemented.

The attached branch fixes the above problems essentially by getting rid of the method `__init_extra__` of `UnitalAlgebras`, which used the somewhat problematic `register_coercion()` mechanism, and implementing equivalent functionality in `_coerce_map_from_()` instead.  Because this method can (and is) overridden by other `_coerce_map_from_()` methods, those need to be adapted.  Depending on the implementation of coercion from the base ring, this is done either through `super` (resulting in a coercion map implemented via `_lmul_()`, as in the old `UnitalAlgebras.__init_extra__()`) or by returning `True` (resulting in a `DefaultConvertMap`).

Some occurrences of `x.parent()` were changed to `parent(x)` in cases where `x` can be a Python type.  Also, there was a bidirectional coercion between free algebras and their "PBW bases" which caused doctest failures; the coercion from the free algebra to the PBW bases was not needed and has been removed.  Finally, this allows the hack introduced in #11900 (an attribute `_no_generic_basering_coercion`) can be removed, and seems to solve #16492.

-1 to getting rid of this mechanism. It means you can no longer simply inherit from, e.g., `CombinatorialFreeModule` and set the category when creating a new (unital) algebra. It also acts as a safeguard to do something that every unital algebra should do.

Perhaps an improvement would be for `__init_extra__` to first check to see if the usual `_coerce_map_from_` does result in a coercion from the base ring. At least this would fix the need for the `_no_generic_basering_coercion` in polynomial rings. I haven't checked to see if this will fix the problem in the ticket description.

Also, technically, an implementation of `_lmul_` is not a coercion, but an action (maybe with a coercion into the domain).

I've been told that this is faster too.

This is an immediate -1 from me because they are the same object (in the mathematical sense), just expressed in terms of different bases. So there should, and needs, to be a bidirectional coercion. The fact that this needs to be removed is a very strong indication to me that this is not the correct fix.

>  Finally, this allows the hack introduced in #11900 (an attribute `_no_generic_basering_coercion`) can be removed, and seems to solve #16492.


However, the fact that `_coerce_map_from_` returns `True` is a definite bug as everything (supposedly) coerces in. I do not believe it is something that `_element_constructor_` can dictate.

It means you can no longer simply inherit from, e.g., `CombinatorialFreeModule` and set the category when creating a new (unital) algebra.\n\n\nThis is not true; if you do this, then everything should work in the same way as before except the default coercion map is now discovered by `_coerce_map_from_()`.  Of course, if you override `_coerce_map_from_()` then you either have to make sure you return a custom coercion map from the base ring (if you have one), or call `super` to get the default one, implemented via `_lmul_()`.  I am convinced that this is a feature, not a bug, and that the existing method has several disadvantages:\n- because the coercion map is constructed in `__init_extra__()`, it is always constructed, even if you are never going to use it;\n- as a consequence, if a user wants to declare a coercion map to or from an algebra, this is impossible because the coercion system has already been invoked;\n- similarly, when writing a new class of algebras (in my case I was trying to build one on top of Cartesian products of algebras), and you want to use your own coercion from the base ring, you have to resort to the ugly `_no_generic_basering_coercion` hack.",

This is not true; if you do this, then everything should work in the same way as before except the default coercion map is now discovered by `_coerce_map_from_()`.  Of course, if you override `_coerce_map_from_()` then you either have to make sure you return a custom coercion map from the base ring (if you have one), or call `super` to get the default one, implemented via `_lmul_()`.  I am convinced that this is a feature, not a bug, and that the existing method has several disadvantages:
- because the coercion map is constructed in `__init_extra__()`, it is always constructed, even if you are never going to use it;
- as a consequence, if a user wants to declare a coercion map to or from an algebra, this is impossible because the coercion system has already been invoked;
- similarly, when writing a new class of algebras (in my case I was trying to build one on top of Cartesian products of algebras), and you want to use your own coercion from the base ring, you have to resort to the ugly `_no_generic_basering_coercion` hack.

If you look at the code of `UnitalAlgebras.ParentMethods.__init_extra__()`, you will see that the default coercion map from the base ring is implemented as an action via `_lmul_()`.  The coercion framework does discover and use actions, not just coercion into a common parent.  For example:

```
sage: cm = get_coercion_model()
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: cm.explain(1, x)
Action discovered.
    Left scalar multiplication by Integer Ring on Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field

Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field

Bidirectional coercions should always be avoided, for at least two reasons:
- If `X` and `Y` are two parents with bidirectional coercion maps, and if `x` and `y` are elements of `X` and `Y`, respectively, then it is not clear where `x + y` should live.

I never claimed this was a bug. However, I am worried about speed regressions here from walking up the MRO, as well as enforcing it could lead to some mathematical issues because possible (natural) coercion is inversely proportional to the amount of structure. See my other reply.

I see this as an enforcement of the category requirements. However, it does have a cost when constructing the parents, and I agree that it should be avoiding.

> - as a consequence, if a user wants to declare a coercion map to or from an algebra, this is impossible because the coercion system has already been invoked;


No, that is not true. You are adding a coercion map. So you can always add additional coercions. With `develop`:

```
sage: C = CombinatorialFreeModule(QQ, ['a','b'])
sage: D = CombinatorialFreeModule(QQ, ['a','b','c'])
sage: phi = C.module_morphism(D.basis().__getitem__, codomain=D)
sage: C.register_embedding(phi)
sage: D(C.basis()['a']).parent()
Free module generated by {'a', 'b', 'c'} over Rational Field
```
It only freezes `register_embedding` when you invoke the coercion framework directly:

```
sage: psi = C.module_morphism(E.basis().__getitem__, codomain=E)
sage: psi.register_as_coercion()
```

> - similarly, when writing a new class of algebras (in my case I was trying to build one on top of Cartesian products of algebras), and you want to use your own coercion from the base ring, you have to resort to the ugly `_no_generic_basering_coercion` hack.


In some ways that is a workaround, but it also gives you finer control.

IMO, ambiguity is the correct thing. They are different representations of the same parent, and in general, why should one be preferred over the other? For PBW bases here, the natural monomial basis is "better" in some sense, but since you created the special PBW basis, you probably want the PBW. What about for things like symmetric functions or Iwahori-Hecke algebras that have several bases that all sit on equal footing?

Excuse a little theatrics, but my first thought was, "that's horrifying". I believe I understand why this happens, but I feel that is more of a problem of a bad caching mechanism in the coercion framework. It also puts a much heavier burden on someone writing code because you will have to avoid all coercion cycles.

My initial thought is also that you cannot get around this by specifying conversion maps because it puts the other parent as the key. I could see it making the non-coercion direction slower if the inverse map was implemented by inverting one a `ModuleMorphismByLinearity`, used caching of elements (this might be a memory leak in and of itself), or some other form of needing to create a morphism. It also would make the code of `_element_constructor_` much more complicated with extra cases, especially when a mathematical object has a lot of realizations.

I am now working on a more minimal solution.  After splitting off part of it into #29225, I realised that time has progressed by exactly 10<sup>4</sup> tickets...

I think your `_lmul_` can create elements in the parent that are not actually suppose to be in the parent. Specifically, `_cartesian_product_of_elements` does not do any safety checking (nor do I think it should as it is meant to be called internally with safe input). So in your example, if you instead multiplied by `1/5`, I think you get an element of `B` that is not in `B`.

Do Jordan algebras still need the `_no_generic_basering_coercion`? Can we also get rid of it for matrix spaces and polynomial rings?

Also why should we allow for `base_ring is None` in `__init_extra__` to be valid? I feel like if we get to that point and there is no base ring, then it is a bug (as we have declared the syntax of the base ring must be setup during the `__init__` call) and it should result in an error.

It doesn't seem this happens, because `_lmul_()` itself is also called with safe input:

Yes, but I prefer to do this on a separate ticket.  For Jordan algebras it is trivial, for matrix algebras it requires adding a one-line `_coerce_map_from_base_ring()` method, but for polynomial rings it is somewhat less trivial.

The error reported in this ticket occurs inside an `__init_extra__()` method.  The problem is that in cases where the base ring is initialised by the category (as it is for Cartesian products), it is also done in an `__init_extra__()` method, and in this case the `__init_extra__()` of unital algebras is called before the `__init_extra__()` of Cartesian products.

Ah, I see the issue. The categories of Cartesian products of modules is incomparable (in the poset category) with unital algebras. However, this is an argument for keeping a (cached) method `base_ring` that also sets `_base` in the category as `base_ring()` should be callable and initialized after `__init__` has run.

Yes, this has more to do with automatically constructing the "right" parent as in push-outs and functorial constructions.

The problem is that in cases where the base ring is initialised by the category (as it is for Cartesian products), it is also done in an `__init_extra__()` method, and in this case the `__init_extra__()` of unital algebras is called before the `__init_extra__()` of Cartesian products.  The order in which the `__init_extra__()` methods of the various categories are called is determined by the method resolution order; since this is dynamically constructed by the category framework, I think it will be hard to come up with a robust way of always getting the order correct, so I think it is better to be flexible and have `_coerce_map_from_()` as a fallback, allowing us to retry registering the coercion after all `__init_extra__()` methods have run.

Yes, exactly.
> However, this is an argument for keeping a (cached) method `base_ring` that also sets `_base` in the category as `base_ring()` should be callable and initialized after `__init__` has run.

I don't think there is a problem here; the `__init_extra__()` methods are called as the last thing in `Parent.__init__()`, so after `__init__()` has finished, everything has been set up.
> The other option that comes to my mind would be to explicitly call the `UnitalAlgebras.CartesianProducts.__init_extra__` when `base_ring is None` as a way of stating we are forcing the ordering of the categories that should be; we would also make this the first `if` statement in that block. What do you think?

I don't like this very much; it sounds like an ad-hoc way of enforcing a certain order different from the method resolution order.  Also, this would mean that `UnitalAlgebras.CartesianProducts.__init_extra__()` would be called twice.

Side note: A slight inconsistency I noticed

```
sage: ZZ.coerce_map_from(ZZ)
Identity endomorphism of Integer Ring
sage: coercion_model.discover_coercion(ZZ, ZZ)
(None, None)
sage: coercion_model.discover_coercion(ZZ, QQ)
((map internal to coercion system -- copy before use)
 Natural morphism:
   From: Integer Ring
   To:   Rational Field, None)
sage: QQ.coerce_map_from(ZZ)
Natural morphism:
  From: Integer Ring
  To:   Rational Field
```
but since `discover_coercion` is meant to be more internal-use only, this isn't anything that we need to fix IMO.

You can try removing it.  If that doesn't work, you can implement a `_coerce_map_from_base_ring()` method; see the branches attached to this ticket and to #29247 for some examples.  I think it is possible to make `_coerce_map_from_base_ring()` return `None` in case you really don't want a coercion map.

In this case, that happens because `_no_generic_basering_coercion` was kept in place in this ticket and was only removed in #29247.

I think it is possible to make `_coerce_map_from_base_ring()` return `None` in case you really don't want a coercion map.


Thank you!

As it turns out, removing the attribute did work in my application.
