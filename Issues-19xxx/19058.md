Looks good, but the patchbot still doesn't like it. I "kicked" it, let's see if it works. Also, don't you think that people may expect to find 

```
+   sage/plot/plot3d/parametric_surface
+   sage/plot/plot3d/implicit_surface
```
in "Function and Data Plots" instead of "Basic Shapes and Primitives"?
