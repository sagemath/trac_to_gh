One kind of warning which appears a lot in Cython-generated code is unused functions or variables. Such warnings also appear in external Cython packages which use Sage. Therefore, this ticket proposes to compile Python with `-Wno-unused` which is then passes down to all Python packages.

Currently, the Sage library is compiled with `-w` which suppresses all warnings. I don't think that is a good idea because we might miss useful warnings. This ticket doesn't change that, but it will help to cut down the number of harmless "unused" warnings if we do change that.

I noticed something else strange: Python puts `CFLAGS` *before* its own flags like `-O3`. But there is also a variable `EXTRA_CFLAGS` which is put after Python's flags. Since we usually want user flags to override the package flags, we put the user's `CFLAGS` into `EXTRA_CFLAGS`.
