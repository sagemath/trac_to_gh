The current version (2.3.8) of `rpy2` packaged in Sage is too old to work with the current version of the Jupyter notebook

Manually upgrading to 2.7.4 (via `sage -pip install --upgrade rpy2` seems to work. However in also upgrades `six` (to `1.10.0-py2.py3-non-any.whl` (???) and `singledispatch` (but seems to use the current (cached) version).

I also get the following warning :

`    DEPRECATION: Uninstalling a distutils installed project (rpy2) has been deprecated and will be removed in a future version. This is due to the fact that uninstalling a distutils project will only partially uninstall the project.`

which I do not really understand....

New tarballs attached ; you may also download [rpy2](https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/r/rpy2/rpy2-2.7.5.tar.gz), [six](https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/s/six/six-1.10.0.tar.gz#md5=34eed507548117b2ab523ab14b2f8b55) and [singledispatch](https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/s/singledispatch/singledispatch-3.4.0.3.tar.gz#md5=af2fc6a3d6cc5a02d0bf54d909785fcb) directly from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

Extract from [this question](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/p2l0EUkSsOo) on sage-devel :

My pip upgrade showed me that this upgrade entails :

* an upgrade to `six`, which is already packaged in Sagemath (no problem)
* installing the `singledispatch` package, which is **NOT** packaged.

ISTR that, on sage-devel, it has been decided that a new package should remain optional for at least a year before becoming a standard package. If we follow this policy, the standard package rpy2 would depend on the optional package singledispatch. This seems a bit incoherent...

Another solution would be to keep the standard rpy2 package at 2.3.8, and have a rpy2-newer optional, depending on `singledispatch`. This seems a bit contrived, to say the least. Furthermore, I do not know how to proceed...

A third solution would be to silently include singledispatch in the source to rpy2. This "solution" seems to *guarantee* future incompatibilities.

What should I do ?

Bonus question : how to package rpy2 to signal that it depends on singledispatch ?

This version does the job (`%R` and `%%R` run OK in the Jupyter notebook).

Not yet ready for review, because :
* No documentation (yet) of this new interface
* not yet `ptestlong`'ed (and won't be until late tonight)...

Any suggestion on how to document the Jupyter interface ?

Passes `ptestlong` with no error.

I still haven't the foggiest idea about **where** to document the Jupyter interface. We need to mention four things at the very minimum :
* Load it with `%load_ext rpy2.ipython`.
* Line magic : `%R` (may take args to pass data from/to Sage).
* Cell magic : {{{%%R}} (idem).
* Help is available online.

By the way, the Jupyter notebook doesn't seem documented in the Sage documentation.

I honestly don't know where to document it in this case. You may have to try to stir things up on sage-devel.

The warning you get from `pip` is nothing to worry about. If I am not mistaken it is just complaining that you are uninstalling/upgrading something that wasn't installed with `pip` and that support for this will be discontinued (and rightly so, there is no sane way for `pip` to know it is doing a good job with the removal. `pip` as a package manager actually tracks the file installed, not so for stuff that has been installed with plain `distutils`).

Passes ptestlong when added to a pristine 6.10rc0 git clone.

Embryonic documentation added as an addendum to the r interface documentation.

It appears that, while useful in its present state, this work should be extended to a (re-)implementation of the R interface (our present implementation uses expect).

I shall question sage-devel and open another ticket for this.

Still requiring review.
