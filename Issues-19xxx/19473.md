```
Here is the semigroup algebra (over `QQ`) of the semigroup with two elements whose product is given by `x*y == y`:

```
sage: A = FiniteDimensionalAlgebra(QQ, [Matrix([[1,0],[1,0]]), Matrix([[0,1],[0,1]])])
sage: for x in A.basis():
    for y in A.basis():
        print x*y == y
....:         
True
True
True
True
```

Sage claims that it is unitary:

```
sage: A.is_unitary()
True
```
based on the following wrong concept:

```
        .. NOTE::

            If a finite-dimensional algebra over a field admits a left identity,
            then this is the unique left identity, and it is also a
            right identity.
```

On a slightly related note, the `table` method on `FiniteDimensionalAlgebra` returns mutable matrices, and mutating them corrupts the algebra.

The wrong claim "If a finite-dimensional algebra over a field admits a left identity, then this is the unique left identity, and it is also a right identity" is my fault (introduced in trac_12141_finite_algebras.patchâ€‹ at #12141).  I have no idea what I was thinking...

About the mutability: can't we just make the matrices in the table immutable using the `set_immutable()` method?

As far as I know there is no downside, but I'm not an expert either.

Instead of a list, we could return a tuple (or an immutable sequence).

I would get rid of the `copy` attribute, instead make this a `UniqueRepresentation` (or perhaps a `UniqueFactory` so we can better control the cache key), and make the table a tuple of immutable matrices that gets set by the `__classcall_private__`.

We also need to fix the category, which is wrong for non-associative, non-unital cases.

It seems to me that there are four mostly independent issues:
1. the wrong `is_unitary()` method;
2. the fact that the multiplication table is mutable;
3. determining the correct category;
4. implementing unique representation.
We could possibly fix issue 2 on this ticket (assuming it just takes a few lines), but also doing 3 and 4 on this ticket would be way too much in my opinion.  I would prefer just solving issue 1 on this ticket and opening separate tickets (possibly with dependencies) for issues 2, 3 and 4.

Indeed, I have now also convinced myself of this.  This means that we can replace

```python
    if sol1 == sol2:

One more thing. The definition

```
v = vector(k, (n - 1) * ([1] + n * [0]) + [1])
```
of `v` is one step back from the currently present definition

```
v = vector(Matrix.identity(k, n).list())
```
because it is far better for the entries of `v` to be defined as the zero/one elements of `R` rather than the ints `0` and `1`.
