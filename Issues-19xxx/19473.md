```
Here is the semigroup algebra (over `QQ`) of the semigroup with two elements whose product is given by `x*y == y`:

```
sage: A = FiniteDimensionalAlgebra(QQ, [Matrix([[1,0],[1,0]]), Matrix([[0,1],[0,1]])])
sage: for x in A.basis():
    for y in A.basis():
        print x*y == y
....:         
True
True
True
True
```

Sage claims that it is unitary:

```
sage: A.is_unitary()
True
```
based on the following wrong concept:

```
        .. NOTE::

            If a finite-dimensional algebra over a field admits a left identity,
            then this is the unique left identity, and it is also a
            right identity.
```

On a slightly related note, the `table` method on `FiniteDimensionalAlgebra` returns mutable matrices, and mutating them corrupts the algebra.

The wrong claim "If a finite-dimensional algebra over a field admits a left identity, then this is the unique left identity, and it is also a right identity" is my fault (introduced in trac_12141_finite_algebras.patchâ€‹ at #12141).  I have no idea what I was thinking...

About the mutability: can't we just make the matrices in the table immutable using the `set_immutable()` method?

As far as I know there is no downside, but I'm not an expert either.

Instead of a list, we could return a tuple (or an immutable sequence).

I would get rid of the `copy` attribute, instead make this a `UniqueRepresentation` (or perhaps a `UniqueFactory` so we can better control the cache key), and make the table a tuple of immutable matrices that gets set by the `__classcall_private__`.

We also need to fix the category, which is wrong for non-associative, non-unital cases.

    B1 = reduce(lambda x, y: x.augment(y),
                self._table, Matrix(k, n, 0))
    B2 = reduce(lambda x, y: x.augment(y),
                self.left_table(), Matrix(k, n, 0))

We can separate off the table issues into a separate ticket, that is okay with me. Want me to do that?

The other option would be to add boolean parameters that do checks in the initialization (which would require some minor refactoring if we wanted to go the `UniqueRepresentaion` route and would mean we do that on this ticket).

It seems to me that there are four mostly independent issues:
1. the wrong `is_unitary()` method;
2. the fact that the multiplication table is mutable;
3. determining the correct category;
4. implementing unique representation.
We could possibly fix issue 2 on this ticket (assuming it just takes a few lines), but also doing 3 and 4 on this ticket would be way too much in my opinion.  I would prefer just solving issue 1 on this ticket and opening separate tickets (possibly with dependencies) for issues 2, 3 and 4.

Indeed, I have now also convinced myself of this.  This means that we can replace

```python
    if sol1 == sol2:
        self._one = sol1

One more thing. The definition

```

```
of `v` is one step back from the currently present definition

```
v = vector(Matrix.identity(k, n).list())
