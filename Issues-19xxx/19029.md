This patch changes how the display manager pretty-prints plain Python integers:

```
sage: 1
1
sage: int(2)
int(2)
sage: len(['a', 'b', 'c'])
int(3)
sage: Set(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']).cardinality()
4
```

Note that the switch can easily be done with `sage -fixdoctests`.

+1 for doctest mode only. There are a lot of very used Python functions/methods that will still return Python int

```
sage: [1,2,3,1,2,1].count(2)
2
sage: len([1,1,1])
3
sage: "hahaheho".find("he")
4
```
It would be too verbose to me to have `int(...)` everywhere.

`int(1)` is consistent with the fact that you can rebuild objects from the string with `sage_eval`. That suggests a lighter marker: `1r`. What do you think?

But what that would mean? That the developer writes a testable example like

```
sage: foo()
int(42)
```

and the user will try `foo()` and get `42`? For a beginner it would be confusing. And for advanced user maybe irritating.

Float should be treated analogously, but not on this ticket.

`long` is gone in Python 3 so its going to go solve itself eventually.

BTW I don't think that we always have to return Sage ints; E.g. if a Python int/float is used as a label then I don't really care. But Sage functions that **count** something should return Sage integers as that number has a combinatorial / number theoretic meaning. Similarly, Sage functions that perform a machine-precision floating-point computation should return RDF.

... which already goes wrong on a rather fundamental level with a `__len__` (which *counts* the number of elements), which is mandated in python to return a machine-length integer to fit in the protocol it is for, and for efficiency reasons should return an `int` to avoid an extra conversion when `len(...)` is used.

```
sage: class A(object):
....:     def __len__(self):
....:         return 10^40
....:     
sage: a=A()
sage: len(a)
OverflowError: Python int too large to convert to C long
sage: a.__len__()
10000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```

I think this makes is rather hard to formulate a clear rule for when an `Integer` should really be returned.

To avoid that this ends in nothing. What about
- adding an something like --show-pyint / --show-pyfloat as an option for doctesting (not enabled by default) and maybe
- adding to the developer guide "you are encouraged to return Sage integers (instead of Python integers) unless ..... . The option --show-pyint might be useful."

It will still cause doctest failures not by default, so it's still a bad idea.

Hmm... Is it possible to have some kind of debug mode, so that every output would be started with type? But I can see no easy way to do it. A decorator over `__repr__` somehow?

Of course for a one function you could have a test block

```
g1 = Graph({})  # Empty
g2 = Graph({1:[2]})  # Not empty
type(g1.order()) == type(g2.order())
```

and so on. But the basic question remains: is it an error to have, for example, poset `width()` and `height()` return a different type? Should every `cardinality()`-like function return Sage Integers, and if so, what to do with `len` etc.?
