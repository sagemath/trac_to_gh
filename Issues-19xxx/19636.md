I would think this is as intended. If an object isn't loaded already, then how can it be looked up? I don't think `import_statements` was ever meant to support the same kind of search that `search_src` does. Its documentation certainly makes it seem that way: The included doctest for `EnumeratedSetFromIterator` certainly seems to test exactly the behaviour the tickets reports.

Close as invalid/won'tfix?
