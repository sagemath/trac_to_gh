Compute the forward and inverse images for projective subschemes under projective morphisms.

The forward image can be computed with an elimination calculation and the preimage is simply composition with the map.

This includes orbit() and nth_iterate() functions for subschemes.

Hello,

1. Could you split the documentation strings into a **one line** description followed by a paragraph.

2. For the input, I would prefer to follow the Python conventions

- `x.orbit(f, 3)` -> `[x, f(x), f^2(x)]`
- `x.orbit(f, 2, 5)` -> `[f^2(x), f^3(x), f^4(x)]`

  In other words having a `def orbit(self, f, n, m=None)`.

3. Is there really a need for that many functions:

- `orbit` (this is achieved by a simple loop)
- `nth_iterate` (this is more or less equivalent to `.orbit(f, (n,n+1))`).
- `forward_image` (this is more or less equivalent to `.orbit(f, (0,1))`)... and why not using `f(self)` here? If this is needed by call, then it could be a private method `_forward_image`.
- `preimage` (this should be equivalent to `.orbit(f, (-1,0))`)
- `__call__`

1) I will update the docs.

2) hmm..I was matching the inputs that are used for the orbit function for affine and projective points. I was not aware of the python conventions covering such a situation. If we follow them here, then the other functions should be changed to match. This is fine by me, but I'll make the other function changes in a separate ticket.

3) `orbit` returns a list of points and `nth_iterate` returns a single point. I use the functions separately as they exists for points, so I continued the separation here.

`forward_image` is used by call and I debated making it private or not. I think with `nth_iterate` existing, I can make this private.

Replying to [@bhutz](#comment%3A7):
> 2) hmm..I was matching the inputs that are used for the orbit function for affine and projective points. I was not aware of the python conventions covering such a situation. If we follow them here, then the other functions should be changed to match. This is fine by me, but I'll make the other function changes in a separate ticket.

I see. Then for the sake of this ticket I guess it is better to follow the convention of the other dynamical functions. The advantage of the Python way is that it is faster to parse the argument (less type checking and avoid tuple constructions) and you have the property that

```
orbit(n1,n2) + orbit(n2,n3) == orbit(n1,n3)
```
Please let it for a later ticket (if you have time).

> 3) `orbit` returns a list of points and ...

The only draw back I see is the multiplication of methods! I do not claim that any of them is useless.

> `forward_image` is used by call and I debated making it private or not. I think with `nth_iterate` existing, I can make this private.

On the other hand, `nth_iterate` is very hard to found with tab-completion. If I would choose one name, I would go for `forward_image` (with an optional argument `order`). For word morphism (maps of the free monoid) there is an optional argument in `__call__`

```
sage: s = WordMorphism('a->ab,b->ba')
sage: s('a')
word: ab
sage: s('a', 5)
word: abbabaabbaababbabaababbaabbabaab
```
But of course you can not found `__call__` with tab completion. But as it is a word morphism is a function it is natural to use the `my_map(x)` syntax instead of `x.forward_image(my_map)`. And actually, there is also

```
sage: w = Word('ab')
sage: w.apply_morphism(s)
word: abba
```
I guess it would be good to unify the terminology here...

> using `orbit` for preimages is a little shaky in my opinion. The forward images are single points(or varieties) but the preimages are collections of points (or varieties).

You are right, I was thiking of bijective maps for which bi-sided orbits make sense.

> Allowing something like `x.orbit(-2,2)` would return quite a strange object. So, I see this functionality as different. In the special case of automorphisms, using `orbit` for both would make sense, but I don't think it does in general.

This should be definitely disallowed in general!

<a id='comment:11'>Comment 11:</a>
- In your first commit, you completely removed the file `schemes/generic/morphism.py`. Why is so?

- test the error that are raised. And to fit with Python standards that was discussed on sage-devel, the error message should be lower case with no ponctuation at the end like the following

```
sage: [][1]
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
IndexError: list index out of range
```

- change `if (isinstance(N,(list,tuple)) == False)` to `if not isinstance(N, (list,tuple))`. Similarly, change `if normalize == True` with `if normalize`.

- In

```
+        except TypeError:
+            raise TypeError("Orbit bounds must be integers")
```
   or

```
+        except TypeError:
+            raise TypeError("Iterate number must be an integer")
```
   there is no need to catch a `TypeError` to raise a `TypeError`.

- Why are you using a copy of `self` in `orbit`?

- `a proejctive subscheme` -> `projective`. Moreover the output is **not** a projective subscheme but a list!

- What is this line in the documentation of `orbit`

```
Perform the checks on subscheme initialization if ``check=True``
```

- The mention to `self` in the documentation should be avoided as much as possible. You can replace by `this scheme`.

- You can simplify a bit the following in `nth_iterate`

```
+        if n == 0:
+            return(self)
+        else:
+            Q = f(self)
+            for i in range(2,n+1):
+                Q = f(Q)
+            return(Q)
```
  with

```
Q = self
for i in range(n):
    Q = f(Q)
return Q
```

- to make a list of zeros use `[0] * n` instead of `[0 for _ in range(n)]`.

- In `preimage` you wrote `return the subscheme` why is this unique? why it does exist? The following looks fishy

```
sage: PS.<x,y,z> = ProjectiveSpace(ZZ, 2)
sage: H = End(PS)
sage: f = H([x^2, x^2, x^2])
sage: X = PS.subscheme([x-y])
sage: X.preimage(f)
Closed subscheme of Projective Space of dimension 2 over Integer Ring defined by:
  0
sage: f(X.preimage(f))
Closed subscheme of Projective Space of dimension 2 over Integer Ring defined by:
  y - z,
  x - z
```

yes, your example is an issue. I'll need to add a check that the map is a morphism otherwise lots of strange things can happen.

Corrections made. I guess I was just being overly cautious with the copy. It seems to work fine without (i.e., self remains unchanged).

I greatly increased the spectrum of failure testing as well.

Also, I was overly ambitious in my coercing in `__call__` so I scaled that back slightly. I was able to produce a weird behavior with the example in algebraic_scheme.py line 2472. That example now raises an error.

As for generic/morphism.py. I couldn't find anything locally that was causing the deletion. Looking at each commit individually (locally and on trac), nowhere was it removed. Now that I've pushed these new commits up the issue seems to have gone away. I guess trac was just confused...

<a id='comment:16'>Comment 16:</a>
`from copy import copy` is not needed anymore in `algebraic_scheme.py`. There exists a very nice python tool for that

```
$ pyflakes src/sage/schemes/generic/algebraic_scheme.py 
src/sage/schemes/generic/algebraic_scheme.py:133: 'copy' imported but unused
src/sage/schemes/generic/algebraic_scheme.py:140: 'is_MPolynomialRing' imported but unused
src/sage/schemes/generic/algebraic_scheme.py:3238: local variable 'n' is assigned to but never used
```
On the other hand there is still a `copy` in `projective_point.py`.

About my comment about multiplication of methods, the code in `nth_iteration` is an exact copy paste of a portion of `orbit`...

Another oneliner simplification

```
dict = {}
for i in range(codom.dimension_relative()+1):
    dict.update({R.gen(i): f[i]})
```
can be written as

```
dict = {R.gen(i): f[i] for i in range(codom.dimension_relative()+1)}
```

I have no real competence to check the mathematical validity of the code. If you want somebody else to review that part you might ask on sage-devel.

<a id='comment:21'>Comment 21:</a>
It is better to make the keyword apparent in the function as in

```
def f(param1=True, param2=False):
    ....
```
instead of

```
def f(**kwds):
    param1 = kwds.get('param1', True)
    param2 = kwds.get('param2', False)
    ...
```
The reason is that with the former the tab completion works and you can see the list of keywords from the function signature.

There is still a

```
if (isinstance(N,(list,tuple))==False):
```
that should be replaced with

```
if not isinstance(N,(list,tuple)):
```
