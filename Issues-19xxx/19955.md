This ticket is abandoned as computing with resultants is too slow.

Original description

This is a follow up of #19954 where we:
- create a new descriptor `ANRootRational` as a descriptor for roots of **irreducible** polynomials with **rational** coefficients
- write exactification code to go from `ANRoot` to `ANRootRational` (i.e. go from a `QQbar` polynomial anihilator to the minimal polynomial over `QQ`)
- get rid of `ANUnaryExpr` and `ANBinaryExpr` and use the code from #18356 for addition/subtraction/multiplication/division of anihilator polynomial or minimal polynomial

We might want to force elements of small degrees to lies into number fields (possibly using a global threshold value).

This is part of the task #18333.

#24503 is indeed what I intended to do first. That is moving the numerical part of polynomial root evaluation to the real/complex lazy fields.

And on the other hand, computing with resultants is by far too slow if you work with a fixed number field of degree < 10.

Looks reasonable to me.
