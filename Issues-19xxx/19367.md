Apparently, we have

```
vertices = [(1,1,-1,-1,-1),(-1,-1,1,1,-1),(1,-1,-1,-1,1),(-1,1,1,1,1),(1,-1,1,-1,-1)]
p = LatticePolytope(vertices)
print p.vertices_pc()
print lattice_polytope.positive_integer_relations(p.vertices_pc().column_matrix())
TypeError: unable to make sense of Maxima expression '"Problemnotfeasible!"' in Sage
```
as reported [here](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/29797/non-negative-integer-relations-on-vertices/).  We should deal with this error message more appropriately.
