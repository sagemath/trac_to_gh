For planar graphs, you can get [faces listed](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/graphs/sage/graphs/generic_graph.html#sage.graphs.generic_graph.GenericGraph.faces), but you can't just get the number of faces like you can get `num_edges()`.  But this seems reasonable, with proper documentation.

Thanks for making this contribution. Here are some comments on what you will need to do in order to get this into Sage:

- It's a good idea to not remove the raw string formatting (i.e., the `r` before a string) unless there is a specific reason to do so. Even more so when it is in a part unrelated to the ticket.
- Similarly, it's not a good idea to add whitespace in a place unrelated to the ticket.
- You should try to conform to PEP8 as much as possible.
- You need to also make the one-line documentation a declarative statement.
- You also need a blank line after `TESTS::`.
- I don't see a reason to catch the `ValueError` being thrown by `faces`.

Thus, I would make the following changes:

```diff
-    def num_faces(self,embedding = None):
+    def num_faces(self, embedding=None):
         """
-        Returns the number of faces of an embedded graph.
+        Return the number of faces of an embedded graph.
 
         EXAMPLES::
 
             sage: T = graphs.TetrahedralGraph()
             sage: T.num_faces()
             4
 
         TESTS::
+
             sage: G = graphs.CompleteMultipartiteGraph([3,3])
             sage: G.num_faces()
             Traceback (most recent call last):
             ...
             ValueError: No embedding is provided and the graph is not planar.
 
         """
 
-        try:
-            return len(self.faces(embedding))
-        except ValueError as e:
-            raise ValueError(e)
+        return len(self.faces(embedding))
```
Personally I don't like the blank lines around the `"""`, especially on both sides, but that is much more a stylistic thing.
