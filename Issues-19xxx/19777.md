Andries Brouwer's database has been updated, and this ticket forwards the changes to Sage's copy of it.

4 graphs have been added to it, 3 of which are built from 2-intersection codes. The last one comes from a reference I haven't been able to find yet.

a 2-intersection code is a projective 2-weight code:
e.g. take L from `SRG_1024_363_122_132()` and do

```
sage: K = GF(2**2,'x')
sage: x = K.gens()[0]
sage: L = [map({'0':0,'1':1,'a':x,'b':x**2}.get,xx) for xx in L]
sage: L = Matrix(K,map(list,L)).transpose()
sage: c = LinearCode(L); c
Linear code of length 121, dimension 5 over Finite Field in x of size 2^2
sage: [w for w,f in enumerate(c.weight_distribution()) if w and f]
[88, 96]
sage: c.weight_enumerator()
x^121 + 660*x^33*y^88 + 363*x^25*y^96
```
so you have 0 word, 660 words of weight 88, and 363 of weight 96.

It seems that k will be one of eigenvalue multiplicities of the "usual" graph. I.e. often the same, e.g. for data on this ticket they are the same, but not always --- that's where formulae on Chen's page go wrong. One of these f, g:

```
    # multiplicity of eigenvalues 'r,s' (f=lambda_r, g=lambda_s)
    #
    # They are integers (checked by the 'integrality condition').
    f = -k*(s+1)*(k-s)/((k+r*s)*(r-s))
    g =  k*(r+1)*(k-r)/((k+r*s)*(r-s))
```
Details are in http://pages.uoregon.edu/kantor/PAPERS/2-WeightCodes.pdf.

Do you mean a procedure to give possible parameters of a projective 2-weight code from (v,k,l,mu)?
 
Anyway, a part of the job is to move these L's and the related info into the two-weight code database.

I mean a way to use the "SRG from 2 intersection" routine on the two-weight code instead of the current function we use. It's much faster, but if we do that we don't know how to predict which parameters we will end up with.

> Anyway, a part of the job is to move these L's and the related info into the two-weight code database.


True but that leaves an unpleasant feeling of just not doing what needs to be done.

I thought we don't have this implemented for the  two-weight code graph on its words, do we?

Here we are in a better shape: there are formulas from Cor.3.7 of Calderbank-Kantor, written also on on Eric Chen's pages.
My understanding is that they give the parameters of  "SRG from 2 intersection".
(or perhaps its complement - this is easy to figure out).
This will answer the question 

"is there a 2-intersection proj. set giving (v,k,l,mu)-SRG".   **(A)**

---

To get the parameters of the graph of codewords of the corresponding 2-weight code, one needs the duality of assoc. schemes (Thm 5.7 and the discussion after it in Calderbank-Kantor). 
It is easy to compute them directly from graph parameters (via eigenvalues etc).
I'd be happy to provide an implementation of it.
Thus, to answer the question 

"is there a 2-weight code giving (v,k,l,mu)-SRG"  **(B)**, 

one will compute the parameters (v,k',l',mu') of the dual (note that A==dual(dual(A)), and answer **(A)** for (v,k',l',mu'). Then use Thm 3.1 (p.100, same text), which tells one how to switch between (n,k,h_1,h_2) and parameters of the corresponding 2-weight code.

above is the plan, what do you think about it?

Here is my answer, as an admittedly cleaner commit.

If you know how to find your way in order to make `strongly_regular_from_two_weight_code(L)` as fast as `strongly_regular_from_two_intersection_set(L.transpose())`, we will definitely have gained something `O_o`

Sorry, I forgot that that DB gets processed a _build_small_srg_database() in its entirety. 
Now I looked at the code ans see that this is the case.

OK, I will speed it up. Where is the main slowness - is it in `strongly_regular_from_two_weight_code`, or in the main body of `_build_small_srg_database()` ?

The computations in the latter can be replaced by what I explained in comment 16.
I don't know how to speed up `strongly_regular_from_two_weight_code`, but in most 
cases (in particular for v=1024) it can be replaced by `strongly_regular_from_two_intersection_set`.

I did checks, and out of 22 entries in the 2-weight codes db, 18 are self-dual, that is
one can use `strongly_regular_from_two_intersection_set` on the transpose of their matrices
(more precisely, `strongly_regular_from_two_intersection_set` builds the complement of the graph,
but this is fine (we'd adjust doctests).

For the remaining 4 cases, I checked what one gets by using `strongly_regular_from_two_intersection_set` on the transpose of their matrices.

2-wt code of (512, 315, 202, 180)  gives the graph of GQ(7,9).

2-wt code of (512, 219, 106, 84)  gives (512, 73, 10, 12)
and correspondingly 
2-wt code of (512, 73, 12, 10)   gives  (512, 219, 106, 84)
(that is, it suffices to use just one of these 2-wt codes to get graphs)

2-wt code of (243, 220, 199, 200)  gives (243, 110, 37, 60)
(that is, `SRG_243_110_37_60()` can be removed, or not just used...)

PS. (for a follow-up ticket?) I don't see why the 2-wt codes database does not store the complete weight enumerator, but
computes it all the time from scratch. As well, one should be aware of the corr. function:

```
sage: L=LinearCode(M); L
Linear code of length 65, dimension 4 over Finite Field of size 5
sage: e=L.weight_enumerator(); e
x^65 + 364*x^15*y^50 + 260*x^10*y^55
```
allows one to get all the needed info without going through the code explicitly:

```
sage: e.substitute(x=1)
260*y^55 + 364*y^50 + 1
sage: e.substitute(x=1).coefficients()
[260, 364, 1]
sage: map(lambda x:x[1], e.substitute(x=1).exponents())
[55, 50, 0]
```

Could you:

1) Define what the '1s eigenmatrix' is, or point toward somewhere which defines it?

2) This function has no reason to be a 'cdef' function, given that it calls high-level functions like 'matrix'. You don't save anything with the 'cdef', and removing it will enable you to add doctests.

3) Why should we keep `SRG_243_110_37_60` if you say that we don't use it, and that we obtain the same graph by another way?

4) Could you add in the code an indication/reference for this new filter:

```
if 1+f+g != v: # the only other eigenvalue, k, has multiplicity 1'
```

All other filters should already have such a reference

5) I'm a bit worried about this new filter: does it discard any new entry? I thought that the filters we had already matched Andries Brouwer's database.

6) Instead of `[function, M.transpose()]` could you use `[lambda x:function(x.transpose()), M]` ? The difference is that the first computes the transpose when it is run, while the other only does it when it is called.

Thanks,

Nathann

P.S.: I rebased the branch atop of the latest release, and merged your two commits

well, it's a seemingly different construction; should we move it into `smallgraphs`?

well, it is just common sense; the adjacency matrix has 3 different eigenvalues, one of which is
k, of multiplicity 1 (and this is a classical fact about eigenvalues of nonnegative matrices), 
and the other two are r and s, with multiplicities f and g. Naturally, one must have 1+f+g=v.

By the way, the reference for 'Integrality condition' (integrality of f) is very vague - I don't know whether it is meant to be [BCN89]_, and if yes, then where this is mentioned.
And why only f is checked, but not g?

perhaps it does not, but it is certainly correct, and takes care of integrality of g.

do you want me to keep working on the branch currently on the ticket?

Argggggg, no please not in smallgraphs.. Let's keep it where the others are.

I guess it's fine to keep it if you want: I keep forgetting that you have this idea in your head of having "several instances per set of parameters", while I'm just trying to 'save' Andries Brouwer's database.

Could you add a '# multiplicities of eigenvalues' somewhere ? `:-P`

Only because I am an illiterate idiot `:-P`

> By the way, the reference for 'Integrality condition' (integrality of f) is very vague - I don't know whether it is meant to be [BCN89]_, and if yes, then where this is mentioned.

If that bothers you, then surely you understand why I prefer to have clear references for those filters `:-P`

> perhaps it does not, but it is certainly correct, and takes care of integrality of g.


Okay okay. For the sake of symmetry.

> do you want me to keep working on the branch currently on the ticket?


I am a dangerous and forgetful idiot, and I forgot to push the branch. It is done, sorry for the delay and if you have anything tricky to rebase because of it please give me the branch's name and I will do it for you.

Some remarks about your commit:

1) Thank you for the added info in the docstring of 'eigenmatrix'. I won't lie and say that I get all of it, but I know that the fault lies in my restricted knowledge and not in the doc. I really should hit those books `:-/`

2) replacement `k+r*s==mu` -- is that true in general? Is it checked anywhere in the code, and should we check it?

3) I am not sure that I understand how exactly this second eigenmatrix works. If `em==cinv*emi*cinv`, are you sure that there exists a strongly regular graph whose eigenmatrix is `vP^(-1)`? Or is it only because we are obtaining this SRG from a 2-intersection set? In general, when are you sure that the other strongly regular graph exists from only looking at the value of `vP^(-1)`?

Thm 9.1.3(ii) in [BH12]_ tells you how to get mu and  l from r and s. In particular indeed `k+r*s==mu`. It is basically a consequence of the fact that r and s are roots of a quadratic equation, with coefficients being linear functions of l and m (and then the coefficients are symmetric -- see, swapping s and r doesn't change things here -- functions of the roots, as every algebraist since Galois knows...)

in this case `vP^(-1)` corresponds to the complement of the original graph.
As the original graph exists, its complement exists, too...

> Or is it only because we are obtaining this SRG from a 2-intersection set? In general, when are you sure that the other strongly regular graph exists from only looking at the value of `vP^(-1)`? 


It does exist if the graph has a regular group of automorphisms (in particular for graphs from
2-wt codes/projective 2-intersection sets this is the case). Then the dual graph comes from taking elements of this group as vertices, and some nontrivial way to define adjacency among them...

> I wonder how general this thing is, and if it is specific to two-weight codes or if it belongs somewhere else.


well, yes, it is more general, but not by too much...
