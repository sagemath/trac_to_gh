You should write `| $(SAGERUNTIME)` in the dependencies. That means that `giac` will be built after the Sage runtime, but not *rebuilt* every time that the Sage runtime gets rebuilt.

And don't forget your name as author.

Thank you for the Hint. I have found only sagetex depending on SAGERUNTIME, 
so should I try to remove this dependency in spkg-install?

I think that the guilty  is the following:

```
#############################################################
#   Build dir for the pexpect interface
#############################################################
# create the script_subdirectory for the pexpect giac interface by running a trivial instruction
sage -c "giac(1)"
```
but I wonder if it is still usefull? (I can run the first pexpect giac interface session with the binary  sage tarball 6.9 without the ownership of the sage install)

I don't mind to keep that command, it also works as a test that `giac` works.

But if you prefer to review it now it is OK for me.

So for my first test with sage 6.10beta7 I got the following PB:
I was able to built giacpy but not with the check option because
some prettyprint in sympy was not found.
make sympy solved the problem.

Should sympy be a dep of giacpy?
