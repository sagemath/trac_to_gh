* Move the current functionality of `sage -i` to `sage -p` (without any functional changes).
* Add a new implementation for `sage -i` which installs new-style packages with dependencies.
* Make `sage -f` equivalent to `sage -i -f`, which installs dependencies and force-reinstalls a package.

For documentation changes, see #18859.
