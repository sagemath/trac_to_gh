As part of cleaning up library interfaces, clean up `eclib`:

1. Move all declarations for `eclib` library functions to `src/sage/libs/eclib/__init__.pxd`.

2. Use the C++ capabilities of Cython, in particular use `cdef cppclass`.

3. Move (with deprecation) the library interface from `src/sage/libs/mwrank` and `src/sage/libs/cremona` to `src/sage/libs/eclib`.

There are no functional changes at all.

I have commented at the upstream Issue, but I would not call this a bug.  The build system  causes all the code to be compiled with a certain macro defined (namely NTL_ALL), and the code will not build without that flag being defined, but the build system does not allow any way for that macro not to be defined anyway!

It's at least a *documentation* bug (it's not true that `NTL_ALL` is the default).

Which "build system" are you talking about and why do you claim that "the build system does not allow any way for that macro not to be defined"

It seems that simply changing the order of `#include "eclib/moddata.h"` causes this doctest failure.

does not allow any way for that macro not to be defined"

There is no option to Configure which affects it.

moddata.h has nothing at all to do with elliptic curve isogenies!

First of all, tt's clear that all `eclib` interface code should be in one place, not split in `sage.libs.mwrank` and `sage.libs.cremona`.

Do you prefer to change both to `sage.libs.eclib`?
