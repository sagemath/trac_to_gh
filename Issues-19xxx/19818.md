As part of cleaning up library interfaces, clean up `eclib`:

1. Move all declarations for `eclib` library functions to `src/sage/libs/eclib/__init__.pxd`.

2. Use the C++ capabilities of Cython, in particular use `cdef cppclass`.

3. Move (with deprecation) the library interface from `src/sage/libs/mwrank` and `src/sage/libs/cremona` to `src/sage/libs/eclib`.

There are no functional changes at all.

It's at least a *documentation* bug (it's not true that `NTL_ALL` is the default).

Which "build system" are you talking about and why do you claim that "the build system does not allow any way for that macro not to be defined"

@@ -1,4 +1,14 @@
+As part of cleaning up library interfaces, clean up \`eclib\`:
 
+1. Move all declarations for \`eclib\` library functions to \`src/sage/libs/eclib/__init__.pxd\`.
+
+2. Use the C++ capabilities of Cython, in particular use \`cdef cppclass\`.
+
+3. Move (with deprecation) the library interface from \`src/sage/libs/mwrank\` and \`src/sage/libs/cremona\` to \`src/sage/libs/eclib\`.
+
+There are no functional changes at all.
+
+**Upstream bug found**: https://github.com/JohnCremona/eclib/issues/10
