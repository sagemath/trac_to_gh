The current implementation of modular forms for the Theta subgroup only
allows modular forms with integer orders at the cusp -1.
With this ticket all forms are supported, also forms with fractional order at the cusp -1.
In particular this includes the theta function / half-integer weight forms.

Also note that there is a correspondence between modular forms for the Theta subgroup
and modular forms for Gamma0(4). So in essence this ticket provides support for
classical half-integer weight modular forms (for Gamma0(4)) for all kind of analytic types:
cuspidal, holomorphic, weakly holomorphic, meromorphic and also quasi forms,
as ring or module elements and with a lot of powerful methods.

The ticket depends on the branch u/jj/rankin_cohen_bracket (#17909).

The ticket is essentially implemented.

Possible additional ideas:
- Kohnen plus spaces
- Eisenstein series
- basis/detection of forms for the direct sum for ep=1 and ep=-1
  (which corresponds to the Modularform space for Gamma0(4)).

Depends on #17909
