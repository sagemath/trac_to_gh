```

wehlerK3:
I started looking at this line by line, but there are many repeating issues so I'll look at this file line-by-line after you make another pass.
- no spaces after ( or before )
- bilinear is spelled wrong many times

here are the first few instances of these:
- import spacing
- line 72 bilinear misspelled
- line 75: OUTPUT: :class:`WehlerK3Surface_ring`
- line 102: no space for (space 
- 106: bilinear
- 110 OUTPUT: :class:`WehlerK3Surface_ring`
- 118 wrap line
- 129: no spaces before/after (, )
- 135: bilinear
- 150, 159, 161, 163, 166, 168, 170, 173: paren space
- 182 output
- 199 paren space, no need for () around return
- 207 ``AttributeError``, True if point is on surface
- 243 paren space
- 245 need better one line description
- 249, 251, 261, 285, 287 paren space
- 291 better one line description

Here is what I saw in the other files:

space.py:
- is_ProduceProjectiveSpaces: shorter one line description
- 137: spaces
- 428 one line
- 443 ending punc
- 447 .
- 549 onthis
- 733 ``R``

point.py
- 82: spaces
- 99,103,107 ``i`` 
- 237 thid
- 294 ``t``
- 333: self
- 351: parameter spaces
- 373: , QQ
- 391 spaces
- 415 `n` -> ``N``, P is self, so this doc string needs to be reworded
- 417 n -> N, self/P are not right
- 424 self
- 457 spaces
- 460 codomain
- 461 N, space (

morphism.py
- 31 blank line before
- 78, 79, 90, 91: , QQ)
- 124,128,132 ``i``
- 188 , [1,1,1]
- 226 space
- 240 iff -> if and only if
- 323 thus -> this, n -> N
- 359: just start this with "This function..."
- 364 reducing -> reduce
- 389 codomain
