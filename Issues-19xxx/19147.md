This ticket implements affine connections on infinitely differentiable manifolds (i.e. smooth manifolds) . This is a follow-up of #19092 within the [SageManifolds project](http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/) (see the metaticket #18528 for an overview). As in #19092, the non-discrete topological field K over which the smooth manifold is defined is generic, although in most applications, K=**R** or K=**C**.

Affine connections are implemented via the Python class `AffineConnection`, the user interface being the method `DifferentiableManifold.affine_connection()`. At the user choice, CPU-demanding computations (like that of the curvature tensor) can be parallelized, thanks to #18100.

Various methods of the class `AffineConnection` allow the computation of
- the connection coefficients with respect to a given vector frame (from those w.r.t. another frame)
- the connection 1-forms with respect to a given vector frame
- the torsion tensor
- the torsion 2-forms with respect to a given vector frame
- the (Riemann) curvature tensor
- the curvature 2-forms with respect to a given vector frame
- the Ricci tensor
- the action of the affine connection on any tensor field
