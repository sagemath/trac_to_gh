Can you undo the changes to the `m4` files, it conflicts with #19298.

Initially I was afraid about the performance of running this `find` command all the time, but it's not really a problem.

Should we remove `./configure` from the developer's documentation? Probably yes.

On the other hand, if this branch makes `./configure` not needed, I don't see the point of keeping it in the manual: it's only confusing.
