```
The `cardinality_exhaustive` method can return incorrect results for genus 1 curves if they are given by `y^2 = f(x)` where f(x) is a quartic polynomial whose leading coefficient is not a square:

```
sage: ZZX.<x> = PolynomialRing(ZZ)
sage: f = 15*x^4 + 7*x^3 + 3*x^2 + 7*x + 18
sage: HyperellipticCurve(f.change_ring(GF(19))).cardinality_exhaustive(1)
20
sage: sum([legendre_symbol(u, 19) + 1 for u in [f(x) for x in range(19)] + [f[4]]])   # correct answer
19
```

Here is the offending code:

```
if g == 1:
        # elliptic curves always have one smooth point at infinity
        a += 1
```

The problem is that for the given model, the curve may not have a rational point at infinity.

I agree.  It should add 1 for odd degree and for even degree it should add 1+(a/q) where a is the leading coefficient and q the fields cardinality, assuming that q is odd.

Good question!    The reasoning in odd characteristic is this:   let f^* be the reverse polynomial forced to have even degree if deg(f) is odd by adding an extra factor of x.

Conclusion: when q is even always add 1, for all degrees.

A general hyperelliptic curve is given by *C*: *y*<sup>2</sup> + *h*(*x*)*y* = *f*(*x*); it seems to me that this fix is only correct if *h* = 0.  (Note: in characteristic 2 we cannot have *h* = 0, otherwise the curve would be singular everywhere.)

Take for example (over any finite field of characteristic not 11)

```
C: y^2 + y = x^3 - x^2      # 11a3, my favourite elliptic curve
D: w^2 + z^2*w = -z^2 + z
```
Then *C* and *D* are isomorphic via the change of variables

```
z = 1/x, w = y/x^2
```
The curve *C* has two points at *x* = 0, so *D* has two points at *z* = infinity.  Now consider

```
def test_C(p):
    R.<x> = GF(p)[]
    C = HyperellipticCurve(x^3 - x^2, 1)
    return C.count_points_exhaustive()

def test_D(p):
    S.<z> = GF(p)[]
    D = HyperellipticCurve(-z^2 + z, z^2)
    return D.count_points_exhaustive()
```
Running this for *p* = 2 and *p* gives

```
sage: test_C(2)
[5]
sage: test_D(2)
[4]
sage: test_C(3)
[5]
sage: test_D(3)
[3]
```
whereas all answers should be 5.

Should we fix this on this ticket or open a new one?
