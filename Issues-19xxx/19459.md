Containment testing catches `TypeError`, `ValueError`, `ZeroDivisionError`.
However, casting a Laurent series to a power series (when it isn't one)
raises an `ArithmeticError`. This fix makes the cast throw a `TypeError`
rather than an `ArithmeticError` to make the following code work:

```
L.<t> = LaurentSeriesRing(GF(2))
R.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(L)
O = L.power_series_ring()
S.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(O)
t**(-1)*x*y in S
```

This is probably the best solution; it is also consistent with rational functions.

There is no formal decision procedure; the author(s) and reviewer(s) should agree on a solution, and if nobody objects and the release manager agrees to close the ticket, then that is it.

I'd be surprised if there is any code that relies on `LaurentSeries.power_series()` raising an `ArithmeticError`, but then again, there may also be code that relies on `__contains__()` not catching `ArithmeticError`...  Anyway, I agree with Jeroen that a `TypeError` is best in view of consistency.

- There is a doctest failure; see the `shortlog` link in the patchbot report (click the yellow blob on the top right).
- Use the syntax `raise TypeError("bla")` instead of `raise TypeError, "bla"` in new or changed code; see the `plugins.raise_statements` link in the patchbot report.

I meant that I didn't expect code (either Sage code or external programs) to specifically depend on an `ArithmeticError`,  For a doctest that just exists to show that an error is raised for invalid input, it is certainly no surprise that it has to be adapted when the specific error changes...

One more thing: could you please add a reference to this Trac ticket in the doctest (using the syntax `:trac:`19459``)?

About your second point, I changed the code. Generally, I'm happy to follow the documentation I can find (so far mostly [http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html), which seems not really exhaustive).
