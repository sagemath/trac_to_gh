Currently taking the tensor product of dense cyclotomic matrices takes forever:

```
sage: R = CyclotomicField(2)
sage: M = matrix.random(R, 40,40)
sage: N = matrix.random(R, 3, 3)
sage: %time K = N.tensor_product(M)
CPU times: user 337 ms, sys: 20.6 ms, total: 358 ms
Wall time: 335 ms
sage: %time K = M.tensor_product(N)
CPU times: user 3.99 s, sys: 32.5 ms, total: 4.02 s
Wall time: 3.97 s
```
The tensor product code looses a lot of time in converting between its internal representation and the cyclotomic field entries. This ticket implements a custom `tensor_product` along with doing some other speedups with the internal workings.
