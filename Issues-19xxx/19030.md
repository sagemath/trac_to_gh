When constructing the isogeny class C of an elliptic curve (over Q or a number field) a partial matrix of maps between the curves is computed, available as C.isogenies().  However, some of the known maps were being overwriiten by 0 (used to indicate that the map was not known.

Example:

```
K.<a> = NumberField(x^2-2)
E = EllipticCurve([1, -1, 0, 3*a, -2*a - 2])
C = E.isogeny_class()
C.isogenies()
```
used to show only 2 nonzero entries, but now shows 4.

I did not add new doctests but two existing ones had to be changed, and these illustrate the improvement.

Why this matters:  it is important that there is a curve on the class from which you can get to every other curve by following the stored maps, for example to map across generators.  This was not the case i nthe above example, but now is.

When setting the "reverse" isogenies from the i'th curve to the j'th where we have seen the j'th before, the codomain is only a curve isomorphic to the j'the curve, not equal to it.  This does not arise over Q where all curves will have reduced minimal models, but does occur over number fields.

Example (after commit 0690288):

```
sage: K.<i> = NumberField(x^2+1)
sage: E = EllipticCurve([1, i + 1, 1, -72*i + 8, 95*i + 146])
sage: C = E.isogeny_class()
sage: curves = C.curves
sage: isos = C.isogenies()
sage: isos[0][3].codomain() == curves[3]
False
sage: isos[0][3].codomain().is_isomorphic(curves[3])
True
```

I will update the branch to fix this.

Good.  My code currently gets generators for one curve in the class from Magma and uses these stored isogenies to move them across to the others.  When I am done the points will be put into the LMFDB.  I am finishing up the saturation code before doing the upload (this is the old #8829 which will be up for review within a few days).  Thanks for taking the time to look at it.
