When constructing the isogeny class C of an elliptic curve (over Q or a number field) a partial matrix of maps between the curves is computed, available as C.isogenies().  However, some of the known maps were being overwriiten by 0 (used to indicate that the map was not known.

Example:

```
K.<a> = NumberField(x^2-2)
E = EllipticCurve([1, -1, 0, 3*a, -2*a - 2])
C = E.isogeny_class()
C.isogenies()
```
used to show only 2 nonzero entries, but now shows 4.

I did not add new doctests but two existing ones had to be changed, and these illustrate the improvement.

Why this matters:  it is important that there is a curve on the class from which you can get to every other curve by following the stored maps, for example to map across generators.  This was not the case i nthe above example, but now is.

Keywords: **isogeny class**

When setting the "reverse" isogenies from the i'th curve to the j'th where we have seen the j'th before, the codomain is only a curve isomorphic to the j'the curve, not equal to it.  This does not arise over Q where all curves will have reduced minimal models, but does occur over number fields.

Example (after commit 0690288):

```
sage: K.<i> = NumberField(x^2+1)
sage: E = EllipticCurve([1, i + 1, 1, -72*i + 8, 95*i + 146])
sage: C = E.isogeny_class()
sage: curves = C.curves
sage: isos = C.isogenies()
sage: isos[0][3].codomain() == curves[3]
False
sage: isos[0][3].codomain().is_isomorphic(curves[3])
True
```

I will update the branch to fix this.

:-) I was about to put a positive review to it. 

Just one question. What is the output of the example in the description suppose to be? I get that this curve is alone in its isogeny class with or without the patch.
