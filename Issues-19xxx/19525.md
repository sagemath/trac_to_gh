This ticket adds a proper error handler for GLPK (similar to what we already have for PARI, NTL, ...). It suffices to add `sig_on()`/`sig_off()` around a GLPK call to get an error message.

Some more cleanup is also done:
1. change the implementation of `MIPSolverException` to just inherit from `RuntimeError` without any custom implementation.
2. use `MemoryAllocator` in a few places to make some allocations safer.

This branch requires a patch to GLPK, a modified version of it was accepted upstream: [http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-glpk/2015-11/msg00008.html](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-glpk/2015-11/msg00008.html)

**Upstream:** Fixed upstream, in a later stable release.

**Reviewer:** Vincent Delecroix
