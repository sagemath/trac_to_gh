Changes the output to:

```
Type:            LazyImport

File:            ~/Code/sage.git/src/sage/misc/lazy_import.pyx
Docstring:
   A subset of the real line

   INPUT:

   Arguments defining a real set. Possibilities are either two real
   numbers to construct an open set or a list/tuple/iterable of
   intervals. The individual intervals can be specified by either a
   "RealInterval", a tuple of two real numbers (constructing an open
   interval), or a list of two number (constructing a closed
   interval).

   EXAMPLES:

      sage: RealSet(0,1)    # open set from two numbers
      (0, 1)
      sage: i = RealSet(0,1)[0]
      sage: RealSet(i)      # interval
      (0, 1)
      sage: RealSet(i, (3,4))    # tuple of two numbers = open set
      (0, 1) + (3, 4)
      sage: RealSet(i, [3,4])    # list of two numbers = closed set
      (0, 1) + [3, 4]
```

<a id='comment:10'></a>With this patch, `RealSet` *still* shows the wrong doc.

`RealSet` actually has no documentation:

```
class RealSet(UniqueRepresentation, Parent):

    @staticmethod
    def __classcall__(cls, *args):
```

So the only correct value for `RealSet.__doc__` is `None`, which is how it will be after #20626.
