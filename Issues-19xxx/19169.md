A modular form f has complex multiplication (cm) if there is a quadratic character \epsilon such that

a(p,f) = \epsilon(p)*a(p,f)

for all but finitely many primes p (those dividing the level of f).  (Here, a(p,f) are the Fourier coefficients of f.)  This patch creates a method for the modular forms class in Sage to test whether a given modular form has cm.  

I will post code shortly.

The code was ready to go as of September 2015, but I had trouble getting a working version of Sage downloaded onto my computer.  (I have very minimal experience with all things computer-related.)  I still have the file with the code in it, and I am happy to send it to anyone who wants to try getting it into Sage.  I don't have the time or expertise to try again.

I have two suggestions to make, though I did not get fast enough and see that there is now a positive review.
(1) You test all quadratic characters.  It would be enough to test those whose conductor's square divides the level.  And only odd characters (since it is *complex* multiplication).
(2) Before testing any characters I would do some local tests.  (I just implemented a similar thing for CM testing for elliptic curves, see #23454 -- in fact I found this ticket when doing a search before creating that one).   The idea is to compute `a_p<sup>2-4*p</sup>(k-1)` for a lot of good primes p for which a_p is nonzero.  If the form is CM these will all have the same square-free part, so non-CM forms will be eliminated very quickly, and for forms which pass this test, you would only have *one* character to test.

I am going to take the liberty of setting this back to needs_work but if someone wants to over-rule that and put it back to positive review, with a new ticket for what I have suggested, that is OK with me.

Hold it, the new code is *not* correct, because the assertion "if f has CM by chi, then the square of the conductor of chi divides the level" is not true; it only works for forms of trivial character (and even for those I'm a little wary about powers of 2). 

The simplest counterexample I could find was this one:

```
sage: G = DirichletGroup(21)          # note squarefree level
sage: eps = G.0 * G.1
sage: f = Newforms(eps,2)[0]; f
q + (-zeta6 - 1)*q^3 + (2*zeta6 - 2)*q^4 + O(q^6)
sage: [f[p] for p in prime_range(200) if kronecker_character(-3)(p) == -1]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

I suspect this won't make much difference in practice; the running time will be overwhelmingly dominated by the computation of Fourier coefficients anyway. 

However, I think the code can be much speeded up by not computing all the coefficients up to `bound` at once but rather doing this in a loop computing coefficients one at a time and checking them against the candidate characters; if doesn't have CM, then we will almost certainly spot this long before we get up to `bound`. One can also rule out some trivial cases early on (e.g. if there is any prime q which exactly divides the level and which doesn't divide the nebentype conductor, then f can't be CM).

Hi David, while you are correct (that is not a good way to iterate over the divisors of M), the authors are new contributors.  If we want to foster new developers it is perhaps better to phrase things so that they can learn better coding practices as opposed to making fun of them in a public forum.  Also, this is partially my fault as the original reviewer.  I should have caught this and mentioned a better way to iterate.

The Sage patch-bot (which automatically tests code from "needs review" tickets) seems to be ignoring this ticket. I suspect this is because it (stupidly) ignores code by new Sage users.

Hence I am **temporarily removing** most of the authors from the ticket "Authors" field. I am leaving Amy Feaver because the patchbot apparently knows who she is already.  The missing authors (Jaclyn Lang, Lubjana Beshaj, Michelle Kovesi) should be restored before this ticket is marked closed. 

Jaclyn, Lubjana, Michelle: please don't take this personally -- the patchbot is a strange and clunky piece of software!

This:

```
`self`

is wrong, and should be instead

```
``self``
```
If you feel you do not master the rst syntax, then you should build the doc and look at  it.

This is actually rather difficult to do if you don't have direct access to a machine powerful enough to run Sage; I do all my Sage hacking via SSH to a remote server, and reading the doc output is difficult under those circumstances. (There are tricks with HTTP over SSH tunnels etc, but it's fiddly to set up.)

It used to be possible at least to run the docbuild script and look at the output logs, but this has been made much more difficult by the switch to parallel building of the documentation: this has meant that the output of the docbuild script is now almost completely incomprehensible, with any ReST formatting error messages swamped in huge amounts of routine junk output. 

Anyway, I have uploaded a patch with precisely 3 bytes of changes, fixing the issues identified by the patchbot.

It won't, because of the two patchbot runs with the current version of the code, one succeeded and the other failed due to a totally unrelated error:

```
sage -t --long src/sage/graphs/matchpoly.pyx  # Timed out
```
Since this obviously has nothing to do with the present ticket I am interpreting your comment as a positive review.
