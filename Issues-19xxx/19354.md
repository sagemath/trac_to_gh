This is a container ticket for minor documentation typos found in version 6.9, to be fixed for 6.10. I'll add them here, if I am not doing another ticket for same part of Sage. Of course others can also make additions to this.

- `coding_in_python.rst`, links in "experimental" part broken.[This is the Trac macro *span* that was inherited from the migration called with arguments (style=background:)](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#span-macro)
- sage.rings.rational.integer_rational_power, output section. [This is the Trac macro *span* that was inherited from the migration called with arguments (style=background:)](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#span-macro)

- linear_extensions.html, broken link in first SEEALSO block. [This is the Trac macro *span* that was inherited from the migration called with arguments (style=background:)](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#span-macro)
- frank_network() on posets, `x \ge y` should be `p \ge q`.[This is the Trac macro *span* that was inherited from the migration called with arguments (style=background:)](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#span-macro)

- graphs.py, part "generators": somehow add a mention about `graphs()` there, like we now have `graphs(n)`. Add link to common graphs page.[This is the Trac macro *span* that was inherited from the migration called with arguments (style=background:)](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#span-macro)

digraphs:

OK.

There is

```
        * When ``certificate=True``:

            * If the graph is acyclic, returns a pair ``(True, ordering)``
              where ``ordering`` is a list of the vertices such that ``u``
              appears before ``v`` in ``ordering`` if ``u, v`` is an edge.
```

and I think that it should be

```
        * When ``certificate=True``:

          * If the graph is acyclic, returns a pair ``(True, ordering)``
            where ``ordering`` is a list of the vertices such that ``u``
            appears before ``v`` in ``ordering`` if ``u, v`` is an edge.
```

I.e. 2 spaces less, and so one level less in indentation.
