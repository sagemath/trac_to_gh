 This is a container ticket for minor documentation typos found in version 6.9, to be fixed for 6.10. I'll add them here, if I am not doing another ticket for same part of Sage. Of course others can also make additions to this.
 
 - `coding_in_python.rst`, links in "experimental" part broken.
+- sage.rings.rational.integer_rational_power, output section.
 
 - Someone can count only to two: `generic_graph.py`, `edge_cut` says "There are currently two different implementations - -" and then lists three. 
 - Add string "Graph realization problem" somehow to degree_sequences.py.

- A 3-tuple ` (`g`, ``rw``, ``signs``) ` misses a pair of ` around g.

- is_directed_acyclic on digraph.py, still too much indentation on output, see part "When certificate=True".

Otherwise I found no problems.

No, this is written ``g`` in the whole doc of the function, let us rather keep that.

I do not understand. How much indentation do you want ? 0 ?

OK.

There is

```
        * When ``certificate=True``:

            * If the graph is acyclic, returns a pair ``(True, ordering)``
              where ``ordering`` is a list of the vertices such that ``u``
              appears before ``v`` in ``ordering`` if ``u, v`` is an edge.
```

and I think that it should be

```
        * When ``certificate=True``:

          * If the graph is acyclic, returns a pair ``(True, ordering)``
            where ``ordering`` is a list of the vertices such that ``u``
            appears before ``v`` in ``ordering`` if ``u, v`` is an edge.
```

I.e. 2 spaces less, and so one level less in indentation.
