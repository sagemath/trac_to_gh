This is a container ticket for minor documentation typos found in version 6.9, to be fixed for 6.10. I'll add them here, if I am not doing another ticket for same part of Sage. Of course others can also make additions to this.

- `coding_in_python.rst`, links in "experimental" part broken.[[span(style=background:#000000;color: #00FF00, **✓**)]]
- sage.rings.rational.integer_rational_power, output section. [[span(style=background:#000000;color: #00FF00, **✓**)]]

- linear_extensions.html, broken link in first SEEALSO block. [[span(style=background:#000000;color: #00FF00, **✓**)]]
- frank_network() on posets, `x \ge y` should be `p \ge q`.[[span(style=background:#000000;color: #00FF00, **✓**)]]

- graphs.py, part "generators": somehow add a mention about `graphs()` there, like we now have `graphs(n)`. Add link to common graphs page.[[span(style=background:#000000;color: #00FF00, **✓**)]]

digraphs:

- is_directed_acyclic, too much indentation on output block [[span(style=background:#000000;color: #00FF00, **✓**)]]
- level_sets, too much indentation on output block [[span(style=background:#000000;color: #00FF00, **✓**)]]
- reverse_edges, vertical spacing in input block. [[span(style=background:#000000;color: #00FF00, **✓**)]]

in combinat/interval_posets (and elsewhere):

wrong formatting <code>,\`\`</code> in the first lines of `from_binary_trees` and `from_dyck_words` [[span(style=background:#000000;color: #00FF00, **✓**)]]

- A 3-tuple <code> (\`g\`, \`\`rw\`\`, \`\`signs\`\`) </code> misses a pair of ` around g.

- is_directed_acyclic on digraph.py, still too much indentation on output, see part "When certificate=True".

Otherwise I found no problems.

No, this is written <code>\`g\`</code> in the whole doc of the function, let us rather keep that.

I do not understand. How much indentation do you want ? 0 ?

OK.

There is

```
        * When ``certificate=True``:

            * If the graph is acyclic, returns a pair ``(True, ordering)``
              where ``ordering`` is a list of the vertices such that ``u``
              appears before ``v`` in ``ordering`` if ``u, v`` is an edge.
```

and I think that it should be

```
        * When ``certificate=True``:

          * If the graph is acyclic, returns a pair ``(True, ordering)``
            where ``ordering`` is a list of the vertices such that ``u``
            appears before ``v`` in ``ordering`` if ``u, v`` is an edge.
```

I.e. 2 spaces less, and so one level less in indentation.
