No, this is written ``g`` in the whole doc of the function, let us rather keep that.

OK.

There is

```
        * When ``certificate=True``:

            * If the graph is acyclic, returns a pair ``(True, ordering)``
              where ``ordering`` is a list of the vertices such that ``u``
              appears before ``v`` in ``ordering`` if ``u, v`` is an edge.
```

and I think that it should be

```
        * When ``certificate=True``:

          * If the graph is acyclic, returns a pair ``(True, ordering)``
            where ``ordering`` is a list of the vertices such that ``u``
            appears before ``v`` in ``ordering`` if ``u, v`` is an edge.
```

I.e. 2 spaces less, and so one level less in indentation.
