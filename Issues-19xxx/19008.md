There is a missing backstick at `generic_graph.py` in the documentation of `is_subgraph()`. This patch contains also some more polishing to that function.

Why is that

```diff
- Tests whether ...
+ Return ``True`` if ...
```
Your version is much less precise since you say nothing when the graph is not a subgraph. It is standard in Sage to write `Test Property X`. Of course you can remove the `s` (i.e. `Tests` -> `Test`) and remove the reference to `self`.

The rest looks fine.

is_planar() 	Test whether the graph is - -
is_circular_planar() 	Test whether the graph is - - 
is_regular() 	Return True if this graph is - -

On #18925 and #18941 I have used "return true if" -phrasing. That can of course be converted, but it should be uniform in all parts of the software. Was there some discussion about this in sage-devel?

I don't think so. And I agree with you that it would better be uniform.

> And btw, should every function document the output type? As an example, `has_bottom()` in posets is documented as "Return True if the poset has a unique minimal element." in the index of functions, and then "Return True if the poset has a unique minimal element, and False otherwise." in the function itself.

No. Neither the `INPUT` nor the `OUTPUT` sections are mandatory. If your function has simple `input/output` (like a `is_X(self)` method) then it is fine to include the specifications in the documentation. Otherwise it is up to the programmer to judge whether it is clearer with or without `INPUT/OUTPUT`.

Now there is at least explicit wording. I think that it is a place for another ticket to unify the documentation.

>> And btw, should every function document the output type?

> No. Neither the `INPUT` nor the `OUTPUT` sections are mandatory.

But developer guide says "This is not optional.": http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#documentation-strings . I think that this could be corrected. See #17693 comment 16.

Why ``self`` has been changed to poset? Since the function is about graphs and not about posets, the wording should be changed.
