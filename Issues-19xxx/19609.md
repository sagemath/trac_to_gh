It is definitely very usefull!
Just a few (maybe useless) remarks. The basis method usually returns a Family (Finite, Lazy or ...), may we want to do the same for the kernel instead of a tuple?
Also, we may want to document the choice of right kernel versus left kernel.

All of the other `*_basis` (like `radical_basis`) returned lists. I changed these to tuples because the output is cached (so should be immutable) and for consistency.

There was also an issue that I could not use cached methods on the morphisms because the equality test used `__dict__`. However, I decided to not make the results cached because if the basis order changed, then one can get different bases for the kernel/image, which may be desirable.

> Also, we may want to document the choice of right kernel versus left kernel.

I think there is only the right kernel because I chose to use the right matrix version and there is no ambiguity. Perhaps I'm not thinking of something...
