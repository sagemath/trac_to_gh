I intentionally use `field(0)` because I need to mutate the number. `field.zero()` is probably cached and that would break things.

Ideally, I would use `ComplexNumber.__new__()` but that's not properly supported. The way I'm writing `RealIntervalFieldElement.__cinit__()` should be done for more element classes. But I didn't feel like rewriting also the `ComplexNumber` constructor here.

It's used at least for constants, and it even works correctly:

```
sage: RIF(pi).endpoints()
(3.14159265358979, 3.14159265358980)
sage: RIF.pi().endpoints()
(3.14159265358979, 3.14159265358980)
