I intentionally use `field(0)` because I need to mutate the number. `field.zero()` is probably cached and that would break things.

Ideally, I would use `ComplexNumber.__new__()` but that's not properly supported. The way I'm writing `RealIntervalFieldElement.__cinit__()` should be done for more element classes. But I didn't feel like rewriting also the `ComplexNumber` constructor here.

Not a bug introduced here, but since you are cleaning up this code: I think

```
       elif isinstance(x, str):
           s = str(x).replace('..', ',').replace(' ','').replace('+infinity', '@inf@').replace('-infinity','-@inf@')
           if mpfi_set_str(self.value, s, base):
               raise TypeError("unable to convert {!r} to real interval".format(x))
```
should be

```
       elif isinstance(x, basestring):
           ...
```
or at least

```
       elif isinstance(x, (str, unicode)):
           ...

It's used at least for constants, and it even works correctly:

```
sage: RIF(pi).endpoints()
(3.14159265358979, 3.14159265358980)
sage: RIF.pi().endpoints()
(3.14159265358979, 3.14159265358980)
