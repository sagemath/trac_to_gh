```
In some tickets (eg #15024, #16813) this doctest from `symbolic/expression_conversions.py` 

```
            sage: foo = random_expr(20, nvars=2)
            sage: foo
            sage: s = ExpressionTreeWalker(foo)
            sage: bool(s() == foo)
```
fails because the set of functions returned by `random_expr` contains one of `floor`/`ceil` which currently don't accept the `hold` keyword:

```
sage: floor(x,hold=True)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-8-fc5809e0a430> in <module>()
----> 1 floor(x,hold=True)

TypeError: __call__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'hold'
```
This would affect any use of the walker or its subclasses on `floor` expressions.

The reason is that both functions handle their calls themselves (instead of relying on superclass functionality) because at the time it was deemed necessary to provide a keyword named `maximum_bits`.
