from https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!topic/sage-devel/awa0lNGJugo
Minimal version:

```
sage: a,b,c,d,e=var('a,b,c,d,e')
sage: (c/a - b*c^2/(a^2*(b*c/a-d)) + c*d/(a*(b*c/a-d))).normalize()
0
sage: (e + c/a - b*c^2/(a^2*(b*c/a-d)) + c*d/(a*(b*c/a-d))).normalize()
(a^2*b*c*e - a^3*d*e)/((b*c - a*d)*a^2)
```
This changed somewhere between 6.6 (output `e`) and 7.0.
