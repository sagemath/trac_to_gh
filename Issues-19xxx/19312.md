The next big Pynac update has:

* libgmp `bigint`s and `bigrat`s instead of `Integer` and `Rational` Python objects
* assumptions/domains can influence Pynac computation
* sync elementary assumptions on symbols/functions with Pynac (#19035)
* C++11 results in better code readability
* better decisions through more info flags and logic
* return `not implemented` and `undecidable` for some decisions (for math. logic changes see the #19040 description)
* add inexact flag for possible expansions / FP simplifications
* `abs()` expansion
* `function::info()`
* from GiNaC: Fix `pow(+(...),2).expand()`
* remove some unused files and other cleanup; add missing autoconf macro;
* some older memleaks closed

<a id='comment:4'></a>This works and can be reviewed independently on machines with gcc>=4.6, but please wait with setting positive for the build system changes (i.e., #19298).

There are two failing doctests: one only happens on doctesting and needs the associated environment; the other is the "pi in RIF" doctest which presented a philosophical problem to Sage developers (see #17984) and thus cannot be resolved in my lifetime.

Well you can't give a transform of a noninvertible matrix, so I changed the example to one that is always invertible. I can revert to the original doctest but it will lead to problems in a later ticket.

I will be happy to work on it if there is a problem with #19040.

I'm guessing changes of this type:

```
-        sage: x,y = var('x,y')
+        sage: _ = var('x,y')
```
are because you're thinking towards #17958. However I don't think that takes away from the problem, but instead just makes the behavior harder to do find/replace for and makes it harder for the reader to understand what is going on in the doctest. Could you provide some other justification for these changes?

> are because you're thinking towards #17958. However I don't think that takes away from the problem, but instead just makes the behavior harder to do find/replace for and makes it harder for the reader to understand what is going on in the doctest. Could you provide some other justification for these changes?

If you object to that you will have to stem the tide now by posting to sage-devel, because a recursive grep just showed about 30 instances of such usage in Sage (and certainly not all from me). Or open a separate ticket, please. Here they are now reverted.
