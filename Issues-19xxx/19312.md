The next big Pynac update has:

* libgmp `bigint`s and `bigrat`s instead of `Integer` and `Rational` Python objects
* assumptions/domains can influence Pynac computation
* sync elementary assumptions on symbols/functions with Pynac (#19035)
* C++11 results in better code readability
* better decisions through more info flags and logic
* return `not implemented` and `undecidable` for some decisions (for math. logic changes see the #19040 description)
* add inexact flag for possible expansions / FP simplifications
* `abs()` expansion
* `function::info()`
* from GiNaC: Fix `pow(+(...),2).expand()`
* remove some unused files and other cleanup; add missing autoconf macro;
* some older memleaks closed

This works and can be reviewed independently on machines with gcc>=4.6, but please wait with setting positive for the build system changes (i.e., #19298).

There are two failing doctests: one only happens on doctesting and needs the associated environment; the other is the "pi in RIF" doctest which presented a philosophical problem to Sage developers (see #17984) and thus cannot be resolved in my lifetime.

I will be happy to work on it if there is a problem with #19040.

I'm guessing changes of this type:

```
-        sage: x,y = var('x,y')

```
are because you're thinking towards #17958.

There still is

in `functions/log.py`.

Also, for the test in `hyperbolic_isometry.py`, if we add

```
sage: assume(a*d != b*c)
```
then would that avoid issues with #19040?

Other than that, I'm okay with the current state up to Jeroen's comments that haven't been addressed.
