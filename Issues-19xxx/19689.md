We already have (semi-)global minimal models for elliptic curves over number fields in #18662 (but see also #19665), and at that time I implemented reduction via scaling by units over real quadratic fields only.  Here I extend that to arbitrary number fields.  The method is similar to that used in Magma, though only implemented there currently for totally real fields.

The idea is to map (c4,c6) into `R^(r1+r2)` via the vector indexed by infinite places v whose coordinates are `d_v*log(|c4|_v<sup>(1/4)+|c6|_v</sup>(1/6))`, and reduce this vector modulo translation by the lattice which is the image of the unit group.

**Keywords:** reduction scaling Weierstrass model
