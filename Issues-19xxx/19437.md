Can you tell me what's your use case for this branch?

I am a bit worried about
1. the impact on current code, in particular `CallableSymbolicExpressionRing_class`.
2. conflicts in case different parents use variables with the same name, see the global `pynac_symbol_registry`.

Have a look at my extra commit which makes symbol names specific to a parent. I'm not really sure that this is what you want since I don't know your use-case.

Basically, I came long this with #19259, which implements subrings of the symbolic ring. A symbolic subring is inheriting from the symbolic ring class. The `element_constructor` is overridden in the following way: It calls the `element_constructor` of `SR` and then checks if the element's variables are "valid".

I had a short look at your changes and they seem to do what I need, but I'll have a more careful check later (I'm kind of busy right now).

Thanks

Daniel
