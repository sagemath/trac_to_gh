In general `arb` balls can have a precision different from their parent. Though, when converting to a ball parent, the precision should be set to the precision of the parent. Especially when the input is an integer or or a rational.

Because of this, we get strange behavior such as

```
sage: from sage.rings.real_arb import RealBallField
sage: a = RealBallField(20)(1.3)
sage: b = RealBallField(53)(1.3)
sage: a.identical(b)
True
sage: (a+0).identical(b+0)
False
```

This ticket proposes to make it so that when `R(x)` is called the result is a ball with the exact precision of `R`.

IMO saying that “arb balls can have a precision different from their parent” isn't the right way to think about the issue. For example, `RealBallField(100)(1)` and `RealBallField(200)(1)` both have midpoints whose mantissa fits on 1 bit and zero radius: what is their “precision”? The way I view it, they have none by themselves, and having `RealBallField`s of different precisions is just a convenient way of specifying the precision at which the results of operations on balls should be rounded.

I don't find the way things currently work particularly confusing, while I think it can be useful in “advanced” use (to compute the result of a subtraction involving cancellation, say). I should also say that real balls won't really “have the precision of their parent” even after your change: at the very least it will still be possible to create balls whose midpoint's precision is less than the precision of the parent—and that's a good thing, but I'm not sure it is less confusing than the behavior you are trying to change.

So personally I'm certainly not going to give this ticket positive_review. That being said, I have no strong objection either to rounding integers etc. by default when creating new balls. It just makes things a bit less flexible for no good reason.

That's an implementation detail. It doesn't matter from the user's point of view.

Equality of balls is rare, it only holds if either the objects are identical (`is` is a subset of `==`) or if both balls are exact and equal. As `RBF(1.3)` is not exact, it should not be surprising that `a+0 == b+0` returns `True`.

A similar example --- and this is not related to the purpose of the ticket as far as I can understand it --- is

```
sage: a = RBF(1.3)
sage: a == a
True
sage: a + 1 == a + 1
False
```

This ticket isn't really about whether or not a Sage computation maps to a libarb computation. It's more about *how* it maps to a libarb computation.

More precisely, it's about the meaning of precision: currently, `arb` handles precision in a way which is completely different from anything else in Sage (the precision of an element can be different from the precision of the parent). This has consequences such as `a` and `a + 0` not always being the same.

On this ticket, I propose to handle precision in `arb` the same way as for example `RR` or `RIF`. This means that the precision is determined by the parent: an element has the precision of its parent.

The way I understand it, what this ticket really does is not to make “the precision of arb balls” that of their parent, but to round newly created balls to the precision of their parent by default. IMO this is a regression compared to the existing implementation (so I'd be in favor of closing the present ticket as wontfix), but a small one (so I'm not going to further argue against it, I just won't review it).

Incidentally, I don't see how “`arb` handles precision in a way which is completely different from anything else in Sage”. For example, you can have power series truncated at any order in a `PowerSeriesRing` with any `default_prec`.

OK, let me explain: in `arb`, parents have a precision. Also elements have a precision, which can be *different* from the precision of the parent. But, when doing any operation, the result gets rounded to the precision of the parent. There is nothing in Sage which works this way.

This leads to things like

```
sage: from sage.rings.real_arb import RBF
sage: a = RBF(3^100)
sage: a.identical(a+0)
False
```
I don't know any Sage ring element which changes when adding `0`.

The difference with `PowerSeriesRing` is that the parent doesn't have a precision, only a *default* precision. A `PowerSeriesRing` can contain elements of any precision and that precision is taken into account when doing arithmetic:

```
sage: R.<x> = PowerSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: a = x + O(x^30); a
x + O(x^30)
sage: a + 0
x + O(x^30)
sage: a = x + O(x^10); a
x + O(x^10)
sage: a + 0
x + O(x^10)
```

The equivalent of what `arb` currently does would be

```
sage: R.<x> = PowerSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: a = x + O(x^30); a
x + O(x^30)
sage: a + 0
x + O(x^20)
```

A `PowerSeriesRing` can contain elements of any precision and that precision is taken into account when doing arithmetic:\n\nYes, I agree that the analogy is not perfect. But I believe the example of power series rings shows that there is no single way of handling precision that is used uniformly across all sage parents, and that what we do with ball fields is not *completely* different from *anything* else in sage.\n\nThe way I view it, balls (elements) do not need a precision, because their accuracy is determined by their diameter. Only operations between balls have a precision, provided by the parent. It is up to the implementation of each operation to decide how large the mantissa of the center of its result needs to be, and this size may or may not be the precision of the operation (as far as I know, arb doesn't guarantee anything regarding the relation between these two quantities).",

Yes, I agree that the analogy is not perfect. But I believe the example of power series rings shows that there is no single way of handling precision that is used uniformly across all sage parents, and that what we do with ball fields is not *completely* different from *anything* else in sage.

The way I view it, balls (elements) do not need a precision, because their accuracy is determined by their diameter. Only operations between balls have a precision, provided by the parent. It is up to the implementation of each operation to decide how large the mantissa of the center of its result needs to be, and this size may or may not be the precision of the operation (as far as I know, arb doesn't guarantee anything regarding the relation between these two quantities).

Maybe not *completely* different, but certainly *significantly* different.

I have no magic solution, but:
- working with `mpfr` and `arb` are not the the same thing
- in some situation it does make sense to truncate arb balls to fit the parent's precision (like when the input is an integer) but not always (when you are lucky and get more precision, why would you truncate it)

As I already said `RBF(some_large_int)` **should** truncate the entry but currently does not (it uses `arb_set_fmpz`). I am a big +1 for such a change in our arb interface. There are two different questions:

1. the semantic of `RBF(something)`: in this case I would like the truncation to always operate
2. the semantic of `my_ball.some_function()`: where I do not know what is the best solution

> I really don't see why arb balls should be different. And that is really my main concern for this ticket: perhaps the arb semantics make sense in a certain way. But the arb semantics are really surprising because they are different from anything else in Sage.

They are different in the case 2. above. If you compute the logarithm of `my_ball`, you have no idea a priori of the precision of `log(my_ball)`. This is not the case in `mpfr` where the precision is somehow statically encoded in the datastructure. You can always extend/truncate the result but this is rather artificial. The exact reason why I do not like it.

FWIW, after now a few years of regularly working with RBF/CBF, I am more and more convinced that the current implementation is better than truncating every time. In particular, it allows you to compare balls belonging to different parents in a meaningful way, even though they get coerced to the parent with the lower precision.

Aren't you confusing two things here?

When I say "precision" I mean the number of bits stored in the data structure, regardless of how these bits were obtained. This is a priori unrelated to the error margin (the difference between the mathematical result and the output number).

MPFR makes guarantees about both: you know how many bits the output number has and you know that the number is exactly rounded.

With arb, you still know the number of bits which is used to represent the midpoint of the output ball. That is, the `prec` argument of the function which was called. This is clearly documented in http://arblib.org/using.html:

> Given a ball [m±r] with m∈R (not necessarily a floating-point number), we can always round m to a nearby floating-point number that has at most most prec bits in the component u, and add an upper bound for the rounding error to r. In Arb, ball functions that take a prec argument as input (e.g. arb_add()) always round their output to prec bits. Some functions are always exact (e.g. arb_neg()), and thus do not take a prec argument.

So I think that "says arb balls should have the precision of the parent" is equivalent to "RBF(x) should have the precision of RBF" unless I am misunderstanding something.
