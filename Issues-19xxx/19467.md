Since #19370, the build tree is no longer relocatable on OSX due to absolute linker paths.

The plan is to auto-generate an `install.py` file that patches all hard-coded paths using https://github.com/vbraun/binary-pkg

Alternative: forbid relocation #19410

Replying to [vbraun](#comment%3A7):

I believe it also runs the first time that sage is started, before anybody can legitimately move it away. That makes it work then. 

The point is that it also runs whenever somebody installs a new package. But maybe you want to add a sage-post-install hook instead...
