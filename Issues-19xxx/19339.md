**Information from Gregg Musiker**

I recently realized that if one starts with a digraph `D` (with vertices labeled however) and then writes

   `S = ClusterSeed(D)`, then the code will effectively call

   `Q = ClusterQuiver(D)` and then assign `S = ClusterSeed(Q)`.

In the same spirit as the last ticket, I think it makes sense to add other vertex names to `ClusterQuiver` and allow these to be passed on to `ClusterSeed`.  Since we only changed the behavior of `cluster_seed.py` in the last ticket, I believe the behavior of `quiver.py` was unaffected.

In particular, if one writes `ClusterSeed(D)` or `ClusterQuiver(D)`, then I believe Sage should then use the vertices of digraph as labels rather than defaulting to `[0,...,n-1]`.  (Although we will have to think somewhat about backwards compatibility.)

In particular, I'm thinking of two changes.

1) In `ClusterQuiver.__init__()`, if a digraph is the input, then the vertices of `ClusterQuiver` agree with the labels of the vertices of the input digraph.  (Although for internal data, sage would also have a dictionary from `{0,..., n-1}` to these vertex labels so that it understands the "ij-th" entry of the B-matrix for instance.

2) In `ClusterSeed.__init__()`, if a `ClusterQuiver` is the input, then it uses those vertices as labels for the cluster variables as if the user had given `user_labels`.

The only exception would be if the user puts in such a `ClusterQuiver` and also `user_labels` as a separate input, then the new `user_labels` should override the old ones from the `ClusterQuiver`.

I am working on a review patch for this ticket.  This will include:

1) A small bug fix to address the issue where digraph labels get lost if the ClusterSeed is mutated:

```
sage: dg = DiGraph([[5,6]])
sage: S = ClusterSeed(dg); S.quiver().digraph().vertices()
[5, 6]
sage: S.mutate(0)
sage: S.quiver().digraph().vertices()
[0, 1]
```

2) An enhancement allowing users to specify a list of frozen variables.

Hi Ben,
These are my suggestions for now:
* In the doc for `ClusterQuiver` taking digraph as input, could you add another line `sage: for Q.nlist()` so the user will read that `ClusterQuiver` will remember labels from the input digraph.

* The following bug does not exist before this ticket was pulled:

```
sage: Q=ClusterQuiver(DiGraph([[0,5]]))
sage: Q.b_matrix()
[ 0  1]
[-1  0]
sage: Q.mutate(0)
IndexError: index out of range
```

* Also, I think we should either explain the following behavior in the doc, or change the code so that the behavior for `mutation` is more consistent. I think either is fine. The following works well

```
sage: S=ClusterSeed(DiGraph([['a','b']]))
sage: S.mutate('a')
```  
but the following throws an error

```
sage: S=ClusterSeed(DiGraph([[5,'b']]))
sage: S.mutate(5)
ValueError: The quiver can only be mutated at a vertex or at a sequence of vertices
```

* If possible, could you get the recent version of Sage (if not 7.3beta 6, then at least 7.2 master branch), and then add your code on top of this recent Sage? Currently your branch is marked as red because it cannot automatically merge.

Some quick comments:

- I believe you want `user_labels` to be a list, so once we switch to Python3, the current code won't work. So I recommend (and is also faster):
  {{{
user_labels = [ZZ(x) if type(x) == int else x for x in user_labels]
  }}}
- Instead of `elif type(user_labels[i]) in [list,tuple]:`, you should use `elif isinstance(user_labels[i], (list, tuple)):` (unless you want to explicitly forbid any subclasses of `list` or `tuple`).
- Python uses different conventions than, e.g., C++/Java. So variables `isVertices` should be `is_vertices`.
- You have an erroneous character:
  {{{#!diff

Some comments, most of them are minor:

- There is a `warn` function (see, e.g., `sets/disjoint_union_enumerated_sets.py`). I feel like you should use that instead of `print` statements, but I'm not 100% sure.
- The `copy` is redundant here `copy( list(data._nlist) )` because `list` already makes a (shallow) copy.
- The `keys()` is unnecessary in `labelset = set(user_labels.keys())`.
- Do you really only want to test `type(x) == int` in this line:
  {{{#!python
user_labels = [ZZ(x) if type(x) == int else x for x in user_labels]
  }}}
  I feel it would be better to do `if x in ZZ`.
- If `user_labels` does conflict, are you sure you only want a string printed? This feels like it should be an error.
- Change
  {{{#!diff
-type(user_labels[key]) in [list,tuple]
+isinstance(user_labels[key], (list, tuple))
  }}}
- You need a blank line here between text and doctests, e.g., here:
  {{{#!diff
         For a cluster seed from an arbitrarily labelled digraph::
+
             sage: S = ClusterSeed(DiGraph([['a','b'],['b','c']]),frozen=['b'])
             sage: S.cluster_class()
             [[a, c], [a, (b + 1)/c], [(b + 1)/a, c], [(b + 1)/a, (b + 1)/c]]
  }}}
  There is at least one other place where this is needed.
- From the warning message, I don't understand the added check here:
  {{{
            if frozen is not None and type(frozen) in [int,Integer]:
                print('The input data is a matrix, therefore the additional parameter frozen is ignored.  Frozen vertices read off accordingly if the matrix is not square.')
  }}}
- Why is this downgraded to only a warning?
  {{{#!diff
+            warning_given = False

  }}}
- `nlist()` and `mlist()` are not very descriptive method names (however, it is fine for the internal attributes). I think it would be better to call them `free_vertices()` and `frozen_vertices()`.
- Never do `keep_previous_frozen == False`. Simply do `not keep_previous_frozen`. Similar for `keep_previous_frozen == True`.
- You are breaking PEP8 in a lot of places:
  * Arguments should not have spaces around the `=`, e.g., `def foo(x=5)` and not `def foo(x = 5)`.
  * Same holds true for default arguments to functions.
  * Binary operations should have spaces to either side: `strng = strng + "_" + j`. Although IMO you should leave this type alone `user_labels.keys()[n:n+m]` as the `[]` operator takes priority.
  * `dict` input as, e.g., `{x: -x for x in range(5)}`.
  * Commas will always have spaces after them.
- Break long (> 80 characters) docstrings.
- Use `Return` instead of `Returns` in the 1-line doc description (at least do not make things worse in your added functions/methods).
- There are a number of docstring formatting issues, e.g., you should code format things like ```self``` or variable names.
- You have added a lot of unnecessary whitespace to the docstrings. For example:
  {{{#!diff
`@``@` -120,6 +121,14 `@``@` class ClusterSeed(SageObject):
 
         sage: S = ClusterSeed(['A',4]); S.use_fpolys(False); S._use_fpolys
         False
+        
+        sage: S = ClusterSeed(DiGraph([['a','b'],['c','b'],['c','d'],['e','d']]),frozen = ['c']); S
+        A seed for a cluster algebra of rank 4 with 1 frozen variable
+
+        sage: S = ClusterSeed(['D',4],user_labels = [-1,0,1,2]);S
+        A seed for a cluster algebra of rank 4 of type ['D', 4]
+
+
 
     """
     def __init__(self, data, frozen=None, is_principal=False, user_labels=None, user_labels_prefix='x'):
  }}}
  It is good to be consistent with the rest of Sage (at most 1 line after doctests before the `"""`).
- Remove trailing whitespace.

Thanks. I went through and made some additional changes and fixes as well, but there's too much to standardize to do it all on this ticket.

I would say no, but since the rest of the code here does it, it is better to be consistent.

Serious, not really. Yet, it makes the code a little more difficult to parse quickly, and it would help give Sage a more polished feel.

If my changes are good, then positive review.

There seems to be a new error found by the patchbot now:

Failed example:

Expected:

It is not a blankline; the patchbot reports an actual error traceback (although the blankline is annoying to have it in the output, it is not something that is actually is checked). It is a simple fix because of changes I made to the error messages to conform to our (and Python's) convention of error messages being lowercase and without periods.

I have also fixed the docbuilding issues reported by the patchbot.

<a id='comment:70'></a>
Why use `reduce()` here?

```
is_cluster_vars = reduce(lambda x, y: isinstance(y, str), seqq, 1) and seed._use_fpolys
```

This code is equivalent to

```
if len(seqq) == 0 or isinstance(seqq[-1], str):
    is_cluster_vars = seed._use_fpolys
else:
    is_cluster_vars = False
```
but is that what is intented?

Or did you perhaps mean

```
is_cluster_vars = all(isinstance(y, str) for y in seqq) and seed._use_fpolys
```

I ask because we trying to clean this up in #25571.
