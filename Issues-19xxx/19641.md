```
In principle, we just have to compile Sage with

```
LDFLAGS=-Wl,-rpath,$SAGE_LOCAL/lib
```
to use rpath instead of LD_LIBRARY_PATH

Using #19467 this will work with binary distribution

Benefits to Sage:
* Only Sage binaries will see the rpath setting, removing all library conflicts
* Works on OSX 10.11

Minor, but is there a reason not to use

```sh
LDFLAGS="-Wl,-rpath,$SAGE_LOCAL/lib $LDFLAGS"
```
?

(That's the only difference to `-Xlinker` where every argument has to be passed separately.)
