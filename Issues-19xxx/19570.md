The `rstan` R package (a diabolically efficient MCMC sampler) needs Boost>=1.58. For some unfathomable reason Sage's R interpreter finds Sage's Boost library **before** the (partial) Boost library packaged in an R packege on which `rstan` depends. See details in [this thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/stan-users/XygoXG0SoTM) in sage-users.
