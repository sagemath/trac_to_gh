Try github.io.
I just followed the instructions here: https://pages.github.com/
I created an empty repo named dimpase.github.io on my github account (name dimpase) page,
cloned it, added (using git) the tar.gz file, committed, pushed, and checked that this file
can be obtained via `wget http://dimpase.github.io/boost_cropped-1.58.0.tar.bz2`

all works just fine...
