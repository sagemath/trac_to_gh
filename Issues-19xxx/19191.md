"A partially ordered set (poset) is planar if it has a planar Hasse diagram."? Quite short...

How about

"A lattice is planar if it has a planar Hasse diagram --- that is, it can be drawn to a plane without crossing lines and every covering relationg directed upwards."?

And yes, this function could be defined on a general poset. But then it is NP-complete.

> This is about planarity of lattices, not posets in general.

The paper I sent you previously says that a *Poset* is planar if its hasse diagram is planar.

The first paragraph (not the abstract) in the first paper that you mentionned says that the definition is (naturally) the same for posets, i.e. that they are planar whenever their hasse diagram is planar.

What the first paper claims in its title is that you can *chose* to add the `(0,n-1)` edge without changing the property.

What the slideshow says in its 12th page looks contradictory with the two papers above. If you can find the paper it quotes, perhaps that will clarify it.

There seems to be same concept in plain graph theory: *upward planar* DAG. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upward_planar_drawing

The abstract of first paper I mentioned starts with "It is shown that a finite lattice is planar if and only if the (undirected) graph obtained from its (Hasse) diagram by adding an edge between its least and greatest elements is a planar graph." And this makes no sense if planarity of lattices would equal to planarity of graphs.

The question is about meaning of Hasse diagram. Should we say that it is a special type of DAG, or that it is a DAG drawn with a limitation? I think that writers think about latter.

But of course 1) this must be made very clear in the documentation, and 2) it might have interesting question in it own to look properties of posets with planar covering relations graph.

How about

"A lattice is planar if it's Hasse diagram has an upward planar drawing. In other words, planar lattice can be drawn without crossing lines and every covering relation directed upwards."

Jori,

Up to now, in all papers that I have seen, a Poset is defined to be planar when its hasse diagram is planar. Have you even found one paper that defines it differently?

If there is to be a `Lattice.is_planar` or a `Poset.is_planar`, I expect it to be `self._hasse_diagram.is_planar()`, and nothing else. Even the paper that mentions this additional edge between 0 and n-1 uses *this* definition (without the additional edge) and apparently proves that you can add this edge without changing the property.

The least I can say is that I *know* that some people would be entitled to believe that `Lattice.is_planar` does not add any edge, even without reading the documentation (did you ever read the documentation of `is_even` ?). And those must not be mislead.

If you want to implement another definition, it will have to be under another name.

No. Hasse diagram for `BooleanLattice(3)` is planar, but it has no upward planar drawing.

1) Is it technically possible to give positive review to a ticket like this, as this depends on closed ticket not yet at newewst beta? 2) This obviously needs clarification in documentation.

The only thing that we must preserve is Volker's own happiness. It does not matter what you and I have on our hard drive: when a ticket is closed, it means that Volker's latest release contains the ticket. So you can assume that it is already applied.

> 2) This obviously needs clarification in documentation. But `NOTE` or even `WARNING`? It would say that `NOTE` is enought.

I agree. I only have a note in the version I am working on.

> 3) Is there easy way to undo last commit on ticket? 

Yeah yeah. Look at 'git rebase -i', I use this all the time (look for 'squashing'). But don't worry about this, I am working on the branch and will push it shortly.

I still hesitate over this `is_planar` and `is_upward_planar`. If you really think that the first is better then let's do this, but if you believe that anybody who looks for `is_planar` would also think of trying `is_upward_planar` then the second is obviously safer. Tell me how you want it done, and I will update the branch accordingly.

Googling "upward planar lattice" seems to found nothing. I guess it is good reason to have `is_planar()`, as it seems to be only used term.

For whatever it's worth (and it's late in the review process), I am
also hesitant. In papers it is often less of an issue to use short
names as the context helps removing ambiguities. So if someone comes
up with a good explicit `is_xxx_planar` suggestion (I don't have one),
that looks appealing. But that's just my 2cents; please proceed as you
see fit.
