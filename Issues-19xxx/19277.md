I saw this on wikipedia and thought that it would give some company to the single member of hypergraphs.<tab>, but then I noticed that a GQ was probably a design too.

So here it is, a new element for `designs.<tab>`.

One remark, and one worry:

* I had to look at the doc of bipartite_sets, and it is not very clear what is a bipartite set, even if I can guess.

* The utf8 dash symbol in the wikipedia link may prevent the doc to build (did you check ?). It could be replaced by just a minus sign and wikipedia will do the redirection.

Hello,

> * I had to look at the doc of bipartite_sets, and it is not very clear what is a bipartite set, even if I can guess.


Yeah, right. It has been around for a while like that, it must be the first time I use it. If you want to rename it under a more meaningful name, I have no objection at all. If it were only me I'd turn it into `is_bipartite(certificate=True)` or something.

Both html and pdf doc compile, though the link is wrong in the pdf doc. I'll add a commit.
