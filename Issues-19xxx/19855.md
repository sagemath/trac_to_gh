"Möbius" can not be a part of identifier name. Some functions and classes are named as `mobius_*`, others as `moebius_*`. As an example there is `moebius_algebra()` in finite lattices, and `mobius_function()` in finite posets.

This patch unifies them to `moebius`.

<a id='comment:17'></a>OK, now this should be OK. There was an error at `src/sage/algebras/catalog.py`, so I did *not* change class name but corrected a broken link.

I changed every docstring so that right form, "Möbius", is used everywhere except in the code. Also `_repr_` is changed.

Why?

(Maybe the answer should go to sage-devel instead of one ticket.)

Python 2 strings are not unicode by default (which is changed in Python 3), so this can cause output problems (in particular, for those rare terminals that do not support unicode).

?? But in sage-devel there has been discussion about this. I think that it was said that we can assume unicode support.

This is what I get:

```
sage: s = "ü"
sage: s
'\xc3\xbc'
```
Granted, this is fixed by doing `print s`, and we have the same behavior for `s = u"ü"`. Yet most output does not occur with a print statement.
