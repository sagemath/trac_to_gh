"Möbius" can not be a part of identifier name. Some functions and classes are named as `mobius_*`, others as `moebius_*`. As an example there is `moebius_algebra()` in finite lattices, and `mobius_function()` in finite posets.

This patch unifies them to `moebius`.

```
    def __repr__(self):
        """
        Returns a description of this function.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: q = Moebius()

            'The Möbius function'
        """

and it says

```
Expected:
    The Möbius function
Got:
    'The M\xc3\xb6bius function'
```

I can see no difference to other functions. Charcode-line at the beginning of file is same etc. Any ideas?

This is what I get:

```
sage: s = "ü"
sage: s
'\xc3\xbc'
```
Granted, this is fixed by doing `print s`, and we have the same behavior for `s = u"ü"`. Yet most output does not occur with a print statement.
