"Möbius" can not be a part of identifier name. Some functions and classes are named as `mobius_*`, others as `moebius_*`. As an example there is `moebius_algebra()` in finite lattices, and `mobius_function()` in finite posets.

This patch unifies them to `moebius`. 


Depends on #19879

Where did those `conf.py` came?

Otherwise this can be commented. I have not yet run tests, so not in needs_review anyways.

There is `src/sage/rings/arith.py` with

```
    def __repr__(self):
        """
        Returns a description of this function.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: q = Moebius()
            sage: q.__repr__()
            'The Möbius function'

        return "The Möbius function"
```

and it says

```
Expected:
    The Möbius function
Got:
    'The M\xc3\xb6bius function'
```

I can see no difference to other functions. Charcode-line at the beginning of file is same etc. Any ideas?

This is what I get:

```
sage: s = "ü"
sage: s
