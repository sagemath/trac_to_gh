<a id='comment:4'></a>I confirm this branch makes things faster:

BEFORE:

```
sage: from sage.games.quantumino import QuantuminoSolver 
sage: q = QuantuminoSolver(0)                            
sage: %timeit L = q.tiling_solver().rows() 
1 loop, best of 3: 7.26 s per loop                                      
```

AFTER:

```
sage: from sage.games.quantumino import QuantuminoSolver
sage: q = QuantuminoSolver(0)                                                 
sage: %timeit L = q.tiling_solver().rows()
1 loop, best of 3: 1.78 s per loop     
```                  

I fixed the long time doctests errors. To me this is a positive review. I let Vincent change the status to positive review if he agrees with my commit.

Note: I rebased the branch of Vincent on top of most recent development version.
