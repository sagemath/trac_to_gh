Jupyter assumes that it is running a single process, otherwise interrupts get sent to the wrong process. With Sage, this assumption is currently not true due to the "front-end" `$SAGE_ROOT/sage` script. If we instead use `exec` there and apply #19135, this is no longer a problem and Sage Jupyter notebooks can be interrupted properly.
