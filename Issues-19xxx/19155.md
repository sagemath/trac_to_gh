The purpose of this patch is to improve the complexity of is_symmetric function for words from quadratic to linear. To do this, we modify the lps (longest palindrome suffix) function to make it linear (using the last value of lps_lengths), and use a property of the longest palindrome suffix of a square.

Apart of the interest for the function in itself, the goal is to make an is_christoffel function that computes the answer in linear time (see ticket #19159).
