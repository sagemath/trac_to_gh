Computing heights of points over number fields (this does not effect things over Q):  in the expression (from Silverman's paper) for the number of terms needed for the requested precision for local height at an archimedean place v, there is log(max(1,1/|D|_v)) where D is the discriminant and v the valuation.  Over Q D is integral so this term is always 0.  Over number fields, |D|_v can be extremely small for some v, indistinguishable from 0 to moderate precision.

Example (from an LMFDB curve):

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2-x-104)
sage: E = EllipticCurve([1, a - 1, 1, -816765673272*a - 7931030674178, 1478955604013312315*a + 14361086227143654561])
sage: P = E(5393511/49*a + 52372721/49 , -33896210324/343*a - 329141996591/343 )
sage: P.height()
```

This raises an error before the fix in this branch; after, it works fine.

I think that the problem you're trying to solve (massive cancellation in real embeddings) is general enough that it should have a general solution. In other words, I think the "right" solution to this ticket does not involve any changes to the elliptic curve code, but to the number field code.

What do you think?

I think that I need to compute heights now!  So I am going to use this code as it is anyway.

Besides that, Marco Caselli and I are implementing a vastly better way to compute local archimedean heights using AGM (which is non-trivial for complex embeddings).

But your general point certainly stands.

Let's make it a separate ticket; I don't have time to implement it right now, and on a separate ticket it will be easier to concentrate on testing and finding other places where we can use the new function.

Instead of embedding into `RR`, embedding in `AA` and then coercing to `RR` just works:

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2-x-104)
sage: E = EllipticCurve([1, a - 1, 1, -816765673272*a - 7931030674178, 1478955604013312315*a + 14361086227143654561])
sage: D = E.discriminant()
sage: phi = K.embeddings(AA)[0]
sage: RR(phi(D))
-4.32015718504111e-35
```

Using this looks like the right fix to me.
