In #19321 a stopgap is implemented in Element that would end up with a lot of annoying messages. We propose another solution (actually we follow the initial proposition from #19016): return 0 as a default hash.

This ticket is just an alternative to #19321.

Changing the runtime cost of data structures from what it should be should not be taken lightly. I don't think this change leads to acceptable behaviour (and it will be harder to find what's wrong: a hashing error is easier to debug)

```
class A(object):
  def __init__(self,N):
    self.N=N
  def __hash__(self):
    return 0
  def __eq__(self,other):
    return isinstance(other,A) and self.N==other.N
  def __call__(self):
    return self.N

class B(object):
  def __init__(self,N):
    self.N=N
  def __hash__(self):
    return hash(self.N)
  def __eq__(self,other):
    return isinstance(other,B) and self.N==other.N
  def __call__(self):
    return self.N

@cached_function
def T(a):
  return a()
```

```
sage: %timeit( [T(B(n)) for n in range(10000)])
100 loops, best of 3: 14.3 ms per loop
sage: %timeit( [T(A(n)) for n in range(10000)])
1 loops, best of 3: 25.8 s per loop
```

Or, with a smaller cache it's still bad (I've cleaned the cache):

```
sage: %timeit( [T(A(n)) for n in range(100)])
100 loops, best of 3: 2.22 ms per loop
sage: %timeit( [T(B(n)) for n in range(100)])
10000 loops, best of 3: 181 µs per loop
```

Even for a dictionary of size 10, the trivial hash still causes a 4x slowdown.

A change like this can push code that runs correctly in sage at present to a point where running it is not practical. I seriously think there may be a user out there that has an application that depends on this code. This change would break sage for him in that respect. I am strongly -1 to introducing something like that in a release candidate, just before release, because we wouldn't catch it.
