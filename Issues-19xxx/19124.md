This ticket implements differentiable curves in real differentiable manifolds. This is a follow-up of #19092 within the [SageManifolds project](http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/) (see the metaticket #18528 for an overview). 

This ticket implements the following Python classes:
- the parent class `OpenInterval` for open intervals of **R** as 1-dimensional diff. manifolds
  with a canonical chart, 
  - the subclass `RealLine` for **R** as a 1-dimensional diff. manifold
- the parent class `DifferentiableCurveSet` for homsets Hom(I,M), i.e. sets of differentiable maps
  I --> M, where I is an open interval of **R** and M a differentiable manifold over **R**
- the element class `DifferentiableCurve` for curves, i.e. differentiable maps I --> M

**Documentation**:
The reference manual is produced by
`sage -docbuild reference/manifolds html`
It can also be accessed online at http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/doc/19124/reference/manifolds/
More documentation (e.g. example worksheets) can be found [here](http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/documentation.html).

Thank you very much again for this review and the changes!

In the last commits, I've updated to the latest version of #19092 and have added the display of a 3D example in the documentation of `DifferentiableCurve.plot`. I am also changing the dependency to #20771, which itself depends on #19092.
