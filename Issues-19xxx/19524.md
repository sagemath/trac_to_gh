However, is there reason to use formal trac reference in comments? See for example `modular/dims.py`. You have also removed some dot - intentionally? "See trac 1234" or "See trac 1234." - I don't know which one it should be.

I built html docs. And to be sure, I am now (again) running short doctests just to be sure.
