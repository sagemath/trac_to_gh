This is a follow-up to #18685, #18732.

It adds get_row_prim, set_row_stat, set_col_stat, warm_up.

These are the remaining functions necessary to implement #18804.

Is it possible to add a short explanation of (and a reference)  what "warming up the basis" means?

And another question - will there be any frontend functions available to take advantage of this stuff, or it's got to be backend-specific?

Replying to [dimpase](#comment%3A5):
> Is it possible to add a short explanation of (and a reference)  what "warming up the basis" means?


The GLPK manual offers this explanation: "This operation includes computing factorization of the basis matrix (if it does not exist), com- puting primal and dual components of basic solution, and determining the solution status." 
I'm not sure if it's worth adding it.

> And another question - will there be any frontend functions available to take advantage of this stuff, or it's got to be backend-specific?


Our current plan is to expose these functions only through a simplified interface that we call "LPBackendDictionary" (#18804), which offers a naive "textbook-style" view on the simplex solvers.

A full-featured frontend interface would be rather tricky. OSI tried that and I'm not sure it really succeeded.
