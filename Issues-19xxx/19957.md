With the Sympy-1.0 upgrade (#20185)

```
sage: import sympy
sage: u = sympy.Function('u'); n = sympy.Symbol('n', integer=True)
sage: sympy.sympify(3*u(n), evaluate=False)
/home/ralf/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sympy-1.0-py2.7.egg/sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.pyc in flatten(self, args, func)
    922         result = []
    923         for arg in args:
--> 924             if isinstance(arg, ast.Call) and arg.func.id == func:
    925                 result.extend(self.flatten(arg.args, func))
    926             else:

AttributeError: 'Call' object has no attribute 'id'
```
which disappears when `3*u(n)` is changed to `u(n)*3` or `u(n)`
