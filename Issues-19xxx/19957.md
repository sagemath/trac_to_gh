what would `scaled=True` and `scaled=False` do?

if there is no error term, then there is no need to rescale nor plot,
`all( ... for ...)` should do the trick in that case.

Within a finite amount of time, I could not get it to work. In any case, this is distinct from doctesting; thus one would have to repeat all commands to generate the plot. Sage preparsing apparently does not work here. Then I got a strange error message.

For doctests, I rather think that we might want to output the list itself instead of the list plot, perhaps already piped through `RIF` or something like that. That would make useful doctests (and could be used throughout the modules during review phases). Thus there could be a flag `return_list=True` or something like that (or a separate method computing the list which could be used in this method here ...).

Plot the relative and the absolute error, respectively. Sometimes I like to look at both.

I couldn't get it to work either: some strange error regarding coercion of a function to `SR` occurrs...

> For doctests, I rather think that we might want to output the list itself instead of the list plot, perhaps already piped through `RIF` or something like that. That would make useful doctests (and could be used throughout the modules during review phases). Thus there could be a flag `return_list=True` or something like that (or a separate method computing the list which could be used in this method here ...).


I've implemented parts of this: there are now two methods; one for computing the list of differences and one for actually plotting. Also, for the sake of convenience, I've added the option to input a symbolic expression containing at most one variable.

Regarding the output: while I'd really like to have RIFs in the output of the difference method, unfortunately this causes problems for `list_plot`, e.g. try

```
sage: list_plot([(k, RIF(sqrt(k))) for k in srange(10)])
```
If the difference should lie in a RIF, the list would have to be processed again before plotting.

Opinions?

> 1. `compare_with_value` should have a parameter `ring=RIF` and results should be converted into ring


Done.

> 2. Examples section should still contain an example with a function


Done.

> 3. `see also` block from `compare_with_value` to `plot_comparison`


Done.

> 4. why `*kwargs` in the call of `list_plot` instead of `**kwargs`?


Typo. Fixed.

> 5. Example with non-trivial arguments, i.e. setting a color.


I've added a more sophisticated doctest.

> 6. `plot_comparison` will then need conversion from RIF to RR; this could also check whether there is still precision left (relative error of 1% seems to be tolerable for a plot) and raise an error otherwise.


Done. The check currently is for a relative diameter of less than `0.025`, which seems like a somewhat practical choice (the example with the harmonic numbers then works up to `n \approx 500`).

> 7. `plot_comparison` should also accept a `ring`; it should be documented and treated to be a `RealIntervalField`.


Done.

Back to `needs_review`.

<a id='comment:14'></a>I've added a couple of small commits during review. Please check.

Two comments:

- I find the naming of a variable `e` confusing...maybe using `expansion` would be better?

- In the plot the hard-coded `0.025` should be adjustable by a parameter.
