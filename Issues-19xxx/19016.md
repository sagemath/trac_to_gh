As reported on sage-devel [1], `Element` implements its hash based on its string representation. This causes a lot of troubles

- it breaks the `equality => same hash` assumption for finitely presented groups

```
    sage: G = groups.presentation.Cyclic(4)
    sage: G.cayley_graph().vertices()
    [1, a, a^2, a^-2, a^3, a^-1]
```
  and symbolic expressions

```
sage: f=sin(x)^2
sage: g=1-cos(x)^2
sage: bool(f == g)
True
sage: hash(f) == hash(g)
False
```
   and possibly many others

- it is highly incompatible with the `rename` feature (see also #8119)

```
sage: from sage.structure.element import Element
sage: class E(Element):
....:     def __init__(self):
....:         Element.__init__(self, Parent())
sage: e = E()
sage: hash(e)
-4965357552728411610
sage: e.rename('hey')
sage: hash(e)
-6429308858210906323
```
  and similarly, hashing should not be available on any mutable object.

- it might be very bad for performance: see #18215 and #18239 for examples

There are several possibilities that are currently being discussed:
- make it return `0` by default (original proposition of the ticket)
- make it raise a `TypeError` by default (as it the case for `SageObject`, see #18246)
- let it as it is but raise a Warning

Hi Nathann,

What about #18246? Just returning `0` will create many collisions that will be hard to track. I think that raising an error is more appropriate because you know what is to be fixed.

If you see a way to turn #18246 into a `needs_review` ticket soon, then I do not mind. But I don't want to fight against 800 screaming guys again, and I want this to be solved.

What about a middle ground: raise a warning, which would appear only once, whenever this 0 hash function is used?

This is a very bad bug and it needs to be fixed. Creating tickets that we forget is nto much more responsible than doing nothing.

By the way, it is not even the same hash function. Here it is `Element.__hash__` and it is `SageObject.__hash__` in #18246. Both need to be solved of course.

Putting in `needs_review` just need some efforts. I can dig into it if you are up for a review.

It is already a bit better.

It is.

I did not forget as you see ;-)

With your implementation, I am pretty sure that the running time of the tests will be much slower. Sage very often put elements in dictionaries or sets. Your solution does not help users to see that `__hash__` is important, because you will not run into bugs, just into very slow code. I agree that you fix the error but you open a much more annoying feature.

Remember that #18246 is not even about the hash function that I change here.

If you think that we can fix the bug *quickly* by removing the `__hash__` function from Element, then let us do that. If the result is that my ticket will be put "on hold" waiting for something that never happens (like it happened 4 months ago on #18246), then this ticket is better than an imaginary one.

+1 to removing silly default hashes. Hashing is simply not something that can be done on a very general level.

For your example, unless you come up with a canonical form for group elements that you can take the hash of, you really shouldn't have a hash function, by the way. These elements should be unhashable, not hashable with a constant hash value.

What is your position for "constant hash" Vs "we change nothing and the bug stays"? How many classes do you think would be broken (and would have to be fixed) if this hash is removed? Are you willing to help?

"Change nothing". I think it's unfortunate that hashing by repr will usually work quite well in cases where a hash is possible: a hash usually requires a canonical form to compute the hash from and that canonical form will usually be used for printing, because that's nice. So in practice, the default hash (although much too slow to be a reasonable hash) will probably work when it should.

In cases where the current default hash *doesn't* work, I think that having it as it is now will lead to better detection than when we change it to a default hash of 0. When people find this in particular cases, the solution is clear: actively disable the hash.

Having to *disable* something is of course the wrong way around: the default hash shouldn't be there in the first place. But putting a constant 0 hash there instead doesn't make transitioning to the desired situation any easier.

I love those guys. "You fix a bug, but because it is not done the way I like I will block your tickets, and the bug will stay unsolved. And no, I will not help do it the way I want to see it done. You have to do it by yourself, while I watch you sweat".

Free software.

See, I wouldn't feel well with myself if after something like that I got to work and started implementing what you ask me to. So the bug will stay, thanks to you. Today, you contributed to the common effort for a better mathematical software.

A little digging in Gap's FP compare functions [source](https://github.com/gap-system/gap/blob/master/lib/grpfp.gi#L236) shows that for finite finitely presented groups, our hash, given these definitions:

```
FamilyObj=libgap.function_factory("FamilyObj")
ElementsFamily=libgap.function_factory("ElementsFamily")
FPFaithHom=libgap.function_factory("FPFaithHom")
Image=libgap.function_factory("Image")
```
should probably look something like this:

```
sage: G=groups.presentation.Cyclic(4)
sage: f=FPFaithHom(ElementsFamily(FamilyObj(G.gap())))
sage: newhash=lambda a: hash(Image(f,a.gap()))
```
A little test:

```
sage: import collections
sage: L=[G.0^i for i in [-5..5]]
sage: collections.Counter(hash(a) == hash(b) for a in L for b in L if a==b)
Counter({False: 20, True: 11})
sage: collections.Counter(newhash(a) == newhash(b) for a in L for b in L if a==b)
Counter({True: 31})
sage: collections.Counter(newhash(a) == newhash(b) for a in L for b in L if a!=b)
Counter({False: 90})

Just a small paranthesis: there are two very different things

1. Changing the **default** behavior of the hash function

2. Having a better hash for FP group elements

These deserve two tickets, don't you think? The initial purpose of the ticket was 1 and now you are mainly discussing 2. Could you open a ticket "better hash for FP Group element"?

I agree that they are related. But `__hash__` is problematic in other situations and two of them are mentioned in #18246. Solving the FP group problem will not solve everything as far as I understand it.

Indeed, absolutely. And #18246 is now marked fixed. Another example is (of course) SR -- another ring where equality and normal form are impossible to resolve in general

```
sage: f=sin(x)^2
sage: g=1-cos(x)^2
sage: bool(f == g)
True
sage: hash(f) == hash(g)
False
```
so, hopefully, with #18246 , the last command will lead to an error?

Sadly not

```
sage: f=sin(x)^2
sage: isinstance(f, sage.structure.element.Element)
True
```
`Element` does implement the `return hash(str(self))` behavior. So this will incidentally be fixed with this ticket...

Aw, that's unfortunate. Also, I'm pretty sure removing default hashes on elements is going to be a much more involved problem. This ticket should probably keep its general function and be retitled to: remove default hash on Element.

Arghhh... there are two category tests which ask explicitely for `parent.one()` and `parent.zero()` to return hashable elements! These are
- `Magmas.Unital.ParentMethods._test_one`
- `AdditiveMagmas.AdditiveUnital.ParentMethods._test_zero`
(I do think that those tests are good because most of the time the result is cached)

In other words, any (additive or multiplicative) magma element should be immutable or adopt an mutable/immutable framework... might be a lot of work to fix!

Concerning `Parent` and `CategoryObject` from which it inherits I do not think it is a good idea to touch it for now. Most of the time we expect a `Parent` to be immutable.

which makes for horrible code! Are you referring to these lines?

```
                # Check that zero is immutable by asking its hash:
                tester.assertEqual(type(zero.__hash__()), int)
                tester.assertEqual(zero.__hash__(), zero.__hash__())
```
It's better to implement this by asking `hash(zero)`. The first test is then not even necessary, because the type will be confirmed in the protocol. Anyway, I think the check is wrong: objects can be immutable without being hashable. 

I don't think python has a universal way of testing immutability, but I do think that our element types that can be mutable/immutable have a testing function for that. So we can check it if available:

```
if hasattr(zero,"is_immutable"):
    tester.assertEqual(zero.is_immutable(),True)
if hasattr(zero,"is_mutable"):
    tester.assertEqual(zero.is_mutable(),False)
```

These are prime ideals of number fields I presume? The HNF of a Z-basis of the ideal wrt. the chosen integral basis would do the trick, if all those things are available ...

I guess we've painted ourselves in a corner here by requiring unique parents, and hence if an ideal is part of the construction parameters we have to hash with it? Luckily Julian Reuth has been putting a door in that corner:

Perhaps ideals that cannot properly be hashed should have a `_cache_key` method instead (see [http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/misc/sage/misc/cachefunc.html](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/misc/sage/misc/cachefunc.html)). It's not the end of the world if `residue_field(P1)` and `residue_field(P2)` give non-identical parents for ideals `P1` and `P2` that are equal, but not obviously so. So the `_cache_key` can be a much sloppier hash-like function. Of course `__hash__` must be equal for equal ideals.

Perhaps a reasonable measure is to define on `Element` etc.:

```
def _cache_key(self):
    return (self.parent(),str(self))
```
and delete the `__hash__` (as is the purpose of this ticket). That should allow most internal usage of elements (in caches), and would free up hash for more properly defined concepts. Note that `_cache_key` is only a failover, so one still can get better performance once one defines a`__hash__`.

The branch must be based over #18246 (which is not yet merged). Otherwise it makes no sense!

I also did implement several hashes that I will add to the branch.

While going through the code I found

```
sage: M = MatrixSpace(GF(3),2,2).list()
sage: for m in M: m.set_immutable()
sage: len(M)
81
sage: len(set(map(hash,M)))
8
```
I opened #19050.

I don't think we have another option:
- testing if something is hashable doesn't test if something is mutable
- something that is immutable can be unhashable. Elements in monoids with an unsolved wordproblem are/should be examples of that
- python guidelines *say* that mutable elements should not be hashable, but this is not enforced.
- python simply doesn't provide a sure-fire way of testing if something is mutable.
- Note that even for properly hashable elements the internal data structure can still change (attributes, internal representation), as long as equality holds. But for reuse of elements those other attributes can still be important! So even hashability does not imply an element is safe for caching/reuse.
Feel free to extend the tests I've proposed. However, assuming 0 and 1 are hashable is not a good test for the stated goal.

The work Vincent has done here is really amazing (because it's such a deep change, and a lot of the changes are really boring!). It'll be a difficult ticket to keep up to date and I think we're close to getting it into shippable form. Also, in the long run the change here is really beneficial. So, I'd hope we can treat it as a blocker so that we can get this in. Technically I don't think this *has* to be a blocker.

<a id='comment:70'></a>
The failing doctest in `parent.pyx` is very weird! The doctest expected a coercion

```
(matrix space over QQ, number field K) -> (matrix space over QQ)
```
but now it is

```
(matrix space over QQ, number field K) -> (matrix space over K)
```

The reason is that before we had (keeping the notation from the failing doctest)

```
sage: ma = a.matrix()
sage: cm = get_coercion_model()
sage: cm.get_action(ma.parent(), b.parent(), operator.mul, ma, b) is None
True
```
but with the patch applied

```
sage: cm.get_action(ma.parent(), b.parent(), operator.mul)
Right scalar multiplication by Number Field in b241562 with
  defining polynomial x^2 + 272118 on Full MatrixSpace of
  2 by 2 dense matrices over Rational Field
```

I don't mind seing the status of this ticket change if we add a stopgap in the next release. That will not change the behaviour or anything, nor the doctests.

I'd be OK with that. When one ends up in  sage.structure.element.Element.__hash__ , performance will be down the drain anyway, and the warning only prints once.

Incidentally, the hash of symbolic expressions is *not* this one.

Replying to [vdelecroix](#comment%3A70):
> The failing doctest in `parent.pyx` is very weird!

I agree. In fact, I believe the doctest is exposing current buggy behaviour and the changed behaviour on this ticket is resolving this behaviour.

Currently (on unpatched sage) we have

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2 + 2*3*7*11)
sage: M = parent(a.matrix())
sage: K_into_MS = K.hom([a.matrix()])
sage: K._unset_coercions_used()
sage: M.get_action(K)
Right scalar multiplication by Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^2 + 462 on Full MatrixSpace of 2 by 2 dense matrices over Rational Field
```
and

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2 + 2*3*7*11)
sage: M = parent(a.matrix())
sage: K_into_MS = K.hom([a.matrix()])
sage: K._unset_coercions_used()
sage: K.register_embedding(K_into_MS)
sage: M.get_action(K) is None
True
```
so adding an embedding (which adds edges to the coercion graph) prevents a discovery of an action! I don't think that can ever be OK. 

Also note that anything that requires `_unset_coercions_used` to be called is a hack (basically by definition).

So, I'm not so sure we should be trying to preserve this behaviour.

Found it: the doctest is indeed broken.

The appropriate way to construct the field would be via

```
sage: Ktemp.<atemp> = NumberField(x^2 + 2*3*7*11)
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(atemp.minpoly(),embedding=atemp.matrix())
TypeError: <type 'sage.matrix.matrix_rational_dense.Matrix_rational_dense'> is not hashable and does not implement _cache_key()
```
which shows the real source of the change in behaviour: previously, the matrix used to define the embedding couldn't be used as a key in the `UniqueFactory` cache. On our very first commit, I introduce a `_cache_key` to compensate for the missing hash. So unhashable matrices can now be used as cache keys (but of course they shouldn't).

**Certificate:** You can toggle the behaviour by activating/deactivating the definition of _cache_key on Element.

So the doctest used to create a field that couldn't be directly constructed. With the introduced _cache_key, the field can be constructed.

During action discovery, the field does get reconstructed. This failed in an unexpected way before, which led to abandoning action discovery and then to using the specified embedding.

In our new setup, registering the embedding after the fact does not lead to breaking action discovery anymore, and hence we never get to using the embedding.

It is documented in `get_coercion_model().bin_op` that it first tries to find an action and then tries to find a coercion. So this doctest is relying on erroneous behaviour: There is an action between M and K, so the meaning of M.0 * K.0 is: let K.0 act on M.0, not "try to coerce K.0 into M and then multiply M.0 with the result".

**MAIN ACTION POINT:**: kill offending doctest.

Followup work to be done:
- do we want `_cache_key` on elements? For matrices, the implementation proposed here is robust (i.e., the key is basically what one could get from making an immutable copy of the thing).
- should embeddings take precedence over actions? I think that this would mean a horrible overhaul of the coercion framework, so I think the answer needs to be "no". People need to get used to the fact that implicit coercion can't do everything for you. Most of the time you're better of applying maps explicitly.

That's just because the matrix that is passed to "embedding" for the field that is reconstructed during action discovery is apparently newly constructed (probably it's `embedding_morphism(K.0)`) and hence mutable again (you can verify by adding `print self.is_mutable()` to `_cache_key`). So while you can make the field properly by passing an immutable (and hence hashable) matrix, stock sage still gives buggy behaviour, because subsequent coercion discovery tries to construct the field in an invalid way (and then eats the exception and abandons action discovery).

This is an argument to make _cache_key more generally available: apparently it's difficult to ensure that reconstructed construction parameters are hashable. Of course, to get reliable behaviour we'd need to make sure that `m._cache_key() == copy(m,is_immutable=True)`, which is not true presently. (otherwise one can get lots of equal-but-not-identical fields. But "embedding" is rather prone to that anyway)

> 1. In `src/sage/rings/polynomial/laurent_polynomial.pyx`, the function `__hash__` is defined twice in the same class.


Can you give line numbers? I count only two definitions of `__hash__` in 
`src/sage/rings/polynomial/laurent_polynomial.pyx`, and they are on distinct classes:

```
sage.rings.polynomial.laurent_polynomial.LaurentPolynomial_mpair.__hash__
sage.rings.polynomial.laurent_polynomial.LaurentPolynomial_univariate.__hash__
```
respectively.

Thanks; should be fixed.

Yes, I wonder too. Not including those would save us adding a whole bunch of silly doctests too.

If `self.m` should be an `Integer` this is a good way of enforcing it. I don't think we did this before? perhaps this is covered in `element_class` already. I'm not familiar with this code (and didn't add that patch)

I think it's better in the long run for sage if we don't. Having a 0 hash is really bad, but not so easy to diagnose quickly. If it really is too difficult to normalize ideal generators in such a way that one can derive a reliable hash, it's probably better if those ideals are not hashable and hence are not used as dict keys.

[duplicated `__hash__` function](http://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/diff/src/sage/rings/polynomial/laurent_polynomial.pyx?id=0a2e3c93c5f5c2751aaf051c40ae6d8a199c3b3b&ss=1&context=20). I think the problem is that this `__hash__` is already included in Sage 6.10.beta0.

I suggest to merge the latest beta in this branch, that will hopefully fix this.

This seems like an argument for *not* adding the 0 hash to `Ideal_generic` then.

By the way, a small improvement might be to take the hash of the parent instead of a constant zero.

Given that the only possibly legitimate use would be to put ideals from the same ring together, I don't think that would be an actual improvement. I'd say that 0 would reflect more properly that the hash is worthless. I also think we should back up each 0 hash with a ticket to either devise a proper hash function or make these unhashable.

If it works without hash, let us go without of course!

The only reason was some failing doctests. It appeared that most comparisons were not properly implemented in crystals. I do not care, but I did not find any simpler way to fix the doctests.

The best would be to implement an `ElementWrapper_with_cmp`.

I really don't remember why I did this. The crystal code is weirdly written, and most of my commits were obtained by try and errors.

As Jeroen points out, this ticket needs another merge/rebase. I know I would screw that up. Would you be able to do it? I'd be fully in favour if you'd also implement some of the suggested changes here in the process.

I don't think you did. The `hash(self.parent())` is on `AbstractSingleCrystalElement` which has it `eq` defined as `self.parent() is other.parent()`, so making the hash equal to that of the parent is entirely justified there.

I think the `self.element_class(self, ZZ(m))` looks justifiable, so I'd be OK with leaving that in.

Hi Volker,

Thanks for having a look. On which Sage version are you testing!? If this is not merged early in a beta we have few chances to let it pass! The doctest you mentioned are introduced by a ticket on asymptotic expansions not previously merged in sage.6.10.beta1. I am willing to merge the associated branch in this ticket but you must ensure me that I will not have to do it thousands time.
