As reported on sage-devel [1], `Element` implements its hash based on its string representation. This causes a lot of troubles

- it breaks the `equality => same hash` assumption for finitely presented groups

```
    sage: G = groups.presentation.Cyclic(4)
    sage: G.cayley_graph().vertices()
    [1, a, a^2, a^-2, a^3, a^-1]
```
  and symbolic expressions

```
sage: f=sin(x)^2
sage: g=1-cos(x)^2
sage: bool(f == g)
True
sage: hash(f) == hash(g)
False
```
   and possibly many others

- it is highly incompatible with the `rename` feature (see also #8119)

```
sage: from sage.structure.element import Element
sage: class E(Element):
....:     def __init__(self):
....:         Element.__init__(self, Parent())
sage: e = E()
sage: hash(e)
-4965357552728411610
sage: e.rename('hey')
sage: hash(e)
-6429308858210906323
```
  and similarly, hashing should not be available on any mutable object.

- it might be very bad for performance: see #18215 and #18239 for examples

There are several possibilities that are currently being discussed:
- make it return `0` by default (original proposition of the ticket)
- make it raise a `TypeError` by default (as it the case for `SageObject`, see #18246)
- let it as it is but raise a Warning

This is a very bad bug and it needs to be fixed. Creating tickets that we forget is nto much more responsible than doing nothing.

Putting in `needs_review` just need some efforts. I can dig into it if you are up for a review.

It is already a bit better.

It is.

I did not forget as you see ;-)

With your implementation, I am pretty sure that the running time of the tests will be much slower. Sage very often put elements in dictionaries or sets. Your solution does not help users to see that `__hash__` is important, because you will not run into bugs, just into very slow code. I agree that you fix the error but you open a much more annoying feature.

If you think that we can fix the bug *quickly* by removing the `__hash__` function from Element, then let us do that. If the result is that my ticket will be put "on hold" waiting for something that never happens (like it happened 4 months ago on #18246), then this ticket is better than an imaginary one.

Concerns about efficiency do not weight much compares to wrong results.

"Change nothing".

I love those guys. "You fix a bug, but because it is not done the way I like I will block your tickets, and the bug will stay unsolved. And no, I will not help do it the way I want to see it done. You have to do it by yourself, while I watch you sweat".

<a id='comment:13'></a>As I said in [comment:9] I did remove the stupid `__hash__` from `SageObject` (this is #18246). Not setting it to `0` but making it raise a `TypeError`. It was not a tremendous effort even if I had to dig in things that I do not understand.

I guess that the same strategy would also be good for `Element` and I agree with Nils on this. The warning option proposed in [comment:4] by Nathann looks also good to me because each time you program something you will notice that you are doing something wrong. Could we try to found a solution? This is annoying and I am willing to help to fix it.

Indeed, absolutely. And #18246 is now marked fixed. Another example is (of course) SR -- another ring where equality and normal form are impossible to resolve in general

```
sage: f=sin(x)^2
sage: g=1-cos(x)^2
sage: bool(f == g)
True
sage: hash(f) == hash(g)
False
```
so, hopefully, with #18246 , the last command will lead to an error?

Sadly not

```
sage: f=sin(x)^2
sage: isinstance(f, sage.structure.element.Element)
True
```
`Element` does implement the `return hash(str(self))` behavior. So this will incidentally be fixed with this ticket...

Aw, that's unfortunate. Also, I'm pretty sure removing default hashes on elements is going to be a much more involved problem. This ticket should probably keep its general function and be retitled to: remove default hash on Element.

I have made #19038 for the FPGroup issue (where we're in much better shape in many individual cases)

In other words, any (additive or multiplicative) magma element should be immutable or adopt an mutable/immutable framework... might be a lot of work to fix!

Concerning `Parent` and `CategoryObject` from which it inherits I do not think it is a good idea to touch it for now. Most of the time we expect a `Parent` to be immutable.

Nope. To fix just these `test_zero` and `test_one` one way is to allow to hash the unit but no other elements... does it look reasonable from the point of view of this ticket? Whether we want to do better looks for me as a part #19038.


New bad news: hashing of ideals. The `ResidueField` factory in `sage.rings.finite_rings.residue_field` uses as keys ideals that do not implement hashing. And I guess in most non trivial case having a hash value would be hard. For principal ideal, it is easy to test equality but much harder to implement a hash.

which makes for horrible code! Are you referring to these lines?

```
                # Check that zero is immutable by asking its hash:
                tester.assertEqual(type(zero.__hash__()), int)
                tester.assertEqual(zero.__hash__(), zero.__hash__())
```
It's better to implement this by asking `hash(zero)`. The first test is then not even necessary, because the type will be confirmed in the protocol. Anyway, I think the check is wrong: objects can be immutable without being hashable. 

I don't think python has a universal way of testing immutability, but I do think that our element types that can be mutable/immutable have a testing function for that. So we can check it if available:

```
if hasattr(zero,"is_immutable"):
    tester.assertEqual(zero.is_immutable(),True)
if hasattr(zero,"is_mutable"):
    tester.assertEqual(zero.is_mutable(),False)
```

These are prime ideals of number fields I presume? The HNF of a Z-basis of the ideal wrt. the chosen integral basis would do the trick, if all those things are available ...

I guess we've painted ourselves in a corner here by requiring unique parents, and hence if an ideal is part of the construction parameters we have to hash with it? Luckily Julian Reuth has been putting a door in that corner:

Perhaps ideals that cannot properly be hashed should have a `_cache_key` method instead (see [http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/misc/sage/misc/cachefunc.html](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/misc/sage/misc/cachefunc.html)). It's not the end of the world if `residue_field(P1)` and `residue_field(P2)` give non-identical parents for ideals `P1` and `P2` that are equal, but not obviously so. So the `_cache_key` can be a much sloppier hash-like function. Of course `__hash__` must be equal for equal ideals.

Perhaps a reasonable measure is to define on `Element` etc.:

```
def _cache_key(self):
    return (self.parent(),str(self))
```
and delete the `__hash__` (as is the purpose of this ticket). That should allow most internal usage of elements (in caches), and would free up hash for more properly defined concepts. Note that `_cache_key` is only a failover, so one still can get better performance once one defines a`__hash__`.

I also did implement several hashes that I will add to the branch.

While going through the code I found

```
sage: M = MatrixSpace(GF(3),2,2).list()
sage: for m in M: m.set_immutable()
sage: len(M)

sage: len(set(map(hash,M)))

I don't think we have another option:
- testing if something is hashable doesn't test if something is mutable
- something that is immutable can be unhashable. Elements in monoids with an unsolved wordproblem are/should be examples of that
- python guidelines *say* that mutable elements should not be hashable, but this is not enforced.
- python simply doesn't provide a sure-fire way of testing if something is mutable.
- Note that even for properly hashable elements the internal data structure can still change (attributes, internal representation), as long as equality holds. But for reuse of elements those other attributes can still be important! So even hashability does not imply an element is safe for caching/reuse.
Feel free to extend the tests I've proposed. However, assuming 0 and 1 are hashable is not a good test for the stated goal.

<a id='comment:70'></a>The failing doctest in `parent.pyx` is very weird! The doctest expected a coercion

```
(matrix space over QQ, number field K) -> (matrix space over QQ)
```
but now it is

```
(matrix space over QQ, number field K) -> (matrix space over K)
```

The reason is that before we had (keeping the notation from the failing doctest)

```
sage: ma = a.matrix()
sage: cm = get_coercion_model()
sage: cm.get_action(ma.parent(), b.parent(), operator.mul, ma, b) is None
True
```
but with the patch applied

```
sage: cm.get_action(ma.parent(), b.parent(), operator.mul)
Right scalar multiplication by Number Field in b241562 with
  defining polynomial x^2 + 272118 on Full MatrixSpace of
  2 by 2 dense matrices over Rational Field
```

That is what stopgaps are made for: hard to fix quickly, and warn against mistakes.

I don't mind seing the status of this ticket change if we add a stopgap in the next release. That will not change the behaviour or anything, nor the doctests.

I'd be OK with that. When one ends up in  sage.structure.element.Element.__hash__ , performance will be down the drain anyway, and the warning only prints once.

Incidentally, the hash of symbolic expressions is *not* this one. Furthermore, the renaming feature mentioned in the ticket is highly incompatible with sage's model of immutability and names having mathematical significance. So resolving the title of the ticket will not address several of the perceived issues mentioned in the description.

> The failing doctest in `parent.pyx` is very weird!

I agree. In fact, I believe the doctest is exposing current buggy behaviour and the changed behaviour on this ticket is resolving this behaviour.

Currently (on unpatched sage) we have

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2 + 2*3*7*11)
sage: M = parent(a.matrix())
sage: K_into_MS = K.hom([a.matrix()])
sage: K._unset_coercions_used()
sage: M.get_action(K)
Right scalar multiplication by Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^2 + 462 on Full MatrixSpace of 2 by 2 dense matrices over Rational Field
```
and

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2 + 2*3*7*11)
sage: M = parent(a.matrix())
sage: K_into_MS = K.hom([a.matrix()])
sage: K._unset_coercions_used()
sage: K.register_embedding(K_into_MS)
sage: M.get_action(K) is None
True
```
so adding an embedding (which adds edges to the coercion graph) prevents a discovery of an action! I don't think that can ever be OK. 

Also note that anything that requires `_unset_coercions_used` to be called is a hack (basically by definition).

So, I'm not so sure we should be trying to preserve this behaviour.

The appropriate way to construct the field would be via

```
sage: Ktemp.<atemp> = NumberField(x^2 + 2*3*7*11)
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(atemp.minpoly(),embedding=atemp.matrix())
TypeError: <type 'sage.matrix.matrix_rational_dense.Matrix_rational_dense'> is not hashable and does not implement _cache_key()
```
which shows the real source of the change in behaviour: previously, the matrix used to define the embedding couldn't be used as a key in the `UniqueFactory` cache. On our very first commit, I introduce a `_cache_key` to compensate for the missing hash. So unhashable matrices can now be used as cache keys (but of course they shouldn't).

**Certificate:** You can toggle the behaviour by activating/deactivating the definition of _cache_key on Element.

So the doctest used to create a field that couldn't be directly constructed. With the introduced _cache_key, the field can be constructed.

During action discovery, the field does get reconstructed. This failed in an unexpected way before, which led to abandoning action discovery and then to using the specified embedding.

In our new setup, registering the embedding after the fact does not lead to breaking action discovery anymore, and hence we never get to using the embedding.

It is documented in `get_coercion_model().bin_op` that it first tries to find an action and then tries to find a coercion. So this doctest is relying on erroneous behaviour: There is an action between M and K, so the meaning of M.0 * K.0 is: let K.0 act on M.0, not "try to coerce K.0 into M and then multiply M.0 with the result".

**MAIN ACTION POINT:**: kill offending doctest.

Followup work to be done:
- do we want `_cache_key` on elements? For matrices, the implementation proposed here is robust (i.e., the key is basically what one could get from making an immutable copy of the thing).
- should embeddings take precedence over actions? I think that this would mean a horrible overhaul of the coercion framework, so I think the answer needs to be "no". People need to get used to the fact that implicit coercion can't do everything for you. Most of the time you're better of applying maps explicitly.

That's just because the matrix that is passed to "embedding" for the field that is reconstructed during action discovery is apparently newly constructed (probably it's `embedding_morphism(K.0)`) and hence mutable again (you can verify by adding `print self.is_mutable()` to `_cache_key`). So while you can make the field properly by passing an immutable (and hence hashable) matrix, stock sage still gives buggy behaviour, because subsequent coercion discovery tries to construct the field in an invalid way (and then eats the exception and abandons action discovery).

This is an argument to make _cache_key more generally available: apparently it's difficult to ensure that reconstructed construction parameters are hashable.

Can you give line numbers? I count only two definitions of `__hash__` in 
`src/sage/rings/polynomial/laurent_polynomial.pyx`, and they are on distinct classes:

```
sage.rings.polynomial.laurent_polynomial.LaurentPolynomial_mpair.__hash__
sage.rings.polynomial.laurent_polynomial.LaurentPolynomial_univariate.__hash__
```
respectively.

If `self.m` should be an `Integer` this is a good way of enforcing it. I don't think we did this before? perhaps this is covered in `element_class` already. I'm not familiar with this code (and didn't add that patch)

This seems like an argument for *not* adding the 0 hash to `Ideal_generic` then.

By the way, a small improvement might be to take the hash of the parent instead of a constant zero.

Given that the only possibly legitimate use would be to put ideals from the same ring together, I don't think that would be an actual improvement. I'd say that 0 would reflect more properly that the hash is worthless. I also think we should back up each 0 hash with a ticket to either devise a proper hash function or make these unhashable.

If it works without hash, let us go without of course!

The only reason was some failing doctests. It appeared that most comparisons were not properly implemented in crystals. I do not care, but I did not find any simpler way to fix the doctests.

The best would be to implement an `ElementWrapper_with_cmp`.

I really don't remember why I did this. The crystal code is weirdly written, and most of my commits were obtained by try and errors.

As Jeroen points out, this ticket needs another merge/rebase. I know I would screw that up. Would you be able to do it? I'd be fully in favour if you'd also implement some of the suggested changes here in the process.

> I actually used some, for example in `crystals/elementary_crystals.py`. But I tend to agree with Nils that in most cases, this will be useless (or badly used).


I don't think you did. The `hash(self.parent())` is on `AbstractSingleCrystalElement` which has it `eq` defined as `self.parent() is other.parent()`, so making the hash equal to that of the parent is entirely justified there.

I think the `self.element_class(self, ZZ(m))` looks justifiable, so I'd be OK with leaving that in.
