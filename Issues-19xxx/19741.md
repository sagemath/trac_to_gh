`PolynomialQuotientRing_generic.construction()` calls `is_field()` in attempt to pass `as_field=True` to `QuotientFunctor` in some cases. As far as I understand, this is not necessary, and probably even incorrect (`PolynomialQuotientRing_generic` has no `field()` method, only `number_field()`, and `NumberField`s are constructed using `AlgebraicExtensionFunctor`, not `QuotientFunctor`), but this breaks basic arithmetic when polynomial factorization over the cover ring is not implemented.

```
sage: Pol.<y> = CBF[]            
sage: Quo.<y> = Pol.quotient(y^3)
sage: CBF.zero()*y
...
NotImplementedError:
```
