Changing for example `is_bounded()` to a function just returning `True` in lattices is of little value. It is different thing if there is faster way to compute, say, `dimension()`, on lattices than on general posets.",

Corrected this. (To `CC[0] is P`.) Maybe it should be on `TESTS`-section. But at least now this works.
