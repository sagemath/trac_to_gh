This warning is useful:

```sh
    # Display a message if we actually installed something (using this
    # file, generated by sage-spkg, is a bit of a hack though)
    if [ -f "$SAGE_LOCAL/lib/sage-force-relocate.txt" ]; then
        echo
        echo "Warning: it might be needed to update the Sage library before"
        echo "installed packages work: you should run 'make' from \$SAGE_ROOT"
        echo "before running Sage."
    fi
```
Using `sage-force-relocate.txt` to determine when to display this message is a hack, but the message itself still makes sense.

That's not true. This is to catch "reverse dependencies": say you have a package A depending on B and you decide to (re)build B. Then you should also rebuild A before running Sage.

The problem with `make --question` is that the Sage library (i.e. Cython + distutils) does not support that. You can't do `./setup.py --question` to ask if Python dependencies are up-to-date.

> Or, even easier, print that warning simply after `make B`.

OK, please move this message to the end of `sage-spkg` then.

This is a bit sloppy. Why keep all the functions `update_pkgconfig_files()`, `make_scripts_relative()`, `sage_relocate()` if they aren't used anymore?

Either you run them every time a package is installed (like it used to be) or you never run them.

Second, the `check_processor_flags()` function becomes pointless since it's only run on the machine which created the binary, not on the machine running the binary. But maybe we should consider `check_processor_flags()` obsolete and just remove it.

Is that cynism really needed? Pointing out issues with a branch is not "holding the release process hostage".

I think you are "reverse bikeshedding": you're destroying half of the nuclear reactor but pretending that you are only repainting the bikeshed.

At least my patch is much safer than yours, because it really only changes the color of the bikeshed.

I don't believe that the messages are so misleading. The most common is

```
Forcing sage-location, probably because a new package was installed.
Updating various hardcoded paths...
(Please wait at most a few minutes.)
DO NOT INTERRUPT THIS.
```
which is not really wrong.

More seriously, you are of course right that the messages can be improved. However, having a properly functioning Sage is a much higher priority than getting the messages right (which *is* a bikeshedding issue!)
