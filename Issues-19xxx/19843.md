The problem with `make --question` is that the Sage library (i.e. Cython + distutils) does not support that. You can't do `./setup.py --question` to ask if Python dependencies are up-to-date.

That is intentional, there is no relocation after re-installing packages so we shouldn't mislead people into believing anything else.

Is that cynism really needed? Pointing out issues with a branch is not "holding the release process hostage".

I think you are "reverse bikeshedding": you're destroying half of the nuclear reactor but pretending that you are only repainting the bikeshed.

At least my patch is much safer than yours, because it really only changes the color of the bikeshed.

I don't believe that the messages are so misleading. The most common is

```
Forcing sage-location, probably because a new package was installed.
Updating various hardcoded paths...
(Please wait at most a few minutes.)
DO NOT INTERRUPT THIS.
```
which is not really wrong.

More seriously, you are of course right that the messages can be improved. However, having a properly functioning Sage is a much higher priority than getting the messages right (which *is* a bikeshedding issue!)
