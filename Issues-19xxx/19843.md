    # Display a message if we actually installed something (using this

Using `sage-force-relocate.txt` to determine when to display this message is a hack, but the message itself still makes sense.

The problem with `make --question` is that the Sage library (i.e. Cython + distutils) does not support that. You can't do `./setup.py --question` to ask if Python dependencies are up-to-date.

OK, please move this message to the end of `sage-spkg` then.

This branch is tested and works, any alternative implementation is just going to have lower chances of working. I'm at the sage gap workshop this week so I don't have time to rewrite this for no good reason whatsoever.

Feature requests for `check_processor_flags` should also go to a separate ticket.

Not every discussion/disagreement is "bikeshedding". I pointed out actual problems out with your branch (that `sage-location` is not re-run after re-installing packages).

Is that cynism really needed? Pointing out issues with a branch is not "holding the release process hostage".

I think you are "reverse bikeshedding": you're destroying half of the nuclear reactor but pretending that you are only repainting the bikeshed.

At least my patch is much safer than yours, because it really only changes the color of the bikeshed.

I don't believe that the messages are so misleading. The most common is

```
Forcing sage-location, probably because a new package was installed.
Updating various hardcoded paths...
(Please wait at most a few minutes.)
DO NOT INTERRUPT THIS.
```
which is not really wrong.

More seriously, you are of course right that the messages can be improved. However, having a properly functioning Sage is a much higher priority than getting the messages right (which *is* a bikeshedding issue!)
