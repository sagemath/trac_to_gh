Changed, but why? Cython seems to be able to infer that type.

I didn't check the C code. I didn't even know Cython could do that.


Something else: replace

```
raise IndexError("Number of columns of left must equal number of rows of right.")
```
by an `ArithmeticError`. The same exception occurs in Sage as `IndexError` and as `ArithmeticError` but I think the latter is the most suitable.

You also need to doctest this exception.

You should only use `_mul_` and `_add_` if you take advantage of `Element` typing. This is not the case here (Cython doesn't know what `get_unsafe()` returns).

By the way, do you know if there is a reason for `get_unsafe()` not to be `cdef RingElement`?

After reading the code in `element.pyx` I think I understand, thanks—though I still find the documentation a bit misleading.
