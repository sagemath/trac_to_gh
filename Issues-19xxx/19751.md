I didn't check the C code. I didn't even know Cython could do that.


Something else: replace

```
raise IndexError("Number of columns of left must equal number of rows of right.")
```
by an `ArithmeticError`. The same exception occurs in Sage as `IndexError` and as `ArithmeticError` but I think the latter is the most suitable.

You also need to doctest this exception.
