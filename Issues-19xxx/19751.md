Changed, but why? Cython seems to be able to infer that type.

I didn't check the C code. I didn't even know Cython could do that.


Something else: replace

```
raise IndexError("Number of columns of left must equal number of rows of right.")
```
by an `ArithmeticError`. The same exception occurs in Sage as `IndexError` and as `ArithmeticError` but I think the latter is the most suitable.

You also need to doctest this exception.

Fine, but could you please explain why? The way I understand it, calling `_add_()`/`_mul_()` will still be faster, if very slightly (if that's not the case, I guess the documentation in `element.pyx` needs to be fixed), and more importantly, it makes it clear that the arguments already have the same parent.

By the way, do you know if there is a reason for `get_unsafe()` not to be `cdef RingElement`?

After reading the code in `element.pyx` I think I understand, thanks—though I still find the documentation a bit misleading.
