I didn't check the C code. I didn't even know Cython could do that.


Something else: replace

```
raise IndexError("Number of columns of left must equal number of rows of right.")
```
by an `ArithmeticError`. The same exception occurs in Sage as `IndexError` and as `ArithmeticError` but I think the latter is the most suitable.

You also need to doctest this exception.

By the way, do you know if there is a reason for `get_unsafe()` not to be `cdef RingElement`?

`x._mul_(y)` is faster **if Cython knows** that `x` and `y` are of type `RingElement`. Otherwise, `x * y` is faster.

After reading the code in `element.pyx` I think I understand, thanks—though I still find the documentation a bit misleading.

Then why not `(<RingElement> x)._mul_(<RingElement> y)`? The the overhead might be negligible.
