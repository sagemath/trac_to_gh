This ticket implements a SAT solver by relying upon the MILP features of Sage.

This is not glorious, but at least the feature is available by default and we can assume it exists in all cases.

I do not like it either. But the doc of the same function in cryptominisat says that the function returns None when it is interrupted.

I don't believe that doc. From an example based on a doctest:

sage: sr = mq.SR(1,4,4,4,gf2=True,polybori=True)          # optional - cryptominisat
sage: F,s = sr.polynomial_system()                        # optional - cryptominisat
sage: cms = CryptoMiniSat(maxrestarts=10,verbosity=0)     # optional - cryptominisat
sage: phi = CNFEncoder(cms, F.ring())(F)                  # optional - cryptominisat

Right.

> 2. `Its performances` -> `Its performance`


Done.

> 3. `cryptominisat_available = True` -> `solver = 'cryptominisat'` and `cryptominisat_available = False` -> `solver = 'LP'`. That's a lot cleaner: you can remove the `solver is None` checks.


I'm an idiot.

> 4. Please fix the `deicison` typo also in `src/sage/sat/converters/polybori.py`


Done.
