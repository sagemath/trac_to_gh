See the doctest in the attached branch for one example that is failing.

I have made a few other edits like this, changing a `DiGraph` invocation to one with an explicit `format` parameter. I think we should eventually get them all (except for those where user freedom is intended, but I doubt we want that very often). Unfortunately I don't have the time to go through the whole library with this.
