Instead of this:

```
            for cls in FileClasses:
                if cls.is_magic(head):
                    try:
                        cls(fqn).perform_tests()
                    except TestException as exc:
                        ...
```
I would prefer

```
            for cls in FileClasses:
                try:
                    cls(fqn).perform_tests()
                except NotImplementedError:
                    pass
                except TestException as exc:
                    ...
```
or something along these lines. Not all file types can be determined by "magic" and perhaps `perform_tests()` might do some unsupported checks (like if `objdump` is not available).

For speed reasons I want to hang everything of the first 512 bytes; Just running "file" for each of the 50k files in Sage takes a long time. But reading the head of each is just about acceptable, about 10s with warm caches.

Non-Linux systems shouldn't have files with ELF magic. In fact, if they do then I'd like to get an error.

I don't want circular imports

That wasn't my point, I was saying to move the "magic" check to `ELFBinaryFile.__init__()` and raise `NotImplementedError` if it's not magic.
