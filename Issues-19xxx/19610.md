```
The extension modules linking against PARI should explicitly depend on the PARI headers. This is in particular true for `sage/ext/interrupt/interrupt.pyx`.

Since every module cimporting something from PARI will cimport `sage.libs.pari.types`, we add the explicit dependency there.

In order to have the correct distutils keywords for `sage/ext/interrupt/interrupt.pyx`, we cimport `sage.libs.pari.paridecl` there.

Maybe I misunderstood the purpose of this ticket (cf. the description I added), but after pulling the branch here, `interrupt.so` still gets linked to both PARI and GMP (i.e., MPIR).

(Probably you just intended a proper rebuild of it upon changes to libgmp, but the patch looks as if you intended to remove the libraries from the extension module.)

IMHO at most PARI should get linked to it.

Ok, I see, in `sage/libs/pari/paridecl.pxd`, there's (still)

Do we really need `gmp` there as well?

Certainly `interrupt.so` doesn't use/need GMP (but `PARI_SIGINT_*` from PARI), but can we (easily) remove GMP from it?

AFAICS, the declarations are only needed/used in `sage/ext/interrupt/implementation.c`, i.e., genuine C code, not Cython.

Anyway, I pushed a slightly cleaner version to [u/leif/19610_reviewer-remove_libgmp_from_interrupt.so](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/e12e9b61467b4109500c0da7f2490e25a4dbecc7).

Well, of course **PARI** needs GMP, but not (necessarily) modules using PARI; that's a transitive dependency.  Unless you link statically, you don't have to explicitly specify GMP (and you shouldn't), because the dependency of PARI on GMP is recorded in `libpari.so`.

If GMP changes, PARI will get rebuilt, and hence also modules depending on PARI.

The reason `libgmp` was listed **twice** (and different versions of it!) [comment:ticket:19589:18 in your ldd output] is exactly such overlinking.

No.  We've cleaned up `module_list.py` a couple of times in the past with respect to this.

Note that it's (only) *the common case* that you don't have to specify libraries used by the libraries you use.  (In particular, building the whole Sage library with the linker option `--as-needed` doesn't work, but would work for most modules.)

The main exceptions are:

Well, *you* asked general questions.

`interrupt.so` still does not need GMP, but with your current patch, GMP gets linked to it.  (Worse, not even the Cython code, `interrupt.*`, where `paridecl` gets imported, uses any PARI stuff.)  I agree that copy-pasting parts of PARI headers (although it's just a single line) is not nice, but that's more a problem of the PARI headers and I was simply getting bored of trying which to include and which not.  (Probably the top-level one is ok as well, but seems overkill to me.)

I still don't like the IMHO redundant `libraries = pari gmp` (in `paridecl.pxd`), but it's not a major issue either (until we or some people switch to PARI with a different kernel at least).

Perhaps cc some more reviewers, e.g. François.

There are certainly OSs which don't have shared/dynamic libraries...

But besides that their names/extensions vary, the above holds for all platforms supported by Sage, *AFAIK<sup>TM</sup>*.

It does need GMP since it uses PARI which needs GMP. It's true that the Cython code doesn't use anything of PARI or GMP, but the C code in `implementation.c` does.

Equivalently on OS X everything will be fine so long as all the `install_name`s are properly set to the right value.

Yes it will break if your system only use static libraries. Static libraries don't know where to get their other needed bits - unless you bundle them in in the first place.

I don't know if cygwin is properly equipped to deal with something like a `needed` section or even if it exists on windows (I'll confess ignorance in that matter). I also don't know how things will go on BSD, they are using elf but some bits may depend on the libc implementation and of course `ld`.

Linking with `gmp` is not useful on OS X and linux but it won't hurt.

I should say I haven't read the whole thread, and now that I see more of it. there are some points that can be made:
* it is of course legal to underlink a library
* only executable need to have all their symbols resolved

A case in point is vanilla `gsl`. libgsl needs a `cblas` library but it is not linked against `cblas` implementation (unless you do something). So there is no entry for a `cblas` in the elf table. When you build an application against libgsl you have to provide a cblas library whether your application use cblas function or not, to resolve the `cblas` symbols in libgsl.

If libpari was underlinked like that you would have to provide your libgmp/libmpir all the time.

Regarding your slides Gentoo applies "the chasing your tail method" (recompile on soname change). I think `sage` fits in that category too. I'll note that if you do it correctly a change in soname for libgmp will trigger a rebuild of libpari but not of interrupt.so _and it shouldn't have too_ if libpari didn't change its soname there is no impact on interrupt.so.

If your handling of soname is not done properly or your are overlinking you are exposing yourself to excessive rebuilding. Making sure your handling of soname is right is the hard bit. Only now do we have interesting mechanism that will trigger rebuild on soname change in Gentoo and I won't pretend that every gentoo dev understand them properly.

It is (tautologically) true on every operating system where you can link shared libraries to other shared libraries.

But the dependency is wrong (interrupt does not depend on gmp).

Cygwin doesn't really have shared libraries, it uses a static library hack (the Cygwin import library) at link time. 

So the real question is should we
* Overlink on all platforms
* Artificially inject all libraries on Cygwin only (via LDFLAGS, say)

Sage has always chosen the first option, so there are probably many overlinked modules in Sage.

<div id="comment:45" align="right">comment:45</div>

I suggest to fix the dependency here and fix the overlinking issue elsewhere (e.g. using leif branch).

As far as Cygwin is concerned, the situation is quite good actually: you just need to have at hand libs directly used by your executable/library and feed them to the linker with appropriate flags as I just tested on a VM.
If these libraries need further libraries then everything is resolved at run time.
So in the linking ticket, we can drop the `gmp` library.

The main issue with cygwin is that the need above is mandatory: if you wanna use a gmp function (whatever it relies on, even further libraries) then you need to tell it to the linker whereas linux is more negligent about that and just bet that at runtime every undefined symbol will be resolved.
And many times people modified a random Sage cython file, use some gmp function (typically `mpn_popcount` don't ask me why :)) and forgott to make gmp a dependency.
Nowadays, thanks to Jeroen work, it should be less an issue as when people want to use `mpn_popcount` they have to cimport it and it will automagically tell the linker that gmp has to be linked in.
