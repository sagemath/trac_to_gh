With the implementation of Stieltjes-constants from #19834 the expansion of the zeta-function can be improved to something like

```
sage: zeta(s).series(s==1)
1/(s-1) + euler_gamma - stieltjes(1)/2 * (s-1) + stieltjes(2)/6 * (s-1)^2  + ...
```

(see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stieltjes_constants).

I think I can adapt this and make a pull request on github; at least if there is a stieltjes-function.

<a id='comment:3'></a>I've created a pull request [here](https://github.com/pynac/pynac/pull/122). Assuming this gets merged into pynac, the doctest here:
   https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/master/src/sage/functions/transcendental.py#L81-L82
will fail and has to be removed in the ticket where pynac is updated.

This ticket here would then add the respective doctest of the form

```
sage: zeta(x).series(x==1, 4)
1*(x - 1)^(-1) + (euler_gamma) + (-1/2*stieltjes(1))*(x - 1) + (1/6*stieltjes(2))*(x - 1)^2 + (-1/24*stieltjes(3))*(x - 1)^3 + Order((x - 1)^4)
```

Or do you suggest a different procedure?
