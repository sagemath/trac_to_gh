As discussed on #18972, the following three entries should not be in `designs.<tab>`, which is for the moment meant to hold the constructors of our database of designs, i.e. `OA`, `TD`, `t`-designs, etc ...

```
designs.IncidenceStructure
designs.Hypergraph
designs.BlockDesign
```

While our policy may eventually change on this respect, this branch enforces what I believe is the current standard.
