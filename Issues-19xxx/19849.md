There's a lot of things that won't yet work with the stl output and other output.  E.g. parametric surfaces, graphics3d groups, and so forth.

We should at the least document explicit examples of what doesn't work, or (better) find ways to make those work.

**Status:** new

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19849
