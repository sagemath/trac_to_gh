Calling `abs()` on certain expressions can yield something which is not guaranteed to be evaluated as a real number:

```
sage: abs(x^2)
x*conjugate(x)
sage: abs(x)^2
x*conjugate(x)
```

In the presence of numerical noise, the expression `x*conjugate(x)` can have a non-zero imaginary part. And even if there is no noise, the type would be wrong: complex instead of real.

This causes the following doctest failure:

```

<a id='comment:2'></a>Isn't this sacrificing a lot of numerical performance? At least IEEE 754-2008 contains fused multiply-add.

The doctest is

```
            sage: x = var('x', domain='real')
            sage: s = abs((1+I*x)^4); s
            (I*x + 1)^2*(-I*x + 1)^2
            sage: s._plot_fast_callable(x)
            <sage.ext.interpreters.wrapper_py.Wrapper_py object at ...>
            sage: s._plot_fast_callable(x)(10)
            10201
            sage: abs((I*10+1)^4)
            10201
            sage: plot(s)
            Graphics object consisting of 1 graphics primitive
```
Isn't the real problem that abs does not default to `hold=True`

```
sage: ((1+I*x)^4).abs()
(I*x + 1)^2*(-I*x + 1)^2
```
so something that ought to be manifestly real is not. Compare:

```
sage: abs((1+I*x)^4)._plot_fast_callable(x)(RDF(10))
10201.00000000001
sage: type(_)
<type 'sage.rings.complex_double.ComplexDoubleElement'>
```
vs.

```
sage: ((1+I*x)^4).abs(hold=True)._plot_fast_callable(x)(RDF(10))
10201.000000000005
sage: type(_)
<type 'sage.rings.real_double.RealDoubleElement'>
```

I'm not sure.

What I am pretty sure about is: multiplying `x*x.conj()` as complex numbers is a bad way of evaluating the absolute value. Fast callables using abs should return real and not complex values. And for that we need to hold abs. At which point the issue of the numerical noise in the imaginary part is pretty meaningless.

With x87, it is reasonable to assume that the whole imaginary part will be evaluated with 80 bits, so there won't be numerical noise either (see also the successful i386 buildbot reports).

Volker's point is about being "manifestly" real, which means: an expression which will always give a real result when evaluated, even if sub-expressions introduce numerical noise.

An expression like

```
e^(4*I*x) + e^(-4*I*x)
```
is not manifestly real, since there is no guarantee that the imaginary parts of the two terms will *exactly* cancel out.

> * Expanding polynomials whose coefficients are radical expressions over QQ[I] are not safe
 
Is this decidable without expansion? Simply weeding out rational exponents will make `(I<sup>(5/4))*(I</sup>(3/4))` a false negative. OTOH first expanding then checking would be costly.

If so, I no longer think it useful.

Of course it **is** possible to decide if a radical is real or not, for example using QQbar.

Can't we just `abs(hold=True)` by default? You can always simplify or set `hold=False` if you don't want that.
