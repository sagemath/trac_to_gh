Any convex cone can be decomposed into a linear subspace (its lineality space) and a pointed cone (the intersection of the original cone with the orthogonal complement of the lineality space). This can be thought of as a special case of the Motzkin decomposition for convex cones.

The name "Motzkin decomposition" for cones is nonstandard, but the name typically used to refer to the result is "cone decomposition" which is not enlightening.

I don't think "cone's" is correct English, at least it sounds weird.

The way you set it up, it is NOT the direct sum, but Minkowski sum.

If Motzkin decomposition is not standard, why is it called like this here? I mean it would be nice to elaborate that it is not just your invention ;-)

I would put extra check to handle corner cases so that the strict component of a strictly convex cone `is` this cone in Python sense, same with subspaces.

I clarified it to be the Minkowski sum of orthogonal things.


> If Motzkin decomposition is not standard, why is it called like this here? I mean it would be nice to elaborate that it is not just your invention ;-)


There is a ".. NOTE" stating that the name is nonstandard. The "cone decomposition theorem" is variously attributed to Motzkin, and his decomposition of polyhedra is closely related, but I'm prevented by the language barrier from seeing just how appropriate the name might be. Supposedly the pointed/subspace decomposition was used in the original paper on the double description method but I can't find that online either.

I don't mind changing the name -- got any ideas? The name "lineal decomposition" doesn't seem to be taken.

If we're willing to use the word "pointed" to mean "strictly convex," then there's also `pointed_decomposition` and `pointed_subspace_decomposition`. That last one is probably the most descriptive of them all, but having a method named `strictly_convex_subspace_decomposition` would be getting a bit ridiculous lengthwise.

Ok, done.

Ah, sorry, got carried away when I replaced "direct sum."

Unfortunately they do need to be orthogonal -- that's what makes the decomposition useful, and is what people expect. A lot of results for strictly convex cones can be made to work in general by extending them to the decomposition. One place I use this is to show that a cone is closed. If its strictly convex component is closed, then the whole thing is, because you can take a convergent sequence and show that the components converge where they live. That doesn't work unless the components are orthogonal.

But how to fix it... I could remove all mention of orthogonality? Then the docstring would say that you get a strictly convex cone and a linear subspace, but it wouldn't say that they're orthogonal. As an implementation detail, they would be, of course. One problem there is that I really like that test with the orthogonal projectors, but I could move that into my own personal library.

I can fake orthogonality with `sublattice_complement`. For example,

```
L_perp_gens = [ dir*l for dir in [1,-1]
                      for l in L.sublattice_complement().gens() ]
L_perp = Cone(L_perp_gens, self.lattice(), check=False)
```

But the docs mention that the lifting is non-canonical so I don't think it's any better than coercing the rays of the dual.

Or, I could just leave this function out? I need the projectors test, and it's a nice "look what I can do" function, but the function itself isn't critical to me. I could skip it entirely, and leave the function along with the orthogonal projectors test in my own library.

No problem, I don't want to waste time on the things that aren't important. I've inlined this function into the test suite for the paper.


> The current implementation returns a cone which lives in the ambient lattice which spans L. I would argue that it should be a sublattice of the ambient lattice, not a cone at all. 


The choice to make it a cone was mostly for symmetry in the strictly convex / solid cases, and so that things like `L.contains()`, `L.is_trivial()`, and `K is L` would work. Nevertheless, I don't know WTF I was thinking with this test:

```
sage: (C,L) = K.decomposition()
sage: x = K.random_element(ring=QQ)
sage: C.contains(x) or L.contains(x)
True
```

That's false in stupid cases like the sum of two generators, one from `C` and one from `L`. Guess I had bad luck with the random number generator. And the test after that should be,

```
x.is_zero() or not (C.contains(x) and L.contains(x))
```
