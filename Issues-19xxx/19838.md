```
sage: RBF = RealBallField()
log(RBF(5), 2)
```
Does not work. However, with #19837, this kind of works; it returns

```
([1.609437912434100 +/- 5.05e-16])/log(2)
```
i.e. something in the symbolic ring, but the result should be a real ball.

Moreover,

```
sage: RBF(5).log(2)
```
should work as well. (At the moment only `.log()` works.)

Note that

```
sage: log(RBF(5), RBF(2))
[2.32192809488736 +/- 3.04e-15]
```
already works.
