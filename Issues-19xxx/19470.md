No sir, all clear, it is just a (not so early) morning disease. However it strikes me that a ticket description is not substitute for documentation. The only documentation available is

```
+        update: Update a package. This modifies the Sage sources. 
+    
+        $ sage-package update pari 2015 --url=http://localhost/pari/tarball.tgz
```
which I assume needs to be run from a sage shell.


Other than that lgtm.

Yes I can do that I guess. I am in two minds. Do I think `sage --package` should be in the help. Yes I do, it's the right thing to do.

Does that give more work in `sage-on-gentoo`? Absolutely, one more thing I will have to chop.

--------

The package script is used to manage third-party tarballs.

Usage:

* apropos: Find up to 5 package names that are close to the given name
  
  $ sage --package apropos python
  Did you mean: cython, ipython, python2, python3, patch?

* config: Print the configuration
  
  $ sage --package config
  Configuration:
    * log = info
    * interactive = True

* list: Print a list of all available packages
  
  $ sage --package list | sort
  4ti2
  arb
  atlas
  autotools
  [...]
  zn_poly

* name: Find the package name given a tarball filename
  
  $ sage --package name pari-2.8-1564-gdeac36e.tar.gz
  pari

* tarball: Find the tarball filename given a package name
  
  $ sage --package tarball pari
  pari-2.8-1564-gdeac36e.tar.gz

* update: Update a package. This modifies the Sage sources. 
  
  $ sage --package update pari 2015 --url=http://localhost/pari/tarball.tgz
```
