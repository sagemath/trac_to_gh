No sir, all clear, it is just a (not so early) morning disease. However it strikes me that a ticket description is not substitute for documentation. The only documentation available is

```
+        update: Update a package. This modifies the Sage sources. 
+    
+        $ sage-package update pari 2015 --url=http://localhost/pari/tarball.tgz
```
which I assume needs to be run from a sage shell.


Other than that lgtm.

    * interactive = True

* list: Print a list of all available packages
  
  $ sage --package list | sort
  4ti2
  arb
  atlas
  autotools
  [...]
  zn_poly

* name: Find the package name given a tarball filename
  
  $ sage --package name pari-2.8-1564-gdeac36e.tar.gz
  pari

* tarball: Find the tarball filename given a package name
  
  $ sage --package tarball pari
