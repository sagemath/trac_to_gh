This will be useful along with the changes I'm making in #6102, which I think will be our first naturally graded finite-dimensional algebra in Sage.

sage: A = GradedModulesWithBasis(ZZ).example()
sage: A.homogeneous_component(3).an_element()   # not printed like elements of A
3*B[[1, 1, 1]] + 3*B[[2, 1]] + B[[3]]

One mathematical issue: in defining `homogeneous_component`, you have

```
category = ModulesWithBasis(self.category().base_ring())
```
A homogeneous component of an *R*-module need not be an *R*-module itself in a natural way: for example, if the base ring is the graded ring *R*=*k*[*x*, *x*<sup>-1</sup>] with *x* in some nonzero degree, then for any homogeneous component of any graded *R*-module, *x* would have to act trivially (because *x* has nonzero degree). On the other hand, *x* is supposed to be invertible.

It will always be a module over the degree 0 part of the base ring, though.

{
    "body": "<a id='comment:8'>Comment 8:</a>\nJohn: I fear that this notion of grading is not currently implemented in Sage (again, hardly anyone's deliberate design choice, but an artifact of ungraded base rings being the de-facto standard in combinatorics). Almost all of the current code in `FilteredModulesWithBasis` currently assumes that the base ring is ungraded :(\n\nIncidentally, IMHO this issue shows that we are mistaken in the assumption that in order to equip an algebra with a grading, we should add `degree` and similar functions to the class. Many algebras have several natural gradings, and each of them comes with its own notion of a graded module. When you speak of a \"graded R[x]-module\", you have to specify whether x has degree 1 or 0 (or anything else); even in combinatorics, both of these cases happen. So if/when we make R[x] into a graded ring, what should its grading be? I think it shouldn't. There should be a two graded rings, called `PolynomialRing(QQ).trivial_grading()` and `PolynomialRing().degree_grading()` or something like this, while `PolynomialRing(QQ)` itself should just be a `QQ`-algebra. Actually the `trivial_grading()` function should be defined generically on any module and return the corresponding graded module with trivial grading.

<a id='comment:8'>Comment 8:</a>
John: I fear that this notion of grading is not currently implemented in Sage (again, hardly anyone's deliberate design choice, but an artifact of ungraded base rings being the de-facto standard in combinatorics). Almost all of the current code in `FilteredModulesWithBasis` currently assumes that the base ring is ungraded :(

Incidentally, IMHO this issue shows that we are mistaken in the assumption that in order to equip an algebra with a grading, we should add `degree` and similar functions to the class. Many algebras have several natural gradings, and each of them comes with its own notion of a graded module. When you speak of a "graded R[x]-module", you have to specify whether x has degree 1 or 0 (or anything else); even in combinatorics, both of these cases happen. So if/when we make R[x] into a graded ring, what should its grading be? I think it shouldn't. There should be a two graded rings, called `PolynomialRing(QQ).trivial_grading()` and `PolynomialRing().degree_grading()` or something like this, while `PolynomialRing(QQ)` itself should just be a `QQ`-algebra. Actually the `trivial_grading()` function should be defined generically on any module and return the corresponding graded module with trivial grading. And there can be further gradings and filtrations likewise (I can see good uses for filtered the tensor algebra by word length, number of distinct letters, maximal multiplicity of a letter, etc. -- there is no way the code should decide between them for the user!).

For this situation, what about code like

```
try:
    R = self.base_ring().homogeneous_component(0)
    # or R = self.base_ring().base_ring()??
except AttributeError:
    R = self.base_ring()
category = ModulesWithBasis(self.category().R)
```
This may end up calling `homogeneous_component` recursively, but eventually that should end with an ungraded base ring.

Yes, I also agree that we need to allow for multiple possible gradings. I think this has been discussed before. To construct a graded ring you should specify a ring and a grading on it, and different gradings give different graded rings.

So if we were decided to do do the above, then we should add coordinate ring support in #19448 and make that a dependency of this one.

Alternatively we could just raise a `NotImplementedError` for now if the module and base ring are both graded.

I can also reproduce this by just running the tests on `modules_with_basis.py`.

I tried the same hack on #15536 and I got errors. To the extreme, I made the prime check on the input for `Zmod` and removed the category refinement, and I *still* got errors.

I am strongly inclined to believe that it is not an issue with category refinement, but instead something is wrong with how the category MRO is being constructed. I would want to simultaneously fix for both #15536 and this, but I'm fairly convinced they are different issues.

Yet another data point. I created a separate class and file for the new category, and then set `FiniteDimensionalModulesWithBasis.Filtered` to this new class (also now inheriting from `FilteredModulesCategory` by following what `GradedHopfAlgebrasWithBasis` does). This now does not set the correct category as

```
sage: (ModulesWithBasis(ZZ).Filtered().FiniteDimensional()
....:  == ModulesWithBasis(ZZ).FiniteDimensional().Filtered())
False
```
This is on `u/tscrim/test-19397`. <edit>Fix bad copying</edit>

I have absolutely no idea what is going on. I would appreciate some comments from those that implemented how the category code handles these things.

Why is that not correct? If I understand correctly, one meta-axiom (i.e., an axiom for our axiom framework) is that application of axioms commutes. Thus, if you have a category C and axioms A and B, then `C.A().B()` will always be identical with `C.B().A()`.

This will definitely do as a workaround. We should add an additional check to make sure `self._indices` is finite and raise an error if not, otherwise the fallback for `homogeneous_component_basis` will run forever.

Although if we are changing error messages, I think we should also change that `assert` to raise a `ValueError` on input because it is checking user input (and I like the convention that an `assert` is something that is expected to always be true).

Minor point, but I don't think this import is needed anymore

```
from sage.categories.category_with_axiom import CategoryWithAxiom_over_base_ring
```

We will also need a follow-up ticket creating the proper (sub)category with an explanation that it causes an MRO failure.

I have found that calling `list` can very often catch infinite sets. So I would do this change

```diff
-S = [i for i in self._indices if self.degree_on_basis(i) == d]
+S = [i for i in list(self._indices) if self.degree_on_basis(i) == d]
```
If this sounds good to you, I can do it as I also want to add a comment saying this will be moved once MRO issues are fixed when creating a the finite-dimensional category.
