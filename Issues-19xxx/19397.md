This will be useful along with the changes I'm making in #6102, which I think will be our first naturally graded finite-dimensional algebra in Sage.

Is this a problem?

```
sage: A = GradedModulesWithBasis(ZZ).example()
sage: A.homogeneous_component(3).an_element()   # not printed like elements of A
3*B[[1, 1, 1]] + 3*B[[2, 1]] + B[[3]]
sage: a = A.homogeneous_component(3).an_element()
sage: a in A
False
```
Also, `A(a)` leads to a `NotImplementedError`. So once you have an element in a homogeneous component, there isn't an obvious way to view it as an element of the whole module.

One mathematical issue: in defining `homogeneous_component`, you have

```
category = ModulesWithBasis(self.category().base_ring())
```
A homogeneous component of an *R*-module need not be an *R*-module itself in a natural way: for example, if the base ring is the graded ring *R*=*k*[*x*, *x*<sup>-1</sup>] with *x* in some nonzero degree, then for any homogeneous component of any graded *R*-module, *x* would have to act trivially (because *x* has nonzero degree). On the other hand, *x* is supposed to be invertible.

It will always be a module over the degree 0 part of the base ring, though.

For this situation, what about code like

```
try:
    R = self.base_ring().homogeneous_component(0)
    # or R = self.base_ring().base_ring()??
except AttributeError:
    R = self.base_ring()
category = ModulesWithBasis(self.category().R)
```
This may end up calling `homogeneous_component` recursively, but eventually that should end with an ungraded base ring.

Yes, I also agree that we need to allow for multiple possible gradings. I think this has been discussed before. To construct a graded ring you should specify a ring and a grading on it, and different gradings give different graded rings.

However there is a technical problem with doing that in the short-term in that `submodule` currently does not differentiate between coordinate rings and base rings (think `ZZ`-submodule in a `QQ`-module). See also Jeroen's comments in #18310.

So if we were decided to do do the above, then we should add coordinate ring support in #19448 and make that a dependency of this one.

Alternatively we could just raise a `NotImplementedError` for now if the module and base ring are both graded.

Why is that not correct? If I understand correctly, one meta-axiom (i.e., an axiom for our axiom framework) is that application of axioms commutes. Thus, if you have a category C and axioms A and B, then `C.A().B()` will always be identical with `C.B().A()`.

This will definitely do as a workaround. We should add an additional check to make sure `self._indices` is finite and raise an error if not, otherwise the fallback for `homogeneous_component_basis` will run forever.

Although if we are changing error messages, I think we should also change that `assert` to raise a `ValueError` on input because it is checking user input (and I like the convention that an `assert` is something that is expected to always be true).

Minor point, but I don't think this import is needed anymore

```
from sage.categories.category_with_axiom import CategoryWithAxiom_over_base_ring
```

We will also need a follow-up ticket creating the proper (sub)category with an explanation that it causes an MRO failure.

I guess I don't know the best way to go about this. If there is no `subset` method (for example), then check `self._indices.is_finite()`. If this fails, what error should we raise -- the lack of `subset` or the failure of finiteness? Or just a general error about the set of indices not being well enough implemented? We can break things down into lots of cases, but that seems like overkill for this piece of error-checking.

I agree.

I have found that calling `list` can very often catch infinite sets. So I would do this change

```diff
-S = [i for i in self._indices if self.degree_on_basis(i) == d]
+S = [i for i in list(self._indices) if self.degree_on_basis(i) == d]
```
If this sounds good to you, I can do it as I also want to add a comment saying this will be moved once MRO issues are fixed when creating a the finite-dimensional category.
