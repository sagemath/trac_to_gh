This will be useful along with the changes I'm making in #6102, which I think will be our first naturally graded finite-dimensional algebra in Sage.

Is this a problem?

```
sage: A = GradedModulesWithBasis(ZZ).example()
sage: A.homogeneous_component(3).an_element()   # not printed like elements of A
3*B[[1, 1, 1]] + 3*B[[2, 1]] + B[[3]]
sage: a = A.homogeneous_component(3).an_element()
sage: a in A
False
```
Also, `A(a)` leads to a `NotImplementedError`. So once you have an element in a homogeneous component, there isn't an obvious way to view it as an element of the whole module.

One mathematical issue: in defining `homogeneous_component`, you have

```
category = ModulesWithBasis(self.category().base_ring())
```
A homogeneous component of an *R*-module need not be an *R*-module itself in a natural way: for example, if the base ring is the graded ring *R*=*k*[*x*, *x*<sup>-1</sup>] with *x* in some nonzero degree, then for any homogeneous component of any graded *R*-module, *x* would have to act trivially (because *x* has nonzero degree). On the other hand, *x* is supposed to be invertible.

It will always be a module over the degree 0 part of the base ring, though.

John: I fear that this notion of grading is not currently implemented in Sage (again, hardly anyone's deliberate design choice, but an artifact of ungraded base rings being the de-facto standard in combinatorics). Almost all of the current code in `FilteredModulesWithBasis` currently assumes that the base ring is ungraded :(

Incidentally, IMHO this issue shows that we are mistaken in the assumption that in order to equip an algebra with a grading, we should add `degree` and similar functions to the class. Many algebras have several natural gradings, and each of them comes with its own notion of a graded module. When you speak of a "graded R[x]-module", you have to specify whether x has degree 1 or 0 (or anything else); even in combinatorics, both of these cases happen. So if/when we make R[x] into a graded ring, what should its grading be? I think it shouldn't.

For this situation, what about code like

```
try:
    R = self.base_ring().homogeneous_component(0)
    # or R = self.base_ring().base_ring()??
except AttributeError:
    R = self.base_ring()
category = ModulesWithBasis(self.category().R)
```
This may end up calling `homogeneous_component` recursively, but eventually that should end with an ungraded base ring.

Yes, I also agree that we need to allow for multiple possible gradings. I think this has been discussed before. To construct a graded ring you should specify a ring and a grading on it, and different gradings give different graded rings.

I can also reproduce this by just running the tests on `modules_with_basis.py`.

I tried the same hack on #15536 and I got errors. To the extreme, I made the prime check on the input for `Zmod` and removed the category refinement, and I *still* got errors.

I am strongly inclined to believe that it is not an issue with category refinement, but instead something is wrong with how the category MRO is being constructed. I would want to simultaneously fix for both #15536 and this, but I'm fairly convinced they are different issues.

Yet another data point. I created a separate class and file for the new category, and then set `FiniteDimensionalModulesWithBasis.Filtered` to this new class (also now inheriting from `FilteredModulesCategory` by following what `GradedHopfAlgebrasWithBasis` does). This now does not set the correct category as

```
sage: (ModulesWithBasis(ZZ).Filtered().FiniteDimensional()
....:  == ModulesWithBasis(ZZ).FiniteDimensional().Filtered())
False
```
This is on `u/tscrim/test-19397`. <edit>Fix bad copying</edit>

I have absolutely no idea what is going on. I would appreciate some comments from those that implemented how the category code handles these things.

Why is that not correct? If I understand correctly, one meta-axiom (i.e., an axiom for our axiom framework) is that application of axioms commutes. Thus, if you have a category C and axioms A and B, then `C.A().B()` will always be identical with `C.B().A()`.

This will definitely do as a workaround. We should add an additional check to make sure `self._indices` is finite and raise an error if not, otherwise the fallback for `homogeneous_component_basis` will run forever.

Although if we are changing error messages, I think we should also change that `assert` to raise a `ValueError` on input because it is checking user input (and I like the convention that an `assert` is something that is expected to always be true).

Minor point, but I don't think this import is needed anymore

```
from sage.categories.category_with_axiom import CategoryWithAxiom_over_base_ring
```

We will also need a follow-up ticket creating the proper (sub)category with an explanation that it causes an MRO failure.

I have found that calling `list` can very often catch infinite sets. So I would do this change

```diff
-S = [i for i in self._indices if self.degree_on_basis(i) == d]
+S = [i for i in list(self._indices) if self.degree_on_basis(i) == d]
```
If this sounds good to you, I can do it as I also want to add a comment saying this will be moved once MRO issues are fixed when creating a the finite-dimensional category.
