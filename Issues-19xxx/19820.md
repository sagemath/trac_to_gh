Right now, a comparison by the underlying `__dict__` is done, which causes problems when trying to define a cached method on a morphism. We need to implement a better `__eq__` for each subclass with more controllable behavior. See the discussion on #19609.

See also #21894 which collects similarly broken implementations of `__eq__`.

Why is there no `__ne__` implementation? I do not really see where such an implementation should come from, i.e., it just checks inequality on generators I believe. In fact (without claiming that this has any mathematical content)

```
sage: f = X.module_morphism(on_basis=X.monomial, zero=X.monomial(0), category=Sets())
sage: 
sage: g = X.module_morphism(on_basis=X.monomial, zero=X.zero(), category=Sets())
sage: 
sage: f == g
False
sage: f != g
False
```
So, I guess we should override the `_richcmp_` implementation instead.

To be honest, I do not really understand what much if this code is about, so I might have broken something.
