Funny. I had somewhere in my head that int and long were the same size.

Anyway, why should we downgrade those uint32 to int exactly? `O_o`

on 32-bit systems that's true :-)

Note that the C standard doesn't say much about this. On Windows for example, `long` is always 32-bit (even on 64-bit systems). There might be systems where `int` is 64-bit.

-1.

Why should this graph code use a type of at least 32 bits? Where does the arbitrary number 32 come from? Why not `int_fast16_t` or `int_fast64_t` then?

If you don't want `int`, I'd go with `long` then which is also guaranteed to be at least 32 bits and which matches the actual return type of `bitset_first_in_complement()`.

> you should never use the old `int` / `long` except to match legacy libraries, its bad style and very hard to write 100% standards-compliant code.

Really, why that? I would say that you should always use types like `long` unless you need a specific bit-length.

I did not check this specific code but uint32_t probably comes from the data structure "static_sparse_graph", which uses them.

Then, as David said, this algorithm does not need uint32_t -- it would not run. The 31 bits of int32_t would do, and 16 bits would probably be sufficient.

> Really, why that? I would say that you should always use types like `long` unless you need a specific bit-length. 

Here we want to specify the bit length, because the smallest the type is the better it will be cached.  We will read memory very very often in that code.

Hello,

the algorithm has time complexity `O(n^3)` and space complexity `O(n^2)`. So we will certainly not use it on graphs with 100,000 nodes (I can't on my laptop).

I was using `uint32_t` since `static_sparse_graph` uses it, but I agree that `long` is more appropriate with `bitset_first_in_complement()`. So I can use `long` for all indexes, or a more appropriate type if any.
For the arrays, all values stored in that array are in range `1..n`. So either I use a 16 bits type and add a test at the beginning of the method in case `n` needs more than that, or I use any type with at least 32 bits. Well, `uint32_t` is good for that.

Let me know.

David.

If you need only 16 bits then there is of course `int_fast16_t`. Its definition is analogous to plain `int` except that the latter has no promise of being a particularly fast choice. I don't care about the actual bitwidth, it should just be reflected (and easily readable) in the code.

Replying to [@jdemeyer](#comment%3A14):

But not guaranteed to be particularly fast.

I.e. the "legacy libraries" case.

But by using `long` you are already asking for a particular bit width, except that it does not document the intent (how many Sage contributors know the specs for `long`?). Usually, you see `long` because
* the author mistakenly believes that it is the longest int type
* the author mistakenly believes that it can hold a pointer
* the author mistakenly believes that it is at least 64-bit
* the author mistakenly believes that it is 64-bit on a 64-bit machine
* cargo cult, i.e., to match legacy code

With the C99 data types you just need to answer
* what is the minimum bit-width required
* do I need to optimize for space or speed
and the resulting program inherently documents it. Its so much better, a total slam-dunk.

I can play that game too:

Usually, you see `int_fastN_t` because
* the author mistakenly believes that his code will never need more than N bits (think "640K should be enough for everybody")
* the author mistakenly believes that `int_fastN_t` will yield the fastest possible code (not true if the code is memory-bound)

> what is the minimum bit-width required

I don't think that one *should* always answer this question. There are valid use cases for types which have different sizes on 32-bit and 64-bit systems.

Today, with sage 6.9.rc3 and without this patch, I have a segfault!

With this patch it's working.

I don't know which is the best type to use and above discussion confuses me.

What I do know is that this patch solves a segfault and so is needed.

Best,
David.
