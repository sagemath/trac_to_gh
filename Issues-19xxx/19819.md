Changes vs 0.5.3:
* fix expansion of `abs(power)` (#19797)
* fix a wrong function option with `zeta/zeta2` (#19799)
* fix wrong formula for `tan(...).imag()` (#19791)
* fix `mpq_pythonhash` (#19310)
* change hash type to `long` (#19310)
* expand `exp(m/n*pi*I)` with trig functions if they can be expanded (#19738)
* start changing libtool version with each release
* performance: in `exp_eval` check for `Pi` and `I` before trying to divide
* performance: much less canonicalizations of GMP rationals
* performance: cache pseries coeff accesses in `pseries::mul_series`
* performance: `GinacFunction`s for `cot/acot`
* C++11: add `override` where possible

`long` doesn't guarantee anything in term of width. If you want something that is 64bit wide, you better be explicit about it. The `C` standard is rather annoying when it comes to variable size, especially `long` types - unless I missed something in a newer version of the standard.

These I did mindlessly to preserve the result:

```
Failed example:
    QQbar(e^(pi*I/3))
Expected:
    0.500000000000000? + 0.866025403784439?*I
Got:
    0.50000000000000000? + 0.866025403784439?*I
```
This one cannot be fixed otherwise:

```
Failed example:
    a.composition(exp(I*pi/3), exp)
Exception raised:
      File "/home/ralf/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/symbolic/expression_conversions.py", line 866, in composition

How do you let the original succeed? Attempts with tolerance didn't work:

```
sage: N(integrate(sin(x^2)/(x^2), x, 1, infinity))

Because of the interface change or the amount of changes?

I just looked into this a bit more and the re-ordering of `beta(a,b)` indeed depends on the hashes of `a` and `b`. Unfortunately, the hashes of expressions are random. So, in the case of

```
beta(1/2*x, 3)
```
we know that `hash(3) = 3` but the value of `hash(1/2*x)` is just random.
