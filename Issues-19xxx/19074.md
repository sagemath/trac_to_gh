Implementation of vanilla conjugate gradient method for solving sparse matrices mod N. Should be faster than built-in methods for matrices that are highly sparse. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_gradient_method for details.

--Note: possibly superior functionality available in unexposed function _solve_right_nonsingular_square, will verify before continuing.--
