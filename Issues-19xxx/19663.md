LGTM for arb. However, I think there is an issue with Pynac linking to GMP:

```
.libs/libpynac_la-numeric.o: In function `ZN5GiNaC7numericD2Ev':
/home/Travis/sage/local/var/tmp/sage/build/pynac-0.5.2/src/ginac/numeric.cpp:621:
 undefined reference to `_imp____gmpq_clear'
```
Full log has been attached.
