Current behaviour:

```
sage: RBF(zeta(3))
[1.202056903159590 +/- 5.38e-16]
sage: RBF(2*zeta(3))
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: unable to convert 2*zeta(3) to a RealBall
```

That is unfortunate (imagine that this is part of a large symbolic expression, involving various constants, logarithms etc.)

I assume that the first call succeeds because `RIF` can handle it.

For each operand in a symbolic expression, we could check whether it is an element of `QQ` and, in that case, just take the `.pyobject` of the operand instead of converting it into the Real Ball Field. Then it would be the responsibility of the respective functions to deal with those elements appropriately (either by the coercion model or by hand).


> x<sup>(2/3)</sup> -> arb_pow_fmpq


in that case, we should also modify `__pow__` which currently does not consider rational exponents.

> 
> exp(I*pi/3) -> arb_sin_cos_pi_fmpq


I am not sure that we want to do that much parsing of a symbolic expression.

> gamma(1/3) -> arb_gamma_fmpq


tricky: we would have to hardwire this function because we'd have to call `RealBallField.gamma`.

I think I'd prefer to postpone such optimizations to a follow-up ticket.

LGTM, and as suggested, everything else should be on a follow up ticket.

BTW, is

```
sage: zeta(RIF(3)).parent()
Complex Field with 53 bits of precision
