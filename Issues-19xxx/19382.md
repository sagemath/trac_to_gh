From sage-devel:

```
It is possible to build a graph with the following syntax:

    Graph(something, format="elliptic_curve_congruence")
```
but it would be more sensible to move the relevant block of 30 lines of code into the elliptic curves module.

Here is a first version anyway -- the old code was very broken, and I have not tested that this displays the correct graph, but at least it works.  Right now I am working from a remote desktop so cannot easily display graphs; when I can, I will test it further.
