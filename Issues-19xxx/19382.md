From sage-devel:

```
It is possible to build a graph with the following syntax:

    Graph(something, format="elliptic_curve_congruence")
```
but it would be more sensible to move the relevant block of 30 lines of code into the elliptic curves module.

Hello John,

The ticket #19381 has been reviewed much faster than I expected, so tell me when you are done with this ticket and I will rebase it on top of it. Should be totally straightforward `:-)`
