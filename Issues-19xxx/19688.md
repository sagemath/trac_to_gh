Using PARI we get a huge speedup for integer of small range. With the branch applied

```
sage: %timeit 100.divisors(method='pari')
1000000 loops, best of 3: 818 ns per loop
sage: %timeit 100.divisors(method='sage')
100000 loops, best of 3: 14.1 Âµs per loop
```

As it is critical for some application, it is also available included as a `cpdef` function named `_pari_divisors_small`.
