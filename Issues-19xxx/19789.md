This trivial but long patch only changes first letter of word "cartesian" to capital letter in documentation and error strings.

This is almost mechanical change,

```
find src/sage -name '*.pxd' -or -name '*.py' -or -name '*.pyx' | xargs perl -p -e 's|(?<![_a-z.])cartesian(?!_[a-z])|Cartesian|g;' -i.bak
```

with one manual correction.
