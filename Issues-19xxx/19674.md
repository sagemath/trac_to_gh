1. Rename all files of the form `ntl_foo_decl.pxd` to `foo.pxd`.

2. Move all declarations from `decl.pxi` to proper `.pxd` files, but keep `decl.pxi` cimporting those declarations.

3. Stop including `decl.pxi` in `.pxd` files.

Depends on #19590

Sorry for not reviewing this as fast as I'd like, but no time for Sage these days.

Do we agree this ticket is mostly moving thing around and not yet trying to use proper C++ cython declarations?
