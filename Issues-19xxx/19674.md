1. Rename all files of the form `ntl_foo_decl.pxd` to `foo.pxd`.

2. Move all declarations from `decl.pxi` to proper `.pxd` files, but keep `decl.pxi` cimporting those declarations.

3. Stop including `decl.pxi` in `.pxd` files.

Depends on #19590

Do we agree this ticket is mostly moving thing around and not yet trying to use proper C++ cython declarations?
