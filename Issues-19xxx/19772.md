Another trivial issue. The `is_lyndon` methods on finite words checks whether the word is empty, and if so, returns `True`. I have spent about a month studying Lyndon words and written a chapter about them, and I have never seen a good reason to treat the empty word as Lyndon; to me, this is highly similar to treating 1 as a prime or the empty space as connected (both being bad ideas). (The analogy between Lyndon words and primes is classical -- e.g., Radford even calls them prime words.) Either way, if the empty word is to be treated as Lyndon, then we should change the docstring of `lyndon_factorization` (it will no longer be unique with the property given), and we should explicitly point out that we disagree with the Lothaire reference.
