# Issue 19772: The empty word should not be Lyndon

Either way, if the empty word is to be treated as Lyndon, then we should change the docstring of `lyndon_factorization` (it will no longer be unique with the property given), and we should explicitly point out that we disagree with the Lothaire reference.
