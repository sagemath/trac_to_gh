FLINT itself uses `LDFLAGS` correctly, but the testsuite does not. Symptom:

```
build/interfaces/test/t-NTL-interface: /usr/lib/powerpc64le-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.21' not found (required by /home/jdemeyer/sage-gcc53/local/lib/libntl.so.19)
Makefile:211: recipe for target 'check' failed
```

Using verbose `make` rules, we see the command line to compile that file:

```
g++ -ansi -pedantic -Wall -O2 -funroll-loops -g   -I/home/jdemeyer/sage-gcc53/local/var/tmp/sage/build/flint-2.5.2/src -I/home/jdemeyer/sage-gcc53/local/include -I/home/jdemeyer/sage-gcc53/local/include -I/home/jdemeyer/sage-gcc53/local/include interfaces/test/t-NTL-interface.cpp build/interfaces/NTL-interface.o -o build/interfaces/test/t-NTL-interface -L/home/jdemeyer/sage-gcc53/local/var/tmp/sage/build/flint-2.5.2/src -L/home/jdemeyer/sage-gcc53/local/lib -L/home/jdemeyer/sage-gcc53/local/lib -L/home/jdemeyer/sage-gcc53/local/lib -lflint -lmpfr -lgmp -lm -lntl -lpthread
```
