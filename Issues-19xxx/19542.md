You have exceptions with multiple sentences in misc/package.py. It is true, however, that the first sentence starts with a lower case and the second sentence does not contain a dot.

Do you mean that you want this standard to be applied even when several sentences occur?

i.e. do you meant that you want full sentences to end with a dot "Except the last" and to begin with an Upper case "except the first"?

I did not change

```
raise ValueError("element_labels should be a dict or a list if "+
                 "different from None. (Did you intend data to be "+
                 "equal to a pair ?)")
```

And as I have said before: Whole developer manual should be seen as a default values. "Do like this, or think (and maybe say out) why you did not."

Personally I would like to see whole sentences always, but it is against Python conventions. Can we say "If exception string is one sentence, start it with lowercase and do not end to comma. In other words, follow Python convention::"

In any case the error reporting is not that good for beginner. Example:

```
P = Posets.PentagonPoset()
p1 = P.chain_polynomial()
p2 = P.characteristic_polynomial()
p3 = P.h_polynomial()
```

says

```
Traceback (click to the left of this block for traceback)
...
TypeError: the poset should be graded
```

and clicking says something strange like `exec compile(u'open("___code___.py","w").write("# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\\n" + _support_.preparse`... It takes a while to see what function failed.

As the text of an exception does not appear in any kind of code I do not think that we should follow any such standard, and that we should strive instead to make our exception as natural as possible to our users. By following the rules of english.

In this thread I see two persons giving an opinion:

- Jeroen says that we should follow Python (he does not say what he thinks should happen with multi-sentences exception)

- Daniel says that we should follow english.

You said here that you prefered English, same for me. That's 3 against one, so here lies the majority.

Volker says that indeed multi sentences is against python convention already, and your branch does nothing about that.

So please do not consider that there is a majority for this change, and if you insist on enforcing it please open a thread devoted to it.

"All sentences except the first start with an upper case, and all sentences except the last end with a point" does not sound exceptionally enticing to me.
