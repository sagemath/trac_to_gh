I can't test this but if you say that it works, I believe you.

Please merge this in the same beta as #18542, otherwise you'll need to bump the version number of the package.

It seems to work on OS X 10.10 (or at least when I build Python, it looks in the indicated place for the openssl headers), but I don't have access to my OS X 10.11 machine today.

Could you try building from scratch? When I rebuild Python everything works, but when I build from scratch, Python fails to build. This is on OS X 10.10:

```
Installing valgrind suppression file...
Testing importing of various modules...
ctypes module imported OK
math module imported OK
hashlib module imported OK
crypt module imported OK
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
ImportError: No module named readline
readline module failed to import
socket module imported OK
Error: One or more modules failed to import.
```
Earlier in the log:

```

Failed to build these modules:
_elementtree       _scproxy           pyexpat         
readline                                              
```
Could it be picking up the readline headers from the new include path?

I think this needs to be reopened, since it doesn't build from scratch successfully on OS X 10.10.
