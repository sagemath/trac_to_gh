It seems to work on OS X 10.10 (or at least when I build Python, it looks in the indicated place for the openssl headers), but I don't have access to my OS X 10.11 machine today.

Could you try building from scratch? When I rebuild Python everything works, but when I build from scratch, Python fails to build. This is on OS X 10.10:

```
Installing valgrind suppression file...

ctypes module imported OK
math module imported OK
hashlib module imported OK
crypt module imported OK
Traceback (most recent call last):

socket module imported OK
Error: One or more modules failed to import.
```
Earlier in the log:

Failed to build these modules:
_elementtree       _scproxy           pyexpat         
readline                                              
```
Could it be picking up the readline headers from the new include path?

I think this needs to be reopened, since it doesn't build from scratch successfully on OS X 10.10.

presently it is building in my office, I'll only know the outcome in about 14 hours from now on.
In the worst case one can copy or link `...wift-migrator/sdk/MacOSX.sdk/usr/include/openssl/` somewhere, so that anything outside `openssl/` from there is not looked up...
