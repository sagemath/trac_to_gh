The (unregistered, yours?) patchbot seems to have problems, but probably not with this branch. I'm in favor of this enhancement as it allows some solutions to other tickets.

See comment 57 of #12967 by vbraun: "The symbolic constants, like pi.pyobject(), should be elements in some parent set. The symbolic constants can then coerce into the infinity ring, solving the pi.pyobject() < oo == False issue."

Consequently this would be good for #19040.

You could review the non-coercion part ;)

Or `no_variables`.

Not necessary IMO.

Hello! I started reviewing this ticket, and for now, I have the following comments:

- `is_variable_valid` --> `has_valid_variable` or `allows_variable`? This would be a semantic improvement as the current version does not really fit to the other `parent.is_*`-methods, IMHO.
- While it is OK that the subring factory checks that every element in the `vars`-tuple can be thrown into `SR` in `SymbolicSubringFactory.create_key_and_extra_args`, the elements are not checked for being valid identifiers. I'd suggest to do so either in the factory, or directly in `GenericSymbolicSubring.__init__`. Otherwise, this is possible:

```
sage: SR.subring(accepting_variables=(0, pi, sqrt(2), I))
Symbolic Subring accepting the variables 0, I, pi, sqrt(2)
```

I also have some minor changes (language etc.) which I will push as soon as I am done with my review.

<div id="comment:18" align="right">comment:18</div>

Thanks, this resolves these two issues.

Besides some minor changes to the code and documentation, I noticed that the `merge` methods for the functors were doing the wrong thing:
- merging two accepting functors should give an accepting functor with the intersection of the variables,
- merging two rejecting functors should give a rejecting functor with the union of the variables,
- when merging a rejecting and an accepting functor, the result has to to be an accepting functor with all accepted variables, but without the rejected ones.

I adapted the code accordingly.

In principle, this would be a `positive_review` from my side, however, I'd like to rewrite your code some more such that subrings of subrings can be constructed as well. The easiest way to do so (probably), is to let the functors do everything.

The question is whether to postpone the rewriting to a follow-up ticket (i.e., does your planned rewriting affect the interface or is it just internal rewriting which will then allow new things to be done?) This also in view of several tickets depending on this ticket here.

No, `merge` is correct. Composition means creating a larger subring, which contains both the corresonding rings (it is used in pushout).
So please `git revert`

Done. I thought of composition instead of something that is used in the construction of the pushout, sorry.

My approach requires an implemented compoisiton of functors; I'll take care of that in a follow-up ticket.

As you have reviewed my changes, I'll set this to `positive_review` after building and checking the documentation again.
