Currently, `is_complete` and `completion` is only `True` if the finite state machine is almost deterministic (disjoint unions of deterministic machines are allowed). This shall be corrected.

This also requires fixing of `complement` which silently assumes that `is_complete` guarantees that the machine is deterministic.
