<a id='comment:6'></a>Would it be possible to just not do this? It's a strong indication of bad design if you end up parsing strings wrt. locals/globals dictionaries. Variable names do not belong in strings.

You'll probably get scoping/shadowing in the different dictionaries wrong. E.g. what about

```
[GrowthGroup("n^Z") for Z in [1..10]]
```
and, subtly different,

```
list(GrowthGroup("n^Z") for Z in [1..10])
```
And what would

```
[GrowthGroup("n^Z") for n in [1..10] for Z in [1..10]]
```
do? I know: it probably gives errors because it's not passing the right values here, but what is different about n wrt. Z that one name needs to be looked up in a scope and the other doesn't?

If you need a construction like this, then something along the lines

```
PreGrowthGroup("n")^Z
```
is probably much safer.

You might want to check on sage-devel what the opinions of other developers are about letting local/global variable names sneak into strings.
