As the title says. This is associated with the following sage-devel thread:

https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-devel/S1k8HzZUBIs/discussion

This ticket is in conflict with #17569, but that ticket is in `needs_work`, and it is apparently a bit hard to merge/rebase two branches when one touches a file that the other renames.

Whichever of the two gets a positive review first, I will handle the merge with the other.

I don't agree with this change, for two reasons.

First, I intend to implement finite rings that are not finite fields, which will be used as quotients of p-adic extension fields.  If the change proposed in this ticket is made then we will need to either create another file for the constructors of such rings, or to suffer a situation analogous to that derided in the thread, where complex lazy fields are defined in a file real_lazy.py.

Second, I don't see any benefit to making this change.  Finite fields are examples of finite rings; what's wrong with the current name?

I have less and less patience for people playing dumb.

Would a file named 'object.pyx' still get no reaction from you? Finite Rings are objects too. It is much too general and thus becomes misleading: that's what is wrong.

Look at the filename: it tells that you can expect the file contains *the* constructor of finite rings (there is not even a plural to `constructor`). Do you see `FiniteRing` inside? No. `IntegerModRing` (also a ring) is not even inside, it sits in its own file, and neither are other finite rings. Inside of that file, what you expect to see is a class named `FiniteRing`, and absolutely nothing else. Why would you object to having the constructor of finite fields in a file that bears its name? Do you also object to having `IntegerModRing` in `integer_mod_ring.py`? If not, by which sorcery?

Inside of `rings/finite_rings/` you have 5 files in `finite_field_*`. How odd would it be for the file containing their main constructor to have the same prefix?

> First, I intend to implement finite rings that are not finite fields,


And you will be welcome to create a new file for them when you will get to work.

Arggggg... Right!

Actually, I just figured out why the file did not seem to be included in the reference manual already: there is an independent 'finite_rings' folder in the manual, which for some reason is not a subfolder of the 'rings' folder.

    http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/rings/
    http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/finite_rings/

Anyway. That's fixed, and the doc compiles.

David, FYI, Nathann just as well has been contributing to Sage quite a bit.

David, let me assure you that Nathann certainly perfectly aware of what a finite field is. He has been using them quite a bit...

> and thus you are reduced to making aggressive, mocking comments about its name, which is invisible to most Sage users anyway. You may as well write to the authors of a paper in a top journal telling them that you don't like the title they've given their paper.

There is quite a bit of crap in top journals, as we all know, often due to reviewers...
Thanks goodness, here we can correct things overlooked by Sage reviewers. This is often thankless job, but it makes code much more readable. And this is very important.


> Don't you have anything better to do with your time?

Improving Sage codebase is very important, and we should be thankful to Nathann for this.
