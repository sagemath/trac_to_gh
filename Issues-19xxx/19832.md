Currently (2016-01), trac.sagemath.org sends notifications even after a user
removes himself from the CC list. This is irritating to the user and seems like
a local misconfiguration of the notification subsystem
(see http://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/TracNotification).

The configuration should be fixed, so that only people actually in CC
(or other such fields) are notified.

As a current stopgap measure, I propose that users are not added to new tickets,
but are alerted of a new ticket that may interest them through other means, e.g.,
by adding a link to the new ticket in a new comment of a related ticket in which
the user is listed in CC.

Relevant upstream ticket: [http://trac.edgewall.org/ticket/9971](http://trac.edgewall.org/ticket/9971).
The solution suggested in 
[comment 14 there](https://trac.edgewall.org/ticket/9971#comment:14)
does not seem to apply to Sage's trac,
as no Notification preferences are present in the Preferences.

Upstream: **None of the above - read trac for reasoning.**

Thanks, surfing through to the mentioned cases for Django and Trac itself, the final solution was in both cases to turn off always_notify_updater. I suggest that as a fix for Sage as well.

To make sure contributors know about this, a general mail should be sent out and people should be added to the (then functional) Cc list for the tickets they now get mail for and are put on Cc whenever 'touching' a ticket, so that doing nothing doesn't change the system's behavior.

That's not a solution to the problem, since you cannot unsubscribe from arbitrary tickets (unless you limit your "global" notifications to *"Notify: Ticket that I'm listed in the CC field is modified"*, and manually add yourself to the cc-list of **all** those tickets you want to receive notifications for in the future, never forgetting to do so when you just comment on a ticket, and not missing any ticket you previously participated in, and relying on not anybody ever messing up these lists).

How hard would it be to implement? Basically, 3 things (I certainly do not know anything about trac source, so perhaps this is fundamentally wrong picture) : 

* a button/toggle to cc/un-cc yourself on a ticket
* a persistent list of unsubscribers (people who un-cc themselves), attached to the ticket
* a filter in the notification email dispatcher that checks the recipients
  against the latter list

(this can be filed under ODK WP7 :-))

Yes, please.  (Which bug tracker does *not* have this feature?)

And this may in addition make manually editing the CC field obsolete, if there are both "cc me" and "cc someone else" buttons.

no, I don't think so. Besides, this is error-prone and wasteful way to deal with this.
If you delete a thread it would delete ignoring flag too; if ticket subject gets changed it would trickle through again. Etc..

<div id="comment:20" align="right">comment:20</div>

The [/prefs/notification notification preferences here] show the following among the default rules:
> * Notify: Ticket that I previously updated is modified
> * Notify: Ticket that I'm listed in the CC field is modified

How can I now just switch off the first rule, leaving the second one fully working?

The page also says:
> Configure subscription rules to override them.
> Example: The subscription rule "Notify: Any ticket changes" overrides the default rule "Never notify: I update a ticket".

This sounds as if adding the rule "Never notify: Ticket that I previously updated is modified" would also override the rule "Notify: Ticket that I'm listed in the CC field is modified". This is not want I want.

(By the way, having "Notify: Ticket that I previously updated is modified" as default rule breaks the operation of un-CCing oneself from a ticket.)
