```
The two remaining occurrences of the old-style `has_coerce_map_from_[c_]impl` should be replaced by `_coerce_map_from_()`.

In addition, `Singular._coerce_map_from_()` now returns `None` if no coercion map is known (instead of returning `False` or raising a `NotImplementedError`).

We remove some left-overs of the old coercion model in `homset.py` (which uses the new coercion model now).

We also remove completely the methods `_coerce_self_c`, `_coerce_self`, `has_coerce_map_from_impl`, `coerce_map_from_impl`.

The methods there are part of the interface of `parent_old.Parent`.  They are needed to support the old coercion model; we will probably need to keep them at least until all classes deriving from `parent_old.Parent` (of which there are still quite a few, namely everything inheriting from `ParentWithBase` or `Cryptosystem`) have finished moving to the new coercion model.  Even then, I think we should first deprecate `parent_old.Parent` as a whole before we can remove them.

I just tried brutally removing the above methods from `parent_old.Parent`, and this caused Sage to crash while starting up...

`PariInstance` does derive from `parent_old.Parent` via `ParentWithBase`, so why move away from `has_coerce_map_from_c_impl` if that's what is used by `parent_old`?

I don't think it's that hard to just drop support for `has_coerce_map_from_c_impl` completely, but I don't have time to look at it now.
