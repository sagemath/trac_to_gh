The code here looks ok to me, it is mostly house keeping.

The only mention left of `SAGE_DOC` in the current form is in `sage/misc/sagedoc.py`, possibly too hard for this ticket but if it is only for building at least some parts of `sagedoc.py` could/should be moved to `sage_setup/docbuild`.

Doesn't autodoc import the modules that it builds the documentation of, to determine `__doc__`? If so, there is no way to build the Sage documentation without building Sage first.

Old docs are deleted, see `src/sage_setup/docbuild/__main__.py`:

```
    if os.path.exists(old_doc):
        from shutil import rmtree
        rmtree(old_doc)
```
