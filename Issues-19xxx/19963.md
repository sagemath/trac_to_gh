Everything which is compiled/built/installed in the Sage distribution ends up in `$SAGE_LOCAL`... except the documentation. So it's logical to put the built documentation in `$SAGE_LOCAL` too.

> At the very least it would be something where "deprecation" would be useful?

Well, you cannot really deprecate filesystem paths. But a symbolic link can be done indeed.

Doesn't autodoc import the modules that it builds the documentation of, to determine `__doc__`? If so, there is no way to build the Sage documentation without building Sage first.
