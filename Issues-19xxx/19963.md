I am unfortunately taking this train after it left the station. I guess the code re-organisation had to happen in #19127 and all. But what a choice of variable names. Seriously `SAGE_DOC_OUTPUT`? Yes I can see where it came from. But seriously I expect my doc to be found under `SAGE_DOC` not `SAGE_DOC_OUTPUT`, that's the natural name to use. The other one could have been `SAGE_DOC_SRC`, and if it isn't used after install I am not sure I would bother putting it in `env.py`.

Doesn't autodoc import the modules that it builds the documentation of, to determine `__doc__`? If so, there is no way to build the Sage documentation without building Sage first.

Old docs are deleted, see `src/sage_setup/docbuild/__main__.py`:

```
    if os.path.exists(old_doc):
        from shutil import rmtree
        rmtree(old_doc)
```
