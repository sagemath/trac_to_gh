Wouldn't it be possible to keep a compatibility symlink or something? Also, several places in the documentation (starting with `README.txt`) explicitly refer the reader to `src/doc/output`.

The code here looks ok to me, it is mostly house keeping.

Doesn't autodoc import the modules that it builds the documentation of, to determine `__doc__`? If so, there is no way to build the Sage documentation without building Sage first.

Old docs are deleted, see `src/sage_setup/docbuild/__main__.py`:

```
    if os.path.exists(old_doc):
        from shutil import rmtree
        rmtree(old_doc)
```
