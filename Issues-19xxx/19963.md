Everything which is compiled/built/installed in the Sage distribution ends up in `$SAGE_LOCAL`... except the documentation. So it's logical to put the built documentation in `$SAGE_LOCAL` too.

Well, you cannot really deprecate filesystem paths. But a symbolic link can be done indeed.

The code here looks ok to me, it is mostly house keeping.

The html and the pdf documentations are moved to a new home and only the `rst` file are left behind. The only mention left of `SAGE_DOC` in the current form is in `sage/misc/sagedoc.py`, possibly too hard for this ticket but if it is only for building at least some parts of `sagedoc.py` could/should be moved to `sage_setup/docbuild`.

At least two of these should be replaced by `SAGE_DOC_OUTPUT`, the first instance is to quote a path in sage's source tree.

And yes it was possible, may still be possible with a bit of care. What happens technically is that the docbuilding itself only needs to go through sage's sources, and if you don't call anything from cythonized modules during the building process itself, you don't need anything but the sources.

Doesn't autodoc import the modules that it builds the documentation of, to determine `__doc__`? If so, there is no way to build the Sage documentation without building Sage first.
