Perhaps instead of "if needed, fix paths to make Sage relocatable" we describe `sage-location` as "if needed, fix paths as the result of a Sage relocation" or something similar? As it is currently worded, it makes it seem like once `sage-location` is run, one can relocate Sage. My understanding is that `sage-location` should be run after a relocation.

Well, the "this should be run before you relocate Sage" isn't really needed, since `sage-location` is run automatically when running Sage. So normally, ordinary users never need to run `sage --location` manually, not even when relocating Sage.

That leaves us with "if needed, fix paths in Sage" which is obscure since it doesn't refer to relocation anymore.

So I still think that the text in the current branch is the best formulation.
