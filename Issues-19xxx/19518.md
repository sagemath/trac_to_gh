The __init__ method of GroupAlgebra did not check for commutativity of the group so that this would happen:

```
sage: G = AbelianGroup(2)
sage: A = GroupAlgebra(G)
sage: A.is_commutative()
True
sage: A.is_ring()
True
sage: PolynomialRing(A,'x,y')

TypeError: The base ring Group algebra of group "Multiplicative Abelian group isomorphic to Z x Z " over base ring Integer Ring is not a commutative ring
```

Moreover the init function of PolynomialRing needs the method is_prime_field in
order to work.

This has uncovered a couple of different bugs:

1. We have an issue with translating to/from GAP:

```
sage: SU(2, 3).random_element()
[      1 2*a + 2]
[      0       1]
sage: SU(2, 4).random_element()
<repr(<sage.groups.matrix_gps.group_element.UnitaryMatrixGroup_gap_with_category.element_class at 0x7f826b84eaa0>) failed: ValueError: the given finite field has incompatible size>
```
2. Abelian groups `.algebra` aren't returning group algebras.
3. `Commutative()` does not commute with the `Algebras` functor construction.

```
sage: Groups().Commutative().Algebras(QQ)
Join of Category of group algebras over Rational Field and Category of commutative algebras over Rational Field and Category of commutative magma algebras over Rational Field
sage: Groups().Algebras(QQ).Commutative()
Category of commutative group algebras over Rational Field
```
The main problem for this ticket I think is the last one.
