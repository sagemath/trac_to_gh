Maxima's assumption framework (still used by Sage's `GenericDeclaration`) has only rudimentary consistency and no redundancy checking.

```
sage: assume(x>0)
sage: assume(x,'real')
sage: assume(x,'imaginary')
sage: assume(x,'complex')
sage: assumptions()
[x > 0, x is real, x is imaginary, x is complex]
```
This ticket should wrestle the `GenericDeclaration` consistency checking (not the same with relations!) from Maxima, implementing it directly in Python, only informing Maxima about any such assumption. And by the way add the `positive` and `negative` keywords.
