```
G = Graph({1:[2]})
list(G.depth_first_search('junk', distance=0))
```

outputs `['junk']`, but it should raise an exception. With `distance=1` it works. Same happens with `breadth_first_search()`.

Also `distance` is not checked and `G.depth_first_search(1, distance='junk')` works like `distance=None`.

<a id='comment:3'></a>Hello Jori,

What you did is not exactly wrong, but we should really find something better than adding 30 lines of code to deal with a rather stupid corner-case. Though I admit that I do not see one at the moment.

Technically (though that is not the biggest problem here) try to only wrap the smallest amount of line in a try/except. When you write too much in a try/except, you run the risk of catching exceptions raised legitimately by other functions.

For every case, also to those with `distance != 0`? Sounds kind of dangerous.

> we should really find something better than adding 30 lines of code to deal with a rather stupid corner-case


Simple. We should have global internal functions for this. Like `_check_integer_all()`, `_check_integer_nonnegative()` and `_check_integer_positive()`. Then also error messages would be consistent.

A topic for sage-devel?
