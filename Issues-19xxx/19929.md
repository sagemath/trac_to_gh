This branch is related to the following sage-devel conversation:

    https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-devel/MeuOjHf3vCw/discussion

The default name picked here is 'a'. Indeed, the default name 'conway' proposed on the conversation did not seem adapted, as the default behaviour of the constructor is 'conway=False'. I frankly admit that I do not understand what is the expected behaviour of 'conway=False', but I thought that setting a default name of 'conway' when a field is created with 'conway=False' sounded like a bad idea.

I did not change the default value of 'name' in the function's definition for it would disable an apparently desired behaviour of 'prefix' (when 'name' is undefined). I don't understand why we need all of 'name/names/prefix' in the same function, but I learnt in the past that asking questions like that only brought me pain and suffering.

If you see how to implement what is described at #17569 by something like next week and have it in needs_review by then, I don't have *any* objection. I just want it to work.

If you want me to close a ticket that implements a ready solution to a problem in exchange for a 13 months old ticket that still does not contain any code, then of course I object.

To me, a ticket without code just does not exist. It is a thought in somebody's head, and this somebody often has forgotten it. I don't close tickets because of that.

Some points:

- Background: `conway=True` would be absurd, because computing the conway polynomial representation of a finite field is *incredibly* hard in general.  

- Using 'a' (or 'x') everywhere as the default is not so good; I did exactly that with number fields back in 2004-2006 and it caused confusion and people hated it.  You easily end up with several different things that all print the same way (magma has this problem now, where everything prints as $.1; but in Magma, you can change the name after creation, as they have no coercion model or reason for not allowing changing the names).   I would recommend using something like `"a%s"%(p^n)` or `"a_%s_%s"%(p,n)` or `"a%s_%s"%(p,n)`, which is an easy to understand function of `p^n`.   I think what Fpbar basically use "z%s"%n, where you specify z explicitly.

Yes, that's why we use pseudo-Conway polynomials, which drop the condition of lexicographically least.  They're still nontrivial to compute, especially when the exponent has lots of divisors.  But, as Dima mentions, at least we have lookup tables for small values.

> - Using 'a' (or 'x') everywhere as the default is not so good; I did exactly that with number fields back in 2004-2006 and it caused confusion and people hated it.  You easily end up with several different things that all print the same way (magma has this problem now, where everything prints as $.1; but in Magma, you can change the name after creation, as they have no coercion model or reason for not allowing changing the names).   I would recommend using something like `"a%s"%(p^n)` or `"a_%s_%s"%(p,n)` or `"a%s_%s"%(p,n)`, which is an easy to understand function of `p^n`.   I think what Fpbar basically use "z%s"%n, where you specify z explicitly.


I don't have a strong preference between `"z%s"%n` and `"a%s_%s"%(p,n)`, but I agree that `'a'` and `'x'` are not right as defaults.

> - I am **strongly** against #17569 without some new idea.

Was the difference in field creation time or in arithmetic time?  Because the resulting fields of these two processes should be essentially the same (with different defining polynomial perhaps).

Another possibility would be to only allow `GF(p^n)` when we have an actual Conway polynomial at hand.  This is a bit annoying though: someone may write code that works for small field sizes and then breaks when the field size increases.  Print a warning??

OK, I see.  For Fpbar do you always use pseudo-Conway polynomials?

In the first benchmark I tried, arithmetic in Fpbar was **10 times** slower than in GF (that was going to be the punchline of the sage worksheet I linked to).  Do you  really want `GF(3^2, 'a')` to be 30 times faster than `GF(3^2)`?  I didn't think so.  Even in David Roe's less unfavorable example, there was a factor of 2-3 difference.

I was testing arithmetic.  However, I definitely made a mistake, because I just tried again, and the timing for arithmetic is *identical*, just as you say (which is very cool).

   https://cloud.sagemath.com/projects/4a5f0542-5873-4eed-a85c-a18c706e8bcd/files/support/2016-01-21-114547-GF-speed.sagews

Thus I reverse my position: instead, I'm personally fine with #17569, with the caveat that I'm a little nervous about the pseudo-Conway polynomials....

Did anybody write up how Fpbar works somewhere? (I'm teaching computational number theory and it would be fun to talk about this.)

For anybody who finds this via a google search, here's what David said, which is very relevant for understanding the tradeoffs in this very ticket and why one should expect constructing `GF(p^n)` via what is at #175569 to be potentially significantly slower than just `GF(p^n,'a')`: " don't think any of us wrote up pseudo-Conway polynomials in particular, since most of the actual algorithms are simple modifications of the ones for Conway polynomials.  For details, see
sage/rings/finite_rings/conway_polynomials.py
especially the docstrings for PseudoConwayLattice, PseudoConwayLattice.polynomial.  _frobenius_shift is also needed, but a bit fiddly."

First this -- for me it takes over 20 times longer to make the algebraic closure version:

```
    p = next_prime(10^12)
    %time GF(p^6, 'a')
    %time GF(p).algebraic_closure().subfield(6)
```

Increasing 6 quickly makes it take an arbitrarily large factor longer.   This is precisely the sort of thing that will seriously piss off some cryptographers someday.  And they will yell at me personally.

Next this -- it takes infinitely longer to make the algebraic closure version (due to a bug):

```
    p = next_prime(10^12)
    %time GF(p^6, 'a')
    %time GF(p).algebraic_closure().subfield(6)
```

I'm using sage-6.9.

For anybody curious about the benchmark issues I mentioned, I was benchmarking arithmetic, say "a + b", where a and b are generators of GF(9) and GF(27), respectively, using timeit.   Using Fpbar this takes about 30 times as long as doing exactly the same computation after defining explicit field homomorphisms  between non-Fpbar finite fields.  So probably Fpbar doesn't cache some sort of basic information about embeddings.    This is another motivation to support K.embeddings(G) for any fields K and G, since though it's not quite as simple, in practice it can be much faster.

I've tried to make it clear in the documentation for GF that this will happen.  I'm sure that there are ways to speed up the `PseudoConwayLattice` code, since nobody has spent time optimizing it, but it will always be slower than just searching for an arbitrary irreducible polynomial.  That ability is still available, as long as you just specify a variable name.
