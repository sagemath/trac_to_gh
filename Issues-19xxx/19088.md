The following fails

```
        sage: A.<n> = AsymptoticRing(growth_group='QQ^x * x^QQ * log(n)^QQ',
        ....:                         coefficient_ring=QQ); A
```
(used with the code of #17601, but is nothing specific about this code).

One gets:

```
    A.<n> = AsymptoticRing(growth_group='QQ^x * x^QQ * log(n)^QQ',
                           coefficient_ring=QQ); A
Exception raised:
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
        A = AsymptoticRing(growth_group='QQ^x * x^QQ * log(n)^QQ',; (n,) = A._first_ngens(1)
                                                                  ^

Perhaps a simpler example: compare

```
sage: preparse("""A.<a,b,c>=PolynomialRing(QQ)""")
"A = PolynomialRing(QQ, names=('a', 'b', 'c',)); (a, b, c,) = A._first_ngens(3)"
sage: preparse("""A.<a,b,c>=PolynomialRing(QQ\n)""")
'A = PolynomialRing(QQ; (a, b, c,) = A._first_ngens(3)\n)'
sage: preparse("A.<x>=QQ[]")
"A = QQ['x']; (x,) = A._first_ngens(1)"
sage: preparse("A.<x>=QQ[\n]")
'A = QQ[; (x,) = A._first_ngens(1)\n]'
```
As you can see, the newline completely throws off the substitution:
- no "names" attribute is inserted
- the binding of generators to given identifiers is inserted in the wrong spot (at the end of the first line instead of at the end of the command)

This is a tricky one: Usually in python, a newline terminates a command, so the place of insertion would usually be safe. However, if there is an unbalanced bracket, then the newline is just a whitespace. This is a condition that cannot be detected with a regex in general.

This similar Sage extension of the Python syntax
to define symbolic functions also fails:

```
sage: T(r, t) = [r^2,
