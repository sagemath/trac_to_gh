Sorry this bug report is a bit ad hoc, but I suspect the thing that makes this buggy is part of a larger problem in the quadratic forms module.  I'm running Sage 6.9 and I get the following in error if I construct the quadratic form 

```
M=QuadraticForm(ZZ,3,[75,120,120,144,0,144])
```
then 

```
sage: M.is_locally_represented_number_at_place(99,3)
False
```
and 

```
sage: M.representation_number_list(100)[99]==0
False
```
But of course if I represent 99 over the integers, then I have to represent it locally.  In this case the second output it correct, and the first one is incorrect.  I think there is some underlying problem with the way global quadratic forms are defined.
