Would it increase the compile time by a fraction a second? Yes.

Is that an issue? No.

First of all, it's still not an issue. Compiling all `.py` files to `.pyc` files really does not take much time.

Second, even if it would be a problem, what's your solution? Python needs those `__init__.py` files and Sage uses `all.py` to easily import stuff in the global namespace.
