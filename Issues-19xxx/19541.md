Hecke insertion is a variant of RSK which has interesting applications in

- K-theoretic Schubert calculus,
- representation theory of the 0-Hecke monoid, and
- probability theory of the Plancherel-Hecke measure.

The comment

```
# We must have len(p[j-1]) > len(r), otherwise we would

```
comes from if `len(p[j-1]) == len(r)` (recall `r = p[j]`) and we wanted to add the entry `x` to the end of `r`, then by the strictly increasing condition, we should have added `x` to the end of `p[j-1]`. It means that we can skip the check that `len(p[j-1]) > len(r)`.

Ah, I got it! I think my way of saying it is clearer, though.

In other news, am I seeing it right that `reversed(d.items())` and `reversed(row_dict.values())` are fragile? I'll replace them by safer things.

Thanks for the prompt fix suggestion. The code now LGTM. I have added some weasel language (in one of my previous commits) to avoid creating the impression that the Hecke RSK algorithm is understood in the "semistandard" case (i.e., upper row is not (1, 2, ..., n)). If you have a source for this, please put it in a reference.
