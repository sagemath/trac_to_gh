Ah, I got it! I think my way of saying it is clearer, though.

In other news, am I seeing it right that `reversed(d.items())` and `reversed(row_dict.values())` are fragile? I'll replace them by safer things.

<a id='comment:8'>**Comment 8:**</a>
Thanks for the prompt fix suggestion. The code now LGTM. I have added some weasel language (in one of my previous commits) to avoid creating the impression that the Hecke RSK algorithm is understood in the "semistandard" case (i.e., upper row is not (1, 2, ..., n)). If you have a source for this, please put it in a reference.
