Hecke insertion is a variant of RSK which has interesting applications in

- K-theoretic Schubert calculus,
- representation theory of the 0-Hecke monoid, and
- probability theory of the Plancherel-Hecke measure.

The comment

```

#   have added x to the previous row
```
comes from if `len(p[j-1]) == len(r)` (recall `r = p[j]`) and we wanted to add the entry `x` to the end of `r`, then by the strictly increasing condition, we should have added `x` to the end of `p[j-1]`. It means that we can skip the check that `len(p[j-1]) > len(r)`.
