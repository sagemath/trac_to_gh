When running Sage doctests for the very first time (with an empty `DOT_SAGE` directory):

```
sage -t --long src/sage/geometry/fan.py
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/geometry/fan.py", line 2887, in sage.geometry.fan.?.plot

```

Of course, the failures go away when the tests are rerun. Any way we can avoid these failures?

That's not really possible because the relevant matplotlib files are *user* files (inside `$DOT_SAGE`, which is typically in `$HOME`), not *system* files.

I think I see what you're saying--I'm so used at this point to running my own copy of sage that it's warped my viewpoint in ugly ways :)

But isn't there some initial creation of user files in `$DOT_SAGE` the first time a user runs Sage?  That's what I meant.
