This ticket adds a method `is_partial_cube` to the `Graph` class, which checks whether a graph is a partial cube. A partial cube is a graph that can be isometrically embedded into a hypercube, i.e., its vertices can be labelled with (0,1)-vectors of some fixed length such that the distance between any two vertices in the graph equals the Hamming distance of their labels. If requested, this labelling can also be returned by the method.

The code for this method comes from the PADS library by David Eppstein, which is available at http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/PADS/. The library is available under the MIT license, and I have also obtained permission from the author via email. The algorithm in question has been described in a paper available at http://arxiv.org/pdf/0705.1025.pdf.

The code has been changed to utilize Sage's structures (namely graphs, digraphs and disjoint sets). However, specialized breadth-first and depth-first search methods for graphs from the PADS library have also been added.

Before this goes into review, here are some notes and questions:

* Currently, there are no docstrings for the new methods - of course I will add them, but the current commit was intended just for testing whether the method works as expected.
* Should I mention in the doc that the code has originally been made available under the MIT license?
* The new BFS method is named `breadth_first_level_search`. It generates dictionaries whose keys are vertices at each level of the search, and values are sets of neighbours on the next level for each key vertex. This way, a vertex may appear in multiple sets on the same level - this is needed to correctly produce the labellings.
* The new DFS method is named `depth_first_traversal`. It generates the edges followed on both ways of the depth-first search, together with the information on the direction taken (`True` for forward, `False` for backward). The method is used in the final verification step of the algorithm. Although the existing DFS could be adapted to work this way if requested, I chose to keep this a separate method to avoid needlessly degrading the performance of algorithms utilizing the generic DFS.
* If a `certificate` is requested, the method raises an `EmptySetError` describing what went wrong in case the graph is not a partial cube, and returns a dictionary mapping vertices to (0,1)-strings otherwise. Is this OK, or should I change to returning pairs, as with other methods returning a certificate? Should I use some exception other than `EmptySetError`? I chose this as it is also used in `traveling_salesman_problem`.

Hello,

> * Should I mention in the doc that the code has originally been made available under the MIT license?

I do not think that you *must* mention the original license. You can say somewhere that this implementation is an adaptation of his code, however. Though you can ask on sage-devel if you prefer.

> * The new BFS method is named `breadth_first_level_search`. It generates dictionaries whose keys are vertices at each level of the search, and values are sets of neighbours on the next level for each key vertex. This way, a vertex may appear in multiple sets on the same level - this is needed to correctly produce the labellings.

This method is very specific to you use, and cannot be a public function of GenericGraph with a name like that. You can turn it into a private function if you prefer.

I have not looked at the code inside, but depending on your performance needs, you could prefer an implementation that does not require you to rewrite the BFS. Something like that:

```
sage: bfs = list(g.breadth_first_search(0,report_distance=True))
sage: layers = [set() for _ in range(bfs[-1][1]+2)]
sage: for x,d in bfs:
....:     layers[d].add(x)
sage: next_level_neighbors = {v:layers[d+1].intersection(g.neighbors(v)) for d,L in enumerate(layers) for v in L}
```

> * The new DFS method is named `depth_first_traversal`. It generates the edges followed on both ways of the depth-first search, together with the information on the direction taken (`True` for forward, `False` for backward). The method is used in the final verification step of the algorithm. Although the existing DFS could be adapted to work this way if requested, I chose to keep this a separate method to avoid needlessly degrading the performance of algorithms utilizing the generic DFS.

Same remark here for the name. We can't have `.depth_first_search` and `.depth_first_traversal` simultaneously, and doing different things.

> * If a `certificate` is requested, the method raises an `EmptySetError` describing what went wrong in case the graph is not a partial cube, and returns a dictionary mapping vertices to (0,1)-strings otherwise.

`EmptySetError`? Isn't the certificate usually set to `None` or to the empty dictionary when it goes wrong? Your code at #19586 raises no exception.

> Is this OK, or should I change to returning pairs, as with other methods returning a certificate?

You don't have to return a list of pairs, a certificate can be whatever you like.

> Should I use some exception other than `EmptySetError`? I chose this as it is also used in `traveling_salesman_problem`.

Oh. Well, this `EmptySetError` is a recent trend to mean that "a search occured, and found nothing". Which 'can' make sense for a hamiltonian cycle. Here, an `EmptySetError` would make me thing that the algorithm is doing something enumerative like trying all labellings.

About the implementation: this code looks long, and perhaps tricky: if you prefer you can also move it to an independent file (like it's done for 'graphs/graph_decompositions/graph_products.pyx'). The other advantage of that is that it give you more room to write doc, if you need it.

Hi!

Thanks for the suggestions and comments, I will address them when I have time (not today). As I said, the current code closely follows the original (including exceptions) and was mainly meant for testing, so I'm willing to change it to a more acceptable form.

> About the implementation: this code looks long, and perhaps tricky: if you prefer you can also move it to an independent file (like it's done for 'graphs/graph_decompositions/graph_products.pyx'). The other advantage of that is that it give you more room to write doc, if you need it.

I agree that this will probably be the best solution - then the file can also contain the search functions. Are there any additional steps needed when adding a new file?

Hi!

I've moved the functions to a new file and added the documentation. However, the last test in the docstring of `is_partial_cube` is not formatted properly in `graph.html` when I compile the documentation (but it looks fine in `partial_cube.html`). Any idea why?

Hi!

Replying to [@jm58660](#comment%3A12):
> Propably a stupid question, as I know very little graph theory, but: Isn't the definition "isometrically embedded into a hypercube" defined also for non-connected graphs? I.e. it equals to definition by Hamming distance only when the graph is connected.

It is, but clearly no disconnected graph G can be isometrically embeded into a connected graph H, as two vertices in distinct connected components of G will not be connected by any shortest path in H.

> And a kind of bikeshedding: A user writing `G.is_partial_cube?` will get help that does not define partial cube but says what is the complexity and who invented algorithm.

Yes, I should change that.

By the way, should I be worried about the failing plugin on the buildbot? The log is not very helpful in telling me what exactly went wrong.

Hi!

> Fails on empty graph:

Whoops, fixed. Thanks for pointing it out!

> (Empty set, zero, graph without any edge etc. are corner cases that are almost always good to check.)

Edgeless graphs work - a graph with a single vertex is already a hypercube, while larger empty graphs are disconnected and therefore are not partial cubes.

I have no more comments.

I did some tests, like testing that cartesian products of partial cubes are partial cubes, and found no errors.

I read the code. It seems complicated due to nature of algorithm using bitwise operators. However, it has good comments inside.

I am unsure if I can not put this to positive review. Nathann, how rigorously should a reviewer read the code?

There is no rule about that, as you can expect. The same way that paper reviewers sometimes do a serious job and sometimes only browse through the text. Both are called 'reviews'. Some tickets are also `positively reviewed` mostly because the reviewer and authors are good friends, and don't want to bother with details.

Here the 'form' of the code seems good (doc formatting, new module, imports, index of functions), and from what I read of Janoš' code I'm the one who needs to double-check when I am about to make a comment.

I would not give this ticket a positive review before I understand the algorithm and its implementation, however. And perhaps outline what it does in the module's doc while I am at it. If you give this patch a positive review, however, that's fine by me and there is nothing I can/will do against it. Everybody has his own way of reviewing things.

We have very strict rules about where double columns should be put, and a ticket is easily set to `needs_work` because of that. But there is no way to check how honestly a reviewer inspects the mathematical code, so there we have to trust each other.

Hello,

Here is a first-pass review.

- Has a simpler expression:

  ```
  -    CG = DiGraph({v: {w: (v, w) for w in G[v]} for v in G})
  +    CG = DiGraph(G)
  ```

- That's a full graph copy, right? `O_o`

  ```
  +        if not Graph(CG).is_bipartite():
  ```

  Wouldn't it be better to maintain the undirected graph too? At this level, I
  would almost be tempted by `GenericGraph.is_bipartite(CG)` `O_o`

- `CG/UF/NL` I saw that they were the names from the original source code, but
  would you mind 'expanding' them?

- Don't know if that interests you, but by relabelling the graph on `0,...,n`
  you could use lists instead of dictionaries, e.g. for `bitvec`.

- Computing the number of connected components is not necessary to initialize
  the graphs, and has a linear-time cost.

  ```
  -        NG = DiGraph(labeled.connected_components_number())
  +        NG = DiGraph()
  ```

- What about `NG.has_edge(vi,wi)`?

  ```
  +                if wi in NG.neighbors_out(vi):
  ```

- As you do not seem to do anything with the dictionaries stored in `action`,
  could you turn them into sets instead?

  ```
  -    action = {v: {} for v in g}
  +    action = {v: set() for v in g}
  ```

- What is the purpose of all the code that appears after this line?

  ```
  +    g = DiGraph({v: {w: UF.find((v, w)) for w in G[v]} for v in G})
  ```
  It does not appear in `partial_cube.py` but in `medium.py`, and I do not see
  what you need it for.

I *think* it may be actually enough to check that the original graph is bipartite, and then also all contractions must be bipartite. I will ask the author, just to be sure.

OK, they are now `contracted`, `unionfind` and `available` now, and `LG` and `NG` have been changed to `level` and `newgraph`, respectively.

I could, but since we might be building a dictionary as a certificate anyway, I don't think there's much gain here.

The original algorithm used the values in the dictionaries to reconstruct the graph. Indeed, here we don't use them, so I changed the dictionaries to sets.

In the case the graph is not a partial cube, the first part of the algorithm may still produce a labelling, which then needs to be checked (see for example Lemma 11 in the paper). An example would be a graph with graph6 string `Fs_Wo` - this fails the check that no two edges on the same vertex should have the same label.

In order to check that it is isometric, I believe that it is sufficient to run the following code.\n\n```python\ndef check_labelling(G):\n    # Assumptions:\n    #\n    # - We assume that the vertices are integers, whose base-2 representation\n    #   represents the coordinates\n    #\n    # - We also assume that every edge corresponds to the switching of one bit\n    #   in that base-2 representation or a vertex' name\n\n    # This dictionary associates to each vertex the set of bits whose switching\n    # yields one of its neighbors:\n\n    action = {v: set() for v in G}\n    for u,v in G.edge_iterator(labels=False):\n        diff = u^v\n        action[u].add(diff)\n        action[v].add(diff)\n\n    action_bitset = {v: sum(action[v]) for v in G}\n\n    # We now check that, for every pair u,v of vertices, there is a neighbor u'\n    # of u such that:\n    #     hamming_distance(u,v) = hammin_distance(u',v) + 1\n\n    for u in G:\n        for v in G:\n            diff = u^v\n            if (action_bitset[u] & diff == 0 and\n                u != v):\n                return False\n\n    return True\n```\n\nExample in Sage:\n\n```\nsage: g = graphs.CubeGraph(5).relabel(lambda x:Integer(x,base=2),inplace=False)\nsage: check_labelling(g)\nTrue\nsage: g.delete_edge(8,24)\nsage: check_labelling(g)\nFalse\n```\n\nPlease tell me what you think,\n\nNathann",

I thought a bit about this, and it does not seem very hard to check that a vertex labelling is correct (a sample of code that does it follows) but perhaps this code is 'theoretically' `n^2log(n)` instead of `n^2`. Considering the efficiency of Python (the `n^2` part) and the efficiency of the `log(n)` part (bitwise operations), however, I wonder if it could not be faster than another Python `n^2` implementation. What do you think?

This code assumes what I believe we can assume: that after the labelling is picked, two adjacent vertices differ by one 'bit' and that this bit is the edge's label. This amounts to being sure that the graph is indeed a *subgraph* of a high-dimension cube, but not that it is isometric. In order to check that it is isometric, I believe that it is sufficient to run the following code.

```python
def check_labelling(G):
    # Assumptions:
    #
    # - We assume that the vertices are integers, whose base-2 representation
    #   represents the coordinates
    #
    # - We also assume that every edge corresponds to the switching of one bit
    #   in that base-2 representation or a vertex' name

    # This dictionary associates to each vertex the set of bits whose switching
    # yields one of its neighbors:

    action = {v: set() for v in G}
    for u,v in G.edge_iterator(labels=False):
        diff = u^v
        action[u].add(diff)
        action[v].add(diff)

    action_bitset = {v: sum(action[v]) for v in G}

    # We now check that, for every pair u,v of vertices, there is a neighbor u'
    # of u such that:
    #     hamming_distance(u,v) = hammin_distance(u',v) + 1

    for u in G:
        for v in G:
            diff = u^v
            if (action_bitset[u] & diff == 0 and
                u != v):
                return False

    return True
```

Example in Sage:

```
sage: g = graphs.CubeGraph(5).relabel(lambda x:Integer(x,base=2),inplace=False)
sage: check_labelling(g)
True
sage: g.delete_edge(8,24)
sage: check_labelling(g)
False
```

Please tell me what you think,

Nathann

The paper assumes that a machine word can store `log(n)` bits, so bitwise operations can be done in `O(d/log(n))` time, where `d` is the degree of the root (these sum up to at most `n-1` over all iterations of the contraction loop).

Of course, failing this assumption, the time complexity here is indeed `O(nm) = O(n^2 log(n))`.

Will take care of that.

Okay, cool !

Yeah probably, though that assumption is rather 'fair'. Don't bother for the moment. I am not done understanding the algorithm, and I will probably add some doc eventually.

Sorry for the slow review, I'm still trying to make sense of the last block of the algorithm, the one which relies on a DFS.

Is there any reason to keep `neighbors` and `ignore_direction` in your DFS/BFS routines? You do not use them.

Hi!

> Is there any reason to keep `neighbors` and `ignore_direction` in your DFS/BFS routines? You do not use them.

No, you can remove them. They are a remnant of the first commit, when these functions were still in `generic_graph.py`.
