All this documentation was pretty outdated, and some formats were missing.

I also tried to make it easier to read/parse, by displaying at the beginning of the INPUT blocks the different formats (and not just by giving their names).

In particular, I do not think that it is very important to burden the users with a 'format' flag in most cases, when there is no ambiguity. However, when the input is a matrix and the behaviour depends on its properties, it is advertised.

A lot of documentation is also removed: some of it is replaced by links toward dedicated modules (i.e. 'how to access the graph catalog') or simply removed: the `__init__` entry in th reference manual is no place to explain how to compute connected components.

There is still a lot of verbosity in this module, and in particular all the file formats *also* appear in the module's documentation (and are, of course, outdated). This will be for later.

One of the points of this branch is also to ease maintainability: when the same things are documented in different places at once, we forget to update all of it when it would be needed. Short, and to the point: that's a reference manual, not a tutorial.

<a id='comment:5'></a>Hellooooooo!

Sorry if I am not very active in these tickets, but I'm quite busy in these days...

Just to say that when I inserted `igraph`, the variable `vertex_labels` was already there, and I only used it in my code. Indeed, you can find examples (written before igraph) where this variable was used (for instance, in `cliques_get_max_clique_graph`).

Though, I have no idea what it was used for! The comment in the code before my modifications was:

```
    -  ``vertex_labels`` - only for implementation == 'c_graph'.
       Whether to allow any object as a vertex (slower), or
       only the integers 0, ..., n-1, where n is the number of vertices.
```
Hope this helps!

Michele

Okay okay. I write these tickets because I want to have some `Graph(filename)` constructor in order to not meet again this problem I had with your .nde files.

In `cliques_get_max_clique_graph` it seems to be an argument of `.show()` (to display the labels) not an argument of `Graph.__init__`. In the constructor, the only occurrence of this `vertex_labels` argument is in the igraph code. If it is user anywhere else, well, it is actually ignored. It is not very bad anyway, just something that has to be done.
