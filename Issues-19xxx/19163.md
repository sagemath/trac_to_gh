```
There is an error in current exception for join-semilattices:

```
P = Poset({'a': ['b', 'c'], 'b': ['d', 'e'], 'c': ['d', 'e'], 'd': ['f'], 'e': ['f']})
P._hasse_diagram._meet
P._hasse_diagram._join
```

gives

```
ValueError: No meet for x=4 y=3
ValueError: No join for x=4 y=3
```

i.e. the message is wrong for `_join`.

What's more, currently sage outputs only `ValueError: Not a lattice.` when creating a lattice. After this it will output `ValueError: Not a lattice: no meet for e and d.`

Jeroen, can you check this until I do more? I.e. is `LatticeMeetException` done as it should?

This is kind of first time when I add something more than new functions to existing classes.

?? Error message is only parsed when there is a message. And to just check use `is_meet_semilattice()`. I can't see how this would slow down anything.

It is very irritating if the elements of the lattice are integers. Then we may got error saying that 5 and 8 have no meet, when actually it is 6 and 10 that have no meet.

Error message is only parsed when there is a message. And to just check use `is_meet_semilattice()`. I can't see how this would slow down anything.\n\nSuppose you iterate over a collection of posets and you want to determine which of them are (semi)lattices. Then for those that are lattices, you do some extra processing on them. Being Pythonic (and to avoid double checking things), you just cast the poset to a lattice and do nothing if an error is thrown. That is where the slowdown comes in.\n\n> > Instead, I would just allow the error from calling `self._hasse_diagram.meet_matrix()` to propagate up.\n\n> \n> It is very irritating if the elements of the lattice are integers. Then we may got error saying that 5 and 8 have no meet, when actually it is 6 and 10 that have no meet.\n\nThat is a good point. However, I would much rather have a less informative error message than the (IMO fugly) string parsing code you currently have.

Suppose you iterate over a collection of posets and you want to determine which of them are (semi)lattices. Then for those that are lattices, you do some extra processing on them. Being Pythonic (and to avoid double checking things), you just cast the poset to a lattice and do nothing if an error is thrown. That is where the slowdown comes in.

That is a good point. However, I would much rather have a less informative error message than the (IMO fugly) string parsing code you currently have. It seems like Volker's suggestion of doing a custom error class will be what you want (if you think it is important to see (only) one instance where the lattice property fails).

You mean something like

n = 0
for P in PP:
    try:
        if LatticePoset(P).cardinality() != 0:
            n += 1
    except:

```

where `PP` is precomputed list of posets. This error reporting is `O(1)` and checking if a poset is lattice is `O(n^2.5)`. So this would be a question only if most posets are non-lattices that are easily recognized (like a poset that is not bounded). I will run some timing on this.

I guess this conflicts with performance you cared in a paragraph just before this one `:=)`. I suppose creating an object is slower than manipulating a string.

Actually I did a code using specific error class and tried to get comments on it, to be sure that I did nothing stupid. But as I got no comments, I decided to do this in a way that I know to work. (And added tests, so that if somebody changes the error string at `hasse_diagram.py` it will be noticed.)

Thanks for doing those timings. I didn't expect too much of a penalty, but if we can have cleaner and less fragile code with extra speed, then why shouldn't we?

I would say the lack of response for your question (if it was "Am I doing something stupid?") is a strong indication that you are not. Personally, I don't think we need to include this in the error message as pdb can be used, but I'm neutral if we add it responsibly.

In more detail, the fragility comes from the fact that we have to rewrite this error message if the underlying error message changes wording. By having a custom class, it means we can easily change the message without having to rewrite this (essentially unrelated) code.

Also, the `int(error.message.split()[3][2:])` creates many, many new transient objects: the `split`, in and of itself, creates a new list, plus the `int`, plus each of the strings in the split. However I was thinking of doing a catch-and-release with the error message by simply updating the two elements of said message. So the error class would look something like this:

```python
class LatticeException(ValueError):
    def __init__(self, fail, x, y):
        ValueError.__init__(self, None)
        self.fail = fail
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
    def __str__(self):
        return "no {} for {} and {}".format(self.fail, self.x, self.y)
```
The result would look like this:

```
sage: raise LatticeException('meet', 5, 2)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
LatticeException                          Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-20-626aad3b7a17> in <module>()
----> 1 raise LatticeException('meet', Integer(5), Integer(2))

LatticeException: no meet for 5 and 2
```

No. I do not trust silence being acception.

But see my commit on comment number 3. I guess it was something like what you suggested.

That's why I added tests. We could also add a comment to the code raising exception in `_meet()` and `_join()`.

That was mainly as a counterpoint to your statement creating objects is more costly than string parsing. I strongly believe string parsing is an evil practice. The fact that it is (micro) slower is just a small part of that belief. The much bigger issue is the readability, extendability, and fragility of the code.

Thank you for making the changes; it definitely improves the code. A few comments:

- Move the comment before `LatticeException` as the docstring for that class so it is visible in the doc.
- Could be bikeshedding, but I'm thinking we should call it `LatticeError` since it is inheriting from `ValueError`. 
- Make the default value for `x` and `y` in `LatticeException` to be `None`.
- All methods need doctests, this includes those for the exceptions
- I would consider making the no top/bottom errors just raise `ValueError`. Granted, this won't look as slick when the error gets reported, but it will be cleaner code. (This would mean we don't need default values for `LatticeException`.) IMO this is also okay since `LatticeException` inherits from `ValueError`.
- The errors are not sentences, so they should start with a lowercase letter.
- I would do:

  ```python
  try:
      P._hasse_diagram.meet_matrix()
  except LatticeException as error:
      error.x = P._vertex_to_element(error.x)
      error.y = P._vertex_to_element(error.y)
      raise
  ```
- Unrelated but I noticed it because there were changes made. I would do this:

  ```diff
  -if isinstance(data,FiniteLatticePoset) and len(args) == 0 and len(options) == 0:
  +if (isinstance(data, FiniteLatticePoset) and not args and not options):
  ```
  as it is the fastest way to check for emptiness.

Now I understand: Green solution, recycling of error message!

Also test passed, and I manually checked meet- and join-semilattices. Hence positive review.

No horry. I have said to some developer (you?) earlier: it took about 2000 years to proof that squaring a circle is impossible. So there is no horry, this is mathematics.
