The following has been annoying me in my doctests. We can take the span of most cones:

```
sage: K = Cone([(1,)])
sage: span(K)
Free module of degree 1 and rank 1 over Integer Ring
Echelon basis matrix:
[1]
sage: span(K, K.lattice().base_ring())
Sublattice <N(1)>
```

But `span()` tries to deduce the base ring itself, and that doesn't work for the trivial cone:

```
sage: K = Cone([], ToricLattice(0))
sage: span(K)
...
AttributeError: 'Objects_with_category' object has no attribute 'base_ring'
```

I've worked around it by implementing `span` as a method on `IntegralRayCollection`:

```
def span(self):
    return span(self, self.lattice().base_ring())
```

Does this approach sound good, or should it be fixed with a special case inside `span()`?

I think it is definitely better to fix cone things in cone modules. Let's just make sure that optional arguments to `span` work in the same way, so it is also possible to do `span(K, QQ)` etc.

I went with the lattice `span` method rather than the global function. Seems a bit cleaner to me and makes no difference for what I'm doing.
