For now, a lot of modules are imported from `sage.coding` when Sage starts.
These modules can be lazy imported instead for better performances.

In `all.py` there's also several deprecated imports related to a 2-year old ticket.
These deprecation warnings can be removed too.

<a id='comment:6'></a>Salut David,

1. The function `cyclotomic_cosets` was deprecated in #16464 which is also more than one year old. Could you remove the function and the import as well?

2. Do you really want to keep `codesize_upper_bound`, `dimension_upper_bound`, etc in the global namespace?

Vincent

Sure, I'll do that.

Not really. I can put them in a catalog so one could access them typing `sage.codes.bounds` or something like that. It would be better. But if I do that, I guess I need to put a new deprecation warning over these bounds, isn't it?
