The following is unexpected:

```
sage: A.<n> = AsymptoticRing('QQ^n * n^QQ', SR)
sage: 2^n
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ArithmeticError: Cannot construct 2^n in Growth Group QQ^n * n^QQ
> *previous* TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for '*':
'Growth Group QQ^n * n^QQ' and 'Growth Group SR^n'
```
The only work-around I found until now is

```
sage: A(AsymptoticRing(growth_group='QQ^n', coefficient_ring=ZZ)('2^n'))
2^n
```
Once this is fixed, the work-around should be removed from #19532 (`asymptotic_expansions.SingularityAnalysis`).

The workaround

```
sage: n.rpow(2)
2^n
```
works. However, for some reason (I still have to track this down) the parent changes to

```
sage: n.rpow(1/2).parent()
Asymptotic Ring <QQ^n * n^SR> over Symbolic Ring
```

<a id='comment:4'></a>I've fixed the original problem. However, there is the following:

```
            sage: T = TermMonoid('exact', GrowthGroup('QQ^n * n^QQ'), SR)
            sage: n = T('n')
            sage: n.rpow(2)
            2^n
            sage: _.parent()
            Exact Term Monoid QQ^n * n^SR with coefficients in Symbolic Ring

        Above, we get ``QQ^n * n^SR`` since
        ::

            sage: (n^SR(1)).parent()
            Exact Term Monoid QQ^n * n^SR with coefficients in Symbolic Ring

        and that is because of

            sage: (QQ(2)^SR(1)).parent(), (QQ(1)*SR(1)).parent()
            (Rational Field, Symbolic Ring)
```
For me this is fine; although it is not nice. What do you think?

Cross-reviewed.

Rewritten.

Ok.

<a id='comment:14'></a>This ticket has added a few doctests of the form

```
            sage: A.<n> = AsymptoticRing('QQ^n * n^QQ', SR)

With #19945, the last result will change to

```

I think that this change makes sense, since a coercion of `QQ` and `SR` should end up in `SR`. If you object, please comment at #19945.
