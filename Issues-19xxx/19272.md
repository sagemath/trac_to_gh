Networkx 1.10 is out.

Some changes introduced in 1.9 change the results of two doctests (to equally valid results). Since Gentoo doesn't carry networkx-1.8.x any more, sage-on-gentoo has a couple of broken doctests for no good reasons.

error: /64bitdev/storage/sage-git_develop/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site.py is not a setuptools-generated site.py; please remove it.
```
and `networkx-1.10` isn't installed. I've never seen this before. I believe `site.py` is installed by `python` and removing it may not be wise.

Perhaps this is the problem in `setup.py`

```
from setuptools import setup

Previous versions had
