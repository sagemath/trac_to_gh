Networkx 1.10 is out.

Some changes introduced in 1.9 change the results of two doctests (to equally valid results). Since Gentoo doesn't carry networkx-1.8.x any more, sage-on-gentoo has a couple of broken doctests for no good reasons.

and `networkx-1.10` isn't installed. I've never seen this before. I believe `site.py` is installed by `python` and removing it may not be wise.
