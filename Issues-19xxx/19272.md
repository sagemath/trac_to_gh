Networkx 1.10 is out.

Some changes introduced in 1.9 change the results of two doctests (to equally valid results). Since Gentoo doesn't carry networkx-1.8.x any more, sage-on-gentoo has a couple of broken doctests for no good reasons.

OK, doing this here I get

```
creating dist

removing 'build/bdist.linux-x86_64/egg' (and everything under it)
error: /64bitdev/storage/sage-git_develop/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site.py is not a setuptools-generated site.py; please remove it.
```
and `networkx-1.10` isn't installed. I've never seen this before. I believe `site.py` is installed by `python` and removing it may not be wise.

Yes, I had wondered about the

python setup.py install --home="$SAGE_LOCAL" --force

And good catch on the decorator dependency. I would have missed that. Looks good here.
