```
The generic method `divides` that can be found in `src/sage/structure/element.pyx` uses `quo_rem` (*via* `%`) to test if an element divides another one: `return (x % self) == 0`. 

For polynomials, depending on the implementations, the method `quo_rem` may raise an error if the divisor is not monic (see #16649 for more on this).

This ticket aims at implementing a method `divides` for the class `Polynomial`, so that it catches the errors in `quo_rem` to return `False` when it is needed.

**Example of a problematic behavior:**

```python
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(ZZ, implementation="FLINT")
sage: p = 2*x + 1
sage: q = R.random_element(10)
sage: p.divides(q)
False
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(ZZ, implementation="NTL")
sage: p = R(p)
sage: q = R(q)
sage: p.divides(q)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ArithmeticError: division not exact in Z[x] (consider coercing to Q[x] first)
```

You would better use `coerce_binop` from `sage.structure.element` rather than a manually handled coercion.

Why is this code specific to polynomials?

> Why is this code specific to polynomials?

I tried to explain the reasons in the description: For polynomials over (say) `ZZ`, the euclidean division is not well defined. The problem occurs when the leading coefficient is not invertible. There are several ways to deal with this problem, and different implementations in Sage use different conventions (see #16649 for pointers on this). As a result, testing divisibility by invoking `self % p == 0` can lead to `ArithmeticError` for polynomials: But when this exception is raised, we know that `self` does not divide `p`.¹ That's why I decided to add this new method which only differs from the generic one by the fact it catches the exception. 

I could have changed the generic method instead to catch an `ArithmeticError` and return `False` in such case, but though I am pretty confident that it makes sense for polynomials, I am much less confident concerning other rings.

¹ "We know" is maybe a too strong assumption. In #16649, I did changes that ensure that the assumption holds for all *current implementations* of polynomials in Sage. (This was not the case before.) Yet, future implementations may break this rule. This may imply that we shouldn't simply rely on `quo_rem` to test divisibility.

I am not sure I fully understand your latest comments:

Do you mean adding a `try: ... except NotImplementedError:` construction? Because if I add this test say right below the test `if self.is_unit(): return True`, an exception will be raised in the cases where `is_unit` is not implemented but `is_one` is.



> And why not using `quo_rem` instead of catching a potential `ArithmeticError`?

Using `p % self` is really the same as ` p.quo_rem(self)[1] ` so I do not see the difference.

I meant

```
try:
    if self.is_unit(): return True   # units divide everything
except NotImplementedError:
    if self.is_one(): return True    # if is_unit is not implemented
```

Not exactly. NTL makes a distinction... and you should actually use `pseudo_quo_rem` when it is there:

```
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(ZZ, implementation="NTL")
sage: p = 2*x + 1
sage: q = R.random_element(10)
sage: p.quo_rem(q)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ArithmeticError: division not exact in Z[x] (consider coercing to Q[x] first)
sage: p.pseudo_quo_rem(q)
(0, 2*x + 1)
```

Not done: I do not think `pseudo_quo_rem` is applicable, because of the following:

```python
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[] # works the same with NTL
sage: p = x^2 - 1
sage: q = 2*x + 2
sage: p.pseudo_quo_rem(q)
(2*x - 2, 0)
```
So, the remainder in `p.pseudo_quo_rem(q)` can be zero even if `q` does not divide `p`.


P.S.: I won't be able to work on this ticket until mid-august.

FWIW, I agree that using `is_zero()` would be better, but I don't think it matters enough for blocking the ticket.
Considering that an `ArithmeticError` implies that there is no divisibility looks very reasonable to me, though testing divisibility of the leading coefficients would likely be faster.

I've pushed my branch but some doctest fails. Actually I need some advice.

* The `try... except ArithmeticError` is needed for `PolynomialRing(ZZ, 'x', implementation = 'NTL')` since in this implementation `quo_rem` raises an exception for non-divisible polynomials, even when the leading coefficients divide each other. See [ticket:16649] for details.

* Contrary to what my (broken) commit message might indicate, I did not add a leading coefficient test that would fasten the computation. The problem comes from the `Zmod(6)['x']` example: In `Zmod(6)`, computing the remainder raise exceptions. (Test for instance `Zmod(6)(1) % Zmod(6)(4)`.)

* As mentioned before, there is still a failing doctest, also due to `Zmod(6)['x']`. We face the same kind problem as before with the 'NTL' implementation of Z[x]: Computing `quo_rem` in `Zmod(6)['x']` is only possible if the leading coefficient of the divisor is a unit (an exception is raised otherwise). The exception is not caught since contrary to the case of `ZZ['x']`, the raised exception is a `ValueError`.

I am not sure to see what the best solutions are to make it work. Some possibilities:

* We make this ticket depend on another one that unifies all the `quo_rem` implementations for polynomials over non-field, so that we can base this function on the common behavior of these methods.¹
* We make this ticket depend on another one with more limited goals, such as unifying the errors to `ArithmeticError`.
* We add some specific code, to catch the `ValueError`.

What do you think? 

The first solution seem to me unreachable given the endless discussions about the behavior of `quo_rem` (links in [ticket:16649]). The second one is maybe more doable. The third one is probably the faster to close this ticket but I am not sure whether there is a good way to implement it.

¹ More generally, there should exist a ticket for unifying the diverse behaviors of polynomial rings, but 1. it is clearly off-topic this ticket and 2. given the difficulty with unifying "content" in another ticket, I am not at all ready to go for this!

<a id='comment:34'>**Comment 34:**</a>
An `ArithmeticError` in `%` does not imply not divisible as shown with

```
sage: R.<x> = Zmod(6)[]
sage: S.<z> = R[]
sage: p = x*z + 1
sage: q = z + 1
sage: (p*q) % p
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ArithmeticError: Division non exact (consider coercing to polynomials over the fraction field)
```
The reason being that

```
sage: Z6 = Zmod(6)
sage: a = Z6(4)
sage: b = Z6(2)
sage: b.divides(a)
True
sage: a / b
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ZeroDivisionError: Inverse does not exist.
```
From there three possibilities:
- "fix" divisions in integer mod ring `Zmod` so that `a / b` above does work. Though in
  this situation there are several possible answers as `4 = 2 x 5 = 2 x 2 mod 6`.
- restrict `divides` on polynomial whose base rings are integral domains (so that division
  is well defined: quotient is unique when it exists).

A far from efficient method consist in

1. testing divisibility of leading coefficients `b_m | a_n`
2. if yes, test all possible quotients `q` so that `a_n = q b_m`

But for that, you need a method that return all quotients. Hence my remark.

```
sage: R.<x> = Zmod(6)[]
sage: (2*x +1).divides(3)
False
sage: (2*x + 1) * 3 == 3
True
```
(testing divisibility of leading coefficient is not even valid... I was wrong)

You need a line break after `TESTS::`

It should be documented that this method only works for integral domains. And the examples with Zmod(6) (raising error) should be in the `EXAMPLES` block rather than `TESTS`.
