This is a container ticket for minor documentation typos found in version 6.8. I'll add them here, if I am not doing another ticket for same part of Sage. Of course others can also make additions to this.

- generic_graph.py / breadth_first_search / :meth:`successors` broken link. Same with depth first.
- generic_graph.py / is_planar, broken link to sage.graphs.planarity
- To posets/__init__.html add links also to finite categories of posets and lattices.
- posets.py, relabel(), wrong indentation after INPUT section.
- Group theory tutorial, list of small groups, two `}`

But then we should just open a new one... And I guess 6.9 will not be out for some time.

I did this because a) Nathann hoped for less tickets, at least tickets only correcting a typo or two, b) Sage seems to still have small typos that I found when reading the manuals, and c) for me it seems unlogical to correct totally non-relating typo in some ticket.

As an artifical example: Let's suppose that I wonder about Frattini sublattice. When thinking about docstring I see a typo in Frattini subgroup. Now I should make a note about the typo, so that I won't forget it when I make a patch at last.
