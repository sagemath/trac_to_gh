This is a container ticket for minor documentation typos found in version 6.8. I'll add them here, if I am not doing another ticket for same part of Sage. Of course others can also make additions to this.

- generic_graph.py / breadth_first_search / :meth:`successors` broken link. Same with depth first.
- generic_graph.py / is_planar, broken link to sage.graphs.planarity
- To posets/__init__.html add links also to finite categories of posets and lattices.
- posets.py, relabel(), wrong indentation after INPUT section.
- Group theory tutorial, list of small groups, two `}`

Hellooooooooo !

I fixed some of the points you listed here, and so I add the commit. To be honest I am a bit scared to add a commit on a ticket that is not in `needs_review`, for I am worried that it may get forgotten... Saw this happen too many times already `:-/`

> I took care of the typos in the group theory tuto and posets. Maybe we can just stop there for the moment ?

But then we should just open a new one... And I guess 6.9 will not be out for some time.

I did this because a) Nathann hoped for less tickets, at least tickets only correcting a typo or two, b) Sage seems to still have small typos that I found when reading the manuals, and c) for me it seems unlogical to correct totally non-relating typo in some ticket.

As an artifical example: Let's suppose that I wonder about Frattini sublattice. When thinking about docstring I see a typo in Frattini subgroup. Now I should make a note about the typo, so that I won't forget it when I make a patch at last.

I look throught your pathces. Two questions:

- Why is `interior_paths` removed from index?

Otherwise all seems good. As beta5 is already out, maybe we should close this and start collecting typos for 6.10. Please also review my small patch that add two links.

Odd. Well, I guess it was meant to be references toward `.show` and `.plot`.

Beta6 was released, so maybe this one should be closed. Nathann is busy. Frédéric, can you check my changes: 1) "M\"oibus" to "Möbius" is `hasse_diagram.py`, 2) two links added in `posets/__init__.py` and 3) removed links in `graph_plot_js.py`? After these this can be set to postive review, as I already check changes made by you and Nathann.
