This is a container ticket for minor documentation typos found in version 6.8. I'll add them here, if I am not doing another ticket for same part of Sage. Of course others can also make additions to this.

- generic_graph.py / breadth_first_search / :meth:`successors` broken link. Same with depth first.
- generic_graph.py / is_planar, broken link to sage.graphs.planarity
- To posets/__init__.html add links also to finite categories of posets and lattices.
- posets.py, relabel(), wrong indentation after INPUT section.
- Group theory tutorial, list of small groups, two `}`

Hellooooooooo !

I fixed some of the points you listed here, and so I add the commit. To be honest I am a bit scared to add a commit on a ticket that is not in `needs_review`, for I am worried that it may get forgotten... Saw this happen too many times already `:-/`

But then we should just open a new one... And I guess 6.9 will not be out for some time.

I did this because a) Nathann hoped for less tickets, at least tickets only correcting a typo or two, b) Sage seems to still have small typos that I found when reading the manuals, and c) for me it seems unlogical to correct totally non-relating typo in some ticket.

As an artifical example: Let's suppose that I wonder about Frattini sublattice. When thinking about docstring I see a typo in Frattini subgroup. Now I should make a note about the typo, so that I won't forget it when I make a patch at last.

Beta6 was released, so maybe this one should be closed. Nathann is busy. Frédéric, can you check my changes: 1) "M\"oibus" to "Möbius" is `hasse_diagram.py`, 2) two links added in `posets/__init__.py` and 3) removed links in `graph_plot_js.py`? After these this can be set to postive review, as I already check changes made by you and Nathann.
