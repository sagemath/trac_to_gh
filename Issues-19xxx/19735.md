Breaks `timeit` because of https://bugs.python.org/issue5633 more precisely this commit https://hg.python.org/cpython/rev/14d1018940cb.

That's the kind of problems

```
sage: from sage.misc.sage_timeit import sage_timeit
sage: sage_timeit('3^100000', globals(), preparse=True, number=50)

KeyError: ‘init’
```
Every single doctest relying on `timeit` breaks. From what I can see from the commit adding `'init': ''` to the timeit_.template call may be enough. I haven't tested this yet.
