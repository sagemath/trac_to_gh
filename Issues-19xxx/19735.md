**Tarball**: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.12/Python-2.7.12.tgz

Since Python 2.7.13 has issues with `__new__`, I postpone that to #22037.

Breaks `timeit` because of https://bugs.python.org/issue5633 more precisely this commit https://hg.python.org/cpython/rev/14d1018940cb.

That's the kind of problems

```
sage: from sage.misc.sage_timeit import sage_timeit
sage: sage_timeit('3^100000', globals(), preparse=True, number=50)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
KeyError                                  Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-2-e93b8105f8e1> in <module>()
----> 1 sage_timeit('3^100000', globals(), preparse=True, number=Integer(50))

/home/frb15/gentoo/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/misc/sage_timeit.pyc in sage_timeit(stmt, globals_dict, preparse, number, repeat, precision, seconds)
   218     # to the shell namespace?
   219 
--> 220     src = timeit_.template % {'stmt': timeit_.reindent(stmt, 8), 'setup': "pass"}
   221     code = compile(src, "<magic-timeit>", "exec")
   222     ns = {}

KeyError: ‘init’
```
Every single doctest relying on `timeit` breaks. From what I can see from the commit adding `'init': ''` to the timeit_.template call may be enough. I haven't tested this yet.
