**Tarball**: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.12/Python-2.7.12.tgz

Since Python 2.7.13 has issues with `__new__`, I postpone that to #22037.

Breaks `timeit` because of https://bugs.python.org/issue5633 more precisely this commit https://hg.python.org/cpython/rev/14d1018940cb.

That's the kind of problems

```
sage: from sage.misc.sage_timeit import sage_timeit
sage: sage_timeit('3^100000', globals(), preparse=True, number=50)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

   218     # to the shell namespace?

   221     code = compile(src, "<magic-timeit>", "exec")

KeyError: ‘init’
```
Every single doctest relying on `timeit` breaks. From what I can see from the commit adding `'init': ''` to the timeit_.template call may be enough. I haven't tested this yet.
