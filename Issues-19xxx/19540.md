In principle, this would be fine; however, the following example fails:

```
sage: A.<m> = AsymptoticRing('m^QQ', QQ)
sage: m.factorial()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: ...
>>>>>> *previous* ArithmeticError: Cannot build log(m)
since log(m) is not in Growth Group
m^QQ * (e^(n*log(n)))^QQ * (e^n)^QQ * n^QQ * log(n)^QQ.
```
The problem is that the method tries to build the correct growth group in `n` (hard-coded) but has no influence on the given growth group.
And if we have something like `log(m).factorial()`, then everything gets more involved.
This either needs to be fixed or documented.

1+2: In the way it is it allows to build `n.factorial()` starting in `AsymptoticRing('m^QQ * n^QQ', QQ)`; `self.parent().variable_names()` would not allow this.

I added a doctest because I wanted to know what happens for a generic growth group. At first glance, it was surprising that I do get an `AttributeError` instead of a `NotImplementedError`. The method `is_one` seems to be contributed by the category.

I noticed that the docstring of `GenericGrowthGroup` (and the other growth groups) says "It has to be a subcategory of Join of Category of groups and Category of posets. This is also the default category if None is specified." which is a relict from the past.

Furthermore, we have

```
    # set everything up to determine category
    from sage.categories.sets_cat import Sets
    from sage.categories.posets import Posets
    from sage.categories.magmas import Magmas
    from sage.categories.additive_magmas import AdditiveMagmas
```
in the class `GenericGrowthGroup` which shows all these Categories in the documentation, similar as #20045.

Shall we fix those in a separate ticket or right here?

Please cross-review my commit and set to positive_review if you are satisfied.
