Ticket #19531 deals with converting binary and hex strings into elements from the fields `GF(2^n)` and `GF(2^(4n))` and vice versa. This ticket should extend the functionality of #19531 to matrix and vector spaces over finite fields.
In particular,
- Matrix spaces and vector spaces over `GF(2^n)` and `GF(2^(4n))` should accept strings composed of the concatenation of length `n` binary strings of the form `0b111...` or length `4n` hex strings of the form `0xfff...` and should break up the strings accordingly to produce a matrix or vector.
- Matrices and vectors over `GF(2^n)` and `GF(2^(4n))` should be able to combine the individual hex/binary strings for each of its elements into a single long string.

Depends on #19531
