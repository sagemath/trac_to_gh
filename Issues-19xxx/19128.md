The old IPython package was split up in many packages and various dependencies were added. The IPython notebook is now called Jupyter.

Just to make Sage development easier. Imagine the following situation:
* You test this ticket
* You are done with reviewing this ticket, so you checkout some other branch
* That branch has IPython 3.x
* Sage breaks because `path.py` 8.1 is still installed

This actually happened to me. It's nothing serious, but it's at least annoying.

It has some merit. For big review like this one I create a clone first and build it from scratch, no other branch present unless I test a follow up ticket. I probably should do a build of this on my mac.
