More generally on NTL: do we really need all this "thin" wrappers which do not seem to be used anywhere in Sage?

I'm not sure if they are all used, but some are certainly used.

But really, we have thin wrappers for libGAP objects, for PARI objects, ... so why not NTL?

I'm not completely convinced.
For example the finite field and polynomial stuff directly uses the C++ classes.

That's a good point.
