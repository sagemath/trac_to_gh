Keywords: quantum bruhat graph

The primary goal of this ticket is to improve the creation speed for the quantum Bruhat graph. We do this in a number of ways:

- Better management of data associated to `lattice.nonparabolic_positive_roots`.
- Implement a (temporary) cache of the lengths of elements.

In addition, we also provide some general speedups to all matrix groups and Coxeter groups that came from looking into the above improvements. The net result is over 12x speedup of the creation of the quantum Bruhat graph:

```
sage: W = WeylGroup(['D',5], prefix='s')
sage: %time G = W.quantum_bruhat_graph()
CPU times: user 14 s, sys: 60.6 ms, total: 14 s
Wall time: 14 s
```
whereas previously this took over 3 minutes to compute. The downside is this has a larger memory footprint because of the temporary cache, but repeatedly computing the lengths of the elements was far too expensive.

This also includes a speedup of iterating over the entire Coxeter/Weyl group.

A few questions:

1) What is a quantum Bruhat graph, and where can I read about it?

2) Have the indirect doctests from `_finite_recognition` been salvaged?

Also, when changing DiGraph, can you please add the right format in analogy to http://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit/?id=6cb47c00ca2315caf9b873506a0ea167d6706c41 ? Thank you!

It is the usual Bruhat poset but with added "quantum" edges that are used for many purposes. One particular use in Sage is for specializations of Macdonald polynomials at `t=0`. See, e.g.,

Not exactly, but essentially the same tests in `recognize_coxeter_type_from_matrix` in `sage.combinat.root_system.coxeter_matrix`. So I would say everything is covered.

Technically I didn't change the input for the digraph, but I can add it in if you're not going to make other additions.

Added. The `__matrix` was just duplicating what `matrix()` already does and resulted in quite a big speedup to iteration (it cut it in half IIRC).

With #19825 and my recent changes, it just takes 4 seconds on my laptop to iterate over D<sub>5</sub>. Now the biggest speed gain (about 2.5s) will be in improving matrix multiplication over the UCF, as opposed to speeding up the comparisons (about 1.5s)

One takeaway message: if you are working in a simply-laced type for `CoxeterGroup`, use `ZZ`.

No, it only works for simply-laced types as the `cos(\pi / m)` needs to be rational:

```
sage: W = CoxeterGroup(['B',2])
sage: W.gens()
(
[           -1 E(8) - E(8)^3]  [            1             0]
[            0             1], [E(8) - E(8)^3            -1]
)
```

I also added my datapoint for #9285, but it seems infeasible at this point using `CoxeterGroup`. The majority of the time is spent looking through the descents, which has to be done for keeping the constant memory iteration.

So if we really wanted to go a bit crazy with things, we should implement some kind of custom iterator that subclasses `SearchForest`, as well as avoid converting to/from the index set and use `{0,1,...,n}`. Although I would say the next step would be the cythonization of the matrix group element classes if we wanted to try and squeeze more out of it right now.
