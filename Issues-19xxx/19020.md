The resolution of MILP involves randomness. So the answer should not be taken as being constant. Such assumption was made in a doctest of `BalancedIncompleteBlockDesign.arc`. See [this example](http://patchbot.sagemath.org/log/18246/debian/8.1/x86_64/3.16.0-4-amd64/mangouste/2015-08-12%2020:09:03%20+0000?short) for a failure (using `CBC` backend).
