Error: could not find a package matching ...
       Try 'sage --package list' to see the available packages
       Did you mean: ...?

ralf@ark:~/sage> ./sage --package-list
sage-run received unknown option: --package-list
usage: sage [options]
Try 'sage -h' for more information.
```
Same with `-package-list`.
