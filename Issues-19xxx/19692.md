<a id='comment:2'>**Comment 2:**</a>
Against 6.10rc0, this passes ptestlong with one error I get also with "bare" 6.10rc0 (see [this thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-release/7TvrWAG7Rr0) on sage-release). I'm trying my hand at re-compiling from a fresh clone of the git source...

Requesting review notwithstanding.
