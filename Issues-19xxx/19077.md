```
The current code goes over all vertex pairs and checks existence of all possible edges, which is extremely inefficient for, say, posets, whose graphs are far from complete. This is a big problem when mixed with unique representation of finite posets.

So let's iterate over edges directly.

so there is actually speed gain due to posets being stored...

I can review this.

Just a side note: why test `self.weighted() != other.weighted()` is after `any(x not in other for x in self)`? Seems unlogical exception to rule of having most easy tests first.

Just a note: if you ever want more speed than that for posets, it is possible to get it. Posets are stored internally as 'static sparse graphs', and that can be done in linear time (~m) instead of ~mlog(n) here.

That speedup with be small, however, compared to this one.

I did that because it is tested several lines above that `self.weighted() == other.weighted()`.

A graph, in the case of Poset, is stored as a 'static sparse graph', i.e. as a int array in order to save as much ram as possible. First, consider that calling `.edges()` may (in theory) require an amount of memory compared to which the original graph itself is negligible, as it would store it as a Python lis of pairs.

Then, `.edges()` sorts its output (that's not necessarily a good idea, I know).

Still, in theory, the result of `G.edges` cannot be assumed to be unique on two graphs which are equal. This, because sorting pairs requires sorting vertices, and that vertices need not be totally ordered. 

So, in theory, there is nothing at all that can lead to think that what you algorithm does is not *totally awful*, i.e. a complexity of `m^2` comparisons between vertices (i.e. find m times an edge in a list of size m).

If you insist on changing the way labels are tested for equality in this ticket, and if we do not plan to require labels to be hashable in order to test equality between two graphs (which would let us compare sets instead of lists), then for this reason I think that it would be better to use this 'set equality without hashing' through lists that you use, but to use it on labels instead of using it on the whole list of edges.

In the 'easy case' where the graph is simple but is declared in Sage as a multigraph, this algorithm would, at least, offer similar performance as the one defined on simple graphs.

Hello !

I agree with the new version of the code. I would have prefered if you had left it where it was, i.e. indented after a 'else'. I consider it a matter of "personal taste", and I believe that it is 'better manners' not to force your own taste on what was there before you arrived. Not very important.

Besides this, I agree with your code so you can consider it positively reviewed (let's way for the patchbot's green light, just in case).

Thanks,

Nathann
