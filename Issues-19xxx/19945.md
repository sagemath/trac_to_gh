```
sage: A.<n> = AsymptoticRing('QQ^n*n^QQ', QQ)
sage: (1/2)^n
(1/2)^n
```
does work.

The problem is that `(1/2)^n` calls `__pow__` of the rational `1/2`. This tries `A(1/2)^n`, which fails since `1/2` is not in `A`. This also explains why it works with coefficient ring `QQ` as in [comment:1 comment:1].

As a workaround you can use

```
sage: n.rpow(1/2)
```

No idea. I just thought I would review this ticket, merged your branch in the current `develop`, and ran the test suite.

I thought we already had some special casing for this with `IntegerPowAction`?

IMO, it is really easy to accidentally construct integers that are rational numbers, so that is why I think there is some merit to special casing that. However, I don't know how often this occurs in practice. My gut tells me that exponentiation of rationals is usually not a bottleneck in most computations, so I might be being too precious here.
