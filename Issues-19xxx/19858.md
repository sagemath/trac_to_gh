Building twice the documentation from the same sources should produce the exact same result, byte for byte.  This requires removing hexadecimal addresses like `function <lambda> at 0xdeadbeef`.

This will make it easier to diff docs to review doc-related tickets.

With the branch applied, the only source of non-reproducibility is this one:
