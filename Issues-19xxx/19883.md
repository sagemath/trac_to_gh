```
For historical reasons, the PARI stack is actually handled "manually" by Sage. The main reason was to implement auto-resizing of the stack in case a command failed due to a stack overflow. With the introduction of `parisizemax`, PARI can handle this on its own.

A new patch (submitted to `pari-dev`) is added to silence PARI's warnings about the stack size.

Depends on #19933

Two small comments (no time for a complete review):
- remove mention of the deleted `public_memory_functions.patch` in `build/pkgs/pari/patches/README.txt`
- I think you can remove the following lines from `PariInstance.__dealloc__()`:

```
        sage_free(<void*>pari_mainstack.vbot)
        pari_mainstack.rsize = 0
        pari_mainstack.vsize = 0
        pari_mainstack.bot = 0
        pari_mainstack.vbot = 0
        pari_mainstack.top = 0
```

You may want to silence these warnings as well.  I would also suggest `allocatemem()` should print both the actual and the maximum stack sizes with `silent=False`.

Sure.

> On a certain system that I use, this causes Sage to show up in ps or top as using 129 gigabytes of virtual memory

I don't think that this is a problem. It's virtual and unused memory, so it shouldn't hurt at all.

I also wouldn't want to hardcode a `parisizemax` (like in your branch, you use 1G). If you have a machine with lots of RAM, you may want to actually use it.

Sure, the amount in my branch was just meant to be some arbitrary default until I found a better solution (which I never got around to).  I thought about making this configurable, with some reasonable default that would be sufficient for most users.

The `MAP_NORESERVE` is indeed important, together with the fact that PARI tries to use a small stack if possible. The enlarged stack is only used when it's really needed.

Then why do you think that overcommitting was invented in the first place? Because processes often ask for more memory than they actually use.

Anyway, let's stop this discussion and think about how to actually choose how much memory to allocate for the PARI stack.
