```
For historical reasons, the PARI stack is actually handled "manually" by Sage. The main reason was to implement auto-resizing of the stack in case a command failed due to a stack overflow. With the introduction of `parisizemax`, PARI can handle this on its own.

A new patch (submitted to `pari-dev`) is added to silence PARI's warnings about the stack size.

Depends on #19933

Two small comments (no time for a complete review):
- remove mention of the deleted `public_memory_functions.patch` in `build/pkgs/pari/patches/README.txt`
- I think you can remove the following lines from `PariInstance.__dealloc__()`:

```
        sage_free(<void*>pari_mainstack.vbot)
        pari_mainstack.rsize = 0
        pari_mainstack.vsize = 0
        pari_mainstack.bot = 0
        pari_mainstack.vbot = 0
        pari_mainstack.top = 0
```

You may want to silence these warnings as well.  I would also suggest `allocatemem()` should print both the actual and the maximum stack sizes with `silent=False`.

On a certain system that I use, this causes Sage to show up in `ps` or `top` as using 129 gigabytes of virtual memory (and `pari.stackmax()` returns exactly 128 gigabytes).  Of course this is harmless as long as the memory isn't actually used, but it looks/feels somewhat absurd.",

I'm not sure what to think about the strategy to set the maximum PARI stack size to 1/4 of the maximum amount of memory that `malloc()` can allocate.  On a certain system that I use, this causes Sage to show up in `ps` or `top` as using 129 gigabytes of virtual memory (and `pari.stackmax()` returns exactly 128 gigabytes).  Of course this is harmless as long as the memory isn't actually used, but it looks/feels somewhat absurd.

Sure.

I don't think that this is a problem. It's virtual and unused memory, so it shouldn't hurt at all.

I also wouldn't want to hardcode a `parisizemax` (like in your branch, you use 1G). If you have a machine with lots of RAM, you may want to actually use it.

```c
static void *
pari_mainstack_malloc(size_t size)
{
  void *b = mmap(NULL, size, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE,
                             MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS|MAP_NORESERVE,-1,0);

```

The `MAP_NORESERVE` is indeed important, together with the fact that PARI tries to use a small stack if possible. The enlarged stack is only used when it's really needed.
