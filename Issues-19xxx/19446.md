We add a hook statistics on binary trees.

The hook of a vertex v is the union of {v}, its leftmost and·           
rightmost branches.

There is a unique way to partition the vertices in hooks.               
The number of hooks in such a partition is the hook number of the tree. 

We can obtain this partition recursively by extracting the root's hook· 
and iterating the processus on each tree of the remaining forest.

Quand on travaille à plusieurs sur les mêmes tickets, on peut utiliser comme nom de branche un truc du style `public/hook_statistics_in_binary_trees` pour ne pas avoir a changer le nom de la branche à chaque fois.

<a id='comment:13'></a>I did not get the definition of hook upon first reading.  Thus, here are some suggestions for the docstrings.  A reference where one can find a definition would be good, too.

```
    Return the comb of a tree.

    There are two combs in a binary tree: a left comb and a right comb.
    Consider the vertices of the leftmost (resp. rightmost) branch of 
    the root, excluding the root itself.  The left (resp. right) comb 
    is the list of right (resp. left) subtree of each of these vertices.

    INPUT:

    - ``side`` -- (default: 'left') set to 'left' to obtain the left 
      comb, and to 'right' to obtain the right comb.

    OUTPUT:

    A list of binary trees.
```

```
    Return the number of hooks.

    The hook of a vertex v is the subtree that consists of {v}, the
    leftmost branch and the rightmost branch of v.

    The set of hooks partitions the binary tree.  The number of hooks
    in such a partition is the hook number of the tree.

    We can obtain this partition recursively by extracting the root's
    hook and repeating the process on each tree of the remaining
    forest.
