Hum https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/develop/build/pkgs/pari/patches/get_ld.patch is probably not a good idea if you want to set runpath. Also it looks like I am adding stuff in gentoo to respect `LDFLAGS` but there is no equivalent in sage:

```
	# propagate ldflags
	sed -i \
		-e 's/$shared $extra/$shared $extra \\$(LDFLAGS)/' \
		config/get_dlld || die "failed to fix LDFLAGS"
```
