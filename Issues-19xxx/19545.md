A couple of remarks:

- Bad indentation in the 'reference' blocks.
- This is ridiculous

  ```
  sum(map(lambda i: P[a.index(g**(2*i))], xrange(1, 2*t)))
  ```
  Forget these lambda functions and use Python. It will be easier to read, and less costly in memory/computations. What you want is `sum(P[a.index(g**(2*i))] for i in range(1,2*t))`.

- You did the right thing when you defined the function `B(m)`. Please do the same for the lambda function that you use to define `A`.

Should we have a function that attempts to construct an SRG with parameters `(4z+1,2z,z-1,z)` ?

One can do this either for `4z+1` a prime power (then it could be Paley graph), or
`4z+1=(4t+1)(4t-1)^2`, for `t` for which the construction of this ticket works, in particular so that there is an SRG with parameters `(4t+1,2t,t-1,t)`. I.e. there is a recursion.

so if we want a proper `is_whatever()` function (which will absorb `is_paley()`) dealing with such graphs, we need to be able to say with certainty that we can build it, before returning a promise (i.e. that `t[0](*t[1:])` thing) to build it.

This will need something like what we do for (skew) Hadamard matrices; where should such functions for graphs go?

Hello Dima,

I don't think that we need some specific function that would manage both paley graphs and these ones, but that's probably up to you given that I have not read the code yet. I usually prefer to keep things as simple as possible, so one `is_` function by constructor is fine with me.

About your `is_` function, I do not understand why you would need something different from the usual output: it *does* tell you with certainty that there is a way to build the function.

The situation with (4z+1,2z,z-1,z)-graphs is akin to these ones that come from Hadamard matrices only in this case we have conference matrices, of size 2 (mod 4), which is the number `v` of
graph vertices +1.

With Hadamard graphs, we have these RHCD (sp?) recursive constructions of yours; for conference
matrices, we have yet to code such a recursive construction).
Apart from Paley and the construction of this ticket, there are potentially more (e.g. some OAs
can give such graphs, when `v` is a square).

Where do we put such a construction?

Helloooooooooooooooo Dima,

Thank you for this strongly regular graph. Here is a first-pass review:

- The `G` parameter scared me a bit, but it seems that you don't use it at
  all. Same for `L`. Could you remove them?

- That's one useless lambda function `:-P`

  ```diff
  -return (lambda q : MathonPseudocyclicStronglyRegularGraph(q),t)
  +return (MathonPseudocyclicStronglyRegularGraph,t)
  ```

- (not important) you split 'import' blocks when they are longer than 80
  characters. I believe that in those cases the code is more readable if you
  leave it on it line.

  ```
  +    from sage.matrix.constructor import matrix, block_matrix, \
  +        ones_matrix, identity_matrix
  ```
  If it were me I wouldn't have split this one. Just a remark, it's up to you.

- I don't think that you need to import `ValueError` (or any of the common
  Python exceptions). It's always around.

- Misleading index:

  ```
  +    # Order the elements of K in K_list
  +    # so that K_list[i] = -K_list[n-i-1], and 0 comes last
  ```
  `n-i-2`?

- You really don't find the latter more legible?...

  ```
  P = map(lambda b: matrix(ZZ,q,q,lambda i,j: 1 if a[j]==a[i]+b else 0), a)
  P = [matrix(ZZ,q,q,lambda i,j: 1 if a[j]==a[i]+b else 0)
       for b in a]
  ```

- There is a missing ')' in your TODO block.

Nathann

well, I plan to provide an example of how to use L (for `v=441` (t=2) one can get an interesting example). The smallest example where one can provide G  different from the default has `v=25*23^2` (t=4). I can do this too (although it would be tagged `# very long time an' lotsa RAM`).

there are more places like this there - this one was copied from `is_paley`...

oh right, it's from your comments to something a bit different -- I'll fix this.

HMmmmmmmmm. Well, my problem with those arguments is that it is very hard for an
end-user to understand what exactly they do. You say that the construction is
"parameterized" by a skew latin square, and that one can provide one, but
well.. Does not look very appealing.

Okay, let's say that I agree. I'll blame it on your unnatural obsession with
having 'all SRGs of each parameter set' and not 'just any of them' `:-P`

> there are more places like this there - this one was copied from `is_paley`...

Well, please fix this one at least `:-P`

> unless it's a violation of something, I don't mind

It's probably a violation of something, but that something is just "another
guy's advice". Decide for yourself `:-P`

I forgive you, but please think of the childr----- of the cost in memory and cpu
usage of what you do, for those lambda functions which you like for their
'efficiency and simplicity' waste both of them, uselessly. When you write code,
think of what the computer does with it `:-P`

HAve fuuuuuuuuuun,

Nathann

Hellooooooooo Dima,

Thanks for this additional details in the doc.

About your example: you say in the doc that `that non-isomorphic Latin squares still lead to isomorphic graphs`, and I have two questions about it:

1) Are you sure that the latin squares are not isomorphic?

2) Would you mind inserting a 'can' in the sentence above, i.e. 'that non-isomorphic Latin squares *CAN* still lead to isomorphic graphs'?

Other remarks

1) You should add two backquotes around 'None' in the doc, as they appear in LaTeX script

2) Funny, that's the first time I see a time-consuming call to is_isomorphic. Note that computing .automorphism_group (with 'bliss' installed) is much faster! So far 'bliss' is not automatically called for isomorphism test, however, but I expect that it would perform much better if the time taken by automorphism_group is a good indicator

3) About your 'language' issues and the variety of dictators: it's another matter of taste, but I find your endline '\' quite distateful. Note that you do not need them when there is an unclosed parenthesis, e.g. the following works both in the console and in .py code.

```
sage: print (1+
....:        1)
2
```

This sucks. There must be a global way to control this. There is one with the (MI)LP backend.
The last thing you want is that the underlying implementation changes SILENTLY.

given that there is no way to uninstall a package in Sage, one can get nuked by, say, a bug discovered in a backend... there must be a manual control over this, akin to default LP solver control.

Or, say, I want to compare two backends - do you tell me I must insert that `algorithm=...` in every freaking place, including the Sage library?! 

I'm not saying that installation of an extra backend must not flip this manual control - why not, it can do it.
