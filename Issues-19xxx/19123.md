This patch adds a function `is_vertically_decomposable` to finite lattices.

For testing see https://oeis.org/A058800 ; for example

```
sum([1 for L in Posets(6) if L.is_lattice() and
 not LatticePoset(L).is_vertically_decomposable()])
```

returns 7 as it should.

There is a place for possible optimization: If there is, say, covering relations `bottom -> 5`, `3 -> 8` and `7 -> top`, is suffices to show that the lattice is not vertically decomposable. This might be faster on average. Now the complexity is linear to number of covering relations.

How should it be defined on non-connected posets? And I am not sure if this works with non-bounded posets; I thinked about bounded ones when writing this.

Arghs! You are right, of course. I forget the special case when writing the code. I'll correct it.

(Btw, this would be nice exercise of (totally unneeded) optimization. One should not need to look for all edged of Hasse diagram to see that a poset is indecomposable.)

OK. What should be the name of the argument? `certificate`? `give_me_the_list=True`?

Except for the 2-element lattice there is one simple definition that generalizes this:

```
any(P.cover_relations_graph().is_cut_vertex(e) for e in P)
```

But in any case, it is easy to move this to posets later if we want so.

If the poset has coverings `2 -> 6` and `4 -> 9`, then no element `3..8` can be a decomposition element. After founding, say, `2 -> 6` we could check `5 ->`, `4 ->` and so on. But after founding `4 -> 9` we should have a somewhat complicated stack to skip re-checking biggest covers of `4` and `5`.

Isn't there a terminology for those points? If it is only for lattices, maybe you could have `return_cutvertices=True` or something?

Wouldn't work for a poset on three elements, one being greater than the two others (which are incomparable).

> If the poset has coverings `2 -> 6` and `4 -> 9`, then no element `3..8` can be a decomposition element. After founding, say, `2 -> 6` we could check `5 ->`, `4 ->` and so on.

You don't have to write this algorithm twice to make it work in all situations. Once is enough. And if you are worried of the cost of a 'if' inside of the loop, then you should not be writing Python code.

Furthermore, be careful with '::' as they are not needed after an INPUT block. Build the doc to check it.

Now it should work with empty lattice, 1-element lattice and 2-element lattice. There is backend ready for extending the function in `lattices.py`. I may modify it as suggested by Nathann at comment 9. But the more important question:

How should we exactly define "decomposing elements"? Let's start with

```
Posets.ChainPoset(2).ordinal_sum(Posets.BooleanLattice(3), labels='integers')
```

Is `0` a decomposing element? What are "components" for the lattice? Maybe `0-1`, `1-2` and `2-9`. But then, what are components of 2-element lattice?

I dont' mean that. If the lattice has `100` elements, then `0` is the bottom and `99` is the top. If the lattice has coverings `0 -> 37`, `34 -> 88` and `77 -> 99`, then it is not vertically decomposable. There might be faster way to find those coverings than going throught all elements. But the code would be much more complicated.

Duh. Counting Finite Lattices by Heitzig and Reinhold defines it "- - contains an element which is neither the greatest not the least element of L but comparable to every element of L." On the other hand, On the number of distributive lattices by Erné and (same) Heitzig and Reinhold says "- - if it is either a singleton or the vertical sum of two nonempty posets - -", and vertical sum on two two-element lattice by their definition is the two-element lattice.

I select tscrim as another random victim. Travis, should we define the two-element lattice to be vertically decomposable or indecomposable?

(Or raise `OtherError("developers don't know how to define this")`? `:=)`)

But they are different things. "Internal" function in `hasse_diagram.py` has only one yes/no -argument, so a Boolean seems right. "Interface" function in `lattices.py` has three possible inputs.

> But they are different things. "Internal" function in `hasse_diagram.py` has only one yes/no -argument, so a Boolean seems right. "Interface" function in `lattices.py` has three possible inputs.


Sorry, I removed my comment on the argument's type right after I posted it, it was a mistake. The one I left, however, is about the fact that the argument that appears in the doc is not the one that appears in the function's definition.

I split the function to two parts. I will also wait if somebody comments this on sage-devel. I don't know what should be the name of argument for `vertical_decomposition()`.

So this is open for comments and *de facto* ready for review, but not *de iure* in needs_review -phase.

    "body": "<a id='comment:33'></a>\nJori,\n\nI thought a bit before answering your email, because the reason I had not done\nanything on the ticket during the last 6 days is that I had chosen to not work\non it anymore. I do not often \"forget\" things like tickets in needs_review: my\nmail inbox contains all the things I must attend to, and they all remain there\nuntil I do what I think I should do with them.\n\nAmong the reasons that led me there is that nothing specific makes your code\ninvalid, and I have no reason to ask you to change it just because it does not\nsuit my taste. I like things short, simple, concise. Three functions for only\none feature is beyond me, it angers me by itself.\n\nIf I were to write it, you would have one Lattice method which would directly\nwork on the hasse diagram, with a `return_recomposition` boolean flag to return\nlists instead of boolean answers. One function, 20 lines, end of the story.\n\nRight now, the Lattice method `vertical_decomposition` contains around 20 lines\nof code, none of which has the slightest interest to me.

Jori,

I thought a bit before answering your email, because the reason I had not done
anything on the ticket during the last 6 days is that I had chosen to not work
on it anymore. I do not often "forget" things like tickets in needs_review: my
mail inbox contains all the things I must attend to, and they all remain there
until I do what I think I should do with them.

Among the reasons that led me there is that nothing specific makes your code
invalid, and I have no reason to ask you to change it just because it does not
suit my taste. I like things short, simple, concise. Three functions for only
one feature is beyond me, it angers me by itself.

If I were to write it, you would have one Lattice method which would directly
work on the hasse diagram, with a `return_recomposition` boolean flag to return
lists instead of boolean answers. One function, 20 lines, end of the story.

Right now, the Lattice method `vertical_decomposition` contains around 20 lines
of code, none of which has the slightest interest to me. It's just wrapping
things into other things, and testing things that are already tested elsewhere.

What I know, however, is that it is impossible for you to get any kind of code
into Sage and to work with it unless you have somebody to review your code. I
surely know that. Depending on what I work on, depending on the times, it is
either easy or hard to get anything in there, and from time to time I think that
it would be better if you were allowed to put any code that you like into Sage
without needing reviewers like me who drag their feet at every occasion.

Also, I admit that I do not have the energy to discuss the implementation
details endlessly, and I also hate that this process may require you to
implement code only because the only reviewer you have has a different taste.

Truth is, I don't want to be the reason why you cannot work properly on Sage's
code, and I don't have a lot of ways out as not many would do the reviewing job
otherwise. So I will try this: I will implement this as is the most natural to
me, and you can feel free to not use it if you do not like it. Let's see how it
works.

Sorry for the painful reviews.

Nathann

P.S.: the code is at u/ncohen/19123

Documentation part (i.e. index of functions) done in #19854, so this one needs work.

Also this should be thinked about. There is also #19659 waiting, and in principle it is same thing as this one; a poset that is also a lattice can be expressed as an ordinal sum of two posets only if it vertically decomposable. At least http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/papers/posets.pdf by Brinkmann and McKay uses term "vertically decomposable" with non-lattice posets.

(Actually after #19659 it is easy to make a simple function for #19215, and then use it as a "precompiler" for #14126. But that's another story.)

Minor grammatical corrections:

* In `vertical_decomposition()`, 'Let `d_1, \ldots , d_n` be elements comparable to every element of the lattice, excluding the top and bottom elements.' Should be rephrased as 'Let `d_1, \ldots, d_n` be elements (excluding the top and bottom elements) comparable to every element of the lattice.' The original version makes it sound like the top and bottom elements are being excluded from the set of things that `d_1...d_n` need to be comparable to, instead of being excluded from the set `d_1...d_n` itself.


* Immediately following that, 'Let `b` be THE bottom element and `t` be the top element.'

* 'Informally said, this returns the lattice SPLIT INTO parts AT every single-element "cutting point".'

* Under `INPUT:`, 'return the list OF decomposing elements'.

* In the definition of `is_vertically_decomposable()`, 'A lattice is vertically decomposable if it has an element that is comparable to all elements and is NEITHER the bottom NOR the top element.'

Besides that, I think I'm happy with it. I'll just need to check the rendered documentation once those changes are made.
