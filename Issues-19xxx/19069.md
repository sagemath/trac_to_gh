In #19027 matroid union, sum, partition are implemented, but most are not made discoverable by end users. I propose the following two ways of doing that:

* add import statements to sage/matroids/advanced.py
* create a new "submenu" matroids.constructions (similar to matroids.named_matroids) for these and future other constructions. So we could do

```
sage: M = matroids.constructions.Union([M1, M2])
```

Let me suggest also the following standard syntax:

```
sage: M = M1.union(M2)
```

To do this, just create a `union` method for matroids. The benefits is that, after creating a matroid `M1`, the user can see all available features by typing `M1.<TAB>`.

Yes, I forgot the `self`.

The reason we need the `_union` method (Stefan helped me figure this out) is that "union" is a reserved keyword for Cython, so `cpdef union` gives the following error when compiling:

```
Error compiling Cython file:
------------------------------------------------------------
...
            Ternary matroid of rank 3 on 7 elements, type 0-
        """
        from . import union_matroid
        return union_matroid.MatroidUnion(matroids)

    cpdef union(self, matroids):
              ^
------------------------------------------------------------

sage/matroids/matroid.pyx:7747:15: Expected an identifier
```

So instead we make `def union` sanitize the input and pass it to `cpdef _union`.

I don't claim to know the benefit of using Cython when all it does is pass the input to another Cython method. I just know it works the way I had intended it now.

Perhaps I should change it back to just Python?

However, you are going to have to do a number of Python calls when constructing the `MatroidUnion`, so having an extra Python function call for a lightweight function will not really change much. Especially since this is not likely to be called in tight loops and if you really wanted the most speed, you would just directly construct `MatriodUnion` anyways. So there should only be a Python `def union` IMO.

I think I have come around to Travis' point of view. Only a "def union" will do for this one. Sorry for making you do extra work.

That will teach me to make a commit before testing it.

I'm not getting expected behavior with `M.union([])` where `M` is a matroid (in particular, I used the Fano).

You can also fool this with a list of empty matroids. I can make it take empty matroids out of the list, but we may be getting diminishing returns with the sanitizing.

Replying to [zgershkoff](#comment%3A23):
> I'm not getting expected behavior with `M.union([])`

Sorry, this was wrong. An error on my part.

I rewrote it to filter out empty matroids from a list. I also figured that the cost of adding an empty matroid to the list and then removing it was worth the simplicity of not performing the same check twice.

One last thing, we don't typically write error messages as full sentences:

```diff
-                    raise TypeError("Can only take the union with a "
-                                     + "matroid or list of matroids.")
+                    raise TypeError("can only take the union with a "
+                                     + "matroid or list of matroids")
```
Once you make that change and add your real name to the authors, you can set a positive review on my behalf.
