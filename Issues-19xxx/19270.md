None of the matrices have a `gap` method.

The code is assuming that the input are elements of `G`; so it is bad input. However, to make things more robust and better behaved, I would make this change (the cost of the coercion call should be minimal):

```diff
-generators = [ g if isinstance(g, GapElement) else g.gap()
+generators = [ g if isinstance(g, GapElement) else self(g).gap()
                for g in generators ]
```
