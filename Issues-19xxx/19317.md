```

You can add a commit if you prefer. I admit that I prefer it the way it is written, as you can explain the construction a bit better than just "some orbit will work". I don't mind either way.

"some orbit will work", as it is a rank 3 permutation representation of `M_{24}`.
You can refer to Conway et al. Atlas of Finite Group. It was certainly well-known long before the reference you provide.

It's also mind-boggling the way it is given, that it works. In fact, it's a property of the extended Golay code (i.e. `sage.coding.code_constructions.ExtendedBinaryGolayCode()`), that it only has words of length 0,8,12,16, and 24), so you can relate the graph vertices to certain 1288 partitions of the 24-set into 12+12, with `M_{24}` acting in the natural way (`onSetsSets` ?).

You work with the shorter (length 23) code, on which `M_{24}` acts as a linear group, so this is less transparent.
