I have tested the whole Sage library, and it works perfectly. Indeed, I have no idea why I used pointers in the first place: maybe it was an attempt to solve a bug, that later I did not undo.

For me, this patch is good to go, if the bot agrees (it seems that the startup time is not fine). Let me know if you solve this problem, and I will set it to positive review.

As always, the patchbot results have to be human-interpreted. Here one the patchbots does not complain about startup time, so there is no real problem.

The startup plugin is doing some statistics on the startup time, and this is rather flaky. So a failure of this plugin should rather be taken as "please check twice if you do not do something bad involving the startup time", IMHO.

Would it be possible to reduce the amount of 'false positive', by only reporting the test if we have more certitude that something was slowed down?

One doesn't look at a warning which is raised too often uselessly.
