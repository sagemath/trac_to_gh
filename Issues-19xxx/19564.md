For me, this patch is good to go, if the bot agrees (it seems that the startup time is not fine). Let me know if you solve this problem, and I will set it to positive review.

The startup plugin is doing some statistics on the startup time, and this is rather flaky. So a failure of this plugin should rather be taken as "please check twice if you do not do something bad involving the startup time", IMHO.
