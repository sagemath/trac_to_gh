In [#18546](http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18546#comment:21), a bug in mpir only affecting 32 bit machines was described.

```
 #include "mpir.h"

int main()
{

    mpz_t one, x, w;
    mpz_init(one);
    mpz_init(x);
    mpz_init(w);

    mpz_tdiv_q(w, one, x);
    gmp_printf("%Zd\n", w);

}
```
outputs 1568892406419848332919986945754866320479099155002496784035 instead of the correct 1568892403497558507879962225846103176600476845510570267609.

Here is a patch that adds a test to mpir's test suite and then patches all `gmp-mparam.h` files for the `x86` architecture as proposed in [#18546](http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18546#comment:23).

I hope that one day, the problem will be solved in mpir and we can remove these patches.

For testing, you might want to first check out commit f1b4dff and run `sage -i -f -c mpir` (or `sage -p -c mpir` in more recent versions) to see the test failing on x86. Then checking out this branch fully, the problem should disappear.

Are we sure that we want to change the parameter on *all* architectures?

Not ad hoc, otherwise I would have been more precise... ;-)

FWIW, `__i386__` is slightly *compiler*-dependent, so would suffice for our purpose (i.e., GCC).

Since most of the architecture-specific stuff is managed via different files and symlinks to them created by `configure`, there's no straight-forward "MPIR equivalent".

We could use `defined(__i386__) || defined(__i386)` (the latter is used by at least M$), and probably to be triple-safe also check whether `GMP_LIMB_BITS` is really 32 (I vaguely remember *some*<sup>TM</sup> ill compiler used to define *both* `__i386__` *and* `__x86_64__` on x86_64, but I'm not sure).

I don't think it really matters as long as our fix works for the architectures supported by Sage, as we're not going to submit the patch upstream.

Are you sure that you **don't** want to change the parameter on *all* architectures? Why do you think that this bug affects *only* i386?

Exactly, and I saw no indication at all in William Hart's comments that this bug happens only on i386. His post talks about "32 bit machines" in general.
