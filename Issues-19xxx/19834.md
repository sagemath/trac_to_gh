For the sake of representation: should there be two separate functions, say `stieltjes(n)` and `generalized_stieltjes(n, a)` represented as `\gamma_n` and `\gamma_n(a)`, respectively?

Of course, like `stieltjes(0)` should return `euler_gamma`, `generalized_stieltjes(n, 1)` should return `stieltjes(n)` -- but I think this can be done easily, either still in pynac, or after registering the function in sage.
