Fix this:

```
sage -t --warn-long 27.7 src/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_sequence.py
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_sequence.py", line 1381, in sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_sequence.PolynomialSequence_gf2.solve
Failed example:
    sol = S.solve(algorithm='sat'); sol  # optional - cryptominisat
Expected nothing
Got:
    [{y: 1, z: 0, x: 0}]
**********************************************************************
