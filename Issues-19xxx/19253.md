A digraph is semi-complete if for any pair of vertices u and v, it has at least one edge of uv and vu. Such digraphs have been used in the study of directed pathwidth and cutwidth [1].

Surprizingly, we had no complete digraph generator. This is now done.

<a id='comment:2'></a>I have named the the comple digraph generator `CompleteDiGraph` since we have `CompleteGraph`.
For `RandomSemiCompleteDiGraph`, we may decide to remove `DiGraph`. Let me know.

<a id='comment:3'></a>Hello David,

Could you add seealso links between your two functions and `RandomTournament`? I can imagine that somebody who is looking for a random tournament may go straight to either of your two functions (and conversely).

Also, I am surprised that you need to distinguish the case `n=0` in `RandomSemiCompleteDigraph`. Is that really necessary?

About the final `*DiGraph`: it is really stupid that graphs end in `...Graph` and digraphs does not, but until we decide to change that let's stick to the most local standard. Could you remove it please? `:-/`

Lastly, could you document in `RandomSemiCompleteDiGraph` how the edges will be distributed, i.e. explicit that you each of `uv,vu,(uv+vu)` is equally likely?


Thanks,

Nathann

<a id='comment:6'></a>Hello again,

It seems that the documentation of RandomSemiComplete is not displayed as intended. Sphinx does not like it when one mixes italic and latex formulas. Also, the seealso section usually appears before the tests.

Could you also move the entry of RandomSemiComplete one line above, i.e. next to the other random graph generators?
