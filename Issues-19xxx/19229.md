sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2-x+1)
sage: E = EllipticCurve([a+1,1,1,0,0])
sage: C = E.isogeny_class()
...
ValueError: 0 is not prime.
```
is caused by

```
sage: from sage.schemes.elliptic_curves.isogeny_class import possible_isogeny_degrees
sage: possible_isogeny_degrees(E)                                                                      
[0]
```
and in turn by

```
sage: EG = E.galois_representation()
sage: EG.reducible_primes()
[0]
```

According to the documentation for the last function it should return [0] if and only if E has CM, which is does not:

```
sage: E.has_cm()
False
sage: E.j_invariant().is_integral()
False
```
(CM curves certainly have integral j-invariant, so you don't need to trust the is_cm() method to believe that!)

Tracked down to {{{_semistable_reducible_primes()}} in line 801:

```
F = NumberField(y**2 - a, 'a')
```
where a is an integer, but then the code base-changes the base field to this field Q(sqrt(a)), and there is a problem since 'a' is the name of K's generator.  This causes a ValueError which is caught in the wrong place in lines 292-4:

```
        try:
            bad_primes = _semistable_reducible_primes(E)
        except ValueError:
            return [0]
```

I will fix this by putting in a test for CM much earlier (which did not exist when this code was written).  Also when constructing F we can make sure that the name of iots generator is not the same as that of K.

Appropriate doctests added here and in the docstring for E.isogeny_class().

What's the point of this "poor man's caching", why not use `cached_method`?

```diff
+        self._has_cm = E.has_cm()
+        self._has_rational_cm = E.has_rational_cm()
```

There seems to be an indentation problem with

```diff
+ # ramified primes
```

Funny spacing:

```diff
+ if E .has_bad_reduction(P):
```

No reason, but that is how it was, and this is a bug fix.

Obvious question: what is the performance impact of the earlier CM checks? It seems that the old code was careful to postpone CM checks.

All the methods where you added a check for CM should have a doctest for the case when there is no CM. Many don't have such a doctest.

Like I said before, this should be replaced by real caching (you implemented the caching, but forgot to remove this part):

```diff
+        self._has_cm = E.has_cm()
+        self._has_rational_cm = E.has_rational_cm()
```

I think this comment is not very clear:

```diff
+        # See #19229: can cause problems if this name is 'a' but it has to be something!
+        F = NumberField(y**2 - a, 'grnf_a')
```

I'll explain here and also make the comment clearer.  The original bug was only triggered when the base field already had 'a' as the name for its generator.  Here we need to construct a number field and so we need a name which must not be a name used before in a similar context.  So I cam up with such a name (I think grnfstands for "Galois Rep Number Field").

Improving the detection of CM would certainly be useful.

To know the failing doctest, you have to click on the patchbot icon (currently yellow with a question mark) at the top right of this page. 

Then click on the "shortlog" link of the next-to-last report by "poseidon" patchbot.

This is indeed a 6*6 matrix of numbers and a 6*6 matrix of lists.
