The `Jmol` menu is basically non-functional from the `Jupyter` notebook. To see this

```
./sage -n jupyter
```

```
In[1]: x, y = var('x y')
       plot3d(sin(pi*(x^2+y^2))/2,(x,-1,1),(y,-1,1))
```
and then right-click on the resulting jmol. The `Console` and `JavaScript` menu items do appear to function.

Keywords: jupyter, jmol
