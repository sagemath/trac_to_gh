The `Jmol` menu is basically non-functional from the `Jupyter` notebook. To see this

```
./sage -n jupyter
```

```
In[1]: x, y = var('x y')
       plot3d(sin(pi*(x^2+y^2))/2,(x,-1,1),(y,-1,1))
```
and then right-click on the resulting jmol. The `Console` and `JavaScript` menu items do appear to function.

**Keywords:** jupyter, jmol

The Jsmol iframe on jupyter uses only static assets (html, js) that are embedded in the notebook. Any functionality that requires jsmol to load additional stuff (like the menu) is not working.
