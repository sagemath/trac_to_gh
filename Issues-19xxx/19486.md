[This ask.sagemath question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/30291/modifying-x-axisy-axis-with-plotting/) sensibly points out that 

```
sage: plot(f,(x,a,b))
sage: plot(f,(a,b))
```
as syntax is not actually described at [the sage plot documentation](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/plotting/sage/plot/plot.html#sage.plot.plot.plot).  Might as well add this to the "input" section if not more prominently!
