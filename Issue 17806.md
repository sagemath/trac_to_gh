# Issue 17806: Support for HyperbolicPlane() in modform_hecketriangle

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jj

Original creation time: 2015-03-23 23:49:50

CC:  mraum vdelecroix

Keywords: hecke triangle hyperbolic

This ticket adds support for HyperbolicPlane() in modform_hecketriangle:
- Evaluation of elements at points of HyperbolicPlane()
- Action on points of HyperbolicPlane()
- Interpret Hecke triangle group elements as isometries

TODO:
- Improve the current enhancements...
- Limit the scope to the (one-dimensional) hyperbolic plane
- Maybe: Support more features of HyperbolicPlane(), improve interpretation of isometries
- Probably not / later: Support for relative number fields, hyperbolic fixed points

I will trust you that the math is sound (better if there is a quick reference I can check). Here is a technical review.

- You might want to consider implementing a `_act_on_` for the Hecke triangle group or `_acted_upon_` or `_get_action_` for the points of the hyperbolic plane.
- I believe this comment is done by `as_isometry`:
  {{{
        # TODO: Make it possible to interpret elements as isometries of the HyperbolicPlane
        #       and possibly use/implement actions using the HyperbolicPlane model
  }}}
- The name `as_isometry` is somewhat vague. Perhaps the more verbose `as_hyperbolic_plane_isometry`? Unless it is well-understood that this comes from isometries of the hyperbolic plane. You might also want to consider adding a second argument that takes a model of the hyperbolic plane (with the default being `'UHP'`).
- More of a side remark, the docstrings should be aligned as follows for better typesetting in the html/pdf documentation:
  {{{
INPUT:

- ``foo`` -- a really log docstring that wants to keep going should wrap
  around and start at the same first non-whitespace character after the
  bullet point object ``-``
  }}}
- Another side remark, I would make this change:
  {{{#!diff
-        It is possible to evaluate at points of ``HyperbolicPlane()``:
-
-        ::
+        It is possible to evaluate at points of ``HyperbolicPlane()``::
  }}}

Both of the side remarks do not need to be addressed for me to set this to a positive review.

The coercion framework does not extend actions via coercion, i.e., it does not automatically complete this diagram:

```
a ~~> X
 .
  .   |
   .  V
    .
      Y
```

where `~~>` is the action of `a` on `X` and `X -> Y` is a coercion. I think it should, but that is an issue for another ticket.

If you are done making additions, then you can set a positive review as everything else looks good to me.

Hi

Yes, I'm aware regarding actions & coercions. But the statement "p in CC" already takes care of that. I dont see a problem or did I miss something?

I'm glad to hear the ticket is ready for positive review. I won't make any changes anymore so you can set it to positive review. I don't think I'm supposed to set it myself (?).

Thanks for the review
Jonas

I think I misunderstood your comment in the code.

You could have as I said it was okay. However, I'll just do it now. Thanks for your work on this.
