# Issue 29869: sage.libs.ecl: Fix unicode handling

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30106

Original creator: mkoeppe

If we want to support Unicode variable names in `SR`, this will become a problem:


```
sage: from sage.libs.ecl import *
sage: u_symbol = EclObject('üî•')
sage: u_symbol
<repr(<sage.libs.ecl.EclObject at 0x337e7b3c8>) failed: UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0x94 in position 2: invalid start byte>
```


Also note:

```
sage: b_symbol = EclObject(bytes([166]))
sage: b_symbol
<repr(<sage.libs.ecl.EclObject at 0x337e7b058>) failed: UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xa6 in position 0: invalid start byte>
```

Not sure if there is a function in the ECL C API that constructs a Unicode Lisp string.
So I would just be going through `CODE-CHAR` as in

```
sage: ecl_eval('''(type-of (map 'string #'code-char '(128293))))''')
<ECL: (SIMPLE-ARRAY CHARACTER (1))>
```

Now

```
sage: SR.var('œÄ', domain='real')
œÄ
```

but more work is needed.

sage: clock(3).python()
'"üïí"'

Thank you for solving this.

Should our Maxima interface support unicode with this branch now, or do you know what else is needed to make this work? The following used to give an error, but results in a crash now:


```
sage: var('Œæ')._maxima_()

Condition of type: SIMPLE-ERROR
Cannot coerce string Cannot coerce string $_SAGE_VAR_Œæ to a base-string to a base-string
No restarts available.
...
Excessive debugger depth! Probable infinite recursion!
Quitting.
```


Also, please add a doctest for the new functionality.

Are you on ecl 20.4 ?

Yes, I can confirm this here. I'll look into this.

Sure, will do.

I'm still on 16.1.2.

I suggest we work on ecl 20.4, for uniformity


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2020-07-11 16:56:47

The above error is due to a bug in ECL 16.1.2:

```
> (princ-to-string 'Œæ)
"Œû"
> (setf local-table (copy-readtable nil))
> (setf (readtable-case local-table) :invert)
> :INVERT
> (let ((*readtable* local-table) (*print-case* :upcase)) (princ-to-string 'Œæ))
Cannot coerce string Œû to a base-string
```


I will try with the ECL upgrade now.

This bug is still present in ECL 20.4.24.  The above code is from Maxima's `PRINT-INVERT-CASE` function in `commac.lisp`.

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2020-07-11 19:12:46

Note that after commit ee97a6d, the test case from comment 17 now gives a proper error message, no longer a crash:

```
sage: var('Œæ')._maxima_()
....: 
<repr(<sage.interfaces.maxima_lib.MaximaLibElement at 0x32c1d4828>) failed: RuntimeError: ECL says: Cannot coerce string $_SAGE_VAR_Œæ to a base-string>
```

Fixing this ECL bug or working around it is outside of the scope of this ticket.

Comment by @mwageringel created at 2020-07-12 10:31:27

Ok, thanks for the fix. There is one more place where `ecl_string_to_python` should be used ‚Äì in `print_objects`:


```
sage: from sage.libs.ecl import *
sage: u_symbol = EclObject('üî•')
sage: print_objects()  # crashes
```


Moreover, the docstring of `ecl_eval` should be changed into a raw string, as the examples contain backslashes.

Once that is fixed, you can set a positive review on my behalf.
