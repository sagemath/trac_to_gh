Keywords: Polyhedron

The docstring of the `representative_point` method for a `Polyhedron` currently says:

`The point is chosen to be interior as far as possible.`

That statement might be misleading. The `representative_point` is an interior point if possible, but it is not as far in the interior as possible (in the sense of maximizing the distance to the boundary).

This ticket provides a less ambiguous description for the method.
