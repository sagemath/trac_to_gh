CryptoMiniSat is currently still in "legacy SPKG" format. We should move it to build/pkgs.

The branch is ticket-15674-cryptominisat which points to #15674 which aims to update CryptoMiniSat to a newer version. However, this is currently waiting for an upstream update. Hence, the transition to build/pkg was moved to its own ticket.

Almost no difference with the SPKG.txt and spkg-install contained  in the current .spkg file. Good to go !
