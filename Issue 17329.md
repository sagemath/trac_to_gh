Hello !

I modified the sentence a bit to mean that the lowest level of verbosity is 0, not 1. Is that okay for you ?

Actually, this is from the documentation of plot

```
   Sage currently ignores points that cannot be evaluated

      sage: set_verbose(-1)
      sage: plot(-x*log(x), (x,0,1))  # this works fine since the failed endpoint is just skipped.
      Graphics object consisting of 1 graphics primitive
      sage: set_verbose(0)
```

Note that verbosity is set to -1 and it DOES make a difference of suppressing annoying warnings. Perhaps it should be mentioned in this functions as well.

But at a quick glance the meaning of negative verbosity levels does not look very consistent.
