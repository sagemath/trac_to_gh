The last two changes are actually crucial: you need a `cd "$SAGE_ROOT"` before line 75 because otherwise, the working directory is wrong and the `if [ -d devel/sagenb ]` block doesn't execute.

I'll try to keep looking at this.

When I run this on OpenSolaris, I see lots of warning messages like

```

As far as I can tell, the only consequence of this is that the various symbolic links in local/lib end up with new modification times. If I'm right, we can ignore the warnings. The resulting binary seems to work just fine. What do you think?

Also, the verbose flag in `tar zcvf ...` is unneeded, in my opinion, although I guess it's nice to see some indication of progress while the tar.gz file is being created.

I haven't looked at the OpenSolaris issues, but in any case it's not a regression of this ticket.

Agree on removing the `tar v` flag, new patch needs review.
