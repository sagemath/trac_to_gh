# Issue 32551: Permanently get rid of bare except: statements

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32788

Original creator: tmonteil

Original creation time: 2021-10-28 17:37:14

CC:  @kliem ​frederichan vdelecroix

A while ago, `@`jdemeyer used to regularly take care of removing bare `except:` statements constantly introduced in Sage source code, se e.g. #27427, #14028, #11310, #21687, #24274.

The goal of this ticket (perhaps should it be a task ticket ?) is to take over the work without self-abnegation by:

- removing the existing bare `except:` statements.
- ensure that those will not be reintroduced by adding a dedicated plugin to the patchbot (i have code for it but it could only be merged once the exisiting bare `except:` statements are removed).

this should rather be done using the pycodestyle linter : code E722

https://pycodestyle.pycqa.org/en/latest/intro.html#error-codes

Comment by chapoton created at 2021-10-28 18:23:22

see #32680 and src/tox.ini


---

Comment by chapoton created at 2021-10-28 18:27:28

but in fact, I would like that the linters first turn both green before switching on the check for E722,

so, let us hope that #32757 will at last give us green linters..

Comment by chapoton created at 2021-10-28 18:28:20

another aim is to turn on E713 and E714, several recent tickets  move on that way : #32766

Out of curiosity, did the branch comes from a script ?


---

Comment by tmonteil created at 2021-10-28 19:30:57

After a diagonal view at the commit, the `except Exception:` in `src/sage/interfaces/polymake.py` is dubious, and seems to be a consequence of a `try:/except:` encompassing a pretty long list of tests, which is not recommended as it might mask bugs, see https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#programming-recommendations

Then i should stop developing for Sage given my extremely weak relative productivity in inspecting such issues.

I am trying to look at it, it seems that all indentation is shifted by one.


---

Comment by tmonteil created at 2021-10-28 21:50:38

I added 2 commits dealing with `giac.pyx` to your branch. The first commit only fixes bad indentation that made my editor crazy, the second one fixes most `try/except` statements (most of them seem just useless).

The last two remaining cases are related with some `pari_lock` and need to be explored.

Comment by @kliem created at 2021-10-29 13:08:09

I hope that makes any sense:

- Cleaned up the syntax.
- `pari_unlock` shouldn't haven been called like that, because we are in `sig_on ... sig_off` and one should not call python functions in that case: https://cysignals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/interrupt.html.
- `_wrap_gen(result)` doesn't belong in the `try ... except` block, because it has its own error handling (and if it was to raise an error, we would slip into the except block calling `sig_off` again.
- Use `finally` to call `sig_off` before exit.
- Apparently `giac` raises `RuntimeError` in case something goes wrong. So I used that.

Sure, I only touched the `__call__` function that made trouble here. And I didn't feel like we should keep two copies of the same function, if we modify it anyway. I thought it was entirely the same, but there is a tiny difference, which should be more apparent with the current version. I don't think we should work further on this then necessary.

I added E722 to `src/tox.ini` so that the second part of the ticked get fixed too (using tox as `@`chapoton suggested). Regarding [comment:7 comment 7], will the `pyx` be tested as well ? Otherwise, how to deal with them ?

Comment by chapoton created at 2021-10-31 06:38:22

Les fichiers pyx ne sont pas regardés par tox, il me semble. Tu peux ajouter un plugin au patchbot qui ne regarde que les fichiers pyx. Un mécanisme pour ca est en place dans le patchbot.

there seems to be something broken in polyhedron..

But not by our current ticket, this also appears in other reports of the same bot.

Indeed, I stopped the patchbot and will see if i can restart it cleanly.

Well, I would surely be interested in that bug. Looks like it's my code causing the problems...

Regarding `src/sage/geometry/polyhedron/base.py` there are serious doctesting issues in 32bit architectures as well.

there is at least one green patchbot. Good to go ?

I propose, as a strategy, to undo the changes in polymake interface and keep them for another ticket. This would also mean not to activate E722 here, but later.

Otherwise, somebody should stand up and fix now the polymake issues. I will not.

There first change was necessary, because it changed `polymake` to `polymake_expect`, which does not work for me at all.

I still get one failure and I'm really confused, that I get this and you don't:

The changes to `PolymakeElement` look nontrivial, so I would agree with the suggestion to defer them to a separate ticket.

... or just try the minimal change that changes `except:` to `except Exception:`

Changing status from needs_work to needs_review.

Comment by chapoton created at 2021-11-14 09:37:38

I have made a branch with only a minimal change to polymake file. And squashed all the commits into one single commit.

Can we please keep this commit.
Pexpect does not work in my case and importing `polymake_expect as polymake` is not a good idea in that case.

I think the comment should move before the code and not after:


```diff
-                rat_points.add(X(point)) # checks if this point lies on X or not
-            except:
+                rat_points.add(X(point))
+                # checks if this point lies on X or not
```


So instead we should have something as


```
                # checks if this point lies on X or not
                rat_points.add(X(point))
```

I do not see the benefit of such squashing, but i see the drawbacks: we get a mixed bomb of changes without understanding which change is done for which reason. For example, i split the changes on `giac.pyx` as follows in order to ease reviewing:


```
​bcdb620	#32788 : fix intentations for libs/giac/giac.pyx
​da3e437	#32788 : remove useless try/except statements in src/sage/libs/giac/giac.pyx
```


Similarly, it is important to have separate commits when you rename a file and modify it.

comment:54 is now fixed

concerning squashing, I thought it was a good idea to simplify the commit history. I agree this was maybe not a so good idea. If you think this matters enough to spend your time on that, please provide a better branch

I cherry-picked the relevant commits and merged with `9.5.beta6` so that `git diff trac/u/chapoton/except_fix_branch trac/u/tmonteil/except_fix_branch` leads to:



```diff

I am not sure if i have to revert that change.

Stalled in `needs_review` or `needs_info`; likely won't make it into Sage 9.5.

now correctly rebased, needs test by somebody having polymake


---

Comment by @mwageringel created at 2022-02-01 19:02:49

There are two polymake test failures (see below), but they are not related to this ticket, so are best dealt with in another ticket.

I am ready to set this ticket to positive, if someone could confirm that the new pycodestyle check still passes with 9.5 merged. Unfortunately, I have difficulties in running tox on my machine.

By the way, this ticket will also fix a random [doctest failure](https://patchbot.sagemath.org/log/33217/Linux/29~20.04.1-Ubuntu_SMP_Fri_Jan_14_00:32:30_UTC_2022/x86_64/5.13.0-27-generic/r640/2022-01-26%2017:49:49) in `coding/linear_code.py` which is due to an `AlarmInterrupt` being swallowed by a bare except.

Never mind. I have tried it on a different machine and `pycodestyle-minimal` passes, so I think this is good to go.

In `src/sage/libs/giac/giac.pyx`, docstring
indentation for `loadgiacgen` seems off.

I am happy to review it if anyone wants to change that, but I do not think it is necessary here.
