When using the Ford-Fulkerson method for edge_cut of an undirected weighted graph, the value of the minimum cut is correct, but sometimes the returned edge cut does not have that value.  The LP method for edge_cut does seem to always return the correct answer.

Below is a simplified example due to Doug McNeil.

```
sage: G = Graph([(0, 3, 1), (0, 4, 1), (1, 2, 1), (2, 3, 1), (2, 4, 1)])
sage: G.edge_cut(0,1,value_only=False,use_edge_labels=True)
[1, [(0, 3, 1), (1, 2, 1), (2, 3, 1)]]
sage: G.edge_cut(0,1,value_only=False,use_edge_labels=True,method='LP')
(1.0, [(1, 2)])
```

This bug can quite easily be fixed by replacing in the code the part:

```
g = self.copy()
for u,v,l in flow_graph.edge_iterator():
    if (not use_edge_labels or
        (weight(g.edge_label(u,v)) == weight(l))):
        g.delete_edge(u,v)
```

by:


```
g = self.copy()
for u,v,l in flow_graph.edge_iterator():
    g.add_edge(v, u)                         # <-- Added line
    if (not use_edge_labels or
        (weight(g.edge_label(u,v)) == weight(l))):
        g.delete_edge(u,v)
```

This is because the usual algorithms search for the vertices reachable by s in the residual graph. However, the original graph is not a residual graph, and thus the constructed graph "g" not as well, as it does not have to have all back-edges. Therefore, the partition of vertices is calculated incorrectly, and therefor the edges exhibiting the cut as well.

By the way it also fixes a "theoretical bug" : I am not sure that this code was meant to handle the situation where there is a cycle in the residual graph (I don't know if it ever happens). With this, no problem.

Thanks for the report ! Now this patch just needs a review before being merged into Sage.

Adding one line will show that everything is in order.
