# Issue 25057: Extending valuations in function fields does not work

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25294

Original creator: saraedum

Original creation time: 2018-05-05 00:40:23

CC:  swewers


```
sage: K.<x> = FunctionField(QQ)
sage: R.<y> = K[]
sage: L.<y> = K.extension(y^3 + 1/x^3*y + 2/x^4)
sage: v = K.valuation(x)
sage: v.extension(L)
ValueError: The valuation [ Gauss valuation induced by (x)-adic valuation, v(y) = 1/2 ] does not approximate a unique extension of (x)-adic valuation with respect to y^3 + x*y + 2*x^2
```

patchbot has found 6 pyflakes errors in the modified file

The pyflakes errors seem to be unrelated to this ticket..


---

Comment by chapoton created at 2018-05-15 06:19:02

Yes. But please fix them nevertheless.

chapoton: I created #25364 for this. Some of the things pyflakes complains about are non-trivial. I don't mind making this a dependency but I'd prefer not to mix unrelated issues and the code it complains about has not been touch by this ticket.

Otherwise, this ticket is now actually ready for review. The patchbot is happy and I am too.

Just fix the trivial ones, then.

I created a separate issues that needs review. I hope that's acceptable.

No worries. It's great that we have a linter now and it actually found a bug that I was not aware of :)
