The docstring for notebook has out of date information for the accounts option; see http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/c99e566a55c21ba5. The instructions for adding a user are now wrong, and don't mention that it's possible to use the notebook itself to add users.

Amazingly, still true.  Not something that has to be done in the notebook, it's updating `notebook?`.
