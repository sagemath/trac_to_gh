Integers are a more compact way of representing subsets with their bits. This should both decrease the memory usage to store elements and the speed due to using bit operations and nearly trivial hashing.

sage: %timeit hash(X)
33.6 ns ± 0.354 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10,000,000 loops each)

sage: s = tuple(list(t))
sage: Y = FrozenBitset(s)
sage: s is t

sage: Y is X
False
sage: %timeit s == t
28.3 ns ± 0.381 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10,000,000 loops each)
sage: %timeit X == Y
20.2 ns ± 0.215 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100,000,000 loops each)

I had to make a few tweaks to how elements were being constructed. I also made the `E.basis().keys().an_element()` behave as before.\n\nSome simple timings for multiplication:\n\n```\nsage: E.<a,b,c,d> = ExteriorAlgebra(QQ)\nsage: r = E.an_element(); r\nb*c + 2*a + 3*b + 1\nsage: %timeit r * r\n10.9 \u00b5s \u00b1 46.7 ns per loop (mean \u00b1 std. dev. of 7 runs, 100,000 loops each)\nsage: r = sum(E.basis())\nsage: %timeit r * r\n99 \u00b5s \u00b1 438 ns per loop (mean \u00b1 std. dev. of 7 runs, 10,000 loops each)\n\nsage: E = ExteriorAlgebra(QQ, 'x', 10)\nsage: r = sum(E.basis())\nsage: %timeit r * r\n179 ms \u00b1 939 \u00b5s per loop (mean \u00b1 std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)\n```\n\nversus before\n\n```\n11.1 \u00b5s \u00b1 42.2 ns per loop (mean \u00b1 std. dev. of 7 runs, 100,000 loops \n139 \u00b5s \u00b1 271 ns per loop (mean \u00b1 std. dev. of 7 runs, 10,000 loops each)\n\n931 ms \u00b1 5.76 ms per loop (mean \u00b1 std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)\n```\n\nSo we are seeing substantial gains when multiplying larger elements.

This should now pass all the doctests. The indexing set should be a `UniqueRepresentation`, which fixes an issue with comparisons. I had to make a few tweaks to how elements were being constructed. I also made the `E.basis().keys().an_element()` behave as before.

Some simple timings for multiplication:

```
sage: E.<a,b,c,d> = ExteriorAlgebra(QQ)
sage: r = E.an_element(); r
b*c + 2*a + 3*b + 1
sage: %timeit r * r
10.9 µs ± 46.7 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100,000 loops each)
sage: r = sum(E.basis())
sage: %timeit r * r
99 µs ± 438 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10,000 loops each)

sage: E = ExteriorAlgebra(QQ, 'x', 10)
sage: r = sum(E.basis())
sage: %timeit r * r
179 ms ± 939 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)
```

versus before

```
11.1 µs ± 42.2 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100,000 loops 
139 µs ± 271 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10,000 loops each)

931 ms ± 5.76 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)
```

So we are seeing substantial gains when multiplying larger elements. With the Cythonization of #34138, this then becomes

```
8.05 µs ± 91.9 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100,000 loops each)
73.4 µs ± 631 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10,000 loops each)

129 ms ± 1.04 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)
```

Is it easy to run timings for these computations in M2?

Here you go:


```
i1 : E = QQ[a..d, SkewCommutative=>true]

o1 = E

o1 : PolynomialRing, 4 skew commutative variables

i2 : r = b*c + 2*a + 3*b + 1;

i3 : time r*r;
     -- used 0.000222222 seconds

i4 : r = sum(flatten(entries(basis E)));

i5 : r

o5 = a*b*c*d + a*b*c + a*b*d + a*c*d + b*c*d + a*b + a*c + b*c + a*d + b*d + c*d + a + b + c + d + 1

o5 : E

i6 : time r*r;
     -- used 0.00095186 seconds

i7 : E = QQ[x_1..x_10, SkewCommutative=>true]

o7 = E

o7 : PolynomialRing, 10 skew commutative variables

i8 : r = sum(flatten(entries(basis E)));

i9 : time r*r;
     -- used 0.315753 seconds
