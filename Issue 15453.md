```

I've improved the speed slightly too:

```
sage: B = InfinityCrystalOfTableaux("C2")
sage: b = B(rows=[[1,1,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,-2,-2],[2,-2,-2,-2]])
sage: %timeit b.content()
10000 loops, best of 3: 13.6 us per loop
```

Before:

```
sage: %timeit b.content()
1000 loops, best of 3: 69.4 us per loop
```

If you're happy with my changes, then positive review.
