Could you remove the needless `)` (after `\binom{n+1}{2}`) from


```diff
`@``@` -6578,7 +6575,7 `@``@` class A000204(SloaneSequence):
 class A000217(SloaneSequence):
     def __init__(self):
         r"""
-        Triangular numbers: `a(n) = {n+1} \choose 2) = n(n+1)/2`.
+        Triangular numbers: `a(n) = \binom{n+1}{2}) = n(n+1)/2`.
 
         INPUT:
 
```

Not clear to me what the issue is. And the pdf doc builds fine for me.

I have tried to use a raw string for the doc. If this does not work, maybe the file should be declared utf8 ?

I still get a similar error like Volker, caused by changes in
_src/sage/matroids/basis_matroid.pyx_ and _src/sage/matroids/circuit_closures_matroid.pyx_.

I used pdflatex from TeX Live 2016.
