Changing component from PLEASE CHANGE to porting: Cygwin.

I put the definition of the generic filename extension in sage.misc.sageinspect, since its use is relevant for introspection. Tell me if there is a better place!

Ahem, I do not completely understand what the patch does (i'm new to sage/python);
Question: what are the consequences, e.g. for `init_libsingular()`
in `src/sage/libs/singular/singular.pyx`?

*snip*:

```
...
    for extension in ["so", "dylib", "dll"]:
        lib = os.environ['SAGE_LOCAL']+"/lib/libsingular."+extension
        if os.path.exists(lib):
            handle = dlopen(lib, RTLD_GLOBAL|RTLD_LAZY)
            break
...
```

Replying to [comment:8 jakobkroeker]:

Short answer: the code you show is fine, no need to change anything.

Long answer: shared libraries usually have the extension `.so` on unix-likes. So, some parts of sage's code assume that this is a universal extension, and use it for loading or doctesting purposes. This leads to problems on cygwin, where the extension is `.dll`. The patch fixes this code, replacing the universal `.so` with an extension depending on the platform (`.dll` on windows, `.so`anywhere else). Code that already considered the possibility of different extensions is fine.

There is yet another difference on MacOS, where the extension for shared libraries can be `.so` or `.dylib` -- this means that, in this case, there is no universal possible choice, so I picked `.so` since it is the most common in sage. In the case of libsingular, I don't know if it is built using `.so` or `.dylib` (and I don't have a Mac to test). If it is `.so`, one might consider using the patch to predict the correct extension, but in any case the current code works fine.

It's more subtle than that. On OS X, both `.so` and `.dylib` exist but with a different purpose: `.so` is meant for "loadable modules" to be opened at runtime by some `dlopen()` mechanism, which `.dylib` is for dynamic linking of libraries (linking done when a program a started). For example, Cython extensions would use `.so` but the libraries in `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib` would use `.dylib`.

On Linux, this difference simply doesn't exist.

I dislike the complete lack of documentation. Given that constants are hard to document, it's probably better to make it a function `def ..._extension()` (fill in the `...` to what this thing represents, `generic_so` doesn't mean much to me, see also [comment:10]).


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2015-04-22 20:16:22

Also: can you replace `F[-len(generic_so_extension):] == generic_so_extension` by `F.endswith(extension)`.

Converted `generic_so_extension` to a documented function `shared_lib_extension()`. It is a little bit silly to recompute it every time, but given its triviality and the fact that it should never be time-critical, I don't think caching it is useful.

I think all this

```
sage: from site import getsitepackages
sage: site_packages = getsitepackages()[0]
sage: from sage_setup.find import installed_files_by_module
sage: files_by_module = installed_files_by_module(site_packages)
sage: from sage.misc.sageinspect import shared_lib_extension
sage: files_by_module['sage.structure.sage_object'].pop().endswith(shared_lib_extension())
```

can be replaced by

```
sage: sage.structure.sage_object.__file__.endswith(shared_lib_extension())
```

Can you replace the terminology `shared_lib` by `loadable_module`. As I said, these are different on OS X and Cython modules are "loadable modules" and not "shared libraries" (the latter would have a `.dylib` extension on OS X).
