Cryptominisat accepts xor clauses but is currently not able to read DIMACS files with such clauses, see [this ask question](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/43603/usage-of-cryptominisat/).

Since some other solvers might accept xor clauses, the parsing of such clauses is done on the generic solver.

Could you add a test showing the error is correctly raised? Should the file also be closed when the error message is raised?

Also a little nitpick, but error messages (following Python conventions) do not start with a capital letter.

Done.

Note that i used `SatLP` to test the error message, but in #26330 i plan to let `SatLP` accept xor clauses, so hopefully #26334 and #26335 will be accepted before so that i can use `PicoSAT` (which does not accept xor clauses) instead.
