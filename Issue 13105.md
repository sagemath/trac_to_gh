As a part of #11731, transfer the code which does the factorization over `RealField` and `ComplexField` from `sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_element.Polynomial.factor()` to the corresponding classes.

The new code does not call `pari.set_real_precision()` anymore. According to the docstring it does not have an effect on the computation anyway.

This patch depends on #13274, which no longer applies to Sage 5.10.
