```

sage: S = G.farey_symbol()
sage: g1,g2 = S.generators()
sage: S.word_problem(g1^3 * g2^-2 * g1 * g2)

AssertionError: [1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2]
[ -5  12]   [  5 -12]
[-18  43]   [ 18 -43]
```

The two matrices above should be equal but differs by `-1`

I fixed the bug reported in the ticket. I have tested that it works for Gamma0, Gamma_1, and Gamma for levels up to 20, as well as for the group reported above. Below is the code that I used:

```
for N in range(1,20):
    print 'N = %s'%N
    for G in [Gamma0, Gamma1, Gamma]:
        GN = G(N)
        F = GN.farey_symbol()
        gens = F.generators()
        ngens = len(gens)
        for i in range(200):
            V = [ZZ.random_element(ngens) for _ in range(100)]
            g = prod([gens[V[i]] for i in range(len(V))])
            wd = F.word_problem(g, output = 'syllables')
            g1 = prod([gens[i].matrix()**a for i,a in wd])
            if  g.matrix() !=g1:
                print GN, V, g,g1
                assert 0
```


The reason for the bug was again in some discrepancies in sign that I was ignoring. I try hard to avoid doing the naive trick of keeping track of the matrix that the computed word represents (although this is precisely what the check=True flag does, which is enabled by default) and fixing the sign at the end.

Thanks for looking at it!

In `_get_minus_one` it would be good to have a doctest for each branch of the `if/else`. And looking at the code we really need a `multiplicative_order` on `SL2Z` elements (see #20373).

I have added more doctests. Also, after looking at #20373 I have improved the logic of the function.

In `_get_dict_of_gens` there is no need to create a variable `ans`. Moreover, are you sure it is now worth it to keep it? The following code is very fast

```
    gens_dict = {g:i+1 for i,g in enumerate(self.generators())}
```

I think that our time would be best used by performing tests to find bugs in the code. We can discuss about each line in the code if you that's what you want, but I will not modify it anymore unless there is a bug in it.

Everything is fine as well on some random subgroups obtained with

```
sage.modular.arithgroup.tests.random_odd_arithgroup
sage.modular.arithgroup.tests.random_even_arithgroup
```
