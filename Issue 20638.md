In this meta-ticket, I'm collecting tickets regarding lattice point counting and enumeration, relevant library interfaces, and its applications. 

Not promising to do any work on it! 
Discussions on this ticket are very welcome in the comments section.

 - #18029: speed up integral point enumeration
 - #18190: bindings to Latte
 - #18232: Support other LattE features: Ehrhart series, multivariate generating functions, integration, volume computation
 - #17920: Reimplement `IntegerLists` using `Polyhedron.integral_points()`
 - #13768: upgrade polymake to version 2.12-rc3
