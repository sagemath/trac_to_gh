# Issue 30056: bug in lawrence_extension

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30293

Original creator: @LaisRast

Keywords: polytope, lawrence_extension

The method `lawrence_extension` of Polyhedron does not work when the point at which we do the `lawrence_extension` has a different `base_ring` than the Polyhedron:


```
sage: polytopes.cube().lawrence_extension([5/2,0,0])
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: no conversion of this rational to integer
```


The bug was introduced in #27926.

```diff
-parent = self.parent().change_ring(self.base_ring(), ambient_dim = self.ambient_dim() +  1)
+parent = self.parent().base_extend(v, ambient_dim=self.ambient_dim() +  1)
```

I think this should to the job.

And this ticket shows again that we should test more methods.

This is the merge conflict, which has an obvious solution.


```diff
++<<<<<<< HEAD
 +            sage: TestSuite(id).run(skip=["_test_is_combinatorially_isomorphic", "_test_pyramid"])
++=======
+             sage: TestSuite(id).run(skip=["_test_is_combinatorially_isomorphic", "_test_lawrence"])
++>>>>>>> 1f00faa1c3... fix lawrence extension with base extension; add test method for lawrence construction
```
