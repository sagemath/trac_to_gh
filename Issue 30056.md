Keywords: polytope, lawrence_extension

The method `lawrence_extension` of Polyhedron does not work when the point at which we do the `lawrence_extension` has a different `base_ring` than the Polyhedron:


```
sage: polytopes.cube().lawrence_extension([5/2,0,0])
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: no conversion of this rational to integer
```


The bug was introduced in #27926.

+parent = self.parent().base_extend(v, ambient_dim=self.ambient_dim() +  1)

I think this should to the job.

And this ticket shows again that we should test more methods.
