must always return the current directory. On Cygwin, sometimes one gets NIL. One example is like this: say, a user John has Windows (domain) login name `John`, but Cygwin will create for him home directory "/home/john".
At this point, one might hit the [Win32 case-sensitivity weirdness](http://cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/using-specialnames.html#pathnames-casesensitive), and in particular installation scripts for Maxima spkg will fail in a subdirectory containing "/home/john". If one switches on case-sensitivity, as described in the link just cited, the problem goes away.

In a nutshell, while this remains unfixed, avoid building Sage in directories with names containing capitals. This was uncovered and mentioned [here](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/Gj3cbdcPqKo/h5Ln_9qH0yYJ).

Could this be related to #9167?

I've mentioned the uppercase path problem on the [CygwinPort](CygwinPort) page, just in case someone else wants to join the experience.

I think one cannot rule this out just by reading comments on #9167.
Note capitals (e.g. `SageUser`) in some paths mentioned there.

I decided not to use a an uppercase path this time, on the same machine, and didn't encounter any problems.  I won't have the chance to try #9167 until after the weekend, but at any rate that's a positive sign.

I think it would be ok to even put this in prereq for a first start (i.e. ban such paths at the start of a build), since Cygwin would not be a typical building platform, but rather one we would specially use to create binaries only.

Just for the report, the build I did recently on a 32 bits Windows 7 (Intel Atom something) took place in the home dir of a user with a capital first letter "/cygwin/home/Toto/sage-5.7" and I had no problems whatsoever.
It was even the more functional build I ever got so easily! (In part because I had no memory leaks on this machine.)

I'm pretty sure this is no longer an issue.  Lots has changed since this was first reported, and among other things Cygwin does not force your home directory to be lower-case.

I've never seen the problem either, though I do usually mount my Cygwin home directory to an all lower-case, no-space name.  So feel free to reopen if it recurs.
