The pari package is full of patches, some of which should have been proposed upstream, some of which break the ABI.

According to the discussion with the debian packager of pari (which is also upstream):
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=703116
the correct solution would be for sage to *add* what is needed to the sage library instead of patching upstream.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14346

Does this apply to the PARI library, or `gp`?

(Of course `gp` uses the PARI library, but *I think<sup>TM</sup>* the stand-alone `gp` wouldn't need patching for Sage.)

The commits used were from upstream, but the patch is **based** on those commits -- it's not just them. That means that the pari in sage is neither compatible with upstream's 2.5.3, nor with the upcoming 2.6.0.

So yes, we can hope that when sage will package pari 2.6.0, then it will stop forking pari and become compatible with something debian can package seriously.

It applies also to sage but the scale is a priori less than in a full distro. In the case of pari in particular, I don't think the list of dependencies (especially dependencies not in sage) affected by your change is very long (make that non existant until proven otherwise).

Backporting is standard practice, to gain a bugfix or a new feature which is only available in a later version.

The current situation is different : some modifications are backports, and some are new code.

The backported patches have their places in the pari spkg, but the new code should be in the sage library.

Ok, let's be explicit:

I claim putting new developments in a package is against standard packaging practice.

And I use the verb "break" because that's what will happen when sage will want to include the next pari version...

Honest question: why is "patch submitted upstream but upstream ignored it" so much better than "patch not submitted upstream"? Because the end result is the same.

I just checked and in PARI's git at least, it's just the same:

It is again a problem of confusion between sage-the-distribution and sage-the-software ; the current sage-the-software won't work with pari 2.5.4, because it depends on polredbest (at least).

This is a problem for debian ; see the discussion about my
[debian bug report](http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=703116).

I'm not sure pari 2.6 will be a solution real soon: I just tried to make a pari 2.6 spkg from an upstream snapshot (taking the current spkg and removing the patches) :
1. it compiled ok ;
2. eclib compiled ;
3. genus2reduction didn't compile (error: ‘arither1’ undeclared) ;
4. lcalc didn't compile (error: too few arguments to function ‘long int* ellinit(GEN, GEN, long int)');
