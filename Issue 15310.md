Using the new tikz feature, (see http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/12083) there is a problem when drawing polygons embedded in 3d. The error can be reproduced:


```
    sage: P = Polyhedron(vertices=[[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]])
    sage: P.ambient_dim()
    3
    sage: P.dim()
    2
    sage: PProj = P.projection()
    sage: PProj.polyhedron_ambient_dim
    3
    sage: PProj.dimension
    3
```


I believe PProj.dimension should be 2, not 3. Because of this, the tikz method misbehaves.

In this case, the function _init_from_3d(self, polyhedron) used for projection contains:


```
    assert polyhedron.ambient_dim() == 3, "Requires polyhedron in 3d"
    self.dimension = 3
    self._init_points(polyhedron)
```


I believe one should replace the second line by


```
    self.dimension = polyhedron.dim()
```

I uploaded a patch.

The problem is now solved and I added two examples to test the bug on back edges of 3d polytopes and the drawing of 2d-polytopes embedded in 3d.

On this patch, the examples of projections have to be solved... (tests do not pass)
