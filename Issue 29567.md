# Issue 29567: pycodestyle: fix graph.py

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29804

Original creator: dcoudert

Original creation time: 2020-06-05 08:34:01

The patchbot frequently reports some pycodestyle errors due to statements like
`if certificate: return Graph()`. We fix this in `graph.py`.
