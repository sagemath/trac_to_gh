I'll have a go at it, unless someone already (almost) fixed this.

I have trouble making a working updated `libgap`. Not the least due to obsolete instructions on how this is done... Any takers? Volker?

I've wasted a couple of hours on `libGAP`. If anyone wants to have a go at it, please do...

Replying to [comment:7 vbraun]:
> which instructions?

there is a place saying that you should run  `libGAP/spkg/make-spkg.sh`, which is certainly obsolete... 

perhaps this script should be updated or just removed.
