#28095 (Add `--enable-OPTIONALSPKG` options to `configure`) made it possible to build Sage and a number of optional packages in one pass.

To improve opportunities for build parallelization, we should make dependencies of optional packages more detailed and no longer depend on all standard packages.

This will also make it faster to test builds from scratch to a specific optional package.

Several optional packages that run their tests with the Sage doctester depend on `ipywidgets` when `SAGE_CHECK=yes`.
