Currently the Notebook produces a list of files it doesn't know how to handle at the bottom of cell output. Sometimes it would be useful to be able to grab the files that are rendered as well (e.g. see  http://groups.google.com/group/sage-newbie/browse_thread/thread/859e20cc33a29930 )

I would imagine a link at the very bottom that says "File list..." and links to the cell (where twisted will give a nice directory browser).
