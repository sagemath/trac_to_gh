Currently the Notebook produces a list of files it doesn't know how to handle at the bottom of cell output. Sometimes it would be useful to be able to grab the files that are rendered as well (e.g. see  http://groups.google.com/group/sage-newbie/browse_thread/thread/859e20cc33a29930 )

It would be very nice if somebody could actually propose what this would look like?  It could be annoying if every image has a big link next to it...
