# Issue 24863: Add DESTDIR support for gfan, lcalc, ratpoints, rubiks, symmetrica

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: embray

Original creation time: 2018-04-04 07:51:41

Updates several miscellaneous packages for #24024:

    * gfan
    * lcalc
    * ratpoints
    * rubiks
    * symmetrica

These packages don't specifically have anything in common here except for being standard packages with somewhat unusual custom install scripts, but that aren't particularly complicated either.

I believe this issue can reasonably be addressed for Sage 8.4.

Retargeting some of my tickets (somewhat optimistically for now).

Updated.  Would be nice to get some review on this so I don't have to rebase it again in another 9 months :)

is this normal (in ratpoints):
`"$SAGE_DESTDIR$SAGE_LOCAL"`
or should it be
`"$SAGE_DESTDIR_LOCAL"` ?

The latter is just a synonym for the former, so it's fine (I think last time I worked on this ticket the latter didn't exist yet).  I don't think it's worth changing unless otherwise modifying something else in the file.

for the sake of future grep search, please use the second form (nitpick)

otherwise, looks good to me. Once done, you can set to positive.

If that's what it'll take; might as well.
