As a follow-up to #21539, let's have `./configure --enable-silent-rules` make `make V=0` the default.
(See [Automake silent rules](https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/Automake-Silent-Rules.html#Automake-Silent-Rules))

I'm marking this as dependent on #21479 because that ticket introduces the `config.status`-generated file `sage-env-config`, which we'll need.

I'm not convinced this is a good idea. On some computers, it will build gcc for 45 minutes, and having no output printed to the screen for that long may look indistinguishable from the computer hanging.

To clarify, the default is the current verbose output.
With #21539, users type "make V=0" if they are tired of seeing the output.
With this ticket, users type "./configure --enable-silent-rules" once if they are tired of typing "V=0".

Okay, I misunderstood.

In that case, would it also be possible for `./configure --enable-silent-rules` to create a `Makefile` which is more silent than the one at #21539, and in particular which silences the lines `sage-logger -p 'sage-spkg PACKAGE' 'LOGFILE'`?

The Makefile rules are already flexible enough for that in #21539, using `$(AM_V_at)` instead of ``@`` (borrowed from automake). 

The present ticket would just set some defaults of Makefile variables. The rules won't have to change.

Setting new milestone based on a cursory review of ticket status, priority, and last modification date.
