CC:  @embray @jdemeyer @vbraun @seblabbe

As a follow-up to #21539, let's have `./configure --enable-silent-rules` make `make V=0` the default.
(See [Automake silent rules](https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/Automake-Silent-Rules.html#Automake-Silent-Rules))

I'm marking this as dependent on #21479 because that ticket introduces the `config.status`-generated file `sage-env-config`, which we'll need.

I'm not convinced this is a good idea. On some computers, it will build gcc for 45 minutes, and having no output printed to the screen for that long may look indistinguishable from the computer hanging.

```

To clarify, the default is the current verbose output.
With #21539, users type "make V=0" if they are tired of seeing the output.
With this ticket, users type "./configure --enable-silent-rules" once if they are tired of typing "V=0".

In that case, would it also be possible for `./configure --enable-silent-rules` to create a `Makefile` which is more silent than the one at #21539, and in particular which silences the lines `sage-logger -p 'sage-spkg PACKAGE' 'LOGFILE'`?

The Makefile rules are already flexible enough for that in #21539, using `$(AM_V_at)` instead of ``@`` (borrowed from automake). 

The present ticket would just set some defaults of Makefile variables. The rules won't have to change.
