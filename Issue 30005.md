# Issue 30005: Make ExtPowerFreeModule a quotient of TensorFreeModule

(split out from #30169)

We give `ExtPowerFreeModule` the additional structure of a quotient module of `TensorFreeModule`.

For degrees 0 and 1 (for which this class is not instantiated by `FiniteRankFreeModule.exterior_power`), taking the quotient is trivial but we still set it up as a quotient for didactical/uniformity/formal reasons.

Shouldn't #30251 be a dependency of this ticket?

Yes, I will rebase this branch on top of it.
