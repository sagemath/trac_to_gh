(split out from #30169)

We give `ExtPowerFreeModule` the additional structure of a quotient module of `TensorFreeModule`.

For degrees 0 and 1 (for which this class is not instantiated by `FiniteRankFreeModule.exterior_power`), taking the quotient is trivial but we still set it up as a quotient for didactical/uniformity/formal reasons.



Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30242
