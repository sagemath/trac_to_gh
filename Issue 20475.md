Is there a good way to silence these messages? I used to be able to run some Sage commands, then make changes in the Sage library, do `sage -br`, and rerun the same commands, while seeing both on the screen at the same time. Now `sage -br` prints many lines every time, and it's annoying to have to scroll back and forth. Same with `sage -btp ...`.
