# Issue 12024: Improve latex for quadratic fields

The latex generated for quadratic fields is unclear.

```
sage: Q = QuadraticField(7)
sage: latex(Q)
\Bold{Q}[\sqrt{7}]/(\sqrt{7}^{2} - 7)
```


Compare this with the latex generated for cyclotomic fields:

```
sage: C = CyclotomicField(7)
sage: latex(C)
\Bold{Q}(\zeta_{7})
```

Changing status from needs_review to positive_review.

I've looked at the code and compiled it. It seems the problem has been solved.

I do not want to change the positive review. But, is it more common the expresion \Bold{Q}[\sqrt{7}]? with brackets [] instead of parenthesis ().

This is also somehow more related with the Sage shortcut to construct some number fields by the command QQ[sqrt(7)].

Just commenting...

For me the notations Q(sqrt(7)) is more natural, it makes the smallest field which contains Q and sqrt(7). In this case we are lucky that Q(sqrt(7))=Q[sqrt(7)] (the right hand side is the smallest ring containing Q and sqrt(7)).
