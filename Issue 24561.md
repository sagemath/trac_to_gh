Do you have system mpir or gmp installed? If I install the libgmp-dev package (on Debian Unstable) 

```
make distclean  && make pycrypto
```
passes. If I don't have it installed then testing fails with:

```

With my patch, testing succeeds for me even if system libgmp-dev is not installed.

You are right. pycrypto does require GMP/MPIR. But since it links against it, it should be a real dependency (on the left of the `|` symbol) instead of an order-only dependency (on the right of the `|` symbol).

In the latest beta `sagetex` (even with my patch) is failing with

Dependencies updated for 8.4rc0:

Doing `make distclean && make sagetex` fails unless `kiwisolver`, `sympy`, `elliptic_curves` and `jmol` are installed.

`kiwisolver` should really get pulled in by `matplotlib`, not `sagetex`, so I've added it to `matplotlib`'s runtime dependencies (this got missed in #25702) and added to the rest to `sagetex`.

I tested with 8.4rc0 and confirmed that sagetex now builds with SAGE_CHECK=yes. I've also confirmed that adding any combination of three of the dependencies is not sufficient.
