# Issue 23975: Fresnel integrals

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24212

Original creator: rws

Original creation time: 2017-11-13 13:59:09

CC:  mforets

The SymPy-Sage interface raises an error because there are no Fresnel integral functions in Sage: 

```
integrate(sin(x^2), x, algorithm='sympy')
...
AttributeError: 

see:

sage: import sympy
sage: x = sympy.Symbol('x')
sage: sympy.integrate(sympy.sin(x^2), x)
3*sqrt(2)*sqrt(pi)*fresnels(sqrt(2)*x/sqrt(pi))*gamma(3/4)/(8*gamma(7/4))
```

They are holonomic so they should be in Sage.

This is a tentative implementation of sine Fresnel integral. The numerical evaluation relies on mpmath. I doubtedÂ about how to write the custom evaluation `_eval_` method. In fact I have two failing doctests. I expect:


```python
sage: fresnel_sin(0)
0
sage: fresnel_sin(x).subs(x==0)
0
```


whereas i get `fresnel_sin(0)` in both cases. Any hints?

Oh, and the `beta(...` --> `beta...` is because the missing parentheses were confusing my text editor, so that the entire file from that line on was shown as comments. I should remember to undo this change :)

Comment by rws created at 2017-11-20 09:56:03

Returning `None` (or just passing) in `_eval_` amounts to returning a held expression. `_evalf_` is only used for inexact arguments or `.n()`:

```
sage: fresnel_sin(0.)
0.000000000000000
sage: fresnel_sin(0).n()
0.000000000000000
```

For results to exact or symbolic arguments you need to implement them in `_eval_`.


---

Comment by rws created at 2017-11-20 14:27:52

You would just need to handle `0` and `oo` in `_eval_`, and handle oddness before it, i.e. `if arg.is_negative(): return -fresnel_sin(-arg)`.

Comment by mforets created at 2017-11-21 07:47:09

ok, that fixed the 0, oo and -oo evaluations. i added two new tests for the `I*oo` cases, but this is still wrong. since


```
sage: SR(I*oo).is_infinity()
True
```


probably i could use `x.is_real()` too.


---

Comment by rws created at 2017-11-21 08:30:10

You mean `unsigned_infinity`?


---

Comment by mforets created at 2017-11-21 09:24:25

i should relate `unsigned_infinity` to test if the argument is complex and infinite? the doc of `unsigned_infinity` is precarious:


```
sage: unsigned_infinity?
Type:           UnsignedInfinity
String form:    Infinity
File:           ~/Tools/sage-master/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/rings/infinity.py
Docstring:         Initialize "self".
Init docstring:    Initialize "self". 
```


i'm tempted to add a ticket to explain this object more.

Replying to [comment:9 mforets]:
> i should relate `unsigned_infinity` to test if the argument is complex and infinite? 

No, I was not sure what you had in mind. If you want to test if the argument is complex and infinite then do: `if arg.is_infinity() and not arg.is_real()`. Technically a False for `arg.is_real()` just means "I don't know" so you get `True` for `SR(unsigned_infinity).is_real()`, but the correct behaviour must wait until we have `is_complex()`. Just use `not arg.is_real()` for now.

oh, there's no conversion back to sage:


```
sage: fresnel_sin(x)._sympy_() # ok
fresnels(x)
sage: fresnel_sin(x)._sympy_()._sage_() # not working!
```

Indeed, thanks for noticing it!

Some patchbots reported an error `RuntimeError: cases argument not a sequence` happening with some random tests. This seems to me unrelated to this ticket, but maybe i'm wrong.


---

Comment by rws created at 2017-11-27 07:05:45

Indeed, the cases fail has nothing to do with this ticket. It's a bug that is rare and happens randomly (#24284).


---

Comment by rws created at 2017-11-28 07:30:33

Docs are looking good. The patchbot errors are unrelated so I would be positive. However, the derivative is missing and there is a typo in the docs: write `\operatorname{C}` not `\operatorname(C)` in the formula. Could you please add that?

The depended-on #24171 needs a patch so I'll squash it all, keeping authorship info correct.


---

Actually the fails are due to the blockers #24284 and #24378 but they are not reviewed yet.

I moved the code into `error.py` as the Fresnel integrals are related to error functions. This also makes it independent from other tickets.

`random_expr` is really interesting. It should be made easier to debug, and errors caught/not caught should be reviewed because `TypeError`s from ECL represent real bugs and `RuntimeError`s from Pynac should be rebranded in the Python layer. Also sometimes it takes really really long time. After that, someone should do a day-long run to catch any remaining problems.


---

Comment by rws created at 2017-12-24 06:59:03

The reason why the doctest fails is that, despite fixing the random seed, the functions and symbols picked by `random_expr` are different. This, at some point in the buildup of the expression, leads to the sub-expression `kronecker_delta(-0.6165326641917295 + 0.15117833554974136*I, e)` which immediately evaluates to `0`. The `0` progresses eventually into a denominator, causing the error. `random_expr` is not written to avoid such errors if they happen, nor does it avoid other exceptions thrown. The author of the doctest apparently just chose a random seed that happens to not throw errors.

Of course the actual bug is that `random_expr` changes behaviour when unrelated code is changed.

Quick question: do you want to change the test in `calculus.py`? In particular, do you still want to test that Sage handles the case when something in sympy gives something Sage doesn't know how to handle?

Comment by mforets created at 2018-06-06 02:29:41

Alright. I found this one:


```
sage: laplace(cos(-1/t), t, s, algorithm='sympy')
...
AttributeError: Unable to convert SymPy result (=meijerg(((), ()), ((-1/2, 0, 1/2), (0,)), s**2/16)/4) into Sage
```


(side note: i didn't read the syntax of sympy's meijerg function, but here is a quick comparison to [WA's answer](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=laplace(cos(-1%2Ft))&rawformassumption=%7B%22C%22,+%22t%22%7D+-%3E+%7B%22Variable%22%7D&rawformassumption=%7B%22FunClash%22,+%22laplace%22%7D+-%3E+%7B%22CalculateLaplaceTransform%22%7D))

When we have #17970 we'll likely convert the G expression to the Fresnel expression in Sage.
