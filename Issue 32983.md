# Issue 32983: SymmetricGroupAlgebra reference manual is confusingly ordered

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33220

Original creator: @darijgr

Original creation time: 2022-01-22 22:58:58

Keywords: sage-combinat, symmetric group algebra, documentation

https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/combinat/sage/combinat/symmetric_group_algebra.html

Isn't it strange that the first few pages of this site are devoted to Hecke algebras? Even I got confused; newbies will probably be even more confused. I'm not sure if sphinx has a feature for providing an ordering of classes in a doc; if not, maybe we should warn the reader about it at the top of the page, or create a table of contents.

Changing priority from major to minor.
