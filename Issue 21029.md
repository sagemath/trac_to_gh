Otherwise there are no problems, but I got an doctest error from `_color_by_label()` of `generic_graph.py`.

I guess that happens because of change at `src/sage/graphs/base/c_graph.pyx`, but of course the real problem is getting a list when we mathematically have a set. I suggest you change docstring to have some `in` statements (see for example test block of `is_dismantlable()` on `lattices.py`) or use `sorted()`. It is enought for a function starting with `_`.

(And I think that this is a real problem for example blocks on some functions.)
