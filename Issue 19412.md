# Issue 19412: pari polroots throws exception

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Keywords: pari, polynomials, roots

We've seen weird issues with pari.polroots before (e.g., #2418); this may be related. (Observed in Sage 6.9, on multiple platforms.)

```
sage: polRing.<x> = PolynomialRing(ZZ)
sage: j = (x+1)^2 * (x-1)^7 * (x^2-x+1)^5
sage: l = j.roots(CC)

Agreed that this is an upstream bug, but we may be able to avoid it simply by requesting more working precision:

```
? \p20
   realprecision = 38 significant digits (20 digits displayed)
? polroots((x+1)^2*(x-1)^7*(x^2-x+1)^5*1.0)
%4 = [-1.0000000000000000000 + 0.E-38*I, -1.0000000000000000000 + 0.E-38*I, 1.0000000000000000000 + 0.E-38*I, 1.0000000000000000000 + 0.E-38*I, 1.0000000000000000000 + 0.E-38*I, 1.0000000000000000000 + 0.E-38*I, 1.0000000000000000000 + 0.E-38*I, 1.0000000000000000000 + 0.E-38*I, 1.0000000000000000000 + 0.E-38*I, 0.50000000000000000000 - 0.86602540378443864676*I, 0.50000000000000000000 - 0.86602540378443864676*I, 0.50000000000000000000 - 0.86602540378443864676*I, 0.50000000000000000000 - 0.86602540378443864676*I, 0.50000000000000000000 - 0.86602540378443864676*I, 0.50000000000000000000 + 0.86602540378443864676*I, 0.50000000000000000000 + 0.86602540378443864676*I, 0.50000000000000000000 + 0.86602540378443864676*I, 0.50000000000000000000 + 0.86602540378443864676*I, 0.50000000000000000000 + 0.86602540378443864676*I]~

Karim Belabas reports that he has fixed this in the master development branch (see upstream link). Since there is an Atelier Pari/GP in January, I hope this makes it into a stable release shortly thereafter.

In Sage, we are using the development version of PARI anyway. I'll try upgrading PARI to the fixed version.

This compiled and passed all tests. However if you could shorten the output or break into multiple lines this doctest in `schemes/elliptic_curves/heegner.py`:

```
             sage: k = H.rational_kolyvagin_divisor(D, c); k  # long time (5s on sage.math, 2013)
-            (14, 16, 0, 0, ... 0, 0, 0)
+            (2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 16, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 9, 11, 0, 6, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0,...
```

Also, is the reason why the other doctest output changes in that file because the embeddings were negated?

To be honest, I did not check. I did notice that the doctest output is now reverted to what it was some earlier point in time. That's why I think it is safe.

Okay; positive review then.

PDF docs don't build

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2015-12-22 15:45:06

Confirmed. In fact, looking at the LaTeX, it's a miracle that they ever managed to build. All the backslashes in math are double-escaped (`\\subset` instead of `\subset`).
