Sorry, no. I've unfortunately found myself a bit busier this summer than I was expecting. Once I get back to the computer this is on I can upload the latest version if you want to take a look at it. If I recall, not much left is needed for the basic functionality -- I think the main things missing are implementing the appropriate coercions, and adding documentation + examples. At a later point other stuff could be added.

Oh, also related is #16428 -- I'll see about resolving the merge conflicts later tonight.

cc-ing some people who might be interested in this. Unfortunately I don't have time right now to get this ready (if it is still useful). `:/`

With #16567 some of this functionality is also handled by linsingular (although with a different point of view).
