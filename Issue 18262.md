It is undocumented that expressions containing series (that result from operations with them) can be "expanded" by applying `series` again.

```
sage: (1/(1-x)).series(x, 3)+(1/(1+x)).series(x,3)
(1 + (-1)*x + 1*x^2 + Order(x^3)) + (1 + 1*x + 1*x^2 + Order(x^3))
sage: _.series(x,3)
2 + 2*x^2 + Order(x^3)
sage: (1/(1-x)).series(x, 3)*(1/(1+x)).series(x,3)
(1 + (-1)*x + 1*x^2 + Order(x^3))*(1 + 1*x + 1*x^2 + Order(x^3))
sage: _.series(x,3)
1 + 1*x^2 + Order(x^3)
```
