The new Pynac version does:
* fix polylog evalf (Sage #18386)
* better beta_evalf() (Sage #15196)
* fix bug in cancelling of fractions (Sage #19775, #20843)
* fix some positive/nonnegative bugs
* do not ignore `_print_latex_()` in `GinacFunction`s (#20888)
* provide Pynac version of Maxima's `ex.coefficients()`
* provide Pynac version of Maxima's `ex.combine()`
* some fixes ported from GiNaC

How did you "pull in" the changes? BTW, if you do `git trac checkout 21034` you will always get the Sage version of the branch in 21034, regardless of your develop. Also a hint: `make start` will skip building the expensive step of building the docs.

You should also download the pynac tarball and copy it into `upstream/` before making.

Sorry Ralf, but still getting the error. Curiously even though it references "sagelib-7.3.beta5.log" this file hasn't been modified building either beta8 or beta9.

Before you ask, 7.3.beta9 develop also compiles cleanly on Mac OS X El Capitan.

Looking back to the pynac 0.6.7 upgrade, there is a [comment](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20742#comment:11) from Travis that looks relevant. This prompted me to see which beta included 0.6.7 and sure enough it was beta5.

1) The second plot in #18368 still throws an error. Have you modified the behavior of the zeta function in Pynac or just the polylog? If the latter, the doctest you included doesn't appear to address the problem with the zeta function on that ticket.

2) Numerical evaluation of the beta function looks good, so that fixes #15196. I have noticed however that evaluating the beta function at poles returns `NaN` rather than unsigned infinity. Is this something that needs to be addressed in Sage or Pynac?

3) The description of #20888 makes it sound like an existing LaTeX string in Pynac overrides one in Sage. Is that correct? If so, shouldn't entries in Sage always take precedence?

4) This ticket doesn't appear to change anything for #20455. Does that ticket need to be addressed in Sage using behavior now available from Pynac?

Will do more testing tomorrow. Thanks for putting up with my build issue.
