* Various show methods should maybe get moved to the SageObject class, or perhaps in some category.
* Similarly, in graphics.py, a bit of refactoring could be done by creating a common parent for Graphics and GraphicsArray (maybe something like GraphicsBase)
* show should be an alias for pretty_print, which should always tries to use a rich output for an object (falling back on the plain text), while the plain print function should always use the plain text for the object
* Find a better name for the viewer='...' keyword option that works also for plain text / latex / 2d animation formats / ...

One general question is how to handle multiple arguments: `pretty_print('integers = ', ZZ)` is supposed to give one latex string as output. After thinking about it, I think multiple arguments should always be string/latex/asciiart-ified. So no graphical output if you run `pretty_print('plot =', plot(sin))`.

Refactoring graphics is now #18033, already too much going on here.

This basically works now, except that it unearthed various broken stuff elsewhere that wasn't exercised before.

Will there be an option for inline/display formulas with this system?

Although it seems a little ugly to modify global preferences before output and restoring them afterwards - shouldn't there be some way to pass "current preferences" that take precedence over "default ones"?

To me it sounds a bit strange to `pretty_print` a plot or to `show` a formula, but I am not a native speaker. Although I don't see the point of having two names for the same functionality, so why not then stick to shorter `show` and drop `pretty_print`?

Use cases for inline equations:
- they are flushed left rather than centered, which makes a difference in combined output blocks
- they have (or had) different padding in notebook, so were more compact
- they are of course more compact because they use different LaTeX style
- they could continue the line after `print "Cool formula: ",`

So I think they definitely should be available as an option. Having `show/view` to pick the style was not cool, of course.

I guess we should use inline/text style if and only if there is adjacent stuff. So, for example,  `pretty_print(a, b)` should use inline style and `pretty_print(a); pretty_print(b)` should use block/display style.

> I guess we should use inline/text style if and only if there is adjacent stuff. So, for example,  `pretty_print(a, b)` should use inline style and `pretty_print(a); pretty_print(b)` should use block/display style. 

How do you decide? If I made some output with suppressed newline in one place and then do extra output in another, it is difficult to detect. Also, if my code outputs two formulas on two lines and one of them is long, it may not be good to use display style since the centered short formula may be off the screen without centering. On the other hand, I dislike inline fractions/sums/limits, so even side-by-side things may be better in displaystyle.

It seems to me that its better to have a single default (display is more natural), but have a simple way for the user to tweak things if desired without the need of constructing all LaTeX code manually.

OK - I am setting this to positive review on the basis of things looking reasonable and better than they used to. Hopefully with a merge in an early beta we will get enough people to try it and detect corner cases if there are any.

Okay guys. Now whenever I do `graphs.PetersenGraph()` in Sage I get a plot of it. Is it because of this ticket ?

Some graphs that I work with are much too large to be plotted. Just typing 'g' in the command line (as I often do to check the number of vertices) now runs an algorithm that I have to kill.

No Volker. The problem is not the speed. The problem is that this is not the desired behaviour of `__repr__`. Unless you want to do the same for everything in Sage and call .plot() on matrices, posets, crystals, i.e. everything that plots.

Please, set it back to its original behaviour.

Volker, please do not do this again. If you force me to accept this new behaviour for graphs, which is totally unpractical for whoever uses them, I will have to write to sage-devel again and it will be the same, over and over.
