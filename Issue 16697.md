The following sequence of commands somehow breaks the coercion framework. This is on vanilla Sage 6.4.beta1. The problem only occurs if `impl="pari_ffelt"` is explicitly given, even though that is the default:

```
sage: k.<a> = GF(17^14, impl="pari_ffelt")
sage: _ = EllipticCurve_from_j(a^584645231109031).cardinality()
sage: k.<a> = GF(17^14, impl="pari_ffelt")
sage: _ = EllipticCurve_from_j(a^584645231109031).cardinality()
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
[...]
TypeError: no coercion defined
```


Remark: the value `a^584645231109031` is chosen to lie in the subfield `GF(17^2)`, an elliptic curve over this field is created in the `cardinality()` call.

I don't claim to know what is going on, but it may be caused by equality and identity not being the same for finite fields; #16855 seems to fix this bug.

I would say either we close this as a duplicate of #16855, or we try to fix the other bug (comment:11:ticket:16855) here:

```
sage: k1.<a> = GF(17^14, impl="pari_ffelt")
sage: _ = a/2
sage: k2.<a> = GF(17^14, impl="pari_ffelt")
sage: k1 is k2
False

Please restore the warning

```
warn("the 'modulus' argument is ignored when constructing prime finite fields")
```

for all prime finite field implementations because the modulus really is ignored:

```
sage: x = polygen(GF(7)); GF(7, modulus=x-2, impl="givaro").modulus()
x + 6
```


Of course we could change that behaviour (perhaps we should), but let's do that on a new ticket.

I would prefer to have the warning in one place. If we ever allow a custom modulus, we should allow it for all implementations.

My vision for this "modulus" argument is that the following should assign to `a` a primitive root:

```
sage: K.<a> = GF(7, modulus='primitive')
```

so perhaps we should expand the warning to say

```
warn("currently, the 'modulus' argument is ignored when constructing prime finite fields. This might change in the future and this will probably also change the output of the .gen() and .modulus() methods on the finite field.\nSee http://trac.sagemath.org/16930 for details.")

The word "modulus" here is definitely wrong. If anything is a modulus for `GF(7)`, it is 7, because the natural way to construct `GF(7)` as *quotient* of `ZZ` by `7ZZ`.

In general, even for field *extensions*, the word modulus is confusing. That only applies if you're making the field as a quotient of a polynomial ring. For the purpose proposed, `generator` would cover the notion much better. I see from the doc that we have legacy against us on this one.
