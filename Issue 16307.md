It is not possible to compute the Euclidean division for generic sparse polynomials.

```python
sage: p=R.rsage: R.<x>=PolynomialRing(ZZ,sparse=True)
sage: p=R.random_element(10)
sage: q=R.random_element(5)
sage: p//q

I've implemented an Euclidean Division algorithm in the class `Polynomial_generic_sparse` objects that raises an  

```python
ArithmeticError: Nonunit leading coefficient
```

if the leading coefficient of the divisor is not invertible, as it is done in the class `Polynomial_generic_dense`. Also, if the divisor is zero, a

```python
ZeroDivisionError: Division by zero polynomial
```

is raised.

The error in the description of the ticket does not occur anymore:

```python
sage: R.<x>=PolynomialRing(ZZ,sparse=True)
sage: p=R.random_element(10)
sage: q=R.random_element(5)
sage: p//q
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ArithmeticError
...
ArithmeticError: Nonunit leading coefficient
sage: q += x^6
sage: p//q
x^4 + 4*x^3 - 14*x^2 + 6*x + 61
```


Needs review!

I'm somewhat surprised we didn't catch this earlier. LGTM, positive review.
