CC:  tscrim mkoeppe slelievre

We equip `structure/parent.pyx` with a method `__pow__` which delegates to a concrete implementation `_pow_`, for example in the corresponding category.

Moreover, we move the `__pow__` in `rings/ring.pyx` to the category file `categories/rings.py` so that any ring can benefit from it and not only those which inherit from `rings/ring.pyx`.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31721

The coercion framework works on `Element`s and finds common `Parent`s. Outright, it doesn't get involved. Instead, this is something Python does with trying by swapping the order of the two inputs.

I strongly dislike the `__pow__` implemented in the parent. It will override anything that can be done in a category. Category stuff is called lower in the MRO than an any concrete class. So it restricts any future parent implementation for no reason.

That being said, `Parent`s should *not* be implementing a `_pow_` because there is no reason to standardize input to the same object. It doesn't make sense.

I don't think the `_pow_int` in the `Fields` category is ever called. So it is good to remove it.

Same comment as in the other ticket about nailing categories into memory should be avoided and the changes to `free_module.py`.

I don't really like that explanation, as well as the text preceding the `ZZ` example. I would do something like this:

```
        This is a power method that directly calls another attribute
        ``_pow_`` (single underscore). This is because extension classes 
        cannot inherit ``__pow__`` from the the parent methods of the
        category and the redirection via ``__getattr__`` is not called
        from Python when performing ``**``. Subsequently, ``__pow__``
        cannot be inherited from the category but ``_pow_`` can.
        See :trac:`31721`.
```


```
        TESTS:

        We check that this works for extension classes::

            sage: ZZ^3
            Ambient free module of rank 3 over the principal ideal domain
             Integer Ring
            sage: isinstance(ZZ, Rings.ParentMethods)  # it is an extension class
            False
```

That's indeed something for another ticket. Who opens it?

For example? It's already more than in my first draft.

That doesn't necessarily mean it is sufficient. Perhaps something like:

```
Redirect ``__pow__`` either from the MRO or from the category. This
implementation is so extension classes will call the method from
the appropriate category.
```

That way it at least gives some reason for why this implementation exists.
