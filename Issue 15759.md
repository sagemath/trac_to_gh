Keywords: toric, weierstrass

Currently, one method in `sage.rings.invariant_theory` and another one in `sage.schemes.toric.weierstrass` make use of `__floordiv__`. More precisely, if p and m are elements in a ring R with base ring B, then one needs
`p // m`,
where `m` always has a unit coefficient. However, `__floordiv__` is only implemented if B is a field and therefore doing something like

```
sage: P.<a> = QQ[]
sage: R.<x,y,z> = P[]
sage: cubic = x^3 + a*y^3 + a^2*z^3
sage: WeierstrassForm(cubic)
```

does not work because

```
sage: cubic // x^3
```

fails. However, since the coefficients of `m` are always in `QQ`, we can work around that and I've written a short patch that does so.

It might not be very pretty (if someone has a nicer idea, that would be great), but it works and actually speeds up long calculations.

Best,
Jan

The floor division works in 6.2.beta5, possibly due to #13048:

```
sage: P.<a> = QQ[]
sage: R.<x,y,z> = P[]
sage: cubic = x^3 + a*y^3 + a^2*z^3
sage: cubic // x^3

Hi Volker,

without the patch, the following still does not work:


```
sage: P.<a,b> = QQ[]
sage: R.<x,y,z> = P[]
sage: cubic = x^3 + a*y^3 + a^2*z^3
sage: cubic // x^3
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

   1419                     ret += P.monomial_quotient(t, right, coeff=True)
   1420             return ret

Unfortunately, I don't know enough about the internals of (multivariate) rings in Sage. Is there a better cast than the one in #13048 that one could make to get this to work, too?

Best,
Jan

This description is way too vague to understand what `_fdiv` does:

```
def _fdiv(a, b):
    r"""
    Return a // b even if b is an element of a ring 
    whose base ring is not a field.

    This is just a helper function to allow divisions a // b
    for a and b elements of a ring over another ring.
    It works only if b has constant coefficients.
```
