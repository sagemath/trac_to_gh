Working on #11731, I realized that the docstring for factor() could also be cleaned up.

To make reviewing easier, I moved this to a separate ticket.

1. You can mention class functions in your patches by writing it as `:meth:`._factor_univariate_polynomial`` instead of writing that as ``_factor_univariate_polynomial()``. See this [dev doc](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/sage_manuals.html#chapter-sage-manuals-links) for more details.

Ok. If this was indeed intended, then I can of course revert these changes. I just had the feeling that the different constructors should not be tested in the `factor()` method. When I was new to sage I found such docstrings quite confusing because I wondered if these different constructors had any influence on the code that was actually demonstrated.
