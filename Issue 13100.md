# Issue 13100: clean up the factor() docstring/interface for univariate polynomials

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Working on #11731, I realized that the docstring for factor() could also be cleaned up.

To make reviewing easier, I moved this to a separate ticket.

remove proof keyword

I mostly tried to simplify the wording in some places and unify the way polynomial rings are constructed. I changed the example where `_factor_univariate_polynomial()` is replaced since adding factorization where none is present seemed more natural to me. I removed the test for `Test that this factorization really uses ``nffactor()`` internally` since it apparently did not test anything: PARI's debug output is sent to stderr so the doctests do not see it; since there is an empty line after the line `F = pol.factor()`, the doctests expected no output to stdout which is what actually happened.

Hello, some comments on your patches :)
1. You can mention class functions in your patches by writing it as `:meth:`._factor_univariate_polynomial`` instead of writing that as ``_factor_univariate_polynomial()``. See this [dev doc](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/sage_manuals.html#chapter-sage-manuals-links) for more details.
2. I don't understand why you made all the changes like the one below. I think all these forms of declarations test different ways of calling and/or declaring the rings or variables. Unless I am mistaken, it should be good to leave them alone. Maybe someone who knows the code better can comment.

```
-            sage: C = ComplexField(100)
-            sage: R.<x> = C[]
+
+            sage: R.<x> = ComplexField(100)[]
             sage: F = factor(x^2+3); F
```

Thanks for having a look at my patches.

That makes sense. I will change the docstrings accordingly.

Ok. If this was indeed intended, then I can of course revert these changes. I just had the feeling that the different constructors should not be tested in the `factor()` method. When I was new to sage I found such docstrings quite confusing because I wondered if these different constructors had any influence on the code that was actually demonstrated.

trac_13272_docstring.patch no longer applies correctly to Sage 5.10.rc1; can you rebase it?

Thanks for looking at these tickets. I'm building 5.10 now, will rebase the patch when this is done.

I rebased the patch. It might not apply anymore, since I rebased it against the git repository and used sagedev's export_patch to export it. I'm not sure if the patchbot cares about whitespace since that will most probably be incorrect.

Unfortunately the whitespace matters a lot:

trac_13272_proof.patch

In the meantime I did manage to rebase the first version of your patch, but even apart from whitespace the resulting patch has several differences with your new patch.

Could you post the rebased patch?

Sorry for bothering you with this but I don't have mercurial sage anymore. I started a thread on sage-git to find out if there is any way to make hg ignore whitespace.

applies to 5.10.rc2, but differs non-trivially from trac_13272_docstring.patch

I tried to find out if hg_sage.qpush() has an option similar to patch --ignore--whitespace, but no luck so far.

Please don't ignore whitespace and fuzz. It can lead to patches being inserted in the wrong place in the file.

I see your point. However, I think it could help a lot with the testing of the sage-git tools, if one could move patches between these two worlds somehow. It's probably better to move this discussion to https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/sage-git/eCPmLRqHR0s

After the switch to Git, I thought it was a good time to come back to this ticket (and the others related to #11731).  I converted the two patches into a branch based on Sage 6.0 (to be pushed shortly).  I omitted most of the changes in the polynomial constructors (see comment:3) and did not delete the `nffactor()` test (see comment:1; it does see the `stderr` output).  Furthermore, I made a few small cosmetic fixes.  If you are happy with this version, feel free to set it to positive review.
