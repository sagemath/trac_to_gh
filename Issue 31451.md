Similar to #31653, given a continuous map `\Phi: N -> M` and a manifold subset `S` of `M`, we define the pullback (preimage) of `S` as the subset of `N` of points `p` with `\Phi(p)` in `S`.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31688

Thanks for the last changes. 
Some comments regarding the documentation:

- there is no entry for the class `ManifoldSubsetPullback` in the reference manual
- in the files `continuous_map.py` and `subsets/pullback.py`, each instance of `:class:`ManifoldSubset`` should be replaced by `:class:`~sage.manifolds.subset.ManifoldSubset``
- the docstring of `ScalarField.pullback` should have an INPUT and OUTPUT sections similar to those of `ContinuousMap.preimage`. By the way, to be consistent with `ContinuousMap.preimage`, shouldn't `ScalarField.pullback` be renamed to `ScalarField.preimage`, with `pullback` defined as an alias to `preimage`?
- the INPUT and OUTPUT sections of `DiffMap.pullback` should be updated to take into account the new arguments.

In the docstring of  `ManifoldSubsetPullback`: 
- in the INPUT section, there seems to be no entry for `ConvexSet_base` in the documentation

- in the following part of the EXAMPLES block:

```
sage: r_squared = M.scalar_field(x^2+y^2)
sage: r_squared.set_immutable()
sage: cl_I = RealSet((1, 4)); cl_I
(1, 4)
sage: cl_O = ManifoldSubsetPullback(r_squared, None, I); cl_O
```

  I guess `I` in the last line (which, at this stage, is the imaginary number *i*) should be replaced by `cl_I` and the subsequent `True` and `False` should become `False` and `True` respectively. But then, `cl_I` and `cl_O` are identical to `I` and `O` in the example that follows...

Do you think it would be easy to have both answers to be `True`? If no, this should not hamper the current ticket, but be differed to another ticket.
