It's not a silly question and even if it where: You are reviewing the ticket and I'm very thankful for this. You have every right to ask silly questions.

I specified what I expect in `find_face`. It's a hidden cython method. So I think it is fine to assume things without checking.

It's not a terrible fail, if `self.structure.highest_dimension` was set. This would just be ignored in this case.

This just prevents segmentation fault. It's never supposed to happen anyway. In fact I can't even change this. Because when I set `highest_dimension` it will be equal to `current_dimension`. Only after running this, is `current_dimension` lower, if there are faces left.

I don't understand the question.

`next_dimension` first calls `next_face_loop`. `only_subsets` makes sure that `next_face_loop` actually gets to the point of calling `get_next_level` (unless our face is the the only face left, than there are no new subfaces). If `new_faces_counter` is non-zero, the current dimension is lowered and it holds that `current_dimension < highest_dimension`.

If `new_faces_counter` is zero and there are no new subfaces, then `next_face_loop` returns `0` and `next_dimension` terminates as `current_dimension = highest_dimension`.

Whenever `next_face_loop` raises the dimension, it will return `0`. This way `next_dimension` will in fact check, that we still have `current_dimension <= highest_dimension`.

I meant to change to `if unlikely(self.structure.current_dimension > self.structure.highest_dimension):` like all other checkings.

Sure, if it never happens, then the current version is fine.

But it does not work. E.g. when you want to only visit the elements below the first facet, the highest dimension will be set to `d-2`. But current dimension is `d-1`. Only after `next_face_loop` is called has the dimension changed to `d-2`. This is different from the start. At the start the facets are already known and hence the dimension starts at `d-1`. But when you want to visit everything below something, the elements below have not been computed yet.\n\nI could set this up differently, if you find it confusing and make `only_subsets` call `next_face_loop` once.",

That's what I figure you meant. But it does not work. E.g. when you want to only visit the elements below the first facet, the highest dimension will be set to `d-2`. But current dimension is `d-1`. Only after `next_face_loop` is called has the dimension changed to `d-2`. This is different from the start. At the start the facets are already known and hence the dimension starts at `d-1`. But when you want to visit everything below something, the elements below have not been computed yet.

I could set this up differently, if you find it confusing and make `only_subsets` call `next_face_loop` once.

The intersections are obtained by intersecting the last face with each previous ones. If there is only one face, we can stop and don't need `get_next_level` to tell us that there are no intersections.

I don't think `n_faces == 0` can happen, but it is better to be safe than sorry. Because `get_next_level` will intersect the last face with all previous ones.
