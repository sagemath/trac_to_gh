(Edited)
You probably need to rebase this ticket on the #29683, or put `face.ambient_H_indices(add_equations=False) ` everywhere.

Does this need to be changed to `structure.highest_dimension`? Or maybe I'm looking at a wrong version of the code.

```
cdef inline int next_face_loop(iter_t structure) nogil except -1:
    r"""
    See :meth:`FaceIterator.next_face_loop`.
    """
    if unlikely(structure.current_dimension == structure.dimension):
        # The function is not supposed to be called,
        # just prevent it from crashing.
        raise StopIteration
```

Does `self.structure.dimension` in `cdef int find_face(self, face_t face) except -1` need changing?


---

Comment by yzh created at 2021-05-20 04:12:33

In `face_iterator.pxd`: New value 3 to be added to the comment

```
int face_status            # 0 not initialized, 1 initialized, 2 added to visited_all
```

```
raise ValueError("cannot only visit subsets after ignoring a face")
raise ValueError("cannot ignore a face after setting iterator to only visit subsets")
```

I understood the first, but not the second. Why is it an error, rather than say that the iterator is consumed? 
I apologize if this is a silly question

```
cdef int only_subsets(self) except -1:
    self.structure.highest_dimension = self.structure.current_dimension - 1
```

Why doesn't it prevent visiting the (sub) faces of dimension >= `self.structure.current_dimension`?

It's not a silly question and even if it where: You are reviewing the ticket and I'm very thankful for this. You have every right to ask silly questions.

Fixed.

I specified what I expect in `find_face`. It's a hidden cython method. So I think it is fine to assume things without checking.

It's not a terrible fail, if `self.structure.highest_dimension` was set. This would just be ignored in this case.

This just prevents segmentation fault. It's never supposed to happen anyway. In fact I can't even change this. Because when I set `highest_dimension` it will be equal to `current_dimension`. Only after running this, is `current_dimension` lower, if there are faces left.

I don't understand the question.

`next_dimension` first calls `next_face_loop`. `only_subsets` makes sure that `next_face_loop` actually gets to the point of calling `get_next_level` (unless our face is the the only face left, than there are no new subfaces). If `new_faces_counter` is non-zero, the current dimension is lowered and it holds that `current_dimension < highest_dimension`.

If `new_faces_counter` is zero and there are no new subfaces, then `next_face_loop` returns `0` and `next_dimension` terminates as `current_dimension = highest_dimension`.

Whenever `next_face_loop` raises the dimension, it will return `0`. This way `next_dimension` will in fact check, that we still have `current_dimension <= highest_dimension`.

I meant to change to `if unlikely(self.structure.current_dimension > self.structure.highest_dimension):` like all other checkings.

Sure, if it never happens, then the current version is fine.

```
    if n_faces <= 1:
        # There will be no more faces from intersections.
        structure.current_dimension += 1
        return 0
```

What do you mean by "no more faces from intersections"? Why is it `n_faces <= 1`, not `n_faces == 0`, nor `n_faces == 1`?

All other things on this ticket look good to me. Thanks for the explanations!

That's what I figure you meant. But it does not work. E.g. when you want to only visit the elements below the first facet, the highest dimension will be set to `d-2`. But current dimension is `d-1`. Only after `next_face_loop` is called has the dimension changed to `d-2`. This is different from the start. At the start the facets are already known and hence the dimension starts at `d-1`. But when you want to visit everything below something, the elements below have not been computed yet.

I could set this up differently, if you find it confusing and make `only_subsets` call `next_face_loop` once.

The intersections are obtained by intersecting the last face with each previous ones. If there is only one face, we can stop and don't need `get_next_level` to tell us that there are no intersections.

I don't think `n_faces == 0` can happen, but it is better to be safe than sorry. Because `get_next_level` will intersect the last face with all previous ones. If there is zero faces we have an overflow and the face `2^64-1` is intersected with all previous once, which will result in an segmentation fault.

But maybe it is better to handle this check as a first thing in `get_next_level`. This is probably where it belongs anyway. What do you think?

Thank you for the patient answer! It makes sense to me now.

I thought that `n_faces == 0` couldn't happen too; that's why I asked, in case I missed/misunderstood something. I was also wondering about the order of the `if` checks in `next_face_loop`, but I figured out that it doesn't really matter. Besides, `next_face_loop` and `get_next_level` are not objects of this ticket. The current implementation works well, so I don't think more changes are needed.

Thank you.

However, I will set this on "needs work" due to merge conflict with #31245. Depending on whether #31245 gets in or not, I will either rebase here or rebase #31245 and then put it back on "positive review".

I don't know, if #31245 will be rejected again. But it looks like it's done now. It just triggered an unrelated bug.

What is the best way to proceed from here? I could just create a branch for this ticket here on top of #31245 and can always go back to the old branch if that fails.


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2021-06-19 21:04:50

Sure, it's easy to just back out the merge if necessary

Rebased on #31245 and new version of #29683.

Needed to fix `max_dim` in `next_dimension` because of #31245.

Actually rebasing on new version of #29683 and then pulling in #31245.
