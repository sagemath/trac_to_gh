Implents annular Khovanov homology for braids.


```
sage: B = BraidGroup(2)
sage: b = B([1,1,1])
sage: b.annular_khovanov_homology()
{(9, 0): {3: Z},
 (7, 0): {2: 0, 3: C2},
 (1, -2): {0: Z},
 (3, 0): {0: Z, 1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 0},
 (5, 0): {1: Z, 2: Z, 3: 0},
 (5, 2): {0: Z}}
sage: annular_khovanov_homology(poincare_polynomial=True)
a^2*q^5 + q^9*t^3 + q^5*t^2 + q^5*t + q^3 + a^-2*q
```


It is computed very similarly as the implementation of Khovanov homology for links.

This is my first contribution.

I added the ability to output the poincareÃ© polynomial of the homology since the dictionary is often quite hard to read and it makes for a more compact output. However I'm not sure if this is the ideal place to implement it, maybe some more general solution for homologies would be better...

I'm also not sure where to put the additional needed imports for the needed modules. Should they be put at the front of the file or into each function, I've seen both in this file.

just a few trivial comments:

`.. NOTE::` should be in capital letters

`... == None` should be `... is None`

when iterating over dicts, you can remove the `.keys()` as this gives the same thing

add a reference to an article for the definition

I've used `IntegerRing()` since this was used everywhere else in `braids.py`. (i.e. in `burau_matrix()`, `alexenader_polynomial()` etc.)

I thought using ZZ just for this method would be a bit inconsistent.

I've left in `annular_khovanov_homology()` now. You're right it is often handy to have that shortcut.

However I removed the poincarÃ©e polynomial option, I really don't think this is the right place to implement it.

> I also wouldn't implement some poincarÃ©e polynomial method, since that would only work for the format returned by this method. I think if the user desires such output, it is reasonably easy to write a function that does this.

I don't understand what you mean by this. It would be perfectly fine for it to take the specific output of `annular_khovanov_homology()` or output it in a similar way. Anyways, if you don't think such an additional method is useful, then you don't have to implement it.

Oh yes, thank you. Once again the dictionary was out of order. Is there any simple way to get sage to print the dictionary in the right order, so one can write the doctests easier? For now I've always used `dict(sorted(d.items()))` but that doesn't work for nested dictionaries...

Although for this case, since you have `dict` of `dict`, you will likely have to manually convert it to the list of items and sort the items.

Also, typo `mad` -> `made`:

```
A tuple with the type of smoothing mad at each crossing.
```

         Return the annular Khovanov homology of a closure of a braid.

-          compute the homology. If this is ``None`` (default), then
