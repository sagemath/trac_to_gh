2) The comment `We illustrate objects that wrap GP objects (gp is the PARI interpreter)::` has absolutely nothing to do with the test you added, so the comment should be fixed.

3) It is better to use `os.path.isfile()` instead of `os.path.exists()` since it's a more specific test.

#14750 provides `SAGE_ETC`. This way, the test does not need to be edited after #14750.

done.

> 3) It is better to use `os.path.isfile()` instead of `os.path.exists()` since it's a more specific test.

Why should it not be a symlink? It's just a big pain if it does not exist at all.

> 4) Please make it clear whether the patch or the git branch should be merged. If you want the patch to be merged, it should be in Mercurial format.

This is now two commits on top of #14750, and can be merged after #14750.

A name can be both a symlink and a file (a symlink to an ordinary file is both).

> This is now two commits on top of #14750, and can be merged after #14750.
In that case I am removing the patch on this ticket, to reduce confusion.
