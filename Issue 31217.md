1)

```
sage: WordMorphism('a->a').is_growing('a')
True
```

should return `False`.

This happens due to the `if self.is_primitive(): return True` optimization. Easily fixable for example like this:

```diff
-       if self.is_primitive():
+       if self.is_primitive() and len(self._morph) > 1:
            return True
```

2)

```
sage: WordMorphism('a->a,b->bb').periodic_points()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: generator already executing
```

should return `[This is the Trac macro *word: bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb...* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#word: bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb...-macro)`.

I think this happens because `periodic_points()` doesn't check whether the letters are growing, so the following should fix it (assuming we only care about periodic points with infinite length):

```diff
        A = self.domain().alphabet()
        d = dict((letter,self(letter)[0]) for letter in A)
+       G = set(self.growing_letters())

        res = []
        parent = self.codomain().shift()
        for cycle in get_cycles(CallableDict(d),A):
+           if cycle[0] in G:
                P = PeriodicPointIterator(self, cycle)
                res.append([parent(P._cache[i]) for i in range(len(cycle))])
```


I added a branch with the proposed fixes.

Martin. Your branch should include the two doctests that are in the ticket description. Since the sage doctests are run it will prevent the bug to occur again in the future.
