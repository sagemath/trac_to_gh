Why not using an extra variable here ? not sure if it's really important.

```diff
-            a += u**2 / ((t - l) * (t - l.conjugate()) + u**2)
-            c += (t - l.real()) / ((t - l) * (t - l.conjugate()) + u**2)
+            tmp = ((t - l) * (t - l.conjugate()) + u**2)
+            a += u**2 / tmp
+            c += (t - l.real()) / tmp
```


otherwise, LGTM.
