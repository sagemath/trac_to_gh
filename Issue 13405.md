Consider the following code:
    

```
ff.<z> = GF(2**8, 'z')
poly.<c1,c2,c3> = PolynomialRing(ff, 3, 'c')
r1,r2 = var('r1,r2')
expression = -(c1*r2 - c2*r1)/c3
print expression.substitute(r1=z, r2=z)
```


This produces a TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for '*': 'Finite Field in z of size 2pow8' and 'Rational Field'. I know that 'expression' is not an element of the ring 'poly', but using a PolynomialRing is the only way I found to achieve symbolic arithmetic on finite fields.

However, the interesting story is that if I replace the expression by



```
expression = -(r2 - c2*r1)/c3
```


it work perfectly well, but if instead the expression is



```
expression = -(c1 + r2 - c2*r1)/c3
```


then I get a segmentation fault.


To make things a little bit more interesting I can rename r1 and r2 to a and b:


```
ff.<z> = GF(2**8, 'z')
poly.<c1,c2,c3> = PolynomialRing(ff, 3, 'c')
a,b = var('a,b')
expression = -(c1*b - c2*a)/c3
print expression.substitute(a=z, b=z)
```


Then it works fine, but produces a segmentation fault for,



```
expression = -(c1 + b - c2*a)/c3
```


so you can think that it might be a problem with the use of the names r1 and r2. But this is not the case, if I rename the PolynomialRing variables instead, from c's to x's:


```
ff.<z> = GF(2**8, 'z')
poly.<x1,x2,x3> = PolynomialRing(ff, 3, 'x')
r1,r2 = var('r1,r2')
expression = -(x1*r2 - x2*r1)/x3
print expression.substitute(r1=z, r2=z)
```


Then it works again for the first two expressions but produces a segmentation fault for the third too.

Any idea of what is going wrong here?

I can confirm the segfaults. The following three examples lead to a crash:


```
ff.<z> = GF(2**8, 'z')
poly.<c1,c2,c3> = PolynomialRing(ff, 3, 'c')
r1,r2 = var('r1,r2')
expression = -(c1 + r2 - c2*r1)/c3
expression.substitute(r1=z, r2=z)
<boom>

a,b = var('a,b')
expression = -(c1 + b - c2*a)/c3
expression.substitute(a=z, b=z)
<boom>

poly.<x1,x2,x3> = PolynomialRing(ff, 3, 'x')
r1,r2 = var('r1,r2')
expression = -(x1 + r2 - x2*r1)/x3
expression.substitute(r1=z, r2=z)
<boom>
```


The fact that this depends on variable names made me think of ordering issues like #9880, but the examples above still lead to a segfault with patches from that ticket. I am now suspecting a coercion problem.

BTW, the backtrace looks like this:

Would it be possible to give a little more details in the doctests introducing text?

I uploaded a new patch with some text [attachment:trac_13609-gf2_content.take2.patch]. To demonstrate the content of the expressions involved, I wrapped GiNaC's `content()` method in #13736. This ticket now depends on the patch there.

Note that multiplying the numerator I give in the doctests by the content
gives


```
sage: -num.content(c1)*num
c1 + z*c2 + z
```


which changes the original leading coefficient `-1` by coercing it to `GF(2^8)`.

This does not happen during normalization, since `numeric::div_dyn()` is used
directly to modify the coefficients. There is a shortcut in that function to
do nothing if we are dividing by `1`. Perhaps I should back out the current
fix in Pynac and change `numeric::div_dyn()` to disable the shortcut if the
characteristic is not 0.

Comments?
