The logic for `OptionalExtension` only checks whether _some_ version of the package is installed, which might not be the latest version. This problem is causing failures with bliss on the sage4 patchbot.

This seems to work fine.
I'd guess a more distribution-friendly way would be to use proper tests, like configure scripts do, for existing libraries/headers, instead of relying on package versions.
#20382 seems to go in this direction.
