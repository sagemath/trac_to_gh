I don't speak Portugese, but this is failing to apply to the current beta version of Sage because it conflicts (in a rather minor way) with #11485 -- please rebase.

I rebased on sage-5.0.beta8 (which includes #11485).

Only remark is the last paragraph of a_tour_of_sage/index.rst that would sound better if did not add twice the word "você". Probably translate as:

`Ao usar o Sage, você acessa ...`

I would like to review this patch and when try it with "Sage Version 5.4.rc1, Release Date: 2012-10-05" I got a FAIL in the file doc/common/build_options.py. Once it's a trivial correction I like to know if `@`goliveira can do the correction and update the patch.

This needs to be rebased to sage-5.4.rc1:

```
applying /release/merger/patches/trac_12502_pt_translation_of_a_tour_of_sage.patch
patching file MANIFEST.in
Hunk #1 succeeded at 32 with fuzz 1 (offset -7 lines).

Only the step of copying png files (and creating directory first) may be a bit confusing, but otherwise the patches apply cleanly in 5.4.beta1 and builds correctly.

I am afraid this needs to be rebased again to sage-5.4.rc3 + #11395 + #13072.
