I use the package successfully with SAGE_DEBUG=yes.

Some criticism: SPKG.txt contains a section "Patches", but the new patch disable_print_refs_debug.patch is not mentioned.

The content of environment variables is sometimes tested like

```
if ["x$SAGE_DEBUG"="xyes"]; then
```
if I am not mistaken, but here it is

```
if ["$SAGE_DEBUG"="yes"]; then
```
