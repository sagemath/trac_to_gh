This is still room for improvement for the constructor as it is 10x slower than

```
sage: %timeit -n 10000 Permutation([3,1,7,6,8,2,9,10,5,4])
10000 loops, best of 5: 15 µs per loop
```

Though, with `check=False` it is now faster

```
sage: S = SymmetricGroup(10)
sage: %timeit -n 10000 S([3,1,7,6,8,2,9,10,5,4], check=False)
NEW: 10000 loops, best of 5: 4.16 µs per loop
OLD: 10000 loops, best of 5: 59.3 µs per loop
```

Some little details in the `constructor.py`:

- `{1, ..., n}` -> `\{1, \ldots, n\}` and in latex format (this gets automatically changed when called as `?` doc).
- The error message should start with a lower case (a Python convention).

Should the `_set_*` really be `cpdef` and not just `cdef`? Past experiments I've done have shown that `cpdef` is slower.

I am not sure I see the point of having the constructor in a separate file. It also causes us to do two imports in what I would see as the most common scenario, when `parent is None`. Also, in that case, I don't see the point of doing the check again since it was already done in constructing the parent. In other words, I think you should add `check = False` to that case.

But then you can not call it from Python code.

You can not avoid having it in a separate file since they have the same name :-) Also the constructor file is pure python. I don't see the point of making it extremely fast. What is relevant is the timing I put in the ticket description (ie the `_element_constructor_` of permutation groups). Contrarily to the `PermutationGroupElement` constructor, the `_element_constructor_` of the parent is used by any method of permutation group that has to create elements.

Of course, but do we really want to be able to do that? They seem very internal and are only meant to be called as part of the constructor.

The name can easily be changed. `;)`  Although it sounds like what you are saying is that in library code, we should not use the constructor function. Why not also try and make it fast too? I trying to understand the logic of your design, and I am not saying it is bad/wrong, but I just don't yet comprehend it yet.

It is always convenient to be able to mutate a permutation without having to reallocate space for a new permutation. Even from Python. This hidden cpdef functions allows me to do the following

```
sage: from itertools import permutations
sage: p = PermutationGroupElement([1,2,3,4,5])
sage: %time for q in permutations([1,2,3,4,5]): p._set_list_images(q, False)
Wall time: 45.1 µs
```

The above is very convenient and infinitely faster than

```
sage: S = SymmetricGroup(5)
sage: %time for q in permutations([1,2,3,4,5]): p = S(q)
Wall time: 22.6 ms
```


As far as performance are concerned, I don't believe that here `cpdef` vs `cdef` matter in any way. Since `cdef` is just less flexible I would just stick with `cpdef`.

Yes. You should use `my_parent(data)` and not `GenericConstructor(data)`. This is what is done everywhere in `sage.groups.perm_gps` (and also for matrix and co). I am not introducing any new design here.

> Why not also try and make it fast too?

You are welcome to do so. But it comes as a second step anyway.

I hope I clarified it :-)

That is an abuse of the code IMO (borderlining on a straw-man argument). You really should just be iterating over the corresponding permutation group here. However, I will not be arguing this point (see below).

> As far as performance are concerned, I don't believe that here `cpdef` vs `cdef` matter in any way. Since `cdef` is just less flexible I would just stick with `cpdef`.

I have seen slowdowns when writing things with `cpdef` versus `cdef`. In particular this comes from indirect calls:

```
sage: %%cython
....: cpdef int f_cpdef():
....:     return 5
....: cdef int f_cdef():
....:     return 5
....: cdef int indirect_cpdef():
....:     return f_cpdef()
....: cdef int indirect_cdef():
....:     return f_cdef()
....: def test_cpdef():
....:     return indirect_cpdef()
....: def test_cdef():
....:     return indirect_cdef()
....: 
sage: %timeit test_cdef()
100000000 loops, best of 3: 19.3 ns per loop
sage: %timeit test_cpdef()
100000000 loops, best of 3: 19.4 ns per loop
```

Yes, I know ~1% slowdown is not much, but I am consistently getting it and it can stack up. I have seen 10-20% slowdowns in actual code by changing `cdef` to `cpdef`. Although this might not still exist in the current Cython version. I also am not noticing any change in timings for the simple tests I am running. So this isn't anything worth arguing about, but I just wanted to point it out.

Well, I guess you are making an equal swap in the other parts of the library code. Although we do get a bit of a slowdown:

```
sage: %timeit PermutationGroupElement([1,5,3,2,4])
NEW: 10000 loops, best of 3: 167 µs per loop
OLD: 10000 loops, best of 3: 162 µs per loop
```

However, this isn't really a big deal.

> > Why not also try and make it fast too?
> 
> You are welcome to do so. But it comes as a second step anyway.

I also removed some of the to-and-from cycles in constructing permutation group elements. The code is a little more complex, but it does pick up some speed.
Timings that have changed versus your branch:

```
sage: from sage.groups.perm_gps.permgroup_element import standardize_generator
sage: %timeit standardize_generator([3,1,7,6,8,2,9,10,5,4])
NEW: 100000 loops, best of 3: 3.65 µs per loop
OLD: 10000 loops, best of 3: 22.4 µs per loop
sage: g1 = PermutationGroupElement([(1,2),(3,4,5)])
sage: g2 = PermutationGroup([('a','b')], domain=['a', 'b']).gens()[0]
sage: %timeit g1 * g2
NEW: 10000 loops, best of 3: 37.5 µs per loop
OLD: 10000 loops, best of 3: 38.6 µs per loop
sage: S = SymmetricGroup(10)
sage: P = S.subgroup([(1,2,3,4,5,6,7)])
sage: %timeit for p in P: S(p)
NEW: 100000 loops, best of 3: 15.9 µs per loop
OLD: 10000 loops, best of 3: 19.9 µs per loop
```


Let me know what you think.

Hi Travis,

Why did you remove

```diff

             ...

```

It is intended as a deprecation message for people that would still use the class as the constructor.


---

Comment by tscrim created at 2019-11-06 23:23:04

An error is not a deprecation message, and this way has the same effect with being more Pythonic. Really that information should be contained in the documentation anyways. Plus, if someone is now getting an error, it means they are explicitly importing it, which is only likely happen in library code.


---

Comment by vdelecroix created at 2019-11-11 05:04:33

In the current version we have

```
sage: SymmetricGroup(['a','b','c'])(libgap.eval("(1,2,3)"))
('a','b','c')
```

The above allows (very indirectly) to make the following "works"

```
sage: PermutationGroup(gap_group=libgap.SymmetricGroup(5), domain=[1,3,5,7,9])
Permutation Group with generators [(1,3), (1,3,5,7,9)]
```

But to my mind, both shouldn't be allowed at all. There should not be any silent conversion of the domain.

What do you think?

My understanding is that `(lip)gap` only allows for a domain of `{1, ..., n}`. So in my mind this could almost be considered a "feature" of the Sage interface with `(lib)gap`. As such, I am leaning towards actually keeping the current behavior.

It would be nice if we could get rid of all those local imports in the `_set_other`...

I am fine with it but am worried that it is very much against the coercion `SymmetricGroup([1,3,5]) -> SymmetricGroup([1,2,3,4,5])`

```
sage: S1 = SymmetricGroup([1,3,5])
sage: S2 = SymmetricGroup([1,2,3,4,5])
sage: S2(S1([5,1,3]))
(1,5,3)
```


> It would be nice if we could get rid of all those local imports in the `_set_other`...

Two of them which are Cython classes and can actually be cimported. For the rest one can probably hack a `_late_import` but it is not very nice.

I see `SymmetricGroup` as being a different object, and its elements are not `libgap` objects. IMO, you should only be manipulating the libgap objects if you know what you are doing trying to get extra speed out, unless you are working only in libgap.

For the `Permutation`, I think it is okay to have it locally since it is last and already "slow" as it is a Python object. However, do we need to do that for the `pari_gen`?

Actually, since you moved the `standardize_generator`, we probably can do either `lazy_import` or maybe a standard import rather than locally.

I agree that initializing from (lib)gap is a bit hacky anyway. I added an example to the documentation of `__init__`.

Changing status from needs_info to needs_review.

LGTM. If the patchbot comes up green, then it is a positive review (including if you get rid of the local imports in `standardize_generator`).

Indeed, I am trying to remove the local imports in `constructor.py`.

`check=True` is way too slow compared the `PermutationGroupElement` constructor

```
sage: S = SymmetricGroup(10)
sage: %timeit -n 10000 S('(1,3,5)(2,7)', check=True)
10000 loops, best of 5: 160 µs per loop
sage: %timeit -n 10000 S('(1,3,5)(2,7)', check=False)
10000 loops, best of 5: 5.35 µs per loop
sage: %timeit -n 10000 PermutationGroupElement('(1,3,5)(2,7)')
10000 loops, best of 5: 62.4 µs per loop
```

Thank you. Looks good and a very nice additional improvement. Just waiting on a green patchbot before setting to positive.

failing doctests, see patchbot (the failures related to doc are not relevant)

Comment by tscrim created at 2019-11-11 13:18:20

The first failure in `cubegroup.py` is serious, the other is trivial. Although the changed error message `invalid permutation to initialize a permutation` in the failing book test is strange; the original message is better IMO.

Thank you for keeping us informed of the patchbot status Frédéric (although I am not sure if you consider yourself as a reviewer; please add yourself if you do).

I am glad that we get this done! Thanks.
