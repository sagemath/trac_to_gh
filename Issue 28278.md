Actually, it is a bit faster to do `tuple([x for x in range(10)])` than `tuple(x for x in range(10))`. I am also not sure how Python internally handles the memory, but maybe there is a point due to memory operations that the above statement is false? So, at least as of right now, I am not in favor of the removing the initial list around generator objects.
