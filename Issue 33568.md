primecount is now on Homebrew, see https://github.com/kimwalisch/homebrew-primecount/issues/1#issuecomment-1118333034, so we can use it.

This does work on Intel macOS, not checked on M1.

If you remove the unnecessary homebrew-build-env change (https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/csifEQ0gJW8/m/toM0HCAYAAAJ), we can merge it

This is on Apple Silicon M1.

After `brew install primecount` and merging this ticket #33805 on top of [SageMath](SageMath) 9.7.beta5:

* `./configure` detects system primecount (`primecount-7.4:  using system package; SPKG will not be installed`).

* `make && make pytest && make ptestlong` succeeds.

there is no harm in having it in homebrew-build-env. As I explained in the thread above, it's possible not to have it in the appropriate paths (or not in the right place in these paths).

Guillermo, could you please verify if it works without this branch (i.e., without the changes to `.homebrew-build-env`)?

this is a meaningless test, unless you really want to somehow (how?) make sure that primecount/sieve are installed and linked.

When you install these libraries, they are linked. Same as all other libraries except for those in keg-only packages. We do not have a list of all libraries in `.homebrew-build-env` - only those that need it because they are keg-only or need it as a specific workaround. Do you propose to change that and list all libraries in case someone has unlinked them?

they are only automatically linked if you don't already have them in your path somehow. I already mentioned this.

But this is not specific to primecount. Hence my question: Do you propose to handle all libraries in `.homebrew-build-env` in case someone has unlinked them?

Sorry, your discussion is beyond me.

In any case, same results for [SageMath](SageMath) 9.7.beta5 without merging this ticket.

HTH

Thanks for testing! This means that we only need the new file `build/pkgs/primecount/distros/homebrew.txt`, but not the change to `.homebrew-build-env`.

why not, it's about 20 libraries, I gather.
Besides, it can be linked today, and no longer linked after `brew update`...
