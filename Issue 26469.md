Keywords: documentation

In the README.md, we could have 2 lines for explaining how to build with Python 3, like (for instance):

To start the build, type make.

have:

To start the build, type make. 

In case you want to run Sage on Python 3 -- WARNING for beta-testing purpose --, you can then type: make configure && ./configure --with-python=3 && make.
