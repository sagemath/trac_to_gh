- Avoid some warnings in contrib/minizip [Vollant]
- Add -I../.. -L../.. to CFLAGS for minizip and miniunzip
- Add missing libs to minizip linker command
- Add support for VPATH builds in contrib/minizip
- Add an --enable-demos option to contrib/minizip/configure
- Add the generation of configure.log by ./configure

If `../patches` is either empty or non-existent, then `../patches/*` will expand literally to "`../patches/*`".  Since "`../patches/*`" isn't a file, the line

```
[ -f "$patch" ] || continue
```

will ensure that there are no error messages.

Yes, but it then would make more sense to `break` rather than `continue`.

But to perform some loop-invariant code motion, it would be better to just use


```sh
ls ../patches/*.patch &>/dev/null &&
echo "Applying patches to upstream source..." &&
for patch in ../patches/*.patch; do
    ...
```

Well, I think the only "special cases" we want to (or have to) handle here are:

* `../patches/` doesn't exist.

* The directory exists, but it is empty, or at least doesn't contain files matching `*.patch`.


(I won't insist on changing the `continue`, but it seems more natural [and actually is more efficient] to place a single test outside the loop.  Also, conditionally printing "Applying patches..." seems reasonable to me.)

If you wanted to go triple-safe, you'd have to use `[ -r "$patch" ]` instead of `[ -f ... ]`.

We could just apply the patches in a mercurial queue, since we ship a repo with every spkg. Anyway, this is pointless: I've built a fresh beta13 with this spkg, and it passes a ptestlong. I manually checked the error conditions. When you figure out what to do with the patch routine (delete it!), it's ready.

Yep.  I'm ok with the spkg as is, so setting it to positive review.

I don't have the same problem on `hawk`.  Are you using `/usr/local/bin/gcc`, i.e. gcc 4.4.3 on hawk?

Compiling with `CC=suncc` should also work.

I had some old environment variables set. Unsetting them seems to help.
