It seems that the f2c package is not used for anything, so let's remove it.

I am happy with this and actually been thinking of doing it for a long time. I am giving this a positive review.

Should we keep f2c as an optional spkg?

That's actually an interesting option. Do we have an idea of the usage of f2c by people? My feeling is that it is close to zero but I could be wrong.

There is certainly no harm in keeping it as optional package.

Unrebased to #12369 (i.e. make it apply _without_ #12369).
