# Issue 24528: GAP fails its own test on SPARC Solaris 11

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24765

Original creator: dimpase

Original creation time: 2018-02-17 22:11:31

CC:  jdemeyer dimpase

running the usual "testinstall.tst" for GAP fails here:

```
gap> HashKeyBag([1,2,3],0,1,-1) <> HashKeyWholeBag([1,2,3],0);
Bus Error (core dumped)
```


See https://github.com/gap-system/gap/issues/2191

Probably a big-endianness problem.

With this patch, on SPARC Solaris tests in src/sage/interfaces/gap_workspace.py, src/sage/interfaces/gap.py and src/sage/libs/gap/ pass.

Changing status from new to needs_review.

This does not solve all of GAP's problems on SPARC Solaris, but it at least gets rid of segfaults.

we now have access to Solaris 11.4 (on Sparc), if anyone wants to give it a try...
