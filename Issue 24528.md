CC:  @jdemeyer @dimpase

running the usual "testinstall.tst" for GAP fails here:

```
gap> HashKeyBag([1,2,3],0,1,-1) <> HashKeyWholeBag([1,2,3],0);
Bus Error (core dumped)
```


See https://github.com/gap-system/gap/issues/2191

Probably a big-endianness problem.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24765
