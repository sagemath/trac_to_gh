Keywords: crystals, Stanley symmetric functions, reduced words

This patch provides some improvements for the affine factorization crystal. 
Before this patch

```
sage: from sage.combinat.crystals.affine_factorization import AffineFactorizationCrystal
sage: W = WeylGroup(['A',3], prefix='s')
sage: w0 = W.long_element()
sage: %timeit B = AffineFactorizationCrystal(w0,6)
1 loops, best of 3: 131 s per loop
```
After this patch

```
sage: from sage.combinat.crystals.affine_factorization import AffineFactorizationCrystal
sage: W = WeylGroup(['A',3], prefix='s')
sage: w0 = W.long_element()
sage: %timeit B = AffineFactorizationCrystal(w0,6)
1 loops, best of 3: 2.86 us per loop
```
