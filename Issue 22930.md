Keywords: sd86.5

The following are desired features.

Coercions between base fields should induce coercions on function fields:

```
sage: K.<x> = FunctionField(QQ)
sage: L.<x> = FunctionField(GaussianIntegers().fraction_field())
sage: L.has_coerce_map_from(K)
True
```


Also in towers:

```
sage: K.<x> = FunctionField(QQ)
sage: R.<y> = K[]
sage: L.<y> = K.extension(y^3 + 1)
sage: K.<x> = FunctionField(GaussianIntegers().fraction_field())
sage: R.<y> = K[]
sage: M.<y> = K.extension(y^3 + 1)
sage: M.has_coerce_map_from(L)
True
```


And when the base ring coerces into the extension:

```
sage: K.<x> = FunctionField(QQ)
sage: R.<I> = K[]
sage: L.<I> = K.extension(I^2 + 1)
sage: M.<x> = FunctionField(GaussianIntegers().fraction_field())
sage: M.has_coerce_map_from(L) # not tested, base_morphism is not implemented
True
```

Positive review. But one doctest fails because an `is_injective` is not implemented. I think that we should just disable the doctest because the failing doctest is not in the scope of this. (We discussed several ways of fixing this. The best would probably be to change the `DefaultConvertMap` to be a `DefaultCoerceMap` [does not exist yet] which is in the category of domain and codomain and would therefore by magically be injective.)
