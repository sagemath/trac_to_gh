# Issue 15495: OS X app fails with no warning when run on read only file system (e.g. dmg)

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Keywords: mac app

When run directly from the disk image the OS X application should at least warn that it won't work instead of silently refusing to start.

I have run into this on numerous occasions but had gotten a semi-useful message.  But you are right that this should be really clear, maybe suggesting also to "drag to Applications" or "read the README" or something.  Not everyone knows what a README is, after all.

Here are some changes to show a (modal) dialog in the case that it's being run from a read-only file system e.g. disk image.

I also included some fixes to warnings.  So that's what those other changes are.

Two questions:
 * What is `project.xcworkspace/xcshareddata/Sage.xccheckout`?  It doesn't seem to fit in either of the categories you mention, though it looks like a harmless informational file.
 * What versions of OS X have you tested this on so far?  Does it rely on a newer Xcode?  (Just asking.)

It's a file the new Xcode uses to keep track of repositories.  Since we now use git and Xcode understands git, it got created.  Apparently it should be checked in to version control, so I did:

But yes, it _should be_ harmless.

I have only tested it on Mavericks, though I intentionally did *not* upgrade the Xcode project so it _should_ work with any version of Xcode that it did before.

Thanks, Volker, I'm woefully behind on reviewing.  One would think I have a real job not involving Sage or something...  Still haven't tested it on 10.4 but I guess it isn't supported anyway ;-)

The `NSModalResponse` causes problems on everything except 10.9.  See #16796.
