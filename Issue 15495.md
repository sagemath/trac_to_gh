I have run into this on numerous occasions but had gotten a semi-useful message.  But you are right that this should be really clear, maybe suggesting also to "drag to Applications" or "read the README" or something.  Not everyone knows what a README is, after all.

Here are some changes to show a (modal) dialog in the case that it's being run from a read-only file system e.g. disk image.

I also included some fixes to warnings.  So that's what those other changes are.

It's a file the new Xcode uses to keep track of repositories.  Since we now use git and Xcode understands git, it got created.  Apparently it should be checked in to version control, so I did:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18340453/should-xccheckout-files-in-xcode5-be-ignored-under-vcs

But yes, it *should be* harmless.

I have only tested it on Mavericks, though I intentionally did **not** upgrade the Xcode project so it *should* work with any version of Xcode that it did before.

Thanks, Volker, I'm woefully behind on reviewing.  One would think I have a real job not involving Sage or something...  Still haven't tested it on 10.4 but I guess it isn't supported anyway ;-)
