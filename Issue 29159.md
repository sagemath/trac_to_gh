Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29396

Original creation time: 2020-03-23 12:55:18

Keywords: discriminant,multivariate,RR,RDF

Inspired by [Ask SageMath question #50317](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/50317/discriminant-of-multivariate-polynomial/):


```
sage: R.<x,z> = RR[]
sage: f = x**3 + x*z + 1
sage: f.discriminant(x)
```


results in an error. Traceback:

By contrast, the discriminant of the same polynomial over `RIF` or `RBF` or `CC` or `CDF` works fine.

This one-line patch to `SingularElement.sage_poly()` seems to fix the problem, but I do not fully understand the code for this function yet, so the patch may need further work.

```
sage: R.<x,z> = RR[]
sage: f = x**3 + x*z + 1
sage: f.discriminant(x)
-4.00000000000000*z^3 - 27.0000000000000
```

I now understand the code well enough to be confident that the patch will not have any bad side-effects. But I discovered that exactly the same bug is in another part of the code, so I patched that too (and added another doctest).

Here is an example to show the effect of the latest patch. Before the patch, the bug can cause incorrect results:

```
sage: Sing = singular.ring('real', '(x,y)', 'lp') # initialize singular
sage: S.<x> = RR[]
sage: g = singular.new('x + 5') # define g to be the polynomial x + 5
sage: g.sage_poly(S) # should be the same polynomial (in sage), but it is not
5.00000000000000*x
sage: g.sage_poly(S) == x + 5
False
```

We get the correct result after applying the patch:

```
sage: Sing = singular.ring('real', '(x,y)', 'lp')
sage: S.<x> = RR[]
sage: g = singular.new('x + 5')
sage: g.sage_poly(S)
x + 5.00000000000000
sage: g.sage_poly(S) == x + 5
True
```

This pattern already appears in the code once,


```
# Directly treat constants
if singular_poly_list[0] in ['1', '(1.000e+00)']:
    return R(singular_poly_list[1])
```


so it can't be too far off the mark. You could use "not in" instead of "not( .. in .. )", but that's just a matter of taste. Otherwise, it looks reasonable and fixes the problem.

Thanks for the review and the suggestion. (I am not fluent in python.) I believe "not in" is much better, so I made the change.

No problem, thanks for the fix!
