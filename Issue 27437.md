A few explanations: there was some numerical noise. Also, one doctest in `multi_polynomial.pyx` (`list(ff)`) relies on a specific ordering in a dictionary, so it seems easiest to mark the test as "random". The test

```
[P._random_monomial_dfirst(3, (0,1,2)) for _ in range(10)] # py3 random
```

in `pbori.pyx` truly does seem random: I get a different answer each time I try it (start a new Sage session and run the command: I get different answers each time).

there was #27666 for pbori, but your fix looks better

I incorporated the spacing cleanup you had done at #27666 (changing `m*=M.gen(j)` to `m *= M.gen(j)`, for example).
