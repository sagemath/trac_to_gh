This looks like the same as in #23134

The segfault went away after removing the old pynac 0.7.5 library libpynac10. Normally it shouldn't be a problem to have the old library still around...
Since it's already reported in #23134 this can be closed. (Seems like I can't do this.)

Closing tickets in the sage-duplicate/invalid/wontfix module with positive_review (i.e. someone has confirmed they should be closed).
