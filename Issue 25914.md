# Issue 25914: Kummer surface functionality fails

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/26151

Currently the creation of the Kummer surface associated to a genus 2 curve fails. All three of the final statements in the following code return the same error.

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: f = x^5 + x + 1
sage: X = HyperellipticCurve(f)
sage: J = Jacobian(X)

sage: K = KummerSurface(J)
sage: K = J.kummer_surface()
sage: phi = X.kummer_morphism()
```

Here is a fix.

Note an important change in the check inside the definition of projective morphisms..
