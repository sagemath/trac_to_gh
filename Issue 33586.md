This will disable autodetection of `FEATURE`.

Useful for checking `# optional - FEATURE` annotations in particular when `FEATURE` is standard in Sage, for example `sage.misc.cython` (#33029).

Yes, you are giving yourself some tools to be able to isolate what you are testing more. Which is interesting in and of itself. But if we completely migrate to pytest (let's be honest that will/would take years), will that feature survive the migration? Does pytest support such disabling?

It worked for years until you added runtime detection that overrides it. Now you want to add a third layer of complexity without fixing the previous two.

I posted one possible solution recently on the mailing list and another ticket. Another (inevitable, eventually) option is to add a `./configure` script to whatever modularized component of sage requires bliss, and to copy `AC_ARG_ENABLE([bliss])` there. Then the "feature" that detects it from the other components becomes simply e.g. `import sage.whatever.BLISS`. There is already precedent for having setup.py run `sh ./configure` to keep that component pip-installable.

Sage has never had a mechanism to disable the use of optional features by the Sage library. 

The only thing that has changed is what the doctester tests. The present ticket gives you the tool that you need if you have problems with an optional package in your distribution packaging.

Conditionalizing tests on the presence of features is a key idea of the modularization, and we'll make it work with pytest too. Skipping tests based on predicates is a standard feature of all test frameworks. 

#33546 implements the Sage doctest discovery in pytest. It continues to use code from `sage.doctest`, so I see no issue in making `# optional` annotations work, but I don't know the details.

Together with 30 optional doctests, the log-message shows the same result:


```

This seems to be due to:


```sage
sage: from sage.doctest.external import AvailableSoftware
sage: S = AvailableSoftware()
sage: S._indices['database_knotinfo']
10
sage: S._seen[10]
0
```


But this can be changed by performing a `__contains__` test:


```sage
sage: 'database_knotinfo' in S
True
sage: S._seen[10]
1
```


So it looks as if such a test is missing somewhere.

The line `Features detected for doctesting:` only reports the dynamically detected features, a subset of what is listed as `Features to be detected:`.
The statically known ones (from `--optional`) are not reported there.

This works as designed, but if you have a suggestion how it should be changed, we can change it.

The doctests marked `# optional - xyz` *are* disabled using `--optional="!xyz"` -- as your test above with `--optional=!database_knotinfo,sage` verified.

It's difficult to make a suggestion before I've completely understood the intention. According to the given phrase I assumed it would correspond to the *Features to be detected*. So, at least in order to resolve that irritation it would be enough to change the phrase into `Dynamically detected features ...` (whatever this means).

Perhaps I have in mind a new option `sage -t --hide=FEATURES` which would imply `--optional='!FEATURE1,!FEATURE2,..'`. Is there something against having such an additional option? I think that could be realized via a boolean `_hidden` in class `Feature`, which default is `False` and would be switched to `True` in case of this option.

Sorry for using undefined terminology. 

When you use `sage -t --optional=sage,FEATURE`, then FEATURE is "statically known".

When you use `sage -t --optional=sage,optional` and SPKG is the name of a normal package that is installed, then SPKG is "statically known".

Other features, by default those enumerated by `sage.features.all.all_features` except for those enumerated by `sage.doctest.external.external_software`, are subject to detection the first time that their name appears as an `# optional - FEATURE` annotation. (This is done by `sage.doctest.parsing.SageDocTestParser`.)

Yes, I think something like this could make sense if there's a strong enough use case for it. It would probably be best to provide this mechanism also for non-doctest situations. So this would be a separate ticket.

The use case I'm thinking of is the following: If you have installed an optional package `xyz` and run a test on your changes, say


```
sage -t src/sage/....py
```


then it might happen that you get `All tests passed!` here. But after


```
make xyz-clean
```


the same invocation of `sage -t` could find failures. Probably we will get more situations like that as modularization goes ahead. Surely, the patchbots will detect these. But it will be more convenient if you can detect these failures easily on your own system. I don't know how difficult it would be to fake the absence of an optional package in general. But in all cases where the `Features` functionality is used consequently, it should be doable.

Of course! After my vacation (that is in a couple of weeks) I will try to figure out how this could be done.
