I test :


```
y = I*I*x / x # so y is the expression -1
y._is_positive()  # the answer is True (and I dislike)
z = -x / x 
z._is_positive()   # the answer is False 
bool (z == y) # the answer is True
```

Simpler example:


```
sage: (I*I)._is_positive()
True
sage: I*I
-1
```


The `is_positive()` test in pynac is at line 923 in numeric.cpp:


```
    case PYOBJECT:
      n = is_real() && (PyObject_Compare(v._pyobject, ZERO) > 0);
      if (PyErr_Occurred()) 
	py_error("is_positive");
      return n;
```


We use the python comparison. Unfortunately, this doesn't work as expected for number field elements:


```
sage: m = (I*I).pyobject()
sage: m.parent()
Number Field in I with defining polynomial x^2 + 1
sage: m > 0
True
sage: m
-1
```

attachment:trac_10064-compare_I.patch changes the quadratic number field element comparison code to return a more sensible result. Now we have:


```
sage: m = (I*I).pyobject()
sage: m > 0
False

This also fixes #10062.
