This is crazy:

```
sage: import gc
sage: A = at_least
sage: pre = gc.get_objects()
sage: K = Qp(7,2)
sage: post = gc.get_objects()
sage: len(post) - len(pre)
747
```

Much of that is empty lists:

```
sage: M = []
sage: for a in post:
....:     for b in pre:
....:         if a is b:
....:             break
....:     else:
....:         M.append(a)
sage: from collections import defaultdict
sage: types = defaultdict(int)
sage: for a in K.M:
....:     types[type(a)] += 1
sage: print '\n'.join([str(a) + ' ' + str(types[a]) for a in types.keys() if types[a] > 1])
<type 'list'> 554
<type 'tuple'> 57
<class 'weakref.KeyedRef'> 28
<type 'weakref'> 22
<type 'dict'> 18

<type 'staticmethod'> 4

<class 'sage.rings.homset.RingHomset_generic_with_category'> 2
<class '_ast.Name'> 2

sage: listlens = defaultdict(int)
sage: for a in M:
....:     if isinstance(a, list):
....:         listlens[len(a)] += 1
sage: sage: sorted(listlens.items())
[(0, 525), (1, 9), (2, 2), (3, 2), (23, 10), (53, 5), (116583, 1)]
```

I'm not sure where these 525 empty lists are created, but it seems a bit excessive.

It's not just p-adic fields:

```
sage: pre = gc.get_objects()
sage: K = QuadraticField(-11)
sage: post = gc.get_objects()
sage: len(post) - len(pre)
1152
```

```

These are the empty buckets of the various `TripleDict` and `MonoDict` data structures:

```
sage: import gc
sage: pre = gc.get_objects()
sage: K = Qp(7,2)
sage: post = gc.get_objects()
sage: len(post) - len(pre)
682
sage: pre_id=set( id(p) for p in pre )
sage: new=[p for p in post if id(p) not in pre_id and isinstance(p,list) and len(p) ==0]
```

OK, we have now all the new lists of length 1. Let's see who's referring to them

```
sage: refs=[]
sage: for p in new: refs.extend(gc.get_referrers(p))
```

and count, among the referrers that are lists themselves, what the lengths are.

```
sage: from collections import Counter
sage: Counter(len(l) for l in refs if isinstance(l,list))
Counter({525: 525, 117431: 525, 53: 265, 23: 228})
```

The first one must be `new` itself and the one of length `117431` also seems to contain all 525 of them, so that must be `post`. The other ones have conspicuous lengths: 53 and 23:

```
sage: search_src("TripleDict\(23\)")
structure/parent.pyx:684:            self._action_hash = TripleDict(23)
structure/parent_old.pyx:87:        self._action_hash = TripleDict(23)
sage: search_src("MonoDict\(23\)")
structure/parent_gens.pyx:254:        self._has_coerce_map_from = MonoDict(23)
structure/parent.pyx:682:            self._coerce_from_hash = MonoDict(23)
structure/parent_old.pyx:85:        self._coerce_from_hash = MonoDict(23)
structure/parent_old.pyx:100:        self._has_coerce_map_from = MonoDict(23)
structure/parent_old.pyx:343:            self._has_coerce_map_from = MonoDict(23)
sage: search_src("MonoDict\(53\)")
structure/parent.pyx:686:            self._convert_from_hash = MonoDict(53)
```

so it looks like we have 265/53=5 (empty) `self._convert_from_hash` dictionaries and 228/23=9.9, so probably 10 (mostly) empty `self._coerce_from_hash` and `self._action_hash` dictionaries. Did we create 5 parents, perhaps?

If you think this is a real issue, we could open-code the hashtables for `MonoDict` and `TripleDict` in the same way that `dict` is done. That's quite a bit of work to program correctly, though! In the mean time, we could reduce the default sizes of the dictionaries a bit. Perhaps 53 and 23 is a bit on the large side for dictionaries that tend to not fill up so much?

There is a comment in:
parent.pyx:2196

```
if self._coerce_from_hash is None: # this is because parent.__init__() does not always get called
            self.init_coerce(False)
```

that suggests that we can't rely on init to actually be responsible for allocating anything. Consequently, throughout parent.pyx and parent_old.pyx most of the time we use any of
  _action_hash, _has_coerce_map_from, _coerce_from_hash, _convert_from_hash
we check if they have been allocated yet. (There may be places where we don't check... which I suppose would be a bug).

This suggests the following fix:
   Never allocate any of these, unless we intend to put something in them. We already need to check if these are unallocated, if they are... we can safely assume they are empty and not create them unless we are about to put something in them.

This may even speed up execution if these lists are typically empty, as looking to see if an empty list contains something will be slower than checking that the list doesn't even exist yet (especially as we already check if the list doesn't exist yet).

Memory footprint:

```
sage: from sage.structure.coerce_dict import MonoDict
sage: memus= get_memory_usage();
sage: L=[MonoDict(23) for i in xrange(2*10^5)]
sage: print get_memory_usage(memus);
430.5078125
sage: memus= get_memory_usage();
sage: L2=[MonoDict(53) for i in xrange(2*10^5)]
sage: print get_memory_usage(memus);
908.0078125
sage: memus= get_memory_usage();
sage: L3=[sage.structure.coerce_dict.TripleDict(23) for i in xrange(2*10^5)]
sage: print get_memory_usage(memus);
430.5546875
sage: L4=[sage.structure.coerce_dict.TripleDict(11) for i in xrange(2*10^5)]
sage: print get_memory_usage(memus);
248.15234375
```

So we see that if we assume that `1MB=10^6B`, then the memory footprint of empty TripleDict and MonoDict is about 112 to 93 to 86 bytes per initialized bucket (for empty dicts they should have about the same memory footprint. This would not be true for an open-coded hash table). So scaling back all these dictionaries to starting size 11 is probably quite reasonable: That allows 6 entries in them before resizing would be triggered.

It also makes a difference in initialization time:

```
sage: from sage.structure.coerce_dict import MonoDict, TripleDict
sage: %time _=[sage.structure.coerce_dict.TripleDict(11) for i in xrange(2*10^5)]
CPU times: user 1.30 s, sys: 0.07 s, total: 1.37 s
Wall time: 1.37 s
sage: %time _=[sage.structure.coerce_dict.TripleDict(23) for i in xrange(2*10^5)]
CPU times: user 2.14 s, sys: 0.11 s, total: 2.25 s
Wall time: 2.26 s
sage: %time _=[sage.structure.coerce_dict.TripleDict(53) for i in xrange(2*10^5)]
CPU times: user 3.33 s, sys: 0.16 s, total: 3.49 s
Wall time: 3.50 s
```

As you can see, allocating the empty lists is a pretty significant cost as well. For an open-coded hash table we would expect on a 64-bit machine: 16 bytes per entry in MonoDict and 32 bytes per entry in TripleDict (compared to 24 bytes for a python dict) 

Furthermore, allocation time would be fairly independent of size: the store would simply be a slab of memory that can be initialized to null by a straight memory-zeroing call.

So I'm pretty sure we could make MonoDict and TripleDict quite a bit faster and more memory-efficient by basically just copying the open hash-table design for python's dict. We'd be working with table sizes that are a power of two, so we'd probably want to shift the addresses that we use as keys (given that the bottom 3 bits probably carry no information)

It's quite a bit of work to get right, so we should probably first establish that this is actually a bottleneck somewhere. I don't think the runtime characteristics of the implementations would be hugely different (but I cannot exclude something like a factor of 2 in runtime)

Indeed. Thus, I think it would be a good idea to start with small steps, that can easily be done and may improve the situation.

Namely:
- Let the default size of coercion caches be smaller. Why don't we make a test how big the caches become in doctests? If it turns out that most of the time we only store about 20 coercions, it does not make sense to create 53 buckets, but 23 would be more than enough.
- Only create the dictionaries when we actually need them. I should add: Do not initialise *all* coercion caches of a parent at once.

To test whether the dimension of the dicts is too big at initialisation, it makes sense to see how often a resize of `MonoDict` and `TripleDict` happens.

First findings:

- During startup of Sage, there is no resize of a `MonoDict`. There is exactly one `TripleDict` that is resized, and it is actually resized three times.
- The size of a `MonoDict` or `TripleDict` is always (by automatic resize) *smaller* than the number of buckets. The first resize of the `TripleDict` mentioned above happens when it has 53 buckets but 38 items (and after resize, it has thus 107 buckets for 38 items!)

I will now see what happens during doctests.

Question: Is it really a good idea to have 107 buckets for 38 items?

The answer to this question is basically the same as "Is it really worth using a dictionary with lightning fast lookup and bad memory density rather than a linear search in a dense list?", except that we get to tune between the two.

Given cache locality, a linear search in a list of 38 items could be quite competitive!

Python dicts are even more agressive in resizing: for small dictionary sizes, they aim for the next power of two that is at least FOUR times the number of items (and trigger it at 2/3 occupation rate). But then, their price per entry is 24 bytes.

Uh, no. I was more thinking of starting out with a bucket *list* of None. Your interpretation is also possible, but addresses a slightly different issue. It could be worth doing both, one of the two, or neither.

For your proposal: I don't know what the cost difference is between making an empty list and putting another reference to None in, i.e., the cost of

```
   cdef PyList buckets = PyList_New(nbuckets)
   for i in range(nbuckets):
        PyList_SetItem(buckets,i,None) #I think this works OK for refcounting
```

versus

```
   cdef PyList buckets = PyList_New(nbuckets)
   for i in range(nbuckets):
        PyList_SetItem(buckets,i,PyList_New(0))
```

If the difference is significant (and it may well be, because increffing doesn't involve memory allocation) then your interpretation may well have great benefits (and surely reduced memory footprint).

If you're feeling gutsy, you could just leave the entries in `buckets` initialized with `NULL` and save on all the incref/decref activity on None.

Come to think of it, I expect that your interpretation would have the biggest impact.

A reasonable start is [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table). We're currently using "separate chaining" which degrades fairly gracefully with increasing load factor, so perhaps the 60-70 load factor isn't as strict as the phase transition that open addressing undergoes around that point. You could experiment and tune a reasonable trade-off (the idea is that any time you don't hit what you're looking for on the first try, you've basically lost.

The other design limitation is that reshaping is expensive (O(size of dict)), so that should happen rarely. That means that if you increase the number of bins, you have to do so by a lot.

With the old code, it would have been relatively easy to create a dictionary with a fixed key size (e.g. a dictionary such that all keys are 5-tuples of objects that are weak-refd if possible and compared by identity).

One question we might address: How difficult would this be with the new code you are suggesting? You are defining `cdef struct mono_cell` and `cdef struct triple_cell`. One might think of this definition

```
cdef struct tuple_cell:

and then a `KeytupleDict` (or whatever we call it) would allocate enough memory for n pointers (n being the key size of the dictionary) both for `key_id_list` and `key_weakref_list`, for each item it stores. At first glance, your code looks like not difficult to generalise.

So, do you think we should have `MonoDict` and `TripleDict` for hard-coded key length and then (on a different ticket?) `KeytupleDict` for arbitrary fixed key length?

I do not think so. With the previous code you had a prototype that performed well and offered this feature and we didn't put it in. That suggests to me we don't have a need for it.

In any case, If you would do this I don't think you'd want to add an extra layer of indirection in the key fields. Hence, you'd have a dynamic length structure:

```
cdef struct tuple_cell:
    void* key_ids[length]
    PyObject* key_weakrefs[length]
    PyObject* value
```

which of course you cannot define, but you need the sizeof, which should fairly safely be `sizeofcell=(2*length+1)*sizeof(void*)` Then you can have your table allocated as

```
table=<void**>PyMem_Malloc(newsize * sizeofcell)
```

and addressing entry `i` would be addressed as

```
cursor=<void**>&(table[(i&mask)*(2*length+1)])
key_id1=cursor[0]
key_id2=cursor[1]
key_wr1=<PyObject*> cursor[length]
key_wr2=<PyObject*> cursor[length+1]
value  =<PyObject*> cursor[2*length]
```



One problem with open addressing is that it has no cache locality at all. That's not a huge problem if the table is compact (and your hits are almost always immediate). Since the weakrefs and value are only used for validation, not searching, you could consider storing 'those' under an indirection.

I think we should only generalize the design if we know we have a need for it. I think first we should establish if this implementation is really an advantage, if the hash functions perform well, and if the resizing amount is reasonable.

One way would be to let lookup keep statistics:
- number of iterations needed
- mask,fill,used statistics
and perhaps also for the dictionaries themselves:
- calls to resize
- calls to iteritems (especially with what mask:used:fill ratio that gets called)

See: [http://code.activestate.com/recipes/578375/](http://code.activestate.com/recipes/578375/) for a proposal that makes a much more compact search table with compact iteration.

And as well: profiling data on how much time one typically in this code. If that's 2%, even doubling the speed would not have much effect. We may be hitting this code fairly often, but it's still pretty specialized: not like a `dict` of which several get queried for any method lookup.

Well, I simply did...

The first commit is the result of your drop-in replacement, the second commit is removing the get_stats() method, which is a debug method that is not functional any longer. I think the second commit is nothing but a review patch. Filling Author and Reviewer fields accordingly---but the review is not completed yet!

I have good and bad news. The good news first.

Repeating the tests from comment:4, with the attached branch:

```
sage: from sage.structure.coerce_dict import MonoDict
sage: memus= get_memory_usage()
sage: L=[MonoDict(23) for i in xrange(2*10^5)]

sage: print get_memory_usage(memus)
79.5429687500000
```

So, that's much of a progress.

More good news. I compare sage-5.12.beta5+#13394 with the branch from here. First, without the branch:

```
sage: %time _=[sage.structure.coerce_dict.TripleDict(11) for i in xrange(2*10^5)]
CPU times: user 2.50 s, sys: 0.12 s, total: 2.61 s

CPU times: user 6.10 s, sys: 0.27 s, total: 6.36 s
Wall time: 6.38 s
```

With the branch:

```
sage: %time _=[sage.structure.coerce_dict.TripleDict(11) for i in xrange(2*10^5)]
CPU times: user 2.48 s, sys: 0.10 s, total: 2.57 s

sage: %time _=[sage.structure.coerce_dict.TripleDict(23) for i in xrange(2*10^5)]

sage: %time _=[sage.structure.coerce_dict.TripleDict(53) for i in xrange(2*10^5)]
CPU times: user 2.51 s, sys: 0.02 s, total: 2.53 s
Wall time: 2.53 s
```

Thus, it is a clear progress, for larger empty dictionaries.

Now for the bad news. I am testing how efficient it is to fill an empty `TripleDict`, triggering many resizes, and reading and deleting items. First, without the branch:

```
sage: cython("""
....: def test(T, list L, v):
....:     for i in L:
....:         for j in L:
....:             for k in L:
....:                 T[i,j,k] = v
....: """)
....: 
sage: T = sage.structure.coerce_dict.TripleDict(11)
sage: L = srange(100)
sage: %time test(T, L, ZZ)
CPU times: user 15.23 s, sys: 0.28 s, total: 15.51 s
Wall time: 15.54 s
sage: cython("""
....: def test2(T, list L):
....:     for i in L:

....:                 del T[i,j,k]
....: """)
....: 
sage: %time test2(T, L)
CPU times: user 2.74 s, sys: 0.06 s, total: 2.81 s
Wall time: 2.81 s
```

Now, the same with the branch:

```
sage: T = sage.structure.coerce_dict.TripleDict(11)
sage: L = srange(100)
sage: %time test(T, L, ZZ)
CPU times: user 131.21 s, sys: 1.36 s, total: 132.57 s
Wall time: 133.11 s
sage: %time test2(T, L)
CPU times: user 46.98 s, sys: 0.58 s, total: 47.56 s
Wall time: 47.97 s
```


**__Conclusion__**

The memory footprint and the creation time of an empty dictionary did considerably improve. However, the timings for setting, getting and deleting items became very very bad. These operations are of vital importance for the coercion framework, and hence this needs to be fixed.

Doesn't your code only test the setting and deleting of items? One hopes that the getting is actually the by far most common action otherwise... caching using a hash table is the wrong choice.

Even so, obviously it would be best to improve the speed of the new code to match the old code, but if this isn't possible one could add parameters to parent constructors of the form:
    expect_lots_of_coercion = True, expect_lots_of_actions=True
and let either the user or the class implementer decide if it is likely there will be a lot of coercions or actions and pass the appropriate parameter.

The following is a bit off topic, implicit coercion is clearly important (and incredibly useful), but wouldn't it always be strictly faster for a caller to explicitly coerce with the correct function rather than letting things get to the lookup code? So couldn't a user get more of a speed boost by being warned that an implicit coercion is happening and being encouraged to do the correct cast manually (for example in the above code I posted, I assume K(2)-K(2) would be strictly faster than 2-K(2)). I know various databases have settings to either warn on implicit coercion or to even disable it completely, can this be done in SAGE?

No, sticking with the old implementation (possibly made lazy) would probably be a far better choice. I should stress this code is an experiment. Perhaps open addressing isn't an appropriate choice for our application or perhaps I just made an error in my implementation. I didn't replicate all the tuning choices made in python's dict but went for a "straight" implementation first.

Yes, but probably hardly noticeably so. The conversions are going to be the expensive bit. Far better: make sure that your elements are all in the right parent anyway (for actions this doesn't apply of course).

Hm, I'm getting on vanilla 5.10:

sage: %time test(T,L,ZZ)
CPU times: user 0.79 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.79 s

and on 5.13 with patch:

```
sage: sage: %time test(T, L, ZZ)
CPU times: user 19.53 s, sys: 0.02 s, total: 19.56 s
Wall time: 19.67 s
sage: sage: %time test(T, L, ZZ)
CPU times: user 6.46 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 6.46 s
Wall time: 6.49 s
```

so the gap for me is a little smaller, but definitely there. (running a second time gets rid of resizing in both cases. You're basically trying reassigning then). I think the new hash might be bad in the face of permutations.

When I instrument lookup to print length of probe sequence until result and (mask,used,fill) I get the impression the probe sequences are a bit on the long side, indicating poor hashing. We may have choose a bit more convoluted way of combining the bits of the addresses. In particular, if I keep track of:

```
summed_expected += (<double> j) - (<double> self.mask+1)/(<double> self.mask+1-self.fill)

where j is the number of iterations needed by lookup I think I should get something that averages 0 (since I'm subtracting the expected number of samples needed to obtain a NULL), but I'm getting way larger numbers. That indicates to me poorly randomized probing sequences.

Deletion is indeed also slower (as expected)


**EDIT:** I think the hash indeed is very bad. If instead we do

```
        cdef size_t key = <size_t>key1 + 13*(<size_t>key2) ^ 503*(<size_t>key3)

(i.e., borrow the function originally used) I still see `summed_expected` slowly drift upward, but nowhere as quickly. I didn't do the statistics carefully, so that may even be expected.

Would it make sense to have `cdef type fixed_KeyedRef=KeyedRef` instead of just `cdef fixed_KeyedRef=KeyedRef`? After all, we do "isinstance" for a couple of times, so, it might help Cython if it knows that `KeyedRef` actually *is* a type.

Replying to [comment:32 SimonKing]:
> Can you elaborate: What is `PyCapsule`? I've never heard of it.

It's a python object wrapping a `void *`: http://docs.python.org/2/c-api/capsule.html , so it does exactly what we need. In cython it would be something along the lines of:

```
cdef class myPyCapsule:
  cdef void* pointer
```

I don't think doing that would be much faster, though: we'd be receiving a `<object>` that we have to cast to a !myPyCapsule, so cython would be generating the type testing code anyway, which is probably what PyCapsule_GetPointer is spending most of its time on anyway. So going with the standard python solution for the thing seems appropriate.

Previously, we were casting `<void*>` to `<Py_ssize_t>` which we then wrapped as a `PyInt` object. `PyCapsule` seems more appropriate. (in our previous implementation it wasn't, because our buckets we `PyList`, so our keys weren't stored as bare `void*` anyway. I don't think `PyCapsule` objects have sensible comparison semantics, so packaging them as `PyInt` made more sense.

It is indeed a good hash function, particularly for moduli that are a power of 2. Where did you get it from? or was it already in the code?

My change was just misguided. I thought the other hash was based on "prime modulus", so I wasn't assuming it was particularly good for my situation. And I thought the new code wouldn't be so sensitive, because it still has the "perturb" as well. I was wrong.

It has been in the code (as I have just checked by looking at the patch from #715).

When we tried to create a generalisation of `TripleDict` towards a dictionary with fixed key length at #12313, I did some google search concerning hash functions for tuples. I don't recall the web page, but it resulted in this code, see attachment "idkey_dict" at #12313:

```
cdef list find_bucket(self, tuple keytuple):
    # Determine the appropriate bucket
    cdef size_t h = 0x345678
    cdef size_t i
    for i from 0<=i<self._keylen:
        h *= 1000003
        h ^= <size_t>PyTuple_GET_ITEM(keytuple,i)
    cdef list all_buckets = self.buckets
    return <object>PyList_GET_ITEM(all_buckets, h % PyList_GET_SIZE(all_buckets))
```

Hm, perhaps this is a good argument for trying to avoid circular structures and hence avoiding encoding erasers via closures and instead do it via an eraser class that has a weak reference to the dictionary:

```
sage: import gc
sage: 
sage: T=weakref.WeakKeyDictionary()
sage: 
sage: L=[GF(p) for p in prime_range(1,1000)]
sage: for i in range(len(L)-1): T[L[i+1]]=L[i]
sage: del L
sage: print len(T)
167
sage: C=0
sage: while len(T) > 0:
....:         C+=1
....:         _=gc.collect()
....:     
sage: print C
167
```

as you can see, every GC only collects one finite field. This is what one should expect: When GC does its analysis, it finds there is only one field that is unreachable, so GC collects that.

*ping*

I think this straightforward replacement is worth merging:
- memory layout is more straightforward: If you want to trace a memory leak/reference chain, you immediately get to the MonoDict/TripleDict rather than having to dig through 2 levels of lists
- memory footprint is much more compact
- performance should be quite a bit better (although it seems that these dicts rarely get accessed in tight loops: optimizing such a loop usually removes the access to these dicts)
- the way items get deleted makes sure that the Python trashcan is involved, which prevents recursion depth errors from occurring when deleting long chains of objects.

So, if someone can finish the review ... It's pretty straightforward code (apart from being rather performance sensitive).

If I have a local branch associated with this ticket, and if I pull from this ticket and there are merge conflicts with my local branch, I'd expect that my old local branch (ticket/15367) be preserved and a new local branch (say, ticket/15367-1) be created that is equal to the branch forced-pushed by Nils.

Sorry about the rebase, but in this case it seemed warranted because
- nothing else depended on the branch
- There was a big back-and-forth on removing and reintroducing the Eraser classes, which would have been silly to archive in the sage history (tripling the modification size, or something like that)

Keeping the trivial edits to `CoercionModel_cache_maps.get_stats()` attributed to Simon was an interesting exercise, though.

AFAIK, git knows that this was a forced push. So, the dev script should at least offer a "forced pull".

In the branch:

```

sage: %time test(T,L1,L1,L1,ZZ)

Wall time: 0.86 s
sage: get_memory_usage()
231.640625
```

In sage-5.13.b4 (plus #14912, but this doesn't touch coerce dict):

```
sage: T = sage.structure.coerce_dict.TripleDict(11)
sage: L1 = srange(100)
sage: %time test(T,L1,L1,L1,ZZ)
CPU times: user 15.94 s, sys: 0.11 s, total: 16.05 s

sage: %time test2(T,L1,L1,L1)
CPU times: user 1.86 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 1.86 s
Wall time: 1.87 s
sage: %time test3(T,L1,L1,L1)
CPU times: user 1.86 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 1.86 s

sage: %time test5(T,L1,L1,L1)
CPU times: user 1.72 s, sys: 0.03 s, total: 1.75 s
Wall time: 1.75 s
sage: get_memory_usage()
318.078125
```

So, everything became faster, and the memory consumption is a bit less (but the latter could very well be because of other tickets).

The effect on startuptime is probably not significant, but I get (one run only) `1586.843ms` with the branch versus `1600.406ms` with 5.13.b4+#14912.

So, the winner is: THIS BRANCH.

Last step of the review: Read the new code.

Cython has grown type inference.

No, because cython infers the correct type by itself.
