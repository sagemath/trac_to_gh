# Issue 26383: Bug with attach() in Jupyter Notebook

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/26620

As pointed out in https://ask.sagemath.org/question/43964/how-to-attach-a-simple-sage-script-in-a-sage-jupyter-notebook/, trying to use `attach()` in a Jupyter Notebook results in just an error message:


```
UsageError: Invalid GUI request 'sage', valid ones are:[None, 'widget', 'qt5', 'qt', 'nbagg', 'osx', 'gtk', 'qt4', 'gtk3', 'notebook', 'tk', 'ipympl', 'inline', 'asyncio', 'wx']
```


I was able to confirm this even with a trivial `.sage` file.

I suspect `attach()` can be implemented without breaking any other inputhooks.

Retargeting some of my tickets (somewhat optimistically for now).

Removing most of the rest of my open tickets out of the 8.7 milestone, which should be closed.
