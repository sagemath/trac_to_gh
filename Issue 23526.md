This was quite easy (if maybe not very efficient)

LGTM. We probably should finish #15578...

Actually, isn't this a connected Hopf algebra? That way you could get an antipode for free (#18675 implemented a default antipode for connected (graded) Hopf algebras).

Yes, it is. Do you know if "connected" is an axiom ?

All done ! Thanks for your precious help, Travis !

No problem. I didn't even know we had the default implementation done when we added connected Hopf algebras.

One last detail: you can remove the `one` implementation and use the default (which is cached). Either way you decide, you can set a positive review on my behalf.

Done. I am setting to positive.

Dear Prof Chapoton,

Thank you very much for the code, and for notifying us on the other ticket. Is it possible to code the dual algebra too (maybe using some standard code for dualising combinatorial Hopf algebras)?

Also two questions about using the code:
1. Is it possible to ask Sage to produce a list of the planar binary trees of degree n (in order to make matrices for the product, coproduct etc.)?
2. How do I input a particular tree? In your examples I see only 

```
 sage: x = RT([], '`@`')
```

which creates the element in degree 1.


Thank you very much.

Amy

My pleasure. For the dual, I have no idea.

`sage: list(BinaryTrees(4))`

but beware that you need to use the unlabelled version

`sage: algebras.FreeDendriform(QQ,1)`

We currently have no way to list the labelled trees.

There are many ways. Here is my favorite one:

```
sage: from sage.combinat.abstract_tree import from_hexacode
sage: RT = BinaryTrees()
sage: t = from_hexacode('2022000', RT); t
[[., .], [[[., .], [., .]], [., .]]]
sage: %display unicode_art
sage: t

  __o___
 ╱      ╲
o       _o_
       ╱   ╲
      o     o
     ╱ ╲    
    o   o   
```

The word given as input is the list of valences of vertices, read in the recursive order (root, word for left subtree, word for right subtree). I hope it's clear ?
