# Issue 33770: Allow start parameter in Python's sum

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/34007

Original creator: bruno

Original creation time: 2022-06-17 14:05:17

Keywords: sum

From Python 3.8, the //start// parameter of the built-in function `sum` can be given as a keyword argument. For instance:
 

```python
>>> sum([1,2,3], start=1)
7
>>> sum([[1],[2]], start=[])
[1, 2]
```


Sage's `symbolic_sum`, imported as `sum` and overwriting the original `sum`, does not pass this keyword argument. Hence in Sage:


```python
>>> sum([1,2,3], start=1)
6
>>> sum([[1],[2]], start=[])
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'list'
```
