Keywords: polyhedra, incidence matrix, adjacency

Currently incidence matrix and adjacency matrices of polyhedra/cones/lattice polytopes are set up with base ring `ZZ`.

It seems more natural to use `GF(2)`. This should improve memory usage.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29840

I don't think that GF(2) is more natural. ZZ is more natural for incidence matrices one can express various counting questions using it (row sum, column sum...)
