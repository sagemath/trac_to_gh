# Issue 29603: Incidence matrix and adjacency matrix mod 2

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29840

Original creator: @kliem

Original creation time: 2020-06-10 13:32:37

CC:  jipilab @laisrast

Keywords: polyhedra, incidence matrix, adjacency

Currently incidence matrix and adjacency matrices of polyhedra/cones/lattice polytopes are set up with base ring `ZZ`.

It seems more natural to use `GF(2)`. This should improve memory usage.

I don't think that GF(2) is more natural. ZZ is more natural for incidence matrices one can express various counting questions using it (row sum, column sum...)

Ok, I never thought of this one...

Well, I have used it in the past, but I just forgot. I think we should use this ticket to add those examples. Because `ZZ` vs `GF(2)` is a design decision that was never documented. At least not with a doctest.

Thank you. This way I'm hopefully the last person trying this.
