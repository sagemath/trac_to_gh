Right now, Coxeter groups iterate via a depth-first-search. However, this does not iterate over all elements of the group. We change this to use breadth-first-search, where each level all has the same length and there is only a finite number of elements of a fixed length.

Are you sure ? Do you have an example ?

Consider any infinite Coxeter group. It currently iterates via depth-first-search, but there often is an infinite number of elements starting at a given base point. Explicitly, consider type A<sub>1</sub><sup>(1)</sup> (or the infinite dihedral group or the free product `ZZ/2ZZ * ZZ/2ZZ`), then the iteration goes s<sub>0</sub>, s<sub>1</sub>s<sub>0</sub>, s<sub>0</sub>s<sub>1</sub>s<sub>0</sub>, s<sub>1</sub>s<sub>0</sub>s<sub>1</sub>s<sub>0</sub>, .... Note that it will never hit s<sub>1</sub>.
