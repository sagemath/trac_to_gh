As discussed in #28175 and https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage-numerical-backends-coin/pull/4, it may be useful to modularize sage by the use of namespace packages - See â€‹https://packaging.python.org/guides/packaging-namespace-packages/

One obstacle to using namespace packages is that `src/setup.py` (`clean_stale_files`) deletes unknown files in the installation tree (`$SAGE_LIB/sage` = `..../site-packages/sage`). This would remove installed namespace packages within the `sage` package.

`find_namespace_packages` accepts any directory as a package directory:

```
class PEP420PackageFinder(PackageFinder):
    @staticmethod
    def _looks_like_package(path):
        return True
```

(https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/blob/f991fbb3c9d0e10a0a78ae2b508b3fd99f9cdef2/setuptools/__init__.py#L110)

But our source tree has some directories that should not be considered package directories. I have marked these with the `nonamespace` file.

Having both `nonamespace` and `namespace` files results in simpler changes to the existing code.

Probably I'm missing something here. The new mechanism seems to still rely on indicator/marker files, just that the are now named `all__`. Except for the different name this seems to be exactly the approach of the rejected PEP 382.
The point of my proposal was that only the setup file should know/decide on which packages it want to include and exclude. Then the general helper in #33033 would like

```
is_namespace_package(dir):
   return dir in setuptools.find_namespace_packages(include=..., exclude=...)
```

And the setup.cfg would use https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/package_discovery.html.

In the end it comes down to who should have the control:
- Should the doctest code decide what to test, and the setup.py/cfg file what to distribute and the sage startup script what to expose
- or should the module/package be responsible to declare that it should be tested, distributed and exposed

Currently, this ticket (and the related ones) go in the direction of the second approach by using `all.py`. For me, using inversion of control and following the first approach seems more natural and flexible. Since you have a better overview though, I trust your judgement.

Thank you for the update.

I have been testing (using) this ticket and and the sequel #33011 for a while. They works well. I checked the code as far as I can (not very far), and it looks good to me. 

If we don't have further comments on this ticket, then it would better be tested by more developers in the wild by merging this now, so that we can fix problems before the next release.

I will wait for your (not Matthias) meta comments, and proceed to "positive review" in a couple of days.

I start from `git clean -fdx` - which cleans much more.

You'll probably want to move `upstream/` outside and after `git clean` make a symbolic link to it, otherwise it will re-download things.

Thanks. But it didn't help. As far as I understand, the doctest failures are expected. The real problem is:

```python
$ pkgs/sagemath-categories/.tox/py39/bin/python3.9 
Python 3.9.13 (main, May 24 2022, 21:28:31)

```

Strangely this works 

```python
Hera:sage-dev$ pkgs/sagemath-categories/.tox/py39/bin/python3.9 
Python 3.9.13 (main, May 24 2022, 21:28:31)

Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> from sage.structure.sage_object import SageObject
>>> from sage.categories.category import Category
>>> 
```


Anyway, this is not a problem of this ticket. The situation is the same without this ticket.

Hence my positive review to this ticket!

Yes. But even after removing it from the path, it's the same.

sagemath-categories (in contrast to sagemath-standard) does not need `make build` because all of its build and runtime dependencies can be found on PyPI.

**sagemath-categories** as of this ticket does not contain src/sage/matrix/matrix_space.py (see `pkgs/sagemath-categories/MANIFEST.in`), so `MatrixSpace` is not available in `sage.all__sagemath_categories`.

Note that the `tox` run ends with the message "lots of doctest failures are expected". This is one of them.

The Sage library contains many cyclic imports. If one starts at the wrong place in an import cycle, one can run into problems with partially initialized modules. See #33580 (Meta-ticket: make all modules importable without sage.all)
