# Issue 11792: MPIR: Use proper ABI name on Linux PPC64

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/11964

Original creator: John Palmieri

Original creation time: 2011-10-31 00:18:20

Assignee: leif

CC:  fbissey jhpalmieri

Keywords: PowerPC64  mode32 mode64 64-bit

This is a follow-up to #11896, where we introduced setting `ABI` also on Linux unless it is already set.

On 64-bit PowerPC Linux, this has to be `ABI=mode64` instead of `ABI=64`.

The patch makes sense and this builds on the skynet machine silius.  Fran√ßois, I'm setting this to positive review, but if you disagree or want more time to look at it, please switch it back.
