On Debian testing, which currently has `ecl` and `eclib` 21.2.1+ds-4, the upgrade o from 9.7.rc0 to 9.7.1 failed twice (before and after doc cleanup) to compile `plot3d` documentation. The error seemed to `ecl` (system package) failing ultimately to load Maxima.

The same ecl interpreter ran perfectly the same (Sage's) Maxima interpreter for Sage 9.7.rc0.

See [this sage-release thread](https://groups.google.com/g/sage-release/c/2xBejyUnqOg/m/0V-IE9qpCAAJ) for details and relevant `install.log`.

Workaround : configure Sage for //not// using system's `ecl` and `eclib`.

Quick comment: eclib has no relation to ecl

Can't reproduce it with `tox -e docker-debian-bookworm-standard`. 

The posted log (install.log.gz) suggests this is a broken incremental build.

This //is// without a doubt a broken "routine" upgrade. Therefore, the question to solve is : //"//what// broke the upgrade ?"//.

Answering this question may uncover weaknesses or bugs previously undetecte

You can try #34203 (`make -j list-broken-packages`) next time something is broken
