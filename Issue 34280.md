On Debian testing, which currently has `ecl` and `eclib` 21.2.1+ds-4, the upgrade o from 9.7.rc0 to 9.7.1 failed twice (before and after doc cleanup) to compile `plot3d` documentation. The error seemed to `ecl` (system package) failing ultimately to load Maxima.

The same ecl interpreter ran perfectly the same (Sage's) Maxima interpreter for Sage 9.7.rc0.

See [this sage-release thread](https://groups.google.com/g/sage-release/c/2xBejyUnqOg/m/0V-IE9qpCAAJ) for details and relevant `install.log`.

Workaround : configure Sage for //not// using system's `ecl` and `eclib`.
