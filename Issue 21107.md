Note that `multimodular` is no longer in `ext` but in `arith`

Changing keywords from "" to "sd75".

To prevent any duplication of effort, note that [my experimental branches](http://marc.mezzarobba.net/code/ore_algebra-analytic.git/) of `ore_algebra` include fixes for some of the issues. I don't have time to clean them up right now, unfortunately, but if/when I do I'll talk with Manuel to have the changes merged back in the official version.

A new version of the package is now available at http://www.kauers.de/software/ore_algebra/ore_algebra-0.3.tgz. It works for Sage 7.5.1 (at least for me). This version also includes Marc Mezzarobba's extension for numerical evaluations. (Thanks Marc, for your help with updating the code!)

Can this new version be made official? I see nothing on http://www.risc.jku.at/research/combinat/software/ore_algebra/

I consider this the official version, but I am no longer at RISC and won't post new versions on their site. Instead, it's posted on my personal website: http://www.kauers.de/software.html (third item).

Changing status from new to needs_review.

This is indeed fixed in 0.3, see #22870.

Confirmed.

Closing tickets in the sage-duplicate/invalid/wontfix module with positive_review (i.e. someone has confirmed they should be closed).

Resolution: wontfix
