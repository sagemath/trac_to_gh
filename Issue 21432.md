# Issue 21432: Segmentation fault when saving certain empty matrices

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: Stefan

Original creation time: 2016-10-08 22:39:08

Keywords: finite field, matrix, segmentation fault

When saving a GF(4)-matrix with 0 rows or columns a segmentation fault is triggered:

```
sage: A = Matrix (GF(4,'a'),0,1)
sage: save(A, "/Users/svanzwam/Dropbox/test.sobj")
------------------------------------------------------------------------
0   signals.so                          0x000000011028d525 print_backtrace + 37
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* module has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off().
Python will now terminate.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Segmentation fault: 11
```


The behavior appears restricted to matrices over GF(2^k) for k > 1.
