Issue created by migration from Trac.

It's the usual libtool -no-undefined flag trick.
See #13354.

Another issue is that iml is not currently linked to ATLAS because of our ugly hack (which at least makes it possible to build IML on all supported platforms...)... So just passing -no-undefined to libtool is doomed to fail.
