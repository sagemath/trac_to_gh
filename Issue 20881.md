A couple things here.

- the 2nd doc test fails without #21108, so that should be list as a dependency on the ticket

- OUTPUT: List -> List of integers

- the block


```
if self.is_morphism():
    D = [1,self.degree()]
    for n in range(2, iterates+1):
        D.append(D[1]**n)
```


can be replaced with


```
if self.is_morphism():
    d = self.degree()
    return [d**k for k in range(iterates+1)]
```


- the line

```
for n in range(0, iterates+1):
```


can be written as


```
for n in range(iterates+1):
```


- add a todo block to improve the iteration after composition (#15378) is implemented
