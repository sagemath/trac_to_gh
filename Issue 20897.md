# Issue 20897: 'make <package>' shouldn't always say "Sage build/upgrade complete!"

If for example a full build of Sage got interrupted or failed, and one afterwards does

```sh
make some_package
```

and the latter succeeded, one at the end gets

```
Sage build/upgrade complete!
```

even though Sage isn't yet fully built.

(This message comes from `build/make/install`, a shell script called from the top-level Makefile, which in turn invokes `make` on `build/make/Makefile`.)

----

We could check `$1` also before printing that message, and/or add

```sh
if $MAKE -q "$target" >/dev/null 2>/dev/null; then
    # $target is up-to-date 
    ...
else
    # $target hasn't fully been built yet
    ...
fi
```

there again (with `target=all` or probably `=all-build`).

Also, the hint on installing scripts should now be given if `$1 = all-build` as well.
(We could perhaps move it into the Makefile / `deps` anyway.)

Even after just *downloading* an upstream package tarball (`./sage -i -d <package>`), Sage afterwards says _"Sage *build*/upgrade complete"_, which is simply plain wrong and misleading.
