Is use of argparse the only thing that currently breaks compatibility for Python 2.6?  If so I think bundling it is a no-brainer--I've done it in a dozen other projects (though most projects are finally droppping support for Python 2.6).

That said we either support Python 2.6 or we don't.  If Sage isn't tested against Python 2.6 it doesn't support it as far as anyone should be concerned.  Same goes for any other Python version.  If it's not tested it's not supported.

Well, why? The difference is that, AFAII, `bootstrap.compat.argparse` exists, while `build/sage_bootstrap/compat/` might not (yet).

FWIW, I intentionally did *not* import the whole `sage_bootstrap` package just because `sage-uncompress-spkg` in case of Python 2.6 needs the `argparse` module (and only that) from `.../compat/` in my patch.

----

Could you add a `.contains_garbage()` property in order to not pass the whole list of all files in a tarball to `.extractall()` if it returns `False` (which is the normal case -- it should IMHO error out unless given some option to override that otherwise, or *at least* give a warning).

As is, it essentially does

```sh
tar xf $TARBALL $( tar tf $TARBALL | cat )
```

or, worse (and more explicit),

```sh
gunzip -c $TARBALL | tar xf - $( gunzip -c $TARBALL | tar tf - | cat )
```

in the normal (non-error) case, where `gunzip` will be `bunzip2` if `$TARBALL` ends with `.bz2` instead of `.gz`; since you're also building a dictionary, `cat` here doesn't even properly reflect the no-op processing of all filenames in the archive (it would have to be some more complex identity function).

\\

You could in addition rename `.names()` to `.valid_names()` say, and add another function `.invalid_names()` (or `.names()` returning *all* names) or whatever (such that it is possible to obtain the ones filtered out, or at least see whether any files got filtered out, but if we give an error or warning message, that should contain *which* files are considered garbage).

But completely rewriting it (or changing its structure, and adding tests etc.) does?

That's really completely unrelated to Python 2.6 support; if you're referring to the title, all we need *here* is to pick up the `argparse` module.  And it's currently a blocker ticket.

I'd suggest to put your restructuring etc. on a follow-up, where we can improve other things as well (to not say remove further regressions introduced previously).

If the latter still makes it into Sage 7.3, fine, otherwise it doesn't hurt because the main issue has already been fixed here -- quickly and safe.
