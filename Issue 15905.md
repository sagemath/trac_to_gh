In #16141, a class to collect common transducers was introduced. Here, we enhance this class by
a few more transducers which are mainly meant to be used as readily available components in cartesian products and/or compositions.

We introduce four more common transducers, `transducers.abs` realizing absolute value,
`transducers.operator` realizing binary operations, `transducers.add`, `transducers.sub` realizing addition and subtraction and at the same time illustrating the use of `transducers.operator`.

During review, I decided to extend `.operator` to arbirary opeators (not only binary). I've rewritten its docstring. I've also made a couple of changes in the docstings of `.add`, `.sub`, `.abs`.

The patch looks good; doctests pass; docs checked. So this is a positive review for me, but please review my changes first.
