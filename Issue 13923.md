Add a class for a Board (subset of entries in [0,1,..,r-1] x [0,1,...,s-1] ). Examples are 
*   Straight shape
*   Skew shape
*   Diagram of a permutation
*   Hulls of permutations

And procedures to generate:
*   placements of non-attacking rooks
*   Le diagrams.

You should make sure to provide an interface to `simplicial_complexes.ChessboardComplex(r,s)`: your `Board` class could have a `simplicial_complex` method (or something similar) which returns the complex. Actually, you could do this:

```python
    def _simplicial_(self):
        """
        Return simplicial complex version of ...
        """
        from sage.homology.examples import simplicial_complexes
        return simplicial_complexes.ChessboardComplex(self.r, self.s)  # or whatever

    simplicial_complex = _simplicial_
```

The point behind having a `_simplicial_` method is that if `B` is an instance of the `Board` class, you can then call `SimplicialComplex(B)` and it will call this method.

You also might be able to improve the implementation of the `ChessboardComplex` or the `matching` function in the same file, and that would be greatly appreciated.

Edit: I guess the `_simplicial_` method would be more appropriate on the class of all `Boards`, not for a single board. Anyway...
