# Issue 27790: Adding cyclegraph functionality to product projective dynamical systems

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28027

Original creator: @sheareralexj

Original creation time: 2019-06-20 15:22:28

Keywords: SI2019

This ticket will allow the following code to work:

```
sage: P.<a, b, c, d> = ProductProjectiveSpaces(GF(5), [1, 1])
sage: f = DynamicalSystem_projective([a^2*c, b^2*d, a*d^2, b*c^2], P)
sage: f.cyclegraph().plot()
```

This is done by adding field and finite_field subclasses to dynamical_systems in product_projective_ds.
The field subclass will be empty and the finite_field subclass will contain the cyclegraph function.

Two things here:

1) Since domain is a keyword for the dynamical system class initialization, you should use it as a keyword in you examples ``domain=P''

2) The test with 5000+ vertices is way too long for a doctest (8+s on my machine). Doctests should really be well under 1s unless there is some case that really needs that extra time to test. This just looks like a more complicated example of the same functionality too me.

Updated the examples to use "domain=P" and removed the last example completely. Thanks :)

Thanks, that fixes that. Sorry for not noticing this earlier, but why is the subscheme functionality commented out and left as a todo?

Dynamical systems for subschemes of product projective spaces needs work. Until then, this function will not be implemented for subschemes. Updated documentation to reflect this.
