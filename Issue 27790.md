Keywords: SI2019

This ticket will allow the following code to work:

```
sage: P.<a, b, c, d> = ProductProjectiveSpaces(GF(5), [1, 1])
sage: f = DynamicalSystem_projective([a^2*c, b^2*d, a*d^2, b*c^2], P)
sage: f.cyclegraph().plot()
```

This is done by adding field and finite_field subclasses to dynamical_systems in product_projective_ds.
The field subclass will be empty and the finite_field subclass will contain the cyclegraph function.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28027

Two things here:

1) Since domain is a keyword for the dynamical system class initialization, you should use it as a keyword in you examples ``domain=P''

2) The test with 5000+ vertices is way too long for a doctest (8+s on my machine). Doctests should really be well under 1s unless there is some case that really needs that extra time to test. This just looks like a more complicated example of the same functionality too me.

Dynamical systems for subschemes of product projective spaces needs work. Until then, this function will not be implemented for subschemes. Updated documentation to reflect this.
