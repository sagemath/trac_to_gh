In cryptography, the ElGamal encryption system is an asymmetric key encryption algorithm for public-key cryptography which is based on the Diffie-Hellman key exchange. It was described by Taher Elgamal in 1984. The security of the ElGamal scheme depends on the properties of the underlying group G as well as any padding scheme used on the messages.
