# Issue 28496: Reference manual SageTeX incorrect link

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28733

Original creator: kcrisman

Original creation time: 2019-11-14 12:49:26

`src/doc/en/reference/misc/sagetex.rst` has an incorrect link.   The installation guide no longer has (and hasn't had) reference to SageTeX for some time.  The link should be to the tutorial `src/doc/en/tutorial/sagetex.rst`

This looks great.  Interestingly, there are two possible links you could have used, `http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/tutorial/sagetex.html#sec-sagetex-install` also works, but that is immaterial.  Thank you very much - that is one loose end that escaped a number of years ago!
