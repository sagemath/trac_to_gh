Why not ? This seems more pythonic to me.

It took me a moment to get used to nested loops. Then I realized (and because I got errors) that languages are iterative, so it is always first-come-first-loop. I agree with Frédéric that it is more Pythonic; it is also faster too.

That method also explicitly has `list`, so it cannot be an iterator (although having something that returns an iterator would be nice, but doesn’t need to be done here).

I also find this change (and similar) looks weird:

```diff
-#####################
-# Ribbon Tableaux   #
-#####################
+# ####################
+# Ribbon Tableaux    #
+# ####################
```

Could we make an exception here?

I agree. We should leave it as it is.

On the other hand, I hope that we adopt an official style on the "boxing". Different authors are using different styles on those "title comments". I would suggest

```

# Ribbon Tableaux

```

But again this would be another issue for a vote (or no vote)...
