Some optional packages do some dependency checking in their spkg-install, for example the p_group_cohomology package does this:

```sh
SMALL_GROUPS=`echo "SmallGroup(13,1); quit;" | gap -b -T | grep "13"`
if [ "$SMALL_GROUPS" = "" ]; then
   echo "It seems that GAP's SmallGroups library is missing."
   echo "One way to install it is by doing"
   echo "    sage: install_package('database_gap')"
   echo "in a Sage session."

Will installation of pyzmq fail gracefully if zeromq is missing, or is it better to have a check like this?

Who confirmed that this was useless?  This will still not work on older Macs - see the **actual note that was in the SPKG.txt**!!!

```
   - patches/buildutils.patch: This patches the file src/buildutils/detect.py.
     It remove the option -arch for gcc which was broken on MacOSX 10.5.8.
     The reason to this is that Sage's gcc spkg does not build a compiler
     which understands the option -arch of Apple's clone of gcc.

Me. My machine is a MacOSX 10.5.8. I have read that note in the SPKG. When I did the review, I confirmed that the patch was needed with the earlier spkg but not with the new one which I gave a positive review.

I am sorry for having cause you trouble today. Maybe we should add more documentation in the patch to re-add saying for what machine exactly it is mandatory. Because to me, it is not needed for 10.5.8 anymore.

I apologize also, because I was snippy in my comment.  I had left the machine compiling all night, only to discover this (relatively early) error.

I think that the question is in when they add these flags.  What do you get for

```
import platform
platform.architecture()
```

on my Lion computer (10.7) I get `('64bit', '')`.  I will see what I get on my other one.  My guess is that probably Dima's machine was already building a 64-bit Python (see e.g. [the SAGE64 flag](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/installation/source.html)), and that in the meantime maybe your 10.5 computer also is doing that, maybe we are building Python 64-bit by default or you are using `SAGE64='yes'` all the time on that computer?

When I reported that (cf the link to sage-devel in #13313) I tried that on an PPC OSX 10.5.8 machine, which is 32-bit all the way. I don't think I did build anything with SAGE64.
