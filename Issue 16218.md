The tarball you found at `http://download.zeromq.org/zeromq-4.0.4.tar.gz` is not a sage package, it is the source code of zeromq. You have to put this tarball on your `/Users/slabbe/Applications/sage-review/upstream/` directory, and then do `./sage -f zeromq`.

The first command will lead to an error, since it not only tries to download the tarball in upstream/, but also tries to install it as a sage spkg, explaining your error, hence you should consider using wget ot curl for that part of the review. Of course, once the ticket is merged, there is no need to download the tarball manually since sage will find it at http://sagemath.org/packages/upstream/

Some optional packages do some dependency checking in their spkg-install, for example the p_group_cohomology package does this:

```sh
SMALL_GROUPS=`echo "SmallGroup(13,1); quit;" | gap -b -T | grep "13"`
if [ "$SMALL_GROUPS" = "" ]; then
   echo "It seems that GAP's SmallGroups library is missing."

   echo "in a Sage session."

Will installation of pyzmq fail gracefully if zeromq is missing, or is it better to have a check like this?

```
   - patches/buildutils.patch: This patches the file src/buildutils/detect.py.
     It remove the option -arch for gcc which was broken on MacOSX 10.5.8.
     The reason to this is that Sage's gcc spkg does not build a compiler
     which understands the option -arch of Apple's clone of gcc.

Me. My machine is a MacOSX 10.5.8. I have read that note in the SPKG. When I did the review, I confirmed that the patch was needed with the earlier spkg but not with the new one which I gave a positive review.

I am sorry for having cause you trouble today. Maybe we should add more documentation in the patch to re-add saying for what machine exactly it is mandatory. Because to me, it is not needed for 10.5.8 anymore.

I apologize also, because I was snippy in my comment.  I had left the machine compiling all night, only to discover this (relatively early) error.

I think that the question is in when they add these flags.  What do you get for

```
import platform
platform.architecture()
```

on my Lion computer (10.7) I get `('64bit', '')`.  I will see what I get on my other one.  My guess is that probably Dima's machine was already building a 64-bit Python (see e.g. [the SAGE64 flag](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/installation/source.html)), and that in the meantime maybe your 10.5 computer also is doing that, maybe we are building Python 64-bit by default or you are using `SAGE64='yes'` all the time on that computer? In principle if you don't have the patch but you get `if platform.architecture()[0]=='32bit':` then you should be getting the bad Apple-gcc-only flags.

When I reported that (cf the link to sage-devel in #13313) I tried that on an PPC OSX 10.5.8 machine, which is 32-bit all the way. I don't think I did build anything with SAGE64.
