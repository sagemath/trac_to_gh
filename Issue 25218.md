What is "incomplete" mean with regards to this ticket?

It means that there remains something like 3 issues, that I was unsure how to fix..

I haven't tested these, but here's my quick thoughts.

- The `tester` in `root_system.py` looks like you can just remove it.
- You can remove the block about marked nodes (that is handled by `_latex_draw_node`).
- I suspect the whole `CartanType_affine._repr_` is redundant (or the main one is not being properly overwritten).

This is good for now; we can always do more on a followup.
