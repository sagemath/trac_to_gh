Replying to [comment:4 vbraun]:
> Its pretty much a no-brainer. Ready for review?
Not sure.  The following is fairly reproducible when interrupting GAP:

```
Interrupting Gap...
Exception RuntimeError: RuntimeError('maximum recursion depth exceeded while calling a Python object',) in  ignored
Exception RuntimeError: RuntimeError('maximum recursion depth exceeded while calling a Python object',) in  ignored
Exception RuntimeError: RuntimeError('maximum recursion depth exceeded while calling a Python object',) in  ignored
[...ad infinitum...]
```

The backtrace at this point (thanks to #14029) is attached.

The problem was removing the statement

```
self._session_number = -1
```


New patch attached which should fix this.  I also changed a few more instances of

```
except StandardError:
```

to

```
except BaseException:
```

in cases where the except-clause was doing cleanup + re-raise.
