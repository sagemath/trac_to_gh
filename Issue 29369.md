ecl is already providing our LDFLAGS for linking to maxima.

The second copy is overquoted and causes an error when building within conda.

Looking at #29327, `LDFLAGS` are actually in triplicate. Normally that shouldn't be an issue but the overquoting definitely can be. Sounds reasonable enough but we should monitor this each time we upgrade `ecl` to spot possible changes in behavior.
