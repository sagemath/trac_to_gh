For a given bipartite graph, `.complement()` method is supposed to complement it in K<sub>p,q</sub> and return a bipartite graph, where p and q are the size of partite sets. However, at the moment it seems to treat a given bipartite graph as generic and complements it in K<sub>p+q</sub> instead and result in a non-bipartite graph.



```
B = BipartiteGraph( [(0,1),(0,2), (0,3)] )
print( B.complement().is_bipartite() )
```

Since #12376,  the behavior of `complement` for `BipartiteGraph` is to take the complement of in the complete graph and not in the complete bipartite graph. 

We have several options here:
- change the current behavior to return the complement of the complete bipartite graph as a `BipartiteGraph`
- add a method `bipartite_complement` as proposed in [12376#comment:3](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/12376#comment:3) to do so
- add a parameter to `complement` to select whether the complement is taken from the complete graph (and a `Graph` is returned) or from a complete bipartite graph (returning a `BipartiteGraph`)

Replying to [comment:2 dcoudert]:
> Since #12376, the behavior of `complement` for `BipartiteGraph` is to take the complement of in the complete graph and not in the complete bipartite graph. 

That isn't quite correct IIRC. #12376 is fixing a bug with the type of the output, not changing the behavior. AFAIK we have not had a complement as a bipartite graph function in Sage previously.

> - change the current behavior to return the complement of the complete bipartite graph as a `BipartiteGraph`

I am a strong -1 on this because `BipartiteGraph` is a subclass of `Graph`, and methods of subclasses should not (without a *very* good reason) change the behavior.

> - add a method `bipartite_complement` as proposed in [12376#comment:3](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/12376#comment:3) to do so

I would go with this option to have better separations of concerns and the corresponding attribute error when it is just a `Graph` is also useful.

> - add a parameter to `complement` to select whether the complement is taken from the complete graph (and a `Graph` is returned) or from a complete bipartite graph (returning a `BipartiteGraph`)

This could work as well, but I would prefer option 2.

Side note: The complete bipartite graph constructor should return a `BipartiteGraph` object IMO (instead of just a usual `Graph`).

How about `complement_bipartite` rather than
`bipartite_complement`?

That might enhance tab-completion discovery.

Or add SEEALSO in `complement` docs advertising
`bipartite_complement`.

I added method `complement_bipartite` and expanded the documentation of `complement`.

The dependency on #33249 is to get the corrected `__init__` and the one on #33260` is mostly to get the import of itertools.
