Isn't it just an instance of #22029? Even if they are a bit special, real litterals are elements of RR...

From the ticket description of #22029 it is hard to tell. But I believe that the answer is yes.

This is because of

```
sage: coercion_model.canonical_coercion(RBF(0), -1.0)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

   1279 
   1280 

TypeError: no common canonical parent for objects with parents: 'Real ball field with 53 bits of precision' and 'Real Field with 53 bits of precision'
```


So it's indeed sort-of a duplicate of #22029.
