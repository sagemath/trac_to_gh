# Issue 27081: Factoring univariate polynomials over function fields

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27318

Original creator: swewers

Original creation time: 2019-02-18 23:47:57

CC:  saraedum

Keywords: function fields, polynomials, factorization

The following gives a NotImplementedError:


```python
  sage: F0.<x> = FunctionField(GF(3))
  sage: R.<y> = F0[]
  sage: F.<y> = F0.extension(y^2 - x)
  sage: S.<t> = F[] 
  sage: f = t^2 - x
  sage: f.factor()
```


I have some very simple code that I could add which solves this temporarily. It uses prime factorization in multivariate polynomial rings, and so implicitly uses Groebner bases. While there are certainly much better approaches, say, for function fields over finite fields, this code would already be very helpful.

I just noticed that #16572 does this already, but it depends on some thing that have not yet been successfully reviewed.

Ticket retargeted after milestone closed (if you don't believe this ticket is appropriate for the Sage 8.8 release please retarget manually)

A bad implementation is better than none in this case. If you want to propose a fix, I am happy to review it. (And I'll try not to take 7 weeks to do soâ€¦)

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).

This is a duplicate of #16572.
