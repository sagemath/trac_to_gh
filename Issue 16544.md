# Issue 16544: Implementation of floordiv is incorrect for polynomials over finite fields

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: cremona

Original creation time: 2014-08-07 19:55:53

Keywords: polynomial division

As reported on sage-devel, the following is incorrect:

```
sage: F = GF(47)
sage: x = polygen(F)
sage: u = F(1)
sage: x//u
0
```

since `x//u` should give the quotient after dividing x by u.   

Volker Braun revealed that this is caused by a bug in Polynomial_zmod_flint, causing the remainder to be returned instead of the quotient:


```
sage: F = GF(47) 
sage: x = polygen(F) 
sage: u = F(1) 
sage: x.quo_rem(u)
(x, 0)
sage: x // u    # should be quo
0
sage: x % u     # is rem
0
```

Could you be more careful with

```
sage: 1 // x
0
```

and actually test the parent of the "0" you got?
