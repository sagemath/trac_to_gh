# Issue 14189: Clean SAGE_ROOT from module_list.py (again)

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14393

A few tickets have been using SAGE_ROOT directly or not used SAGE_INC since my last clean up. After cleaning direct calls to SAGE_ROOT in the rest of sage we need to spend some time here.

The use of SAGE_INC has also been normalized everywhere so it is not necessary to add a final "/". The use of predefined depend variables has been enforced as much as I could see it.

It has been bothering me for a while that a few people have been using naked SAGE_ROOT in there.

Could you have a look at this Christopher? I was hoping Andrew would be interested but he must be busy elsewhere. I'd very much want to see this in 5.9.

Looks good to me. Do you want me to test it as well? I could do this at the weekend.

It should be done properly, so yes testing. Testing is the only way to see if I missed something, which I don't think I did.

I checked with beta2; patch applies cleanly and the build is fine.

OK I put it in positive review then.

You only missed one instance (#14531), for an optional spkg.
