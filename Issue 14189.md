A few tickets have been using SAGE_ROOT directly or not used SAGE_INC since my last clean up. After cleaning direct calls to SAGE_ROOT in the rest of sage we need to spend some time here.

The use of SAGE_INC has also been normalized everywhere so it is not necessary to add a final "/". The use of predefined depend variables has been enforced as much as I could see it.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14393

It has been bothering me for a while that a few people have been using naked SAGE_ROOT in there.

Could you have a look at this Christopher? I was hoping Andrew would be interested but he must be busy elsewhere. I'd very much want to see this in 5.9.
