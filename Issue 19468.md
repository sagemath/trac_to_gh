No, our department bought a POWER8 machine to play with. See #19701.

I will unfortunately not get my hands on such gear. But I'd like to point you to point you to [Advance Toolchain for PowerLinux Documentation](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en#!/wiki/W51a7ffcf4dfd_4b40_9d82_446ebc23c550/page/IBM) in case whoever in your department doesn't know about it.
