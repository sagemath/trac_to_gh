You are right, it *is* only generated when `interrupt.pyx` is Cythonized.

That's not a problem however: if you delete the `build` directory, then `interrupt.pyx` will be Cythonized and the file will be generated.

I really don't understand your problem.

Deleting the `src/build` directory in Sage is the same as `make clean` in a typical software package. And when you do `make clean`, you have to rebuild everything if you do `make` later.

And when you *don't* delete the `build` directory, Cython+distutils has proper dependency checking: only needed files are rebuilt.

I'll surely open a follow up ticket about that `build` directory question once I have figured out to deal with it. I am not completely sure you have totally broken all "global" sage install and whether or not making those install carry at least a fragment of the build folder will fix it properly.
Who else needs to have their build folder kept?

It wouldn't be too hard to install all needed files, it's just that somebody has to do it.
