```
+        sage: g = JankoKharaghani(1800)              # not tested (30s)
+        sage: g.is_strongly_regular(parameters=True) # not tested (30s)
+        (936, 375, 150, 150)
```

As e.g. `MathonStronglyRegularGraph` is in graphs/generators/smallgraphs.py, this one should also be there, don't you think so?
We don't have any "named graphs" in graphs/strongly_regular_db.pyx, and let's keep it this way, OK?

Hmmmm.... Okay... I admit that I don't like much to have in `graphs.<tab>` a constructor that nobody will never call, but well... Okay `:-/`

We perhaps should also think where H should go, in a special row of cages in Hadamard Zoo, maybe...

Hmmm?? It looks far too specific to me.

Would you mind if I add the v=324 case from them to this ticket?

OK, I guess it's faster to do another ticket. This one is good to go.
