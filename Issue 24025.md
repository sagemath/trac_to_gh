On Debian 8.1.rc2 + #24240, compiles without difficulty.

* fix ex.coefficients() bugs (#23545, #24147) : yes
* fix interface to Singular GCD (#23845) : yes. The planned doctest don't seem to have been added.
* fix compiler warnings : I still get :

* asin/atan enhancements (#24211) : partial fix :

```
sage: [arcsin(t) for t in [0, 1/2, sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(3)/2, 1]] # Fixed
[0, 1/6*pi, 1/4*pi, 1/3*pi, 1/2*pi]
sage: [arctan(t) for t in [0, 1/sqrt(3), 1, sqrt(3)]] # Fixed
[0, 1/6*pi, 1/4*pi, 1/3*pi]
sage: [arccos(t) for t in [0, 1/2, sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(3)/2, 1]] # Partially fixed
[1/2*pi, 1/3*pi, arccos(1/2*sqrt(2)), arccos(1/2*sqrt(3)), 0]
sage: [arccot(t) for t in [0, 1/sqrt(3), 1, sqrt(3)]] # Partially fixed
[1/2*pi, arccot(1/3*sqrt(3)), 1/4*pi, arccot(sqrt(3))]
```

 The simplifications are not fixed either (but I'm not sure they could be by pynac's upgrade...) :

```
sage: assume(-pi/2<x, x<pi/2)
sage: arctan(sin(x)/cos(x)).simplify() # Not fixed
arctan(sin(x)/cos(x))
sage: arctan(sin(x)/cos(x)).simplify_full() # Not fixed
arctan(sin(x)/cos(x))
```


* set_of_all() function (#24176) : can't test directly. Doctest ?
* upgrade ax_cxx_compile_stdcxx_11.m4 : I dont't know how to test. Doctest ?
* Your name needs to go in the `Authors` field.

`make ptestlong` gives me one (non-transient) failure :

They need to be fixed by updating Flint, as I have submitted the fix to Flint some time ago.

Sorry but you didn't report that. Of course I'll add it soon.

I have pointed out already that `simplify` omissions are basically Maxima's.

Well, see #24176.

This is a Pynac build enhancement.

Done.

What do you mean with "non-transient"? "non-transient using make ptestlong" or "non-transient using sage -t manually"? I cannot reproduce using sage -t on OpenSuSE, so this might be system-specific, or it might be make ptestlong-specific.
