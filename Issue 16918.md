Huh - and the pip would be quite useful.    But even in the chunk you show, 

```
if [ "$1" = '-i' ]; then
     shift
     # If there are no further arguments, simply list all installed

This should even be documented somewhere, but maybe it hasn't been advertised well lately?  Not that it would be horrible to add this alias, though I don't know if some syntax warriors will complain because you allow `-installed` while `--installed` is the current vogue...

Hello,

Thanks for having a look.

I do not complain that `sage -i` has not been advertised. But I do that it is documented nowhere (neither in `src/bin/sage` nor in `src/bin/sage-pkg`)!

Currently we have the options `-optional`, `-standard` and `-experimental`. I am just adding an additional `-installed`. We can be smarter and more coherent by allowing multiple arguments and force to use the `-i` option like in

```
    $ sage -i --installed --optional --standard
    ... would list all installed package that are either ...
    ... optional or standard                             ...
    $ sage -i --not-installed
    ... would list all non installed packages ...
```

I am in favour of a more coherent scheme of options, but then we should forbid the older syntax (and instead write a deprecation message that explains the new syntax).

And I definitely do not understand why we do have two scripts (`src/bin/sage-spkg` and `src/bin/sage-list-packages`) for dealing with packages. Morever the current state is that `sage-spkg` is used to list the installed packages while `sage-list-packages` is the one to list the optional packages...

EDIT: and I just noticed that the `sage -i` starts with a useless line 'Currently installed packages:'. It is especially bad if you want to use it in other scripts.

Vincent

Alas, I can only point things out when it comes to these scripts - I am reluctant to tread on such long-standing traditions.  I do hope some others come to look at this, though, since at the very least it is not bad to add `-installed`.

Use spaces, not TABs for indentation.

Instead of `[ ! $(sage -installed | grep -c '^pip-') -eq 1 ]`,
I would go with `[ -x "$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/pip" ]`

And why not replace `echo "Pip is not installed. Run \"sage -i pip\" to install it."` by `sage -i pip || exit $?`?

done. It is much simpler, thanks.

I do not like to do things in a script that users did not ask for.

If you deprecate something, it should still work (i.e. don't remove the old code, just add the `echo` statements).

Also, please use `echo >&2` for these warnings.
