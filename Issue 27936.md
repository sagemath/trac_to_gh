We want to implement a function that checks whether a dynamical system is conjugate to a map of the form `f(z) = z - p(z)/p'(z)` where p is a square free polynomial.

1. The NotImplementedError ("Degree one Newton maps are trivial.") should not start with a capital letter and shouldn't end with punctuation

2. Small note: 
`tuple([Npoly.derivative(z) == (z - N_aff[0]).denominator(), M])`
is much more clear as
`Npoly.derivative(z) == (z - N_aff[0]).denominator(), M`

3. This try except:


```
try:
    Fbar = self.change_ring(QQbar)
except ValueError:
    Fbar = self.change_ring(self.base_ring().embeddings(QQbar)[0])
```


is redundant. `self.change_ring(QQbar)` will pick an embedding if one isn't provided, not raise a ValueError (see `is_postcritically_finite()` for an example of this behavior)

4. This function should probably check to make sure `self` is a map from P1 to P1. Right now, `sigma_1 = self.sigma_invariants(1)` raises a `NotImplementedError`, but if that changes in the future, this function will break unexpectedly somewhere

5. One other very small thing: `.is_Newton(return_conjugation=True)` returns either the boolean `false`, or a tuple of `(true, matrix)`. Maybe it should return `(false, None)` on failure, so that unwrapping (like `is_n, mat = ....is_Newton(return_conjugation=True)`) still works (see `is_periodic(return_period=True)` for an example of a similar situation)

A more mathematical problem: Why does this function go to field extensions to find conjugations? e.g.:


```
A.<z> = AffineSpace(QQ, 1)
f = DynamicalSystem_affine([z - (z^3 + 2*z)/(3*z^2 + 2)])
M = Matrix([[1, 2], [2, 1]])
F = f.homogenize(1).conjugate(M)

bl, mat = F.is_Newton(return_conjugation=True)
print mat
print mat.parent()
# gives:
[-1/3*a    2/3]
[ 2/3*a   -1/3]

Full MatrixSpace of 2 by 2 dense matrices over Number Field in a with defining polynomial y^2 + 2
```


Shouldn't it be able to find the inverse of the conjugation by `M`, in this example?
