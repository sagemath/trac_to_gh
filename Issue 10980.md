Could you attach the full log? We should at least have a look at what happened during configure.

Comment by mhansen created at 2011-04-04 14:00:18

I believe fixing it is just a matter of including `sys/stat.h` in that file on Cygwin.

Would make sense. Is upstream aware of this? Also, was there any issue with ecl-10.4.1?
I may have a look at making yet again another ecl-11.1.1 spkg when I have a bit of time.

no, this redefines a bunch of stuff and does not compile as a result.

oops, please ignore this. Adding the include to libraries.d fixes this particular problem.

The next one is in c/numbers/cos.d:

apparently, all this is caused by a new Cygwin:

indeed, it's just that /usr/include/fenv.h is not protected from double inclusion.
Adding 

```
#define _FENV_H_
```

into its first lines fixes the problem, and ecl builds!
I'll notify upstream (cygwin) on this.
If this is not fixed in cygwin itself, then it's of course trivial to fix in the ecl code.

they were quick:

so the fenv.h problem will be fixed in the coming release; meanwhile feel free to edit the system header :)

This (adding the include in sys/stat.h) appears to work fine on XP!

Here's what's needed for positive review, I think.

 * Make an spkg with that change, that includes information to deprecate for newer Cygwin (or that has a switch for different versions with a patching in the old case).
 * Testing the spkg on XP.
 * Testing the spkg on 7.

Ok, spkg available at [http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/kcrisman/ecl-11.1.1.p2.spkg](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/kcrisman/ecl-11.1.1.p2.spkg).  

Also, of course testing on non-Cygwin systems welcome!  If this doesn't fix Dima's Windows 7 issue, I still think that we have to do something like this, because the latest available Cygwin for download is from before his email exchange, even.  So it will take time for that fix to be available.

On Windows 7, I get the same failure as Dima (it does get past the failure noted on Mike's patch).

What is the way to fix this in ECL itself, given that a new Cygwin is not currently available?

hunt down the corresponding #includes and remove them.
(the problem is that there is a fair amount of C code generation going on, and you really don't want to know how exactly it happens)

Comment by kcrisman created at 2011-06-28 02:17:13

Good news - the double include that is the problem in the traceback above (cos.d) is fixed [here](http://ecls.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/ecls/ecl/src/h/impl/math_fenv.h?r1=1.5&r2=1.6).  Literally "Avoid including fenv.h twice".

So this is fixed in an upstream unstable release as well.  I'll try to make a new spkg with this once I test it, assuming there are no other problems.  Obviously it's best to have _both_ fixes, but at least one is good.


---

Comment by kcrisman created at 2011-06-28 02:33:02

Another similar error... but again good news, because at the same time Juanjo must have also fixed a very similar problem in c/unixint.d [here](http://ecls.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/ecls/ecl/src/c/unixint.d?r1=1.102&r2=1.103).  I'll include that in any spkg as well.


---

Comment by kcrisman created at 2011-06-28 02:46:27

And the original failure Mike reported, as well as the fix with including sys/stat.h, is fixed in CVS [here](http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=From_jjgarcia%40users.sourceforge.net_Sat_Mar_05_22%3A40%3A25_2011&forum_name=ecls-cvs).


---

Comment by kcrisman created at 2011-06-28 02:49:30

Okay, these three fixes combined allow ECL to build properly on Windows 7.  Assuming there isn't a new ECL coming along immediately (and assuming we don't want to mess with trying to upgrade it immediately anyway, save the Maxima issue) I may make a new spkg just for this.


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2011-06-28 02:56:47

If you are going to make a new spkg we may as well address #11359 as well. I probably could push a maxima-5.24.0 spkg at the same time if I am not too lazy.


---

Comment by kcrisman created at 2011-06-28 03:13:41

Ummm... I really don't know anything about that ticket, and it seems much more intrusive.  These three patches are all very small from upstream.    I'm going to stick with just addressing this.  You can always try to do a one on that ticket that takes these into account, of course!  Hopefully someone can review this one soon.

Ready for review - spkg available at [http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/kcrisman/ecl-11.1.1.p3.spkg](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/kcrisman/ecl-11.1.1.p3.spkg).

User "RegB" was able to use this successfully for this - see [this sage-windows thread](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-windows/browse_thread/thread/b7d6ed4902914726).  

So this just needs someone to look at the actual spkg.


---

Comment by kcrisman created at 2011-07-29 19:25:14

That is, this needs someone _other than me_ to look at the actual spkg and its construction :) - should be very easy.

That was on Vista, just FYI, but that should be okay for this ticket.


---

Comment by kcrisman created at 2011-08-01 15:34:18

Just a comment FYI: I have gotten Sage to start on Cygwin, and anything using the ECL library (as opposed to just plain old ECL or Maxima as binaries) fails with 

```
ImportError: No such process
```

That would be a separate ticket, of course, but just wanted to point it out.


---

Comment by kcrisman created at 2011-08-01 15:40:28

Sorry for the noise - that seems to be with the current p2 spkg, not the p3 spkg here.   I'm not sure how it is that ECL and Maxima nonetheless work, but must be an XP thing...


---

Comment by kcrisman created at 2011-08-01 15:48:56

And again noise... the p2 is also here, don't know how I didn't realize that.  Anyway, there is an `ecl.dll` in both `sage/local/bin/` and `sage/local/lib/`, but not all the .a files in `libs/ecl/` are thus.  Since I know nothing about .a files, I don't know whether that would be a problem, though.

a .a file is typically a static object library, i.e. something one links against. It shouldn't be needed at the runtime, typically
(unless you want to rebuild things on the fly).
You can check the type of the file by using Cygwin's "file" command.
(i.e. somethign like

```
     $ file output.pdf 
    output.pdf: PDF document, version 1.4
```

Comment by kcrisman created at 2011-08-01 16:18:36

It turns out that this (unrelated) failure is already know, from over a year ago - see #9167.  Unfortunately, in the meantime the library is the default way to interact with ECL and Maxima, so this is much more serious now.

PS - feel free to unpack the spkg and check it's made correctly to finish positive review here :)


---

Comment by kcrisman created at 2011-08-22 13:23:58

I just checked and there is no garbage.

I'm also attaching the diffs for the p2 and p3 spkgs.  Should be a REALLY easy task to finish the review now :)

I should also point out that these changes are all in ECL cvs, so applying the patches universally should not be a problem (don't need to only apply on Cygwin).

There is also a typo in a comment in the spkg-install ("is in" instead of "are in") but this should _really_ not affect the review.

Ooopsie! There's a few .DS_Store files from OS X in the sources. I'll remove these in my .p4 but it would be good if they were gone from this one in case #11708 doesn't move in 4.7.2.

```

Just shoot me now.  It's as if I can't avoid this.  I don't even know if I _went_ into all these directories, much less changed anything.


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2011-09-14 02:04:17

Recipe:
 * make a spkg, foo.spkg
 * keep the foo/ folder
 * tar tjf foo.spkg | grep Store
 * if nothing shows up you are good to go
 * if something shows up

```
tar tjf foo.spkg | grep Store | xargs rm
```

 * recreate foo.spkg

Hope that helps. It looks like I won't be making a new spkg unless we find a way to avoid a gcc problem in ecl source.

Comment by kcrisman created at 2011-10-14 03:32:43

Maybe I should just make a new spkg that we can set back to positive review... 

Also, see #11884 for yet another ECL upgrade ticket.   To wit:

```
> I got this to build by pulling from their latest repository:
> git clone git://ecls.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/ecls/ecl
```

which could be helpful in order to finally fix #11502/#11260, if the change in the use of forking is in there...

I'd say go ahead, such that others can base new ECL spkgs on this one.

Perhaps also take into account [comment:ticket:11708:54 this comment]. :P




> Also, see #11884 for yet another ECL upgrade ticket.

Well, there doesn't seem to be any progress on that ticket; at least Maxima is said to not work or build on MacOS X 10.7 yet, even with the ECL git snapshot (which version?).

Okay, same location.

Umm, I think I'll pass.  Then I would feel like I had to retest it on several platforms, and I simply don't have the time currently.

Clean bill of health:

Probably too much to ask for 4.7.2, but one can hope...

Resolution: fixed


---

Comment by leif created at 2011-10-31 21:59:52

In case no follow-up spkg fixes this (and gets merged into the same release), the spkg *needs work*, because the *exit codes of `patch` aren't checked* at all.  (Cf. #11884)


---

Comment by kcrisman created at 2011-11-01 01:15:22

Disagree.  Sure, we should start adding this to spkgs, and yes it is good that #11884 should have it changed since no one noticed it otherwise, but it is just too onerous to keep adding requirements like this when even someone pretty savvy about builds like François didn't notice this - particularly because the ECL package, like *many* other packages, didn't have it before!  It's not like people are intentionally trying to remove checking of exit codes.  

Like a lot of other things, if we ever want Sage to actually improve, we have to strike a balance between these kinds of things.  In this case, under what circumstances would the exit code make a difference?  Only if someone updates the spkg... which is being dealt with at #11884, at least I hope so.   

Unless you are suggesting that we should immediately make blocker tickets for every spkg which has patches without checking the exit code of `patch` :) but given our testing regimen, doing it as we notice it seems just fine, especially as not everyone has the expertise to do this quickly.

Karl-Dieter: which `tar` program did you use to create the spkg?  There are two strange things:

1. When extracting with GNU tar, I get

```
tar: Ignoring unknown extended header keyword `SCHILY.dev'
tar: Ignoring unknown extended header keyword `SCHILY.ino'
tar: Ignoring unknown extended header keyword `SCHILY.nlink'
tar: Ignoring unknown extended header keyword `SCHILY.dev'
tar: Ignoring unknown extended header keyword `SCHILY.ino'
tar: Ignoring unknown extended header keyword `SCHILY.nlink'
tar: Ignoring unknown extended header keyword `SCHILY.dev'
tar: Ignoring unknown extended header keyword `SCHILY.ino'
tar: Ignoring unknown extended header keyword `SCHILY.nlink'
tar: Ignoring unknown extended header keyword `SCHILY.dev'
tar: Ignoring unknown extended header keyword `SCHILY.ino'
tar: Ignoring unknown extended header keyword `SCHILY.nlink'
tar: Ignoring unknown extended header keyword `SCHILY.dev'
tar: Ignoring unknown extended header keyword `SCHILY.ino'
tar: Ignoring unknown extended header keyword `SCHILY.nlink'
tar: Ignoring unknown extended header keyword `SCHILY.dev'
tar: Ignoring unknown extended header keyword `SCHILY.ino'
tar: Ignoring unknown extended header keyword `SCHILY.nlink'
tar: Ignoring unknown extended header keyword `SCHILY.dev'
tar: Ignoring unknown extended header keyword `SCHILY.ino'
tar: Ignoring unknown extended header keyword `SCHILY.nlink'
```


2. The entries in the tar file are sorted in a weird way, for example the contents of `src/examples/` comes way later than the directory `src/examples/`.  This has consequences for the modification time of the extracted directories.  Adding the option `--delay-directory-restore` when extracting solves the issue.

I am _not_ at all saying the spkg needs to be changed, I am mainly curious.  And it also made me aware of the option `--delay-directory-restore` of GNU tar.

Jeroen, are you 100% sure you used GNU tar? Such things are known to appear when you run an old BSD tar (like one you have on old MacOSX)
e.g.:

Thanks for the link and it is *exactly* the issue I was talking about.  I think you misunderstood my question: I was talking about _extracting_ with GNU tar.  So, presumably, Karl-Dieter used BSD tar to _create_ the archive.  This is not a big issue, just something that I was unaware of.

Is this a problem I'll need to deal with?  As far as I know, I created this on a modern Mac, but it's still BSD:

```
%man tar
BSDTAR(1)                 BSD General Commands Manual                BSDTAR(1)

NAME
     tar -- manipulate tape archives

SYNOPSIS
     tar [bundled-flags <args>] [<file> | <pattern> ...]
     tar {-c} [options] [files | directories]
     tar {-r | -u} -f archive-file [options] [files | directories]
     tar {-t | -x} [options] [patterns]

DESCRIPTION
     tar creates and manipulates streaming archive files.  This implementation
     can extract from tar, pax, cpio, zip, jar, ar, and ISO 9660 cdrom images
     and can create tar, pax, cpio, ar, and shar archives.
```

It's a lot more tedious for me to make tars on sage.math.  Presumably I'm not the only person to make spkgs on Mac, though, and I do use `sage -pkg` to do them - I only use `tar` to unpack things, in general.

No, it's a problem *I* have to deal with :-)  In all seriousness, it's not really a problem, I just need to be aware of this and use the `--delay-directory-restore` option to extract spkgs.

Spkg is gone, so this can't be merged anymore...

I moved the Authors/Reviewers to #11884.

Resolution changed from fixed to duplicate

Well, it presumably still lives on in alpha0.  That's why I deleted it!  So it already _was_ merged in an existing alpha, I don't see how this changes things.

Plus, the fixes are in the new upstream used at #11884.

Anyway, I hope these comments clarify it FWIW.
