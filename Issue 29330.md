While building the doc there are messages of the kind

```

It is apparently caused by jinja and python 3.6+. The guilty escape sequences should be put in raw strings.

I remember discussing it in a previous sphinx (1.8) ticket. We had those all over the place. They seem to have reduced. The branch tckle the two I still see in sage-on-gentoo but there could be other masked by one of my patches.

There are others, but I don't think they come from the Sage library:

```
[repl     ] <unknown>:181: DeprecationWarning: invalid escape sequence \)
[repl     ] <unknown>:365: DeprecationWarning: invalid escape sequence \w
```

Is this ready for review? If so, feel free to give it a positive review from me.

Those are funny. I see them in vanilla sage but not in sage-on-gentoo. It would be nice to figure them out one day. All I could see under `repl` was already properly made into a raw string.

If you don't have any more clue about it I guess we should already go with the one that are fixed here.

I think they come from IPython, so upgrading that should help: #28550#comment:2

I am on ipython-7.5 in sage-on-gentoo, that would explain why I don't see them there. I completely missed that ticket.
