It looks okay to me, but I'm not sure what function Pillow serves within Sage, so it's hard to know if it's actually working. I did try it with the new matplotlib, which apparently uses it instead of `libpng` for all of its plotting, and things looked good when I created some sample plots. I'm going to mark it as "positive review" since it's an upgrade to an existing package and it appears to work.

Thanks! Yes, as far as I know, it's only used by matplotlib.

FWIW: My search of the src directory indicates that SageTeX is the only other package that has pillow as a dependency.
