# Issue 27947: Multiple import of Word

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28184

Original creator: enadeau

CC:  nadialafreniere slabbe

Keywords: word

In `sage/combinat/words/finite_word.py` the `Word` function is imported many time inside the definition of many functions (e.g. `length_maximal_palindrome` of `defect`).

I'm not sure of the point of this. Would it be better to import it once in the header of the file?
