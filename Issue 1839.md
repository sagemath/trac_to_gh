A couple remarks:

* is this script still destructive? In that care it should be mentioned in the help
* the script does deal with spkgs and not tars per se - maybe the help in sage-sage should be changed?

Other than we might want to add a -crapall option since that is likely the default way one would deploy such a script, i.e. before a release. Maybe even adding a crap score might be a good thing :)

Cheers,

Michael
