For testing purposes, or just to have the latest GCC, some people might prefer GCC-4.7.1 over the Sage-shipped GCC-4.6.3.

Also

```
The following languages will be built: c,c++,fortran,java,lto,objc
...
```

(Ubuntu 10.04 x86_64)

Don't know whether that's intended.

FWIW, R 2.14.0 still fails to build (segfault when byte-compiling package "base") with GCC 4.7.1 and `-O3`, like it did with [FSF GCC] 4.7.0, at least on Ubuntu x86_64.




More related to this ticket (or the GCC spkg in general), ECL somehow gets confused if the "native" GCC has libffi, and fails to build because the spkg's GCC doesn't provide it (and ECL doesn't build its own either).

But maybe my installation is somehow "messed up", or at least untypical:

While `ffi.h` is located in `/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/4.{6.3,7.0}/include/`, the libraries (including unversioned `.so`s) are installed in `/usr/{lib,lib32}/`; the original Ubuntu GCC 4.4.3 doesn't come with libffi.

Ah, while writing, I did again take a closer look at the build logs...  The following should certainly get fixed:

```

(Note the `CPP` setting; `gcc` is `$SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/gcc`.)

It's rather luck that only the ECL spkg is affected; we should either set `CPP` properly or unset it (before `sage-env` is called) if we're using Sage's GCC.

Similar is probably true for `FC`, `F77` etc.:


```sh
$ ./sage --sh -c 'env | egrep -w "CC|CPP|CXX|FC|F77"' 
CPP=cpp-4.7.0
F77=gfortran-4.7.0
CXX=g++
FC=gfortran-4.7.0
CC=gcc
```

(I don't set `F95` and the like, others may perhaps.)

# Override CC and CXX if the gcc spkg was installed.

    CC=gcc

Don't know whether that interferes / is consistent with the `SAGE_FORTRAN` variable and/or the odd `sage_fortran` script (which should IMHO get removed anyway).

Setting / overriding `OBJC` etc. may not be necessary at the moment, but certainly would make sense, too, if we build compilers for more languages (as is currently the case with the GCC 4.7.x spkg).
