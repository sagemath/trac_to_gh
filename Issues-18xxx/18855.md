There is no easy way to get the set of edges in a `breadth_first_search` traversal of the graph.
What about an optional parameter so it also return a set of edges of some breadth first search?

Similarly, for the other set of searches too. 
This is useful if there are information stored on the edges instead of vertices.

```

a----b--\
 \   |   \
  \--c----d
```


If we do a breadth first search from `a`, one of the possible breadth first search trees is

```

a----b--\
 \       \
  \--c    d
```

The edges in the tree are ab, ac, bd. The function should return those edges.

<a id='comment:20'></a>Some more comments

- you must document parameter edges

- you must document the fact that some combinations of parameters are not possible like `edges=True` and `report_distance=True`

- some spaces are needed for the quality of the code. See http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#python-code-style for more details

```diff

- We usually use `ValueError` and not `Exception` and I think it is more appropriate here
- in the `TESTS::` block, can you add a test showing that the error is raised in such case
- at the end of the method, you added 2 extra empty lines before `def depth_first_search`. There is no need for that.

I just checked again, it was actually a single error which is related to 

```
OperationalError: unable to open database file
```
I have not downloaded any database (if it needs to be downloaded explicitly).

Also, no doctests failed related to the modified ticket.
