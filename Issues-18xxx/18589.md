Computation of isogenies of prime degree p is expensive when the degree is neither a "genus zero" prime [2,3,5,7,13] or a "hyperelliptic prime" [11, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 41, 47, 59, 71] (for these there is special code written).  In one situation we can save time, after factoring the degree `(p^2-1)/2` division polynomial, if there is exactly one factor of degree (p-1)/2, or one subset of factors whose product has that degree, then the factor of degree (p-1)/2 must be a kernel polynomial.  Then we do not need to check consistency, which is very expensive.

The example which led me to this was with p=89 over a quadratic number field, where E.isogeny_class() was taking days.  After the change here that goes down to 3 hours.  (There are 4 curves in the isogeny class and the code requires factoring the 89-division polynomial of each!)  I used a less extreme example for a doctest: a 37-isogeny.

Interesting, the hardest part of the computation is checking the consistency, not computing the actual result.

I had a look at what PARI can do for isogenies: `ellisogeny` computes the isogeny, so it could be used to implement `E.isogeny()`, but I assume it does no checking.

Minor comment: in the doctest, you don't need

```
from sage.schemes.elliptic_curves.isogeny_small_degree import isogenies_prime_degree_general
```

No, but it is Example 3.1.1 on page 28 of [KT2013] which is here: http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/57568/
The example is over F_3 so is not slow.

I thought that we did use resultants... but looking again at Kimi's code, the relevant function is mult() on line 1960:  the effect of this function is to take the polynomial f and the rational function m, under the assumption that f is coprime to the denominator of m, and return the poly whose roots are m(alpha) as alpha runs over the roots of f.  If m were a polynomial that would be res_Y(X-m(Y),f(Y)).  I can see now that we could stil use that formula with m(Y) replaced by the polynomial p(Y) which satisfies p*d=n (mod f) where m=n/d which would amount to one extended gcd and one resultant.  This may be better than the current code since it does not use rational functions.

Can we keep this idea for another ticket?

There is a pre-existing typo: `otain` instead of `obtain`.

I don't quite get what you're saying here. I think I said "resultants" too quickly before looking at the actual code.

Mathematically, we need to compute

```
gcd( numerator( f(a/b) ), psi)
```
where `f`, `a`, `b`, `psi` are univariate polynomials and only `f` changes. I guess we know that the denominator of `f(a/b)` is `b^d` with `d` the degree of `f`. So we need

```
gcd( b^d f(a/b), psi)
```
Now suppose `c` is such that `a/b = c mod psi`, then we really need

```
gcd( b^d f(c), psi)
```
which equals

```
gcd(f(c), psi)
```
Now compute this in `R[x]/psi(x)` and this should be the most efficient way.

(this was written up quickly, I haven't really checked that it's correct)

Yes:  if for some degree d dividing l2=(l-1)/2 there are exactly (l-1)/2d factors then their product must be a kernel poly.

Some more theory:  each subgroup has l2 x-coordinates and the rational function m(x) permutes these in a single cycle (by definition of "semi-primitive root" as a class mod l which generates the multiplcative group modulo <-1>).  A kernel poly is a poly of degree l2 whose set of roots is invariant under this map.  Since the map is defined over the ground field, each of the x-coordinates in any subgroup has the same degree d over the base, so d is a divisor of l2 and the kernel poly is a product of l2/d polys of degree d.   On the other hand, an irreducible factor f of degree d (where d didvides l2) need not be a factor of a kernel poly, as the F_3 example with l=13 shows.  If that is the case then the orbit of f under mult() will be longer than l2/d and we will detect that after l2/d steps we have not returned to the start.  In this circumstance we will have removed l2/d factors from the list but this is only *part of* an orbit, so later on when we start with one of the remaining factors in that orbit, we may well iterate onto a factor which is already removed.

There, I have proved that g need not be in factors!  And more -- if we find a g which is not in factors then we have hit a part-orbit already seen so can break.

In the current implementation, you are computing

```
    from sage.rings.arith import gcd
    a = _least_semi_primitive(l)
    m = E.multiplication_by_m(a, x_only=True)
    F = psi_l.parent()
    x = F.gen()
    d = F(m.denominator())
    n = F(m.numerator())
```
even when `factors_by_degree` is empty.

An easy optimization would be

```
if all(factors == [] for factors in factors_by_degree):
    return ...
```
just before that block.

I agree that this ticket makes sense by itself. It's just that it only does some easy optimizations, it doesn't fundamentally improve the algorithm.

I have been thinking a bit about the computation of `mult()` this afternoon and I might have an idea to compute `mult^-1(f)` (that is, find `g` such that `mult(g) == f`) much faster than the current `mult()`. Of course, theoretically, `mult()` and `mult^-1()` play the same role.

I'm wondering if it's worth pursuing further and for that I need to know if `mult()` is ever the bottleneck of the algorithm. (this is of course for a hypothetical follow-up ticket)

The check `not factors_by_degree` only checks that the dict has no keys, but you really need to check that all values are empty lists:

```
all(factors == [] for factors in factors_by_degree.values())
```

You are right, I had forgotten that in creating the dict it might have had some empty lists.  I should have known better than to do more simplifaction than you recommended!

As expected:  it is in the lines

and

```

Thanks for the info.

Interesting, it looks like the `gcd()` computation in `mult()` takes so much time. I would assume that some kind of coefficient explosion occurs.

From the traceback, you see that PARI is used to compute this gcd, so the generic Sage code doesn't matter.
