There are many possibilities, I guess

```
git rebase -i
```
would be the easiest. Then you can edit, squash, remove, reorder commits...

Of course, this qualifies as "rewriting history" which is something you normally should not do for a ticket under review. However, in this case, it is the best solution.

Update : on top of 6.8beta7, this gives one ptestlong failure :

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage -t --long --warn-long 67.6 src/sage/structure/dynamic_class.py  # 2 doctests failed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

However, this doctest passes standalone :

```
charpent@asus16-ec:/usr/local/sage-6.8$ sage -t --long --warn-long 67.6 src/sage/structure/dynamic_class.py
Running doctests with ID 2015-07-03-19-21-20-3619480c.
Git branch: mabranche
Using --optional=mpir,python2,sage,scons
Doctesting 1 file.
sage -t --long --warn-long 67.6 src/sage/structure/dynamic_class.py
    [69 tests, 0.23 s]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Total time for all tests: 0.3 seconds
    cpu time: 0.2 seconds
    cumulative wall time: 0.2 seconds
```

So I think it's a glitch possibly due to high load.

Still `needs_review`
