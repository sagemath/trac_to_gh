<a id='comment:1'></a>For those, like me, who don't fully understand the display_manager stuff, try this recipe

```
from sage.repl.rich_output.backend_emacs import BackendEmacs
from sage.repl.rich_output import get_display_manager
emacsdm = BackendEmacs()
get_display_manager().switch_backend(emacsdm,shell=get_ipython())
```

Then you can use

```
%display text latex
```

to test it out.  Of course it will look rather ugly since sage-mode isn't formatting it for you.
