Test if a Paley graph is `(v,k,\lambda,\mu)`-strongly regular.
```
Huh? Do you mean

`It is said to be *projective* if any two of its codewords are linearly independent.`

This needs an extra care: a projective code, if defined this way, cannot contain the all-0 word. 

(Usually a projective code is defined as a subset of points in a projective space; your definition is OK, if you add that it does not contain an all-0 word).

well, it's behind a paywall for me (and Oxford - although we should have a paper copy)
Anyhow, your correction does not go far enough: namely, a projective code cannot have all-0 codeword, in all the (free) internet sources I can find.

Oh, I see - they belong to a school allowing all-0 vector while talking about linear
dependence. Then what you had before is OK. Well, almost OK, because a code consisting of just one word, all-0, would be projective by their definition, but it won't for any other definition.

It appears in the documentation of `strongly_regular_db` when I build it. If it does not appear on your computer then there is a problem. About your "how to find it": not all graph methods appear in the `Graph` class. Some, which I consider more 'confidential', have to be imported from the modules. Like several kind of weird vertex/edge colorings.
