People have no idea what they ask for when they write `if ex != 0:` with `ex` possibly(!) a symbolic expression. E.g. this happens to trigger in `matrix/*` the full blown procedure of starting Maxima with its limited deductive armament trying to prove that `ex` is nonzero. This when all was wanted was that it not be a "numeric" zero.

This ticket replaces the two instances in `matrix/` where such behaviour was triggered in doctests.

Compare on fresh Sage:
Before:

```
sage: %timeit M = matrix(SR, 2, 2, x^2 - 2*x + 1)
The slowest run took 468.13 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
1 loops, best of 3: 2.08 ms per loop
```
After:

```
sage: %timeit M = matrix(SR, 2, 2, x^2 - 2*x + 1)
The slowest run took 815.87 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
10000 loops, best of 3: 82.8 µs per loop
```

Hi,

I really do not like your solution. You are invading a generic class with some specialized code. Moreover, the issue you found might be present in a lot of other places. You should find a better way to do this test without having to care whether the input is symbolic. If each ring needs a specialized treatment it will become a complete nightmare.

Secondly, the operations `import XYZ` and `isinstance(x, my_type)` are not at all negligeable. Though, in this case it is not very noticeable since the cost is elsewhere. But with your strategy, you are potentially slowing down everthing for a corner case speed up.

In this very particular case of matrices, there is a simpler way to fix the issue. You can just avoid testing anything. In case `x` is zero a useless filling will be done but of no harm (it is very quick compared to the rest of the initialization). If you like better my solution, write at least a comment that we should not test wheter the input is zero.

Vincent

This patch has the following footprint:

```
           SR   Laurent poly
develop   2 ms     45 us
patched  78 us     52 us
```
I don't believe you would stall this again because of, say, ten microseconds?

I think invading a fundamental piece of infrastructure with specific tests for a specific ring should not be taken lightly. I think you can avoid most of your trouble by delaying the is_zero test to the last possible moment:

```
        elif self._nrows == self._ncols:
            self._entries = [entries if i==j else zero for i in range(self.nrows) for j in range(self.nrows)]
        elif entries == zero:
            self._entries = [zero]*(self._nrows*self._ncols)
        else:
            raise TypeError("nonzero scalar matrix must be square")
```
The first list comprehension can be optimized further, if required (I suspect that testing whether "entries" is zero to more quickly create a square zero matrix is a false optimization: if you need that thing quickly often, you should reuse an immutable zero matrix. That will be much quicker (and constant in size of the matrix!), so I don't think it's necessary).

If the zero check is expensive, it will almost certainly lead to an error.

With this code there is no big need to single out SR anymore, and you fix a more fundamental issue: in order to create a matrix (even a diagonal square one) it shouldn't be necessary that your ring has a decidable (or efficient) zero test. For a non-square zero matrix, we can't avoid a zero check, but at least we can delay that until we really need to know (because otherwise we raise an error).

As I said in [comment:5](#comment%3A5), the solution should be non intrusive and your solution is what I suggested at the very end of this comment.

Though, using a list extension is twice slower. With

```
def m1():
    cdef Py_ssize_t i
    cdef list l = [0] * 100
    for i in range(10): l[10*i + i] = 12
    return l
def m2():
    cdef Py_ssize_t i,j
    return [12 if i == j else 0 for i in range(10) for j in range(10)]
```
I got

```
sage: %runfile test.pyx
sage: %timeit l = m1()
1000000 loops, best of 3: 456 ns per loop
sage: %timeit l = m2()
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.09 µs per loop
```

Right, but for sparse matrices it is explicitely assumed that only nonzero entries are stored... what should we do in that case?

Different problem, different ticket. Of course, one should only avoid comparisons if one can.

Since matrices rarely "accidentally" remain sparse, you probably get decent performance by just assuming any entry that is actually given, is nonzero (so no explicit checks necessary). Of course that doesn't work when converting a dense matrix to a sparse one.

If this is an issue, perhaps we should have a special "comparison avoiding" sparse matrix class.
