We should really clean up the declarations in `sage/libs/paridecl.pxd`, analogous to what has been done for `gmp` for example.

This also fixes the unneeded linking of `pari` in the following Cython extensions:

```
src/build/cythonized/sage/rings/number_field/totallyreal.c
src/build/cythonized/sage/rings/padics/common_conversion.c
src/build/cythonized/sage/rings/padics/padic_capped_absolute_element.c
src/build/cythonized/sage/rings/padics/padic_capped_relative_element.c
src/build/cythonized/sage/rings/padics/padic_fixed_mod_element.c
src/build/cythonized/sage/rings/real_double.c
```

Could you just add a comment on why `types.pxd` should not call any PARI function?

I guess it is to avoid the need to link to PARI when cimporting taht file, but that's not stated.
