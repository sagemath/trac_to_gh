`JankoGroup(4)` should throw `NotImplementedError`; I don't think anyone wants a permutation 
group of degree 173067389, and they aren't known by `AtlasRep`, as far as I know (IMHO
they have the same data as in http://brauer.maths.qmul.ac.uk/Atlas/v3/spor/J4/).
 

```
gap> i:=AtlasGroup("J4");
<matrix group of size 86775571046077562880 with 2 generators>
```

while for the remaining values of k<4 you get 

```
gap> i:=AtlasGroup("Jk");
<permutation group of size ....... with 2 generators>
```

Right, right. I simplified it and requested an integer from 1 to 3 instead.

HMmm... Gap isn't optional. And with gap installed on my computer, I did not notice that an optional package was needed `^^;`

I don't even know which package is needed `O_o`

you need internet access to use AtlasRep in GAP.

of course you can `build` it offline, but not `use` offline
(although perhaps some of its data is in other GAP databases).

perhaps one has to read its code...

```
4.3 User Parameters for the AtlasRep Package

This section lists global parameters for which it might make sense to change their defaults by assignments to global variables, either just for the current GAP session or as user preferences in the user's gaprc file (see Reference: The gap.ini and gaprc files). For an overview of these parameters, see AtlasOfGroupRepresentationsUserParameters (4.3-8).

4.3-1 Local or Remote Access

There are two possibilities to use the AtlasRep package.

Local access only (offline)

    You can restrict the access to the data that are actually stored in the local installation of GAP.
Remote access (online)

    If your computer is connected to a network that provides access to the ATLAS data (for example the internet) then the functions of the package may fetch the requested data automatically from remote servers when they are required for the first time; these data are then by default stored in the local copy, so later access to them needs no network transfer.

The latter possibility is presently not used by other GAP packages, so it may be regarded as an important feature of the AtlasRep package. Anyhow it requires a few words of explanation.

I just did the following:

- Went offline
- 'sage -f gap_packages'
- 'rm -rf ~/.sage/gap/'
- 'make'
- 'sage -br'

```
sage: graphs.LivingstoneGraph()
Livingstone Graph: Graph on 266 vertices
```

So for the moment, I will keep on believing that this works offline. Unless you know where it could be cached?

Yeah, I just figured this out offline. The thing is that you are not supposed to have writing access to SAGE_LOCAL/gap, so no information should be cached there. It should be done in `~/.sage/gap`

Anyway, this requires internet indeed.
