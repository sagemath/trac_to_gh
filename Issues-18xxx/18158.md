Some objects in GAP are not PList but does support indexation.

```
gap> S := SymmetricGroup(5);;
gap> irr := Irr(S);;
gap> irr[3][1];
5
```
or

```
gap> gens := GeneratorsOfGroup(SL(2,GF(5)));;
gap> m := gens[1];;
gap> m[1];
[ Z(5), 0*Z(5) ]
gap> m[2];
[ 0*Z(5), Z(5)^3 ]
```
And Sage currently fails to recognize them as lists

```
sage: S = libgap.SymmetricGroup(5)
sage: irr = S.Irr()[3]
sage: irr[0]
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: 'sage.libs.gap.element.GapElement' object has no attribute '__getitem__'

sage: gens = libgap.GeneratorsOfGroup(SL(2,GF(5)))
sage: m = gens[0]
sage: m[0]
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: 'sage.libs.gap.element.GapElement' object has no attribute '__getitem__'
```

In this branch:

- We change the way gap lists are detected and hence more objects are now wrapped as `GapElement_List`. In particular we make possible the access to elements in the above example.

- we move the methods `vector` and `matrix` to `GapElement_List`

gap lists are Python iterable as well

```
sage: list(gap.List([1,2,3]))
[1, 2, 3]
```
and having `list(x)[0] != x[0]` is not breaking any rule.

I agree with your example. On the other hand, gap permutations starts at 1 and it is coherent with their lists starting at 1.

More importantly, for who is intended the gap/libgap interface objects (and more generally Sage interface objects):
- everybody
- Sage programmers
- users knowing gap (pari, singular, etc)
- ?
I rarely use `._pari_()`, `._gap_()` when doing actual computations. When I do, it is that Sage is lacking some interface.

All right, this is as much consistent as gap vs libgap

```
sage: pari("[1,2,3]")[1]
2
sage: gp("[1,2,3]")[1]
1
```

I will just add some warning in the doc and try to implement this `__getitem__` support in libgap.

Indeed it is much more robust and general. That way libgap vectors and matrices are also considered as lists

```
sage: M = libgap.eval('SL(2,GF(5))').GeneratorsOfGroup()[1]
sage: M
[ [ Z(5)^2, Z(5)^0 ], [ Z(5)^2, 0*Z(5) ] ]
sage: M[0]
[ Z(5)^2, Z(5)^0 ]
```

I don't really get the purpose of this ticket; e.g.
`m = libgap.eval('[[Z(2^2), Z(2)^0],[0*Z(2), Z(2<sup>2)</sup>2]]')`
can just as well be done as follows, without an `eval`:

```
F=libgap.GF(4)
a=F.PrimitiveElement()
m = libgap([[a,a^0],[0*a,a^2]])
```
