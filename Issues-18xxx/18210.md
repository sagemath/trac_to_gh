Wrong values from incomplete gamma:

```
$ ./sage -v
SageMath Version 6.7.beta1, Release Date: 2015-04-15

$ ./sage
sage: gamma(60, 30).numerical_approx()
-1.28306738270893e74
```
Reason is a bug in Pari:

```
? \p 50
   realprecision = 57 significant digits (50 digits displayed)
? incgam(60,30)
%2 = 1.3868299023788799504133735635863795825413935892945 E80
? \p 30
   realprecision = 38 significant digits (30 digits displayed)
? incgam(60,30)
%3 = -1.23084064495468737276106696496 E74
```

Previous description:

The following code:


```
sage: var('R k')
(R, k)
sage: integrated = -(gamma(1/2*k, 1/2*R*k) - gamma(1/2*k))/gamma(1/2*k)
sage: plot(integrated.subs(k=41), (R,0,6))
```

gives a Seg fault error and crashes Sage entirely:

 line 134:  4216 Segmentation fault      (core dumped)

I believe it comes from the symbolic computation because the following code is working:


```
sage: var('R k')
(R, k)
sage: integrated = -(gamma(1/2*k, 1/2*R*k) - gamma(1/2*k))/gamma(1/2*k)
sage: plot(integrated.subs(k=41.), (R,0,6))
```

(Note the 41. instead of 41)

I have no idea where this comes from but it's really bad, because whatever is going wrong, crashing Sage is bad!

This is recent because on 6.5beta1 the error doesn't occur.

It looks like some infinite recursion in ginac. Excerpt from traceback obtained from `sage -gdb` after segv has occurred:

@rwst: This is a reposting of my sage-support thread [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-support/E2YW4ddcwQI) where I gave some small reproductions of the problem.

---


The incomplete gamma function is resulting in negative outputs with positive real input, which shouldn't happen.


```
sage: gamma(60, 30).numerical_approx()
-1.28306738270893e74
```


Attached is a notebook showing the same in graphical form.

If I feed in numbers of a higher precision, I get the correct result:


```
sage: R10 = RealField(200)
sage: gamma(R10(60), R10(30)).numerical_approx()
1.38682990237888e80
```


My final problem is that there doesn't seem to be any way to get higher precision numbers to feed all the way through the plot function:


```
sage: show(plot3d(log(gamma(k, k*x)), (x, R10(0), R10(5/2)), (k, R10(1), R10(101))))
Launched jmol viewer for Graphics3d Object
```

(you would see a 3d graph with a bite out of it where the precision issue exists)


---

I'm able to reproduce it today on the latest sage:

```
$ ./sage -v
SageMath Version 6.7.beta1, Release Date: 2015-04-15

$ ./sage
sage: gamma(60, 30).numerical_approx()
-1.28306738270893e74
```

Discusion migrated from #16697

by buck:

... this patch doesn't fix the numerical instability in incomplete gamma as promised elsewhere.

```
sage: gamma_inc_lower(25, 14.5).n()
-6.63538851954338e22
sage: gamma_inc_lower(25, 14.5).n(algorithm='mpmath')

sage: gamma_inc_lower(25, 14.5).n(algorithm='pari')
-6.63538851954338e22
```


by buck:

Of note, gamma (even incomplete) is strictly positive in the reals; it's an integral of a strictly positive function.

​https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incomplete_gamma_function#Definition


by buck:

Wolfram gives the value of the same as 4.7e21, which seems correct.
​http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Gamma%5B25%2C+0%2C+14.5%5D


by buck:

Actually, if I ask pari directly, it gets the correct value, so maybe the algorithm argument is broken?

```
sage: pari('gamma(25) - incgam(25, 14.5)')
4.71197173824555 E21
sage: pari('incgamc(25, 14.5)')
4.71197173824555 E21
```


by buck:


Same story if I ask mpmath directly. I can't imagine what's wrong.

```
sage: call(mpmath.gammainc, 25, 0, 14.5)
4.71197173824555e21
```

'algorithm' isn't propagated to evalf so we always get the buggy pari values. As we would have to switch the default anyway as soon as a later pari version fixes the bug, I'll now simply disable pari. We'll have to live with mpmath's 53 bits for now.

This works because it uses the gp interface (the libpari might be broken on our side). Ah, that's two different bugs. However, even if it is in our interface to libpari and we fix this, or if we use the gp interface, there is still the unfixed pari bug at
​http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1689PARI/GP


by rws:

Actually the 53-bit restriction applies only to larger values, so all is not lost.

Replying to [@sagetrac-buck](#comment%3A22):
> @rwst: Could you expand on the "two different bugs" and link them (and/or create tickets for them)?

Okay, this ticket is the `(60,30)` bug from [comment:13](#comment%3A13), i.e. `gamma(60, 30).numerical_approx()`. The other one is the fact that `gamma(25,14.5)` and `CC(25).gamma_inc(14.5)`, which both use libpari, give

```
sage: CC(25).gamma_inc(14.5)
6.86802286928673e23
sage: gamma(25,14.5)
6.86802286928673e23
```
while 

```
sage: pari('incgam(25, 14.5)')
6.15736429994994 E23
```
But then, we see also 

```
sage: pari('incgam(60,30)')
-1.23084064495469 E74
sage: gamma(60,30).n()
-1.28306738270893e74
```
so there is a mismatch between the two interfaces, and the gp interface is sometimes right where libpari is wrong.
> Also, could you explain why "because it uses the gp interface" would obscure the negative-number return value?

Because the gp interface is sometimes right, apparently.

However, I don't think it useful to open two tickets as long as we don't know if there really are two different bugs.

The bug reported in the OP seems gone; I can't reproduce the segfault.
Can we change the topic of the bug to strictly about the numerical issue?
That seems to be what most of the discussion was about.

I still get the same broken graph in sage master.

Sage is at a1b60f2c3e06171caa4aa044a73ea58236686d30 and pari is at 'GP/PARI CALCULATOR Version 2.8.0 (development git-6157df4)'.


I can't tell immediately if that's before or after the referenced pari commit above.

I also had to install bison to get the build to run, which I hadn't installed before, but I *had* built pari before (I think!) so I believe that's a new build dependency there?
