Construction of polytopes with number field coordinates are very slow. There are several reasons for that:
- quadratic number field element hash is slow (already solved in #18215)
- `NumberField.__cmp__` is slow
- we can avoid many useless copies and recomputations in the algorithm `Vrep2Hrep` and `Hrep2Vrep`

After applying the branch the speedup is really cool. Using [polyhedron_test.py](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket18241/polyhedron_test.py.gz) I got

Before

```
sage: %runfile polyhedron_test.py
sage: %time gr = great_rhombicuboctahedron()
CPU times: user 4.66 s, sys: 24 ms, total: 4.68 s
Wall time: 4.66 s
```
After

```
sage: %runfile polyhedron_test.py
sage: %time gr = great_rhombicuboctahedron()
CPU times: user 292 ms, sys: 28 ms, total: 320 ms
Wall time: 306 ms
```

(But I am still not able to build the [600-cell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/600-cell))

Modifications with the branch:

1. In the double description file
     - use `itertools` instead of whatever `sage/combinat/*`
     - use `base_ring.zero()` and `base_ring.one()` instead of the Python integer `0` and `1`. That prevents many coercions.
     - make the method `add_inequality` so that the object is changed **inplace** instead of returning a new instance. I had to change the type of the attribute from `tuples` to `lists`.
     - add a cache for matrix spaces (see #18231). These are the methods `_matrix_space` and `_matrix`
     - implement a cache for the method `.zero_set` (note that this was needed because the object is no more immutable, `self.A` will grow in `add_inequality`)

2. Start with a trivial case in `NumberField.__cmp__`.

Depends on #18215

About this branch:

- `zero_set`: why don't you just call `DD.zero_set.clear_cache()` instead of rewriting the caching mechanism? If you do want to keep this `self.cache` please make the name more specific.

- `A_matrix` : returns a pointer toward a mutable internal object.

- Err

  ```
  Add an inequality to the double description with the inequality ``a``
  added.
  ```

- I do not like this '_matrix' function very much. Its name is not very clear (`matrix_from_cached_vector_space`?) but what about just doing this 'if' twice (it is called twice)?

Precisely because the name does not reflect the difference. `matrix_from_cached_vector_space` does.

I hate this class already.

Oh. Well, because all that 'matrix' does is a if. If it is not a function of its own, you just have to copy this 'if' around.

Yoooooooooooooo !

Looks good, almost good to go. Just two things:

- This sentence repeats itself

  ```
  Add an inequality to the double description with the inequality ``a``
  added.
  ```
- What is the difference between those two lines?

  ```
  lines = self._linear_subspace.matrix().rows()
  lines = self._linear_subspace.basis_matrix().rows()
  ```

`linear_subspace.matrix` calls `linear_subspace.basis_matrix`. Having aliases is cool, but avoiding using them is cooler ;-)

Great! Thanks. It becomes reasonable to start using the generic backend.

Next step: avoid the recomputation of vertices! The algorithm is currently

```
INPUT: vertices
OUTPUT: (vertices, hyperplanes)
ALGO:
  1. compute hyperplanes from vertices (with no redundancy)
  2. recompute vertices from hyperplanes (with no redundancy)
  3. return (vertices, hyperplanes)
```
And it is precisely step 2 which takes an infinite amount of time for the 600-cell!
