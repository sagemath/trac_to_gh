With

```
$ sage --version
SageMath Version 6.8.beta8, Release Date: 2015-07-10
$ mathematica --version
10.0
```

The command

```
sage -t --warn-long 2.3 --optional=sage,mathematica src/sage/symbolic/expression.pyx src/sage/tests/benchmark.py src/sage/misc/functional.py src/sage/symbolic/constants.py src/sage/calculus/calculus.py src/sage/interfaces/mathematica.py src/sage/symbolic/integration/integral.py src/sage/symbolic/constants_c.pyx src/sage/matrix/matrix1.pyx src/sage/modules/free_module_element.pyx
```

gives:

```
# sage -t --warn-long 2.3 src/sage/symbolic/expression.pyx  # 1 doctest failed
# sage -t --warn-long 2.3 src/sage/symbolic/constants.py  # 3 doctests failed

```

Full log is attached. Previous similar tickets are : #16703, #13011.

One reason is a bug in implementation of `N()`, which is caused by always stripping precision tick away in `get()`, setting `NumberMarks->False`.
(Or at least it has become a bug - this line of code dates back to 2006).

<a id='comment:7'></a>changes around `display_manager` are due to Volker. I wonder whether he overlooked the fact that normally `display_manager.preferences.text is None` rather than `display_manager.preferences.text == 'plain'` holds.

Matthias, it seems that in your setup N() and n() methods of Mathematica objects are mixed up. For me on Linux, with 64-bit Mathematica 9,  I have

```
sage: t=mathematica('Pi')
sage: t.n?
Docstring:
   Return a numerical approximation of x with at least prec bits of
   precision.

   EXAMPLES:
[...]
Init docstring: x.__init__(...) initializes x; see help(type(x)) for signature
File:           /home/scratch/dimpase/sage/sage/src/sage/structure/element.pyx
Type:           builtin_function_or_method

What is the output of these (in particular, two last) commands for you?

No. I copy-pasted from the banner that it displays at start; and also verified by calling ` mathematica.SystemInformation()`.
 
Note that in the docstrings that you copied, it guarantees "at least" ... digits.
So the tests should probably not rely on a particular number of digits.

it is a symbolic Mathematica expression `prec[Pi]`. It cannot be evaluated to anything.
Evaluating `mathematica('Pi').n()`, on Mathematica side I see the following:

```
In[1]:= sage0=Pi;
In[2]:= sage1=0;
In[3]:= sage2=gen[sage1];
In[4]:= sage1=prec[sage0];
In[5]:= sage3=1;

In[7]:= sage1 < sage3
Out[7]= prec[Pi] < 53
In[8]:= sage1 > sage3
Out[8]= prec[Pi] > 53
In[9]:= sage1 == sage3
Out[9]= prec[Pi] == 53
In[10]:= sage1
Out[10]= prec[Pi]
```

(in comment 22 I posted the corresponding log for `.n(10)` (I made a typo, wrote that it is `.n()`, now corrected there).

OK, I have implemented `n()`, and it works. 

But I am at loss as to how to implement `N()` (i.e. the Mathematica function call).
The problem is that `get()` method of Mathematica class in 
https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/develop/src/sage/interfaces/mathematica.py#L517
should get the parameter `ascii_art` set to True while it calls Mathematica via Expect.
And I cannot find an interface that would do this for me.

The thing is that

```
self.parent().N(self, *args)
```
doe not work properly, as data is kept in `InputFormat` on Mathematica side, e.g. 1.111111111111 with
precision 5 is not kept the way one expects, 1.1111, but as 1.111111111111<backtick>5. And that <backtick> gets stripped off by `get()`, getting the precision info lost in the process. 

So I ended up calling `self.parent().eval()` directly, took me the whole morning to figure out the right way. Anyhow, ready for review now!

the idea is that N() is a Mathematica function, and n() is a Sage function.
