Improve the hyperbolicity module by performing the following cleanings:

* rename "cuts" -> "CCL", "cuts+" -> "CCL+" or "CCL+FA";
* set "CCL+" as default (it is faster);
* include approximation algorithms using "cuts+" (already included, but an error is raised at the moment);
* put counting sort of pairs in a separate routine;
* use uint_32 and not uint_16 for pairs (graphs can have more than `2^16` vertices);
* rename algorithm "basic+" to "basic".

in the hyperbolicity method, we are not using qsort but something similar to counting sort.

David, is there any particular reason why you use variable "triples", instead of simply iterating twice over the array "pairs_of_length"? If not, I could clean this, too.

Hello,

- editing remark : comments must be formatted in 80 columns format. Don't ask why ;)
- in the sort_pairs method, you are not using quick sort but counting sort
- there is a recent and useful method for malloc. See file `generic_graph_pyx.pyx` for example

```
from sage.ext.memory cimport check_allocarray, sage_malloc, sage_free
elist = <int*>check_allocarray(2 * len(G.edges()) + 2, sizeof(int))
```
- I agree to remove `basic+`, although I would have prefer to rename `basic+` into `basic` and remove the old `basic` which is slower. The basic method is useful only for comparison purpose.
- the purpose of the `triples` list is to avoid computing many times the sum S1. It adds a loop but reduces the number of operations. Do you have a better solution in mind ?

David.

Yeah, sorry, wrong comment. Corrected.

I replaced the code of `basic` with the old cose of `basic+`.

> - the purpose of the `triples` list is to avoid computing many times the sum S1. It adds a loop but reduces the number of operations. Do you have a better solution in mind ?


I see your point: very nice solution! My solution was simply to recompute `S1` every time.

Hello,

Be careful with global name replacements

```
-      performs very well in practice since it cuts the search space.  This
+      performs very well in practice since it CCL the search space.  This
```

In method `sort_pairs`, you should
- Add a first comment line like `Return a list of pairs sorted in decreasing order of values`. Almost all methods have such a one line description.
- declare the types of local variables i,j,k

In method `__hyperbolicity__`, you should
- Replace `cdef uint32_t *nb_p = <uint32_t>check...` with `cdef uint32_t nb_p` and then call `sort_pairs` with `&nb_p`  and use `nb_p` rather than `nb_p[0]`

You could also rename some methods
- `__hyperbolicity_basic_algorithm__` -> `hyperbolicity_basic_algorithm`
- `__hyperbolicity__` -> `hyperbolicity_CCL` 
These methods are cdef, they are not visible at Python level.
