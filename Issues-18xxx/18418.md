Improve the hyperbolicity module by performing the following cleanings:

* rename "cuts" -> "CCL", "cuts+" -> "CCL+" or "CCL+FA";
* set "CCL+" as default (it is faster);
* include approximation algorithms using "cuts+" (already included, but an error is raised at the moment);
* put counting sort of pairs in a separate routine;
* use uint_32 and not uint_16 for pairs (graphs can have more than `2^16` vertices);
* rename algorithm "basic+" to "basic".

David, is there any particular reason why you use variable "triples", instead of simply iterating twice over the array "pairs_of_length"? If not, I could clean this, too.

Hello,

- editing remark : comments must be formatted in 80 columns format. Don't ask why ;)
- in the sort_pairs method, you are not using quick sort but counting sort
- there is a recent and useful method for malloc. See file `generic_graph_pyx.pyx` for example

```
from sage.ext.memory cimport check_allocarray, sage_malloc, sage_free
elist = <int*>check_allocarray(2 * len(G.edges()) + 2, sizeof(int))
```
- I agree to remove `basic+`, although I would have prefer to rename `basic+` into `basic` and remove the old `basic` which is slower. The basic method is useful only for comparison purpose.
- the purpose of the `triples` list is to avoid computing many times the sum S1. It adds a loop but reduces the number of operations. Do you have a better solution in mind ?

David.

Yeah, sorry, wrong comment. Corrected.

Done

> - I agree to remove `basic+`, although I would have prefer to rename `basic+` into `basic` and remove the old `basic` which is slower. The basic method is useful only for comparison purpose.

I replaced the code of `basic` with the old cose of `basic+`.

I see your point: very nice solution! My solution was simply to recompute `S1` every time.

Hello,

Be careful with global name replacements

```
-      performs very well in practice since it cuts the search space.  This
+      performs very well in practice since it CCL the search space.  This
```

In method `sort_pairs`, you should
- Add a first comment line like `Return a list of pairs sorted in decreasing order of values`. Almost all methods have such a one line description.
- declare the types of local variables i,j,k

In method `__hyperbolicity__`, you should
- Replace `cdef uint32_t *nb_p = <uint32_t>check...` with `cdef uint32_t nb_p` and then call `sort_pairs` with `&nb_p`  and use `nb_p` rather than `nb_p[0]`

You could also rename some methods
- `__hyperbolicity_basic_algorithm__` -> `hyperbolicity_basic_algorithm`
- `__hyperbolicity__` -> `hyperbolicity_CCL` 
These methods are cdef, they are not visible at Python level.

I think in increasing order, because at line 569 I find:

```
    # ==> Defines pairs_of_length[d] for all d
    for i from 1 <= i <= D:
        pairs_of_length[i] = pairs_of_length[i-1] + nb_pairs_of_length[i-1]

```
where pairs_of_length[i] is where the list of pairs at distance i starts.
