After a discussion at Sage Days 64, we decided to implement a variety of categories pertaining to geometry and topology to lend assistance to [SageManifolds](http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr) (#18528) and to generalize idioms in the hyperbolic geometry (#9439). This implements the following categories:

- topological spaces
- metric spaces
- manifolds
- CW complexes
- simplicial complexes (which has been needed, see #10667, #6099)
- Lie groups

and axioms:

- complete
- compact
- analytic
- differentiable
- smooth
- almost complex

<a id='comment:1'>**Comment 1:**</a>
I've implemented a bunch of stub categories as an overall layout guide. My method stubs and documentation will need to be expanded upon, including adding (more) tests, along with lifting methods from the hyperbolic geometry module. There is currently an abuse of `Finite` for CW complexes as they are not typically finite as sets (in fact, the only finite CW complexes are a finite collection of 0-cells), but the terminology is finite CW complex meaning a finite number of cells.

Eric, hopefully this is enough to get you started on what you'd want/need for SageManifolds. I probably won't work much more on this for a while.

That's great! Many thanks for implementing this. In a week or two, I'll start to split SageManifolds in small tickets and will of course use your category framework.

Hi Travis,

I gave a look at the category `Manifolds`; it looks nice and I have the following comments:

- the methods `dimension()` and `FiniteDimensional()`, and well as the class `FiniteDimensional`, are defined only at the level of `Connected`; shouldn't they be at the level of `Manifolds` itself ?
- in the docstring of `Manifolds`, I think the phrase "such that the neighborhood of any point `x \in M` is homeomorphic to `k^d`" should be changed to something like "such that any point `x\in M` admits a neighborhood homeomorphic to `k^d`"

Eric.

I wasn't sure about the dimension making sense for manifolds unless they are connected as far as my definition. Mainly do we want the disjoint union of a 1-sphere and 2-sphere be a manifold? (Current definition is yes). If so, then is the dimension the maximal dimension of each component? I will leave the decision up to you.

Feel free to change the docstrings and categories as much as you want. However if you just want to get these category stubs into Sage as a smaller step, we can do that too.

I made some fixes, specifically I stopped an infinite recursion with metric spaces caused by some of my last-minute refactoring. I forgot to make the other change to the manifold's doc, but I want to make sure you're okay with my definition of a manifold before I keep changing it.

Do you have a reference for such a definition of a manifold ? It seems non-standard (*) to me, but I might be wrong.
(*) the standard being that the dimension is the same for all the connected components.

Since there is no consensus in the literature, it's fine to take either definition, as long as it is clearly stated. I therefore agree with your definition, especially since it is consistent with CW complexes.

My professional opinion as a topologist is that a manifold should have a well-defined dimension *n*, and every point of that manifold should have a neighborhood homeomorphic to **R**<sup>*n*</sup>. So even if it's not connected, the different components should have the same dimension.

I think that more people would be unpleasantly surprised if we allowed different components to have different dimensions than if we had the more relaxed version.

It still seems like we are having an assumption that all manifolds can inherently be realized over **R**. This was my initial assumption too, and so manifolds that could be locally homoemorphic to **C**<sup>d</sup> were a special case.

However I feel like it would be best for `Manifolds` to be over an arbitrary topological field (which will require some very mild changes). So then the heirarchy for manifolds would be:

Do you think this what we want?

Also do we think we should add a stub category for PL and/or (pseudo) Riemannian manifolds? How about `ManifoldsWithBoundary` as a supercategory of `Manifolds` (and how many of these extra structures lift to the boundary)?

A question for CW complexes, should the elements of a CW complex be the cells or the points of the topological space? Right now, I'm taking the former approach, but I feel this might be an abuse as these should be subobjects of the category (Nicolas, any wisdom to impart on this?).

If manifolds are distinguished by their base field (after all, this is the base field that defines the dimension), an alternative hierarchy would be

```
            Manifolds
             /    \
        Complex  Differentiable
                       |

                    /      \
                Analytic  AlmostComplex
```
with the understanding that 
- `Manifolds`: topological manifolds over a topological field K
- `Complex`: topological manifolds over K=**C** with a holomorphic atlas
- `Differentiable`: topological manifolds over K=**R** with a differentiable atlas
- `Smooth`: topological manifolds over K=**R** with a C<sup>oo</sup> atlas
- `Analytic`: topological manifolds over K=**R** with an analytic atlas
- `AlmostComplex`: smooth manifolds with an almost complex structure
In particular, it seems to me that in the literature, "differentiable manifold" and "smooth manifold" always mean a real manifold. As mentionned in [comment:18](#comment%3A18), in the implementation a complex manifold of dimension n would be canonically associated to an almost complex manifold of dimension 2n.

If we can reach this level of generality, why not? I guess that when defining new categories for Sage, it's better to be as general as possible.

OK. I realize that my concern was more about the implementation of the Parent classes than about the categories: a priori, a complex manifold class cannot inherit from an almost complex class (despite of the name!) because it probably does not have any vanishing *complex* Nijenhuis tensor (although it has a vanishing *real* one), does it?
BTW what is the opinion of John Palmieri about all this?

Hi,

I believe Almost Complex manifolds are real manifolds with *added structure* (namely a [1,1]-tensor), meanwhile complex manifolds can either be seen as
* (a) Almost Complex manifold *satisfying further axioms* (integrability)
* (b) Manifolds (over **C**) *satisfying axioms* (holomorphic transition)
The definitions (a) and (b) are equivalent, but the transition from (b) to (a) is easy meanwhile the transition (a) to (b) is given by the Newlander Nirenberg theorem and involves solving complicated PDEs which cannot be made automatic. Therefore, it should be implemented as different objects, because we cannot get complex coordinates from the knowledge of a vanishing Nijenhuis tensor.

Another consequence : Complex manifolds must have complex holomorphic coordinates hence it inherits from the analytic category. But should its coordinates seen as real analytic or complex analytic ?
* It cannot be complex analytic since complex analytic manifolds are tautologically complex manifolds.
* But, it should not be real analytic because from the same almost complex manifold with real analytic coordinates it may be impossible to get our complex manifold back. Moreover it makes no sense to consider complex coordinates which are real analytic (for example $\bar{z}$ as a coordinate on **C**) because it does not preserve the complex structure on **C** but only preserves the structure of **R^2**.

I don't really know anything about manifolds over **Q**, but I fear transitions maps should also satisfy some *rationality conditions*, and more generally over any field, one have to take the good functions. Hence making the category looks like `Algebra` might be more difficult.
Another example : over the "ring" of quaternions, what would be the good functions ? Actually, there are several definitions possible each yielding different theories.

I'm sorry I was not very clear. In my opinion it is important to distinguish manifolds over **R** and over **C**. `AlmostComplex` should be seen as manifolds over **R** enriched, but `ComplexManifold` should not inherit from `AlmostComplex`. At least so that dimension or charts would be unambiguous.
(There would still exist a coercion from `ComplexManifold` to `AlmostComplex` but not coming from class heritage).

> Are you perhaps suggesting we should do something like the digram in [comment:21](#comment%3A21)?

Yes actually. Because in the following diagram where everything is parametrised on the underlying field, the case **F**=**C** makes no sense. Indeed `Differentiable/C` cannot exist since usual differentiable maps are not **C**-linear. Or else if you define it to be **C**-differentiable then it is the same as `Smooth/C` and `Analytic/C`

```
   Manifolds/F
       |  
Differentiable/F
       |
    Smooth/F
       |
   Analytic/F
```
I'm not sure, where, in the implementation the issue may appear...
For example, in the case of finite fields : x --> x<sup>p</sup> is not smooth on F_p but it is analytic, which contradicts the heritage.

For the record, I'm not much of an expert in manifolds; most of my knowledge comes from reading wikipedia.

So you're saying there should be a canonical functor from complex manifolds to almost complex manifolds given by changing the base field from  **C** to **R** (as opposed to it being a subcategory)? From what you said, this seems to be the best course of action.

For the example with finite fields, do they have a reasonable topology and could that define a transition map? If so, then I think we should enforce differentiable as being over **R**.

Hi Eric,

Replying to [@egourgoulhon](#comment%3A28):
> [...] I wonder now if a best strategy would be to leave instead the base field generic, with the understanding that *differentiable* means **K**-*differentiable*, where **K** stands for the base field.

As I said, there are case for some fields **K** where **K**-analytic is weaker than expected : For example I can make a change of charts x --> x<sup>p</sup> over F_p which is actually invertible since x<sup>p</sup> is the identity on F_p but when computing its differential it vanishes identically since px<sup>p-1</sup> = 0 in caracteristic p.

In my opinion (which is strongly disputable as I don't have a very wide knowledge of the existing theories) differential geometry is meant for **R** and **C** (or maybe in extremal cases over p-adic fields) but over other field the right way of doing geometry is through algebraic geometry : Manifolds or varieties are no longer given by charts but by equations.

However, there is still hope of having **K**-manifolds : The essential piece of information on a scheme (the algebraic geometry object generalising manifolds) is the *seaf of functions*. But we do have, within Sage Manifolds, a similar object : The set of `ScalarFields` over an open domain. The rest is just algebra over that (sheaf of) ring.
Yet I don't have any idea whether it is actually possible to implement algebraic geometry, and if there would be any use of such (gigantic) work.

> So you're saying there should be a canonical functor from complex manifolds to almost complex manifolds given by changing the base field from C to R (as opposed to it being a subcategory)? From what you said, this seems to be the best course of action.

Yes and actually this is easy :
Take a complex manifold with chart over U given by complex valued functions z<sup>k</sup> and let x<sup>k</sup> + i y<sup>k</sup> their decompositions into real and imaginary parts. Then (x<sup>1</sup>,y<sup>1</sup>, ... , x<sup>n</sup>,y<sup>n</sup>) is a chart over U of the underlying real manifold. On which we get an almost complex structure for free, given by J \partial_{x<sup>k</sup>} = \partial_{y<sup>k</sup>}
(Structure recalling which coordinate x and y are to be glued together to make complex coordinates)

This can be seen at the level of the most elementary examples :
The class `Manifold` has a single object subclass : `RealLine` (of dimension 1) which encodes the manifold **R**.
For the complex there should be 2 cases :
* `ComplexLine` (single object subclass of `ComplexManifolds`) of dimension 1 (over **C**) with canonical chart (**C**,z)
* `ComplexPlane`(single object subclass of `AlmostComplexManifolds`) of dimension 2 (over **R**) with canonical chart (**C**,(x,y)) and complex structure given by J_0 \partial_x = \partial_y

The functor applied to `ComplexLine` would yield the `ComplexPlane`.

Given our discussion, I have reorganized the manifolds category as:

```
        Manifolds
         /    \
    Complex   Real
               |
          Differentiable

Hi Travis,
Sorry for the delay. If you agree with general topological fields (non-discrete to define differentiable manifolds, I guess), then the hierarchy should be similar to that suggested in [comment:28](#comment%3A28), namely:

```
   Manifolds
      | 
 Differentiable
      |
    Smooth
      |
   Analytic
```
leaving the base field generic. Then `Real` or `Complex` could be added at any level (as axioms ?) (actually for complex, differentiable implies analytic). What do you think?

Sounds good to me. I will play around with the `Real`/`Complex` axioms and things to get something reasonable.

I will take objections and alternative ideas at any point forward too.

After much debate with myself, I ended up making the following:

```
   Manifolds
      | 
 Differentiable
      |
    Smooth
      |
   Analytic
  /        \
Almost     Complex
```
where `Complex` includes the holomorphic condition. I also added "complete" as an axiom and made some rings/fields into the finer categories they belong to (mainly `ZZ`, `QQ`, `RR`, `CC` into metric spaces, since they have a well-established distinguished natural metric); this allows the fields to work as the base of the manifold. If everyone can live with the current setup for now, then a quick check of my changes should yield a positive review (I hope).

Thank you for this new setting of the manifold categories, very timely regarding #18528 !
A first quick remark: `Almost` should be under `Smooth` since analyticity is not requirred for an almost complex manifold; see e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost_complex_manifold.

I made a mistake in my diagram. In the code, almost complex manifolds only imply smooth, not analytic.

I also noticed the test failures and have just pushed changes. Almost all were trivial doctest failures. I also made a few other variants of `\RR` and `\CC` know that they are also metric spaces.

@nthiery Note that I had to make a change to the French Sage book's test.

Thanks for the new version. Two remarks:

1/ The new categories do not appear in the reference manual, in the section "Individual Categories". Shouldn't they ?

2/ The p-adic fields implemented in Sage seems not to have been taken into account:

```
sage: Qp(5) in Fields().Topological()
False
sage: Qp(5) in Fields().Metric()
False
```

One should actually have

```
sage: Qp(5) in Fields().Metric().Complete()
True
```

There could be other metric fields in Sage, or more generally topological rings, that should be included. But maybe this is too much work for this ticket and should be delayed to some subsequent ticket ?

The default `dist` using `abs` seems reasonable at this stage. Thanks for having added the p-adic fields. 

I've merged the last commit of this ticket in all the tickets of #18528, replacing the `Sets()` category by `Manifolds(K)`, `Manifolds(K).Differentiable()` or `Manifolds(K).Smooth()`, with `K`=`RR`, `QQ`, `Qp(5)` or `CC`. Everything works well!

I've just one last question:

In the examples (in `src/sage/categories/examples/manifolds.py` and `src/sage/categories/examples/cw_complexes.py`), the parents implement the method `an_element` and not `_an_element_` (as advised in the Parent section of the reference manual). Is there any reason for this? 

and three suggestions of typo corrections:

- in `src/sage/categories/manifolds.py`, line 70: replace 
  "a morphism of metric spaces between manifolds is a manifold morphism" by
  "a morphism of topological spaces between manifolds is a manifold morphism"
- in `src/sage/categories/metric_spaces.py`, line 48: replace "is simultaneously a 
  topological group by itself, and a topogological space"
  by "is simultaneously a topological group by itself, and a metric space"
- in `src/sage/categories/topological_spaces.py`, there seems to be an unnecessary import:
  `from sage.misc.lazy_attribute import lazy_class_attribute`

That's very good to hear!

The reason we have `_an_element_` was for caching before there was an `@cached_method`. It is sufficient to implement `an_element`, especially for example classes. However, I can change if it you feel I should.

All done (and some other pyflakes cleanup).
