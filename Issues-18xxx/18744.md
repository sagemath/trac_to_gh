This ticket is to improve Cartan type recognition when constructing Cartan matrices. 

Specifically, when constructing a CartanMatrix from a Matrix or from a list of lists, CartanMatrix applies the function `find_cartan_type_from_matrix`. This function tests against Cartan matrices coming from built-in finite and affine CartanTypes. Currently, it does not detect Cartan types for relabellings of (Dynkin diagrams of) indecomposable Cartan matrices, nor does it detect reducible Cartan types for decomposable Cartan matrices. Improving the automatic detection of Cartan types is helpful when creating Cartan matrices on the fly, which in turn is useful for #18000.

After some preliminary analysis, it looks like the bulk of the work here can be accomplished by using the `indecomposable_blocks` method added to CartanMatrix in #18645, as well as the `is_isomorphic` method of the GenericGraph class (of which DynkinDiagram is a child class).

I propose to do the type checking only on the Dynkin diagram since there are good algorithms for checking digraph isomorphism (as indicated on the ticket):

```
sage: G = DiGraph([[1,2],[2,3],[3,1]])
sage: H = DiGraph([[0,-1],[-1,-2],[-2,0]])
sage: G.is_isomorphic(H, certify=True)
(True, {1: -2, 2: 0, 3: -1})
```
This is a slight variation than what is indicated on the ticket since `indecomposable_blocks` currently works by using the `connected_components` of `DiGraph`, so it avoids creating intermediary objects.

I just committed some initial work.

There are a few things I'm not happy about at the moment:

- the change on line 18772 of generic_graph.py from `G.relabel(return_map=True)` to `GenericGraph.relabel(G,return_map=True)` was made due to the conflicting definition of the relabel function in DynkinDiagram. I tried to get around it by converting DynkinDiagrams to DiGraphs, but somehow I couldn't make it work. If there's a better way, please let me know.

- there's some index set weirdness that I got around in finite type as on line 275 of cartan_matrix.py, but it feels hacky and I would like a better solution.

- the variable `test` consisting of a list of Cartan types to test against is copied from `find_cartan_type_from_matrix`. It might make sense to turn this list into a function of n somewhere reasonable.
