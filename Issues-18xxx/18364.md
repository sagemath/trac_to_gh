I currently fail to build sage 6.7.beta1 from scratch:

```

This is related to the auto-detected configure setting

```
   Support for VPX library:          yes
```

Fortunately I've recently encountered the same issue for Gentoo with the libgd bundled with php ([Gentoo bug #547310](https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=547310)). The issue is related to [this change](http://git.chromium.org/gitweb/?p=webm/libvpx.git;a=blobdiff;f=vpx/vpx_image.h;h=ef6d1dd3092e5c8e70173a4fc9def62c8eedef01;hp=0b7bb90572da3c0d0048285dffb7ed847f762823;hb=9cdaa3d72eade9ad162ef8f78a93bd8f85c6de10;hpb=0ecc75c81986a277d2e8e387117edfc21cb2fed0) for libvpx, which removed some legacy symbols. Prefixing those symbols with `VPX_` solves the issue, as done in [this commit](https://github.com/gagern/libgd/commit/d41eb72cd4545c394578332e5c102dee69e02ee8) to the GD-2.1 branch.

I think we have at least four solutions at our disposal:

1. Fix symbol names in libgd 2.1 by patching in [this commit](https://github.com/gagern/libgd/commit/d41eb72cd4545c394578332e5c102dee69e02ee8)
2. Explicitely disable libvpx support, to avoid linking against system library there
3. Bundle libvpx at a given version to become independent of system library
4. Upgrade to libgd 2.2 (once that's available), which should use libwebp instead of libvpx according to [libgd ticket #129](https://github.com/libgd/libgd/issues/129)

Which solution would you prefer? 1. differs the least from what we currently do, but that doesn't neccessarily make it the best solution.
