Currently the user can only enumerate all independent sets by calling Matroid.independent_r_sets repeatedly.  
An algorithm to compute all independent sets could be more efficient by taking into account that the independent sets are closed under taking subsets. 

I will write two versions of the algorithm, for Matroid and for BasisExchangeMatroid.

Hi Nathann,

I think you remember ticket #18183, on matroid polytopes. I saw that discussion the other day and I had to agree that it is an omission that we have no `.independent_sets()` method. 

I want to optimize the running time. Maybe using  `subsets_with_hereditary_property` is a good choice for the top class Matroids, I'll check it out. To improve upon `BasisExchangeMatroid.independent_r_sets()` I will have to work harder. Not sure even how much I can still squeeze out, we thoroughly optimized that one. But even if I cannot improve the running time, it will be good to have `.independent_sets()` in the interface.

Hello !

Yepyep. Such a function will surely be useful.

> I want to optimize the running time. Maybe using  `subsets_with_hereditary_property` is a good choice for the top class Matroids, I'll check it out.

I wrote it for situations when the function that checks if a set is a base is very slow. It may not be very efficient in other cases, though it definitely uses the information that the property is hereditary.

Good luck `;-)`

The new function seems to work just fine. 

```
sage: M=matroids.named_matroids.Q10()
sage: len(M.independent_sets())==sum([len(M.independent_r_sets(r)) for r in range(M.full_rank()+1)])
True
sage: timeit("M.independent_sets()")
625 loops, best of 3: 467 µs per loop
sage: timeit("[M.independent_r_sets(r) for r in range(M.full_rank()+1)]")
625 loops, best of 3: 674 µs per loop
```
Other matroids give the same picture. There is some speedup (30-40%), but nothing exceptional. 

Q10 is a BasisExchangeMatroid, so independent_sets() and independent_r_sets() above use bitsets, and that is where some of the speed comes from. 

I tried out Nathann's idea to use the hereditary-set code:

```
sage:def independent_sets_iterator(M):
    from sage.combinat.subsets_hereditary import subsets_with_hereditary_property
    for x in subsets_with_hereditary_property(M.is_independent,M.groundset()):
        yield x
sage: timeit("list(independent_sets_iterator(M))")
125 loops, best of 3: 5.17 ms per loop
```
For a fair comparison, I should force the use Matroid.independent_sets() instead of BasisExchangeMatroid.independent_sets(), so that you're not just looking at the advantage of using bitsets.

```
sage: from sage.matroids.matroid import Matroid
sage: timeit("Matroid.independent_sets(M)")
625 loops, best of 3: 1.17 ms per loop
```

I will go and modify the code for M.independence_matroid_polytope().The code will perhaps be more straightforward, but it will not matter much for the efficiency. With the same matroid Q10, you get:

```
sage: timeit("M.independence_matroid_polytope()")
5 loops, best of 3: 109 ms per loop
```
So the amount of time spent on generating independent sets is already less than 1%.

A somewhat bigger matroid is the binary Golay code on 24 elements. The timings for that matroid are as follows:

```
sage: M=matroids.named_matroids.ExtendedBinaryGolayCode()
sage: len(M.independent_sets())
7898547
sage: timeit("M.independent_sets()")
5 loops, best of 3: 2.29 s per loop
sage: timeit("[M.independent_r_sets(r) for r in range(M.full_rank()+1)]")
5 loops, best of 3: 3.95 s per loop
sage: timeit("list(independent_sets_iterator(M))")
5 loops, best of 3: 92.1 s per loop
timeit("Matroid.independent_sets(M)")
5 loops, best of 3: 40 s per loop
```

This is a problem with some update of PARI/GP (the failing doctest is the interrupt in `Integer.binomial`). Independent of that ticket.

Hello,

Your commit `6347279` is full of

```
- <empty line>
+ <four or more spaces>
```
Remove that.

You might have a serious problem with your text editor ;-) Or you like too much trailing whitespaces. Anyway: remove all trailing whitespaces you introduced.

My, my, that was a lot of white space. 

Looking at the final branch I appear to have repaired them all. I even repaired a few new ones that were in the recently added method `components()'. 

I also got rid of the superfluous set([e]). You're right, in that position [e] will do.

Just look at the diff. Many of them are still there. I will provide a commit for gettint rid of them later on if you do not succeed.

Might be cool to do more declaration in `src/sage/matroids/matroid.pyx`

``` 
cdef list T = [...]
cdef list L = [...]
cdef int r = 0
```
As a consequence, calls like `T[i]` gets much faster.

Full_rank is not huge, never more than the sizes of bitsets themselves.

Creating an array of bitset_t is what I do in most places, even if the lenght of that array is huge. Typically the work in computing the contents of the individual bitsets outweighs the time to allocate them in my application.

Hi Vincent, 

I think I got everything you mentioned in the above, so up for review again.

About the whitespaces: I think the few things you still see in the diff are changes in the right direction, from whitespace to no whitespace.

Helloooooo,

It must have happened during this merge: those files were *moved* to a different directory in a recent release, and perhaps some "git commit -a" during the merge added them back. Either way it is not complicated: just type "git rm <filename>" on those three guys, then add the commit to your branch.

That means that your branch will in theory add them back then remove them, but that's not really a problem. If you want to make it cleaner later, you can squash all the commits of your branch together (after the previous operation) with "git rebase -i develop".

In the `independent_sets` of `BasisExchangeMatroid`, is there a reason why you have to do all of that extra processing before the empty ground set check? Also it is faster to do `if not self._E:`.

You also have a little bit of whitespace left here:

```
        # <-- Whitespace
        .. SEEALSO::

            :meth:`M.independent_sets() <sage.matroids.matroid.Matroid.independent_sets>`
            :meth:`M.bases() <sage.matroids.matroid.Matroid.bases>`
```

Otherwise I think it looks good.

Hello,

1. This is very bad

```
+        I = <bitset_t*>sage_malloc((r + 1) * sizeof(bitset_t))
+        T = <bitset_t*>sage_malloc((r + 1) * sizeof(bitset_t))
+        for i in range(r + 1):
+            bitset_init(I[i], self._bitset_size)
+            bitset_init(T[i], self._bitset_size)
```
  It calls `2(r+2)` times memory allocation for arrays of fixed size! There should be only *one* memory allocation call for everything.

2. Something should be done for `KeyboardInterruption`. i.e. proper `sig_on/sig_off` and appropriate testing.

3. In the other method `independent_sets`:
   - the variable `int i` is useless.
   - replace

```
cdef list I = [frozenset() for i in range(self.full_rank()+1)]
```
  with

```
cdef list I = [frozenset()] * (self.full_rank()+1)
```
- why using `frozenset` in `I`? Using `set` would allow to replace `I[r+1] = I[r].union([e])` with

```
I[r+1] = I[r].copy()
I[r+1].update(e)
```
  It avoids a one element list to be created and `update` is much faster than `union`.

These are just my 2 cents and do not constitute an expert opinion on this issue.

I believe it has to be the two arrays of bitsets because of the code (at least without adding additional bitset manipulations and reimplementing the `__closure`).

Although I don't know if it is faster to use a python list of bitsets or the allocated block of memory. My intuition says the latter because it avoids the Python overhead.

Do you need a `sig_on` / `sig_off` for `cpdef` functions?

Yes, it is redundant; `r` could be used in its stead.

If this switches to using `set`, then we can't do the first replacement (which I believe you are aware, but I'm stating for the record). I'm +1 for changing to `set` and the above; it is much better in terms of memory manipulations and should gain some speed improvements. Additionally (mostly a note for myself), we will also need to cast the result into a frozenset:

```diff
-self.__closure(T[i+1], self._input)
+self.__closure(frozenset(T[i+1]), self._input)
```

Hi Travis,

sorry for the late reply. My setup for writing sage code involves working remotely on a linux machine. This is so uncomfortable that I was putting of this work until my macbook installation is on it's feet again. But I will at least reply to your last comments.

> 

The empty set is always an independent set of a matroid, so even if the ground set (self._E) is empty the output of .independent_sets() should be a SetSystem containing an empty set. So yes, that setup before the test if self._E is empty is necessary.

The overhead of these 2(r+2) memory allocations is negligible compared to the other work that independent_sets() does. Most subsets of the ground set of cardinality at most r will be independent, so for a matroid on n elements, writing the output takes time proportional to ` \sum_{i=0}^r (n choose i)`. So when this memory allocation takes more than a microsecond, were looking at an r in the hundreds. Then the function as a whole will probably take many years.

Whoops, sorry about that. Fixed and you shouldn't have to do anything special because I just reverted my bad merge.

I did some testing and found that the extra copying of the sets plus the conversion to a frozenset was just as slow if not slower than doing the union with the frozenset.

However I was able to optimize the method by special casing when `r` is at the full rank. The `BetsyRoss().independent_sets()` time when from 4.8s to 1.6s and `R98().independent_sets()` went from 4.8s to 2.8s on my machine.

Thanks for the explanations Rudi.
