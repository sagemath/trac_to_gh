Trigonometric functions for CIF are implemented in #17285 and #18135. Some functions still need to be implemented:
- `gamma`, `gamma_inc`
- `zeta`
- `dilog`

As the implementation for them in `sage/rings/complex_number.pyx` relies on Pari it might be hard to provide a competitive implementation.

They are implemented in arb. Once arb is a standard package and `ComplexBallField` is finished, it will be easy to create interval implementations (if not optimal ones) that wrap the ball versions.

* `zeta` was done in #16782

* `gamma` and `gamma_inc` do work a little (since #9184 ?) but not quite:

`sage: CIF(44/33).gamma()` does not.
