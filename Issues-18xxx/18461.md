The goal of this ticket is to implement a Cython method `Field._gcd_univariate_polynomial()` using the standard Euclidean algorithm.  This is much faster than `Fields.ParentMethods._gcd_univariate_polynomial()`, which calls `EuclideanDomains.ElementMethods.gcd()`, since both are Python methods.  (The `_gcd_univariate_polynomial` mechanism was introduced in #13442.)

The following bug can then be fixed by just removing `PolynomialRealDense.gcd()`, which does not take into account the case where one of the arguments of `gcd` is zero:

```
sage: R.<x> = RR[]
sage: x.gcd(R.zero())
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: 'MinusInfinity' object cannot be interpreted as an index
```
Removing this method *without* implementing `Field._gcd_univariate_polynomial()` (falling back on Python code) is about twice as slow; with this ticket there is no slowdown.

Similarly, to make `CC` and `QQbar` use the new method instead of Python code, we also remove the now obsolete `Polynomial_generic_field.gcd()`.

I just tested again with the following setup:

```
R.<x> = RR[]
z = R.zero()
f = x^2 + 3
g = x^3 + 5
```
With this branch (i.e. with `Field._gcd_univariate_polynomial`):

```
sage: %timeit z.gcd(z)
The slowest run took 37.08 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.77 µs per loop
sage: %timeit x.gcd(z)
The slowest run took 22.57 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
100000 loops, best of 3: 4.34 µs per loop
sage: %timeit z.gcd(x)
The slowest run took 66.36 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
100000 loops, best of 3: 10.5 µs per loop
sage: %timeit x.gcd(x)
The slowest run took 13.64 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
100000 loops, best of 3: 11.1 µs per loop
sage: %timeit f.gcd(g)
The slowest run took 24.83 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
10000 loops, best of 3: 33.6 µs per loop
```
With this branch after removing `Field._gcd_univariate_polynomial`:

```
sage: %timeit z.gcd(z)
The slowest run took 16.42 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
100000 loops, best of 3: 6.81 µs per loop
sage: %timeit x.gcd(z)
The slowest run took 92.70 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
100000 loops, best of 3: 11.4 µs per loop
sage: %timeit z.gcd(x)
The slowest run took 15.38 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
100000 loops, best of 3: 19.2 µs per loop
sage: %timeit x.gcd(x)
The slowest run took 4.43 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
10000 loops, best of 3: 19.9 µs per loop
sage: %timeit f.gcd(g)
The slowest run took 4.04 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
10000 loops, best of 3: 42.7 µs per loop
```
I don't have an explanation for the discrepancy between the slowest and fastest runs; as far as I know there is no caching.

For complicated polynomials, the difference is undoubtedly smaller because most time is spent in `quo_rem`, which is not touched by this branch.
