Currently we have

```
        sage: Fx.<x> = GF(2)[]
        sage: p = x + 1
        sage: p.reverse(degree=5)
        x^5 + x^4
```

However:

```
        sage: Qx.<x> = QQ[]
        sage: p = x + 2
        sage: p.reverse(n=5)
        2*x^4 + x^3
```

So not only is the name of the optional arguments different, it also has subtly different semantics.

The optional argument should be the same, and `degree` makes most sense, and the behaviour should be the same.

Overview of some other base rings:

* `ZZ` is like `GF(2)`
* `RR` takes NO keyword
* `CC` is like `GF(2)`
* `GF(p^m)` is like `GF(2)`
* generic base ring is like `GF(2)`

Are there other to check?
