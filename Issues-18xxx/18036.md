```
As suggested in #7545, this ticket defines the imaginary unit `I` directly as the generator of `QuadraticField(-1)` instead of wrapping it in a symbolic expression.

**Why?** To allow it to be used in combination with elements of QQbar, CC, etc., without coercion forcing the expression to SR. For example, `1.0 + I` is now an element of CC instead of SR.

**How?** We set `I` in sage.all to the generator of ℚ[i], and deprecate importing it from `sage.symbolic.I`. The symbolic `I` remains available from `sage.symbolic.constants` for library code working with symbolic expressions, and as `SR(I)` or `SR.I()`. We create a dedicated subclass of quadratic number field elements to make it possible to support features similar to those of symbolic expressions of the form `a + I*b` that would not make sense for number field elements (or be too hard to implement, or pollute the namespace).

**Why not ℤ[i]?** Because the class hierarchy of number field and order elements makes it difficult to provide the compatibility features mentioned above for elements of both ℤ[i] and ℚ[i]. Having `I` be an element of ℚ[i] covers almost all use cases (all except working with algebraic integers?), and people who work with orders are sophisticated enough to explicitly ask for I ∈ ℤ[i] when they need that. (This is a debatable choice. We could probably do without the dedicated subclass for elements of ℚ[i], at the price of breaking backward compatibility a bit more.)

I'm not so sure it should. Which quadratic field is the appropriate one? There are many, distinguishable by the name of their generator (that would be 'I') for this one, but also by their specified embeddings, and it's not clear which one to choose.

Is there an argument for doing this? Ticket #17860 referenced in the description makes no mention of it. I'd imagine there might be evaluation reasons that might make it attractive. Perhaps those also give an indication of which quadratic field would be the appropriate one.

I also thought of this in the train... and I do not see much possible choices. I found two rather natural choices for the adoption of `I`:
- the ring of integers `Z[sqrt(-1)]` with its natural embedding in `QQbar`
- `QQbar` itself

> Is there an argument for doing this? Ticket #17860 referenced in the description makes no mention of it. I'd imagine there might be evaluation reasons that might make it attractive. Perhaps those also give an indication of which quadratic field would be the appropriate one.

Some reasons (in favor of the first choice):
- `I + 1.0` and `1.0 * I` should be complex numbers
- `factor((I+3))` should be the factorization over the Gaussian integers (i.e. `(-I) * (I + 1) * (2*I + 1)`)
- `abs(I)` should be the integer `1`

The ring `ZZ[sqrt(-1)]` definitely looks like the most natural choice to me, since admits a canonical homomorphism to any other ring with a distinguished square root of -1.

As for the distinguished embedding, is there a specific reason for choosing `QQbar`?  A more minimal choice would be to fix an embedding into a `UniversalCyclotomicField`; then we would have coercion maps `ZZ[I]` -> `UniversalCyclotomicField(zeta)` -> `QQbar` -> `CC`.  (Maybe this makes finding common parents slightly harder, though.)

Still needs quite a bit of work, but all tests should pass (I didn't run them all with the last version of the code). Any comment or improvement welcome!

In particular:
* Are there behavior changes that you think are not acceptable, or not acceptable without a deprecation?
* I'm not happy with the changes to `sage.geometry.hyperbolic_space` (which apparently relied on operations involving `I` triggering coercions to `SR`), but I don't understand the code well enough to do better.

Tangentially related: now may be a good time to deprecate (or remove directly?) the bogus coercion from `SR` to `QQbar`.

Very nice that it worked!

I do not quite understand why you need the creation of a new class of `NumberFieldQQi`... is that only for the special method you need in the element class?

For embedding in QQbar I guess that what should be fixed is embedding of number fields. In the ideal world, you would declare:

```
QQi = NumberField(x**2 + 1, 'I', embedding=QQbar.gen())
```
But then, there might be an infinite loop with the definition of `I` in `QQbar`. I had the same sort of troubles when refining default embedding from lazy field to `AA/QQbar`.

One reason was that having separate classes makes it easy to test if we are in the special case of QQ[i] using `isinstance`. In the case of the parent class, this is convenient when specifying coercions, for instance.

Anyway this will be instantiated at startup so why not keeping one instance `QQi` in `sage.rings.number_field.number_field`? (like we have for `ZZ`, `QQ`, etc). Then you can test identity when testing coercions.

If I remember right, currently, just adding `QQi = ...()` in the module currently doesn't work due to import order constraints. For now I just kept the creation of QQ[i] happening at the same time as it used to. But that's certainly something we should try to improve after this first draft.

Yes. Having a separate class would also be natural if we want `I.parent()` to display something less frightening than “Number Field in `I` with defining polynomial `x^2 + 1`”, and more generally to implement features specific to QQ[i]. But I can't really think of anything that makes sense for this field and not for embedded quadratic number fields in general, so perhaps it is better to encourage people to always implement a more general version?

A related question is whether `QQi is NumberField(x^2+1, 'I', embedding=CC.0)` should be true, or if there should be two separate parents.

What do you think?

Here we can probably cheat with

```
_QQi = None
def NumberFieldQQi():
    if _QQi is None:
        # build it once for all
        ...
    return _QQi

Yes! Having a custom representation should be done in the main class. It is already possible:

```
sage: K = QuadraticField(2)
sage: K.rename('It's me')
sage: K
It's me
sage: K.rename(None)
sage: K
Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^2 - 2
```

More generally, do we want unique representation for (absolute) number fields? I would tend to say yes. And the natural keys would be:
- the polynomial
- the variable name (not of the polynomial!)
- the embedding

I think everyone agrees that absolute number fields should have unique representation. My question was whether Q[i] should *be* an absolute number field in this sense, or if it should be a “special” object such that people could work with both Q[i]-as-a-subset-of-complex-numbers and Q[i]-as-a-number field, possibly at the same time. I'd prefer a single object as well, but I am sure I have missed some of the implications, so if anyone has arguments in favor of the other option, I would be interested in hearing them.

I would be interested in working with **any** number field seeing them as a subfield of the real or complex numbers! Not only `QQi` and it makes sense to ask whether we need a dedicated class for that. For both parent and elements.

Note that it is already partly possible to play with element of number fields as real numbers (especially with quadratic fields)

```
sage: K.<sqrt2> = QuadraticField(2)
sage: 1 < sqrt2 < 3/2
True
sage: sqrt2.n()
1.41421356237310
sage: sqrt2 + CC(0,1)
1.41421356237310 + 1.00000000000000*I
sage: sage: cos(sqrt2)
cos(sqrt(2))
sage: sqrt2.continued_fraction()
[1; (2)*]
```

About having methods `.cos()`, `.sin()`, `.exp()`, it is already something which I found dangerous with integers for which the method `.sqrt()` might return an answer with a different parent

```
sage: 4.sqrt()  # answer is a Sage integer
2
sage: 2.sqrt()  # answer is symbolic
sqrt(2)
```
Which is very different from

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: ((x+1)**2 * (x-2)**4).sqrt()
x^3 - 3*x^2 + 4
sage: R(2).sqrt()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: Polynomial is not a square. You must specify
the name of the square root when using the default extend = True
```

At the time Sage would support embedding of number fields into p-adic fields, I think it might be worse to have that dedicated class! But in the meantime, I have no strong opinion.

Still, if we ever want this new non-symbolic `I` to behave like to old symbolic `I`, we would need to support things like that:

Hi! I'd like to revive this discussion a bit because we're getting a doctest failure at https://github.com/pynac/pynac/pull/162 which would probably be fixed along the lines of this ticket.

For starters, I had a look at the current branch and some of the resulting doctest failures; this should roughly resemble the tasks that are still to be done:

* `sage -t --warn-long 54.2 src/sage/symbolic/constants.py  # 3 doctests failed`;
`sage -t --warn-long 54.2 src/sage/symbolic/pynac.pyx  # 3 doctests failed`: 

  duplicate doctests. not sure how to fix (maybe switch to I_symbolic?). and which to remove.

* `sage -t --warn-long 54.2 src/sage/symbolic/relation.py  # 3 doctests failed`:

  Doctests can be fixed directly.

* `sage -t --warn-long 54.2 src/sage/symbolic/expression_conversions.py  # 2 doctests failed`

  probably I_symbolic is needed?

* `sage -t --warn-long 54.2 src/sage/symbolic/expression.pyx  # 14 doctests failed`
  *  arithmetic with `oo` is broken (4 doctests)
  *  `_is_registered_constant_` --> remove doctest? I_symbolic?
  *  `is_numeric`/`is_constant` missing (I_symbolic?)
  *  `imag_part`/`real_part` should be an alias of `imag`/`real` (3 doctests)
  *  `I.log` not implemented (3 doctests)
  * `rectform`: either converse to SR or multiply with I_symbolic.

* `sage -t --warn-long 54.2 src/sage/rings/infinity.py  # 2 doctests failed`

  arithmetic with `oo` is broken.

* `sage -t --warn-long 54.2 src/sage/rings/complex_mpc.pyx  # 8 doctests failed` and `sage -t --warn-long 54.2 src/sage/rings/complex_arb.pyx  # 7 doctests failed`
  * coercion errors: `ValueError: Cannot coerce algebraic number with non-zero imaginary part to algebraic real`
  * precision regressions.

* `sage -t --warn-long 54.2 src/sage/rings/qqbar.py  # 6 doctests failed`
  
  common parent issue: `TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for '+': 'Algebraic Field' and 'Number Field in I with defining polynomial x^2 + 1'`

* `sage -t --warn-long 54.2 src/sage/rings/number_field/number_field_element_quadratic.pyx  # 1 doctest failed`

  common parent issue: `TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for '*': 'Number Field in I with defining polynomial x^2 + 1' and 'Number Field in sqrt3 with defining polynomial x^2 - 3'`

* `sage -t --warn-long 54.2 src/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_rational_flint.pyx  # 1 doctest failed`

  false error is raised

* `sage -t --warn-long 54.2 src/sage/rings/polynomial/cyclotomic.pyx  # 2 doctests failed`

  both can be fixed directly.

* Stuff in `sage/geometry/hyperbolic_space/hyperbolic_*.py` breaks down:
  * `sage -t --warn-long 51.1 src/sage/geometry/hyperbolic_space/hyperbolic_point.py  # 1 doctest failed`
  * `sage -t --warn-long 51.1 src/sage/geometry/hyperbolic_space/hyperbolic_geodesic.py  # 4 doctests failed`
  * `sage -t --warn-long 51.1 src/sage/geometry/hyperbolic_space/hyperbolic_isometry.py  # 1 doctest failed`
  * `sage -t --warn-long 51.1 src/sage/geometry/hyperbolic_space/hyperbolic_model.py  # 2 doctests failed`

  Not sure about these errors, some seem to be coercion related, others are just `TypeError: 'sage.rings.complex_number.ComplexNumber' object is not callable`---maybe that goes away along the way.


These are certainly not all failures, but they should give an idea of what breaks down. The biggest issue seems to be coercion...

I've lost track what the exact issues are that lead to that conclusion, but I would definitely prefer if we don't do that. I think we can avoid it for the following reason:

Sage itself needs *many* different I's. For one thing, every `ComplexField(b)` needs its own. We'd like coercion to take care of creating the many different I's. I guess we're now finding it's difficult to find a parent that coerces into sufficiently many complex parents.

If that is the case, perhaps we should solve the problem by just having a `LiteralI`, just as we have `RealLiteral` to avoid the precision coercion problems that arise with floats. The advantage is that its coercion properties can be tailored exactly to what we need (within the bounds of what coercion can handle in the first place)

It doesn't surprise me that I is problematic that way. It is, after all, an object that represents multiple values.

I can't speak to all the small changes that impact number field users, but I really like how atomic your commits are, well explained, and overall you seem to have a good approach.  And if the doctests still pass, that might be a good sign in and of itself (though obviously shouldn't be added to an rc at this late date).  Can anyone think of any other "extra" methods like `real_part` that should be added in `class NumberFieldElement_gaussian`?

Replying to [@kcrisman](#comment%3A44):
> I can't speak to all the small changes that impact number field users,

It should not have much impact, except maybe for the conversion to pari which is overridden to return a pari object of the form a+I*b instead of a element of a quotient ring. I don't know pari well enough to be able to tell if that can be an issue.

> but I really like how atomic your commits are, well explained, and overall you seem to have a good approach.

Thank you!

> And if the doctests still pass, that might be a good sign in and of itself (though obviously shouldn't be added to an rc at this late date).

No. Ideally, I would like it to be merged early in the next release cycle, so that we have time to sort out any issues.

> Can anyone think of any other "extra" methods like `real_part` that should be added in `class NumberFieldElement_gaussian`?

There was a discussion above about possibly supporting a significant subset of the methods of symbolic expressions, including elementary and special functions. I am reluctant to do that, because we will never achieve  perfect compatibility, and integers and rationals already  have their own API (so that users already need explicit conversions to SR in many cases if they want to use methods of symbolic expressions). But there may still be other methods  that make sense to add.

To put more in it, probably.
