```
sage: n = 10^3
sage: F = FreeModule(QQ, n, sparse=True)
sage: v = F.an_element()
sage: vectors = [v]*n

sage: %time a = matrix(vectors, sparse=True)
CPU times: user 2.01 s, sys: 38.4 ms, total: 2.05 s
Wall time: 1.96 s
```

Compare with the construction of the same matrix through an
intermediate dictionary:

```
sage: %time b = matrix(QQ, n, {(i,j): c for i,v in enumerate(vectors) for j,c in v.iteritems()}, sparse=True)
CPU times: user 7.33 ms, sys: 124 Âµs, total: 7.46 ms
Wall time: 6.06 ms
sage: a == b
True
```

Running `%prun` shows that the input vectors are converted to dense
lists and back (gasp!), which gives a complexity of `n^2` instead of
linear in the number of nonzero entries as would be expected.

In

```
if isinstance(e[0], Vector) and all(vec.is_sparse() for vec in e):
```
you seem to assume that if the first element of the list is a vector than all elements are. This would break on something like

```
matrix(3, [vector([0,1,0],sparse=True), [0,1,0], [1,1,1]])
```

It is quite fragile then! It is not uncommon to have a bunch of vectors that we want to use to construct rows `0,...,k` and then feed a list for the `k+1`-th row.
Since it follows the design I guess it is what should be done...
