MPIR 3.0.0 is shipped with the function `mpq_cmp_z(mpq_t, mpz_t)`. We can use it to make integer/rational comparisons much faster.

Comparing integers is very fast, comparing rationals is very fast but comparing integer with rational is about 5x slower:

```
sage: a = 1; b = 18
sage: timeit("a < b", number=500000, repeat=100)
500000 loops, best of 100: 64.3 ns per loop
sage: a = QQ(1); b = QQ(18)
sage: timeit("a < b", number=500000, repeat=100)
500000 loops, best of 100: 84 ns per loop
sage: a = 1; b = QQ(18)
sage: timeit("a < b", number=500000, repeat=100)
500000 loops, best of 100: 405 ns per loop
```

With the branch applied, it gets better

```
sage: a = 1; b = 18
sage: timeit("a < b", number=500000, repeat=100)
500000 loops, best of 100: 64 ns per loop
sage: a = QQ(1); b = QQ(18)
sage: timeit("a < b", number=500000, repeat=100)
500000 loops, best of 100: 65.6 ns per loop
sage: a = 1; b = QQ(18)
sage: timeit("a < b", number=500000, repeat=100)
500000 loops, best of 100: 87.1 ns per loop
```

Hello,

Replying to [comment:6 mmezzarobba]:
> It's not really a big deal, but I'm not much of a fan of these global `mpz_tmp`/`mpq_tmp`: this is one more thing that will break if it ever becomes possible to have multi-threaded sage code...


Me neither (and there is actually one in `sage.rings.integer` that is not from me). The ideal would be for gmp/mpir to provide a `mpq_cmp_mpz`. Do you think that it is reasonable to ask them?

> Did you check if there is a measurable performance benefit?


It is minor but timings are in the ticket description. In a more concrete situation

```
sage: l = [ZZ.random_element() for _ in range(100)]
sage: l.extend(QQ.random_element() for _ in range(100))
sage: shuffle(l)
sage: %time l.sort()
CPU times: user 0 ns, sys: 0 ns, total: 0 ns
Wall time: 1.21 ms
```
compared to

```
sage: %time l.sort()
CPU times: user 0 ns, sys: 0 ns, total: 0 ns
Wall time: 247 Âµs
```

> Also, couldn't `__richcmp__` just call itself instead of having duplicate code to handle the case where `right` is of the type defined by the class?


I do not know why it was done this way for integers. I just naively used the implementation of `Integer.__richcmp__` as a template.

> By the way, if you make further changes, perhaps you could take the occasion to make `_cmp_` use `rich_to_bool_sign` too.


Yes.

With

```

declaring global `mpz_tmp` and `mpq_tmp` I got

```
timeit("shuffle(l); l.sort()", number=5000, repeat=10)
5000 loops, best of 10: 131 Âµs per loop
```
and with local ones

```
sage: timeit("shuffle(l); l.sort()", number=5000, repeat=10)
5000 loops, best of 10: 177 Âµs per loop
```

Note that this bad scenario only occurs for comparisons of:
- Python long with Sage Integer
- Sage Rationals with Sage Integer, Python int, Python long

There is a slightly another annoying thing with the global `mpz_tmp/mpq_tmp`: `mpir/gmp` do not free the memory of a `mpz/mpq` if it is not asked explicitely. So if you compare a very big rational with a very big integer you will occupy some memory for the rest of the Sage session (similarly for a big Python long with a big Sage Integer).

I will try harder to see if there is a way to tweak `mpir` to avoid the creation of anything when we want to compare `mpz` to `mpq`. I think that having slow comparison Python long / Sage integer is not an issue. In other words, we should get rid of these global variables.
