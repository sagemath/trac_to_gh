MPIR 3.0.0 is shipped with the function `mpq_cmp_z(mpq_t, mpz_t)`. We can use it to make integer/rational comparisons much faster.

Comparing integers is very fast, comparing rationals is very fast but comparing integer with rational is about 5x slower:

```
sage: a = 1; b = 18
sage: timeit("a < b", number=500000, repeat=100)
500000 loops, best of 100: 64.3 ns per loop
sage: a = QQ(1); b = QQ(18)
sage: timeit("a < b", number=500000, repeat=100)
500000 loops, best of 100: 84 ns per loop
sage: a = 1; b = QQ(18)
sage: timeit("a < b", number=500000, repeat=100)
500000 loops, best of 100: 405 ns per loop
```

With the branch applied, it gets better

```
sage: a = 1; b = 18
sage: timeit("a < b", number=500000, repeat=100)
500000 loops, best of 100: 64 ns per loop
sage: a = QQ(1); b = QQ(18)
sage: timeit("a < b", number=500000, repeat=100)
500000 loops, best of 100: 65.6 ns per loop
sage: a = 1; b = QQ(18)
sage: timeit("a < b", number=500000, repeat=100)
500000 loops, best of 100: 87.1 ns per loop
```

Hello,

> It's not really a big deal, but I'm not much of a fan of these global `mpz_tmp`/`mpq_tmp`: this is one more thing that will break if it ever becomes possible to have multi-threaded sage code...

Me neither (and there is actually one in `sage.rings.integer` that is not from me). The ideal would be for gmp/mpir to provide a `mpq_cmp_mpz`. Do you think that it is reasonable to ask them?

> Did you check if there is a measurable performance benefit?

It is minor but timings are in the ticket description. In a more concrete situation

```
sage: l = [ZZ.random_element() for _ in range(100)]
sage: l.extend(QQ.random_element() for _ in range(100))
sage: shuffle(l)
sage: %time l.sort()
CPU times: user 0 ns, sys: 0 ns, total: 0 ns
Wall time: 1.21 ms
```
compared to

```
sage: %time l.sort()
CPU times: user 0 ns, sys: 0 ns, total: 0 ns
Wall time: 247 µs
```

> Also, couldn't `__richcmp__` just call itself instead of having duplicate code to handle the case where `right` is of the type defined by the class?

I do not know why it was done this way for integers. I just naively used the implementation of `Integer.__richcmp__` as a template.

Yes.

With 

```
sage: l = [ZZ.random_element() for _ in range(100)]
sage: l.extend(QQ.random_element() for _ in range(100))
```

declaring global `mpz_tmp` and `mpq_tmp` I got

```
timeit("shuffle(l); l.sort()", number=5000, repeat=10)
5000 loops, best of 10: 131 µs per loop
```
and with local ones

```
sage: timeit("shuffle(l); l.sort()", number=5000, repeat=10)
5000 loops, best of 10: 177 µs per loop
```

Note that this bad scenario only occurs for comparisons of:
- Python long with Sage Integer
- Sage Rationals with Sage Integer, Python int, Python long

There is a slightly another annoying thing with the global `mpz_tmp/mpq_tmp`: `mpir/gmp` do not free the memory of a `mpz/mpq` if it is not asked explicitely. So if you compare a very big rational with a very big integer you will occupy some memory for the rest of the Sage session (similarly for a big Python long with a big Sage Integer).

I will try harder to see if there is a way to tweak `mpir` to avoid the creation of anything when we want to compare `mpz` to `mpq`. I think that having slow comparison Python long / Sage integer is not an issue. In other words, we should get rid of these global variables.

Hi Vincent,

Do you still want to patch mpir after the answers you got on mpir-devel and gmp-devel? If you do: would the code from this ticket still work if sage is built with gmp?

Hi Marc,

Thanks for having a look.

Last news from GMP: they kind to agree that a `mpq_cmp_z` would be good (note that it is `mpq_cmp_mpz` in my branch). But I am not sure anything concrete already happened.

You are right, I need to also patch gmp in order to make Sage works. Another option is to wait for upstream upgrading from both GMP and mpir. What do you think? I mostly wanted to test it.

Looks more reasonable to me as well (I do not like to patch upstream). So I will push harder upstream to have these functions in the next releases.
