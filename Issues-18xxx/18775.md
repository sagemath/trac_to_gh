```
+    The truncated icosidodecahedron is an Archimedean solid with 12 vertices and

it should be "truncated tetrahedon".

And may I request a little pep8 effort ?

I have no idea what pep8 is about, and I do not intend to read (nor to follow) a document that tells me where I should put spaces before/after the '=' signs. Call me careless, but I find tickets #18904 way more important/urgent. Why people care more about spaces than things like that is beyond me.
