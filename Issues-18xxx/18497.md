    "body": "<a id='comment:10'></a>\nThis works for me, but not perfectly. In addition to the changes here, I used `sage --pip install` to install `snowballstemmer` and `alabaster`. I also had to change `exclude_trees` to `exclude_patterns` wherever it occurred in doc/common: `exclude_trees` was deprecated before and has now been removed. (This was in `src/doc/common/conf.py`, `src/doc/en/reference/conf.py`, `src/doc/en/reference/conf_sub.py`.)\n\nI ran into the issue mentioned in[comment:3](#comment%3A3), so I made those references more explicit (changed `_blah` to `Category._blah`, etc.). Then the file `sage/lfunctions/zero_sums.pyx` was giving me errors I didn't understand, for example\n\n```\nOSError: [lfunction] docstring of sage.lfunctions.zero_sums.LFunctionZeroSum_EllipticCurve:0: ERROR: Unknown interpreted text role \"class\".\n```\nSo I removed it from the reference manual.

This works for me, but not perfectly. In addition to the changes here, I used `sage --pip install` to install `snowballstemmer` and `alabaster`. I also had to change `exclude_trees` to `exclude_patterns` wherever it occurred in doc/common: `exclude_trees` was deprecated before and has now been removed. (This was in `src/doc/common/conf.py`, `src/doc/en/reference/conf.py`, `src/doc/en/reference/conf_sub.py`.)

I ran into the issue mentioned in[comment:3](#comment%3A3), so I made those references more explicit (changed `_blah` to `Category._blah`, etc.). Then the file `sage/lfunctions/zero_sums.pyx` was giving me errors I didn't understand, for example

```
OSError: [lfunction] docstring of sage.lfunctions.zero_sums.LFunctionZeroSum_EllipticCurve:0: ERROR: Unknown interpreted text role "class".
```
So I removed it from the reference manual. I'll keep looking at that file, though.

Then in the second pass through the reference manual, the build stopped with complaints about missing references or citations. Maybe Sphinx is pickier now, and wants the reference before any citations to it, so I moved some of them to the top-level docstring in the file, and that helped. There is a few cross-file references, and I don't know what to do about that one except to run Sphinx again and hope it resolves the reference. The build completed this way.

By the way, Sphinx 1.3.2 (a bug-fix release) is supposed to be released in a few days.

Replying to [jhpalmieri](#comment%3A65):
> Is this the formula on line 710 of `multi_modular.pyx`? That looks like it has extra backticks or dollar signs: the formula should have one or the other, not both.


Yes, that's it. And there is a similar problem in `src/sage/symbolic/expression.pyx` around line 8830.

```
 There are two square roots of `$(x + 1)^2$`
```
It appears this version of Sphinx is exposing some sphinx syntax issues in the documentation that now appear when generating the latex files for building the pdf-docs. The older sphinx -> latex must be a bit more forgiving.

Feel free to add commits to fix such issues. I will stop rebasing this branch to make it easier for other people to push fixes.

Sage now builds and all doctests pass with this branch. On first sight, the documentation looks good too.

The real problem is that docutils interprets this as a list item (and that's a feature!):

```
E. Assmus, J. Key, Designs and their codes, CUP, 1992.
```
This should work:
