without changing

```

So I removed it from the reference manual. I'll keep looking at that file, though.

Then in the second pass through the reference manual, the build stopped with complaints about missing references or citations. Maybe Sphinx is pickier now, and wants the reference before any citations to it, so I moved some of them to the top-level docstring in the file, and that helped.

The generated documentation doesn't look bad either, there is not much difference with the old version. One thing I noticed is that the `sage:` prompts are no longer syntax highlighted in a special way. This is probably a bug, in any case it makes the documentation look more boring.

Perhaps getting a bit ahead but if I force building the pdf-docs I get

```
                $
l.6285 \($\prod
               _j=1^{i-1} m_j^{-1} (mod m_i)$\)
```
which seems to come from

```
local/share/doc/sage/latex/en/reference/rings_standard/rings_standard.tex
```

The associated math formulas in

```
local/share/doc/sage/html/en/reference/rings_standard/sage/ext/multi_modular.html
```
don't look correct.

WikiFormatting is not working properly for me here. I can't get what I want inside a `{{{...}}}`

I fixed this problem by simply installing `alabaster`. It's a small package, so it's not worth the trouble to patch Sphinx for it. Also, while Sage doesn't use alabaster, maybe other packages do use it.

Replying to [jhpalmieri](#comment%3A65):
> Is this the formula on line 710 of `multi_modular.pyx`? That looks like it has extra backticks or dollar signs: the formula should have one or the other, not both.


Yes, that's it. And there is a similar problem in `src/sage/symbolic/expression.pyx` around line 8830.

```
 There are two square roots of `$(x + 1)^2$`
```
It appears this version of Sphinx is exposing some sphinx syntax issues in the documentation that now appear when generating the latex files for building the pdf-docs. The older sphinx -> latex must be a bit more forgiving.

Feel free to add commits to fix such issues. I will stop rebasing this branch to make it easier for other people to push fixes.

Sage now builds and all doctests pass with this branch. On first sight, the documentation looks good too.

The real problem is that docutils interprets this as a list item (and that's a feature!):

```
E. Assmus, J. Key, Designs and their codes, CUP, 1992.
```
This should work:

```diff
