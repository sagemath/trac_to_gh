Wrap the PARI library functions `nf_rnfeq`, `eltabstorel`, `eltabstorel_lift` and `eltreltoabs`.  These provide a slightly lower-level interface to `rnfeltabstorel` and `rnfeltreltoabs`, and have the advantage that one can avoid initialising a full PARI `rnf` structure.  This functionality will be used in a follow-up ticket.

Looks good to me.

I have used this opportunity to
- correct one typo in the doc (missing `::`)
- put all `raise` statements into python3 syntax.

I you agree with these cosmetic changes, you can set a positive review on my behalf.

Those functions you are adding should not be part of the public interface of `gen`, they are unsafe:

```
sage: pari(0).eltabstorel(0)
...
SignalError: Segmentation fault
```

If you really want to add them to `gen`, add an underscore (`_eltabstorel` instead of `eltabstorel`) to the method name and add a `WARNING` in the documentation that these are unsafe.

I can change this, but there are more methods like this:

```
sage: pari(0).pr_get_e()
...
SignalError: Segmentation fault
```
Maybe we should at some point make a better separation between functions that are also in GP (and do extra input checking) and PARI library functions (that crash when given wrong input).

I consider this a bug.

I think adding an underscore to all non-safe methods is an easy and good solution.

I thought about phrasing it like that, but to me "segfault" (besides perhaps being somewhat cryptic to many users) makes it sound like Sage crashes if this is called with the wrong arguments.  In fact, the segmentation fault is caught and a `SignalError` is raised.  Also, it is entirely possible that PARI will throw other kinds of errors for certain inputs.

After some further thought, I still think "raise errors" is better than "segfault".  We could write a longer warning to explain what could happen on bad input, but I don't think it is worth the effort...
