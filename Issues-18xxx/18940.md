For polynomials, we implement a generic `__getitem__()` method, which depends on a new Cython method `get_unsafe()` to get single coefficients.  Overall, this greatly simplifies the code.  Except for truncation `pol[:n]`, slicing for polynomials is deprecated, since there is no clear use case and it is not mathematically well-defined what the answer should be (see also comment [comment:39] and further below).

This fix allows us to simplify the method `PowerSeries_poly.__getitem__()`.  Also, the patch corrects some (previously wrong) slice bounds in `LaurentPolynomial_univariate.__getitem__()`.

For example, it wraps around negative `start` values (as in the Python convention that `L[-1]` with `L` a list returns the last item in `L`); this is incompatible with Sage's convention that `P[n]` returns 0 if `P` is a polynomial and `n < 0`.

OK, I added a warning and an example for this.

Also, in the meantime I realised that `step <= 0` is (1) not necessarily well-defined, and (2) may cause Sage to crash with the current implementation.  I added a few lines to detect this case and raise an `IndexError`.

That depends on if we want a slice of a polynomial returns a polynomial or a simple list of the coefficients. I am (very) slightly in favor of returning a polynomial, so with that `[0, 2, 4, 6, 8]`.

This would be okay with me as well, but I don't think my opinion here should weigh very much here because I am mostly ambivalent about this behavior since I don't have a use for it.

I would want this:

[0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 6, 0, 8]
```
Actually, my answer above was wrong and shouw be `[0, 0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 6, 0, 8]`. [Edit - Some changes due to me not thinking things completely through]

However, when trying to think about how this would work for Laurent polynomials, we currently have this behavior for `list`:

```
sage: R.<x> = LaurentPolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: p = ~x + 2 + 3*x + 4*x^2
sage: list(p)
[1, 2, 3, 4]
sage: p = 3*x + 4*x^2
sage: list(p)

In some ways I would say the iterator for polynomials should be changed to agree with that of Laurent polynomials, in that it starts from the lowest degree. Although I understand there are many (good) reasons why we do not want that behavior. I feel that at some point we just have to choose the least bad of all options and then put up warning messages about our choices.

Yes.  The fact that polynomials are usually written with decreasing exponents is just a historical convention.  I think it is absolutely reasonable that `pol[2:]` should return the monomials of degree 2 and higher, whether as a polynomial or as a list.  And in fact

```
sage: list(pol)
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```
so doing `list(pol)[2:]` also extracts the coefficients of the monomials of degree at least 2.

Similarly, in PARI, my experience is that `Vecrev` (which does the equivalent of `list` above) is more useful than `Vec` to extract the list of coefficients of a polynomial.

<a id='comment:32'></a>Mathematically, I can certainly imagine wanting the part of the polynomial between degrees 2 and 5: I might want this:

```
sage: f
-10*x^6 + 1/2*x^5 - x^4 + 7*x^3 - 2*x^2 + x - 3
sage: f[2:6]
1/2*x^5 - x^4 + 7*x^3 - 2*x^2
```
I don't know if I would ever want `f[2:6]` to return the polynomial with same coefficients but translated down in degree (i.e., `1/2*x^3 - x^2 + 7*x - 2`). Computationally, though, if I have that second result, I can easily get back to the first one by multiplying by `x^2`.

Alternatively, I can also get to the second by creating a polynomial from `list(f)[2:6]`, which is not as intuitive, but not too hard.

Surely different mathematicians will have different points of view on this.

I think this is the issue for me: do we want

```
sage: list(pol[5:]) == list(pol)[5:]
True
```
or do we want

```
sage: pol[:5] + pol[5:] == pol
True
```
We can't have both, right? I prefer the second. That is, I tend to think of polynomials as graded objects and slicing is returning some of their homogeneous components, and it seems most natural to do this without regrading the result: if a term is in degree 3 in the original polynomial, it should still be in degree 3 after slicing. I would also like this:

```
sage: pol[0:10:2] + pol[1:10:2] == pol[0:10]
True
```
Adding the even terms to the odd terms should yield the original polynomial.

A related question: should `f[2]` return `-2` or `-2 * x^2`?

---

When it comes down to it, I'm not sure I care which option is implemented as `__getitem__`, but perhaps both should be implemented as methods which are visible via tab-completion, or as a single method with a keyword which determines which option to use.

I think you are totally misunderstanding me. This is not at all about in *which order* the monomials are extracted. Obviously, PARI's `Vecrev()` is the right thing, I'm not arguing against that.

It's about

```
9*x^9 + 8*x^8 + 7*x^7 + 6*x^6 + 5*x^5 + 4*x^4 + 3*x^3 + 2*x^2
```
versus

```
9*x^7 + 8*x^6 + 7*x^5 + 6*x^4 + 5*x^3 + 4*x^2 + 3*x + 2

<a id='comment:41'></a>I can confirm that the Sage library doesn't use any polynomial slicing except for truncation `pol[:n]`. After adding

```
if start or step is not None:
    raise NotImplementedError
```
to the `__getitem__` methods, the only doctest failures were with slicing in the actual doctest example.

OK, I see.  As you can guess from how I interpreted your proposal, for me this is not the expected answer at all.

I would personally be quite happy with just deprecating the `start` and `stop` parameters and allowing polynomial slicing only for `pol[:n]`, i.e. truncation.  I think users can easily implement other forms of slicing via lists.

Splitting polynomials that actually represent power series expansions into an “approximation” and a “remainder“; removing the constant term of a polynomial; removing low-order terms that are know to be zero mathematically but are computed as intervals containing zero from a residual Φ(pol) where Φ is an operator and pol is a polynomial close to a zero of Φ.

I don't think I'd need it—any of the two basic forms of slicing (either “degree-keeping” or “degree-reducing”) is enough for me. Regardless whether “double slicing” is implemented, I'd prefer `pol[i:]` to keep working (with one of the two basic meanings, I don't really care which, though I find the “degree-keeping” version more intuitive with polynomials). It wouldn't be a big effort to change my code to work without slicing in any case.

For a use case where deprecating `pol[n:]` is annoying, if you have an Eisenstein polynomial `pol` and want to compute `p/x^n` modulo `pol`, it's natural to express it as `-(pol[n:] >> n) / (pol[:n] // p)`, where the division is taken modulo `pol`.  Obviously, this is doable with lists.
