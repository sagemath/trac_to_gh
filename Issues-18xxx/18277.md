`GF(5) x GF(5)` does not know that the multiplication is commutative!

```
sage: GF(5).cartesian_product(GF(5)) in Magmas().Commutative()
False
```
It would be reasonable to expect that the category is `Category of Cartesian products of rings`.

With the branch applied

```
sage: GF(5).cartesian_product(GF(5)).category()
Join of
  Category of finite commutative rings and
  Category of Cartesian products of commutative rings and
  Category of Cartesian products of finite enumerated sets
```
