Various source files were executable by mistake.

`setup.py` and `spkg-install`/`spkg-check` files on the other hand should actually be executable.

According to the following tests

```
find $SAGE_ROOT/src -type f ! -perm 755 ! -perm 644
find $SAGE_ROOT/src/bin -type f ! -perm 755 -exec echo {} \; -exec head -n 1 {} \;
find $SAGE_ROOT/src/bin -type f ! -perm 644 -exec echo {} \; -exec head -n 1 {} \;
find $SAGE_ROOT/src/doc -type f ! -perm 644
find $SAGE_ROOT/src/sage -type f ! -perm 644
find $SAGE_ROOT/src/ext -type f ! -perm 644 -exec echo {} \; -exec head -n 1 {} \;
find $SAGE_ROOT/src/ext -type f -exec head -n 1 {} \; | grep '^#!
```

The following scripts have a shebang and should be chmoded to 755: 

- `$SAGE_ROOT/src/bin/sage-arch-env`
- `$SAGE_ROOT/src/bin/sage-test-import`

The following image should be chmoded to 644

- `$SAGE_ROOT/src/doc/en/prep/media/Rplot001.png`

I removed the files

```
src/bin/sage-test-import
```
and

```
src/sage/dev/pre-commit
```
since I couldn't find any evidence that they are used. They were not executable, so just executing them wouldn't work anyway.

They are still two missing pkg scripts:

```

- `/opt/sagemath/sage//build/pkgs/tides/spkg-check`
- `/opt/sagemath/sage//build/pkgs/tides/spkg-install`

Concerning `dev` scripts, there is no evidence that anyone use them, but it seems that the policy is to keep them deprecated and untouched for a while (while removing from the doc):
