```
find $SAGE_ROOT/src -type f ! -perm 755 ! -perm 644
find $SAGE_ROOT/src/bin -type f ! -perm 755 -exec echo {} \; -exec head -n 1 {} \;

find $SAGE_ROOT/src/ext -type f -exec head -n 1 {} \; | grep '^#!
```

The following scripts have a shebang and should be chmoded to 755: 

- `$SAGE_ROOT/src/bin/sage-arch-env`
- `$SAGE_ROOT/src/bin/sage-test-import`

The following image should be chmoded to 644

- `$SAGE_ROOT/src/doc/en/prep/media/Rplot001.png`
