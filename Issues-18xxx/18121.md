Various places in Sage need access to `PyTypeObject` members. There is currently no consistent way how this is done. Fix this by adding all declarations to Cython and removing `src/sage/ext/python_rich_object.pxi`.

I have made two upstream pull requests:
- [https://github.com/cython/cython/pull/378](https://github.com/cython/cython/pull/378)
- [https://github.com/cython/cython/pull/379](https://github.com/cython/cython/pull/379)

These got accepted with some additional changes. Since it involved several commits, I simply upgraded the whole `Cython/Includes` directory to the latest Cython git master (but I changed the relative `cimport`s back to absolute since that needs a [bug-fix](https://github.com/cython/cython/pull/380) which isn't in Cython 0.22).

You are using

```
from cpython.object cimport PyObject
```
instead of

```
from .object cimport PyObject
```
why is that? It is not supported in our Cython 0.22?

Why `void Py_VISIT(PyObject *o)` is not compatible with Cython? I do not quite understand what is this `__pyx_v_visit`. Is it because of Cython renaming arguments? If it is so, I do not find it very safe. Though, your version of `MonoDict_traverse` looks nicer.

Could you explain to me the reason of declaring

```
    int PyList_SetItem(object list, Py_ssize_t index, PyObject * item) except -1
```
and not use the `PyList_SetItem` from `cpython.lists` declared as `(object,Py_ssize_t,object)`? It would also be cool to add a comment if it is important to keep as such.

In `sage/structure/coerce_dict.pyx`, couldn't you get rid of

```
cdef extern from "Python.h":
    PyObject* PyWeakref_GetObject(object r)
```
It is in `cpython.weakref`.

Do you know why `Py_None` is not available from Cython?

Could we also remove or comment the `cpdef inline Py_ssize_t signed_id(x)`?

See its use in `extract_*` functions. It's handling `PyObject*` there and a cast to `object` would generate an INCREF (which is really not what you want to do in code that's just deleting things). This ticket doesn't affect that code.

So it is now! I don't think it was before.

> Do you know why `Py_None` is not available from Cython?

It is as "None", but then it's an `object`, and we need to compare it as a `PyObject *`. Cython's support for `PyObject *` (i.e., borrowed references) is poor -- basically intentionally so at the moment because a good interface (other than just the C interface) hasn't been formulated yet.

> Could we also remove or comment the `cpdef inline Py_ssize_t signed_id(x)`?

No objections to that.

How about generalizing the macro to accept `visit` and `arg` arguments?

Fine with me. It's brainless boilerplate, but at least we have a clean macro that way that doesn't depend on naming conventions and (undocumented) cython behaviour.

OK, "twice"= in two simple, trivial, boilerplate routines :-).

Both questions have the same answer: using `PyObject*` instead of `object` is the right thing in this specific use case. Cython isn't wrong, it's just that we are doing very low-level stuff for which the standard Cython declarations don't work.

Apparently we're only dereferencing weakrefs we are actually owning (i.e., `object`s).

I am pretty sure that if this is now available in cpython.weakref, we can cimport it from there rather than explicitly "cdef extern" it from "Python.h". Of course, there will be absolutely no difference to the eventual code generated either.

So what?  Besides that `vbraun_spam` appears to be on holidays since a while, certainly 6.6 got released before this ticket got closed.  (And it's based on 6.7.beta2.)

If someone sees a closed milestone on a (closed) ticket, the first guess is that it'd been merged into that release.

I'm certainly not the only one not wanting having to read the ticket history and/or to look up the parent(s) of the commit to find out whether that's true or not.

Especially "ordinary" Sage users simply won't do that, e.g. if they want to find out whether a bug has already been fixed, and if so, in which [stable] release.

Why?  (Pointer?)

If so, then at least the milestone should get corrected by the authors/reviewers or the RM before it gets closed.

But it's annoying to have open (new/needs review/whatever) tickets for already closed milestones; usual queries will no longer work (as expected).

The only thing one needs is a "spam" trac account... ;-)

Quoting Ivan: *"Why can’t we just set them all to future, **and then when they get merged, we can change the milestone to the actual version**?"*
