```
This:

```
sage: bool(exp(x)>=0)
True
```
unexpectedly uses Maxima, and gets it wrong, too (the already known complex domain problem, see e.g. #14305).

Since Pynac can now assign info flags to function expressions the possible cases for `abs`, `factorial`, `binomial`, `real`, `imag`, `step` should be implemented in Pynac (this is https://github.com/pynac/pynac/issues/78) and the cases like above handled in Pynac.

The repercussions are not limited to such comparisons. The more expressions have info flags set the more expressions with more complicated structure can be decided and more questions answered.
