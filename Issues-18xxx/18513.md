Well, there is one generated by 'cat' when the file does not exist, and it prints something specific about what the content of the 'type' file should be when it is invalid.

Do you want something 'hand-made' when the file does not exist?

I actually think that this is pretty clear, it explicitly says which file is missing:

```
$ rm build/pkgs/r/type  # Just for testing
$ make
cd build && \
"../build/pipestatus" \
        "env SAGE_PARALLEL_SPKG_BUILD='' ./install all 2>&1" \
        "tee -a ../logs/install.log"
cat: /usr/local/src/sage-config/build/pkgs/r/type: No such file or directory
Makefile:19: recipe for target 'build' failed
make: *** [build] Error 1
```
However, to reduce confusion, it doesn't hurt to add an extra error message.

There does not seem to be a conflict with #17607. But I find what was done there *VERY* dirty. A 'clean' way out would have been to
1) Create a 'standard' virtual 'Python' package with dependency on 'python_2_or_3'
2) Make python2 and python3 optional
3) Create in build/install a rule 'python_2_or_3' depending on python2 or python3.

There would have been no need of adding two new types, and no need to change filtered_packages_list.
