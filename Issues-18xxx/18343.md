1. Creating libGAP integers from python int is broken

```
sage: libgap(2r**61r)
...
OverflowError: value too large to convert to int
```
  This is due to a cast to a C `<int>` in `sage.libs.gap.*` (Python integers do not necessarily fit into an `int` (though they do in a long)).

2. Creating libGAP integers from Sage integers is very slow since it goes through the string representation! As GAP internally uses mpz it could be very fast.

This would be fixed by #31404.  Of course, this ticket should still be kept open until/unless that one is merged.
