1. Creating libGAP integers from python int is broken

```
sage: libgap(2r**61r)
...
OverflowError: value too large to convert to int
```
  This is due to a cast to a C `<int>` in `sage.libs.gap.*` (Python integers do not necessarily fit into an `int` (though they do in a long)).

2. Creating libGAP integers from Sage integers is very slow since it goes through the string representation! As GAP internally uses mpz it could be very fast.
