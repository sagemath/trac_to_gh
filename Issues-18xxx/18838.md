> - Why are you removing `GLP_EOPFS` and `GLP_EODFS` ? (I don't know the meaning of these variables)
 
I remove  `GLP_EOPFS` and `GLP_EODFS`  because they are misspelled. They should be:
`GLP_ENOPFS`: "The LP (relaxation) problem has no primal feasible solution";
`GLP_ENODFS`: "The LP (relaxation) problem has no dual feasible solution",

> - `This algorithm can be requested explicitly by setting the solver parameter "simplex_or_intopt" to "intopt_only".` The example following this statement does not examplify it. Where are you setting the solver parameter?
 
`glp_intopt` is the default value for the solver parameter `simplex_or_intopt`, unless all variables are continuous.
