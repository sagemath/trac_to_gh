The current Mathematica interface to Sage relies on the command-line interface that ships with Mathematica and can break if WRI makes changes to that command-line interface (see #13892, #15318, and #16703). This ticket replaces WRI's command-line interface with an equivalent interface (which itself uses WSTP/MathLink) that is a drop-in replacement. The Sage project can thus guarantee the stability of the interface under the assumption of the stability of the WSTP/MathLink protocol.
