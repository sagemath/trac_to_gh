Currently the Kyoto path model only uses KR crystals, and as such, does not allow for the extended weight lattice to be used. This ticket will implement the affinization crystal of KR crystals and use them to construct the Kyoto path model.

Turns out the Kyoto path model was not computing its weight correctly as it was not adding in the contribution from the remaining highest weight crystal not appearing in its representation.

I made that change and I think all places in the documentation that needed it. I also change the output of the one doctest back (I am curious as to why Ben is getting a different output for those ones in particular).

sage: b = B.highest_weight_vector()
