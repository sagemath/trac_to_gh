Currently the Kyoto path model only uses KR crystals, and as such, does not allow for the extended weight lattice to be used. This ticket will implement the affinization crystal of KR crystals and use them to construct the Kyoto path model.

Turns out the Kyoto path model was not computing its weight correctly as it was not adding in the contribution from the remaining highest weight crystal not appearing in its representation.

Hi Travis,

Here is my output (which is different from yours):

```
sage: cmp(int(0), 'delta')

sage: cmp('delta', int(0))

sage: cmp('delta', 0)
-1

Okay, so here's the difference (and why this test is failing):

```
sage: B = crystals.KirillovReshetikhin(['A',2,1], 1,1)
sage: P = RootSystem(['A',2,1]).weight_lattice(extended=True)
sage: C = crystals.KyotoPathModel(B, P.fundamental_weight(0))
sage: x = C.module_generators[0].f_string([0,1,2])
sage: [type(_) for _ in x.weight().support()]
[<type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>, <type 'str'>]

sage: B = crystals.LSPaths(['A',1,1],[1,0])
sage: b = B.highest_weight_vector()
sage: [type(_) for _ in b.f(0).weight().support()]
[<type 'int'>, <type 'int'>, <type 'str'>]
```
Looking into why the type suddenly changes (which I think is an easier fix and better for consistency at this point, although perhaps on some ticket we should make it so that the comparison between a Sage integer and a `str` works the same as an `int` and a `str`).
