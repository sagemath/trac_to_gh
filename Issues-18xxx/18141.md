The functions in `transcentental.py` could return special values:
* `zetaderiv(0,1)=-1/2*log(2*pi)`, http://dlmf.nist.gov/25.6#E11
* `zetaderiv(0,2)=-1/2*log(2*pi)^2+...`, http://dlmf.nist.gov/25.6#E12, needs Euler constants
* `hurwitz_zeta`, we already have:

 ```
 sage: hurwitz_zeta(5,1/2)
 31*zeta(5)
 sage: hurwitz_zeta(x,1/2)
 hurwitz_zeta(x, 1/2)
```
 The latter should be `(2^x-1)*zeta(x)`. Also `hurwitz_zeta(0,...)` is missing, http://dlmf.nist.gov/25.11#v


This ticket may also discuss: are there closed forms without `zeta` for
* `zeta` with odd positive argument: http://dlmf.nist.gov/25.6#E6 ?

Hi!

I'm rather motivated to implement some of the special values mentioned above; and I guess the "correct" place would be `src/functions/transcendental.py`, wouldn't it?

However, I'm not quite sure of how to tackle the implementation of the [Stieltjes constants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stieltjes_constants). I think that it would be elegant if the constants were also available in pynac (such that `zeta(s).series(s==1)` could yield the appropriate series expansion directly).

The problem with this approach is, that I'm not sure of how to implement a familiy of constants in pynac---or even just in sage.

What do you think about moving the part with the Stieltjes constants to a separate ticket?

Yes, where the functions are.

To recap GiNaC/Pynac by default implements series by differentiation so a naive way to get a nice expansion would be to implement special values of the derivatives like in #17678 with the Bessel functions. With `zetaderiv` this doesn't look like resulting in something usable:

```
sage: zeta(x).series(x==1,2)
1*(x - 1)^(-1) + (euler_gamma + log(2) + log(pi) + 2*zetaderiv(1, 0)) + (1/2*euler_gamma^2 - 1/24*pi^2 + (euler_gamma + log(pi) + 2*zetaderiv(1, 0))*log(2) + 1/2*log(2)^2 + (euler_gamma + 2*zetaderiv(1, 0))*log(pi) + 1/2*log(pi)^2 + 2*euler_gamma*zetaderiv(1, 0) - zetaderiv(2, 0))*(x - 1) + Order((x - 1)^2)
```
I haven't fiddled with Pynac series yet so I'm naive on how to get a different output for this. I'm also not exactly at home with complex analysis.
> The problem with this approach is, that I'm not sure of how to implement a familiy of constants in pynac---or even just in sage.

In Sage there is `symbolic/constants*` with three source files. Earlier I had started written about the Pynac side in https://github.com/pynac/pynac/wiki/%7C-constants

To implement a family of symbolic constants (i.e. indexed) would be a first.

However, at first glance I see no reason why `Stieltjes` could not be another function taking only arguments from NN.

It looks like this is a sensible approach.

See #19834.

Please open a ticket showing which result you would expect from a zeta expansion using the `Stieltjes` "function" from #19834 so that I know what I should do in Pynac for the series expansion.

This is a good idea; I'll open a ticket for the zeta-expansion. Should I also open an issue for pynac?

Also, the numerical evaluation of the Stieltjes constants would be implemented in Sage (by some sort of `_evalf_` or `_eval_` I guess)---or would you need to add some sort of method in pynac as well?

Regarding this ticket: as it turns out, there are closed-form formulae for `zetaderiv(k, 0)` in general, cf. [this paper, Theorem 3 and (14)](http://www.ams.org/journals/mcom/1985-44-169/S0025-5718-1985-0771044-5/S0025-5718-1985-0771044-5.pdf).

The question is, whether we want that kind of expansion to happen for all k, or just for reasonably small k (as far as I can tell, these expansions really blow up fast in terms of summands).
