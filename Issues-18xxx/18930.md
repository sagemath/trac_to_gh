For the sake of usability we have introduced a short notation for growth groups (implemented at #17600).

For various reasons, having a factory that is able to generate a growth group from such a "short representation string" is desireable: for example, such a factory enables us to implement a user-friendly way of interacting with the AsymptoticRing (implemented at #17716).

This ticket provides an implementation for such a factory (which can be extended easily to cover cartesian products of growth groups as well).

See #17601 for a roadmap and the planned structure.
