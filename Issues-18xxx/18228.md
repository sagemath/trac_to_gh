As discussed at [sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/tQhromqp9hQ/KDCvCnKEd1kJ), pushing new commits to a ticket with status `positive_review` might lead to a race condition resulting in merging the previous commit.

Thus change the developer guide to reflect this.

Hello Clemens,

I have a problem with what you want to add to the manual: adding commits to tickets in `positive_review` state is something that people do all the time, and there is not much danger in doing so. It happens when you notice that you forgot a typo, it happens when you forgot a bug, it happens when you find a better way to rewrite something.. Well, it happens all the time and it is almost always harmless. I do not think that it should be forbidden by the manual.

Hello Nathann,

I also thought that until that [discussion at sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/tQhromqp9hQ/KDCvCnKEd1kJ) where no other consensus was reached and until I found 7 tickets within the last year which were not completely merged.

I think that the danger of loosing commits due to the current workflow of the release manager is higher than simply doing this change here.

Kind regards, Clemens

One thing I don't really like about this ticket is that it refers to the preferences of *the current release manager*. This is unlike everything else in the Sage manual, which is general Sage policy.

Hello Clemens,

I totally agree with you on the fact that this is both tricky and dangerous. On the other hand adding commits to positively reviewed tickets is something that we do, and pretty often. Not only when we have forgotten a typo/bug, but also in many cases when somebody sees a positively reviewed ticket and *objects* with what is being done inside.

In this case that person will usually set the ticket back to `needs_work` or `needs_info` to talk about the problem (s)he thinks the ticket contains.

What I want to say is that having a rule like this would change radically the way we do things in Sage. Thus, I am not saying that the problem should not be addressed but rather that this is not a good way to solve it.

From the point of view of the release manager, however, this is very easy to detect: when he is about to merge a ticket, he can compare what he merges with the current head of the branch. I it not very complicated to implement, whatever script he uses.

This however, would still mean that he would run tests of a branch *before* noticing that the branch has changed. What about this second way out: when he starts the tests on a branch before merging it, he could 'freeze' the ticket (either by changing its status to 'closed: branch testing' or even by only adding an (automatic) message on the ticket saying "this branch is being tested, don't change its content".

Those two solutions (the second especially) are in my opinion much better than changing the way we work, in particular because they don't add new procedures and things to keep in mind when you contribute. The process is less than straightforward and having an automatic message posted on a ticket saying 'the release manager is running tests on its ticket before inclusion' is both educative and a solution to the problem.

As outlined by Volker in the sage-devel thread, this might lead to an infinite loop.

> Those two solutions (the second especially) are in my opinion much better than changing the way we work

If you convince the release manager to do that, I'll happily set modify this branch to include the proposed semantics.

Kind regards,

Hello,

`O_o`

I do not know what you have in mind, for here is the procedure I mentionned in the post to which you answer

---
From the point of view of the release manager, however, this is very easy to detect: when he is about to merge a ticket, he can compare what he merges with the current head of the branch. I it not very complicated to implement, whatever script he uses.
---

I see no infinite loop there.

> If you convince the release manager to do that, I'll happily set modify this branch to include the proposed semantics.

If you insist on changing the rules, please open a sage-devel thread explaining its consequences: no last-minute typo/bugfix, and no way to set to `needs_work` a ticket in `positive_review`. I am personally against it.

Hello Nathann,

I had troubles with trac once more, I did not accept my answers, so I shortened them until I could press the submit button. So I try not to use the reply function, perhaps then trac will accept longer answers.

You are right, I am not sure whether I understand your first suggestion.

My understanding from the sage-devel thread is that the release manager merges a certain number of positive_review tickets into his private develop branch, runs some tests, and if those pass, he then closes the tickets without looking at them again. This may take several hours.

If he'd look at the ticket again and would see a mismatch, he'd have to repeat the whole procedure, and this might lead to an infinite loop. And in his words, "Having the release manager chase after branches as people keep adding stuff after review is not a sustainable workflow".

Concerning your second point: *I* do not insist on changing the rules. I have opened a sage-devel thread, linked above. Several suggestions, some of them similar to yours, have been made by several people, but the release manager did not show any indication of changing his point of view that a ticket with positive review must not be changed.

I think that the issue has to be resolved as the 7 tickets show. Therefore, as the easiest solution, I propose this ticket.

I never understood that proposal: a two-weeks cooling down period might reduce the probability of another push to a ticket, but does not make them impossible.

For those who rely on the diff view of trac, a two weeks interval would mean that reviewing chains of dependent tickets would take months.

I believe that a branch like yours shouldn't be accepted without a poll on sage-devel. You should explain the change that you want to make, your reasons for doing so, and the consequences that you are aware of.

Thanks,
