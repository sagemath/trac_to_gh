As discussed at [sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/tQhromqp9hQ/KDCvCnKEd1kJ), pushing new commits to a ticket with status `positive_review` might lead to a race condition resulting in merging the previous commit.

Thus change the developer guide to reflect this.

I think that the danger of loosing commits due to the current workflow of the release manager is higher than simply doing this change here.

What I want to say is that having a rule like this would change radically the way we do things in Sage. Thus, I am not saying that the problem should not be addressed but rather that this is not a good way to solve it.

From the point of view of the release manager, however, this is very easy to detect: when he is about to merge a ticket, he can compare what he merges with the current head of the branch. I it not very complicated to implement, whatever script he uses.

This however, would still mean that he would run tests of a branch *before* noticing that the branch has changed.

As outlined by Volker in the sage-devel thread, this might lead to an infinite loop.

If you convince the release manager to do that, I'll happily set modify this branch to include the proposed semantics.

`O_o`

I do not know what you have in mind, for here is the procedure I mentionned in the post to which you answer

If you insist on changing the rules, please open a sage-devel thread explaining its consequences: no last-minute typo/bugfix, and no way to set to `needs_work` a ticket in `positive_review`. I am personally against it.

<a id='comment:13'></a>Hello Nathann,

I had troubles with trac once more, I did not accept my answers, so I shortened them until I could press the submit button. So I try not to use the reply function, perhaps then trac will accept longer answers.

You are right, I am not sure whether I understand your first suggestion.

My understanding from the sage-devel thread is that the release manager merges a certain number of positive_review tickets into his private develop branch, runs some tests, and if those pass, he then closes the tickets without looking at them again. This may take several hours.

If he'd look at the ticket again and would see a mismatch, he'd have to repeat the whole procedure, and this might lead to an infinite loop. And in his words, "Having the release manager chase after branches as people keep adding stuff after review is not a sustainable workflow".

Concerning your second point: *I* do not insist on changing the rules. I have opened a sage-devel thread, linked above. Several suggestions, some of them similar to yours, have been made by several people, but the release manager did not show any indication of changing his point of view that a ticket with positive review must not be changed.

I never understood that proposal: a two-weeks cooling down period might reduce the probability of another push to a ticket, but does not make them impossible.
