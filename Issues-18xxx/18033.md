In graphics.py, a bit of refactoring could be done
by creating a common parent for `Graphics`
and `GraphicsArray` (maybe something like `GraphicsBase`).

Various show methods should maybe get moved to the
`SageObject` class, or perhaps in some category.

If #27865 solved this, set the ticket's milestone
to sage-duplicate/invalid/wontfix, so we can close.

Otherwise, it would be good to assess more precisely
what is left to do here.
