Currently `ModulesWithBasis` requires its implementations to behave like `CombinatorialFreeModule`, along with having an indexing set for the basis which is comparable. The aim of this ticket is to move various methods from `CombintorialFreeModule` and it's element class to `ModulesWithBasis`. This ticket will also give better generic functionality, such as a default implementation of `support`.

+1! This is the way to go, and thanks for doing it.

However, one thing I'm still missing is an explicit explanation of what methods one needs to implement in order to inherit from `ModulesWithBasis`. I suspect this is no longer up-to-date:

```
        # To implement a module_with_basis you need to implement either
        #   basis() or an _indices attribute and monomial().
```
(as in, we probably need more now), right? 

Coercion of coefficients into the base ring needs to be carefully thought over. As of now, I am not sure if it works correctly. For instance, `term` does no coercion, but `__invert__` does `self.parent().term(one, ~mcs[one])`, although the inversion operator `~` might produce an element of a bigger ring (for example, `~(ZZ(2))` returns `1/2`).

One more thing, which is probably not your fault but just caught my eyes. The docstring of `module_morphism` says:

```
            - ``matrix``   -- a matrix of size `\dim X \times \dim Y`
              or `\dim Y \times \dim X`
```
I don't see why the "or" is here. The doctests show that `\dim Y \times \dim X` works, but does `\dim X \times \dim Y` work too? And if so, *should* it? I think checking whether the matrix has the "wrong" dimensions, and then trying to fix them by transposing it, would be a brittle paradigm. 

Also, could we have doctests proving that the `monomial_coefficients` method works correctly (including not mutating the dictionary unless explicitly required) on various instances of `ModulesWithBasis` (e.g., vector spaces)? Thank you!

    "body": "<a id='comment:6'>Comment 6:</a>\nSo in my latest commit I fixed doctests. Some were trivial due to `support` no longer being ordered (and hence changes to the k-schur book tests and the cc of Anne and Mike), some were more substantial:\n\n- `ChainComplexes` when passed a field said `VectorSpaces`, and so it did not consider itself as having a distinguished basis. However, if you give it a ring (like `ZZ`), then it became in `ModulesWithBasis` (=`FreeModules`), which it currently does not live from what I saw. Since there wasn't anything using this extra functionality (any attempt to use it was likely broken), I opted to downgrade the category to just `Modules`. (John, I cc'ed you to let you know.)\n\n- I added a `dense_coefficient_list` for finite dimensional modules with basis so that you could get an ordered list of coefficients including 0's. This was needed for hyperplane arrangements. I'm open to different names.\n\n- I made the linear expression code be in finite dimensional modules with basis.\n\nReplying to [@darijgr](#comment%3A3):\n> However, one thing I'm still missing is an explicit explanation of what methods one needs to implement in order to inherit from `ModulesWithBasis`. I suspect this is no longer up-to-date:\n> \n> ```\n>         # To implement a module_with_basis you need to implement either\n>         #   basis() or an _indices attribute and monomial().\n> ```\n> (as in, we probably need more now), right? \n\nI put that in there because that is all that should be required. However, how the code breaks and the traceback tells you everything you need to know as far as what to implement.\n\n> Coercion of coefficients into the base ring needs to be carefully thought over. As of now, I am not sure if it works correctly. For instance, `term` does no coercion, but `__invert__` does `self.parent().term(one, ~mcs[one])`, although the inversion operator `~` might produce an element of a bigger ring (for example, `~(ZZ(2))` returns `1/2`).\n\nActually my generic implementation should handle this with grace as it is `coeff * self.monomial(index)`. However, CFM currently does not do any coercion as indicated in the docstring, but that is a discussion for another ticket.\n\n> One more thing, which is probably not your fault but just caught my eyes. The docstring of `module_morphism` says:\n> \n> ```\n>             - ``matrix``   -- a matrix of size `\\dim X \\times \\dim Y`\n>               or `\\dim Y \\times \\dim X`\n> ```\n> I don't see why the \"or\" is here.

<a id='comment:6'>Comment 6:</a>
So in my latest commit I fixed doctests. Some were trivial due to `support` no longer being ordered (and hence changes to the k-schur book tests and the cc of Anne and Mike), some were more substantial:

- `ChainComplexes` when passed a field said `VectorSpaces`, and so it did not consider itself as having a distinguished basis. However, if you give it a ring (like `ZZ`), then it became in `ModulesWithBasis` (=`FreeModules`), which it currently does not live from what I saw. Since there wasn't anything using this extra functionality (any attempt to use it was likely broken), I opted to downgrade the category to just `Modules`. (John, I cc'ed you to let you know.)

- I added a `dense_coefficient_list` for finite dimensional modules with basis so that you could get an ordered list of coefficients including 0's. This was needed for hyperplane arrangements. I'm open to different names.

- I made the linear expression code be in finite dimensional modules with basis.

Replying to [@darijgr](#comment%3A3):

I put that in there because that is all that should be required. However, how the code breaks and the traceback tells you everything you need to know as far as what to implement.

> Coercion of coefficients into the base ring needs to be carefully thought over. As of now, I am not sure if it works correctly. For instance, `term` does no coercion, but `__invert__` does `self.parent().term(one, ~mcs[one])`, although the inversion operator `~` might produce an element of a bigger ring (for example, `~(ZZ(2))` returns `1/2`).

Actually my generic implementation should handle this with grace as it is `coeff * self.monomial(index)`. However, CFM currently does not do any coercion as indicated in the docstring, but that is a discussion for another ticket.

I don't know and I don't really care as that is outside of the scope of this ticket.

Added.

As far as I know, that was indeed the motivation when Mike H implemented it. I imagine it can make sense in certain cases where many different morphisms are applied. But I don't have a strong opinion either.
