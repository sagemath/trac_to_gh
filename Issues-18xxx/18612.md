This is a regression caused by the partial fix in #18463.

matrix_plot(identity_matrix(5))

has the y-axis labels ascending, while they should be descending.

```
Looks great, but y-axis labels reversed (known bug from #18463).

```

```
Labels correct, but image upside-down.

Could we just ("just") use [pyplot.yticks](http://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html#matplotlib.pyplot.yticks) to get the vertical ticks and then immediately reverse their order?  Or something like

```
sage: m.gca().get_yticks()
array([ -2.,   0.,   2.,   4.,   6.,   8.,  10.,  12.])
sage: m.gca().set_yticks(m.gca().get_yticks()[::-1])
```
I can't get this to quite work because I don't have the tkagg enabled for my Sage matplotlib, but inside of Sage something doing this should (hopefully) work.

I think that it is more complicated than that.

I know next to nothing about the Sage graphics system, please feel free to clarify any blatant falsehoods.

The MatrixPlot object is a GraphicsPrimitive and is responsible for drawing the image.  The axes are drawn by the containing Graphics object which contains the MatrixPlot.  There may be a member of Graphics that allows us to relabel the axes that we could call in `matrix_plot`, but I do not know what it would be.

The more I look at this, I think that the best short term solution would be to back out #18463 and put an `abs` in `_limit_output_aspect_ratio`.  This is possibly wrong in terms of composed plots, but things would work correctly for the use cases that we have now.  It would not be incorrect in the case that ymax>ymin, just somewhat wasteful.

Does there exist high level documentation of the Graphics subsytem somewhere?  Something which describes how sums of plots are supposed to work, how to draw different axes for different plots in a single Graphics object would be nice.

Also, for my or other testing reference, do
