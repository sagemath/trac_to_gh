This fails quite frequently:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
```
This is a consequence of a recent PARI upgrade, because `malloc()` is used in a place where it wasn't used before. The cause is exactly the same as #16850.

For PARI, we should be able to fix this using `PARI_SIGINT_block` which is like `sig_block()` but for the PARI library.

It's the PARI library interface, so #10476 cannot be the cause. My bet would something in PARI itself.

I understand your sentiment, but at least it fixes a bug which I don't know how to fix otherwise. You should also understand that I never claimed that cysignals is 100% bullet-proof. We try to fix most use cases but now and then something breaks (see #24986 for example).

Moving this to upstream Cython won't magically fix the PARI problem.

Besides, I don't think that there is much reason to push it to Cython now that we have cysignals.
