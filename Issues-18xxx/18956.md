This work depends on #16697, but I'd like to start it now.

There is a quite simple identity for the incomplete gamma functions:


    gamma(x) == gamma_inc_lower(x, y) + gamma_inc(x, y)

In the mathematica three-argument-gamma notation, this is a bit more clearly true:

    gamma(x, 0, oo) == gamma(x, 0, y) + gamma(x, y, oo)


What bits of sage do I need to patch to teach the simplifier about this identity? Is this something I can do as a plain-old user? Also, what bits of the documentation cover this aspect of symbolic symplification, from both user and contributor perspectives?

Depends on #16697

The `simplify*/expand*` member functions are covered in http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/calculus/sage/symbolic/expression.html. Most of them use Maxima.

As to the details, best would be a function named `expand_xyz` because you expand `gamma(x)`, or `rewrite_xyz`.

As to the second identity, we still haven't the gamma with three parameters.

Thanks!

To be clear, there's just one identity here, with two notations.
I expect if/when we gain a three-argument gamma, the simplification logic won't need to be modified in order to Just Work.
