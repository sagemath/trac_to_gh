This work depends on #16697, but I'd like to start it now.

There is a quite simple identity for the incomplete gamma functions:


    gamma(x) == gamma_inc_lower(x, y) + gamma_inc(x, y)

In the mathematica three-argument-gamma notation, this is a bit more clearly true:

    gamma(x, 0, oo) == gamma(x, 0, y) + gamma(x, y, oo)


What bits of sage do I need to patch to teach the simplifier about this identity? Is this something I can do as a plain-old user? Also, what bits of the documentation cover this aspect of symbolic symplification, from both user and contributor perspectives?

**CC:**  @paulmasson

**Dependencies:** #16697

The `simplify*/expand*` member functions are covered in http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/calculus/sage/symbolic/expression.html. Most of them use Maxima. If you have a function that does this rewrite it should be added in this module, and probably also to one of the `simplify*/expand*` functions. As to the details, best would be a function named `expand_xyz` because you expand `gamma(x)`, or `rewrite_xyz`. The same documentation contains specifics on pattern matching and overall expression manipulation, which is needed here.

As to the second identity, we still haven't the gamma with three parameters.

Thanks!

To be clear, there's just one identity here, with two notations.
I expect if/when we gain a three-argument gamma, the simplification logic won't need to be modified in order to Just Work.
