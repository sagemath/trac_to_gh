For installation from source, the Installation Guide suggests

```
     sudo apt-get install binutils gcc make m4 perl tar
```
on Linux, which might work (building Sage's GCC), but with no mention that the above is not sufficient to build Sage *without its GCC*.

I'd simply add `g++` and `gfortran` there, or a second line including these with a remark that those are the packages one has to install if one doesn't want to build Sage's GCC (which I think is the usual case).

Well, that's a rather unusual case (and I'm not aware of any distro where this would currently happen), and mentioned in the previous section [Fortran and compiler suites](http://sagemath.org/doc/installation/source.html#fortran-and-compiler-suites).  The (second) list of packages is sufficient in any case, whether Sage's GCC will get built or not.
