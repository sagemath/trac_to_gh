Implement subsemigroups generated by elements of an ambient
semigroups, lazily constructing all the elements and their Cayley
graph relations.

Here is a quick example from the documentation:

```
sage: R = IntegerModRing(12)
sage: R.submonoid([R(3), R(5)], one = R.one())
sage: M.cardinality()
4
```

This builds on and supersedes the old patch
`automatic_monoid-nt.patch` from the Sage-Combinat mercurial queue.

<a id='comment:34'></a>Hello,

The commit I just made is stupid: I did not checked I correctly pulled before so it merged pretty well with the last one you made. The second one only corrects some typo in the documentation (mainly I replaced 'monoids' by 'semigroups' to be accurate with the last commits).

The method one() is provided whether the constructed object is a monoid (which is great) or is a semigroup (which is less great). Would not it be better to define this method in the constructor only if the `AutomaticSemigroup` is in `Monoids` ?
There is no real example where the ambient semigroup is actually a semigroup (ie not a Monoid),
may we add and play with the following in the doc ?

```
sage: S = Semigroups().Finite().example()
sage: A = AutomaticSemigroup(Family({1: S('a'), 2: S('ca'), 3: S('bc')}))
sage: A in Semigroups() and A not in Monoids()
True
```

Cheers,
Aladin

<a id='comment:45'></a>Hi Aladin, Anne,

Following a suggestion of Aladin, and Anne's experience with using the ticket in practice, I made a few further changes (better handling of one + submonoid method). I also merged 17160 and rc2. Running the full long tests now, but the tests in the relevant category files + automatic_semigroup.py pass.

We are looking for a multiplicative monoid here, not additive. So I don't see from the top of my head how to do it with `gcd`. I might be missing something though. And I certainly agree that there must be some better way than brute force in such a specific situation. I was just looking for a simple example where one can easily check things by hand.

Indeed, `gcd` is not enough.

In the case of `Z/nZ` we know the multiplicative structure! That is indeed a great advantage. I would decompose `Z/nZ = Prod_i (Z/(p_i)^k_i Z`. Then determine the order of the generators in each projection and the (multiplicative) subgroup they generate. And finally glue back.

But I am pretty sure that this was not the situation you had in mind with Aladin when you wrote this ticket ;-)
