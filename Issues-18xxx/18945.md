This is ready for review. The file is long but this is due to an extensive test suite that requires a lot of boiler plate code (setup of gambit games etc).

Note that the docs don't build at present, but I believe that this is due to the version of develop that is merged in.

Yes, it's now ready for review. As this is a large ticket, Hannah suggests the following break up of the review process (which could be done by multiple people):

Part 1:

   `ExtensiveFormGame`
1. __init__ (not worrying about having a gambit Game generator)
2. _check_node_names_and_find_players (as a direct result of looking at __init__)

   `EFG_Node`, `EFG_Leaf`, `EFG_Player`:
1. (all of their methods)

Part 2:
   `ExtensiveFormGame`
1. _gambit_to_sage and all its own methods (and hence might want to look at __init and generating the game with a gambit Game)
2. sage_to_gambit and all its own methods

Part 3:
   `ExtensiveFormGame`
1. set_info_set
2. remove_info_set
3. perfect_info
4. plot (and all its related hidden methods, i.e. _grow_tree, _grow_tree_dictionary)
5. plot_info_sets (and all its related hidden methods i.e. _grow_info_set_graph, _grow_info_set_graph_dictionary)
6. obtain_nash
7. is_constant_sum

Just a few observations from looking at the initialization methods:
 
* Would it be possible to automatically name the players, in a similar manner that the nodes are automatically named if no name is given.
* The function "_player_check" needs a test for the case where a player is correctly passed as a parameter
* It might be better if the '_player_check' function was called when the node is created rather than when multiple nodes have been created. This way you can easily tell which node caused the error.
* Test the structure of the graph generated in '_grow_tree_dictionary'
* Indicate in the documentation that the current implementation doesn't support chance (nature) nodes. And possibly catch the error generated when trying to convert a gambit game with a chance node. For example, (https://github.com/gambitproject/gambit/blob/0860191f942fb81f296232b2064456806ed1341c/contrib/games/bayes1a.efg)

```
ExtensiveFormGame(gambit.Game.read_game("bayes1a.efg"))
```
yields

```
KeyError: <Player [CHANCE] in game 'General Bayes game, one stage'>

Super helpful Tobenna. Immediate thoughts below (mainly agreeing). I will get on this as soon as I get a moment.

Good idea!

>  * The function "_player_check" needs a test for the case where a player is correctly passed as a parameter


Yup.

>  * It might be better if the '_player_check' function was called when the node is created rather than when multiple nodes have been created. This way you can easily tell which node caused the error.


Sounds sensible.

>  * Test the structure of the graph generated in '_grow_tree_dictionary'


Yup.

>  * Indicate in the documentation that the current implementation doesn't support chance (nature) nodes. And possibly catch the error generated when trying to convert a gambit game with a chance node. For example, (https://github.com/gambitproject/gambit/blob/0860191f942fb81f296232b2064456806ed1341c/contrib/games/bayes1a.efg)

Ah excellent catch! Yes this is needed.
