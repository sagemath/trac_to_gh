This ticket proposes a new implementation for Generalized Reed-Solomon codes in Sage.
It contains:

- a new code class, `GeneralizedReedSolomonCode`, which wraps Reed-Solomon code in the object-oriented structure introduced in #18099,
- a first new encoder, `GRSEvaluationVectorEncoder`, which can encode words from a message space which is a vector space, and
- a second new encoder, `GRSEvaluationPolynomialEncoder`, which can encode words from a message space which is a polynomial ring.

This new implementation properly sets GRS codes in the object-oriented structure, which allows the user to use specific methods and algorithms to encode (and later decode) words. It also introduces the notion of generalized Reed-Solomon codes, which means that the user can now set a list of column multipliers for the code. 

It also allows to compute parity-check matrix and generator matrix from the parameters of the code, through dedicated methods. It allows super-fast computation of certain - usually exponential - properties, such as weight distribution.

As GRS codes are now objects in Sage, it is also possible to ask a GRS code for its specific parameters (like the list of its evaluation points, or its column multipliers).

The two provided encoders follow the structure introduced in #18376.

This ticket also removes the old `ReedSolomonCode` method from the global namespace as it was deprecated more than a year ago (see #15445). 

More details about GRS codes can be found in the docstring of the provided code.

Depends on #18376

I updated this ticket by resolving merge conflicts with latest beta, removing dependency to #18813 and fixing broken doctests in thematic tutorial related to coding theory.

It's now open for review as it does not depend on unmerged ticket anymore.

<div id="comment:18" align="right">comment:18</div>

Hello,

It seems that your changes actually broke something...

If you look in `src/doc/en/thematic_tutorials.coding_theory.rst` lines 614-619, you'll see that the following input:


```
sage: F.<a> = GF(3^2,"a")
sage: pts = [0,1,a,a^2,2*a,2*a+1]
sage: C = codes.GeneralizedReedSolomonCode(pts, 4)
```

is not accepted anymore.

Furthermore, the following:

```
sage: F.<a> = GF(3^2,"a")
sage: C = codes.GeneralizedReedSolomonCode(F.list()[:6], 4)
```

is accepted but `sage: C` returns `[6, 4, 3] Generalized Reed-Solomon Code over Finite Field of size 3` and the *over Finite Field of size 3* looks weird to me.

David

Yup. Oh, by the way I got tricked by that quite a lot of times (until I add these into my test script), there's two external files using methods from coding, namely:

- `src/doc/en/constructions/linear_codes.rst` and
- `src/doc/en/thematic_tutorials/coding_theory.rst`.

They do contain doctests, so remember to test these as well as the `coding` folder when you make changes.
