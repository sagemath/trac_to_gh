Results of solving with `solve` can be wrong
due to `conjugate` being ignored.

This is due to a Maxima bug.

```
sage: eq_a = conjugate(z) == I + 1
sage: eq_a
conjugate(z) == (I + 1)
sage: sol_a = solve(eq_a, z, solution_dict=True)
sage: sol_a
[{z: I + 1}]
```
This is obviously wrong.

```
sage: [eq_a.subs(s) for s in sol_a]
[(-I + 1) == (I + 1)]
```

Note that SymPy does not return a wrong answer,
but does not solve either:

```
sage: sol_aa = solve(eq, z, solution_dict=True, algorithm='sympy')
sage: sol_aa
ConditionSet(z, Eq(conjugate(z) - 1 - I, 0), Complexes)
```

Maybe `solve` should work around the Maxima conjugate bug.

The "sage-support" discussion gives excerpts of posts
to the "maxima" mailing list.

A workaround discussed there consists in working with
real and imaginary parts and solving for those.
