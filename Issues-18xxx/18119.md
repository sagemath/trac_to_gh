Add the following methods to the `WordMorphism` class:

- `is_injective()` - injectivity test
- `is_unboundedly_repetitive()` - whether the morphism is unboundedly repetitive, i.e. has a periodic point containing an unbounded letter, that is also a periodic word
- `is_pushy()` - whether the morphism is pushy (its language contains an infinite amount of words with no growing letters)
- `is_repetitive()` - whether the morphism (its language) contains arbitrarily large repetitions
- `infinite_repetitions_primitive_roots()` - finds the set of all words which are primitive roots of arbitrarily large repetitions in the language of the morphism
- `simplify_alphabet_size()` - returns a simplification of the morphism
- `simplify_until_injective()` - repeateadly calls simplify_alphabet_size() until the result is injective

Also adds the following method to the `FiniteWord_class`:

- `minimal_conjugate()` - returns the lexicographically smallest conjugate of this word

Hello,

the pushed branch contains an implementation of the algorithm from the following paper [An algorithm for enumerating all infinite repetitions in a D0L-system](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570866715000490), using which it is easy to answer the `is_pushy` and `is_unboundedly_repetitive` queries. It also includes a version of the [Sardinas-Patterson algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sardinas%E2%80%93Patterson_algorithm) to answer `is_injective`.

While implementing the above I also added a method for simplifying non-injective morphisms and a method for finding the minimal conjugate of a finite word.

I looked at the code. Here are few comments:

1 - I would suggest to move the import of `chain`, `count` and `Counter` directly inside the method where they are used (except if they are imported in lots of distinct methods).

```diff
-from itertools import chain
+from collections import Counter
+from itertools import chain, count
```

2 - I think we want to create a class for a morphic word (see ticket #31378 on which we are currently working on with Jana) or for the language of a morphic word. And then many of the methods implemented here would go in that class. Or maybe you really want to consider `\{m^n(w) | n \ge 0\}` which may contain more factors than the morphic word if `w` is the whole alphabet and `m` is not primitive. Does such language corresponds to something, for which we could create a class as well?

Every method saying "should be an endomorphism" and taking `w` as input would go in a class representing this object. If this object is always a morphic word OR morphic language, then, we could create a class for that. If this object is more general, we could still create a class for that.

What is the typical case you have in mind?

```diff
+        Return whether the language `\{m^n(w) | n \ge 0\}` is pushy,
+        where `m` is this morphism and `w` is a word inputted as a parameter.
+
+        Requires this morphism to be an endomorphism.
```

As you say, if `w` is not just a letter, we get something more, but in general we should no get anything really new than what we'd get by taking letter axioms one by one. Or is there, Martin?

I am unsure what would be the right object at this point. In the more general settings, all are properties of a D0L-system. Do we want to have a class for it?

I think there are many general methods that require an endomorphism, and there is no special class for them, is there?

I think there should be the factorial closure of `\{m^n(w) | n \ge 0\}` as is in the original definition [Repetition of subwords in DOL languages](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001999588380028X).
Taking `w` a letter, it is a property of a morphic word, or more precisely, its language.
What do you mean by typical usage? Knowing whether a system/morphism is pushy is an ingredient to decide whether it is circular.

I did a small commit to move the itertools import inside the method.

(I did not touch the import of chain which would create a conflict with #31378)

No, for these methods there isn't. I mostly only added the `w` argument since it seemed to make the docs cleaner to me, that is "`w` is a word inputted as a parameter" instead of "`w` is an arbitrary word containing at least one of each letter from the alphabet of the domain of this morphism" or similar.

The factors are mentioned in the paragraph right below that:

```
        A language created by iterating a morphism is pushy if its words
        contain an infinite number of factors containing no growing letters. It
        turns out that this is equivalent to having at least one infinite
        repetition containing no growing letters.
```

Would you still prefer to mention them also in the first sentence in the docs?

Thanks! Sorry for the long delay before answering, thankfully Štěpán already responded to your second comment. I also added a commit adding a test and slightly refactoring one method.

Thank you, the updated description helps me to have an easier overview of what it added.

I have few suggestions about the name of the methods. See below. It is important to choose them well, because they are harder to change once in sage because of backward compatibility.

Replying to new description:
> Add the following methods to the `WordMorphism` class:
> 
> - `is_injective()` - injectivity test

okay

> - `is_unboundedly_repetitive()` - whether the morphism is unboundedly repetitive, i.e. has a periodic point containing an unbounded letter, that is also a periodic word

okay

> - `is_pushy()` - whether the morphism is pushy (its language contains an infinite amount of words with no growing letters)

okay

> - `is_repetitive()` - whether the morphism (its language) contains arbitrarily large repetitions

okay

> - `infinite_repetitions()` - finds the set of all words which are primitive roots of arbitrarily large repetitions in the language of the morphism

I rather suggest `infinite_repetitions_primitive_roots()`. Explicit is better and implicit. See `import this` in Python:)

> - `infinite_repetitions_bounded()` - same as above, but only those words which contain no growing letters
> - `infinite_repetitions_growing()` - same as above, but only those words which contain at least one growing letter

I would suggest to rename those two methods as hidden methods `_infinite_repetitions_bounded()` and `_infinite_repetitions_growing()`. Then, I would suggest to access those methods from the method `infinite_repetitions()` as follows:

- `infinite_repetitions(growing_letters=None)`, the default
- `infinite_repetitions(growing_letters=True)`, only those words which contain at least one growing letter
- `infinite_repetitions(growing_letters=False)`, only those words which contain no growing letters

Of course, you will need to also add documentation about this new argument `growing_letters`.

> - `simplify()` - returns a simplification of the morphism

I would suggest to rename it to `simplify_alphabet_size()`, because this is really what this methods wants to do: reduce the size of the alphabet while doing essentially the same thing.

> - `simplify_injective()` - repeateadly calls simplify() until the result is injective

I suggest to rename it to `simplify_to_injective()` or even better `simplify_until_injective()` since the word `until` gives an hint about the procedure. Otherwise we don't know whether `injective` is a description of the input or the output. Here, it describes the output.

Thank you for the suggestions. I implemented all of them, except I named the parameter `allow_growing` instead of `growing_letters` and instead of hiding the `infinite_repetitions_*` methods I merged them into `infinite_repetitions_primitive_roots`, to remove some redundant code and docs.
