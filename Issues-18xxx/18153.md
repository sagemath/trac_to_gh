Various parents need to create variable names (the polynomial rings, free algebras, groups, the symbolic ring, etc). We fusion all of them.

1. the following will now raise `TypeError`

```
sage: R.<a,b> = PolynomialRing(QQ, ('a', 'b'))
sage: A.<x,y,z> = FreeAlgebra(QQ, 'x,y,z')
```
  (see [the "polynomial ring" thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/DRT84Yj73Nc))

2. The many versions are `normalize_names` are fused in `sage.misc.variables.normalize_names`

3. Deprecations:
   - the `var_array` argument in `PolynomialRing`
   - the methods `normalize_names`, `_certify_name` of `CategoryObject`

4. Problems with injection of reserved names

```
sage: a = SR.var('or')   # this should work
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: The name "or" is not a valid Python identifier.
sage: QQ['or'].inject_variables()   # this should not
Defining or
```
 note: should take care of '_', 'True', 'False', 'None' and builtins (see [the "reserved name for variables" thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/5BAtCZnQj6o))

As a sided effect, we got some speedup in polynomial ring creation!
