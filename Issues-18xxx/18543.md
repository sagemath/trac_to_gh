Compare the output of these three.

```
sage: plot(x,(x,1,100),linestyle=':', legend_label='foo')

sage: plot(x,(x,1,100),linestyle='--', legend_label='foo')

sage: plot(x,(x,1,100),linestyle='-', legend_label='foo')
```
There is a *very* subtle difference between the last two, I think, but not enough to be useful.  Let's fix this.

I tried that, but only `P.set_legend_options(handlelength=2)` seemed to work.  Maybe I needed to do it in `show` and not just the plot?

Anyway, the ticket is about *defaults* and what we should have to fix this.

There are many things that can't be set through plot I think. This is not really a bug.

Right - or the documentation is wrong.  But in theory everything is supposed to get passed on to show.

In fact, that is #10616 - I *knew* that I had seen that somewhere!

(Also barely related is #13543.)
