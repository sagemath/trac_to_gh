```
The `lift theorem' gives conditions under which a matroid representation over a partial field can be transformed to a representation over another partial field, using a lift function to map the cross ratios. 

Regardless whether these conditions are met, there is a polynomial-time procedure to construct a  candidate representation over the target partial field, given a lift function. If the conditions of the theorem are met, then this candidate representation is the right one.

Write a method for LinearMatroid, which given a lift function, generates such a candidate representation.

Hi Rudi,

I think you really need to fix #15296 before building code that makes it more likely for people to use cross-ratio functionality. In particular if you create the near-regular partial field as a field of fractions of a polynomial ring, things go quite horribly wrong.

Hi Stefan,

They can now use some finite field to compute with for most of the time, and lift the representation afterwards. The lifting merely gives you different perspectives on the same algebraic object (the way I set up this method it can also be used to e.g. directly get different representations over GF(5) out of one finite-field matrix which encodes a hydra-k representation.)

One major thing: `lift_map` needs doctests.

A couple of minor things (all but the first two you can ignore):

- Please remove all trailing whitespace.
- Citations should be make by `[refname]_`.
- I know it's not part of this ticket, but instead of `http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.0910`, you can (should) use <code>arxiv:\`1203.0910\`</code>. You can also make <code>\`(-i, i)\`</code> for math formatting.
- You should try to make all lines under 80 characters; in particular, the moved citation.
- In the `INPUT:` of `lift_map` should be `--` instead of the comma `,`.
- I'd remove the period `.` in the `OUTPUT:` section of `lift_map` since it is not a sentence.
- Don't be afraid of using (inline) math formatting/latex (mainly I'm thinking of `lift_cross_matrix`).

Stefan, are you going to be doing the rest of the review?

Two things I missed on my quick lookthrough; both are in `lift_map`. Your missing a blankline after `EXAMPLES::` and bullet point lists need to be aligned as:

```
- this is a long item
  which is aligned like this
- here is the second item
```
One thing I messed up on is <code>:arxiv:\`1203.0910\`</code> (I missed the leading colon). Also don't include the triple { } braces (they are just here so that it displays properly).

It takes more time to have an import inside of a method because python has to resolve that import (or seeing it already has been imported) each time the method is called. However one sometimes needs to do this to take care of circular imports: file A imports something from file B, but file B also needs to import something from file A (or potentially larger cycles).

I was just touching up the docstring a bit to ue more latex, so this is solved now.

Well, here's a few things I might do:
- add a few maps to lift_map;
- make lift_cross_ratios design it's own lift map / target ring based on the cross ratios of the given matrix;
- speed up lift_cross_ratios, _local_binary_matroid, _local_ternary_matroid;
- kill #15296
But they are not on the top of my list, so can't say when. The first one is quite easy, so I might work on that between harder tasks. 

I doubt if that will make any of your code outdated. Making real gm-matrices from your gf19-matrices (and latex-ing them) just became easier, so that can never hurt.

What kind of functionality were you thinking of?

I had some pretty gnarly grep routines to do that for me, so losing them is a plus.

A way to test if a given GF(4)/5 matrix is GM or not. But that's a pipe dream, and working in GF(19) wasn't too bad when I stopped doing complete enumeration of matrices.

I'm about to start working on it, and if anything seems like it could be useful in general I'll make some tickets.

After is_ternary, I intend to work on is_quarternary. That function will tell you if a GF(5)-matrix is GM. For GF(5) / other fields I have no plans right now. They are much harder, GF(4) is the last nice one.
