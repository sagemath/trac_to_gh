<a id='comment:8'></a>Thanks.

I added two reviewer commits for PEP8 compliance.

Please add your full name in the author field of this ticket.

I do not know whether we have a strict policy on that, but most commits in Sage nowadays have the *full name* of the author as the git author, see the [developer's guide](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/git_setup.html#your-name-and-email). This would be impractical for these commits, but please do it for future contributions.

Apart from that, this is a positive review from my side.
