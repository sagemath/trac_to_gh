Right now the `notebook()` function is a lazy import from sagenb. Hence any access (like looking at the docstring) imports sagenb which changes the display backend which causes various problems (see https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/3uaY6xHLMqQ/Zyn67xJ0LaMJ). It also doesn't fit into a world where there is more than one notebook. And its current behavior of turning the current Sage session into a notebook server can't work with the IPython notebook or SMC.

First, we should definitely move `notebook` into the Sage library to move it away from sagenb.

The more general question is what to do with it then. Options are
* Just let it launch SageNB, any other notebook needs to be launched via `sage --notebook=...` on the commandline
* Deprecate `notebook()` altogether
* Let `notebook()` always spawn an independent process, and add an argument to select which one

I wouldn't move generalizing `notebook()` like supporting `notebook(backend="ipython")`.

However, like I already said on `sage-devel`, the fact that *importing* `sagenb` breaks stuff is a bug in itself.

I guess I could support either way - it does seem a bit bit silly not to extend this command, since in principle it could be agnostic.  `notebook(backend='smc')`, anyone?
> However, like I already said on `sage-devel`, the fact that *importing* `sagenb` breaks stuff is a bug in itself.

Yes.
