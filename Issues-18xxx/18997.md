this is merely to avoid  merging troubles, as they are both changing `strongly_regular_db`.
(I'm still writing the latter part of this ticket, and speeding the construction up).
And I will add a contruction of symplectic polar graphs here, as it's almost identical...

we are already building `GQ(q,q)` and `GQ(q,q^2)`; this ticket will give `GQ(q^2,q)` and `GQ(q<sup>2,q</sup>3)`. So we will need `GQ(q<sup>3,q</sup>2)` - I can do this on this ticket too, as
this is essentially a small modification:
- I build points and lines of the `GQ(q<sup>2,q</sup>3)`, and use them to create the graph; 
- I can also use them to create the intersection graph of the lines, which will give the graph of `GQ(q<sup>3,q</sup>2)`.

What remains is `GQ(q-1,q+1)` and its dual, `GQ(q+1,q-1)`.

yes, sure, it's `OrthogonalPolarGraph(5,q)` and `OrthogonalPolarGraph(6,q,'-')`.

>Shouldn't they be incidence structures in their most natural form instead? I thought that it would make more sense to have a `hypergraphs.generalized_quadrangle` that would then be called by graph constructors.


well, they are a part of a more general construction, polar spaces. We can have `hypergraphs.polar_space` of which `hypergraphs.generalized_quadrangle` is a subclass...

<a id='comment:19'></a>Helloooooooo Dima,

Here is a 'first-pass' review:

- This doctest is way too long:
  {{{
  sage: %time graphs.SymplecticGraph(6,4,algorithm="gap").is_strongly_regular(parameters=True)
  CPU times: user 22 s, sys: 132 ms, total: 22.2 s
  Wall time: 21.1 s
  (1365, 340, 83, 85)
  }}}
  You will see several places in this file doctests disabled because they take
  ~5seconds. This, because the doctests are run very often by a lot of people,
  and we can't have them compute for 20 seconds whenever we add a function (and
  we do add many). Could you replace this `6,4` by `4,4` or something?

- Why is this only checked when `algorithm="gap"`?
  {{{
  if d < 1 or d%2 != 0:
      raise ValueError("d must be even and greater than 2")
  }}}

- `_polar_graph` -- misses an 'INPUT' section

- Could you merge this branch with the latest version of its dependency?

- in `_polar_Graph` -- why upper case `G`?

- same function: would it make sense to compute the list of edges of the graph
  in GAP instead of doing it in Sage, which triggers GAP calls? Just wondering,
  as it seems that interacting with GAP is often costly.

Nathann

this is `libGAP`, we can be reasonably sure that at least with non-complicated objects, 
like integers, this is as quick as native Python... (certainly, replacing `libgap` with `gap` there would lead to a huge performance hit).

<a id='comment:24'></a>Helloooooooo Dima,

- About the methods with a "algorithm" keyword: some of them do not have an
  `INPUT` block where the parameter is described. Also, it would be better if
  instead of checking `!= 'gap'` you tested `algorithm =='Gap'` then `algorithm
  is None` and finally raised an exception if the argument does not beelong to
  the allowed list. This being said, I would have nothing against it if you
  chose to remove the pure Sage code. It's up to you.

- Backticks are missing around `Sp(x,y)` and others.

- We have `SimplecticGraph` and `SimplecticDualPolarGraph` -- should we
  uniformize the `Polar` somehow?

- singilar

- Can you please remove/change all tests that take more than 2 seconds? Don't
  build instances larger than is necessary to *test* your code. With your
  branch:
  {{{
  sage -t --long families.py
       [280 tests, 44.02 s]
  }}}
  With the latest beta
  {{{
  sage -t --long families.py
       [250 tests, 19.95 s]
  }}}

- Some graphs are not defined on a html page, and for those you link toward
  "Distance-regular graphs". As this is much harder to find than a web page,
  could you provide some quick definition of the class, just to give the user
  "an idea"?

- You may want (it's up to you) to add "SEEALSO" blocks between your methods.

- As we now have many of these polar graphs, you may want (it's up to you) to
  split them from the "Graph families" block of the index
  (http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/graphs/sage/graphs/graph_generators.html)
  and give them a block of their own.

Thank you *very* much for this code.

Nathann

it's always better to have 2 implementations... I'll rearrange as you ask.

yep, how about renaming `SimplecticGraph` to `SimplecticPolarGraph` and make `SimplecticGraph` a deprecated alias to `SimplecticPolarGraph`?


> - Can you please remove/change all tests that take more than 2 seconds? 
 
How about I'll move them into examples and mark them # not tested (long time)?
They test "generic" situations, whereas all the small examples there are kinds of corner cases.

all these `SymplecticPolar`, `OrthogonalPolar`, etc are very similar, as
well as all `SymplecticDualPolar` etc.
There is a freely available preprint that describes them in detail:
https://repository.cwi.nl/noauth/search/fullrecord.php?publnr=6775

I'd rather include this as a reference.

Perhaps it's more meaningful to create a separate module, say polar_families.py,
where we move all them, as well as `AffinePolar` guys. Then a doc can be written
in the top of this new module.

We could also extend the wikipedia page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance-regular_graph and have docs there...

this would be even more meaningful with a new module.

Reorganization can indeed wait, but must not forget to address the "SymplecticDualPolarGraph" vs "SymplecticGraph" issue.
