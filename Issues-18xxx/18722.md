With #18453, all weights are computed as the difference of the highest weight to what should be the weight. In particular, any highest weight element has weight 0.

```
sage: La = RootSystem(['A',2]).weight_lattice().fundamental_weights()
sage: M = crystals.NakajimaMonomials(['A',2], La[1])
sage: M.module_generators[0].weight()
(0, 0, 0)
```
I also make Nakajima monomials as classical crystals for the finite types.

The following example failed with the original commit:

```
sage: M = crystals.NakajimaMonomials(['A',2,1], RootSystem(['A',2,1]).weight_lattice(extended=True).fundamental_weight(0))
sage: m = M.module_generators[0]
sage: m.weight()
Lambda[0]
```
A conditional was added to `__classcall_private__` of `CrystalsOfNakajimaMonomials` to ensure the weight lattice being used is the extended weight lattice with the underlying Cartan type is affine.

Some doctests needed to be updated so that the input used the extended weight lattice in affine examples.

Doctests passed on my machine, so if you agree with these changes, then you may set the ticket to positive review on my behalf.
