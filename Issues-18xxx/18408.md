It seems that we do not have an up-to-date list of Sage's packages in our documentation.

This branch solves the problem, by adding the list of packages in our reference manual (in `sage.misc.package`, where all functions dealing with packages are defined). This list is *generated* from python lists, so that they are:
- Easy to read (in a nice sorted table)
- Checked by a doctest, so that we get a warning if they are not up to date anymore

As you can see from the source code, the list of packages is generated from the output of `sage -standard`, `sage -optional` and `sage -experimental`. And yes, all three contain gcc. And `extcode`. The point of this branch is that we see the list somewhere, and apparently it also helps us notice other bugs. Please do not force me to rewrite everything here.\n\nNathann",

Jeroen, please do not ask me to rewrite everything at once. I am no magician. As you can see from the source code, the list of packages is generated from the output of `sage -standard`, `sage -optional` and `sage -experimental`. And yes, all three contain gcc. And `extcode`. The point of this branch is that we see the list somewhere, and apparently it also helps us notice other bugs. Please do not force me to rewrite everything here.

I really do not see the point of adding wrong and outdated lists to the documentation.

Why should it *depend* on it? The list currenty generated by `sage -standard` is wrong at the moment (not caused by this patch) and what this patch does will still work when that will be fixed.

In the meantime we will have a "more correct" list of packages, I will be able to remove the list of Sage packages from the 'installation' document (and instead link to that list). There is no gain in blocking this ticket until the other problem is fixed.

Yes, there is gain: Sage will have less wrong documentation.

So, here it is.

---

As of Sage 6.7.beta4, we have:

`__Obsolete__` packages (since Sage 6.0), `*.spkg`:

* extcode
* sage (also used to be versioned)
* sage_root
* sage_scripts

`__Renamed__` packages:

* libm4ri -> m4ri
* libm4rie -> m4rie
* database_stein_watkins_mini.p0 -> database_stein_watkins_mini (optional)
* TOPCOM -> topcom (optional; "new-style" is lowercase)

* gd -> libgd ? (probably *replaced*, see below)

`__Removed__` (standard) packages:

* genus2reduction (now part of the Sage library IIRC)
* mercurial (in principle replaced by git, but no "drop-in" replacement)
* sqlalchemy

`__Replaced__` (standard) packages:

* pil -> Pillow
* gd, gdmodule -> libgd (I think)

__Newly added__ (standard) packages:

* backports_ssl_match_hostname (WTF?)
* certifi
* combinatorial_designs
* configure (see below)
* csage (see below)
* dateutil
* git (used to be optional, so there's still an old one, too)
* jsonschema
* libgd (presumably the replacement of gd, gdmodule; see above)
* markupsafe
* mathjax
* mistune
* pari_galdata
* pari_seadata_small
* pip
* pkgconf
* pkgconfig
* prereq (see below)
* pyparsing
* pyzmq
* six
* tornado
* zeromq


Then we have some weirdness with the following "packages":

* in `build/pkgs/`, but not (listed as) installed:
  * configure

* (listed as) installed, but not in `build/pkgs/`, and without version:
   * csage
   * sage ("conflicts" with the previous, versioned spkg in Sage 5.x)
   * prereq

And then we have new "new-style" packages (just in the git repo) which have
no legacy (`*.spkg`) counterpart, hence currently not listed by `sage-list-packages`:

* arb (optional)
* ...

... besides that so far only some optional packages have been converted to
"new-style"; the versions in the git repo might meanwhile be newer than their
legacy counterparts.  (Similar for packages that used to be optional but
are standard now, cf. "newly added packages" above.)

I just generated the list from our build/install file:

http://www.steinertriples.fr/ncohen/tmp/std

I was about to write to sage-devel to ask <whoever can> to put it online, but in the meantime I noticed that the official list has been removed:
http://www.sagemath.org/packages/standard/list

So something is apparently happening.

The site is currently moving, while `packages/` is obsolete anyway, since it is incompatible with the mirrors.  Take `spkg/standard/list` from some mirror instead.

That doesn't make much sense, since

* the `list` files are generated from the directory contents,
* the site is moving, as I said. 

We'll have to wait with such at least until the infrastructure is stable again (hopefully in a few days).
