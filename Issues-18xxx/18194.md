```
A formula of F. Bergeron and M. Haiman gives a Pieri rule for `h_r^\perp {\tilde H}_\mu` and this formula can be used to compute the `H` and `Ht` bases much quicker than previous implementations.  The current implementation computes the `H` and `Ht` basis through the `J` basis and this basis is implemented through creation operators.

For instance a command that takes a relatively long time to compute is

```
sage: %time H([3,2]).nabla(q=H.q,t=1/H.t)
CPU times: user 2.75 s, sys: 86.6 ms, total: 2.83 s
Wall time: 2.95 s
q^4/t^2*McdH[3, 2]
```
and with the new implementation the same command has the timing

```
CPU times: user 184 ms, sys: 18.7 ms, total: 203 ms
Wall time: 196 ms
```

One reason that some of the computations in the `H` and `Ht` bases take a long time is that the entire basis a given degree is cached and so subsequent computations will be faster.  However it seems that the new implementation is cached more efficiently and is faster.

This ticket also catches an problem in `sage.combinat.nscf_qsym.qsym` where `to_symmetric_function` constructs an element with support in compositions.

I did some cleanup of the docstrings and imports. However there are some doctest failures:

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage -t ../../tests/book_schilling_zabrocki_kschur_primer.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t ../../structure/parent.pyx  # 1 doctest failed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```
The second one is slightly worrysome in that the coercion path has gotten longer, but it is not so bad. The first one is much more serious as I (and the patchbot) get a division by zero error on this test:

```
sage: Sym = SymmetricFunctions(FractionField(QQ['q']))
sage: Mac = Sym.macdonald(t=0)
sage: H = Mac.H()
sage: s = Sym.schur()
sage: for la in Partitions(3):
....:    print "H",la, "=", s(H(la))
```
I suspect your computational assumptions are not always being met and lead to this error.

So the issue is doing the 2 substitutions, which are quite expensive, instead of 1. (Although it's quite worrisome the sheer number of calls to certain things, like `is_finite`, but they are minor in terms of speed).

Are you running Sage from `$SAGE_ROOT/src/sage`? This has been known to cause problems.

Perhaps what we should do is special case the `t=0` cases when we end up doing a `t -> 1/t` substitution?

Thanks, the `$SAGE_ROOT/src/sage` was exactly the problem.

At t=0, `H(mu).subs(t=0) == Qp(mu.conjugate()).subs(t=q).omega()`

That doesn't quite cut it for the `Ht` basis, but then maybe we never have to invert `t`.  I'll see if I can cover all cases this way.

sage: %time H(s[4,3,2,1])
CPU times: user 667 ms, sys: 66.2 ms, total: 734 ms
Wall time: 719 ms
```

This is a huge improvement for this corner case.  For arbitrary `t` case on branch 54336b9

```
sage: H = SymmetricFunctions(QQ['q','t'].fraction_field()).macdonald().H()
sage: s = H.symmetric_function_ring().s()
sage: %time H(s[4,3,2,1])
CPU times: user 1min 8s, sys: 213 ms, total: 1min 8s
Wall time: 1min 8s
```

While on the current branch

```
sage: %time H(s[4,3,2,1])
CPU times: user 59.5 s, sys: 172 ms, total: 59.7 s
Wall time: 59.6 s
```

This is a small but healthy improvement.  Timings for the `Ht` basis and applications of `nabla` seem to be similar on both of these branches.  These computations would not run in a reasonable amount of time without this ticket.

So in small scale, just calling the element directly is faster, but at this scale, doing `subs` is actually faster because of some preprocessing it seems to do. *shrugs* I also did some other things which should be faster.

The testing I did previously was on `H(s[3,2,2,1])`, and looking at the profile, the coercions between bases are faster, but some other parts of the computation seems to be slower (for reasons currently unknown to me).

Really? O_o I really don't believe that is faster because `homogeneous component` is:

```python
degree_on_basis = self.parent().degree_on_basis
return self.parent().sum_of_terms((i, c)
                                  for (i, c) in self
                                  if degree_on_basis(i) == n)
```
Plus there is a `sorted` being called in `support`, not to mention the intermediate element created. I don't see how we'd be doing fewer terms in the sum.

Ahhh...here's a thought, it's the call to `sorted` that results in the speedup because the smaller elements result in fewer terms that have to be resolved until the end. I'm going to experiment, but if that's true, then that's one subtle issue.

Although that call to `QQqt` is superfluous as `_Lmunu` returns an element of `QQqt`.

Yours:

I'd ask if you put on some mood music, but that would've disrupted the timings. :P I also addressed [Darij's questions](#comment%3A52).

Darij, I found that running `prod` is faster than `QQqt.prod` on this scale because the C/cython implementation of the `prod` function plus the one coercion beats the python implementation of the `prod` method without a coercion.

So I think we're at positive review?
