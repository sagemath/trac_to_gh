A formula of F. Bergeron and M. Haiman gives a Pieri rule for `h_r^\perp {\tilde H}_\mu` and this formula can be used to compute the `H` and `Ht` bases much quicker than previous implementations.  The current implementation computes the `H` and `Ht` basis through the `J` basis and this basis is implemented through creation operators.

For instance a command that takes a relatively long time to compute is

```
sage: %time H([3,2]).nabla(q=H.q,t=1/H.t)
CPU times: user 2.75 s, sys: 86.6 ms, total: 2.83 s
Wall time: 2.95 s
q^4/t^2*McdH[3, 2]
```
and with the new implementation the same command has the timing

```
CPU times: user 184 ms, sys: 18.7 ms, total: 203 ms
Wall time: 196 ms
```

One reason that some of the computations in the `H` and `Ht` bases take a long time is that the entire basis a given degree is cached and so subsequent computations will be faster.  However it seems that the new implementation is cached more efficiently and is faster.

This ticket also catches an problem in `sage.combinat.nscf_qsym.qsym` where `to_symmetric_function` constructs an element with support in compositions.

I did some cleanup of the docstrings and imports. However there are some doctest failures:

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage -t ../../tests/book_schilling_zabrocki_kschur_primer.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t ../../structure/parent.pyx  # 1 doctest failed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```
The second one is slightly worrysome in that the coercion path has gotten longer, but it is not so bad. The first one is much more serious as I (and the patchbot) get a division by zero error on this test:

```
sage: Sym = SymmetricFunctions(FractionField(QQ['q']))
sage: Mac = Sym.macdonald(t=0)
sage: H = Mac.H()
sage: s = Sym.schur()
sage: for la in Partitions(3):
....:    print "H",la, "=", s(H(la))
```
I suspect your computational assumptions are not always being met and lead to this error.

The fact that there is a change in the coercion path from `J` to `H` is to be expected because the new implementation takes `H` and `Ht` to and from the monomial basis while `J`, `P` and `Q` must pass through the Schur basis.  However, I do not know why the path it finds from Schur to monomial passes through homogeneous and the power basis.

```
sage: copy(H._internal_coerce_map_from(J))
Composite map:
  From: Symmetric Functions over Fraction Field of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in q, t over Rational Field in the Macdonald J basis
  To:   Symmetric Functions over Fraction Field of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in q, t over Rational Field in the Macdonald H basis
  Defn:   Generic morphism:
          From: Symmetric Functions over Fraction Field of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in q, t over Rational Field in the Macdonald J basis
          To:   Symmetric Functions over Fraction Field of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in q, t over Rational Field in the Schur basis
        then
          Generic morphism:
          From: Symmetric Functions over Fraction Field of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in q, t over Rational Field in the Schur basis
          To:   Symmetric Functions over Fraction Field of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in q, t over Rational Field in the homogeneous basis
        then
          Generic morphism:
          From: Symmetric Functions over Fraction Field of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in q, t over Rational Field in the homogeneous basis
          To:   Symmetric Functions over Fraction Field of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in q, t over Rational Field in the powersum basis
        then
          Generic morphism:
          From: Symmetric Functions over Fraction Field of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in q, t over Rational Field in the powersum basis

        then

What is the technique for ensuring that Sage finds the shortest coercion path?

I added the `_self_to_s` and `_s_to_self` methods.  This restores old coercion paths because I registered these coercions before the ones to and from the `m` basis (if I did it in a different order the coercion paths were different).

I have no good explanation yet, but the commits that I made in comment 14 added a full second (roughly 3.7 -> 4.7) on the computation of the `qt_kostka` computation that I listed the timing above.

```
sage: qt_kostka = sage.combinat.sf.macdonald.qt_kostka
sage: %time qt_kostka([3,3,2],[4,2,2])
CPU times: user 4.68 s, sys: 85.8 ms, total: 4.77 s
Wall time: 4.72 s
```
I am also having issues with the docstring viewer.  Is this a problem with 6.7.beta1?

So the issue is doing the 2 substitutions, which are quite expensive, instead of 1. (Although it's quite worrisome the sheer number of calls to certain things, like `is_finite`, but they are minor in terms of speed).

Are you running Sage from `$SAGE_ROOT/src/sage`? This has been known to cause problems.

Perhaps what we should do is special case the `t=0` cases when we end up doing a `t -> 1/t` substitution?

Thanks, the `$SAGE_ROOT/src/sage` was exactly the problem.

At t=0, `H(mu).subs(t=0) == Qp(mu.conjugate()).subs(t=q).omega()`

That doesn't quite cut it for the `Ht` basis, but then maybe we never have to invert `t`.  I'll see if I can cover all cases this way.

Some timing tests.  On branch ​54336b9

```
sage: H = SymmetricFunctions(QQ['q','t'].fraction_field()).macdonald(t=0).H()
sage: s = H.symmetric_function_ring().s()
sage: %time H(s[4,3,2,1])
CPU times: user 14.6 s, sys: 113 ms, total: 14.7 s
Wall time: 14.7 s
```

on current branch

```
sage: %time H(s[4,3,2,1])
CPU times: user 667 ms, sys: 66.2 ms, total: 734 ms
Wall time: 719 ms
```

This is a huge improvement for this corner case.  For arbitrary `t` case on branch 54336b9

```
sage: H = SymmetricFunctions(QQ['q','t'].fraction_field()).macdonald().H()
sage: s = H.symmetric_function_ring().s()
sage: %time H(s[4,3,2,1])
CPU times: user 1min 8s, sys: 213 ms, total: 1min 8s
Wall time: 1min 8s
```

While on the current branch

```
sage: %time H(s[4,3,2,1])
CPU times: user 59.5 s, sys: 172 ms, total: 59.7 s
Wall time: 59.6 s
```

This is a small but healthy improvement.  Timings for the `Ht` basis and applications of `nabla` seem to be similar on both of these branches.  These computations would not run in a reasonable amount of time without this ticket.

Really? O_o I really don't believe that is faster because `homogeneous component` is:

```python
degree_on_basis = self.parent().degree_on_basis
return self.parent().sum_of_terms((i, c)
                                  for (i, c) in self
                                  if degree_on_basis(i) == n)
```
Plus there is a `sorted` being called in `support`, not to mention the intermediate element created. I don't see how we'd be doing fewer terms in the sum.

Ahhh...here's a thought, it's the call to `sorted` that results in the speedup because the smaller elements result in fewer terms that have to be resolved until the end. I'm going to experiment, but if that's true, then that's one subtle issue.

Although that call to `QQqt` is superfluous as `_Lmunu` returns an element of `QQqt`.

I'd ask if you put on some mood music, but that would've disrupted the timings. :P I also addressed [Darij's questions](#comment%3A52).

Darij, I found that running `prod` is faster than `QQqt.prod` on this scale because the C/cython implementation of the `prod` function plus the one coercion beats the python implementation of the `prod` method without a coercion.

So I think we're at positive review?

 One reason that some of the computations in the `H` and `Ht` bases take a long time is that the entire basis a given degree is cached and so subsequent computations will be faster.  However it seems that the new implementation is cached more efficiently and is faster.
