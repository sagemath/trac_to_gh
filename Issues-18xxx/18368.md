So the Riemann zeta function has an unsigned infinity.

```
sage: sig = .01
sage: end = 30
sage: complex_plot(zeta,(0,1),(0.01,end),aspect_ratio=1/end)+line([(sig,0),(sig,end)],linestyle='--')
Launched png viewer for Graphics object consisting of 2 graphics primitives
sage: complex_plot(zeta,(0,1),(0,end),aspect_ratio=1/end)+line([(sig,0),(sig,end)],linestyle='--')
ValueError: unsigned infinity cannot be represented in a float
```
This should not prevent it from plotting in `complex_plot`, especially since it plots fine in one variable at that point (asymptote shows up etc.).
