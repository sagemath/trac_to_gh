It has been reported by Neal Master that when solving a LP with a time limit or an optimality gap, an exception was raised whenever the solution was ... not optimal.

Which is precisely why people solve problems with such limits: to get a solution when getting an optimal one is too hard.

With this patch, no exception is raised in such situations. And two new doctests are added.

No idea. Unfortunately, I was not able to write a solver-independent doctest.

I have used many times time limits and optimality gaps with cplex without difficulties.

```
sage: from sage.numerical.mip import MixedIntegerLinearProgram
sage: g = graphs.CubeGraph(9)
sage: p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram(solver="Cplex")
sage: p.solver_parameter("CPX_PARAM_EPAGAP", 100)
sage: b = p.new_variable(binary=True)
sage: p.set_objective(p.sum(b[v] for v in g))
sage: for v in g:
....:     p.add_constraint(b[v]+p.sum(b[u] for u in g.neighbors(v)) <= 1)
....:     
sage: p.add_constraint(b[v] == 1) # Force an easy non-0 solution
sage: p.solve()
28.0
```
With Coin, we don't have access to optimality gap or timelimit.

```
sage: p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram(solver="Coin")
sage: p.solver_parameter("mip_gap_tolerance",100)

This patch is working well and passes all tests, but you could change the ticket description to say that it solves the issue for GLPK only.
