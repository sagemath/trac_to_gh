`is_atomic` --> "Return True if the lattice is atomic."

Maybe this should be

`is_atomic` --> "Return True if all elements of the lattice are joins of elements covering the bottom element."

but then, not all functions are easy to define by one sentence. At least after this we have some kind of index.
