With this branch, `polytopes.Gosset_3_21().graph()` takes 300ms, against 16s before.

The 'definition' used to compute adjacent vertices can be found in [comment:10]

And of course the following works:

```
sage: g=graphs.GossetGraph()
sage: g.is_isomorphic(polytopes.Gosset_3_21().graph())
True
```

Depends on #18779

well, you have 26 facets on each edge - none are more useless than the others. You can do the
following (note that 0th and 1st vertices are adjacent).

```
sage: p=polytopes.Gosset_3_21()
sage: M=p.incidence_matrix()
sage: a=0; b=1;
sage: vv=[i for i in [0..702] if M[a,i]*M[b,i]>0]
sage: matrix([p.inequalities()[j].vector() for j in vv]).T.kernel()
Free module of degree 9 and rank 1 over Integer Ring
Echelon basis matrix:
[0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
```
or just 

```
sage: m=matrix([p.inequalities()[j].vector() for j in vv])
sage: m.rank()
8
```
which makes sense, as `m` is of size 27x9.  (27, as there is not full-dimensional).

General code for adjacency of two vertices `a` and `b` of a polytope in `d`-dimensional space
should check that `m` has corank `1`.

(There could be special cases when one of the vertices is the origin, or some inequalities are homogeneous).

My understanding is that hacking `hasse_diagram.py` to stop earlier is what one actually needs to do.

the whole Polyhedron code does a potentially very slow thing: enumerating the inequalities at construction time, instead of doing it optionally or/and lazily.

Indeed, e.g. the problem at hand, deciding if two vertices are adjacent, does not need pre-computed inequalities. Namely, checking that v_1 and v_2 are adjacent can be done by solving the following LP:

```
    variables: x_0..x_d,x_{d+1}
    objective: max x_0
    constraints: 
         -1 <= x_i <=1 for i in [1..d]; 
          x_{d+1} >= 0;
          sum_{j=1}^d v_{i,j}*x_j = x_{d+1},         for i=1,2;
          sum_{j=1}^d v_{i,j}*x_j >= x_{d+1} + x_0,  for i>2;
```
if the optimum exists and is strictly positive, they form an edge, and otherwise they don't.

So we are trying to find an inequality that is valid for the convex hull of v_k's and turns
into an equation on v_1 and v_2, but is a strict inequality on the rest of v_k's.

(The LP above will not work if there are more v_j's on the line joining v_1 and v_2 --- but this case can be taken care of trivially.)

Oh. That's a nice formulation of the problem, thanks. I will not forget it.

Would you know a combinatorial way to compute it? It seems that we can already rely on cddlib (see #18861) in order to build the graph over RDF.

Here is a new 'combinatorial' version. It uses an 'idea', which I am not sure is a proper definition of the object, but well... You tell me `:-P`

1) For every inequality `I`, build the set `set(I)` of points for which it is an equality
2) For any pair of points `i,j`, list all inequalities `I_1, ..., I_k` that contain them both
3) Intersection `set(I_1), ..., set(I_k)`. If this intersection has cardinality 2, then ij is an edge.

Works for Gosset (at least) `:-P`

So was this line incorrect `return Graph(self.vertex_adjacency_matrix(), loops=False)` ?

I expect the `.vertex_graph()` to give me a graph whose vertices are the vertices of the polyhedron. And the incidence matrix of that graph is *not* the output of the `_vertex_adjacency_matrix` whose rows are not the vertices only. Do we agree?

yes, that's correct for the polytopes - provided there is no redundancy.
E.g. if a polytope is not full-dimensional, then adding an equation satisfied by all the vertices to an inequality is a "copy" of this inequality, vertex-vise.

Excellent news! Then we have a very nice speedup ahead `:-PPPP`

As for redundancy, it is true that this algorithm will not behave very well if there are several vertices at the same place which are actually the same. Redundancy of inequalities, however, is not a problem.

Yeah but in terms of sets it produces the very same one. So it's cool.

presently we have 

```
adjacency_matrix = vertex_adjacency_matrix
```
in `geometry/polhedron/base.py`. I'd think we should rename `._vertex_adjacency_matrix` to something like `._Vrep_adjacency_matrix`, and, dually `._facet_adjacency_matrix` to `._Hrep_adjacency_matrix`. 

And then set `adjacency_matrix = _Vrep_adjacency_matrix`, and provide a meaningful implementation of  `vertex_adjacency_matrix`, as you propose here.

well, check out `sage.geometry.polyhedron.constructor?`. In short, any polyhedron is the Minkowski sum of a polytope P (spanned by vertices), a pointed polyhedral cone (spanned by rays), and a subspace S (spanned by lines). 

* If S is empty or of dimension bigger than 1, it can be ignored. 
* Otherwise S is a line,  and it is adjacent to all the vertices, and to no ray; and, counter-intuitively, no   vertices are adjacent to each other.
* Rays are not adjacent to each other, and might be adjacent to some vertices.

How these general adjacencies are used, I don't know.

I do not think that there was any. We had discussions on the name of other functions, but this new implementation only touches the "vertex graph" and clearly improves the running time.
