Yoooooooo Jeroen!

Shouldn't we expose this as a 'sage option' instead? This patch of yours replaces 'sage -i' everywhere, but you can type 'sage -i <something>' anywhere while you have to be in Sage's root folder to type 'make <something>'.

I expect that those who would have known how to read to the following message

```
raise TypeError("The optional arb package is not installed. "
                "Consider installing it via 'sage -i arb'")
```

may not all know how to react to 

```
raise TypeError("The optional arb package is not installed. "
                "Consider installing it via 'make arb'")
```

for they would not immediately know where it should be typed.

It's not superseded. I still want to support `./sage -i` like before because
1. `./sage -i` works with old-style packages
2. `./sage -i` has options like `-f`, `-s`, `-d`
3. Sometimes, it might be useful to "just" install a particular package, without all the `build/install` stuff.

Needs work because thi is making things more difficult for users. Besides, merely replacing 'sage -i' with 'make' will not do, as this obviously does not work from any directory.

Seriously?

Okay...

Well: people here are trying to make it easy for evrybody to install this software. They create live USB key, binaries for all platforms, debian/gentoo/Mac versions of the software so that it can be installed in a couple of clicks. I'd be surprised if most of those users even know where SAGE_ROOT is given that they did not install it manually. Right now we have a "simple" way to install a package, i.e with "sage -i" (and I am sure that some of them do not even know how to open a console), and an easier one (that we should fix) through `install_package(pkgname)` in a Sage session.

Pray excuse me, but what exactly is the necessity of changing the user interface? We have total control on what 'sage -i' does, as it is one of our scripts. If you want it to have a different behaviour, if you want to add optional flags, if you want to change the default action, you *can* do it. So why this change, when all the messages you update now do not even contain enough information for the users to guess what they should do?

If the reason you want to keep simultaneously a 'sage -i' different from 'make' if to not check dependencies, I think that we can make it all work this way:

- 'sage -i' -- we make it run the 'make' command
- 'sage -i -f' -- we make it for the install of a package without checking its dependencies

You can add a '--no-dependencies' flag if you feel like it, but I really don't see why we should change the user interface for that. It's easier to adapt *our* usage then the user's.

My proposal is essentially to forget about `./sage -i` and use `make` instead. Ordinary users should not run `./sage -i package`, they should run `make package`. If they really know what they are doing, they can use `./sage -i package`.

It's not impossible, it's just a needless complication.

Analogy: you don't want `gcc` to keep track of dependencies, that's why you use `make`: usually, `make` runs `gcc` and not the other way around. Similarly, `make` should run `./sage -i` and not the other way around.

My problem is not whether you should have a way to track dependencies and a way to not track them. My problem is that we have been using and advertising 'sage -i' for years. It appears in our doc, on some people's web page, and we can expect users to know how to run it (those who know how to open a console).

We don't have one year deprecations policies to change the behaviour of [some lost Sage function in a lost submodule] so that you can change 'sage -i' to 'make' without warning, especially when (see [comment:12]) we cannot expect all users to know what 'make' is, nor to know where 'SAGE_ROOT' is.

As it seems that there is no technical problem in changing the user interface, I set this ticket back to `needs_work`.

It is. If you just say "type 'make pkgname'" in a doc/exception message, I am 100% sure that people will open terminals, type what they are requested to type, and not know what to do with the message "There is no Makefile in this folder" just because they are not in SAGE_ROOT.

Because installing packages with dependencies is better than installing packages without dependencies. The old command still works, we are just documenting the high-level interface instead of the low-level command.

For this reason, a way out would be to have:
1) sage -i --nodep # install without taking dependencies into account. That would be what 'make' calls when building Sage on each individual package
2) sage -i # that would call make, and thus take dependencies into account.

Thus, running 'sage -i' would call make, which in turn would call 'sage -i --nodep' individually on the packages that need be installed. And this way, the user interface does not change. And this way, dependencies will be taken into account by default.

I don't get this...

See comment [comment:33]: this ticket does not change any interface, only documentation.

> And this way, dependencies will be taken into account by default.

The whole point of this ticket is that `make package` should be considered the default way of installing packages. So dependencies are taken into account by default.

I don't quite find backwards compatibility a compelling enough reason to keep the old behavior of `sage -i ...`: I find it likely that more users are currently misinstalling packages by not installing dependencies vs. ones who might want to force-install without a dependency-check in the future. The latter are more likely to know what they're doing and thus will be able to adapt to a change.

Given the amount of debate on this ticket, maybe we should have a discussion on sage-devel: how should we document installing packages?
- `make pkg`
- `sage -i pkg` (backwards-incompatible, with a new option `sage -i --no-deps pkg`)
- `sage -m pkg` and/or `sage --make pkg`
(Or was there a discussion that I missed?) I have a slight, not strong, preference, for the second one. An advantage of 1 and 3 is that they keep the current behavior of `sage -i`. An advantage of 2 and 3 is that they can be run from anywhere, not just SAGE_ROOT.

As far as this ticket actually goes, if we want to recommend `make pkg`, then you should also change the `sage` command so that `-i` is not listed as a basic option. Same with `src/doc/en/reference/repl/options.rst`.

I do not think that backward compatibility matters here. If the behaviour of `sage -i` becomes something that the users should not call anymore, then it is better to change its behaviour so that they can keep calling it.

By 'user interface' I mean 'what the users should call'. If you change the errors messages and the doc to tell the users to call something else, then surely our "interface with the users" changes.

> To understand each other better, could you please answer the following questions with yes/no:

Not the subject here.
> Should ./sage -docbuild ... also build the dependencies of the documentation?

Not the subject here.
> Should ./sage -i package ... also build the dependencies of package?

Yes
> If the answer is not 3 times the same, I would like to know the reason.

Is it really a problem for you if one command takes dependencies into account and not the others? If it is, it is not for me and the users probably do not care: among those three commands, they only run the third.

> The whole point of this ticket is that make package should be considered the default way of installing packages. So dependencies are taken into account by default.

And for this reason it would be better, in order to *not* change our users's custom, to change what they have to call (`sage -i`) but rather to change the behaviour of that command (`sage -i`) so that it does what you want, i.e. take dependencies into account.

All things being equal, the answer to all three would be "no". Also, all three options for the `sage` command should be considered "advanced" options and not widely advertised.

Since `sage -i` has been the only way to install packages until recently, though, I'm not sure all things are equal. Maybe you're right, though, and we should encourage using `make pkg`, and after a while, `sage -i pkg` will be used less and less, and it can be thought of the same way as `sage -b` and `sage --docbuild`.

For me, there is a large difference between `sage -i --no-deps` and `sage -p`.
