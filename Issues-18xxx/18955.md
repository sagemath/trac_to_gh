This timeout is caused by the "poison" proxy:

```
build/bin/sage-spkg:export http_proxy=http://192.0.2.0:5187/
```

but I don't know why the process is searching for pip. My workaround was `python -m ensurepip`, but that's only going to work for python>=2.7.9.

I also tried `sage -i pip`, but it depends on setuptools, so that's circular.

I'm not sure how you're going to solve this.

Resolution: invalid

<a id='comment:4'></a>The "setuptools is already installed" message makes me strongly suspect that pip is also already installed. You won't be able to reproduce this if you're in an old checkout where pip is installed. I too can get the setuptools spkg to install if I (manually) ensure pip is already installed, which I mentioned in my OP workaround.

To test, python -m pip should fail with "no such module".

I ran `make`, from a fresh clone.

Demo session:


```

<a id='comment:5'></a>Attachment [setuptools-12.4.log](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket18955/setuptools-12.4.log) by @jhpalmieri created at 2015-07-27 18:15:22

If I install from a fresh version 6.8 tarball (from http://files.sagemath.org/src/index.html), I don't see this problem. setuptools is installed before pip, and the string "pip" is not found anywhere in the setuptools log file. Could you have some environment variable which is interfering? Or some Python configuration file?

<a id='comment:7'></a>So. I traced through it. I believe the sequents of events are this:

   * we run: python setup.py install
   * which runs: setup.py egg_info
   * even though it's not installed yet, this uses setuptools' egg_info.run
   * which iterates through all "egg_info.writers" entrypoints (whatever that may be)
   * one of which is ~/.local/.../pbr  (this is why you can't repro =/)
   * pbr apparently requires pip
   * setuptools ensures entrypoint requirements are met
   * so it tries to install pip
   * splosion

In summary, NOTABUG. Possibly it's a pbr or setuptools bug, but probably not.

That said, sage --env could prevent this issue in future by setting `PYTHONNOUSERSITE=true`.

<a id='comment:10'></a>I would set it while running sage as well, and change the comment to "prevent ~/.local python packages from interfering with sage".

As far as I've seen, the sage philosophy is that sage dependencies are essentially separate from any system software.
