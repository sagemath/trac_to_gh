Normaliz needs updating to bugfix release 2.12.2 or better

From normaliz website:
Version 2.12.2: bug fix in volume computation with -v and change max_rank_submatrix back to pre2.12 version which avoids some overflows

(Upstream provides the distribution in a zip file; why does sage use a repackaged .tar.bz2?)

we still need to rename the package root directory, as our current scripts do not handle their naming scheme. Thus

tarball: http://users.ox.ac.uk/~coml0531/sage/normaliz-3.1.0.tar.bz2

zip would be yet another dependency to have; e.g. I'm not sure whether OSX without Xcode does have (un)zip installed; ditto for 
a typical Linux distro...

upstream [says](https://github.com/Normaliz/Normaliz/issues/83) that 3.1 will be available in January.

(yes, they host the code here now: https://github.com/Normaliz/Normaliz/)

Am I correct that there is no exposure of normaliz in Sage, apart from normaliz lib in Singular?
