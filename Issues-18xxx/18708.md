Normaliz needs updating to bugfix release 2.12.2 or better

From normaliz website:
Version 2.12.2: bug fix in volume computation with -v and change max_rank_submatrix back to pre2.12 version which avoids some overflows

(Upstream provides the distribution in a zip file; why does sage use a repackaged .tar.bz2?)

we still need to rename the package root directory, as our current scripts do not handle their naming scheme. Thus

zip would be yet another dependency to have; e.g. I'm not sure whether OSX without Xcode does have (un)zip installed; ditto for 
a typical Linux distro...

upstream [says](https://github.com/Normaliz/Normaliz/issues/83) that 3.1 will be available in January.

(yes, they host the code here now: https://github.com/Normaliz/Normaliz/)

Am I correct that there is no exposure of normaliz in Sage, apart from normaliz lib in Singular?

The normaliz "buildsystem" is a joke, imho a serious red flag. Once again we see that handcrafted makefiles do not work. In this case, not passing through LDFLAGS to the linker. But really thats just the tip of the iceberg: Not able to build a shared library, not even an install target.

I did have to re-pack anyway. Before I discovered this, I noticed a bug that I fixed.
Perhaps I should have added it to this branch:
