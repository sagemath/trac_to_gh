This ticket improves the algorithmic complexity (`n^4` to `n^3` for
`radical_basis`) and further optimizes the code for computing the
radical and the Cartan invariants matrix.

Without:

```
sage: A = HeckeMonoid(SymmetricGroup(5)).algebra(QQ)
sage: %time len(A.radical_basis())
CPU times: user 4.25 s, sys: 45.1 ms, total: 4.3 s
Wall time: 4.26 s
104
sage: %time A.cartan_invariants_matrix()
CPU times: user 45.2 s, sys: 267 ms, total: 45.4 s
Wall time: 45.5 s
```

With:

```
sage: A = HeckeMonoid(SymmetricGroup(5)).algebra(QQ)
sage: %time len(A.radical_basis())
CPU times: user 418 ms, sys: 29.5 ms, total: 447 ms
Wall time: 422 ms
104
sage: %time A.cartan_invariants_matrix_by_characters()
CPU times: user 9.39 s, sys: 208 ms, total: 9.6 s
Wall time: 9.53 s
```

(the above examples do not use that this is a monoid algebra, though
of course the sparsity helps).

The dependency on #6484 is only for speed.

Hello,

I just took some time to read the patch.

`FiniteDimensionalAlgebrasWithBasis.multiplication_matrix` the name is not very explicit, what about `basis_action_matrices` ? As well, wether we want sparse matrices or not may be given as an argument?

Should we overwrite the previous method for Cartan invariant matrix from #16659 with this new one ? Indeed the return should be the same and it's much faster! In this case maybe we may want to wait that #16659 is positive_reviewed to avoid merging issues.

Everything else looks good to me (modulo the remaining documentation)
I can do the aforementioned modifications.

Thanks!

> `FiniteDimensionalAlgebrasWithBasis.multiplication_matrix` the name is not very explicit, what about `basis_action_matrices` ?


Agreed; maybe `multiplication_matrix_on_basis`. Suggestions anyone?

> As well, wether we want sparse matrices or not may be given as an argument?


Maybe indeed. I am also thinking about an option that would apply to
the whole algebra to state whether its coefficients structure are
sparse or dense.

> Should we overwrite the previous method for Cartan invariant matrix from #16659 with this new one ? Indeed the return should be the same and it's much faster!


This one is only valid in large enough characteristic. Also it can be
good to have several algorithm for comparison. But I agree we probably
want to have an option instead (and possibly several private methods
behind the scene).

> In this case maybe we may want to wait that #16659 is positive_reviewed to avoid merging issues.


Yeah, I'd rather wait for #16659 to be finished.

> Everything else looks good to me (modulo the remaining documentation)
> I can do the aforementioned modifications.


Let's discuss this tomorrow with Florent. We might want to think about
the graded Cartan matrix.

Cheers,
