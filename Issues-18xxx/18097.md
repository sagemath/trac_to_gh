Computing the syndrome of a vector is useful for many things (eg: decoding) in coding theory, but linear code does not have any syndrome method.

Besides, actual parity-check matrix computation creates a new `LinearCode` object. It can be enhanced in a way where this new object is not created anymore.  

Furthermore, linear_code does not have a `latex` method.

Hello,

From what I understand from your examples, I guess that having no syndrome means that you belong to the code. If so, it would be cool to have it in the documentation.

I tried to see the path used by your syndrome method. It is quite complicated as it goes through the dual code. This is relatively fast on the small examples you have but might be a trouble if you rely intensively on this method later on. Isn't there something more efficient?

Does it make sense only for vectors in `GF(2)`? Otherwise, please add examples with more exotic finite fields.

Vincent

Hello,

I fixed docstring and doctests for `syndrome` method.
