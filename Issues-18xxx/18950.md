`make_dlxwrapper` is used for creating a dlx_solver from a pickled list:

```
 $ sage -grep make_dlxwrapper
sage/combinat/matrices/all.py:from dancing_links import make_dlxwrapper
sage/combinat/matrices/dancing_links.pyx:            sage: x = make_dlxwrapper(dumps(rows))
sage/combinat/matrices/dancing_links.pyx:            sage: print make_dlxwrapper(dumps(rows)).__str__()
sage/combinat/matrices/dancing_links.pyx:            sage: x = make_dlxwrapper(dumps(rows))
sage/combinat/matrices/dancing_links.pyx:        return sage.combinat.matrices.dancing_links.make_dlxwrapper, (dumps(self.rows),)
sage/combinat/matrices/dancing_links.pyx:def make_dlxwrapper(s):
sage/combinat/matrices/dancing_links.pyx:        sage: x = make_dlxwrapper(dumps(rows))
```

This is a follow-up for #11814.
