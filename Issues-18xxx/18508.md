There are a number of really small issues when trying to build with python 3:

1. sagenb is a marked as dependency of jmol, even though this is no longer the case
2. sagenb is marked as a runtime dependency of sage, again this is no longer the case
3. scons and sagenb don't work with python 3, so they should only be a standard package for python 2
4. atlas needs a small change to make its build script work with python 3

No, it's not a run-time dependency, since Sage works without the Sage notebook. Of course, the `notebook()` command doesn't work, but that doesn't matter.

Just define `PYTHON` as alias of `PYTHON2` or `PYTHON3`, analogous how `build/install` deals with `GMP/MPIR` and the toolchain. See the `SAGE_MP_LIBRARY` and `TOOLCHAIN` variables.

I think that future might be more distant than you think... but that is besides the point anyway.

This isn't just about beauty. It's about writing code which is easy to understand by doing things in a consistent way.

+1

Plus we might also want to work on the build/ files to make them more readable, and that task is not made simpler if we have to clean "workarounds" on the way.

P.S.: this does not exactly give the impression of a 'clean job'.

I've been basically assuming that #17854 will be done in the not too distant future, which will remove half of the scons dependency.

It's only `ntl_wrap` which remains (#18367). Moving `ntl_wrap` to the Sage library is relatively easy I think but a lot of boring work.
