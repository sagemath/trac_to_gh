There are a number of really small issues when trying to build with python 3:

1. sagenb is a marked as dependency of jmol, even though this is no longer the case
2. sagenb is marked as a runtime dependency of sage, again this is no longer the case
3. scons and sagenb don't work with python 3, so they should only be a standard package for python 2
4. atlas needs a small change to make its build script work with python 3

The `notebook()` command uses sagenb, so its a runtime dependency. See also #18512

I'm fine with EOL'ing SageNB with Python2, but you should probably post to sage-devel to see if anybody is interested in maintaining it.

No, it's not a run-time dependency, since Sage works without the Sage notebook. Of course, the `notebook()` command doesn't work, but that doesn't matter.

There are other packages that could be removed yet Sage would still starts up; of course some functionality is then missing. I don't see how sagenb is different. Define "works". If you mean "works enough to create the conway polynomial pickles" then I guess so.

The `python2standard` type is from #17607

This is actually documented in `build/deps`:

I don't like this from #17607:

```
    if [ "$1" = all ]; then
        PKG_VAR=PYTHON
        if [ "$SAGE_PYTHON3" = yes ]; then
            PKG_NAME=python3

```

Just define `PYTHON` as alias of `PYTHON2` or `PYTHON3`, analogous how `build/install` deals with `GMP/MPIR` and the toolchain. See the `SAGE_MP_LIBRARY` and `TOOLCHAIN` variables.

I think that future might be more distant than you think... but that is besides the point anyway.

This isn't just about beauty. It's about writing code which is easy to understand by doing things in a consistent way.

+1

Plus we might also want to work on the build/ files to make them more readable, and that task is not made simpler if we have to clean "workarounds" on the way.

P.S.: this does not exactly give the impression of a 'clean job'.

It's only `ntl_wrap` which remains (#18367). Moving `ntl_wrap` to the Sage library is relatively easy I think but a lot of boring work.
