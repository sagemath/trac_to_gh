There are a number of really small issues when trying to build with python 3:

1. sagenb is a marked as dependency of jmol, even though this is no longer the case
2. sagenb is marked as a runtime dependency of sage, again this is no longer the case
3. scons and sagenb don't work with python 3, so they should only be a standard package for python 2
4. atlas needs a small change to make its build script work with python 3

No, it's not a run-time dependency, since Sage works without the Sage notebook. Of course, the `notebook()` command doesn't work, but that doesn't matter.

There are other packages that could be removed yet Sage would still starts up; of course some functionality is then missing. I don't see how sagenb is different. Define "works". If you mean "works enough to create the conway polynomial pickles" then I guess so.

The `python2standard` type is from #17607

I don't like this from #17607:

```
    if [ "$1" = all ]; then
        PKG_VAR=PYTHON
        if [ "$SAGE_PYTHON3" = yes ]; then
            PKG_NAME=python3
        else
            PKG_NAME=python2
        fi
        PKG_VERSION=$(newest_version $PKG_NAME)
        echo "$PKG_NAME $PKG_VERSION $PKG_VAR"
    fi
```

Just define `PYTHON` as alias of `PYTHON2` or `PYTHON3`, analogous how `build/install` deals with `GMP/MPIR` and the toolchain. See the `SAGE_MP_LIBRARY` and `TOOLCHAIN` variables.

+1

Plus we might also want to work on the build/ files to make them more readable, and that task is not made simpler if we have to clean "workarounds" on the way.

If it helps you, I propose to make `scons` an optional package. It will still be built by default since it's needed as dependency of `polybori` and `c_lib`.
