```
sage: A = Automaton()
sage: A.add_state(42)
42
sage: A
Automaton with 1 states
```
The last line is wrong and should be "...with 1 state".

Hello,

While you are at it, this is also wrong

```
sage: FiniteStateMachine()
Finite state machine with 0 states
```
It should rather be `Empty finite state machine`.

Hello,

For the future: the commit message should not be that long. It must start with a one-line description (~70 characters). Possibly you can add some more comments after a line break. Something like

```
"0 states" -> "empty" for Finite State Machine

We change the method _repr_ for Automaton, Finite State Machine and
Transducer to be more friendly when there is no state.
```
