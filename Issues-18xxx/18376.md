For now, linear codes don't have a proper structure for encoding, "encoding" meaning handle the bijection between a message space of the code and its ambient space.

We propose in this ticket a new structure, designed to handle message -> codeword and codeword -> message transformations. The former operation is designated as encoding, the latter as unencoding.

We provide the following:

- An abstract class `Encoder`, for inheritances purposes. Every Encoder will inherit from this class. It contains:
    - a default constructor;
    - both `encode` and `unencode` methods. They come with a default implementations for encoders
      whose message space is a vectorial space;
    - several methods to get information on the instance of the class;
    - `generator_matrix` method (see Design) and
    - explanations on what to do to create a new encoder subclass. 

- An exception class `EncodingFailure`, for errors related to encoding or unencoding.

- Methods for encoding and unencoding handling in `AbstractLinearCode` (see Design)

## Design

Some codes families might have different message spaces. In the case of -for instance- Reed-Solomon codes, it is possible to transform elements of a Polynomial Ring into codewords, as well as elements of a vectorial space.
We wanted to be able to support encoding over all possible message spaces, which is here represented by Encoder subclasses. Continuing the Reed-Solomon example, we will have a `PolynomialEncoder` and a `VectorialEncoder`.

Considering this particularity, we chose to let encoders deal with generator matrix computation, as it
depends on the message space.

Of course, this multiplicity of objects and spaces might be confusing for people who just want to encode
elements without being bothered by all these messages spaces. So, we created a set of methods to directly
perform encoding operations on the code itself. We added a new field in `AbstractLinearCode`, called 
`default_encoder`. This field indicates to the program which encoder it should use if none is specified. For instance, with a code `C` and a message `m`, one can directly call `C.encode(m)`. In that case, the default encoder will be used to perform the encoding operation. This works for every encoder-related method, like `unencode()`, or `generator_matrix`.

As there might be numerous encoders for a same code family, we chose to maintain a dictionary of known encoders for every code family. In this ticket, only one encoder is provided, called `LinearCodeGeneratorMatrixEncoder`. If one wants to create an instance of this encoder for a code `C`, he can of course call

```
E = LinearCodeGeneratorMatrixEncoder(C)
```
but we propose something better. While calling the method `C.encoders_available()`, one will get a list of all known encoders for `C`. For any linear code, he will get `['GeneratorMatrix']`. After that, he can call

```
E = C.encoder('GeneratorMatrix')
```
which will also instantiate `LinearCodeGeneratorMatrixEncoder` for `C` and cache the result as well.
So, any further call (for instance, `C.encode(m, 'GeneratorMatrix')`) to this encoder will be fast, and will guarantee that the same `LinearCodeGeneratorMatrixEncoder` will be used every time.

The dictionary of available encoders for every code family is filled in `__init__.py`, as any instance of a subclass has to know some specific encoders. Furthermore, it is possible to add an encoder subclass for a specific instance of a code using the method `add_encoder`.

With this design, we are able to satisfy specific experimentation which requires specific encoders as well as generic experimentation for which any encoder will be fine.

Users will probably most often use and expect the message space `F^k`,
where `k` is the dimension of the code, and `F` the field. For this reason,
the default encoder should be an encoder with this message space, such
that `C.encode(m)` expects `m` from `F^k` and `C.unencode(c)` returns an
element of `F^k`.

We also now have a default implementation of `generator_matrix` in `AbstractLinearCode` which calls the `generator_matrix` method of the selected encoder.

Hello,

I think the term "lift" is not that good to describe such an operation.
The operation we're talking about here consists in taking an element of the "bigger space" (the ambient space) to the "smaller space" (the message space), while "lift" usually means going from the small space to the big one.

Furthermore, I think it's not really intuitive when it comes to discovery by <tab> completion: if one writes 
`sage: C.<tab>` or `sage: E.<tab>` (with `C` a code and `E` an encoder) and sees the word `unencode`,  he understands immediately (imho) the meaning of it, while the term "lift" does not seem to be that straightforward.

<a id='comment:15'></a>
Helloooooo,

Here are my remarks/questions while I was looking for the first time at your
code. Let's get this thing in so that you are not blocked for the more
mathematical parts.

- Vectorial space -> vector space?

- default implementation*s* of `encode()` and `unencode_nocheck()` methods

- call Encoder‘s `__init__()` in --> `Encoder.__init__` ?

- As Encoder is not designed to be implemented -> instanciated?

- Instead of typing the name of a method/class/function inside backticks, you
  should *link* to it, i.e. replace:
  <code>Returns the code in which \`\`self.encode()\`\` has its output.</code>
  with
  <code>Returns the code in which :meth:\`encode\` has its output.</code>
  You can then check by compiling the documentation with `--warn-links` that
  everything behaves as expected.
  (happens in many places)

- Transforms an element of the message space into an element of the code -->
  into a codeword?

- You have a `unencode()` method with a `check` argument on one hand, and a
  `unencode_nocheck` method on the other hand. It makes me think that the two
  should be merged somehow, but I do not know exactly how they differ.

- What about rewriting the following message by creating a bibliography entry
  for codinglib?
  {{{This function is taken from codinglib
  (https://bitbucket.org/jsrn/codinglib/) and was written by Johan Nielsen.}}}
  It would become
  `This function is taken from codinglib [Nielsen]_`
  and link toward an entry where both the url and the authors are given.

- Documentation of `unencoder_matrix`:
  `This is a helper function, for internal use only.`
  If it is not meant for public use, can't we rename it to `_unencoder_matrix`?

- `EncodingFailure` -> Given that most exceptions end with `Error`, what about
  `EncodingError`?

- Index of encoders -> It is a bit odd that you advertise `codes.encoders` as
  the way to get their list, while the entry that follows starts with
  `linear_code.`

- `To import these names into the global namespace, use:` --> it sems that the
  code is *already* in the global namespace?...

- `encoder_default_name` -> `default_encoder`?

- `if(name in reg_enc.keys())` --> creates a temporary and useless list,
  i.e. the list of keys. `if name in reg_enc` works.

- (honest question) what is the point of letting the users add encoders with
  this `add_encoder` method? If a user implements a new encoder, what does he
  earn by linking it inside of the instance instead of using it independenly?
  If there is such an advantage, could you illustrate it with an example in the
  function's docstring?

- When you accept `**kwargs` as input, please say that all additional arguments
  are accepted and forwarded to function <X>:
  `def encode(self, word, name=None, **kwargs):`

- In the same `encode` function, I find the variable `name` a bit vague. What
  about `encoder_name` or `encoder`?

- The same happens in: `encoder()`, `generator_matrix`, `unencode`.

- Instead of `encoders_available`, what about simply `encoders`? I do not see
  the added value of `_available` there. Furthermore, what about returning a
  copy of the inner dictionary? Given that you can use a dictionary as you would
  use a list (`list(my_dict)`, `for x in my_dict`, `if x in my_dict`) why
  wouldn't we return everything at once?

- `information_set` takes nothing as argument but calls `generator_matrix` which
  can depend on an encoder. Could you expose that flag and document it? That's
  the price of exposing in `LinearCode` the methods which are defined only in
  its encoder object.. It is a bit awkward `:-/`

- Really, these methods `encode` and `unencode` have nothing to do in
  `LinearCode`. You should "accept your own design" and have all these things be
  available only in the `Encoder` object, otherwise there will be a crazy amount
  of copy/paste with those arguments.

- What about simplifying

  ```
  The only purpose of this encoder is to set generic linear codes
  into the new Encoder structure by providing a valid ``generator_matrix``
  method.
  ```
  As
  `This is the default encoder of a generic linear code`?

- About:

  ```
  Its ``generator_matrix`` method returns private field ``_generator_matrix``
  of its associated code if any, else it calls the ``generator_matrix`` method
  of the default encoder of the associated code.
  ```
  Isn't that "over-documenting"? One can obain this kind of information by
  reading the code (e.g. by adding ?? at the end of the function-->easy), and it
  is very unlikely that we will think of updating it if it ever changes.

- How is this

  ```
  if hasattr(self.code(), "_generator_matrix"):
      return self.code()._generator_matrix
  else:
      return self.code().generator_matrix()
  ```
  better than `return self.code().generator_matrix()`?

- About:

  ```
  class Encoder(SageObject):
     ...
     This class provides:

     - some methods for encoder objects
  ```
  Err. Well, I could have guessed `:-P`
  Why wouldn't you say "nothing there"? This kind of information can be obtained
  by tab completion or by browsing the html doc.

- If the following is meant for developers, I think we do not need it
  (especially since the patches will either be written or reviewed by you
  `:-P`). As for users, I can't see what they are expected to make of it. Surely
  they can call their classes as they like?

  ```
  .. NOTE::

      For consistency on encoders, please follow this convention on names for subclasses:
      for a new encoder named ``EncName``, for code family ``CodeFam``, call it
      ``CodeFamEncNameEncoder``.
  ```

- If this `code` must be an instance of a specific class, could you make it
  explicit? It may be as simple as turning the second occurrence of 'code' into
  a Sphinx link toward a class.
  <code>- \`\`code\`\` -- the associated code of \`\`self\`\`</code>

- I do not understand why the `Encoder` class provides methods to encode/decode
  linear codes from the matrix, given that you cannot be sure that a matrix is
  available. Shouldn't this be in `LinearCodeGeneratorMatrixEncoder`?

- About having this 'name' parameter everywhere. What would be the problem with
  some `set_encoder` function which would define the instance's default encoder,
  and have all other functions call that? This could be defined from a string
  (using the list of available encoders) or by giving a class directly, which
  would make a public 'add_encoder' function useless, as users would have an
  easy way to plug their own encoder into the instance.

I am now in Nantes. It took me a Nice->Nantes flight to work on this review. I
love this city. Plus the weather is good but not as hot as in the
south. Cooooooool.

Have fuuuuuuuuuuuun,

Nathann

Hello!

>mathematical parts.

Thanks a lot for this, and for being that thorough! It's exactly the kind of comments we were hoping for.

I fixed the typos and small mistakes you noticed.
Here are some answers to your questions:

>To import these names into the global namespace, use: --> it sems that the code is *already* in the >global namespace?...

It shouldn't be available in global namespace. I fixed that.

>`encoder_default_name` -> `default_encoder`? 

I kept `encoder_default_name` as it's the name of the encoder (the string that points to it), and not the object in itself.

>How is this


```
if hasattr(self.code(), "_generator_matrix"):
    return self.code()._generator_matrix
else:
    return self.code().generator_matrix()
```
>better than return `self.code().generator_matrix()`?

This encoder is designed to put generic linear codes (`LinearCode` class) into the new framework. And in `LinearCode`, you have a class parameter `_generator_matrix` because one has to provide a generator matrix when he build a "structureless" linear code. 
As `generator_matrix()` method in `AbstractLinearCode` returns the generator matrix given by the default encoder, which is, for these `LinearCode`s the one you pointed out, if this encoder had this `self.code().generator_matrix()` in its `generator_matrix()` method, it will lead to an infinite loop when calling `LinearCode.generator_matrix()`. 

>`information_set` takes nothing as argument but calls `generator_matrix` which can depend on an encoder. Could you expose that flag and document it? That's the price of exposing in `LinearCode` the methods which are defined only in its encoder object.. It is a bit awkward `:-/`

Actually, the information set can be computed from any generator matrix, and it will always return the same result whatever the generator matrix I used to compute it. As the default encoder of a code has a valid `generator_matrix` method, and as `C.generator_matrix()` calls the default encoder, the code of `information_set()` will always return a valid result.

>Really, these methods `encode` and `unencode` have nothing to do in `LinearCode`. You should "accept your own design" and have all these things be available only in the `Encoder` object, otherwise there will be a crazy amount of copy/paste with those arguments. 

I do think they should be there. A lot of users won't care about the kind of encoding/decoding which will be used underneath as long as they get what they expect. For these users, being able to directly call `MyCode.encode(m)` or `MyCode.unencode(c)` instead of having to ask for the list of available encoders, pick the one they want, create it, and call `encode` or `unencode` on it is a really helpful feature.

>I do not understand why the `Encoder` class provides methods to encode/decode linear codes from the matrix, given that you cannot be sure that a matrix is available. Shouldn't this be in `LinearCodeGeneratorMatrixEncoder`?

If you know a generator matrix for the encoder you're writing, you just have to implement `generator_matrix` and you get immediately `encode` and `unencode`.

If you don't have one, you have to override these methods in your encoder. It's just a way to make developer's life easier `:)`

>Instead of `encoders_available`, what about simply encoders? I do not see the added value of `_available` there. Furthermore, what about returning a copy of the inner dictionary?

My point here is that the code tries to meddle with the private\nattributes of another class, and I thought that it could be easily avoided. I\ncan understand that there would be an infinite loop somewhere if you only did\nthe replacement I proposed, so what about *moving* this cache check to the\n`.generator_matrix` method of the `code()` object? In this situation, you would\nbe able to perform the replacement I proposed, and the only method which would\ntry to detect private attributes would do so *in its own class* which is a bit\n'cleaner'.\n\n> Actually, the information set can be computed from any generator matrix, and\n> it will always return the same result whatever the generator matrix I used to\n> compute it.

They do not have to go through the\nlist, or understand it, or anything else. Your design here is leading you to\ncopy the functions of an encoder to a higher-level class, and it does not sound\nat all like a good idea from the programming point of view. From the user's\npoint of view this is also debattable, for having users call 'encoder()' makes\nthem aware that several encoders are available.\n\nYou designed your code to have Encoder objects, and quite naturally that's where\nthe `encode/unencode` methods live. If you distinguish a code and its encoder,\nyou should accept the consequences. And they are not so bad on the user's side,\nfor (s)he can create the encoder without making any choice, i.e. by calling\n`.encoder()`.\n\n> >I do not understand why the `Encoder` class provides methods to encode/decode\n> >linear codes from the matrix, given that you cannot be sure that a matrix is\n> >available.

You define methods which assume *more* on the object than what\nit should (i.e. that the matrix is available). If it is instanciated without\nthat matrix these functions will break.\n\nWhat i suggest is to move them to a class (inheriting from Encoder) whose name\nmakes it clear that the generator matrix should be available. In this situation,\nanybody creating a class that inherits from that other class will do it in full\nknowledge that a matrix has to be available, and does not run the risk of\ninheriting broken methods.\n\nYou can pick any name you like for that other class, of course.\n\n> In `AbstractLinearCode`, we already provide a method called `encode` and\n> another called `encoder`.

Hellooooooo again,

It seems that your branch has become uncompatible with the latest beta. Turns
out that it is my fault: #18926 `^^;`

> >`encoder_default_name` -> `default_encoder`?

I see. Would it be possible to pick 'default_encoder_name' then? It sounds "more
english" to say "the default encoder's name". Otherwise it seems that you are
talking of the default name of an encoder.

I do not think that I follow this hierarchy of classes and calls between them as
well as you do. My point here is that the code tries to meddle with the private
attributes of another class, and I thought that it could be easily avoided. I
can understand that there would be an infinite loop somewhere if you only did
the replacement I proposed, so what about *moving* this cache check to the
`.generator_matrix` method of the `code()` object? In this situation, you would
be able to perform the replacement I proposed, and the only method which would
try to detect private attributes would do so *in its own class* which is a bit
'cleaner'.

Agreed for validity, now what about speed? I agree to let it lie, but having
these things appear is a sign that those methods are exposed too high,
especially when you want to handle several encoders at once.

That's hardly a problem: they can do `encoder = my_code.encoder()` and then play
with the encoder. They can even do `my_code.encoder().encode()` as this thing is
cached.

That's not true, as the example above shows. They do not have to go through the
list, or understand it, or anything else. Your design here is leading you to
copy the functions of an encoder to a higher-level class, and it does not sound
at all like a good idea from the programming point of view. From the user's
point of view this is also debattable, for having users call 'encoder()' makes
them aware that several encoders are available.

You designed your code to have Encoder objects, and quite naturally that's where
the `encode/unencode` methods live. If you distinguish a code and its encoder,
you should accept the consequences. And they are not so bad on the user's side,
for (s)he can create the encoder without making any choice, i.e. by calling
`.encoder()`.

I did not mean that the code should be replaced, but that it should be moved
somewhere else. You define methods which assume *more* on the object than what
it should (i.e. that the matrix is available). If it is instanciated without
that matrix these functions will break.

What i suggest is to move them to a class (inheriting from Encoder) whose name
makes it clear that the generator matrix should be available. In this situation,
anybody creating a class that inherits from that other class will do it in full
knowledge that a matrix has to be available, and does not run the risk of
inheriting broken methods.

You can pick any name you like for that other class, of course.

I disagree with the implementation choice and the explanations, but I am ready
to classify it under "matters of taste", in which case I don't have any reason
to force mine, given that you are the one who writes the code.

Okay, accepted under 'confusing' when the user asks for the names only, and
cannot be assumed to understand more technicality.

When the users explicitly asks for both names and classes, however, I see little
interest in returning the list of `.items()` instead of the dictionary. Would
you have anything against returning a copy of the dict in this case?

You convinced me that some encoders have features that others do not have, and
that for this reason it made no sense to have a 'main' encoder in the class.

Not true. You would create several encoders, and use them directly.

Have fun,

Nathann

Hello,

I do not think that there is something inherently wrong in the way you expect user to call your code. To me, there is something wrong in the design of classes, and the way it is implemented. I tried to show that 'accepting the class design' would lead you to a different user interface.

For a while, I tried to forget what you wanted to represent (easier for me than for you), and it appeared to me that you were implementing class inheritance backwards.

Look at it, it is quite surprising: here is the list of methods of an encoder object I built:

```
sage: e.
e.category          e.db                e.dumps             e.generator_matrix  e.parent            e.reset_name        e.unencode          e.version           
e.code              e.dump              e.encode            e.message_space     e.rename            e.save              e.unencode_nocheck  
```

If you remove the useless ones, you are left with those:

```
e.code()             # returns the 'parent' code()
e.encode()           # =e.code().encode()
e.generator_matrix() # =e.code().generator_matrix()
e.message_space()    # =e.code().ambiant_space()
e.unencode()         # =e.code().unencode()
```

It is funny to notice two things:
1) All encoder methods can be called directly from the code (i.e. at the moment there is no point to build the encoder object)
2) Some code functions call the encoder's function, which leads you to create one-line functions with 30 lines of doc each time.

If I just look at the code, it seems that you just want your code to inherit the methods implemented in the encoder, i.e. generator_matrix, encode, and unencode. Then you get this for free.

If you find a way to make all these functions available at the level of the code without having to copy/paste a lot of things, it would solve my main (and perhaps only) objection about the classes' design.

Hi Nathann,

I don't think I'm following your criticism. I'll try to comment on your points.


> For a while, I tried to forget what you wanted to represent (easier for me than for you), and it appeared to me that you were implementing class inheritance backwards.

Yes, we are "forwarding" certain functions from (multiple) encoder classes in *one* class `AbstractLinearCode`. The many classes that will inherit from `AbstractLinearCode` will all inherit this forwarding. There is a one-shot overhead in the implementation of `AbstractLinearCode` (in this ticket) -- that's all.

> Look at it, it is quite surprising: here is the list of methods of an encoder object I built:
> ...
> It is funny to notice two things:

Yes, that's a feature: the encoder objects will be created behind the scenes and the user will access them transparently through the code object.

The "there is no point to build the encoder object" is unclear to me. In the proposed ticket, the encoder object must be build behind the scenes, or the code functions would not work. Note that there is an (at least) one-to-many relation between code classes and encoders. This ticket is about supporting that multiplicity of encoders in an elegant fashion; elegance seen from the user perspective and future code class designers.

The proposed ticket puts as much of the boiler-plate as possible into `AbstractLinearCode`, e.g. for selecting the right encoder, caching the encoder (including whatever cached objects it has), etc. Furthermore it puts in implementations of `encode`, `unencode` and `generator_matrix` whose usability purposes we have already discussed. Note again that these implementations will never be touched by sub-classes but will "just work".

> 2) Some code functions call the encoder's function, which leads you to create one-line functions with 30 lines of doc each time.

"Each time" means *this ticket*. No more. All later codes will inherit this forwarding and will never touch `encode`, `unencode` and `generator_matrix`. 

> If I just look at the code, it seems that you just want your code to inherit the methods implemented in the encoder, i.e. generator_matrix, encode, and unencode. Then you get this for free.

Are you suggesting killing off `Encoder` entirely? I think that impoverishes the design a lot. That encoders are instances of classes means that they have lots of power, e.g. caching and intro-spection. If that's not what you're talking about, then I don't understand.


> If you find a way to make all these functions available at the level of the code without having to copy/paste a lot of things, it would solve my main (and perhaps only) objection about the classes' design.

Good, because that's how the current ticket is from the point of view of new code classes and encoders :-) They will just inherit from `AbstractLinearCode` or `Encoder` respectively, and these "copy/paste" functions will be inherited.

Best,
Johan

Hello guys,

I do not think that I can bring anything new to this thread, and I do not see us going anywhere. I tried to answer several times, I did not have anything smart nor enlightening to add.

I cannot say that I agree with that code either, and there is no point in blocking the ticket until we drive ourselves mad over it.

If somebody else comes here and wants to give it a positive review I will not object. Same if you review it between yourselves. But I will not. What I could contribute was my view on the matter, and I did that already.

Have fun guys,

Nathann

Hi Nathann,

I completely disagree: you pointed out several things, and the main discussion here has been interesting. David, me and our colleague Julien spent about an hour rediscussing the code with your point of view as alternative. We just concluded that we preferred the proposed model :-)

Very fair, thanks. In any case, if/how the ticket gets reviewed, after whatever possible changes, the code will never be set in stone and we can change it if it sucks :-)

Thanks a lot for your input, Nathann! And have fuuuuuuuuuun in Nantes.

Hi,

1st step of review: looking at what the patchbot complains about:

- There is a function in `sage.coding.encoder` without a test. Is it the abstract `generator_matrix` that's causing it?

- The mystic `startup_modules` fails. This turns out to mean that the patchbot has detected that a new module is loaded at Sage startup: a thing that is nowadays attempted to keep a lid on by replacing normal imports with `lazy_import`. The new module is `sage.coding.encoder`. I'm pretty sure that this is due to line 3660 of `linear_code` which imports `encoder`. It doesn't seem possible to remove this import or change it to `lazy_import` since `Encoder` is referred just below. But what if `linear_code` itself was lazily imported in `sage.coding.all`? Some care possibly needs to be taken with the `registered_encoders` line in `__init__`. Could this line be put somewhere to activate it only when the `lazy_import` of `linear_code` gets dereferenced?

Best,
Johan

Yes it is:

```

How does one test an abstract method?

Looking at other uses of `abstract_method`, it seems that a specific example is used in the doctest. So you could use an example with `LinearCodeGeneratorMatrixEncoder`.

The last paragraph on\n   representation should also be in the list.\n4. Same docstring. If message space is not `F^k`, you also need to override `message_space`.\n5. Docstring of `Encoder.encode`, `INPUT block \"the code\" should be `self`.\n   `OUTPUT` block. `self` should be `self.code`.\n6. `Encoder.encode`. The `ValueError` should not refer to \"vector\", I think, to set the precedent of this error message for other encoders. Say `The value to encode` instead, for instance. Also remove the `a` just before `M` in that error.\n7. Docstring of `Encoder.unencode` could perhaps be more precise. Perhaps instead \"The inverse of `encode`: return the message corresponding to the codeword ``c``.\" Also the `INPUT` block seem to have been wrongly copy/pasted from a time when this was in `LinearCode`. Also, last sentence in describing ``nocheck`` could perhaps more enlightening be \"You might set this to ``True`` to disable the check for saving computation. Note that if ``c`` is not in ``self`` and ``nocheck = True``, then the output of `unencode` is not defined (except that it will be in the message space of `self`).\n8. `Encoder.unencode`. You don't need all the `else` stuff:  remove the first else branch completely, and always run the second `return self.unencode_nocheck(c)`.\n9. `Encoder.unencode_nocheck`. Perhaps the information set corresponding to `_unencoder_matrix` should be saved together with that matrix. Currently, the code -- rather brittly -- depends on `self.code.information_set` always returning the same result. Which is not part of that method's docstring (even though you now added `@cached_method` on its default implementation, which should still be there).\n10. `Encoder.unencode_nocheck`, docstring. I like that you added an example for a vector not in `C`. But perhaps you could reformulate that sentence to say  something like \"Taking a vector that does not belong to C will not raise an error, but probably just give a non-sensical result\".\n11. `Encoder.code` docstring. Perhaps just \"Returns the code for this `Encoder`\"? Also, in the Example, last line could be `E.code() == C` instead.\n12. `Encoder.encode` docstring: after reading the docstring of `Encoder.message_space`, I think that perhaps a reference to the possible partial function nature of `Encoder.encode` should be given there towards the end, as an information to future `Encoder` developers? Perhaps say what error should be raised in that case.\n13. Perhaps the `encoders` import statement in `coding/codes_catalog` should also be lazy? I know that `codes_catalog` is already lazy, but `encoders` will usually not be used, even if you use `codes_catalog`.\n14. Index of encoders, docstring could be generated with the new auto-table\n   functions Nathann made.\n15. `class AbstractLinearCode` docstring: I don't understand the point of `This class provides: ...`. Why is ``length`` there? There is a private property `_length` and a method `length()`. But for instance, `dimension()` is not mentioned? Why do you list `default_encoder_name` and `_registered_encoders` there? Perhaps \n16. `AbstractLinearCode`: the error thrown when giving an unknown encoder could perhaps hint at *how* to add this default encoder.\n17. `AbstractLinearCode` docline \"fill the dictionary...\" should add `.py` to the name of `__init__`.\n18. `AbstractLinearCode` docstring on `__cmp__` and `__eq__` could perhaps be clearer. Something like \"AbstractLinearCode has generic implementations of the comparison methods `__cmp__` and `__eq__` which use the generator matrix and are quite slow. In subclasses you are encouraged to override these functions.\" Is `__cmp__` and `__eq__` the exhaustive list of comparison functions?\n19. `AbstractLinearCode.add_encoder`. Perhaps the doc should clarify that the added encoder is only added to `self` and not any member of the class. As well as point the reader to how to do that instead.\n20. `AbstractLinearCode.add_encoder`. I don't like that all newly created codes copy the dictionary of registered encoders, when almost always, `add_encoder` is not going to be called on a created code. Instead, I think that in `add_encoder` you can add a check to see if `self._registered_encoders is self.__class__._registered_encoders` or something. If this is the case, *then* you make a new copy of `self._registered_encoders` and add the new encoder to it. Otherwise, `add_encoder` must have been already called on this code and you shouldn't make a new copy of course.\n21. `AbstractLinearCode.encode` doc is missing punctuation many places. Also in `encoder`. Maybe also elsewhere.\n22. `AbstractLinearCode.encode` docstring says \"the message space\". Should be \"a message space\". It should say prominently in the doc of both `encode` and `encoder` that the default encoder always has `F^k` as message space. Come to think of it, that should also be stated very clearly in the doc of `class AbstractLinearCode`.\n23. `AbstractLinearCode.encoder` docstring refers to `name` but its `encoder_name`. The doc should cleary describe that the encoder is cached (right now it's only indirectly referred to in the last pargraph). I think there should be a test of this.\n24. `AbstractLinearCode.encoder` the line `return self.encoder(encoder_name, **kwargs)` can simply be removed.\n25. `AbstractLinearCode.encoders_available` the variable `reg_enc` is superfluous and not even used, two lines below. Perhaps the argument `values` could be renamed to `classes`.\n26. `AbstractLinearCode.encode` and `.generator_matrix` and `.unencode` doc of `kwargs` and `LinearCode.generator_matrix`. Would it be more helpful to write \"all additional arguments are forwarded to the construction of the encoder that is used.\"\n27. `AbstractLinearCode.unencode` doc could be made more precise, like the `Encoder.unencode` doc. The doc of input `c` should just say that `c` is a codeword of `C`. `nocheck` should also be clarified like in `Encoder`. The OUTPUT block is uninformative and plain wrong (if `encoder_name` is set to something).\n28. `LinearCode.generator_matrix`. Why does this check that `_generator_matrix` exists? That is always the case? More importantly, if `encoder_name` is not `None` or `GeneratorMatrix`, then this function should not return `_generator_matrix` but `<that encoder>.generator_matrix()`. That could be more elegantly handled by a call to `super`'s `generator_matrix` function.\n29. `LinearCodeGeneratorMatrixEncoder._repr_` and `._latex_` should include the word \"the\" just before the code, I think. \n\nPhew, I think that's it :-)\n\nBest,\nJohan",

Ok, some comments, small and slightly less small:

1. Docstring of `class Encoder` says "... needed to describe properly the code defined in the subclass". "code" should be "encoder". But probably that sentence confuses more than it helps in any case :-)
2. Same docstring, why is "Then, if the message space..." and the following paragraph not part of the list?
3. The paragraph "Equality methods ..." is a bit strange. Perhaps

    By default, comparison of `Encoder`s (the methods``__eq__`` and ``__ne__``)
    are by memory reference: If you build the same encoder twice, they will be
    different. If you need something more clever, override ``__eq__`` and
    ``__ne__`` in you subclass.

   This paragraph should also be in the list. The last paragraph on
   representation should also be in the list.
4. Same docstring. If message space is not `F^k`, you also need to override `message_space`.
5. Docstring of `Encoder.encode`, `INPUT block "the code" should be `self`.
   `OUTPUT` block. `self` should be `self.code`.
6. `Encoder.encode`. The `ValueError` should not refer to "vector", I think, to set the precedent of this error message for other encoders. Say `The value to encode` instead, for instance. Also remove the `a` just before `M` in that error.
7. Docstring of `Encoder.unencode` could perhaps be more precise. Perhaps instead "The inverse of `encode`: return the message corresponding to the codeword ``c``." Also the `INPUT` block seem to have been wrongly copy/pasted from a time when this was in `LinearCode`. Also, last sentence in describing ``nocheck`` could perhaps more enlightening be "You might set this to ``True`` to disable the check for saving computation. Note that if ``c`` is not in ``self`` and ``nocheck = True``, then the output of `unencode` is not defined (except that it will be in the message space of `self`).
8. `Encoder.unencode`. You don't need all the `else` stuff:  remove the first else branch completely, and always run the second `return self.unencode_nocheck(c)`.
9. `Encoder.unencode_nocheck`. Perhaps the information set corresponding to `_unencoder_matrix` should be saved together with that matrix. Currently, the code -- rather brittly -- depends on `self.code.information_set` always returning the same result. Which is not part of that method's docstring (even though you now added `@cached_method` on its default implementation, which should still be there).
10. `Encoder.unencode_nocheck`, docstring. I like that you added an example for a vector not in `C`. But perhaps you could reformulate that sentence to say  something like "Taking a vector that does not belong to C will not raise an error, but probably just give a non-sensical result".
11. `Encoder.code` docstring. Perhaps just "Returns the code for this `Encoder`"? Also, in the Example, last line could be `E.code() == C` instead.
12. `Encoder.encode` docstring: after reading the docstring of `Encoder.message_space`, I think that perhaps a reference to the possible partial function nature of `Encoder.encode` should be given there towards the end, as an information to future `Encoder` developers? Perhaps say what error should be raised in that case.
13. Perhaps the `encoders` import statement in `coding/codes_catalog` should also be lazy? I know that `codes_catalog` is already lazy, but `encoders` will usually not be used, even if you use `codes_catalog`.
14. Index of encoders, docstring could be generated with the new auto-table
   functions Nathann made.
15. `class AbstractLinearCode` docstring: I don't understand the point of `This class provides: ...`. Why is ``length`` there? There is a private property `_length` and a method `length()`. But for instance, `dimension()` is not mentioned? Why do you list `default_encoder_name` and `_registered_encoders` there? Perhaps 
16. `AbstractLinearCode`: the error thrown when giving an unknown encoder could perhaps hint at *how* to add this default encoder.
17. `AbstractLinearCode` docline "fill the dictionary..." should add `.py` to the name of `__init__`.
18. `AbstractLinearCode` docstring on `__cmp__` and `__eq__` could perhaps be clearer. Something like "AbstractLinearCode has generic implementations of the comparison methods `__cmp__` and `__eq__` which use the generator matrix and are quite slow. In subclasses you are encouraged to override these functions." Is `__cmp__` and `__eq__` the exhaustive list of comparison functions?
19. `AbstractLinearCode.add_encoder`. Perhaps the doc should clarify that the added encoder is only added to `self` and not any member of the class. As well as point the reader to how to do that instead.
20. `AbstractLinearCode.add_encoder`. I don't like that all newly created codes copy the dictionary of registered encoders, when almost always, `add_encoder` is not going to be called on a created code. Instead, I think that in `add_encoder` you can add a check to see if `self._registered_encoders is self.__class__._registered_encoders` or something. If this is the case, *then* you make a new copy of `self._registered_encoders` and add the new encoder to it. Otherwise, `add_encoder` must have been already called on this code and you shouldn't make a new copy of course.
21. `AbstractLinearCode.encode` doc is missing punctuation many places. Also in `encoder`. Maybe also elsewhere.
22. `AbstractLinearCode.encode` docstring says "the message space". Should be "a message space". It should say prominently in the doc of both `encode` and `encoder` that the default encoder always has `F^k` as message space. Come to think of it, that should also be stated very clearly in the doc of `class AbstractLinearCode`.
23. `AbstractLinearCode.encoder` docstring refers to `name` but its `encoder_name`. The doc should cleary describe that the encoder is cached (right now it's only indirectly referred to in the last pargraph). I think there should be a test of this.
24. `AbstractLinearCode.encoder` the line `return self.encoder(encoder_name, **kwargs)` can simply be removed.
25. `AbstractLinearCode.encoders_available` the variable `reg_enc` is superfluous and not even used, two lines below. Perhaps the argument `values` could be renamed to `classes`.
26. `AbstractLinearCode.encode` and `.generator_matrix` and `.unencode` doc of `kwargs` and `LinearCode.generator_matrix`. Would it be more helpful to write "all additional arguments are forwarded to the construction of the encoder that is used."
27. `AbstractLinearCode.unencode` doc could be made more precise, like the `Encoder.unencode` doc. The doc of input `c` should just say that `c` is a codeword of `C`. `nocheck` should also be clarified like in `Encoder`. The OUTPUT block is uninformative and plain wrong (if `encoder_name` is set to something).
28. `LinearCode.generator_matrix`. Why does this check that `_generator_matrix` exists? That is always the case? More importantly, if `encoder_name` is not `None` or `GeneratorMatrix`, then this function should not return `_generator_matrix` but `<that encoder>.generator_matrix()`. That could be more elegantly handled by a call to `super`'s `generator_matrix` function.
29. `LinearCodeGeneratorMatrixEncoder._repr_` and `._latex_` should include the word "the" just before the code, I think. 

Phew, I think that's it :-)

Best,
Johan

I made (almost all) the requested changes.

A few remarks:

On comment 4, note that I kept the sentence starting by "returns ..." to stick to [docstring formatting rules](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#the-docstring-of-a-function-content).

On comment 6, I don't really get what you suggest. Do you propose to somehow register the unencoder_matrix and the information_set, for instance as some kind of class argument after their first computation?

On comment 9, I can't see what kind of other error can occur when encoding a word. Either it's an element from the message space and encoding goes well, either it's not and you get an error as illustrated in the doctest of `encoder`. Or am I missing something here?

On comment 12, I actually deleted the whole block.

On comment 19, I changed the `.. NOTE` block to a `.. WARNING` block to make this remark even more visible on the doc of `AbstractLinearCode`.

On comment 23, it's more helpful indeed. Change done.

On comment 24, as `c` is not necessarily a codeword (if `nocheck = True`, you can provide anything you want, as long as it belongs to the ambient space), I did not change the `INPUT` line for `c`.

On comment 26, it's already the case. Maybe you meant "shouldn't include the word "the" ", but in that case I think the error message would seem a bit weird imho. I have no strong feelings on this though.

Best,

David

Good idea.

Well, yes, the function won't explode if you give it `c` which is not a codeword and set `nocheck = True`, but that's *not at all* the intention of that function, and it's also not the intention of `nocheck = True`.
The function is undefined - and thus useless - on this input!
I think that the description of `c` should reflect the intended use of the function. Not the widest possible type for which the function won't explode.

> On comment 26, it's already the case. Maybe you meant "shouldn't include the word "the" ", but in that case I think the error message would seem a bit weird imho. I have no strong feelings on this though.

Yes, I meant "shouldn't" :-) It's debatable, I guess, but having "the" doesn't seem to be convention in Sage:

```
sage: MatrixSpace(RR, 2, 3)
Full MatrixSpace of 2 by 3 dense matrices over Real Field with 53 bits of precision
sage: PolynomialRing(GF(2),'x')
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Finite Field of size 2 (using NTL)
sage: Hom(RR, ZZ)
Set of Homomorphisms from Real Field with 53 bits of precision to Integer Ring
```

Furthermore, the `_repr_` doesn't uniquely specify "the" code, but usually gives a summary. Like for LinearCode or the soon-to-come GRS codes.

Best,
Johan

Got it! Change done.

Ok. I added a `.. NOTE` block to explain this. And suggested to use `EncodingError` if one tries to encode a word which is not in the message space.

Agreed. I changed the doc.

For comment 26, as keeping the "the" is not convention in Sage and as I stick to the Sage's way of doing things, I deleted it. 

Best,

David

There seems to be issues with other parts of linear code functionality for dimension 0, btw:

```
    sage: M = Matrix(GF(2), 0, 5, [])
    sage: C = LinearCode(M)
    sage: C.random_element()

I did that because as far as I tested it, in Sage a vector space of dimension 0 contains only the empty vector `()` which is I think not correct mathematically speaking (it should contain the zero vector).

So instead of wondering if I should return the zero of the message space or the empty vector, the former being the right mathematical answer, the latter the Sage answer, I chose to return an exception. 

Note that before unencoding over a code of dimension 0 "returned'

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: unable to find a common ring for all elements
```

I'm not strongly for this solution, so if you prefer to return either `()` or `0` I'm fine with that.
But returning 0, while being the expected mathematical answer, comes back to returning something which is *not* an element of the message space - according to the Sage representation of vector spaces of dimension 0.

I think Sage's answer is correct. Your example on bitbucket is a zero *length* (and dimension) vector space. The "zero vector" in that space is the empty vector.

Constructing one with only zero dimension correctly shows you the zero word:

```
   sage: V = Matrix(GF(2), 0, 5).row_module()
   sage: V.list()
   [(0,0,0,0,0)]
```

I think that unencoding the zero vector on a zero dimensional code should return the empty vector. That seems the only sensible thing.

I guess the failure with `C.list()` crashing (and possibly other stuff, like minimum distance) is another one for the pile of stuff to fix later on...

Ok, things are looking pretty good. I had a look at your corrections after my last review.

- Why is `LinearCodeGeneratorMatrixEncoder` registered on `AbstractLinearCode` and not `LinearCode`?

- `encoder.py`: instanciated -> instantiated

- `codes.encoders` now contains `lazy_import`. Should be hidden

- `AbstractLinearCode` class doc: `__cmp` --> `__cmp__`. Should this and `eq` have `:meth:`-tags on them?

- `AbstractLinearCode` class doc warning: perhaps "and `F` its base ring" should be "and `F` is the base field of the code".

- `encoder.encode` doc: the newly added "`encode` is a partial function ..." should perhaps be made slightly less strong to not confuse readers: "`encode` might be a partial function ...". Many encoders are going to be complete.

Best,
Johan

> Why is `LinearCodeGeneratorMatrixEncoder` registered on `AbstractLinearCode` and not `LinearCode`? 

My mistake; fixed.

>` encoder.py`: instanciated -> instantiated 

Fixed.

> `codes.encoders` now contains `lazy_import`. Should be hidden 

Done.

> `AbstractLinearCode` class doc warning: perhaps "and `F` its base ring" should be "and `F` is the base field of the code". 

Yes, it's less confusing like that. Done.

> `encoder.encode` doc: the newly added "`encode` is a partial function ..." should perhaps be made slightly less strong to not confuse readers: "`encode` might be a partial function ...". Many encoders are going to be complete. 

That's right. Changed it.
