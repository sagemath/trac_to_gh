The stand-alone function {{{refine_embedding}} has been around for a while, right at the bottom of sage/rings/number_field/number_field.py, not imported into the global namespace and hence having to be imported whenever needed.  More seriously, it is very easy for users and developers to miss its existence entirely!  (Proof:  today I learned that one of my students needed such a function and wrote his own since he did not know that I had written the existing function a few years ago!)

I am moving the function into the class NumberField, so that one can now say

```
embx = K.refine_embedding(emb, prec)
```
instead of

```
from sage.rings.number_field.number_field import refine_embedding
embx = refine_embedding(emb,prec)
```

There are only about 3 places in the Sage library where this is used, which need small changes.

Hello John,

- Could you be more uniform in notations: you wrote `RR` and `CC` but ```AA``` and ```QQbar```.

- `if not self is e.domain()` -> `if self is not e.domain()`

- it is crazy that this function needs to compute **all** embeddings to refine **one**!! (might be for another ticket)

- This is very obfuscated

```
        diffs = [(RC(ee(self.gen()))-old_root).abs() for ee in elist]
        return elist[min(izip(diffs,count()))[1]]
```
  Could you make it more readable like

```
   diff_min = Infinity
   ans = None
   for ee in elist:
       diff = (RC(ee(self.gen())) - old_root).abs()
       if diff < diff_min:
           ans = ee
           diff_min = diff
   return ans
```

I did what was asked for (almost) and rebased onto 6.8.beta7.   There does not seem to be a way to ask for one root in a field close to a given approximation, so it still finds all roots in the higher precision field -- but only the roots, it does not contruct all teh associated embeddings, just the closest one.  I think the code is less obfuscated now too.

I have not been able to track this down, so I have not set the ticket to "needs review" as I know that these tests fail, but I am guessing that I have somehow stumbled across a bug which has nothing to do with this ticket.  Help appreciated!

The fact that `_value` becomes a *real* interval element is probably due to this implementation (line 7431 of `sage/rings/qqbar.py`)

```
    def _interval_fast(self, prec):
        gen_val = self._generator._interval_fast(prec)
        v = self._value.polynomial()(gen_val)
        if self._exactly_real and is_ComplexIntervalFieldElement(v):
            return v.real()
        return v
```
It could well be that this is really the intention (and there could be other places where the interval is set to be a real thing!), in which case the bug is indeed in `sqrt`, which should avoid relying on "argument" being available.

Looking at it a little bit more, I think the error is in fact in `__pow__` (sage/rings/qqbar.py:4233). I expect it's  not invalid for `_value` to be a RIF element. That seems to happen quite a bit:

```
sage: type(QQbar(5)._value)
<type 'sage.rings.real_mpfi.RealIntervalFieldElement'>
```
It's just that elements where that happens are usually filtered out earlier. So in this case, `d` isn't recognized as a rational number yet when we enter, but then in the for loop on line 4304, we have that on line 4322 we execute:

```
               val = self._interval_fast(prec)
```
So actually, on the first pass `val` is a CIF element. We apparently get an error on the second pass, when `val` has been forced through `_interval_fast`.

So I see two solutions: either ensure that val is put back into CIF or ensure that "argument extraction" is done appropriately in cases where "val" is in RIF.

Hello,

I followed the comment from #18333. It would actually make sense for elements in `QQbar` to **always** have their intervals being in some complex interval field. Since the zero is exact in interval arithmetic we can check if the number is real with

```
sage: a = CIF(5)
sage: a.imag().is_zero()
True
```

Though there is a lot of code shared between `AA` and `QQbar` and the change might be less trivial than it seems.

Vincent

I am about to see if the fix at #20064 deals with the remaining issues.

It does, and now has a positive review, so I will set that as a dependency of this and ask for another review of this one.

Are those failures the ones which are fixed by #20064?  Did you apply #20064 first -- it is merged but not yet in the latest beta, I think.

You are right, I thought #20064 was already merged, while it is not. Everything is fine now.

- The code is ok, I miss extending embeddings from number to p-adic fields, but this issue is out of scope for this ticket.

- Please document that precision cannot decrease.

```
sage: N=QQ[sqrt(2)]
sage: e=N.embeddings(RR)[0]
sage: N.refine_embedding(e,16) is e
True
sage: e
Ring morphism:
  From: Number Field in sqrt2 with defining polynomial x^2 - 2
  To:   Real Field with 53 bits of precision
  Defn: sqrt2 |--> -1.41421356237310
```

Also, it would be nice to note that, when the refinement is not unique, an "arbitrary" one is returned:

```
sage: N=NumberField(x^4 - 199999999/50000000*x^2 + 40000000400000001/10000000000000000,'a')
sage: e = N.embeddings(ComplexField(16))[1]
sage: e
Ring morphism:
  From: Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^4 - 199999999/50000000*x^2 + 40000000400000001/10000000000000000
  To:   Complex Field with 16 bits of precision
  Defn: a |--> 1.414
sage: N.refine_embedding(e,32)
