Since 6.8.beta1, some packages (among them "git2r" and, therefore, "devtools" that depends on it, no longer install.

Thses package seem to depend on Makevars ; "git2r" definitely depends on Makevars.

git bisect points to commit bb5c9f3a2d9a6edcffe787716faa91fa5fd4aed6, which is in #17572, as the source of the problem. Indeed : bb5c9f3a... is entitled "Do not let R use global or user-local Makevars".

I am afraid that this solution cannot be accepted : it breaks existing R packages, finctional in all "normal" R installations. Furthermore, it breaks a mechanism documented upstream as legitimate for future packages.

<div id="comment:3" align="right">comment:3</div>

The proposed patch is a "damage control" patch limiting the effect of #17572 to Darwin OS. Edit : the resultant Sage passes `ptestlong` with `"All tests passed !"`.

Rationale : the problem (mis-)fixed by #17572 seems to be limited to machines running clang. It seems, from reading pages pointed to in the discussion of this patch, that this happens on Mac OS X due to slightly suboptimal apple development software.

As already seen, this "solution" breaks the installation of several R packages, which explicitly check for systemwide `Makevars` or user-specific `Makevars.user` set by way of R_HOME and R_PROFILE environment variables.

Our current solution is to unset these variables and export the variables `R_MAKEVARS_SITE` and `R_MAKEVARS_SITE`, pointing to convenient Sage-specific versions of similarly named files. As far as I can tell, we do **not** have such files, which breaks the build of some R packages.

I do not have a Mac, and I do not use clang. Therefore, I'm ill-qualified to propose a solution. A **stopgap** could be to create such **empty** files at R installation, and keep the patch as it curently is.

However, I do not understand **why** clang breaks when the relevant variables are not defined, and why gcc breaks when they are defined as pointing to nonexistent files.

So we have a few courses of action :

1. keep #17572 as it is now, and add the creation of empty Makevars.site and Makevars.user somewhere at the end of the R installation script. Not that easy,..

2. Limit #17572 to Darwin machines (= current damage control patch) and find some apple-specific way to fix the problem of non-installing R packages.

3. Revert #17572 entierely and find some other way to induce clang that it can in fact run without these environment variables.

In any case, fixing this one needs the expertise of someone having access to a clang-plagued Mac OS X machine. I can't test a solution of this combination.

I put this "damage control" patch as `needs_review`. Feel free to pull it back to `needs_work` if you have some proposal to implement solutions 1 or 3. Or something else entirely...

I think we need to be more careful there. #17572 is caused by interference with another `R` install on the system. Whether there is breakage or not that is a problem. You don't usually see it on non-apple because your system variable and sage variables are likely to be similar. But it also means that you will share the installed package between your `R` install outside of sage and the one installed in sage.

That is not sane. 

I think we would be better served by defining `R_HOME` in the sage environment rather than bluntly unseting it. I unfortunately do not keep crap in `/usr/local` on my apple machine (I know better, and so should a lot of people) so meaningful testing is hard for me.

```

Second proposal :

* Do not make Darwin a special case.
* Create Sage-specific Makevars files if necessary.

The site-wide Makevars file goes into the `$SAGE_LOCAL` tree, the user-specific file in his/her/its `$DOT_SAGE` tree.

This is done in the `sage-env` script (in order to check this at each and every Sage use, and avoid damaging a file created only at installation time.

This works for me (C)(R)(TM)... This patch needs attention of Apple users ! ==> `needs_review`.

As is it should work but the creation of the file `$R_MAKEVARS_SITE` is unnecessary as `R` checks that it exist (from `SAGE_LOCAL/lib/R/bin/config`)

```
if test "${site}" = "yes"; then
: ${R_MAKEVARS_SITE="${R_HOME}/etc${R_ARCH}/Makevars.site"}
  if test -f "${R_MAKEVARS_SITE}"; then
    makefiles="${makefiles} -f ${R_MAKEVARS_SITE}"
  fi
fi
```
The existence of `$R_MAKEVARS_USER` however is not tested, only that the variable is not empty, so populating it when we define it is a really good idea. 

On a separate remark on style you should quote both ` R_MAKEVARS_SITE` and `R_MAKEVARS_USER` as they are paths that can potentially contain spaces.

Fran√ßois,

Good catch for the need to quote paths. I have been Windows-weaned too long ago to really think about these follies...

Skipping the site variable : I'm not so sure : the R statrup code is a bit of a fisherman's net, and I am not sure that an R package (for example) does not use it cavalierly in a situation where it does not exists. So my paranoid version takes care of that.

Would you care to formally review this ?

`-a` is **intentional** : either Makevar file could be a symlink to a machine- or project-specific Makevar file, and Sage should respect this if it has been so positioned by the user.

> And if the file does not exist, using `>>` (for append) looks strange, better use `>`.

That's nitpicking. But so be it (commit under way)...

If you think that `-f` will not work with symlinks, you are mistaken. Being a file and being a symlink are independent. In particular, a symlink to an existing file is considered to be both a file and a symlink.

You really want to use `-f` here, since `-a` will match directories (and other weird things like devices,...) and you don't want that. Moreover, `-f` is more portable than `-a`.

Fortran *significantly* complicates things for R: it needs to link together C and Fortran code and that only works if the C and Fortran compilers are sufficiently compatible.

Nice idea ... provided that this doesn't generate a drift from "standalone R". Apple-specific difficulties with Fortran are bad enough, we don't want to find ourselves maintaining a semi-clandestine fork...

Starting with a clean install of Sage, this leads to an error message at the start of building (as soon as `sage-env` is run):

```
$ make
mkdir -p logs
cd build && \
	"../build/pipestatus" \
		"./install all 2>&1" \
		"tee -a ../logs/install.log"
/Users/palmieri/sage-6.8.beta6/src/bin/sage-env: line 434: /Users/palmieri/sage-6.8.beta6/local/lib/R/share/Makevars.site: No such file or directory
```
This is because the directory `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib/R/share/` does not yet exist, so the redirection 

```
echo "## Empty site-wide Makevars file for Sage's R" > "$R_MAKEVARS_SITE"
```
fails. The build continues anyway, and I guess the file should be created when Sage is next run, but would it be better to create this file when installing `R` (that is, in `build/pkgs/r/spkg-install`)? Or at least to check if the directory exists before trying to create the file, to avoid a needless error message?

I should have flat refused the definition of `R_MAKEVARS_SITE` the default is just fine, we should have unset any definition from the environment so it doesn't pollute the sage one. I have seen the message too, not hurting the build but not a nice artefact.
