Probably all three. In any case, the code is more clear, the exception type (`TypeError` instead of `ValueError`) is surely better. The error message is less clear, but that's something which can be fixed independent of this ticket.

Well, most people who don't know programming would probably prefer the opposite.

Actually, upon reading the code I think that this is definitely a regression.  The only reason it complains about a string is because one doesn't do `var('q')`; surely there is a way to check whether the string `'q'` will be a variable in the given ring.  I agree that the way the original code was written is not optimal with such a default, but given that the documentation does directly refer to a parameter `q` (and `t`) this change is not good.  Surely there is some way to at least use

```
self.q = Sym.base_ring()(q)
```
or something like it to try to convert the string and then give a sensible error if it's not possible, since this is clearly how it's designed.  The new error message makes it sound like you aren't supposed to use a string, which is manifestly not the case - especially since the string is the *default*!

That said, I am happy with anything that raises an error that the user can actually understand, so I'm not suggesting one has to go back to the previous.  Perhaps

```
try:
    self.q, self.t do their thing
except TypeError:
    do something with SR.var
```
and then all other errors are as they should be, instead of raising the message error as previously.
