Probably all three. In any case, the code is more clear, the exception type (`TypeError` instead of `ValueError`) is surely better. The error message is less clear, but that's something which can be fixed independent of this ticket.

(As a personal pet peeve, I really dislike excessive exception raising code. Moreover, I prefer a good traceback over a good error message.)

Well, most people who don't know programming would probably prefer the opposite.

Actually, upon reading the code I think that this is definitely a regression.  The only reason it complains about a string is because one doesn't do `var('q')`; surely there is a way to check whether the string `'q'` will be a variable in the given ring.  I agree that the way the original code was written is not optimal with such a default, but given that the documentation does directly refer to a parameter `q` (and `t`) this change is not good.  Surely there is some way to at least use

```
self.q = Sym.base_ring()(q)
```
or something like it to try to convert the string and then give a sensible error if it's not possible, since this is clearly how it's designed.  The new error message makes it sound like you aren't supposed to use a string, which is manifestly not the case - especially since the string is the *default*!

That said, I am happy with anything that raises an error that the user can actually understand, so I'm not suggesting one has to go back to the previous.  Perhaps

```
try:
    self.q, self.t do their thing
except TypeError:
    do something with SR.var
```
and then all other errors are as they should be, instead of raising the message error as previously.
