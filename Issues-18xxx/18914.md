This code demonstrates the bug on SMC:

```
G = digraphs.ButterflyGraph(1)
G.set_latex_options( edge_fills=True, edge_color='white' )
_=latex.eval(latex(G))
```

(tested on SMC just now).  It draws the arcs correctly, as black with a white border, but the arrowheads appear to be entirely white, and visible only as little white nicks in the vertices.
