2) The algorithm will loop indefinitely if self is empty, so it now raises an error if your input has a combination of k,n,and strict that will yield no Gelfand-Tsetlin patterns (k<0 if not strict, k+1<n if strict).

3) random_element() now returns a 'Gelfand-Tsetlin pattern' (in the sage data type sense), rather than just the underlying list of lists.

I'm ok with a positive review, pending you checking my modifications.

Your code and documentation looks great, an improvement, and still generates uniformly.
