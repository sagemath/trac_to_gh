Summary of sandpile.py changes from version 2.3 to 2.4
June 11, 2015

1. Eliminated dependence on 4ti2, substituting the use of Polyhedron methods.  Thus, no optional packages are necessary.
2. Fixed bug in Sandpile.__init__ so that now multigraphs are handled correctly.
3. Created `sandpiles` to handle examples of Sandpiles in analogy with `graphs`, `simplicial_complexes`, and `polytopes`.  In the process, we implemented a much faster way of producing the sandpile grid graph.
4. Added support for open and closed sandpile Markov chains.
5. Added support for Weierstrass points.
6. Implemented the Cori-Le Borgne algorithm for computing ranks of divisors on complete graphs.

+Summary of sandpile.py changes from version 2.3 to 2.4
+June 11, 2015
 
+1. Eliminated dependence on 4ti2, substituing the use of Polyhedron methods.  Thus, no optional packages are necessary.
+2. Fixed bug in Sandpile.__init__ so that now multigraphs are handled correctly.
+3. Created `sandpiles` to handle examples of Sandpiles in analogy with `graphs`, `simplicial_complexes`, and `polytopes`.  In the process, we implemented a much faster way of producing the sandpile grid graph.
+4. Added support for open and closed sandpile Markov chains.
+5. Added support for Weierstrass points.
+6. Implemented the Cori-Le Borgne algorithm for computing ranks of divisors on complete graphs.
+
+NEW METHODS
+Sandpile
+* avalanche_polynomial      -- the avalance polynomial
+* genus                     -- genus of the sandpile graph (undirected case only)
+* group_gens                -- minimal set of generators for the sandpile group
+* help                      -- list of Sandpile-specific methods
+* jacobian_representatives  -- representatives for elements of the Jacobian group
+* markov_chain              -- open and closed sandpile Markov chain
+* picard_representatives    -- representatives for elements of the Picard group
+* smith_form                -- Smith normal from for transpose of the Laplacian
+* stable_configs            -- iterator for all stable configurations
+* stationary_density        -- the stationary density for the closed sandpile Markov chain
+* tutte_polynomial          -- Tutte polynomial of underlying graph (undirected case only)
+
+SandpileConfig 
+* burst_size                -- statistic for sandpile Markov chain
+* help                      -- list of SandpileConfig methods
+
+SandpileDivisor 
+* help                      -- list of SandpileDivisor methods
+* is_linearly_equivalent    -- Is the divisor linearly equivalent to a given divisor?
+* is_q_reduced              -- Is the divisor q-reduced (q=sink)
+* is_weierstrass_pt         -- Is the given vertex a Weierstrass pt for the divisor?
+* polytope                  -- polytope determining the complete linear system
+* polytope_integer_pts      -- integer points inside the divisor's polytope
+* q_reduced                 -- linearly equiv. q-reduced divisor
+* rank                      -- the rank of the divisor
+* simulate_threshold        -- simulate closed sandpile Markov chain until threshold
+* stabilize                 -- stabilize, if possible
+* weierstrass_gap_seq       -- the Weierstrass gap sequence for the given vertex
+* weierstrass_pts           -- all Weierstrass points (vertices) for the divisor
+* weierstrass_rank_seq      -- the rank sequence at a Weierstrass point
+
+DEPRECATED
+* SandpileDivisor.linear_system -- uses 4ti2.  Replaced by SandpileDivisor.polytope.
+* SandpileDivisor.r_of_D -- uses 4ti2.  Replaced by SandpileDivisor.rank.
+* sandlib method -- replaced by `sandpiles`
+* complete_sandpile -- replaced by sandpiles.Complete
+* grid_sandpile -- replaced by sandpiles.Grid
+* triangle_sandpile -- Not used much.  Will still be able to import.

+* min_cycles -- Not used much.  Will still be able to import.
+
+MINOR CHANGES
+* The `sink` argument to Sandpile.__init__ now defaults to the first vertex.
+* A SandpileConfig or SandpileDivisor may now be multiplied by an integer.
+* Sped up `__add__` method for SandpileConfig and SandpileDivisor.
+* Enhanced string representation of a Sandpile (via `_repr_` and the `name` method).
+* Recurrents for complete graphs and cycle graphs are computed more quickly.
+* The stabilization code for SandpilConfig has been made more efficient.
+* Added optional probability distribution arguments to `add_random` methods.

Some quick comments:

- You don't need `INPUT:` and `OUTPUT:` blocks if there is no input or output.
- You should format the `INPUT:` blocks like this:

```
INPUT:

- ``foo`` -- the bar
- ``param`` -- (default: 5) an integer we do something with that is typically
  the value 5, mainly I'm blabbing on to make this a longer line
- ``opt`` -- (optional) some optional argument
```
- Make classes "new-style" `class Foo(object):`.
- You should find a way to automize the `help()` method. It can be very painful to manage this by hand.
- For notes, you can use

```
.. NOTE::

    This is a note. Everything should be one level further indented than before.
```
- Similar for `.. WARNING::`
- You can't duplicate references. Instead reference them by `[NameOfReference]_`.
- The patchbot's error is saying the documentation doesn't build; in particular there is an indentation either needed or missing from somewhere.

I have just pushed changes in response to the (very helpful) comments above. The INPUT sections of the docstrings are all standardized now, as are the NOTE, WARNING, etc., sections.  ``SandpileExamples`` has the "new-class" style.  The help functions are now automated rather than hard-wired, as advised.

Should I remove every instance of INPUT for which there is no input (None) and, separately, every instance of OUTPUT for which there is no output (None)?  The documentation for developers at sagemath.org states that every function must have an INPUT and OUTPUT statement, and further that this "is not optional".

At any rate, for this new version, with my local version of Sage, all tests passed for "sage -t", and the html and pdf documentation built without problems.

Looks good. This could potentially be used as a model for other parts of Sage.

However there is currently a merge conflict with the latest beta. So you'll need to rebase it.

Just to be completely clear: suppose, for example, that I have a docstring with None listed under INPUT and integer listed under OUTPUT.  Then I should remove the INPUT section, leaving the OUTPUT section, right?

I am new to git, so I could use some guidance here.  I have been working in a directory called git-trac-command.  The output from "git branch" shows two branches: ``master`` and ``t/18618/sandpile_revisions``, with an asterisk next to the latter.  After my initial git push command, I have modified files in another, separate, copy of sage.  When I done making and testing the revisions, I copy the relevant modified files (sandpile.py, examples.py, etc.) to git-trac-command/src/sage/sandpiles.  I then run ``./sage -br``, ``git add NEW FILES``, ``git commit``, and ``git trac push``.

What is the sequence of commands I should enter to resolve the current conflict?  Also, what should I have done originally to have avoided the conflict?

Thanks very much for your time and advice!

What you'll need to do is the following:

```
$ git fetch <remote_name> develop:develop
$ git checkout t/18618/sandpile_revisions     # If you aren't already in that branch
$ git merge develop

    Do the rebasing

$ git commit
$ make           # In the $SAGE_ROOT directory. This will take a *long* time
$ git trac push
```
where `<remote_name>` is likely `origin` (possibly `trac`).

For rebuilding Sage with the `make`, you might want to do these beforehand to help speed it up:

```
$ make doc-clean
$ export SAGE_NUM_THREADS=n
$ export MAKE='make -jn'
$ export SAGE_PARALLEL_SPKG_BUILD
```
where `n` is the number of processors on your computer. If it happens to fail during the doc-building part at the end, don't worry about it.

Running "git merge develop" leads to the error:

Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.

The output from "git branch" shows two branches: ``master`` and ``t/18618/sandpile_revisions``, with an asterisk next to the latter.  After my initial git push command, I have modified files in another, separate, copy of sage.  When I done making and testing the revisions, I copy the relevant modified files (sandpile.py, examples.py, etc.) to git-trac-command/src/sage/sandpiles.  I then run ``./sage -br``, ``git add NEW FILES``, ``git commit``, and ``git trac push``.

for some reason I have the following conflict when I try to merge the changes into Sage 6.8.beta8:

```
<<<<<<< HEAD
            processed_g = {}
            for k in g.keys():
                temp = {}
                for vertex in g[k]:
                    temp[vertex] = 1
                processed_g[k] = temp
            g = processed_g
        elif isinstance(g, Graph):
            processed_g = {}
            for v in g.vertices():
                edges = {}
                for n in g.neighbors(v):
                    if (isinstance(g.edge_label(v,n), int)
                            and g.edge_label(v,n) >= 0):
                        edges[n] = g.edge_label(v,n)
                    else:
                        edges[n] = 1
                processed_g[v] = edges
            g = processed_g
        elif isinstance(g, DiGraph):
            processed_g = {}
            for v in g.vertices():
                edges = {}
                for n in g.neighbors_out(v):
                    if (isinstance(g.edge_label(v,n), int)
                            and g.edge_label(v,n) >= 0):
                        edges[n] = g.edge_label(v,n)
                    else:
                        edges[n] = 1
                processed_g[v] = edges
=======
            processed_g = {i:dict(Counter(g[i])) for i in g}
>>>>>>> trac/u/dperkinson/sandpile_revisions
```

in `src/sage/sandpiles/sandpile.py`; i.e. you want to replace everything between `<<<<< HEAD` and `========`
with the stuff after `======`. Is this correct? 

(It would be great if you do the rebase yourself, but if you don't know how, please say so).

Yes, I could use some help with rebasing.  First, could you please explain why rebasing has become necessary (so that I can understand better what is going on)?  Next, I actually did manage to rebase once earlier.  At that time, I was told to issue the following commands:

 $ git fetch trac develop:develop
 $ git checkout t/18618/sandpile_revisions     # If you aren't already in
 that branch
 $ git merge develop
 $ git commit
 $ make
 $ git trac push

I remember running into complications but foolishly did not record how things were resolved.  My first questions:

1. Just to be sure, I should issue these commands from my git-trac-command directory (from where I have been pushing all of my changes).  Is that right?

2. After issuing the 'git merge develop' command, I get the following error message:
  
---
error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by merge:
	src/sage/sandpiles/sandpile.py
Please, commit your changes or stash them before you can merge.
Aborting

---
Does this mean I should add my sandpile changes and commit before entering 'git merge develop'?

Thanks very much for any help!

No, git-trac-command has nothing to do with this, expect that the last command, `git trac push`, uses functionality enabled
by `git trac` extension to `git`. But this is totally orthogonal to doing development in git-trac-command directory, which should just host a reasonably updated version of `git trac`, but nothing else (and you might need to add it to your PATH, as described in `git trac` docs, but again this has nothing to do with issuing commands from there...).
You certainly should not do your sandpiles development in this directory.
In fact, your development should just overwrite Sage (beta) release number whatever...

yes, this might be a symptom of keeping updated files in a wrong place.

Well, certainly you need to commit your local changes before you can do any git processing on them, 
but now I can only guess what exactly is happening with your directories.
Do you even have a Sage source tree in the directory you issue your git commands from?!

Did you start your revision work from some Sage version under (git) revision control, or from your own private version, without any
git repo?

Ah, I see you took 

```
[user@localhost]$ echo $PATH
/home/user/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin
[user@localhost]$ cd git-trac-command
[user@localhost git-trac-command]$ ln -s `pwd`/git-trac ~/bin/
```
as an instruction to do everything in this directory... But it is only meant to tell you how to set up your `git trac` workflow; once you are done with the latter, you have to go somewhere you want your Sage files to do `git clone`.

But surely you should not keep your Sage code there. My brain aches when I try to think what happens if you clone one git repo in the same place as your another repo...

OK, I'll add a line in the manual explaining this.

From what I see from git logs, you started off from Sage 6.8.beta3, and then rebased over beta4 for some reason I don't get - nobody changed any files you touched...

OK, It's getting late here in Oxford, I'll resume tomorrow.

As it is longer to explain how to proceed than to do it myself, I record steps I undertake;
please feel free to ask for explanation.
Start by cloning a clean Sage 6.8.beta8 (described in the manual). Go to its root, and do

```
$ git fetch trac u/dperkinson/sandpile_revisions
From trac.sagemath.org:sage
 * branch            u/dperkinson/sandpile_revisions -> FETCH_HEAD
clpc171[/home/scratch/dimpase/sage/tmp]$ git merge FETCH_HEAD
Auto-merging src/sage/sandpiles/sandpile.py
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in src/sage/sandpiles/sandpile.py
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
clpc171[/home/scratch/dimpase/sage/tmp]$ git status
On branch newsp
You have unmerged paths.
  (fix conflicts and run "git commit")

Changes to be committed:

	modified:   src/doc/en/thematic_tutorials/sandpile.rst
	modified:   src/sage/sandpiles/all.py
	new file:   src/sage/sandpiles/examples.py

Unmerged paths:
  (use "git add <file>..." to mark resolution)

	both modified:   src/sage/sandpiles/sandpile.py
```

ok, so we need to sort out the conflict (cf. e.g. https://help.github.com/articles/resolving-a-merge-conflict-from-the-command-line/)

serach for `HEAD` in the output of the following:

```

here (look at its date!) is the commit that prevents a clean merge:

```
commit e82c8f99d6493f48d3a02c598fc723e693f5616f
Author: Jeroen Demeyer <jdemeyer@cage.ugent.be>
Date:   Mon Jun 29 11:01:23 2015 +0200

    Fix suspicious isinstance() changes
```
as it changes stuff in a place that has to be removed, we can basically ignore it.
(that is, when rebasing, the corresponding chunk can just be removed).


Now open `src/sage/sandpiles/sandpile.py` in an editor and remove the lines between `<<<..< HEAD` and `====`, 
as well as the lines with `<<<..< HEAD`, `====`, and `>>>>>>> FETCH_HEAD`. Now we can commit our changes.

```
$ git add src/sage/sandpiles/sandpile.py
$ git commit -m "rebased over that e82c8f99d6493f48d3a02c598fc723e693f5616f"
```
Now locally everything is OK, run tests, etc...
Finally, I push it to trac (not using `git trac`, but rather "git the hard way" :-))

```
$ git push trac --set-upstream HEAD:public/sandpile_updates
```
and in the browser replace your (broken, shown in red) Branch: `u/dperkinson/sandpile_revisions` with `public/sandpile_updates`. And click Submit. (your branch is still there on the server, by the way, and your commits are in the new branch (click on `commits` to see this)).

Wow.  That's pretty complicated.  Thanks for your help.

Just to make sure: if I am understanding correctly, you have just done everything that needs to be done for the moment.  In other words, the rebasing is done, right?

In case further revisions are necessary, would it make sense for me now to start from a clean slate on my local machine, following the directions on the git-trac page (making sure to clone into a separate clean directory)?  

Thanks again.

no, not really. Git is just an interface to a directed acyclic graph on changes to files :-)

Also, `git blame` part is entirely optional. Them there isn't much beyond the standard merge conflict
resolution, as explained in https://help.github.com/articles/resolving-a-merge-conflict-from-the-command-line/

right. 

> In case further revisions are necessary, would it make sense for me now to start from a clean slate on my local machine, following the directions on the git-trac page (making sure to clone into a separate clean directory)?  

You could try just fetching the new branch `public/sandpile_updates` from trac and merging it over your current working setup (beforehand you have to commit or stash all your changes, as always).
More precisely, first create a new branch (to have a way to refer to the new branch of your code DAG to be grown), 
by `git checkout -b Foo`
Then do `git fetch trac public/sandpile_updates` followed by `git merge FETCH_HEAD`.

If this works then you are all set to do extra changes, which you would commit (into Foo branch) and then do
`git push trac --set-upstream HEAD:public/sandpile_updates` to update the remote branch.

PS. I seldom use `git-trac` extension nowadays, it's too inflexible for me.

It is used in one doctest only, and it can be replaced easily by `digraphs.TransitiveTournament(20)` if needed.
