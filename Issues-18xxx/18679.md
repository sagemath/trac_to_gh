This ticket would be for the deprecation of the `maximization` parameter within the `NormalFormGame` class which is used be various functions when computing the Nash equilibrium. Some of the reasons include:

1. Finding a Nash with `maximization=False` is equivalent to solving an instance with negative payoffs. So in the two player instance, one might as well create an instance of (-A, -B) that way, creating the same instances over and over when you want to compute equilibria using different algorithms.
2. Technically, the game being represented isn't the game being solved. As a result, any further manipulations or computations which would need to be done on that instance, we would have to create the bimatrix (-A, -B) again.
3. For n-players, this gets a little bit messier, as we would have to enumerate the exponentially large number of payoffs in the game so as to negate all of them.

Depends on #18536
