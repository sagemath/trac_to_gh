While your patch apparently fixes the issue *with uppercase letters* in upstream tarballs (haven't tested it yet though), I don't like the concept of the script, which is pretty upside-down:  Instead of iterating over `build/pkgs/*` and taking the name of the upstream tarball from there, it does the opposite.

I'd rather have

  `sage-pkg-checksums [--verbose] [--create|--check|--update] [<package name>]*`

with useful information about missing upstream tarballs, checksum mismatches etc., but that's presumably beyond this ticket.

(And we have a wild mixture of `tr`, `sed`, `shopt -s nocaseglob`, and shell parameter expansion in various shell scripts...  The Python script `sage-pkg` also seems to be obsolete or at least not yet suited for "new style" spkgs.)

P.S.:  How am I supposed to call that script btw.?  It relies on `SAGE_ROOT` being set, and doesn't even check whether that's the case.

`./sage -fix-pkg-checksums` doesn't work (and isn't documented), so one has to enter a Sage subshell or, as I did, for example run

```sh
SAGE_ROOT=. src/bin/sage-fix-pkg-checksums
```

`./sage --sh -c sage-fix-pkg-checksums` isn't less cryptic or tedious either.

```sh
if [ -z "$SAGE_ROOT" ]; then
    if [ -d upstream ]; then # probably add further sanity checks

    else

Otherwise the script does nothing and exits without an error, even when we're in the Sage root directory but `SAGE_ROOT` isn't set (just because `[ -d /build/pkgs/... ]` usually yields `false`).

The developer's guide says to do

```
$ sage -sh sage-fix-pkg-checksums
```
Anyway, feel free to open another ticket with general cleanup of the script.

Do I need to explain that, presumably, someone developing a new package for Sage will try to build Sage with that package? That was the context for my comment: I want to provide some feedback when they are still developing the package (and therefore running `sage-fix-pkg-checksums`), before they even get to the building/testing stage. And there may be developers who never use OS X and are unaware of how it treats case.
