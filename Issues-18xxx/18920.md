spkg-src is outdated anyway.

No, I mean that it is silly and error-prone to rebase by hand patches that are better obtained directly from diffs to output of autoconf/automake/aclocal.

The latter should not be bundled together with the "real" one.

We rewrite `li[n](` to `polylog(n,` and the same for `psi[n](` to `psi(n,`. This string matching obviously completely breaks if maxima starts spelling this as `(li[n])(x)`. Quite frankly, that's an insane spelling, so perhaps the preferred approach is to clarify with the maxima folks if they really intend this. It might be an unforeseen byproduct of some other change that they prefer to fix themselves, in which case we shouldn't waste time.\n\nIf they insist this is a reasonable spelling, I think we can work around it, but it'll be a bit of real work. Note that we can handle calls to parenthesized functions:\n\n```\nsage: from sage.calculus.calculus import symbolic_expression_from_maxima_string as sefms\nsage: sefms('(sin)(x)')\nsin(x)\n```\nso as long as we ensure that expressions like `li[n]` and `psi[n]` themselves get parsed to callable functions, we should be OK.

No, it is not very easy to fix. We rewrite `li[n](` to `polylog(n,` and the same for `psi[n](` to `psi(n,`. This string matching obviously completely breaks if maxima starts spelling this as `(li[n])(x)`. Quite frankly, that's an insane spelling, so perhaps the preferred approach is to clarify with the maxima folks if they really intend this. It might be an unforeseen byproduct of some other change that they prefer to fix themselves, in which case we shouldn't waste time.

If they insist this is a reasonable spelling, I think we can work around it, but it'll be a bit of real work. Note that we can handle calls to parenthesized functions:

```
sage: from sage.calculus.calculus import symbolic_expression_from_maxima_string as sefms
sage: sefms('(sin)(x)')
sin(x)
```
so as long as we ensure that expressions like `li[n]` and `psi[n]` themselves get parsed to callable functions, we should be OK. Something like this would be OK:

```
sage: sefms('li[n]')
curried_polylog(n)
sage: sefms('li[n]')(x)
polylog(n,x)
sage: sefms('(li[n])(x)')
polylog(n,x)
```
Since we cannot really handle square brackets, we'd need to do the `li[n]`->`curried_polylog(n)` via a string substitution, but that should be OK. The `curried_polylog(n)` would just create a symbolic function that, when called with a single argument, would create the appropriate polylog.

The binary conversion `sr_to_max` in `maxima_lib.py`  shouldn't be affected, unless they have changed their internal representation of polylogarithms.

In terms of total amount of work, I would think introducing "curried" poylog and psi will be less work than eliminating any dependence on string parsing from maxima.

For calculus use, we're already moved entirely to maxima_lib. The library instance just allows two interfaces back and forth: a strings-based one and the binary `sr_to_max` and `max_to_sr` one.
Moving calculus entirely to `sr_to_max` is a nice idea in general, and that's a worthwhile project that should be quite doable (we're halfway there already and it didn't take much work to do that).
It would mean identifying all remaining places where calculus triggers string conversions and replace those sites with mechanisms comparable to sr_integral, sr_limit, sr_sum etc.

I think it's worthwhile if somehow we do maintain the pexpect interface to maxima as well, even if we don't need it for the calculus functionality in sage proper (and since the strings-based interface in maxima_lib shares nearly all its code with that, we might as well keep that too). Having the pexpect interfaces in sage is a useful feature for communicating with other computer algebra systems.

I'd rather see this fixed im maxima, of course, but this is probably a nontrivial job for a Lisp hacker we don't have...

<a id='comment:40'></a>I tried upgrading to Maxima 5.37.0 (released 17 August).  The formatting problem is fixed, although some of the output still looks slightly different (more/fewer parentheses, different ordering of terms in some polynomials).

However, there is a serious bug in the function `eigenvectors` causing too few eigenvectors to be returned:

```
(%i1) M: matrix([1, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 2]);
                                  [ 1  1  0 ]
                                  [         ]
(%o1)                             [ 0  1  0 ]
                                  [         ]
                                  [ 0  0  2 ]
```
Maxima 5.35.1 computes the eigenvalues and eigenvectors correctly:

```
(%i2) eigenvectors(M);
(%o2)           [[[1, 2], [2, 1]], [[[1, 0, 0]], [[0, 0, 1]]]]
```
In Maxima 5.37.0, the eigenvector `[0, 0, 1]` is missing:

```
(%i2) eigenvectors(M);
(%o2)                  [[[1, 2], [2, 1]], [[[1, 0, 0]]]]
```
I found this out through several doctest failures in Sage.

there `f` is defined as `f=maxima(`1/x^2`)`, so this no longer works, defining maxima
functions this way.

Anyhow, I'm pushing the other doctest changes for this file, and few other.

Robert Dodier has traced this down to a problem with ECL, see
https://gitlab.com/embeddable-common-lisp/ecl/issues/299

ECL has a problem comparing their own (there is no Common Lisp standard for this)

this workaround turned out to be buggy, and anyway ECL has released a fix for this problem, making the workaround not necessary. (But it would need an update of our ECL package, as it does depend upon a number of changes, see https://gitlab.com/embeddable-common-lisp/ecl/issues/299; they promise a new release by the end of the year). 

Should we wait, or should we proceed?

> Hi, we're following this ticket very closely in Debian. I notice that the following two patches are still applicable to 5.38.1:
> 
> * https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/tree/build/pkgs/maxima/patches/0001-taylor2-Avoid-blowing-the-stack-when-diff-expand-isn.patch


this one comes from upstream, from here: https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/bugs/2520/#e3a5
(so it's sort of unfinished digging on the maxima side; it's definitely useful outside of Sage)



> * https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/tree/build/pkgs/maxima/patches/matrixexp.patch
> 
 
this is also from upstream (updated somewhat):
https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/bugs/2596/

again, upstream still has it open.

<a id='comment:98'></a>here is a bad one - reproducible on two different systems;
I don't understand what's going on here; it appears that computing `g(x)`,
the Taylor expansion of `log(x)`, breaks `log(x)` plotting (in case the leftmost
interval point is 0).

Probably this initialises some symbolics, breaking handling of infinity in the
process...

Further entry point - the crash does not happen if I revert back to ECL 16.1.2.
(and keep new Maxima version).
That is, it seems that the call to `taylor` loads ecl+maxima, and sets up some stuff
that is responsible for handling infinities.

which I traced down to the call to `ldexp` at `sage/rings/rational.pyx:3799`.
Note that this is with `‚Äãac8348c	` commit already in (and so `ECL_OPT_TRAP_SIGFPE` = 0), so there is more of the same kind of story as above, but harder. I don't see what's going wrong here now.

This is a different to division by 0 kind of FPE, so this is perhaps the reason.

<a id='comment:8'></a>With this branch, the following remains to be fixed (or marked as known bugs):

1) this appears to be a Maxima regression [bug report](https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/bugs/3276/):

```
sage -t src/sage/symbolic/expression.pyx
******************************************************************
****
File "src/sage/symbolic/expression.pyx", line 10600, in sage.symbo
lic.expression.Expression.solve
Failed example:
    solve(Q*sqrt(Q^2 + 2) - 1, Q, to_poly_solve=True)
Expected:
    [Q == 1/sqrt(-sqrt(2) + 1), Q == 1/sqrt(sqrt(2) + 1)]
Got:
    [Q == -sqrt(-sqrt(2) - 1)]
```

2) this is weird (sage interface problem?) --- scratch this, it's a typo!

```
sage -t src/sage/interfaces/maxima.py
******************************************************************
****
File "src/sage/interfaces/maxima.py", line 210, in sage.interfaces
.maxima
Failed example:
    g.taylor('x', 0, 3)

Got:

**********************************************************************
```

3) this looks like a maxima regression [bug report](https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/bugs/3275/):

```
sage -t src/sage/calculus/tests.py
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/calculus/tests.py", line 107, in sage.calculus.tests
Failed example:
    integrate(log(1-x^2)/x, x)
Expected:

Got:
    log(-x)*log(x + 1) + log(x)*log(-x + 1) + dilog(x + 1) + dilog(-x + 1)
```

4) this is a known Maxima issue [bug report](https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/bugs/3237/):

```
sage -t src/sage/interfaces/maxima_lib.py
******************************************************************
****

<a id='comment:5'></a>On Debian testing (Core i7 + 16 GB Ram), on a branch where R 3.2.2 is merged with the latest released Sage, a parallel test (`MAKE="make -j8"`) gives :

4 of these five are transient, and pass when run sandalone.

This latter bug is known, not really a bug and has its own ticket.

Furthermore, Maxima 5.38.1 (Debian testing current version) fixes one of my pet peeves :

```
charpent@SAP5057241:~$ maxima

Maxima 5.38.1 http://maxima.sourceforge.net
using Lisp GNU Common Lisp (GCL) GCL 2.6.12

                                     +(('at('diff(f(x),x,1),x = x_0))
                                      *(x-x_0)^2)
                                      /2
```

Whereas Sage's Maxima gives :

```
charpent@SAP5057241:~$ sage -maxima

The function bug_report() provides bug reporting information.
(%i1) display2d:false;

(%i2) integrate(f(x),x);         

(%o2) 'integrate(f(x),x)
(%i3) taylor(integrate(f(x),x),x,x_0,2);

taylor: unable to expand at a point specified in:
'integrate(f(x),x)
 -- an error. To debug this try: debugmode(true);
```

So, we have :
* already known problems with parallel testing ;
* one already reported and ticketed test failure ;
* one not already reported problem, that continues the previous behaviour of Maxima-in-Sage, whereas this behavior has been fixed in 5.38.1.

None of these seem to impede giving this ticket a `positive_review`. Which I'd do unless you think that the behavior of the `taylor(integrate(...)...)` should/could be fixed with this issue.

However, I think the objection of Thierry Scrim (?) valid, and I think it is more important, since it points out a case where Maxima's answer is incomplete. Hence ==>`needs_work`.

Actually I believe Maxima is not to blame here, and in the bug report the dev says "not technically incorrect". See #17892 for our symbolic limit ticket.

I'd say, just add `makeinfo` to the list of pre-reqs.
It has been necessary to have it to build Maxima 
for years, see e.g. https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/bugs/2878/

It's just a lemma. Bear with me for a while... ]\n\nOur \"batteries included\" so-called philosophy has pushed us to include more and more software of peripheral interest at best up to the point where Sage is now a small-scale, highly specialized Linux distribution.\n\nThis distribution is of great interest to sage **builders** (i. e. potential developpers). It is at best an hindrance (read \"pain in the *ss\") to what should be one of our primary targets : the potential **users** of Sage. And no, this cannot be restricted to research mathematicians specializing in number theory...\n\nFor example, going to the pain to build our own GCC collection seems to me pushing consistency exigences a bit too far. Requiring from an //installer// (i. e. potential developper) to take the pain to install a matching set of decently recent compilers does not sound too much to me.\n\nCorollary : our **binary** tarballs/packages should be sound enough to satisfy the largest possible number of potential **users**. That means that our users should not be requested to install and manage a virtual machine setup, nor a complicated installation on \"exotic\" platforms. An undergraduate or even high school student, a practising engineer, etc... should be able to install a precompiled binary and go use Sage as he uses a word processor, without having to install a $#!+load of tools he/she'll never use for anything else.\n\nTherefore, if we need autotools to build Maxima, let's use existing autotools distributions, and do not try to avoid it. Or maintaining our own port. Maintaining our ports should be limited to the cases where there is a mathematical reason to do so.\n\n[ End of rant. Now for its consequences : ]\n\nTherefore, I think that wiggling away from one more tool to build Sage amounts to trying to alleviate the load of **developers**. Which is the wrong target.

Seconded, on basic principles :

[ The following rant is not gratuitous. It's just a lemma. Bear with me for a while... ]

Our "batteries included" so-called philosophy has pushed us to include more and more software of peripheral interest at best up to the point where Sage is now a small-scale, highly specialized Linux distribution.

This distribution is of great interest to sage **builders** (i. e. potential developpers). It is at best an hindrance (read "pain in the *ss") to what should be one of our primary targets : the potential **users** of Sage. And no, this cannot be restricted to research mathematicians specializing in number theory...

For example, going to the pain to build our own GCC collection seems to me pushing consistency exigences a bit too far. Requiring from an //installer// (i. e. potential developper) to take the pain to install a matching set of decently recent compilers does not sound too much to me.

Corollary : our **binary** tarballs/packages should be sound enough to satisfy the largest possible number of potential **users**. That means that our users should not be requested to install and manage a virtual machine setup, nor a complicated installation on "exotic" platforms. An undergraduate or even high school student, a practising engineer, etc... should be able to install a precompiled binary and go use Sage as he uses a word processor, without having to install a $#!+load of tools he/she'll never use for anything else.

Therefore, if we need autotools to build Maxima, let's use existing autotools distributions, and do not try to avoid it. Or maintaining our own port. Maintaining our ports should be limited to the cases where there is a mathematical reason to do so.

[ End of rant. Now for its consequences : ]

Therefore, I think that wiggling away from one more tool to build Sage amounts to trying to alleviate the load of **developers**. Which is the wrong target. Our primary goal should be to alleviate the load  imposed on **users**.

Those two sets were largely overlapping in the begionning of Sage, which as long been targeted on a certain research community. This is no longer the case. Sage now needs a lot of **users**, able to report problems, if we want to be able to fix them.

So, in the present case, if autotools is needed to build Maxima, let's depend on it **for building Sage**. But users of a binary distribution of Sage should not have to bother themselves with that.

In other (shorter) words : I'm not bothered by one more build dependency, if I can lighten the run dependencies... This seems the case here.

Corollary : the time spent on arguing and nitpicking over autotools would have been better spent helping Eric Bray's Cygwin port //cum// Windows installer, which opens us a quite large pool of potential users...

makeinfo is a very easy pre-req, as it is available on every system we build Sage on, and included in XCode too.

Users of binary distributions of Sage should still be able to install optional and experimental packages. Since there is no binary distribution of optional packages, build-time tools need to be included.

I would propose to add a standard package that includes (a current version of) texinfo (which provides makeinfo). Note that our autotools spkg packages only an ancient version of texinfo (4.13) (see #21196 for a discussion).
