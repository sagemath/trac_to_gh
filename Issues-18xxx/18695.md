```
While this works as expected:

```
sage: n = var('n')
sage: assume(n, 'integer')
sage: solve([n^2 == 3],n)
[]
```
this does not:

```
sage: forget()
sage: n = var('n', domain='integer')
sage: solve([n^2 == 3],n)
[n == -sqrt(3), n == sqrt(3)]
```
So, either `solve` should also look at the variable domain, or better, let's propagate domain settings to the assumption list.
Also:

```
sage: _ = var('n', domain='integer')
sage: n.is_integer()
False
```
Creating a non-complex var will invoke Maxima with this. I think this is acceptable for now. Alternatively, examine if assumptions can be done lazily, i.e., before any call to Maxima.
