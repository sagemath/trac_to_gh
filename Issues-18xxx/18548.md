```
Ticket #17792 implemented the solution for the word problem for congruence subgroups of (P)SL2(Z). However, the element represented by the output word sometimes differs from the original element by at most one generator.

Here is an example:

```
sage: G = Gamma0(10)
sage: F = G.farey_symbol()
sage: g = G([-701,-137,4600,899])
sage: word = F.word_problem(g, output = 'syllables')
sage: g1 = prod(F.generators()[i]**a for i,a in word)
sage: g == g1 or g * G([-1,0,0,-1]) == g1
False # Should be True
```

This ticket solves this. I have ran the code below to test:

```
for N in range(2,500):
    G = Gamma0(N)
    print "N = %s"%N
    gens = G.generators()
    F = G.farey_symbol()
    i = 0
    I = G([1,0,0,1])
    E = G([-1,0,0,-1])
    while i < 200:
        c = ZZ.random_element(1000)
        d = ZZ.random_element(1000)
        if gcd(c*N,d) > 1:
            continue
        i += 1
        _,a,b = xgcd(d,-c * N)
        g = G([a,b,c*N,d])
        wd = F.word_problem(g, output = 'syllables')
        g1 = prod(gens[j]**n for j,n in wd)
        assert g * g1**-1 ==  I or g * g1**-1 == E
```
(and also a modification to check Gamma_1(N).

PS: I also publicly apologise for being careless about this before. I did have code to fix this behaviour, but it was in an external sage script: this made the indirect tests pass.
