To improve support for PARI functions taking closures, it would be very nice if we could wrap an arbitrary Python function in a `t_CLOSURE`.

This can be done using the PARI library functions `install()` and `snm_closure()`.

This looks good to me now.  We can always implement a variadic version later, but I think is not a priority at the moment.  Also, the most naïve version of this makes the "cube" doctest fail, because even PARI doesn't support variadic functions in `apply`:

```
gp> g(v[..]) = v[1]^3
%1 = (v[..])->v[1]^3
gp> g(2)
%2 = 8
gp> apply(g, [1,2,3])
  ***   at top-level: apply(g,[1,2,3])
  ***                 ^----------------
  *** apply: incorrect type in apply (t_CLOSURE).
```
(The error only arises because the closure is variadic; non-variadic closures do work.)
