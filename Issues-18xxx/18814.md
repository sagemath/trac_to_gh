From the doc of `Polyhedron.delete` (which is a immutable/hashable object):

```
        Delete this polyhedron.

        This speeds up creation of new polyhedra by reusing
        objects. After recycling a polyhedron object, it is not in a
        consistent state any more and neither the polyhedron nor its
        H/V-representation objects may be used any more.
```

This really shouldn't be exposed at user level:

```
sage: p = polytopes.cube()
sage: p.delete()
sage: p
/home/ncohen/.Sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/repl/rich_output/display_manager.py:570: RichReprWarning: Exception in _rich_repr_ while displaying object: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()
  RichReprWarning,
<repr(<sage.geometry.polyhedron.backend_ppl.Polyhedra_ZZ_ppl_with_category.element_class at 0x7f1f17c92c30>) failed: TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()>
```

I also thought we are all consenting adults. 

I agree that a better implementation should be provided, but just renaming it is not doing anything.
