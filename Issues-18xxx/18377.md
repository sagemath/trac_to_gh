AHahah. Well... You have to become a git wizard `:-P`

It is not very complicated, though, as the name of the branch from #18296 still appears on the ticket: public/18296

You just have to merge your current branch with `public/18296`, and solve the conflicts that it will cause. Tell me if I am being too general. And if you do, please tell me how you use git (git trac? dev scripts? manually?)
