When defining a custom iterator one has to define a method that returns the next item. In Python 3 this method is called `next()` while in Python 3 this is the special method `__next__()`.

More information can be found in http://python-future.org/compatible_idioms.html#custom-iterators and http://python-future.org/what_else.html#custom-iterators.

Remark: To advance some iterator `it` in Py2 often this method is called directly `it.next()`.
But since Python 2.6 there is the *builtin function* `next()` which is compatible between Py2 and Py3: in Py2 it calls the iterator method `next()` while in Py3 it calls the special method `__next__()`.
Ticket #16075 addresses the (stage 1) conversion from `it.next()` to `next(it)`.

This ticket is tracked as a dependency of meta-ticket #16052.
