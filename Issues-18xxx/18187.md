Keywords: NTL-interface.o check

FLINT 2.4.5 (and 2.4.4 at least) **unconditionally** fail its test suite when building the NTL interface test due to a bug in the `Makefile`:

```
/make[4]: Entering directory

I'll polish my patch a bit since `t-NTL-interface$(EXEEXT)` should also depend on `$(LIBS)` (and the trailing semicolon doesn't make sense either), then submit it upstream I think.
