The contents of sage/graphs/planarity_c is not Sage source but a non-vanilla copy of John Boyer's planarity code [1]. This branch turns it into a standard package.

Is this meant to be a standard or optional package? In any case, the current branch obviously doesn't work if `planarity` is not installed:

Also: to be safe, you might want to rebase on top of #18145, especially if you make further changes to the build system.

A standard package. This code is already part of Sage.

Second time I have to rebase on top of that one `:-P`

Well, `src/ext` is not considered "our code", so that's not a problem.

Helloooooo,

Right! Fixed.

> Did you report your changes upstream?


No I didn't, and for two reasons:
1) What we have in Sage is apparently an old version of the files. When building the first version of this package (without autotools) I tried to use the new ones, but did not figure out how they should be compiled.

2) The makefiles this archive contains are only made to build everything as a shared library, while upstream also builds an independent executable and maybe some other things. They probably wouldn't like what I wrote.

I plan to do both, however, and I will start by sending them an email to ask whether they would accept such a pull request. Then I will try to figure out how to make it all work properly, and we will update our version of this package.

Okay, I thought that this was only a *part* of Nauty and that the author has negociated specific bits with Brendan McKay to have this license, but it seems that there is indeed a non-GPL compatible usage restriction (against military applications) in `nauty.h`.

That's twice in two days that I learn that a massive amount of work was done for naught.

Sorry for that. I will write to the author. And I guess we should go back to the initial sources (which do not include Nauty). And there is this malloc problem to solve.

Well, why do you say so? We just have to use the first package I
built, don't we? This one does not contain any nauty files. And
we must patch this malloc.h thing of course.
