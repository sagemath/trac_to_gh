We add two methods `is_integer` and `is_rational` for number field elements.

Currently, the only way to test this is to do duck typing

```
def is_integer(x):
    try:
        ZZ(x)
        return True
    except ValueError:
        return False
```
which is rather expensive compared to what can be done.

Is there a reason to keep the old `is_rational_c()` methods?

No. Actually, this method was wrong since it returned `False` for `0`... I added a method `is_one` and rewrote `multiplicative_order`.

Yes, thoug it didn't matter in the only place where it was used :-)

But then I guess you'll want to declare `is_rational` and `is_one` as `cpdef`.

Do you think so? In `sage.structure.RingElement` the `is_one` method is declared as `def` with the following default implementation

```
    def is_one(self):
        return self == self._parent.one()
```
But it is true that it might be relatively intensively used in number fields. I will do that.

Why won't we add these methods to expressions as well?

`Integer`, `Rational` and `AlgebraicNumber` have `is_integer`, `is_one` and `is_zero` but not `is_real` or `is_rational` or `is_algebraic`.
