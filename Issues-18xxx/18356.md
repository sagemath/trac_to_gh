Add a new operation `composed_op` on polynomials to compute the composed sum, difference, product and division of two polynomias. That is the polynomial whose roots are the sum (resp. difference, product, division) of the roots of the two polynomials.

Two implementations are proposed. The straightforward one using resultants and the algorithm from [BFSS]. For the latter algorithm, only polynomial with coefficient in `ZZ` or `QQ` are supported. However, this algorithm is asymptotically faster than using the `resultant` method.

For instance

```
sage: p1 = minpoly(cos(pi/43))
sage: p2 = minpoly(cos(pi/47))
sage: time r1 = p1.composed_op(p2, operator.add)
CPU times: user 108 ms, sys: 4 ms, total: 112 ms
Wall time: 111 ms
sage: time r2 = p1.composed_op(p2, operator.add, algorithm="resultant")
CPU times: user 47.1 s, sys: 0 ns, total: 47.1 s
Wall time: 47.1 s
sage: r1 == r2
True
sage: r1.is_irreducible()
True
```
In the example above, `r1` is the minimal polynomial of `cos(pi/43) + cos(pi/47)`

Here is a benchmark

```
def bench(p, op, n):
    print 'p=', p
    for n in range(1, n):
        q = p^n
        p1 = q*(q + 1)
        p2 = (q + 2)*(q + 3)
        f = getattr(p1, 'composed_sum') if op == '+' else getattr(p1, 'composed_product')
        t0 = time(); r1 = f(p2, "resultant",op)
        t1 = time(); r2 = f(p2, "BFSS", op)
        t2 = time()
        assert r1.monic() == r2
        print 'op = %s n=%d resultant:%.4f BFSS:%.4f' %(op, n,t1-t0,t2-t1)

```
Here are some results; in the case of sparse polynomials the resultant performs
better than in the case of dense polynomials

```
p= x^4
op = + n=1 resultant:0.0020 BFSS:0.0141
op = + n=2 resultant:0.0146 BFSS:0.0350

Hi,

If you look at the branch field in the ticket description you will see that it is red. It means that there is a merge conflict with the last beta. What you have to do is not to start from the stable release but from the development release (the name of the branch on the server is "develop"). Do you know how to do that?

I had a look at the branch, just some comment

1. It is better to use `Return XYZ` rather than `Compute XYZ` in the one line description of functions. What the function is internally doing is mostly a technical question. What you want to know when reading the documentation is what does the function return.

2. This is old cython

```
cdef int i
for i from 0 <= i <= n:
    ...
```
  you can just write

```
cdef int i
for i in range(n):
    ...
```
  this will be transformed into a C loop by Cython.
 
3. In `hadamard_product` I would defined precisely what is the pointwise product. If you have a naive look to wikipedia, the pointwise product of two functions `f` and `g` is just `x -> f(x)g(x)`.

Hi Vincent,
  I opened  #18373 based on the development branch, replacing this ticket.
  I followed your suggestions here and in #18242 :

    In `newton_sum` the ring `R` is added as an argument

    Avoided using fraction fields (apart from ``R(QQ(1)/p1)`` there was also a division by `x`).

    Eliminated duplicate code, merging `composed_add` and `composed_product`.

    I did some benchmark; there is a strong dependence on the sparseness of the polynomials.
    The resultant algorithm is faster with some polynomials with few coefficients and high degree.
    By default `composed_op` selects which algorithm to use, based on the degree and the number
    of nonvanishing coefficients.
    The dependence on the size of the coefficients does not seem to make much difference.

    I eliminated `hadamard_product`.

Hello,

You should **not** open a new ticket each time you create a branch. Now we have three duplicated tickets!! Delete #18373 (i.e. remove the branch field and set the milestone to `sage-duplicate/invalid/won't fix`) and simply modify the branch of this ticket.

Sorry for this mess.

For this ticket I worked with the stable release. Then I downloaded the development release,
made a branch there, and tried to modify this ticket with
`./sage -dev push --ticket 18356` but I got an error message

```
Not pushing your changes because they would discard some of the commits on the
remote branch "u/pernici/ticket/18356".
```
and did not know how to proceed, so I opened #18373 .
Can I delete this ticked and keep #18373 ?

You should have asked.

If you want me to review it, no. There are comments here that are precious for the history. Moreover, if you do not know how to properly pull and push with git, choosing your solution will not help you.

You should first stop using the sage dev scripts which are deprecated since at least two version of sage. Then you can read the [manual](http://sagemath.org/doc/developer/) and start either using the `git trac` command or using `git` by itself. Everything is explained in details.

Hello,

Thanks for using this ticket.

4. In the description of the function you wrote a very precise definition. But then, in the `NOTE`, you claim that the two algorithms might behave differently...

5. Why do you only check the parent for `p1`?

```
if p1.parent().base_ring() not in (ZZ, QQ):
    raise ValueError('implemented only for polynomials on
                       integer or rational ring')
```
  Moreover, why is it only in the case of `BFSS`?

6. What is this argument `_cached_QQ`!? You can certainly not use that. Note that in `sage.rings.qqbar` there is already `QQxy`, `QQxy_x` and `QQxy_y` defined. So either it is time critical in which case you could create a function like

```
_QQxy = None
def QQxy_with_gens():
    global _QQxy
    if _QQxy is None:
        from sage.rings.rational_field import QQ
        R = QQ['x', 'y']
        _QQxy = (R, R.gen(0), R.gen(1))
    return _QQxy
```
  and move it near the `PolynomialRing` function. Then this function should be also used in `sage.ring.qqbar`. You can also try to see why calling `PolynomialRing` is so slow.

7. It would be more natural to me if `op` would be an operator and not a string. In other words, one of

```
sage: import operator
sage: operator.add
<built-in function add>
sage: operator.sub
<built-in function sub>
sage: operator.mul
<built-in function mul>
sage: operator.div
<built-in function div>
```
  It can be checked in the method with

```
if op is operator.add:
    ...
elif op is operator.sub:
    ...
```
  It is a very personal feeling, what do you think?

8. This takes time

```
from sage.rings.power_series_ring import PowerSeriesRing
from sage.rings.big_oh import O as big_O
```
  so you would better move it where it is used, i.e. in the case where `algorithm=BFSS`. Similarly, in `newton_sum` you should move `from sage.rings.power_series_ring import PowerSeriesRing`

9. You can use the fact that bool is a subtype of int when you decide the algorithm

```
sage: sum(bool(i) for i in [0,1,3,0,2,0,4])
4
```

9. In `newton_sum` the argument `prec` and `R` are redundant. But I do not know how to do better.

Hello,

I made changes according to your comments:

4. The description corresponds to the monic form; now by default
   the result of `composed_op` is in monic form.

5. Added the check that `p1` and `p2` are on the same polynomial ring.

6. Put `QQxy_with_gens` in place of `cached_QQ`.

7. Used `operator.add`, etc. 

8. Moved the import statements.

9. Used `bool`.

10. Eliminated the `prec` argument in `newton_sum`.

Other changes:

  previously `composed_op` returned a polynomial in `x` regardless
  of the variable name of the input polynomials; fixing this gave
  a speed-up of the "resultant" algorithm for small polynomials.

  added some more checks on the input polynomials

  eliminated the call to `integral` in the case of `operator.add`

The algorithm for `newton_sum` is slightly changed with respect to the one written in BFSS, Lemma 1.
I will change it to the latter form, which is simpler and slightly faster.
In either case there is no inversion, there is reversion though.

Lemma 1 comes from Schoenage, who used it in a numerical context. Should I put the reference to
Schoenage's paper, or is it sufficient to write "See [BFSS] and references within." ?

As far as I understand Lemma 1 is precisely Schoenage formula (but I did not open the relevant paper). The algorithm of BFSS is Proposition 1. The inversion is only computed up to the degree of the polynomial. Then there are some iterations that depends on `prec`. Am I wrong?

I think it would make sense.

About the name, what do you think about `newton_series` instead? It would make the result clearer. And please, add the mathematical definition in the function.

A problem with calling it `newton_series` is that `newton_sum` returns a polynomial, not a series.

I will try to implement `composed_op` in `polynomial_rational_flint.pyx`; for the moment I have an
implementation of `composed_mul`; for small polynomials (degree 2) it is a few times faster than the resultant algorithm, 20x faster than the previous implementation of the BFSS algorithm. 

Therefore the resultant algorithm will be taken away. 

For large polynomials the implementation in `polynomial_rational_flint.pyx`
is currently slow; the reason is that there is no `hadamard_product` for polynomials in Flint,
and my implementation is very slow. I have to study something of Flint to do better.
Once I fix this I expect that the two implementations of BFSS will be equally fast for large polynomials.

<a id='comment:27'>Comment 27:</a>
I tried some benchmark with some small polynomials in #18420; 
I find that `p1._mul_trunc_(p2, prec)`
is slightly faster than `(p1*p2).truncate(prec)`, with polynomials of degree `prec-1`.

I will look further at #18420, but it is not the way to speed up `composed_op`,
as the following benchmark shows.

```
def test2():
    K.<x> = QQ[]
    p1 = x^2 - 2
    p2 = x^2 - 3
    t0 = time()
    r = p1.composed_op(p2, operator.mul, algorithm='BFSS')
    #r = p1.composed_mul(p2)
    t1 = time()
    print 'r=', r
    print '%.6f' %(t1 - t0)
```

Here are the results for the best out of 10 runs:

composed_op 'BFSS':
up to PowerSeriesRing(...) included: 0.000524 
newton_sums: 0.001369 
hadamard prod: 0.000030 
integral: 0.000073 
exp: 0.001195 
reverse: 0.000002
total: 0.003264

Only the newton sums could use `_mul_trunc_`, although it is not clear to me how
to do it best; anyway it would make it only slightly faster. But even if the newton sums
took zero time, this algorithm would be slower than the resultant algorithm and much
slower than `composed_mul`

`composed_op` 'resultant': 0.000584

`composed_mul`: 0.000026

Hi,

Did you completely avoid the power series ring? We should provide more methods to polynomial like:
- `inverse_series(self, prec, as_polynomial=False)`: return the inverse series and if `as_polynomial` is true returns it as a polynomial
As FLINT has some native implementation, we should use it where it makes sense. But this should be done in another ticket.

In all your code, you know in advance the precision needed. Right?

Yes, I used `fmpq_poly_inv_series`, `fmpq_poly_exp_series`, so the power series ring is not used.

You might consider implementing (in an other ticket) an `inverse_series` and an `exp_series` method on polynoms that handle the option of returning a polynom. This method would have a default implementation in `polynomial_element.pyx` and specialized one for the FLINT classes.

I have rewritten `composed_op` using `inverse_series`, `exp_series`, methods in `polynomial_element.pyx`
(without default implementation yet), using `_mul_trunc_` in #18420 as a template.
It is faster than the "resultant" algorithm in all the cases tested.

I think that `inverse_series`, `exp_series`, etc. in `polynomial_element.pyx`
should always return a polynomial.

I could open a ticket on implementing these methods, depending on #18420.
Do you think that it is ok?

For a programmer this is clear. But not a user. If you ask `inverse_series` you expect a series... but I do not have a strong opinion. A possible alternative is to write:

- one global `def inverse_series(self, prec, as_polynomial=False)` in `polynomial_element.pyx`
  that would use
- several `cpdef Polynomial _inverse_series(self, long prec)` that return polynomials.

I think it would be good. Power series are by far too slow to be usable. Please put me in cc.
