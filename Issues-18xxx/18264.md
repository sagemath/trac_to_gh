We would love to be able to, for example, present a symmetric function with factored coefficients.  But:

```
sage: f = SymmetricFunctions(ZZ).s()([2,2,1])
sage: f.map_coefficients(factor)
0
```

The result is not against the specification, because `map_coefficients` requires an endofunction.

There are two issues:

1.) we possibly want to be warned when supplying `map_coefficients` with something that is not an endofunction.  This might be achieved by adding an optional argument `check` with default `True`.

2.) we want some way to factor the coefficients.  Nicolas proposed to make something like

```
sage: f.map_coefficients(factor, codomain=SR)
```
or

```
sage: f.change_base_ring(SR).map_coefficients(factor) 
```
work.

Note that the `Polynomial` class contains something similar, namely:

```
def map_coefficients(self, f, new_base_ring=None)
```

However, there might be another tiny problem: it seems that currently it is not possible to make factored integers into a commutative ring.  This should possibly be a separate ticket.

<a id='comment:7'></a>Hi Martin!

Thanks for taking action; this is looking good!

Now that I am reading actual code: a usual idiom to check that a
coefficient is indeed in the base ring is to coerce it back there with
`R(c)`. I guess that would be a fine behavior: it's faster, and it
takes care of all cases where someone passes an int, or something that
requires some small coercion to be put back in the base ring.

Maybe the option shall be named `coerce` after all. Comments anyone?

Note by the way that coercing would fail in Mike's original use case,
so whether we go for `coerce` or `check` don't make a difference
there:

```
sage: ZZ(factor(4))
TypeError: unable to coerce <class 'sage.structure.factorization_integer.IntegerFactorization'> to an integer
```


If we go for the coerce way, then the simplest would be to pass this
option down to `sum_of_terms`. This requires updating
`CombinatorialFreeModule.sum_of_terms` to implement that option, by
passing it down to respectively `CombinatorialFreeModule._from_dict`
where it's already implemented and `CombinatorialFreeModule.term`
where it would need to be implemented by passing the option down to
`_from_dict`.

It's getting a bit bigger of a change than what was planned for
originaly; do you feel like handling it?

Cheers,
                        Nicolas

<a id='comment:10'></a>Hi there!

I was just about to do what Nicolas suggest -- adding an optional argument `coerce`, but I encountered some things that make me hesitate:

1. to be helpful for the casual user, it's default value would have to be `True` - differently from what we have in `_from_dict`.

2. the docstring would then be something like

```
whether to try to coerce the result of applying `f` to the coefficient ring.
```

    which is a bit strange, given that we require `f` to be an endofunction.

If you reassure me, I'll do it.  I'm just not 100% sure myself.

Yeah, I agree; it's not supper consistent. Yet `_from_dict` is a
private method when this one is public; so it's not unreasonable
either that the typical usage situation differ, inducing different
default behavior.

I see your point. We should be able to find some wording that makes it
sound natural. Maybe something like:

`Whether to systematically coerce to the coefficient ring the result
of applying `f`, for additional safety`.

From my perspective you can proceed! Feedback anyone else?

<a id='comment:12'></a>Done (currently testing).

A question: in general, what is the requirement on the coefficients (morally, not enforced...)?

1) they should be in the base ring
2) they should be coercible to the base ring
3) you shouldn't expect anything...

1: In the internal representation, the coefficients are supposed to be
in the base ring and non zero (as tested by `bool(c)` aka
`c.__nonzero__()`).

I indeed would not be surprised if there were quite a few places in
the Sage sources where those assumptions are broken / abused. It would
be good to progressively detect and fix them. A step in this direction
is to find a better speed/safety/flexibility balance for when to run
sanity checks, or not, as you are doing here.

If some intermediate calculations involve rational coefficients, then
we definitely want a failure here. Maybe there is a way to improve the
ncsf code to better support NCSF over integers by sticking to integral
computations.

Darij, Mike, ..., what do you think? Do you have a quick way to improve NCSF's
handling of integral coefficients? Or is it ok to switch this test to
`QQ` or mark it as "not implemented" for now?

IMO: I think that if you want to allow factor coefficients then the answer to your question is 3) you shouldn't expect anything...

I don't think so.  A neat trick we should copy from FriCAS is to have a constructor `Factored` that takes a ring and returns a ring, keeping the elements in factored form.

So far, however, I do not know how to create a ring in sage...

<a id='comment:23'></a>I investigated the failure in `sage.algebras.steenrod.steenrod_algebra.SteenrodAlgebra_generic.coproduct`, which is actually not a real failure:

```
Failed example:
    SteenrodAlgebra(p=11, profile=((), (2,1,2))).Q(0,2).coproduct()
Expected:
    1 # Q_0 Q_2 + Q_0 # Q_2 + Q_0 Q_2 # 1 - Q_2 # Q_0
Got:
    1 # Q_0 Q_2 + Q_0 # Q_2 + Q_0 Q_2 # 1 + 10*Q_2 # Q_0

```

The `p=11` in the example means that the coefficient ring is the field with 11 elements, so -1 and 10 are actually the same thing.

The doc failure in macdonald.py seems a real issue. Mike? (Anyone who works on this needs the newest develop version, 6.7.beta3, since the Macdonald functions have undergone a major change in this version.)

Also the error in free_module.py itself seems to suggest that some optional parameters are being ignored...

Thank you!

Yes, as I mentioned above (I hope), I "manually" set `coerce = True` in `_from_dict` to catch errors.
