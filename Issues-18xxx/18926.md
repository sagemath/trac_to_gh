This branch implements a new function named `gen_rest_table_index` which generates an index of the functions given as arguments.

It can also generate the list of all methods of a given class `A`.

With this functions, it is then very easy to add an index of functions in a Sage module, that does not have to be kept updated manually.

Hi Nathann

Clever idea and nice code. I like it.

A few small comments:

* The doc string doesn't specify that you can give the function a module (only a class).

* You could add a doc-test that passing a class or module also works. For good
  quine humour, it could be:

  sage: gen_rest_table_index(sage.misc.rest_index_of_methods)
  ....

* What exactly do you filter out with the `inspect.getmodule(root) == inspect.getmodule(f)` check?

  This function would be nice to use in catalogues, such as
  `sage.coding.codes_catalog`. But currently one can't due to the above line.
  Could that, however, possibly give problems with references given in the
  one-line description of a function from another module?

* The function doesn't seem to do very interesting things for classes which have
  inherited most of their methods. Is this by design? It is unfortunate wrt. the
  category framework which garbles parent classes. For instance, running the
  function on `FinitePosets` returns nothing.

  Instead of using `root.__dict__`, then `dir(root)` would find everything and
  his grandmother. Could that be more clever? Here the check
  `inspect.getmodule(root) == ...` also seems to get in the way for listing
  class methods.

Hellooooooooooo !

Thanks. I like it too `:-P`

Good idea, done.

> * What exactly do you filter out with the `inspect.getmodule(root) == inspect.getmodule(f)` check?

The imported modules. If you remove it, you will see `gen_rest_table_index` appear in the documentation of `sage.combinat.designs.difference_families`.

> * The function doesn't seem to do very interesting things for classes which have

It was designed to only show the 'first-level' functions, i.e. not the inherited ones.

>   Instead of using `root.__dict__`, then `dir(root)` would find everything and

If you find a nice way to make it work, I have no objection for as long as both remain available. The list of methods of 'graph' is already long enough:

http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/graphs/sage/graphs/graph.html

You don't want to see its functions mixed with those:

http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/graphs/sage/graphs/generic_graph.html

Of course this index of functions is 'hand-made' so the example does not apply. But there are other places where I would like to have an index of functions: many classes inherit from IncidenceStructure, and I would not want to see the methods of IncidenceStructure repeated everywhere.

In this situation, it would be more efficient to list only the first-level methods, and have links saying what this class inherits from, so that users can find the other methods easily.

This way we also avoid seeing the usual broken functions "which should not be inherited but are nevertheless" like

```
sage: Partitions(4).base_ring
sage: Partitions(4).objgen
sage: Partitions(4).objgens
...
```

Helloooooooooooooooo Nathannnnnnnn,

For some reason, I can't pull from trac.sagemath.org right now - connection timeout. So I can't get your newest version and run the tests.

I see what you're saying about the locally defined functions. To support
catalogues like sage.coding.codes_catalog, a flag `only_local=True` could be
added: usually, we wan't to filter out imported or inherited functions, but
sometimes we might want them in. I don't think it complicates the function
detrimentally.

I'd push this change myself if trac was working for me right now.

I also wanted to suggest some further polishing of the docstrings. I'll push that as soon as I can again connect to trac.sagemath.org.

Johan

Helloooooo Johan,

I have several remarks about your commits:

- If you build the documentation of reference/misc, you will notice that the description (in the index) of `gen_rest_table_index` is unfinished: only the first line is taken into account (see http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#the-docstring-of-a-function-content)

- Wrong alignment of a paragraph in the documentation of `only_local`, and some latex code which should be surrounded by two backticks instead of only one.

- About `only_local`: I do not understand this doctest about not including `gen_rest_table_index` in the index of ... its own module. Why wouldn't `only_local=False` print always more than `only_local=True` in general? This does not make sense to me.

- I do not understand your mention of 'static' methods.

- Above the 'input' block, a lone line applies to 'classes' only, and does not take the value 'only_local' into account.

Nathann

Hiiiiii Nathann,

Oh, sorry, didn't check that. Fixed.

> - Wrong alignment of a paragraph in the documentation of `only_local`, and some latex code which should be surrounded by two backticks instead of only one.

Fixed.

> - About `only_local`: I do not understand this doctest about not including `gen_rest_table_index` in the index of ... its own module. Why wouldn't `only_local=False` print always more than `only_local=True` in general? This does not make sense to me.

Yes, it's slightly bizarre. Say you have a catalog module that you wish to have
an index for. Then you import `gen_rest_table_index` and you call it with
`only_local=False`: you want all the non-local functions, **except
`gen_rest_table_index` itself**. The funny test is then simply to see that this
is filtered out, without having to rely on another module.

> - I do not understand your mention of 'static' methods.

The function only extracts methods of a class which have been decorated with
`@staticmethod`. It will not extract methods on *instances* of the class, i.e.
the normal methods. This was already the semantics in your original version.

> - Above the 'input' block, a lone line applies to 'classes' only, and does not take the value 'only_local' into account.

This line was just to clarify the semantics of the function wrt. classes, since
this surprised me when I first reviewed the ticket. I never intended
`only_local` to have any effect when the function is called on classes.

Oh okay, it is true that somehow this function has a 'special behaviour'. Would you see anything wrong in filtering it out with `f is not gen_rest_table_index` instead of checking its module?

Whaaaaat? `O_o`

None of the methods of `IncidenceStructure` are decorated like that. And they appear in the list `O_o`

Oh. What about renaming it to 'only_local_functions` to make it plain(er) that it does not apply to methods?

Hellooooo !

I cleaned/simplified a couple of things. Also, it seems that this code catalog of yours did not compile anymore and the functions appeared twice. Is it okay for you now?

I do not see anything to add, on my side.
