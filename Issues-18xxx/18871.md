Hellooooooo David,

Some comments:

- Module's doc, documentation of MILP variable `z`: at the end of the line there
  is a `y^y`. Shouldn't it be `y^k`?

- Constraints: the third constraint is missing one side of the inequality.

- But I am not sure that I understand the system: why wouldn't you say that:
  a) `x_v^k <= x_v^{k+1}` (the values can only increase)
  b) `\sum_v x_v^k == k` (for every k)

- About y: what about only having those two constraints:
  - `y_{uv}^k >= x_v^k - x_u^k`
  - `y_{uv}^k >= x_u^k - x_v^k`
  It seems to me that they are sufficient to express `y_{uv}^k >= x_u^k XOR x_v^k`. And you do not really need to say that `y` has to be *equal* to the
  XOR, the `>=` should be enough given that you minimize the cost of a cut.

- If you see a better way to name the `x,y`, and `z`... `:-P`

- When building the documentation, the references toward the number of the
  constraints do not appear correctly. Neither does the 'xor'.

- You call `set_binary` on a variable that you already defined as binary.

- Is there any reason why you catch the `MIPSolverException`?

- You do not have to int+round the value of `z['z']`. The solver should give you
  an integer value as you defined the variable as integral: if it does not,
  that's a bug that should be fixed.

Nathann

Constraint (a) can be rewritten with a sum as I did. It is sometimes faster for the solver. Don't know why.

You are right. I have simplified the code.

unfortunately no better names in mind.

Corrected. (and no xor anymore)

removed.

Removed. no particular reason.

I have removed the round.

Hello again,

I added a small commit with a couple of modifications:

- replaces "A - B <= 0" constraints with "A <= B"

- Removed 'except:'

The problem with 'except' without any exception name is that it catches too much:

```
sage: try:
....:     p.solveeeeee()
....: except:
....:     raise ValueError("Infeasible Problem")
ValueError: Infeasible Problem
```

This way, the LP solver is forwarded to the user, and it will be more meaningful that a generic error message: on my computer I get this:

```
sage: cutwidth.cutwidth_MILP(G, lower_bound=G.size()+1)
...
MIPSolverException: 'CPLEX: The primal has no feasible solution'
```

You can change the ticket's status to `positive_review` unless there is something that you want to change.

Have fuuuuuuun,

Nathann

Hello,

I agree with your modifications, and I have removed the import of MIPSolverException.

I have a question because the patchbot is complaining about multiline doctest:

```

I not sure to understand the problem. Should we use `...` or `....:` as indicated here http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#documentation-strings ?
Both style are used in the tests of method ` vertex_separation_MILP`, in file `vertex_separation.pyx`.
Let me know what I should do.

David.

YOooooooo !

We should use the new-style '....:' everywhere. Old code has not been changed, but the policy is to not add more.
