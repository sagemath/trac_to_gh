The code

```
    F = GF(2)
    L.<t> = PowerSeriesRing(F,'t')
    R.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(L,'x,y')
    PolynomialSequence([0], R)
```
does not work because PolynomialSequence makes an implicit distinction between fields of characteristic != 2 and finite fields of characteristic 2. The fix allows for infinite fields of characteristic 2 (treating them generically together with fields of characteristic != 2).
