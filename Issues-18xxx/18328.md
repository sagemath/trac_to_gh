There are probably multiple places where `_repr_()` returns ascii art and not a string that can be composed with other strings. That then leads to issues like

```
sage: pi.n(100), CartanMatrix("E8~").dynkin_diagram()
(3.1415926535897932384626433833,         O 2
         |
         |
 O---O---O---O---O---O---O---O
 1   3   4   5   6   7   8   0   
 E8~)
```
The solution should be to move ascii art to the magic `_ascii_art_` method. 

Unfortunately, the IPython commandline defaults to plain text output. So you either have to switch

```
sage: %display ascii_art
```
or override `_rich_repr_` to make ascii art the default for your object. Perhaps the default display preference on the commandline should be changed to ascii art.

For the record, this is the decision Axiom (maybe better known here as FriCAS) made a few decades ago, output is ascii-art.  The downside is, of course, that you cannot copy output into the clipboard and reuse it as input.  However, especially for symbolic expressions involving sums, products, powers, fractions, the ascii-art is a great convenience!

Back to sage, as mentioned by Marc, also (small) matrices are always typeset as ascii-art, similar to Dynkin diagrams.  Are there any others?

```

am I right in guessing that `_repr_` contains ascii-art if it returns a string which contains a newline (i.e., `\n`)?

If so, it should be quite possible to collect at least a few "bad guys"...

The plain displayhook actually has support for ascii-art matrices

```
sage: %display plain
sage: pi.n(100), identity_matrix(2)
(
                                [1 0]
3.1415926535897932384626433833, [0 1]
)
```
but its hardcoded to apply to matrices only. The ascii art output is much more flexible.
