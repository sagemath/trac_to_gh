Ooops, are you sure the patch from #17806 got properly applied? >8)

The error messages look exactly like those initially reported on that ticket...




IIRC arando is (or runs) a 32-bit VM on a 64-bit processor; could you post (or attach) the MPIR build log somewhere?

(We wanted it to build the 6.6 binary for distribution of course.)\n\nBtw, shouldn't arando meanwhile run Ubuntu 14.10, soon 15.04?

Well, either convince Volker to keep his clone up-to-date, or pull from sagemath on github, I don't know.  (We wanted it to build the 6.6 binary for distribution of course.)

Btw, shouldn't arando meanwhile run Ubuntu 14.10, soon 15.04?  (I also thought it was Keshav's machine, located in Singapore... :-) )

Probably Volker has a reason to have it this way (such as lack of time)...

14.04LTS is still supported, no? The machine took a boat to UK over a year ago, and now sits in my office, while Keshav does a PhD at UTexas.

Sure, but [the buildbot description](http://build.sagedev.org/release/buildslaves/dima-arando) says 13.04, which is probably no longer correct.

Those days, arando used to always have the most recent (32-bit) Ubuntu release, i.e., non-LTS releases included, since LTS releases were covered by other machines.

If **6.6** builds, we get the desired binary distribution, we can close this ticket as invalid and I can stop wasting my time... ;-)

Yep, from the kernel and GCC versions, I guess it's 14.04.
