The error messages look exactly like those initially reported on that ticket...




IIRC arando is (or runs) a 32-bit VM on a 64-bit processor; could you post (or attach) the MPIR build log somewhere?

Well, either convince Volker to keep his clone up-to-date, or pull from sagemath on github, I don't know.  (We wanted it to build the 6.6 binary for distribution of course.)

Btw, shouldn't arando meanwhile run Ubuntu 14.10, soon 15.04?  (I also thought it was Keshav's machine, located in Singapore... :-) )

Probably Volker has a reason to have it this way (such as lack of time)...

14.04LTS is still supported, no? The machine took a boat to UK over a year ago, and now sits in my office, while Keshav does a PhD at UTexas.

Sure, but [the buildbot description](http://build.sagedev.org/release/buildslaves/dima-arando) says 13.04, which is probably no longer correct.

Those days, arando used to always have the most recent (32-bit) Ubuntu release, i.e., non-LTS releases included, since LTS releases were covered by other machines.

If **6.6** builds, we get the desired binary distribution, we can close this ticket as invalid and I can stop wasting my time... ;-)

Yep, from the kernel and GCC versions, I guess it's 14.04.

(Lucid is btw also still supported, but will unfortunately reach end of life soon.)
