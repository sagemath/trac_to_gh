FLINT 2.4.5 (and 2.4.4 at least) **unconditionally** fail its test suite when building the NTL interface test due to a bug in the `Makefile`:

> I didn't report it upstream because I couldn't reproduce it from a plain upstream tarball. By default upstream builds static stuff and if you do that there is no problem. Originally it wasn't present in sage either, I'd have to check but at some point we must have stopped building static libraries or objects in flint. It only happens when you build shared libraries exclusively.

     Never build static library
 
```
Who else...




I'll polish my patch a bit since `t-NTL-interface$(EXEEXT)` should also depend on `$(LIBS)` (and the trailing semicolon doesn't make sense either), then submit it upstream I think.

FWIW, a proper fix is now in trunk, so we can remove the patch on the next upgrade.
