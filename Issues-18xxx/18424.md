FLINT 2.4.5 (and 2.4.4 at least) **unconditionally** fail its test suite when building the NTL interface test due to a bug in the `Makefile`:

```
/make[4]: Entering directory

```
sage-on-gentoo and now Gentoo proper have carried a patch for the issue for some time now. See
https://sources.gentoo.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/gentoo-x86/sci-mathematics/flint/files/flint-2.4.4-test.patch?view=markup

Keywords: NTL-interface.o check

Upstream: Fixed upstream, but not in a stable release.

I'll polish my patch a bit since `t-NTL-interface$(EXEEXT)` should also depend on `$(LIBS)` (and the trailing semicolon doesn't make sense either), then submit it upstream I think.
