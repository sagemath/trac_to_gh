FLINT 2.4.5 (and 2.4.4 at least) **unconditionally** fail its test suite when building the NTL interface test due to a bug in the `Makefile`:

```

Sorry, misread that.  They just renamed the file, but didn't add a dependency, so it's half-fixed upstream.

    Never build static library

```
Who else...




I'll polish my patch a bit since `t-NTL-interface$(EXEEXT)` should also depend on `$(LIBS)` (and the trailing semicolon doesn't make sense either), then submit it upstream I think.
