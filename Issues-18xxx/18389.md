In Sage, there are many `Parent` and `Element` classes implemented in Python, so it must be `cpdef`.

> I thought there was a small speed penalty for the former

That's true, but the penalty should be really small.

> Also can you add a doctest for each of the new (boilerplate) methods?

There is really no point for that, what could I possibly put in there that is not redundant?

Ah, it has to be `cpdef` in order to be compatible with the `def _cmp_` in `Element`.

Except for our policy that any new function/method must be documented, but I'm okay with redundant doctests. Perhaps some comparisons with `<=` or `>=`?

I'm not OK with completely pointless and redundant doctests which don't appear in the reference manual anyway.

Note that the boilerplate comparison methods will be deleted in #18329. So there is even less reason to add doctests since they will be removed in a follow-up ticket.
