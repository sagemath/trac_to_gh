This file is unused and marked as "do not use" since 2009.

And `IntegerListsLex` is since a long time available from somewhere else.

`sage.combinat.integer_list_old` has long been replaced by `sage.combinat.integer_lists`. We remove it.

The original aim of this ticket was to cythonize `sage.combinat.integer_list_old.IntegerListsLex` which has been taken care of as the new `sage.combinat.integer_lists.invlex.IntegerListsLex` is already cythonized.

Why does this ticket depend on #18055? I think it would be much better to reverse the dependency (i.e. #18055 should depend on this). Because improving the algorithm will be much easier once you can use Cython.

Maybe this will become true the day where running an interactive debugger will be trivial in Cython and recompilation will be instantaneous. In the mean time, I really don't see why Cythonizing can possibly make it easier. Besides, it remains to be decided whether we should go for Cython or for an external library in, say C++. This decision will be better taken once we know exactly what the algorithm looks like.
