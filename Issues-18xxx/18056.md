This file is unused and marked as "do not use" since 2009.

And `IntegerListsLex` is since a long time available from somewhere else.

`sage.combinat.integer_list_old` has long been replaced by `sage.combinat.integer_lists`. We remove it.

The original aim of this ticket was to cythonize `sage.combinat.integer_list_old.IntegerListsLex` which has been taken care of as the new `sage.combinat.integer_lists.invlex.IntegerListsLex` is already cythonized.

Why does this ticket depend on #18055? I think it would be much better to reverse the dependency (i.e. #18055 should depend on this). Because improving the algorithm will be much easier once you can use Cython.
