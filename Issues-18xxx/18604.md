**Disclaimer**: implementing a cache whose keys are (isomorphism type of) graphs and values are some invariant is a *bad* idea. See [comment:1](#comment%3A1) below.

Original suggestion:

    At this point I am not in the right state to include this improvement in Sage but I am leaving it here for the future or if someone else is bored.

    Much in the same way as with the chromatic polynomial (as discussed on #14529) one can improve the computation of the matching polynomial with use of caching.

```
sage: G = graphs.DodecahedralGraph()
sage: %timeit G.matching_polynomial()
100 loops, best of 3: 1.97 ms per loop
sage: %timeit matchpoly(G)
1 loops, best of 3: 723 Âµs per loop
```
    The implementation is the usual one though I suppose it makes sense to use this directly in the Cython file.

```
def matchpoly(G):
    
    global cache 

    s = tuple(sorted(G.canonical_label().edges(labels=False)))

    if s in cache:
        return cache[s]
    if not G.is_connected():
        return prod([matchpoly(C) for C in G.connected_components_subgraphs()])

    R = ZZ['x']
    x = R.gen()
    
    if G.size() == 0:
        return x^G.order()

    u,v = G.edge_iterator(labels=False).next()
        
    H = G.copy()

    H.delete_edge(u,v)
    p = matchpoly(H)

    H.delete_vertices([u,v])

    ret = p - matchpoly(H)
    
    cache[s] = ret 

    return ret 
```

Hi,

Your proposition is far from being a computational improvement. Caching the values of all possible graphs results in using a lot of memory. Moreover, for most graphs your proposition would be slower (because you call for canonical labels).

For very symmetric graph of a reasonable size your function is already slower

```
sage: G = graphs.GridGraph((5,7))
sage: %time p = G.matching_polynomial()
CPU times: user 15.5 s, sys: 0 ns, total: 15.5 s
sage: %time p = matchpoly(G)
CPU times: user 18.6 s, sys: 4 ms, total: 18.6 s
Wall time: 18.6 s
```
And it is **infinitely** slower on random graphs

```
sage: G = graphs.RandomGNP(28, 5/28)
sage: %time p = G.matching_polynomial()
CPU times: user 3.36 s, sys: 0 ns, total: 3.36 s
Wall time: 3.36 s
sage: %runfile test.py
sage: %time p = matchpoly(G)
CPU times: user 2min 14s, sys: 224 ms, total: 2min 14s
Wall time: 2min 14s
```
Of course the next call would be faster but I do not know anybody who will call twice an expensive function.

I propose to just close this ticket as a won't fix and emphasize in the description that caching is of no help here! If you care about the computation of matching polynomial you can have a look at #17921.

Vincent

Hey there,

thanks for having a look! I am really surprised about this outcome. The same idea is used for the Tutte polynomial and is a solid improvement. As tested on the Dodecahderal graph  it seemed like it makes sense. I guess cache efficiency comes from edge contractions not vertex deletions?

That said I suggest we close this down (can't find the option on my side?)

What do you mean by "solid improvement"? Are you sure it is faster to use caching there? Did you do serious benchmarking with and without? I am very curious about that.

All right.

More precisely this is what I get (with caching):

```

Wall time: 186 ms
sage: G = graphs.RandomGNP(14, 0.2)
sage: %time p = G.tutte_polynomial()

Wall time: 16 ms

sage: %time p = G.tutte_polynomial()
CPU times: user 80 ms, sys: 4 ms, total: 84 ms
Wall time: 76.7 ms
sage: G = graphs.RandomGNP(14, 0.2)
sage: %time p = G.tutte_polynomial()
CPU times: user 84 ms, sys: 8 ms, total: 92 ms
Wall time: 83.8 ms
sage: G = graphs.RandomGNP(14, 0.2)
sage: %time p = G.tutte_polynomial()
CPU times: user 656 ms, sys: 4 ms, total: 660 ms
Wall time: 652 ms
sage: %time p = G.tutte_polynomial()
CPU times: user 740 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 740 ms
Wall time: 734 ms
```

without caching (i.e. redefining `def _cached(func)` as `return func`):

```
sage: G = graphs.RandomGNP(14, 0.2)
sage: %time p = G.tutte_polynomial()
CPU times: user 180 ms, sys: 24 ms, total: 204 ms

So I wonder where is your "solid improvement"!?

So perhaps this ticket would still makes sense?

In some sense it does but one would really have to be careful in designing this properly. 

You argued that on random graphs on 14 vertices is less efficient and if we take that as our base benchmark then it may not be worth it.

In general I think it can be made in a worthwhile improvement especially for larger graphs and provided that we use bliss or nauty.

Does this ticket still needs a review? #17921 also claims to make this routine faster.

The algorithm in #17921 has a speed factor of >1000x for the bigger examples given here, so this is a complete different game. There is the original Sage algorithm if one needs a check.
