Sage already has lrs as an optional package (#18127 renames it lrslib).

For higher-dimensional polytopes, computing vertices by lrs is often much faster than the implementations of the double description method in cddlib and ppl. 
lrslib 6.2 (#20886) has two modes of parallel computation, `plrs` and `mplrs`, see â€‹http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~avis/C/lrs.html

lrs also has very fast and convenient code for removing redundant inequalities ("redund"). 
See [https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-support/WRpS5OgFMm8](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-support/WRpS5OgFMm8)

Sage should have a backend_lrs.py to make use of the existing lrs package.

[https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/oH6Jrjs-HUY](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/oH6Jrjs-HUY)

As has been said in these discussions, lrs also has a key benefit that it can generate the vertices as a stream, with very little memory use. This feature could be exposed using Python generators, using the Polyhedron methods `Vrep_generator()`, `vertex_generator()`, `ray_generator()`, `line_generator()`.

See also: polymake (#20892) has an interface to at least some features of lrs
