The coverage score is a factor 100 too large:

```
(sage-sh) $ src/bin/sage-coverageall
...
Overall weighted coverage score:  9486.0%
Total number of functions: 38096
We need   53 more functions to get to 95% coverage.
We need 1577 more functions to get to 99% coverage.
```
This was caused by #17776 badly changing the string formatting.
