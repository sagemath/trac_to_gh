Using Sage 6.5, when I do

```
random_matrix(QQ, 7,4, algorithm='subspaces')
```
almost always it says

```
Error in lines 1-1
Traceback (most recent call last):

ValueError: rank cannot exceed the number of rows or columns.

If I run that many times, it does produce a matrix -- perhaps 5-10% of the time.

The documentation says it randomly generates the rank, but it does not seem smart enough to generate a rank that is possible for the given dimensions.

(If I specify the rank, the function does work as expected. But the documentation seems to indicate that you can omit that and it will choose a rank for you.)
