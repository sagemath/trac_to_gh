`RootSystem` is currently creating memory leaks in the following way:

Upon creating a root system, say of type B3, this line:

```
self.dual = RootSystem(self._cartan_type.dual(), as_dual_of=self);
```
causes the B3 root system to be used as a key in the `UniqueRepresentation` of the C3 root system (I call it so, but note it is the dual of the B3, which will be different than the honest C3 root system), which is a strong reference that can never be deleted. Moreover, the B3 root system then holds a (strong) reference to the C3 root system, so the C3 root system never gets collected either.

Some data:

```
sage: from collections import Counter
sage: import gc
sage: gc.collect()
349
sage: pre = {id(a) for a in gc.get_objects()}
sage: get_memory_usage()
8697.9453125

....:     RS = RootSystem(['A', n])
....:
sage: gc.collect()

One possible workaround is to not accept a root system as input, but instead a boolean. Then when it creates the dual root system, and then explicitly sets the `dual` attribute of the dual root system to `self`.

Hi Travis!

I am sure there are plenty of other similar situations of cross-referencing parents (e.g. in `SymmetricFunctions`). How critical do you think this specific situation is? I mean: do you foresee people creating thousands of different root systems in the same Sage session?

Cheers,
                              Nicolas

Questions:
- do you really need `RootSystem` to be `UniqueRepresentation` (i.e., do these things really participate in the coercion framework)? I would think the "parent" component of a `RootSystem` is only there because mathematically it looks like something that has elements, not as something whose elements will be interacting with elements from other parents.
- do you really need `RootSystem` to hold any references to other root systems? Doesn't the `UniqueRepresentation` cache provide fast enough access?
- can you key the `UniqueRepresentation` via lower level information, e.g., a sequence of integers or so? By changing to a `UniqueFactory` instead, you could still offer the same interface.
Especially because these things probably happen all over the place, I think it's really good that you're trying to see what kind of solution strategies work well. I'm sure your experience in this can be used in lots of other places.
