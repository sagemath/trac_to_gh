Two newforms that are identical but live in different parents (spaces of cusp forms for `Gamma0` versus `Gamma1`, or with versus without character) should be regarded as equal, but currently are not:

```
sage: f = Newforms(Gamma1(11), 2)[0]; f
q - 2*q^2 - q^3 + 2*q^4 + q^5 + O(q^6)
sage: g = Newforms(Gamma0(11), 2)[0]; g
q - 2*q^2 - q^3 + 2*q^4 + q^5 + O(q^6)
sage: f == g
False
```

```
sage: f = Newforms(DirichletGroup(4)[1], 5)[0]; f
q - 4*q^2 + 16*q^4 - 14*q^5 + O(q^6)
sage: g = Newforms(Gamma1(4), 5)[0]; g
q - 4*q^2 + 16*q^4 - 14*q^5 + O(q^6)
sage: f == g
False
```
This came up in [#18061 comment:15](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/18061#comment:15).  The current version of the `__eq__` method was written in #18068; I did not know about this bug then.

Comparison of modular forms of type `ModularFormElement` living in different parents is broken as well (see e.g. [#18068 comment:9](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/18068#comment:9)), but this should probably dealt with on a different ticket, by properly implementing coercion for modular forms.
