This needs two upstream patches, one which is accepted in master and [api_mangle.patch](https://github.com/cython/cython/pull/374)

We also clean up where possible. In particular:
1. drop support for i386 CPUs without MMX.
2. remove `set_sage_signal_handler_message()` which is no longer used and not needed since `sig_error()`.

Cython generates the file `interrupt_api.h`. If you empty the `build` directory, the file will be regenerated just like all the other files in the `build` directory.

You are right, it *is* only generated when `interrupt.pyx` is Cythonized.

That's not a problem however: if you delete the `build` directory, then `interrupt.pyx` will be Cythonized and the file will be generated.

I really don't understand your problem.

Deleting the `src/build` directory in Sage is the same as `make clean` in a typical software package. And when you do `make clean`, you have to rebuild everything if you do `make` later.

And when you *don't* delete the `build` directory, Cython+distutils has proper dependency checking: only needed files are rebuilt.

I'll surely open a follow up ticket about that `build` directory question once I have figured out to deal with it. I am not completely sure you have totally broken all "global" sage install and whether or not making those install carry at least a fragment of the build folder will fix it properly.
Who else needs to have their build folder kept?
It joins a basket of issues that I have duct-taped in sage-on-gentoo for years to have doctest and spyx files to work properly. If I had spent more time on fixing the installation of sage headers and various auxiliary files rather than the duct tape we wouldn't be there today.

That's a sample

And `.pxd`/`.pxi` files also I guess...

It wouldn't be too hard to install all needed files, it's just that somebody has to do it.
