<a id='comment:6'></a>A different issue, but it might be related:

```
sage: F=sum((i+1)*x^i for i in [0..20])
sage: G=sum(Zmod(7)(i+1)*x^i for i in [0..20])
sage: F*Zmod(7)(1) - G
x^19 + 2*x^18 + 0*x^13 + 0*x^6
sage: G*Zmod(7)(1) - G
0
```
so there seems to be something fishy with symbolic multiplication involving integers and elements of Z/n in general. It's not just a zero-divisor problem.

It's not just powers either:

```
sage: V=[SR.var("x%s"%i) for i in [0..20]]
sage: F=sum((i+1)*V[i] for i in [0..20])
sage: G=sum(Zmod(7)(i+1)*V[i] for i in [0..20])
sage: sage: F*Zmod(7)(1)-G
-x0 + 0*x13 + 6*x14 + 0*x20 + 3*x3 + 0*x6
sage: F-G 
14*x13 + 21*x20 + 7*x6
```
The last one is correct, since the terms with x6, x20 and x13 are really missing from G. This illustrates why mixing characteristics in SR is always going to be a mess (even if non-zero characteristic works properly otherwise).

Really? I understood that you were not sure if GCC 4.6 was in fact sufficient. But if you are, that's fine for me.

Note that, for various reasons, we actually do not support GCC 4.6 in Sage, which would make GCC 4.7 the minimum.

If you're willing to go ahead with this, you should:
1. write to `sage-devel` explaining why you want C++11 support and that this means requiring GCC 4.7.
2. create a ticket for requiring C++11 and GCC 4.7 in Sage.
3. create a ticket for upgrading Pynac to the version and make it depend on the ticket in 2.

This both now gives a `TypeError` in pynac master, equivalently to `GF(7)(1) + GF(9)(1)` and `GF(7)(3) + GF(9)(3)`.

The ticket should doctest this as soon as pynac is upgraded to 0.6.4
