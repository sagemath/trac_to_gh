Plenty of bugs have been reported for the interaction with numpy:
- #8426: polynomial * constant does not work if constant is a numpy type
- #8949: symbolic functions dont work with numpy.int32
- #9769: symbolic function do not work with numpy.int64 arguments
- #13386: comparison of Sage integer with Numpy integer
- #15695: Coercion problems between numpy and sage floats
- #17758: Intervals and numpy floats do not compare correctly
- #17865: get rid of _native_coercion_ranks_inv and _native_coercion_ranks

We solve them all by defining coercions of numpy integers to `ZZ`, numpy floating to `RDF` and numpy complex floating to `CDF`. Also, coercion between numerical types (in `sage.structure.coerce`) are now done directly via the addition. In particular, all of this used to fail

```
sage: import numpy

sage: f(t) = t^2
sage: f(numpy.int32('1'))
1

sage: sin(numpy.int32(10))
sin(10)

sage: 123 == numpy.int32(123)
True

sage: 1j + numpy.float(2)
2.00000000000000 + 1.00000000000000*I
sage: parent(_)
Complex Field with 53 bits of precision

sage: RIF(1) <= numpy.float64(2.0)
True 
```

Some of them depend on modifying some internal in numpy and will not be solved here:
- #8824: Make it so that numpy datatypes are integrated into the coercion model

This is because the addition is handled by numpy and not by the rational. Simlarly

```
sage: import numpy
sage: numpy.int64('1') + 1
2
sage: parent(_)
<type 'numpy.int64'>
```
There is a comment somewhere that this can be an upstream request.

I see. It doesn't use the Sage coercion framework at all.

Could you clarify this in the docstring when you write this example?

<a id='comment:35'></a>My comments (all easy to fix):

1. Conversion `numpy.floating` -> `QQ` should use `RR` directly, instead of `numpy.floating` -> `RDF` which then converts to `RR`.

2. The reference to #15965 is wrong.

3. In `src/sage/rings/real_double.pyx`, I would prefer to split up `if S is ZZ or S is QQ or S is RLF or (isinstance(S, RealField_class) and S.prec() >= 53)` in several cases, just like for `CDF` (in particular, if the precision is too small, we can return `None` immediately).

4. Python considers `bool` a subclass of `int`, so

```
issubclass(py_type, int) or issubclass(py_type, long) or issubclass(py_type, bool)
```
can be replaced by

```
issubclass(py_type, int) or issubclass(py_type, long)
```

5. In doctests, please replace `1jr` by the more natural `I` (unless you have a good reason to not do this)

6. In `NumpyToSRMorphism.__init__`, could you raise a `TypeError` if `numpy_type` doesn't satisfy any of the `issubclass()` checks (and add a doctest for this case). Also, the second `if` should better be an `elif`.

sage: numpy.int16(1) + 1.0
2.0
sage: type(_)
<type 'numpy.float64'>
sage: 1.0 + numpy.int16(1)
2.00000000000000
sage: type(_)

But the canonical coercion is fine since we do have a coercion from numpy types to real numbers.
