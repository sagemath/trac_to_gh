Normal form games have well defined polytope representations 'best response polyhedra' (this is the basis of the Lemke Howson algorithm). It would be good to take advantage of the Polytope class in Sage to generate these polytopes (via the LP perhaps?).

Details for this can be found in 
[Algorithmic Game Theory Handbook](http://www.cambridge.org/journals/nisan/downloads/Nisan_Non-printable.pdf), namely, (3.4) on p. 57, and also most documentation on the Lemke Howson algorithm.
