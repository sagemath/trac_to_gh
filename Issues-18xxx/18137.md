I hate it that we do not appear in comparisons like the following, just because we are slower than the worst library `:-P`

http://graph-tool.skewed.de/performance

With this branch we can compute the betweenness centrality in Sage with a decent speed.

Nathann

P.S.: The version of the code that deals with rational instead of floats has been removed because it is *much* slower (60x in some cases), and because I did not see how to make the two coexist without copy/pasting most of the code.

It would not be much faster, because most of what this array would contain is zeroes (bint is an int in memory). Plus the bottleneck is float computation in this case `:-/`

> - You could add a doctest to compare the result of your implementation with networkx


There is one, isn't there? In `centrality.pyx`. The one with a "tolerance" flag.

> - You could pre-compute the `((n-1)*(n-2))`, although its minor improvement.


I don't think that it is worth it. Save a linear number of multiplications after all this work, really?.. `:-P`

> - You could add `cdef double x`


Done.

> - Variables `k` and `d` are not used.


Done.

> - You wrote `from centrality import centrality_betweenness`. Shouldn't it be `from sage.graphs.centrality import centrality_betweenness` ?


They are in the same folder, so it works. It is even more robust as a result, as we can move them wherever we want and the path does not change.

I also changed a Cython flag which checks for exceptions when doing float divisions.

<a id='comment:12'></a>Hello,

> The advantage of using rationals is that it was exact!


And this is the very reason why I wrote both implementations.

I am not so sure that it is a very big problem, however, as the algorithm will not add noise to noise like it can happen for PDE computations.

The current version of `centrality_betweenness`, from **NetworkX** shipped with Sage, also computes on floats (in Python):

```
    sage: import networkx
    sage: networkx.algorithms.centrality.betweenness._accumulate_basic??
```

I wanted to check how **Boost** does it, but I was not able to locate the source code (God, how can anyone read those files???). 

(15 minutes later)

Here it is! Line 338 of:

http://boost.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/boost/boost/boost/graph/betweenness_centrality.hpp?annotate=1.2.6.1

So the answer is that "it depends of dependency_type", which is.. A template.

For **igraph** it is apparently a double too:
https://github.com/igraph/igraph/blob/master/src/centrality.c#L1685
https://github.com/igraph/igraph/blob/master/src/centrality.c#L1804

For **graph-tools** (last of the libraries compared on the link in the ticket's description) it is apparently a double too, though I can't make sure for I do not find the `get_betweenness` function

https://git.skewed.de/count0/graph-tool/blob/master/src/graph_tool/centrality/__init__.py#L326

Sooooooo please don't just limit your argumentation to "not exact=BAD". I care about this, and for this reason I implemented both (which definitely took more than a couple of minutes as you can imagine), but I do believe that for this kind of computations working on floats is not that bad, for I know when the divisions occur and, well, we do not mind much.

I would personally be very happy to have both in Sage, with an easy flag to switch from one implementation to the other. If you just checkout the first of my commits you will see that only one variable need to be changed so that double become rationals. My trouble is that using Cython's preprocessor instructions requires to run `sage -b`, and we do not want that.

I would also like to NOT have the same code copy/pasted twice, and to not pay for the 'if' inside of the loops.

I would be happy to have both if there is a free (in terms of computations) way to handle both at once, and a cheap (in term of lines of code) way to have both.

So far I did not find any way out, and I thought that the best was to have what everybody seemds interested in: computations on double (we can also turn them into 'long double' if necessary).

Nathann

P.S.: I uploaded a commit with both versions so that it will be available somewhere (and not on my computer only) if we ever need that implementation. I did that on purpose, to have it archived somewhere.

Do not oversimplify. My argumentation was "not exact => extra care needed". Floats are wonderful because they are very fast.

> And this is the very reason why I wrote both implementations.


Would be interesting to investigate (experimentally) the error propagation.

> I am not so sure that it is a very big problem, however, as the algorithm will not add noise to noise like it can happen for PDE computations.


Already summing (a lot of) floating point numbers create problems. Simple (not so dramatic) example

```
sage: sum(1.r/n for n in range(1,10000000))
16.69531126585727
sage: sum(1.r/n for n in range(9999999,0,-1))
16.695311265859964
```
If you mix that with division, it is of course even worse.

> I care about this, and for this reason I implemented both (which definitely took more than a couple of minutes as you can imagine), but I do believe that for this kind of computations working on floats is not that bad, for I know when the divisions occur and, well, we do not mind much.


I also believe so, but it would be better if we were sure and the documentation mentioned it. Something like: if you do have a graph with `m` vertices and `n` edges than the worst case is an error of `function(m,n)`.

<a id='comment:14'></a>Hello !

I agree that float operations make errors, but I do not know how to evaluate it. I expect the relative error to stay very very small in those cases, and in the graphs that are of interest for the networks community.

Would you know a trick to have both implementations available in the code (without recompilation)? I do not think that we can have 'real templates' in Cython, can we?

It is cool without being great. There are several limitations that you will only notice if you write some code yourself. In particular, the templating forced me to introduce a pure C function.

```
sage: g = graphs.RandomGNP(100,.2)
sage: cb0 = g.centrality_betweenness(exact=0)

The mantissa of the double is `2^(-53) ~ 10^(-16)` and the numbers are about `0.01` which makes the error affect only the one or two last bits.

<a id='comment:22'></a>Hello,

you should add the description of parameter `exact` in the cython `centrality_betweenness` method.

It does matter much, but you could specify the return type of the C method (dict).

otherwise, the method is working perfectly on my mac ;)

<a id='comment:29'></a>Hello,
this is my first comment: please, forgive me if I make  mistakes due to my lack of experience, and I am willing to receive  suggestions.
First of all, congrats for the excellent running time!  Some comments follow (I think the first is important, while the others  are only "style" comments):

1. bitset_union(seen,seen,next_layer):  this operation takes time O(n), and it is performed at each layer. This  means that, if there are many layers, then the running time might be  O(n<sup>2</sup>) to perform a BFS, and O(mn<sup>2</sup>) overall (for  instance, if the input is a path). I would change the code by memorizing  the distances from the source, and making tests with distances.  Example: it takes more time to analyze a path of length 10,000 than a  G(N,p) random graph with N=10,000 and p=0.001 (with about 100,000  edges).
2. Only to improve readability of the code: why do  you use layer_current_beginning, layer_current_end, and layer_next_end? I  would rather use a variable for the start of the queue and another for  the end of the queue, as in a standard BFS. Is there any particular  reason why you do not do it?
3. In the comment part, Section "ALGORITHM", I would add something to explain what happens if k=0.

Hope it is useful!

Michele

Your comments are rather good, actually.

>  1. bitset_union(seen,seen,next_layer):  this operation takes time O(n), and it is performed at each layer. This  means that, if there are many layers, then the running time might be  O(n<sup>2</sup>) to perform a BFS, and O(mn<sup>2</sup>) overall (for  instance, if the input is a path).

HMmm.. Well, indeed when thinking of a long path this may actually make a big difference. Do you feel like giving it a try and telling us about the difference?

I believe that it may make performances worse in some case, though I do not know by how much. Storing everything as a bitset (instead of storing distances) also makes things more compact in memory, and the cpu cache works better. Though again, I have no idea how much time that represents.

I do not understand your question. What do you mean by "a variable for the start of the que and another for the end of the queue"? This is precisely what `layer_current_beginning` and  `layer_current_end` do, in my understanding.

In this case the sum is empty, and thus equal to 0. Do you think that it should be emphasized?

This  means that, if there are many layers, then the running time might be  O(n<sup>2</sup>) to perform a BFS, and O(mn<sup>2</sup>) overall (for  instance, if the input is a path). I would change the code by memorizing  the distances from the source, and making tests with distances.  Example: it takes more time to analyze a path of length 10,000 than a  G(N,p) random graph with N=10,000 and p=0.001 (with about 100,000  edges).

Well, it seems you have already done it! :-)

> > 1. Only to improve readability of the code: why do  you use layer_current_beginning, layer_current_end, and layer_next_end? I  would rather use a variable for the start of the queue and another for  the end of the queue, as in a standard BFS. Is there any particular  reason why you do not do it?

My point is that I do not like the nested loops:

```
while layer_current_beginning<layer_current_end:
    for j in range(layer_current_beginning,layer_current_end):
```
I would rather use only the `while` loop, by replacing `j` with `layer_current_beginning`, and adding `layer_current_beginning++` at the end of the `while`. However, I realize now that, if you do not want to store distances, this is probably not possible, because you have two `for` loops. So, maybe the best is to leave it as it is.

That's what I meant, but if you think it's not worth doing it, no problem!
