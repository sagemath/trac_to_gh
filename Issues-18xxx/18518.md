Currently, the method `Polynomial.denominator` does not work with very high-degree (sparse) polynomial:

```python
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(QQ, sparse=True)
sage: p = x^(2^100) - 1/2
sage: p.denominator()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
OverflowError: cannot fit 'long' into an index-sized integer
```

This comes from the method using `self.list()` instead of `self.coefficients()`. I correct this and obtain:

```python
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(QQ, sparse=True)
sage: p = x^(2^100) - 1/2
sage: p.denominator()
2
```

Keywords: **polynomial**
