A lot of polytopes constructors in `sage.geometry.polyhedron.library`. For example

1. The Rhombicuboctahedron does not return what it should (as Python division was thought as Sage integer divisions). There is in the code

```
verts = [ [-3/2, -1/2, -1/2], [-3/2, -1/2, 1/2], [-3/2, 1/2, -1/2],
...
```

2. The `great_rhombicuboctahedron` is defined over `QQ` but it should be defined over `QQ[sqrt(2)]`! There are in two places rough approximation of sqrt(2) in the code

```
v1 = QQ(131739771357/54568400000)   # ~ sqrt(2) + 1 but actually 2 due to Python division
v2 = QQ(104455571357/27284200000)   # ~ 2 sqrt(2) but actually 3 due to Python division
```
Instead, we should use the `base_ring` argument (with appropriate defaults) and use `base_ring(2).sqrt()` instead.

3. The functions unrelated to construction of Polytopes are moved out of the class `Polytopes`:
   - `Polytopes.orthonormal_1`, `Polytopes.project_1` will be renamed respectively `zero_sum_projection` and `project_points`
   - the one line `Polytopes._pfunc` is just removed

While we're at it, remove the deprecations from #11634.

During the process I discovered two annoying bugs:
- #18214 Bug in volume computation of polyhedron
- #18220 Bug when creating a polyhedron with coefficients in RR
Moreover, we can get a great speed up with the following because many polytopes have now coordinates in a quadratic number fields:
- #18215: Huge speed up for hash of quadratic number field elements
- #18226: Native `_mpfr_` method on quadratic number field elements

Depends on #18211

> Vincent: the diff of your main commit is very, very very hard to read. Could you split in order to make it easier to understand?

Not sure. It is basically a complete rewrite. I added a ton of documentation, and modify many functions to fit with the actual definition!

Here are some comments. Please understand that doing everything at once makes things *MUCH* harder to understand for the reviewer.

Improving the implementation and improving the doc could have been two separate commits. The work that you do on each function could have been a separate commit. Removing deprecations could have been a separate commit. There are also things that anybody can review (only code) and things for which you need to be used to the tools you deal with.

- The projection is not the orthogona projection I expected:

  ```
  sage: sage: zero_sum_projection(3)*vector([1,0,0])
  (0.7071067811865475, 0.4082482904638631)
  ```
  You can either change the matrix or emphasize in the docstring that the
  projection is not unique. Something like "returns a (d-1)xd matrix of rank d
  whose kernel contain (1,...,1). At first sight, I expected the function to
  return a matrix of dimensions `d\times d`. I updated the docstring on this
  matter.

- I do not understand the paragraph in the doc of `project_points` but that's
  probably because I don't know the maths behind.

- Compatible?

  ```
  This projection is the only one compatible with the restriction to the
  first coordinates
  ```

- You should probably add a `# tol`
  after this

  ```
  Its volume is `\sqrt{d+1} / d!`
  ```
  Or even better, check that the difference between the two is 0
  (still, with some tolerance)

- At this point I still do not know if it is very wise to use this definition of
  the projection, but it would be cool if every function which uses this
  projection (like !Simplex) could redirect toward the matrix function. This way
  people would have a chance to learn what exactly they get as a result.

- What about this error?

  ```
  sage: polytopes.icosahedron(base_ring=QQ)
  ...
  TypeError: unable to convert 1/4*sqrt(5) + 1/4 to a rational
  ```

I added a small commit at public/18213

Which one did you expected? I improved the documentation.

I see. But I am really not confortable in moving this to `matrix.<tab>` as well. One possibility is to move it back to `polytopes.<tab>`. What do you think?

Is it not clear enough? The coordinates of the icosahedron need to be defined in `QQ[sqrt(5)]`, hence the error. The following is ok (but very slow, ~3secs on my computer)

```
sage: I = polytopes.icosahedron(base_ring=AA)
```
Apart adding your example to the documentation, I do not see much what I can do (see the last commit). A deprecation?

Hello,

> Which one did you expected? I improved the documentation.

Well, I expected an orthogonal projection on this hyperplane. And I probably expected the base of the hyperplane to be the projection of d-1 vectors of the base from the original space I guess.

All I was suggesting in the message above was to add a link in the doc. The message you added in `project_points` is perfect

```
The projection used is the matrix given by :func:`zero_sum_projection`.
```

To me it should appear whenever there is a 'project' argument in the function.

> Is it not clear enough? The coordinates of the icosahedron need to be defined in `QQ[sqrt(5)]`, hence the error.

Precisely: Could you add somewhere in the doc that the field must contain `QQ(sqrt(5))`?

The description is explicit in the doc (commit ​fac3cff)

Yes yes now it's good!

It happens several times though. Could you add it in the doc of `base_ring`? You already talk about this field there. It could be something like "If set to None then it will be `QQ[\phi]`, otherwise it must be a field that contains it".

Patchbot should be happy after that.

Some broken doctests in the patchbot's report. Also, can you be sure that the `sqrt(6.) / factorial(5)` are not subject to numerical noise? There is no `#tol` on them right now.

Hi Vincent and Nathann

Just a quick comment, as I'm not sure how useful this will be for general polyhedra: There is a method for lattice polytopes:
`LatticePolytope_PPL` (in `sage.geometry.polyhedron.ppl_lattice_polytope`) has a method `lattice_automorphism_group()`

Cheers,
Jan
