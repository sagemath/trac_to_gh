It is not possible to use (in a straightforward way) univariate polynomial in libgap

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: libgap(x^5+2*x+1)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: libGAP: Error, Variable: 'x' must have a value
```
And multivariate polynomials with either gap or libgap

```
sage: R.<x,y> = ZZ[]
sage: gap(x+y)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: Gap produced error output
sage: libgap(x+y)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: libGAP: Error, Variable: 'x' must have a value
```
The above ticket (partially based on #2420) implement the above conversions.

Note: The conversion from gap/libgap to Sage does not work as well and will be dealt with in #21020.

- coercion between interfaces objects and Sage objects should be one way. So if for a given ring there is a coercion `Sage -> GAP` then it should be the case for every ring that GAP understands.

- The solution I used is precisely what is done with PARI/GP (see for instance the `PariInstance` class in `/sage/libs/pari/pari_instance.pyx`)

- Implementing the function `_coerce_map_from_` would be a useless pain

- *"interface objects"* are only intended for people having a knowledge of the underlying software

Now, if for some specific `GAP` object you want to lift it back to Sage then you can either use conversion (i.e. `MyParent(my_interface_object)`) or use the `.sage()` method

```
sage: pari(13).sage()
13
sage: parent(_)
Integer Ring
sage: gap(13).sage()
13
sage: parent(_)
Integer Ring
sage: libgap(13).sage()
13
sage: parent(_)
Integer Ring
```

The problem with unlimited coercion maps is that we get a bad (IMO incorrect) error message (this is on `develop`):

```sage
sage: cat = Algebras(QQ).WithBasis().FiniteDimensional()
sage: C = CombinatorialFreeModule(QQ, ['x','y','z'], category=cat)
sage: J1 = JordanAlgebra(C, names=['a','b','c'])
sage: J1.an_element() + gap(2)

There should be a conversion, but I think a coercion is far too strong.
Perhaps we should ask sage-devel?

It is a good idea to discuss what should we do concerning coercion and external softwares/libraries.

Concerning this ticket, it is very handy that the coercion always go from Sage to third party interfaces

```
sage: x = polygen(ZZ)
sage: p = x^3 + 2*x + 1
sage: p(pari(2))
13
sage: type(_)
<type 'sage.libs.pari.gen.gen'>
```

Making explicit the subset of Sage parents that can actually be represented in a given interface might indeed be much better. But certainly harder to write and maintain. The way I choose is the lazy one. The error messages you mentioned are wrong but should never appear if you restrict to "pure Sage functions". If desirable for pari/gap, I guess that implementing it belongs to another ticket.
