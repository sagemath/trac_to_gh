```
It is not possible to use (in a straightforward way) univariate polynomial in libgap

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: libgap(x^5+2*x+1)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: libGAP: Error, Variable: 'x' must have a value
```
And multivariate polynomials with either gap or libgap

```
sage: R.<x,y> = ZZ[]
sage: gap(x+y)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: Gap produced error output
sage: libgap(x+y)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: libGAP: Error, Variable: 'x' must have a value
```
The above ticket (partially based on #2420) implement the above conversions.

Note: The conversion from gap/libgap to Sage does not work as well and will be dealt with in #21020.

- coercion between interfaces objects and Sage objects should be one way. So if for a given ring there is a coercion `Sage -> GAP` then it should be the case for every ring that GAP understands.

- The solution I used is precisely what is done with PARI/GP (see for instance the `PariInstance` class in `/sage/libs/pari/pari_instance.pyx`)

- Implementing the function `_coerce_map_from_` would be a useless pain

- *"interface objects"* are only intended for people having a knowledge of the underlying software

Now, if for some specific `GAP` object you want to lift it back to Sage then you can either use conversion (i.e. `MyParent(my_interface_object)`) or use the `.sage()` method

```
sage: pari(13).sage()
13
sage: parent(_)
Integer Ring
sage: gap(13).sage()
13
sage: parent(_)
Integer Ring
sage: libgap(13).sage()
13
sage: parent(_)
Integer Ring
```

The problem with unlimited coercion maps is that we get a bad (IMO incorrect) error message (this is on `develop`):

```sage
sage: cat = Algebras(QQ).WithBasis().FiniteDimensional()
sage: C = CombinatorialFreeModule(QQ, ['x','y','z'], category=cat)

sage: J1.an_element() + pari(2)

PariError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
...
PariError: incorrect type in gtos [integer expected] (t_POL)
```
There should be a conversion, but I think a coercion is far too strong.
Perhaps we should ask sage-devel?

It is a good idea to discuss what should we do concerning coercion and external softwares/libraries.

Concerning this ticket, it is very handy that the coercion always go from Sage to third party interfaces

```
sage: x = polygen(ZZ)
sage: p = x^3 + 2*x + 1
sage: p(pari(2))
13
sage: type(_)
<type 'sage.libs.pari.gen.gen'>
```

Making explicit the subset of Sage parents that can actually be represented in a given interface might indeed be much better. But certainly harder to write and maintain. The way I choose is the lazy one. The error messages you mentioned are wrong but should never appear if you restrict to "pure Sage functions". If desirable for pari/gap, I guess that implementing it belongs to another ticket.

And this is not the only wrong thing with interfaces. The default implementation of conversion between Sage and the interfaces etc relies on string representations and global variables... which is of course unreliable

Well, since we already do a catch-all coercion for `pari` and we got no response from sage-devel, I can tolerate the current state of the coercion.
