The pro I see for this is:
* you have to put the function signature in a pxd/pyx file anyway so the h file is superfluous.
Maybe a con:
* the pro above is not that strong.

I don't have any strong opinion on this and the removal looks ok.
Maybe Nathann has one.

Same here. It looks cleaner, and I like a priori any patch that mostly removes code.
