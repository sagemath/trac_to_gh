Thanks for implementing this. I have only minor comments (1&2), plus some questions (3&4) for all cc'd.

Jake,
1. Have a look at the python conventions page [http://www.sagemath.org/documentation/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#python-code-style](http://www.sagemath.org/documentation/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#python-code-style), as there are a few (minor) violations. E.g., "*from (r-1,c)*" should read "*from (r-1, c).*"

2. It might be nice to add "Schensted" or some such keyword in the one-sentence-description of `reverse_bump()`'s docstring.

All,
3. Does it make sense to implement an `is_semistandard()` method?

4. Should we move `.bump()` and `.reverse_bump()` to `SemistandardTableaux` class? As defined, `.bump()` will produce *something* for any tableau *T*, but it will not be the inverse of `.reverse_bump()` unless *T* is semistandard. In the opposite direction, `.reverse_bump()` assumes that *T* is semistandard. There is no inverse to the map `.bump()` as presently defined. Regardless, in the code

```python
if not (self.is_row_increasing(weak=True) and self.is_column_increasing(weak=False)):
    raise ValueError("Reverse bumping is only defined for semistandard tableaux")
```
perhaps the error should be `TypeError` or `NotImplementedError`?

Thanks for the review, Aaron.

1. Done.

2. Done.

3. Sure, done. Relatedly, would it be good to deprecate `is_row_strict()` in favor of `is_row_increasing(weak=False)` and likewise for columns? It seems cleaner to have a single function which can test for both the strict and weak conditions.

4. I think `.bump()` should behave the same way as `.reverse_bump()` with regards to type-checking, whatever we decide regarding which class to keep it in. So even if we don't move it, I think `.bump()` should probably raise an error on non-semistandard tableaux.

Hi Jake,

Great that you made so much progress since the Sage Days!

I would either point `is_row_strict` (and similarly `is_column_strict`) to your method with the appropriate specification of `weak` or actually introduce the option `weak` in these methods and not introduce a new method (of course, having increasing in the name is more appropriate than strict).

Also, have a look at `RSK` and `RSK_inverse` since these must at least implicitly use inverse bumping.

Best,

Anne

Here's my review then. If you are OK with my changes, please set the ticket to positive_review.

I fear I don't know cython well enough to tell whether moving the checks into a .pyx is a good idea. Some people use tableaux for things other than integers.

I have replaced your "outer corner" by "corner" now, though I see the logic behind your use of "outer" (unfortunately, for some other people, "outer corner" means "cocorner", aka "addable cell"). Feel free to add a definition of "corner" if you think this makes confusion possible.

Darij, thanks for the changes!

Re: "outer/inner corner", I was using the terms in the same sense as in `skew_tableau.py`, which has `inner_corners` and `outer_corners` functions (both of which return "subtractable cells").

Given the risk of confusion, I'm fine with leaving it as just "corner" as you set it, since then `reverse_bump` is compatible with `Tableau.corners`.
