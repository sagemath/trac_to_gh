They will have to update it. Exactly as they would have to if we deprecate them for a year before that (and assuming that they update and run sage using those files during the next year).

Do you think that adding deprecation warnings, which contain a message indicating how the code should be rewritten, would help in this case?

I believe that the feature implemented by `file_to_worksheet` is already more easily available through the notebook interface (or the cloud) and less likely to be broken. For the refcount it is a bit more questionable, but then I thought that it would not be a problem as a guy who needs this kind of feature knows what he is doing.

Tell us what you think,

I don't think formally deprecating these modules is worth the effort, but please feel free to do it if you want. Like Nathann, I thought that deprecations only were required for the more easily accessible stuff--otherwise, pretty much every change to sage would require a deprecation period!
