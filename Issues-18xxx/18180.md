I believe that the custom is to only deprecate things which are somehow accessible in the global namespace, and that we can remove/change whatever has to be imported manually.

> What if third party code uses some of this?

They will have to update it. Exactly as they would have to if we deprecate them for a year before that (and assuming that they update and run sage using those files during the next year).

Do you think that adding deprecation warnings, which contain a message indicating how the code should be rewritten, would help in this case?

I believe that the feature implemented by `file_to_worksheet` is already more easily available through the notebook interface (or the cloud) and less likely to be broken. For the refcount it is a bit more questionable, but then I thought that it would not be a problem as a guy who needs this kind of feature knows what he is doing.

Tell us what you think,

The safe way is to deprecate first, delete later, precisely because we don't know what is used "in the wild". I don't see a compelling reason to do anything else.

I believe that the particular deletions here are probably safe to do now, but a deprecation now followed by deletion later would be even safer.

I don't know this custom. Certainly `sage.rings.integer_ring_python.iterator(...)` can be run without an import, just like the deprecated function `sage.combinat.alternating_sign_matrix.to_monotone_triangle` (for example).

I don't think formally deprecating these modules is worth the effort, but please feel free to do it if you want. Like Nathann, I thought that deprecations only were required for the more easily accessible stuff--otherwise, pretty much every change to sage would require a deprecation period!
