Thanks for looking at this Nathann!
The phrasing "an LP variable" is indeed correct. It's a bit peculiar in English, but when writing an acronym such as 'LP' we use 'an' or 'a' depending on how the acronym is pronounced when spoken rather than how it's spelled.
Since 'LP' is spoken as "ell pee", we write "an LP" since the pronunciation begins with a vowel sound.
There's a few more examples of how this works at http://www.dailywritingtips.com/indefinite-article-with-initialisms/

Hope this clears things up!

"a usual dictionary" is correct and it used to be "an usual dictionary".

Also, the choice of 'a/an' will always be based on the word immediately after it, so it'd be incorrect to base it off 'dictionary' here. In our case, "an usual dictionary" is wrong since the word after 'an' ('usual') starts with a consonant sound when spoken.

Hellooooooo,

> Also, the choice of 'a/an' will always be based on the word immediately after it,

Always with the word immediately after it. Makes sense, I'll remember it.

> so it'd be incorrect to base it off 'dictionary' here. In our case, "an usual dictionary" is wrong since the word after 'an' ('usual') starts with a consonant sound when spoken.

Whaaaaaaaaaaat? `O_o`

This I do not get: why do you say that "usual" starts with a consonant? For me it starts with the vowel 'u', and to me 'an usual' flows better than 'a usual'? Actually, I pronounce "an usual" exctly as I would pronounce "unusual". Perhaps that's what is meant to be avoided? `;-)`

P.S.: Thanks for your help with that. It is a bit "all I want to know about english but were too afraid to ask" `:-D`

Happy to be of help Nathann!
