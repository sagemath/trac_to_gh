Compiles & works. However, should it check for argument instead of depending on `DyckWord` to do it? I dislike getting "wrong argument for `foo`" after asking Sage "give me a `bar`".

For posets one can say `Posets.RandomPoset(5, 0.3)` or `Posets(5).random_element()`; latter is extremely slow for posets of size 7 or so. But I don't know how to unify random functions like these.
