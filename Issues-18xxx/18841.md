. The giacpy 0.4.8 interface has a bad sig_on() in Pygen `__iter__`
. dependencies files were missing for giac and giacpy

the new upstream tar ball of giacpy is:
[http://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~frederic.han/xcas/giacpy/sage/giacpy-0.5.1.tar.gz](http://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~frederic.han/xcas/giacpy/sage/giacpy-0.5.1.tar.gz)

The giac 1.2.0-15 or later upstream source has an interesting fix for groebner basis: in 1.2.0-13 the answer of gbasis could contain some extra null terms.

the giac tarball to put in upstream/ is here. (it was generated with spkg-src from giac 1.2.0-19)

<a id='comment:2'></a>Additionally an evaluation bug was fixed
Some particular symbols of the SR such as sqrt could gives problems if they were not evaluated.
Ex:
`libgiac(sqrt(5)/x).factor()` was OK
but
`(sqrt(5)/libgiac(x)).factor()` was 0
