In Sage 6.7:

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2 + x + 1)
sage: G = DirichletGroup(13, base_ring=K)
sage: Gamma1(13).dimension_modular_forms(2, G[1])
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: No compatible natural embeddings found for Complex Lazy Field and Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^2 + x + 1
```
This is because `dimension_eis()` tries to convert the character `G[1]` into a Dirichlet group with an incompatible base ring.  This was fixed for `dimension_cusp_forms()` in #8630; we fix `dimension_eis()` in a similar way.

**Keywords:** Dirichlet character dimension formula

Sorry, I mistakenly put an example in the ticket description that does not exhibit the bug.  It should read `dimension_modular_forms` (or `dimension_eis`) instead of `dimension_cusp_forms`.  I fixed the description.

The line `eps = DirichletGroup(N, K)(eps)` doesn't change the base ring of `eps`, just the level.
