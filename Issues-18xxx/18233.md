```
The class `SymmetricFunctionAlgebra_generic` already has a `coproduct_by_coercion` so the coproduct works after establishing a coercion path.  However, the product does not work without implementing one of `product_on_basis`, `_multiply`, `_multiply_basis`,  `product_by_coercion` (the precedence order is established in `categories.magmatic_algebras`).

By implementing `product_by_coercion` in `SymmetricFunctionAlgebra_generic`, the product will be implemented once a coercion path is established.
