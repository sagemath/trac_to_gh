Here is how the graph in your example looks like on my machine (when I try `view`):

https://www.dropbox.com/s/vbdivvwct0ou9gk/sage-18285-view.png?dl=0

Is this a problem with this patch, with the graph framework (which is seeing changes these days), with graphics, or with dot2tex?

Hi,

I was not quick enough to review to ticket! Darij was too fast!

I will definitely be using this in the future, thanks Travis!

I had a suggestion of extension for the ticket. I guess now I'll call it a follow-up. There is a possible follow-up which could implement the even/odd length braid relations (quotients of the present graph).

This is, in particular, related to the higher Bruhat order, plabic graphs, and subword complexes.

See section 3 of this paper.

[http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.7380](http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.7380)

I'll need this, so I could work on it soon.
