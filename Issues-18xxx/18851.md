Since #18494, we install `.pxd` files but we never remove them. Since Cython automatically looks for `.pxd` files when parsing `.pyx` file, this leads to trouble.

Steps to reproduce:

```
git checkout 551d0f0ab9c7942e4d8d61bc2f18808011698dfb  # ticket 18746
make
git checkout 6.8.beta6
make
```
this gives

```
Error compiling Cython file:
------------------------------------------------------------
...
include 'sage/ext/interrupt.pxi'

from libc.stdint cimport uint8_t

cdef class FastDigraph:
    cdef uint8_t n
                ^
------------------------------------------------------------

sage/graphs/graph_decompositions/fast_digraph.pyx:23:17: C attributes cannot be added in implementation part of extension type defined in a pxd
