The main reason for the introduction of the `.parent()` method was because of `MaximaWrapper` which does not inherit from `Element`. But whatever we do with this method, it is what the function `parent` is doing

```
sage: parent(4r)
<type 'int'>
sage: parent(int)
<type 'type'>
```

And I would not call it a "parent class" since it is the class of the object itself that is considered as a parent. Which makes sense.

By the way, the example you wrote in the description of the ticket used to work in previous versions of Sage?

No. Parent calls are idempontent, type calls are not.

If you care about `Element`s, then `isinstance(foo, Element)` is your friend...

You are making the mistake that everything which has a `parent()` method is an `Element` of some `Parent`.

If it walks like a duck and talks like a duck then it must be a duck.

The issue to me is that `SageObject` walks and talks pretty close to a duck, but it is just a hunter with a toy duck trying to lure you in. I agree with Volker in [comment:2](#comment%3A2) that we should strip `parent` out of `SageObject`.
