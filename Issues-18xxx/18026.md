The main reason for the introduction of the `.parent()` method was because of `MaximaWrapper` which does not inherit from `Element`. But whatever we do with this method, it is what the function `parent` is doing

```
sage: parent(4r)
<type 'int'>
sage: parent(int)
<type 'type'>
```

And I would not call it a "parent class" since it is the class of the object itself that is considered as a parent. Which makes sense.

By the way, the example you wrote in the description of the ticket used to work in previous versions of Sage?

If you care about `Element`s, then `isinstance(foo, Element)` is your friend...

You are making the mistake that everything which has a `parent()` method is an `Element` of some `Parent`.
