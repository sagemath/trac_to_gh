This module contains just one function which is used nowhere in the Sage library. Moreover, it's confusing that often `Field` is imported from `sage.rings.field` while it's actually defined in `sage.rings.ring` (in Cython, so Cython modules can take advantage of that!)

Looking fine and simple. Passes all tests in http://patchbot.sagemath.org/log/18108/Ubuntu/14.04/i686/3.13.0-40-generic/arando/2015-04-03%2001:27:54%20+0100?short

Your arando patchbot run, however, again seems to have problems, modules are not found.
