**Features added**

* PEP 492 (async/await) was implemented.
  See https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0492/

* PEP 448 (Additional Unpacking Generalizations) was implemented.
  See https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0448/

* Support for coverage.py 4.0+ can be enabled by adding the plugin
  "Cython.Coverage" to the ".coveragerc" config file.

* Annotated HTML source pages can integrate (XML) coverage reports.

* Tracing is supported in ``nogil`` functions/sections and module init
  code.

* When generators are used in a Cython module and the module imports the
  modules "inspect" and/or "asyncio", Cython enables interoperability by
  patching these modules during the import to recognise Cython's internal
  generator and coroutine types. This can be disabled by C compiling the
  module with "-D CYTHON_PATCH_ASYNCIO=0" or "-D CYTHON_PATCH_INSPECT=0"

* When generators or coroutines are used in a Cython module, their types
  are registered with the ``Generator`` and ``Coroutine`` ABCs in the
  ``collections`` or ``collections.abc`` stdlib module at import time to
  enable interoperability with code that needs to detect and process Python
  generators/coroutines.  These ABCs were added in CPython 3.5 and are
  available for older Python versions through the ``backports_abc`` module
  on PyPI.  See https://bugs.python.org/issue24018

* Adding/subtracting/dividing/modulus and equality comparisons with
  constant Python floats and small integers are faster.

* Binary and/or/xor/rshift operations with small constant Python integers
  are faster.

* When called on generator expressions, the builtins ``all()``, ``any()``,
  ``dict()``, ``list()``, ``set()``, ``sorted()`` and ``unicode.join()``
  avoid the generator iteration overhead by inlining a part of their
  functionality into the for-loop.

* Keyword argument dicts are no longer copied on function entry when they
  are not being used or only passed through to other function calls (e.g.
  in wrapper functions).

* The ``PyTypeObject`` declaration in ``cpython.object`` was extended.

* ``wraparound()`` and ``boundscheck()`` are available as no-ops in pure
  Python mode.

* Const iterators were added to the provided C++ STL declarations.

* ``NULL`` is allowed as default argument when embedding signatures.
  This fixes ticket 843.

* When compiling with ``--embed``, the internal module name is changed to
  ``__main__`` to allow arbitrary program names, including those that would
  be invalid for modules.  Note that this prevents reuse of the generated
  C code as an importable module.

* External C++ classes that overload the assignment operator can be used.
  Patch by Ian Henriksen.

**Bugs fixed**

* Calling "yield from" from Python on a Cython generator that returned a
  value triggered a crash in CPython.  This is now being worked around.
  See https://bugs.python.org/issue23996

* Language level 3 did not enable true division (a.k.a. float division)
  for integer operands.

* Functions with fused argument types that included a generic 'object'
  fallback could end up using that fallback also for other explicitly
  listed object types.

* Relative cimports could accidentally fall back to trying an absolute
  cimport on failure.

* The result of calling a C struct constructor no longer requires an
  intermediate assignment when coercing to a Python dict.

* C++ exception declarations with mapping functions could fail to compile
  when pre-declared in .pxd files.

* ``cpdef void`` methods are now permitted.

* ``abs(cint)`` could fail to compile in MSVC and used sub-optimal code
  in C++.  Patch by David Vierra, original patch by Michael Enßlin.

* Buffer index calculations using index variables with small C integer
  types could overflow for large buffer sizes.
  Original patch by David Vierra.

* C unions use a saner way to coerce from and to Python dicts.

* When compiling a module ``foo.pyx``, the directories in ``sys.path``
  are no longer searched when looking for ``foo.pxd``.
  Patch by Jeroen Demeyer.

* Memory leaks in the embedding main function were fixed.
  Original patch by Michael Enßlin.

* Some complex Python expressions could fail to compile inside of finally
  clauses.

**Other changes**

* Changed mangling scheme in header files generated by ``cdef api``
  declarations.

This shouldn't have any impact on 32-bit platforms, it just avoids kneecapping the compilation unit from the get-go.

Hello!

Thank you very much for telling me that `using namespace` is bad practice, and for correcting my code in `boost_interface.cpp`.

However, I have used vectors also in Cython, in files `boost_graph.pyx` and `boost_graph.pxd`, and I haven't used namespaces (for instance, by writing `vector` and not `std::vector`). Is it fine? Otherwise, what is the correct way to do it?

Best,

Michele

In Python its ok to import into the module namespace "from libcpp.vector cimport vector". Since there are no `#include` statements this will not cause conflicts in third-party headers. Its only in C++ that

```
using namespace foo;
#include <bar>
```
will then make bar see all of foo's symbols (and potentially trip over some).

Actuall in Cython you have pxi files which behave like #include, but you shouldn't use them if you can avoid it; they are mostly for historical reasons.
