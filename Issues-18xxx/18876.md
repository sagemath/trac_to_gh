Uses Boost to compute Cuthill-McKee and King ordering of vertices: heuristically, these orderings are used to minimize the bandwidth of the graph.

The bandwidth *bw*(*M*) of a matrix *M* is the smallest integer *k* such that all non-zero entries of *M* are at distance *k* from the diagonal. The bandwidth *bw*(*G*) of an undirected graph *G* is the minimum bandwidth of the adjacency matrix of *G*, over all possible relabellings of its vertices.

Since computing the bandwidth of a graph is NP-hard, two heuristics were developed, in order to find a good ordering: [Cuthill-McKee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuthill%E2%80%93McKee_algorithm) and [King](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_58_0/libs/graph/doc/king_ordering.html) ordering. This ticket will include in Sage the implementation of these two heuristics (closing also ticket [#16583](http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13583), which asks for an implementation of Cuthill-McKee).

This is the first draft for the inclusion of the Boost Cuthill-McKee and King orderings. I just wrote a post on sage-devel forum to ask if this algorithm could be useful for matrix analysis, and, in case, how to include it.

Some issues:
- You should return a tuple instead of a list, so `(6, [9, 5, 8, 4, 6, 0, 7, 3, 1, 2])` instead of `[6, [9, 5, 8, 4, 6, 0, 7, 3, 1, 2]]`.
- I don't know how to do, but it would be nice to see `bandwidth_heuristics` in the html output of the bandwidth module.
- Not working with trivial graphs

Probably we need to use types.FunctionType, as we used types.MethodType when we were working with the dominator tree. However, I have troubles finding the right command (and I have very little experience with these routines). Nathann, can you help us?

> - Not working with trivial graphs


Done, and added a doctest!

Note that you can simple write `return bandwidth, [int_to_vertex[result[i]] for i in range(n)]` and it will return a tuple. 

I did the following test and it's working ;)

```
sage: G = Graph(loops=True, multiedges=True)
sage: G.add_edge(0,0,'a')
sage: G.add_edge(0,0,'b')
sage: G.edges()
[(0, 0, 'a'), (0, 0, 'b')]
sage: bandwidth_heuristics(G)
(0, [0])
sage: bandwidth_heuristics(G, algorithm='king')
(0, [0])
```

Let see if Nathann has a good trick for adding the algorithm to the documentation of the bandwidth module.

Hello Michele,

It seems that the easiest solution is to add an index of the methods as done for `vertex_separation` and to point directly to the description of the method in the `boost_graph` module.

Volker,

The develop branch we use is 6.8, and ticket #18868 is not in it. Consequently, and unless we are doing something wrong with git, we don't have any merge conflict (see below [1]).

However, I'm not able to merge ticket #18868 on top of the current develop branch (see below [2])!


So, can I set this ticket to positive review ?

Best,
David.
