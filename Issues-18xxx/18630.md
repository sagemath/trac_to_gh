```
The two functions that query Pynac expressions' `info::flags` only work with `numeric`s and `symbol`s with domain. The rest simply returns `False`:

```
sage: (1-pi).is_negative()
False
sage: (log(1/2)).is_negative()
False
sage: e.is_positive()
False
sage: (e+1).is_positive()
False
sage: (2*e).is_positive()
False
sage: (e^3).is_positive()
False
```

UPDATE: everything above but the first works now.

One logic for `b^e.is_positive()` is `if (e.is_even()) return b.is_real() and b.is_nonzero()` but `is_nonzero` was not implemented for constants until now. This is fixed in https://github.com/pynac/pynac/commit/e92febc468800e4a1457f944bb7a45e9baf0e2f6 and will be in pynac-0.7.15. We can as well put all of these doctests in this ticket too. Thanks for the report!
