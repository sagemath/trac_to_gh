This is a follow-up to,

  https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/HF52TdkH0fw

The author of the rankwidth (rw) package was very helpful in getting the library/executable packaged with autotools. The new release is available here:

  http://pholia.tdi.informatik.uni-frankfurt.de/~philipp/software/rw-0.7.tar.gz

The first big change is that it uses autotools, obviously. So the standard `./configure && make` should work. But more importantly, we can now compile the shared library without the executable, and without the resulting dependency on igraph. If you use the default ./configure:

```
$ ./configure
...
configure: error: Package requirements (igraph >= 0.6) were not met:

No package 'igraph' found
```

But if you pass the `--enable-executable=no` flag,

```
$ ./configure --enable-executable=no
```

it will succeed without igraph and build the library.

These lines should be removed from the `.pxd` file, since they are not in the API of `rw`:

```
subset_t *slots

uint_fast8_t num_vertices
```

Move this inside the `cdef extern from "rankwidth_c/rw.h":` block (removing the stuff in quotes and `uint_fast8`):

```
    ctypedef int uint_fast8_t
    ctypedef int uint_fast32_t
    ctypedef int subset_t
```

Note that Sage is released under GPL version 3 (the only license which is compatible with all standard packages), so if it really was GPL version 2 only, that would be a problem.
