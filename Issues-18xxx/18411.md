The features of `sage.combinat.cartesian_product.CartesianProduct` are now completely integrated into the category framework (see #18290). We remove all occurrences of `CartesianProduct` to either `cartesian_product` or `itertools.product`. We deprecate the `CartesianProduct` from `sage.combinat.cartesian_product`.

In order to support all features of the old class we also:
- move the `__iter__` from `EnumeratedSets.CartesianProducts.ParentMethods` to `Sets.CartesianProducts.ParentMethods`
- allows `cartesian_product` to be called with `list`, `tuple`, `set`, `frozenset`
- make `cartesian_product([])` works
- introduce a function `some_tuples` in `sage.misc.misc` that is intensively used in the testing framework (and incidentally speed up some doc test)
- refine the category of `Set([1,2,3])` to be finite
- implement a (very naive) `random_element` for `Set([1,2,3])`
- implement a (naive) hash for `EnumeratedSetFromIterator`

see also : #15425, #19195
one that can be closed as duplicate: #14224, #19192

Depends on #17411

Hi Fr√©d√©ric,

This was clearly not the way to fix `composition_signed.py`. I removed this change from your commit. The rest of my commits should fix all issues with timed out testing (ie root system and padic) as well as the issue with tableau tuples.

I got into troubles. Combinatorial free modules are too laxist and you discover mistakes only very lately... in the following an element `g` is built

```
sage: M = SchurTensorModule(QQ, 2, 2)
sage: A = M._schur
sage: f = M.basis()[(1,1)]
sage: e = A.basis().values()[0]
sage: g = e*f
```
but it is not valid in the sense that the keys do not correspond to the basis

```
sage: map(type, g.monomial_coefficients().keys())
[<type 'tuple'>]
sage: g.parent().basis().keys()
The cartesian product of ({1, 2}, {1, 2})
```
And hence you **silently** got

```
sage: g.to_vector()
(0, 0, 0, 0)
```

 In order to support all features of the old class we also:
 - move the `__iter__` from `EnumeratedSets.CartesianProducts.ParentMethods` category to `Sets`
 - allows `cartesian_product` to be called with `list`, `tuple`, `set`, `frozenset`
+- make `cartesian_product([])` works
 - introduce a function `bounded_number_of_tuples` in `sage.misc.misc` that is intensively used in the testing framework
 - refine the category of `Set([1,2,3])` to be finite
 - implement a (very naive) `random_element` for `Set([1,2,3])`

Oh, I had not noticed that, in `EnumeratedSetFromIterator`, the existence
of the cache was decided upon construction. +1 then.

Would it make sense to put it in `Sets.Finite.CartesianProduct`, given
that it only works in the finite case?

Yeah, that's a good point.

Thanks!

I made some minor review changes. Since the spacing commit for the
tutorial was going the wrong way w.r.t. Python's convention, I allowed
myself to revert it, and actually fix accordingly the surrounding
lines (which I had written incorrectly a couple years ago). I hope
that's ok.

Up to the final position of the `__iter__` method which I am not yet
quite comfortable with, I am happy with the current state.

Anyone a point of view on this final sticking point?

Cheers,
                      Nicolas

If we switch back, only the following fails (from `sage.combinat.tutorial`):

```
sage: Suits = Set(["Hearts", "Diamonds", "Spades", "Clubs"])
sage: Values = Set([2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
....:               "Jack", "Queen", "King", "Ace"])
sage: Cards = cartesian_product([Values, Suits])
sage: Hands = Subsets(Cards, 5)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: 'CartesianProduct_with_category' object has no attribute 'list'
```
and the reason is because you can not do the list of `Cards`...

```
sage: list(Cards)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: 'CartesianProduct_with_category' object has no attribute 'list'
```

There are of course other ways to fix it, but I found that it was the simplest. Using `FiniteEnumeratedSet` instead of `Set` in the tutorial seems unnatural to me since you want to keep it as simple as possible...

I tend to agree indeed; this would be annoying. 

Maybe we should eventually make the distinction between sets, sets admitting an iterator, and sets with a distinguished enumeration.

For now, let's say that this will do, unless someone has some additional insight to provide.

Still, any thought about moving this feature to Sets.Finite.CartesianProducts?

Ideally, we would do a conditional inheritance based on the presence of `__iter__`. I am not sure it is worth it to complicate anymore the various set categories with an `IterableSets`.

Before it was in `EnumeratedSets.CartesianProducts` and not `EnumeratedSets.Finite.CartesianProducts`. So I tend to prefer the place it is. Of course, we should support better infinite factors.
