The features of `sage.combinat.cartesian_product.CartesianProduct` are now completely integrated into the category framework (see #18290). We remove all occurrences of `CartesianProduct` to either `cartesian_product` or `itertools.product`. We deprecate the `CartesianProduct` from `sage.combinat.cartesian_product`.

In order to support all features of the old class we also:
- move the `__iter__` from `EnumeratedSets.CartesianProducts.ParentMethods` to `Sets.CartesianProducts.ParentMethods`
- allows `cartesian_product` to be called with `list`, `tuple`, `set`, `frozenset`
- make `cartesian_product([])` works
- introduce a function `some_tuples` in `sage.misc.misc` that is intensively used in the testing framework (and incidentally speed up some doc test)
- refine the category of `Set([1,2,3])` to be finite
- implement a (very naive) `random_element` for `Set([1,2,3])`
- implement a (naive) hash for `EnumeratedSetFromIterator`

sage: M = SchurTensorModule(QQ, 2, 2)

Oh, I had not noticed that, in `EnumeratedSetFromIterator`, the existence

Would it make sense to put it in `Sets.Finite.CartesianProduct`, given
that it only works in the finite case?

Thanks!

I made some minor review changes. Since the spacing commit for the
tutorial was going the wrong way w.r.t. Python's convention, I allowed
myself to revert it, and actually fix accordingly the surrounding
lines (which I had written incorrectly a couple years ago). I hope
that's ok.

Up to the final position of the `__iter__` method which I am not yet
quite comfortable with, I am happy with the current state.

Anyone a point of view on this final sticking point?

Cheers,
                      Nicolas

I tend to agree indeed; this would be annoying. 

Maybe we should eventually make the distinction between sets, sets admitting an iterator, and sets with a distinguished enumeration.

For now, let's say that this will do, unless someone has some additional insight to provide.

Still, any thought about moving this feature to Sets.Finite.CartesianProducts?

Ideally, we would do a conditional inheritance based on the presence of `__iter__`. I am not sure it is worth it to complicate anymore the various set categories with an `IterableSets`.

Before it was in `EnumeratedSets.CartesianProducts` and not `EnumeratedSets.Finite.CartesianProducts`. So I tend to prefer the place it is. Of course, we should support better infinite factors.
