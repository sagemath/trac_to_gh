perhaps with 2.7.9 pyopenssl is obsolete? e.g. google finds: https://github.com/basho/riak-python-client/pull/397 

```
Avoid dependency on pyOpenSSL when using Python 2.7.9

Many enhancements of the Python 3 ssl module have been backported to Python 2.7.9.
In particular, the class SSLContext() is available and could be used instead of relying 
on the pyOpenSSL module.

Old one? What one?
well, I don't even know if pyopenssl builds on OSX with Python 2.7.8 in Sage.

PyOpenSSL people tell me to file a bug here:
https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/issues
(i.e. for https://cryptography.io)
I'll see if it works if I try to install it separately.

On the other hand, this is only needed for `notebook(secure=True)` which is probably not an issue on OSX, as people don't run servers on OSX nowadays. 

Porting sagenb to python's SSL does not look easy, as it means porting Twisted (which is still not supporting Python 3, and relies on pyopenssl).

The "deleted" one, still on the mirrors.  (Also with `sage -i ...` rather than `pip`.)

> well, I don't even know if pyopenssl builds on OSX with Python 2.7.8 in Sage.


Well, that was my question.  If it didn't build before, then it's no regression.

I was also wondering whether anybody needs/uses PyOpenSSL/a (secure) notebook server on MacOS X at all.  (I recall long time ago somebody was trying to run a server under MacOS X, but gave up IIRC.)

probably https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-support/ERrL6r-u6Hc/RdlocmPuGTAJ ?

It looks like it never worked on recent OSX, as `notebook.setup()` calls certtools, which on OSX is a completely different beast from Linux's one. 

While I am at it, https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/issues/1924#issuecomment-101266143 tells of a workaround on how to install
the thing on OSX - and indeed it works, thus I was able to install pyopenssl on OSX. But the above `notebook.setup()`  problem is still there, for sure, i.e. notebook(secure=True) still does not run. This is for another ticket.
