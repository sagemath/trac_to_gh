In `codes.ag_code` there is a (very stub) implementation of AG codes which hasn't been touched since 2006. doc-tests have been de-activated and indeed the code doesn't work at all.

The existing implementation is very short, and must quite likely be completely rewritten in order to do it properly and with modern Sage. So there is very little value in the existing code.

Conversely, existing code which breaks on everything is bad publicity for Sage. It should be removed.
