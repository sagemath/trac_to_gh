C++11 is needed by a development version of Pynac, and GCC 5.x's `g++` again got stricter w.r.t. C++ standard conformance (while it still *defaults* to `-std=gnu++98`).

Sage needs `-std=c++11` for at least all files that import ginac headers, that is, for

... and the first `g++` version said to be C++11 feature-complete is 4.8.1.

Since we already have 4.9.2 in Sage, we'd "just" have to `SAGE_INSTALL_GCC` on systems with 4.8.0 (if such exist at all), 4.7, 4.6, and earlier.

Ubuntu 12.04 with 5-year LTS still ships with "Ubuntu/Linaro GCC" 4.6 for example.

How do I do that? The manual says nothing of it:

"A definition file can contain:

* Any kind of C type declaration.
* extern C function or variable declarations.
* Declarations of C functions defined in the module.
* The definition part of an extension type (see below)."

If those flags are only needed to support pynac, they should only be added to pynac declarations, not other random files like `ring.pxd`.

I am fine with closing. We should open a new ticket when we have decided exactly what we want on sage-devel.

This ticket is about adding `std=c++11` for some ginac files. It's not about C++11 in general.

Besides, why do you think that people are prevented from using C++11? It's not like we prevent people from using their own C++11 compiler. Once their code gets in Sage, we make the switch in Sage.

And a separate ticket wasn't the right place for it.

This ticket is not the right forum for the discussion. 

Nevertheless which minimum `gcc` would we be aiming for?

Right, there is already a thread on sage-devel. Let's just close this discussion here.

We are facing this problem for the update of LinBox Givaro and fflas-ffpack in #17635.
