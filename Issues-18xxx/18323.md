C++11 is needed by a development version of Pynac, and GCC 5.x's `g++` again got stricter w.r.t. C++ standard conformance (while it still *defaults* to `-std=gnu++98`).

Sage needs `-std=c++11` for at least all files that import ginac headers, that is, for

I just confirmed that you simply cannot compile a package with C++11 and expect the `.so` file to match all references generated by libsage compilation using a pre-C++11 compile. Specifically the template `class std::vector<GiNaC::ex>` will create incompatible code.

Okay, you knew that beforehand, but I had to prove it to myself.

... and the first `g++` version said to be C++11 feature-complete is 4.8.1.

Since we already have 4.9.2 in Sage, we'd "just" have to `SAGE_INSTALL_GCC` on systems with 4.8.0 (if such exist at all), 4.7, 4.6, and earlier.

Ubuntu 12.04 with 5-year LTS still ships with "Ubuntu/Linaro GCC" 4.6 for example.

How do I do that? The manual says nothing of it:

"A definition file can contain:

* Any kind of C type declaration.
* extern C function or variable declarations.
* Declarations of C functions defined in the module.
* The definition part of an extension type (see below)."
