<a id='comment:11'></a>I've done my reviewer changes, and I obtained some good speed improvements:

```
sage: Lambda = RootSystem(['A',5,2]).weight_lattice(extended=true).fundamental_weights()
sage: V = IntegrableRepresentation(Lambda[0]+Lambda[1]+Lambda[3])
sage: %time V.print_strings()
...
CPU times: user 3.14 s, sys: 28.5 ms, total: 3.16 s
Wall time: 3.11 s

sage: Lambda = RootSystem(['A',8,2]).weight_lattice(extended=true).fundamental_weights()
sage: V = IntegrableRepresentation(Lambda[0]+Lambda[3])
sage: %time V.print_strings()
...
CPU times: user 8.66 s, sys: 44.2 ms, total: 8.7 s
Wall time: 8.66 s
```
Before:

```
sage: Lambda = RootSystem(['A',5,2]).weight_lattice(extended=true).fundamental_weights()
sage: V = IntegrableRepresentation(Lambda[0]+Lambda[1]+Lambda[3])
sage: %time V.print_strings()
...
CPU times: user 3.6 s, sys: 35.7 ms, total: 3.64 s
Wall time: 3.57 s

sage: Lambda = RootSystem(['A',8,2]).weight_lattice(extended=true).fundamental_weights()
sage: V = IntegrableRepresentation(Lambda[0]+Lambda[3])
sage: %time V.print_strings()
...
CPU times: user 10 s, sys: 68.6 ms, total: 10.1 s
Wall time: 10 s
```
If you happy with my changes, then you can set a positive review.
