Circular dependencies warning: The DOCS=yes flag needs the optional
dependency Sphinx, which needs Jinja2, which needs Sphinx because
DOCS=yes ... So... If you really need the docs, build Jinja2
without the DOCS=yes flag, build Sphinx, then rebuild Jinja2 with
DOCS=yes. Incidentally, unless you are a developer, you don't
normally need the DOCS=yes flag.
