Currently, we only allow acyclic quivers when creating a quiver representation. The aim is to lift that restriction to the possible extent.

The key for implementation probably is to use enumerated families (rather than lists/tuples) for the basis of the resulting vector space.

<a id='comment:6'></a>It is already possible to define a representation of a cyclic quiver by assigning finite-dimensional vector spaces to each vertex and assigning matrices (defining a transformation) to each arrow.

What is currently not possible is to provide the right-module that is given, say, by all paths that start at vertex `v` (the result is a projective indecomposable module). Reason is that the current code would first try to create vector space basis of the to-be-created module (=representation) by forming the **list** of all paths starting at `v`. Of course, that list may be infinite in the case of a cyclic quiver, thus, the code is doomed.

My guess is (by looking at the current code) that what we really need is a container that represents a vector space basis for the module, so that we can
- use the basis as a cache key (quiver representations use a `UniqueFactory`)
- test whether a path of the quiver belongs to the basis
- iterate over the basis elements

The previous commit provides these three features for families of paths that are closed under multiplication from the right, and a similar thing would be needed for left-closed path families as well.

I guess the attempt to fix the issue should start from scratch.
