As reported on `AskSage` [1], the function `.is_planar` can return wrong results when given a specific embedding to run its computations on.

This actually comes from a mistake in a `if/else` and variable types, as `bool(a_dictionary)` returns `True` when the dictionary is nonempty. The original authors did not seem to be aware of that, and once fixed the code does not make the mistake again.

The problem was that the computations were run on the cached embedding (i.e `_embedding`) instead of the one provided by the user.

One bug less in Sage! Cool!

Could you replace `(see eg's)` by `(see examples)`. It is very wrong as "e.g." is a latin abbreviation for "for example".
