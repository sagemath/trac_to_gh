#15984 replaced many conditions of the form

```
type(a) == type(b)
```
to

```
isinstance(a, type(b))
```

I think that the intention of `type(a) == type(b)` really is to compare whether two objects have equal type. So we undo these changes (while changing `==` to `is` for these type checks).

The changes back to `type()` are in the context of equality tests. As equality is a symmetric relation tests for type identity are clearly more appropriate than tests for a subclass relationship. 
Other changes introduce explicit type names for expressions like `type(1)` which a good thing.

This looks good to me. By the way: I built on Ubuntu 15.04 and all tests pass.

PS: Thank you for your critical review of #18796.
