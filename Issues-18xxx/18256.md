Are you sure it's really a full recythonize and not just a rebuild of all files depending on a common file like `src/ext/interrupt.pxi`? It's true that Cython (just like `make`) uses timestamps to trigger rebuilds, so if the timestamp of `src/ext/interrupt.pxi` changes, then all Cython extensions depending on that (i.e. almost all of them) would be recythonized.

If this is the problem, I would like to close this ticket as `wontfix` since it's a feature, not a bug, to use timestamps for dependency checking. And even if it would be a bug, it's in upstream Cython, not Sage.
