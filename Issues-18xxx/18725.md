This ticket implements morphisms of topological manifolds, i.e. continuous maps between topological manifolds. This is a follow-up of #18640 within the [SageManifolds project](http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/). See the metaticket #18528 for an overview.

Two new Python classes are introduced in this ticket:
- the parent class `TopologicalManifoldHomset` for sets Hom(M,N) of morphisms between two 
  topological manifolds M and N over the same topological field K
- the element class `ContinuousMap` for elements of Hom(M,N), i.e. continuous maps M --> N
Moreover, this ticket introduces plotting capabilities for charts (method `RealChart.plot()`) and for points (method `ManifoldPoint.plot()`), which require continuous maps and thus could not have been introduced in #18529.

**Documentation**:
The reference manual is produced by
`sage -docbuild reference/manifolds html`
It can also be accessed online at http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/doc/18725/reference/manifolds/
More documentation (e.g. example worksheets) can be found [here](http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/documentation.html).

+This ticket implements morphisms of topological manifolds, i.e. continuous maps between topological manifolds. This is a follow-up of #18640 within the [SageManifolds project](http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/). See the metaticket #18528 for an overview.
+
+Two new Python classes are introduced in this ticket:
+- the parent class \`TopologicalManifoldHomset\` for sets Hom(M,N) of morphisms between two 
+  topological manifolds M and N over the same topological field K
+- the element class \`ContinuousMap\` for elements of Hom(M,N), i.e. continuous maps M --> N
+Moreover, this ticket introduces plotting capabilities for charts (method \`RealChart.plot()\`) and for points (method \`ManifoldPoint.plot()\`), which require continuous maps and thus could not have been introduced in #18529.
+
+**Documentation**:
+The reference manual is produced by
+\`sage -docbuild reference/manifolds html\`
+It can also be accessed online at http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/doc/18725/reference/manifolds/
+More documentation (e.g. example worksheets) can be found [here](http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/documentation.html).
