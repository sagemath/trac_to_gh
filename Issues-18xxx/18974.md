As mentioned in [this sage-devel thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/_COZBKnRcVo), it would be nice to fix a convention for the typography of proper noun in functions. In other words what should be the standard
1. `count_Heegner_points`
2. `count_heegner_points`
3. both (in which case we need to choose which one is an alias of the other)

The developer manual should be updated accordingly.

see also #18975 for case-insensitive search with `search_src`

Some examples:

- `Element`: `.N()` for numerical approximations

- matrix: `.LLL()` matrix reduction, `.LU()` and `.QR()` matrix decomposition, ..., `.is_LLL_reduced()`

- quadratic forms: `Gram_det`, `Gram_matrix`, `GHY_mass__maximal`, `CS_genus_symbol_list`, `Hessian_matrix`, `Kitaoka_mass_at_2`

- graphs: `lex_BFS`

- `GelfandTsetlinPattern`: `Tokuyama_coefficient`
