The implementation of `is_squarefree()` for univariate polynomials requires that the base ring is a PID. However, mathematically, the question makes sense over any integral domain. Therefore, the condition on the input can be relaxed.

The algorithm relies on `gcd()`, so the `gcd()` can still raise an exception.

I don't know of any non-PID `R` in Sage for which the gcd in `R[x]` works, so this won't change anything in practice.
