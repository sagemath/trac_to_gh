There is a natural embedding of elements of the symmetric group algebra into diagram algebras, especially the partition algebra and the Brauer algebra. Therefore, there should be a morphism registered to the coercion model to allow for symmetric group algebra elements to be coerced into the appropriate diagram algebras. This morphism is pretty straight forward and will only take a few lines to implement. 

Depends on #18720

Is this a bug in the SymmetricGroupAlgebra?

```
sage: SymmetricGroupAlgebra(SR,3,category = FiniteDimensionalAlgebrasWithBasis(SR))
Traceback
...
TypeError: Cannot create a consistent method resolution
order (MRO) for bases MagmaticAlgebras.subcategory_class, UnitalAlgebras.WithBasis.subcategory_class, AdditiveMagmas.Algebras.subcategory_class
```
But, in a completely new Sage session:

```
sage: SymmetricGroupAlgebra(SR,3)
Symmetric group algebra of order 3 over Symbolic Ring
sage: SymmetricGroupAlgebra(SR,3,category = FiniteDimensionalAlgebrasWithBasis(SR))
Symmetric group algebra of order 3 over Symbolic Ring
```
I have no idea what could be going on here. Is it some clever caching that somehow makes things work? In any event, this is the cause of the issue, I think.

(I tried this in sage6.8beta5)

This currently breaks the requirements of a coercion in that the coercion map must be defined on all elements of the domain. So it will need to be a conversion, which you can implement in the `_element_constructor_` method by

```python
if isinstance(x, SymmetricGroupAlgebra.Element) and other_conditions_on_parent(x):
    return convert_to_element_of_self(x)
```
For those diagram algebras which this is well-defined on the entire domain, you can make the call to ``self`` a coercion in the constructor or implement:

```python
def _coerce_map_from_(self, P):
    if isinstance(P, SymmetricGroupAlgebra) and other_conditions(P):
        return True
    return super(self, DiagramAlgebra)._coerce_map_from_(P)
```

Hello,

Just some sided remarks.

- You have more commits than the number of lines you modified! Moreover most of your commit messages are completely useless. The git history is important since it is used to find out which commit is responsible for a given change. You would better start a new (clean) branch from scratch.
- methods must be documented (see [the developer guide](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#documentation-strings))

Vincent,

There is no need to merge the last beta.

But anyway, the most important is to do how you feel. And take for the best other's comments to get a better Sage software.

Okay, so I figured out what was going on.

<technical>What was happening was you were creating a coercion from a subalgebra to the ambient algebra, but the ambient algebra could be garbage collected because the morphism (which only holds a strong reference to the *codomain*) could be collected and the subalgebra didn't have a strong reference to the ambient algebra. When the ambient algebra was recreated, the morphism was not, and so there was no coercion registered (which is done in the codomains). I reworked things so the lift morphism was strongly referenced, and hence the ambient algebra, by the subalgebra.</technical>

I also reworked the morphisms to the Sage standard practice and expanded coercions to allow when there is also a coercion of base rings. There were also some other misc issues that I fixed as well.

If you're happy with my changes, then you can set a positive review.
