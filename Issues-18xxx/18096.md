Note (in singular)

```
> LIB "normal.lib";
> ring r=0,(x,y,z),dp;
> ideal i=(x-y)*(y-z)*(z-x);
> genus(i);
-2
```
whereas in sage:

```
sage: x,y,z = QQ['x,y,z'].gens()
sage: C= Curve((x-y)*(y-z)*(z-x)); 
sage: sage: import sage.libs.singular.function_factory
sage: sage: sing_genus = sage.libs.singular.function_factory.ff.normal__lib.genus
sage: I=C.defining_ideal()
sage: sing_genus(I)
4294967294
```
so somehow the -2 seems to be represented in libsingular as a 32-bit signed integer and gets interpreted by sage as (probably) a 64-bit signed integer. The relevant code lives in
sage.lib.singular.function.pyx:951 (to_python):

```
        elif rtyp == INT_CMD:
            return <long>to_convert.data
```
Oddly enough, most of libsingular seems to refer to such fields with a `(long)` cast as well, and I would expect that, since sage and libsingular are supposed to be compiled with compatible compilers, they would agree on what `long` means.

interpreting the value as an int rather than a long seems to work. Input welcome from someone with more singular knowledge.

(note that the `<int><long>` cast is necessary because a cast to `<int>` directly from `<void *>` causes a "loss of information" error).
