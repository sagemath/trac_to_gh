LinearMatroid._extend_chains enumerates all the chains of M which extend given chains of M/f. This function is used internally to recursively generate all the extension chains of a linear matroid in LinearMatroid.linear_extensions.

User access to _extend_chains makes it easier to write more efficient code for the generation of minor-closed classes of linear matroids. 

Since _extend_chains is perhaps a confusing name, I will create the dual functions
LinearMatroid.coextend_chains(chains, element, fundamentals) and LinearMatroid.extend_cochains(cochains, element, fundamentals).
