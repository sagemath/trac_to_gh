<a id='comment:9'></a>Well, was not that hard.

Assuming other parts work, this seems to be direct (and correct) translation of equations from the paper to the code. I read it, and tested with examples given in the paper. I think that `l` as a variable name makes sense here, because `lambda` is already reserved name (and we do not use Fortress language `:=)`), even if it violates PEP 0008 part "Names to Avoid". Hence I mark this as positive review.

Btw, `graphs.strongly_regular_graph(324,57,0,12)` says "- - graph exists.Comments: - -", i.e. has a missing space. You may want to correct it, when next time modifying this file.
