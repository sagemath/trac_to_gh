I would change

```
if [ `cat "$PKG_SCRIPTS/type"` == "experimental" ]
```
to

```
if [ x`cat "$PKG_SCRIPTS/type"` = xexperimental ]
```
which has less chances of trouble (in case of a missing/empty `type` file for example).

I first did, then decided against it for the following reason: there is one message for experimental packages (appears twice) and one message for archived packages (appears once).

So well, I found it cleaner this way.
