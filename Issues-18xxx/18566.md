I would change

```
if [ `cat "$PKG_SCRIPTS/type"` == "experimental" ]
```
to

```
if [ x`cat "$PKG_SCRIPTS/type"` = xexperimental ]
```
which has less chances of trouble (in case of a missing/empty `type` file for example).

I first did, then decided against it for the following reason: there is one message for experimental packages (appears twice) and one message for archived packages (appears once). As for old-style packages the two messages follow each other, it seemed weird to have one called from a function and another one given explicitly. Plus It would have meant that the new functions would have to be defined in the middle of unrelated code, somewhere else.

So well, I found it cleaner this way.
