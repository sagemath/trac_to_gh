Hello Ralf,

Sorry, I am late into the `CFiniteSequence` implementation. So my comment are not especially appropriate for this ticket.

Did you notice that there is already `sage/combinat/binary_recurrence_sequences.py`? It is far from being perfect but multiplying the implementations is **very** confusing. And what was your motivation to put this in `sage.rings`?

Vincent

I have enough mathematical background to know that binary means two. Recurrence of degree 2 is a particular case and this is why it may have been a *starting point* for general linear recurrence sequences. I never claimed that you redid what was already done. But just that you ignored other's work.

The word ring is not in the article... could you give more explanations?
