This is only lacking implementation of ogf factors of form `P/Q^c` with `Q` polynomial of degree `>1`, and `c>1`. Needs research, probably even a new concept.

Hello Ralf,

Sorry, I am late into the `CFiniteSequence` implementation. So my comment are not especially appropriate for this ticket.

Did you notice that there is already `sage/combinat/binary_recurrence_sequences.py`? It is far from being perfect but multiplying the implementations is **very** confusing. And what was your motivation to put this in `sage.rings`?

Vincent

Vincent, you probably read the word `fibonacci`, but did you notice that in `binary_recurrence_sequences.py` only a small part of C-finite sequences is treated, ie those of degree 2? Have you noticed that our implementation can guess a sequence from the numbers? And with this ticket you get a closed form for immediate and fast evaluation of any binary or other recurrence.

As to your question about the ring of C-finite sequences I refer you to

The word ring is not in the article... could you give more explanations?

Thank you for your work on bringing Binet-like formulas to CFiniteSequences!  That's a nice idea.

There was a couple of issues with the code.  For instance, multiple roots were not fully supported (previously, `CFiniteSequence((x/(1-x-x<sup>2))</sup>2).closed_form()` would return an empty list).  Also, the code seemed unneccesarily difficult for higher degree algebraic roots.

In an attempt to make it more organized (there is no case distinctions now) and to fix the issue of multiple roots, I have rewritten the code.  Please check!
