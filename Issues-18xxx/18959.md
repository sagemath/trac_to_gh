Check documentation in functions like `cardinality()`, `height()` and `dimension()`.

This continues the series beginning with #18925 and #18941.

(Also adds input checking for `random_order_ideal()`.)

<a id='comment:2'></a>Code changes: Return type of all functions is now `Integer`. There was slight inconsistency between for example `dimension()` and `width()`.

Tests: Added test for empty poset to those functions where it wasn't already.

Docstrings: Added some some kind of "human-readable" explanation to `dimension()`. Otherwise normal things like "returns" -> "return".

Examples: Tried to make simple examples that are possible to verify by hand. For example `relations_number` for the Pentagon Poset. For `dimension()` selected a beatiful poset (with untrivial dimension). `:=)`

Questions:

Is it exactly true that "Relations are also often called intervals."? I would say that every relation (i.e. pair of comparable elemenst) *defines* an interval.

Is the term 'realizer' commonly used? If so, it should be mentioned in the documentation of `dimension()` (because of googling).

There is one 'not tested' in `dimension()`. Can a test combine 'long time' and optional? As it takes less than 30 seconds with additional package, it could be tested with `--long`.

About English, should one say "the longest chain" or "a longest chain" when there can be several chains equal in lenght? (Compare to "a smallest set of linear extensions" on `dimension()`.)

There is a discussion on #18159 on the theme "I don't mind your returning Sage Integers if you like, but I don't see why you want to force me to do it too".

OK, here is modified patch; `int` vs. `Integer` can be resolved later.

This patch contains non-relating modification to `random_order_ideal()`: `direction='junk'` will now raise exception instead of behaving like `direction='up'`.

<a id='comment:11'></a>Hello !

Two comments:

- There is an 'Integer(0)' left
- It is (slightly) better to have `# random` than `# not tested`: in the first case the command is not run, while in the second it is run and the output is not compared with the expected results (which would still report an error in case of an exception). Given the command in question ('sage: L') it hardly matters here

Regardless of what you decide to do with those two points, you can set the ticket to `positive_review` on my behalf.

I would have said this a bug. I corrected it also.
