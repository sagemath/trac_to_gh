The addition of rational form makes it possible to always compute a canonical equivalence class representative for matrix similarity, using only field operations.  Computing the similarity transformation is still limited by the necessity of using Jordan form and the resulting problem of eigenvalues lying outside of the field used for the matrix entries.  Various improvements to the code and error-checking have been made.

Hello,

This looks like a very nice improvement! I am slowly digging into the algorithmic part of it. But let me first start with simple remarks.

1. First of all, the standard for doctest continuation is now `....:` instead of `...`. Moreover, when `transformation=True` and when the matrices are similar the method `is_similar` used to return `(False, matrix)` instead of `(True, matrix)`. You are carefully ignoring the first argument in all the tests! So either it is useless and I suggest to just return `None` or `matrix` if `transformation=True` or test the first argument appropriately. Finally, some tiny improvements can be obtained using `m.get_unsafe(i,j)` instead of `m[i,j]`. I provided 3 commits for these that can be found at `public/18505`

2. Instead as invoking QQbar if the ground field is QQ you can use the method `.algebraic_closure()` that also works for prime fields

```
sage: QQ.algebraic_closure()
Algebraic Field
sage: GF(3).algebraic_closure()
Algebraic closure of Finite Field of size 3
```
   Though, I do not know whether your code would work in this case.

3. I do not like the fact that for input in ZZ, the transformation matrix has coefficient in QQbar. I do not see why the base field should be extended. Conjugacy makes sense within `M_n(ZZ)`.

```
sage: m = matrix(ZZ,2,[0,1,1,1])
sage: a = matrix(ZZ,2,[1,1,0,1])
sage: b = matrix(ZZ,2,[1,0,1,1])
sage: c = a*b*b*a*~b
sage: m2 = c * m * ~c
sage: m.is_similar(m2)
True
sage: m.is_similar(m2, True)
(
      [   1.000000000000000?               0.?e-18]
True, [  0.7894736842105263? -0.05263157894736842?]
)
```
  (sided note: the above command used to return `(False, matrix)`... see item 0)

4. In the case matrices are not square or have different dimension I would rather raise an error instead of returning False. Conjugacy does not make any sense for them. Moreover, everything can be tested at once using `if parent(self) is not parent(other):`.

5. I learned that a lot of time is actually taken by the import statements. You can try to minimize the number of them.

6. The usage of `quo_rem` looks weird. I thought that `q,r = a.quo_rem(b)` would be equivalent to `q = a//b; r = a%b` but it is not! For example `(1/3) % 5` returns `2` as it is the inverse of `3` mod `5`. What do you think about the semantics of `//` and `%` against the method `quo_rem`?

More to come...

Vincent

It is not only a burden. It is a problem of well defined specifications.

With your proposition, a `False` answer would have two meanings. If a question does not make sense it should really be an error. It is like asking `1 / 0 == 3` (that indeed raise an error in Python). As a consequence of such behavior things such as `m.is_similar(1)` would be ambiguous (is there an implicit coercion in this command? In other words, if the answer is `False` does it mean that my matrix is not similar to the identity?).

With your pseudo use-case, it is very easy to sort first by parents and then check for similarity.

```
sage: elts = [1, 2/3, 5, 5/2, 3.4, 0.0]
sage: from collections import defaultdict
sage: d = defaultdict(list)
sage: for e in elts: d[e.parent()].append(e)
sage: d[RR]
[3.40000000000000, 0.000000000000000]
sage: d[ZZ]
[1, 5]

I am ready to go back to raising error for square matrices of different sizes.

But first, do yo have any other comment ?

The thing we really need (in another ticket) is a canonical form algo that gives the change-of-basis matrix. It seems that m*gma has something like that, with a reference.

As I have learned it: A is similar to B if there exist an invertible matrix P such that A = PBP<sup>-1</sup>. This can be interpreted as A and B are similar iff they are the same linear transformation. So are you saying it should raise an error when checking if two maps are equal if have different (co)domains?\n\nI am still leaning towards non-square matrices returning `False` and considering the error being raised a regression.\n\nYou're arguments are unconvincing to me because checking similarity of different sized matrices is not an invalid mathematical comparison (much less an operation). For `m.is_similar(1)`, this is comparing a matrix to something which is not a matrix, and an error would be appropriate in this case.\n> \n> With your pseudo use-case, it is very easy to sort first by parents and then check for similarity.\n> \n> ```\n> sage: elts = [1, 2/3, 5, 5/2, 3.4, 0.0]\n> sage: from collections import defaultdict\n> sage: d = defaultdict(list)\n> sage: for e in elts: d[e.parent()].append(e)\n> sage: d[RR]\n> [3.40000000000000, 0.000000000000000]\n> sage: d[ZZ]\n> [1, 5]\n> sage: d[QQ]\n> [2/3, 5/2]\n> ```\n\nYou've done an import statement and some more advanced Python-foo.

It still makes sense with the definition of similar that `is_similar` would return false when the (square) matrices are different sizes. The argument weakens for non-square matrices, but I still think it puts a completely unnecessary burden on the user.

It is like asking `1 / 0 == 3` (that indeed raise an error in Python). As a consequence of such behavior things such as `m.is_similar(1)` would be ambiguous (is there an implicit coercion in this command? In other words, if the answer is `False` does it mean that my matrix is not similar to the identity?).

The specifications are well-defined. As I have learned it: A is similar to B if there exist an invertible matrix P such that A = PBP<sup>-1</sup>. This can be interpreted as A and B are similar iff they are the same linear transformation. So are you saying it should raise an error when checking if two maps are equal if have different (co)domains?

I am still leaning towards non-square matrices returning `False` and considering the error being raised a regression.

You're arguments are unconvincing to me because checking similarity of different sized matrices is not an invalid mathematical comparison (much less an operation). For `m.is_similar(1)`, this is comparing a matrix to something which is not a matrix, and an error would be appropriate in this case.

You've done an import statement and some more advanced Python-foo. There is no way I could teach that to my linear algebra students or to an average Sage user.

Actually, does anyone know what the other Ma's do?

For me it is rather an algebraic statements. And the question `Is A similar to B in X` makes sense in any given algebra `X` and two of its elements `A` and `B`. And the algebra `X` is definitely part of the question (see point 3 in [comment:3](#comment:3)). If there is no "natural" algebra containing `A` and `B` the question is not well defined. In Sage, elements have parents and it should be expected that we are answering the question "is similar" (or "is conjugate") in their common parent (involving coercion if needed).

As you suggested "similar" is mostly applied for linear algebra and the appropriate adjective in general is "conjugate". But for me, `is_similar` should just be an alias of `is_conjugate` in the case of matrices.

What you are suggesting is a `is_similar` with the following behavior

```
def is_similar(self, other):
    try:
        return self.is_conjugate(other)
    except Exception:
        return False
```
where the `is_conjugate` would be defined as I said. Do you think we should have both `is_conjugate` and `is_similar`?

You are just missing the point. The identity matrix and the integer 1 are considered equal in Sage

```
sage: identity_matrix(10) == 1
True
```

The natural algebra in this case would be the product algebra over a common (larger) base ring.

I think they should be aliases because `x.is_conjugate(y)` should be the same as `y in x.conjugacy_class()`, and the latter of which would not result in an error. However, I am probably able live with a stricter `is_conjugate`, although this has a slight name conflict with complex conjugate, which we shorten to `conjugate`.

I guess since we are allowing coercion of the arguments, then `m.is_similar(1)` should coerce to a common parent, which is `m.parent()` and then check. However, it should not result in an error if no common parent is found, it should simply be false. What if `m` and `n` are the same size, but had no common base ring, should that raise an error?

More I think about it, the more I am convinced that essentially any of the `is_*` methods should not error out when trivially incorrect. They are checking properties, not performing operations.

Maple returns `false`. I couldn't find anything on Mathematica either.

Thanks to Vincent, Travis and Frédéric for their careful work on this (and I'm glad to see Travis defending use by students who don't know much math or much Python).  I'm sorry to be so late in picking up on this one and missing the vote.

I have fond memories of writing .zigzag_form() as a precursor of rational canonical form (is that the best method name ever?).  So I'm really glad to see the similarity check becoming fully capable, all the discussion about user interaction, and a few speed-ups for zig-zag form.

Why did this change

```diff
+        A matrix over the integers will be promoted to a
+        matrix over the rationals, but may need to be manually
+        promoted to the algebraic numbers.  ::
+
             sage: A = matrix(ZZ, 2, 2, range(4))
             sage: B = matrix(QQbar, 2, 2, range(4))
             sage: A.is_similar(B)
+            Traceback (most recent call last):
+            ...
+            TypeError: matrices need to have entries with identical fraction fields,
+            not Rational Field and Algebraic Field
+            sage: A.change_ring(QQbar).is_similar(B)
             True
```
There is a natural coercion here.
