This ticket implements parallelization of basic operations (arithmetics, contractions) on tensors on free modules of finite rank. The parallelization is performed by means of Python's module `multiprocessing`, via the decorator `@parallel`. It is implemented in computational methods of classes handling tensor components: `sage.tensor.modules.comp.Components` and `sage.tensor.modules.comp.CompWithSym`. The user can control the number of processes involved in the parallelization via the singleton class `Parallelism`. The latter, introduced in this ticket, is actually generic and can be used in other parts of Sage.

This work is an extension of #15916, within the [SageManifolds](http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/) project (actually the code in this ticket is the basis for parallelization in SageManifolds 0.8). See the metaticket #18528 for an overview.

Hello,

The name `set_nproc` is not appropriate for a function that is intended to be used only for tensor products. Secondly, why are you duplicating the interface with a class `TensorParallelCompute` and functions `set_nproc`, `get_nproc`?

Replying to [@videlec](#comment%3A13):
Hello Vincent,

Thanks to review our work.

We try to reply to the two points:
1) You are right, the names `set_nproc` and `get_nproc` are generic names and not clearly referred to tensors, so we propose to changes them in `set_nproc_tensor` and `get_nproc_tensor`. 

2) The functions `set_nproc` and `get_nproc`  were introduced in order to avoid 
to the users to typing the two more verbose (and less clear) functions `TensorParallelCompute().set(nproc)` and  `TensorParallelCompute._nproc`
Note that the singleton `TensorParallelCompute` is not in the global namespace but only the functions `set_nproc` and `get_nproc`.

Best regards,

Marco

Some more questions:

- I still don't understand why there is an object oriented interface **and** a function interface. Why not only one?

- Wouldn't it be better to gather everything related to parallelism in a single place? You could mimic what is done for proofs (`sage.structure.proof.proof`) or global options (`sage.structure.global_options`). These two are not perfect but at least they intend to be general and reusable. The object oriented interface could be something like:

```
sage: Parallelism().get('tensor')
1
sage: Parallelism().set('tensor', 3)
sage: Parallelism().set_default(3)
sage: Parallelism().get_default()
3
sage: Parallellism().get_all()
{
 'tensor': 3,
 'xyz': 2
}
```
(though that could be postponed to some other tickets)

- The functions `get_nproc_tensor` and `set_nproc_tensor` should definitely not be in the global namespace as they are very much specialized.

Thanks for the heavy changes! If you are done with your changes and want a review again you need to switch the status of the ticket from "needs info" to "needs review". 

You also need to update the ticket description.

It would be good to advertise this ticket on sage-devel. Other people might be interested (e.g. #18987 for which the parallelization option can use some default).
