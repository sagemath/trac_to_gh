This ticket implements parallelization of basic operations (arithmetics, contractions) on tensors on free modules of finite rank. The parallelization is performed by means of Python's module `multiprocessing`, via the decorator `@parallel`. It is implemented in computational methods of classes handling tensor components: `sage.tensor.modules.comp.Components` and `sage.tensor.modules.comp.CompWithSym`. The user can control the number of processes involved in the parallelization via the singleton class `Parallelism`. The latter, introduced in this ticket, is actually generic and can be used in other parts of Sage.

This work is an extension of #15916, within the [SageManifolds](http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/) project (actually the code in this ticket is the basis for parallelization in SageManifolds 0.8). See the metaticket #18528 for an overview.

Hello,

The name `set_nproc` is not appropriate for a function that is intended to be used only for tensor products. Secondly, why are you duplicating the interface with a class `TensorParallelCompute` and functions `set_nproc`, `get_nproc`?

Vincent

<div id="comment:14" align="right">Comment 14</div>

Replying to [@videlec](#comment%3A13):
Hello Vincent,

Thanks to review our work.

We try to reply to the two points:
1) You are right, the names `set_nproc` and `get_nproc` are generic names and not clearly referred to tensors, so we propose to changes them in `set_nproc_tensor` and `get_nproc_tensor`. 

2) The functions `set_nproc` and `get_nproc`  were introduced in order to avoid 
to the users to typing the two more verbose (and less clear) functions `TensorParallelCompute().set(nproc)` and  `TensorParallelCompute._nproc`
Note that the singleton `TensorParallelCompute` is not in the global namespace but only the functions `set_nproc` and `get_nproc`.

Best regards,

Marco

Some more questions:

- I still don't understand why there is an object oriented interface **and** a function interface. Why not only one?

- Wouldn't it be better to gather everything related to parallelism in a single place? You could mimic what is done for proofs (`sage.structure.proof.proof`) or global options (`sage.structure.global_options`). These two are not perfect but at least they intend to be general and reusable. The object oriented interface could be something like:

```
sage: Parallelism().get('tensor')
1
sage: Parallelism().set('tensor', 3)
sage: Parallelism().set_default(3)
sage: Parallelism().get_default()
3
sage: Parallellism().get_all()
{
 'tensor': 3,
 'xyz': 2
}
```
(though that could be postponed to some other tickets)

- The functions `get_nproc_tensor` and `set_nproc_tensor` should definitely not be in the global namespace as they are very much specialized.

Thanks for the heavy changes! If you are done with your changes and want a review again you need to switch the status of the ticket from "needs info" to "needs review". 

You also need to update the ticket description.
