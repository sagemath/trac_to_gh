For some reason, `list(something)` breaks if `__len__` raises a `NotImplementedError`, but a `TypeError` is ignored.

Python....

As `len(NN)` already raises a `NotImplementedError`, I just copied the behaviour.

<a id='comment:4'></a>For posterity, the reason that `TypeError` gets caught is to make this work:

```
sage: l=(i for i in range(10))
sage: len(l)
TypeError: object of type 'generator' has no len()
sage: list(l)
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```
It may well be an accident that `list` checks `len` of its argument before it checks if it's iterable, so I would not consider changing the error type a reliable way to prevent an infinite loop. I don't think python officially supports a way of preventing `list(<infinite iterable>)` from going in an infinite loop. It works, though...
