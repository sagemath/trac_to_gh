Instances of the [GlobalOptions](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/structure/sage/structure/global_options.html) class in `sage.structure.global_options` do not pickle, which is annoying and causes various problems. (This is a defect.)

In addition, when the `GlobalOptions` class was introduced it was suggested in [sage-dev](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/sage-devel/globabloptions/sage-devel/7ApZgwBTU4U/Qe6QoeuYgvAJ) that it "would be nice" if we could implement the syntax used in the IPython configuration:

```

    A.options.foobar = 1

in addition to

    A.options(foobar=1)
```
This ticket implements both of these features and, in addition, makes it possible to construct options classes dynamically.

As was also suggested on sage-dev, I have also renamed all of the global_options methods simply as options, with the global_options variants being deprecated. The "stand-alone" options classes such as `PartitionOoptions`, `TableauxOptions`, ... have also been deprecated and, instead, put inside their "parent" classes where they are accessible using the `options` method (`global_options` methods have been deprecated). This is cleaned up the code a little and it seems to speed up the sage start-up time. 

The pickling is done by adding an extra `module` argument to the `GlobalOptions` that specifies the module which contains the class that the options are attached -- `name` of of the class defaults to the name of the options class but this can be explicitly set using the `options_class` argument. The options class is assumed to have an `options` method, and this is used to unpickle a pickle for an options class. `GlobalOptions` that do not arise as options methods for standard sage classes cannot be unpickled. The reason why the name of the module and class are passed, as strings, to `GlobalOptions` rather than the actual class is that this approach allows the options to be constructed during the initialisation of the (instance of the) class and, in turn, this allows the class to dynamically construct their options classes.

Okay, I fixed the doctest failures with `permutation.py`. The issue was that the `_Option` (now `Option` so it appears in the doc) did not define a `__ne__` method, and so it returned `True` for things like `opt != X` even when `opt == X`.

The other doctest failures were due to lack of conversion to `options` from `global_options`.

This is a very nice improvement over the current interface to (global) options. If the doctest pass for you and my changes are good, then you can set this to a positive review.
