Exposes the counting of the integer points of a polytope.. Mostly a copy/paste from `ehrhart_polynomial`.

This branch also adds a `file_output` optional flag to `cdd_Hrepresentation` and `cdd_Vrepresentation`. The functions calling external executable already contain sufficiently non-mathematical code.

It makes life easier, and it seems that this file format is standard. Why would you oppose having a way to store a polytope into a file?

Or do you want `.write_cdd_Hrepresentation` and `.write_cdd_Vrepresentation` instead?

> Can't `latte_int` read the problem from stdin?


I don't know. But I think that we should be able to write polytopes to files regardless of whether `latte_int` can avoid it.

Making simple code more complicated. Writing to a file can already be done using

```
with open(filename, 'w') as f:
    f.write(whatever)
```

I don't see the advantage of the `file_input` argument here.

Here is that way:

```
with open(filename, 'w') as f:
    f.write(polyhedron.cdd_Hrepresentation())
```

Really, would you want a `file_input` argument to every function returning a string?

Indeed, there were problems.

I *add* myself as author, yes.

Absolutely not true.

OK, I see the problem here. I can fix this.

Of course, that's what a reviewer should do.

What about the names of those functions? I wrote them without thinking, but if we are to keep them around then perhaps it deserves more brain time.

Do you prefer a `to_cdd_Hrepresentation` or anything else?

I believe that a reviewer also has the choice to make changes to the proposed code, which is sometimes simpler than explaining which changes should be made.

Okay. Done.

As a courtesy to the author, yes. He can fix typos directly, reformat straightforward things, that's way easier than explaining them and saves everybody time.

The reviewer, however, is a counter-power to the author. He is meant to check things that the author could forget or mess-up. But he cannot have "full write access" to the branch either, for the reviewer simply cannot have more power than the author on a ticket.

If I propose changes it is very often because I need to have them inside. If a reviewer comes, makes whatever changes he likes and sets the branch to `needs_review`, then it is like I am forced to accept those changes if I want my code to make it in. In this specific case, it was particularly clear that I wanted functions to export polytopes to a file [comment:12]. If you disregard that and implement the branch to your liking, then you are basically taking the other feature as a hostage.

So no, the reviewer should not feel free to make non-trivial change to somebody else's ticket. The way I work as a reviewer is to push non-trivial changes to another branch and say to the author: "Here it is and here is what it does, add it to your branch if you agree with them".

And modulo the fact that you removed a feature that I said I wanted, that you did not ask first, and that you overwrote my branch. That's the difference between asking politely and taking over.

A polytope could as well be defined using rational data, and still happen to have integer vertices. So I think it should be made available for general polytopes.
If it's not a lattice polytope, LattE will signal an error.

Why can't `cdd_file_format` just be a low-level interface? I don't see why we should complicate those functions with a `file_output` argument. Especially since the user can simply use

```
with open(...) as f:
    f.write(cdd_Hrepresentation(...))
```

What do you mean by that? In those two functions, the `file_output` argument is used to write the file.
