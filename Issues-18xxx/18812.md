Exposes the counting of the integer points of a polytope.. Mostly a copy/paste from `ehrhart_polynomial`.

This branch also adds a `file_output` optional flag to `cdd_Hrepresentation` and `cdd_Vrepresentation`. The functions calling external executable already contain sufficiently non-mathematical code.

It makes life easier, and it seems that this file format is standard. Why would you oppose having a way to store a polytope into a file?

Or do you want `.write_cdd_Hrepresentation` and `.write_cdd_Vrepresentation` instead?

> Can't `latte_int` read the problem from stdin?


I don't know. But I think that we should be able to write polytopes to files regardless of whether `latte_int` can avoid it.

Making simple code more complicated. Writing to a file can already be done using

```
with open(filename, 'w') as f:
    f.write(whatever)
```

I don't see the advantage of the `file_input` argument here.

Here is that way:

```
with open(filename, 'w') as f:
    f.write(polyhedron.cdd_Hrepresentation())
```

Really, would you want a `file_input` argument to every function returning a string?

Do you prefer a `to_cdd_Hrepresentation` or anything else?

Why can't `cdd_file_format` just be a low-level interface? I don't see why we should complicate those functions with a `file_output` argument. Especially since the user can simply use

```
with open(...) as f:
    f.write(cdd_Hrepresentation(...))
```
