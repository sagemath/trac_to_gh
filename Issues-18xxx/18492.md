Isn't there a Python-3 equivalent of

```
sys.stdout = os.fdopen(sys.stdout.fileno(), 'w', 0)
```

Changing the `print` statement is **not** equivalent to changing `stdout`.

I agree, but no there isn't a python 3 equivalent: python 3 requires `sys.stdout` to be buffered, unless you start python with the `-u` (but you can also do that with python 2).
