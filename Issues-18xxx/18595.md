```
The following should **not** happen:

```
sage: PSR.<x> = PowerSeriesRing(ZZ)
sage: x + O(x^2) == x
True
sage: O(x) == 0
True
```

Also, currently it is not easy to check whether a power series contains an O-term (except by comparing representation strings...).

<div id="comment:2" align="right">comment:2</div>

It is not clear to me why the behaviour illustrated in the ticket is not desirable. It is certainly consistent with p-adics and with arithmetic:

```
sage: PSR.<x> = PowerSeriesRing(ZZ)
sage: a=x
sage: b=a+O(x^2)
sage: (a-b).is_zero()
True
sage: a==b
True
```
so changing the current behaviour would also require that `O(x^2) != 0`.

Also, checking whether an O-term is present is quite straightforward:

```
sage: (x+O(x^2)).precision_absolute()
2
sage: (x).precision_absolute()
+Infinity
```
I'd think close as Invalid. Please comment if you think otherwise.

I'll probably have to provide some more context. When I'm thinking of O-notation, I have http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation#Equals_sign in mind, that is I think of `O(f(x))` as the class of functions `g(x)` such that `|g(x)| <= C |f(x)|` holds for `x -> oo`. By abuse of notation, `g(x) = O(f(x))` then actually means `g(x) \in O(f(x))` -- and this leads to the problem that I do not agree with

```
sage: (x + (-x + O(x^2))).is_zero()
True
```

because while `0 = O(x^2)` (mathematically) translates to `0 \in O(x^2)`, which is true -- the converse, `O(x^2) = 0`, is not.

Unfortunately, I think this "one-way equality" cannot be modeled by `==` -- or can it? Or would this even be desireable?

However, apart from that, do you think that `is_zero` really shoud evaluate to `True` for `O(x)` and other "approximate" terms? Maybe this is not the best comparion, but consider the real interval field:

```
sage: RIF(0).is_zero()
True
sage: RIF((-0.1, 0.1)).is_zero()
False
```
This is more like the behavior I would expect from `O(x).is_zero()`. What do you think?

(Also: thanks for pointing me towards `precision_absolute()`, this (more or less) solves my original problem!)

That's a very good parallel and it is exactly the behaviour we have. If you want to do it using calculus-type limits, you should consider lim_{x->0}, though.

Well -- mea culpa. I meant to write `x -> 0`; for `x -> oo` everything is exactly the other way around (e.g. `x + O(x^2)` reduces to `O(x^2)`; there the O term can absorb smaller terms).

So, the interpretation I have in mind and the limit interpretation coincide. Sorry.

Of course, the limit definition only works when the point of approximation is an inner point; and that also exactly how these O terms that I think of are defined, for example, here: http://algo.inria.fr/flajolet/Publications/AnaCombi/book.pdf (p. 722).

```
sage: R.<x> = PowerSeriesRing(ZZ)
sage: R(0).is_zero()
True
sage: O(x).is_zero()
True
```

Following the behavior of RIF, I still would expect `O(x).is_zero()` to return False, because I see `0 + O(x)` like `RIF((-0.1, 0.1))`: an "approximate" zero.

> Algebraically, you get a much nicer definition. There `ZZ[This is the Trac macro *x* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#x-macro) = limproj_{n->oo} Z[x]/(x^n)` and O(x<sup>n</sup>) can then be identified with the kernel of the homomorphism `ZZ[This is the Trac macro *x* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#x-macro)-> Z[x]/(x^n)`.

I have to admit that this definition of formal power series is new for me; but I think I understand. I agree that within `ZZ[x]/(x)`, `O(x).is_zero()` should yield `True`. But in `ZZ[This is the Trac macro *x* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#x-macro)` too?

And finally: what about the following:

```
sage: O(x) == O(x^2)
True
```
Does this equality make sense to you?

Yes: the two "intervals" (neighbourhoods is perhaps a better term) overlap, so they could be representing the same element.

The advantage of this lax form of equality is that if you do computations with sufficient precision to tell all distinct elements you'll encounter apart, then you can use the conventional algorithms to arrive at an answer. That means that you can for instance do linear algebra with power series using normal tools, provided you start with enough precision. This works fairly well in practice and you'll usually discover a catastrophic loss of precision by not having any terms left. Of course, for serious applications you do have to use proper numerical methods anyway, but then you won't be using equality tests anyway.
