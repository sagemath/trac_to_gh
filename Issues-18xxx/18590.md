Coxeter sorting is used to define sortable elements of a Coxeter group.

New methods are:
* rank of the Coxeter group
* support of an element (the simple reflections that appear in the reduced expressions of the element)
* has_full_support tells if the support contains all simple reflections
* coxeter_sorting_word returns the c-sorting word of an element
* is_coxeter_sortable tells if an element is c-sortable
