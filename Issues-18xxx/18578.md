<div id="comment:0"></div>

There (among others) the three special functions `__div__()`, `__truediv__()` and `__floordiv__()`.

They are invoked by the division operators `/` and `//`:
* In Py2: `__div__()` and `__floordiv__()` are called.
* In Py2 (when <code>from \`__future__\` import division</code> is in effect): `__truediv__()` and `__floordiv__()` are called.
* In Py3: `__truediv__()` and `__floordiv__()` are called.
So in the last two cases `__div__()` is not called for `/` but `__truediv__()`. 
If `__truediv__()` is not available an exception is thrown.

Therefor classes defining `__div__()` must be checked that they also work in the last two cases! The related special function `__idiv__()` is effected too.

The ticket is tracked as a dependency of #15995.

A `cdef class` in Cython is really a different thing than a Python `class`. So it's normal that the same approach doesn't work.

You could (and should) use the `__div__ = __truediv__` trick for a `class` defined in Cython code.

Copying the code from `def __div__` to `def ___truediv__` clearly works - but there must be a better way!

Well, that's because you need to write

```
... cimport ...

cdef class ...
```
instead of

```

If you look at the traceback, you see why:

```
      File "sage/ext/fast_callable.pyx", line 918, in sage.ext.fast_callable.Expression.__div__ (build/cythonized/sage/ext/fast_callable.c:7203)
        return PyNumber_TrueDivide(self, other)
      File "sage/structure/element.pyx", line 2025, in sage.structure.element.RingElement.__truediv__ (build/cythonized/sage/structure/element.c:18064)
        return self.__div__(right)
      File "sage/structure/element.pyx", line 2038, in sage.structure.element.RingElement.__div__ (build/cythonized/sage/structure/element.c:18205)
        return coercion_model.bin_op(self, right, div)
      File "sage/structure/coerce.pyx", line 1040, in sage.structure.coerce.CoercionModel_cache_maps.bin_op (build/cythonized/sage/structure/coerce.c:9052)
        res = mul_method(x)
```
The problem is caused by this code in `element.pyx`:

```
    def __truediv__(self, right):
        # in sage all divs are true
        if not isinstance(self, Element):
            return coercion_model.bin_op(self, right, div)
        return self.__div__(right)
```
