In class :class:`AlternatingSignMatrix` (or FullyPackedLoop?):
* add a method for animating gyration orbits

This depends on Ticket# 18021 for adding method for listing the gyration orbits (in AlternatingSignMatrix or FullyPackedLoop class).

See Ticket #17988 for implementing FullyPackedLoop class.
