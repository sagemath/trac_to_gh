Still another bug: David, if I use the algorithm 'cuts+' instead of 'cuts', with the same code I gave you and the same input, the algorithm outputs a lot of times the following lines.

```
The approximation_factor is ignored when using the 'cuts+' algorithm. 
The additive_gap is ignored when using the 'cuts+' algorithm.

```
I tried many other inputs, and it worked flawlessly. Any clue?
