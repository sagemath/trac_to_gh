sage: Qx.<x>=PolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2-2)
sage: S = K.embeddings(RR)
sage: E=EllipticCurve([a,0])
sage: F = E.base_extend(S[0])
sage: F.plot(legend_label='b')
Launched png viewer for Graphics object consisting of 2 graphics primitives
```
The legend label appears twice, because

```

One could monkey in a solution for legend stuff but in truth there are a lot of legend options and so it would be better to have a cleaner solution, such as one that did the plots first and *then* passed in keyword arguments, if that were possible.
