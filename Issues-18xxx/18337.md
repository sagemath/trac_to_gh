For coherence we should have `imag` defined on real intervals:

```
sage: RR(3).real()

sage: RR(3).imag()
0
```

Lgtm. But I more and more think that there should be common base classes for all “real-like” and “complex-like” fields rather than separate implementations of stuff like that in every single one.

+1... and some normalization too, I found the following **very** bad

```
sage: RDF(-1)**(1/3)
NaN
sage: RR(-1)**(1/3)
0.500000000000000 + 0.866025403784439*I
sage: AA(-1)**(1/3)
-1
```

Thanks for the review.
