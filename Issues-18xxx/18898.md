The following does not sort the riggings, breaking an internal assumption of rigged configurations:

```
sage: RC = RiggedConfigurations(['D',4,1], [[2,1], [2,1], [2,3]])
sage: x = RC(partition_list=[[1], [1,1], [1], [1]], rigging_list=[[0], [2,1], [0], [0]])
sage: x.complement_rigging(True)

0[ ]0

2[ ]0
2[ ]1
