It seems that you linked, for example, `install-sh -> /usr/share/automake-1.13/install-sh`. I have `automake-1.15` installed, thus `install-sh` cannot be found.

In `Pynac 0.3.2`, these files were actually included in the `.tar.bz2`, I think.

This is strange. On Arch Linux, I have

```
sage -t --long --warn-long 81.6 src/doc/en/prep/Calculus.rst
    [57 tests, 11.79 s]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

and especially

```
sage: -1/2*log(-sin(1/8*pi) + 1) + 1/2*log(sin(1/8*pi) + 1)
1/2*log(sin(1/8*pi) + 1) - 1/2*log(-sin(1/8*pi) + 1)
```

Nothing changes in my results if I rebase this branch on top of `sage-6.7.beta0`.

Does anyone have an idea what could cause the change in the order of summands on OSX?
