The `CVXOPT` solver doesn't seem to be able to handle equations with `==` properly. For instance, the following example:

```
p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram(solver='CVXOPT', maximization=False)
x = p.new_variable(nonnegative=True)
y = p.new_variable(nonnegative=False)
p.add_constraint( 2 * x[0] + x[1] - y[0] <= 0)
p.add_constraint(x[0] + 3 * x[1] - y[0] <= 0)
p.add_constraint(x[0] + x[1] == 1)
p.set_objective(y[0])
p.solve()
p.get_values(x)
{0: 0.26990679350380004, 1: 0.1691067035243196}
```
The final result shouldn't be a feasible solution considering that `x_0 + x_1 == 1` should hold. However substituting the final constraint for

```
p.add_constraint(1<=x[0] + x[1] <= 1)
```
works fine.

What I need to understand is how `add_linear_constraint` in a backend is supposed to know that it deals with an equation. By comparing `lower_bound` and `upper_bound` ?

this is certainly not an optimal way; in fact `add_constraint` in `mip.pyx` simply throws away the information on whether we have an equation, or not. In general it is not straightforward to get it back, as some loss of precision can happen.
