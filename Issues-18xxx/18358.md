I met twice the same problem which is the nedd for a standalone function that given a python objects return an associated long (if it makes sense).

The following is not safe

```
cdef long f(x):
    return x
```
since `f(2/3)` would return `0` (see e.g. #18278). Moreover, one could expect something that would be very fast for both Python int and Sage integers (see #18346).

In view of your answer on sage-support, it might still be worth to have something along

```
cdef inline long long_or_LONG_MIN(x):
    if PyInt_CheckExact(x):
        return PyInt_AS_LONG(x)
    elif type(x) is Integer:
        if mpz_fits_slong_p((<Integer>x).value):
            return mpz_get_si((<Integer>x).value)
        else:
            return LONG_MIN
    else:
        try:
            return PyNumber_Index(x)
        except Exception:
            return LONG_MIN 
```
It would be faster for Python ints and Sage integers.

For Python `int`s, there will not be much difference (calling `PyNumber_Index(x)` on an `int` just returns `x`, so the only overhead is a function call and some reference counting).

For `Integer`, there is a larger gain. It's just annoying that Python doesn't allow defining a fast conversion `ArbitraryType` -> C `long`.

It does! It's called `tp_hash` :-). It's of course already taken for other purposes. We'd need an extra slot. Something along the lines of the conversion macro suggested in[comment:4](#comment%3A4) would probably be the best we can do without it.

Here is an experimental branch with a macro `pyobject_to_long` in `sage.misc.long`. I do not like the gestion of error but I do not know how to do better without affecting performance. Please tell me.

It is used in `Integer.__pow__` and `Rational.__pow__` as a proof of concept. And we win 20 precious nano seconds when the exponent is a small Sage Integer (~10%):

```
sage: timeit("2**5", number=400000, repeat=20)
400000 loops, best of 20: 248 ns per loop
sage: timeit("(2/3)**2", number=100000, repeat=20)
100000 loops, best of 20: 1.1 µs per loop
```
against

```
sage: timeit("2**5", number=400000, repeat=20)
400000 loops, best of 20: 228 ns per loop
sage: timeit("(2/3)**2", number=100000, repeat=20)
200000 loops, best of 30: 990 ns per loop
```
