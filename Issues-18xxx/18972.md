Hellooooooo,

1) The docstring must begin with a one-line sentence (http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#the-docstring-of-a-function-content)

2) small case (e.g.: `Graph.tutte_polynomial`)

3) If your methods only apply to undirected graphs, they should be in graph.py

4) Add doctests for your new constructor

5) This line is an insult to computer science: `idx = frozenset([self.vertices().index(v) for v in s])`It builds a list `n` times to compute the index of an element with a linear search. And I don't think that you need a `.Seydel_adjacency_matrix` or a new input type for this function. You can do it like that:

```
sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: s = {1,2,3,4}
sage: sc = set(g).difference(s)
sage: b = g.edge_boundary(s)
sage: g.add_edges((x,y) for x in s for y in sc)
sage: g.delete_edges(b)
```

6) A new method must be added to the index at the top of the file.

why, why... Tutte won't complain from the grave, but, you know, to me this feels like dancing on his tombstone... And I actually happened to know Jaap Seidel; I was a postdoc in Eindhoven, and he (and Jack van Lint, whose name just popped up on your 2-weights code ticket) were still there...

that's what you write as an 1:30am prototype, you know; thanks for pointing this out :-)

> And I don't think that you need a `.Seydel_adjacency_matrix` or a new input type for this function. 

Seidel adj.mat. has interesting spectral properties, and that's why it is there.
(one gets srgs out of it if it has just 2 distinct eigenvalues; as well, it is a means to construct cospectral graphs, by switching---which is matrix conjugation, and this is why you preserve the spectrum...)

So it is very useful on its own right.

OK; should there also be something done in src/doc ?

Well, I don't like much that all graphs constructors end with "Graph" but it's like a 'standard' problem. We either change them all, or none of them. And in the case of upper cases for family names, I expect that Sage has many occurrences of that.

I personally don't see the added value with respect to the adjacency matrix. For sure it is not needed as far as the switching method is concerned.

nonono, that's only needed when you create a new file.

I just posted a question on sage-devel: perhaps it's only me, and then I'll have to live with this :-)

In a similar vein you can say that Laplacian matrix should not be there, as it is a simple variation of the adjacency matrix, too...

It is there because we want to have readable code with readable documentation. It is syntactic sugar, if you wish. Of course you can say that all syntactic sugar is a waste of time and space, but without it you end up with obscure unreadable implementation...

I would not say that, for there are books written about the laplacian matrix is .... well. More confidential.

The only guy who uses this expression is Nicolas Thierry. If you want me to believe you are just trying to trick me into acting the way you want it, there is no better way.

Obscure? The 4 lines code?

There are many papers and book chapters written about Seidel adjacency matrix and Seidel switching.

And there are no books written `graph6`, yet it is there in full glory.

I don't know what you are talking about: go read https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar
Googling "syntactic sugar" gives you over 300,000 hits.


Anyhow, if you are not willing to allow `Seidel_adjacency_matrix` into Sage graphs, I'd stop working on this implementation now.

I had never heard of it before today. Hard to miss the laplacian matrix, though.

It was mostly a joke. I did not expect him to have invented the sentence.

> Anyhow, if you are not willing to allow `Seidel_adjacency_matrix` into Sage graphs, I'd stop working on this implementation now.

Did you hear me say that I "would not allow it"? For sure I don't like it, but that did not stop me from accepting code that other thought useful. Also, you add long lines of code to an already very very heavy constructor, while you could turn it into an adjacency matrix with a one-liner.. But that would result in possibly misleading error messages. 

What I said is that I do not see the added value and it is true. I said that the best way to write seydel_switching was to not use this new function. And also that it should be in small case unless a new standard is decided that applies to all of sage.

Really?  [#18785 comment:5](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/18785#comment:5) :-)
And it is all over the place in the twograph business...

OK, OK, I just was learning from your approach to ticket writing/abandoning ;-)

You have a talent for turning any conversation into a pointless word battle. But really, I don't think I heard of "Seydel adjacency matrix" before your ticket. And with good reason, it's almost equal to the adjacency matrix...

> OK, OK, I just was learning from your approach to ticket writing/abandoning ;-)

If you feel a bit of responsibility for that, perhaps you could help me get these tikets through instead of letting this code rot because of unsufferable reviewers.

You said there that Graph.vertices() is a plain list, and I should
make it a set, or something? (I guess a dictionary, as I need to know
the original indices)

It's a usual operation, find positions of vertices... E.g.
how do you construct subgraphs without essentially doing this?

>and you need to document what a `twograph_descendant` is. 

it's the composition of two documented functions, isn't it enough?

>I am not sure that this function should be in `Graph`, though. If it is just a bit faster than using the `TwoGraph` class, maybe it is enough to make it appear in a `seealso` inside of `twograph` and keep it in the `two_graph` module.

It is a hell of lot faster for cases with more than 100 vertices, say. `O(n^2)` vs `O(n^3)`.

>

Did you see the [patch for Chang graphs](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/5115728f80aa95f87a272feec999e317ccdffba4/src/sage/graphs/generators/families.py&id2=edb1b0870d25373a1cf8def52c5fe3159245f59d)? Do you think it is useless and should be removed?
(IMHO, Chang graphs should be constructed this way, not the way it's done at present).

I was refering to point 5 of [comment:1]. It contains code.

Neither `twograph_descendant` nor `TwoGraph.descendant` define what a descendant is.

We have very fast functions in modules, too. For hyperbolicity, for vertex separation, for.. Well, a lot of things. It can be made much faster, however, if you rewrite it to use `seidel_switching` and rewrite `seidel_switching` with the code of [comment:1].

It is unrelated to my point: this is nice indeed, but it merely uses `seidel_switching`, and that's it.

Look for `(275, 112, 30, 56)` in `strongly_regular_db.pyx`.

I changed `seidel_switching()` in the way you propose. As the function returns a new
graph, I needed to use `deepcopy(self)` (`copy(self)` is not enough). Perhaps there is a better way...

OK, oops, fixed in the next commit.

`SRG_279_150_85_75` is an example of a general construction, obtaining a `2-graph\*`-srg from a `2-graph`-srg. I'll try to add this in  `strongly_regular_graph` DB. 

Further on a followup ticket I'd like to have Taylor 2-graphs for `U_3(q)`, and the corresponding `2-graph\*`-srg (note that in this case there is no `2-graph` srg, as far as I understand). They should come from yet to be written more general function, that will also produce `U_d(q)`.

It added 4 on my branch, which might be behind yours. 294 vs 298.
Actually one more, as I removed an explicit construction for an srg on 279,
replacing it by this general function.

It will add more automatically, as we build more graphs on v+1 vertices which are tagged "2-graph".

This not a feature I would like to rely on. Using a non-boolean function as a boolean one
smells of a hack.

for some of them an explicit construction is referred to, and then it's just a question of
work. How many of these are so that "2-graph" is the only clue?

```
sage: 1 == True

sage: 2 == True
False
```

Regardless of that, and whether you like it or not removing `True ==` does the job, and works as intended. It is also in the documentation of the 'Unknown' truth value, and is tested in so many places that it can be trusted to work.

A lot. Run the `_check_db` function and you will see how many exactly. For some of them it is not the only thing on the line but it is still the only entry with no '?' flag.

Helloooooooooooooo,

Here is the review you requested:

- `TwoGraph` -- Probably should not be in the global namespace.

- Class documentation: there is none. Write one, and redirect toward the
  module's doc if necessary for the longer explanations.

- `is_regular` -- clashes with standard hypergraph terminology. Should be
  renamed (see #18986).

- `is_regular` -- parameters, role and definition not documented.

- Stop using map and filter. You do not know what it does, i.e. Python is not
  lisp. You are building in memory lists that you do not need, only to throw
  them away later. Use list-comprehension instead (also faster).

- `Graph([V, lambda i, j: frozenset((i,j)) in edges])` THINK ABOUT WHAT IT
  DOES. This is insulting.

- `complement` -- Rely on #18986.

- What the hell is this 'functions' in the middle of the file? Does it produce
  anything in the html doc?

- `#.  A Sage Seidel adjacency matrix` -- link toward the doc of seidel
  adjacency matrix, in case people might want to read a definition.

- `M[i,j]=-1 indicating that (i,j) is an edge, otherwise M[i,j]=1.` missing
  backticks.

- `data = data.change_ring(ZZ)` -- you don't copy a matrix just because you
  expect `Integer(1)` and get `float(1)`. Test that the entries belong to a set
  you like instead.

- Repeated sentence

  ```
  +        Returns the Seidel adjacency matrix of self.
  +
  +        Returns the Seidel adjacency matrix of the graph.
  ```

- The sentence that follows the repeated sentence is not very clear. Use a list
  to define the objects, it should make it clearer.

- `change_ring` -- should be a sphinx link

- Stop using `\` at the end of lines. If you need to span an instruction over
  several lines, it is more readable to use `()`, e.g.

  ```
  a = (1 +
       2 +
       3 )
  ```

- `seidel_switching` -- repeated sentence, as previously.

- Backticks are missing in the text again.

- Use `g.copy()` (which should be called by `copy(g)`), not deepcopy.

- Really, STOP using lambda functions. You don't know what it does, so stop
  that.

  ```
  +        return Graph([Nv+NonNv, lambda i, j: 
  +                        (i in NonNv and j in NonNv    and     i in self.neighbors(j)) or
  +                        (i in Nv    and j in Nv       and     i in self.neighbors(j)) or
  +                        (i in Nv    and j in NonNv    and not i in self.neighbors(j)) or
  +                        (j in Nv    and i in NonNv    and not i in self.neighbors(j))])
  ```
  Build this graph by adding edges to it. It will be incomparably
  faster. Writing code like this should not be allowed.

- `is_two_graph_descendant_of_srg` -- could you remove those '0' everywhere in
  the variables?

- `is_even`.

this is an urban myth that the latter is much faster:

```
sage: ll=range(50000)
sage: timeit('[x for x in ll if x%2==0]')
25 loops, best of 3: 19.8 ms per loop
sage: timeit('filter(lambda x: x%2==0, ll)')
25 loops, best of 3: 22.2 ms per loop
sage: timeit('[x**2 for x in ll]')
25 loops, best of 3: 19.7 ms per loop
sage: timeit('map(lambda x: x**2, ll)')
25 loops, best of 3: 23.7 ms per loop 
```

besides, I do find the list comprehension syntax ugly and error-prone. All  these
`for ah if that or what not` is very hard to parse for me. Yes, I wrote a bit of lisp code in my previous life, and my brain is damaged by parentheses. :-)

Indeed, I wish I could write `Graph(V,edges)` or `Graph([V,edges])` or even `Graph(edges)` instead. Why can't I? Why must I instead do something like 
`blah=Graph(V); blah.add_edges(edges); return blah`? Cause the GC is hungry and must be fed `blah` on each return?

I copied this one from the ` elif format == 'adjacency_matrix':` block. Should one fix both places?

the docs to `g.copy()` say something like "use only if you change the backend..."

```

     change the underlying implementation or weightedness.  Otherwise
     simply do "copy(g)" instead of "g.copy()".

well, I have v and v0, l and l0 - they are sets of parameters of different graphs...

I like it better than `%`, more readable: one does not need to swap out some other language in the head to recall the meaning. But if you insist...

There is no God above forbidding this syntax. If the constructor does not do what you want, then improve it.

In this situation, `Graph(edges)` simply works.

What your code does is this:

"For every pair of points among V, build a frozen set {i,j} then test if this set is contained in a LIST (linear time) of sets". That's ridiculous.

All that it says is that "g.copy()" is equivalent to "copy(g)", and that the latter should be preferred. The advantage of `g.copy()` is that you can give it additional arguments, e.g. change the backend.

I'd say that we can do without this warning, though.. To me it enforces a personal taste, not something we should ask users (or even developers) to follow. Makes no difference in what gets run.

Are you telling me that you are having a hard time remembering the meaning of `%` ? Is that a joke?

Besides, how many CPU instructions do you think it takes to compute a `%2` on a C int variable? Now, what happens when you load a function, turn the int into a Python object, compute '%2', then return the result?

I don't get it. Somewhere deep inside `Graph` there must be a fast way to check if two vertices are adjacent... I took it as `self.neighbour(j)` is actually something that takes constant time to invoke. If not, pray tell me how to check that two vertices are adjacent in a reasonably fast way.

`Graph.has_edge`.

> I took it as `self.neighbour(j)` is actually something that takes constant time to invoke.

It returns a list.

The right way to write this code is NOT to test for adjacency. Use `seidel_switching`, it takes a couple of lines at most.

You have not fixed the code of `twograph_descendant`, whose documentation also contains broken links.

I also find this function to be *very* specific, and I do not think that it should belong to the Graph class. What about moving it to this twograph module that you create?

It is not even a function. It is a method of Graph, and it produces a Graph. There are things in Graph that I also find very specific, yet they belong there by right.

Well, I am using 'has_edge' there now, which you say is fast. So the bottleneck of creating neighbour lists is gone, no?

Mind you, you said in comment 1 above that I should move these things to graph.py.
And it's not much code being added, compared to complicated algorithms not in Graph that you mention.
Anyway, we should open another ticket to reorganise the Graph module. I agree that Graph has a lot of methods, and they should be better organised.

Could we please keep it out for the moment? It is not for the code that I advocate this, it is merely for the length of the list of functions that appears to the user.

I don't mind improvng the `twograph_descendant` myself if that can ease the deal.

We already discussed here a similar issue and found that we talk about 5-10% loss (which can hardly be called huge)  no?
Perhaps making `Nv` and `NoNv` (frozen)sets will be an extra optimisation that I am willing to add, but other than that it's matter of taste, IMHO...

Look, I read what you wrote, and you wrote the following:

```
3) If your methods only apply to undirected graphs, they should be in graph.py
```

And I duly put the stuff into graph.py.

Dumping too much stuff directly into g.TAB (for g a Graph) is bound to cause a problem sooner or later.

Presently I find it absurd that we have e.g. `kirchhoff_symanzik_polynomial` but we cannot have `twograph_descendant`. Certainly there should be g.polynomial.TAB, 
g.graph.TAB, g.decomposition.TAB, g.matrix.TAB etc etc.

OK, this is a good argument. Perhaps it's better to move it to strongly_regular_db, 
where it is used, than to twographs?

Helloooo Dima,

Here is a first-pass review:

- Where exactly is the 'twograph' module to be found in the documentation? It
  does not belong to the main 'design' page.

- `is_regular_twograph` -- the first sentence of the docstring must be short
  (one line) and describe what the function does.

- doc of `descendant`: a sentence starts with an upper-case letter. Same with
  `complement()`, `twograph_descendant()`

- <code>\`\`self.ground_set()\`\`</code> -- should be a link.

- `is_twograph` -- you should rephrase the first sentence of the doc. An INPUT
  block is missing.

- Construction of chang graphs by switching: define K8 and T8 in the block that
  does that, not in the previous doc which does not use them.

- <code>:meth:\`sage.matrix.change_ring\`</code> -- broken link (appears twice)

- `seidel_matrix` INPUT for Graph: you must add doctests to test that it works,
  and to test your exceptions.

- `is_two_graph_descendant_of_srg` - what about those `v0,k0,l0,mu0` we
  already mentionned? `v,k,l,mu` would be easier to read.

Nathann

That's because Nicolas decided that the documentation of "combinat/" had to be handled in a different way from everything else in the doc. To me we should revert it to something that makes sense, and change everything or nothing at all. But I'm tired of fighting alone against people who protect their friends.

Helloooooooo Dima,

Here is another review. I also fixed a couple of things in a commit at `public/18972`.

- About `designs.is_twograph` -- this has nothing to do in the design catalog.

- About `designs.TwoGraph` -- I believe that it is the same: a class constructor
  does not have anything to do in the design catalog. You don't find
  `PermutationGroup` in `groups.<tab>`, and neither do you find `Graph` in
  `graphs.<tab>`. Note that there is an 'exception' in this case,
  i.e. `BlockDesign`, which (I believe) should also be removed, and for the same
  reasons.

- The first letter of the docstrings should be in upper case. I told you that
  already.

- There are still broken links. If you can't be bothered to read the doc, at
  least compile it with `--warn-links`.

- No need of indentation after a 'INPUT' block.

- Backticks are required around `True/False`.

- option `check` of `is_regular` -- checking that the input is indeed a twograph
  should be done in `TwoGraph.__init__`.

- Instead of `Return True if [...]`, it would be better to have `Test whether
  [...]`. Formally, a function that *always* returns `True` satisfies your
  description (I know, that's a stupid thing to say. Still).

- `complement` -- the default meaning of `.complement()` is different on
  `IncidenceStructure` and on `TwoGraph`. Could you conform to the most general
  specification?

- `T.is_t_design(k=3)` -- use `is_uniform`.

- It feels a bit weird that the default behaviour of `seidel_switching` is not
  to modify the graph inplace but to return a copy... I would have expected a
  `inplace=False` argument for that.

- Documentation of `seidel_switching`: some mathematical notations need
  backticks.

- Same function: the OUTPUT section is hardly necessary, given the first two
  lines of doc.

- `twograph` -- I am tired of reminding you to write doctests.

- Code of `twograph` -- please rewrite the code of this function decently.

- `is_two_graph_descendant_of_srg` -- you seem to have prefered 'twograph'
  everywhere else.

- Please build and read the doc of that function. Also, `lambda` should be
  `\lambda`.

Nathann

I hope it's OK.

I'm going to fix the rest and add a construction of two-graphs (more precisely, certain Seidel adj.matrices, from which the two-graph can be constructed, if needed) from doubly-transitive permutation groups, i.e. Taylor two-graphs.

With make? It must take a lot of time! I compile the doc with `sage -b && sage -docbuild reference/combinat html`. You can add a `--warn-links` flag to it to get a report of broken links.

HMmmmmm `:-/`

It is true that the "right" notion of "complement" really depends on what you do when it comes to hypergraphs. I made the other one the default because it applies to all hypergraphs, and not only to uniform ones.

I thought for a while of your proposition to make it a `new method`, but then why don't you just use `.complement(uniform=True)`? If you are ready to leave `.complement` as it is and to create a new function, then do you really need that function?

> well, I don't like inplace things. I don't even have an inplace option for this function.

It's surprising, at least for me. Would you object if I added a commit that makes it an inplace function, with an optional `inplace=False` to get a copy?

> I'm going to fix the rest and add a construction of two-graphs (more precisely, certain Seidel adj.matrices, from which the two-graph can be constructed, if needed) from doubly-transitive permutation groups, i.e. Taylor two-graphs.

Nice. Could you please do that in another ticket, please? This one is already dozens of commits long.

If you are ready to leave `.complement` as it is and to create a new function, then do you really need that function?\n\n\nWell, the rationale behind the current code is that someone who wants to take the complement of a two-graph should just call `.complement()` rather than something more complicated. And indeed, the complement of a two-graph has a well-established meaning. It's more an implementation artefact that the base class already has `complement()` defined, and it's not quite the same. The user should not care about this IMHO.\n\nSame was with `is_regular()`, but you didn't like this as it clashed with the default, and I made it `is_regular_twograph()`.\n\nIt looks rather incoherent now; I'd personally prefer to revert to my old `is_regular()`, and keep the current `complement()`.\n\n\n> \n> > well, I don't like inplace things.

Well, the rationale behind the current code is that someone who wants to take the complement of a two-graph should just call `.complement()` rather than something more complicated. And indeed, the complement of a two-graph has a well-established meaning. It's more an implementation artefact that the base class already has `complement()` defined, and it's not quite the same. The user should not care about this IMHO.

Same was with `is_regular()`, but you didn't like this as it clashed with the default, and I made it `is_regular_twograph()`.

It looks rather incoherent now; I'd personally prefer to revert to my old `is_regular()`, and keep the current `complement()`.

no problem, go ahead with this.

OK, on another ticket then, no problem.

I agree with everything you just said, but there is this other definition above that is inherited, and we can't really change that definition either for it would only apply to uniform hypergraphs...

I see only one way out: what would you think of making the *default* of `.complement()` to only work for uniform hypergraphs? If we do that, then the problem is solved in a more elegant way. Though `complement` would not work for all instances but then, perhaps *that* is less surprising. And we can make the exception "smart" to indicate that a keyword can change this behaviour.

> Same was with `is_regular()`, but you didn't like this as it clashed with the default, and I made it `is_regular_twograph()`.

I take this a bit differently: surely there is such a thing as a "regular two-graph", but you can't work on hypergraphs and not know the other definition, i.e. of 'regular hypergraph'. So to me, this is less surprising and indeed something like `is_twograph_regular` can make sense.

A `twograph_complement` looks very odd, as the definition of complement you need has nothing to do with twographs specifically.

Why? I see no harm in this, as this is merely an implementation detail, provided this is documented, and this I can certainly do.

Well, I don't recall what `regular hypergraph` is. 
(I know where to look it up, but I don't remember its meaning)

At least this would be unambigous.

Please address all the comments or tell my why you chose not to. I can still see `designs.TwoGraph`.

Dima, you are no children: you can't just address some of the comments without saying anything and let me figure out what exactly you did, and what you left out.

I don't call `is_t_design()` this way! I also set `t=2`. And surely enough, it's a different story:

```
sage: T = IncidenceStructure([[0,1,2],[3,4,5]])
sage: T.is_t_design(t=2,k=3)
False
```

You might be confused by the terminology difference that I already explained, that regularity of two-graphs and of hypergraphs are different notions. 

In fact, this term is hugely overused in maths in general; there are regular maps, regular rings, regular sequences, regular graphs  (which in algebraic are totally different animals from regular (hyper)graphs), regular points, etc etc etc...

Yes we can (for Janko 1, 2, 3 then, not only 2). How about
`groups.permutation.Janko(k)` getting an extra parameter, `degree`?
Then `groups.permutation.Janko(k)` will give what the do now, and
`groups.permutation.Janko(k,degree=blah)` will give a permutation representation of Janko(k)
of degree blah (if one is known to Sage). 
Actually, there is no need to store permutations on 280 points, we can get by with ones on 100 points, and generate the former on the fly, as an action on sets.

But this begs for another ticket.

degree of a transitive permutation group is the size of its natural domain. E.g. the symmetric group S_n has degree n... And of course degree is a greatly overused word in maths...

This is actually just not true. `is_regular+is_uniform(k=3)` is equivalent
to `is_t_design(t=1, k=3)`.
In fact, all I need `is_uniform(k=3)`, which is equivalent to to  `is_t_design(k=3)`.

It is equivalent in term of answers but not in terms of running time, though. So please use `T.is_uniform`, whose intent is also much clearer.

No. I asked you to *not make it appear in the catalog* (which is different). In the same way that you do not see the following classes (that I also created): `BalancedIncompleteBlockDesign`, `GroupDivisibleDesign`, `PairwiseBalancedDesign`.

Catalogs are not meant to hold generic class constructors (you don't see Graph in 'graphs.' or `PermutationGroup` in `group.`), but only functions meant to return a "famous object". That's what catalogs are for. And 'TwoGraph', like 'BalancedIncompleteBlockDesign', is to be instanciated with a list of blocks (like `IncidenceStructure` or `BalancedIncompleteBlockDesign`) while orthogonal arrays (which appear in `designs.<tab>`) are created from a pair of integers only.

I mean. That's what catalogs are supposed to hold. You have `matrix.ones` but not `matrix.Matrix`.

Perhaps some of them are (misnamed?) functions, I didn't check.

this is an unfair comparison, for `Graph` and `PermutationGroup` are in global space! 
And you told me to remove `TwoGraph` from it, which I duly did.

> but only functions meant to return a "famous object". That's what catalogs are for. And 'TwoGraph', like 'BalancedIncompleteBlockDesign', is to be instanciated with a list of blocks (like `IncidenceStructure` or `BalancedIncompleteBlockDesign`) while orthogonal arrays (which appear in `designs.<tab>`) are created from a pair of integers only.

So what? There isn't much difference between a pair of integers, and a list of lists, from user's point of view in particular. It's quite an artificial distinction here, invisible at user level, be it function, or class, or shmass, whatever. It returns an object, to which one can apply methods, this is what counts. A user does not care whether he calls a function, or a class constructor directly.

Catalog are there for users, and it's just an extra needless hoop for a user to jump through, having to import stuff explicitly, if she wants to call a constructor directly.

I asked the question on sage-devel. It's quite legitimate, actually.

You did not. I still have `designs.TwoGraph` when I load your branch.

I do not defend a blind distinction between class/function here. It is more relative to "the amount of data you give the constructor", and "what you get". I posted about this on sage-devel to see what others think.

> Catalog are there for users, and it's just an extra needless hoop for a user to jump through, having to import stuff explicitly, if she wants to call a constructor directly.

Well, it's not like everybody is waiting to instanciate `TwoGraph` in the first place, but of course the question is fair: if we cannot export everything to the global namespace like it was apparently done before, what are we meant to do with the new classes?

Let's hope the thread will clear things up, and not be the usual "I talk but I don't listen" thread.

ditto for, say, `WittDesign`, right?

May I refer to a precedent of having classes in `design` catalog to have `TwoGraph` here?

A precedent is a [precedent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precedent), and reviewers are to act in a fair and objective manner, akin to judges in  a legal system, right?

An "error", approved by something or somebody whose authority you recognise, is a precedent.
Either you object to this authority, in an acceptable way, e.g. you open a ticket removing that "error", and actually get it reviewed and removed (just shouting about it is not enough, sorry). Or it stays as it is, and then you have no authority to overrule the precedent.

An "error" resulting in an improvement of the situation is not an error.
The is the whole point of this discussion.
You agree that having useful constructors discoverable by means of TAB is useful, yet
keep telling me that this is an error. If there is a real error here, it is in your head.
We are building a system that is meant to be user-friendly; forcing the user to import stuff (which is hard to find too) explicitly is not user-friendly.

sometimes what you find acceptable pisses many people off, and you are perfectly aware of this :-)

get it approved; e.g. try asking me to review it ;-)

True, but I would like to have a solution with respect to these things in the global namespace too. We do need a way to define new classes without exporting them to the global namespace.

well, you have invented it already, with `IncidenceSystem`. True, lots of deprecations ahead --- how else would you manage to clean up the global namespace?

At the moment on this ticket you pursue the line that the classes must be hidden from the user, and this is totally unreasonable, you admit it yourself.
IMHO either having `TwoGraph` out there in the global namespace (with 10000 other things already there), or having it in designs.TAB is reasonable; pick one, and let us move on.

> You are not alone, for many scientific discoveries were made this way, by mistake...

Let me sum it up:
1) You tell me that I am forced to accept it because there is a precedent and that somebody thought that it would be better this way. So I should obey his judgement.
2) You learn that I did it myself, and I tell you that it was a mistake.
3) You tell me that I should do it anyway, because many mistakes are valuable.

I just see you bend the truth wherever it can help you.

> well, you have invented it already, with `IncidenceSystem`. True, lots of deprecations ahead --- how else would you manage to clean up the global namespace?

That's a design decision for sage-devel.

> At the moment on this ticket you pursue the line that the classes must be hidden from the user

I spent weeks writing code that has to be imported manually. Nobody died.

> you admit it yourself.

I am the only reference, when it comes to figure out what *I* think.

> IMHO either having `TwoGraph` out there in the global namespace (with 10000 other things already there), or having it in designs.TAB is reasonable; pick one, and let us move on.

This is not the choice we have to make. The choice it between:
1) Global namespace (No)
2) Manual import (possible)
3) `designs.TwoGraph` -- must be a collective decision to move everything into the catalogs.

So we are not stuck. If you pick 2, we can have this ticket pass right now and discuss 3 on sage-devel while being able to continue the development of this SRG module. You will easily admit that it does not block us for anything.

Helloooo again Dima,

Thank you for what you just did. I am not even against the idea of moving all
class constructors to the catalogs, but so far it is not done this way and I do
not want it to be done without collective agreement that it is what should be
done. So I'll not even fight against the idea in this debate.

About your branch, I noticed several last things:

- very long lines in the doc of `is_twograph_descendant`, `twograph`, and
  `complement`.

- I also wonder about `TwoGraph.__init__`: what is the best behavior for this
  class which inherits from `IncidenceStructure`? Should all (existing)
  arguments of `IncidenceStructure.__init__` appear in `TwoGraph.__init__`, or
  should we use `**kwargs` instead? If some argument in `IncidenceStructure` is
  added/removed, or if the default value changes, then we will very probably
  "forget" to update `TwoGraph.__init__` as a result.

AAAAnd then we should be done with this ticket, at long long last..

Nathann

Removing will cause a doctest failure, hopefully...

How does one mix `**kwargs` and explicit keywords (which have to be used too, as I need

The "official" rule, if I remember correctly, is to follow "yet another senseless" PEP. If I make no mistake, it is something like 80 characters for the code and 72 characters for the doc (no joke).

In Sage it seems that we apply 80 characters everywhere, which is already rather boring to enforce.

> Removing will cause a doctest failure, hopefully...

Err, right...

> How does one mix `**kwargs` and explicit keywords (which have to be used too, as I need
> some control over this)?

In the natural way:

```
sage: def a(hey=3,**kwargs):
....:     print hey, kwargs
....:     
sage: a(6)
6 {}
sage: a(hey=9,eeee=4)
9 {'eeee': 4}
```
