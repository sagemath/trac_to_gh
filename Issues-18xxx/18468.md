This ticket adds a package of name sage.geometry.bott_bundles to compute cohomology and rank of some homogeneous vector bundles over flag manifolds via Bott's theorem for the general linear group, see [w] in the documentation. 

There is a lot of work to do on flag manifolds, but it seems it works quite well with grassmannians, while performing a Schur functor can be really slow.

We appreciate any review.

according to the patchbot:

Missing doctests  geometry/bott_bundles.py 33 / 36 = 91%

You need to doctest every single function to reach 100% coverage

Hello,

you do not need to run the patchbot, you can just have a look at the result of the existing patchbots, by clicking on the colored round icon at the top right of this page. This leads to the page where you can find the reports on your ticket. There is only one report so far because you are not a "trusted author" yet.

a few more things::

EXAPLES should be EXAMPLES

pletysm should be plethysm

The TODO:: should really be `.. TODO::` with .. and space before

you can check coverage of a file by running sage -coverage filename.py

Since there is a lot more that one could do with flag manifolds I'd suggest a new directory `sage/geometry/flag_manifold` and at least separate files for the base space and bundles. 

Can you go through the comments and
* remove everything that is not needed: `# nu[j]=nu[j+1]-1` and so on
* remove debug print statements
* translate comments to English, I don't speak Spanish and have no idea what you mean

Style guide issue: INPUT has two dashes between name and description
http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#the-docstring-of-a-function-content

```
INPUT:

- ``p`` -- (default: 2) a positive prime integer.
```

Integration with the rest of Sage: object should at least inherit from SageObject and use `_repr_` instead of `__repr__`. There is a lot more, e.g. the semigroup structure on bundles etc but thats at least a start.

Constructors (and methods in general) should never print anything as side effect, otherwise you can't really use them as building blocks elsewhere. Only `_repr_` should return a description. If you want a more detailed description, add a special method for that (`explain()` or so).

Instead of `.Q()`, consider more descriptive names like `.universal_quotient_bundle()`. Tab completion will then be much more useful. Or collect them into an intermediate property like `.bundle.universal_quotient()` (see also #15328)

Moreover, making it a child class from the flag manifolds class would require some changes in `schemes` directory, and we are too afraid to change these files. Therefore, we still remain in `geometry`.\n\nIn the end, we decided to leave the base spaces in `bott_bunlde.py` and we have not created a `flag_manifold.py` file. The main reason is that we could not manage to code methods like universal_quotient_bundle, since it seems that we need `bott_bundle.py` calling `flag_manifold.py` and viceversa. We can rework it if someone suggest us how to solve this problem of the double calling.\n\nInstead of two separate files, we have renamed the base space classes to include `ForBottBundles`. This way, names like `Grassmannian` are free to use for different purposes. \n\n\nAs before, we appreciate any new comments.",

> Since there is a lot more that one could do with flag manifolds I'd suggest a new directory `sage/geometry/flag_manifold` and at least separate files for the base space and bundles. 

We have created the directory `flag_manifold` and now moved the file inside it. It is now called `bott_bundle.py`, since using singular instead of plural seems to be the convention. 

We also have considered to include the file in `schemes`, instead of `geometry`, but it seeems that, while the dimension is easy to get, the partition that defines it as a flag manifold does not seem easy to extract from the object as a `scheme`. Moreover, making it a child class from the flag manifolds class would require some changes in `schemes` directory, and we are too afraid to change these files. Therefore, we still remain in `geometry`.

In the end, we decided to leave the base spaces in `bott_bunlde.py` and we have not created a `flag_manifold.py` file. The main reason is that we could not manage to code methods like universal_quotient_bundle, since it seems that we need `bott_bundle.py` calling `flag_manifold.py` and viceversa. We can rework it if someone suggest us how to solve this problem of the double calling.

Instead of two separate files, we have renamed the base space classes to include `ForBottBundles`. This way, names like `Grassmannian` are free to use for different purposes. 


As before, we appreciate any new comments.
