The purpose of this ticket is to upgrade `DirichletGroup` from an old-style `ParentWithMultiplicativeAbelianGens` to a proper `Parent`.

At the same time, we place `DirichletGroup` in the category of Abelian groups.

A couple of comments:

- Is `Groups().Commutative()` the best category? The `list` function seems like they should be in finite groups and that they are is finitely generated. I would say the category should be `Groups().Commutative().Finite().FinitelyGenerated()` (or at least a join with `EnumeratedSets`).

- While I doubt it was used, the `__cmp__` did put a total ordering on the parents which I think we should keep by implementing a `__lt__` (and using `@total_ordering`).

Looks good otherwise.

I don't like this very much.  First, the previous implementation actually does not make sense since it depends on a total ordering of all rings.  Second, I cannot imagine why one would like to totally order all Dirichlet groups over all rings.

1. In the docstring of `DirichletGroup_class`, could you replace

```
Group of Dirichlet characters modulo `N` over a ring `R`.
```
by

```
Group of Dirichlet characters modulo `N` with values in a ring `R`.
```
(or something similar)

2. In the check

```
if isinstance(x, (int, rings.Integer)) and x == 1:
```
I think it is better to remove `isinstance(x, (int, rings.Integer))` and allow any kind of `1` (but then you will probably need to add a `try`/`except` in case that `x == 1` fails).
