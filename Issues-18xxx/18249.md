Up to now, the attempt to inspect Python builtins with `?` results in a `TypeError`, raised by Python's inspect module. This is when the argspec or the source file is requested.

I suggest to return generic information. With the attached branch, we get

```
sage: range?
Docstring:
range(stop) -> list of integers range(start, stop[, step]) -> list of
integers

Return a list containing an arithmetic progression of integers.
range(i, j) returns [i, i+1, i+2, ..., j-1]; start (!) defaults to 0.
When step is given, it specifies the increment (or decrement). For
example, range(4) returns [0, 1, 2, 3].  The end point is omitted!
These are exactly the valid indices for a list of 4 elements.
Init docstring: x.__init__(...) initializes x; see help(type(x)) for signature
File:           
Type:           builtin_function_or_method
```
