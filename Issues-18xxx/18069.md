A bug affecting their creation from a coefficient list:

```
sage: pol = PolynomialRing(RIF, 'z', sparse=True)([RIF(-1, 1), RIF(-1,1)])
sage: pol.degree()
-1
```
and a related printing bug:

```
sage: pol = PolynomialRing(RIF, 'z', sparse=True)(RIF['x']([RIF(-1, 1), RIF(-1,1)]))
sage: pol.degree()
1
sage: pol
0
```
