This ticket enhances the currently implemented Huffman module by generalizing it to a q-nary Huffman and implementing a faster decoding method. In addition, some parts of it were rewritten and moved to new modules, which also form the basis for the newly implemented data compression schemes Shannon, Shannon-Fano and Shannon-Fano-Elias.

The implementation is meant for teaching purposes; all schemes provide a verbose output showing the encoding process in detail.

Hi Vincent,

someone started to make the current huffman also compatible with Python 3. I did now at least the same changes, but it is also not completely compatible by now.

Quick question: Is it necessary to merge the branch with the current version of Sage (for the automerging to succeed)?

Jan

Quick answer: yes.

If you modify a file that is also modified by some commits in the current beta then there are some merge conflict.
