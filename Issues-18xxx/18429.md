With the current version:

```
sage: M= matroids.named_matroids.T12()
sage: timeit("M.is_3connected()")
5 loops, best of 3: 91.4 ms per loop
sage: N= matroids.named_matroids.Terrahawk()
sage: timeit("N.is_3connected()")
5 loops, best of 3: 1.4 s per loop
sage: K=matroids.CompleteGraphic(7)
sage: timeit("K.is_3connected()")
5 loops, best of 3: 52.7 s per loop
```
With the proposed one:

```
sage: M=matroids.named_matroids.T12()
sage: timeit("M.is_3connected()")
125 loops, best of 3: 8.12 ms per loop
sage: N=matroids.named_matroids.Terrahawk()
sage: timeit("N.is_3connected()")
25 loops, best of 3: 20.7 ms per loop
sage: K=matroids.CompleteGraphic(7)
sage: timeit("K.is_3connected()")
5 loops, best of 3: 46.9 ms per loop
```
M has 12 elements, N has 16 elements, K has 21 elements. 


>Also should we just change this to a method `is_k_connected`, as I think all we'd need to change is `< 2` to `< k-1`?


It's a bit more work, you should enumerate all partitions of a fixed `(k-1)`-set into two sets, extend each of them them to a pair of disjoint `(k-1)`-sets from the ground set, then compute connectivity between the two sets. If you do this, there may be other optimizations to consider, like the best order in which to process these pairs.

But more importantly, k-connectivity is part of the plans for this 'google summer of code'. I do not want to interfere with those plans.
