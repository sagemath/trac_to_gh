There is a simple reduction from matroid connectivity to matroid intersection. Implement the connectivity function using this reduction. Use the connectivity function to improve the efficiency of is_3connected, which currently has a naive implementation.

Finally my sage installation is back on it's feet again. 

Now that I can properly test my own work I see that this patch still needs some work, so I'll upload my improved version later.

I could not resist adding functionality to is_3connected, namely returning a separation to certify that the matroid is nor 3-connected.
This did involve slightly altering the interface to the matroid intersection augmentation routine, to return the corresponding dual solution of a max-cardinality problem.

Do you have some timings between the current version and your proposed version of `is_3connected`? Also should we just change this to a method `is_k_connected`, as I think all we'd need to change is `< 2` to `< k-1`?

With the current version:

```
sage: M= matroids.named_matroids.T12()
sage: timeit("M.is_3connected()")
5 loops, best of 3: 91.4 ms per loop
sage: N= matroids.named_matroids.Terrahawk()
sage: timeit("N.is_3connected()")
5 loops, best of 3: 1.4 s per loop
sage: K=matroids.CompleteGraphic(7)
sage: timeit("K.is_3connected()")
5 loops, best of 3: 52.7 s per loop
```
With the proposed one:

```
sage: M=matroids.named_matroids.T12()
sage: timeit("M.is_3connected()")
125 loops, best of 3: 8.12 ms per loop
sage: N=matroids.named_matroids.Terrahawk()
sage: timeit("N.is_3connected()")
25 loops, best of 3: 20.7 ms per loop
sage: K=matroids.CompleteGraphic(7)
sage: timeit("K.is_3connected()")
5 loops, best of 3: 46.9 ms per loop
```
M has 12 elements, N has 16 elements, K has 21 elements. 


>Also should we just change this to a method `is_k_connected`, as I think all we'd need to change is `< 2` to `< k-1`?


It's a bit more work, you should enumerate all partitions of a fixed `(k-1)`-set into two sets, extend each of them them to a pair of disjoint `(k-1)`-sets from the ground set, then compute connectivity between the two sets. If you do this, there may be other optimizations to consider, like the best order in which to process these pairs.

But more importantly, k-connectivity is part of the plans for this 'google summer of code'. I do not want to interfere with those plans.
