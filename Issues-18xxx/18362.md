Would be better to test it on some linux 32 bits and an OS X. This is why I mentioned on which computer I did test it. If nobody shows up in a week for testing on other architecture, I will set the positive review.

Anyway I'll quickly build it on OS X and do a few tests. Once it's done, I'll set it to positive review.
