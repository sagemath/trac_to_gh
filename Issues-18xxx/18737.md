Implement a function `shuffle(t1,t2)` which, given a pair of skew standard tableaux `t1` and `t2`, such that the shape of `t2` extends the shape of `t1`, uses jeu de taquin slides to move all the squares of `t2` backwards and those of `t1` forwards until the tableaux of "passed through" each other.

This is called "tableau switching", "tableau shuffling", or "infusion" in various parts of the literature. It is related to the Littlewood-Richardson rule and to dual equivalence.

<a id='comment:7'></a>Well, this implementation will work for now.

I made some reviewer changes, and most notably I removed shuffle from being a method of the parent because you never referenced `self` in that method and you always had to create *all* skew tableaux (otherwise the method doesn't make sense being there as it might return an element not in that parent, much less it doesn't depend on which parent of skew tableaux your consider). I also merged in #18025 because I was partially worried about conflicts and because I changed a key for the Fulton reference.

If you're happy with my changes, then it is a positive review.
