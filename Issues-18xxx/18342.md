Within pari master, the gp numerical integral gives

```
? intnum(x=0,13,sin(x)+sin(x^2) + x)
%1 = 84.181815392229652966739838357234264357
```
but should be `85.1885681951527` (as it was with previous pari release). Increasing the precision, it gets better but the relative error is incredibly huge

```
? \p 30
   realprecision = 38 significant digits (30 digits displayed)
? intnum(x=0,13,sin(x)+sin(x^2) + x)
%2 = 84.1818153922296529667398383572
? \p 40
   realprecision = 57 significant digits (40 digits displayed)
? intnum(x=0,13,sin(x)+sin(x^2) + x)
%3 = 85.18860335415782535357810701961378283432
? \p 50
? intnum(x=0,13,sin(x)+sin(x^2) + x)
%4 = 85.188603354157825353578107019613782834315433312524
```
Tested on PARI master at commit `17795-d04cdd3` with an amd64.

The module docstring of `pari_instance.pyx` is not the place to document a specific function.
