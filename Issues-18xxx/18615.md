**** THIS IS A DUPLICATE ISSUE OF #18594 ****
This issue was merged in with #18594 and therefore that ticket should be used for verification of completeness. This ticket may be closed.

Update functionality to cluster seed in order to:
- Use c-vectors for faster calculations of mutations
- Update c, d and g vectors to use faster algorithms

Hello,
why is this a duplicate ? included in another ticket? Which one ?
it is always better to try to keep a small ticket size (but this is not a rule)
