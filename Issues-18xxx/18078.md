`cmake` has a test-suite run with `make test`. So a `spkg-check` file should be added to run this.

One more remark: you don't really need to split up `$MAKE` and `$MAKE install` in two steps, just `$MAKE install` is sufficient.

I suspect that we don't need the fully blown OSX cmake (we don't need OSXScriptLauncher probably), perhaps some options need to be used while building on OSX...

`cmake` has a test suite that can be run using `ctest`. I wrote a `spkg-check` and ran the tests on Linux. 3/382 tests fail, two of which is related to curl, and the other about a sleep command. I'm not sure whether these options will be required by packages in the future.
23 - curl (Failed)
178 - CTestTestUpload (Failed) 
218 - CTestTestStopTime (Failed)

I won't be surprised if this cmake won't be useful within Sage, as it might assume too much of the native OSX toolchain.

cmake was mentioned by me in a GSoC 2015 discussion regarding getting CSymPy into Sage; I expressed my doubts that cmake, which is used to configure CSymPy, is easy to deal with in Sage, based on some vague memories about cmake/Sage difficulties I saw.

I don't think there is a difficulty per see in using `cmake` on OS X.

I know. Although I have been trying very hard to think about fortran code in sage apart from lapack. I think the only fortran bits where you need a fortran compiler are in atlas, scipy and unfortunately for OS X: R.

We use the accelerate framework instead of Atlas on OS X, one less fortran thing.

A fortran compiler is needed while compiling scipy :( lots of fortran code in there.  

R is more pernicious, you need a fortran compiler on OS X because there is a bug preventing us to use accelerate. 

flang is just a dot on the horizon so far. At least they say they started work on it.

I don't even see dots, apart from some github repos untouched since 2013 or so.

We can consider going back to having a dedicated gfortran package, as it used to be the case before OSX 10.7 (IIRC) broken xcode trouble started, but otherwise use xcode's compilers.

And there are still parts of Sage which currently don't build with `clang`...

Otherwise, w.r.t. `gfortran` on MacOS X:  Revive `f2c`! ;-)

Thanks for trying to compile cmake.

A few comments:

* if csympy is the only package that requires cmake and cmake is impossible to build, we can also support an alternative build system in csympy

* I really like cmake, so let me try to fix these issues first, as I would prefer to keep cmake as the build system (but it needs to reliably build on OS X, both with clang and with gcc)

* I independently discovered lots of similar issues with building cmake with gcc on OS X 10.10 (https://github.com/hashdist/hashstack/issues/746), and just like you noticed, it builds fine with the native clang. As you can see, you can easily tell cmake not to compile in various things and rather reuse them from the system or Sage. I really believe all these issues can be fixed and I am also sure Kitware is itself interested in cmake being able to build, e.g. Robert Maynard from Kitware already commented on my issue above with some tips.

So I will have a look in the coming days and I will update this issue.

I guess this is still pretty much work in progress, but we certainly should use/tweak a couple of configure options for bootstrapping within Sage, such as for example

```
  --parallel=n            bootstrap cmake in parallel, where n is
                          number of nodes [1]

  --no-system-libs        use all cmake-provided third-party libraries
                          (default)

  --system-zlib           use system-installed zlib library
  --no-system-zlib        use cmake-provided zlib library (default)
  --system-bzip2          use system-installed bzip2 library
  --no-system-bzip2       use cmake-provided bzip2 library (default)

  ...
