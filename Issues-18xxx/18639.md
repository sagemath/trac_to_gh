There are several issues with the zero ideal in number fields:

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2-10)
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2-10)
sage: 0/K.ideal(a)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred in Sage.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* component of Sage has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off().
Sage will now terminate.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2-15)
sage: three = K.ideal(3)
sage: zero = K(0)
sage: three.divides(zero)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred in Sage.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* component of Sage has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off().
Sage will now terminate.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

```
sage: K.<a> = QuadraticField(-5) 
sage: K.ideal(0) * K.ideal(a+1,3)
...
PariError: incorrect type in basistoalg (t_MAT)
```

(and probably more)

I propose to do some redesign and add a new class `NumberFieldZeroIdeal` for just the zero ideal. Then most methods of the current `NumberFieldIdeal` should probably be moved to either or both of `NumberFieldZeroIdeal`/`NumberFieldFractionalIdeal`.

Depends on #18622

It's worse with #18622: it gives a segmentation fault.

In any case, I still think that allowing `(0)/I` is the proper fix here, so I'm boldly changing the ticket to do that.

You can always use the commit hash, that should always work:

```
git fetch trac  # or just "git fetch" depending on your configuration
git checkout f61588ecabefc84103c4daa40e648b76e6e58828
```

Are you sure? I ask because #18622 actually changes `__div__` to `_div_` so I find it hard to believe that you didn't get a conflict.

Good idea.  I think WIlliam and I considered this way back (see line 10 of the file in question -- it was in fact 28 Jan 2008, almost my first ever Sage development session, and took place in a hotel room in New Jersey where he and I had nothing else to do all day...)
