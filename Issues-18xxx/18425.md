Keywords: Weierstrass models

Whe E is an elliptic curve defined over a number field K of class number 1, then it has a global minimal model, and we have a method to compute it, namely E.global_minimal_model().

In the general case global minimal models may or may not exist.  This ticket will introduce a method E.has_minimal_model() which will determine this, and to find it when it does -- one cannot proceed one prime at a time as in the h=1 case.  Moreover, when there is no global minimal model the obstruction is that a certain ideal class is not principal, and we will provide a function which returns that class.  When the obstruction is not trivial there exist models which are minimal at all primes except at one prime in that class where the discriminant valuation is 12 more than the minimal valuation, and we provide a method returning such a model.

The above functionality is implemented using work of Kraus which gives a condition for when a pair of number field elements c4, c6 belong to an integral Weierstrass model.  This occurs if and only if it occurs locally at each prime, and only primes dividing 2 or 3 are hard to deal with.  In order to compute the corresponding integral model one needs to combine together the local transformations implicit in Kraus into a single global one.

I have written code which does this and tested it on thousands of curves defined over real quadratic fields of class numbers between 2 and 5, in order to have nicer models for these curves in the LMFDB.

The last commit applied the global minimal model reduction to the codomain of any isogeny over a number field (previously this was done over QQ only), which resulted in a lot of doctest changes, not just the changes of models but the resulting reordering of the curves in an isogeny class (which has no implicit meaning and s done using lexicographic order on the a-invariants).  This most of the changes in this last commit are trivial.

However one of the high degree examples in ell_number_field now takes too long.  Either that example now has to be removed (not tested), or we should make this automatic minimization just an option.  Still, the code needs review.

Sorry I missed that ticket -- I'm sure I looked (and see that I already did comment on it).

That would be great if you could!
