There is a bug in a corner case of the function `min_wt_vec_gap` as mentioned in this [sage-devel thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/pCV13cIrLVU).

Due to bad initialization of a variable.

A corner case, where the only vector in the code is [1...1], makes `min_wt_vec_gap` fail, as
mentioned here: https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/pCV13cIrLVU/b6V1El2XmuQJ

We fix this here.

Hello,

This is wrong

```diff
- TESTS:
+ TESTS::

If the length field is neither a Python int nor a Sage Integer, it will
raise an exception::
```
and the others as well.

Did you try to build the doc?
