Err. There is a function in Sage which is called `.centrality_degree`, whose aim is more or less to compute the degree.

Right now, it is done by building a `NetworkX` copy of the graph, then asking `NetworkX` to give us the degree (divided by n-1).

Turns out that we can do better.

Graph
    ...
    -  ``vertex_labels`` - only for implementation == 'c_graph'.
       Whether to allow any object as a vertex (slower), or
       only the integers 0, ..., n-1, where n is the number of vertices.
    ...

def is_overfull(self):
   ...
    A graph `G` on `n` vertices and `m` edges is said to
    be overfull if:
    ...

def clique_polynomial(self):
    ...
    This is the polynomial where the coefficient of `t^n` is the number of
    cliques in the graph with `n` vertices. The constant term of the
    clique polynomial is always taken to be one.
    ...
```
So even if it is standard, everywhere it is used it seems that there is precision about it. And I like it.
