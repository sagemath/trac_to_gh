Err. There is a function in Sage which is called `.centrality_degree`, whose aim is more or less to compute the degree.

Right now, it is done by building a `NetworkX` copy of the graph, then asking `NetworkX` to give us the degree (divided by n-1).

Turns out that we can do better.

    A graph `G` on `n` vertices and `m` edges is said to

    ...
    This is the polynomial where the coefficient of `t^n` is the number of

```
So even if it is standard, everywhere it is used it seems that there is precision about it. And I like it.
