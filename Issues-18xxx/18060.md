This is a new ticket for the algorithm I proposed in ticket #16935. The reason I create a new ticket for it is that there were modifications in the finite_word class (I did not know how to solve that problem otherwise). This aims to integrate the modifications already done by others in the class and the comments that have were written about ticket #16935.

Keywords: words, finite words, palindromes

Resolution: duplicate

I do not quite understand why you opened this new ticket. Is it exactly the same purpose as for ticket #16935? Furtheromre, in this ticket there seems to be a problem with the branch field which does not appear in the ticket description.
