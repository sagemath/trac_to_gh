If one has `Coin-or` installed (and a self compiled version of Sage) then a doctest fails in the linear programming tutorial

```
sage -t linear_programming.rst
**********************************************************************
File "linear_programming.rst", line 432, in doc.en.thematic_tutorials.linear_programming
Failed example:
    p.solve()  # rel tol 2e-12
Expected:
    2.0
Got:
    2.0000000000040004
Tolerance exceeded:
    2.0 vs 2.0000000000040004, tolerance 2e-12 > 2e-12
**********************************************************************
```
We just increase the tolerance to `2e-11`.

Yes. At least for me: [patchbot shortlog](http://patchbot.sagemath.org/log/18290/debian/8.0/x86_64/3.16.0-4-amd64/mangouste/2015-04-24%2018:09:55%20+0200?short)
