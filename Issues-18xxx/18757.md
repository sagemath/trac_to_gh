<type 'tuple'>

This seems unlogical. There is a class for integer partitions just like integer compositions. Also why don't `BooleanLattice(n)` return poset with (sub)sets as an elements? Of course there could be parameter like `elements='integers'` in all three.

And more, why don't `IntegerCompositions()` return a lattice instead of poset? Or should all functions have an argument for this, i.e. like `PentagonPoset(type='poset')`?

It is clear that `IntegerCompositions` should not return just a poset but a lattice. However, I have two real questions:

1) Should it be possible to return only poset when asked? It does not make any difference for `PentagonPoset()`, but `BooleanLattice(10)` is totally different thing. OTOH we could have functions that directly fill meet- and join-matrix when creating these special types of lattice. Or we could have some way to generate a lattice by trusting input and compute meet and join when they are first asked.

2) Should (almost) all poset examples have a parameter to tell what kind of elements it should have? Spesifically, if we find a direct way to make a lattice isomorphic to, say, `TamariLattice(n)`, we could save some computation time.

Attached patch shows what this could look like.

Bonus question: If answer to one or both is "yes", what should be the name of the parameter?
