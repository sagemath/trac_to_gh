I think what happened below is that the build system tried to use the sage-download-file script while Python was in the process of being installed. Rebuild works. We should probably use sage-native-execute python:

```
Found local metadata for ntl-6.2.1.p0
Attempting to download package ntl-6.2.1.p0
Could not find platform dependent libraries <exec_prefix>
Consider setting $PYTHONHOME to <prefix>[:<exec_prefix>]

Error: spkg file '/mnt/disk/home/buildslave-sage/slave/sage_git/build/upstream/ntl-6.2.1.tar.bz2' not found.
This shouldn't happen, it is a bug in the sage-spkg script.

I've tested this a few times now on a 16 core machine with different variations of `make -j` from 8 to 16, so there should have been a high likelihood of reproducing the problem (as I confirmed against the unmodified 8.4.beta4), but with this patch I did not have any problems, as expected.
