I think what happened below is that the build system tried to use the sage-download-file script while Python was in the process of being installed. Rebuild works. We should probably use sage-native-execute python:

```
Found local metadata for ntl-6.2.1.p0
Attempting to download package ntl-6.2.1.p0
Could not find platform dependent libraries <exec_prefix>
Consider setting $PYTHONHOME to <prefix>[:<exec_prefix>]

This shouldn't happen, it is a bug in the sage-spkg script.
