I think what happened below is that the build system tried to use the sage-download-file script while Python was in the process of being installed. Rebuild works. We should probably use sage-native-execute python:

```
Found local metadata for ntl-6.2.1.p0

Could not find platform dependent libraries <exec_prefix>

This shouldn't happen, it is a bug in the sage-spkg script.

This has been becoming more common as we integrate more Python tools into `sage-spkg`.  I feel that long term `sage-spkg` should be rewritten entirely in Python, but even that would not completely fix this problem.

<a id='comment:9'>**Comment 9:**</a>
See also #26083 for a similar report with some additional context.  This has been becoming more common as we integrate more Python tools into `sage-spkg`.  I feel that long term `sage-spkg` should be rewritten entirely in Python, but even that would not completely fix this problem.  I agree with the general approach of preferring to use the system Python for the build system; otherwise trying to use tools in `$SAGE_LOCAL` to build `$SAGE_LOCAL` is destined to result in problems.

I've tested this a few times now on a 16 core machine with different variations of `make -j` from 8 to 16, so there should have been a high likelihood of reproducing the problem (as I confirmed against the unmodified 8.4.beta4), but with this patch I did not have any problems, as expected.
