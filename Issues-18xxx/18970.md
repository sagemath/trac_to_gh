<a id='comment:6'></a>Before this patch

```
sage: %timeit log(QQ(8),2)
The slowest run took 5.08 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
10000 loops, best of 3: 39.4 µs per loop
sage: %timeit log(QQ(8),3)
10000 loops, best of 3: 38.1 µs per loop
sage: %timeit log(ZZ(8),3)
10000 loops, best of 3: 32.8 µs per loop
sage: %timeit log(ZZ(8),2)
The slowest run took 14.52 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.12 µs per loop
```
After

```
sage: %timeit log(QQ(8),3)
The slowest run took 37.28 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
10000 loops, best of 3: 48.8 µs per loop
sage: %timeit log(QQ(8),2)
The slowest run took 8.69 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
100000 loops, best of 3: 5.43 µs per loop
sage: %timeit log(ZZ(8),3)
10000 loops, best of 3: 48.4 µs per loop
sage: %timeit log(ZZ(8),2)
The slowest run took 8.80 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
100000 loops, best of 3: 5.34 µs per loop
```

I've repeated (differently) it due to the caching-warnings. Before

```
sage: timeit('log(QQ(8),3)', number=1, repeat=1)
1 loops, best of 1: 191 µs per loop
sage: timeit('log(QQ(8),2)', number=1, repeat=1)
1 loops, best of 1: 150 µs per loop
sage: timeit('log(ZZ(8),3)', number=1, repeat=1)
1 loops, best of 1: 125 µs per loop
sage: timeit('log(ZZ(8),2)', number=1, repeat=1)
1 loops, best of 1: 24.1 µs per loop
```
After

```
sage: timeit('log(QQ(8),3)', number=1, repeat=1)
1 loops, best of 1: 1.93 ms per loop
sage: timeit('log(QQ(8),2)', number=1, repeat=1)
1 loops, best of 1: 45.1 µs per loop
sage: timeit('log(ZZ(8),3)', number=1, repeat=1)
1 loops, best of 1: 158 µs per loop
sage: timeit('log(ZZ(8),2)', number=1, repeat=1)
1 loops, best of 1: 45.1 µs per loop
```

In particular `log(QQ(8),3)` becomes much slower (and only `log(QQ(8),2)` gains speed).

Does this make a difference on how to react to my comment? ;) ....or more seriously: I am not sure if I feel qualified enough to review a change in the `log`-function. I just saw the discussion on sage-devel and looked into the ticket and decided to give some comments.

<a id='comment:38'></a>LGTM. Timings on my laptop with branch:

```
sage: %timeit log(QQ(8),2)
The slowest run took 29.31 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.57 µs per loop
sage: %timeit log(QQ(8),3)
The slowest run took 4.03 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
10000 loops, best of 3: 35.5 µs per loop
sage: %timeit log(ZZ(8),3)
10000 loops, best of 3: 33 µs per loop
sage: %timeit log(ZZ(8),2)
The slowest run took 16.93 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000000 loops, best of 3: 887 ns per loop
```
vs. with `develop`:

```
sage: %timeit log(QQ(8),2)
The slowest run took 14987.26 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.6 µs per loop
sage: %timeit log(QQ(8),3)
10000 loops, best of 3: 43.2 µs per loop
sage: %timeit log(ZZ(8),3)
The slowest run took 4.42 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
10000 loops, best of 3: 38.9 µs per loop
sage: %timeit log(ZZ(8),2)
The slowest run took 14.23 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
