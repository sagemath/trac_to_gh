Before this patch

```
sage: %timeit log(QQ(8),2)
The slowest run took 5.08 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
10000 loops, best of 3: 39.4 µs per loop
sage: %timeit log(QQ(8),3)
10000 loops, best of 3: 38.1 µs per loop
sage: %timeit log(ZZ(8),3)
10000 loops, best of 3: 32.8 µs per loop
sage: %timeit log(ZZ(8),2)
The slowest run took 14.52 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.12 µs per loop
```
After

```
sage: %timeit log(QQ(8),3)
The slowest run took 37.28 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
10000 loops, best of 3: 48.8 µs per loop
sage: %timeit log(QQ(8),2)
The slowest run took 8.69 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
100000 loops, best of 3: 5.43 µs per loop
sage: %timeit log(ZZ(8),3)
10000 loops, best of 3: 48.4 µs per loop
sage: %timeit log(ZZ(8),2)
The slowest run took 8.80 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
100000 loops, best of 3: 5.34 µs per loop
```

I've repeated (differently) it due to the caching-warnings. Before

```
sage: timeit('log(QQ(8),3)', number=1, repeat=1)
1 loops, best of 1: 191 µs per loop
sage: timeit('log(QQ(8),2)', number=1, repeat=1)
1 loops, best of 1: 150 µs per loop
sage: timeit('log(ZZ(8),3)', number=1, repeat=1)
1 loops, best of 1: 125 µs per loop
sage: timeit('log(ZZ(8),2)', number=1, repeat=1)
1 loops, best of 1: 24.1 µs per loop
```
After

```
sage: timeit('log(QQ(8),3)', number=1, repeat=1)
1 loops, best of 1: 1.93 ms per loop
sage: timeit('log(QQ(8),2)', number=1, repeat=1)
1 loops, best of 1: 45.1 µs per loop
sage: timeit('log(ZZ(8),3)', number=1, repeat=1)
1 loops, best of 1: 158 µs per loop
sage: timeit('log(ZZ(8),2)', number=1, repeat=1)
1 loops, best of 1: 45.1 µs per loop
```

In particular `log(QQ(8),3)` becomes much slower (and only `log(QQ(8),2)` gains speed).

Is this a one-time comment, or do you plan to review to the end?

Does this make a difference on how to react to my comment? ;) ....or more seriously: I am not sure if I feel qualified enough to review a change in the `log`-function. I just saw the discussion on sage-devel and looked into the ticket and decided to give some comments.

The code at hand unconditionally tries to coerce the arguments into ZZ,QQ instead of checking the type first. Apart from the speed issue it also would benefit from moving completely into GiNaC: atm some cases are intercepted unnecessarily in `Function_log.__call__` which itself awkwardly calls Pynac.

I guess some of the speed regression is due to the at least partially redundant checking whether `arg == base**v`, and of course now *in addition* computing the valuation first in case the latter does *not* hold.  (At least it seemed to when I looked at it yesterday...)

Not sure how much the probably superfluous coercion contributes.

Timings with this branch. Before:

```
sage: %timeit log(QQ(8),2)
The slowest run took 10.96 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
10000 loops, best of 3: 40.1 µs per loop
sage: %timeit log(QQ(8),2)
10000 loops, best of 3: 40.2 µs per loop
sage: %timeit log(QQ(8),3)
10000 loops, best of 3: 40.5 µs per loop
sage: %timeit log(ZZ(8),3)
10000 loops, best of 3: 34.4 µs per loop
sage: %timeit log(ZZ(8),2)
The slowest run took 19.11 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000000 loops, best of 3: 886 ns per loop
```
After:

```
sage: %timeit log(QQ(8),2)
The slowest run took 15.53 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
10000 loops, best of 3: 26.7 µs per loop
sage: %timeit log(QQ(8),3)
The slowest run took 10.80 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
10000 loops, best of 3: 26.8 µs per loop
sage: %timeit log(ZZ(8),3)
10000 loops, best of 3: 30.2 µs per loop
sage: %timeit log(ZZ(8),2)
The slowest run took 17.37 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000000 loops, best of 3: 686 ns per loop
```
The single run measurements vary so much from run to run that I refrain from giving them here. The After values of `timeit('log(QQ(8),3)', number=1, repeat=1)` are however in the same range as the Before values (as well as the others).

LGTM. Timings on my laptop with branch:

```
sage: %timeit log(QQ(8),2)
The slowest run took 29.31 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.57 µs per loop
sage: %timeit log(QQ(8),3)
The slowest run took 4.03 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
10000 loops, best of 3: 35.5 µs per loop
sage: %timeit log(ZZ(8),3)
10000 loops, best of 3: 33 µs per loop
sage: %timeit log(ZZ(8),2)
The slowest run took 16.93 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000000 loops, best of 3: 887 ns per loop
```
vs. with `develop`:

```
sage: %timeit log(QQ(8),2)
The slowest run took 14987.26 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.6 µs per loop
sage: %timeit log(QQ(8),3)
10000 loops, best of 3: 43.2 µs per loop
sage: %timeit log(ZZ(8),3)
The slowest run took 4.42 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
10000 loops, best of 3: 38.9 µs per loop
sage: %timeit log(ZZ(8),2)
The slowest run took 14.23 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.06 µs per loop
