This ticket implements scalar fields on topological manifolds. This is a follow up of ticket #18529 within the [SageManifolds project](http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/). See the metaticket #18528 for an overview.
By *scalar field*, it is meant a continuous map f: M --> K, where K is a topological field and M a topological manifold over K.

This ticket implements the following Python classes:
- `CoordFunction`: abstract base class for coordinate functions, i.e. functions
  V\subset K<sup>n</sup> --> K, where V is some chart codomain and n=dim(M)
  - `CoordFunctionSymb`: symbolic coordinate functions
- `MultiCoordFunction`: functions V\subset K<sup>n</sup> --> K<sup>m</sup>, where V is some chart codomain and m some
  positive integer
- `ScalarFieldAlgebra`: set C<sup>0</sup>(M) of scalar fields M --> K as a commutative algebra over K 
  (Parent class)
- `ScalarField`: scalar field M --> K (Element class)
- `ExpressionNice`: a subclass of `sage.symbolic.expression.Expression` with enhanced display of callable symbolic expressions

Internally, `ScalarField`'s are described by their coordinate representations in various charts, which are implemented as a dictionary of `CoordFunction`'s, with the charts as keys. 
At the moment, there is only one concrete class for coordinate functions: `CoordFunctionSymb` (functions described by symbolic expressions of the coordinates), but in the future there should be numerical coordinate functions (hence the abstract base class `CoordFunction`).

**Documentation**:
The reference manual is produced by
`sage -docbuild reference/manifolds html`
It can also be accessed online at http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/doc/18640/reference/manifolds/
More documentation (e.g. example worksheets) can be found [here](http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/documentation.html).

+This ticket implements the following Python classes:
+- `CoordFunction`: abstract base class for coordinate functions, i.e. functions

+  - `CoordFunctionSymb`: symbolic coordinate functions

+  positive integer
+- `ScalarFieldAlgebra`: set C<sup>0</sup>(M) of scalar fields M --> K as a commutative algebra over K 
+  (Parent class)
+- `ScalarField`: scalar field M --> K (Element class)
+- `ExpressionNice`: a subclass of `sage.symbolic.expression.Expression` with enhanced display of callable symbolic expressions
+
+Internally, `ScalarField`'s are described by their coordinate representations in various charts, which are implemented as a dictionary of `CoordFunction`'s, with the charts as keys.

Yes there will be other subclasses of `CoordFunction`: a major project is to have a subclass for numerical functions, in order to deal with numerical manifolds (for instance computer-generated spacetimes on a grid). This was the very purpose for creating this ABC: it provides the unique interface with the rest of tensor calculus on manifolds, factoring out what has to be implemented by a concrete class (the abstract methods). So I think it is important to maintain the ABC.

Actually, perhaps `CoordFunction` should be a subclass of `Morphism`.


OK, I will give a try to this, introducing the proper algebra (no time to do it right now, though...)

Thanks. I didn't know about this.

Agreed.

`TopologicalManifold` sounds good, since this where the charts live in the current approach.

Indeed this reflects some bug in the latest pynac (cf. #20456); fortunately it is fixed by #20475; so if the latter is merged before the current ticket, we can leave the doctests as they are.

I guess what I am asking is how much of concrete class `CoordFunctionSym` can be lifted to the ABC?

It should be a fairly small class; a parent that takes a chart as input. I can work on this for my next commit.

When you say "the manifold," you are saying there is a unique manifold. Context makes it clear exactly which manifold you're talking about (and hence unique), but for something like documentation, "this manifold" better defines what you are reference (although personally, I would just replace it by ```self```...).

I will do this on the next commit.

So we will just watch what happens with #20475, which might means we need to mark them as `# known bug` and revert them in #20475.

Not much: I would say that `CoordFunctionSymb` is optimal: everything that could be lifted to the ABC `CoordFunction` is already  there. 

> > > Moreover, you could probably make any numerical coordinate chart be `._express` with the appropriate methods. However, I am wondering if there should be a parent for `CoordFunction` (and have `CoordFunction` be a subclass of `AlgebraElement`), which would allow you to not duplicate code and use the coercion framework. Actually, perhaps `CoordFunction` should be a subclass of `Morphism`.

OK thanks.

Context makes it clear exactly which manifold you're talking about (and hence unique), but for something like documentation, "this manifold" better defines what you are reference (although personally, I would just replace it by ```self```...).


Thanks for these explanations. As you, I would favor `self` (which is completely unambiguous), but I remember a discussion on sage-devel, the conclusion of which was that one should avoid the mention of `self` in the documentation, to make it more readable for newcomers. So let's go for "this manifold".

OK very good.

OK.

Thanks a lot for your work. It's nice to have the coordinate functions in the parent/element scheme! In the above commit, I have simply changed the category of the parent to `CommutativeAlgebras(SR)` and suppressed the alias `is_commutative`. I have also added a few doctests and made some slight improvements in the documentation.
>I started to use ```self``` because I recall less consensus on the sage-devel thread; a good chuck of code uses it; if we add more code, it becomes standard; and it simplifies a number of the doc sentences' structure. 

OK
>I did not implement as much coercion as might be possible (i.e., coordinate functions could coerce to the smallest chart they are defined on), but the door is open to do so. 

Indeed.

Fine.
