This ticket implements scalar fields on topological manifolds. This is a follow up of ticket #18529 within the [SageManifolds project](http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/). See the metaticket #18528 for an overview.
By *scalar field*, it is meant a continuous map f: M --> K, where K is a topological field and M a topological manifold over K.

This ticket implements the following Python classes:
- `CoordFunction`: abstract base class for coordinate functions, i.e. functions
  V\subset K<sup>n</sup> --> K, where V is some chart codomain and n=dim(M)
  - `CoordFunctionSymb`: symbolic coordinate functions
- `MultiCoordFunction`: functions V\subset K<sup>n</sup> --> K<sup>m</sup>, where V is some chart codomain and m some
  positive integer
- `ScalarFieldAlgebra`: set C<sup>0</sup>(M) of scalar fields M --> K as a commutative algebra over K 
  (Parent class)
- `ScalarField`: scalar field M --> K (Element class)
- `ExpressionNice`: a subclass of `sage.symbolic.expression.Expression` with enhanced display of callable symbolic expressions

Internally, `ScalarField`'s are described by their coordinate representations in various charts, which are implemented as a dictionary of `CoordFunction`'s, with the charts as keys. 
At the moment, there is only one concrete class for coordinate functions: `CoordFunctionSymb` (functions described by symbolic expressions of the coordinates), but in the future there should be numerical coordinate functions (hence the abstract base class `CoordFunction`).

**Documentation**:
The reference manual is produced by
`sage -docbuild reference/manifolds html`
It can also be accessed online at http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/doc/18640/reference/manifolds/
More documentation (e.g. example worksheets) can be found [here](http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/documentation.html).

Depends on #18529

+This ticket implements scalar fields on topological manifolds. This is a follow up of ticket #18529 within the [SageManifolds project](http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/). See the metaticket #18528 for an overview.
 By *scalar field*, it is meant a continuous map f: M --> K, where K is a topological field and M a topological manifold over K.

 Internally, `ScalarField`'s are described by their coordinate representations in various charts, which are implemented as a dictionary of `CoordFunction`'s, with the charts as keys. 
 At the moment, there is only one concrete class for coordinate functions: `CoordFunctionSymb` (functions described by symbolic expressions of the coordinates), but in the future there should be numerical coordinate functions (hence the abstract base class `CoordFunction`).

Replying to [@tscrim](#comment:28):

Thank you very much for working on this !

>- I am guessing there will eventually be another subclass of `CoordFunction`? At present, there does not seem to be a reason to have an ABC.

Yes there will be other subclasses of `CoordFunction`: a major project is to have a subclass for numerical functions, in order to deal with numerical manifolds (for instance computer-generated spacetimes on a grid). This was the very purpose for creating this ABC: it provides the unique interface with the rest of tensor calculus on manifolds, factoring out what has to be implemented by a concrete class (the abstract methods). So I think it is important to maintain the ABC.

> Moreover, you could probably make any numerical coordinate chart be `._express` with the appropriate methods. However, I am wondering if there should be a parent for `CoordFunction` (and have `CoordFunction` be a subclass of `AlgebraElement`), which would allow you to not duplicate code and use the coercion framework. Actually, perhaps `CoordFunction` should be a subclass of `Morphism`.

OK, I will give a try to this, introducing the proper algebra (no time to do it right now, though...)

>   Also, I converted the methods in `CoordFunction` to `@abstract_method` since these get picked up by the `TestSuite` as opposed to raising a `NotImplementedError`.

Thanks. I didn't know about this.

Agreed.

`TopologicalManifold` sounds good, since this where the charts live in the current approach.

Indeed this reflects some bug in the latest pynac (cf. #20456); fortunately it is fixed by #20475; so if the latter is merged before the current ticket, we can leave the doctests as they are.

> Yes there will be other subclasses of `CoordFunction`: a major project is to have a subclass for numerical functions, in order to deal with numerical manifolds (for instance computer-generated spacetimes on a grid). This was the very purpose for creating this ABC: it provides the unique interface with the rest of tensor calculus on manifolds, factoring out what has to be implemented by a concrete class (the abstract methods). So I think it is important to maintain the ABC.

I guess what I am asking is how much of concrete class `CoordFunctionSym` can be lifted to the ABC?

However, I am wondering if there should be a parent for `CoordFunction` (and have `CoordFunction` be a subclass of `AlgebraElement`), which would allow you to not duplicate code and use the coercion framework. Actually, perhaps `CoordFunction` should be a subclass of `Morphism`.

It should be a fairly small class; a parent that takes a chart as input. I can work on this for my next commit.

Moreover, it implies a certain amount of uniqueness to the manifold. However, there could be 2 different manifolds with the same dimension, name, etc.

When you say "the manifold," you are saying there is a unique manifold. Context makes it clear exactly which manifold you're talking about (and hence unique), but for something like documentation, "this manifold" better defines what you are reference (although personally, I would just replace it by <code>\`\`self\`\`</code>...).

I will do this on the next commit.

So we will just watch what happens with #20475, which might means we need to mark them as `# known bug` and revert them in #20475.

Not much: I would say that `CoordFunctionSymb` is optimal: everything that could be lifted to the ABC `CoordFunction` is already  there.

Thanks a lot for your work. It's nice to have the coordinate functions in the parent/element scheme! In the above commit, I have simply changed the category of the parent to `CommutativeAlgebras(SR)` and suppressed the alias `is_commutative`. I have also added a few doctests and made some slight improvements in the documentation.

Indeed.

Fine.
