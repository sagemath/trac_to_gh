I can reproduce the failure on linux32 under virtualbox.

The source appears to be a bug in MPIR.

If you run

#include "mpir.h"

int main()
{
    mpz_t one, x, w;
    mpz_init(one);
    mpz_init(x);
    mpz_init(w);
    mpz_set_str(one, "62165404551223330269422781018352605012557018849668464680057997111644937126566671941632", 10);
    mpz_set_str(x, "39623752663112484341451587580", 10);

    mpz_tdiv_q(w, one, x);
    gmp_printf("%Zd / %Zd = %Zd\n", one, x, w);
}

it outputs 

    62165404551223330269422781018352605012557018849668464680057997111644937126566671941632 / 39623752663112484341451587580 = 1568892406419848332919986945754866320479099155002496784035

but you can check with Python ints that the correct quotient should be

        1568892403497558507879962225846103176600476845510570267609

Regarding the divion bug, can someone tell me the value of SB_DIVAPPR_Q_SMALL_THRESHOLD and SB_DIV_QR_SMALL_THRESHOLD         on this machine, in gmp-mparam.h in MPIR.

If they are not 0, you will probably find setting them to 0 is a temporary workaround. If they are already 0 I wonder what on earth can have gone wrong.

I'm afraid I personally won't be able to fix this bug until late this month, but I have posted it on mpir-devel in case someone else can track it down.

If the gcc is 5.2 or above, it might also be worth building MPIR without optimisation (and check the CFLAGS doesn't contain -ansi : I don't think it does). We've had reports of what we think is miscompilation with recent gcc on Linux 32. We are still trying to track it down (code works fine under valgrind but otherwise does not).

Defining both SB_DIVAPPR_Q_SMALL_THRESHOLD and SB_DIV_QR_SMALL_THRESHOLD as 0 in gmp-mparam.h fixes the problem (these values are currently not defined at all).

The bug might be restricted to 32-bit installations on a 64-bit host, where MPIR has outdated tuneup values (my arch is x86/nehalem).

Since this is a rather serious bug affecting all of Sage, should it be a separate, blocker, ticket?

I'd say yes.

FWIW, I only tested the MPIR alphas stand-alone on Linux x86, on a true 32-bit processor.

Are you saying we should **rebase** these changes (and the other branches that depend on them) on top of #19820? I can do it, but in this case I think we should also rebase #19280 itself on top of sage-6.9.

Or do you want me to merge the branch there into this branch? (I'll do it if you want, but why? The other ticket is already a dependency, so this ticket won't get merged without it...)

Rebase or merge: either is fine for me. The reason I ask it is for easier review/testing. It's better if I can just do `git trac checkout <ticket number>` instead of manually needing to merge the dependencies. The fact that this branch has a *wrong* version of #19280 makes it even worse.

IMHO, rebasing destroys history and requires much more work, e.g., you *have* to merge the rebased ticket into all depending tickets, while a merge might just work without additional intervention.

Luckily, I never merged #18546 into #17220 and its dependencies; otherwise I'd have to remerge it again (although nothing relevant changed) and would have troubles in my private "develop" branch where I collect all tickets I authored in order to detect conflicts between apparently unrelated tickets early on.

Thus for me, rebasing something where somebody else might have based something (e.g., something pushed to a trac ticket) is something to avoid if at all possible.

I'll try that soon (currently, I have no sage available due to recompilation).

What I tried up to now:

1. I checked out this ticket, ran `make distclean` and then `make`. This resulted in a version of sage *with* `arb`.
2. I checkout out plain `6.10.beta0`, ran `make distclean` and then `make`, obviously resulting in a version without `arb`.
3. I checked out this ticket, ran `./configure` and `make`. Now everything is recompiling (*including* arb), however, `git diff` does show empty output, so while this would solve the problem for me, I cannot push it to the ticket.

What I do not understand: why is it necessary to add `arb` to `build/make/deps` for an existing version while it is unnecessary for a fresh install or for people running `./configure`?

Unfortunately, it is not obvious to me:

Following Volker's recommendation, I increased the patchlevel, following your recommendation, I added to `build/make/deps`, but `arb` is still not built.

Running `./configure` solves the problem locally, but does not change any files under version control, thus will not solve the problem for anybody else.

> If yes and it still doesn't work, please push your non-working branch (with the change to `build/make/deps`) and I'll have a look.

Pushed and thanks for having a look.

ok, this is not part of the pushed branch.

1. the new "install packages with dependencies" means that `./sage -i PKGNAME` needs a lot more time (running `./configure` takes some time). In particular, [Simon King complained about this](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-devel/fQCBuz8-d8k/discussion).

2. `./configure && make` is the standard way to build packages.

> The rules aren't configurable, they just reflect the package types and dependencies.

That's something which can (and should) change in the future. It would be cool to run for example

```
./configure --with-system-python --with-package=valgrind --enable-check=yes

Thats partly why I said that rerunning configure isn't the most straightforward way of updating the rules.

Configure switches can just override rules (e.g. using that explicit rules override pattern rules); that doesn't prevent us from writing a makefile that works by default.

I agree that `./configure && make` is the standard way but this is not what Sage used to do so its more of a social problem to a) agree on changing it and b) communicating that change. Write to sage-devel.

I don't think the buildbot is broken, it just does what the docs say and our users have learned to rely on. The alternative to fixing the configure/make system is always updating the confball if you change the set of standard packages.

Building Sage, then checking out a specific git branch and then rebuilding is not a normal build from source. So I don't think the installation manual applies here. What does apply is the developer's guide which does mention `./configure` (see [comment:60]).

> The alternative to fixing the configure/make system is always updating the confball if you change the set of standard packages. 

Updating the confball is not going to help if you don't even run `./configure`.
