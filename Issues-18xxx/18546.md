<a id='comment:21'></a>I can reproduce the failure on linux32 under virtualbox.

The source appears to be a bug in MPIR.

If you run

#include "mpir.h"

int main()
{
    mpz_t one, x, w;
    mpz_init(one);
    mpz_init(x);
    mpz_init(w);
    mpz_set_str(one, "62165404551223330269422781018352605012557018849668464680057997111644937126566671941632", 10);
    mpz_set_str(x, "39623752663112484341451587580", 10);

    mpz_tdiv_q(w, one, x);
    gmp_printf("%Zd / %Zd = %Zd\n", one, x, w);
}

it outputs 

    62165404551223330269422781018352605012557018849668464680057997111644937126566671941632 / 39623752663112484341451587580 = 1568892406419848332919986945754866320479099155002496784035

but you can check with Python ints that the correct quotient should be

        1568892403497558507879962225846103176600476845510570267609

If they are not 0, you will probably find setting them to 0 is a temporary workaround. If they are already 0 I wonder what on earth can have gone wrong.

I'm afraid I personally won't be able to fix this bug until late this month, but I have posted it on mpir-devel in case someone else can track it down.

I'd say yes.

FWIW, I only tested the MPIR alphas stand-alone on Linux x86, on a true 32-bit processor.

Are you saying we should **rebase** these changes (and the other branches that depend on them) on top of #19820? I can do it, but in this case I think we should also rebase #19280 itself on top of sage-6.9.

Luckily, I never merged #18546 into #17220 and its dependencies; otherwise I'd have to remerge it again (although nothing relevant changed) and would have troubles in my private "develop" branch where I collect all tickets I authored in order to detect conflicts between apparently unrelated tickets early on.

I'll try that soon (currently, I have no sage available due to recompilation).

What I tried up to now:

1. I checked out this ticket, ran `make distclean` and then `make`. This resulted in a version of sage *with* `arb`.
2. I checkout out plain `6.10.beta0`, ran `make distclean` and then `make`, obviously resulting in a version without `arb`.
3. I checked out this ticket, ran `./configure` and `make`. Now everything is recompiling (*including* arb), however, `git diff` does show empty output, so while this would solve the problem for me, I cannot push it to the ticket.

What I do not understand: why is it necessary to add `arb` to `build/make/deps` for an existing version while it is unnecessary for a fresh install or for people running `./configure`?

Unfortunately, it is not obvious to me:

Following Volker's recommendation, I increased the patchlevel, following your recommendation, I added to `build/make/deps`, but `arb` is still not built.

Running `./configure` solves the problem locally, but does not change any files under version control, thus will not solve the problem for anybody else.

> If yes and it still doesn't work, please push your non-working branch (with the change to `build/make/deps`) and I'll have a look.


Pushed and thanks for having a look.

1. the new "install packages with dependencies" means that `./sage -i PKGNAME` needs a lot more time (running `./configure` takes some time). In particular, [Simon King complained about this](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-devel/fQCBuz8-d8k/discussion).

2. `./configure && make` is the standard way to build packages.

> The rules aren't configurable, they just reflect the package types and dependencies.

That's something which can (and should) change in the future. It would be cool to run for example

```
./configure --with-system-python --with-package=valgrind --enable-check=yes

Configure switches can just override rules (e.g. using that explicit rules override pattern rules); that doesn't prevent us from writing a makefile that works by default.

I agree that `./configure && make` is the standard way but this is not what Sage used to do so its more of a social problem to a) agree on changing it and b) communicating that change. Write to sage-devel.

Building Sage, then checking out a specific git branch and then rebuilding is not a normal build from source. So I don't think the installation manual applies here. What does apply is the developer's guide which does mention `./configure` (see [comment:60]).

> The alternative to fixing the configure/make system is always updating the confball if you change the set of standard packages. 

Updating the confball is not going to help if you don't even run `./configure`.

That's of course *not* what he meant.

Increasing the Sage version when testing with tickets not yet merged into a public release seems natural, as you're doing so in order to prepare the *next* release, aren't you?
