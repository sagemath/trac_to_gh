Various Cython modules implementing matrices and vectors list

```
libraries = [BLAS, BLAS2]
```
in `src/module_list.py`.

However, nothing in Sage directly uses BLAS, it is only used through external libraries (linbox, numpy, ...). So it makes no sense to link to BLAS and nothing else, which means that this is a mistake.

---

I checked the commit history and these extensions listing only `BLAS, BLAS2` as libraries go back to #3498 and #4206:

```
commit a8b66cc30d4aca925c1e3a1c0bb69d0f4f62fbb1
Author: Jason Grout <jason-sage@creativetrax.com>
Date:   Wed Jul 9 19:54:35 2008 -0500

    Switch the RDF and CDF matrices to a numpy 1.2 backend; factor out common functionality to matrix_double_dense.pyx.
```
and

```
commit b07600d93461c717fc6702e99afd0f2cf2eeb1df
Author: Jason Grout <jason-sage@creativetrax.com>
Date:   Tue Nov 11 03:30:38 2008 -0600

    Change the RDF/CDF vector backend to numpy, and refactor the code to a common parent vector_double_dense.  Also change names of the classes to vector_real_double_dense and vector_complex_double_dense.
```

It seems that the backends were changed from GSL to Numpy and I guess that the BLAS libraries (needed for GSL) were simply kept.

There might also be the mistaken assumption that BLAS was needed for numpy. It's true that numpy uses BLAS, but we use numpy using the standard Python `import` mechanism, it's not the usual dynamic linking (there is no `-lnumpy` argument needed either).
