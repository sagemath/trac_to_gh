Html output also suffers from the EMBEDDED_MODE syndrome, it should actually return html expressions (instead of the empty string) and not rely on print()ing HTML to the screen doing anything.

The current behavior is:

```
sage: n=7
sage: L = map(None,[p for p in prime_range(n+1) if p%4==1],[p for p in prime_range(n+1) if p%4==3])
sage: L = [['',l[1]] if l[0] is None else l for l in L]
sage: T = [['$p\equiv 1\\text{ mod }(4)$','$p\equiv 3\\text{ mod }(4)$']]
sage: output = html(table(T+L,header_row=True))   # print() to stdout???
<html>
<div class="notruncate">
<table  class="table_form">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th><script type="math/tex">p\equiv 1\text{ mod }(4)</script></th>
<th><script type="math/tex">p\equiv 3\text{ mod }(4)</script></th>
</tr>
<tr class ="row-a">
<td><script type="math/tex">5</script></td>
<td><script type="math/tex">3</script></td>
</tr>
<tr class ="row-b">
<td></td>
<td><script type="math/tex">7</script></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
</html>
sage: repr(output)     # what?
''
sage: type(output)
<class 'sage.misc.html.HTMLExpr'>
```

What about interacts? Obviously the current `@interact` doesn't do anything desirable outside of SageNB. We could let `html(x)` actually do `show(html(x))` (*) inside an `@interact` in SageNB.

(*): Really just `show(table(...))` instead of `html(table(...))` since a table now defaults to HTML rich output if the backend supports HTML.

Is there a hook for checking whether we are running in the sage cell server? There is no sage.plot.plot.EMBEDDED_MODE...

What might be worth a thought is to have every top-level statement in an `@`interact-function show its rich output, e.g.

```
@interact
def f():
    plot(sin)         # shows plot
    plt = plot(sin)   # does not show
```

Just to be clear, there should be a way to get html output without something crazy in sagenb and sage cell.  Since `html()` usually historically actually *displayed* the html, if that isn't happening any more a very loud deprecation should say exactly how to make that happen (perhaps not using show), though my preference would be for it to continue as has been.

Since `html()` usually historically actually *displayed* the html, if that isn't happening any more a very loud deprecation should say exactly how to make that happen (perhaps not using show), though my preference would be for it to continue as has been.\n\n`show(table)` will show HTML table in the cell server. There are two independent steps - generating code for LaTeX/HTML/MathJax/whatever and displaying it. Separating them makes a lot of sense because you may want to use the code as a building block for something else before displaying and because displaying is backend specific and it should be as localized as possible for easy maintenance including seldom breaks rather than with every version bump.\n\nSo I am for making `latex(x)` and `html(x)` return the code without displaying it and requiring `show` or `pretty_print` or whatever else to actually display it. Table display in SageMathCell has been broken for a while with little complains, so I am not sure about necessity of deprecations there and I am not sure how I can keep printing something directly and displaying something returned as well.",

`show(table)` will show HTML table in the cell server. There are two independent steps - generating code for LaTeX/HTML/MathJax/whatever and displaying it. Separating them makes a lot of sense because you may want to use the code as a building block for something else before displaying and because displaying is backend specific and it should be as localized as possible for easy maintenance including seldom breaks rather than with every version bump.

So I am for making `latex(x)` and `html(x)` return the code without displaying it and requiring `show` or `pretty_print` or whatever else to actually display it. Table display in SageMathCell has been broken for a while with little complains, so I am not sure about necessity of deprecations there and I am not sure how I can keep printing something directly and displaying something returned as well.

No idea about sagenb, I only use html for interacts and since they are incompatible, it does not work to develop them there and then embed into cells.

After discovering that I have broken all my interacts (since they use html to place controls), I am a little less radical in changing the behaviour of `html(x)` ;-) I still would like it to mean "return HTML code for x and let me decide what to do later", but deprecation period is mandatory, I am just not clear how to implement it. Perhaps this will work:

- let `html(x)` print/display x and also through a deprecation warning
- make users call some `no_html_autoprinting` function that will suppress the deprecation AND printing
- after a year or so stop autoprinting, remove the warning, and deprecate `no_html_autoprinting`

Thoughts?

Nothing changed with html output, so SageNB works but the IPython notebook does not work without this ticket (and cannot work).

How about switch html() to return html code outside of `@`interact, and preserve the old behavior inside `@`interact for now. This is implemented in the branch, though the cell server probably changes `@`interact.

Then we can add a warning and you can get the new behavior with `@interact(html_autoprint=True)`.

So localize it to just `@`interact, and add some syntactic sugar on top.

Regarding tables:
- `html.table` should be gone
- `table` should have HTML pretty-printing.

Not that easy, pretty print will try to display something "reasonable" which will not be plain html code outside of the browser:

```
sage: pretty_print(HtmlFragment('<b>a</b>'))
\newcommand{\Bold}[1]{\mathbf{#1}}\verb|<b>a</b>|
```
This is because `pretty_print` tries to use the rich output (no match on the command line) and then falls back to latex. 

The HtmlFragment could provide a different representation, but it can't change the fact that the commandline cannot render html.

How on earth is somebody supposed to come up with `show`? And even if you find the many (and often misguided) examples in the docs, can you tell me what it does?

* Pretty print is a technical term: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prettyprint
* Python comes with pretty printer module https://docs.python.org/2/library/pprint.html
* IPython has its own `lib.pretty` https://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/api/generated/IPython.lib.pretty.html

Nope, I can't, but at least it's in a lot of places so people can find it.  So if `pretty_print` starts showing up lots of places (perhaps replacing a misguided `show`), they we should be golden.  There are various tutorial-esque parts of the Sage doc/tutorial as well  (perhaps where `html` used to appear as an example).

> Someone who knows what MathJax is and can write raw HTML is sophisticated enough to read some basic tutorial that better mention existence of pretty_print. It may be also a good idea to have a section of the tutorial specifically on displaying thing nicely.

They might not know about MathJax, just that there is a way to get things to look nice.  If there were sufficient places where it was all introduced (including the fragment business) that would be an acceptable solution, I think.

> * Pretty print is a technical term: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prettyprint

That proves my point, I think: it's not a term in general non-technical usage.

Seriously, is `print_pretty` a possibility as an alias, or is that just pointless?

Here is an example of what I mean.  You just did

```diff
-.. skip
-
-::
-
-    sage: html.table( [ (i,det(A^i)) for i in [0..4] ] )
-    <html>...</html>
+    sage: table( [ (i,det(A^i)) for i in [0..4] ] )
+      0   1
+      1   -2
+      2   4
+      3   -8
+      4   16
```
But now anyone using a notebook interface won't know how to make it "pretty".    Yet elsewhere in your diff you have `pretty_print(table(input))`.  This would have been a great opportunity to help teach people about this.  In one place you even **left** the wording

```
 Even better, we can put a header line on it to make it really clear what
 we are doing, by adding lists. We've seen keywords like ``header=True``
 when doing some of our plotting and limits. What do you think will
-happen if you put dollar signs around the labels in the header?
+happen if you put dollar signs around the labels in the header? ::
```
which makes absolutely no sense without the html/MathJax showing up in the notebook!

I guess it sacrifices `html(...)` on the last line and that's why you had to adjust doctests, but it is livable and I think is a great option. Karl-Dieter - are you happy with this one?

Regarding interacts, which are also supported by SMCs (SageMathCell and SageMathCloud ;-)) - what is "the right way" to adjust `sage.interacts.decorator.interact` to other UIs?

Do we need `math_parse`? It seems to me that the string `$x._latex_()$` should be a perfectly valid HTML for our UI, i.e. MathJax will process math. The advantage of not fiddling with LaTeX code beyond adding dollar signs, apart from simpler code, is that such a string can be used directly in LaTeX via SageTeX.

Typo: `def eval(self, s, locals=None):` has description for `globals` argument.

Why do we need this test:

```
+        OutputHtml = display_manager.types.OutputHtml
+        if OutputHtml in display_manager.supported_output():
+            return OutputHtml(self._html_())
```
isn't the point of all this display framework to make these decisions WITHOUT object's interference?

Is it really necessary to include `<html>` tag for SageNB?

You don't get any warning if it hits the displayhook

```
sage: html('foo')
foo
```
The action of the displayhook generates output like calling `pretty_print` after all, so  I'd call that a feature: It'll keep working after switching html() to return the fragment.

There isn't really a clean way to avoid double printing while actually returning the HtmlFragment...

Sage is not a HTML authoring tool. Any attempts at making Sage a HTML authoring tool will be to the detriment of users that want to use Sage for math. And you can always have your web browser display the source if you really are curious how its done. 

Once the deprecation period is over and html() actually returns a HtmlFragment you can use it like a string (combine, convert, save, print, ...) to work with the HTML source, but I still wouldn't want to advertise Sage as a HTML authoring tool.

> As a different question, what happens with `iframe` in this new behavior? 

Nothing, works like before (i.e. doesn't work for sites that prevent iframing like google.com)

The commandline can't display HTML output, so that tests is false. Not returning anything from `_rich_repr_` means that the ordinary `_repr_` is used, which here means ascii art table.

Hah!  I was right about all this silly stuff like "pretty_print".  Real-life users don't get all these conventions.

http://ask.sagemath.org/question/29450/is-there-a-way-to-fix-my-html-lines/ 

I love "about 8 weeks of my work were gobbled up".  Even if this is really a "bug" in the cell server, I don't think anyone was crying out for html to suddenly return a string.  

(And note that even if there is a regex that can solve all this user's woes, that is not really the correct solution, any more than the fact that my library's recent decision to completely change their web hierarchy has as a solution "email so-and-so for the new URL for that page".  We can't be handing out regex commands like candy all day long.)

I am crying for a) consistency and b) being able to construct HTML representations of objects.

When you call `latex(x)`, you do NOT get `x` displayed, instead you get LaTeX code for x which you can use to cook up LaTeX representation of a more complicated object. I want to have the same for `html(x)`.

The displayhook displays the result of the last expression:
* A cell containing 

  ``` 
  1/3  # <-- first expression
  2/3  # <-- second (=last) expression
  ```
  outputs `2/3`
* A cell containing 

  ```
  latex(1/3)
  latex(2/3)
  ```
  outputs `\frac{2}{3}`
* A cell containing 

  ```
  html(1/3)
  html(2/3)
  ```
  should output mathjax for 2/3.
