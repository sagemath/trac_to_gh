I agree, especially since on further investigation, my changes don't work. Doctests pass, but the commands no longer behave correctly in the notebook.

Can we make the change to `latex.py` here? That's a very minor doctest fix.

There one long failed doctest, which I will abbreviate:

```
File "src/sage/misc/latex.py", line 1083, in sage.misc.latex.Latex.?
Failed example:
    latex.eval("\ThisIsAnInvalidCommand", {}) # optional -- ImageMagick
Expected:
    An error
    ...
    No pages of output.
    <BLANKLINE>
Got:
    An error occurred.
    This is pdfTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.15 (TeX Live 2014) (preloaded format=pdflatex 2014.9.22)  8 JUN 2015 12:34
    entering extended mode
     restricted \write18 enabled.
     %&-line parsing enabled.

        [snip]

    <BLANKLINE>
    (./sage43.aux) ) 
    Here is how much of TeX's memory you used:
     2758 strings out of 493108
     34433 string characters out of 6134847
     90768 words of memory out of 5000000
     6200 multiletter control sequences out of 15000+600000
     4403 words of font info for 15 fonts, out of 8000000 for 9000
     1141 hyphenation exceptions out of 8191
     38i,1n,26p,260b,38s stack positions out of 5000i,500n,10000p,200000b,80000s
    <BLANKLINE>
    No pages of output.
    PDF statistics:
     0 PDF objects out of 1000 (max. 8388607)
     0 named destinations out of 1000 (max. 500000)
     1 words of extra memory for PDF output out of 10000 (max. 10000000)
    <BLANKLINE>
    <BLANKLINE>
**********************************************************************
1 item had failures:
   1 of   2 in sage.misc.latex.Latex.?
    [308 tests, 1 failure, 12.37 s]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage -t src/sage/misc/latex.py  # 1 doctest failed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```
So the issue is the extra lines starting "PDF statistics", plus two `<BLANKLINE>`'s at the end instead of one.
