Title says it all. MWE:

```
from sage.misc.classcall_metaclass import ClasscallMetaclass
from six import with_metaclass
class foo(with_metaclass(ClasscallMetaclass)):
    pass
```

throws an error

```
TypeError: type.__new__(metaclass) is not safe, use sage.misc.classcall_metaclass.ClasscallMetaclass.__new__()
```

in six.pyc in with_metaclass(meta, *bases). If mixed Python 2 and Python 3 becomes a reality (e.g. #18492), this'll need to be fixed.

Good enough. It's a bit infortunate to have to add a slightly modified version of six to Sage, but we might run into other Cython-specific issues with it and development on six seems to have stopped for the last year or so.
