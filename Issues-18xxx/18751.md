Happy with it. Just one question: If `M` is not ternary, then `M.ternary_matroid()` returns `None`, which appears to be a silent fail. Would an explicit error of some type be a better idea?

If you are not certain if the matroid is ternary, you can test the output of ternary_matroid. This way, you can get the answer and the possible certificate in one fell swoop. If you just want to test, use is_ternary. Similarly, M.isomorphism(N) will also output None if the matroids are not isomorphic and is_isomorphic just performs the test. \n\nTo me, raising errors is what you do when something abnormal occurs. It is not abnormal that a matroid is not ternary.",
