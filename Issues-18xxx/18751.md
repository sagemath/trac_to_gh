If you use `git trac review 18751` it gives you all of them highlighted with nasty red squares. For me at least.

Happy with it. Just one question: If `M` is not ternary, then `M.ternary_matroid()` returns `None`, which appears to be a silent fail. Would an explicit error of some type be a better idea?

Would an explicit error of some type be a better idea?\n\nIt's a matter of preference, I guess. Returning None is not a fail, it's giving information, and the docstring is quite explicit about that. If you are not certain if the matroid is ternary, you can test the output of ternary_matroid. This way, you can get the answer and the possible certificate in one fell swoop. If you just want to test, use is_ternary. Similarly, M.isomorphism(N) will also output None if the matroids are not isomorphic and is_isomorphic just performs the test. \n\nTo me, raising errors is what you do when something abnormal occurs. It is not abnormal that a matroid is not ternary.",

> Happy with it. Just one question: If `M` is not ternary, then `M.ternary_matroid()` returns `None`, which appears to be a silent fail. Would an explicit error of some type be a better idea?

It's a matter of preference, I guess. Returning None is not a fail, it's giving information, and the docstring is quite explicit about that. If you are not certain if the matroid is ternary, you can test the output of ternary_matroid. This way, you can get the answer and the possible certificate in one fell swoop. If you just want to test, use is_ternary. Similarly, M.isomorphism(N) will also output None if the matroids are not isomorphic and is_isomorphic just performs the test. 

To me, raising errors is what you do when something abnormal occurs. It is not abnormal that a matroid is not ternary.
