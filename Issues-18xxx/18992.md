After determinisation, the automaton may have no final state:

```
sage: A = Automaton([(0, 1, []), (1, 1, 0)], initial_states=[0], final_states=[1])
sage: A.transitions()
[Transition from 0 to 1: -|-, Transition from 1 to 1: 0|-]
sage: A.final_states()
[1]
sage: B = A.determinisation().relabeled()
sage: B.initial_states()
[0]
sage: B.final_states()
[]
```
This is because leading epsilon transitions had been ignored.
