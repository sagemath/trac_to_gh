Consider this plot:

```
sage: plot(sin(x^2), (x, -3, 3), axes_labels=['$x$','$y$'])
```

The size of the labels x and y is quite small and barely readable when the figure is reproduced in a article with moderate size (cf. the attached figure).
In the current settings, the only way to enlarge it is via the optional argument fontsize:

```
sage: plot(sin(x^2), (x, -3, 3), axes_labels=['$x$','$y$'], fontsize=20)
```

But then the tick marks are too large! 
One should be able to set separately the size of the axes labels and that of the tick marks.

Hello,

If you set

```
+ self._axes_labels_size = 1.7
```
in the class Graphics, why would you need this `try/except` block

```
+ try:
+     return self._axes_labels_size
+ except AttributeError:
+     self._axes_labels_size = 1.7
+     return self._axes_labels_size
```

Hi Vincent,

You are perfectly right! I am going to change this.
Btw, the same occurs for the attribute `_fontsize` (probably I did a copy-and-paste of the latter...): there is

```
self._fontsize = 10
```
in `Graphics.__init__` and

```
            try:
                return self._fontsize
            except AttributeError:
                self._fontsize = 10
                return self._fontsize
```
in `Graphics.fontsize`. 
Shall we correct it as well, although this does not pertain to the current ticket ?

A systematic search for `AttributeError` in graphics.py reveals that the same issue occurs for the attributes
`_show_axes`, `_axes_color`, `_axes_label_color`, `_axes_width` and `_tick_label_colors`.
So I guess we shall correct these as well?... The only possible justification is that the current implementation is more robust in case of a derived class of `Graphics`, `A` let us say, such that `A.__init__()` does not call `Graphics.__init__()` (but this is bad design IMHO).

OK. 
Btw note that the case of `_axes_width` looks strange: in `Graphics.__init__()`, one has

```
        self._axes_width = 0.8
```
while in `Graphics.axes_width()` there is

```
            try:
                return self._axes_width
            except AttributeError:
                self._axes_width = True
                return self._axes_width
```
Shouldn't it be there `self._axes_width = 0.8` for consistency ? 

Eric.

Hello Eric,

You added two trailing whitespaces! This is very bad.

The problem with the right size is that it depends if the label is in math mode (like `$x$`) or not (like `x`). I would say that:
- 1.4 is a good default for non math mode
- 1.7 is a good default for math mode

I just tried

```
plot(x^2, (x,0,1), axes_labels=('x','$x$'), axes_labels_size=1.7)
```
There is a big difference in the aspects of both letters!

What do people use, `label='x'` or `label='$x$'`?

Vincent

Sorry about this. Yet I've configured my editor to automatically removing trailing whitespaces while saving a file. Apparently two of them went through...

You are right!

Probably it depends, but if you want to have nice labels (in particular labels that coincide with the symbols used in the main text of your article or labels with subscripts or Greek letters), LaTeX seems mandatory. So I would favor the math mode. Maybe lowered to 1.6 as a compromise?...
