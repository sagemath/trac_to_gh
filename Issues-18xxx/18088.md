See [this ask.sagemath question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/26374/evaluation-fail/).  Apparently Ginac says zero to the zero is undefined but most of the rest of Sage (in accordance with IEEE) says it is one:

```
sage: ZZ(0)^ZZ(0)
1
```

but

```
sage: SR(0)^SR(0)
ValueError: power::eval(): pow(0,0) is undefined
```
