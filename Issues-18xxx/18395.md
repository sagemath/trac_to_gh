This branch improves (a bit) the performances of the 'layout_spring' algorithm, i.e. the attraction/repulsion layout for graphs.

I tested it on the `CameronGraph` (big and dense), with the following results:

Before:

```
sage: g = graphs.CameronGraph()
sage: %time _=g.layout_spring(iterations=100000)
CPU times: user 30.8 s, sys: 8 ms, total: 30.8 s
Wall time: 30.8 s
```

After

```
sage: g = graphs.CameronGraph()
sage: %time _=g.layout_spring(iterations=100000)
CPU times: user 14.3 s, sys: 4 ms, total: 14.3 s
Wall time: 14.3 s
```

Honestly, that is mostly a failure. Most of the speedup comes from templating the code so that `dim=2` and `dim=3` are decided at compile-time. Most of the time it spent multiplying floats, and that's what I have been trying to reduce. Not with obvious success `:-/`

Those two almost certainly compile to the same binary:

```
-              for x from 0 <= x < dim:
-                  disp_i[x] += delta[x] * force
-                  disp_j[x] -= delta[x] * force

+                  disp_i[x] += d_tmp
+                  disp_j[x] -= d_tmp
```
You can probably speed it by a few orders of magnitude by not using Euler's method.

I'm using `...` for the output, as for other doctests in the same file for which the patchbot is not complaining, and as explained on [http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#special-markup-to-influence-doctests](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#special-markup-to-influence-doctests). It's not for the code part.

I suspect a conflict with the `# 32-bit` and `# 64-bit` tags.

902 is not the length but the largest index of a vertex (`pos` is a dictionary). 
The graph has 50 vertices. I added a test to check that `pos` has 50 entries.

I set the ticket to positive review as you proposed.
