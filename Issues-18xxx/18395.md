This branch improves (a bit) the performances of the 'layout_spring' algorithm, i.e. the attraction/repulsion layout for graphs.

I tested it on the `CameronGraph` (big and dense), with the following results:

Before:

```
sage: g = graphs.CameronGraph()
sage: %time _=g.layout_spring(iterations=100000)
CPU times: user 30.8 s, sys: 8 ms, total: 30.8 s
Wall time: 30.8 s
```

After

```
sage: g = graphs.CameronGraph()
sage: %time _=g.layout_spring(iterations=100000)
CPU times: user 14.3 s, sys: 4 ms, total: 14.3 s
Wall time: 14.3 s
```

Honestly, that is mostly a failure. Most of the speedup comes from templating the code so that `dim=2` and `dim=3` are decided at compile-time. Most of the time it spent multiplying floats, and that's what I have been trying to reduce. Not with obvious success `:-/`
