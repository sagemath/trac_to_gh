<div id="comment:1" align="right">Comment 1</div>

I believe this description is wrong, as 

`sqrt(x-1)*sqrt(1/x-1/4)`

is **not** equal to (note the `x^2` outside of the square root)

`sqrt(-1/4*x^2 + 5/4*x - 1)/x^2`

but it is equal to

`sqrt((-1/4*x^2 + 5/4*x - 1)/x)`

where `x` is inside the square root (and not the other way around).

According to Mathematica, `sqrt(x-1)*sqrt(1/x-1/4)` integrates to a complicated function that involves elliptic integrals.
