similar to

```
    graphs.some_graph
```
or to

```
    codes.some_code
```
(and similar), I propose to introduce

```
    sequences.some_sequence
```
which should provide a unified access point to all possible sequences in SageMath. For example, there is `fibonacci_sequence` in `sage.combinat.combinat`, `binary_recurring_sequence` (somewhere in combinat) and various other code.

This will use homogenous sequences (#19896), which them-self use lazy lists.

See also the meta-ticket #16107.

Hello Daniel,

Could you define what you mean by **sequence**. Is it sequence of numbers? Rational numbers? Real numbers? An element of an **infinite cartesian power**? Because there also are

```
sage: words.FibonacciWord('ab')
word: abaababaabaababaababaabaababaabaababaaba...
```
which is an infinite sequence of elements in `{a,b}`.

Vincent

What I head in mind is a sequence of numbers (usually intergers, rationals, maybe reals). But of course words are very much related to it. So any ideas/suggestions are very welcome.

I am happy to make it as general as needed.

Like: Finite and infinite sequences where the elements can be any sage objects (but all of the same type/parent)?

* provide an interface for playing with sequences.  My favorite ticket attempting this is #16137, together with #16107.  This is for sequences indexed by natural numbers, although possibly finite.  If I recall correctly, a generalization might be provided by `Family`.

* provide a catalogue of named ("famous") sequences.  I believe that #16137 should be general enough to be able to deal with just about any sequence.  Is there any need to restrict to a certain type of sequence?

If the scope of this ticket is the second item, there is no conflict.  However, a backend would need to be chosen...
