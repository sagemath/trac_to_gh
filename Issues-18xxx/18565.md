CC:  @mantepse

similar to

```
    graphs.some_graph
```
or to

```
    codes.some_code
```
(and similar), I propose to introduce

```
    sequences.some_sequence
```
which should provide a unified access point to all possible sequences in SageMath. For example, there is `fibonacci_sequence` in `sage.combinat.combinat`, `binary_recurring_sequence` (somewhere in combinat) and various other code.

This will use homogenous sequences (#19896), which them-self use lazy lists.

See also the meta-ticket #16107.

Hello Daniel,

Could you define what you mean by **sequence**. Is it sequence of numbers? Rational numbers? Real numbers? An element of an **infinite cartesian power**? Because there also are

```
sage: words.FibonacciWord('ab')
word: abaababaabaababaababaabaababaabaababaaba...
```
which is an infinite sequence of elements in `{a,b}`.

Vincent

What I head in mind is a sequence of numbers (usually intergers, rationals, maybe reals). But of course words are very much related to it. So any ideas/suggestions are very welcome.

Then you are more restrictive than [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence) in which a sequence is even allowed to be finite. I do not have suggestion beyond *having precise specifications*. You can perhaps even be explicit in the names by using `number_sequences.*` or `sequences.numbers.*`?

I am happy to make it as general as needed.

Like: Finite and infinite sequences where the elements can be any sage objects (but all of the same type/parent)?

Best,

Daniel

Ok. Do you think here of a parametrisation (parameter `ZZ` for integer sequences; like the base for some parent)? I ask, because maybe someone wants to have a sequence of rationals (e.g. Bernoulli numbers) or polynomials (again e.g. Bernoulli). This would then be similar to words with an infinite alphabet...

Let me try to summarize the two apparently orthogonal issues here:

* provide an interface for playing with sequences.  My favorite ticket attempting this is #16137, together with #16107.  This is for sequences indexed by natural numbers, although possibly finite.  If I recall correctly, a generalization might be provided by `Family`.

* provide a catalogue of named ("famous") sequences.  I believe that #16137 should be general enough to be able to deal with just about any sequence.  Is there any need to restrict to a certain type of sequence?

If the scope of this ticket is the second item, there is no conflict.  However, a backend would need to be chosen...
