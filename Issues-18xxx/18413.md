`BlumGoldwasser` doesn't properly inherit from its superclass, `PublicKeyCryptosystem`. 

First, initialization is incomplete. The superclass of `PublicKeyCryptosystem` is `Cryptosystem`, whose initialization requires the arguments: `plaintext_space`, `ciphertext_space`, `key_space`, `block_length`, and `period`. These are not being supplied. 

As a result, calls to the methods `plaintext_space()`, `cipher_domain()`, `ciphertext_space()`, `cipher_codomain()`, `key_space()`, `block_length()`, and `period()` fail. For example: 

```
  sage: from sage.crypto.public_key.blum_goldwasser import BlumGoldwasser
  sage: bs = BlumGoldwasser()
  sage: bs.key_space()
  AttributeError: 'BlumGoldwasser' object has no attribute '_key_space'
```

The easiest solution would be to stop inheriting from `PublicKeyCryptosystem`.

Perhaps a naive question... is there anything else that *uses* `PublicKeyCryptosystem`?

`BlumGoldwasser` is actually the only module which uses `PublicKeyCryptosystem`. So it might be worth removing `PublicKeyCryptosystem` altogether. `PublicKeyCryptosystem` is defined on line 375 of `crypto/cryptosystem.py`.
