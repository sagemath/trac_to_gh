The current code for computing twists of newforms by Dirichlet characters is unnecessarily slow, because it computes a full decomposition of the target space into simple Hecke modules, and then throws all but one of the factors away. It is quicker just to directly pull out the appropriate factor using kernels of Hecke matrices. 

Depends on #18478

Here's a patch. I tested it doing
` sage: Newforms(11)[0].twist(DirichletGroup(5).0) `
and it went down from about 30 sec to about 3 sec on my machine. The doctest requires #18478 to pass.

One of the doctests still fails, this time because the effect of setting `check=False` is changed:

```
File "src/sage/modular/modform/element.py", line 1192, in sage.modular.modform.element.Newform.twist
Failed example:
    Delta.twist(chi, level=3, check=False)  # long time
Exception raised:
    ...
    RuntimeError: twist of q - 24*q^2 + 252*q^3 - 1472*q^4 + 4830*q^5 + O(q^6) by Dirichlet character modulo 1 of conductor 1 is not a newform in Cuspidal subspace of dimension 3 of Modular Forms space of dimension 5 for Congruence Subgroup Gamma0(3) of weight 12 over Cyclotomic Field of order 1 and degree 1
```
We should either just remove this doctest, or find a new example to document that `check=False` can lead to wrong results.

Here's a new version. I've made a subtle change which ensures that the code cannot return bogus results (even if `check=False`); it now either returns a correct answer, or fails with a `ValueError` if the form is not new at the specified level. The change is that the code starts by taking the new subspace of the modular symbols (which is pretty cheap to compute) and only then starts filtering down to kernels of Hecke operators.

I've also changed the error messages a bit so it returns a different error if the computed mod sym space is 0 than if it's too large (the latter could, theoretically, happen in valid examples if the level was gigantic, whereas the former can only occur if the input is bogus so it makes sense to return `ValueError`).
