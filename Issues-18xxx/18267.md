As remarked in [this question on ask.sagemath.org](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/26590/add-generator-to-a-group-combine-generators-of-two-groups/) a lot of time is spent with pexpect when playing with permutation groups.

In this ticket:
- we interface libgap permutation group so that the following works

```
sage: p1=libgap.eval("(1,2,3)")
sage: p2=libgap.eval("(3,4,5)")
sage: p1.sage()
(1,2,3)
sage: G=libgap.Group([p1,p2])
sage: G.sage()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NotImplementedError: cannot construct equivalent Sage object
```
- we check that interesting GAP functions such as `ClosureGroup`, `AllBlocks`, are available from libgap
- we use them in `PermutationGroup` inplace of the current gap version

The overhead of using pexpect for GAP is *especially* serious on Cygwin.  I believe it to be one of the worst performance hits there, due to the I/O overhead.

It's so slow in fact that I wonder if there isn't a bug/defect in Cygwin related to this.  It's normal that there is some additional overhead involved for I/O on Cygwin, but this is especially bad.

I have a prototype for this in progress that is shaping up pretty well so far.  I will likely need help with this part:

> we check that interesting GAP functions such as `ClosureGroup`, `AllBlocks`, are available from libgap


as I don't know all the math well enough to write interesting tests for this.  But I can get most of the skunkworks done and then anyone else who's interested can add on to it.

Some of the tests also intentionally use the pexpect interface directly, so nothing to do about that for now.

Here is my current prototype for getting pexpect out of permutation groups, and having them use libgap exclusively.  For the large part it is quite effective at this.  This fixes (among many other examples):

```
sage: G = SymmetricGroup(3)
sage: %prun G.one()
sage: G.one()
()
sage: gap._expect is None
```

where previously this was invoking a GAP process through pexpect.

The one bug I mentioned in comment:14 is now tracked at #28106 and is not directly caused by the changes I made here; rather it only exhibited due to the fact that using libgap in more places meant slightly more virtual memory was being allocated in some tests than previously, but this is expected.

So if you run into the bug with `MemoryError`s in `sage.combinat.tableau` you can pass the test runner `--memlimit=4000` or something like that.

Somehow it seems this has caused a regression of something that was supposed to be fixed by #10296.  The problems start here:

```
        The following tests against a bug fixed at :trac:`10296`::

            sage: gap(3)
            3
            sage: gap.eval('quit;')
            ''
            sage: a = gap(3)
            ** Gap crashed or quit executing '\$sage...:=3;;' **
            Restarting Gap and trying again
            sage: a
            3
```

Instead of gap crashing normally and restarting, we get this error instead:

```

```

after which point the gap interface never recovers.  It's only happening in the tests though.  I can't reproduce interactively.  Running the tests with `--serial` makes no difference.

Rebased on current develop, and the latest commit fixes the immediate problem in the test suite.

I believe there is still an underlying problem with libgap/gap interaction which is not yet addressed though (and is probably not new as of this ticket, but just more likely to occur with libgap being used more extensively).
