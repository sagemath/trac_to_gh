As remarked in [this question on ask.sagemath.org](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/26590/add-generator-to-a-group-combine-generators-of-two-groups/) a lot of time is spent with pexpect when playing with permutation groups.

In this ticket:
- we interface libgap permutation group so that the following works

```
sage: p1=libgap.eval("(1,2,3)")
sage: p2=libgap.eval("(3,4,5)")
sage: p1.sage()
(1,2,3)
sage: G=libgap.Group([p1,p2])
sage: G.sage()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NotImplementedError: cannot construct equivalent Sage object
```
- we check that interesting GAP functions such as `ClosureGroup`, `AllBlocks`, are available from libgap
- we use them in `PermutationGroup` inplace of the current gap version

The overhead of using pexpect for GAP is *especially* serious on Cygwin.  I believe it to be one of the worst performance hits there, due to the I/O overhead.

It's so slow in fact that I wonder if there isn't a bug/defect in Cygwin related to this.  It's normal that there is some additional overhead involved for I/O on Cygwin, but this is especially bad.

as I don't know all the math well enough to write interesting tests for this.  But I can get most of the skunkworks done and then anyone else who's interested can add on to it.

The I/O overhead on Cygwin adds up to something on the order of 20x in this test (specially, the `_test_cellular` test).  I tracked this down to being entirely coming from the pexpect communication.  On Linux:

```
sage -t --long src/sage/combinat/symmetric_group_algebra.py
    [422 tests, 30.17 s]
```

On Cygwin (different machine, but with reasonably good specs):

```
sage -t --long src/sage/combinat/symmetric_group_algebra.py
    [422 tests, 613.16 s]
```

More than 10 minutes on this one test!  It's by far one of the slowest tests on Cygwin.  With my prototype of getting pexpect out of permutation groups I knocked this result down to (again on Cygwin):

```
sage -t --long src/sage/combinat/symmetric_group_algebra.py

Well I found one more pexpect use in permgroup_named; fixing that one knocked it down from ~5 minutes to

```
sage -t --long src/sage/groups/perm_gps/permgroup_named.py
    [509 tests, 47.12 s]
```

Which is still about 5 times slower for some reason than that test is on Linux, but progress!

Some of the tests also intentionally use the pexpect interface directly, so nothing to do about that for now.

Here is my current prototype for getting pexpect out of permutation groups, and having them use libgap exclusively.  For the large part it is quite effective at this.  This fixes (among many other examples):

```
sage: G = SymmetricGroup(3)
sage: %prun G.one()
sage: G.one()
()
sage: gap._expect is None
```

where previously this was invoking a GAP process through pexpect.

All tests now pass for me on this ticket (have not tried optional packages).

The one bug I mentioned in[comment:14](#comment%3A14) is now tracked at #28106 and is not directly caused by the changes I made here; rather it only exhibited due to the fact that using libgap in more places meant slightly more virtual memory was being allocated in some tests than previously, but this is expected.

So if you run into the bug with `MemoryError`s in `sage.combinat.tableau` you can pass the test runner `--memlimit=4000` or something like that.

Somehow it seems this has caused a regression of something that was supposed to be fixed by #10296.  The problems start here:

```
        The following tests against a bug fixed at :trac:`10296`::

            sage: gap(3)
            3
            sage: gap.eval('quit;')
            ''
            sage: a = gap(3)
            ** Gap crashed or quit executing '\$sage...:=3;;' **
            Restarting Gap and trying again
            sage: a
            3
```

Instead of gap crashing normally and restarting, we get this error instead:

```
Exception raised:

    ExceptionPexpect: isalive() encountered condition where "terminated" is 0, but there was no child process. Did someone else call waitpid() on our process?
```

after which point the gap interface never recovers.  It's only happening in the tests though.  I can't reproduce interactively.  Running the tests with `--serial` makes no difference.

Rebased on current develop, and the latest commit fixes the immediate problem in the test suite.

I believe there is still an underlying problem with libgap/gap interaction which is not yet addressed though (and is probably not new as of this ticket, but just more likely to occur with libgap being used more extensively).

Bizarrely, even after backing out that last test update, and rebuilding, I can't reproduce the issue anymore either.  I think it might have actually had something to do with sage-cleaner.

Please send this to the buildbots again.  I really don't think the issue is caused by this ticket, but is something more ephemeral that it happens to provoke somehow.

Yes, this has got to have something to do with `sage-cleaner`.  If I just start a `sage-cleaner` process on its own, then run `./sage -t src/sage/interfaces/gap.py` I can reproduce the issue reliably.

Soft dependency on #28354: Although I don't think the issues are particularly related, if those pexpect exceptions about `isalive()` keep happening, merging #28354 first should alleviate them.
