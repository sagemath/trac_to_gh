The current Sage optional package lrs refers to the version 4.2b released on 2006.2.14. A few bugs have been reported and fixed since then. In particular, I encountered a bug when calling the `redund` function provided by lrs-4.2b.p1.spkg to an H-representation input file which contains redundant linearities. 
The latest version lrslib-051.tar.gz available at http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~avis/C/lrs.html solves the problem and is much faster.

As a first step, I have imported the old-style spkg lrs-4.2b.p1

I called the new-style spkg "lrslib" -- that's the current name of the upstream packages.

Hellooooooo,

- You cannot 'just rename' the package: there are many doctests flagged with
  "optional - lrs" (which are only tested if 'lrs' is installed), and if you
  rename the package but not those doctests then they will not be tested as they
  should. You will find them in three files:

  ```
  game_theory/normal_form_game.py
  game_theory/parser.py
  geometry/polyhedron/base.py
  ```

- A ticket that updates a package must contain a direct url toward the archive
  that is to be added (for the release manager who will have to merge the
  ticket)

- Do you know what are the differences between lrs and lrslib (if any)? It seems
  that the author's website still lists 'lrs' as something different from
  'lrslib'.

- You can drop the "Changelog" section of SPKG.txt. That's because we now have
  the history in the main git tree.

Nathann

Thanks, Nathann, for your helpful comments. 

As far as I know, lrs has, since version 4.0 (2000), only been released in the form of lrslib. Since that version, the upstream tarball has always been called lrslib-VERSION.tar.gz, where 4.0 is rendered as 040 and 4.2b as 042b etc.
See https://web.archive.org/web/20140506162045/http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~avis/C/lrslib/archive/
The website is indeed a bit unclear.

I'll update the doctests and remove the changelog.

Turns out that lrslib-042b.tar.gz was retroactively changed in 2009. The 2009 version fails Sage's doctests.
The version available at https://web.archive.org/web/20080606032009/http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~avis/C/lrslib/lrslib-042b.tar.gz (time stamp 30-Oct-2006) is better and is identical to the version used by the old spkg.
This passes the doctests.

Update: lrslib-043.tar.gz has the same doctest failures.

My experience is that a simple hand-written makefile for building libraries is not portable. It might work on one particular operating system, but almost certainly not an all.

So I think you should use autotools (autoconf + automake + libtool) to build the package (or make the package "experimental" such that it's explicit that it might not work).

Helloooooooooo,

Instead of a full copy of the files, the patches/ folder usually contains... patches. Could you only keep .patch files in there?

I will send an email to the author in a second about an autotools versions.

Hello !

The package was installed correctly with this new branch, but several doctests were breaking. There are leftovet 'lrs' in the code, which you probably do not see if you have installed the former version of the 'lrs' spkg on your computer. I fixed them in a commit at `public/18127`.

With this commit, the branch is (in my opinion) ready to go.

For those who are not in Cc of the mail exchange with the package's author: he told us that his makefile was custom-made to work with polymake, and that it had been tested on "several OS/architecture without problem". The changes we make to their makefile are very simple:
- change harcoded paths to include SAGE_ROOT
- replace 'install' by 'cp'

About autotool: they see no point in doing it themselves, but they would not mind such a contribution.

As this package has been optional for a long while now, I believe that we can keep it as it is for the moment, and autotoolize it later if we need it.

What about you, Jeroen?

Nathann

P.S.: The 'download' link on the author's website is now fixed
P.S2: One of the authors 'would not mind' an autotoolized build system, while the other would prefer to update his makefile if that's possible, whenever we meet a problem on some architecture.

There are still some references to a `lrs` package in `src/sage/game_theory/normal_form_game.py`:

```
* ``'lrs'``: Reverse search vertex enumeration for 2 player games. This
  algorithm uses the optional 'lrs' package. To install it type ``sage -i
  lrslib`` at the command line. For more information see [A2000]_.
```

```
Note that if no algorithm argument is passed then the default will be
selected according to the following order (if the corresponding package is
installed):

    1. ``'lrs'`` (requires 'lrs')
```

```
        if not algorithm:
            if is_package_installed('lrs'):
                algorithm = "lrs"
            else:
                algorithm = "enumeration"

        if algorithm == "lrs":
            if not is_package_installed('lrs'):
