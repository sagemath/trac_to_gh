Sage is slightly inconsistent when it comes to detect multiple edges in
`Graph(list_of_edges)`:

```
sage: Graph([[1,2],[1,2]])
Multi-graph on 2 vertices
sage: Graph([[1,2],[2,1]])
Graph on 2 vertices
```

This branch fixes that bug while removing code from `Graph.__init__` and
`DiGraph.__init__`, which now relies `GenericGraph.add_edges`. More precisely:

- Make Sage build a (di)graph from a list of edges with the following procedure:
    - Create an empty graph allowing loops and multiple edges
    - Call `self.add_edges(list_of_edges)`
    - Check whether multiedges/loops have been created, and display the
      pre-existing warnings accordingly.
    - Update the `allow_loops` and `allow_multiple_edges` parameters
      accordingly.

- When Sage does not know how to create a graph from the provided data, it
  currently gives it to NetworkX hoping that it will work, then convert the
  result into a Sage graph. With this branch, we now raise an exception instead.

- As a consequence it is not possible to create a graph from a Numpy matrix
  anymore, though that can be done easily through `Graph(Matrix(my_matrix))` so
  it is not that bad either (in particular, copying the matrix is not more
  expensive than creating a NetworkX graph)

  Furthermore, the graphs created from a Numpy matrix inherited the 'weird'
  NetworkX standards:

```
sage: import numpy
sage: A = numpy.array([[0,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,0]])
sage: Graph(A).edges()
[(0, 1, {0: {'weight': 1}, 1: {'weight': 1}}),
(0, 2, {0: {'weight': 1}, 1: {'weight': 1}}),
(1, 2, {0: {'weight': 1}, 1: {'weight': 1}})]
```

- Several corner-cases of Graph creation are now handled differently as a
  result. I merely removed the doctests, thinking that they were not actually
  testing a property that we want to keep, e.g.:

  Before:

```
sage: g = Graph([(1,2,3),(1,2,4)], multiedges = False)
...
ValueError: Two different labels given for the same edge in a graph without multiple edges.
```

  After:

```
sage: g = Graph([(1,2,3),(1,2,4)], multiedges = False)
sage: g.edges()
[(1, 2, 4)]
```

  Note that it actually makes `Graph(list_of_edges)` behave as `add_edges`
  already does, as in the latest release we have:

```
sage: g = Graph()
sage: g.add_edges([(1,2,3),(1,2,4)])
sage: g.edges()
[(1, 2, 4)]
```

- Fix a bug in `GenericGraph.has_multiple_edges`:

```
sage: g = Graph(loops=True,multiedges=True)
sage: g.add_edge(0,0)
sage: g.has_multiple_edges()
True
```

What this branch does will also help us reduce further the complexity of those
(awful) `__init__` functions.

<a id='comment:1'></a>Hello !

I was actually thinking of this very behaviour last week, as many things in the (di)Graph constructors should be rewritten. A lot of time is also wasted because we have to detect what the user 'intends' to build, and at some point I thought that this could be solved by asking the user to tell us explicitly whether (s)he wants a simple graph or a multigraph, using the `multiedges=True` flag. Nowadays, I am not so sure anymore.

In this specific case, I also believe that, as you advise, we should return a multigraph. But to understand better what it works this way, see how it works for dictionary input (note that 'list of edges' input is converted into dictionary input):

```
sage: Graph({1:[2],2:[1]}).edges()
[(1, 2, None)]
```

What do you think the user wants in this case ? Is (s)he giving us a multigraph, or merely giving the adjacencies between the vertices in both directions?

Right now, giving the adjacencies in both direction or giving them only once yields the same result

```
sage: Graph({1:[2],2:[1]}) == Graph({1:[2]})
True
```

And of course, saying twice that 2 is a neighbor of 1 yields a multigraph

```
sage: Graph({1:[2,2]})
Multi-graph on 2 vertices
```

I will fix this bug soon, by making `Graph(list_of_edges)` call `add_edge` immediately. The code will also be shorter. But the graph constructors will have to be rewritten, and standards will change. We cannot guess the user's intent without guessing wrong at times, and we want to avoid that.

Don't worry, I will write some code for that very soon. I am about to leave to Liege (Belgium) for some Sage days so I will not be able to do it this week-end most probably (I'll be backpacking) but it will definitely be done during the week.

I would also like to turn this huge `__init__` into independent functions, but that is not totally straightforward either. I do want to make it shorter, though.

I agree with you. But I already wrote something to make those argument mandatory, and noticed that it broke doctests.. Because a complete graph stored as a multigraph is not (for Sage) equal to a complete graph (stored as a simple graph) and other problems like that.

Well. 1) I will fix this in the next days and 2) I am aware that this code has to be changed, and I will do something about it. Especially since David Coudert would like to be able to load huge graphs in Sage, and that it is currently impossible.

Ahahaha. Well, I also agree with you on that point, but I cannot get code in Sage by myself. I know that I only fixed a small part of the problem in this ticket, but doing too many things at once makes it impossible to find a reviewer. Soooooo while I already know what the next ticket will be about, I thought that it was better to write a smaller patch first. Then the other will come.

I do not believe in adding doctests to explain that our code is bad. Let us change the code.
