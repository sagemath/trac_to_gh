`tides` has this in upstream's `Makefile.am`:

```
AM_CPPFLAGS = -I/usr/local/include
```
This should be fixed since it may include unwanted stuff from `/usr/local/include`.

<a id='comment:6'></a>None of the above :-)

I'm using

```
$MAKE AM_CPPFLAGS="-I '$SAGE_LOCAL/include'"
```

Just look at the `make` logs, the output is correct.
