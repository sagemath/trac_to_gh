Constructing a `Partition` (or more generally, a `CombinatorialObject`) from a list does not copy this list, leading to:

```
sage: L = IntegerListsLex(max_slope=-1, element_class=Partition)
sage: x = [3,2,1]
sage: P = L(x)
sage: x[0] = 5
sage: list(P)
[5, 2, 1]
```

In the `IntegerListsLex` implementation in #17979, a work-around was added for this. Instead, fix this by copying the input.

CombinatorialObject provides a thin wrapper around a list
```

Next to everything I work with is a combinatorial object, and very few of them are lists.
