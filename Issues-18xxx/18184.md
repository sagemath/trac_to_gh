Constructing a `Partition` (or more generally, a `CombinatorialObject`) from a list does not copy this list, leading to:

```
sage: L = IntegerListsLex(max_slope=-1, element_class=Partition)
sage: x = [3,2,1]
sage: P = L(x)
sage: x[0] = 5
sage: list(P)
[5, 2, 1]
```

In the `IntegerListsLex` implementation in #17979, a work-around was added for this. Instead, fix this by copying the input.

What about a keyword `copy` in the constructor (which would be `True` by default)? You can save a lot of time by not copying the list. This is what we did in `sage.combinat.designs.incidence_structures.IncidenceStructure`.

Maybe someday we should do something about the name, by the way.

CombinatorialObject provides a thin wrapper around a list
```

Next to everything I work with is a combinatorial object, and very few of them are lists.
