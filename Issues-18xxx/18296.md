A post on sage-support [1] reported that the `subgraph_search` functions ignored edge labels, while the doc apparently claims the opposite.

Indeed, the common terminology of "labelled copies" and "unlabelled copies" is pretty misleading with respect to actual labels on the edge/vertices of the graph. With this branch, I hope to make this mistake less likely.
