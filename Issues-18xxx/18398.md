Currently branching rules for IntegrableRepresentations of untwisted affine Lie algebras are implemented. But the process requires the user to create a dictionary between the nodes of two Dynkin diagrams, a process that can be automated.

Depends on #18767

This patch contains a lot of case-by-case encoding of work that can also be done by hand by the user when the user needs the branching rules (explained in the reference manual). It saves the reader having to line up the Dynkin diagrams.

So although it is convenient not to have to do this, the reader who needs a branching rule can do so without this patch. This patch is therefore less important than #18767 which adds real new functionality. After #18767 this patch should be generalized to include the twisted types. So I think it is better if #18767 (which adds real new functionality) is merged first. After that, this patch should be extended to include the twisted cases.

> In #15463, I go part of the way there by implementing a subtype method, but I think we should take that idea and expand on it here, and then use subtype to do the branching rule here. 


Following a suggestion of Volker Braun, branching rules for finite dimensional Lie algebras were implemented in the categorical framework in the Weyl character ring. 

```
sage: R1=branching_rule("E7","A7","extended")
sage: type(R1)
<class 'sage.combinat.root_system.branching_rules.BranchingRule'>
sage: R2=branching_rule("A7","A3xA3","levi")
sage: R1*R2
composite branching rule E7 => (extended) A7 => (levi) A3xA3
```

One could try to extend this to the affine case but here we are only dealing with Levi branching rules. (The Levi subalgebras are finite-dimensional.) This is less ambitious but still useful.

We could probably benefit from using the `subtype` method in #17798 (and could potentially need improvements) so it requires less hard-coded branching rules.
