I tried to use interactive_simplex_method in SageMathCloud, and it seems the current model of `InteractiveLPProblemStandardForm.run_simplex_method` and `LPDictionary.ELLUL` to return a string of LaTeX code is not a good fit. (See screenshot.)

I propose to change these methods so they just call `pretty_print` repeatedly and return nothing. An optional keyword argument, show=False, would turn off output. This is used when, for example, `run_simplex_method` is called by `final_dictionary`.

Please don't make rush changes here - it was a lot of pain to make things work in SageNB and SageTeX. The name also may not be fitting if it was just printing something.

Note that it does not return just a string - it returns a `LatexExpr` which should be typeset by frontends automatically.

Although there are problems because of the long LaTeX code - I had to increase limits on the size of expressions handled by SMC. So there may be some sense in showing steps as separate formulas in `run_simplex_method` to ease the load on MathJax, but `ELLUL` works exactly as it should - if SMC can't deal with it, SMC has to be tuned.

I guess showing the steps as separate formulas would also allow to show a plot after each update step (if the user requests that), showing the current basic solution...

Once we have html blocks implemented, `run_simplex_method` should return `HTMLFragment` which will be the current string:
- it should display nicely when rendered as HTML
- formulas will be in math mode automatically and will be rendered one-by-one, helping to avoid problems with too long input for MathJax
- the same string should work as LaTeX code as well

`ELLUL` on the other hand still should return `LatexExpr` since it constructs a single formula.

Without using the logging facility, one could simply pass a callback function to a productive function such as run_simplex_method that is called when there is something to be output.
