I tried to use interactive_simplex_method in SageMathCloud, and it seems the current model of `InteractiveLPProblemStandardForm.run_simplex_method` and `LPDictionary.ELLUL` to return a string of LaTeX code is not a good fit. (See screenshot.)

I propose to change these methods so they just call `pretty_print` repeatedly and return nothing. An optional keyword argument, show=False, would turn off output. This is used when, for example, `run_simplex_method` is called by `final_dictionary`.

Although there are problems because of the long LaTeX code - I had to increase limits on the size of expressions handled by SMC.

I guess showing the steps as separate formulas would also allow to show a plot after each update step (if the user requests that), showing the current basic solution...

<a id='comment:6'></a>Once we have html blocks implemented, `run_simplex_method` should return `HTMLFragment` which will be the current string:
- it should display nicely when rendered as HTML
- formulas will be in math mode automatically and will be rendered one-by-one, helping to avoid problems with too long input for MathJax
- the same string should work as LaTeX code as well

`ELLUL` on the other hand still should return `LatexExpr` since it constructs a single formula.
