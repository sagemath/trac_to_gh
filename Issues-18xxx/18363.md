Keywords: polynomial

Keyboard interrupt is not possible in the following example:

```python
sage: R.<x> = Zmod(5)[]
sage: p = R.random_element(2^16)
sage: p.is_irreducible
^C^C^C^C...
```

Now we have:

```python
sage: R.<x> = Zmod(5)[]
sage: p = R.random_element(2^16)
sage: p.is_irreducible()
^C
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
KeyboardInterrupt:
```
