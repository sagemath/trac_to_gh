This is the first Symbench test. Sage around 4.3 took 0.3s (see http://wiki.sagemath.org/symbench#Problem_R1) but Sage-6.8rc0 needs 10 minutes:

```
sage: def f(z): return sqrt(1/3)*z^2 + i/3
sage: real(f(f(f(f(f(f(f(f(f(f(i/2)))))))))))
```
while

```
sage: %timeit real(f(f(f(f(f(f(f(f(f(f(i/2)))))))))).expand())
10 loops, best of 3: 23.5 ms per loop
```
A simplified version of this is:

```
sage: real((((((((((sqrt(3)+I)^2+1)^2+1)^2+1)^2+1)^2+1)^2+1)^2+1)^2+1)^2+1)^2
```

Profiling with callgrind reveals remarkable things, even with only 6 f's. Although Pynac accounts for less than 1 per cent of the time, a whopping 150,000 of numerics are created;  88,000 calls to `ex::is_zero`; 50,000 to `Integer(long)`. The 3,400 calls of `atan2` show that the formula `power(abs(basis),c)*exp(-d*atan2(b,a))*cos(c*atan2(b,a)+d*log(abs(basis)))` is used to compute `real((1/3)^(1/2))` over and over.

The simplest solution would be to expand before taking the real part in Pynac.

However, there is probably more in this use case regarding performance improvement.

Ralf,

With #18980 the problem seems to disappear. Should we close it as a duplicate?
