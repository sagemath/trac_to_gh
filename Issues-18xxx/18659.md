The attached patch is part of the enabling of Sage for Py2/3.
Py2 integer division `/` is changed to P2/3 floor division `//` (see #15995).
This ticket is similar to #16371 which already performed such changes.

I feel that this ticket does too much at once. Most changes are non-trivial and require some work to review. It's too much for me anyway.

I think only the changes in

*1 algebras/steenrod/steenrod_algebra_bases.py
*2 graphs/generic_graph.py
*3 modular/arithgroup/arithgroup_perm.py

really need to be checked seriously. All others are very simple.

For *1, there is a sentence that explain that all dimensions are divided by the given factor. Being dimensions, they surely must be integers.

For *2, the end result must be an integer (Wiener index), and we are simply dividing an even integer by 2.

For *3, it seems to be about cusp widths, that are in principle integers, as far as I understand.
