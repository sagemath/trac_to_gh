We skip 0.3.3 (#18155) which couldn't be used because of a bug showing on OSX.

```
* fixed the series expansion of zeta(s) around 1
* print_latex of wildcards
* clear the libtool versioning scheme
* sync with current GiNaC as much as possible
* revert GiNaC commit interfering with Pynac print order
* fix code that produced warnings
```
Upgrade will require a few doctests to adapt, see https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-devel/hwQXxFmutcU/discussion

`MAKE="make -j4" make ptestlong` gives

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage -t --long --warn-long 81.8 src/sage/combinat/dyck_word.py  # 1 doctest failed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

The doctest fails with

```
sage -t --long --warn-long 81.8 src/sage/combinat/dyck_word.py
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/combinat/dyck_word.py", line 3501, in sage.combinat.dyck_word.DyckWords_size.__init__

1 item had failures:
   1 of   2 in sage.combinat.dyck_word.DyckWords_size.__init__
    [574 tests, 1 failure, 2.98 s]
```

This happened two times. However, when testing the respective file manually:

```
sage -t --long --warn-long 81.8 src/sage/combinat/dyck_word.py
    [574 tests, 0.95 s]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

So this only seems to occur for `make ptestlong`. 

Additionally, as I've not run `make ptestlong` on a clean install of `6.7.beta1` yet, I'm not even sure if this is related to Pynac at all. I'll do so and report back...

I'm also quite sure that it has nothing to do with this ticket; especially after Vincent confirmed that this is happening for him too on both `6.7.beta0` and `6.7.beta1`. This discussion, however, belongs to the `sage-devel` thread.

Still, I don't like the idea of giving this `positive_review` when I don't have a passing `ptestlong`, regardless of why the doctest is failing. Currently, I'm compiling sage on two more machines; one of those should enable me to review this.
