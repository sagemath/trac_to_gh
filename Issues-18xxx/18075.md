<a id='comment:12'></a>Review branch uploaded.

A few remarks:

I am not 100% sure whether the letter ℓ goes against coding standards, but I have replaced it by a regular l to be safe. The docstrings are sent to latex, and I think latex doesn't like things that aren't ascii.

Also removed all the trailing whitespace.

The error in the iterator I pointed out should either be fixed here or moved to another ticket. Other than this, the ticket is good to go if you think the review changes are fine!
