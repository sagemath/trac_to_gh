Hello!
I have implemented the computation of the local clustering coefficient through Boost. The improvement is not as striking as the edge connectivity, but it is still a 10x improvement, more or less. Some benchmarks:

```
sage: g = graphs.RandomGNM(20000,100000)
sage: %timeit g.clustering_coeff(implementation='boost')
10 loops, best of 3: 258 ms per loop
sage: %timeit g.clustering_coeff(implementation='networkx')
1 loops, best of 3: 3.99 s per loop
```

```
sage: g = graphs.CompleteGraph(300)
sage: %timeit g.clustering_coeff(implementation='boost')
1 loops, best of 3: 6.14 s per loop
sage: %timeit g.clustering_coeff(implementation='networkx')
1 loops, best of 3: 1min 3s per loop
```

```
sage: g = graphs.RandomGNM(10000,1000000)
sage: %timeit g.clustering_coeff(implementation='networkx',nodes=range(30))
1 loops, best of 3: 13.1 s per loop
sage: %timeit g.clustering_coeff(implementation='boost',nodes=range(30))
1 loops, best of 3: 1.55 s per loop
```
I hope you like it!

Hellooooooo Michele,

- About `boost_clustering_coeff` -- to me it makes more sense if this function,
  meant to apply to a boost graph, does not take a Sage graph as input. You only
  need it to get the vertices' correct label, but you only need this at a higher
  level. Returning a dictionary associating the coeffcient to each (integer)
  vertex is not very expensive considering the computations you do, and so you
  can afford to relabel it higher.

- Could you define "local clustering" somewhere? Is it any different from the
  'clustering coefficient of a vertex'?

- Could you add an INPUT block to `cpdef clustering_coeff`?

- Same function -- by using a `sig_check` instead of `sig_on/off` it is
  impossible to interrupt the function while `boost_resulting_coeff` is
  running. It will only be interrupted when the function returns.

- Could you rename 'cc' to 'average_clustering_coefficient'? When you need a
  comment to say what a variable is, it often means that you should rename the
  variable.

- in `clustering_average` -- could you document the default behaviour of
  `implementation=None`? (you did it in `clustering_coeff` already).

- You should not indent the *text* after a 'TESTS:' block (like it is done for
  'INPUT:'). Usually, you only need to indent text in the documentation after a
  '::'.

- Instead of `weight==False`, it is better to use 'not weight'. Handles better
  something like `weight=0` (faster to type `:-P`)

Looks very good!

Thanks,

Nathann

Hello,

I have not checked the code yet.

Nathann, I have an old code using bitsets for speeding up intersection of neighborhoods. I can update it using static dense graph and see if it is a good competitor ;)
The idea is to compute the number of triangles incident to each edge, and then to compute the number of triangles incident to a given vertex.

David.

Oops, I wrote it like this to test if it worked, and I forgot to change it. By solving this issue, I also have found problems if the vertex label is not an integer, I corrected it, and I added a doctest.

It is exactly the same (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clustering_coefficient#Local_clustering_coefficient): I decided to remove "local" from all comments.

>

Done!

Done! Now I use sig_on/off.

Done!

Done

Sage does have something like that, too. It would only require minor changes to what was added in #18250.

Hello Michele,

Thanks for your updates. I added a commit at public/18811, and if you agree with it then you can add it to the branch and this ticket can go.

Here are the modifications I made:
- remove trailing whitespaces
- The function `boost_clustering_coeff` claimed to accept 'None' as a list of vertices, but did not
- `len(clust_of_v.values())` is equal to `len(clust_of_v)`
- `{g.vertices()[v]: clust_v_int[v] for v in vertices_boost`} this line calls `g.vertices()` for each `[v]`.
- You can use 'tolerance' for tests like `sage: abs(G.clustering_average(implementation='boost') - G.clustering_average(implementation='networkx')) < 1E-12`

Have fuuuuuuuuun,

Nathann

Sorry, I didn't realize you modified the code... That's why I modified the doc, I thought you forgot a commit, or something like that. In my opinion, it is better to modify the doc, for simplicity!

BTW, how can I use 'tolerance' in the other test?

```
sage: G = graphs.RandomGNM(10,20)
sage: clust_boost = G.clustering_coeff(implementation='boost')
sage: clust_networkx = G.clustering_coeff(implementation='networkx')
sage: for v in G.vertices():
....:     if abs(clust_boost[v] - clust_networkx[v]) > 1E-12:

....:         print "   Boost clustering of", v, "is", clust_boost[v]
