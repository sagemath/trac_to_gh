Circular references shouldn't be problematic, unless one of the objects involved has a `__del__` method. However:

```
sage: K = GF(5)
sage: hasattr(K, '__del__')
False
sage: hasattr(K.algebraic_closure(), '__del__')
False
```

And indeed:

```
sage: while 1:
....:     print get_memory_usage()
....:     for p in range(2, 102):
....:         A = GF(nth_prime(p)).algebraic_closure()
....:         
<constant amount of memory>
```

That's just because there is only one base ring. Do the same while iterating over `GF(p)`, and you'll see how things accumulate.

At #18897, a binary tree was duely deallocated, however it was forgotten to dereference the root node. But here, we have objects that could be deallocated, but aren't. It is a totally different kind of leak.

It seems that the reference somehow comes from constructing the algebraic closure, as we have

```
sage: K = GF(31)
sage: del K
sage: L = [c for c in gc.get_objects() if isinstance(c, sage.rings.finite_rings.integer_mod.NativeIntStruct) and len(c._get_table())==31]
sage: len(L)
0
```
So, the NativeIntStruct can be garbage collected when we do not construct the algebraic closure.

How can one find a reference chain from the algebraic closure to the NativeIntStruct?

**Attachment:** [test_3.png](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket18905/test_3.png)

Let me try to recall why the current "weak-referencing coerce maps" are made as they are, to understand why we have a strong reference chain to `Int_to_IntegerMod`.

- We have a backtracking algorithm to find coerce maps by transitivity of "registered" coerce maps. Hence, registered coerce maps need to be stored in the codomain.
- Since the maps are stored in a container that is stored as an attribute of the codomain, there is a strong reference chain from the codomain to the coerce map.
- A strong reference to the codomain should not prevent the domain from garbage collection. Hence, IN COERCION, we use a weak reference from the map to the domain, and we cut the reference from the map to its parent.
- A strong reference to the domain should not prevent the codomain from garbage collection. That's what seems to fail in the current example.

What I do not understand: Why is that more than a strong reference CYCLE (which would not prevent garbage collection) from the codomain to the map and back?

Aha. The coercion model caches the coerce maps, too. So, it isn't the codomain only that holds a cache.

The coercion model is of course a permanent object. It references a `TripleDict` to store the coercion maps. The coercion map references the codomain. Hence, if the domain is strongly referenced from somewhere, then the coerce map and thus the codomain can not be garbage collected.

Can we perhaps make it so that the cache in the coercion model only keeps a WEAK reference to the coerce map? I worry about performance, though, since getting the referenced object from a weak reference is a bit costly.

Do we need to worry about premature collection of coerce map? If I understand correctly, the cache in the coercion model is mainly for performance, as the map is cached as an attribute of the codomain anyway. And the codomain of any map is a parent. Hence, the cache of the coercion model actually is redundant.

So, perhaps a better idea is to completely get rid of the coercion model cache, as the coercion model can use the codomain's cache. I'll try that.

I am afraid that #14058 (which now has a branch) does not suffice to fix the problem: GF(31) still can't be collected after creating its algebraic closure. However, the coercion model is not mentioned any longer. Instead, the reference goes via a weak value dictionary, which seems to be the polynomial ring cache.

My guess:
- There is some polynomial ring P over the base ring GF(31) that was constructed when creating the algebraic closure of GF(31).
- There is only a weak reference to P from the polynomial ring cache (it is weak value dictionary). However, for a different reason there is a strong reference to P.
- Hence, the entry for P in the weak value dictionary can not be freed. By consequence, the reference to the KEY of this entry, which is a STRONG reference to GF(31), can not be freed.
- Thus, GF(31) can not be deallocated.

The question is: How is there a strong reference to P? Perhaps there is a strong reference from GF(31) to P? Maybe via caching the algebraic closure, which references an element of P? This would be enough to keep P alive.

The lattice that is stored in the algebraic closure is either passed as an argument to the init method, or is constructed during init:

```python
    def __init__(self, base_ring, name, category=None, lattice=None, use_database=True):
        if not (is_FiniteField(base_ring) and base_ring.is_prime_field()):
            raise NotImplementedError('algebraic closures of finite fields are only implemented for prime fields')
        from sage.rings.finite_rings.conway_polynomials import PseudoConwayLattice
        p = base_ring.characteristic()
        if lattice is None:
            lattice = PseudoConwayLattice(p, use_database)
        elif not isinstance(lattice, PseudoConwayLattice) or lattice.p != p:
            raise TypeError('lattice must be a pseudo-Conway lattice with characteristic %s' % p)
        self._pseudo_conway_lattice = lattice
        AlgebraicClosureFiniteField_generic.__init__(self, base_ring, name, category)
```

That's a dilemma. If "lattice" is not passed as an argument, it is no problem to weakly reference it, as it can be reconstructed, should it be garbage collected. But otherwise? Hm.

I think I know a potential solution.

The problem, by the above analysis: The polynomial ring cache is a weak value dictionary. Generally, a strong reference chain from key to value will prevent garbage collection of the key-value pair.

I suggest to remove the "global" polynomial ring cache. Instead, I suggest that the polynomial ring constructor uses a weak value dictionary that is stored as an attribute of the base ring (e.g., in `self.__cached_methods`, which is available for all parents).

The weakly referenced values are polynomial rings. The keys are the list of variable names and information on term order and implementation---so, strong references to them shouldn't be problematic.

In that model, a strong reference chain from the base ring to the polynomial ring would NOT prevent garbage collection, since in the worst case it is a reference cycle (base ring <-> polynomial ring).

To my slight surprise, replacing the global polynomial ring cache by a local cache did not only solve the issue tracked here, but it did not introduce a new problem: With the attached branch, all tests should pass.

I have reviewed most part of #14058, but I think someone should have a look at my additions (review patch) there and finish the review.

Note that the same error appears at #14058, even though the commits from here are not part of #14058, if I see that correctly.

Could someone verify if it is really the case that tests pass with "develop", but fail with the branch from here (merged in "develop" of course)? I currently do not have the bandwidth.

Please be clearer. It fails in what setting? Does it only fail with #14058? Does it also fail with develop? Does it also fail with the branch from here?

If it fails both here and at #14058, but not with develop, then I reckon both branches trigger a memory leak that was introduced elsewhere.

I think the description of the ticket should be updated because I don't see those instances with multiple of one hundred anymore on sage-6.9.rc0. (Exactly what leaks are fixed in this ticket?)

Is the following line needed?

```
+from sage.structure.parent import Parent
```

Other than that, I verified that the branches indeed fixes the problem mentioned at comment 33. When the two thing above are fixed, to me, it will be a positive review.

>  because I don't see those instances with multiple of one hundred anymore on sage-6.9.rc0.

Sorry, I am retracting here as I do see them on sage-6.9.rc0:

```python
sage: L = [1,1,0,1,0,1,2,1,1,0,0,1,2,0,0,1,1,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,1]
sage: %cpaste

:--
sage: test_mod_100(L, 5)

 (<class 'sage.rings.ideal.Ideal_pid'>, 100),
 (<class 'sage.rings.homset.RingHomset_quo_ring_with_category'>, 100)]
```

and they do disappear with this ticket on top on sage-6.9.rc0:

```python
sage: test_mod_100(L, 5)
[]
```

That being said, I do see some stuff on the second, third, fourth execution of `test(L, 5)`:

```python
sage: test(L, 5)
[(<type 'tuple'>, 5198),
 (<class 'sage.rings.algebraic_closure_finite_field.AlgebraicClosureFiniteField_pseudo_conway_with_category.element_class'>,  101),

 (<type 'sage.rings.finite_rings.element_pari_ffelt.FiniteFieldElement_pari_ffelt'>,  1104),
 (<type 'dict'>, 102)]
```

Is this problematic?
