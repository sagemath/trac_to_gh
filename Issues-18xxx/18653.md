```
The following should be made to work:

```
sage: A.<a,b,c,d,e,f> = FreeAlgebra(QQ, implementation='letterplace')
sage: p = a*b*a*c*d*a*f
sage: p[3:-1]
c*d*a
```
So, a `__getitem__` method should be implemented for monomials of free algebras.

<a id='comment:11'></a>Hi Viviane,

you define `is_monomial` by `len(list(self)) == 1`. There is a faster way to determine the number of terms. With

```
singular_size = singular_function('size')
```
the number of terms of `self` becomes `singular_size(self._poly)`.
