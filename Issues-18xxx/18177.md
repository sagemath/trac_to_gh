`Matrix.random()` do not give uniform distribution. What's worse, for GF matrices it does not even generate them all. Until this is fixed at least warning is needed in documentation.

Something like `all(a_random_matrix() != m for i in range(100))`?

Hmm... For unimodular `3x3` matrices over `GF(3)` there seems to be `3^5` different matrix that are never returned. But for `2x2` over `GF(2)` there are only 3 of those. Easiest example is `M=Matrix([[0,2],[2,0]])`. But is this information useful to user?

It answers some questions that one could ask, like: "Okayy, it says that it does not always work but perhaps it will work for me because I deal with very small matrices over very small fields?". And the answer is 'no'. It is not very important, I was just thinking that it would be cool to say "not all matrices appear, for example: <sage code>".

If you think that it is too much trouble, no problem.
