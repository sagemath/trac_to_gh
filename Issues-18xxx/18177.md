`Matrix.random()` do not give uniform distribution. What's worse, for GF matrices it does not even generate them all. Until this is fixed at least warning is needed in documentation.

Looks good. A naive request: if there is an example of small order for which you are sure that a given matrix `M` is never returned, could you add a doctest/example to this warning to illustrate it?

Something like `all(a_random_matrix() != m for i in range(100))`?
