In the study of Hopf algebras (both graded and finite dimensional), one is led to look at convolution powers of the identity, and convolution products more generally. These should be implemented in `bialgebras.py`.

Of possible future utility is the iterated coproduct, so I define that as well.

Here are some comments summarizing the live review we did at Sage Days 65:

* The first argument `arg0` in `def method_name(arg0, ...):` should be `self`; this is a Python coding convention (and not strictly necessary for the code to work, but Sage coding conventions requires this).

* Your documentation strings need to be formatted according to Sage coding conventions. Here is a link to the relevant page in the Sage developer's guide:[The docstring of a function](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#the-docstring-of-a-function-content).

* The function `n_fold_coproduct` defined within `convolution_power` is interesting and should be a method on its own.

All,

I have merged #18350 with this ticket. Some comments/questions for people in-the-know to weigh-in on...

* I have moved `.adams_operator()` to `bialgebras.py`, and overwrote it using code from Amy Pang (*amypang*). Then in `hopf_algebras.py` I overwrote the bialgebras version, allowing for negative integer powers. (E.g., the (-2)nd convolution power of the identity is none other than the 2nd power of the antipode.)

* In fact, while adams operators naturally belong in `bialgebras.py`, the present code actually belongs in `bialgebras_with_basis.py`---as it uses `.module_morphism()` and `.apply_multilinear_morphism()`---but this would require more rewriting than I feel qualified to handle.

* **Easy fix?** When poking around for an algebra without basis---on which to test a preliminary version of my code---I noticed that Sage doesn't know that `QQ[x]` is a module over `QQ` (and hence, one cannot build ``QQ[x].tensor(QQ[x])`. Crazy.

* **Easy fix?** Similarly, even though `B = FreeAlgebra(QQ,a,b)` is robust enough that `B.tensor(B)` doesn't throw errors, quotients are out-of-bounds again. Putting `C = B.quotient_ring((a*b-b^2,))`, I get an AttributeError when asking for `C.tensor(C)`.

* I would like to add some morphism functionality at the parent level before setting ticket to "needs_review": given linear morphisms R,S,T for a bialgebra B, create their convolution product, a new morphism, via `RST = B.convolution_product(R,S,T)`. However, it seems ticket #15832 will have a lot of overlap with such code, so I'll hold off on implementing it unless somebody suggests otherwise.

* If anybody can explain why iterated coproduct followed by iterated product is slower than Amy Pang's code, I'd love to hear it.

A 'thanks' in advance for any comments.

-- Aaron

In fact, there is *no dependency*, and the first thing I did was undo all the changes JBP made to `hopf_algebras.py`. I think **not both** tickets should be completed. I'm happy to move all my edits to #18350 and delete the present ticket if that makes more sense... though I don't know how to do that either.\n\nAlternative?: set #18350 as positive review, as is, then start looking at this one? .... I'm really not sure what is the best; see next comment for more.\n\n> > * I have moved `.adams_operator()` to `bialgebras.py`, and overwrote it using code from Amy Pang (*amypang*).

Alternative idea, implemented in present ticket: I have deleted `.adams_operator()` from `hopf_algebras.py` and from `hopf_algebras_with_basis.py` and instead added an attribute check, `hasattr(self,'antipode')` within `bialgebras.py` to allow for negative convolution powers of the identity.\n\n> > * In fact, while adams operators naturally belong in `bialgebras.py`, the present code actually belongs in `bialgebras_with_basis.py`---as it uses `.module_morphism()` and `.apply_multilinear_morphism()`---but this would require more rewriting than I feel qualified to handle.\n \n> \n> Then I would move the method into `BialgebrasWithBasis` and put an `@abstract_method(optional=True)` on an empty `adams_operators` in `Bialgebras` (on #18350).\n\n\nI don't know how to do the former (the move), as `bialgebras_with_basis.py` just contains a **def** not a **class**. Maybe there is a monkey-patching solution, overwriting whatever ParentMethods and ElementMethods classes that get created by the **def**, but I'm comfortable trying neither this solution nor overhauling the whole file (i.e., to make it look more like `hopf_algebras_with_basis.py`).\n\nIs there a better solution than the latter (abstract_method)? It's not really *optional*... more like *not presently code-able*. Perhaps a better solution is to keep things in `bialgebras.py`, perform an attribute check, `self in ModulesWithBasis` and add \"..TODO:: remove dependency on bases\" to the docstring? Anyhow, this is what I'm doing in latest commit.\n\n> > * **Easy fix?** When poking around for an algebra without basis---on which to test a preliminary version of my code---I noticed that Sage doesn't know that `QQ[x]` is a module over `QQ` (and hence, one cannot build ``QQ[x].tensor(QQ[x])`.

If ever #15832 gets adopted, the code here can be shortened by a few lines at most.\nNote 1: But see comments in `sage.categories.bialgebras.ParentMethods.convolution_product` regarding speed.\nNote 2: Also, I do not know how to keep `.convolution_product()` from showing up in the list of methods available to, e.g., `sym=SymmetricFunctions(QQ)`.

I have looked at %prun using `SymmetricFunctions(QQ).m()` and `SymmetricGroupAlgebra(QQ,6)`, which have radically different Hopf structure (and number of terms in product/coproduct). In both cases, `_convolution_product_from_elements()` (based on Amy's code) destroys `convolution_product()` (based on my code and Jean-Baptiste's code).

I'm sure that's the wrong thing to do, but perhaps it's also the best thing to do, given the steps I already took (merging). In fact, there is *no dependency*, and the first thing I did was undo all the changes JBP made to `hopf_algebras.py`. I think **not both** tickets should be completed. I'm happy to move all my edits to #18350 and delete the present ticket if that makes more sense... though I don't know how to do that either.

Alternative?: set #18350 as positive review, as is, then start looking at this one? .... I'm really not sure what is the best; see next comment for more.

It was not an isolated commit (I've learned my lesson, thanks!). Alternative idea, implemented in present ticket: I have deleted `.adams_operator()` from `hopf_algebras.py` and from `hopf_algebras_with_basis.py` and instead added an attribute check, `hasattr(self,'antipode')` within `bialgebras.py` to allow for negative convolution powers of the identity.

I don't know how to do the former (the move), as `bialgebras_with_basis.py` just contains a **def** not a **class**. Maybe there is a monkey-patching solution, overwriting whatever ParentMethods and ElementMethods classes that get created by the **def**, but I'm comfortable trying neither this solution nor overhauling the whole file (i.e., to make it look more like `hopf_algebras_with_basis.py`).

Is there a better solution than the latter (abstract_method)? It's not really *optional*... more like *not presently code-able*. Perhaps a better solution is to keep things in `bialgebras.py`, perform an attribute check, `self in ModulesWithBasis` and add "..TODO:: remove dependency on bases" to the docstring? Anyhow, this is what I'm doing in latest commit.

I'm going to fiddle with this. If that's all it takes, I'll start a new ticket and it should be completed easily enough.

Sorry. the code I ran was:

```
sage: B = FreeAlgebra(QQ,['a','b'])
sage: a,b = B.gens()
sage: B.tensor(B)
sage: C = B.quotient_ring((a*b-b^2,))
sage: C.tensor(C)
```

However, it seems ticket #15832 will have a lot of overlap with such code, so I'll hold off on implementing it unless somebody suggests otherwise.
 
> 
> I would work on #15832 and either create a follow-up with the additional code or just add that code directly to #15832.


Found an alternative solution in present commit. If ever #15832 gets adopted, the code here can be shortened by a few lines at most.
Note 1: But see comments in `sage.categories.bialgebras.ParentMethods.convolution_product` regarding speed.
Note 2: Also, I do not know how to keep `.convolution_product()` from showing up in the list of methods available to, e.g., `sym=SymmetricFunctions(QQ)`. Any ideas on how to remove this?
(At present, the code assumes *self* is something more like `SymmetricFunctions(QQ).m()` If the check wasn't there, Sage would throw an error, because sym.tensor(sym) doesn't work.)...

```
sage: sym = SymmetricFunctions(QQ); m = sym.m()
sage: Id3 = m.convolution_product((lambda x: x,)*3)
sage: Id3(m[1]) == 3*m[1]
True
sage: sym.con <TAB>
sym.construction         sym.convert_map_from     sym.convolution_product
sage: sym.convolution_product((lambda x: x,)*3)
AttributeError: `self` (Symmetric Functions over Rational Field) must belong to ModulesWithBasis. Try defining convolution product on a basis of `self` instead.
```

I have included a second ParentMethods command, `_convolution_product_from_elements()` for others to investigate. I have looked at %prun using `SymmetricFunctions(QQ).m()` and `SymmetricGroupAlgebra(QQ,6)`, which have radically different Hopf structure (and number of terms in product/coproduct). In both cases, `_convolution_product_from_elements()` (based on Amy's code) destroys `convolution_product()` (based on my code and Jean-Baptiste's code). I can't glean much, other than that total number of operations are vastly different.

```

sage: m = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).m();

If they are separate tickets (with separate functionality), then you should not have merged #18350 in with this ticket, and we'll have to untangle them. Probably start with a clean branch and copy your current state into the new branch.

Otherwise one has to be a dependency of the other (although not necessarily in the current order), which from my understanding should be the case because there is overlap.

I'm not very good about isolating commits either (I try, but often forget and typically it's not a problem).

I can set this up for you.

If you feel better about it, then just leave it out altogether if you can't use the `Bialgebras` generic code. Although you can add a `.. TODO::` in the `WithBasis` implementation.

I think it deserves a ticket at the very least to keep a record of what we want Sage to do.

I would say this is a shortcoming with the `WithRealizations` framework and we would need to add some more magic to the category code's black magic. While I know some of it's dark and mysterious powers, I don't know if I could make this change. Nicolas, thoughts?

I only see a big gain in the one test, but I'll take a look at it.

So the setup for the bialgebras is on the branch `u/tscrim/category_hopf_algebras_with_basis`, which is based on `6.8.beta7`. Thus you can just pull/merge it into your branch and go from there.

For the speed difference, I believe it is due to the overhead of the intermediary objects. For example, calling `tensor` and the elements that are created in between the application of the morphisms. However I haven't looked too deeply into it.

I made a few improvements (I hope you think they are) to the documentation and examples.

I also added some "TODO" items in the code (numbers at the begin of the line are the line numbers):

```
132:            TODO: finish the above sentence ::

163:            # TODO : test this if statement and explain what it means to be flexible

324:            TODO : what is the next line testing? ::

333:            TODO : what is the next line testing? ::

408:            # TODO : test this if statement and explain what it means to be flexible
```

A question:

- Does this depend on #18350? or is this intended to subsume it?

Two quick comments:
first, on line 119 of `bialgebras_with_basis.py`, there should be a double colon at the end of the line:

```
identity map on group algebra of the symmetric group::
```
Second, the new docstrings should start with `r"""`, not just `"""`, at least if they contain any backslashes as parts of TeX commands.

I've made some changes:

- I reworked the documentation around a bit.
- I moved `coproduct_iterated` to `CoalgebrasWithBasis` since it is well-defined there.
- I updated a few doctests for trivial failures (because of the added explicit category for `BialgebrasWithBasis`).

I'm thinking this is in good enough shape to merge into Sage as-is, and if there are any issues/improvements, then we can handle those on followup tickets. Thoughts?

---

For future reference, we will probably have (and want) to implement a custom subclass of `Morphism` for convolution products of morphisms for bialgebras without a specified basis (but considering we don't have any in Sage currently, I don't think this is a high priority).
