apparently `list()` calls `len`, and `len` calls list. I do not see anything wrong with the design.

The two examples in [comment:3](#comment%3A3) and [comment:4](#comment%3A4) are not exactly wrong in the same way. In algebraic geometry, a scheme is not a set. And indeed

```
sage: P = ProjectiveSapce(2,GF(2))
sage: P in Sets()
False
sage: P.point_set() in Sets()
True
```
I do not understand why there is a `__len__` implemented there! It is inherited from `Parent` as

```
def __len__(self):
    return len(self.list())
```
Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

This 'len' should be in `FiniteEnumerateSet` or whatever it is named nowadays.

Some people thinks that opening a ticket solves an issue... I am worried by the "it is going to" which is a date between now and never (though the bound is strict on the right hand side).

I just ran into this bug:

```
sage: P.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(1, QQ)
sage: Q = P.subscheme(x - y)
sage: S = Q.point_set()
sage: S.points()
[(1 : 1)]
sage: S.list()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded in __instancecheck__
```
The easiest way to solve this is to make `list()` an alias for `points()` in `sage.schemes.projective.projective_homset.SchemeHomset_points_projective_field`.  Alternatively we could implement `__iter__()` in this class and make `points()` a wrapper around that.
