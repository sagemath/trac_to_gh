Some people thinks that opening a ticket solves an issue... I am worried by the "it is going to" which is a date between now and never (though the bound is strict on the right hand side).

<a id='comment:13'></a>I just ran into this bug:

```
sage: P.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(1, QQ)
sage: Q = P.subscheme(x - y)
sage: S = Q.point_set()
sage: S.points()
[(1 : 1)]
sage: S.list()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded in __instancecheck__
```
The easiest way to solve this is to make `list()` an alias for `points()` in `sage.schemes.projective.projective_homset.SchemeHomset_points_projective_field`.  Alternatively we could implement `__iter__()` in this class and make `points()` a wrapper around that.
