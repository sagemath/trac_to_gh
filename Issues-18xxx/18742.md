I propose to extend the interactive_simplex_method classes so that they take an optional keyword argument "style", which controls several aspects of how the problems and their dictionaries are presented. The style can also be set globally.

For example, if style='Vanderbei' (which we are working on in this ticket), it would follow Robert Vanderbei's popular text. Compared to the current code (which textbook does it follow?), there are differences in the naming of slack variables, of the objective functions, and some subtle formatting differences.

Supporting the styles of some popular textbooks may help making Sage the tool of choice for teaching the simplex method.

It follows lecture notes (based on Chavatal, I think) that I have adapted and modified a bit.

Can you be more clear on what do you want to affect apart from printing out dictionaries and auto-generated names?

I would be against multiple Python attribute synonyms for different parts of the problem/dictionary - I think there has to be a meaningful name for everything (like `basic_variables`) accompanied perhaps by one short name (like `x_B`). Otherwise things will be too confusing, especially if different names of the same things are used internally.

Otherwise it would be fantastic to have different output styles, perhaps there should be even an easy way to install user formatters (without altering Sage). Have you tried to use it in teaching, by the way?

There is also a question about "standard form" perhaps, but changing it is likely to require different classes or the code will get too messy, that's the point of any standard form after all - simplify notation by sticking to some convention.

Should the style currently implemented be called 'chvatal' then? I don't have my copy at hand to check if it's the same.

> Can you be more clear on what do you want to affect apart from printing out dictionaries and auto-generated names?

I think that's mostly it.

> I would be against multiple Python attribute synonyms for different parts of the problem/dictionary - I think there has to be a meaningful name for everything (like `basic_variables`) accompanied perhaps by one short name (like `x_B`). Otherwise things will be too confusing, especially if different names of the same things are used internally.

I don't have plans to change the Python interface, except for adding these "style=..." parameters.

Maybe later some new methods for new functionality -- for example, Vanderbei has a "dual-based phase 1" method (in section 5.7).

> Otherwise it would be fantastic to have different output styles, perhaps there should be even an easy way to install user formatters (without altering Sage). 

OK, we should have the first version of the patch ready soon.

> Have you tried to use it in teaching, by the way?

No, I discovered your code too late when I taught linear programming in Spring. Used Vanderbei's online pivot tool; but that's getting increasingly difficult to use because of Java security settings.

Hmmm, that's not quite what I thought was going to happen.

1. Are there use cases when it is convenient to work a lot with multiple style problems? It seems to me that you probably like one or the other and don't care about other styles at all. Then it would make sense to have a single global style variable (in the module, of course, not in the global user namespace) which the user can set once in the beginning of each session and not worry about it again.
2. The naming "None" and "vanderbei" could be improved. How about using proper capitalization string for authors, i.e. "Vanderbei" and something more descriptive for the current style, say "UAlberta" since I am not bold enough to claim it under my own name ;-) It may be convenient to also support "default" which will equate to one of the named styles.
3. The way how style differences are documented makes it a bit hard to follow and most definitely will be hard to expand in the future. How about: have a single function (rather than exposed variable) that changes the style or returns current one, whose docstring lists all possible styles and instead of comparing them to each other has a list of conventions for each (i.e. dictionaries are displayed like ..., default objective variable is ..., default dual variables are ..., etc.) Then adding another style means adding another block to this function without altering others. Functions whose default behaviour depends on the style can just point to that function for details instead of duplicating descriptions.

In Vanderbei, primal dictionaries are always "max zeta", and dual dictionaries are always "-max -xi".
The other cases do not appear; so any decision what to do with those will be consistent and fine with me.

"objective_name" sounds fine to me. With "objective", I think there is a risk of confusion with the objective coefficients.

If you are really concerned about backwards incompatibility for this code, then this solution as you propose would seem fine.

Nitpicks:

- Every function has to have input/output blocks if there is any input/output.

- Copy-pasting is bad in general and lead to some mistakes in dictionary code and documentation.

More substantial:

- The point of `style` is to affect output and automatic choice of names which also really matter only when displayed. Therefore `LPAbstractDictionary` has nothing to do with the style and since there was no customization for `LPRevisedDictionary` let's not through in extra arguments there.

- I still feel like overall logic will be cleaner if there was a single style rather than separate for each problem - no need to drug style arguments around and pass it along to every newly constructed instance, or engage in aforementioned copy-pasting. I just don't see under what circumstances someone will want to actively work with different styles at once. Can I rewrite things without `style` argument to problems/dictionaries?

    if slack_variable is None:
        slack_variable = _default_name[style]["slack variable"]
    ```
    
- Is there any default auxiliary variable name in Vanderbei?

Since the style affects default names of primal and dual, I would be a bit concerned about what happens when a user creates a problem P, then changes the global style, then dualizes the problem. However, if this can be done consistently, I have no strong objections to having just a global style variable.

I think this is a great idea.

What do you mean by auxiliary variable? The one in a primal phase I? That's x0.
