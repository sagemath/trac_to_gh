```
When dot2tex is installed, `P6=Posets(6)` takes more than 50 seconds to run

```
len([P for P in P6 if P.is_incomparable_chain_free(2,2)])
```

but

```
A=Posets.ChainPoset(2).disjoint_union(Posets.ChainPoset(2))
len([P for P in P6 if not P.has_isomorphic_subposet(A)])
```

takes less than one second.

Hello !

I've got no problem with the branch, but could you remove this 'TODO' from the code and opena  ticket instead?

I personally don't believe that Sage should do things like that. It should do what it is asked to do: even if we knew what the most 'probable' pattern is in general, we have no clue what the user's input is.

If you want some cheap speedup, here is one: you can pre-compute 'height' and remove from the list all pairs with an element larger than 'height'. That would 'always' work, and be rather cheap. 

Nathann
