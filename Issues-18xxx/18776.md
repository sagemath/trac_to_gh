Actually this happens with just posets:

```
P = Poset({0:[1]})
R = Poset(P, facade=False)
P._hasse_diagram is R._hasse_diagram
```

also outputs `False`. I can see no reason for this either. And still more, what about

```
P = Poset({0:[1]})
Q = P.relabel(lambda i: chr(ord('a')+i))
P._hasse_diagram is Q._hasse_diagram
```

? Relabeling does not touch the underlying digraph of plain `int`s.

Sorry, but I do not understand. What is "required fixed linear extensions"?

For example there is three possible linear extension for the pentagon poset. If I do `relabel(lambda i: chr(ord('a')+i))` to it, why I can not use exactly same Hasse diagram, and so exactly same linear extension? Or to say it by code, what will following break?

```
P=Posets.PentagonPoset()
P._elements=('a','b','c','d','e')
P._element_to_vertex_dict={'a': 0, 'b': 1, 'c': 2, 'd': 3, 'e': 4}

The problem seems to be in `UniqueRepresentation`:

```
A = Poset( ([0,1,2], []) )
A._elements = ('a','b','c')
A._element_to_vertex_dict = {'a': 0, 'b': 1, 'c': 2}
A._list = ('a','b','c')
B = Poset( ([0,1,2], []) )
C = Poset( ([0,1,2], []), key="heyhou")
A.list(), B.list(), C.list()
```

outputs `(['a', 'b', 'c'], ['a', 'b', 'c'], [2, 1, 0])`.

This is too complicated for me, so I suggest this one to be closed.

OK, but I raise my hands: can't do.

And the problem is smaller now, when meets and joins are faster to compute (thanks for review, btw).
