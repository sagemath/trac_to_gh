```
A = Poset( ([0,1,2], []) )
A._elements = ('a','b','c')
A._element_to_vertex_dict = {'a': 0, 'b': 1, 'c': 2}
A._list = ('a','b','c')
B = Poset( ([0,1,2], []) )
C = Poset( ([0,1,2], []), key="heyhou")
A.list(), B.list(), C.list()
```

outputs `(['a', 'b', 'c'], ['a', 'b', 'c'], [2, 1, 0])`.

This is too complicated for me, so I suggest this one to be closed.

OK, but I raise my hands: can't do.

And the problem is smaller now, when meets and joins are faster to compute (thanks for review, btw).
