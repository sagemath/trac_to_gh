As global module variables point toward the (unique) `PariInstance` instance built by Sage, and because those are not automatically cleaned, this instance is never deleted. Thus, we do it explicitly in `quit_sage`, as it was done before #13741.

Replying to [@jdemeyer](#comment%3A9):
> The problem isn't that `pari` is never deallocated, the problem is apparently that Cython global variables are never deallocated.

A little googling gives me the impression that this is a wide-spread problem with python (extension) modules: there is no way to "unload" a module (which would be the time to deallocate global variables), and it seems it doesn't exist because people haven't been able to solve the subtle problems that arise in deciding when and in what order unloading should happen (especially extension modules seem to be complicated this way)

Indeed, without extra information, the fact that arbitrary code could be executed upon deallocation means there is no sure-fire way to decide a correct way to order module deallocation. It wouldn't be hard to write 2 modules A and B such that the deallocation code of one requires the other module to be functional. One would require a rather careful protocol specification to allow module deactivation.

Without extra information, you cannot start deallocating global variables unless you know the module has been "deactivated". So I think Cython in general will not be solving this problem any time soon.
