During SageDays66 and on [https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/LXWs6KOw0Lk](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/LXWs6KOw0Lk) there were discussions about the possibility to add code to Sage which is marked as "experimental". For this code no deprecation would be needed (for some time, e.g. a year or when the developers decide) in case of changes in the code.

One motivation for this is, that many modules are developed not in Sage but outside (but with the goal of implementing it in to Sage when ready). This is done later, when it is clear, that the designs have turned out to be a good choice (and maybe changed a couple of times). Having it included in Sage from the beginning would have lead to several deprecations in many cases, which are a lot of effort and therefore a barrier in the development process.
