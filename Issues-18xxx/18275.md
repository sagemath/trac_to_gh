```
sage: C = GF(5).cartesian_product(GF(5))
sage: C.one() - C.one()
... BOOOOM (infinite recursion) ...
```
The reason is that there is no default implementation of `_sub_` in `ElementMethods` of `Rings` (whereas there is one in `sage.structure.element.RingElement`).

I do not especially want to modify something ;-) Actually this is what is in `sage.structure.element.RingElement`. But not all ring elements inherit from it. Hence the failure.
