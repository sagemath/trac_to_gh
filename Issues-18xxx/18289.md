<a id='comment:1'></a>Note that `__repr__` did not change:

```
sage: repr(graphs.RandomGNP(500,.2))
'RandomGNP(500,0.200000000000000): Graph on 500 vertices'
```
This is only about rich output, which is different from the standard `repr`.

If you want rich output of graphs to be just text then thats fine with me, but show() and pretty_print() will then also just be text.

For the record, I think that most users will not understand this subtle difference.  I know that I don't.  What is "rich output", anyway?

That said, if you think it's a pretty nasty bug that `show` has different results for different object types, that could be worth discussing on sage-devel.  I guess for most non-plot objects I can think of, `show` does some LaTeXing, right?  And it seems reasonable to me to have different default outputs for

```
sage: Obj
```
for different kinds of objects - a plot should be shown, a symbolic expression should just be printed, a matrix should be printed unless it's too big, etc., while

```
sage: Obj.show()
```
should "show" the object in some meaningful way.  But maybe that's related to the `pretty_print`, which I never really used but maybe is becoming more important?

Sorry for this postscript, I just feel like there are some hairs being split here that are perhaps overly infinitesimally split already.

<a id='comment:12'></a>Rich output (`_rich_repr_`) is a hook for an object to provide more than just text output to the UI. 

The functions show and pretty_print display the rich output immediately (like print), without waiting for the current computation to finish.

The `graph.show()` method does its own thing, though the graph plotting (wtf is `GraphPlot`) reinvents the wheel in slightly less round ways so often that I have lost count.

<a id='comment:16'></a>Hello,

I arrive after the battle in this ticket since it took me some time to compile beta2. For some unknown reason, `make` results in the construction of `a tout of sage` in all languages. A bit too much. I should learn how to use it to speed up compilation.

I'm happy that the automatic show this behavior has been removed. I'm playing with many graphs with (tens of) thousands of nodes, most of the times remotely on a server, and it is very annoying (and long) when the server tries to display an image...

HMmmmmm... Well, I know that in the SMC, William changed the behavior of view(g) so that it is an alias of `g.show(method="js")`. So somehow it is a bit easier to view graphs.

Without addressing the actual implementation, it seems rather clear to me that whoever types `show(a_graph)` wants a picture of it.

The problem with graphs is that it is potentially very slow to plot them (apparently because of matplotlib), but in general there is not "one good drawing" of a graph. Moreover, at the moment the default plotting algorithm will give you a different drawing every time you call it.

Having a different behaviour depending on the size of the graph does not look good to me either, for it is not like for matrices where you see the whole matrix or just a one-line description: indeed, for graphs it would open a new windows (with a picture) in some cases or print a line of text.

All in all, having `show(a_graph)` display the TikZ/LaTeX code of the graph is definitely not what we would expect from the command.

A plot is just 'one representation' of a graph. Like for posets, for matrices (they have a .plot too). I type 'g' very often just to see whether this variable that is named 'g' in indeed a graph (as you would for any other Python object), but also because it tells me whether that graph allows multiple edges or loops.

This being said, like Vincent I expect that the expected behaviour is different in the notebook. If you want to improve that side of the interface, however, I believe that it might be better to output *both* in the notebook:
- The one-line description that we have in the console
- A drawing

Of course, not being able to plot large graphs is a problem. So like for matrices, perhaps a size limit may be good.. But really, most graphs do *NOT* look good when you plot them, and the result may appear very very very unprofessional, which is probably something you want to avoid:

```
sage: graphs.RandomGNP(50,.5).show()
```

Perhaps the default layout can be slightly improved, but I have no idea how to solve the performance problem with matplotlib.

Why is that unrelated to this ticket? Didn't you say that this change (from picture to latex output) had been made by #17821?

> Bonus points if you can guess correctly what happens without trying it out (I could not)


With this branch applied it gives me the latex code `O_o`

The key to the non-discussion above is this:

```
sage: show is pretty_print
True
```

That `show` is an alias for `pretty_print` is a problem here, for `show(g)` seems to indicate a plot while `pretty_print(g)` seems to indicate the kind of latex representation that Volker wants.

Even though `show(g)` is indeed used frequently (Volker removes those doctests in this branch), it is definitely hard to do anything coherent when two functions with such different meanings are aliases of each other.

Soooooooo well. If we can solve the problem by deprecating the `show` alias, and if in the meantime it still displays a plot for graphs while hinting at `Graph.show` or `Graph.plot`, then nobody will be lost. What do you think?

Which version are you running? In sage-6.7.beta2 (console) I got `True` as well.

Since a SageNB user will hardly type `latex` by hand (I'm not using the notebook, so I'm guessing), why should `latex` print anything but code useful for inclusion in a paper?

I think it's hardly possible to reuse output functionality too much, since the use cases are quite diverse.  So, if I understand you correctly, I would very much prefer the second solution.  It would be a shame if I can use `latex(matrix)` and `latex(symbolic_expression)` but not `latex(graph)`.

I have not yet encountered this meaning in the context of computer graphics.  Wikipedia doesn't have it either, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plot_%28graphics%29, vs. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_drawing.

Although I don't use it, there is currently a distinction between `show` and `plot` for matrices, and I'd say it matches what I expect.  `plot` tries to interpret the matrix as  something like a contour plot, whereas `show` opens an external viewer to see a big matrix in all detail.

In Sage, once this branch is applied we get this:

Could you change this branch so that `show(graphs.PetersenGraph())` opens a window and displays a graph, as it has been the case for years?

Without this branch (i.e. with beta3) this command opens a window with a plot:

```
sage: show(graphs.PetersenGraph())
```

> I'm happy with that if you are.


I am not. `G_{10}` means nothing to somebody in the graph world, and the previous output was way more informative:

```
sage: Graph(4,loops=True,multiedges=True)
Looped multi-graph on 4 vertices
```

> I'm only against show() returning something else than the displayhook.


I am against 'show()' returning anything else than what it has been returning for the last 5 years. You can add a deprecation warning if you plan to remove 'show()' (I would agree with it), but anything else would be problematic: you cannot expect `show(g)` to be different from `g.show()`.

In the meantime, as per our deprecation policy, the result should still be the same for one year.

There is no reason to consider `show(a_graph) # opens a window` as a bug either. I consider it as a feature, as do most of the people I talk with.

It doesn't do that (or, rather, it only does that in the commandline ui). Do you really think that the SageNB behavior where show switches from tkz graphics to matplotlib graphics is a feature?

Why do you keep bringing the notebook up? I never mentionned anything related to the notebook. I do not use it, I am just barely aware that it exists and is simultaneously being replaced by Jupyter and SMC.

All I ask is for you to revert the changes you made that break several things I (and others) work with. Namely:

- `show(graphs.PetersenGraph())` used to open a window and plot the graph
- `graphs.PetersenGraph()` used to display `Petersen graph: Graph on 10 vertices`

If, additionally, you want to deprecate 'show' (in another ticket) I have absolutely nothing against that. The semantics of `show` and `pretty_print` are very different, and since you made one an alias of the other we have been discussing the problems it caused.

Seems like we are missing an opportunity. But if graph theory is the only field of mathematics that doesn't benefit from Latex's typesetting capabilities then thats fine with me...


> Why do you keep bringing the notebook up? I never mentionned anything related to the notebook. I do not use it, I am just barely aware that it exists and is simultaneously being replaced by Jupyter and SMC.


None of the three has a notion of exec'ing an external viewer, so if you prefer you can just replace SageNB with one of the other browser-based notebook. And I keep bringing this shit up precisely because I want the IPython notebook to work without having to maintain a fork like SMC. You can't define behavior in terms of "I want/don't want an external viewer launched", that is crap.

We do NOT like this change. How many tickets have you already created to fix th problems it caused? Please *REVERT* it.

You just renamed this ticket from "revert the changes" to "make graph display configurable": I do not want to be forced to agree with changes that do not concern me (for example in the notebook) in order for graphs to be fixed. Please rename this ticket to its old name, and fix what you broke. And *only that*.

Possibly because some of the changes in #17821 are graph-specific? Try it in beta3:

```
sage: graphs.PetersenGraph() # plots a picture
sage: posets.ChainPoset(4) # does not plot a picture
```

If everything that *can* be plotted *was* plotted you would hear a lot more noise. But no, #17821 did this for graphs in particular. This inconsistency must be reverted too.

Wow. And it only took a week of posts. How constructive can we get?

> The attached branch now implements this.


And much more. Here is a first-pass review:

- Thanks for fixing the command-line usage

- With your modifications, the notebook displays a picture of the graph when it
  has order 0<..<20. Notebook users, who may be beginners, could get used to
  graphs that are displayed so easily, and not know what do to when, by adding a
  vertex to their graph, they can't obtain a plot anymore. When the graphs is
  *not* plotted because it is too large, it may be good to hint at how they
  could get a plot, a bit like what happens for matrices:

  {{{
  sage: identity_matrix(100)
  100 x 100 dense matrix over Integer Ring (use the '.str()' method to see the entries)
  }}}

  What would you think of returning a string similar to that in the notebook
  when the graph is too big to be automatically plotted?

  {{{
  Petersen graph: Graph on 10 vertices (use the '.show()' method to see the graph)
  }}}

- The one-line description, and the information we get from it, is not provided
  by the drawing only. What would you think, when in the notebook, to do both at
  once: print the string *AND* plot the graph? Users would get (strictly) more than what
  they get in the command-line interface because their UI has more capacities.

  The useful information is especially the number of vertices and whether the
  graph allows loops/multiple edges.

  I also thought of adding the number of edges there, eventually: this
  information will be useful to both kind of users.

- Could you explain this part of the code?
  {{{
  output = self.plot(**kwds)._rich_repr_(display_manager)
  if output is not None:
      return output
  }}}
  In which case would this call return a "None"?

- About other graph-like objects
  {{{
  Whether to graphically display graphs, posets, and other
  graph-like objects. When not specified small objects are show
  graphically and large objects as textual overview.
  }}}
  Posets do not inherit from graphs. Neither do automata, crystals, and many of
  the things that you may want to be plotted. Thus, currently this piece of
  documentation is incorrect (for posets), but we may also want to add
  others. Otherwise, graphs will just be an oddity in the notebook.

- Do you still plan to deprecate show in #18302?

- About the backend `default_preferences` functions that you add: right now they
  build an object (containing the preferences) that they return, but in order to
  change one specific preference one needs to overwrite the function with a new
  one. What would you think of having a `DisplayPreferences` object in each of

  `~/.sage/sage.init` file with just a line, i.e. something like:
  {{{

Sounds good, but will have to think about the proper implementation first. Right now there are only rich output containers for a particular type. So we either 
* render the text inside the image (meh)
* add an optional caption to all image output types (maybe), or
* add a rich output type that is a container of other rich output types (probably want this for other purposes, too)
I'd say that is material for another ticket.

By convention, the `_rich_repr_` method can just return `None` to indicate that there is no rich output, e.g. because the desired output types is not supported. The display framework then falls back to `_repr_`.

I've adjusted the docstring. I don't have any immediate plans to switch other objects to graphical output, though we should think about that when the dust has settled...

yes

Sounds good, though I wanted to revisit the preferences system to make it more general and make them more like google app engine ndb models. IMHO we need an easy-to-use validating(!) option system for graphics options and the like. The display preferences are just a quick implementation that I needed. It is better than dumb dictionaries, but not as good as it can be.

Great!

Great idea. We should have some "check_type" module with functions like that:

```
    sage: check_nonnegative_value(-2,"x") # exception if the value is negative or not in RR
    ...
    ValueError: 'x' (=-2) must be a nonnegative value

    check_allowed_value('d',"x",["A","B","C"]) # exception if x is not allowed
    ...
    ValueError: 'x' (='d') must be equal to one of "A","B","C"

    check_list_of_integers([1,2,3,"a",9]) # raise exception if not a list, or contains non-integers
    ...
    ValueError: "a" is not an integer
```

Then perhaps `DisplayPreferences` could just be a dictionary with a modified `__setitem__`?

If you want, in this ticket we can finalize the implementation of this gadget of yours, only it will not be the default. If so, what about the list of things that are automatically plotted "when the flag is enabled"?

The mechanism of `DiplayPreferences` for ech backend isn't bad really. Even though I am not a big fan of automatic pictures either.

I would like the graphs to not be the only objects that are automatically plotted. I will write a commit for `Posets`, `Quivers` and `Polygons`. Perhaps Braids and Knots too, if I figure out how it works inside.

Yes, but that is a feature. The object itself knows best how to display itself.

The names don't capture the behavior of "graphics if it can be displayed unobtrusively"

Oh.

> The names don't capture the behavior of "graphics if it can be displayed unobtrusively"


Should the name of the parameter capture it? Right now it can be set to 'always'. It is the value that `plot_graphs` takes that should carry the meaning of "if it is small".

What about renaming the parameter to `graphical_rich_repr`, taking values like `never`, `always`, `when_unobtrusive` (I am not a smart man™). I also believe that it would be better to work with `if value == 'always' or value == 'when_unobtrusive'` rather than `if value != 'never'`. We don't know what will happen with this parameter.

Well, this branch is not about SageNB but about the notebook, and the notebook behaves like Sage does on this respect.

Even if that were true, that would not mean that their 'no' should be taken as a "yes, let the notebook plot small objects automatically". If you think that they don't mind this change, mail to sage-devel and ask them again. 

I just don't want to give a positive review to a change when a question was asked and people said "don't do it". That's all.

I added a small commit at public/18289 for a `_rich_repr_` in Posets and Polyhedra. I was not able to find the Quiver class [1]. It is mostly a copy/paste of your code for graphs.

No ;-) For starters, that sounds like it would apply to plots.

I think the case where you want to display plain text + graphics is precisely where you don't want the graphics if it cannot be displayed inline. So rename `plot_graphs` to `supplemental_graphics`, and enhance the rich output system to have a flag for replacing text vs. supplementing text (ideally in another ticket)

THE notebook is still SageNB, which is the default for `sage --notebook`. The IPython notebook is still work in progress, in part because the rich output system is not finished. Any previous behavior of the IPython notebook is a bug unless noted otherwise. The IPython notebook is finished when it becomes the default.
