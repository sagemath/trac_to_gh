This ticket implements the following bases based upon N. Bergeron, N. Thiem. *A supercharacter table decomposition via power-sum symmetric functions* (2013) [arXiv version](http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.4901):

- `rho` -- the q-deformation of the `coarse_powersum` basis (renamed in this ticket from `q`)
- `chi` -- the supercharacter basis

and transition maps between them. This is distinct from #6924 in which a finer supercharacter theory is considered.

`all(a(A)==q(A) for A in SetPartitions(n))` is true for n<=7.

Can we go with a t-deformation since Hall-Littlewoods use that parameter (and then q is the second Macdonald parameter)

You are correct that the `a` basis is the same as the `q` basis (the strictly coarser set partitions is the same as the ordering as in BT). Good catch.

Nor do these seem to be an NCSym analog of Hall-Littlewood as the multiplication has coefficients in ZZ (as I was hoping). However, I'm not really attached to the variable name and I will change it if you think the association is not a good enough reason to keep it.\n\nNantel, thank you for checking.

<a id='comment:31'></a>I'm not sure if changing the coercion path is the issue.  There might be another ticket to be had here: implement coercion between generators of multiplicative bases.  Since the example that I gave above is `e(chi([[1], [2, 3]]))*e(chi([This is the Trac macro *1* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#1-macro)))*e(chi([[2], [1,3]]))` there is a faster way of computing it.  I did manage to compute it with this commit, but it took a while.  Real improvements will come from developing the mathematics.

I am happy with the current version.
