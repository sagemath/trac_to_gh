This ticket implements the following bases based upon N. Bergeron, N. Thiem. *A supercharacter table decomposition via power-sum symmetric functions* (2013) [arXiv version](http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.4901):

- `rho` -- the q-deformation of the `coarse_powersum` basis (renamed in this ticket from `q`)
- `chi` -- the supercharacter basis

and transition maps between them. This is distinct from #6924 in which a finer supercharacter theory is considered.

Is there a difference between the q and a bases?

```
all(a(A)==q(A) for A in SetPartitions(n))}}} is true for n<=7.

Can we go with a t-deformation since Hall-Littlewoods use that parameter (and then q is the second Macdonald parameter)

Thank you for all your additional fixes and cleanup. There might be a better way to do things than the current implementation, but I haven't done any serious profiling or know of some direct mathematical interpretation. However, going to the `m` basis already contains a large number of terms:

```
sage: len(m(chi([[1],[2,3],[4],[6],[5,7]])))
523
```
Currently there's a directly implemented coercion `e -> m`, but to go back, we have `m -> p -> h -> e`. I've changed the ordering that other bases get created with the `e` basis to get the coercion path `m -> p -> e`. So it should be a little bit faster. However I think there's some other speedups we could get, but perhaps on a followup?
