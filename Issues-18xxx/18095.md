}
```
The auto-generating of `src/sage/ext/interpreters/*` and `src/sage/libs/pari/auto*.pxi` should be done by `src/Makefile` which has proper dependency checking.

To further clean up building of Sage, we remove `src/bin/sage-build` and move all the logic for building the Sage library to `src/Makefile`.

Depends on #17860

Am I correct to understand that you removed the ability to do `sage-build -b`(or `sage -b -b`, if I read the source correctly, though I don't know if this version ever was intended to work) in order to perform a more aggressive rebuild? I have nothing against removing it, but this ”feature“ was mentioned on sage-support, so perhaps its removal should be a bit more explicit.

Also, perhaps the calls to `build_sage "$@"` in `sage/bin/sage` should be changed to just `build_sage` (and the corresponding `shift`s removed when they serve no other purpose) for clarity.

(I only had a quick look at the changes and did not even test them.)

Do you have a link?

all:

a workaround because the way `csage` is built makes it hard to set up the dependency without rebuilding `csage` every time? If that's the case, perhaps add a comment to that effect.

There is already some logic in `build/deps` such that when running `make`, then `csage` is built before `sage`.

I wouldn't call it a "workaround", it's more a separation of concerns. The default target `all` builds both, so there is no dependency issue either.

In any case: I would like to remove `csage` completely (see #17854), so this issue will disappear anyway.

I was wondering because you didn't just write `all: csage sage`.

Ok, fine with me.

I see, a post from 2010. In any case, the ability to run `src/bin/sage-build` will be removed simply because `sage-build` is removed. But this was never meant to be used directly by users, so I don't think that's an issue.

Because that might build `csage` and `sage` in parallel.

When `make all` is done, I do want `csage` and `sage` to be built in this order.

The build is unfortunately *never* done in parallel (since `./sage -b` uses `scons`, `cython` and `distutils`, which are not aware of `make` arguments). That's why you're supposed to do `MAKE="make -j4" make` in Sage, the environment variable can easily be read by Sage.
