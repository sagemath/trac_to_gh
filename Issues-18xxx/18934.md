CC:  @dimpase @videlec

This branch adds new BIBD to our database. Some are stolen from the La Jolla Covering Repository (https://www.ccrwest.org/cover.html), and other from the handbook of combinatorial designs.

They will be useful to generate strongly regular graphs from Brouwer's database #18948 (http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/)

I still can't see the point of that. All we care about (all that the function promises) is that it returns "some" bibd. If that works, then it rolls.

If it is, install 'bliss'. Should go way faster.

Well, you seem to prefer to hide the know-how how to use LJCR in this case.
It's not fair to a user that might need to use it for a similar task.

The interface with LJCR  has nothing to do with this function. There is no certitude that their entry will not change, there is no reason to carve in doctests that ours and theirs should match. This doctest tests more than the function claims, so it has no reason to be.

> It's not fair to a user that might need to use it for a similar task.


Nobody will have to. With this addition, there is no BIBD to be found on LJCR that Sage cannot build alone:

```
sage: missing = [(v,k) for v in range(101) for k in range(1,v) if designs.balanced_incomplete_block_design(v,k,existence=True) is Unknown]
sage: for v,k in missing:
....:     try:
....:         designs.balanced_incomplete_block_design(v,k,use_LJCR=True)
....:         print "found"
....:     except:
....:         pass
....:     
sage:
```

Do you intend to remove/fix the commit that contains the 'None == None' tests?
