Currently the Matroid class does not provide oriented matroids.
I propose to implement oriented matroids, so that we can handle:


- the properties of the underlying unoriented matroid
- the positive and negative elements
- a representation of the chirotope functions
- checking if the input really is a 
- checking if it is uniform
- giving out the face lattice
- duality
- ... 

It should be possible to construct OMs from:

- directly formulations as:
  - oriented bases of vector configuration
  - covectors
  - cocircuits
  - chirotopes

- matrices (point configurations) over ordered fields
- directed Graphs
- hyperplane arrangements
- polytopes

As a first idea, I propose to 

a. add a abstract OrientedMatroid class as a child of the abstract Matroid class
b. add a class OrientedBasisMatroid as a subclass of the new OrientedMatroid class
c. (possibly add other OrientedMatroid subclasses)
d. add a constructor function OrientedMatroid similar to the Matroid Conctructor, that can handle the various inputs

Perhaps its best to make this ticket a meta ticket and open new tickets for the points mentioned above. What do you think of the plan?

Hi Moritz,

I really like the plan.

1) The OrientedBasisMatroid class perhaps should be a subclass of BasisMatroid (or BasisExchangeMatroid) as well as OrientedMatroid; otherwise you have to do a extra work for each method already supported by BasisMatroid. For example, there is code for enumerating (unoriented) circuits in BasisExchangeMatroid. You don't want to repeat that code, I guess.

2) we use plain python sets in the Matroid interface to communicate subsets of the ground set. What will you use for the oriented sets, dictionaries or pairs of sets? I can imagine that the former is a lot faster as making pairs is a bit expensive, but I haven't tested it. 

Cheers,
Rudi

+1 would be easier to follow activity and reviews.
