+These special resultants are useful to compute the minimal polynomials,
+see #18242
+
+For instance
+
+```
+sage: p1 = minpoly(cos(pi/43))
+sage: p2 = minpoly(cos(pi/47))
+sage: time r1 = p1.composed_op(p2, '+')
+Wall time: 108 ms
+sage: time r2 = p1.composed_op(p2, '+', algorithm="resultant")
+Wall time: 52.3 s
+sage: r1 == r2.monic()
+True
+sage: r1.is_irreducible()
+True
+sage: r1.degree()
+483
+```
+so `r1` is the minimal polynomial of `cos(pi/43) + cos(pi/47)`
