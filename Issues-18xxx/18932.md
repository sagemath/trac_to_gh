Add pictures explaining graphically what `is_ranked()` and `is_graded()` are.

This may be a first picture ever added with Nathann Cohen's `PLOT`-option. So, in reality this can be seen as a test for that more than documentation for those functions.

<a id='comment:2'></a>Hello !

The pictures can help, but the text appears as a title in big letters, when you meant them more as an explanation, or a legend. What would you think of not writing it as a title, but as some text that appears before the '.. PLOT::' environment?

You are right. Good solution would be better plotting functions (There is an option for legend color - why not on legende size? Or why one can't set edge styles one-by-one like edge colors?).

As plots don't appear by `function_name?` on notebook, it seems hard to make a text that makes sense both in notebook and in html/pdf documentation.

And pictures without title or explanation are mostly useless.

Right right. As usual, the reason for those is "nobody did it yet". And the reason behind the reason is that drawing code is awful as a rule, because of the 999 different options and combinations of them.
