The `submatrix` methods for dense matrices mod 2<sup>e</sup> have a different signature than the other `submatrix` methods; the latter treat their last two arguments as optional. This leads to errors like this (from 6.8.beta5):

```
sage: d0=matrix(GF(2),[[1, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]])
sage: d0._echelon_form_PID()---------------------------------------------------------------------------

...
TypeError: submatrix() takes exactly 4 positional arguments (2 given)
``` 

or this

```
sage: d0=matrix(GF(2),[[1, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]])
sage: d1=matrix(GF(2),[[1, 1, 0, 0],
 [1, 1, 0, 0],
 [1, 1, 1, 1],
 [1, 1, 1, 1],

I have given the submatrix methods the same signature as in file "matrix1.pyx". This includes a name change of the arguments, because in parts of Sage (eg, `ChainComplex._homology_generators_snf`) the method is called with named arguments.

I also made this change: 

```
-        if self._ncols == 0 or self._nrows == 0:
+        if ncols == 0 or nrows == 0:
```
This fixed a segfault in my tests, and also seems to make more sense that the original: one returns an uninitialized matrix if *it* is empty, not if *self* is empty.

Caveat: I have no detailed understanding of m4rie, someone knowledgeable might want to have a look at my changes.
