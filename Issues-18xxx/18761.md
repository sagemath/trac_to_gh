I have given the submatrix methods the same signature as in file "matrix1.pyx". This includes a name change of the arguments, because in parts of Sage (eg, `ChainComplex._homology_generators_snf`) the method is called with named arguments.

I also made this change: 

```
-        if self._ncols == 0 or self._nrows == 0:
+        if ncols == 0 or nrows == 0:
```
This fixed a segfault in my tests, and also seems to make more sense that the original: one returns an uninitialized matrix if *it* is empty, not if *self* is empty.

Caveat: I have no detailed understanding of m4rie, someone knowledgeable might want to have a look at my changes.
