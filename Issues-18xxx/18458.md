As I promised in the discussion of #18211,
we have made a new release of LattE, which gives an nonzero exit code on errors (this was a regression).

The package should be upgraded (tar can be found at https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~latte/software/packages/latte_current/).

Rename the tar from "latte-int-1.7.3.tar.gz" to "latte_int-1.7.3.tar.gz" and put that in upstream.

I suppose the code of sage.geometry.polyhedron.Polyhedron_ZZ::ehrhart_polynomial which worked around this could now be cleaned up.

I also note that the spkg-check of the current latte_int spkg fails. 

I think this is because the latte_int package, whose upstream tarball is called latte-int-VERSION.tar.gz unpacks to a directory called latte-int-VERSION; but sage-spkg seems to expect the source in latte_int-VERSION.

The working directory is not  `local/var/tmp/sage/build/latte_int-1.7.3/src`, but 
`local/var/tmp/sage/build/latte_int-1.7.3/latte-int-1.7.3`, which is probably due to that `latte-int` vs `latte_int` thing... 

The fix is on its way.
