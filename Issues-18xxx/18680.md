Assignee: sage-combinat

CC:  gmoose05 @egunawan vichitk1

Keywords: Q-systems, Q-system, days78, days82

We implement Q-systems for Cartan types expressed in terms of fundamental monomials (i.e., using the variables Q<sub>1</sub><sup>(a)</sup>, where `a` ranges over the index set).


Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18680

FYI (mostly for my own record keeping) - There's also a very prelimiary branch for T-systems on the branch `u/tscrim/t_systems`.

Currently this is almost ready, just needs some documentation and a few other doctests.

I fixed the documentations issue(s) and removed the comment since I don't plan on implementing T-systems in the near future. I also tweaked the unicode output slightly to make it more readable. In fact, those small upper/lower numbers are the super/subscript numbers for the unicode output. If these changes are good with you, then you can set a positive review.
