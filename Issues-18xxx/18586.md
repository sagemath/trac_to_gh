When calling `cartesian_product` (functorial construction), keyword arguments should be passed on to the class constructor of `CartesianProduct`. This will allow to use classes inherited from sets.cartesian_product.CartesianProduct to use these keywords as an input. Additionally it will be possible to add an extra category (to the determined one; instead of only specifying the exact category of the newly created cartesian product)

This ticket arises from #18223; existing code there is partially used here (since the solution there will not be used the usable parts was factored out)

Hello,

Your change to `sets_cat.py` looks good to me. But what is the point of the ignored `flatten` argument and the forbidden `kwargs` in `cartesian_product.py`??

It was already there before...I think the idea is that at some point in future, a cartesian product of cartesian products can be flattened, so that this results in a non-nested form of the cartesian product.

Would it hurt to remove it? What about the `kwargs` that you added?

They are not used in `sets.cartesian_product.CartesianProduct` but can be used in a derived class (e.g. #18223).

Why not adding it in #18223 then? With this ticket we end up with two arguments that are for future use. It is not an improvement.

The changes here in this ticket are the only changes that are needed in `sets.cartesian_product.CartesianProduct`. This here is general enough to be used in various derived classes; it does not have any relation to the content/topic of #18223. Thus separating it and making it its own ticket makes the changes clearer (so that not (silently) a new flag in the general class is introduced).

Since no comments for a couple of weeks; I'll mark this ticket as "won't fix" and change the description of #18223 so that it will be clear that the changes here are included (since needed there).
