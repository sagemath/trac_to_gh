Rather than defining libraries in `module_list.py` or in `.pyx` files, we should add them to the `.pxd` files where the declarations are.

In this branch, we do this as proof-of-concept for `pari` and `gmp`. Other tickets can be opened later for other libraries. We still leave the libraries explicitly in `module_list.py` when needed as dependency of another library, for example `mpfr` depends on `gmp`.

One annoying part is that the order of libraries is not defined, so we need to manually re-order them using one global library order. Since the order of libraries currently specified in `src/module_list.py` is far from a DAG, many extensions will be compiled with a different library order than before.

To clean up, we also remove the explicit mention of `stdc++` for `c++` code (which is automatically added anyway).

---

These are all modules where the list of libraries was actually changed:

These were probably underlinked before:
* `sage/rings/polynomial/pbori`: added `gmp`
* `sage/rings/real_arb` (optional): added `gmp`

These use inline functions or macros of libraries but don't use exported functions. So they don't need to link to the library, but it's added anyway:
* `sage/rings/rational`: added `pari`
* `sage/rings/padics/common_conversion`: added `pari`

Modules using the Sage/PARI interface but not directly using PARI will now link against `pari`. Strictly speaking, this is a bug but it's hard to avoid:
* `sage/rings/padics/padic_capped_absolute_element`: added `pari`
* `sage/rings/padics/padic_capped_relative_element`: added `pari`
* `sage/rings/padics/padic_fixed_mod_element`: added `pari`
* `sage/rings/real_double`: added `pari`

This branch adds `gmp` for all modules where bitsets are used. Some bitset functions require GMP, others do not. These modules were only using the ones not implemented using GMP:
* `sage/combinat/debruijn_sequence`: added `gmp`
* `sage/combinat/words/word_char`: added `gmp`
* `sage/graphs/base/static_sparse_backend`: added `gmp`
* `sage/graphs/weakly_chordal`: added `gmp`

Unused libraries are removed:
* `sage/graphs/graph_generators_pyx`: removed `gmp`
* `sage/groups/semimonomial_transformations/semimonomial_transformation`: removed `gmp`
* `sage/modular/modsym/p1list`: removed `gmp`
* `sage/modules/vector_mod2_dense`: removed `gmp`

We need 1 patch to upstream Cython to fix dependency handling:

+Rather than defining libraries in \`module_list.py\` or in \`.pyx\` files, we should add them to the \`.pxd\` files where the declarations are.
 
+In this branch, we do this as proof-of-concept for \`pari\` and \`gmp\`. Other tickets can be opened later for other libraries. We still leave the libraries explicitly in \`module_list.py\` when needed as dependency of another library, for example \`mpfr\` depends on \`gmp\`.
+
+One annoying part is that the order of libraries is not defined, so we need to manually re-order them using one global library order. Since the order of libraries currently specified in \`src/module_list.py\` is far from a DAG, many extensions will be compiled with a different library order than before.
+
+To clean up, we also remove the explicit mention of \`stdc++\` for \`c++\` code (which is automatically added anyway).
+
+---
+
+These are all modules where the list of libraries was actually changed:
+
+These were probably underlinked before:
+* \`sage/rings/polynomial/pbori\`: added \`gmp\`
+* \`sage/rings/real_arb\` (optional): added \`gmp\`
+
+These use inline functions or macros of libraries but don't use exported functions. So they don't need to link to the library, but it's added anyway:
+* \`sage/rings/rational\`: added \`pari\`
+* \`sage/rings/padics/common_conversion\`: added \`pari\`
+
+Modules using the Sage/PARI interface but not directly using PARI will now link against \`pari\`. Strictly speaking, this is a bug but it's hard to avoid:
+* \`sage/rings/padics/padic_capped_absolute_element\`: added \`pari\`
+* \`sage/rings/padics/padic_capped_relative_element\`: added \`pari\`
+* \`sage/rings/padics/padic_fixed_mod_element\`: added \`pari\`
+* \`sage/rings/real_double\`: added \`pari\`
+
+This branch adds \`gmp\` for all modules where bitsets are used. Some bitset functions require GMP, others do not. These modules were only using the ones not implemented using GMP:
+* \`sage/combinat/debruijn_sequence\`: added \`gmp\`
+* \`sage/combinat/words/word_char\`: added \`gmp\`
+* \`sage/graphs/base/static_sparse_backend\`: added \`gmp\`
+* \`sage/graphs/weakly_chordal\`: added \`gmp\`
+
+Unused libraries are removed:
+* \`sage/combinat/partitions\`: removed \`gmp\` and \`mpfr\`
+* \`sage/graphs/graph_generators_pyx\`: removed \`gmp\`
+* \`sage/groups/semimonomial_transformations/semimonomial_transformation\`: removed \`gmp\`
+* \`sage/modular/modsym/p1list\`: removed \`gmp\`
+* \`sage/modules/vector_mod2_dense\`: removed \`gmp\`

+
+We need 2 patches to upstream Cython to fix dependency handling:

+* [https://github.com/cython/cython/pull/392](https://github.com/cython/cython/pull/392) (upstream doesn't like it)
