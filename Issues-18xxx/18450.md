Rather than defining libraries in `module_list.py` or in `.pyx` files, we should add them to the `.pxd` files where the declarations are.

In this branch, we do this as proof-of-concept for `pari` and `gmp`. Other tickets can be opened later for other libraries. We still leave the libraries explicitly in `module_list.py` when needed as dependency of another library, for example `mpfr` depends on `gmp`.

One annoying part is that the order of libraries is not defined, so we need to manually re-order them using one global library order. Since the order of libraries currently specified in `src/module_list.py` is far from a DAG, many extensions will be compiled with a different library order than before.

To clean up, we also remove the explicit mention of `stdc++` for `c++` code (which is automatically added anyway).

---

These are all modules where the list of libraries was actually changed:

These were probably underlinked before:
* `sage/rings/polynomial/pbori`: added `gmp`
* `sage/rings/real_arb` (optional): added `gmp`

These use inline functions or macros of libraries but don't use exported functions. So they don't need to link to the library, but it's added anyway:
* `sage/rings/rational`: added `pari`
* `sage/rings/padics/common_conversion`: added `pari`

Modules using the Sage/PARI interface but not directly using PARI will now link against `pari`. Strictly speaking, this is a bug but it's hard to avoid:
* `sage/rings/padics/padic_capped_absolute_element`: added `pari`
* `sage/rings/padics/padic_capped_relative_element`: added `pari`
* `sage/rings/padics/padic_fixed_mod_element`: added `pari`
* `sage/rings/real_double`: added `pari`

This branch adds `gmp` for all modules where bitsets are used. Some bitset functions require GMP, others do not. These modules were only using the ones not implemented using GMP:
* `sage/combinat/debruijn_sequence`: added `gmp`
* `sage/combinat/words/word_char`: added `gmp`
* `sage/graphs/base/static_sparse_backend`: added `gmp`
* `sage/graphs/weakly_chordal`: added `gmp`

Unused libraries are removed:
* `sage/graphs/graph_generators_pyx`: removed `gmp`
* `sage/groups/semimonomial_transformations/semimonomial_transformation`: removed `gmp`
* `sage/modular/modsym/p1list`: removed `gmp`
* `sage/modules/vector_mod2_dense`: removed `gmp`

We need 1 patch to upstream Cython to fix dependency handling:

 Rather than defining libraries in `module_list.py` or in `.pyx` files, we should add them to the `.pxd` files where the declarations are.

+In this branch, we do this as proof-of-concept for `pari` and `gmp`. Other tickets can be opened later for other libraries. We still leave the libraries explicitly in `module_list.py` when needed as dependency of another library, for example `mpfr` depends on `gmp`.
 
 One annoying part is that the order of libraries is not defined, so we need to manually re-order them using one global library order. Since the order of libraries currently specified in `src/module_list.py` is far from a DAG, many extensions will be compiled with a different library order than before.
