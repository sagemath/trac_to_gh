When trying to feed Sage a new `pynac...tar.xz` I get:

```
Setting up build directory for pynac-0.3.5
tar: Archive is compressed. Use -J option
tar: Error is not recoverable: exiting now
Error: failed to extract /home/ralf/sage/upstream/pynac-0.3.5.tar.xz
```
The difference in compression is significant:

```
gcc-7.2.0.tar.gz   107 MB
gcc-7.2.0-tar.xz    59.4 MB
```
Example tarball: ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/unix/languages/gcc/releases/gcc-7.2.0/gcc-7.2.0.tar.xz

**Note**: if you actually want to use `.xz` tarballs, you must add `| xz` as dependency of your package!
