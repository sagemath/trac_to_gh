Real intervals are missing truncation functions:
- `frac`
- `trunc`
- `round`
- `unique_sign`
- `unique_trunc`

We also add some more documentation to truncation methods.

The `frac()` of an interval is not the same as

```
self.parent()(self.lower().frac(), self.upper().frac())

For example, the `frac()` of `RIF(6,7)` should be the whole interval `RIF(0,1)`.

```

For `frac()`, you should check specifically if `-1` or `1` should be contained in the result:

- if the interval `]a,b]` contains a positive integer (check if `floor(b) > max(a,0)`): `frac()` must contain `[0,1]`
- if the interval `[a,b[` contains a negative integer (check if `ceil(a) < min(b,0)`): `frac()` must contain `[-1,0]`

If you add the `frac()` of the endpoints, you should get everything.

Of course. This was completely wrong! Thanks.

Add some comments like I wrote in [comment:6]. I would also like to see doctests where one endpoint is an integer:

sage: RIF(0.5, 1).frac()
