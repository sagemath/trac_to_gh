In QQbar, there are currently many operations that involve recursive calls. For example, this rather simple example gives an error because the Python stack gets filled:

```
sage: a = QQbar.zeta(1009)
sage: p = cyclotomic_polynomial(1009)
sage: b = p(a)
sage: b
0.?e-12 + 0.?e-12*I
sage: b == 0
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded
```

In this ticket:
- introduce a new (one variable) polynomial descriptor
- we make sum and product be n-ary operators instead of binary
- we remove all recursive call to become depth first search

The current behavior prevents avoiding lazy fields (RLF and CLF) for number field embeddings (see e.g. #18103).

<div id="comment:2" align="right">comment:2</div>

In `exactify` there is a bit of code which adjusts the recursion limit, increasing it by 10 for every recursive call so it will never be reached. It was introduced in [42b0fb3](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/42b0fb3d75cf0967592d2ffdc731a8a610659b59) to address #2638. I guess we could use the same for `_interval_fast` as well.

On the other hand, we could also try addressing the source of this deep recursion. The way I see it, that's because addition is left associative, so that cyclotomic polynomial will be a very deep but thin binary tree. If we had a representation which describes a sum (and perhaps also a product) of an arbitrary number of algebraic numbers using a single descriptor, the data structure would become much more shallow.

As a third solution, we might set up our own evaluation machinery for these trees, with our own stack instead of Python recursion. I haven't yet worked out all the details, but if this sounds interesting I might write some code to see how this approach feels.

The way I see it, since the backtrace is about `_interval_fast` and `_more_precision`, all of this is happening before exact computation is triggered, right? Do we have any way to find out that exact computation might in this case be faster than repeated numeric refinement? I fear we have no way to detect this, but if someone has an idea, please share it.

Looks like a good idea to have a polynomial descriptor for one (or several?) algebraic numbers. It might even be used to get faster and more precise interval evaluations.

Looks reasonable to do it without recursion. We might obtain a good speed up.

Right!

Do you find reasonable to open two tickets:
- one for polynomial descriptor in one variable
- one for evaluation without recursion
