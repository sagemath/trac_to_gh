The operation `_mul_trunc` on polynomials is currently only implemented in specialized classes with custom declaration. We define a global one in Polynomial with signature

```
class Polynomial:
    cpdef Polynomial _mul_trunc_(self, Polynomial right, long n)
```
(and deprecate the former _mul_trunc).

We also add specialized implentation for integer polynomials (relying on `fmpz_poly_mullow`) and rational polynomials (relying on `fmpq_poly_mullow`).

Such method would be really helpful for multiplication of power series.
