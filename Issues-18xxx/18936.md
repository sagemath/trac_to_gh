The current code for plotting a ~~ranked~~ poset doesn't check if the argument heights is None before creating its own heights dictionary. It then passes this dictionary to the Graph plotting function, which throws "TypeError: plot() got multiple values for keyword argument 'heights'".

What I originally set out to do was plot the subgroup lattice of a group so that subgroups of the same order are at the same height. So, I created the subgroup poset and tried passing the appropriate height dictionary and came across the error this ticket is about.

Of course, having fixed this problem, things still don't turn out so nicely since, for instance,

```
P = Poset([[1,2,3,4],[5],[5],[5],[5],[]])
heights = {1:[0], 2:[1,2,3], 3:[4], 4:[5]}
P.plot(heights=heights)
```

gives a plot where the arrow from 0 to 4 goes through 2 and the arrow from 2 to 5 goes through 4, so it looks like 0<2<4<5. Is there a way to get it to plot this better?

The whole plot and (re)labeling is a mess. For example with this patch

```
P = Poset({0: [1,2], 1:[3]})
P = P.relabel(lambda x: chr(ord('a')+x))
heights = {1 : [0], 2 : [1], 3 : [2, 3]}
P.plot(heights=heights)
```

gives `KeyError: 'a'`.

I don't know about that.

Contrary to what I said I am now running tests *without* `dot2tex`. After this is done I should have time to installa `dot2tex` and run long tests on `posets/*` and all short tests. To me it is enought testing.

I think that you can put this to needs_review. Then I'll mark this as positive_review, assuming the tests succeeded.
