Using

* Sage 6.7
* Sun Blade 2000 with a 1200 MHz UltraSPARC III+ CPU
* gcc 4.9.2

I get a build failure on Solaris SPARC when building zeromq 4.0.5.

The following code, which is line 87 in atomic_counter.hpp  

```
integer_t new_value = atomic_add_32_nv (&value, increment_); 
```

fails to compile on the SPARC processor with gcc 4.9.2. A larger section of the code (lines 79 to 100), showing the problem is below. 

```

       //  Atomic addition. Returns the old value.

  inline integer_t add (integer_t increment_){
    integer_t old_value;

#if defined ZMQ_ATOMIC_COUNTER_WINDOWS

  old_value = InterlockedExchangeAdd ((LONG*) &value, increment_);

#elif defined ZMQ_ATOMIC_COUNTER_ATOMIC_H

  integer_t new_value = atomic_add_32_nv (&value, increment_); // BREAKS ON SOLARIS
  old_value = new_value - increment_;

#elif defined ZMQ_ATOMIC_COUNTER_TILE

  old_value = arch_atomic_add (&value, increment_);

#elif defined ZMQ_ATOMIC_COUNTER_X86

  __asm__ volatile (
    "lock; xadd %0, %1 \n\t": "=r" (old_value), "=m" (value): "0" (increment_), "m" (value): "cc", "memory");

#elif defined ZMQ_ATOMIC_COUNTER_ARM

  integer_t flag, tmp;__asm__ volatile (
    "       dmb     sy\n\t"
```

I am not a C++ programmer, but it looks like there is assembly code that is assembled on x86 and ARM processors, but that C++ line is compiled only on other processors, which might explain why this error has not been noticed before. Perhaps it was tested, but on an older gcc which did not indicate any error. Temporarily defining ZMQ_ATOMIC_COUNTER_ATOMIC_H on an x86 CPU should cause the compiler to attempt to compile the code. 

I **think** the problem is that "value" is declared on line 176 as volatile

```
        volatile integer_t value;
```

but the definition for the function atomic_add_32_nv() on Solaris 10 in the header file /usr/include/atomic.h has no "volatile" there. This is the prototype for atomic_add_32_nv().

```
extern uint32_t atomic_add_32_nv(uint32_t *target, int32_t delta);
```

As I wrote, I am not a C++ programmer, but I'm slightly confused that "value" appears to be defined later in the code than where the error is occurring, but this might be a C++ feature I am not familiar with.

GCC is also reporting a similar error on line 130, which is. 

```
            integer_t nv = atomic_add_32_nv (&value, delta);
```
