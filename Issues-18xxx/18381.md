Just a grammatical suggestion, instead of

```
raise ValueError("{} seems not be a subring of the "
                 "real or complex numbers".format(R))

could we have

Why would you like to make cholesky work only for sparse matrices. The following works fine

```
sage: m=matrix(ZZ,[[2,1],[1,2]],sparse=True)
sage: m.cholesky()

Of course the output should always be dense but it makes sense for the input to either be sparse or dense.

dense RDF input works:

```
sage: m=matrix(RDF,[[2,1],[1,2]])
sage: m.cholesky()
[1.4142135623730951                0.0]

the reality is that while Sage does have code that can do Cholesky of sparse RDF matrices, and even of sparse CDF matrices (hidden in CVXOPT, that packages suitesparse with its cholmod), it just needs to be exposed the way numpy dense matrices are exposed. 

Anyhow, the error message  is wrong, it should say that either the matrix should be dense over  RDF, or sparse/dense over an exact field.
