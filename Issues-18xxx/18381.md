the reality is that while Sage does have code that can do Cholesky of sparse RDF matrices, and even of sparse CDF matrices (hidden in CVXOPT, that packages suitesparse with its cholmod), it just needs to be exposed the way numpy dense matrices are exposed. 

Anyhow, the error message  is wrong, it should say that either the matrix should be dense over  RDF, or sparse/dense over an exact field.
