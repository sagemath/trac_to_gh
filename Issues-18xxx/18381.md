Currently, given a rational matrix the answer of the cholesky decomposition has base ring `QQbar` and not `AA`. This can lead to troubles when someone asks for a floating point approximation since `QQbar` does some exactification to be sure that the imaginary part is zero!

Just a grammatical suggestion, instead of

```
raise ValueError("{} seems not be a subring of the "
                 "real or complex numbers".format(R))

could we have

```

the reality is that while Sage does have code that can do Cholesky of sparse RDF matrices, and even of sparse CDF matrices (hidden in CVXOPT, that packages suitesparse with its cholmod), it just needs to be exposed the way numpy dense matrices are exposed. 

Anyhow, the error message  is wrong, it should say that either the matrix should be dense over  RDF, or sparse/dense over an exact field.

suitesparse has amd (also packages in cvxopt) to get a kind of reordering you are talking about. Anyway it is a secondary question how to compute Cholesky, or perhaps a more general factorisation involving a permutation/reording, of a sparse [R,C]DF-matrix. It's more important to fix a backend for computations with sparse [R,C]DF-matrices.
