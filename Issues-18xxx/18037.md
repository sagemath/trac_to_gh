For a while, `interrupt_after_delay()` was the recommended way to test interrupts. However, since alarms are also handled the same way by Sage, it's better to use `alarm()`.

I have kept `interrupt_after_delay()` in `ecl.pyx` since that tests an ECL handler, which apparently doesn't support `SIGALRM`.
