sage: mathematica(1)
```
hangs indefinitely if `Mathematica` is not installed.

The reason is that internally the script `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/math-readline` is called by `Expect()`, and the latter hangs. This script should check whether the `math` command has finished: currently the `math-readline` script keeps running even after the subprocess has exited.

moving the discussion from the closed #16703 here.
I propose the patch in the attached `public/18908` branch.
I don't have a system with mathematica installed, I only tested it works nicely without `math` present, both stand-alone and as well as producing the right result when calling `mathematica(10)` from Sage.

works for me with Mathematica 9, I don't seem to have Mathematica 10 though.

I have `Mathematica 10.0 for Linux x86 (64-bit)` installed on my machine. I installed the branch. I did make start (I think sage -b does not update the script right?). And it seems to work:

```
sage: mathematica(10)
10
```

To make sure that the new code was really tested after the make start, I added some print:

```

 try:
```

did make start, run sage, but then, I still get

```

So is the new code really run? Is it okay if the print are not shown?

sage:

I am setting it back to positive review. Please feel free to submit a proper error report, not "wrong fix" bullsh*t, and then change the ticket status accordingly.

If I understand correctly what is being said by [jdemeyer](#comment:21) the problem is this:

```
$ math-readline
Mathematica 10.0 for Linux x86 (64-bit)
Copyright 1988-2014 Wolfram Research, Inc.

In[1]:= Exit

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/opt/sage/local/bin/math-readline", line 23, in <module>

IOError: [Errno 32] Broken pipe
```

which is quite ugly.

But it was really incorrect: the fact that the script hangs when `math` is not installed was a *symptom* of the problem, not the problem itself.

But at the time when I send that message, I didn't have a clear explanation of the real problem: I knew that the proposed solution was wrong, but I couldn't yet say what the right fix would be. Like I said: it's often easier to explain *after* you have a working patch.

And I had to act quickly because, these days, tickets which have positive_review are often closed very soon.

Anyhow, this is not the point; the point is that you should not brand anything at all "wrong", "incorrect" without a justification. (Unless you out to annoy people, and I hope that this is not the case).
