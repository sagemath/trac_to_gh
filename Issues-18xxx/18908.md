sage: mathematica(1)
```
hangs indefinitely if `Mathematica` is not installed.

The reason is that internally the script `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/math-readline` is called by `Expect()`, and the latter hangs. This script should check whether the `math` command has finished: currently the `math-readline` script keeps running even after the subprocess has exited.

<a id='comment:2'></a>moving the discussion from the closed #16703 here.
I propose the patch in the attached `public/18908` branch.
I don't have a system with mathematica installed, I only tested it works nicely without `math` present, both stand-alone and as well as producing the right result when calling `mathematica(10)` from Sage.

works for me with Mathematica 9, I don't seem to have Mathematica 10 though.
(well, doctests fail due to numerical noise etc, but the patch itself looks good)

But it was really incorrect: the fact that the script hangs when `math` is not installed was a *symptom* of the problem, not the problem itself.

But at the time when I send that message, I didn't have a clear explanation of the real problem: I knew that the proposed solution was wrong, but I couldn't yet say what the right fix would be. Like I said: it's often easier to explain *after* you have a working patch.

And I had to act quickly because, these days, tickets which have positive_review are often closed very soon.
