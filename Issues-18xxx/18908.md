```
sage: mathematica(1)
```
hangs indefinitely if `Mathematica` is not installed.

The reason is that internally the script `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/math-readline` is called by `Expect()`, and the latter hangs. This script should check whether the `math` command has finished: currently the `math-readline` script keeps running even after the subprocess has exited.

moving the discussion from the closed #16703 here.
I propose the patch in the attached `public/18908` branch.
I don't have a system with mathematica installed, I only tested it works nicely without `math` present, both stand-alone and as well as producing the right result when calling `mathematica(10)` from Sage.

works for me with Mathematica 9, I don't seem to have Mathematica 10 though.

Now, the hard question: where does one have the place to describe the (pseudo)package type, 
i.e. optional vs experimental?!

I have `Mathematica 10.0 for Linux x86 (64-bit)` installed on my machine. I installed the branch. I did make start (I think sage -b does not update the script right?). And it seems to work:

```
sage: mathematica(10)
10
```

To make sure that the new code was really tested after the make start, I added some print:

```

did make start, run sage, but then, I still get

```

So is the new code really run? Is it okay if the print are not shown?

No, though others have asked (Dima in particular).

You should not change the status of a ticket in `positive_review` to ask a question unrelated to what the ticket is supposed to address.

Sometimes it is easier to just write a patch and explain later rather than the other way around. And unfortunately there is no ticket status for "hang on, I'm working on a patch".

The *real* problem with the script was that, when the `math` child process exited (for whatever reason, including Mathematica not being installed), the `math-readline` script did not exit. The proper fix is to check for the exiting of the child process. This works no matter for which reason the child process exited (which could be calling `Exit` in Mathematica, which could be Mathematica crashing, which could be Mathematica not being installed).

I also made a few more fixes to the script:

2. removing the empty write `sys.stdout.write('')` (what was the point of that?).
3. using `write()` instead of `writelines()` to write a single string.
4. removing the unneeded `sys.exit()` at the end.

s/correct/complete would do; indeed, saying that something is incorrect/wrong without giving an explanation could create a tension you don't need.

But it was really incorrect: the fact that the script hangs when `math` is not installed was a *symptom* of the problem, not the problem itself.

But at the time when I send that message, I didn't have a clear explanation of the real problem: I knew that the proposed solution was wrong, but I couldn't yet say what the right fix would be. Like I said: it's often easier to explain *after* you have a working patch.

And I had to act quickly because, these days, tickets which have positive_review are often closed very soon.

except that this one did not hide a bug, at least not any more than the original scrip did.
 
Anyhow, this is not the point; the point is that you should not brand anything at all "wrong", "incorrect" without a justification. (Unless you out to annoy people, and I hope that this is not the case).
