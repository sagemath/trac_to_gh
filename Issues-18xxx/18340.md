The following will eat all your memory:

```
$ ( ulimit -s unlimited; ./sage -t --long src/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/lseries_ell.py )
```
This sets the stack size to "unlimited". The `gp` process which is executed by this doctest will then use a very large amount of memory.

This happens in particular with GNU `make` < 3.82 due to [https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?22010](https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?22010)

This can be solved by upgrading PARI/GP.

For me, on one machine it happens each time I run `make ptestlong` unless I delete `~/.sage/timings*` before doing so.  (Deleting these files "disables" the IMHO useless and rather counter-productive *sorting of doctests by previous runtime*.)

John C. reported it happened to him even with `make testlong`, i.e., without testing in parallel.

Well, whether `ulimit` works depends on the OS AFAIK.

And as I said, I do not even get a "Killed" from Sage; the doctest passes even though its child process got killed.

I haven't yet been able to reproduce this other than by running `make ptestlong`;  `./sage -tp --long --warn-long 0.0001 src/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/` for example doesn't show the behaviour even on an already loaded machine.

Vaguely thought of that already, and we indeed need (GNU) `make`, and a sufficiently old one:

```sh
echo "WARNING:  'gp' may eat up up to ~16GB with the following"
(ulimit -v 16000000; printf "all:\n\t./sage -t --long src/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/lseries_ell.py\n" | make -f -)
```

With `make` 3.81, `gp` runs amok; with `make` 4.1, everything's fine.

(We had a similar issue with ECL and/or GAP quite a while ago IIRC, and the `make` version without issues was 3.82 and later I think.)

Well, just grab some newer version (3.82, 4.0 or 4.1) from [http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/make/](http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/make/), untar it, and run `configure && make && sudo make install` (by default into `/usr/local`).

Hmmm, I'm still not sure whether it's really this.  Ubuntu apparently patched their `make`, as it does **not** touch the resource limits, while my GNU make 4.1 limits the stack size to 8MB (soft):

```sh
for make in /usr/local/bin/make /usr/bin/make; do $make --version | head -1; printf "all:\n\t: ; ulimit -sH\n\t: ; ulimit -sS\n" | $make -f -; done
GNU Make 4.1
: ; ulimit -sH
unlimited
: ; ulimit -sS
8192
GNU Make 3.81
: ; ulimit -sH
unlimited
: ; ulimit -sS
unlimited
```

Another cause could be GNU make 3.81 messing up file descriptors somehow.

What is the `ulimit -s` outside of `make`? I get

```
jdemeyer@tamiyo:~$ ulimit -s
8192
```
so if `make` changes that to `unlimited`, that's [https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?22010](https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?22010) indeed.

The fixed version of GNU `make` has been released almost 5 years ago. There is really no excuse for still using `make` 3.81. Like leif said, you can easily install that manually outside of the distro.

This is **not** floating point noise

```diff
 sage: pari('intnum(x=0,13,sin(x)+sin(x^2) + x)')
- 85.1885681951527
+ 84.1818153922297
```
The value of the integral computed with gsl is

```
sage: numerical_integral(sin(x)+sin(x^2)+x,0,13)
(85.18856819515268, 1.3572929447036586e-09)
```
So Pari was right up to 10<sup>-11</sup> and now it gets down to 10<sup>-4</sup>. This is not acceptable.

Indeed! I can confirm the behavior on the freshly compiled pari master `development 17795-d04cdd3`.

This is rather disjoint from this ticket, I opened #18342 to track the issue.

Yep, missed that:  Outside of `make`, the stack size is (already) soft-limited to 8MB, which GNU make 3.81 in the distros resets to `unlimited`.

The original bug report was actually about the opposite:  Changing it from `unlimited` to some huge value.

But the real bug is that (the old) `make` touches the resource limits of (non-`make`) subprocesses at all.

With Sage 6.7.beta3 and GCC 5.1.0 on Linux x86_64, PARI and eclib pass their test suites (Lcalc no longer has one), and ptestlong passes modulo one unrelated test (I already reported for 6.7.beta3 on sage-release).

Also

```sh
(ulimit -s unlimited; ./sage -t --long src/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/lseries_ell.py)
```
works as expected.

Haven't looked very closely at the patches though.

The changed behaviour of PARI's `intnum()` should IMHO be documented, on #18342, where also the doctest could be changed (not just its output).
