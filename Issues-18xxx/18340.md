The following will eat all your memory:

```
$ ( ulimit -s unlimited; ./sage -t --long src/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/lseries_ell.py )
```
This sets the stack size to "unlimited". The `gp` process which is executed by this doctest will then use a very large amount of memory.

This happens in particular with GNU `make` < 3.82 due to [https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?22010](https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?22010)

This can be solved by upgrading PARI/GP.

<a id='comment:6'></a>Well, whether `ulimit` works depends on the OS AFAIK.

And as I said, I do not even get a "Killed" from Sage; the doctest passes even though its child process got killed.

I haven't yet been able to reproduce this other than by running `make ptestlong`;  `./sage -tp --long --warn-long 0.0001 src/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/` for example doesn't show the behaviour even on an already loaded machine.

Vaguely thought of that already, and we indeed need (GNU) `make`, and a sufficiently old one:

```sh
echo "WARNING:  'gp' may eat up up to ~16GB with the following"
(ulimit -v 16000000; printf "all:\n\t./sage -t --long src/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/lseries_ell.py\n" | make -f -)
```

With `make` 3.81, `gp` runs amok; with `make` 4.1, everything's fine.

(We had a similar issue with ECL and/or GAP quite a while ago IIRC, and the `make` version without issues was 3.82 and later I think.)

Well, just grab some newer version (3.82, 4.0 or 4.1) from [http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/make/](http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/make/), untar it, and run `configure && make && sudo make install` (by default into `/usr/local`).

Hmmm, I'm still not sure whether it's really this.  Ubuntu apparently patched their `make`, as it does **not** touch the resource limits, while my GNU make 4.1 limits the stack size to 8MB (soft):

```sh
for make in /usr/local/bin/make /usr/bin/make; do $make --version | head -1; printf "all:\n\t: ; ulimit -sH\n\t: ; ulimit -sS\n" | $make -f -; done
GNU Make 4.1
: ; ulimit -sH
unlimited
: ; ulimit -sS
8192
GNU Make 3.81
: ; ulimit -sH
unlimited
: ; ulimit -sS
unlimited
```

Another cause could be GNU make 3.81 messing up file descriptors somehow.

What is the `ulimit -s` outside of `make`? I get

```
jdemeyer@tamiyo:~$ ulimit -s
8192
```
so if `make` changes that to `unlimited`, that's [https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?22010](https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?22010) indeed.

The fixed version of GNU `make` has been released almost 5 years ago. There is really no excuse for still using `make` 3.81. Like leif said, you can easily install that manually outside of the distro.

This is rather disjoint from this ticket, I opened #18342 to track the issue.

Yep, missed that:  Outside of `make`, the stack size is (already) soft-limited to 8MB, which GNU make 3.81 in the distros resets to `unlimited`.

The original bug report was actually about the opposite:  Changing it from `unlimited` to some huge value.

But the real bug is that (the old) `make` touches the resource limits of (non-`make`) subprocesses at all.

Also

```sh
(ulimit -s unlimited; ./sage -t --long src/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/lseries_ell.py)
```
works as expected.

Haven't looked very closely at the patches though.

The changed behaviour of PARI's `intnum()` should IMHO be documented, on #18342, where also the doctest could be changed (not just its output).

It finally finished without errors.  (This was on a Pentium4 Prescott, Ubuntu 10.04.4, FSF GCC 4.8.2 with `-O3`, native build, FWIW.)




I haven't tested building with FLTK, but it looks as if PARI's "configure" would meanwhile work.
