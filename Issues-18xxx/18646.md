I wanted to review this ticket this morning, but it is already positive review. I had one english comment. I don't understand the part "`to which they are forwarded.`" in

```
            - This method supports any parameter accepted by
              :meth:`sage.plot.graphics.Graphics.show`, to which they are
              forwarded.
```

Because arguments are forwarded *from* show *to* plot not the converse. I would replace "to which" by "from which" or better erase completely "`to which they are forwarded.`" because the user don't care much about what is forwarded where.

I let you guys decide if it is too late or not (maybe this ticket is already being merged).

Nonono. The function is `Graphics.show`, not `Graph.show`. And in particular `Graph.plot` forwards its arguments to `Graphics.show`. This is why, despite having no specific code in `Graph.plot` to handle "axis", that argument is accepted. Because `Graphics.show` knows what to make of it.

I can remove the sentence if you prefer. In the worst case, the last commit will be ignored by Volker's script.

Ok, I see what you meant. But, I still think the last commit it a good idea to avoid confusion.

So if I understand correctly, that "forward" is done indirectly in the ugly line 910 in the method `def plot(self, **kwds):` of file graph_plot.py:

```python
