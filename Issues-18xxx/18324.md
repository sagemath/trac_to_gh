4ti2 version 1.6.3 was just [released](http://www.4ti2.de/). Should update the package to get some minor build fixes and improved test-suite coverage. 
Also the manual has been updated and all examples from the manual checked; the updated manual should make it easier to support 4ti2's features in Sage.

Download the 4ti2 tarfile from http://www.4ti2.de/version_1.6.3/4ti2-1.6.3.tar.gz to
SAGEROOT/upstream, checkout the git branch and do `sage -f 4ti2` to try the new package.

Looks good to me.

I have taken the opportunity to correct a few doc details in the interface.

If you agree, you can set to positive review.
