The proposed fix mends the reported problem, and no more. However, shouldn't there be certain behaviour for the matrix constructor if it gets passed a *callable* object? or is that too broad?

I don't think so, actually. The comment itself says "callable" and then the check is for particular types, rather than checking if the thing is callable.

I would say:
- restructure, giving preference to checking the passed in argument being iterable. Possibly special-case some iterables like lists and tuples for efficiency if necessary (and if that makes a difference -- I doubt it.
- check for a callable *later*. You can check using `callable(...)`.

I don't know what we should do with objects that are both iterable and callable. I suspect that giving preference to their iterable behaviour will be best.

Small detail: do not use

# :trac:`10158`
```
in code.

Also, instead of

```
    sage: @cached_function # :trac:`18713`
```
you could write

```
Check that the matrix constructor works with any callable input (see :trac:`18713`)::

I don't understand `of_other_type`. Can you try a positive description (i.e. saying what it ''is
* instead of what it *is not''). Like `is_iterable`. And then a minor optimization: in Cython, use `cdef bint` for booleans.

Or perhaps you can get rid of `if of_other_type` completely and replace it with something like `if entries is None`.

Did you test this against something that is callable and iterable, such as a parent that is a finite set? It seems like the iterable behavior takes precedent, but it is not clear from the code that this is correct. For example, does this now work:

```
sage: R = GF(9, 'a')
sage: m = matrix(3, 3, R)
sage: m
[      0       a   a + 1]
[2*a + 1       2     2*a]
[2*a + 2   a + 2       1]
```
I would like a doctest for this.

Jeroen or Ralf, what other iterables would not (necessarily) be handled by the current branch?

It does not (same error as with develop). Should it?

Well, technically, because it is a callable. Yet, it should be treated as an iterator in this case. So since it errors out in the same way, I think it is okay for now.

Yes, any `Expression` is also a `callable` but we don't want to call it. This breaks the whole elaborate logic.
