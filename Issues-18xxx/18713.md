<a id='comment:4'></a>The proposed fix mends the reported problem, and no more. However, shouldn't there be certain behaviour for the matrix constructor if it gets passed a *callable* object? or is that too broad?

I don't think so, actually. The comment itself says "callable" and then the check is for particular types, rather than checking if the thing is callable.

I would say:
- restructure, giving preference to checking the passed in argument being iterable. Possibly special-case some iterables like lists and tuples for efficiency if necessary (and if that makes a difference -- I doubt it.
- check for a callable *later*. You can check using `callable(...)`.

I don't know what we should do with objects that are both iterable and callable. I suspect that giving preference to their iterable behaviour will be best.

Also, instead of

```

you could write

<a id='comment:20'></a>Did you test this against something that is callable and iterable, such as a parent that is a finite set? It seems like the iterable behavior takes precedent, but it is not clear from the code that this is correct. For example, does this now work:

```
sage: R = GF(9, 'a')
sage: m = matrix(3, 3, R)
sage: m
[      0       a   a + 1]
[2*a + 1       2     2*a]
[2*a + 2   a + 2       1]
```
I would like a doctest for this.

It does not (same error as with develop). Should it?
