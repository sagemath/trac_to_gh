```

On the other hand, just testing without building (`./sage -t src/sage/combinat/dyck_word.py`) yields

```
sage -t --warn-long 78.6 src/sage/combinat/dyck_word.py
    [574 tests, 0.95 s]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

It looks like a Python integer kills us directly after building sage, but not if we are just testing.

Yes indeed. Very strange. Note that in a console

```
sage: DyckWords(4r, 2r).cardinality()
9
sage: type(_)
<type 'int'>
```
which is the expected behavior after #17852.

<div id="comment:4" align="right">Comment 4</div>

Got it... it is because of unique representation! There is a cache of computed values of `DyckWords(4,2)`. Hence

```
sage: D1 = DyckWords(4r, 2r)  # init with Python int
sage: D2 = DyckWords(4, 2)    # init with Sage integer
sage: D2.cardinality()
9
sage: type(_)
<type 'int'>
```
So if the block at lines 3583-3585

```
sage: all(all(DyckWords(p, q).cardinality()
....:           == len(DyckWords(p, q).list()) for q in range(p + 1))
....:      for p in range(7))
```
is ran before the `TestSuite(DyckWords(4,2)).run()` **and** the weak cache is still present we got the failure!

Some more information: the problem **definitely** is, that `cardinality` may return a Python integer. For testing purposes, I converted the output to a sage `Integer`, and as a result building and testing works.

However, even if I delete the example at lines 3583-3585, the error remains. I haven't really figured out yet where the Python integers magically appear.

I like this to be restrictive. See also #18159. I often write things like

```
    return S1.cardinality().factorial()
```
which would break if it was a Python integer. Your suggestion implies that I need to do

```
    from sage.rings.integer_ring import ZZ
    return ZZ(S1.cardinality()).factorial()
```

Moreover, in that particular case, I dislike the behavior of the example in [comment:4](#comment%3A4). Depending on the execution you got a Python int or a Sage integer! This is very bad.

> Hence, would it not be a better solution to modify the test so that it accepts both sage and python integers (and infinity)?

This has to be discussed (maybe on #18159). And which infinity?

'Problem' meant that it is/was the reason for the failing doctest. Nevertheless, I'm also in favour of `cardinality` returning Integers. I also agree that we should change `isinstance(card, Integer)`. But I'm not sure about returning `infinity`: within the category `FiniteEnumeratedSets` I don't think that `cardinality` should return `infinity`. Or should it?

In any case, should this be still part of this ticket?

Thanks for the fix!

While you are at it, you may consider making the assertion error even more explicit:

```
expected a Sage Integer and got {} of type {}
```
->

```
.cardinality() should return an Integer, and not {} of type {}
```
I let you decide whether you want to stick this in this ticket. If you do, you can reset a positive review on my behalf after the change (and running the tests).
