This is because you do not have the new .tar.bz2 file. The spkg-src script (see the ticket's description) that this branch contains will download it for you.

Could you give a more informative error message? What happens when you run spkg-src?

> Also, I don't see a cbc page at http://www.sagemath.org/packages/upstream/


No problem here, that's because coin is an optional package. You don't see Nauty there either.

> Why not pointing directly to http://www.coin-or.org/download/source/Cbc/Cbc-2.9.4.tgz ?


Because it is not a .tar.bz2 file, and that's what I think we have to put in our upstream/ folder.

spkg-src downloads the upstream Cbc for you, transforms it a bit and stores it in upstream. Could you start this script while going in the right folder first?

The spkg-src scripts are just there to make the developer's life easier when a spkg gets udpated. You change the version number, start the script, and the .tar.bz2 file is built for you.

Once this is done, the command `sage -i cbc` will find the .tar.bz2 file.

<a id='comment:18'></a>You did a push while I was testing the stuff, so I don't know if it will change something.

After setting SAGE_ROOT in .bash_profile :

So it is working this way, but it was not working when trying first `sage -i cbc`. Don't know why.

What should I do next?

I added a warning to say something more useful when SAGE_ROOT is not defined. This block of 4 lines can be found in most `spkg-install` scripts that Sage ships.

> So it is working this way, but it was not working when trying first `sage -i cbc`. Don't know why.


New-style spkg work this way: ideally we have in upstream/ the copy of the source files, as given by the original authors of the software. Then, in build/pkgs we have some scripts to install it as it should in Sage.

As the sources were not available on your computer (and obviously not on Sage's server either, as the version we have here is more recent) the spkg-src script downloaded it from Coin's website and created the upstream/ archive. Then, with `sage -i cbc` you called the scripts from `build/pkgs/`, which used the new .tar.bz2 file.

> What should I do next?


Well, now you apparently have Cbc on your computer. So you can solve LP with it, check that tests pass when you add `--optional=sage,coin` to `sage -t`.

The `spkg-install` file is a pure copy of what the spkg already contains.

Because I believe that we need .tar.bz2 files in upstream. There is no other reason.

I don't mind. I will remove it in a second and set the patch to `needs_review` again, waiting for your answer about the first two points.

In general applying patches is a good idea, but here we are patching an automatically generated file. I believe that it is safer to change it with a sed command (which just replaces some text with another one), as we would otherwise have to change the patch files (using the sed comand) whenever it changes.

> - concerning the second point, tar.gz files are also accepted and `spkg-src` should be avoided as possible, you can have a look at : http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/packaging.html#modified-tarballs

I think this is because you did not update `checksums.ini`.

The installation works fine, but then, when i do `sage -b`, i got : 

```
...
building 'sage.numerical.backends.coin_backend' extension
Executing 1 command (using 1 thread)
error: [Errno 13] Permission denied
```

Do you know what could be wrong ?

No idea. What is the line that raises that? Are you the user with writing permissions on SAGE_ROOT and its subdirectories?
