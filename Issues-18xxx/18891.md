```
This is because jmol is not installed by default:

```
$ ll /home/vbraun/Code/sage.git/local/share/jmol/JmolData.jar
ls: cannot access /home/vbraun/Code/sage.git/local/share/jmol/JmolData.jar: No such file or directory
```
Installing jmol manually fixes it

I don't see how the wrong dependency of `$(STARTED)` could cause jmol to be not installed. So I guess there must be something different going on here.

Also, the dependencies of `$(STARTED)` would only play a role if you explicitly execute `make start`, not when doing just `make`.
