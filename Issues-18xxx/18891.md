Error: Unable to access jarfile /home/vbraun/Code/sage.git/local/share/jmol/JmolData.jar
```
This is because jmol is not installed by default:

```
$ ll /home/vbraun/Code/sage.git/local/share/jmol/JmolData.jar
ls: cannot access /home/vbraun/Code/sage.git/local/share/jmol/JmolData.jar: No such file or directory
```
Installing jmol manually fixes it
