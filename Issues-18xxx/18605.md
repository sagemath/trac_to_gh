The efficiency of the internal function `_fundamental_`cocircuit is far better than that of its dual `_fundamental_`circuit for BinaryMatroid, TernaryMatroid, and QuaternaryMatroid, due to the way these matroids are represented internally. The parent class BasesExchangeMatroid does not assume or use this asymmetry. As a result  there is a substantial difference between between the efficiency of dual operations such as closure and coclosure, and indirectly is_simple and is_cosimple, etc.

Override _coclosure for BinaryMatroid, TernaryMatroid, and QuaternaryMatroid by a function that exploits the asymmetry by calling `_fundamental_`cocircuit rather than `_fundamental_`circuit.

Without this patch coclosure is far slower than closure on a BinaryMatroid:

```
sage: A =MatrixSpace(GF(2), 500,1000).random_element()
sage: M=Matroid(A)
sage: timeit("M.closure([0])")
625 loops, best of 3: 25 µs per loop
sage: timeit("M.coclosure([0])")
125 loops, best of 3: 4.06 ms per loop
```
With the patch, coclosure actually beats closure:

```
sage: A =MatrixSpace(GF(2), 500,1000).random_element()
sage: M=Matroid(A)
sage: timeit("M.closure([0])")
625 loops, best of 3: 25.1 µs per loop
sage: timeit("M.coclosure([0])")
625 loops, best of 3: 14.7 µs per loop
```
For correctness of the patch I tried:

```
sage: for i in range(10000):
    A =MatrixSpace(GF(2), 5,2000).random_element()
    M = Matroid(A)
    if M.closure([0]) != M.dual().coclosure([0]):
        print '!!'
```
That worked out fine.

Needs review!

Thanks, this is much faster!
