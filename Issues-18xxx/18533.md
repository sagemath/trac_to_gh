Looks good to me. I have installed, run the testsuite, and looked at the diff.

Should I set a positive review, or do you hope for a more thorough discussion ?

I'm not sure where to post this, but note that if the tar file fails to download, the log file is not formatted correctly, so Sage doesn't report which package failed to build. From the end of `install.log`:

```
Error building Sage.

The following package(s) may have failed to build:

The build directory may contain configuration files and other potentially
helpful information. WARNING: if you now run 'make' again, the build
directory will, by default, be deleted. Set the environment variable
SAGE_KEEP_BUILT_SPKGS to 'yes' to prevent this.
```
From the end of `ccache-3.2.2.log`:

```
[xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx]

This is presumably not specific to ccache. Does it belong on a brand-new ticket, or  #18710, or somewhere else?
