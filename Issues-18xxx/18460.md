The patch ipasses all tests on `bliss.pyx` and `generic_graph.py`, before and after installing bliss.
Should I do something special to ensure that optional tests are executed?

Why are you removing isomorphism test with bliss?

The option is "--optional=sage,bliss"

> Why are you removing isomorphism test with bliss?


Well, because there is no `is_isomophic` function in the 'bliss' module. There use to be one, in th preliminary phases of the branch that added support for bliss, but it was never available in a release.

For me the patch is good to go (install, test, doc, etc.).

One remark: it could be good practice to indicate in the ticket the optional parameters to do the tests.
