Apparently `@interact` doesn't work in the Sage 6.7 IPython notebook. The following prints a bunch of HTML code, apparently describing the slider controls:

```
@interact
def f(t=(-1,1)):
  print(t)
```

It would be nice if this could be made to work. If getting there is going to take a bit longer, then it would be nice to see a explanatory message instead of that HTML output.

I'm a bit surprised I don't see a ticket for this yet, but [my search](http://trac.sagemath.org/query?status=needs_info&status=needs_review&status=needs_work&status=new&status=positive_review&component=notebook&summary=~interact&or&status=needs_info&status=needs_review&status=needs_work&status=new&status=positive_review&keywords=~ipython&component=interact&col=id&col=summary&col=status&col=type&col=priority&col=milestone&col=component&order=priority) didn't turn up any likely candidates so far.

Keywords: **ipython interact**

Component: **notebook**
