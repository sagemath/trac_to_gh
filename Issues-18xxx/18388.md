Instead of storing the tuple `(i,u,v)` as a tuple, it would be a lot better and simpler to store it as 3 different attributes.

We also fix comparison to use `_cmp_` (which is required for extension types) instead of `__cmp__`.

<a id='comment:5'></a>Very minor point, but you could do the alignment:

```diff
