As reported in [this question on ask](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/26283/computing-minimum_distance-of-a-code-on-non-prime-fields-fails-sometimes) we have a problem with our finite fields and GAP

```
sage: K = GF(16,'a')
sage: a = K.gen()
sage: b = a**2 + a
sage: K(b._gap_())
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: unable to coerce from a finite field other than the prime subfield
```

Strangely, it works with `GF(8)`.

Notes:
- Before this patch, it was implicitly assumed that non-prime finite fields are defined by Conway polynomials, because this is how GAP represents finite fields.  This is now an explicit requirement.
- Elements of a GAP prime field `Z(p)` are now converted into a Sage `FiniteField(p)`, as opposed to `IntegerModRing(p)`.

Hello,

That's wonderful that you did have a look! I put this to positive review as it fixes an important bug (and might hopefully be in sage-6.6).

On a related note, the code uses a lot of string parsing. This is ugly and not very safe. I think that we can get rid of most of it with
- `Characteristic(z)`: the characteristic of the field
- `DegreeFFE(z)`: degree of the smallest base field containing the element `z`
- `LogFFE(z,base)`: logarithm in finite field
I do not like the fact that we need to call `LogFFE` to have access to the good power of the generator. If you think about a good solution for that I will open an other ticket.

Vincent
