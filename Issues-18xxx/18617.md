Right now, there is a method `hamming_weight` to compute the number of nonzero coefficients of a polynomial. The goal of this ticket is two-fold:

1. Rename this method into `number_of_terms`: I think the name `hamming_weight` is not excessively standard for this function, thus the function may be unknown form many users. My conviction is comes in part from several discussions I have been involved in where no one seem to know of the existence of this method.

2. Implement a specialized version for sparse polynomials, in the spirit of #18518, #18585, #18600, which is much faster:

```python
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(ZZ,sparse=True)
sage: p = R.random_element(10000)
sage: %timeit p.number_of_terms() # new code
The slowest run took 44.58 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
1000000 loops, best of 3: 203 ns per loop
sage: %timeit Polynomial.number_of_terms(p) # old code
100 loops, best of 3: 2.77 ms per loop
```

*Note.* While I decided to group several modifications for sparse polynomials in a single ticket #18600, I prefer keeping this change in a separate ticket since it involves a deprecation that might be controversial (though I do not expect it will be the case).

Sparse polynomial people sometimes call this number the "sparsity" of the polynomial. Perhaps we'll get an opinion from Clément Pernet (cc'ed). I think "weight" also makes a lot of sense though (and is better than "Hamming weight").

My feeling is that "sparsity" should be a ratio (number of non-zero terms divided by number of terms), different from weight.

All your examples are for polynomials over `GF(2)`! (For 1., this is specified in the docstring: <code>Only implemented for \`p = 2\`</code>.) I agree that in this special case, the term "weight" may be quite common, but my impression is that it is pretty rare for other base rings.

Other possibilities, in different communities, include "sparsity" (for instance in the complexity theory community) or "0-norm". Yet, I guess the name "number_of_terms" is the one most people will find by "tab exploration". 

Note that I have nothing against creating aliases, for "weight", "sparsity", and maybe to change the `norm` method to make it return the number of terms (rather than an Exception) when its argument is 0.

As I wrote above, some people indeed use "sparsity" but I have also quite often encountered a similar reaction to yours that "sparsity" evokes a ratio. So it has the risk to be misleading.

There is no fundamental reason to restrict to `GF(2)`. I think that "weight" is simply *used* more rarely for other rings besides `GF(2)`. This is for two reasons:
1. a "random" polynomial over `GF(2)` has a low weight (half the degree), while a "random" polynomial over most rings has weight equal to the degree. Thus, finding polynomials with small weight satisfying some property is easiest over `GF(2)`.
2. in computer algebra it often makes sense to specialize algorithms for `GF(2)`.

I agree with that, my only point is to know whether people actually use the different possible names. 

With a search on Google for "polynomial weight", most results are about polynomials over `GF(2)`, the few others concern more generally polynomials over `GF(q)`. And furthermore, the thematic of the papers are either irreducibility of polynomials or polynomials related to error-correcting codes.

With a search for "polynomial sparsity", most papers are complexity theory paper on learning polynomials. 

All I say is that though "weight" may be standard in some domains, it is not in other ones. That's why I prefer "number of terms" that I expect to be clear for everyone.

In the docstring for `number_of_terms`, mention with an example that `hamming_weight` is an alias. Something like

```
The method :meth:`hamming_weight` is an alias::

    sage: bla.hamming_weight()
    42
```
