```
Currently we have the following in Sage:

```
sage: C = CombinatorialFreeModule(QQ, ['a','b'])
sage: C(0) + ZZ(0)
0
sage: C(0) + QQ(0)
TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for '+': 'Free module generated by {'a', 'b'} over Rational Field' and 'Rational Field'
```
and also

```
sage: C = CombinatorialFreeModule(QQ, ['a','b'])
sage: C.zero() == ZZ(0)
True
sage: C.zero() == QQ(0)
False
```

The problem is that there is no coercion `QQ -> C`. The coercion model special-cases `ZZ(0)` but not other kinds of zero.

Depends on #21128

Part of the problem is that there is no coercion defined anyway:

```
sage: C = CombinatorialFreeModule(QQ, ['a','b'])
sage: C.coerce(QQ(0))
TypeError: no canonical coercion from Rational Field to Free module generated by {'a', 'b'} over Rational Field
```

This makes sense, but it means that the problem is different from what I originally thought.

The current behavior of CFM agrees with that of the usual modules:

```sage
sage: V = QQ^3
sage: V.coerce(ZZ(0))
(0, 0, 0)
sage: V.coerce(QQ(0))
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: no canonical coercion from Rational Field to Vector space of dimension 3 over Rational Field
sage: V.zero() == QQ(0)
False
sage: V.zero() == ZZ(0)
True
```
I'm thinking a better and more general solution would be to special case the zero of the base ring or possibly just `QQ`.
