That's very strange. I am guessing it's happening during an upgrade, this is from six's `setup.py`

```
try:
    from setuptools import setup
except ImportError:
    from distutils.core import setup
```
So we should have a nice fallback. Oh I get it "race condition" so setuptool is removed while you are using it. Yeah that will fix that.
