Consider the following situation:

```
sage: P = RootSystem(['A',2,1]).weight_lattice()
sage: W = RootSystem(['A',2,1]).weight_space()
sage: W.has_coerce_map_from(P)
True
sage: PA = P.algebra(QQ)
sage: WA = W.algebra(QQ)
sage: WA.has_coerce_map_from(PA)
False
```
The last line should be `True`. This comes from the fact that `GroupAlgebra` implements some extra coercion logic and `G.algebra(R)` does not return an instance of this class.

To remedy this, we lift a good portion of the `GroupAlgebra` code to the appropriate categories, where we impose the restriction that a `(Semi)Group.Algebra` must have a basis indexed by elements of the (semi)group, and have all group algebras redirect to the now (lightweight) class `GroupAlgebra_class` in order to implement coercions.

Actually, `GroupAlgebra` already has this behavior. However `algebra()` does not return the group algebra by default. I think we need 2 changes:

1 - `algebra()` checks if `self` is a group (it already checks for inclusion in finite groups).
2 - We need a subclass of `CombinatorialFreeModule` which inherits the coercions in general, say a `SemigroupAlgebra`.

I think both changes are relatively easy since for the second we can canabalize a good part of the `GroupAlgebra` code. However if 2 is contraversal/harder-than-I-thought, then we should just do 1 here as we need this for #18453 and do a followup for 2.

Also as a little side bug:

```
sage: P.algebra(QQ)
Group algebra of the Weight lattice of the Root system of type ['A', 2, 1] over Rational Field
sage: _.category()
Category of root lattice realizations over Integer Rin algebras over Rational Field
```
Notice the missing `g`, same thing for `W` (except there it's `...Fiel algebras over...`).

Merging `GroupAlgebra(G)` and `G.algebra()` has been on the pile for such a long while. Thank you so much for working on it!

So far I have always wanted to make `GroupAlgebra` as thin as possible by lifting stuff to the categories, and if at all possible get rid of it (up to possibly keeping a trivial redirect `GroupAlgebra(G)` -> `G.algebra()` for user convenience and backward compatibility). This is much more generic/flexible: for example, the feature at hand (lifting coercions from XXX to XXX algebras) is not specific to multiplicative groups, right? We would want to have the same feature for semigroups or additive groups, right?

The current implementation of this ticket tends to go the other way around.

So, the core question is: is there any feature in `GroupAlgebra` that really requires a concrete parent? Or could we just lift everything to categories.

Doing it in two steps, first this ticket as is, and then a latter ticket has the inconvenient to change lots of outputs while we may actually want to standardize the outputs the other way around.

What do you think?

Cheers,

We can definitely lift many methods up to the category. Some of them are even unnecessary, e.g., `is_finite` is handled by the `FiniteDimensionalModules.extra_super_categories` (or something like that) by adding the `Finite` axiom.

> The current implementation of this ticket tends to go the other way around.

I would say it is mostly neutral to this. The part that goes the other way is moving the addition of the semisimple axiom check, but I feel the code in `Sets.ParentMethods.algebra` is largely a hack and probably should be distributed to the appropriate subcategories. For now, this is a common point of intersection that is cleaner IMO.

> So, the core question is: is there any feature in `GroupAlgebra` that really requires a concrete parent? Or could we just lift everything to categories.

While it may not be quite what you mean, I'm considering CFM not as a concrete parent below.

One thing that could be important is the coercion into the basis index set. This would be possible to do in CFM, but it probably is not a feature we want in general because it might cause further ambiguities (e.g., a **Q**-module whose basis index set is **Z**). IMO, we definitely want this for group algebras.

The other coercion that I think we absolutely need a concrete parent is for R[G] -> R[H] when there is a coercion G -> H. Granted, this is something that could be done at a functor level, but I don't think this is possible currently.

> Doing it in two steps, first this ticket as is, and then a latter ticket has the inconvenient to change lots of outputs while we may actually want to standardize the outputs the other way around.

The biggest thing is the default output for group elements, which is something that we can (maybe should) decide here. If we decide to keep this output but go to a generic CFM with category implementation, then we can pass the appropriate parameters during the construction. So the output is an independent question.

I'm in favor of the output of `GroupAlgebra`, and in an ideal world, it would check the repr atomicness of the basis keys. However, this is not done properly for a number of groups and would likely be ineffective. Actually, we probably should lift `element_ascii_art` of `_repr_options` from the basis keys in CFM (separate ticket).

Agreed! For this use case and others, I have been wishing for a hook
in the category infrastructure enabling a category C to inspect parent
upon their initalization and provide additional categories they should
be endowed with.

Maybe we don't actually need new infrastructure, and could just use
`__init_extra__` and _refine_category():

      def Groups.Finite.Algebras.ParentMethods.__init_extra__(self)
          G = ...
          R = ...
          if ... non modular ...:
              self._refine_category(...SemiSimple())

Bearing that in mind, we may not want to move the code to an
intermediate spot when it's plausibly going to move again later.

> While it may not be quite what you mean

Sorry for the ambiguity. Let me try to clarify:

- Indeed we don't want a coercion F -> R.F for a general CFM R.F.
  Most likely we don't want a conversion either.

- For a group algebra, the conversion G -> R.G indeed sounds
  reasonable. I am unsure at this stage about a coercion; in such
  doubt my usual approach is to not put a coercion in such a case;
  later it's harder to remove a coercion than add one.

  We don't need to have a concrete class GroupAlgebra for this. Such a
  coercion could be declared in
  `Groups.Algebra.ParentMethods.__init__extra`. Presumably we could
  generalize it to `Magmas.Unital.ParentMethods.__init_extra` and its
  additive equivalent.

- The lifting of a coercion G-> H to R[G] -> R[H] for group algebras
  looks reasonable indeed. Wouldn't be enough to move the
  `construction` method to `Groups.ParentMethods`, and update the
  functor to call `G.algebra(R)` rather than `GroupAlgebra(G,R)`?
  (I haven't tried).

  This could actually be lifted to `Magmas.ParentMethods` and its
  additive counterpart.

With that, the concrete class "GroupAlgebra" could be replaced by a
simple alias `GroupAlgebra(G,R)` -> `G.algebra(R)`, right?

> The biggest thing is the default output for group elements, which is

+1

> If we decide to keep this output but go to a generic CFM with

+1. This could be done in Magmas.Algebras.__init__extra_ with set_options.
Or we could overwrite the _repr methods in MagmaAlgebra.ElementMethods.

> I'm in favor of the output of `GroupAlgebra`

I agree that the repr of GroupAlgebra is nicely concise and close to
usual math notations; so that could be a good option.

Opinions anyone? Are there are cases where there could be ambiguity
and we would want something slightly more verbose?

Not sure what you mean, but that's fine :-)

Well, I am not sure we are going to be able to escape the coercion issue. At least for now, because `GroupAlgebra` will be a small extra layer over CFM and there could be other thorny issues with getting the functionality we'd want, I think we should utilize `GroupAlgebra` for now.

`__init_extra__` is run after `__init__`, correct? So it would be safe to assume the category has been initialized and `_refine_category` is suppose to play nicely in regards to `UniqueRepresentation`. So this should work and improve things.

Well, there is an ambiguity for additive groups for coercions, even if we consider it as an action. However, it would be strange to have notation using the group elements and not having a coercion, likely leading to bug reports. I am strongly in favor of groups having coercion and for additive groups `+` being addition of two elements in the algebra.

I think there would need to be an assumption that the group elements are the indexing set of the basis, which means we need a concrete class. While this is a very reasonable assumption, it does place a restriction. Also, we are not really getting rid of a concrete class, just splitting it between CFM and the category. I feel like this obfuscates the code for little to no gain.

That is just getting more complicated and starts having a code smell, with the additional assumption that group algebra elements should be written as sums over the group elements. While it is not implemented yet, we could have a subalgebra of a matrix algebra being a group algebra for a matrix group.

For example, the algebra for the weight lattice, the element `La[1] + La[2]` is ambiguous. Is it `1 * (La[1]) + 1*(La[2])` or `1*(La[1]+La[2])`. I hack around this currently by going back to the old notation when the group is in `ModulesWithBasis`.

I feel that ideally this would be done by using  `_repr_options('element_is_atomic')`, but that might be quite the correct hook.

It's run just at the end of `Parent.__init__()`. So indeed, the
category should be initalized then.

Good point. So we absolutely don't want coercion in the additive case.
conversion is probably fine. Remains to decide whether we want just
conversion or also coercoin for 

In any cases, we can just choose between the various options in the
`__init_extra__` of `Magmas.ParentMethods` and
`AdditiveMagmas.ParentMethods`. So no issue here beside deciding what
we want.

In fact the code of Groups.Algebras already makes in a couple places
the assumption that the canonical basis is indexed by the group. This
is specified semi-explicitly in the documentation:

```
        XXX.Algebras:

            Return the category of objects constructed as algebras of
            objects of ``self`` over ``base_ring``.
```
The important part is "constructed as", the more specific definition
of it being given in xxx.algebra().

We can discuss the merit of having this assumption. I believe we
definitely need a category for "group algebras over their canonical
basis". Arguably it could possibly be useful to also have a more
general category for just "group algebras"; and then it's debatable
whether Groups.Algebras should be the former or the latter. I would
tend to just keep the current assumption for now.

Does your perspective change with the above precision about what
the category `Group.Algebras` is about?

I see. We could also get away with it with some "in doubt add
parenthesis" heuristic; E.g. if the string repr of term contains a
`+`. Not great, but simple and safe (for output purposes).

Okay, there is a technical limitation to using the `__init_extra__`: percolating calls up through the category methods.

I don't quite agree with "constructed as" meaning the basis must be indexed by the group. I also don't think we should enforce that, and only place I currently see that assumption used is the default implementation of `group`. I also do not want a category for a single object in a more natural category: it should be a concrete class. Although right now, this is moot (see below).

I've moved the methods that I could up to the category. `construction` cannot be lifted because the default in `Parent` is to `return None`. Similar for `is_exact`. So I believe we need a concrete class 

So I think at this point, this is the best we are really going to get. We can address some of these issues on some follow-up tickets.

That's the same with other functorial constructions like cartesian
product. It gives you the cartesian product in its canonical
representation.

Here are other methods (or to be implemented methods) that use the
assumption that the group algebra is represented in its canonical
basis:

- default implementation of algebra_generators
- center_basis
- multiplication
- coproduct, antipode, counit,
- stuff about representation theory of monoids
- construction of the Jucys Murphy elements for the symmetric group

Note that those live at different levels (magmas, monoids, groups,
specific groups). So if really want to support both "constructed as"
and "isomorphic to", a functorial construction and a concrete class
won't be enough. We need two functorial constructions.

> I've moved the methods that I could up to the category.

Cool, thanks!

> `construction` cannot be lifted because the default in `Parent` is to `return None`.

This is just the usual artifact that for historical reasons, there is
too much stuff in Parent, which prevents categories to provide default
implementations. `construction` being a non speed-critical method, I
foresee no obstruction to moving it to Sets (but need to double check
the code first).

> Similar for `is_exact`.

This one is a bit more annoying since it's a cpdef method. Worst comes
to worst, we could do as for __getitem__.

I could not use `super` to make the calls without getting either an infinite recursion or errors from Python. I also think we should not force a direct call to the unital algebra's `__init_extra__` in case one of the other base categories ends up having an `__init_extra__`.

I believe all of those either depend on `group`, just need a basis, or need a concrete implementation.

Hmm...I think that for `construction` and for our concrete implementation of that functor, that we need to make assumptions about the image. However, I think the category should be there for the isomorphic to and the constructed as should be a concrete class. Having a concrete class also makes things easier to maintain and add to for the non-initiated.

I agree. However, it is something that is currently a limitation.

This might be something we could lift from `GroupAlgebra` to CFM.

I suspect if you had your way, nearly everything would be implemented as a category. :P

Thoughts?\n\nThe duplication between `Groups` and `AdditiveGroups` here and for all the rest is annoying, but at this stage this is the price we pay.

Perhaps that will be one of the best arguments to you for not moving everything to the category. Now I'm considering pulling back the methods I lifted to the category for this reason. Thoughts?

The duplication between `Groups` and `AdditiveGroups` here and for all the rest is annoying, but at this stage this is the price we pay. I am actually investigating with colleagues ways to avoid this; see:

- http://opendreamkit.org/2016/08/01/CICM/
- http://opendreamkit.org/2016/08/01/CICM/#the-additive-structures-hierarchy-from-its-multiplicative-counterpart

but let's not hold our breaths on this. 

In the meantime, we can reduce the duplication to a minima by using an alias:

```
    class AdditiveGroups:
          class Algebras:
              class ParentMethods:
                   __init_extra__ = Groups.Algebras.ParentMethods.__init_extra__.im_func
```

Also: we may want to treat additive and multiplicative slightly differently, since coercion is plausible in the latter but not the former case. So maybe it won't be exact duplication.

Yes because the cartesian product construction requires a specific
data structure. Note that there is no concrete class
`CartesianProduct` for e.g. groups. Just one for sets (and one for
modules since we use a different data structure then).

In our case we don't have to define a new datastructure since we can
just use that of e.g. CFM.

> I believe all of those either depend on `group`, just need a basis, or need a concrete implementation.

Their current implementation all require the algebra to be expressed
in its canonical basis. Yes that's pretty specific. Yet not quite
concrete. We currently are using CombinatorialFreeModule for the
concrete data structure, but could switch to any other
ModulesWithBasis implementation.

But then almost all the methods I mentioned above need to go down in
the concrete class. And then we actually need several concrete
classes: MagmaAlgebra, SemigroupAlgebra, MonoidAlgebra, GroupAlgebra,
JTrivialMonoidAlgebra, all with appropriate inheritance. Thus just
redoing by hand what categories do for us, and not really making life
simpler for the non-initiated.

> > > `construction` cannot be lifted because the default in `Parent` is to `return None`.

Right, we have to do something. Let's just move the default
`construction` from `Parent` to `Sets`. I am happy giving it a shot.

> ... about `is_exact`.
> This might be something we could lift from `GroupAlgebra` to CFM.

Very good point. It really would belong go Modules.WithBasis, but CFM
is a pretty good approximation for now.

> I suspect if you had your way, nearly everything would be implemented as a category. :P

:-)

You know, the category infrastructure grew out of struggling with
concrete use cases (e.g. when implementing cartesian products), seeing
the same specific pattern come again and again, and redoing by hand
the same stuff that did not scale. And having in mind what other had
done in other systems to tackle the same pattern. I invested two years
worth of coding into that, not to have to struggle again. So yes, when
I see the specific pattern, I am motivated to use the infrastructure!

I see your point. But that's not the code, it's just the math behind. When writing a math book, each theorem comes with its own combination of hypotheses. The author can simplify the reader's life by taking some common strong assumption for all theorems in the book (e.g. all fields are algebraicall closed and of char 0). But that's at the price of generality. 

That's what's happening to us. For a long time, systems afforded to make strong assumptions (like all rings are commutative). But Sage aims beyond and enable the study of a much wider variety of objects.

> I have a hard time figuring out what is doing what where.

Given a specific method, it's relatively straightforward with the current infrastructure to decide where to put it (figuring the hypotheses of the theorem). I agree that getting the big picture is hard. We need better tools to explore and visualize what's implemented.

> In addition, I see the requirement for a specific basis as being a concrete class, and we have ill-specified things between the abstract class and the concrete class.

Somehow, putting everything about xxx algebras in the category simplifies things. No need to worry anymore where things should be :-)

> I also believe that by having `GroupAlgebra` for now makes dealing with the code duplication between `+`/`*` groups much better (we don't have to worry about making an alias for everything). 

Let's see how it goes. Before the ticket, `GroupAlgebra` only really supported multiplicative groups, right? If we only lift its features to multiplicative structures for now, that's ok.

> At this point, we do not have a need for a hierarchy of `*Algebra`, but that could eventually be a problem.

If the aim is only to support group algebras, we indeed don't need that hierarchy. Strangely enough, I very much care about supporting semigroups and monoids of all sorts :-)

> At this point, I will just lift everything up to the category under strong objections, but I would rather see this ticket get merged then left in limbo as it fixes a number of things with group algebras.

Ok, thanks. Sorry for twisting your arm. I need to improve my arguments to be more convincing :-)

Let me know if there is anything I can do to help.

I've done what I could for right now. I've pushed my current WIP. If you could finish up getting the coercion working, it didn't work for me as-is (with renaming `GroupAlgebra._coerce_map_from_`).

So long `GroupAlgebra`, and thanks for the fish!

Again, don't build on the current commits: I just stuffed everything
in there for backup and early release purposes. I am now planning to
rewrite history to split the stuff in intelligible chunks to ease the

<a id='comment:46'></a>
Before I proceed to finalization, I have a few questions:

- We currently have tutorial material about group algebras (and more
  generally XXX algebras) in several locations: Groups.Algebras,
  Sets.ParentMethods.algebra, GroupAlgebras. Possibly even in the
  group algebra functor. Each tutorial is more or less complete, and
  there is quite some duplication. Instead, it would be best to have a
  single tutorial that would take the best of each of the current
  ones, and have all other locations refer to it. And we could by the
  way refer to from the index of thematic tutorials.

  In which of the locations do we want to put that tutorial? I would
  tend to choose `Sets.ParentMethods.algebra`, as it feel the easiest
  to discover as `G.algebra?` when the user has a group `G` under hand.

  What do you think?

  `GroupAlgebra` would also be a fairly natural entry point; but I
  would tend to encourage the user of `G.algebra()` and eventually
  deprecate `GroupAlgebra` at some point to remove one more thing from
  the global name space. This later point is subject to debate though.

- Due to the change of perspective in the middle of the development of
  this ticket (my fault), there is a bit of back and forth in the
  history, which makes it hard to get an overview of what's going on.
  Also there are quite a few changes that end up being undone later on
  which increases the risks of conflicts with other branches.

  Since this branch is based on a single develop, I am tempted to not
  only rewrite the history of my latest changes, but rewrite the
  complete history (squashing it all, and then redoing commits per
  topic: preliminary changes like for "Parent.construction", moving
  GroupAlgebra's content to the categories, trivial documentation
  updates, ...).

. Presumably no one other than us has been working on this branch, so
  this should be safe even if the branch has been published. Rewriting
  history is not yet usual practice in Sage (but very much is in other
  projects), so I am hesitating.

  Note: this would also mean that the commits would be under my name.
  That's unfair in the git history. On the other hand, our practice is
  to track credit through the trac author/reviewer fields, so that
  should be alright.

  What do you think?

- With this ticket, `GroupAlgebra(SymmetricGroup(3),QQ)` now properly
  constructs an instance of `SymmetricGroupAlgebra(3,Q)`. Given that
  `SymmetricGroupAlgebra` has a custom `_repr_`, this induces quite a
  few trivial doctest updates, from:

  ```
        Group algebra of Symmetric group of order 3! as a permutation group over Rational Field
  ```
  to:

  ```
        Symmetric group algebra of order 3 over Rational Field
  ```

. While we are at it, I was wondering whether we did not want to use
  the occasion to remove that custom repr for consistency, especially
  since the that custom repr hides which specific implementation of
  the symmetric group algebra it used:

  ```
      sage: SymmetricGroupAlgebra(QQ, WeylGroup(["A",3]))
      Symmetric group algebra of order 4 over Rational Field
  ```

  Maybe we would want to also change the generic repr to produce:

  ```
      XXX group algebra over QQ
  ```
  instead of

  ```
      Group algebra of XXX group over QQ
  ```

  Opinions?

- We have been struck once again in this ticket by the dreaded
  category MRO issue. I have one commit in `sage.misc.c3_controlled`
  which makes things more robust in waiting for a proper
  implementation of #22962.

  Should I move this commit to a separate ticket?

- Lifting `Parent.construction` to `Sets.ParentMethods` forced me to
  fix a couple parents to properly initialize their categories (that's
  a good thing!). Should I move this, and the lifting of
  "construction", to a separate ticket?

Cheers,
                                        Nicolas

Well, none of this will be available from `G?`, so I would put it in `GroupAlgebra`. However, there are two slightly different topics. The first would be basic usage and properties, the other would be provide doctests of functionality. What used to be in the module-level doc of `algebras/group_algebra.py` is the latter. For this, a natural place is where we provide the majority of the implementation: the `Groups.Algebras` category. In `Sets.ParentMethods.algebra`, we should give the necessary information to construct the object as it is a generic method.

This will not cause any conflicts if you do a merge as git tries the final version, not each individual commit. It is only a potential problem if you do a rebase. IMO, it is better to have the history where you make the first attempt in case there is something we might want to salvage from it later on down the road.

We might have to do some rewriting for moving the `Parent.construction`. Although we could just make those changes on a separate branch and then merge that into here.

I like the compactness of the current representation. Plus the actual group that is used I see of as more of an implementation detail.

I think the latter is better, but it is slightly redundant. I would say

```
Algebra of XXX over YYY
```
as it is more compatible when we expand to, e.g., monoids and it contains enough information to explain the object. Although it

Yes, please. I don't understand this change and having an explanation for future reference would be beneficial.

Probably; it is good practice.

I agree that a conversion in a category would be dubious. But here we are speaking about coercions that implement canonical embeddings.

Look at the coercion from the base ring into a unital algebra. There is nothing implementation-specific in it. It's all about mathematics, and it belongs to the category of unital algebras.

Here again it's about the mathematical fact that "the embedding of G into G' lifts to an embedding of KG into KG'"; there is no need to know the specifics of the data structure for KG' to implement that fact. Therefore I see no reason why some concrete class should be involved.
It just turns out that our functor is actually a functorial construction and requires a "split implementation" (see http://opendreamkit.org/2016/08/01/CICM/#terminology by lack of better terminology). Hence its implementation ends up being in the functorial construction categories.

Alas, this does not work: there are many K'[G'] that could coerce in
K[G], and we can't explicitly register conversions for all of them.

I have been dreaming for a long time (already in MuPAD-Combinat) of
having a way to register a single "conversion pattern" that would
later get lazily instantiated as needed. `_coerce_map_from` is kind of
doing that job.

Hmm, are you worried that, if we implement a `_coerce_map_from` in
some category C, then we are forcing each of its concrete parent to
make a choice between either restraining itself from implementing a
custom `_coerce_map_from` method, or not benefiting from the generic
coercions provided by C?

If yes, I believe we are fine: both can implement `_coerce_map_from`
methods as long as they play cooperatively with super calls. That's
what I have done here.

It's not yet common practice. However if, as I would tend to foresee,
it becomes a common situations to have both a parent and several of
its categories implement `_coerce_map_from` methods, we could better
support this idiom by:

- Changing Parent's default implementation to do a super call

- Encourage if not enforce in the documentation that any
  implementation of `_coerce_map_from` should end with a super call.

Granted, super calls within the categories are somewhat inconvenient
due to recovering the relevant class; it should get better with
singleton categories.

Cheers,

That is part of my concern, as it can require some finesse to get around it as you have done. However, that is not my biggest worry (see below).

I do not think this is a good idea to recommend super calls on `_coerce_map_from_` as they could go to a category with less structure, allowing more permissive coercions (e.g., graded algebras to algebras). I also think that `_coerce_map_from_` should be reserved for concrete implementations, where specific information about the data structure can be used for a similar reason.

I am not completely convinced of this, as it should be determined by the hierarchy of the categories. I think the biggest technical limitation is the Python2 version of `super`.

> Yes and no. My strong opinion is that when you have a `construction` that returns a `ConstructionFunctor`, then that functor should be able to set. This is both a natural place and should be simple to implement. Unfortunately, we don't have such a hook yet. I would much rather have a concrete class with a `_coerce_map_from_` in the meantime than the hack around as a (lightweight) concrete class is easier to get rid of in the future.

A lightweight concrete class also has its downside: Let's say Alice
wants to implement a monoid algebra A, but using a different data
structure than Combinatorial Free Module. Maybe someone wanting to
endow the existing polynomial rings with their natural monoid algebra
structure. If there is a lightweight concrete class C, then Alice is
forced to chose to either have A inherit from C (which may conflict
with the existing data structure), or to not benefit from the features
of C.

For cartesian products, there already are at least two concrete
implementations.

As for the "hack around": maybe the infrastructure could streamline
further the process, but I do not see it as a hack: there are several
players that together provide the features of group algebras, and this
is just making them cooperate also on the coercion definitions.

There is a point here: Sage has always been fuzzy about its definition
of coercions which should be "morphisms for whatever the structure the
objects could have", and we are hitting on that fuzz. I believe this
should be in the contract: "by declaring yourself in that category
(especially a functorial construction category), you accept that there
will be a coercion from XXX".

My approach to that has always be to minimize the number of coercions
defined by default :-)

Good point: a concrete implementation may want to exploit the internal
data structure to provide a more efficient implementation of the
morphism. Hence we should separate the implementation of the morphism
from its declaration as coercion, so that the implementation can be
overridden in subclass. That's what we already do for
"from_base_ring", and did in similar situations in MuPAD-Combinat.
I'll implement that here.

Quite true! I guess I am just not yet in the frame of mind "Python 3
will come soon enough that I can start dreaming about all the good use
we could make of its features" :-) I am not sure though Python3 with
help with super and categories for Cython classes. Let's see.

Cheers,

You're circumventing the MRO with the second call to `_coerce_map_from_`, which has to possible catch an `AttributeError`. So if you want to do this at the category level, then you should define the generic call at that category level. However, this could have speed implications as it is a `cpdef` method currently, in addition to the other problems we are discussing.

I feel like that is a something that would come from registering coercions using a `ConstructionFunctor` and making that the default result of `construction`. However, don't think we should have that be (one of) the defining condition of a coercion as it is too strong, but instead a condition on objects the category, as your statement makes.

Right, it's indeed a shame that `G?` did not bring anything useful. I
fixed this by setting its `__doc__` attribute in
`Sets.ParentMethods.algebra`.

After moving things around while merging all the pieces together, I
ended up adopting the following plan:

- Have the module `sage.categories.algebra_functor` start with a
  tutorial on "group algebras and generalizations", introducing as its
  name suggests the topic with group algebras and then generalizing.

- Link this tutorial from the thematic tutorials

- Proceed after the tutorial with a test section containing all tests
  that did not have a natural location elsewhere (e.g. in the
  docstring of a method).

- For each of `Sets.ParentMethods.algebra`, `GroupAlgebra`,
  `GroupAlgebras` and the group algebra functor, have a short doc with
  the minimum definition, examples and specifications that are
  specific to each, and a proeminent link to the tutorial.

Good point. I kept the history as is for your first implementation and
only rewrote history for my own changes (no intermediate point was of
particular value).

Oh, I see: I had forgotten I had not finished the work: the code back
then was indeed a hack in CFM to circumvent the implementation in
`Module`. I have reworked this so that the default implementation
really is in `Sets.ParentMethods`, and both `Module` and `Parent` play
cooperatively by ending with a super call instead of returning `None`
if they have nothing to offer.

This does not close the discussion on whether we want
`_coerce_map_from_` play cooperatively along the hierarchy of classes.
But if we do, the above implementation sounds clean to me. Having the
cpdef `_coerce_map_from_` in `Parent` enables subclasses to implement
cpdef `_coerce_map_from_` that are fast when they succeed, which I
believe is the most important.

It would be nice to have the coercion be tied to the construction
functor. And incidentally it would be nice to have a bivariate functor
rather than our two "curried" univariate ones (`GroupAlgebra(G)(Q)`
and `AlgebraFunctor(Q)(G)`).

In the mean time, I aiming right now for the concrete-class-less
approach, in particular because the later transition will be
transparent to subclasses.

Cheers,
                           Nicolas

I know we've come across it in the past, but the fallacy comes from the fact it might be a problem in the future and that there are other solutions (e.g., code duplication, which wouldn't be much since it is lightweight). Plus, this is only meant to be there short-term while we implement a more general framework.

Yes, this is much better.

I don't like this as it means coercion testing has an extra level of an MRO lookup plus a python call. So it ends up adding a bit of extra overhead. Granted, this is not a huge difference as coercions are cached, and this is rarely called (relatively speaking). So it is not a strong argument. However, I'm still very worried about incidentally allowing coercions between weakened structures by enforcing `_coerce_map_from_` to make super calls. Plus there are the technical limitations.

However, we need a better mechanism for putting category level information into the coercion framework as this is essentially duplicating information (in a private method) that would be available from the functor.

I can do this on a followup ticket. At least I have a good idea about how this should be done. Although, thinking about it, it might have a similar sort of slowdown as lifting up the `_coerce_map_from_`. However, it is something that we should do IMO.

> And incidentally it would be nice to have a bivariate functor

There is a problem with resolving this due to ambiguities with the codomain category. One possibility is that we have a category with either a single object (up to isomorphism), the group algebra `R[G]` for a fixed group `G` and ring `R`. Another possibility is that we allow the ring `R` to vary. The last is we allow `G` to vary. The former is either the single object category or allows `R` to vary. The latter is either the single object category or allows `G` to vary.

Part of this might come from current technical limitations, i.e., `CovariantFunctorialConstruction` versus `ConstructionFunctor`. I would probably say that by moving so much up to the category, we have made this problem worse to almost forcing the category to have a single object, which is not what we want.

I still have my strong reservations with not allowing a concrete class (at this point) in general. I am willing to bend very far, but not all the way at this point. As a compromise, could we have the lightweight concrete class for now until we implement a better infrastructure for the coercion maps? It does not make anything worse (from your POV) than what we currently have.

Brief summary of the phone call we had together with Travis today (Thanks Travis for relaunching the discussion!): this ticket is basically ready to go (up to rebasing, and possibly fixing a few more doctests). We did not come to an agreement on whether to use a concrete class or not. I still believe that using one instead of enabling `coerce_map_from` in the categories is limiting the flexibility without a compelling safety reason.

That being said, we need to move on and the design decision is fairly easy to revert. So I gave my green light for switching back to a very minimal concrete class whose role is only to handle the coercions.

I asked Travis to create a ticket with the current branch to keep the code around in case later insights or use cases makes us rethink the decision.
