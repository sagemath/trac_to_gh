We make `prime_powers` an iterator (as it is for `primes`). We also provide an alternative way of generating prime powers using the method `next_prime_power` from #16880. It is indeed much faster for a range like `[2^200, 2^200 + 256]`.

I do not see how one can make it an iterator! Possibly the ugly

```python
def prime_powers(m, n=None, output_type=None):
    if output_type is None:
        deprecation("this is switching from list to iterator")
        output_type = "list"

    if output_type == "list":
        return list(future_prime_powers(m, n))
    elif output_type == "iterator":
        return future_prime_powers(m, n)
    else:
        raise ValueError("output_type must be either 'list' or 'iterator'")
```
This is what you would prefer? Do you have something better to suggest?

W.r.t. generators:

I guess Karl-Dieter refers to displaying `generator object at ...`  instead of a list of numbers in interactive mode, which might be annoying to (Python) newbies.

In general (or most cases), generators are "better", so we'd IMHO just have to educate new users somehow, telling them they can simply use `list(foo(...))`. ;-)

Or we could let the "default" functions wrap generator versions, but then we'd have to revert the behaviour of `primes()` etc. again, which is a bit odd as well.

IIRC Cython meanwhile supports generators, so e.g. `primes()` could be sped up, at least for "small" numbers (exceeding PARI's stored primes), but that's a bit off-topic.

And in Python 3 almost everything becomes an iterator (map, range, etc).

Changing `primes` is not an option, see [this thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/sage-devel/primes$20prime_range/sage-devel/zYgAgilY5bY/dcVaEDOGmc8J).

> IIRC Cython meanwhile supports generators, so e.g. `primes()` could be sped up, at least for "small" numbers (exceeding PARI's stored primes), but that's a bit off-topic.

Yes, that would be good.

Wrapping might be a reasonable option, but then what should we do when sombedy does `len(l)`? Expand the list? Just run the iterator? Use `prime_pi`? And with `l[4]`? Should we use `next_prime`? Use `nth_prime`? The best solution depends on the usage and this is why I do prefer avoiding wrappers. But this is what has been proposed in the above thread... I would be happy if there is enough documentation mentioning the other ways of accessing the information. So let me do that.

Concrete proposition:
- make `Primes` and `PrimePowers` behave like `IntegerRange`

```
sage: Primes(100, 1000)
Set of prime numbers in the range 101 <= p < 998: 101, 103, 107, 109, ...
sage: Primes(2**30)
Set of prime numbers in the range 2 <= p < 1073741790: 2, 3, 5, 7, ...
```
 (note that the bounds are computed accurately to have a simple equality test)
- make `primes` a deprecated alias of `Primes` (but keep it in `sage.rings.arith` as it is)
- change `sage.rings.arith.prime_powers` to an iterator
- in the global namespace make `prime_powers` a deprecated alias of `PrimePowers`
