Currently, when building a diagram algebra, the functions that create the set partitions representing the diagrams create a list of all the correct set partitions. However, this behavior causes the initialization of the algebras to be slow in larger cases. Furthermore, there are things one can do in these algebras without needing to know the whole basis since it is usually pretty easy to determine if an element is in the algebra. Thus, in order to avoid this computation except when necessary, I have made the set partition generating functions return iterators instead of lists.

Depends on #18707

Thank you for your work on cleaning up the diagram algebras. I know this isn't yet ready for review, but some comments:

You should try to avoid changing the behavior of any public functions. Instead I would create an iterator method (perhaps make it hidden?) and then the original function just calls `list(iterator_method)`.

You shouldn't use `CombinatorialClass` and `CombinatorialObject` but instead `Parent, UniqueRepresentation` and `ClonableArray` respectively as these are being deprecated. Also you should set the `Element = PartitionDiagram` in `PartitionDiagrams` (the order of which will need to be swapped in the file). If you put `PartitionDiagrams` in the category of `FiniteEnumeratedSets`, then you don't need to define a `list` and `cardinality` methods (maybe even `__contains__`, I forget offhand). The `PartitionDiagram` class will also need to have parent be passed as the first argument.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Don't worry too much about it. It's better that the code is readable and grouped into functionality (i.e., good OOP). It was just if they were going to be classes that passed data up to a base class, then I didn't see a reason to keeping them.

I have a question about making the various other classes and objects evaluate as equal with the Diagram classes. Doing this allows the user to create algebra elements that can misbehave. For instance


```
sage: P = PartitionAlgebra(2,x)
sage: elm = P.basis()[((1,2),(-1,-2))]; elm
P[((1, 2), (-1, -2))]
sage: type(elm.support()[0])
<type 'tuple'>
sage: elm^2
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
AttributeError: 'tuple' object has no attribute 'compose'
```

This isn't insurmountable, but will I have to put a lot of coercion throughout all the diagram methods to make this exhibit the desired behavior?

I am sorry, I don't quite get what "make the basis indexing set iterate over elements of itself" means because I don't quite understand the structure of the `LazyFamily` in the context of `CombinatorialFreeModule` yet. My concern is: should users expect that calling for the support of an element return a uniform type? I will commit what I have so you can take a look.

You are correct, it should be a uniform type. What the `LazyFamily` does in `CombinatorialFreeModule.basis()` (in this case) is iterate over the `AbstractPartitionDiagrams` class and then makes that into an element of the CFM, but only when required. However from looking at it, it should be working properly.

Also I think `range(-len(tst)/2,len(tst)/2+1)` might give you trouble because it's doing python int division (where `1/2 == 0`). And `except TypeError, ValueError:` should be `except (TypeError, ValueError):`.

Travis, thank you for all your suggestions so far. They have provided good speedups and made things cleaner and easier to read. I still have one question, though, involving the how the equality between diagrams and iterables of iterables works. I think an example will be best.

```
sage: B = BrauerAlgebra(3,x)
sage: elm = B([[1,2],[-1,-2]]) #calls element_constructor
sage: elm2 = B.basis()[((1,2),(-1,-2),(3,-3))] #bypasses element_constructor
sage: elm == elm2
False
sage: elm*B.one() == elm2*B.one() #support converted into same type
True
sage: elm.support()[0] == elm2.support()[0] #AbstractPartitionDiagram.__eq__ called
True
sage: type(elm.support()[0]) #support was left as tuple by construction
<type 'tuple'>
```

So, while I personally never construct elements by calling `B.basis().__getitem__`, it seems that this is a totally valid method to create an element, but leads to some unpredictable or unclear behaviors. Do you know the best way to address this in the context of `CombinatorialFreeModule`?

sage: s.basis()[(3,1,1)]

It looks like you'll have to rebase this against the latest `develop` branch.

You'll also need to make sure all methods have doctests and, more minor, to change `Returns` to `Return` and similar changes in the docstrings (of the methods you've changed). I'll continue my review at that point. Thanks.

I allowed myself one last little trivial change, `[GL]` -> `[GL1996]`, so as to make it less likely that there is a collision in reference names.

Thank you for your work (and sorry it took so long to do the review). Now onto the next ticket.
