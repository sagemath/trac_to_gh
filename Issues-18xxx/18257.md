Several doctests in `symbolic/pynac.pyx` iterate over `range(get_ginac_serial(), get_ginac_serial()+100)`. You guess it (sigh), `100` is arbitrary and, right now with some new tickets that introduce new functions, it has become too small, leading to unrelated doctest fails in `symbolic/pynac.pyx`. This ticket should make sure that this does not happen again.

I agree that this is worth fixing permanently, but unless there is an obvious fix we shouldn't let this hold up adding more symbolic functions.

This is not really difficult.

The central database is a dictionary globally defined in `symbolic/function.pyx` named `sfunction_serial_dict`. It has pairs with key of type `unsigned` and values of `Function` objects (which can be `GinacFunctions` or `BuiltinFunctions`). Accordingly this database is filled with all known Pynac `function`s (which have the `GinacFunction` fa√ßade) first and then those defined via `BuiltinFunction`. The `unsigned` key is the serial number which, on each new function registration, is incremented by one, namely in `GiNaC::function::register_new()`(https://github.com/pynac/pynac/blob/master/ginac/function.cpp#L1445) by just adding to the Pynac registry and reporting its size minus one. After the GiNaC functions have been added, the global `GINAC_FN_SERIAL` is set which is then accessed via `get_ginac_serial()` to get the start key of the Sage defined functions.

There is a problem if ever a function is deregistered. Can this happen? No mechanism in Pynac exists for this at the moment, so it's  not a practical consideration.

So the solution is easy: instead of simply adding `100` to the start point, we try all keys from the start key to the latest key used---this need not be a static variable set on registration. Since functions are never deregistered the latest is, again, just the size of the GiNaC registry minus one. This can be had from a call to `g_registered_functions().size()` in `symbolic/pynac.pyx`. 

```
cdef get_fn_serial_c():
    return g_registered_functions().size()

def get_fn_serial():
    return get_fn_serial_c()

sage: from sage.symbolic.pynac import get_fn_serial
sage: get_fn_serial()
127
sage: from sage.symbolic.pynac import get_ginac_serial
sage: get_ginac_serial()
40
sage: from sage.symbolic.function import get_sfunction_from_serial
sage: for i in range(get_ginac_serial(), get_fn_serial()):
    print get_sfunction_from_serial(i)
... // prints all known functions
sage: print get_sfunction_from_serial(get_fn_serial()+1)
None
```
