Several doctests in `symbolic/pynac.pyx` iterate over `range(get_ginac_serial(), get_ginac_serial()+100)`. You guess it (sigh), `100` is arbitrary and, right now with some new tickets that introduce new functions, it has become too small, leading to unrelated doctest fails in `symbolic/pynac.pyx`. This ticket should make sure that this does not happen again.

This is not really difficult.

The central database is a dictionary globally defined in `symbolic/function.pyx` named `sfunction_serial_dict`. It has pairs with key of type `unsigned` and values of `Function` objects (which can be `GinacFunctions` or `BuiltinFunctions`). Accordingly this database is filled with all known Pynac `function`s (which have the `GinacFunction` fa√ßade) first and then those defined via `BuiltinFunction`. The `unsigned` key is the serial number which, on each new function registration, is incremented by one, namely in `GiNaC::function::register_new()`(https://github.com/pynac/pynac/blob/master/ginac/function.cpp#L1445) by just adding to the Pynac registry and reporting its size minus one. After the GiNaC functions have been added, the global `GINAC_FN_SERIAL` is set which is then accessed via `get_ginac_serial()` to get the start key of the Sage defined functions.

There is a problem if ever a function is deregistered. Can this happen? No mechanism in Pynac exists for this at the moment, so it's  not a practical consideration.

So the solution is easy: instead of simply adding `100` to the start point, we try all keys from the start key to the latest key used---this need not be a static variable set on registration. Since functions are never deregistered the latest is, again, just the size of the GiNaC registry minus one. This can be had from a call to `g_registered_functions().size()` in `symbolic/pynac.pyx`. 

```
cdef get_fn_serial_c():
    return g_registered_functions().size()

def get_fn_serial():
    return get_fn_serial_c()

sage: from sage.symbolic.pynac import get_fn_serial
sage: get_fn_serial()
127
sage: from sage.symbolic.pynac import get_ginac_serial
sage: get_ginac_serial()
40
sage: from sage.symbolic.function import get_sfunction_from_serial
sage: for i in range(get_ginac_serial(), get_fn_serial()):
    print get_sfunction_from_serial(i)
... // prints all known functions
sage: print get_sfunction_from_serial(get_fn_serial()+1)
None
