A natural convenience improvement is possible. At the moment:

```
sage: z = var('z')
sage: f =  1 - z - z^2 - z^3 - z^4 - z^5
sage: solve(f == 0,z)
[0 == z^5 + z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z - 1]
sage: f.roots(ring=QQbar)
[(0.5086603916420041?, 1),
 (-1.011836827437571? - 0.6839585956421031?*I, 1),
 (-1.011836827437571? + 0.6839585956421031?*I, 1),
 (0.2575066316165687? - 1.118790314198966?*I, 1),
 (0.2575066316165687? + 1.118790314198966?*I, 1)]
```
