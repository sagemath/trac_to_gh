```
Currently, the function `_package_lists_from_sage_output` only gives the latest available version of a package, not the version which is installed.

I propose to define a new function `package_versions(local=False)` which returns a dictionary with key:value pairs of the form

```
package_name: (installed_version, latest_version)
```
where `installed_version` is `None` if the package is not installed and `latest_version` is the newest available version.

If, for example, arb-2.5.0 is installed but arb-2.6.0 is availble, then one such key:value pair would be

```
'arb': ('2.5.0', '2.6.0')
```

If arb is not installed, this would be:

```
'arb': (None, '2.6.0')
```

Depends on #18456

I don't want a **tuple** of lists of tuples, that's just too complicated. I meant just one list of tuples.

Actually thinking a bit more about this, a dictionary makes more sense: the keys are the package names and the values are tuples `(installed_version, latest_version)`.

And I certainly want the output format to be the same for `local=True` and `local=False`.

I also propose to make this a separate function `package_versions()` to avoid the many `if version` branches you will need. And then implement the old `_package_lists_from_sage_output()` as a very short function using this new `package_versions()` function.

Then I don't understand what you want. With `local=True`, you don't use the internet, but to find the latest available version, you need the internet. So I'm puzzled.

Regarding your previous comment, if we implement `package_versions()`, then do you care much what sort of output `_package_lists_from_sage_output` produces? Should I just revert it back to the output it had in #18456?

Or at least, that's how "latest available version" is defined in the earlier versions. Do you just want to read the data from `build/pkgs/benzene/package_version.txt`, etc.? What do you do with old style packages?

You're right, I was only thinking about new-style packages. I propose the following:
- for new-style packages, read the latest available version from `buikd/pkgs/foo/package_version.txt`
- for old-style packages with `local=True`, use `None` as latest available version.

If we do implement `package_versions()`, then `_package_lists_from_sage_output` shouldn't have a `version` argument.

I suppose to make this work well, when a package is installed, we should record its type in its record in `local/var/lib/sage/installed`. I'm not sure I want to bother with that. As it is, if someone installs an old-style package, we don't know what type it is without checking the servers (and the servers are not 100% accurate: e.g., `zeromq` is listed as both standard and optional on the servers).

Currently, `sage --optional` (etc.) ignores the files in `var/lib/sage/installed` when compiling a list of packages to print: it only checks `build/pkgs` and the servers. (It does check those files to see what version of a package was installed.) I'm not sure of a better way to proceed, especially if `local` is True.

That's not my wish, that how `sage-fix-pkg-checksums` and `./sage -i` already handle packages.

Note that

```
./sage -i database_jones_numfield
```
does try to install the package `database_jones_numfield-v4`, so you cannot claim that the name of the package is "`database_jones_numfield-v4`" without a version number.

Conversely,

```
./sage -i database_stein_watkins_mini
```
cannot install the old-style package "`database_stein_watkins_mini.p0`" (even if you remove `build/pkgs/database_stein_watkins_mini`) because the `.p0` is not seen as a version number (and I don't think it should!)

Okay, so you are just telling me that "only what follows a '-' character is a version number" precisely because that's what the script handle (which is a bug). And to prove it, you explain to me that "p0" is clearly not a version number.

Can we talk about the list of packages online? You set my patch to 'needs_work' because 'extcode' is not a standard package according to you. But of course, the official list of Sage's package had to be what is listed on the mirrors, don't you think?

Nathann, in #18456 you decided to change

```
def split_pkgname(name):
    try:
        basename, version = name.split('-', 1)
    except ValueError:
        # Some packages such as currently "csage" aren't versioned, or
        # have non-standard versioning, e.g. "database_stein_watkins_mini.p0".
        basename = name
        version = ""
    return basename, version
```
to

```
def pkgname_split(name):
    pname = name.split(' ')[0]
    pname = re.sub("(\.|-)p[0-9]+$","",pname) # strip .p0
    pname = re.sub("(\.|-)[0-9].*","",pname) # strip version number
    return (pname,name[len(pname)+1:])
```
without justification or giving a reason why the latter is correct (where did those regexes come from?)

Unless you can give me a good reason why you changed that, I'm proposing to undo that change.

It's not a matter of denial, it's more a matter of consistency. What's the point of listing a package `FOO` in the output of `./sage --optional` if `./sage -i FOO` cannot install that package?

Instead of making up contrived regular expressions to deal with wrong package names, let's just fix the packages instead. The package `database_stein_watkins_mini.p0` is already fixed by a new-style package and we should just remove the wrongly-named package.

```
database_jones_numfield-v4   is 'v4' the version number?

I believe that you are breaking something that works. If you want to set a new standard (it is not currently enforced), fix the package's name first and then write some code to enforce the standard.

What worked before that I am breaking?

> If you want to set a new standard (it is not currently enforced), fix the package's name first and then write some code to enforce the standard.

The current standard is that the full package name is split into a package-version pair by the first hyphen. This is probably not documented anywhere, but that's the current practice. This is the standard followed by `./sage -i` (*), by `sage-fix-pkg-checksums` and by `sage-list-packages` (until recently when you changed it).

I am pretty sure that no script ever considered `mayavi_2.2.1` as the package `mayavi_2` with version `2.1`, so I'm wondering why you made it that way in #18456.

(*) To be more precise, `./sage -i` splits by any hyphen, not just the first hyphen.
