```
After some design discussion, a proposal for an implementation is to be a subcategory of `Graded` algebras/modules whose default even/odd considers the given grading as being `ZZ / 2 ZZ` compatible. Thus it will have the following methods:

- `is_even()`
- `is_odd()`
- `is_even_odd()`

The API will be the user defines a `degree` method which is then called by `is_even_odd()` and taken mod 2. Therefore if the user wants to have a special grading group, then the user can override `is_even_odd()` to translate that into 0 or 1. The hook of `is_even_odd` also allows the user to change the super behavior away from the grading group (which will get used in #17096).

Depends on #18174

Is this really a subcategory? Super Lie algebras are not Lie algebras and cannot be reasonably made into such short of taking the even part...

Good point (this is different than `Graded`, which is where I copied things from). Think we should just replace the word "sub" with "associated"? If so, I can go make this change (in about 2 hours).

Sorry but the assumption that "super X are graded X" (or just "super X are X") is fundamentally wrong. The longer we keep it in, the harder it will be to cross that bridge. It already causes wrong results:

```
sage: C = HopfAlgebras(QQ).Super()
sage: C.super_categories()
[Category of hopf algebras over Rational Field,
 Category of super algebras over Rational Field]
```
Super Hopf algebras are not Hopf algebras. In a Hopf algebra,
` (xy)_{(1)} \otimes (xy)_{(2)} = x_{(1)} y_{(1)} \otimes x_{(2)} y_{(2)} `
(using sumfree Sweedler notation), while in a super Hopf algebra,
` (xy)_{(1)} \otimes (xy)_{(2)} = (-1)^{\deg y_{(1)} \deg x_{(2)}} x_{(1)} y_{(1)} \otimes x_{(2)} y_{(2)} `.

In other news: In the `lift_module_morphism` method for Clifford algebras, did you really mean `Graded` in

```
        return Cl.module_morphism(on_basis=f, codomain=self,
                                  category=AlgebrasWithBasis(self.base_ring()).Graded())
```
(and not `Super`)?

Then I guess we need to change the default super categories thingy and just be explicit about things.
So then the category hierarchy should be

```
SuperHopf    GradedHopf
    |           |
SuperAlg      Hopf
       \     /
         Alg
```
right? So we could do an explicit override of the `SuperHopf`'s super category (at least, this is probably one of the very few instances where a super object is different notation from the graded).

I'm not happy with this because of how certain things in the category hierarchy are respected, even in this new version. In particular:

```
sage: C = HopfAlgebras(ZZ).WithBasis().Super(); C
Category of super hopf algebras with basis over Integer Ring
sage: sorted(C.super_categories(), key=str)
[Category of hopf algebras with basis over Integer Ring,
 Category of super algebras over Integer Ring,
 Category of super algebras with basis over Integer Ring]
```
I don't know a way around this currently...

However I'm starting to wonder if this is what we want. If we want two notions of super, the first is via a functorial construction for things like modules and algebras (and rings once the graded versions get implemented), and for other things if we want the `Super` call to go to a `Category_over_base_ring` subclass.
