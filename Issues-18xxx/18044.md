After some design discussion, a proposal for an implementation is to be a subcategory of `Graded` algebras/modules whose default even/odd considers the given grading as being `ZZ / 2 ZZ` compatible. Thus it will have the following methods:

- `is_even()`
- `is_odd()`
- `is_even_odd()`

The API will be the user defines a `degree` method which is then called by `is_even_odd()` and taken mod 2. Therefore if the user wants to have a special grading group, then the user can override `is_even_odd()` to translate that into 0 or 1. The hook of `is_even_odd` also allows the user to change the super behavior away from the grading group (which will get used in #17096).

Is this really a subcategory? Super Lie algebras are not Lie algebras and cannot be reasonably made into such short of taking the even part...

It's more of there is not a forgetful functor from `C.super()` to `C`, but I'll make this change.

<a id='comment:10'></a>Sorry but the assumption that "super X are graded X" (or just "super X are X") is fundamentally wrong. The longer we keep it in, the harder it will be to cross that bridge. It already causes wrong results:

```
sage: C = HopfAlgebras(QQ).Super()
sage: C.super_categories()
[Category of hopf algebras over Rational Field,
 Category of super algebras over Rational Field]
```
Super Hopf algebras are not Hopf algebras. In a Hopf algebra,
` (xy)_{(1)} \otimes (xy)_{(2)} = x_{(1)} y_{(1)} \otimes x_{(2)} y_{(2)} `
(using sumfree Sweedler notation), while in a super Hopf algebra,
` (xy)_{(1)} \otimes (xy)_{(2)} = (-1)^{\deg y_{(1)} \deg x_{(2)}} x_{(1)} y_{(1)} \otimes x_{(2)} y_{(2)} `.

In other news: In the `lift_module_morphism` method for Clifford algebras, did you really mean `Graded` in

```
        return Cl.module_morphism(on_basis=f, codomain=self,
                                  category=AlgebrasWithBasis(self.base_ring()).Graded())
```
(and not `Super`)?
