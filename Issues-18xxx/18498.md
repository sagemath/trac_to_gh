There is something fishy there.

What you propose "can be done", it is not a big problem. And the only 'trick' I see to avoid the additional keyword and the private method would be to 1) create the Graph 2) orient its edges. This way the digraph constructor would merely call the graph constructor, and know what to do because it knows what the vertex set is.

Of course, that only works if ths orientation can be easily deduced from each edge.

For the moment, however, I am much more concerned that what is a Sierpinski graph in Sage is what is called a Sierpinski graph in the litterature.

P.S.: I set this ticket to `needs_info`, as your code contains a "REFERENCES: todo"

<a id='comment:17'></a>Hellooooooo Frédéric!

Several remarks:

- The name of a `Graph` usually ends with `Graph`. I agree that it is a terrible
  standard, considering that even `digraphs.*` do not follow it.

- Isn't there something wrong with the number of vertices as given in the
  function's docstring? You say that it is equal to `3 (3^{n-1}-1)/2`, though:
  {{{
  sage: [graphs.SierpinskiGasket(x).order() for x in range(1,8)]
  [3, 6, 15, 42, 123, 366, 1095]
  sage: [3*(3**(n-1)-1)/2 for n in range(1,8)]
  [0, 3, 12, 39, 120, 363, 1092]
  }}}

- You mention twice the `HanoiTowerGraph`: could you merge those two similar
  remarks into one?

- It is only my personal opinion, but I believe that the 'gasket' keyword is a
  sufficient protection to avoid misunderstandings. I do not believe that a
  'warning' is needed here (especially above the 'input' block). I would not see
  anything wrong with only a 'seealso', to help redirect lost users.

- Is there any reason to give those names to the vertices? Or is it only because
  of the positions? If they have no specific meaning, what would you think of
  relabelling the graph to integers before returning it (a call to `.relabel()`
  does that automatically)?

I added a commit at public/18498 with a couple of modifications:

- A modified 'vertical' layout

- A picture of the graph in its documentation

I you agree with those, you can cherry-pick that commit on your branch.

Thanks,

Nathann
