Hello,

you should add the definition of this graph. Indeed, you apparently assume that it is defined as a directed graph, while others consider that it is an undirected graph http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SierpinskiSieveGraph.html

It is better. You must also provide a definition of the graph you define, though you must also justify the creation of a "Sierpinski digraph", preferably from existing papers. When you google "sierpinski graph", all that you find are undirected graphs.

Furthermore, some sem to hint that those graphs [1] are (in some cases) isomorphic to Hanoi Tower graphs. But the pictures from Wolfram [2] and those that we can produce with Sage clearly disagree

```
    sage: graphs.HanoiTowerGraph(3,4).show(vertex_labels=False)
```

There is something fishy there.

What about putting this method in a new file dedicated to families of directed graphs in directory `generators` (similar to file `families.py` for undirected graphs), adding it an extra parameter `directed=True/False`, and then calling it from both `graphs` and `digraphs` with appropriate parameters?

Inside the method, it should be enough to have `G = DiGraph() if directed else Graph()` and the rest will be the same.
I don't know if there is a trick to avoid the `directed` parameter. May be there is. Nathann?

And the only 'trick' I see to avoid the additional keyword and the private method would be to 1) create the Graph 2) orient its edges. This way the digraph constructor would merely call the graph constructor, and know what to do because it knows what the vertex set is.\n\nOf course, that only works if ths orientation can be easily deduced from each edge.\n\nFor the moment, however, I am much more concerned that what is a Sierpinski graph in Sage is what is called a Sierpinski graph in the litterature.\n\nNathann\n\nP.S.: I set this ticket to `needs_info`, as your code contains a \"REFERENCES: todo\"",

What you propose "can be done", it is not a big problem. And the only 'trick' I see to avoid the additional keyword and the private method would be to 1) create the Graph 2) orient its edges. This way the digraph constructor would merely call the graph constructor, and know what to do because it knows what the vertex set is.

Of course, that only works if ths orientation can be easily deduced from each edge.

For the moment, however, I am much more concerned that what is a Sierpinski graph in Sage is what is called a Sierpinski graph in the litterature.

Nathann

P.S.: I set this ticket to `needs_info`, as your code contains a "REFERENCES: todo"

I think these graphs should be called the "Sierpinski gasket graphs"
and the one related to Hanoi towers should be called "Sierpinski graphs"

See the following ref for this terminology and many references.

http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00224-010-9286-3

I have found some other references:

* Chang, Shu-Chiuan; Chen, Lung-Chi; Yang, Wei-Shih Spanning trees on the Sierpinski gasket

and several other articles by the same authors.

Ok, here is something that needs review.

I have called them `SierpinskiGasket` graphs, as in the reference that I give.

I have linked the doc to `HanoiTowerGraph` for the other possible Sierpinski graphs.

Hellooooooo Frédéric!

Several remarks:

- The name of a `Graph` usually ends with `Graph`. I agree that it is a terrible
  standard, considering that even `digraphs.*` do not follow it.

- Isn't there something wrong with the number of vertices as given in the
  function's docstring? You say that it is equal to `3 (3^{n-1}-1)/2`, though:

  ```
  sage: [graphs.SierpinskiGasket(x).order() for x in range(1,8)]
  [3, 6, 15, 42, 123, 366, 1095]
  sage: [3*(3**(n-1)-1)/2 for n in range(1,8)]
  [0, 3, 12, 39, 120, 363, 1092]
  ```

- You mention twice the `HanoiTowerGraph`: could you merge those two similar
  remarks into one?

- It is only my personal opinion, but I believe that the 'gasket' keyword is a
  sufficient protection to avoid misunderstandings. I do not believe that a
  'warning' is needed here (especially above the 'input' block). I would not see
  anything wrong with only a 'seealso', to help redirect lost users.

- Is there any reason to give those names to the vertices? Or is it only because
  of the positions? If they have no specific meaning, what would you think of
  relabelling the graph to integers before returning it (a call to `.relabel()`
  does that automatically)?

I added a commit at public/18498 with a couple of modifications:

- A modified 'vertical' layout

- A picture of the graph in its documentation

I you agree with those, you can cherry-pick that commit on your branch.

Thanks,

Nathann
