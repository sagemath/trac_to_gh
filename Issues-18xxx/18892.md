Linking needs to be changed from `dynamic` to `dynamiclib` on OS X I think looking into it.

Small addition to `Singular/configure` the default option for linking meant that with the change from `ld` to `g++`, `libsingular.dylib` became an executable rather than a library as stated in the error when building sage. The added patch corrects this behaviour and `libsingular.dylib` is again a dynamic library.
