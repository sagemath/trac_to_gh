<a id='comment:11'></a>Helloooooooooo !

I added a commit at public/18530 (since you chose to make the branch public).

Most of the changes I made are superficial:
- Reduce the number of lines whenever possible
- Add edges from an iterator instead of a dictionary. Adding edges from a dictionary calls ` add_edge` on an iterator, so it can only be slower

I also fixed a bug with ladder_graph, which was incorrect (plot it, you will see).

Most importantly, if you have never looked at paths, now is the time:

```
sage: graphs.PathGraph(3).show()
sage: graphs.PathGraph(30).show()
sage: graphs.PathGraph(100).show()
```

Run those three commands. You will be surprised `:-P`

<a id='comment:13'></a>Thanks for the corrections.

I had to update some doctests since you changed from `Path Graph` to `Path graph`. I had also to update the test on `spring_layout` in `generic_graph.py` line 15174.

And yes, the layout of the path is pretty cool ;)
