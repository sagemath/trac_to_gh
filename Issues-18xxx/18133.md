The Orlik-Solomon algebra is a fundamental invariant for an arrangement, which also enables computing scads of useful information about e.g. the complement.  But it's purely algebraic.  So we should have it (see also #17506).

That was going to be my argument.

> but first of all I'm not sure whether the CombinatorialFreeModule framework will keep accepting such monomials in the future,


It should because those checks are expensive and there has to be a way to tell this proposed CFM that you know what you're doing (especially in internal methods like `_from_dict`).

> and second I cannot guarantee that the multiplication as you implemented it still works with this implementation of `_reduce_broken_circuit`.

That is how the product was designed and why it worked. Although now you've basically pushed that into the recursive step. This also has an effect of making it recursive. Have you done some timing benchmarks between the two implementations?

Also this is bad:

```
if not type(S) == frozenset:
```
You should use the pythonic (and more robust if we replace it by some subclass of `frozenset`):

```
if not isinstance(S, frozenset):
```
I can change this though.

> Another issue is the `algebra_generators`: You're setting the `i`-th generator to be `self.monomial(frozenset([i]))`, but this too might be malformed. (For example, if `M` is a uniform matroid `U_{n,1} = matroids.Uniform(1,n)`, then all basis elements are equal, which means that they cannot be distinct basis elements.)


This is a good point. Good catch.

Thank you for taking a look at it and pushing some changes.

I can easily change this so the default is the base ring of the arrangement, but it can take another base ring as input. Although I think it carries less meaning in terms of studying the arrangement, but I'm not that much of an expert to know for certain.
