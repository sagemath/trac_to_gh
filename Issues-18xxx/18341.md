Sphinx is built from `Sphinx-1.2.2.tar.gz`. it turns out that `sage -sh sage-fix-pkg-checksums`, that computes the checksums, will treat only lower-case-named tarballs ... except on Macs, whose filesystems will find `Sphinx-1.2.2.tar.gz` when asked for `sphinx-1.2.2.tar.gz`. See #18229 for discussion.

This is documented in the [Developer's guide](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/packaging.html), paragraph "Directory structure", that states :

> "The build scripts and associated files are in a subdirectory SAGE_ROOT/build/pkgs/package, where you replace package with a lower-case version of the upstream project name."

I suppose that the original Sphinx porter might have been a Mac user, and that nobody caught the problem.

It is :
* [Developer's guide](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/packaging.html) requirement, as quoted in the ticket description
* The current sage-fix-spkg-checksums won't update the checksums on anything but a Mac with their pseudo-case-sensitive filesystem. See #18229 for an exchange between François Bissey and myself.


> It builds and the current checksums are correct,

How do you know ? You don't have a way to know that unless you're on a Mac or you're recomputing the checksums by hand (sage-fix-spkg-checksums won't do it on anything but a Mac).

> so...? The next person to update the package can still rename the tarball.

I agree that the lower-case tarball requirement seems odd. It has been a thorn in my bu...err...backside since I started to keep R up-to-date. But the problem exists, and won't go away until the parts of the build system that are tarball-case-sensitive are fixed.

I posted something to that effect on sage-devel. Could we move this discussion  there ?

In the interim, status ==> needs_work.

Not really, that just says something about the name of the directory in `build/pkgs`.

That's true, but is that a reason to rename the tarball now?

Yes : you might get run over by a truck, and the next maintainer of (P|p)illow, who might not be a Mac user, would be stuck with the mess...

... On your Mac ! Or with the current (P|p)illow version. Again, it's the maintenance that seems problematic.

You think that it will make maintaining Pillow easier if we rename the Pillow tarball now? If you *really* believe that, then I guess it's worth renaming the tarball now.

> ... On your Mac !

I don't have a Mac and still my Sage builds fine. The checksums are equally correct on my Linux machine than on somebody else's Mac.
