Matrix plots have the wrong aspect ratio, causing the plot to collapse into a line. Compare:

```
sage: matrix_plot(identity_matrix(3))
sage: matrix_plot(identity_matrix(3), aspect_ratio='automatic')
```

Ok, the root of the problem is in the `get_minmax_data` method of `MatrixPlot`.  This deliberately flips the y axis so that "the picture looks correct.", but it confounds the `_limit_output_aspect_ratio` method of `Graphics` which expects ymax-ymin to be positive.  I see a bunch of choices

1) We can have `output_aspect` be the absolute value of what it is now.  This works but this leaves `ymax < ymin` ready to bite someone else who expects min < max.

2) We can display matrices upside down.  This seems unreasonable.

3) We can flip the xy_data_array in the Matrix plot constructor.  This feels wrongish, it means making a copy of the array.

To me 1 seems the best choice, but I am not familiar enough with the Graphics object to be comfortable with it.

Hope this helps

IMHO 3) is the right thing to do. Any hacks with setting xmin > xmax are just going to bite you later, e.g.

```
sage: matrix_plot(identity_matrix(4)) + plot(x)
```
has arguably always been broken...

Y'all are of course correct.

I have implemented a patch, but it is late and so I'll wait till I'm awake before pushing.

I did notice that the handling of sparse matrices is weird: 

```
sage: i = identity_matrix(10,sparse=True)
sage: matrix_plot(i, aspect_ratio='automatic')
```

Not exactly wrong, but unexpected.  The reason I bring this up is that the `MatrixPlot` constructor accepts scipy sparse matrices in addition to things that act like lists of lists (the advertised interface).  These need to be flipped a bit differently, and while testing that I noticed that the display looked wrong.

Looking through the `matplotlib` method of the `Graphics` object, I see that the `matplotlib` method expects `ymin > ymax` to occur.

The problem with flipping the data is that the default tick labels on the frame end up the reverse of what they should be.  It may be possible to get the ticks reversed simply while dealing with the possibility that the default ticks have been overridden in the options, but I don't see it.

In view of the `matplotlib` method, I'm leaning back in favor of option 1, just taking the absolute value of the `output_aspect`.

Can you give a concrete example of this kind of "user error"?  That might help us decide on an option.

I did not mean a "user error", I meant a "developer error", identical to the error that precipitated this bug.  (As I suspect the set of most regular sage users overlaps considerably with the community of sage developers, this may only be a semantic difference.)  When I see two variables named `xmin` and `xmax`, I assume that `xmin < xmax` and program accordingly.

I am not sure how all of this interacts with sums of plots, which was Volker's point.

Now that I dumped the code, I suspect that the flipping should be done in `_render_in_subplot`.  Oh, well.

Anyway, this sort of works (the y axis labels are wrong), but it is better than collapsing the image to just the y-axis.

The labels on the tic marks on the y axis are the opposite of what they should be.  This might be irksome, but I suspect that most people would find it a minor annoyance, if they even notice, while having no matrix plot is a major annoyance.  It is worth filing another bug about the y axis labels, and I will do that.
