I see a bunch of choices

1) We can have `output_aspect` be the absolute value of what it is now.  This works but this leaves `ymax < ymin` ready to bite someone else who expects min < max.

2) We can display matrices upside down.  This seems unreasonable.

3) We can flip the xy_data_array in the Matrix plot constructor.  This feels wrongish, it means making a copy of the array.

To me 1 seems the best choice, but I am not familiar enough with the Graphics object to be comfortable with it.

Hope this helps

<a id='comment:6'></a>Y'all are of course correct.

I have implemented a patch, but it is late and so I'll wait till I'm awake before pushing.

I did notice that the handling of sparse matrices is weird: 

```
sage: i = identity_matrix(10,sparse=True)
sage: matrix_plot(i, aspect_ratio='automatic')
```

Not exactly wrong, but unexpected.  The reason I bring this up is that the `MatrixPlot` constructor accepts scipy sparse matrices in addition to things that act like lists of lists (the advertised interface).  These need to be flipped a bit differently, and while testing that I noticed that the display looked wrong.

Can you give a concrete example of this kind of "user error"?  That might help us decide on an option.

I did not mean a "user error", I meant a "developer error", identical to the error that precipitated this bug.  (As I suspect the set of most regular sage users overlaps considerably with the community of sage developers, this may only be a semantic difference.)  When I see two variables named `xmin` and `xmax`, I assume that `xmin < xmax` and program accordingly.

I am not sure how all of this interacts with sums of plots, which was Volker's point.
