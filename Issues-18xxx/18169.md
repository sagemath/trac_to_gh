<a id='comment:9'></a>Approximately all modules cite Cohen's book. But each of them has its own reference!

In the main index, there is a section `Number Theory, Algebraic Geometry`. But many modules that you added are in `rings` (like `sage/rings/bernmm`, `sage/rings/bernoulli_mod_p`, `sage/rings/contfrac`, `sage/rings/factorint`, `sage/rings/fast_arith`).

I did some changes and cleaning in number fields. Tell me if you like. I can also try to reorganise the ring section.
