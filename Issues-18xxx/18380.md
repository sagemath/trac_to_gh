The combination

```
class Foo(CombinatorialObject, Element):
    __metaclass__ = ClasscallMetaclass
```

occurs often enough in `combinat` that it makes sense to define a new class for this.

Well, my main reason for this ticket here is to simplify #18329, so I would prefer to merge this ticket quickly and postpone the switch to `ClonableArray` to a different ticket.

> Additionally with your recent work with allowing extension classes to support metaclasses, perhaps we can put the `classcall_metaclass` directly into there?

Well, `ClasscallMetaclass` doesn't quite work yet from Cython. The Cython metaclass mechanism from #18330 is still a bit of a hack and in particular it will not work when the metaclass has attributes.

I tried to make the change and, while it seems easy enough, it will take a little bit of work. So then this will make it easier to move in that direction; positive review.
