The method has the doctest

```
    sage: W=WeylGroup(['C',2],prefix="s")
    sage: r=W.from_reduced_word([1,2,1])
    sage: r.reflection_to_root()
    2*alpha[1] + alpha[2]
    sage: r=W.from_reduced_word([1,2])
    sage: r.reflection_to_root()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ValueError: s1*s2 is not a reflection
```
but if I try W.w0 instead, it runs into an infinite loop.

Would you mind also having a look at #18635 and whether or not that seems reasonable?
