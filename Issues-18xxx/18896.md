Like #18883 is another case of falling through in `Expression.__nonzero__` to calling Maxima which fails, in this case because of its hardcoded 53 bits precision. The reason why Maxima is called at all is that `test_relation()` coerces `lhs()-rhs()` into `CIF` as a catch-all. The result passes `is_zero()` so `NotImplemented` is returned.
