Sage immediately returns exact expressions for trig. functions with argument a multiple of `pi/3`, `pi/4`, `pi/6` and some of `pi/5` because they are just square roots. The other values of e.g. `sin(n*pi/5)` are quite simple too, but they are roots of 4-degree so they were not added.

```
sage: sin(3*pi/4)
1/2*sqrt(2)
sage: sec(3*pi/5)
-4/(sqrt(5) - 1)
sage: cos(3*pi/5)
-1/4*sqrt(5) + 1/4
sage: sin(3*pi/5)
sin(3/5*pi)
sage: tan(3*pi/5)
tan(3/5*pi)
sage: cot(3*pi/5)
cot(3/5*pi)
sage: cos(pi/6)
1/2*sqrt(3)
```
However, people expect this so they should be added.
