I installed the packages gmp and then 4ti2 in my copy of Sage 6.5. 

When building 4ti2, it does not detect GMP and consequently only builds the fixed-precision version of the code, not the GMP version of the code. 
However, the GMP version is unconditionally used by sage.interfaces.four_ti_2

 

Depends on #18240

This is most probably not a big issue, unless you must use GMP interface provided by GMP rather than GMP interface provided by MPIR. The latter is standard in Sage, and does not need to be installed (and cannot be removed).
(although this is certainly confusing)

I will have a look.

here are more details; without optional GMP package installed, one still gets 4ti2gmp built by doing `sage -i 4ti2`; its linkage is as follows:

```
$ ldd local/bin/4ti2gmp 
	linux-vdso.so.1 =>  (0x00007fffd2179000)

	libz.so.1 => /home/dima/software/sage.6.6/sage/local/lib/libz.so.1 (0x00007f5ff3759000)
```
it looks as it is linked against GMP, but this is just a differently named copy of MPIR.

and after `sage -i gmp` followed by `sage -f 4ti2` (i.e. re-installing 4ti2 with GMP from GMP) I still get 4ti2gmp built, with the following weird linkage:

```
$ ldd local/bin/4ti2gmp

	libgmp.so.16 => /home/dima/software/sage.6.6/sage/local/lib/libgmp.so.16 (0x00007f2376c66000)
```
here we see  that it picked up both GMP from GMP, i.e. libmp.so.10 and GMP from MPIR, i.e. libgmp.so.16. 

Is this what you are getting, as well?

Thanks for looking into this, Dima.

I was using the Sage 6.5 binaries for Mac OS X (I should have said that).
Now I updated to Sage 6.6, again using the binaries. 

This is what I get if I do NOT install the gmp package first.

```

```

If I do install gmp first, it looks the same. 

Later I can try a Sage compiled from source; but in any case it seems there needs to be more testing in place to catch this build error on this platform.

It perhaps should be said clearly in the docs that the binary distributions of Sage cannot do all the building right; it can deal with Python and Cython, but installing optional packages that build libraries might not work. 

Be warned that the latest XCode (6.3) for OSX 10.10 is quite broken and cannot build Sage at the moment, IIRC. One has to have 6.2 instead.

Thanks a lot. I managed to build from source from git off 6.7.beta0 after downgrading to XCode 6.2.
The problem persists.

please provide the full log of the 4ti2 build; it is in SAGEROOT/logs/pkgs/4ti2.log; (you can upload it as an attachment on this ticket).

Usual causes for such a thing is that you have another installation of GMP that gets into the picture, the one that comes from macports/homebrew, or that you have something funny in your PATH. But perhaps it's something more profound, platform (OSX) specific.

oops, this is a bug in MPIR; reported here, https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/Tu-egDn-zLw/0S5ouau2J1AJ
but not yet fixed (basically, can be worked around by editing mpir.h and gmp.h).

This happens after we went to gcc 4.9, where this shows up.

Nothing to do with binary vs source distributions, either, mea culpa.
