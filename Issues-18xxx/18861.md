It seems that the three following functions are not used anywhere

```
(polgraph|✚2…)~/sage/geometry$ grep _make_polyh . -R
./polyhedron/base.py:#    _make_polyhedron_face.
./polyhedron/base.py:    def _make_polyhedron_face(self, Vindices, Hindices):
./polyhedron/base.py:            sage: square._make_polyhedron_face((0,2), (1,))
./polyhedron/base.py:            return self._make_polyhedron_face(Vindices, Hindices)
(polgraph|✚2…)~/sage/geometry$ grep _init_fac . -R  
./polyhedron/base.py:#    _init_facet_adjacency_matrix, _init_vertex_adjacency_matrix, and
./polyhedron/backend_cdd.py:    def _init_facet_adjacency_matrix(self, verbose=False):
./polyhedron/backend_cdd.py:            sage: p._init_facet_adjacency_matrix()
(polgraph|✚2…)~/sage/geometry$ grep _init_vertex . -R
./polyhedron/base.py:#    _init_facet_adjacency_matrix, _init_vertex_adjacency_matrix, and

./polyhedron/backend_cdd.py:            sage: p._init_vertex_adjacency_matrix()
```

Should they be removed, or used somewhere?

With sage8.9:

```
sage/src/sage/geometry$ grep _make_polyh . -R
./polyhedron/base.py:#    _make_polyhedron_face.
./polyhedron/base.py:    def _make_polyhedron_face(self, Vindices, Hindices):
./polyhedron/base.py:            sage: square._make_polyhedron_face((0,2), (1,)).ambient_V_indices()
./polyhedron/base.py:            return self._make_polyhedron_face(Vindices, Hindices)
sage/src/sage/geometry$ grep _init_fac . -R
sage/src/sage/geometry$ grep _init_vertex . -R
```

This has been indirectly taken care of. The first function is used in `face_lattice`.

For this reason, I would set this as a "won't fix".

It turns out that it can simply be deleted and merged into the already present function.

... when `face_lattice` will be renovated through CombinatorialPolyhedron the face lattice function will change again, but it will make the transition a bit easier. So I would say it is a good first step.

I looked at it and I think that the first two items are not correct:

what happened is

- the method `_make_polyhedron_face` is removed.
- the only place where it was used was related to an internally defined function `face_constructor` inside of the `face_lattice` method.

So, I believe that the import should be inside the internal function, right?

Thus, there is no need of the self argument.

I changed the if statement. Let's see what the bot says, just to make sure that the calls are correct. If I looked correctly, it should essentially be the same, but only function call less...
