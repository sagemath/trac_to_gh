Canonically relabeling a (semi)lattice should return a (semi)lattice. (Compare to `.relabel()`.)

```
sage: graphs.PetersenGraph().canonical_label(certify=True)
(Graph on 10 vertices,
 {0: 9, 1: 8, 2: 5, 3: 4, 4: 6, 5: 7, 6: 2, 7: 3, 8: 1, 9: 0})

Yep, that's the idea. Though you can avoid creating a copy of the graph by:
1) computing the canonical label on _hasse_diagram
2) "relabel the canonical label" using the correspondance between _hasse_diagram vertices and poset vertices
3) call relabel on the poset itself with the "relabelled" canonical label

Hello !

> Why those `# random` parts on doctests?


Because the doctests wrongly assume that the canonical label should never change. We had this problem with bliss: the canonical labels it returns are different from the ones returned by 'native' Sage.

A labelling is 'canonical' in the sense that two isomorphic object will be relabelled to the same object. This being said, nothing says that a canonical label never changes in time, and in particular the documentation of Nauty says explicitly that it will.

> And isn't `sorted` unneeded, as the order of 'a' and 'b' is always the same?


I am not sure. These letters will be stored on dictionaries, and you never know what happens with dictionaires on different architectures. Anyway I removed that, because of your next comment:

After canonical relabeling we should be sure of the *elements* of the poset, even if not sure of their *position*, i.e. cover relations. Hence I removed a `# random`. But it seems that `sorted` does not work. Strange, what did I forgot?

I also moved a part of documentation from tests to examples.
