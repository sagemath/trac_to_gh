Packages which are known to fail optional doctests or which do not install on all supported platforms should be "experimental", not "optional".

Packages moved to experimental:
* `4ti2`: doesn't pass optional doctests
* `autotools`: breaks installation of Singular if `xz` is not installed
* `compilerwrapper`: totally breaks building Sage on OS X
* `fricas`: doesn't pass optional doctests
* `gap_packages`: doesn't pass optional doctests
* `latte_int`: doesn't pass optional doctests
* `topcom`: doesn't pass doctests, even breaks non-optional tests
* `valgrind`: doesn't build on OS X 10.10

Other problematic packages, not changed here:
* `arb`: doesn't build on OS X: fixed by #18560
* `dot2tex`: see #18124
* `gdb`: does not work properly on OS X: live with it
* `tides`: see #18573

I plan to consider only new-style packages in this ticket, is the mirror thing still relevant?

Indeed, in this case you don't need to.

That's OS X 10.9 which is indeed fine. The problem is that it explicitly does not work on OS X 10.10:

```
checking for a supported OS... ok (darwin14.3.0)

Funny. Well, anyway they seem to say that the latest svn version handles it. Good news.

Oh, by the way I am about write a ticket so that `sage -i <experimental_package>` shows the same warning we have when the package is a new-style package.

I cannot say that I like this much. We already have base/standard/optional/experimental packages, old-style spkgs and new-style spkgs. What would be the advantage of alternative packages?
