Nazarov's 1996 paper titled "Young's Orthogonal Form for Brauer's Centralizer Algebra," outlines a form for the Jucys-Murphy elements that are analogous to the JM elements for the symmetric group algebra. Implementing these into Sage would require a few lines of code but would prove very useful for work done with the Brauer algebra.
