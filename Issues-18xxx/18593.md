Increased the tolerance by an order of magnitude, so test now passes.

just curious, I'd like to investigate more. Here is what I get with Sage 6.8.beta1 on my workstation:

```
sage: A = matrix(RDF, [[1,3,2],[1,4,2],[0,5,2],[1,3,2]]); A

sage: Z = transpose(A)*A; Z
[ 3.0 10.0  6.0]
[10.0 59.0 30.0]
[ 6.0 30.0 16.0]
sage: Z.solve_right(R)
(-1.5000000000000049, -0.5000000000000011, 2.750000000000004)
sage: from sage.misc.citation import get_systems
sage: get_systems('Z.solve_right(R)')
['numpy', 'scipy']
```
What do you get on the machine where the test did fail?

One should not expect the numerical garbage to be reproducible when changing architectures: even if basic operations are compliant with the IEEE norm, the way they are scheduled (by the compiler or programmer) impacts the numerical noise.
Looking at the condition number (1222), we can assume that up to 3 digits can be lost. So the bug was indeed that the tolerance was probably set to a too low value.

I ran directly the LAPACK degesv implementation of GotoBLAS-2.11 on various architectures and got the following values:

x = [-1.5000000000000067 ,-0.50000000000000389 ,2.7500000000000098] for Intel Haswell, SandyBridge and Westmere, AMD K8, 
x = [-1.4999999999999918 ,-0.49999999999999678 ,2.7499999999999911] for AMD Bulldozer
x = [-1.5000000000000135 ,-0.50000000000000855 ,2.7500000000000213] for AMD K10
