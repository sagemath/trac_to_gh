Using the elementary crystals `B_i`, we can iterate the following crystal morphism `B(oo) \to B_i \otimes B(oo)` to obtain a crystal model for `B(oo)`. This ticket implements this model by using the fact that one only requires a finite list.

I pushed some changes to the documentation.  If you are okay with them (and see no either new or missed mistakes), then you may set this to positive review on my behalf.
