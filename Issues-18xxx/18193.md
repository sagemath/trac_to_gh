Fix the CompleteDyckWords_size behaviour for negative size argument.

Before the change:

```
sage: DyckWords(-1)
Dyck words with -1 opening parentheses and -1 closing parentheses
sage: DyckWords(-1).cardinality()
...
ZeroDivisionError: 
sage: DyckWords(-2).cardinality()
0
sage: list(DyckWords(0))
[[]]
sage: list(DyckWords(-1))
[[0]]
sage: list(DyckWords(-2))
[[0]] 
sage: DyckWords(-1).random_element() in DyckWords(-1)
False
```

After the change:

```
sage: DyckWords(-1)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
...
ValueError: k1 (= -1) must be nonnegative
```
