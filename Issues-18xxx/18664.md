I add two bases for noncommutative symmetric functions, and update a reference in the qsym.py file.

This is mostly Franco's code, with minor modifications from me.

Hey Amy and Franco,

You will need to rebase this off the latest `develop` and make sure all functions have doctests (some don't have docstrings). I would also just move the `_register_coercion_` method into the `__init__` (so really you're removing that method). Also the `_to_complete_on_generator` has a misaligned docstring. I'd also change the `if n == 0 or n == 1:` to `if n <= 1`.

I would also use:

```python
def _from_complete_on_basis(self, I):
    n = I.size()
    m = self._complete_to_zassenhaus_transition_matrix(n).invers()
    C = Compositions(n)
    i = C.rank(I)    # this is typically faster than list(C).index(I)
    return self._from_dict({comp: m[i,j] for j,comp in enumerate(C)})
```
Actually, since you only use the inverses, I would cache the inverse matrices instead.

On a more optimization point (which is not necessary to handle now):

```python
for partition in Partitions(n):
    if len(partition) > 1:
        ...
```
I would instead do this:

```python
P = Partitions(6)
it = iter(P)
it.next()
for p in it:
    ...
```
If you really wanted to go crazy with optimization, I'd use

```python
from sage.combinat.partitions import ZS1_iterator
it = ZS1_iterator(n)
it.next()
for p in it:
    d = {}
    for part in self:
        d[part] = d.get(part, 0) + 1
    coeff = prod(factorial(d[e]) for e in d)
    ...
```
Yet as I said, that's going crazy.
