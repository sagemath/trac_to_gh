Sage lacks a lot of feature that are in Latte:
- fast integer point counting in polyhedron
- computation of Ehrart polynomial
just to mention some of them.

Note that Latte has no documentation for its library (only the various command line does have). So it might be nice to ask whether it is stable accross versions to upstream.

By constraints. Actually it would be quite straightforward to have an implementation creating a temporary file and just call `count` on this file. The input is basically the same as `cdd` as defined in `sage.geometry.polyhedron.cdd_file_format`.

But the aim of the ticket is to implement a more direct interface (Matthias Koeppe developing latte is in the loop). Though there is also some work needed from latte side.

...only?

It is required that the vertices are lattice points?

I ask because `Polyhedron()` in Sage always computes the vertices. I know from #17920 that this step sometimes takes more time than enumerating the points. So if you really want efficiency, you would want a way to define a `Polyhedron` *without* computing its vertices.

LattE's input is either the vertices (V-rep) or the inequalities (H-rep). 
It computes the other representation of the polyhedron (and makes other polyhedral computations) by calling either cddlib, or 4ti2.
(Ideally, there should be a way to feed both representations into LattE to avoid recomputation, but this is not implemented.)

@jdemeyer: The vertices can be rational.

In fact, when "count" is invoked with --cdd, then CDD file format is accepted. 

So building a preliminary interface should indeed be very easy.
