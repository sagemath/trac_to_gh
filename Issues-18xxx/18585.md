Currently, the default `_cmp_` is written with dense polynomials in mind since it creates an `xrange` of size the degree of the polynomial. For sparse polynomials which can have very high degree, this is a problem:

```python
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(ZZ, sparse=True)
sage: x^2^100 == x^2^100
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
OverflowError: Python int too large to convert to C long
```

The patch introduces a `_cmp_` method in the class `Polynomial_generic_sparse` to get rid of this problem:

```python
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(ZZ, sparse=True)
sage: x^2^100 == x^2^100
True
```

Note, as a side comment, that the comparison is faster for polynomials that are indeed sparse with the new code, while the timings are equivalent for quite dense polynomials.

Without the patch:

```python 
sage: %timeit x^100 == x^100
1000 loops, best of 3: 224 µs per loop
```

With the patch:

```python
sage: %timeit x^100 == x^100
The slowest run took 7.61 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
10000 loops, best of 3: 24.6 µs per loop
```

Done, with the added `keys1.sort()` before the `reverse()`.

This is to comply with the default `_cmp_` method for polynomials: for instance `-2x^2 > x` but `x^3 - 2x^2 < x^3 + x`. A larger degree polynomial is always greater than a lower degree polynomial, but then when the coefficients are compared, `0` is greater than a negative coefficient.


I add a question: I noticed after your remark than the method `exponents()` could be improved. This is now implemented as 

```python
        return [c[0] for c in sorted(self.__coeffs.iteritems())] 
```
while it would be faster (from my testing) to replace it by

```python
        keys = self.__coeffs.keys()
        keys.sort()
        return keys
```
Is that right to make the change in this ticket (since it is a rather minor change) or is it more appropriate to open a new one?

That's fine with me.

And could you add a doctest like

```
sage: Rd = PolynomialRing(ZZ, 'x', sparse=False)
sage: Rs = PolynomialRing(ZZ, 'x', sparse=True)
sage: for _ in range(100):
....:     pd = Rd.random_element()
....:     qd = Rd.random_element()
....:     assert cmp(pd,qd) == cmp(Rs(pd), Rs(qd))
```

sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(ZZ, sparse=True)
sage: p = R({0:1, 1:0, 2:1}, check=False)
sage: p

sage: p.dict()

```
I doubt this happens often in practice, but since this is possible, I am quite reluctant to remove the test.

Dough! I was asking because for sparse matrices it is explicitely mentioned in the specification that no value can be zero. And this is very useful!

What do you think about opening a ticket about enforcing non-zero values in the dictionary?

I am in favor of opening a ticket to add this specification, though I am not in favor of removing the `check=False` option that can be useful at some places to get (slightly) faster code.

`matrix_generic_sparse.pyx`, main docstring line 69-71

```
    A generic sparse matrix is
    represented using a dictionary whose keys are pairs of integers `(i,j)` and
    values in the base ring. The values of the dictionary must never be zero.

I now understand that it only due to `check=False`. In the case `check=True` (which is the default) zeros are removed. So I would assume that there **never** are zero value in the dictionary. One only needs to specify it in the documentation.

You could have a look at the implementation of `degree`. It does not check if the values are zero or not. It just assumes that values are nonzero.

Right. I guess we actually agree (though my previous comment was maybe unclear). 
 
> You could have a look at the implementation of `degree`. It does not check if the values are zero or not. It just assumes that values are nonzero.


True. And this is also the case of `_repr`:

```
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(ZZ, sparse=True)
sage: R({0:1,1:0}, check=False)
 + 1
```

So we actually already assume that coefficients in the dictionary are nonzero. I'll add it in the specifications.
