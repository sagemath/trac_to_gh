```
Currently, the default `_cmp_` is written with dense polynomials in mind since it creates an `xrange` of size the degree of the polynomial. For sparse polynomials which can have very high degree, this is a problem:

```python
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(ZZ, sparse=True)
sage: x^2^100 == x^2^100
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
OverflowError: Python int too large to convert to C long
```

The patch introduces a `_cmp_` method in the class `Polynomial_generic_sparse` to get rid of this problem:

```python
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(ZZ, sparse=True)
sage: x^2^100 == x^2^100
True
```

Note, as a side comment, that the comparison is faster for polynomials that are indeed sparse with the new code, while the timings are equivalent for quite dense polynomials.

Without the patch:

```python 
sage: %timeit x^100 == x^100
1000 loops, best of 3: 224 µs per loop
```

With the patch:

```python
sage: %timeit x^100 == x^100
The slowest run took 7.61 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
10000 loops, best of 3: 24.6 µs per loop
```

Hello,

1. You can replace

```
keys1 = list(reversed(sorted(d1.keys())))
```
  with

```
keys1 = d1.keys()
keys1.reverse()
```

2. Instead of looking at the length, you can do

```
if not keys1 and not keys2: return 0
if not keys1: return -1
if not keys2: return 1
```

3. Why the first key is treated differently?

Done, with the added `keys1.sort()` before the `reverse()`.

This is to comply with the default `_cmp_` method for polynomials: for instance `-2x^2 > x` but `x^3 - 2x^2 < x^3 + x`. A larger degree polynomial is always greater than a lower degree polynomial, but then when the coefficients are compared, `0` is greater than a negative coefficient.


I add a question: I noticed after your remark than the method `exponents()` could be improved. This is now implemented as 

```python
        return [c[0] for c in sorted(self.__coeffs.iteritems())] 
```
while it would be faster (from my testing) to replace it by

```python
        keys = self.__coeffs.keys()
        keys.sort()
        return keys
```
Is that right to make the change in this ticket (since it is a rather minor change) or is it more appropriate to open a new one?

That's fine with me.

And could you add a doctest like

```
sage: Rd = PolynomialRing(ZZ, 'x', sparse=False)
sage: Rs = PolynomialRing(ZZ, 'x', sparse=True)
sage: for _ in range(100):
....:     pd = Rd.random_element()
....:     qd = Rd.random_element()
....:     assert cmp(pd,qd) == cmp(Rs(pd), Rs(qd))
```

Dough! I was asking because for sparse matrices it is explicitely mentioned in the specification that no value can be zero. And this is very useful!

There is no such specification as for matrices. There is a method `__normalize()` to remove the zero coefficients, used by default in `__init__`, and used for instance in the multiplication (since there may be some cancellations).

I am in favor of opening a ticket to add this specification, though I am not in favor of removing the `check=False` option that can be useful at some places to get (slightly) faster code.

`matrix_generic_sparse.pyx`, main docstring line 69-71

```
    A generic sparse matrix is
    represented using a dictionary whose keys are pairs of integers `(i,j)` and
    values in the base ring. The values of the dictionary must never be zero.

I now understand that it only due to `check=False`. In the case `check=True` (which is the default) zeros are removed. So I would assume that there **never** are zero value in the dictionary. One only needs to specify it in the documentation.

You could have a look at the implementation of `degree`. It does not check if the values are zero or not. It just assumes that values are nonzero.

Right. I guess we actually agree (though my previous comment was maybe unclear).

True. And this is also the case of `_repr`:

```
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(ZZ, sparse=True)
sage: R({0:1,1:0}, check=False)
 + 1
```

So we actually already assume that coefficients in the dictionary are nonzero. I'll add it in the specifications.
