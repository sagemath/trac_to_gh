I don't know when it got broken - I was thinking I should check how animations work in SageMathCell with my recent changes and discovered they don't work at all in Sage.

The real problem is that they were not even tested.

And my concern with changes on this ticket is that it will break `a.show(delay=10)` in user code.

But if it is up to me to decide, this is not a blocker.

What exactly do you mean by “its all broken”? It would be kind of nice if the problem report were to report the problem, before suggesting a fix… In any case, I'm on 6.6.beta1 here, using the Sage notebook, and with imagemagick 6.9.0.3 installed on my system. And animations with delay and iterations do work for me. To be more specific,

```
sage: a = animate([sin(x + float(k)) for k in srange(0,2*pi,0.3)], xmin=0, xmax=2*pi, figsize=[2,1])
sage: a.show(delay=10, iterations=2) # shows at higher frame rate then stops
sage: a.show(delay=500)              # shows at lower frame rate
```

So what *exactly* is broken?

> I tried to preserve the delay parameter, but then I don't even know what its supposed to mean.

The doc says correctly:
* delay between frames (measured in hundredths of a second, default value 20)
* (default: 20) delay in hundredths of a second between frames

This is used throughout the public Animation class. You might argue that it's a suboptimal choice, but it's what the GIF spec uses, what most animated GIF editors use, and what Sage has been using so far.

> Sometimes its the numerator of some fraction (with a separate `delay_denominator`. Sometimes its centiseconds, because thats super-convenient right. Never mind why you would ever pass a fraction as separate numerator/denominator in Sage.

That's in the APngAssembler I wrote, and it's there that way because I consider the APngAssembler a low-level interface, and the low level spec of APNG uses that representation for rational numbers. I saw no reason to complicate things further by introducing my own translation layer, and I didn't consider `delay_denominator` harmful enough to fix it at 100 instead of leaving the caller an option to override this.

For movies, yes. For animated GIFs, in my experience no. I wouldn't mind having `fps` as an *additional* argument, so users can choose between specifying that or `delay`. But I'd not kill off the `delay` argument without proper deprecation. And don't you dare call this spacebar heating!

By the same line of argument I suggest we replace seconds everywhere with jiffies, since this is what the kernel developers use. If you go to the movies, whats the frame delay in centiseconds? How many frames per second? ;-)

What **is** broken:
* testing (0% coverage unless you specifically set --optional)
* save doesn't respect delay, iterations (show goes through save)

It can? A quick search of the web returned several posts where people talked about animated GIF read support, or the absence of write support, or asked about write support and got no answer. If you are certain about this, and perhaps even know an address with some documentation, could you open a ticket for this?

> In any case, not every optional argument for every potential image file format needs to be exposed via `show()`

We had that discussion in [#7298 comment:50](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/7298#comment:50) and following, and I still disagree. Let's continue this aspect in [this thread](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/a0yUaC1FG5I/SNhdSFWYqIkJ) on the sage-devel list, so we can get more opinons on this.
