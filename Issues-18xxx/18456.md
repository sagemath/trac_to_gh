What was fixed in #18407 (one week ago) has been broken since `:-P`

That's because the website went mostly down. Also, that new version handles both old-style spkg and new-style spkg.

Hello !

> I insstalled the branch and did "make" which rebuilt a very large amount.


This is suspicious. As you can see from the branch's diff, it only touches one file (i.e. sage/misc/package.py) which is not a dependency of anything as far as I know. I just did a checkout on the branch, and no recompilation was triggered at all.

> which also failed.  SO I don't exactly know what it is that I am supposed to be testing!


This branch fixes the three functions `standard_packages`, `optional_packages`, and `experimental_packages` defined in `sage/misc/package.py`. The script `sage -standard` script does not call them.

In order to fix `sage -standard`, it makes more sense to make it call a Sage function that does the job. Previously, `standard_packages` ran `sage -standard` and parsed its output: it would be better to have `sage -standard` call `standard_packages` (without any parsing).

That would require changing the output or `standard_packages`, as currently it only returns the list of packages without including the version numbers.

Yep, totally. If it can be of interest to you, I use a short bash script that downloads a branch for me, and merges it with my current beta. This way, I never go back to an earlier version of sage and I avoid these problems.

About `sage -standard`: I added a commit at public/18456v2 that makes it work again, though without the version number.

I can add it to this ticket if you want.

Well, if it doesn't work as is then it cannot get a positive review anyway, so I have changed it to "needs work" and can try again after you have added what is needed to make it work!

You got me wrong: it does not work in the latest beta either. None of the two work. And this ticket fixes one of the two.

Hello guys,

I wrote this fix for `sage -standard` because that is what everybody seems attracted to, but really my goal here is only to fix `standard_packages` (and others) so that I can use them in #18408. And then, in turn, update #18405.

Right now, everything is broken. And I personally prefer by far to have the `*_package` functions get ther info directly from the server than parse the output of a command-line tool as it is done at the moment.

That's what I tried first, i.e. fix `sage --standard`. But then you have some problems, like undefined environment variables, and you must re-parse everything in `standard_packages` again.

I thought a bit about making this script dependent on sage, and I actually ended up wondering whether .... we need those `sage -standard` scripts. Right now they are totally broken, and... Well, if we do not need them then perhaps we should stop maintaining them. They returned outdated information long before they broke.

Okay. Third fix.

This one fixes the three functions AND the `sage -standard` commands (which do not need Sage to be compiled). The executable now has a 'dump' options so that there is not much parsing left to do on Sage's side when running that script to get some info.

When it will be reviewed, I will be able to add a cool feature: automatic test of (installed) optional packages.

I can create a new branch with this change and either of the earlier ones if you want. Or you can do it.

There are no doctests for `_package_lists_from_sage_output(..., version=True)`, nor does the `OUTPUT` block explain the output in that case.

For `version=True`, I would actually propose to change the output format to a list of triples `(package_name, installed_version, latest_version)`, where `installed_version` is `None` if the package is not installed and `latest_version` is the newest available version. If, for example, `arb-2.5.0` is installed but `arb-2.6.0` is availble, then one such triple would be

```
('arb', '2.5.0', '2.6.0')
```
If `arb` is not installed:

```
('arb', None, '2.6.0')
```

Since this function would be quite different from `_package_lists_from_sage_output`, perhaps there should be two functions: `_package_lists_from_sage_output` and `_package_versions_from_sage_output` or something...

I added a commit that displays column names when '--dump' is not used. The columns change a lot depending on which flags are used, and so this code is not exactly the one you proposed.

I do not mind, you can open a ticket if you need this feature.
