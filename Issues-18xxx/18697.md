```
sage: 0.1 * cos(pi/13)
0.100000000000000*cos(1/13*pi)
```
This is annoying because the `0.1` at once limits the precision of any other non-symbolic expression.

Partial "fix" of Sage code removed, it was actually an unrelated Pynac issue, which is fixed in 0.4.2.

The problem with this ticket is shown by

```
    sage: pi + RBF(1)
```
The expected output would be `[4.141592653589793 +/- 5.61e-16]`, i.e. the same as with `RBF(pi) + RBF(1)`. Constant conversions thus need to take the right parent into account. There may be multiple incompatible parents and that fact may be hidden deep in the expression tree.

This is not a problem because we are evaluating depth-first. The only problem at all seems de-facto limited precision constants, in spite of #18255. Also this might be in the way: https://github.com/pynac/pynac/issues/311
