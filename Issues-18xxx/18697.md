sage: 0.1 * cos(pi/13)
0.100000000000000*cos(1/13*pi)
```
This is annoying because the `0.1` at once limits the precision of any other non-symbolic expression.

This is not a problem because we are evaluating depth-first. The only problem at all seems de-facto limited precision constants, in spite of #18255. Also this might be in the way: https://github.com/pynac/pynac/issues/311
