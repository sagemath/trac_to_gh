the way it is implemented, your function works for both. And I do not personally mind if  `is_sublattice`  also works on lists.

On the other hand, with the current implementation the antichain on 5 elements is a sublattice of the chain on 5 elements.

This and `sublattice()`? Why? For example for sets we have a function to get subsets and another checking if a set is a subset of another set.

Semantics are wrong if A.is_sublattice(B) means that B is a sublattice of A. Changed to `has_sublattice`. I also removed possibility to check of being a really sublattice, i.e. input is only assumed to be a list or like.

> Could you please merge the two? The second function, by itself, is incorrect.


I corrected the (stupid) bug in hasse_diagram.

If I constantly call `meet()` it will slow down computation. If I directly reference to `_meet`, I'll break encapsulation. Then for example changing hasse_diagram to use list of lists instead of matrix will break the function.

Hello !

Could you add an example when the 'lattice' is given as a `Lattice` object? Logically, it could even be the first kind of examples you give, and you could then add that "it also works when 'other' is any iterable'".

Also, it seems that the code does not work as expected when 'other' contains points which are not in `self`. That's a trivial 'no', but it should not be an exception.

I guess that it is mostly an error from the user if he/she ask if `{1,2}` is a sublattice of a lattice containing `a`, `b` and `a`. So raising an exceptions sounds better.

But totally another thing is a list vs. a lattice as a parameter. They feels two different things.

That's an inconsistency between graphs and posets

```
sage: p = Poset()
sage: p.le(1,3)
...
ValueError: element (=1) not in poset
sage: g = Graph()
sage: g.has_edge(1,3)
False
```

Soooooo okay for an exception!

Well, a `Lattice` is an iterable container of vertices, isn't it? And you just can't have a `.has_sublattice(X)` function that does not accept a lattice as input `O_o`

Duh.

But it would mean that after `L1=LatticePoset({1:[2]}); L2=L2.dual()` we would have `L2` *not* a subposet of L1 but `L1.has_sublattice(L2)` would return `True`.

Right, right. And returning `True` is precisely what your branch does:

```
sage: L1=LatticePoset({1:[2]})
sage: L2=L1.dual()
sage: L1.has_sublattice(L2)
True

Could you add a test for when `other` is not a lattice? I'm slightly worried about

```sage
if not hasattr(other, 'meet') or not hasattr(other, 'join'):
    raise TypeError('other is not a lattice')
```
Somewhat independent, I think it would be better to do something like:

```sage
try:
    M, J = other.meet, other.join
except (AttributeError):
    raise TypeError('other is not a lattice')
```
which is more Pythonic and easily extends if `meet` and `join` end up raising other errors at some point.
