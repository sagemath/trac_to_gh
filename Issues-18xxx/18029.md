Some of the cython code in `sage/geometry/integral_points.pyx` can be optimized a lot (properly defining the types of objects, use the `set_unsafe` feature from #17562) and more.

Depends on #17562

I was able to get ~15% speedup:

```
sage: sage: ieqs = [(-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1),
....:         (0, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),
....:         (0, -1, 0, 2, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0),
....:         (0, 0, -1, -1, 2, -1, 0, 0, 0),
....:         (0, 2, 0, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),
....:         (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1, 2),
....:         (1, 0, 2, 0, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0),
....:         (0, 0, 0, 0, -1, 2, -1, 0, 0),
....:         (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1),
....:         (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1, 2, -1, 0),
....:         (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1, 2, -1)]
sage: P = Polyhedron(ieqs=ieqs)
sage: %time len(P.integral_points())
CPU times: user 12.4 s, sys: 5 Âµs, total: 12.4 s
Wall time: 12.4 s
4
```
In the current version, this takes ~14s. There is also some improvement for the simplex approach:

```
sage: from sage.geometry.integral_points import simplex_points
sage: v = [(1,0,7,-1), (-2,-2,4,-3), (-1,-1,-1,4), (2,9,0,-5), (-2,-1,5,1)] 
sage: simplex = Polyhedron(v); simplexA 4-dimensional polyhedron in ZZ^4 defined as the convex hull of 5 vertices
sage: %timeit len(simplex_points(simplex.vertices()))
100 loops, best of 3: 15.1 ms per loop
```
vs

```
10 loops, best of 3: 24.1 ms per loop
```

I used all the tricks that I know to squeeze speed out with doing any rewrites. However, it would be better to implement/use a priority queue (or linked list) data structure instead of a straight list for the inequalities since we are often moving one to the front as part of the algorithm.
Yet I think this is a good gain and should be included in the present state (unless someone feels like doing something more invasive, which I would then review).

This looks fine, but let me point out that the performance of this code is very far from the state of the art.
The first example in dimension 8 is solved by normaliz in 0.1s (I have attached an input file for normaliz). So a simple interface to normaliz (#20885) would bring huge speedups.

Sorry, I found one other place where I got another `.4s` in the above example.

That's quite a difference, and it would be great to have it available (and be extremely useful to me to have integral points that fast). I don't know how much I could help it writing the interface; I know somewhat how to write the cython bindings, but not what to use/expose from noraliz. I will definitely be happy to review it.

You need to use an `except` value when you have a `c(p)def` function with a return type: replace `cpdef bint ...(...)` by `cpdef bint ...(...) except -1`.

And since you seem to like Cython micro-optimizations a lot in this ticket, you missed an obvious one: setting the `boundscheck` and `wraparound` [directives](http://docs.cython.org/src/reference/compilation.html#compiler-directives) to `False` to speed up list indexing.
