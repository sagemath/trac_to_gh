Wow. Glad to see that it is actually possible to remove code from Sage. I always thought that it was 'politically impossible' to remove anything from this software, but fortunately I seem to be wrong.

What would you think of removing `BipartiteGraph` while we are at it ? This class' design is awful:

```
sage: g=BipartiteGraph()
sage: l=[(0,1),(3,2),(1,2),(0,3)]
sage: for e in l:
....:     g.add_edge(e)
RuntimeError: Edge vertices must lie in different partitions.
```

but

```
sage: g = Graph()
sage: g.add_edges(l)
sage: g.is_bipartite()
True
```

Also, I just noticed that one can very easily build a non-bipartite `BipartiteGraph`::

```
sage: g = BipartiteGraph()
sage: g.add_edges(graphs.CompleteGraph(30).edges())
sage: g.is_bipartite()
False
```

Please. Can you help me get rid of that class? I'll write the ticket if you agree.

At some point it was claimed that it was "for teaching purposes", and it was badly designed from the start. `add_edge` does not check that the graph is bipartite, it checks that the previously computed bipartition stays valid, which is a wrong path to take for non-connected graphs.

Then you have the usual problems:

```
sage: g=BipartiteGraph(5)
sage: g.complement()
...
RuntimeError: Edge vertices must lie in different partitions.
```

Honestly if we must have such a class, we cannot afford to let it inherit from `Graph`. And from the way it appears in the doc, real graph users may want to give it a try, and regret it later.
