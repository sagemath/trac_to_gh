Implement a function to compute the n multiplier spectra, the set of multipliers of periodic points of formal period n, of a projective morphism. This currently only makes sense for morphisms over projective space of dimension 1.

A few things here, the big one is that the multiplier spectrum is defined with multiplicities. So if a perioidic point has multiplicity > 1 its multiplier should be repeated. Such as example should be added to the doc tests.

Other minor issues:
- a positive integer, the period.

- numberfield -> number field

- n = int(n)

- change_ring now works for QQbar, so this is not needed

```
if not PS.base_ring() is QQbar:
 emb = PS.base_ring().embeddings(QQbar)[0]
 f = self.change_ring(QQbar,embedding=emb) # to be able to find all periodic points
else:
 f = self
```

- f.multiplier(P,n)[0][0] -> f.multiplier(P,n)[0,0]

- multipliers.sort() -> not needed


- sigma_invariants - 2nd senctence should say all periodic points. (same for INPUT)


- from sage.combinat.sf.sf import SymmetricFunctions -> move to top

- make len(multipliers) a constant in for loop

A couple things in multiplier_spectrum

- you should check that the domain is projective space to avoid subschemes

- K = f._number_field_from_algebraics() should be outside the if

- if [1,0] is a point of multplicity you will miss this (You also only check if it is fixed not n-periodic). You could instead see if the poly F is of the form `y^m*G(x,y)` for some poly G, then m is the multplicity of [1,0].

- it doesn't seem like your conversion to QQbar is working. Trying your number field example, when the map is actually defined over a number field

```
sage: set_verbose(None)
sage: z = QQ['z'].0
sage: K.<w> = NumberField(z^4 - 4*z^2 + 1)
sage: P.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(K,1)
sage: H = End(P)
sage: f = H([x^2 - w/4*y^2,y^2])
sage: f.multiplier_spectra(2,False)
```

Not sure exactly what you should do here. One option is to get change_ring for polynomials to deal with QQbar, by passing in and/or creating an embedding. If you look in schemes.generic.morphism.SchemeMorphism_polynomial.change_ring() it gives a simple way to construct a hom of polynomials given a hom of the base rings.

For the formal==True case I used the technique in the morphism change_ring function to create the homomorphism between polynomial rings to use on F and this seems to have addressed the issues so far. For the formal==False case, the conversion already seemed to be working, but  the _number_field_from_algebraics version of the map wasn't needed for finding roots.

I found another problem though:

```
P.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(QQ,1)
H = End(P)
f = H([x^2 - 3/4*y^2,y^2])
f.multiplier_spectra(2)
```

gives [1,1] back which isn't correct.

I didn’t catch this before, but multiplier_spectra should only return [1] here, because there is only one two cycle. The collapsing causes this two cycle to turn into a root of multiplicity 2 of the dynatomic polynomial, so the algorithm I use to pick representatives from cycles doesn’t work.

I will implement a fix attempt for this next, but I wanted to push up the current commit before doing so.
