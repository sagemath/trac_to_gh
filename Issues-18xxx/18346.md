This ticket addresses the following problem:

    In the `CGraph` backends, three `cdef` functions are used all the time to
    deal with vertex labels, i.e. `get_vertex`, `vertex_label`,
`check_vertex`. They are always called with the same arguments, which are
    all attributes of the backend that calls it. They should be method, so that
    the arguments are not needlessly repeated.

What this branch does:

- The `CGraph` backends (i.e. `SparseBackend`, `DenseBackend` and
  `StaticSparseGraph`) and `GenericGraphBackend` are turned into cdef classes.

- The three functions `get_vertex`, `vertex_label`, `check_vertex` become
  methods of `CGraphBackend`

- It adds a method `CGraphBackend.c_graph()` to get the two cdef attributes
  `_cg` and `_cg_rev`. Turns out that some code in Sage accesses directly
  `G._backend._cg`.

This should have been sufficient, but there were (unexpected) consequences:

- There is no automatic pickling for cdef classes (as instrospection does not
  work), and the doctests do not pass if that does not work. Consequently, I
  implemented a unique `__reduce__` function in `GenericGraphBackend` which
  handles the pickling for all backends (sparse/dense/static/networkx). It also
  removes some duplicated code as a result.

This makes the code a bit clearer (and it is needed). Also, moving this pickling
function above is good for the future, for there will be many modifications in
the future to the data structures in Sage: I plan to merge `CGraph` and
`GenericBackend` into only one class (but that's for later).

Hum

```diff
+ cdef int get_vertex(self, object u) except ? -2
+ cdef object vertex_label(self, int u_int)
```
this would better be

```diff
cdef int get_vertex(self, u) except ? -2
cdef vertex_label(self, int u_int)
```

The aim of this ticket is to merge CGraph and Backend together. All that "backend" does is forward everything to CGraph. But I certainly cannot do all of this at once, it would be impossible to review. Plus because of the problems I met when writing this branch, I know that I should be wary of the isomorphism test code which works at a lower level than I expected.

The proper solution to "convert" a Python object `u` into a long is

```
cdef long u_long = PyNumber_Index(u)
```
