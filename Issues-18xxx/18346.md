This ticket addresses the following problem:

    In the `CGraph` backends, three `cdef` functions are used all the time to
    deal with vertex labels, i.e. `get_vertex`, `vertex_label`,
`check_vertex`. They are always called with the same arguments, which are
    all attributes of the backend that calls it. They should be method, so that
    the arguments are not needlessly repeated.

What this branch does:

- The `CGraph` backends (i.e. `SparseBackend`, `DenseBackend` and
  `StaticSparseGraph`) and `GenericGraphBackend` are turned into cdef classes.

- The three functions `get_vertex`, `vertex_label`, `check_vertex` become
  methods of `CGraphBackend`

- It adds a method `CGraphBackend.c_graph()` to get the two cdef attributes
  `_cg` and `_cg_rev`. Turns out that some code in Sage accesses directly
  `G._backend._cg`.

This should have been sufficient, but there were (unexpected) consequences:

- There is no automatic pickling for cdef classes (as instrospection does not
  work), and the doctests do not pass if that does not work. Consequently, I
  implemented a unique `__reduce__` function in `GenericGraphBackend` which
  handles the pickling for all backends (sparse/dense/static/networkx). It also
  removes some duplicated code as a result.

This makes the code a bit clearer (and it is needed). Also, moving this pickling
function above is good for the future, for there will be many modifications in
the future to the data structures in Sage: I plan to merge `CGraph` and
`GenericBackend` into only one class (but that's for later).

Hello,

1. Would it be bad to access directly the `._cg` or `._cg_rev` attributes? (ok it seems to be for python code)

2. Is there a description somewhere of the attributes `vertex_ints` and `vertex_labels`?

3. In a cython file, there is no need to declare `cdef object x` or `object x`, just do `x`.

Okay. Well, I don't think I did anything like that but I may have met such a line somewhere. Really, this does not matter for the moment: this code will be heavily rewritten.

What I remember is that not all vertices have an associated label, so that you don't spend your time playing with a dictionary when your graph is defined over integers.\n\nActually you do since `get_vertex` or `vertex_label` are intensively used everywhere. And those methods do check if their argument belongs to some dictionary as a first step!

Actually you do since `get_vertex` or `vertex_label` are intensively used everywhere. And those methods do check if their argument belongs to some dictionary as a first step! But if I understand well, the aim of the ticket is precisely **not** to upgrade these two methods but just to move them.

Hum

```diff
+ cdef int get_vertex(self, object u) except ? -2
+ cdef object vertex_label(self, int u_int)
```
this would better be

```diff
cdef int get_vertex(self, u) except ? -2
cdef vertex_label(self, int u_int)
```

The aim of this ticket is to merge CGraph and Backend together. All that "backend" does is forward everything to CGraph. But I certainly cannot do all of this at once, it would be impossible to review. Plus because of the problems I met when writing this branch, I know that I should be wary of the isomorphism test code which works at a lower level than I expected.

Fixed. Actually, those are the lines that I moved from functions to methods. You will find (almost) the same lines with a '-' in front of them, a couple of lines above.
