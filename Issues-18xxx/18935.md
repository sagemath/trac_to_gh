```
Adding a method which converts a linear function over a finite field in the form of a matrix into a polynomial over that finite field.
This method uses dual bases to perform this calculation in milliseconds over fields such as `GF(3^8)`, whereas a naive Lagrange interpolation calculation can take several minutes to get the same result. 

Depends on #18714

Why `base_matrix_to_polynomial` and not simply `matrix_to_polynomial`?

`poly(el)` is simpler than `poly.subs(x=el)`

This test is really bad

```
not all([matrix[i,j] in self.base_ring() for i in range(n) for j in range(n)])
```
You have several better options
- `matrix.base_ring() == self`
- `matrix = matrix.change_ring(self)` (this might make an unneeded copy)

If `var` is already an element of a polynomial ring then you should not recreate another one. In particular, I might want to work over QQ[x,y] and obtain a polynomial in the variable x in this specific ring. I would simply do

```
if isinstance(var, str):
    from sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_ring import polygen
    var = polygen(self)
```

If the matrix is sparse you are doing a lot of unwanted computations. I would actually separate

```
if matrix.is_sparse():
    entries = matrix.nonzero_positions()
else:
    entries = ((i,j) for i in range(n) for j in range(n))

for i,j in entries:
    # do the looping
```
And add a test with a huge matrix with very few coefficients like

```
sage: M = matrix(GF(3,4), 1000, sparse=True)
sage: M[0,3] = 1
```

The operation `gen**i` is actually very fast. So I would avoid computing the list `basis` and replace `basis[i]` with `gen**i`

You should not compute a list and then make a sum of elements. Do everything at once

```
s = 0
for i in range(10):
    s += 1
```
is much better than

```
l = []
for i in range(10):
    l.append(i)
s = sum(l)
```
