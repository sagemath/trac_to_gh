Hi,

I'm having trouble upgrading from Sage-6.4 to Sage-6.7 on my Macbook Pro. The installation aborts at the libgd-2.1.1.p0 stage with the following error:

```
libtool: compile:  gcc -std=gnu99 -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I/Applications/Sage-6.2.app/Contents/Resources/sage/local/include/libpng12 -I/Users/buildbot/build/sage/bsd-1/sage_git/build/local/include/freetype2 -g -fvisibility=hidden -MT gdft.lo -MD -MP -MF .deps/gdft.Tpo -c gdft.c  -fno-common -DPIC -o .libs/gdft.o
gdft.c:153:22: fatal error: ft2build.h: No such file or directory
 #include <ft2build.h>
                      ^
compilation terminated.
make[5]: *** [gdft.lo] Error 1
make[4]: *** [all] Error 2
make[3]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
Error building gd.
```

The *ft2build.h* file is in the local/include/freetype2 subdirectory.
I think the problem is in the *-I/Users/buildbot/build/sage/bsd-1/sage_git/build/local/include/freetype2* part, which seems incorrectly copy-pasted from someone else's computer (I don't have the *buildbot* directory on my computer!). I'm too much of a newbie to fiddle with it, so could someone tell me what to do? I tried to do

```
make -I/Applications/Sage-6.2.app/Contents/Resources/sage/local/include/freetype2 start
```
from the root directory, but that failed too.

Here is the link to the log file if it helps: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/hal4fp0p3rb2hrw/libgd-2.1.1.p0?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/hal4fp0p3rb2hrw/libgd-2.1.1.p0?dl=0)

Thanks for your help.

PS: Sage-6.7 installed perfectly well on my linux desktop. I'm surprised that other people are not having this issue.

Volker or Jeroen, I'm wondering whether there is anything else we can do (in your experience with releasing) to avoid this kind of thing, or whether it's just not possible.  These things always seem to come up but apparently we haven't gotten the "don't develop with binaries" out enough - and apparently some people do experience success there.

Could you please explain more in detail what you mean with this? Which commands did you execute?

There are two things you could try:

1. Force `sage-location`:

```
$ ./sage --python local/bin/sage-location
$ make
```

2. If that doesn't work, a more drastic solution:

```
$ rm -rf local/var/lib/sage/installed/
$ make
```
This will force rebuilding of every package. With some luck, it will solve your problem.

I am afraid that you are then doing something different from what you *think* you are doing.

The path you are seeing refers to the OS X buildbot. The only way how that can appear in your install is if you downloaded a binary build of Sage. It's impossible for that path to appear if you're building from the git sources.

I am sorry, but I don't see how that is possible. This is exactly what I did in this order.

```
$ git fetch origin

The "since" seems to imply that you did at one point install a Sage binary.

I didn't do anything related to the installation of sage before typing those commands, if that's what you mean. If I understand *vbraun* 's comments above, then *git fetch origin* would fetch the latest sources, right?

Yes.

I was just trying to be precise. I don't remember any more, but I highly doubt it.

You certainly must have. The command `git fetch origin` only works if there is already a git tree in the current working directory (think of it this way: if I buy a new computer out of the box, then surely `git fetch origin` will not download Sage).

So there is still the question of how you obtained that original git tree. And, despite what you think, the answer is that you downloaded a binary (possibly by mistake).

Replying to [@ayyer](#comment%3A16):
> *make distclean* followed by *make start* did the trick. Thanks everyone. How do I mark that this ticket is solved?

Oops! Question-mark help does not work within *sage* anymore. Could you help me fix this? I find this feature extremely useful. Thanks. If you like, I can open this as a separate ticket. *search_src()* works properly though. 

Here is the error I get.
