Keywords: days65, set_partition_ordered

Currently, OrderedSetPartitions() is only implemented for a given n (or a given alphabet). In order to build a graded Hopf algebra with this as indexing set, we need it to exist without specifying n.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18657
