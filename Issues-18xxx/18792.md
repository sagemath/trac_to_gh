I did try to factor some large integer with `factor(n, 8)`, and since it did not succeed I did abort with Ctrl-C.

After that, with `is_prime(p)` for some (say) 20-digit prime p, I had plenty of verbose message from Pari.

I guess Pari uses some global variable for the verbose level, which is not properly restored in case of Ctrl-C.

I was not able to reproduce the problem, but maybe someone will.
