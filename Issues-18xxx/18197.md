Keywords: cgal, polyhedra, geometry

This ticket adds a preliminary Sage package for CGAL, the Computational Geometry Algorithms Library. http://www.cgal.org/index.html

It is a huge package. My main interest, right now, comes from a need for fast data structures for polyhedral complexes in low dimension / piecewise linear functions in several variables.

Installation goes through; I have not tested anything.

Some history:

In 2009, there was intermittent interest in making such a Sage package. [https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/35g7UicEKvo](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/35g7UicEKvo)
One of the concerns at the time apparently was CGAL's licensing. However, CGAL has changed its licensing terms since then; it now appears to be released under some combination of GPL and LGPL, version 3 or later. 
[http://www.cgal.org/license.html](http://www.cgal.org/license.html)

There also was some interest in this topic in 2013: [http://www.cgal.org/gsoc/2013.html](http://www.cgal.org/gsoc/2013.html)
I do not know if there were any outcomes.

The Sage `cmake` package is installed. Why don't we use the system one if it is there (as we do for gcc)?

Concerning open source root isolation I know at least:

- [re-antic](https://github.com/videlec/e-antic)
- and Sage but which is not easy to use at C/C++ level

At least I am able to compile simple CGAL projects within Sage. However, having some cython code using CGAL looks less trivial.
