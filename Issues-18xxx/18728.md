The method `sage.libs.pari.gen.gen.nfisisom()` has an argument that is declared as `gen`; it would be more useful if it would convert its argument using `objtogen()`.

Example:

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2 + x + 1)
sage: L.<b> = NumberField(x^2 + 3)
sage: pari(K).nfisisom(L)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: Argument 'other' has incorrect type (expected sage.libs.pari.gen.gen, got NumberField_quadratic_with_category)
```
