The `NumberField` containing both (complex conjugate) embeddings should be larger.

The cause is probably that the defining polynomial `f` does not have integral coefficients.  When `f` is replaced by `QQ['x'](pari(f).polredabs())` (which is `x^8 - x^7 + x^6 - 2*x^5 - x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + 2*x + 1`), the result is a number field of degree 32.
