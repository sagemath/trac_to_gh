sage: from sage.sets.set_from_iterator import EnumeratedSetFromIterator
sage: C=CombinatorialFreeModule(ZZ,EnumeratedSetFromIterator(Integers)) ; C
Free module generated by {0, 1, -1, 2, -2, ...} over Integer Ring
sage: U = tensor((C,)) ; U
Free module generated by {0, 1, -1, 2, -2, ...} over Integer Ring
sage: C.basis().category()
Category of enumerated sets
sage: U.basis().category()
Category of finite enumerated sets
```

But clearly the basis of `U` is not finite.

<a id='comment:5'></a>Hello,

1. Why a special care for `CombinatorialClass` is even needed at all? The following would be much simpler

```
category = EnumeratedSets()
if set in Sets().Finite() or isinstance(set, (list,tuple)):
    category = category.Finite()
elif set in Sets().Infinite():
    category = category.Infinite()
```

2. Your documentation lines are too long.

The underlying implementation has changed. `CombinatorialClass` is no longer involved. The bug is now in `sage.misc.mrange._is_finite` (used by `sage.combinat.cartesian_product`):

```
