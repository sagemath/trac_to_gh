A bug in eclib's saturation function is revealed here:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve([0,-1,1,-266,968])
sage: Q1 = E([-1995,3674,125])
sage: Q2 = E([157,1950,1])
sage: E.saturation([Q1,Q2])                                                                                     
([(-399/25 : 3674/125 : 1), (157 : 1950 : 1)], 1, 7.21429780216482)
sage: P1, P2 = E.gens()                                                                                         
sage: E.regulator()
0.801588644684980
sage: E.regulator_of_points([Q1,Q2])
7.21429780216482
```
The points Q1,Q2 generate a subgroup of index 3 but the computed bound on the index is between 2 and 3.  This will be fixed upstream.

Note that for this curve E.gens() gives correct generators but E.simon_two_descent() gives the above two points.
