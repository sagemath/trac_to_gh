Hello everybody,

This branch adds a "sage-sanity-check-package" script that uses the 'spkg-src'
scripts. The goal is to have an easy way to check, when a new-style package gets
udpated, that the new package is precisely "spkg-src" builds.

Right now our 'spkg-spkg' scripts all do different things. In order to use
'spkg-src' scripts in an automatic way, I made the following assumption:

- When `./sage-src' is run in a build/pkg/<package>/ folder, it creates the
  package archive whose name is described in checksums.ini

- There is un upstream/ an archive with the same name

- Their contents are compared with 'diff -r'

Currently, almost none of our packages satisfy those assumptions (*).

What would you think of having a script like that? That would 'normalize' the
situations of our spkg-src scripts, and we will solve the many inconsistencies
in our packaging. That will also make sure that everything we do on a package is
listed by the spkg-src script.

Have fun,

Nathann

(*) Some seem to, but then they are named file.tar.gz while the file is not
gzipped. Or else the file in upstream/ is not exactly what is in
checksum.ini. Or spkg-src downloads the *latest version* instead of the one
    whose version is hardcoded in checsksums.ini. You get the picture.

Component: **build**

I agree that we are still a long way from having a clean build system, but what I want to do with this script is to help us clean the packages progressively.

If you want to implement the ideas you proposed, your only way to make them work will be to fix all packages at once. I don't think that it can be done, and I do not expect anybody to do it.

If we agree on some formalism for `spkg-src`, we can start precisely this work: make sure that everything we do to a package is done there. This way if we ever want to move to something more constraining, we will know at least what we have to deal with.

In the immediate future, however, that would help a reviewer check that the 'updated package' proposed for review is only what it claims to be. No code was injected (to be run on everybody's computer), and also check that everything that is done appears in `spkg-src`.

Thus, I still think that such a script would be a good addition: along with a rule that we should only accept spkg-src scripts that fit the assumptions (those are open to discussion). And slowly, we will add new spkg-src files and stabilize the situation.

I agree with Nathann that `spkg-src` scripts are inconsistent and should be improved.

I'd like to modify the assumptions a bit though:
1. The `spkg-src` script should only be run within a Sage shell.
2. The `spkg-src` script should be runnable from any directory (do not assume the current directory is `build/pkgs/PKGNAME`)
3. The tarball should be created in the `$SAGE_DISTFILES` directory.
4. The script shall not change any file (not even temporary) outside `$SAGE_DISTFILES`.

So, `./sage --sh build/pkgs/PKGNAME/spkg-src` should "just work".

You want a club to force others to spend time beautifying sage-src scripts. Thats IMHO the wrong direction, we should get rid of the `sage-src` scripts instead of cementing in the status quo.

Yep `T_T`

> 1. The `spkg-src` script should only be run within a Sage shell.

How can you check that? Or do you mean that my script should only run them from the inside of a sage shell? If so, would replacing 'spkg-src' with 'sage -sh spkg-src' in the script be sufficient?

> 1. The `spkg-src` script should be runnable from any directory (do not assume the current directory is `build/pkgs/PKGNAME`)

I do not know how to check that either. In a preliminary version of my script I wanted to work in a different directory, but I figured out that most spkg-src files would break at this step.

> 1. The tarball should be created in the `$SAGE_DISTFILES` directory.

That would break the way the script currently works. It *compares* the file created by spkg-src with the one in `upstream/`. How could we deal with that?

> 1. The script shall not change any file (not even temporary) outside `$SAGE_DISTFILES`.

Well, it will need some temporary directory anyway.

> So, `./sage --sh build/pkgs/PKGNAME/spkg-src` should "just work".

You are making requests which would make this script much more restrictive. If you already know how to implement some of them, feel free to add a commit on this public branch (with explicit error messages).

When we will have settled on that, we will also have to explain all this (and go over all assumptions) in the developer manual.

Thanks,

Part of the discussion is about other matters than what this branch contains: I wrote a script that I have often needed, in order to check that the packages that are proposed on trac ticket as an updated of upstream are indeed what they claim to be.

Right now these operations have to be done manually, and often. Besides, as I am not the only one who does that I would say that they are of 'public interest'.

I do not mind discussions on wider problems, but I still need a script for those daily/weekly operations that need to be done.

I do not mind. I just want something to happen. Somehow with tickets like that, it's like everybody it fighting so that absolutely nothing happens, and burying tickets. This branch exists, while the others alternatives do not.

About properly defininf X: so far all the restrictions/assumptions you proposed, if I am not mistaken, are more constraining that those I made. Except two:
- The one about being able to run the script from any place
- The one about moving the package to upstream

I will implement this now, so please do not make me regret this later by asking me to do something impossible that you know I will not do, thus killing this ticket.

Some other things we could check:

Oh. In order to avoid the ugly 0777 files?

I don't see any reason to oppose that, and I will pray that the current packages already satisfy it.

Could you add a commit to check that, if you think them necessary? And if you do, could you update the 'list of assumptions' that I added to the head of the 'sanity-check' script? We will need that to write the doc later.

You have an additional assumption

```
# - When uncompressed, the archive creates a "src/" or a

```
which I think is not needed.

Such an assumption was needed for old-style spkg files due to the way that `sage-spkg` works, but for new-style packages this is really not needed.

I have nothing against that.

I'm just saying: *if* the tarball was created using a `spkg-src` script, then it should be either a `.tar` or `.tar.bz2` file (there is really no reason to create a `.gz` file, since those are usually larger than the corresponding `.bz2` file).

You seem to assume that there is a spkg-src file only if there is something to change in the package. I did not assume that. That's why we do not understand each other.

If the Sage autotools package is installed, it should produce the same output on all systems. So, ideally, `spkg-src` should call `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/auto(re)conf` instead of "plain" `auto(re)conf` (which a suitable error message of the form "please install the autotools package").
