Hello everybody,

This branch adds a "sage-sanity-check-package" script that uses the 'spkg-src'
scripts. The goal is to have an easy way to check, when a new-style package gets
udpated, that the new package is precisely "spkg-src" builds.

Right now our 'spkg-spkg' scripts all do different things. In order to use
'spkg-src' scripts in an automatic way, I made the following assumption:

- When `./sage-src' is run in a build/pkg/<package>/ folder, it creates the
  package archive whose name is described in checksums.ini

- There is un upstream/ an archive with the same name

- Their contents are compared with 'diff -r'

Currently, almost none of our packages satisfy those assumptions (*).

What would you think of having a script like that? That would 'normalize' the
situations of our spkg-src scripts, and we will solve the many inconsistencies
in our packaging. That will also make sure that everything we do on a package is
listed by the spkg-src script.

Have fun,

Nathann

(*) Some seem to, but then they are named file.tar.gz while the file is not
gzipped. Or else the file in upstream/ is not exactly what is in
checksum.ini. Or spkg-src downloads the *latest version* instead of the one
    whose version is hardcoded in checsksums.ini. You get the picture.

In this case, the 'diff' comparison is indeed useless, for different versions of the autotool scripts produce different outputs. If the autotoolizing is done by upstream, however, that's no problem.

Let us talk about solutions instead of just raising the problems: how do we address that?

I did not plan to have this script be anything else than a helper tool to review packages. On the other hand, we must have a way to check the sanity of the packages.

Of the packages which are autotoolized by our 'spkg-src' scripts, I would not be at all surprised to find out that they are like this because... its authors are Sage developpers.

I agree with Nathann that `spkg-src` scripts are inconsistent and should be improved.

I'd like to modify the assumptions a bit though:
1. The `spkg-src` script should only be run within a Sage shell.
2. The `spkg-src` script should be runnable from any directory (do not assume the current directory is `build/pkgs/PKGNAME`)
3. The tarball should be created in the `$SAGE_DISTFILES` directory.
4. The script shall not change any file (not even temporary) outside `$SAGE_DISTFILES`.

So, `./sage --sh build/pkgs/PKGNAME/spkg-src` should "just work".

Yep `T_T`

How can you check that? Or do you mean that my script should only run them from the inside of a sage shell? If so, would replacing 'spkg-src' with 'sage -sh spkg-src' in the script be sufficient?

> 1. The `spkg-src` script should be runnable from any directory (do not assume the current directory is `build/pkgs/PKGNAME`)


I do not know how to check that either. In a preliminary version of my script I wanted to work in a different directory, but I figured out that most spkg-src files would break at this step.

> 1. The tarball should be created in the `$SAGE_DISTFILES` directory.


That would break the way the script currently works. It *compares* the file created by spkg-src with the one in `upstream/`. How could we deal with that?

> 1. The script shall not change any file (not even temporary) outside `$SAGE_DISTFILES`.


Well, it will need some temporary directory anyway.

> So, `./sage --sh build/pkgs/PKGNAME/spkg-src` should "just work".


You are making requests which would make this script much more restrictive. If you already know how to implement some of them, feel free to add a commit on this public branch (with explicit error messages).

When we will have settled on that, we will also have to explain all this (and go over all assumptions) in the developer manual.

Thanks,

Nathann

If you see a way to work toward the idea that you have, then count me in. If you have wishes but no specific plan in mind, then I think that this script would help a lot, in the meantime.

I didn't say that you script should *check* all conditions. We need to define how the `spkg-src` script should be run, so we need to state the conditions precisely.

> Or do you mean that my script should only run them from the inside of a sage shell?

Yes.

 cd /

```

```
 SAGE_REAL_DISTFILES="$SAGE_DISTFILES"
 export SAGE_DISTFILES=/some/temporary/directory
 cd /
 "$SAGE_ROOT/build/pkgs/$PKGNAME/spkg-src
 compare "$SAGE_REAL_DISTFILES/$TARBALL" "$SAGE_DISTFILES/$TARBALL"
```

I think it could use `$SAGE_DISTFILES` as temporary directory.

Part of the discussion is about other matters than what this branch contains: I wrote a script that I have often needed, in order to check that the packages that are proposed on trac ticket as an updated of upstream are indeed what they claim to be.

Right now these operations have to be done manually, and often. Besides, as I am not the only one who does that I would say that they are of 'public interest'.

I do not mind discussions on wider problems, but I still need a script for those daily/weekly operations that need to be done.

I do not mind. I just want something to happen. Somehow with tickets like that, it's like everybody it fighting so that absolutely nothing happens, and burying tickets. This branch exists, while the others alternatives do not.

About properly defininf X: so far all the restrictions/assumptions you proposed, if I am not mistaken, are more constraining that those I made. Except two:
- The one about being able to run the script from any place
- The one about moving the package to upstream

I will implement this now, so please do not make me regret this later by asking me to do something impossible that you know I will not do, thus killing this ticket.

Some other things we could check:
7. All directories in the tarball should have 0755 permission. All ordinary files should have 0755 or 0644 permission. *Possibly add:* every file which has 0755 permission must start with `#!`.
8. All symlinks in the tarball must be relative and point to an existing file.

Hello,

> 7. All directories in the tarball should have 0755 permission. All ordinary files should have 0755 or 0644 permission. *Possibly add:* every file which has 0755 permission must start with `#!`.


Oh. In order to avoid the ugly 0777 files?

> 8. All symlinks in the tarball must be relative and point to an existing file.


I don't see any reason to oppose that, and I will pray that the current packages already satisfy it.

Could you add a commit to check that, if you think them necessary? And if you do, could you update the 'list of assumptions' that I added to the head of the 'sanity-check' script? We will need that to write the doc later.

> If there are any conditions that I mentioned that you don't agree with (regardless of whether the script on this ticket should check them), I'd like to know.


Well, I would not have thought of those two things you just mentionned, but I see no reason to oppose them (unless we find out that 99% of the tarballs don't satisfy it). And I am afraid that I cannot remember anything else you mentionned that is not yet in my script.

You have an additional assumption

```
# - When uncompressed, the archive creates a "src/" or a
#   "<package_name>-<version>/" directory
```
which I think is not needed.

Such an assumption was needed for old-style spkg files due to the way that `sage-spkg` works, but for new-style packages this is really not needed.

I'm just saying: *if* the tarball was created using a `spkg-src` script, then it should be either a `.tar` or `.tar.bz2` file (there is really no reason to create a `.gz` file, since those are usually larger than the corresponding `.bz2` file).

I don't mind. It is just very very hot in england right now, and that's the only thing I am able to do. So I stop trying to fix giac. About 'wget' I think that it is really going too far, but as you never give way on any point for the sake of good mood, well, I am forced to do it.

No problem for this bz2 thing, we had the same thing in mind all along.

What would you say that we have to do?

I can write the doc, perhaps? And explain the different assumptions?

Also, you said that there was a trick for this problem with running autotools on different machines?
