We have

```
> git trac create
usage: git-trac create [-h] [-b BRANCH_NAME] summary
git-trac create: error: too few arguments
2
Exiting.
```

Hence, according to the documentation, there is an option `-h` for `git trac create`. I suppose that a user will take it for granted that `git trac create -h` will return documentation for `git trac create`. However, `git trac create -h` will create a ticket with the description "help" (this is how this ticket was created...)

Either the documentation should be changed, so that the option `-h` is not shown, or the git trac script should be changed so that it doesn't create a trac ticket in this case.
