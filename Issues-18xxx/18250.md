I thought that we had a decent implementation of `G.triangles_count`. Turns out that we did not.

Here is what the branch does:

- Exception on non-simple graphs. The digraph version can handle loops (it
  cannot handle multiple edges) and the graph version cannot handle any of the
  two.

- (obvious) speedup in the 'iter' algorithm. Before:

  ```
  sage: %timeit _=g.triangles_count(algorithm='iter')
  1 loops, best of 3: 10.2 s per loop
  ```
  After:

  ```
  sage: g=graphs.RandomGNP(700,.3)
  sage: %timeit _=g.triangles_count(algorithm='iter')
  1 loops, best of 3: 6.37 s per loop
  ```

- Added `triangles_count` in `static_sparse_graph` and another one in
  `static_dense_graph`. They first copy the graph in a proper data structure and
  count the triangles on the copy. They can take require more memory (though
  they are 100000x cheaper than the default data structure)

- The default algorithm is 'iter' in the code but 'matrix' in the doc. Fixed:
  `sparse_copy` is now the default.

Overall, comparing default implementations:

Before

```
sage: g = graphs.RandomGNP(500,.5)
sage: %timeit g.triangles_count()
1 loops, best of 3: 9.78 s per loop
```

After

```
sage: g = graphs.RandomGNP(500,.5)
sage: %timeit g.triangles_count()
10 loops, best of 3: 162 ms per loop
```

Hello,

Small commit for documentation at `public/18250`.

The algorithm `'iter'` returns `int` while `dense_copy` returns `Integer`. This would better be uniform.

You always perform a copy?! Isn't it possible to have a graph whose backend is already a `static_sparse_graph` or a `static_dense_graph`?

Vincent

Yooooooooooooooo,

Oh, right. Thanks.

Done.

Well, in this case copies are eally cheap, so I personally prefer a simpler code to one that avoids that copy.

Still, I implemented it. There is a 'trick' somewhere: 

1) I first build a copy of the graph with `G.copy(immutable=True)` (which makes no copy if the graph is already immutable), then access its internal data structure

2) If I do `g[0] = G.copy(immutable=True)._backend._cg.g[0]` I get a segfault because G.copy() is immediately deallocated. So I first do `G = G.copy(immutable=True)._backend`, and *then* access its internal data.

Fortunately the copy `G` is not deleted until the end of the function. If Cython ever notices that (as far as it is concerned) it is never used again in the function, then it will be deallocated and we will get a segfault again.

Nope. gcc will not do that. An affectation `G = H` is not one instruction if `H` is a Python object. Cython translates it into something like

```
cdef PyObject * G = H;
Py_INCREF(G);
```
whick prevents deallocation of H until G is garbage collected (typically at the end of the function or until a call of `del G`).

Please, consider the following **right** answers

```
sage: G = Graph([(0,1),(0,1),(1,2),(2,0)], multiedges=True)
sage: (G.adjacency_matrix()**3).trace() / 6
2
sage: sage: G = Graph([(0,1),(0,1),(1,2), (1,2), (2,0)], multiedges=True)
sage: (G.adjacency_matrix()**3).trace()//6

Oh, and then you will also have the guys who have a weight on their edges and want to count the number of weighted triangles.

This is what I am thinking about when I consider a multi graph, it is just a graph with (positive) integer labels. The weight of a triangle is the product of the labels on the three edges. And to count triangles, you just sum the weights. It is what you get from the matrix trace (when you removed the loops).

But I agree that there is one ambiguity: you might want to count induced C3.

Well.. `generic_graph.py` cannot handle `C` types so it would have required to move the function to `generic_graph_pyx.pyx` (what a mess `>_<`), but I think that I was also influenced by the function `is_strongly_regular` immediately above.

Also, at first this function was building a copy of the graph every time, because I really did not think that it mattered. There are many functions like that in `distance_all_pairs` too. It contains every function which "relies heavily on the distance_all_pairs functions", and most of them accept Sage graphs directly (though some of them have pure C couterparts).

Can you tell me what you mean by "specificities of the backends"?

If you actually mean "specificities of the backens" (and not about the Multi,looped,edge-labelled) graph), then what I want to do is merely to make it simple to switch from one to the other, for the user or for the coders. I am trying to clean the constructor first (#18185 in `needs_review`), then I will try to make it a bit faster (creating immutable copies is unnecessarily complicated), to distribute them a bit (into subfunctions).

The main problem I haven't solved is this: what should the *default* backend for Sage graphs be?

For small graphs I expect that the current one is right. But being able to run "has_edge" in `log(n)` time, or being able to remove edges has a huge cost. If we just want to add edges and vertices (i.e. to build graphs, from an algorithm or from a file) then it can be MUCH cheaper. For analysis of large networks it is something that you cannot afford to pay, and then this backend must be different.

So if we want to make no choice at all, it really has to become much simpler and natural to pick a backend for a graph.

Also, we may want to have a 'virtual' backend like in Gap for graphs defined from a group action. No graph would actually be stored, yet all algorithms should be available.

Well, that's what I think of these days.
