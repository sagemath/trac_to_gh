PARI is literally orders of magnitude faster at this.

Note: if you want to use this function on input of moderate to large size (say, dimension > 100), you will need #18435 which reduces the memory consumption of `qfgaussred`.

Depends on #18656

Are you sure it always works as expected?

BEfore your changes, we have:

```
sage: Q = matrix(QQ,[[0,1],[1,0]])
sage: F = QuadraticForm(Q)
sage: F.rational_diagonal_form()
Quadratic form in 2 variables over Rational Field with coefficients: 
[ 1 0 ]
[ * -1/4 ]
```

But if we try to do what you propose:

```
sage: Q = matrix(QQ,[[0,1],[1,0]])
sage: F = QuadraticForm(Q)
sage: F.rational_diagonal_form()
Quadratic form in 2 variables over Rational Field with coefficients: 
[ 1 0 ]
[ * -1/4 ]
sage: F._pari_()
[0, 1; 1, 0]
sage: F._pari_().qfgaussred()
[1/2, 1; -1, -1/2]
sage: MS = MatrixSpace(QQ,2,2)
sage: D = MS()
sage: D[0,0] = R[0,0]
sage: D[1,1] = R[1,1]
sage: Q.parent()(D)
[ 1/2    0]
[   0 -1/2]

```

<div id="comment:6" align="right">Comment 6</div>

The rational diagonal form is far from unique, so there is no contradiction.

The quadratic form corresponding to

```
[ 1/2    0]
[   0 -1/2]
```
is

```
Quadratic form in 2 variables over Rational Field with coefficients: 
[ 1/4 0 ]
[ * 1/4 ]
```
which is equivalent to the old result (just rescale the first vector by a factor 2).

In short, given a matrix `A`, you want to find some matrix `X` such that `X^t A X` is a diagonal matrix. There is no guarantee made about which matrix `X` and which diagonal matrix it returns.

> It is supposed to be the equivalent to gramm-schmidt form, right?

I don't really know what you mean.

That doesn't look like an error message, can you give a bit more context (the lines you removed with `...`)?

And just to be clear: the command which fails is `make`?
