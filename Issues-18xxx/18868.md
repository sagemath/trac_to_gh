This is a re-implementation of an example appearing in Cython's documentation (see bottom of [1]).

The idea is simple: an object has a `.malloc` method, and returns arrays of memory. When that object is garbage-collected, the memory it allocated is automatically freed.

This makes it much easier to deal with C pointers in Cython code, which must be freed before any 'return' and whenever an exception can be raised.

As an illustration of how useful this can be, I removed a *lot* of graph code.

I guess that `realloc(array)` might not be so easy to support, so you can forget about that. But I would certainly support `allocarray` and `calloc`.

And I don't understand why you use

```
cdef void * val = malloc(size)
if val == NULL:
    raise MemoryError()
```
instead of

```
cdef void * val = check_malloc(size)
```

To solve some of these problems, I propose the following: add a small fixed array

```
cdef void* local_pointers[16]
```
in the `MemoryAllocator` class and initialize

```
self.max_size = 16
self.pointers = self.local_pointers
```
such that you avoid any allocations for `pointers` if you need to store at most 16 pointers (which is the usual case I guess).

Makes no difference in any of the functions I touched, so I did not do it. Less
readable.

I added support for calloc. I do not need realloc (you can add a commit if you
need it).

About realloc:

+1

Add a commit if you like. My problem with 'allocarray' is that it is Sage's
terminology (as far as I know), and that I prefer to stick to more widely
understood terms like 'malloc/calloc'. I was just saying to David that we may
eventually move some C graph code away from sage and make it an independent C
library.

Personally, for a simple reason: I trust C functions. Officially, it is for the
reason Jeroen mentionned. Note that we can satisfy everybody: it is possible to
have `sage_malloc` (which behaves properly with respect to interrupts) call your
functions instead of C ones.

> More about performance: note that your use of MemoryAllocator needs at least 2
> extra memory allocation calls compared to not using MemoryAllocator


This is not a problem for the codes I touched, for malloc is never a dominant
cost in any of them. You can add a commit if you like, though please keep the
code simple and understandable if you do.

> More for performance: replace

Done.

> One more detail: replace `int` with `size_t`

Done.

Jeroen, could you send reviews as one big comment rather than adding one every
time you notice something? Everybody in Cc receives an email for each comments,
and it is also a bit harder to address your points:

- One never knows if you are done reading the code or if we can expect a new
  comment in the next seconds

- Answering your points like I do now is a bit harder: instead of clicking on
  'reply' (to your comment), I copy/paste all your individual messages into a
  text file, then start answering them.

Thaaaaaaaaanks,

Nathann

I thought that speed was an important reason to invent this new class. If you don't care so much about speed, there are several already-existing alternatives, such as [Cython arrays](http://docs.cython.org/src/userguide/memoryviews.html#cython-arrays).

If speed is not so much a concern, then why are you reinventing the wheel?
