In Sage 6.6.rc1:

```
sage: f = Newforms(Gamma1(30), 2, names='a')[1]
sage: g = loads(dumps(f))
sage: f == g
True
sage: f != g
True          # should be False
```
This is fixed by implementing `ModularForm_abstract.__ne__()`.

We also remove the (partial) implementation of `__cmp__()` and replace it by `__eq__()` and `__ne__()`; this simplifies the code and anticipates the removal of `cmp()` in Python 3.

Keywords: modular forms comparison

While you're at it:

`__cmp__` doesn't make any sense at all to me (see the except part):

```
        try:
            self._ensure_is_compatible(other)
        except Exception:
            return self.parent().__cmp__(other.parent())
        if self.element() == other.element():
            return 0
        else:
            return -1
```

Also `__cmp__` is getting deprecated and "<,<=,>,>=" aren't needed anyway for elements I assume.
What about also removing `__cmp__`?

OK, this is what is currently done for modular forms.

I spent some time trying to implement `_cmp_()` instead of `__eq__()` & co., but this was not so easy.  It turns out that modular forms do not yet support the coercion model as they should.  For example, the forms `f` and `g` below are in different subspaces of the same ambient space, but this ambient space is not detected as a common parent:

```
sage: M = ModularForms(Gamma1(13), 2)
sage: f = M.cuspidal_submodule().gen(0)
sage: g = M.old_submodule()(0)
sage: f.parent().ambient() is g.parent().ambient()
True
sage: f + g
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for '+': 'Cuspidal subspace of dimension 2 of Modular Forms space of dimension 13 for Congruence Subgroup Gamma1(13) of weight 2 over Rational Field' and 'Modular Forms subspace of dimension 0 of Modular Forms space of dimension 13 for Congruence Subgroup Gamma1(13) of weight 2 over Rational Field'
```
I think it is better to do that on a different ticket.

Hi Peter,

Could you mention this ticket number in the documentation, something like `this used to fail (see :trac:`18068`)`?

Then it will be good to go.
