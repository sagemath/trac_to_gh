I also want to discourage the `view()` command, right now it is just spaghetti code that does different things depending on the time of the day. So I propose to use `latex(...).compile()` as an idiom to typeset LaTeX code.

Launching an external viewer from the notebook server process equals NOT working in my book. So `show(T)` never worked in the ipython notebook, and this ticket doesn't change that.

The correct way to get graphical output is `T.plot()`. The fact that this cannot produce the graphics that you want is a bug in the finite state machine code.

The show docstring is correct, it'll show a Graphics object if you provide one. If you don't give it a graphics object then you won't get a picture.

On my installations the command

```
T = transducers.GrayCode()
show(T)
```
does the following:

- 6.6.rc1 ipython-notebook: open and show the LaTeX-formatted output in external viewer (as pdf).

- 6.6.rc1 sagenb: show LaTeX-formatted output inline.

- 6.6.rc2+#18116 ipython-notebook: does nothing.

Hi Daniel,

Replying to [ticket:18116 dkrenn]:
> I also want to discourage the `view()` command, right now it is just spaghetti code that does different things depending on the time of the day. 
> So I propose to use `latex(...).compile()` as an idiom to typeset LaTeX code.

First, to me the following facts are all completely independent:
A. discourage the use of `view()`
B. `view()` is spaghetti code
C. propose `latex(...).compile()` 
So one can't use A or B to suggest C.

Second, I have never liked in Sage the fact that there plenty of ways of drawing things. For an outside person, it is tough to understand the difference `plot`, `show` and `view` ? To me there should be one fonction to do them all. For that reason, I do not like the idea of proposing a fourth one being `latex(...).compile()` or anything else.

That being said, I really like the idea of being able to show tikz pictures in the ipython notebook.

+1, there should be a method of `LatexExpr` that shows it pretty like `LatexExpr.__pprint__` that is used by the displayhook thing.

> Thats possible, but I think many people use latex to generate latex code to paste into their articles and not to get cute pictures in the notebook.

Well, they could still do:

```
sage: latex(1/2) # shows graphically
sage: print latex(1/2) # prints the source

There is some kind of solution to the original problem of this ticket at #19515. The original problem was:

```
view(latex(transducers.GrayCode())) 
``` 
shows the transducer inplace in sagenb but it is a pitty that this does not work in the ipython notebook.

```
latex(transducers.GrayCode())
```
writes tikz-code.
