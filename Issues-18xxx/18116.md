I also want to discourage the `view()` command, right now it is just spaghetti code that does different things depending on the time of the day. So I propose to use `latex(...).compile()` as an idiom to typeset LaTeX code.

Launching an external viewer from the notebook server process equals NOT working in my book. So `show(T)` never worked in the ipython notebook, and this ticket doesn't change that.

The correct way to get graphical output is `T.plot()`. The fact that this cannot produce the graphics that you want is a bug in the finite state machine code.

The show docstring is correct, it'll show a Graphics object if you provide one. If you don't give it a graphics object then you won't get a picture.

On my installations the command

```
T = transducers.GrayCode()
show(T)
```
does the following:

- 6.6.rc1 ipython-notebook: open and show the LaTeX-formatted output in external viewer (as pdf).

- 6.6.rc1 sagenb: show LaTeX-formatted output inline.

- 6.6.rc2+#18116 ipython-notebook: does nothing.

Hi Daniel,

Replying to [ticket:18116 dkrenn]:
> I also want to discourage the `view()` command, right now it is just spaghetti code that does different things depending on the time of the day. 
> So I propose to use `latex(...).compile()` as an idiom to typeset LaTeX code.


First, to me the following facts are all completely independent:
A. discourage the use of `view()`
B. `view()` is spaghetti code
C. propose `latex(...).compile()` 
So one can't use A or B to suggest C.

Second, I have never liked in Sage the fact that there plenty of ways of drawing things. For an outside person, it is tough to understand the difference `plot`, `show` and `view` ? To me there should be one fonction to do them all. For that reason, I do not like the idea of proposing a fourth one being `latex(...).compile()` or anything else.

That being said, I really like the idea of being able to show tikz pictures in the ipython notebook.

Ok, then the code should change.

To me it is not clear from the command that this will show a picture.

`latex(...).compile()` does not show a picture, it generates a PDF document. The document wrapper object pretty-prints graphically. You can also assign it to a variable, save as a pdf file, etc. In the latter case no picture is shown. Just like graphics objects (the return values of `plot`, for example)

You can't solve the "its impossible to guess the difference between view/show/pretty_print" conundrum without getting rid of 2 of them (or making them aliases, at least).

Also, show acts immediately, like print. Plot does not act immediately, it returns a graphics object that you can use elsewhere and need not result in graphical output.

In other words: its the difference between

```

So `view(A)` does (or should do) the same as `show(latex(A).compile())`. Or am I wrong? If yes, can we just replace the code of `view` by this command?

Making `view` an alias for `show(latex(..).compile())` doesn't make it one bit more self-explanatory.

The only real alternative is make latex objects display graphically by default, i.e.

sage: latex(1/2)

+1, there should be a method of `LatexExpr` that shows it pretty like `LatexExpr.__pprint__` that is used by the displayhook thing.

> Thats possible, but I think many people use latex to generate latex code to paste into their articles and not to get cute pictures in the notebook.


Well, they could still do:

```
sage: latex(1/2) # shows graphically
sage: print latex(1/2) # prints the source
```

There is some kind of solution to the original problem of this ticket at #19515. The original problem was:

```
view(latex(transducers.GrayCode())) 
``` 
shows the transducer inplace in sagenb but it is a pitty that this does not work in the ipython notebook.

```
latex(transducers.GrayCode())
```
writes tikz-code.
