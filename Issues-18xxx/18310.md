This ticket:

- Implements the option `sparse` for `CombinatorialFreeModule.Element._vector_`
- Implements `Modules.WithBasis.FiniteDimensional.ParentMethods.matrix` for building a matrix from a list of elements
- Refactors `Modules.WithBasis.FiniteDimensional.MorphismMethods.matrix` to use the latter and accept the option `sparse`

This is a follow up to #11111.

It's based on #16659 due to a trivial syntactic conflict. Since #16659
is likely to be positive reviewed very soon, it's probably not worth
it making it independent.

I am happy with them; thanks! Isn't triple quoting of strings kind of
overkill? Not that I really mind, but it's kind of heavy handed and
really Sphinx should do that for us ...

Oops; just a marker I had left for myself and I later forgot. There is
a basic implementation now! Back to needs review.

It's 2 backticks and then a quote, so it gives it that nice code look in the (non-interactive) doc (I prefer this because it is meant to reflect exact user input).

<a id='comment:11'></a>The `base_ring` argument of `matrix()` is not documented in the `INPUT` block.

IMHO, this belongs in the discussion on Trac, not in the docstring, especially the reference to a future hypothetical fix for #18312:

```
Constructing a sparse matrix with this method is currently
really much faster than building it from sparse vectors;
see :trac:`18312`::

    sage: n = 10^3; F = CombinatorialFreeModule(QQ, range(n)); vectors = [F.zero()]*n
    sage: %timeit m = F.matrix(vectors, sparse=True) # not tested
    The slowest run ...
    1000 loops, best of 3: 466 µs per loop
    sage: %timeit m = matrix(QQ, [v._vector_(sparse=True) for v in vectors], sparse=True) # not tested
    1 loops, best of 3: 1.19 s per loop

When :trac:`18312` will be fixed, using this method is
likely to still save some constant time factor.
```

And finally a question: is this new code relevant only for combinatorial free modules or also "normal" free modules?

Answering my own question: for normal free modules, it seems that `matrix()` just returns `basis_matrix()`. That's an annoying inconsistency. I actually see no reason to have this `matrix()` alias for `basis_matrix()`.

Proposal: define `matrix(*args, **kwds)` in free modules which calls `basis_matrix()` if no arguments are given (this should be deprecated) and calls the modified(*) categories implementation if any argument is supplied.

(*) The `base_ring` of the resulting matrix should be the `coordinate_ring`, not the `base_ring` of the free module.

Oops, fixed. Thanks!

I don't agree. This is not a discussion about how to implement this
ticket, but an information for the user, indicating the relevance of
this method in the short and long term. She has little chance to find
this information if it's only on trac.

> And finally a question: is this new code relevant only for

It's meant for any FiniteDimensionalModulesWithBasis. When "normal"
free modules will finally be in this category, they will benefit from
this code; one of the thing to settle for this is the syntax to
iterate through the terms. Up to this syntax detail, I believe this
generic code from this ticket should work properly.

Ah, this raises a good point: FreeModule already defines a `matrix`
method, so we have a name conflict. Any good alternative name
suggestion?

+1.

Do you agree that this should go in #10672 rather than here? It would
be weird to have matrix call a method that is not yet available from
the categories. As a first step, we could just deprecate
`FreeModule.matrix` for now. What do you think?

> (*) The `base_ring` of the resulting matrix should be the `coordinate_ring`, not the `base_ring` of the free module.


Gasp, another inconsistency: most other modules in Sage (polynomial
rings, matrix space, ...) don't define coordinate_ring: there it's
assumed that the coefficients of elements live in `base_ring`.  Ok,
clarifying this is for #10672 since it's not about this specific
method, but about all uses of `base_ring`.

Thanks for the thoughts
