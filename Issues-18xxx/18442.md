The boundary of a polytope is a CW-complex for which we compute a geometric realization of its barycentric subdivision as follows:

A complete flag of faces `F_0,F_1,...,F_{d-1},F_{d`} is a nested sequence of faces starting with a vertex `F_0` and ending with the full `d`-dimensional polytope `P` such that the dimension of `F_i` is `i`.

To each complete flag of faces we can assign a simplex whose vertices are the geometric barycenter of the `d+1` faces in the complete flag. This gives a subdivision of the polytope into simplices. The number of simplices is equal to the number of complete chains in the face lattice.

Similarly, it is possible to define the barycentric subdivision of the boundary of a compact polytope by taking only the complete flag of faces up to `d-1`-dimensional faces. The simplicial complex realizing this barycentric subdivision can be realized convexly by pulling the barycenters to the outside of the polytope with a convenient factor.

The result of such a process is a polytope whose facets correspond to complete flags of faces of the original polytope.

This method computes a geometric realization of the barycentric subdivision of the boundary of a compact polyhedron.

Do you really need to build a polyhedron so many times ?

The doctest with pentagon in AA was very slow. I replaced AA by RDF and it failed.

<a id='comment:16'></a>Hi again,

So, I looked at bit at the literature, maybe I'm missing some efficient way to compute it...

Suppose we have a very round polytope and we want to do the barycentric subdivision of it. To do it, I used the face fan of the polar (which is the normal fan of the original) for the implementation since cutting by an hyperplane was algorithmically easier than adding a vertex (as I saw it...).

We need to start with adding a vertex at the barycenter of all the facets. This is done dually by chopping every vertex of the polar polytope. The "chopping height" is determined by the location of the vertices of the polytope: we cut 1/3 of the shortest edge touching this vertex in the direction of the normal of the hyperplane.

Once all the facets are done, we really need (I believe) to compute an intermediate polytope to proceed to the ridges and lower dimensional faces to subdivide, since the location of the next cuts will depend on the location of the newly created vertices (remember that the polytope is assumed very round so the interval in which we can put the next vertices depend highly on the previous ones).

Topologically, this is not necessary, but to realize the barycentric subdivision convexly I'm afraid this is necessary.

In any case, I believe that the barycentric subdivision is known to be very costly (counting flags in a lattice grows exponentially...) so it is to be expected that it gets slow very fast. Of course, it also depends in which ring the computation is done.

Does the way I used make sense at all?

-The barycentric subdivision of a compact polytope is a new polytope obtained by subdividing every face of the polytope by a vertex. Its faces are in bijection with flags of faces of the input polytope.
+The barycentric subdivision of a compact polytope P is obtained as follows:
+
+A complete flag of faces `F_0,F_1,...,F_{d-1},F_{d`} is a nested sequence of faces starting with a vertex `F_0` and ending with the full `d`-dimensional polytope `P` such that the dimension of `F_i` is `i`.
+
+To each complete flag of faces we can assign a simplex whose vertices are the geometric barycenter of the `d+1` faces in the complete flag. This gives a subdivision of the polytope into simplices. The number of simplices is equal to the number of complete chains in the face lattice.
+
+Similarly, it is possible to define the barycentric subdivision of the boundary of a compact polytope by taking only the complete flag of faces up to `d-1`-dimensional faces. The simplicial complex realizing this barycentric subdivision can be realized convexly by pulling the barycenters to the outside of the polytope with a convenient factor.

Basically the notion of polytope is subsumed in Sage by the class Polyhedron.

Theorically a polyhedron (with H representation) is always decomposed as the sum of a polyhedral cone and a convex polytope, therefore polytopes are considered in the class polyhedron simply where the cone is a point, and the way to detect them is by checking compactness.

you might also find definitions of polyheda, as finite unions of convex polyhedra.
That is, convexity is not always assumed.

This is true, for example in rigidity theory. As far as I know, the Polyhedron class in Sage deals only with convex polyhedra. In this case, it is assumed that it is convex.

The boundary of a polytope is a CW-complex for which we compute a geometric realization of its barycentric subdivision.

<a id='comment:30'></a>The discussion on sage-devel available here:

Led me to only test for rational polytopes. The barycentric subdivision is fast enough on the rationals and will ultimately lead to problems in RDF in any case, therefore I would say it is not necessary to test it.

I would say it is also not necessary to warn the user, as the user should know that doing such computations in RDF will lead to errors.

Is that reasonable?

there is also a backend to work with real algebraic numbers.
(`Polyhedron(...., backend='field'...)`)
I think your code needs to be tested with it, too...
