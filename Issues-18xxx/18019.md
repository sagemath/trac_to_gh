I have wrote a simple program for addition and multiplication in Sage  using mpfi . same thing when I runs in Perl it took much lesser time
Example::

```
sage: %runfile test3.sage
3.14159265358979323846264338328? is the mpfi number 
10.4374148846 seconds time for  1000000 divisions
sage: %runfile test3a.sage
3.14159265358979323846264338328? is the mpfi number 
8.87430405617 seconds time for  1000000 additions
sage: 


akhi@akhi:~$ perl test3.pl
[3.1415926535897932384626433832793,3.1415926535897932384626433832825] is the mpfi number
total time =  2 seconds time for  1000000 divisions 
akhi@akhi:~$ perl test3a.pl
[3.1415926535897932384626433832793,3.1415926535897932384626433832825] is the mpfi number
total time =  2 seconds time for  1000000 additions

Hi Paul,

Akhilesh is sitting next to me here at Sage Days 75. Would you have any insight about the speed difference between Sage and Perl here?

Amiti√©s,
                                Nicolas
