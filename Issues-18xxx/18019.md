I have wrote a simple program for addition and multiplication in Sage  using mpfi . same thing when I runs in Perl it took much lesser time
Example::

```
sage: %runfile test3.sage
3.14159265358979323846264338328? is the mpfi number 
10.4374148846 seconds time for  1000000 divisions
sage: %runfile test3a.sage
3.14159265358979323846264338328? is the mpfi number 
8.87430405617 seconds time for  1000000 additions
sage: 


akhi@akhi:~$ perl test3.pl
[3.1415926535897932384626433832793,3.1415926535897932384626433832825] is the mpfi number
total time =  2 seconds time for  1000000 divisions 
akhi@akhi:~$ perl test3a.pl
[3.1415926535897932384626433832793,3.1415926535897932384626433832825] is the mpfi number
total time =  2 seconds time for  1000000 additions 
akhi@akhi:~$

Hi Paul,

Akhilesh is sitting next to me here at Sage Days 75. Would you have any insight about the speed difference between Sage and Perl here?

Amiti√©s,
                                Nicolas
