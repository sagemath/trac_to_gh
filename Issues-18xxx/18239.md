Computing the Cayley graph of a group and generator set is extremely slow in Sage. The only reasonable solution was to use GRAPE directly. 

As an example, let `p` and `q` be two permutations

A = PermutationGroup([p,q])
p,q = A(p),A(q)
```

Then, the following code

```
G = A.cayley_graph(generators=[p, q, p.inverse()], simple=True)
```
takes **26** seconds to finish  and it returns a DiGraph that still to be converted to a Graph.

With the branch applied

```
sage: %time G = A.cayley_graph(generators=[p, q, p.inverse()], simple=True)
CPU times: user 192 ms, sys: 4 ms, total: 196 ms
Wall time: 193 ms
```

Crazy speed up: x130 :-)

A previous workaround was to do

```
gout = gap('UndirectedEdges(CayleyGraph((Group(' + str(x) + ',' + str(g)+ ' )), [' + str(g) + ',' + str(x) + ',' + str(g.inverse()) + ']));') 
ast.literal_eval(str(gout))
```
which takes **0.4s**. Note that the last example assumed ast is imported and also that

```
gap.LoadPackage('"grape"')
```
was loaded.

As far as I've profiled it seems that most of the time is spent multiplying PermutationGroup elements.

Also I am not sure but perhaps GRAPE is perhaps implemented in C and is already more efficient for this reason alone.

Well, being a C code may explain why it could be faster but now why it would be SO much faster.

It turns out [1] that there are several implementations of this `cayley_graph` function. There is one in `sage.categories.semigroups` and another in `groups/group.pyx`. Do you know which one is run by your code ?

It would help if you could share this group A.

Oh, I forgot to write that - the group A is the one generated by x and g.

```
A = PermutationGroup([x,g])
```

As far as I've researched into this, the sage.categories.semigroups cayley_graph function is called.

Indeed! Modifying the `__iter__` function in `PermutationGroup_generic` I got

```
sage: timeit("for x in A: pass")
5 loops, best of 3: 116 ms per loop
```
Instead of

```
sage: timeit("for x in A: pass")
... still waiting
```

Do you know why the `list` method in the same class is cached?

I've got a good news and a bad news. Good news: we can shave 200ms off again.

Bad news: we don't have two but three implementations of `cayley_graph`. One of them in `old.py`, which is used by default by `PermutationGroup` `>_<`

A reason to not wipe out two among the three: None.

A reason to have a single function in the graph folder: I'd say none. Because Nicolas decided that whatever applied to all groups should be in categories/.

Honestly I do not care at all. I see two ways out:

1) You want it to coincide with the Python implementation, and so let's do it right

2) You don't need it to coincide, and then I don't see why it has to be this complicated.
