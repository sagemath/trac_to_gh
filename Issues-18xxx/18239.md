Computing the Cayley graph of a group and generator set is extremely slow in Sage. The only reasonable solution was to use GRAPE directly. 

As an example, let `p` and `q` be two permutations

A = PermutationGroup([p,q])
p,q = A(p),A(q)
```

Then, the following code

```
G = A.cayley_graph(generators=[p, q, p.inverse()], simple=True)
```
takes **26** seconds to finish  and it returns a DiGraph that still to be converted to a Graph.

With the branch applied

```
sage: %time G = A.cayley_graph(generators=[p, q, p.inverse()], simple=True)
CPU times: user 192 ms, sys: 4 ms, total: 196 ms
Wall time: 193 ms
```

Crazy speed up: x130 :-)

A previous workaround was to do

```
gout = gap('UndirectedEdges(CayleyGraph((Group(' + str(x) + ',' + str(g)+ ' )), [' + str(g) + ',' + str(x) + ',' + str(g.inverse()) + ']));') 
ast.literal_eval(str(gout))
```
which takes **0.4s**. Note that the last example assumed ast is imported and also that

```
gap.LoadPackage('"grape"')
```
was loaded.

+Computing the Cayley graph of a group and generator set is extremely slow in Sage. The solution is to use GRAPE directly. 
 
-Constructing Cayley graphs is**  awfully** slow, compared to what we can get with GAP. Example
+As an example
 
-Let $x,g$ be two permutations
+
+Let x,g be two permutations
 
 ```

Do you know what the bottleneck is?

As far as I've profiled it seems that most of the time is spent multiplying PermutationGroup elements.

Also I am not sure but perhaps GRAPE is perhaps implemented in C and is already more efficient for this reason alone.

Well, being a C code may explain why it could be faster but now why it would be SO much faster.

It turns out [1] that there are several implementations of this `cayley_graph` function. There is one in `sage.categories.semigroups` and another in `groups/group.pyx`. Do you know which one is run by your code ?

It would help if you could share this group A.

Oh, I forgot to write that - the group A is the one generated by x and g.

```
A = PermutationGroup([x,g])
```

As far as I've researched into this, the sage.categories.semigroups cayley_graph function is called.

Indeed! Modifying the `__iter__` function in `PermutationGroup_generic` I got

```
sage: timeit("for x in A: pass")
5 loops, best of 3: 116 ms per loop
```
Instead of

```
sage: timeit("for x in A: pass")
... still waiting
```

Do you know why the `list` method in the same class is cached?

A reason to not wipe out two among the three: None.

A reason to have a single function in the graph folder: I'd say none. Because Nicolas decided that whatever applied to all groups should be in categories/.

Right, this is not exactly the same as the Python implementation. Do you want me that it coincides with tuples as it was the case before? Note that in Python implementation len goes from n-1 to 0. Would it be better with some salt like

Right, this is not exactly the same as the Python implementation. Do you want me that it coincides with tuples as it was the case before? Note that in Python implementation len goes from n-1 to 0. Would it be better with some salt like
>

> mult += <long>(82520L + i + self.n)
> ```


Honestly I do not care at all. I see two ways out:

1) You want it to coincide with the Python implementation, and so let's do it right

2) You don't need it to coincide, and then I don't see why it has to be this complicated.
