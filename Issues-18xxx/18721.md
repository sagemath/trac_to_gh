This is a follow-up to #17686 and #17924.

There are still failures in `sagenb`, we should replace all uses of `pexpect.spawn` by `SageSpawn`.

Erik and I just ran "make ptestlong" with Sage 7.1.beta2 inside the docker image on
https://hub.docker.com/r/sagemath/sagemath-develop/, and all tests passed.

Jeroen suggests the failures may have been solved by the upgrade of pexpect in Sage 7.0: #10295.

Let's wait a bit for more data points, and then maybe we can close this ticket.
