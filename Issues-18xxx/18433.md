```
The code for computing this (and many similar things) in Sage-6.7 (and all previous versions):

```
Gamma0(11000).dimension_new_cusp_forms()
```
is just a "dumb" recurrence, which could be slow if the level is highly composite.  I just noticed Greg Martin wrote a paper

   http://www.math.ubc.ca/~gerg/papers/downloads/DSCFN.pdf

and slides
  
   http://www.math.ubc.ca/~gerg/slides/Vancouver-13Sep12.pdf

that give a direct formula for computing the dimension of the new subspace for Gamma0(N).  This may as well get coded up by somebody!  And probably wouldn't be hard. 

Before:

```
sage: G=Gamma0(factorial(12))
sage: %timeit dimension_new_cusp_forms(G)
1 loop, best of 3: 556 ms per loop
```
after:

```
sage: G=Gamma0(factorial(12))
sage: %timeit dimension_new_cusp_forms(G)
The slowest run took 9.05 times longer than the fastest.
This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
10000 loops, best of 3: 166 µs per loop

```

I also checked it against the slides and they seem correct. Performance looks good as well.

old:

```
sage: G = Gamma0(prod(prime_range(20)))
sage: %timeit G.dimension_new_cusp_forms()
10 loops, best of 3: 36.3 ms per loop
sage: G = Gamma0(next_prime(10000))
sage: %timeit G.dimension_new_cusp_forms()
1000 loops, best of 3: 161 µs per loop
sage: G = Gamma0(next_prime(1000000))
sage: %timeit G.dimension_new_cusp_forms()
10000 loops, best of 3: 163 µs per loop
```

new:

```
sage: G = Gamma0(prod(prime_range(20)))
sage: %timeit G.dimension_new_cusp_forms()
The slowest run took 4.19 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
10000 loops, best of 3: 89.8 µs per loop
sage: G = Gamma0(next_prime(10000))
sage: %timeit G.dimension_new_cusp_forms()
10000 loops, best of 3: 60.4 µs per loop
sage: G = Gamma0(next_prime(1000000))
sage: %timeit G.dimension_new_cusp_forms()
The slowest run took 16.03 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
10000 loops, best of 3: 71 µs per loop
