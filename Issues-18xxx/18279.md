Through the use of Weil restriction we can reduce the problem of rational points over number fields to QQ-rational points. Combining the Weil restriction functionality with the rational preperiodic point functionality, we can extend the latter to number fields.

<a id='comment:4'>Comment 4:</a>
- the point at infinity will always be a totally ramified fixed point so no check is needed
- Maps over QQbar seem get incorrect output:

```
P.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(QQbar,1)
H = End(P)
f = H([x^2-y^2,y^2])
print f.rational_preperiodic_points()
```
returns None

but 

```
P.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(QQbar,1)
H = End(P)
f = H([x^2-y^2,y^2])
f = f._number_field_from_algebraics()
print f.rational_preperiodic_points()
```
returns [(1 : 1), (1 : 0), (-1 : 1), (0 : 1)]

Everything looks good, but there is just a small typo (I think it was there before the commits though)

-in line 3110, Determined should be Determines

Also, it looks like the first lines of the documentation for `rational_preperiodic_graph` are the same as those of `rational_preperiodic_points`, but the function returns the graph of the preperiodic points
