This adds a new function that computes maximal (proper) sublattices of the lattice.

It could be faster to reverse thinking: instead of computing sublattice try to get a minimal "remainder" of sublattice. For example the remainder must be a connected poset and it's every minimal element may not have more than one lower cover. However, this slow implementation at least works, and can be used as a checkpoint when making faster implementations.

<a id='comment:2'></a>There is now some code that at least seems to work. This is quite interesting optimization problem. Can this be made to real `maximal_sublattices_iterator()` instead of `maximal_sublattices()` (that internally generates some non-maximal sublattices and then discards them).

I tried googling some time, but find no algorithm for this. This is somewhat ad hoc solution.

- I think you could change the test `sorted([sorted(list(x)) for x in ms])` to `sorted(ms, key=sorted)` (note that I didn't actually try this).
