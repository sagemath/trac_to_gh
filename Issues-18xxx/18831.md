Various methods of point counts on a hyperelliptic curve produce a result but disagree.

```python
R.<t> = PolynomialRing(GF(11))
H = HyperellipticCurve(t^5 -t + 1)
print H.count_points()
print H.count_points_exhaustive()
print H.count_points_frobenius_polynomial()
print H.count_points_matrix_traces()
```

Output:

```
[8]
[19]
[19]
[8]
```

This is reproducible in the single cell sage server and sagecloud.

I guess there is a problem with the p-adic precision used.
The formula used should be checked.
It currently reads:

```
(ZZ(4*g).exact_log(p) + n//2).floor() + 1
```
The `4*g` part does not look so good.

Actually it makes senses, it comes from expressing the trace of the frobenius on an extension as a sum of powers of the eigenvalues.
So maybe the `//` is the problem.

Should be ok now.

I've also cleaned up the Sphinx doc a little bit.
