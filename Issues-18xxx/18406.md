<div id="comment:0"></div>

The docstring for `show` is raw (`r""" ... """`)
and contains

```
`[0,1]\\times[0,1]`
```
which does not render right in the
[show documentation](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/plotting/sage/plot/graphics.html#sage.plot.graphics.Graphics.show).

In a raw string, `\\times` becomes `\\` (newline) + `times`.

The fix is to use `\times` instead of `\\times`.

Ran `make` and `make doc-pdf` successfully.

Checked both html and pdf; that instance of
`[0,1]\times[0,1]` now renders fine in both.

Found no other similar problem needing fixing.
