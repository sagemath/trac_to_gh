We implement a mechanism for metaclasses in Cython. The interface is different from Python (mostly because we have to work within the limits of Cython). Once a metaclass is defined, it works both from Cython and Python.

Once Sage has figured out how to use this properly, we can propose a wishlist item to upstream Cython.

If we're going to provide a hook to modify type structures around `PyType_Ready` we should *FIRST* provide a hook that modifies the type structure just *BEFORE* `PyType_Ready` runs on it. The beef we have presently is with the type structure that cython produces to offer to `PyType_Ready`, not with the CPython CAPI mandated protocol:

The `tp_traverse` and `tp_visit` routines that cython cooks up are insufficient in these situations, and similarly with `tp_hash` and `tp_compare` and `tp_richcompare`: we can just fill in those fields (all of them!) prior to `PyType_Ready` in order to get exactly the result we want.

The way that the CPython CAPI suggests that you create a type is that you *first* create the `PyType` structure and *then* offer it to `PyType_Ready` for completion, consistency checking, and registration in the system. I don't think that they specifically forbid modifying the structure but they certainly not define the effects it might have (and since they don't specify *everything* that PyType_Ready does, it could change in the future, so those effects might change).

So if we're going to add a protocol to cython it must be to inject custom code *between* cython producing the first draft of the `PyType` structure and it being handed to `PyType_Ready`. We already have a way of running code after that: just put it immediately below the class definition, so I'm pretty sure an extra protocol for adding code after will never be accepted (even independent of the fact it would have undefined behaviour by the CPython CAPI).

Further comments:
`__typeinit__` should (eventually) be a special method, that automatically has its argument typed as "type". At that stage the method wouldn't need to make it into the tp_dict at all (and perhaps we should be removing it presently too? These methods usually do dangerous stuff, so it would be good if the user wouldn't be able to get their hands on the thing.

I see a possible hickup with the current design where `_typeinit__` would be executed prior to `PyType_Ready`: The head of the (statically allocated) PyType structure isn't initialized with the appropriate type (it would need `&PyType_Type` but that's not a compile-time constant, so isn't allowed in the static def):

```
  PyVarObject_HEAD_INIT(0, 0)
```
This is one of the things that `PyType_Ready` fixes. If we're going to pass that structure around to `__typeinit__` we might be in for nasty surprises. So perhaps the lined code should also set the type field of the structure prior to passing it on (simple experimentation will show if that's necessary). Otherwise, I think there shouldn't be an issue with running `__typeinit__` prior to `PyType_Ready`.

There is a further one concerning inheritance: I don't think we want to inherit `__typeinit__`, so we need to be careful in how we look up the method. Perhaps we should look up the method in `t.tp_dict` (or probably `t.tp_methods` at this point, since I think `PyType_Ready` constructs the `t.tp_dict` entries from that). This would only be a temporary thing: in cython proper one would handle this by having detected the special method.

I absolutely **do** think we should inherit `__typeinit__`. The most powerful uses are exactly those which involve inheritance. If you only want this for one type, you can easily do

```
def __typeinit__(cls):

Before `PyType_Ready()`, there is not much that will work on a type. Even the lookup of the method `__typeinit__` will very likely fail. Honestly, I don't see what is wrong with modifying a type after `PyType_Ready` and I actually think it is much safer *after* than before.

Not really. There is *a lot* of stuff that happens between `PyType_Ready` and the execution of the code immediately below the class definition. In particular: all types are created first, and then the other code is executed. When inheritance is involved, you really want to create type A, patch type A, create type B (subtype of A), patch type B, ...

It would only work when a cython class inherits it (perhaps even only `cdef class`?). However, subclassing using python would not give the opportunity for `__typeinit__` to execute. Unreliable inheritance is, I think, worse than none.\n\nI guess your interesting application of using inheritance is to circumvent python's tendency of not inheriting `tp_hash, tp_richcompare, tp_compare` in various situations (you were planning to put a default back if one of them is NULL?) That's precarious to get \"right\" and with unreliable inheritance basically impossible. I think the python API designers made a very conscious choice that we should probably not try to circumvent in general and only in special cases (which a non-inheriting `__typeinit__` would accomplish).",

Well, that's a hack too: [https://github.com/cython/cython/commit/31890343f048e58ebe7986cf56d6fbdeaf7c16b7](https://github.com/cython/cython/commit/31890343f048e58ebe7986cf56d6fbdeaf7c16b7) which was introduced after our work on WeakValueDict: [https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/cython-users/ktsXt_o4M0Q/OwmQ_33iXLgJ](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/cython-users/ktsXt_o4M0Q/OwmQ_33iXLgJ)

If you want to inherit `__typeinit__` then you'd pretty much have to run it after `PyType_Ready`, because it will be virtually impossible to find where to inherit it from otherwise.

My main reason to want to avoid hacking after `PyType_Ready` has done its thing is to avoid making assumptions about what it does. You should probably at least run `PyType_ClearCache` after you're done. It looks like in Python3 there's now `PyType_Modified`, which would be a more targeted way of notifying Python of the fact that a type structure has been changed (the fact that they offer a routine to do so actually makes me a little more comfortable changing `PyType` structures later on).

I think it's worth running the pros and cons of where to run `__typeinit__`, and whether inheriting it will be safe enough (it smells like a bug trap to me), by the cython people. I'd imagine Stefan and Robert might have some smart things to say about it.

**edit:** One of the problems with "inheriting" `__typeinit__` is that you can't reliably do so. It would only work when a cython class inherits it (perhaps even only `cdef class`?). However, subclassing using python would not give the opportunity for `__typeinit__` to execute. Unreliable inheritance is, I think, worse than none.

I guess your interesting application of using inheritance is to circumvent python's tendency of not inheriting `tp_hash, tp_richcompare, tp_compare` in various situations (you were planning to put a default back if one of them is NULL?) That's precarious to get "right" and with unreliable inheritance basically impossible. I think the python API designers made a very conscious choice that we should probably not try to circumvent in general and only in special cases (which a non-inheriting `__typeinit__` would accomplish).

I'm sure of it, given that the implications for equality directly violate the python rules. I also think that it doesn't become easier to write correct code if the sage library will reinstate arbitrary equality and hashing functions, for which it is vitally important to design and test them together. Having a hook that enables you to transplant them (rather than wrap, with efficiency penalty) on a one-by-one basis seems a very good solution, however.

We should try and avoid hacks if we reasonably can, because they are a maintenance burden.I am not convinced yet that we can't avoid using a hack here.

I read the ticket description as a proposal to work out way of dealing with class customization in a way that can eventually be proposed upstream to cython. I don't think cython will be interested in accepting a hack.

If we have to resort to a hack for the `__richcmp__` problem (which we very well might have to), I think a cleaner solution would be to just have something (probably in sage.structure.element) along the lines of:

```
def fix_richcmp(T):
    (<PyTypeObject*><type?>T).tp_richcompare=Element.tp_richcompare
    PyType_Modified(T)
```
and simply document that if you override `__hash__` on an ElementType, you should be calling `fix_richcmp` on that type right after definition. I think we might be able to let that apply in both python and cython uniformly.

Plus: we get something that works uniformly across cython and python
Minus: it requires 1 line of boilerplate for every time that `__hash__` gets redefined.
Neutral: in either case, the end result is the same
Plus: the `fix_richcmp` thing is also a hack, but it announces itself by being present in all locations where it is used, rather than a silent `__typeinit__` that is defined in an entirely different location and may or may not take effect.

further investigation: Is it a problem that in cython the call to PyType_Ready and the call to `fix_richcmp` get separated a little? I don't think it is, but I might be overlooking something.

If you agree with the rest of the ticket, I can remove that.

It's just that whenever I propose a new mechanism, I always like to add a simple example of using it. This is to show how to use it and to test that it actually works.

I see the following potential other use cases, neither of which is simple enough to implement it as part of this ticket:
1. Some version of `ClassCallMetaclass` which can be used in Cython
2. Patching `tp_new` of `Integer` in a cleaner way (which is more involved than the `coerce_dict` examples)
3. Inheriting comparisons.

Yes, as far as I can see, your proposal comes as close as possible to offering metaclass support to cython, and I think it's reasonable to have that.

> It's just that whenever I propose a new mechanism, I always like to add a simple example of using it. This is to show how to use it and to test that it actually works.


Yes, it's just seems the case that by the time you hit metaclasses, any simple example is an inappropriate use. It definitely served a purpose in getting the required features figured out.

How I understand the issue there, I think presently that putting everything in the metaclass.__init__ rather than delegating to a `__typeinit__` would be cleaner.

I can see potential uses for `__typeinit__` if we're in a situation where things that the metaclass itself doesn't have direct access to need to be installed (so basically when we find that we have to write multiple metaclasses to do similar things on multiple classes, only because we don't have a way of passing the required info to `metaclass.__init__`. The process in `allocator.pyx` would be an example, if we were to find that metaclasses are the right tool for that.

Looking at #18329, I see a non-trivial problem appearing: metaclasses are a pain when (multiple) inheritance is involved:

```
class MA(type):
    pass

class MB(type):
    pass

class A(object):
    __metaclass__ = MA

class B(object):
    __metaclass__ = MB

class C(A, B):
    pass
```
gives

```
TypeError: Error when calling the metaclass bases
    metaclass conflict: the metaclass of a derived class must be a (non-strict) subclass of the metaclasses of all its bases
```
In this case, you need to manually define a new metaclass inheriting from `MA` and `MB`.

This problem will appear in many places where `ClasscallMetaclass` is used on subclasses of `Element`.

So, either we fix this manually in all cases (there are many in `combinat`) or we somehow define a metametaclass to deal with this problem (it's `type.__new__()` which raises this exception).

(this patch is just adding files so there's little chance for conflicts)

Slight oversight: still a reference to `__typeinit__` surviving:

```

I thought I had a solution for this problem and I worked half a day today to implement it. It works fine in Python 2 (and Python < 3.2.3) but not in later Python versions and not in Cython 0.22.

This is the subtle difference in metaclasses: consider the statement

```
class C(A, B):
    pass
```

In Python < 3.2.3, the metaclass of the first base is used, i.e. the statement is essentially parsed as

```
C = type(A)("C", (A,B), {})
```
This means that `type(A).__new__` could avoid a metaclass conflict.

But in recent Python versions, the metaclass is computed first and

```
C = metaclass("C", (A,B), {})
```
is called, where `metaclass` is the result of calling `_PyType_CalculateMetaclass()`, which also checks for conflicts. This means that a metaclass now has absolutely no chance to avoid a conflict.

I don't understand what the problem is. This works for me in Python 3.3.2:

```
class MA(type):
    def __init__(self,*args):
      print("calling MA on ",self," with ",args)

class MB(type):
    def __init__(self,*args):
      print("calling MB on ",self," with ",args)

class MC(MA,MB):
    def __init__(self,*args):
      print("calling MC on ",self," with ",args)

class A(object, metaclass=MA):
    pass

class B(object, metaclass=MB):
    pass

class C(A,B,metaclass=MC):
    pass
```
Indeed, we need to specify a metaclass for `C` explicitly, but we need to do that in 2.7 too. Can you be a little more specific what the actual problem is?

Using the C API, I can arrange things such that we **don't** need to specify `C` explicitly. My solution constructs a new metaclass dynamically if there is a conflict.

Using the notation of the example above, in Python <3.2.3, it's `type(A).tp_new` which is responsible for setting up the correct metaclass, and this can be customized. In Python >=3.2.3, the metaclass is computed by the `__build_class__` builtin function, before any `tp_new` can get its hands on the class.

In my opinion, the penalty in the form of some extra `__metaclass__=...` lines (100 of them in total according to your count I think?) is better than inventing some "universal" metaclass that grows all kinds of special methods to indicate which metaclass features should be activated.

Actually, what do you have against this "universal metaclass"? What is your opinion on the current `ClasscallMetaclass`? I ask because `ClassCallMetaclass` is already a simple version of such a universal metaclass (it checks for 4 special methods of a class and then does something if those methods exist).
