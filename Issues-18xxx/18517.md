Instead of creating totally new package types like `python2standard`, adding the following lines in `build/install` is sufficient to implement #17607:

```
if [ "$SAGE_PYTHON3" = yes ]; then
    echo >&5 'PYTHON = $(PYTHON3)'
else
    echo >&5 'PYTHON = $(PYTHON2)'
fi
```

Depends on #17607

Looks good to me. Should we rename the packages from `python` to `python2` and from `Python` to `python3` in this ticket?
