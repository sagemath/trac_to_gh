CC:  @ohanar @vbraun @nathanncohen

Instead of creating totally new package types like `python2standard`, adding the following lines in `build/install` is sufficient to implement #17607:

```
if [ "$SAGE_PYTHON3" = yes ]; then
    echo >&5 'PYTHON = $(PYTHON3)'
else
    echo >&5 'PYTHON = $(PYTHON2)'
fi
```
