Yes. And the reason is because Python int do not behave as Sage integers. For example

```
sage: S = my_finite_set()
sage: S.cardinality().factor()
sage: ~(S.cardinality())
```
For coherence, we need to have some specifications for `.cardinality`.

The main reason for that ticket was that some sets were actually returning rational numbers see [#17852 comment:92](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/17852#comment:92)

This is very bad. Imagine I need something like:

```
sage: vector([s.cardinality() for s in S])
```
If any of the `s.cardinality()` returns a rational, I end up with a vector over rational numbers (which are much slower than over integers).

It is very similar to `is_X` functions that return boolean answers. You might complain if they start returning `gap` booleans or `numpy` boolean objects.

You do not want to see a Sage rational anymore? And what about `numpy` integers, `pari` integers, `gp` integers, `gap` integers and `libgap` integers?

Testing equality to infinity might be broken or you can have objects that want to be equal to everybody (why not?).

The specification in `sage.categories.sets_cat` is:

```
``self.cardinality()`` should return the cardinality of the set
``self`` as a sage :class:`Integer` or as ``infinity``.
```

If you complain that it should not be the case then you should argue why. And not telling me to argue why not.

I think that it should not be the case because python ints/long are smaller and faster than Sage Integers, and that we should not be forced to instantiate Integers if we do not need to.

For the very same reason you invoked, earlier, when you said that you did not want rationals because of the possible loss of time.

It was not only loss of time but well defineness. Additioning Python int with Sage integers is slower than Sage integer with Sage integer.

```
sage: python_one = 1r
sage: sage_one = 1
sage: sage_a = 2**12
sage: timeit("sage_a + python_one", number=5000000)
5000000 loops, best of 3: 66.3 ns per loop
sage: timeit("sage_a + sage_one", number=5000000)
5000000 loops, best of 3: 57.9 ns per loop
```
So it is better to have everything being Sage integers.

On the other hand, if you really want Python integers you should call `len(my_set)` (and be sure to obtain a Python integer) and not `my_set.cardinality()`.

Yes, and

sage: vector(ZZ, ['1', gap(2), pari(3)])
(1, 2, 3)

works too.

It is not sufficient. **You** were arguing that Python ints were better because faster. I just showed you that it is not completely right. An argument for `X` is generally not an argument for `Y`.

Just to be sure: I do not want to forbid Python integer in general. For the output of `.cardinality()` I consider that Sage integers are *always* better. Perhaps I am wrong and this can be debated if needed. And, as I already mentioned, you can get Python integer for less effort doing `len(my_set)`.

That is my goal. But we do not agree that returning an `int` for `.cardinality()` is an error. In many situation, "ensuring" that it is a Sage integer prevent doing wrong things afterwards.

> When you see a non-integer then something is most probably wrong and the testsuite should report it. What you are doing right now is simulate a "return type" for a function in a language that does not support it.

Yes. But having as dependency a ticket "switch from Python to a strongly typed language" would be too much effort. So Python is a fact and we have to deal with it.

Let me mention that Python is trying to do some type checking because it is useful:

```
sage: class A(object):
....:     def __len__(self):
....:         return 'haha! well tried!'
sage: a = A()
sage: len(a)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: an integer is required
```
(note that `a.__len__()` returns what you asked it to do).

I'd say we should ask for others' feeling on sage-devel before making a move here.
Personally I don't mind returning a Sage integer for cardinality, but Nathann does not agree.
So we should try to satisfy a large proportion of Sage users (or let Sage rot forever).

The arguments that I see on this thread are not about whether "cardinality" should return python ints or Sage integers. 

While the ticket is indeed about `.cardinality` only, you will see that the arguments given here can be applied to any other Sage function that returns integers.

Of course, having *all* such Sage functions return `Integer` objects is almost impossible to enforce, yet there is an easy way to enforce that for `.cardinality`, and this is what the branch implements.

That is not totally exact, since as Vincent mentioned it, you can replace `S.cardinality()` by `len(S)` if you want an `int`, and for efficiency concerns, `len(S.set())` is the fastest way to get it. Not all functions have this python counterpart.

As a user, I very much cares about the consistency in the return types. And I find this *very* annoying:

```python
sage: S = Set(range(2^20))
sage: T = CartesianProduct(S,S)
sage: T.cardinality().factor()
2^40
sage: S.cardinality().factor()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'factor'
```

Note that I still agree that the same argument may be used at some other places. For instance, let me consider univariate polynomials in sparse representation. I find the following very weird, and would be in favor of changing this behavior:

```python
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(ZZ, sparse=True)
sage: p = x^(2^100)+1
sage: map(lambda t: type(t), p.exponents())
[<type 'int'>, <type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>]
```

> I do not like what is going on here, but I will not oppose it. You are too many.

I've understood that (one of) your concern(s) is efficiency issues. But is it the only one? Don't you think that inconsistency also is a problem?
