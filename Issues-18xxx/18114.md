Could you add a check in the documentation that the map `automaton -> transducer -> input automaton` is an involution. Even with complicated input.

I am not convinced that the name of the function is the best choice because `A.transducer()` might be thought to do the same thing as `Transducer(A)`, but this is not the case:

```
sage: A = Automaton([(0, 0, 'A'), (0, 1, 'B'), (1, 2, 'C')])
sage: Transducer(A).transitions()
[Transition from 0 to 0: 'A'|-,
 Transition from 0 to 1: 'B'|-,
 Transition from 1 to 2: 'C'|-]
sage: A.transducer().transitions()
[Transition from 0 to 0: 'A'|'A',
 Transition from 0 to 1: 'B'|'B',
 Transition from 1 to 2: 'C'|'C']
```

A few minor remarks:
* There seems to be an indentation problem in the INPUT section of the docstring leading to unwanted wrapping in the html output.
* In view of the [recent discussion](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/RfJIEL79EnA/peSruqCwAG4J) on "SEE ALSO" sections, I recommend to include a link to `input_projection` and to the construction of a transducer from a given finite state machine.
* According to the [develeoper guide](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/coding_basics.html#the-docstring-of-a-function-content), the one sentence description should be "Construct ..." instead of "Constructs ...".
