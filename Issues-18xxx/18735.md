Sometimes one can use a fast numerical LP solver to solve a problem to "optimality", 
then reconstruct the primal and dual solution in rational arithmetic (or over whatever base_ring was used...) and in this way prove that this basis is indeed optimal. 
`MixedIntegerLinearProgram` should support this mode of operation.

The current branch, on top of #20296, attempts to do this by implementing a `HybridBackend`, which delegates to two backends:
- a fast, possibly inexact backend (Gurobi or GLPK or even GLPK with glp_exact -- see #18764) 
- a slow, exact one that can set the simplex basis (only `InteractiveLPBackend` fits the bill - from #20296)

Ideally, in pure LP mode, both backends would support the basis-status functions that can transplant the (hopefully) optimal (hopefully-)basis from the inexact LP to the exact LP.

If the inexact LP cannot provide a basis (because its "basis" is not a basis due to numerics, or because basis-status functions are not available), one could at least try to make use of the numerical solution vector and try to reconstruct a basis, like in interior-point-to-simplex crossover (a classical paper: http://www.caam.rice.edu/caam/trs/91/TR91-32.pdf)

In MIP mode, could at least try to set the cleaned-up numerical solution vector as a known solution, to speed up branch-and-cut in the exact solver. 

Sounds like a big ticket; we'll do this step by step.

#18685 provides the necessary basis-status functions (for the GLPK backend).
#18688 provides a solver-independent interface to these functions.
#18804 exposes basis status via backend dictionaries.

Would you mind providing an example of PPL choking on an LP doable in exact arithmetic by another solver? We use PPL's LP solver in  `codesize_upper_bound(...,algorithm="LP")` and never saw a problem... (Although perhaps the difficulty from entry sizes dominate the the one from the dimension in this case).

In our experiments here, we don't actually have numerical difficulties with floating-point based solvers; we just want to be sure that we have an exact optimal solution. With #18764 (glp_exact; please review) we have now run some tests to compare performance:

```
                                glp_simplex                glp_simplex+glp_exact
   glp_simplex    glp_exact     +glp_exact    ppl          + reconstruction in Sage
10  4.20            51.92             7.78    207.07          289.00
11  5.08            58.49             9.43    3451.42         574.72
12  7.55           101.72            11.32    1252.91         808.73
13  7.21           279.08            13.57    1424.28        1019.95
14  8.41           562.97            15.91    7343.37        1628.54
15 13.10           550.46            18.48    3667.93        2550.94
```

As you can see, PPL is much slower than pure glp_exact, and orders of magnitudes slower than glp_simplex followed by glp_exact.

However, currently when we try to reconstruct the solution from the combinatorial basis information, Sage's super slow matrix functions over the rationals get us back to roughly the same order of magnitude as PPL.

It would be interesting to know how the solvers perform on the kind of LPs that you have in mind.

LPs I get would be not possible to even enter into a solver without long integers/rationals.
That's e.g. behind this function call:

```
sage:  codesize_upper_bound(70,8,2,algorithm="LP")
9695943911863423
```
more explicitly, you can do

```
sage: v,p,r=delsarte_bound_hamming_space(70,8,2,return_data=True)
sage: p
Mixed Integer Program  ( maximization, 71 variables, 148 constraints )
```
constrains of `p` have entries as big as  112186277816662845432.

<a id='comment:25'></a>I don't like the changes to `src/sage/numerical/interactive_simplex_method.py` too much. 

Instead of extending `InteractiveLPProblemStandardForm.run_revised_simplex_method`, I think it's better to use the "run_simplex_method" method of the current_dictionary (a revised dictionary) directly.

Same amount of code, but would avoid making `interactive_simplex_method` more complicated.

<a id='comment:30'></a>What would be a better input form? Remove the second option and take only a list of indices? 

It is tricky because the indices here correspond to the variables in the `interactive_lp_problem().standard_form()`, and they not necessarily the same as the indices for `is_variable_basic` etc. which correspond to `interactive_lp_problem()`. See the following example.

```
from sage.numerical.backends.generic_backend import get_solver
h = get_solver(solver = ("InteractiveLP"))
h.add_variables(1, lower_bound=None, upper_bound=None);
h.add_variables(1, lower_bound=0, upper_bound=None);
h.add_linear_constraint([(0,2),(1,-1)],-1,None)
h.add_linear_constraint([(0,1),(1,-1)],None, 1)
h.add_linear_constraint([(0,1),(1,1)],2,2)
h.set_objective([0,-1])
lp = h.interactive_lp_problem(); view(lp)
st = lp.standard_form(); view(st)
R = st.coordinate_ring(); R

InteractiveLPBackend now has a new method `set_dictionary` and a new attribute `current_dictionary`. I didn't name it `set_basis`, to avoid confusion between the basic variables in a dictionary and those of the generic backend.

True. The current implementation enables what the first paragraph of this ticket states, by using `solver = ("GLPK", "InteractiveLP")` as in the examples in `solve`. However, it is hard to argue with doctests that this new hybrid backend is useful. Shall we close the ticket with the tag "wontfix" as in #18804?
