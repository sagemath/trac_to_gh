Then you must figure out which optional packages depend on which standard packages.

(it is not possible to add all standard packages as a dependency, as some 'optional' packages like python2 may also be standard in practice)

If the goal is to have more reliable optional packages, this needs to be done *anyway*. If some optional package depends on PARI and PARI gets rebuilt, then you really should rebuild the optional package too.

But setting up the right framework such that dependencies *can* be considered is within the scope of this ticket.

Easy fix: set all dependencies of optional packages to `| $(STANDARD_PACKAGES)`, which in practice is the same as your current patch, but allows to write the correct dependencies later.

Since many standard packages depend on Python, adding a dependency on `$(STANDARD_PACKAGES)` indirectly adds a dependency on Python.

Well, I proposed a new category for these packages :-)

I also wonder if we can use

```
if [ -f $SAGE_SPKG_INST/$PKG_NAME-* ]
```
since that will not work if there is more than 1 matching file.

No, the dependency `| $(STANDARD_PACKAGES)` is not a real dependency, it's just because we are too lazy to add the correct dependencies.

So, I think John's proposal might be good (but be sure to keep the empty dependencies for `mpir` and `gmp`)
