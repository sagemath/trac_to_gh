Sage is not able to identify partial sum in a substitution

```
sage: var('x,y')
sage: f = x + x^2 + x^4
sage: f.subs(x^2 == y)             # one term is fine
x^4 + x + y
sage: f.subs(x + x^2 == y)         # partial sum does not work
x^4 + x^2 + x
sage: f.subs(x + x^2 + x^4 == y)   # whole sum is fine
y
```
Similarly with products

```
sage: f = x * cos(x) * sin(x)
sage: f.subs( cos(x) * sin(x) == y)
x*cos(x)*sin(x)
```

As mentioned in the doc, this is the same behavior as in Maple but differ from Mathematica. We should be clearer on the semantic of `substitute` and potentially implement partial sum and product substitutions.

<a id='comment:2'></a>I'm not so sure we have to do more than document it. Obviously you cannot expect substitutions to happen on any "equal" subexpression, since that concept isn't well-defined.

The thing is: `x+x^2` isn't a syntactical subunit of `x + x^2 + x^4` for the internal representation, which is roughly `('+',x,('^',x,2))` versus `('+',x,('<sup>',x,2),('</sup>',x,4))`

You'll have to decide how much tricks are worthwhile to implement before you just add the relation `y-(x^2+x)` and ask for elimination of x via groebner bases.

I do not want to substitute "equal" subexpression but only identical ones. And doing so, I want to consider 'a+c' as a unit of 'a+b+c+d' and 'a*c' as a unit in 'a*b*c*d'. This is perhaps not desirable though.

I know, and this is precisely the purpose of the ticket.

> You'll have to decide how much tricks are worthwhile to implement before you just add the relation `y-(x^2+x)` and ask for elimination of x via groebner bases.


Note that `x + y - (u + v)` does not exist. But I agree that there is an ambiguous `+/-` issue (as far as the ticket description is concerned).
