Keywords: lp

For teaching, presentation, and debugging purposes, it could be powerful 
to have a function that sets up a `sage.numerical.interactive_simplex_method.LPDictionary`
corresponding to the current basis of a `MixedIntegerLinearProgram` (with all variables real). 

The plan is as follows:
- `MixedIntegerLinearProgram`.construct_interactive_lp() return an interactive LP (by querying the backend for problem data) and a list of basic variables (by querying the backend for col_stat, row_stat)
- from that information, can make an `LPDictionary` or `LPRevisedDictionary` by invoking the `dictionary` or `revised_dictionary` methods.

#18685 added the prerequisite basis status information for the case of the GLPK backend. #18763 did the same for the COIN backend.

See also: #18688, #18733

Follow-up: #18804 (LPBackendDictionary)

Hello,

You assume in this code that the backend is GLPK. Also, I have to say that I do not like this `get_variables` function much. It returns to the users the symbolic variables of the LP, to which he already has access through his calls to `new_variable`. We may need this kind of things for our own methods, but in this case I think that it would be better to work directly with the integer id of the variables than with the symbolic ones.

That woud lead us to make function like `get_values` accept an integer parameter (a variable's id), which is not a bad move. Especially if we plan to work with the dual LP later.

Also, return `[k for k in self._variables.keys()]` is better written as `self._variables().keys()`

Nathann

P.S.: Oh. And what about renaming "construct_interactive_lp" to "interactive_linear_program"? We usually try to write the long names in Sage.

Hi Nathann,

`new_variable` has been dropped for this ticket, and the method has been renamed to `interactive_linear_program` as you suggest.

The code is indeed GLPK-specific (explicit testing for it has been added) -- more general support would require designing a common interface to basis status, which is #18688.

Hello,

There are some possible improvements in the documentation:
- some of the lines are too long. Try to make them the same width as they are in the rest of the file.
- If you mention a class you can make a clickable reference to it by using :class:`name_of_the_class`
- You wrote ```"std"``` (as a string) and ```standard``` (as a variable). I guess both of them should be strings.
- you should add a line break after `TESTS::`

For all of these, look at the [reference manual](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#documentation-strings).
