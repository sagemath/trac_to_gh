For teaching, presentation, and debugging purposes, it could be powerful 
to have a function that sets up a `sage.numerical.interactive_simplex_method.LPDictionary`
corresponding to the current basis of a `MixedIntegerLinearProgram` (with all variables real). 

The plan is as follows:
- `MixedIntegerLinearProgram`.construct_interactive_lp() return an interactive LP (by querying the backend for problem data) and a list of basic variables (by querying the backend for col_stat, row_stat)
- from that information, can make an `LPDictionary` or `LPRevisedDictionary` by invoking the `dictionary` or `revised_dictionary` methods.

#18685 added the prerequisite basis status information for the case of the GLPK backend. #18763 did the same for the COIN backend.

Follow-up: #18804 (LPBackendDictionary)

<a id='comment:9'></a>Hello,

You assume in this code that the backend is GLPK. Also, I have to say that I do not like this `get_variables` function much. It returns to the users the symbolic variables of the LP, to which he already has access through his calls to `new_variable`. We may need this kind of things for our own methods, but in this case I think that it would be better to work directly with the integer id of the variables than with the symbolic ones.

That woud lead us to make function like `get_values` accept an integer parameter (a variable's id), which is not a bad move. Especially if we plan to work with the dual LP later.

Also, return `[k for k in self._variables.keys()]` is better written as `self._variables().keys()`

Nathann

P.S.: Oh. And what about renaming "construct_interactive_lp" to "interactive_linear_program"? We usually try to write the long names in Sage.

<a id='comment:12'></a>Hi Nathann,

`new_variable` has been dropped for this ticket, and the method has been renamed to `interactive_linear_program` as you suggest.

The code is indeed GLPK-specific (explicit testing for it has been added) -- more general support would require designing a common interface to basis status, which is #18688.

Thanks!

Okayokayokay. For as long as a meaningful exception is raised when the backend is not one that the code handle, it's fine by me. Especially since in this case the 'right backend' is GLPK. It's more awkward when the only backend that supports a feature is one that Sage does not ship by default.

<a id='comment:14'></a>Hello,

There are some possible improvements in the documentation:
- some of the lines are too long. Try to make them the same width as they are in the rest of the file.
- If you mention a class you can make a clickable reference to it by using :class:`name_of_the_class`
- You wrote ```"std"``` (as a string) and ```standard``` (as a variable). I guess both of them should be strings.
- you should add a line break after `TESTS::`

For all of these, look at the [reference manual](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#documentation-strings).
