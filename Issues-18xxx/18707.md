Currently, a diagram algebra element can only display its LaTeX code if the element is a basis element. This is a minor fix that I have already implemented for myself, so this code should be added to the Sage source.

Wow. I did not know about that feature of `CombinatorialFreeModule.` Thank you for suggestion. Does that look better?
