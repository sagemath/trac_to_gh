A lot of work has been done on the patchbot since the latest update in #16872.

In particular, the ascii plugin now looks for unicode only in .py[x] missing utf8 declaration, and the patchbot does not look at spkg tickets more than once per day.

There is also an improvement in the system of trust check for code authors.

I have simplified the spkg-install as suggested.

This package works, and has been tested, see its report on top of http://patchbot.sagemath.org/ticket/18594/

Yes, under the condition that the patchbot can be easily installed from the sources (which is the case currently, just copy/symlink the whole directory).

If (for whatever reason) the installation procedure needs to become more complicated, that complexity should go to an install script inside the sources, not to `spkg-install`. It should not become a *requirement* to use Sage's `spkg-install` to install the patchbot.

Ok, here is a version without need for pytz. It still needs dateutil, but it would be hard
to do without anything to handle timezones..

This is not working in python3, because of encoding problems. Still I think it would be good to have a recent patchbot in the new style spkg.

This patchbot has not yet been run on a ticket.

* Ok, I will remove the dependency on six.

It is not clear to me if I should write there shell commands, python packages, or both.

* Concerning the safe-only mode, this is certainly not perfect. I guess its main aim is to avoid the horribly long recompilation that can take place sometimes when some low-level things are changed.

Replying to [@fchapoton](#comment%3A31):

True, the documentation is lacking. For the patchbot, I think there are no dependencies, so something like

```
# No dependencies
```
should be fine.

> * Concerning the safe-only mode, this is certainly not perfect. I guess its main aim is to avoid the horribly long recompilation that can take place sometimes when some low-level things are changed.

If that is the reason, the name `safe_only` looks badly chosen: it seems to imply that testing other tickets is "unsafe" somehow.

> Patchbot users are always free to change the default setting. It is up to them to decide whether or not they test all the tickets, including some that may take a **lot** of time.

Personally, I would prefer to have `safe_only=False` by default. I think that most patchbots are running all the time, so I don't see the problem.

In fact, there is a **big** difference between datetime.utcnow() and datetime.now(tzutc())

* `datetime.utcnow()` does not have any information about its timezone
* `datetime.now(tzutc())` is an object that knows that it is in UTC timezone

Because I want to take differences between times, the clean way is to make pretty sure
that all datetimes are aware of their own timezones.

Given the nature of the patchbot, which is to receive and compare data from all over the world, I think there is no point in trying to get rid of the dateutil package.

I am grateful that you look at the patchbot code. Nevertheless, during this time, sage4 using patchbot 2.3.3 is just spending its time looptesting #258, once every two minutes. Maybe you should rather stop it.

The patchbot has several issues, the main one in my opinion being the recognition of trusted users, that is currently not good at all. I hope that it will not be necessary to solve all the issues in order to have a new style spkg.

Replying to [@fchapoton](#comment%3A41):
> Is there any fundamental reason why we should avoid any dependency ?

Yes: `patchbot` would be the only Sage package which has dependencies beyond Sage. Installing packages system-wide is a big requirement.

> Installing packages system-wide is a big requirement.

For those who install the patchbot? Come on, who installs that except developpers? If they get a message saying that "X must be installed" they will install it, and that's it.

To install mine I had to fight for days, create an user account only for the patchbot, fight with ccache... Having a system dependency like that really isn't a problem (if an explicit error message appears).

Jeroen, do you object if this is made a new-style spkg in its current state ?

Version 2.4.2 works well, it is now running quite smoothly on arando since a long time.

I would really like the patchbot to survive the "disparition" of old-style spkgs..

Here is major new version 2.4.3

I have enhanced the trust control, hereby reducing the number of tickets that were not tested for wrong reasons. But this will work better if all people that run patchbots agree to update their patchbots.

Therefore this ticket needs review, more than ever.

By the way, what will happen if I do

```
sage -i patchbot-2.4.9
```
with a future instance of the new-style spkg ?
In other words, can one install new-style spkg updates in that way ?

In the `history.txt` file I got some strange missing things

```
[2015-09-15 15:25:11 +0000] #19001: starting tests
[2015-09-15 16:00:53 +0000] #19001: TestsPassed
[2015-09-15 16:01:10 +0000] #19043: starting tests

[2015-09-15 16:02:21 +0000] #19068: starting tests
```
Indeed #19043 is unsafe and was skipped. But this does not appear in the history.

For #19048 I think that something gets wrong because in `patchbot.log` I got

```
[2015-09-15 16:02:09 +0000] An exception has been raised during the test of #19048
```
Which is not very precise. Looking at 19048-log.txt it appears that

```
[calculus ] reading sources... [  5%] sage/calculus/calculus

```
So the report status should be that the documentation does not build... the error was catched but somehow misinterpreted.

Vincent

I still find it hard to believe that something as trivial as a patchbot needs to deal with timezones (and, if you look at the code, it doesn't actually deal with different timezones). You could just assume all times to be in UTC, problem solved.

Ok, here is a new version, again (I am starting to get tired to work on a patchbot that nobody uses).

It does no longer depends on dateutil.

It has a better log in history.txt for skipped tickets.

The doc plugin has been reactivated, and the initial "make" replaced by "make build".
So the doc is only build once, and doc failure is reported as a plugin failure.

I have tested it, it seems to work. Please double-check.

Hmm, there is a problem:

A) either we do not build the doc before running the tests, and the tests fail when a new sage-release appears
(this is what happens with 2.4.7, I think, see your reports on ticket 0)

B) or we do build the doc before, but then there is no plugin reporting about doc failure
(this would revert to the previous behaviour)

C) or we can build the doc twice..

D) or find a better solution (do make when a new develop is pulled ?)

I would vote for B) or D)

Hello,
I am not quite sure, but looking at the latest report of arando and librae on 6.9.b7 here:

http://patchbot.sagemath.org/log/Pending/0/Ubuntu/14.04/i686/3.13.0-40-generic/arando/2015-09-17%2013:28:51?short

(librae report is no longer there)

one finds that one of them fails because the doc was not build before the tests were run, and the other for some strange reason.

In the current state, the plugin ￼"plugins.docbuild" is indeed mandatory, otherwise the doc is not build and therefore the tests do not pass.

Some time ago, the doc was build once with a "make" and then again in the optional "docbuild" plugin. Now it is only build once in the plugin.

I can enforce in the code that the plugin "docbuild" is always activated.

OR I can step back and build the doc during the initial "make" call. But then doc failure will be again reported as Build failure, and the "docbuild" plugin will again become useless.

Opinions are required, please.

I find it very annoying that some tests do not pass if the doc is not build.

Thanks a lot for reporting.

With bot 2.5.2, there is no more any dependency about timezone and the like..

Is your home server also running 2.5.2 ? What is the name of the machine where you see problems ?
