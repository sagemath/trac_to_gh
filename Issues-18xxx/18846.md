This ticket summarizes the work done in the [ACTIS project](https://bitbucket.org/lucasdavid/sage_coding_project/wiki/Home).

The main goal of this project is to enhance the decoding part of Sage, doing the following:
- propose a new API to manage code families
- propose a new API to manage multiple encoders for a given code family (i.e multiple message spaces)
- propose a new API to manage multiple decoding algorithms for a given code family
- implement numerous code families, alongside their encoders and decoders

The following tables gives a quick access to all tickets related to the project:

- The first table contains references to every ticket adding major features, like new code families, decoders...
- The second table contains references to every small ticket: bug fixes, minor quality of life upgrades, etc
- The last table contains references to every ticket which has been positive reviewed and/or closed.


The `Nature` column gives the "type" of the ticket :
- `Structure` means it's a structural ticket, which does not require any knowledge in coding theory. It will be for tickets which introduce new mechanisms in the API.
- `Cleanup` means it's a ticket that refreshes old existing code of the coding library, and/or documentation. It does not require any knowledge in coding theory.
- `Content` means it adds new mathematical content (code families, decoding algorithms, ...) to Sage. Some knowledge on the topic might be useful for these tickets. 
- `Documentation` means it's a ticket which adds some new documentation in the library. It does not require any particular knowledge in coding library, nor being familiar with our code.
- `Enhancement` means it's a ticket which makes some existing code better, either in matter of speed or design.
