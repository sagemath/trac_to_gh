The other will need more work:

```
sage: M = CuspForms(Gamma1(13),2)
sage: f = M.newforms('a')[0]
sage: G = DirichletGroup(3)
sage: chi = G.0
sage: f.twist(chi)
```
returns

TypeError: no common canonical parent for objects with parents: 'Number Field in a0 with defining polynomial x^2 + 3*x + 3' and 'Cyclotomic Field of order 2 and degree 1'

It appears when the form has coefficients outside ZZ.


By the way, this could be another nice example.

This is because the field of values of `chi` and the field of coefficients of `f` are not compatible (this may be a bad example; `chi.base_ring()` is `CyclotomicField(2)`, which is actually `QQ` but not recognised as such).  In such cases, one could try to take a compositum, but I think it is better to leave it to the user to specify the correct field.

I added youe example, but with `chi` having coefficients in `QQ`.  Unfortunately, this uncovered a new bug; see #18436.

This is actually the first doctest in a different guise.  I added another one to check that twisting by the trivial character (with values in `QQ`) does not change the form.

This is in fact caused by a bug in `DirichletCharacter.minimize_base_ring()`: in the above setting, typing

```
sage: eps.minimize_base_ring()
```
gives the same error.  This method is called via the `ModularForms` constructor, so e.g. `ModularForms(eps, 2)` also fails.

I got a merge conflict with #18436. But relax, probably Peter is better than all of us and can fix all of it in no time. 

a small doc string thingy:

Check a bug spotted at #18086 is fixed::

should use :trac:`18086` instead.

<a id='comment:32'></a>OK, so it turns out that:
- the reason I couldn't get the develop branch to compile was that I was using "sage -b" to recompile after switching between branches, which is not robust when there are changes to packages; it seems to be safer to use "make";
- two of the three changes in the patch I uploaded earlier had already been fixed by other patches of Peter's, which was the cause of the conflict.

I've now uploaded a patch with the one extra change that Peter hadn't already fixed -- `minimize_base_ring` returns an error when the base is a relative number field, which is relevant if you create a newform in a space with a specified character, so the Hecke eigenvalue field is a relative field with the coefficient field of the character as its base. Now I think we're now good to go.
