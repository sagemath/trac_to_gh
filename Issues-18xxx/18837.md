These days, Cython knows that included files are a dependency. So in most cases, the

```
depends = [...]
```
lines in `module_list.py` are not needed.

This ticket removes `flint_depends`, `singular_depends` and `givaro_depends` with one exception: the dependency of `sage.libs.linbox.linbox` on Givaro is not automatically detected (I don't know whether it's a real dependency, but I'm keeping the explicit dependency to be safe).

To check that Cython really knows the dependencies, you can check the metadata on top of each generated `.c`/`.cpp` file. You will see that (with the one exception mentioned before), Cython knows the dependencies.

Note that in some cases, `flint/flint.h` was a dependency before but not after this ticket. In all those cases, other FLINT files like `flint/ulong_extras.h` are still a dependency, so this is not a problem.
