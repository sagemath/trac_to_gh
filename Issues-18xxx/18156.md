Even if you hack in the missing(?) `__debug` header, the gcc bootstrap in Sage will fail.

There is a workaround at https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/pull/38596

It works for me, too. With only the 6.3.1 command line tools installed (not the gui Xcode app), gcc fails without the workaround, builds with it. `R` fails (#18254), so if I also fake the installation of `R` and `rpy2` by touching the appropriate files in `local/var/lib/sage/installed`, the rest of Sage builds and passes most tests. The only failures are related to the absence of `R` and `rpy2`.

For the record, I used this change:

should we check for the version of Xcode, too?

```
xcodebuild -version | grep XCode
```
will output something like

```
XCode a.b.c
```
So this is just a bit of shell scripting. If you like I can do this.

well, this sounds like adding a check to gcc configure script; while doable, it does not seem like worth the effort to me.

We could do the same but with `gcc`:

```
$ `xcode-select -p`/usr/bin/gcc --version 2> /dev/null | grep 'Apple LLVM version'
Apple LLVM version 6.0 (clang-600.0.57) (based on LLVM 3.5svn)
```
With Xcode 6.2, we get "Apple LLVM version 6.0", and with Xcode 6.3.1, we get 6.1.0.

Do you mean always using `GCC_CONFIGURE="--with-build-config=bootstrap-debug $GCC_CONFIGURE"` on OS X?

indeed, particularly given Apple's non-support of anything older than OSX 10.10, I see the point; it could also happen that they eventually push the same broken llvm version into XCode for older OSX versions...
