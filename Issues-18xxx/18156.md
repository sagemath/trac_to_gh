Even if you hack in the missing(?) `__debug` header, the gcc bootstrap in Sage will fail.

Just tried a clean with sources that I currently have around on my mac (6.6.beta5) and it failed to build gcc too, not during what I would call bootstraping, but I am guessing that's what you are talking about because of the message.

There is a workaround at https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/pull/38596

```
xcodebuild -version | grep XCode
```
will output something like

```
XCode a.b.c
```
So this is just a bit of shell scripting. If you like I can do this.

well, this sounds like adding a check to gcc configure script; while doable, it does not seem like worth the effort to me.

We could do the same but with `gcc`:

```
$ `xcode-select -p`/usr/bin/gcc --version 2> /dev/null | grep 'Apple LLVM version'
Apple LLVM version 6.0 (clang-600.0.57) (based on LLVM 3.5svn)

With Xcode 6.2, we get "Apple LLVM version 6.0", and with Xcode 6.3.1, we get 6.1.0.

indeed, particularly given Apple's non-support of anything older than OSX 10.10, I see the point; it could also happen that they eventually push the same broken llvm version into XCode for older OSX versions...
