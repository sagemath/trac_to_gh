I didn't run into this. Was it because I wasn't doing a debug build?

should we check for the version of Xcode, too?
(this patch is not needed on Xcode <= 6.2)

{{{
xcodebuild -version | grep XCode
}}}
will output something like

```
XCode a.b.c
```
So this is just a bit of shell scripting. If you like I can do this.

```

The command `xcode-select -version` seems to output

```
xcode-select version 2339.

I tried looking for the string "6.3.1" in the command-line tools directory, but couldn't find anything, nor did I find any obviously useful differences between the directories for 6.2 and 6.3.1 (not that I really know what I'm looking for).

Apple LLVM version 6.0 (clang-600.0.57) (based on LLVM 3.5svn)
```
With Xcode 6.2, we get "Apple LLVM version 6.0", and with Xcode 6.3.1, we get 6.1.0.

Do you mean always using `GCC_CONFIGURE="--with-build-config=bootstrap-debug $GCC_CONFIGURE"` on OS X?

I actually meant for all OSX, as jhp was asking.

Putting as much configuration outside of if-statements as possible means less edges to the state space; it makes it more likely that everyone can reproduce the same set of bugs.

indeed, particularly given Apple's non-support of anything older than OSX 10.10, I see the point; it could also happen that they eventually push the same broken llvm version into XCode for older OSX versions...
