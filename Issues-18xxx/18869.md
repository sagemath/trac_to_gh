There are variations by Schrijver and Szegedy of Lovasz theta which are computable using SDP, just as the one from #18830. 

An implementation calling the standard in Sage SDP solver from `cvxopt` is available as a [gist](https://gist.github.com/dstahlke/6895643) by Dan Stahlke, who kindly gave us permission to include parts of it into Sage under GPL.

for the corresponding definitions.
