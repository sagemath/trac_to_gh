The closest this ticket is from is 6.9beta4.

Create the `FullyPackedLoop` class which does the following:

- Add methods for ascii/graphical representation by modifying corresponding code for six vertex model. 
- Add method `to_alternating_sign_matrix`.
- Add method `link_pattern` to extract link pattern/ non-crossing partition.

I will possibly have more comments as I make a more detailed review. However it's looking quite good.

> What types of data for example?

Something that could be used to construct a six-vertex configuration:

```
SVM = SixVertexModel(2)
SVM([[3,1],[5,3]])
```
So it would make this work:

```
sage: FPL = FullyPackedLoops(2)
sage: FPL([[3,1],[5,3]])
```

<a id='comment:48'></a>The coverage failure, I'm no so sure (FYI you can click on the patchbot info to see details). However the import modules failure is reflecting the fact that you are not lazily importing this new file (which is there in an effort to try and keep startup time down). So I would add this line instead of the straight import:

```
lazy_import('sage.combinat.fully_packed_loop', ['FullyPackedLoop', 'FullyPackedLoops'])
```

A couple of things about the ticket/code itself:

- `matrix and also extract the link pattern.::` either remove the period or put a space after it.
- You should not put examples/information for the user in the `__init__`, instead move it to the class level docstring (for `FullyPackedLoop`). The `__init__` still needs to have a doctest, and a good one is to typically create an element `X` and then do `TestSuite(X).run()`, but you already have this, so leave the `TESTS::` block.
- In `to_alternating_sign_matrix`, remove the blank line at the beginning of the docstring and start with `Return`.
- You don't need `:math:`x = y``, just ``x = y`` with the backticks is sufficient. If you want it similar to equation mode in latex, do

```
.. MATH::

    x = y
```
- The `EXAMPLES::` block in `plot` is indented one to many times.
- For notes, you might want to consider using the `.. NOTE::` block (in `link_pattern`).
- Period missing in `six_vertex_model` one-line sentence.
- I would make `_vertex_dictionary` a lazy attribute (grep for ``@`lazy_attribute`). FYI - This means it's created on-demand and acts like a regular attribute, so `self._vertex_dictionary[i]` works. Essentially it is cached, so the downside to this is that the dictionary gets kept alive as long as that FPL is, but I think each instance is not kept alive too long. It's up to you.
- Same for `_end_point_dictionary`. In a similar vein, I would remove the (public) attribute `end_points` and just use `_end_point_dictionary`.
- First line of `FullyPackedLoops` needs a period and an empty line of space.
- `cardinality` is missing a period at the end of the equation.
- Remove the commented out code in `_element_constructor_`.
- You need to provide a description of `link_pattern`.
- You should describe the bijection with ASMs somewhere, most likely in the `FullyPackedLoops` (resp. `FullyPackedLoop`) class and add `.. SEEALSO::` to that class in `FullyPackedLoop` (resp. `FullyPackedLoops`) and `to_fully_packed_loop`.

- I think the variable name of `current` in `_get_coordinates` is confusing and you should rename it to something more descriptive.

Looking very good overall, as almost all of these are trivial to minor tweaks. That's all for now.
