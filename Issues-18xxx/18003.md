The closest this ticket is from is 6.9beta4.

Create the `FullyPackedLoop` class which does the following:

- Add methods for ascii/graphical representation by modifying corresponding code for six vertex model. 
- Add method `to_alternating_sign_matrix`.
- Add method `link_pattern` to extract link pattern/ non-crossing partition.

yeah it's not currently working quite right, i'll keep working on it over the flight though and hopefully figure out what's going wrong.
G+ is probably the best way to contact me so add me on there :)

I believe this is ready to be reviewed by Travis?

I added the equality functionality. I wanted to do a test like isinstance(other,FullyPackedLoop), but I did not because of this behavior which I don't understand:

sage: A=AlternatingSignMatrices(3)
sage: M=A.random_element()
sage: f=FullyPackedLoop(M)
sage: type(f)
<class 'sage.combinat.fully_packed_loop.FullyPackedLoop'>
sage: isinstance(f,FullyPackedLoop)
False

{
    "body": "<a id='comment:16'>Comment 16:</a>\nOkay, some comments after a quick look-over:\n\n- I think you should implement a `toggle` map which swaps 2 vertical lines and 2 horizontal lines.\n- You should make a parent class for all fully packed loops (on an `n x n` (m?) grid). The iterator could be a `TransitiveIdeal` generated by the toggles (or some other type of search using toggles), but perhaps there is a better way to do this. Also `FullyPackedLoop` then should be a subclass of `Element`.\n- The `.. math::` should be `.. MATH::`.\n- You need more docuemntation for the class `FullyPackedLoop`, and the first line should be something like `A fully packed loop.` (a sentence which does not say \"class\", \"implement\", or other similar things).

<a id='comment:16'>Comment 16:</a>
Okay, some comments after a quick look-over:

- I think you should implement a `toggle` map which swaps 2 vertical lines and 2 horizontal lines.
- You should make a parent class for all fully packed loops (on an `n x n` (m?) grid). The iterator could be a `TransitiveIdeal` generated by the toggles (or some other type of search using toggles), but perhaps there is a better way to do this. Also `FullyPackedLoop` then should be a subclass of `Element`.
- The `.. math::` should be `.. MATH::`.
- You need more docuemntation for the class `FullyPackedLoop`, and the first line should be something like `A fully packed loop.` (a sentence which does not say "class", "implement", or other similar things). Also, it would be good to have some more references.
- Perhaps the vertices could be `+` instead of `#`, or we set that as a `global_option` (this is something I could do if you want)?
- Remove the commented out lines.
- The `fpl.plot().description()` output could potentially be machine dependent, so it would be better to test the number of such elements.

I will possibly have more comments as I make a more detailed review. However it's looking quite good.

This is more a note for myself to look at in more detail, but I think contains some interesting followup ideas: http://www.lpthe.jussieu.fr/~pzinn/semi/steklov.pdf.

Replying to [@egunawan](#comment%3A37):
> How come AlternatingSignMatrices._element_constructor_ checks if asm.parent() is self? Is that also redundant?

It is also redundant (I might have suggested it, or at least thought it was necessary, before Nicolas told me about the fact the coercion framework handles that case before `_element_constructor_` even sees it).

Something that could be used to construct a six-vertex configuration:

```
SVM = SixVertexModel(2)
SVM([[3,1],[5,3]])
```
So it would make this work:

```
sage: FPL = FullyPackedLoops(2)
sage: FPL([[3,1],[5,3]])
```

The coverage failure, I'm no so sure (FYI you can click on the patchbot info to see details). However the import modules failure is reflecting the fact that you are not lazily importing this new file (which is there in an effort to try and keep startup time down). So I would add this line instead of the straight import:

```
lazy_import('sage.combinat.fully_packed_loop', ['FullyPackedLoop', 'FullyPackedLoops'])
```

A couple of things about the ticket/code itself:

- `matrix and also extract the link pattern.::` either remove the period or put a space after it.
- You should not put examples/information for the user in the `__init__`, instead move it to the class level docstring (for `FullyPackedLoop`). The `__init__` still needs to have a doctest, and a good one is to typically create an element `X` and then do `TestSuite(X).run()`, but you already have this, so leave the `TESTS::` block.
- In `to_alternating_sign_matrix`, remove the blank line at the beginning of the docstring and start with `Return`.
- You don't need <code>:math:\`x = y\`</code>, just <code>\`x = y\`</code> with the backticks is sufficient. If you want it similar to equation mode in latex, do

```
.. MATH::

    x = y
```
- The `EXAMPLES::` block in `plot` is indented one to many times.
- For notes, you might want to consider using the `.. NOTE::` block (in `link_pattern`).
- Period missing in `six_vertex_model` one-line sentence.
- I would make `_vertex_dictionary` a lazy attribute (grep for `@lazy_attribute`). FYI - This means it's created on-demand and acts like a regular attribute, so `self._vertex_dictionary[i]` works. Essentially it is cached, so the downside to this is that the dictionary gets kept alive as long as that FPL is, but I think each instance is not kept alive too long. It's up to you.
- Same for `_end_point_dictionary`. In a similar vein, I would remove the (public) attribute `end_points` and just use `_end_point_dictionary`.
- First line of `FullyPackedLoops` needs a period and an empty line of space.
- `cardinality` is missing a period at the end of the equation.
- Remove the commented out code in `_element_constructor_`.
- You need to provide a description of `link_pattern`.
- You should describe the bijection with ASMs somewhere, most likely in the `FullyPackedLoops` (resp. `FullyPackedLoop`) class and add `.. SEEALSO::` to that class in `FullyPackedLoop` (resp. `FullyPackedLoops`) and `to_fully_packed_loop`.
- The documentation at the top of the file is good, but you can't read it interactively (only on the online/compiled documentation). I would suggest moving it to either `FullyPackedLoops` or `FullyPackedLoop`, depending on which you think is the more common entry point.
- I think the variable name of `current` in `_get_coordinates` is confusing and you should rename it to something more descriptive.

Looking very good overall, as almost all of these are trivial to minor tweaks. That's all for now.

(I am working on a creating a new combinatorial object now and deciding which data type to use.) Thank you!
