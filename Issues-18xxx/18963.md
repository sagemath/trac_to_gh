In #16133, the flag `sage.combinat.finite_state_machine.FSMOldProcessOutput` was removed.
However, there are still 5 doctests in `finite_state_machine_generators.py` setting this flag.

I think that these last two occurrences should be kept: after all, they are doctests in a paper on arXiv and we should keep it as close as possible to that paper as long as doctests do pass (and they do pass).

Thus I reset the ticket to the previous branch.
