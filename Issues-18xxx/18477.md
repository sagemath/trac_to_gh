Well. In terms of 'clean code', what would you think of a way to decorate functions which use a remote? The decorator would check that the remotes exist, and if they do not create them before running the function? Or do you think that it's 'oversolving' the problem?

I think that's a good solution. Just make sure that the "ensure that the `trac` remote exists" function is cached, in case a scripts needs to call those functions many times.

But really, this is Volker's code, so it's better to ask him.
