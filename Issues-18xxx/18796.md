These first 5 commits follow up the tickets (again using `2to3`:
#15982 Change the syntax of the except clause   `2to3 -w -f except src/sage`
#16067 Semantic of filter() function changed   `2to3 -w -f filter src/sage`
#15983 Sames of some function attributes   `2to3 -w -f funcattrs src/sage`
#15784 Use `in` instead of `has_key()`   `2to3 -w -f has_key src/sage`
#15984 Use more modern Python idioms   `2to3 -w -f idioms src/sage`

I had to backout the proposed change for `src/sage/game_theory/normal_form_game.py` (see also the 4 reverted modules mentioned in #15984).

The next 5 commits follow up these tickets
#15986 - Change names of some method attributes   `2to3 -w -f methodattrs src/sage`
#15743 - <> is not Python 3 compatible   `2to3 -w -f ne src/sage`
#15990 - Change syntax of raise statement  `2to3 -w -f raise src/sage`
#16078 - reduce() is no more a builtin function  `2to3 -w -f reduce src/sage`
#15993 - Remove implicit tuple parameter unpacking  `2to3 -w -f tuple_params src/sage`

Three proposed module changes by `raise` involve raise `with_traceback()`:
`src/sage/interfaces/expect.py`
`src/sage/interfaces/singular.py`
`src/sage/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_number_field.py`
This requires the use of a compatibility library and therefor belongs to stage 2 (see meta-ticket #16052). This 3 modules will be handled in a separate ticket #18799.

```
isinstance(self, type(other))

The change was generated by `2to3 -w -f idioms src/sage`. I did not change any formatting here as in some previous Python3 ticket I was asked by the reviewer to undo those improvements as they were not strictly required by the task at hand. I complied :-/

I agree that the mentioned code is not pretty and not quite PEP8 compliant.
But before fixing it I'd like to discuss[comment:6](#comment%3A6).

The Python documentation (https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/functions.html?highlight=type#type) says: //The isinstance() built-in function is recommended for testing the type of an object.//\n\nThere was one generated change (see[comment:1](#comment%3A1)) that I reverted because of failing doctests. Failing of doctests was the only method I used to determine that the change was not correct. I have no deep understanding of the code.\n\nTherefor one can reason that without more insight all changes from `type()` to `isinstance()` should be reverted.\nOr to keep them until proved guilty.\n\nRemark: In ticket #15984 we made a large number of such changes supported by the same reasoning. This was in Sage 6.2 15 month ago. So there is some evidence that the approach is reasonable.",

Replying to [jdemeyer](#comment%3A6):
> Why do you replace
> ...

All the changes were generated by `2to3 -w -f idioms src/sage`.

While `type(self) == type(other)` means strict type identity the expression `isinstance(self, type(other))` allows subclasses. The Python documentation (https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/functions.html?highlight=type#type) says: //The isinstance() built-in function is recommended for testing the type of an object.//

There was one generated change (see[comment:1](#comment%3A1)) that I reverted because of failing doctests. Failing of doctests was the only method I used to determine that the change was not correct. I have no deep understanding of the code.

Therefor one can reason that without more insight all changes from `type()` to `isinstance()` should be reverted.
Or to keep them until proved guilty.

Remark: In ticket #15984 we made a large number of such changes supported by the same reasoning. This was in Sage 6.2 15 month ago. So there is some evidence that the approach is reasonable.

You should really never make changes that you don't understand.

Indeed.

This commit undoes the changes from `type()` to `isinstance()` in the 6 affected modules. 

I recommend not to employ `2to3 -w -f idioms src/sage` anymore since those changes not essential to Py3 compatibility and not always correct. But they improve the code if used with sufficient care.
