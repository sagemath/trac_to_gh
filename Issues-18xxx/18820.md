Dear Nathaan,

> Why did you remove the `spkg-src` file?

You advised (see #16711 about upgrade to 3.1.1) adding this file to document the renaming of the tarball (from R-x-y-z.tar.gz to r-x-y-z.tar.gz), needed by the then-current convention of all-lowercase tarball names.

Since this convention has been obsoleted (see #18229 for the previous upgrade to 3.2.0), this renaming is no longer necessary and one can use the original tarball. There is nothing to document. Since, according to [the developer's guide](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/packaging.html), this file is optional, it becomes superfluous. QED.

Do you advise keeping a no-op `spkg-src` ?

Hellooooooo,

> You advised (see #16711 about upgrade to 3.1.1) adding this file to document the renaming of the tarball (from R-x-y-z.tar.gz to r-x-y-z.tar.gz), needed by the then-current convention of all-lowercase tarball names.

A `spkg-src` file to document a renaming? Why? `O_o`

> Do you advise keeping a no-op `spkg-src` ?

No. I advise to keep a file that re-builds the archive from network ressources only. Then it becomes easier to check that the archive's content is what it should be. I do not see anything wrong with a script that downloads a distant file (whose url is generated from the locally stored version number), and does nothing else to it if there is nothing else to do.

Actually, I will try to solve this once and for all. I'll write some 'sage --sanity-check-package whatever' that uses whatever's spkg-src script (if any), and checks whether the content of the file in `upstream/` matches it.

This way, checking that the archive is legit will only be a call to 'sanity-check'. In this setting, your spkg-src, even though it just downloads something, will be useful.

Please don't do that (unless you have a solid reason to do so) : some firewall setup do exceedingly annoying thing to network downloads. The recent "enhancement" to downloads that tries to select the closest/fastest mirror left me with an unupdateable tree (and, yes, this machines lives behind a "corporate-style" fascist firewall, run by incompetents...).

Again, ponder what you're planning. Im currently in a hell paved of yur good intentins.

Whatever you decide to do, could you please open a SEPARATE ticket, instead of hijacking this innocent R upgrade YET AGAIN (that would be the fourth time...) ? Thanks in advance !

Whoa ! I didn't say **YOU** hijacked them. Apologies for loose redaction. 

I said that R upgrades (which should be very plain vanilla affairs) seem to attract delays from unrelated issues. From memory (not real time to dig them out)

- Upgrade to 3.2.0 was hijacked by the lowercase-tarball-convention reversing

- A couple of versions before, hijacking for cygnus-building issues

- [ I don't have the exact third issue on hand nor on memory, but I know that the Cignus-related one wasn't the first. I'll have to look with a bit more time ]

So your use of a previously unused spkg-src file would have been the fourth time...

Okay. I'll post a new commit tonight (can't do that now : I'm at work, and I prepare tickets on a home machine).

I intend to discuss your proposal seriously : it entails creating a spkg-src file for **all** packages, thus making it mandatory. And making mandatory the use of a functional Internet connection for any installation/update. No more updates for an isolated/firewalled machine...

And since we pay this price, it should be logical to limit Sage tarballs to a very bare minimum of sage-specific files and patches.

I'm not sure that's where we should go... But this is the subject of your proposal-to-be, that will be discussed on its ticket.

Hello again,

In its new version, your branch removes *one* line from the spkg-src. It is not that I care much about this line, but rather that the next one has absolutely no meaning: you removed the instruction that moves the archive to upstream/, but left the one which updates the pacakges' checksums using the information from upstream/.

Could you sort this out (in the way that you prefer)? You can then set this ticket to `positive_review`.

THaaaaaaaaaanks,

Nathann

What exactly are you trying to achieve, Jeroen ? Let this ticket go, he just wants to upgrade his package and his ticket does the job. His branch does not even touch the spkg-src file. Since when can a reviewer block a ticket like that?

Sorry, Nathaan, sorry, Jeroen. I'm still running *Homo Sapiens Sapiens* version 1.0 : no telepathic interface. I do **not** understand nor guess what you two ghouls want.

Please feel free to do it yourself (if you can manage to agree on something...). I might review it.

My message was not clear: I was answering to your commit message. The commit is fine. Your commit message is "Restored ORIGINAL non-functional spkg-src as par Nathaann Cohen's request", which seemed a bit more abrupt than my previous "in the way that you prefer".

The branch is fine, I thank you for doing this last modifications, and I am sorry that we don't seem able in this community to sort this all out while preserving a light mood.

Your branch is okay, and does the job. We will probably rewrite the spkg-src script later anyway, if #18826 ends up being merged.
