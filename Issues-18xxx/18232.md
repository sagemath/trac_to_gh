LattE integrale has many features that should be exposed in Sage:

- Ehrhart polynomials - #18211
- counting integer points in rational polytopes - #18812
- computing Ehrhart series of rational polytopes 
- computing multivariate generating functions of integer points in polyhedra - #22497, #22109
- integration (of polynomials over polytopes) - #22522, #20887, 
- volume computation (for polytopes) - #22528

(See manual at https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~latte/software/packages/latte_current/manual_v1.7.2.pdf)

(The manual reveals that LattE has some other features that, however, require Maple as a subroutine; I omitted them in the list above.)

All of these features are available from the command-line, so this is independent of #18190 (library bindings to LattE). The command-line interfacing is the object of #22497 and #22522.
