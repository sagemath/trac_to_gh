region_plot can't deal with equations. For example the condition `x == 0` is treated as `x < 0`.

```
sage: x, y = var('x, y')
sage: region_plot([x == 0], (x, -1, 1), (y, -1, 1))
sage: region_plot([x^2+y^2==1, x<y], (x, -1, 1), (y, -1, 1))
```

@yzh: I finally had the time to look into it. The patch looks all good to me except for the warn part. Can you change that to the following

```
from warnings import warn
warn("There are at least 2 equations;......")
```
This will give the warning just once to the user *per sage session*, instead of each time a similar command is run. After that it is up to the user to take note of this warning.
