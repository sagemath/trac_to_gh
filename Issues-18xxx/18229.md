It's that time of the year again (and I'm late...).

Renamed source tarball available from:

    http://www.labri.fr/perso/vdelecro/r-3.2.0.tar.gz

We add a new patch to fix a bug in the `R_PCRE` autoconf macro which leads to `configure` losing `-lz` and `-lbz2` from `LIBS` under certain circumstances, when using Sage's versions of these libraries (as opposed to letting R build its own, which we don't want).  ([Upstream report](https://bugs.r-project.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=16364))

Depends on #18254
Depends on #15642

François : the build system may support names with a capital, but sage-fix-pkg-checksums do not. I won't fix that in this ticket. Should I (should you ?) open a new ticket ?

This is far from obvious after reading the docs. I understand that the ipython is work in progress, so this is not (yet) a big problem. But it should eventually be documented in a more obvious way. I am beginnig to think that some kind of guide to ipython notebook for (repentant ?) Sage notebook users would be useful. Maybe ditto for Cloud users (Sagemath cloud is really a different beast ...).\n\nNote that you have to %load_ext rmagic, nor rpy2.ipython (error message : ImportError: No module named ipython\").

Important rectifications :

kcrisman : I was able to get R graphics in the ipython notebook ... but I had to %load_ext rmagic before, and work in a %%R cell. This is far from obvious after reading the docs. I understand that the ipython is work in progress, so this is not (yet) a big problem. But it should eventually be documented in a more obvious way. I am beginnig to think that some kind of guide to ipython notebook for (repentant ?) Sage notebook users would be useful. Maybe ditto for Cloud users (Sagemath cloud is really a different beast ...).

Note that you have to %load_ext rmagic, nor rpy2.ipython (error message : ImportError: No module named ipython"). Does this deserve a ticket ?

Status : still "needs_review", IMHO.

It's known as a "graphic device" in R docs.

To be clear,

```
r("plot(rnorm(1000),rnorm(1000))")
```
does nothing (on command line and in ipynb). Returns NULL

```
r("X11();plot(rnorm(1000),rnorm(1000))")
```
opens an X11 window (the R graphic device) and displays the cloud in this window (again on command line and in ipynb). Returns NULL, nothing displayed **in the notebook**.

Interestingly, neither `r.plot(r.rnorm(1000),r.rnorm(1000))` nor `r.X11();r.plot(r.rnorm(1000),r.rnorm(1000))` do anything on the command line (prints NULL, then the named vector (c("null device"=1). or in the notebook (ditto except that NULL is not printed).

I don't remember having ever used R from sage on the command line (my favorite interface was emacs  and ess, for obvious reasons, but The Sage notebook was sometimes handy, and ipynb appears more and more attractive, since %%R seems to work).

Currently, it seems to be, at least in ipynb. In the Sage notebook, the only way I found  to get graphs reliably in the notebook itself was to open a device, plot on it (several graphs are possible) and close the device in the same %r cell. The same is possible in an rpy2 %%R cell vhithout to have to open/close the device.

I just did that **exactly**, with the same result : **nothing** is printed by the script, and the checksums.ini file is **not** recreated.

Yet another Appleism ? What shell do you use ?

Thinking more about it, I don't think it is strictly an appleism - not of the shell at any rate. I think the underlying file system may be case insensitive and just look case sensitive by hackery (not unlike FAT32 in some ways). In any case someone created checksums for `Pillow` and `Sphinx`...

OK. It seems now that, whereas at least two Sage developers are eager to qibble over the case of tarballs' names, no one has (yet) opened a ticket for this issue, which is **different** from the issue at hand, which is R-3.2.0.

Since it is a different issue, I do not think it is wise to try to fix it incidently. I will **not** touch it in this ticket.

1) Should I open a ticket over the tarball case question ?

2) Could some kind soul review my proposed fix ?

3) Should I open a ticket over the issue of sex of angels in Sage ?

So this means for MacOS X / Xcode (and only that?) we *currently* (a moving target anyway) would have to configure with `--without-system-bzlib`, or fix the linking issue in another way, on this ticket here, right?

Not using Sage's bzlib would be a temporary solution anyway:

  *"Building R using the included versions of zlib, bzip2, xz and PCRE is deprecated: these are frozen (bar essential bug-fixes) and will be removed for R 3.3.0."*

(So Sage will finally include `xz` as well, such that we can use better compression for the upstream tarballs... :P )

(So there, just `-lz` was missing.)

Configuring with `--without-system-bzlib --without-system-zlib`, the build succeeds (still with GCC 5.1.0).

Yes, wrong library and I now understand the root cause of some of my problems on that system courtesy of IBM and nothing to do with `R` upstream. Anyway there is something strange going on with bzlib but I have no problem using the internal copy here. That being said I may uncover another surprise from the same source, it would take me a bit of time to disentangle the bits that causes gcc to prefer static libraries on my system and rebuild it. 

Very strange both zlib and bzlib, does bzlib depend on zlib somehow?

Now that I have removed the interfering library from the system I can compile `R` with an external bzlib library and gcc 5.1.0 and I don't experience any of these troubles. 

Still there are problems linking an external bzlib on OS X and gcc 5.1.0 - on some systems. This is very strange. Does the failed libR.so have an entry for libbz2 at all?

No.

I've so far not found anything suspicious in `configure`; the libs get added to `LIBS` if the "system" versions are used, so the failing magic must be somewhere in the Makefiles (or some R config thingy these use).

In the Makefile (in `src/src/main`) of the last attempt, we have:

```
## use an explicit library: there might be an unsatisfactory -lz around

R_BZLIBS =  ../extra/bzip2/libbz2.a

EXTRA_STATIC_LIBS = \
  $(R_ZLIBS) $(R_BZLIBS) $(R_PCRE) $(R_TRE) $(R_XDR) $(R_XZ) $(R_LIBINTL) $(R_TZONE)
STATIC_LIBS = $(MAIN_LIBS) $(EXTRA_STATIC_LIBS)

EXTRA_LIBS = $(BLAS_LIBS) $(FLIBS) $(R_XTRA_LIBS)  $(READLINE_LIBS) $(LIBS)

R_binary = R.bin
R_bin_OBJECTS = Rmain.o #$(OBJECTS)
#R_bin_LDADD = $(MAIN_OBJS) $(EXTRA_STATIC_LIBS) $(EXTRA_LIBS)

R_bin_LDADD = -lR #-lRblas

libR_la = libR$(DYLIB_EXT)

```
so somehow `LIBS` got messed up (libz dropped) somewhere on the way.

Well, the behaviour presumably depends on the outcome of some other tests in `configure`, such that sometimes the accumulated `LIBS` get clobbered.

Btw., it's not GCC 5.1; same with GCC 4.9 here.

Getting closer...

In the PCRE checks, `LIBS` gets restored from `r_save_LIBS`, but that's (in my case) an obsolete value, because `r_save_LIBS` didn't get set in *that* check (i.e., the conditions for saving and restoring aren't the same).

But I'm a little frightened : this is the **third** time that the port of a new version of R, which is a mindless affair, is hijacked for an unrelated bug (which, by the way, never gets repertoried under a proper heading !). Is filing a *different* bug that hard ?

Before I fix the "typo", could someone translate (i.e., rephrase) the following such that it makes sense?

```
    # Indeed Sage modifies DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH whereas R build process
    # modifies DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH, so that it is Sage's R and not the freshly
    # built one which will get loaded during the build process and if they are
    # different versions then the build process might fail.
```

Maybe I'm blind or just dumb, but I twice read `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` -- the second occurrence should probably read `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, otherwise *"whereas"* doesn't make sense to me.

Doesn't that means that R and Sage do **different**, possibly incompatible, changes to DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH ?

Possibly `{DY}LD_LIBRARY_PATH` plain `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` is linux but `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` is OS X's version.

sage does load the appropriate one so its libraries are found first but of course during the building process `R` does its own overloading to find the stuff from the just built `R` when building the standard `R` packages. In principle this should be done by augmentation but I have seen libtool doing broken things before (in octave it inserts `/usr/lib64` which completely defeat the purpose of the variable).

I'm guessing that this comes from [#14706 comment:101](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/14706#comment:101), in which case, the second version should say `DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH`.

My suggestion should only have an effect on OS X: it's in a block starting

```
if [ "$UNAME" = "Darwin" ]; then
```
And it is just a mistake in the shell script, yielding a (non-fatal) error

```
./spkg-install: line 164: RINSTALL_MOVED: command not found
```
every time you try to install R on an OS X machine.

Did you read the upstream report?

Same as what?

Nope.  The same happens outside of Sage.

Bug in Sage's infrastructure?  I don't get the point.

Well, technically that doesn't really make sense, since I cannot fix something that hasn't yet been included.  (#18254 is *slightly* different as it modifies an existing file, namely `spkg-install`.)  My changes are based on your branch.

I would agree if we could make this ticket depend on upstream, but then it wouldn't be possible to (positively) review it before upstream decided on a solution.




> That way, each different problem would have been identified in the tickets database. As should have been done when a previous version of R opened a Cygwin-related saga...

We at least have different commits with IMHO meaningful commit messages... (which unfortunately often isn't the case).

You probably know my opinion on (not) bumping patch levels and discarding the package changelog we used to have for years.

Sometimes it is better to also fix "unrelated" minor issues (such as the typo) on a ticket dealing with a package (nowadays probably less than it was with "legacy" spkgs), since otherwise they'll simply never get fixed, either because nobody opens individual tickets for them, or  the tickets just rotten.

The prerequisite for inclusion of a new (or upgraded) package is that it builds/works on all supported platforms, so fixing build issues (and probably fixing doctests, cf. the PARI upgrade at #18340, which was motivated by an initially seemingly unrelated problem with GNU make) belongs to the ticket that introduces (or upgrades) a package.

There are other issues where it perfectly makes sense to open (a metaticket and) separate (sub-)tickets, e.g. to let Sage build with GCC 5.x (four tickets for four different packages which need fixing), or to let Sage build with `clang` (dozens of tickets).

It's a *potential* syntax error, depending on how `R_INSTALL_MOVED` is defined ... ;-)

```sh
$ R_INSTALL_MOVED(){ expr $@; } 
$ R_INSTALL_MOVED = yes
expr: syntax error
```

...and is known to be triggered by a loaded machine. To I'd give it a "positive_review" if

Any takers ? François, any hope in seeing this tested on your Mac ? Volker, any news on the x86 front ?
