Let's use the PARI/GP one.

The magic line reads something like:

```
monsky_washnitzer.matrix_of_frobenius_hyperelliptic(self.hyperelliptic_polynomials()[0], p, prec)[0]
```

The defining polynomial needs to be monicified which is also required by hypellfrob, so it makes sense to refactor the code a little bit.
And it only works for prime fields.

There is also a PARI/GP implem without these restriction (only p != 2 I'd say)

From a quick inspection of the PARI/GP implementation:

The command hyperellpadicfrobenius appears to only work for prime fields. There is an internal command nfhyperellpadicfrobenius which seems to handle nonprime fields, which is called by hyperellcharpoly to get the characteristic polynomial of Frobenius; but it does not appear to be exposed.

Also, the Frobenius matrix commands have a similar restriction on p as in Harvey's code. The charpoly command seems to be doing a naive point count for smaller p.

In any case, it would be worth updating HyperellipticCurve.frobenius_polynomial and related methods to include calls to PARI as appropriate.

To make things clear, I'm looking at PARI git version, though the version in Sage is quite recent and should be similar as far as `hyperell.c` is concerned.

I confirm that `hyperellpadicfrobenius` only works for prime fields whereas the `nf...` one handles extensions.
Though both of them are not marked `static` and use `gerepile` magic to leave a clean stack so I guess they are possible and safe to use from outside the PARI library.

Do you mean those in the PARI library?
I don't see at first glance such restriction.
There is some naive point counting involved in `hyperellcharpoly` but that is when the curve is of (very) low genus and the characteristic is small.
Did I miss something else?

For `p == 2` it indeed seems it only works for `F_2` using naive point counting.

Bill Allombert confirmed this. The `nf...` command is not (currently) available in GP, but we can call it from the library.

Oh, maybe that is just an optimization for cases where naive point counting is actually faster?

The methods of PARI objecgt are in `gen.pxd/pyx`.
You should add a method there calling the C function.
Then in the hyperelliptic curve class, something like

```
pari(H.polynomial()).frobenius()
```
could be called.

Maybe a better option is to add a method directly in Sage's hyperelliptic curve over finite field class.

I'll have some free time in a few hours, I can have a look as well.

Maybe I wasn't clear here. I think there is some mechanism by which most PARI functions appear "automatically" as methods of a PARI object; most of them are not explicitly declared in `src/sage/libs/pari/gen.pyx`. I was wondering why `hyperellpadicfrobenius` (which does not have its own explicitly defined wrapper as far as I can find) shows up this way while `nfhyperellpadicfrobenius` does not. I had thought `paridecl.pxd` was the master source for the autogenerated methods, but it includes both of these functions and yet only one makes it through the rest of the process.

I think there is some mechanism by which most PARI functions appear "automatically" as methods of a PARI object; most of them are not explicitly declared in `src/sage/libs/pari/gen.pyx`. I was wondering why `hyperellpadicfrobenius` (which does not have its own explicitly defined wrapper as far as I can find) shows up this way while `nfhyperellpadicfrobenius` does not. I had thought `paridecl.pxd` was the master source for the autogenerated methods, but it includes both of these functions and yet only one makes it through the rest of the process.

Oh I see.
I'd say it's exactly because the `nf...` function is not in GP.
IIRC functions in GP are described in `pari.desc` which is also used for autogenerating our wrappers.
This puts Cython methods in the `gen_auto` class in some `pxi` auto generated files.

The `paridecl.pxd` file is still handwritten/copied from the PARI library headers and is not involved during the generation of the wrappers (though it is needed to help Cython at compilation time I'd say).
Part of it could surely be auto-generated from `pari.desc` (or even all of it from the C headers though that would be more involved).

Therefore in the end we have Cython access to the `nf...` but no method wrapping it.

See #17631 and #17860 and https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/master/src/sage_setup/autogen/pari/generator.py

Jeroen, please correct me if I'm wrong.

<a id='comment:23'></a>
The previous commits call to PARI in all cases where the characteristic is odd and David Harvey's code is not applicable (either the field is not prime, or the characteristic is too small, or h != 0, or f is of even degree). The naive code is still used in characteristic 2.

There is one failing doctest due to the PARI issue described above. Presumably this will be fixed once we pull from upstream.
