I think that `WeylGroups.ElementMethods.reflection_to_root` should be a parent method because this method should not be available for non-reflections.

Also, I suggest the cleaner name `WeylGroups.ElementMethods.reflection_to_positive_root` to clarify which root is picked.

Or am I misinterpreting something here -- what do you think?

This came up while implementing #18597 inside `FiniteCoxeterGroups` (**not** inside `FiniteWeylGroups`), also related is #18634.

Thanks, Christian

Another technical reason (though this should not spoil the reasoning for moving or not moving the method) is that I would like to use `CoxeterGroupChevie.reflection_to_positive_root` (to come hopefully soon) and those roots are only vectors so far, without any additional parent (because there is no root system - at least not implemented - for complex reflection groups in general).

I don't really see a clear win nor rationale in making this a parent method.
You still have to specify the Weyl group element
and now in addition the parent must be accessed.
In the parent method there is still the danger that the
element is not a reflection and the method call "doesn't make sense".

In the Weyl groups case, from my viewpoint it is useful to give the
result in the combination-of-simple-roots form, so I would prefer to keep this.

If you are worried about having a uniform kind of output
after generalizing to complex reflection groups,
you can always coerce the answer from the 
root lattice to the ambient space and then coerce further to
just a vector. 

One big reason for keeping the integer-combination-of-simple-roots
form is that it is by definition integral.
The ambient spaces are only rational and therefore cannot be
straightforwardly coerced back to the integer lattices.
Final comment: someone should think about using general retractions to recognize when
a rational vector is integral or when an element of the weight lattice is in the root lattice,
etc.

I also wanted to have it that way, even for complex reflection groups (by `vector` I meant the Sage class, not the mathematical term). The only difference there was that I can access the method `reflection_to_root` from the parent, without having to implement an element class.

True, but giving an object additional input that "doesn't make sense" is a typical `ValueError`, while having a method attached to an instance of the element class that does not make sense for this element is a more fundamental error.

The reason for asking this question in the first place was that I would like to add generic code (#18597) to the `FiniteCoxeterGroups` category which makes use of this method. If it stays an element method, I cannot perform that code if I want to call this method from a complex reflection group that happens to be a Coxeter group because it lacks this method (but, as mentioned above, I can easily add this method to the `ParentMethods`, while it is hard to add to the `ElementsMethods`.

I am surprised that you aren't automatically implementing `ElementMethods` for Coxeter group elements for complex reflection groups, in parallel with the parents.

At any rate, I will move this method to the parent as it may be helpful for you.
