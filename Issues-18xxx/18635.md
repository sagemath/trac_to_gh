I think that `WeylGroups.ElementMethods.reflection_to_root` should be a parent method because this method should not be available for non-reflections.

Also, I suggest the cleaner name `WeylGroups.ElementMethods.reflection_to_positive_root` to clarify which root is picked.

Or am I misinterpreting something here -- what do you think?

This came up while implementing #18597 inside `FiniteCoxeterGroups` (**not** inside `FiniteWeylGroups`), also related is #18634.

Thanks, Christian

I don't really see a clear win nor rationale in making this a parent method.
You still have to specify the Weyl group element
and now in addition the parent must be accessed.
In the parent method there is still the danger that the
element is not a reflection and the method call "doesn't make sense".

In the Weyl groups case, from my viewpoint it is useful to give the
result in the combination-of-simple-roots form, so I would prefer to keep this.

If you are worried about having a uniform kind of output
after generalizing to complex reflection groups,
you can always coerce the answer from the 
root lattice to the ambient space and then coerce further to
just a vector. 

One big reason for keeping the integer-combination-of-simple-roots
form is that it is by definition integral.
The ambient spaces are only rational and therefore cannot be
straightforwardly coerced back to the integer lattices.
Final comment: someone should think about using general retractions to recognize when
a rational vector is integral or when an element of the weight lattice is in the root lattice,
etc.

True, but giving an object additional input that "doesn't make sense" is a typical `ValueError`, while having a method attached to an instance of the element class that does not make sense for this element is a more fundamental error.

I am surprised that you aren't automatically implementing `ElementMethods` for Coxeter group elements for complex reflection groups, in parallel with the parents.

At any rate, I will move this method to the parent as it may be helpful for you.

Are you claiming this works already, or that this *should* work?

```
sage: W = WeylGroup(['A',2])
sage: w = W.simple_reflection(1)
sage: beta = w.reflection_to_root()
sage: w*beta
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hmm...I thought I had done that at some point... However I believe that this should work:

```
sage: Q = RootSystem(['A',2]).root_lattice()
sage: W = Q.weyl_group()
sage: w = W.simple_reflection(1)
sage: beta = w.reflection_to_root()
sage: w * b
```
Your example is debatable if it work because W is acting on the ambient space, but I think it should.

Sorry, my wording was ambiguous. I meant that this should be working as it is natural, but isn't.
