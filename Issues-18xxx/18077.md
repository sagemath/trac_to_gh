Other constants give more or less specific help but

```
sage: log2?

Type:           Expression
String form:    log2
Length:         0
File:           /home/ralf/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/symbolic/expression.so
Docstring:
   Nearly all expressions are created by calling
   new_Expression_from_*, but we need to make sure this at least does
```
This confused me because I first thought I had found the Sage binary log function.

I thought I had answered this a while ago.  Obviously I got distracted.

The tutorial help for tan (gotten locally from `file:///Users/davideinstein/projects/sage/src/doc/output/html/en/tutorial/tour_help.html` looks like:

```
sage: tan?
Type:        <class 'sage.calculus.calculus.Function_tan'>
Definition:  tan( [noargspec] )
Docstring:

    The tangent function

    EXAMPLES:
        sage: tan(pi)
        0
        sage: tan(3.1415)
        -0.0000926535900581913
        sage: tan(3.1415/4)
        0.999953674278156
        sage: tan(pi/4)
        1
        sage: tan(1/2)
        tan(1/2)
        sage: RR(tan(1/2))
        0.546302489843790
```

If I run `tan?` in sage 6.7 I get

```
Type:           Function_tan
String form:    tan
File:           ~/projects/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/functions/trig.py
Docstring:
   The tangent function.

   EXAMPLES:

      sage: tan(pi)
      0
      sage: tan(3.1415)
      -0.0000926535900581913
      sage: tan(3.1415/4)
      0.999953674278156
      sage: tan(pi/4)
      1
      sage: tan(1/2)
      tan(1/2)
      sage: RR(tan(1/2))
      0.546302489843790

   We can prevent evaluation using the "hold" parameter:

      sage: tan(pi/4,hold=True)
      tan(1/4*pi)

   To then evaluate again, we currently must use Maxima via
   "sage.symbolic.expression.Expression.simplify()":

      sage: a = tan(pi/4,hold=True); a.simplify()
      1

   TESTS:

      sage: conjugate(tan(x))
      tan(conjugate(x))
      sage: tan(complex(1,1))     # rel tol 1e-15
      (0.2717525853195118+1.0839233273386946j)

Init docstring:
   The tangent function.

   EXAMPLES:

      sage: tan(pi)
      0
      sage: tan(3.1415)
      -0.0000926535900581913
      sage: tan(3.1415/4)
      0.999953674278156
      sage: tan(pi/4)
      1
      sage: tan(1/2)
      tan(1/2)
      sage: RR(tan(1/2))
      0.546302489843790

   We can prevent evaluation using the "hold" parameter:

      sage: tan(pi/4,hold=True)
      tan(1/4*pi)

   To then evaluate again, we currently must use Maxima via
   "sage.symbolic.expression.Expression.simplify()":

      sage: a = tan(pi/4,hold=True); a.simplify()
      1

   TESTS:

      sage: conjugate(tan(x))
      tan(conjugate(x))
      sage: tan(complex(1,1))     # rel tol 1e-15
      (0.2717525853195118+1.0839233273386946j)
Call docstring:
   Wrapper around "BuiltinFunction.__call__()" which converts Python
   >>``<<int``s which are returned by Ginac to Sage Integers.

   This is needed to fix http://trac.sagemath.org/10133, where Ginac
   evaluates "sin(0)" to the Python int "0":

      sage: from sage.symbolic.function import BuiltinFunction
      sage: out = BuiltinFunction.__call__(sin, 0)
      sage: out, parent(out)
      (0, <type 'int'>)

   With this wrapper we have:

      sage: out = sin(0)
      sage: out, parent(out)
      (0, Integer Ring)

   However, if all inputs are Python types, we do not convert:

      sage: out = sin(int(0))
      sage: (out, parent(out))
      (0, <type 'int'>)
      sage: out = arctan2(int(0), float(1))
      sage: (out, parent(out))
      (0, <type 'int'>)
      sage: out = arctan2(int(0), RR(1))
      sage: (out, parent(out))
      (0, Integer Ring)
```

The `Type:` is shorter.  The module information is now in the new `File:` line.
The `Definition:` has been kidnapped by aliens, possibly replaced by the less informative `String Form:`.
The `Init Docstring` and `Call Docstring` have been added.

This works because `e` is not a `PyObject` embedded in an `Expression` like `pi` (where `pi.pyobject()` returns that object). `e` has its own class, and so its own docstring. `e.is_constant()` returns `True` because `is_constant()` just checks that there are no variables present.

Well, `_sage_doc()_` apparently(?) has nothing to do with what IPython prints when appending `?` to an object (same as giving the `%pdoc` magic). This is some other help mechanism.
