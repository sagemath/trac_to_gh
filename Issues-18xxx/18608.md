<a id='comment:6'></a>Hello,

For arcs, there is a more general notion that will not cost a lot to implement:

    A `(s,n)`-arc is a set of `n` points so that in each block there are at most `s` of them. The case of `s=1` corresponds to independent set in graph. The case of `s=2` corresponds to the current definition you used.

Given a `(v,b,r,k)`-bibd (with `lambda=1`) it is easy to show that the cardinality `n` of an `(s,n)`-arc satisfies

    n <= 1 + (r-1)(s-1)

The arcs for which the above is an equality are called *maximal arcs*.

<a id='comment:10'></a>Hello,

Sometimes you use one back quote as ``(s,n)`` and sometimes two as ```s```. As you can see, the rendering is quite different in the documentation. The single backquote is used for LaTeX code while the double is used to mention the parameters of the algorithm. Try to not mix them in the same line.

It is dangerous to return `self._points` directly as it might be modified by the users. Return rather a copy of it using `return self._points[:]`.

The rest looks good.
