Currently sparse matrices use the same `is_symmetric` method as dense
matrices. It's therefore quadratic in the size of the matrix when it
could be linear in the number of non-zero entries:

```
sage: m = random_matrix(ZZ, 1000, 1000, density=0.001, sparse=True)
sage: m = m + m.transpose()
sage: %time m.is_symmetric()
CPU times: user 148 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 148 ms
Wall time: 142 ms
True

sage: m = random_matrix(ZZ, 10000, 10000, density=0.0001, sparse=True)
sage: m = m + m.transpose()
sage: %time m.is_symmetric()
CPU times: user 12.9 s, sys: 0 ns, total: 12.9 s
Wall time: 12.9 s
True
```
