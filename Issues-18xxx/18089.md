<a id='comment:2'></a>Hello,

The probabilities that you can define on the edges of a graph are far from being unique... having such method called `transition_probabilities` is really vague (not mentioning that it does return another graph and not probabilities).

The definition should be precise and is quite standard: it is simply the Parry measure.

Fine, thank you.

Trac's automerge fails for unknown reasons. I checked that this branch merges cleanly with 6.9.beta0.
