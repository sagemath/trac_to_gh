In tickets #18518 and #18585, I've fixed some problems in two methods of the class `Polynomial` to make them work with high-degree sparse polynomials. Globally, many methods in this class are written with dense polynomials (or at least low-degree polynomials) in mind. 

The purpose of this ticket is to provide fixes for some of these methods. The list of the methods I've treated is:

- `denominator`: in #18518
- `_cmp_`: in #18585

- `integral`: new method in `Polynomial_generic_sparse` + correct a slight bug in `Polynomial`
- `is_nilpotent`: fix in `Polynomial`
- `is_unit`: fix in `Polynomial`
- `padded_list`: fix in `Polynomial`
- `newton_slopes`: new method in `Polynomial_generic_sparse`
- `reverse`: new method in `Polynomial_generic_sparse` 
- `shift`: fix in `Polynomial_generic_sparse`
- `truncate`: new method in `Polynomial_generic_sparse`
- `norm`: fix in `Polynomial`

Other methods remain to be treated, but they won't be fixed in this ticket. Most importantly is the method `__call__`, but I prefer to wait for #18282 to be closed.

<a id='comment:3'></a>Hello,

Some technical comments:

* `integral`

    What about `Q = self.base_ring().fraction_field()` instead of `Q = (self.constant_coefficient()/1).parent()`?

    The `.change_ring` method is very slow but this has nothing to do with this ticket.

* `is_unit`

    Why do you care that the base ring being an integral domain? Is `1` not a unit in `Z/4Z`? Sage thinks it is

```
sage: Zmod(4)(1).is_unit()
True
```

* `reverse`

    You can use `for k,v in self.__coeffs.iteritems()`

* `integral` for sparse

    idem: use `iteritems`. In other words, replace

```
Q({k:self.__coeffs[k].integral(var) for k in self.__coeffs.keys()})
```
    with

```
Q({k:v.integral(var) for k,v in self.__coeffs.iteritems()})
```
   I found strange that in one case you defined the dictionary `d` and then `return Q(d)` while in the other you do everything at once.

Vincent

And actually, a large part is already taken to simply build the new polynomial ring. For instance, on my laptop, `change_ring` takes approximately 12µs, of which 9µs are taken for building the new `PolynomialRing`. Yet the extra 3µs shouldn't exist...

You may have overlooked the code: If the base ring is an integral domain and the input polynomial has degree > 0, it cannot be a unit so I directly return `False`. I test the nilpotency of the coefficients only if the base ring is not an integral domain.

<a id='comment:6'></a>Hello,

For non integral domain, there are some failures for `integral`

```
sage: x = polygen(Zmod(4))
sage: p = x**4 + 1
sage: p.integral()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ZeroDivisionError: Inverse does not exist.
```
And for more complicated rings as well

```
sage: Sx.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: Sxy.<y> = Sx[]
sage: Sxyz.<z> = Sxy[]
sage: p = 1 + x*y + x*z + y*z^2
sage: p.integral(y)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: no conversion of this rational to integer
```
Moreover, you kept the `self.constant_coefficient()/1`. In some cases (like the one above) there is no fraction field, so it makes sense to ask for the result of the division. But this is also accessible from the coercion model

```
sage: cm = get_coercion_model()
sage: cm.division_parent(ZZ)
Rational Field
sage: cm.division_parent(Zmod(4))
Ring of integers modulo 4
```
That way you avoid a useless division (and a coercion since you used `1` instead of `base_ring.one()`).

That being said, there are plenty of broken thing in the coercion model. I ended up with a relatively robust solution but not ideal. In order to be improved, one has to work more on the coercion model and the polynomial division.

Tell me what you think.

Vincent

<a id='comment:7'></a>The coercion model is really something I do not understand yet in Sage, so I trust what you wrote. Simply, in the following change, isn't it faster (and cleaner to some extent) to first define the underlying list of coefficients rather than defining the zero polynomial before adding monomials to it? 

```diff
-        coeffs = self.list()
-        v = [0] + [coeffs[n]/(n+1) for n from 0 <= n <= degree]
-        return S(v)
+        p = S.zero()
+        for n in range(degree+1):
+            if self[n]:
+                p += cm.bin_op(Q(self[n]), n+1, operator.div) * S.gen()**(n+1)
+        return p
```

What about something as the following?

```python
    coeffs = [self.zero()] * (degree + 2)
    for n in range(degree+1):
        if self[n]:
            coeffs[n+1] = cm.bin_op(Q(self[n]), n+1, operator.div)
    return S(coeffs)
```

Right, I should mimick what you did for the dense case. Before I do this, I actually have a question on what you wrote:

```python
        cm = sage.structure.element.get_coercion_model()
        try:
            S = cm.bin_op(R.one(), ZZ.one(), operator.div).parent()
            Q = S.base_ring()
        except TypeError:
            Q = (R.base_ring().one()/ZZ.one()).parent()
            S = R.change_ring(Q)
```
I don't get what you consider `ZZ.one()` instead of `R.one()` or even better `R.base_ring.one()`. I have the following behavior:

```python
sage: R.<x> = Zmod(4)[]
sage: cm.bin_op(R.one(),ZZ.one(),operator.div).parent()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: self must be an integral domain.
sage: cm.bin_op(R.one(),R.one(),operator.div).parent()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: self must be an integral domain.
sage: cm.bin_op(R.one(),R.base_ring().one(),operator.div).parent()
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Ring of integers modulo 4
```

and

```python
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: cm.bin_op(R.one(),R.base_ring().one(),operator.div).parent()
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field
sage: R.<x> = ZZ['y'][]
sage: cm.bin_op(R.one(),R.base_ring().one(),operator.div).parent()
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in y over Integer Ring
```

If I understand correctly, using `R.base_ring.one()` may fix the issue of your `TODO`. What do you think of this?

> - why are you keeping a method `newton_slopes` in both `polynomial_element.Polynomial` and `polynomial_element_generic.Polynomial_generic_sparse`? The algorithm does not seem to use much about the sparse structure. Moreover, why their arguments differ?


The rationale is that for very sparse polynomials, one may want to get the newton slopes in a "compressed" format, that is as a list of segments defined by their slope and length rather than as a (very long) list of length-1 segments solely defined by their slope. I decided to implement this "compressed" output for sparse polynomials only since this feature seem(ed) mostly useful for sparse polynomials. 

A modification I could do is to move my implementation in the `Polynomial` class. Do yo think it would be the right thing to do?

I understand the need of the argument. But if it also makes sense at the level of `Polynomial` then yes, do it there. That way there will only be one implementation and one signature.
