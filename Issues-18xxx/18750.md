The following is unexpected:

```
sage: F = CombinatorialFreeModule(QQ, Partitions())
sage: F.monomial((2,1,1))
B[(2, 1, 1)]
```
We should make sure that we always have the support of an element of the indexing set for a `CombinatorialFreeModule`.

We also need a similar fix for `term`.

We loose about half a microsecond each time this is called, but which can add a little bit of slowdown. However I think this is one which we must accept (and will typically be negligible due to caching or other parts of the computation). Although in these examples, we seem to achieve a marginal net speedup. So I think this is a good solution (but I haven't done extensive testing).

With:

```
sage: s = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).s()
sage: %timeit s[5,3,1,1] * s[3,3,2]
100 loops, best of 3: 15.2 ms per loop
sage: I = DescentAlgebra(QQ, 4).I()
sage: timeit('I[3,1] * I[2,2]', number=10)
10 loops, best of 3: 223 ms per loop
```
Before:

```
sage: s = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).s()
sage: %timeit s[5,3,1,1] * s[3,3,2]
100 loops, best of 3: 15.7 ms per loop
sage: I = DescentAlgebra(QQ, 4).I()
sage: timeit('I[3,1] * I[2,2]', number=10)
10 loops, best of 3: 225 ms per loop
```
