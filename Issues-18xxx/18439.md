Hi Quentin,

1. there is no need to mention the first argument <code>\`\`s\`\`</code> in the `INPUT` section. Moreover, as you can see this argument is often denoted `self` in other methods. That way it is clear that it is not really an argument.

2. In the verbose output

```
The number of points must be k^2 + k + 1 =6, got 7
```
  it would be better to also have a space after the k^2 + k + 1, in other words

```
The number of points must be k^2 + k + 1 = 6, got 7
```

3. Why did you indent your comments (i.e. the lines starting with `#`)? If you look at other methods like `__contains__` or `degree` you will see that there is no indentation.

4. I think you would better move your method down in the file. At least below the comment at line 1279

```
    #####################
    # real computations #
    #####################
```
  As you can see, the file `incidence_structures.py` is rather long and it is important to keep it organized as much as possible.

5. It would be nice to add an example with labels which are not integers

```
    sage: B = ['abc', 'adf', 'age', 'bde', 'bgf', 'cgd', 'cef']
    sage: IncidenceStructure(B).is_projective_plane()
    True
    sage: B[-1] = 'cgf'
    sage: B[-2] = 'ced'
    sage: IncidenceStructure(B).is_projective_plane(verbose=True)
    More than one line through d and e
    False
```
  that way you test that your error message explicitely mentions the points (and not their internal indices).

6. I am not exactly sure but it might be that the method `is_t_design` already implements this. The parameters would be `v=k^2+k+1`, `t=2` and `lambda=1`.

This is one is pretty unrelated

This one is useful but not complete (since it does not check for the existence of quadrilateral). Moreover, I found out that there is a wrong reference `sage.combinat.designs.designs_pyx.is_group_divisible_design` mentions `sage.combinat.designs.incidence_structures.GroupDivisibleDesign` which does not exists (it is `sage.combinat.designs.group_divisible_designs.GroupDivisibleDesign`).

this is automatic if you specify that the number of points and blocks is `v=k^2+k+1` where each block has cardinality `k+1`. The method is convenient because it avoids to input the parameters.

Could you precise what you think:
- there is no need for `is_projective_plane`
- `is_projective_plane` should call the existing `is_group_divisible_design`
- `is_projective_plane` would be better as a function in `designs_pyx.pyx`

Similarly, you check that every pair of vertices appears once, and this is already done in `is_pairwise_balanced_design`. In both cases, I do not see any reason to have them twice, especially when the second is faster.\n\nIf all this function does is call `is_pairwise_balanced_design`, then it can stay in a `.py` file, as it will not compute much.\n\nNathann",

What I see in this branch is mostly error messages, which have already been implemented in `is_pairwise_balanced_design`. Similarly, you check that every pair of vertices appears once, and this is already done in `is_pairwise_balanced_design`. In both cases, I do not see any reason to have them twice, especially when the second is faster.

If all this function does is call `is_pairwise_balanced_design`, then it can stay in a `.py` file, as it will not compute much.
