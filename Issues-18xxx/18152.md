Sage ships an implementation of the Universal Cyclotomic Field (in `sage.rings.universal_cyclotomic_field.*`) that is slower and less reliable than what is in gap. We propose in this ticket an implementation based on libgap.

It fixes some issues about the old implementation:
- #14240:  Universal cyclotomic field breaks for moderate order
- #16631: Universal Cyclotomic Field doesn't handle int and Integer the same
- #16130: Matrices over Universal Cyclotomic field failing to echelonize/inverse
- #17117: UniversalCyclotomicField elements considered real

And is about 10x faster (see [comment:10](#comment%3A10)) except for operations on very sparse elements with very large conductors (see e.g. [comment:23](#comment%3A23), [comment:27](#comment%3A27) and [comment:28](#comment%3A28)). 

Possible follow up:
- switch to Cython
- implement dense matrices by wrapping libgap matrices (see also #16116)
- slowness in conjugation? #18207 (see also [comment:28](#comment%3A28), this is unavoidable because gap uses a dense representation of elements)
- interface with libgap polynomials (#18266)

Depends on #18153

I guess so. Should be ten times faster. But I copied-pasted the GAP documentation in the top of the file:

```
Arithmetical operations are quite expensive, so the use of
internally represented cyclotomics is not recommended for doing
arithmetic over number fields, such as calculations with matrices
of cyclotomics.
```

Best,
Vincent

Hi there!

I kind of feel bad that you plan to remove that much code I wrote in weeks of work -- but I guess that's the way it goes if there is something better...

Anyway my first question would be whether it is really desired to remove an algorithm from Sage and instead use the same algorithm from Gap? Don't you think that working on the cython part of my implementation (maybe even moving to plain C of some core functionality) could get it beyond the speed of the black box (from a Sage point of view) Gap implementation?

Secondly, I remember that I did quite some tests back when I implemented the UCF. And that in the end, the Sage implementation was slower on some parts, while faster on others (one I remember where Sage was quicker was the computation of the Galois conjugates of big elements, in case you want to test, one example might be `E( 2^11 * 3^4 )`). I would really like to redo these tests, but haven't yet been able to get your branch running on my computer. I will get back once that worked out.

I also remember to have found a few bugs in the Gap implementation while implementing UCFs in Sage. That would also not be possible anymore when only relying on the implementation in Gap.



Cheers, Christian

Hello Christian,

Thanks for having a look!

Me too. I wondered if something were better with your code. But except the documentation I did not find any case were it was faster.

Sage should not reinvent the wheel. Gap is now interfaced as a fairly good level and we should try to maximize its usage at what it is good for.

You do not remember what they are? Did you report them to Gap?

Hi Vincent,

Replying to [@videlec](#comment%3A19):
> Me too. I wondered if something were better with your code. But except the documentation I did not find any case were it was faster.

Did you already redo the Galois conjugate test which I remember was slower in Gap back then?

> Great! I will add this to the `ucf_test.py` that I wrote. If you have other examples in mind, please propose. I am not sure it will make a difference now since big numbers with pexpect implies a lot of parsing and computation. With libgap it is not the case anymore.

I just did

```
sage: a = E( 2^11 * 3^4 )
sage: %time x = a.galois_conjugates()
CPU times: user 5.52 s, sys: 159 ms, total: 5.68 s
Wall time: 5.66 s
sage: %time x = a.galois_conjugates()
CPU times: user 6.81 s, sys: 170 ms, total: 6.98 s
Wall time: 6.99 s
```

and compared it to

```
gap> a := E( 2^11 * 3^4 );;
gap> L := PrimeResidues(165888);;
gap> for i in L do
> x := GaloisCyc(a,i);
> od;
```
which I had running for 30 sec before I ctrc-c'ed it. (I also believe that in Sage, a big portion of the time is spend of computing the list of coprimes.)

> You do not remember what they are? Did you report them to Gap?

I did report them, and they were fixed.

Once I get your branch running, I try to get back other tests I did.

Cheers, Christian

Hi there!

I will also do some tests on the ticket and let you know.

One thing not to forget is also the number of tickets repaired by this new implementation. If the ticket repairs them and is faster... It's difficult to say no to that.

Hello,

I pushed an experimental branch with both implementations at `public/18152`. It is certain that most doctest fail but it is not the purpose. With it you can do

```
sage: UCF_native.<E_native> = UniversalCyclotomicField_native()
sage: UCF_libgap.<E_libgap> = UniversalCyclotomicField_libgap()
sage: UCF_native
Universal Cyclotomic Field (native)
sage: UCF_libgap
Universal Cyclotomic Field (libgap)
```
and play around with both implementations.


Replying to [comment:20]: it is true that `GaloisCyc` is slow in GAP (and it is not `PrimeResidues` which takes time). I got with a little bit smaller example

```
sage: a = E_libgap( 2^9 * 3^4 )
sage: b = E_native( 2^9 * 3^4 )
sage: %time l = a.galois_conjugates()
CPU times: user 6.92 s, sys: 4 ms, total: 6.92 s
Wall time: 6.9 s
sage: %time l = b.galois_conjugates()
CPU times: user 352 ms, sys: 52 ms, total: 404 ms
Wall time: 387 ms
```

Replying to [comment:21]: I do not think that the issues in the four tickets mentioned in the description are that big (and one of them has a fix).

the branch runs now...

One issue I see is that it would if my code would not break because a few methods disappeared (such as `field_order` and `min_poly`. But this problem is minor and easy to fix -- worst case is I update my code.

Redoing the following tests `Sage` vs. `libgap`:
1.

```
sage: a = E(5)
sage: %timeit a.conjugate()
10000 loops, best of 3: 62.4 ¬µs per loop
```
vs.

```
sage: a = E(5)
sage: %timeit a.conjugate()
10000 loops, best of 3: 39.9 ¬µs per loop
```
2.

```
sage: a = E( 2^10 )
sage: %timeit a.conjugate()
10000 loops, best of 3: 69.1 ¬µs per loop
```
vs.

```
sage: sage: a = E( 2^10 )
sage: sage: %timeit a.conjugate()
10000 loops, best of 3: 75.1 ¬µs per loop
```
3.

```
sage: a = E( 2^11 * 3^4 )
sage: %timeit a.conjugate()
10000 loops, best of 3: 118 ¬µs per loop
```
vs.

```
sage: a = E( 2^11 * 3^4 )
sage: sage: %timeit a.conjugate()
100 loops, best of 3: 9.15 ms per loop
```
For the Galois conjugation, the `libgap` implementation doesn't finish in very finite time, see also your example above.

On the other hand your code becomes slower when the element is more complicated

```
sage: a = sum(E_libgap( 2^8 * 3^4, i) for i in range(0, 2**12, 37))
sage: b = sum(E_native( 2^8 * 3^4, i) for i in range(0, 2**12, 37))
sage: %timeit _ = a.conjugate()
1000 loops, best of 3: 262 ¬µs per loop
sage: %timeit _ = b.conjugate()
1000 loops, best of 3: 793 ¬µs per loop
```
So I would not say that `conjugate` is slower.

Hi,

So, all test pass on my 6.6.rc3. I went through the files and removed some trailing spaces and blank lines.

Replying to [28](#comment%3A28): I do not have a use case for sparse cyclotomic out of my head. It is also difficult to guess for the use I have in mind (mainly representation of Coxeter groups). Nonetheless, the matrices will not have large conductor. Thus I would say it is not too bad as it is for the purpose of Coxeter groups.

Going through the discussion, the current state of affairs is:

The following tickets are fixed:
#14240, #16130, #16631, #17117

The following tickets are follow-ups:
#16116,#18207

The ticket looks good to me. It is well doctested with many examples. I would put positive review, nevertheless it would be good if someone else also go over the ticket too, Christian?

Best,
JP

Salut Jean-Phillippe,

Thanks for your corrections! The branch is a fast forward. So you have to delete your previous branch. Your commit is preserved (it is now 08df5b4). I added three commits for better compatibility with the previous version:
- adding a `minpoly` and `field_order` methods as it was requested in [comment:23](#comment%3A23) (see also #18266 for a potential improvement)
- adding a `__neg__` (it is now faster to do `-E(3)`)

Those are not super strong arguments.

The main argument for not keeping it is that we would not want is wasting time maintaining it. 

A sensible approach might be to write a brief comment at the beginning of the file / class stating something like: "at this point this code is not used much (see ...). If maintaining it becomes a bother in the future, it's ok to discard it".

Perhaps one could add a comment/warning in the beginning of the file also to mention that GAP uses a dense representation and a link to the current ticket.

If there is a use case popping up in the future we could revive the code as Nicolas mentioned.

`@`Christian: In your actual usage (not tests), is sparse faster than the current dense representation of GAP?

Also: I just updated to 6.7.beta3 on my computer and pulled the ticket. There was a small conflict in the file

Should I push the resolution of the conflict here?

All test passed on 6.7.beta3!

Perhaps it would be good to mention this in the documentation as well?
