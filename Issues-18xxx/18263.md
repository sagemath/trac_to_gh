In #16836 the `__neg__` operation for cartesian product was moved from `AdditiveMagmas` to the `AdditiveMagmas.WithInverse()`. The operation was ambiguous but the feature is lost. We just revert the removal.

Moreover, there was a bug in Cartesian products of `CombinatorialFreeModule` as this generic `__neg__` was called instead of the customized `_neg_` which worked (see [#16836[comment:22](#comment%3A22)](http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16836#comment:22) and [#16836[comment:23](#comment%3A23)](http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16836#comment:23))! We replace `_neg_` with `__neg__` in `CombinatorialFreeModule`.
