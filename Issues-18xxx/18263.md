In #16836 the `__neg__` operation for cartesian product was moved from `AdditiveMagmas` to the `AdditiveMagmas.WithInverse()`. The operation was ambiguous but the feature is lost. We just revert the removal.

Moreover, there was a bug in Cartesian products of `CombinatorialFreeModule` as this generic `__neg__` was called instead of the customized `_neg_` which worked (see [#16836 [comment:22](#comment%3A22)](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/16836#comment:22) and [#16836 [comment:23](#comment%3A23)](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/16836#comment:23))! We replace `_neg_` with `__neg__` in `CombinatorialFreeModule`.

Depends on #16836
