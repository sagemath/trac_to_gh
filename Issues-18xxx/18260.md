Right now centrality_betweenness is only available for graphs even though both implementations also support digraphs.

This branch moves it where it belongs, fixes a small bug and adds a test.

The temporary digraph is initialized to be the *reverse* of the first, as it is meant to associate to each vertex a list of its predecessors. Thus, each vertex v must be able to store "indegree(v)" possible vertices.

<a id='comment:3'></a>Hello,

some remarks:
- I cannot do ctrl-C. It would be useful for large graphs.
- In file `centrality.pyx` you cite Brandes01 and in file `generic_graph.py` you cite Brandes2003. You could certainly unify.
- In fact, I'm unable to find Brandes2003 on Brandes web page: http://www.inf.uni-konstanz.de/~brandes/publications/   However, a pdf version of Brandes 2001 is available from Brandes web page: http://www.inf.uni-konstanz.de/algo/publications/b-fabc-01.pdf

David.

> - I cannot do ctrl-C. It would be useful for large graphs.


This will be done in another ticket. This one is only about making this computation available for digraphs.

> - In file `centrality.pyx` you cite Brandes01 and in file `generic_graph.py` you cite Brandes2003. You could certainly unify.


Well, I did not write the first docstring, only the second `:-P`

I 'unified' it by removing the first reference.

> - In fact, I'm unable to find Brandes2003 on Brandes web page: http://www.inf.uni-konstanz.de/~brandes/publications/   However, a pdf version of Brandes 2001 is available from Brandes web page: http://www.inf.uni-konstanz.de/algo/publications/b-fabc-01.pdf


I added this link.
