The SkewTableau.rectify() command currently runs JDT rather than taking the reading word of the tableau and Schensted-inserting it.  This is inefficient for skew tableaux lambda/mu having a large inner shape mu.  However, we still want to run the former algorithm if mu is small.  A cutoff point between these two algorithms should be added as an input which can be optionally changed by the user.

Depends on #18024

Was this a review, Josh?

I have two minor gripes (although I don't have a complete review, sorry):

1. The `la` and `la_size` definitions should be inside the `if algorithm is None` branch. They aren't used otherwise.

2. Avoid the use of `Word`s when you don't need them (e.g., when lists are sufficient). I am fairly sure (a quick experiment will suffice to tell) that `Tableau([]).insert_word(self.to_word())` can be replaced by `Tableau([]).insert_word(sum(row for row in reversed(self), []))` and will speed up the method.

I implemented Darij's first suggestion, which is obviously correct.

The second suggestion doesn't work. For one thing, you are missing '[]'s. But even then your approach doesn't strip off the 'None's.

I also reordered to have it check standardness before semistandardness at the end.

Thanks for all your edits Josh!

I'd still prefer to use words as little as possible. What about

    "body": "<a id='comment:16'>Comment 16:</a>\nNice suggestion about list comprehension -- it sped up the `to_word` on skew tableaux by a factor of 2 (even with the correct `reversed(self)` instead of `self`).\n\nI am not sure about having two different `to_word` methods, though. That would require two different `to_word_by_row` and two different `to_word_by_column` methods, too, and would look a bit wasteful. Think of it as a function whose output type is a sum type parametrized by the input -- not exactly a dirty hack. On the other hand, I would really not want it called `to_flat_list`, since besides flattening the list it partially reverses it too.",

<a id='comment:16'>Comment 16:</a>
Nice suggestion about list comprehension -- it sped up the `to_word` on skew tableaux by a factor of 2 (even with the correct `reversed(self)` instead of `self`).

I am not sure about having two different `to_word` methods, though. That would require two different `to_word_by_row` and two different `to_word_by_column` methods, too, and would look a bit wasteful. Think of it as a function whose output type is a sum type parametrized by the input -- not exactly a dirty hack. On the other hand, I would really not want it called `to_flat_list`, since besides flattening the list it partially reverses it too.
