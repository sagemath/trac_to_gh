The SkewTableau.rectify() command currently runs JDT rather than taking the reading word of the tableau and Schensted-inserting it.  This is inefficient for skew tableaux lambda/mu having a large inner shape mu.  However, we still want to run the former algorithm if mu is small.  A cutoff point between these two algorithms should be added as an input which can be optionally changed by the user.

Was this a review, Josh?

I have two minor gripes (although I don't have a complete review, sorry):

1. The `la` and `la_size` definitions should be inside the `if algorithm is None` branch. They aren't used otherwise.

2. Avoid the use of `Word`s when you don't need them (e.g., when lists are sufficient). I am fairly sure (a quick experiment will suffice to tell) that `Tableau([]).insert_word(self.to_word())` can be replaced by `Tableau([]).insert_word(sum(row for row in reversed(self), []))` and will speed up the method.

I implemented Darij's first suggestion, which is obviously correct.

The second suggestion doesn't work. For one thing, you are missing '[]'s. But even then your approach doesn't strip off the 'None's.

I also reordered to have it check standardness before semistandardness at the end.

Thanks for all your edits Josh!
