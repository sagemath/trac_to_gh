The SkewTableau.rectify() command currently runs JDT rather than taking the reading word of the tableau and Schensted-inserting it.  This is inefficient for skew tableaux lambda/mu having a large inner shape mu.  However, we still want to run the former algorithm if mu is small.  A cutoff point between these two algorithms should be added as an input which can be optionally changed by the user.

I changed 'force' to 'algorithm', which seems more common. I also cleaned up the code a bit, added error handling, and added a corresponding test. I'm not entirely convinced the output should be a `StandardTableau`, `SemistandardTableau`, or `Tableau` rather than just a `Tableau`, but I left that part as-is.

Was this a review, Josh?

I have two minor gripes (although I don't have a complete review, sorry):

1. The `la` and `la_size` definitions should be inside the `if algorithm is None` branch. They aren't used otherwise.

2. Avoid the use of `Word`s when you don't need them (e.g., when lists are sufficient). I am fairly sure (a quick experiment will suffice to tell) that `Tableau([]).insert_word(self.to_word())` can be replaced by `Tableau([]).insert_word(sum(row for row in reversed(self), []))` and will speed up the method.

I implemented Darij's first suggestion, which is obviously correct.

The second suggestion doesn't work. For one thing, you are missing '[]'s. But even then your approach doesn't strip off the 'None's.

I also reordered to have it check standardness before semistandardness at the end.

Thanks for all your edits Josh!

Oops, sorry. Programming in my head doesn't work as well as I wish it to.
I'd still prefer to use words as little as possible. What about
`Tableau([]).insert_word([i for row in reversed(self) for i in row if i is not None])` ?

I am okay with just not implementing the methods now and just copying the list-comprehension to the places where you just need the reading word as a list. However, I still don't like having the output type vary significantly based upon input choices. How about `to_word_list`? There wouldn't be much in the way of code duplication as the `to_word` would call `to_word_list`. Although I'm not completely opposed to removing the `to_word` altogether (but I'm not 100% sure about it either).
