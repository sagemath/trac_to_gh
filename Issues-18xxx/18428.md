Why this?

```
export PYTHONUNBUFFERED=yes
```

Why is it a problem if output is buffered?

> The problem with buffering is that network connections might take a while, and the last message on the screen should be flushed to indicate what we are doing.

Of course, that can be done with `sys.stdout.flush()` also...

Regarding this, I also don't think that `sage-spkg` is the best place to put this. I would rather like to put it in `build/deps`, so it also applies to building the Sage library.
