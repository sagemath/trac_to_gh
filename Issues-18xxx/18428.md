Why this?

```
export PYTHONUNBUFFERED=yes

The first INFO branch is about checking whether the tarball is already downloaded, which is now done by sage-download file. The second INFO branch is just printing logs, and I moved that to the relevant place.

Of course, that can be done with `sys.stdout.flush()` also...
