Why is it a problem if output is buffered?

    "body": "<a id='comment:9'>Comment 9:</a>\nThe problem with buffering is that network connections might take a while, and the last message on the screen should be flushed to indicate what we are doing. `PYTHONUNBUFFERED` only makes Python stdin/out unbuffered, and we don't print() that much. So I don't see where there could be a performance impact.

The first INFO branch is about checking whether the tarball is already downloaded, which is now done by sage-download file. The second INFO branch is just printing logs, and I moved that to the relevant place.

Of course, that can be done with `sys.stdout.flush()` also...

Regarding this, I also don't think that `sage-spkg` is the best place to put this. I would rather like to put it in `build/deps`, so it also applies to building the Sage library.
