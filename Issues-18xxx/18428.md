Why this?

```
export PYTHONUNBUFFERED=yes
```

Why is it a problem if output is buffered?

The first INFO branch is about checking whether the tarball is already downloaded, which is now done by sage-download file. The second INFO branch is just printing logs, and I moved that to the relevant place.

Of course, that can be done with `sys.stdout.flush()` also...

Regarding this, I also don't think that `sage-spkg` is the best place to put this. I would rather like to put it in `build/deps`, so it also applies to building the Sage library.

But sage-download-file is already too many loc. I'm thinking to refactor it into a python package (say, `src/sage_bootstrap`) that deals with downloading and potentially other pre-installation stuff.

Not sure I follow, `build/deps` is a Makefile but just setting a make variable is not good enough. You mean use the "export" gnu make extension to change the environment? 

Probably the best solution would be to subclass the stdout stream to a version that always flushes. But sage-download-file is already too many loc. I'm thinking to refactor it into a python package (say, `src/sage_bootstrap`) that deals with downloading and potentially other pre-installation stuff. That then could also be tested nicely with tox to see that it runs on different Python versions. But we should probably fix more urgent issues first.
