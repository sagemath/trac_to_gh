with gcc 4.9.2, we hit this bug:

[Header <cstddef> changes](https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.9/porting_to.html)
The <cstddef> header was updated for C++11 support and this breaks some libraries which misuse macros meant for internal use by GCC only. For instance with GMP versions up to 5.1.3, you may see:

```
/usr/include/c++/4.9.0/cstddef:51:11: error: ‘::max_align_t’ has not been declared
   using ::max_align_t;
```

This has hit here: #18198, see also [sage-devel thread](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/Tu-egDn-zLw/0S5ouau2J1AJ)

The workaround suggested by the gcc people appears to work.

Ooops, saw the "reported upstream" too late.

("Developers acknowledge bug" -- I'm not sure upstream is really aware of it such that it'll get fixed in the next release.  Bill's pretty busy and there are lots of things he wanted or has to do for the next release IIRC.)




As `mpirxx.h` includes `mpir.h`, is it really necessary to touch the former as well?

the former need to be touched as `<cstddef>` must be the very 1st include!

:-)  So this ticket will set itself to "positive review" after a while as well...

Ok.

Ok, the real problem is that **mpirxx.h** includes mpir.h too late, but it's not the purpose of this ticket to optimize the order of inclusions in MPIR's headers.

Still, I'd remove the `/* for size_t */` when including `cstddef`.  Otherwise looks ok to me, but I can't test this right now.

Oh, this is weird:

While with the patches to MPIR 4ti2-1.6.2 now "finds" GMP (i.e., MPIR), it doesn't build for me (on Sage 6.6) with GCC 4.8.4 nor 4.9.2, but 5.0.1 (RC1).

In the failing builds, GCC complains about

```
../../src/groebner/VectorArrayAPI.h:144:1: error: redefinition of 'static void _4ti2_::VectorArrayAPI::convert(const T1&, T2&) [with T1 = __gmp_expr<__mpz_struct [1], __mpz_struct [1]>; T2 = long int]'
 VectorArrayAPI::convert(const mpz_class& v1, _4ti2_int64_t& v2)
 ^
../../src/groebner/VectorArrayAPI.h:130:1: error: 'static void _4ti2_::VectorArrayAPI::convert(const T1&, T2&) [with T1 = __gmp_expr<__mpz_struct [1], __mpz_struct [1]>; T2 = long int]' previously declared here
 VectorArrayAPI::convert(const mpz_class& v1, long int& v2)
 ^
```
multiple times, where apparently only the last is fatal (= not ignored through Make rules); after the first error other things get built and installed.

This **might** be related to MPIR as well, but I'm not sure, and I guess you also tested with GCC 4.9.2, so I'm a bit puzzled.

sorry, what is the compiler you are using?

I don't see any errors in my `logs/pkg/4ti2.log` with Sage's gcc 4.9.2 (neither on several versions of Linux x64 or i386, nor on OSX 10.10.3). Unless you can explain how to reproduce your problem, I don't think I can do anything with this.

I don't think either that this is connected with MPIR

offtopic:
I see the same redefinition error as above when trying to build recent Macaulay2 on Fedora21 64 bit

It must be the case that '_4ti2_HAVE_MPZ_INT64_CONVERSION' for whatever reasons is not defined
(and '_4ti2_int64_t' is probably the same as a 'long int' on a 64 bit, causing the redefinition error)

FWIW, **without** setting any `CXXFLAGS` (just from the logs),

with GCC 4.8:

```
...
checking whether C++ compiler accepts -std=c++0x... yes
checking whether C++ compiler accepts -ftrapv... yes
checking whether -ftrapv actually seems to work for int... no
checking whether -ftrapv actually seems to work for long long... no
...
checking whether we can use the int32_t and int64_t types... yes
checking whether we can convert between int32_t and mpz_class... no
checking whether we can convert between int64_t and mpz_class... no
...
```

With GCC 4.9:

```
...
checking whether C++ compiler accepts -std=c++0x... yes
checking whether C++ compiler accepts -ftrapv... yes
checking whether -ftrapv actually seems to work for int... no
checking whether -ftrapv actually seems to work for long long... no
...
checking whether we can use the int32_t and int64_t types... yes
checking whether we can convert between int32_t and mpz_class... no
checking whether we can convert between int64_t and mpz_class... no
...
```

With GCC 5.1:

```
...
checking whether C++ compiler accepts -std=c++0x... yes
checking whether C++ compiler accepts -ftrapv... yes
checking whether -ftrapv actually seems to work for int... yes
checking whether -ftrapv actually seems to work for long long... no
...
checking whether we can use the int32_t and int64_t types... yes
checking whether we can convert between int32_t and mpz_class... yes
checking whether we can convert between int64_t and mpz_class... yes
...
```

In all cases, the C++ sources are compiled with `-std=c++0x` by the way, and

```sh
$ for v in 4.4 4.8 4.9 5.0 5.1; do echo -n "g++ $v:  "; g++-$v -E -dM -x c++ -std=c++0x /dev/null | grep __cplusplus; done
g++ 4.4:  #define __cplusplus 1
g++ 4.8:  #define __cplusplus 201103L
g++ 4.9:  #define __cplusplus 201103L
g++ 5.0:  #define __cplusplus 201103L
g++ 5.1:  #define __cplusplus 201103L
```
so there doesn't seem to be any difference (in case the version is checked in the source files).




Haven't digged deeper yet.  (Should take a look at the `config.log`s, and `configure`.)

Ok, sorry, my bad:  I had only rebuilt MPIR with GCC 5.1, and so 4ti2's conversion checks failed with the earlier versions (4.8.4 and 4.9.2) due to a rather unrelated linker error.




Dima, if nobody objects, I think you can set the ticket to positive review.  (Although "GCC 4.9 work-around" stills seems a bit misleading, as it's not a compiler bug. ;-) )
