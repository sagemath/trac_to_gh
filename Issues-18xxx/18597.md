Return the c-Cambrian lattice on delta sequences.

then a blank line, then more explanations, and then

<a id='comment:13'></a>Hi Nathan --

would you please check what of `src/sage/categories/coxeter_groups.py` you really want in this ticket, you already have the dependency #18610.

Btw that was your first contribution to `Sage` that made its way into main Sage -- congrats!

Beside that, I will do the review today.

<a id='comment:20'></a>Christian, maybe we could get rid of the dependency to #11187 ?

There is currently a problem with the `Twords` dictionary, because its keys are essentially in 

`Full MatrixSpace of 2 by 2 sparse matrices over Universal Cyclotomic Field`

but it is evaluated on some elements

`Full MatrixSpace of 2 by 2 dense matrices over Universal Cyclotomic Field`

Travis, may I ask for your help ?

<a id='comment:39'></a>ok, this looks good to me. 

Here is a new branch (on top of 6.10.beta3) where

I have made small changes to the doc, mainly formatting

and also a few changes to the code, for greater clarity.

If you agree with these changes, you can set to positive review on my behalf.
