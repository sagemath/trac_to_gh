This ticket introduces a new option so that `iter_processs` gives the output of a transducer (when processing a word) step by step. If the transducer branches (non-deterministic transducer), an exception is raised.

This is in contrast to the existing implementation, where the full output (including information on all branches of the process) is given back in each step during iteration.

An example:

```
sage: inverter = Transducer({'A': [('A', 0, 1), ('A', 1, 0)]},
....:     initial_states=['A'], final_states=['A'])
sage: it = inverter.iter_process(
....:     words.FibonacciWord(), iterator_type='simple')
sage: from itertools import islice
sage: [o for o in islice(it, 0, 5)]  # only output the first 5 letters
[1, 0, 1, 1, 0]
```

Would be nice to have, but takes some effort (not sure if possible with the infinite (lazy) words). This is now #18123.

* Added two minor commits, please cross-review
* The description of `iter_process` does not explain why a user would want to have a simple iterator. Could you elaborate and/or provide an illustrating example (for simplicity, for finite input instead of an infinite word) on how the standard and the simple iterator differ?
* IMHO, there should be doctests for all error conditions in `_iter_process_simple_`
* I do not understand the code of `_iter_process_simple_`:
  - why do you need to set `output = outputs[0]` and iterate over `output` instead of `outputs[0]`?
  - why do you reset `outputs[0] = []` at the end? 

  Could you please add comments on that?
* Please add a `SEE ALSO` block for `_iter_process_simple_` even if it does not currently show up in the reference manual.
