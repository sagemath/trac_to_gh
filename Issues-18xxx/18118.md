This ticket introduces a new option so that `iter_processs` gives the output of a transducer (when processing a word) step by step. If the transducer branches (non-deterministic transducer), an exception is raised.

This is in contrast to the existing implementation, where the full output (including information on all branches of the process) is given back in each step during iteration.

An example:

```
sage: inverter = Transducer({'A': [('A', 0, 1), ('A', 1, 0)]},
....:     initial_states=['A'], final_states=['A'])
sage: it = inverter.iter_process(
....:     words.FibonacciWord(), iterator_type='simple')
sage: from itertools import islice
sage: [o for o in islice(it, 0, 5)]  # only output the first 5 letters
[1, 0, 1, 1, 0]
```

Would be nice to have, but takes some effort (not sure if possible with the infinite (lazy) words). This is now #18123.

* IMHO, there should be doctests for all error conditions in `_iter_process_simple_`
* I do not understand the code of `_iter_process_simple_`:
  - why do you need to set `output = outputs[0]` and iterate over `output` instead of `outputs[0]`?

  Could you please add comments on that?
