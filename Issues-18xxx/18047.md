I modified the homfly[1] program to be run as a library[2]. It computes the homfly polynomial of knots and links.
I would like to add it as standard package so we can use it in #17030 i understand that it has to become optonal before moving to standard, but i would like to speed up the process. Of course, i volunteer to maintain it.

Nice. Pretty sure that doesn't work on OSX. Basically there is no way to build a shared libray without libtool in a portable manner. Also, I would be very opposed to make a library standard that doesn't do the standard autotools + libtool process.

You can use it in #17030 even if it's an optional package. Just make sure you provide a good error message in case the package is needed but not installed.
