I modified the homfly[1] program to be run as a library[2]. It computes the homfly polynomial of knots and links.
I would like to add it as standard package so we can use it in #17030 i understand that it has to become optonal before moving to standard, but i would like to speed up the process. Of course, i volunteer to maintain it.

You can use it in #17030 even if it's an optional package. Just make sure you provide a good error message in case the package is needed but not installed.

Okay, so the created tarball will be just of the source code on github (but it will do that automatically). So we could either just do the hosting ourselves or have a `spkg-src`. Well for now, this works (as this might be the only release) and to add the tag.

Thank you for your work on this.
