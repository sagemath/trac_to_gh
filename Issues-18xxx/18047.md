I modified the homfly[1] program to be run as a library[2]. It computes the homfly polynomial of knots and links.
I would like to add it as standard package so we can use it in #17030 i understand that it has to become optonal before moving to standard, but i would like to speed up the process. Of course, i volunteer to maintain it.

The library uses Bohm GC, but the test program does not. Hence you shoudl link the library to libgc, and not the test program. In other words, programmers using your library shouldn't have to know what your private library dependencies are:

There are some global variables and all symbols are exported, so there is a reasonable chance that you'll run into global state or symbol name colissions when you link it into Sage. It would probably be better to hide all symbols that you are not going to use. Possibly later when you have a better idea of what you actually want to call from Sage.
