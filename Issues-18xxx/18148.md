Sage implements an iterator on finite words n lexicographic order, and such a thing is not possible. In particular:

```
sage: w=Words([0,1],infinite=False).__iter__()
sage: w.next()
word: 
sage: w.next()
word: 0
sage: 
sage: w.next()
word: 1
sage: w.next()
word: 00
```

I see two ways out: stop claiming that it is lexicographic, or remove the function. What do you think?

Nathann

P.S.: To whoever types "git blame" (like and did) and notices that I am the author of the function: please look at the whole commit, I only moved it to a different place `:-PPP`

It is not lexicographic but [shortlex](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortlex_order) (and natural and useful)! So I would vote for keeping it and adapt the documentation accordingly.

Makes sense to me. Should we raise a warning for a while, or do we "not care" and just change the doc?

Just change the doc. The iterator does not have to be compatible with the ordering. And the class is not called `FiniteWordsLexIterator` ;-P
