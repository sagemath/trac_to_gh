All the `.pxd` files etc installed since #18494 are considered "stale" by `sage_setup/clean.py` and are deleted.

Work around this by white-listing the extensions `'.c', '.cpp', '.h', '.pxi', '.pxd'` (not the ideal fix perhaps, but it works for now)

It's a one-element tuple, which is also in other places in that file. So yes, it's intentional.
