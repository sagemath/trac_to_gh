- title: no affine

- spaces around =

- Fields, PolynomialRing imports at top of file
  - Fields should be Fields() in if (same for projective_homset)

- clean-up dsecription of periodic_points

- use set_verbose(None) instead of -1

- QQbar import at top of file

- both True and False example for periodic points

- Here is an interesting example:

```
P.<x,y,z>=ProjectiveSpace(QQ,2)
H=Hom(P,P)
f=H([x^2 - 21/16*z^2,y^2-2*z^2,z^2])
f.periodic_points(1)
```


- This example fails:

```
P.<x,y,z>=ProjectiveSpace(QuadraticField(5,'t'),2)
H=Hom(P,P)
f=H([x^2 - 21/16*z^2,y^2-z^2,z^2])
f.periodic_points(2, True)
```

Some of the points returned are fixed points. It is probably from how .remove() is functioning

- A couple more examples, using number fields would be good too.

Just a couple things here.  The new removal does now get the correct points returned, so that's good.

However, there is now a doctest failure in algebraic_scheme.py. I assume this is because it is calling the dimension 0 version instead of enumeration and so is getting the points in a different order.

```
File "src/sage/schemes/generic/algebraic_scheme.py", line 1461, in sage.schemes.generic.algebraic_scheme.AlgebraicScheme_subscheme.rational_points
Failed example:
    X.rational_points(3)
Expected:
    [(-1 : 1), (1 : 1)]
Got:
    [(1 : 1), (-1 : 1)]
```


Also, I missed this last time, but the call

```
X.defining_ideal().dimension()
```

is a groebner basis calculation. There two places where you call it just a couple lines apart. You should only call it once and store the value.
