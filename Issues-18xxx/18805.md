We are working on a didactical implementation of the cutting plane method using tableau cutting planes,
such as Gomory's fractional cut and Gomory's mixed integer cut.

This would work with `InteractiveLP`, `LPAbstractDictionary`, etc.
(Via #18804, one could run the cutting plane method also on a backend tableau.)

To work correctly with mixed integer problems, one would need to remember which variables are real and which are integer. 

Would it be acceptable to add a slot such as `._integer_variables` (a set), and a corresponding accessor `.integer_variables`() to the various classes of interactive_simplex_method?

We now have an implementation of the Gomory fractional and Gomory mixed integer cutting plane methods.

This is on top of an old version of #18742, and we'll later of course rebase it on top of the final version of it. 
But comments on the general design would already be very welcome at this point:

I hope to take a closer look during upcoming Sage Days, but some picks at formatting for now, http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#documentation-strings has a long example docsctring:

- there should be empty lines between arguments
- there should be no empty lines (especially multiple ones) in the very beginning and the very end
- references to other methods should be marked with `:meth:`, `:func:`, `:class:` as appropriate
- the very first line should be a one-line description and if at all possible it should take only one line
- mathematics should be in single back quotes and use of LaTeX is encouraged
- there should be empty lines after `::` and before the test blocks
- there should be `::` before EVERY test block

While some of these things are convention/taste/style, others are just plain necessary for documentation and testing frameworks to work. As you can see from the patchbot result, the current version does not build.

The very first change with all the commits::

+    r"""
+
+    Generate a thin long triangle with vertices (0, 0), (1, 0), and (1/2, k)
+    for some given integer K, and return the triangle in Ax<=b form.
+    This thin long triangle is an example of a system with large Chvatal rank.

+
+    EXAMPLES::

```

- empty line in the beginning of the docstring
- no one-line description in the beginning
- math should be written as LaTeX
- INPUT/OUTPUT/EXAMPLES blocks lack empty lines
- I do not understand the documentation - what does it mean to generate a triangle in the form Ax<=b?
- the output does not match the documentation, A is not a matrix and b is not a vector
- there is no need in `Integer` conversion (and its import)
- `type(...)` does nothing useful
- why would a user need such a function??? If it is for internal use, perhaps start with underscore.

Thanks for your initial comments.

The individual commits on this branch, if you read them in the right order (from oldest to newest -- the commit with the triangle testcase is the last commit before the commits that clean up docstrings), add features gradually and should be easy to review. 

Making ELLUL available for both LPDictionary and LPRevisedDictionary is motivated by implementing run_dual_simplex_method as a dictionary method. I think this makes a lot of sense because each of the individual methods that ELLUL stands for are available for both dictionary types.

We need this as a subroutine for the cutting plane method. (Perhaps run_simplex_method and run_revised_simplex_method can and should be refactored as well and pushed down to become dictionary methods?)

It may even make sense to start a new file for that given that current simplex method implementation is almost 4.5k lines. And I am not an expert in terminology, but my understanding is that "simplex method" is for real variables while Gomory cuts is a way to use it repeatedly adjusting constraints to solve integer optimization problems, i.e. "it builds on simplex method". Apart from ease of reviewing, it may make sense didactically as those who study simplex method may want to look at the code as well, so it is good to keep it simpler/cleaner.

Yes.

Yes, we'll look into this. But a few things from this patch would still make sense to add to the existing classes:

1) Refactoring of the plot method
2) Refactoring leaving_coefficients through row_coefficients etc.
3) The add_row methods

We can make separate tickets for all of these -- let me know.

<div id="comment:27" align="right">comment:27</div>

Separate tickets for separate problems are always better ;-)

The sensitivity analysis methods require some careful thinking for fitting in into existing framework where:
- problems are thought to be immutable (and I think it is a good decision in line with how other stuff in Sage works), so adding/removing constraints to them should return a new problem with augmented matrices etc;
- dictionaries are mutable, but are supposed to always represent the same problem;
- regular dictionaries are standalone entities that are not aware of "the original problem", which makes sense since they carry all the information, while revised dictionaries do remember the problem, which also makes sense since they rely on its data for computing necessary stuff.

It probably makes sense to have something like `problem.add_stuff(stuff_to_add, dictionary=None)` which returns the new problem and, optionally given a dictionary for the old problem, also a related dictionary for the new problem.
