As reported in [this ask question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/26682/bell_polynomialnkcoefficients-raises-an-error/), `bell_polynomial(n,k)` sometimes returns a rational number, while the documents claims that it outputs a polynomial in `n-k+1` variables over `\QQ`.

Replying to [tmonteil](#comment%3A2):
> Side question : is there a good reason for the variables to start at `x_1` and not `x_0` ?

Indeed, it would be much simpler without this ugly

```
R = QQ[tuple(['x_'+str(i) for i in range(1, n-k+2)])]
```
that would just become

```
R = PolynomialRing(QQ, 'x', n-k+1)
```
On the other hand, [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_polynomials) starts at 1.

Vincent, this is indeed the core question and I am happy that you mention it!

The old way to enumerate things here (not only at Wikipedia) is to to start with x_1 and to let the lower triangular matrix of coefficients start at the offset (1,1). Nevertheless the same authors define B_{0,0} = 1 but simply ignore B_{0,k} for k>0. This is a big problem affecting many number triangles on OEIS in particular older versions of the Stirling numbers (see for example the unfortunate (1,1) based definition https://oeis.org/A008275) and of the Lah numbers (https://oeis.org/A008297).

So it depends on how bold the authors of Sage want to be: I am certainly in favor of the definition with x_0, x_1,... which makes thing much cleaner and in agreement with the definition of the Stirling numbers and Lah numbers as they are defined in the recent literature (D. E. Knuth for example, Concrete Mathematics) with an offset (0,0).

Could you instead make it in such way that the coefficients belong to `ZZ`. With the current version you are intensively using coercion `ZZ[x0,x1,...] -> QQ[x0,x1,...]` for no good reasons. i.e. just use `//` instead of `/` here

```
coefficient = factorial(n) / (factorial_product * power_factorial_product)
