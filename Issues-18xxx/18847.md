This project just seems to provide an installer for Mosek. (This could also be useful for Sage, of course.)
Is there a Python interface available too somewhere? Then we should use that interface rather than writing our own.

yes, there is an [official Python API](http://docs.mosek.com/8.0/pythonapi/intro_info.html#why-the-projectname). 

they claim that "The overhead introduced by this mapping (interface to the native C optimizer) is minimal."

if you want to use the unified SemidefiniteProgram() interface in Sage you will need to write a backend; currently the only non-dummy SDP backend in Sage is cvxopt_sdp_backend.pyx
(which is not really Cython, it's just wrapping cvxopt's Python interface)

So a similar job can be done with Mosek's Python SDP interface
(which can as well be used directly, although it is not pretty...)

One certainly does not want to write different code for a different solver.

My motivation for pushing for a uniform SDP interface in Sage is the problems of polynomial optimisation which are being solved via the moment method.
(I have some particular case of this implemented in Sage, the global optimisation, in need of a cleanup etc...)

<div id="comment:10" align="right">comment:10</div>

initial commit added, an adaptation of CVXOPT SDP backend.

as it stands, the continuation would be to load Mosek's task with the problem data inside the `cpdef int solve` function, using some of `task.pucj`, `task.putvarbound`, `task.appendsparsesymmat`, and so on.

but i was thinking if it would be desirable (speed? memory?) to initialize the optimization `task` at the instantiation of the `MOSEKSDPBackend` class, and update it when the methods are being called, instead of interacting with Mosek only at its ``solve`` method.
