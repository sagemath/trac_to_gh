Isn't it a clash if patch A modifies lines N and N+1, and patch B adds a line between the same lines?

But in any case, I can do this later if somebody wants to review #18534. It is two lines long, should I split it to make it easier for reviewers to read...?

OK, I'll do that. (And hope that `TESTS` will be foldable or hidden part some day.)

I should also add `is_antichain_of_poset()` to `SEEALSO`. As #19078 shows red, I can do this now and correct it later.

Okay.

- You must add a 'the' before 'given' in the description of 'is_chain_of_poset', in the index.

- This should work, and it does not:

```
sage: posets.DiamondPoset(4).is_chain_of_poset(iter([3]),ordered=True)
...
TypeError: ordered=True not compatible with type <type 'listiterator'> for elms
```

You cannot rely on things like the existence of `__getitem__` to deduce something unrelated, like whether the ordering "matters" or not. You can rely on existing standards, but defining one in a patch won't make it true. In particular:

```
sage: Set([1,2,3])[0]
1
```

Say that it only take a list as input or do nothing. TIf the user provides a set and says that the order matters, well, I say that (s)he should be bitten as a result.

If you want to support any iterable as input, I guess that the best is this

```
sage: elms = range(10)
sage: it1 = iter(elms)
sage: it2 = iter(elms)
sage: it2.next()
0
sage: zip(it1,it2)
[(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (6, 7), (7, 8), (8, 9)]
```

But that's really a lot of infrastructure for a very small impact.

<a id='comment:36'></a>All the changes you made look good to me, positive review.

Two comments related to things I saw while looking through the code (which should probably go in separate tickets):

1) Somebody should finally implement the wrapper that gives you all antichains of a specified size.

2) In `is_chain_of_poset`, I think there should be an additional optional parameter `strict`, so that when `ordered=True`, you can test whether a given list of elements is a weakly increasing chain or a strictly increasing chain. Right now it only tests for strict chains.

Thanks!

True. Same applies to chains of specified size.

> 2) In `is_chain_of_poset`, I think there should be an additional optional parameter `strict`, so that when `ordered=True`, you can test whether a given list of elements is a weakly increasing chain or a strictly increasing chain. Right now it only tests for strict chains.


?? Isn't it just another way? Name of the parameter should propably be `saturated`.

<a id='comment:38'></a>`saturated` is something that only applies to strict chains, and it means that all of your elements differ by a covering relation. Using the standard partial (well...total) order on the integers,

`[1,1,2,2,3,3]` is a weak chain.
`[1,3,5,7]` is a strict but not saturated chain.
`[2,3,4,5]` is a strict and saturated chain.

Right now, if `ordered=True`, then it will tell you if your list of elements is a strict but not necessarily saturated chain (in the order given). If `ordered=False`, then it tells you whether the set of elements you give it can be ordered in some way to make a chain.
