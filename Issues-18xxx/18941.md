Found a bug -> type changed to defect.

Which one is correct: "Return the chains of the poset.", "Return all the chains of the poset.", "Return all chains of the poset." or "Return chains of the poset."?

OK, I'll do that. (And hope that `TESTS` will be foldable or hidden part some day.)

I should also add `is_antichain_of_poset()` to `SEEALSO`. As #19078 shows red, I can do this now and correct it later.

Okay.

- You must add a 'the' before 'given' in the description of 'is_chain_of_poset', in the index.

- This should work, and it does not:

```
sage: posets.DiamondPoset(4).is_chain_of_poset(iter([3]),ordered=True)
...
TypeError: ordered=True not compatible with type <type 'listiterator'> for elms
```

You cannot rely on things like the existence of `__getitem__` to deduce something unrelated, like whether the ordering "matters" or not. You can rely on existing standards, but defining one in a patch won't make it true. In particular:

```
sage: Set([1,2,3])[0]
1
```

Say that it only take a list as input or do nothing. TIf the user provides a set and says that the order matters, well, I say that (s)he should be bitten as a result.

If you want to support any iterable as input, I guess that the best is this

```
sage: elms = range(10)
sage: it1 = iter(elms)
sage: it2 = iter(elms)
sage: it2.next()
0
sage: zip(it1,it2)
[(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (6, 7), (7, 8), (8, 9)]
```

But that's really a lot of infrastructure for a very small impact.

True. Feels lazy today -> put to needs_review without this. And after all, this ticket was about documentation, which is now polished. (Or at least one more pair of eyes have read it throught.)

All the changes you made look good to me, positive review.

Two comments related to things I saw while looking through the code (which should probably go in separate tickets):

1) Somebody should finally implement the wrapper that gives you all antichains of a specified size.

2) In `is_chain_of_poset`, I think there should be an additional optional parameter `strict`, so that when `ordered=True`, you can test whether a given list of elements is a weakly increasing chain or a strictly increasing chain. Right now it only tests for strict chains.

True. Same applies to chains of specified size.

?? Isn't it just another way? Name of the parameter should propably be `saturated`.

`saturated` is something that only applies to strict chains, and it means that all of your elements differ by a covering relation. Using the standard partial (well...total) order on the integers,

`[1,1,2,2,3,3]` is a weak chain.
`[1,3,5,7]` is a strict but not saturated chain.
`[2,3,4,5]` is a strict and saturated chain.

Right now, if `ordered=True`, then it will tell you if your list of elements is a strict but not necessarily saturated chain (in the order given). If `ordered=False`, then it tells you whether the set of elements you give it can be ordered in some way to make a chain.
