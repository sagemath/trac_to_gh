With this this ticket we declare an embedding from the set of alternating sign matrices (`sage.combinat.alternating_sign_matrix.AlternatingSignMatrices`) to the set of matrices. We also implement comparisons using `_cmp_` that will take care of coercions.

I assumed that there is a total order on `-1,0,1`. Right. The **only** things that change with this ticket are:

1. the embedding `ASM -> MatrixSpace`
2. the fact that coercion takes place in comparisons
3. the fact that `cmp(a1,a2)` answers something when `a1` and `a2` are both `ASM` instead of raising a `NotImplementedError`.

I will not do anything more complicated as I do not know anything about `ASM`. If you think that the previous implementation was wrong then open a follow up ticket (and I might possibly close this one as duplicate). If you think that some of the three points above are wrong then please be clearer.

However that doesn't make a good ordering on ASM's.

>The **only** things that change with this ticket are:
>

Good.

> 2. the fact that coercion takes place in comparisons


This was already done (at least up to comparing the matrices).

> 3. the fact that `cmp(a1,a2)` answers something when `a1` and `a2` are both `ASM` instead of raising a `NotImplementedError`.


This is an indicator of something which we are doing wrong further up the chain, in the sense of being both 2&3 compatible, as rich comparisons should override the behavior of `__cmp__` (see the rich comparisons part of http://docs.python.org/2/reference/datamodel.html). Again, `cmp` and related methods are *gone* in Python3, so let's not step backwards by removing the rich comparisons.

I'm not saying its wrong per-say, but it might carry more meaning than it currently does. I can ask the ASM people what they want, but it's tangential to my main objection that it is removing Python3 compatibility.

Please, stop talking about Python 3 since Cython is very different from Python from that point of view. To handle comparisons of elements in Sage and if you want the coercion to be involved then you should either implement:
- `_cmp_(self, other)` (the simplest option)
- `_richcmp_(self, other, op)`
This is a choice for the programmer and he/she can even implement both. I am not forcing anybody to use one or the other, but the first one is by far easier. This is independent of whatever Python version.

The subtle difference that you seem to care about between rich comparisons and cmp does not exists even in Python 2

```
class A:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.x = value
    def __lt__(self, other):
        print "LT"
        return self.x < other.x
    def __le__(self, other):
        print "LE"
        return self.x <= other.x
    def __eq__(self, other):
        print "EQ"
        return self.x == other.x
    def __ne__(self, other):
        print "NE"
        return self.x != other.x
    def __ge__(self, other):
        print "GE"
        return self.x >= other.x
    def __gt__(self, other):
        print "GT"
        return self.x > other.x
```
Then

```
sage: a = A(1)
sage: b = A(2)
sage: cmp(a,b)
EQ
LT
-1
```
This difference is just a Cython feature that we are not using much.

The uniform way would be to have the generic `_richcmp_` default back to using the python `__eq__`, etc. It may not be simple to implement, but it is the IMO correct way to do things as we should not be making ourselves less Python3 compliant.

It's quite relevant because it is part of your proposal. In the current version of Sage, if the other element is not an ASM, then it lifts itself to the matrix space and does the comparison there (in that it compares against its defining matrix).

We can not do that. The method `__richcmp__` (and hence `_richcmp_`) is not used at all if `__eq__`, `__lt__`, etc are implemented in a Python class.

Do you have an example involving rich comparisons that differ?

For rich comparisons, yes. However for `cmp`, the code path currently completely bypasses the rich comparisons because it calls `__cmp__` (which calls `_cmp` which calls `_cmp_` and errors out).

I'm not sure what you're asking for. If you do an equality comparison between an ASM and a regular matrix, then the comparison lifts the ASM to a matrix and then does the comparison.

```
sage: ASM = AlternatingSignMatrices(3)
sage: x = ASM[3]
sage: x == x._matrix
True
```
Otherwise it returns `False`, which is a fair thing to do since these are combinatorial objects, not honest matrices (or 2D arrays). (I think I misread the code when I first looked.) I'm actually becoming more convinced that the inequality comparisons should be done in the corresponding lattices. Is this perhaps what you're asking about?

```
sage: ASM[1] < ASM[3]   # Is True in the latice
False
```

If that does have the rich comparisons in the code path, then it should fix the issue without having to define a `_cmp_`.

Here is one:

```
sage: ASM = AlternatingSignMatrices(3)
sage: x = ASM[3]
sage: x
[ 0  1  0]
[ 1 -1  1]
[ 0  1  0]
sage: x < matrix.identity(3)   # True with this branch
False
```
and it is because the coercion framework gets involved. Although ASM's only have the inequality comparisons for plotting due to the digraph calling `sorted` in `vertices()` which fails (#15372, which was a quick hack around the problem IMO) rather than just choosing some order. So the inequality comparisons are not mathematically defined as-is (even for matrices IMO, where they are just considered as 2-dim arrays). So now I'm completely convinced they should be rewritten to use the lattice.

I would like to include your changes adding the coercion and the `_matrix_` method though. I can separate this out if you want.

If you could just double check that I pulled out everything correctly, then we can set this to positive review. I'll also do followup tickets for the change for the plotting issue and ordering of the ASM's.

```
sage: A = AlternatingSignMatrices(3)[1]
sage: A < B
False
sage: B > A
True
```

I actually think that you don't want coercion for ASM's. You don't want to consider them as matrices with extra structure, you want to consider them as mathematical objects which happen to be written as a matrix.
