Helloooooo Dima,

There is a LovaZS at the head of your new module. Also, could you check that csdp is installed with a 'is_package_installed("csdp")' and raise a meaningful exception otherwise?

Could you also provide a couple of sentences to explain, in the documentation of `lovasz_theta`, what exactly this function is? This will become a method of `Graph` and well, we usually give those kind of explanations there. Depending on how verbose you feel, it can be just a link toward the relevant wikipedia page <code>:wikipedia:\`Lov√°sz_number\`</code>.

Thaaaaaanks,

Nathann

Hellooooo Dima!

I added a small commit at #18830, that mostly does text reformatting. Some accents, a shorter name for the module, a different import, making the first sentence of a docstring a one-line one, things like that.

If you agree with this, you can set this ticket to `positive_review`. Meanwhile, I'll be walking toward the lab `:-D`
