Reliable reproduction of the error condition:

```
import gc
A=sage.structure.coerce_actions.GenericAction(QQ, Zmod(6), True, check=False)
gc.collect()
C=repr(A)
```
The reason is simple: `sage.categories.action.Action.__init__` only stores a weakref to the set acted on, and nothing else. If this "action" object is mainly meant to operate inside the coercion framework then this is probably the appropriate behaviour. Note that if the action ever needs to get used, then there is a group element to act and a set element to be acted upon, so the space has to be alive. Whoever is storing this action object should have a callback on the weakref, though, to throw away this action object to avoid a memory leak.

It may just be that this action object does get used properly and that this doctest is broken. In that case the fix is:

```
sage: Z6 = Zmod(6)
sage: sage.structure.coerce_actions.GenericAction(QQ, Z6, True, check=False)
```

With one exception, the flaky tests constitute a misuse: Objects that are normally used internally are suddenly put out into the wild. It is clear that that can lead to disaster unless precautions are taken. Hence, I support the general approach in the attached branch: In these tests, one should work with permanent rather than temporary objects, to prevent premature garbage collection.

However, one should also explicitly say in these tests that we are talking about things that normally happen in the innards of Sage, and that the tests do *not* show how to work with them!

One test is different:

```diff
@@ -606,7 +624,8 @@ cdef class IntegerMulAction(Action):
 
         This used to hang before :trac:`17844`::
 
-            sage: E = EllipticCurve(GF(5), [4,0])
+            sage: GF5 = GF(5)
+            sage: E = EllipticCurve(GF5, [4,0])
             sage: P = E.random_element()
             sage: (-2^63)*P
             (0 : 1 : 0)
```
Defining an elliptic curve over a finite field should certainly be enough to prevent the finite field from garbage collection! So, here I do not agree with the fix. Apparently the test fails because of an internal bug, not because of misuse.

So, I put it to "needs work", because we should either find and fix the underlying bug here, or open a new ticket for the elliptic curve issue.

I don't see a problem with the elliptic curve example:

```
sage: import gc
sage: E = EllipticCurve(GF(5), [4,0])
sage: gc.collect()
156
sage: P = E.random_element()
sage: gc.collect()
0
sage: (-2^63)*P
(0 : 1 : 0)
```
So, why should it be changed?

I added comments in appropriate places, telling to be careful when using coerce actions outside of coercion models, reverting the elliptic curve test, and fixing some more tests in which a premature garbage collection was possible.

From my point of view, it is a positive review, but of course someone should have a look at my commit.

Hi Simon,

I merge on sage-6.7.beta1 (sorry if I did wrong). If you prefer you can only cherry-pick 60fcedc.

I agree with your commits and just added references to your ticket. I am ok for the positive review.

I suppose that Volker will tell you that (1) one should only merge if there is a good reason, and (2) one must not change the history, even if one has merged without a good reason.
