FWIW, `sage-download-file` still needs to get fixed w.r.t. filenames including a path, but probably on another ticket.

Actually, the whole interface changed, but the error here was caused by `SAGE_UPSTREAM` no longer being set (removed from `sage-env` by #15642), hence `sage-download-file` didn't get a URL.
