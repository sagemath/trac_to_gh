The only changes since 6.6.beta4 in `src/structure` are in parent from #17981 and in `element.pyx`:

```diff
-include "sage/ext/stdsage.pxi"
 include "sage/ext/python.pxi"
 include "coerce.pxi"

```
I'd be very surprised if the change I made in #17981 broke this.

EDIT - Oh, thats 6.5.beta4...

Note that in the error message it says:

```
RuntimeError: There is a BUG in the coercion model:
                Action found for R <built-in function div> S does not have the correct domains
                R = Free Algebra on 1 generators (x,) over Rational Field
                S = Integer Ring
                (should be Free Algebra on 1 generators (x,) over Rational Field, Rational Field)
```
Hence, for a change we do not have the problem of non-unique unique parents or parents that have prematurely been garbage collected, but we have a genuinely wrong domain. The coercion model expects rational field but gets integer ring.

Hello,

In the doc I would not write <code>Bug :trac:\`18221\`</code>. It looks like there is a problem, but your are actually checking that there is none. Beyond this trivial comment, I am sorry that we broke that in #17740. And the fix looks like the good one to me.
