`PLOT` part of docstrings has a problem. One just can not say for example

```
P=Poset(...)
g1=P.plot()
g2=P.ordinal_product(P).plot
g=graphics_array([g1, g2])
sphinx_plot(g)
```

as `graphics_array` has no `.plot()` function. Maybe there is something that can be done for these.

A point `(x,y)` is missing in `text()`. It should be like `text("Hello\nworld!", (1,1))`
