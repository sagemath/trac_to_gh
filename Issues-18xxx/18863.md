I think we would like the following code to work:

```
N.<a> = NumberField(x^3+2)
G = N.unit_group()
g = G.random_element()
G.subgroup([g])
```

But at the moment the last line produces a runtime error

```
RuntimeError: Gap produced error output
Error, Variable: 'u1' must have a value
```

This is currently reproducible on the single cell sage server and sage cloud.  It does not seem to depend on the number field in question.

As far as I can tell, subgroup() is unable to recognise the input as elements of the group.  I think the problem is that one cannot pass the argument 'names' when creating the unit group.  For example, the following works:

```
H = AbelianGroup(5,[2],names=list("pqrst"))
H.subgroup([H.random_element()])
```

but the following fails in exactly the same way as the unit group example

```
H = AbelianGroup(5,[2])
H.subgroup([H.random_element()])
```

I believe this is another small example, and it raises an exception in at least Sage 9.0.

```python
G = AbelianGroup([4,0])
G.subgroup(G.gens())
```

I printed out the gap commands which this runs in the `gap.eval(...)` lines:

```
G:= AbelianGroup([4]); gens := GeneratorsOfGroup(G)
f0 := gens[1]
gensH:=[f0, f1]
```

It seemed clear that the issue was likely the order check here:

https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/860e4dc9881966a36ef8808a0d1fae0c6b54f741/src/sage/groups/abelian_gps/abelian_group.py#L1549

Changing those lines to the following seem to fix it:

```python
Hgens0 = [x for x in Hgens if any(y in str(x) for y in Ggens0)]
Hgensf = [x for x in Hgens if not(x in Hgens0)]
```

This seemed to also make the code in the original post work, i.e.:

```python
H = AbelianGroup(5,[2])
H.subgroup([H.random_element()])
```

I have not tested this rigorously yet, and I have no idea if this is the "proper" way to test whether a generator has infinite order. I am also unsure if that is the thing which is being tested here.

I modified the lines I mentioned in my previous comment, however I tried to avoid using string representations and instead looked at the order of each generator appearing in each element given as a generator for the subgroup.

It passed all tests for me when running `./sage -t src/sage/groups/*` and `./sage -t --long src/sage/groups/abelian_gps/*`.
