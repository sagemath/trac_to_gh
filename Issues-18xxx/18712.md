Have implemented this: went for 0,1 indexing although this is not documented as such. Everything is documented with examples. Furthermore I added exception handling for games with more than 2 players and also handling certain bad strategy vectors.

I've also changed some of the documentation slightly to make use of the normal form game catalog that is now in `develop` (see #17392).

<a id='comment:13'></a>In the examples for the `best_responses` function, the second example for the second player actually calculates the best response for the first player.

```
sage: g.best_responses((1/2, 1/2), player=0)
```

Also, I think a value error should be raised when `player` is greater than 1. Currently the following happens.

```
g = NormalFormGame([matrix.identity(3)])
g.best_responses([1, 0, 0], 2)
.....
UnboundLocalError: local variable 'payoff_matrix' referenced before assignment
