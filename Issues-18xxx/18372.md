```
For functions where the pole is not recognized immediately when substituting the argument, residue yields output `0`.

For example:

```
sage: f(x) = 1/(1 - x - x^2)
sage: solve(1 - x - x^2 == 0, x)
[x == -1/2*sqrt(5) - 1/2, x == 1/2*sqrt(5) - 1/2]
sage: f(1/2*sqrt(5) - 1/2)
-4/((sqrt(5) - 1)^2 + 2*sqrt(5) - 6)  # pole is not recognized!
sage: f(1/2*sqrt(5) - 1/2).expand()
Traceback (most recent call last):  # here it is recognized.
...
ValueError: power::eval(): division by zero
sage: f(x).residue(x==1/2*sqrt(5) - 1/2)
0
```

This is wrong, as we would expect

```
sage: f(x).residue(x==1/2*sqrt(5) - 1/2)
-1/5*sqrt(5)
```

Keywords: **residue**

Maybe someone with more experience in Sage's symbolic engine has a opinion with respect to this issue?

I did some testing, and it seems that expanding before computing the series expansion actually is indeed marginally faster, for example:

```
sage: timeit("(1/(x^2 - x - 1)).series(x==1/2*sqrt(5)+1/2, 30)", number=300, repeat=5)
300 loops, best of 5: 18.4 ms per loop  # without patch

sage: timeit("(1/(x^2 - x - 1)).series(x==1/2*sqrt(5)+1/2, 30)", number=300, repeat=5)
300 loops, best of 5: 16.5 ms per loop  # with the patch
```

From this point of view, I think the fix would be OK -- after all, a class of `residue`-problems is fixed nevertheless. I'll push a branch to the ticket and run some doctests.
