This is the implementation of topological manifolds over a topological field *K* resulting from the [SageManifolds project](http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/). See the meta-ticket #18528 for an overview.
By *topological manifold over a topological field K* it is meant a second countable Hausdorff space *M* such that every point in *M* has a neighborhood homeomorphic to *K<sup>n</sup>*, with the same non-negative integer *n* for all points. 

This tickets implements the following Python classes:

- `ManifoldSubset`: generic subset of a topological manifold (the open subsets being implemented by the subsclass `TopologicalManifold`)
  - `TopologicalManifold`: topological manifold over a topological field *K*
- `ManifoldPoint`: point in a topological manifold
- `Chart`: chart of a topological manifold
  - `RealChart`: chart of a topological manifold over the real field
- `CoordChange`: transition map between two charts of a topological manifold

as well as the singleton classes`TopologicalStructure` and `RealTopologicalStructure`. 

`TopologicalManifold` is intended to serve as a base class for specific manifolds, like smooth manifolds (*K*=**R**) and complex manifolds (*K*=**C**). The follow-up ticket, implementing continuous functions to the base field, is #18640.

**Documentation**:
The reference manual is produced by
`sage -docbuild reference/manifolds html`
It can also be accessed online at http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/doc/18529/reference/manifolds/
More documentation (e.g. example worksheets) can be found [here](http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/documentation.html).

The phrase "manifold over a field K" sounds odd to me. Is it used in the literature? What if K is a finite field? It seems that if X is a finite discrete space, for every finite field F and for every non-negative integer n, then X is a manifold over F of dimension n: F and n play no role. (I'm assuming that finite fields have been given the discrete topology.)

I think you might say "topological manifold over a topological field K", since obviously the topology on K is critical. Or you could omit "over a field K", and mention in the documentation that users can specify a topological field (like \CC, rather than the default \RR) if they want.

Thanks for your comment. You are right: this is an abusive generalization of "manifold over R" and "manifold over C", which are used in the literature. 

>What if K is a finite field? It seems that if X is a finite discrete space, for every finite field F and for every non-negative integer n, then X is a manifold over F of dimension n: F and n play no role. (I'm assuming that finite fields have been given the discrete topology.)

Thanks for your suggestion; I've modified the ticket description accordingly. I've also added what is meant by "topological manifold over a topological field K".

PS: note that the code in the associated branch is still in a very crude draft state, but should be ready for review within a few days.

No strong argument, except that this is shorter to write (well, thanks to the tab key this is a pretty weak argument) and it is a reminder of Top, which is the standard name for the category of topological manifolds. Similarly, we use`DiffManifold` for differentiable manifold, Diff being the standard name of the category of differentiable manifolds. 

> Everywhere in Sage classes have plain names like `PolynomialRing` and not `PolRing`.


This is indeed a strong point: naming conventions should be homogeneous all across Sage. So I am considering to change everywhere `TopManifold` to `TopologicalManifold` and `DiffManifold` to `DifferentiableManifold`.

Yes, it is pretty clear that we should have the following renaming of *classes*:
- `TopManifold` --> `TopologicalManifold`
- `DiffManifold` --> `DifferentiableManifold`

Regarding the user interface, we could indeed have a *function* `Manifold` that looks like 

```
Manifold(dim, symbol, type='smooth', ...) 
```
with `'topological'`, `'differentiable'`, `'smooth'` as possible values for the parameter `type` (as well as `'analytic'`, etc. in the future). A question: should `'smooth'` be the default value?

Actually in the current setting, the atlas is not specified at the construction of the manifold: charts and transition maps are introduced on the fly, at any step in the user workflow. Therefore the type of manifold has to be declared explicitly by the user. It is my impression (but I may be biased) that one speaks about a "manifold" without any qualifier, one implicitely means a "real smooth manifold". Therefore I would set the default arguments of the `Manifold` function to `field='real'` and `type='smooth'`.

I am not sure an ABC would help here: this would make a clear distinction between the manifold and strict subsets of it (thus avoiding the very few tests `self is self._manifold`), but on the other hand, we need open strict subsets to be in the class `TopologicalManifolds`. 
> - Maybe put the subsets into the `Subobjects` class and maybe consider not making it a facade?

I had the impression that the facade feature is exactly what we need, since we can have the same point created from different facade parents by means of different charts: if `U` and `V` are two overelapping open subsets of manifold `M`, it may happen that the same point of `M` is declared in two different ways:

```
   p = U((x,y), chart=C1)
   q = V((u,v), chart=C2)
```
Thanks to the facade mecanism, `p` and `q` will have the same parent: `M` and then it is possible to check whether `p == q`; this will hold if the coordinates `(x,y)` in chart `C1` correspond to coordinates `(u,v)` in chart `C2`. Is there something bad in using facade parents?

Indeed!

Why should we avoid `UniqueRepresentation`? It's true that manifolds are mutable as Python objects, since the main idea is to add charts (and vector frames for differentiable manifolds) "on the fly" (for, in a concrete calculation, charts are often defined from previous ones by some transition map that might depend on some computational result and therefore it is impossible to introduce all charts at the instantiation of the manifold object). But this mutability is "secondary": the primary attributes of a manifold being its dimension, its name and its base field. With respect to these, the manifold is immutable. The need for `_clear_cache_()` in some doctests seems a very small annoyment, with respect to the benefit of `UniqueRepresentation`, doesn't it ? (I am afraid I have not understood the non-doctest case involving the garbage collector that you mentioned)

OK, I will change this.

Yes, I agree. I was also not satisfied with this.

Yes, I agree too.

I gave a second thought to this: are you thinking about something like

```
                               The_ABC
                              /      \
  TopologicalManifoldStrictSubset  TopologicalManifold
                              \      /
                 TopologicalManifoldStrictOpenSubset
```
with the methods superset(), intersection() and union() being implemented in each of the classes `TopologicalManifoldStrictSubset` and `TopologicalManifold` ?

The diagram you have below is what I was thinking (at least the first 2 levels). This gives better separation of concerns and better distinguishes the two classes.

It depends on what you want the points associated with. If they are to be considered proper subsets of the manifold, where you want to do operations, then the point should know that it belongs to the subset. If it is really just reflecting a particular chart, then you probably should reconsider your entire class hierarchy because I think it shouldn't quack like a manifold in that case.

It really comes down to what you're doing mostly in the code. If you'd be doing a lot of conversions between points thought of as being in the subset and as in the manifold, then a facade is probably an okay way to go. If you care about associating the point with a particular subset, then it should not be a facade.

The hyperbolic plane works well because it is uniquely defined. Also not all parents are `UniqueRepresentations`, the reason why we do this is because of the coercion framework and speed. Identity checks are typically much faster than equality checks.

The need for `_clear_cache_()` in some doctests seems a very small annoyment, with respect to the benefit of `UniqueRepresentation`, doesn't it ? (I am afraid I have not understood the non-doctest case involving the garbage collector that you mentioned)


This comes down to the manifold not being well-defined by its dimension, name, and base field. It also needs to be defined by its chart. I understand that giving two distinct manifolds the same name is bad mathematically, and you are reflecting that in your code. However what if I create a manifold `M`, then decide I want to create a new (and different) manifold `M` of the same dimension over the same base field? When I try to do this naïvely, I get all of the previous chart information much to my surprise (the garbage collector this was more about temporary objects).

Indeed. More precisely, a manifold is defined by its maximal atlas. But there is no way to represent the latter in Sage, nor in any computer system. Accordingly, we cannot check the equality of two manifolds. This is why equality by id seems reasonable here.

You are right: a user may want to restart some computation by creating a manifold with the same name as that used previously. If he is doing so in the same session, the `UniqueRepresentation` behavior will return the previously created object. We cannot demand that the user runs `_clear_cache_()` before creating the manifold...

The above commit addresses some of the comments by Travis and Vincent:
- The class `TopManifold` has been renamed `TopologicalManifold` and the class `TopManifoldSubset` has been renamed `TopologicalManifoldSubset`.
- A function `Manifold` has been introduced as the unique entry point to construct manifolds (this is the only piece that is imported in the global namespace, as a lazy import).
- Tests of `_element_constructor_` are performed by call to the parent.
- The classes `TopologicalManifold`, `TopologicalManifoldSubset`,  `Chart` and `RealChart` do not longer inherit from `UniqueRepresentation`. Consequently, they have been provided with functions `__hash__`, `__eq__`, `__ne__` and `__reduce__` (the latter turned out to be necessary for correct pickling). In addition, the class `Chart` has been endowed with `__getstate__` and `__setstate__`.

It seemed necessary to implement a proper `__eq__`, i.e. not to have equality by id, since we cannot afford equality by id when relaxing the unique representation, otherwise the pickling test `loads(dumps(M)) == M` would failed, since obviously `id(loads(dumps(M))` differs from `id(M)`. 

Other issues mentionned by Travis have not been addressed yet:

- need for an ABC for manifolds and their subsets, introduce a specific class for open subsets (currently they are dealt by class `TopologicalManifold`, with the attribute `self._manifold` representing the ambient manifold)
- treatment of real and complex fields as base fields (i.e. avoiding to default to the finite precision representations `RR` and `CC`)

Did you have as the first lines of the `__eq__` being

```
if self is other:
    return True
```
since "most" equality checks should be by identity. Granted, we do lose some speed because this is a python check, as opposed to a cython check.

For example, if one first construct S<sup>2</sup> with an atlas of two stereographic charts and then another S<sup>2</sup> with an atlas of two polar charts, the two atlases differ, while both objects represent the same manifold.


`__eq__` does not have to represent mathematical equality; IIRC we already have examples of this in Sage, both when `__eq__` is weaker and stronger than mathematical equality (which often times people wish it could be isomorphism). So we are okay with making `__eq__` not reflect the mathematical equality.

The design reflects the mathematics as charts are morphism from **R**<sup>n</sup> -> *M* and that the manifold *M* is an abstract set of points. My proposal goes around the mathematical definition of a manifold as a set of points by saying the manifold *M* is defined by its charts. So this approach is definitely bad.

I worry that this will cause subtle issues with pickling. For example, if we clear the cache when creating `M2`, then `loads(dumps(M1))` will probably not equal `M1`, but instead equal `M2`. I haven't checked if this actually happens.

There are a few different options that I see at this point.

- Drop pickling `==` support and use `sage.misc.fast_methods.WithEqualityById` (this will get your speed back). However we could get close by implementing pickling as saving the current atlas.
- Go back to `UniqueRepresentation`, but also have it additionally keyed by the time it was created:

  ```
  sage: import time
  sage: time.time()
  1446566813.121567
  ```
  You could do this by having

  ```
  @staticmethod
  def __classcall__(cls, dim, name, latex, R, time_key=None):
      if time_key is None:
         from time import time
         time_key = time()
      return super(TopologicalManifold, cls).__classcall__(cls, dim, latex, R, time_key=time_key)
  
  def __init__(self, dim, name, latex, R, time_key):
      # Just ignore the time_key input
  ```
  (or doing it via a `UniqueFactory`).
- Warn the user that they can only create one manifold of a given (latex) name of a given dimension over a given field.
- Figure out some other way to better uniquely specify a manifold.
- Ask someone else, like Jeroen, Simon, Volker, and/or sage-devel, for other options.

Personally I would go for first one since pickling within a session is, I believe, usually not needed/used.

Well, as soon as we have more than two charts on a manifold, this is no longer true.

There is no reason to write ugly stuff like

```
self.__eq__(other)
```
and

```
foo.__hash__()
```

The alternatives

```
self == other
```
and

```
hash(foo)
```
are easier to read and faster.

From [this link](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1060499/difference-between-typeobj-and-obj-class) and [that one](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10386166/python-self-class-vs-typeself), it seems that for Python new-style classes (i.e. the only classes used in Sage), `type(foo)` is fully equivalent to `foo.__class__` and it is indeed best practice to use `type(foo)`.

Actually, the precision is not used in the current setting, so neither `RR` nor `RealField` is really necessary. `RR` was used as a substitute for the true real field, which cannot be represented in the computer. Looking further, why not using Sage's `RealLazyField` for this? It seems that it is intended to be closer to the true **R**. One drawback is that we have (for the moment)

```
sage: RLF in Fields().Topological()
False
```
So `RLF` cannot be passed to the manifold constructor. 

The same considerations apply of course to `ComplexLazyField`.

Yes, for the time being, we could have two attributes in the manifold class:
- `_field_type`, a string with values `'real'`, `'complex'` or `'other'`, which is the thing that is checked against to know if we are dealing with e.g. a real manifold; for instance, to decide whether the charts are constructed in the subclass `RealChart` of the generic class `Chart`. 
- `_field`, which contains the field for the manifold category; it could default to `RR` for `_field_type == 'real'`.
Do you agree?

Yes that sounds like a good plan along with some simple type checking for default values of `_field_type` against `RealField` and `ComplexField` since (IMO) these are what most users will use for the reals and complexes.

I will then start my refactoring. I will try to make every change as granular as possible in the commits so we can cherry-pick changes if you don't necessarily agree with them.

For the tangent spaces, you should coerce the point to the manifold in the distinguished chart as the input. You're going to have to do this anyways:

```
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M', field='real', type='topological')
sage: X.<x,y> = M.chart()
sage: U.<u,v> = M.chart()
sage: trans = X.transition_map(U, [x-2,y-2])
sage: p = M.point((0,0), X)
sage: p2 = M.point((-2,-2), U)
sage: p == p2
True
sage: p is p2
False
```

How about this, let me make my changes and you can see what breaks or how much things slow down and we will use that to decide what we should do going forward. Does that sound reasonable to try? (In general, I would also argue that users should create their points from the manifold using one of those charts.)

OK very good. 
Have you noticed that some doctests failed in the latest commit? This due to a typo: "coordintes" instead of "coordinates" in the replacement of

```
        if self._restrictions != []:
            substitutions = dict(zip(self._xx, coordinates))
```
by 

```
        if self._restrictions:
            substitutions = {x: coordintes[i] for i,x in enumerate(self._xx)}
```
in `chart.py`. By the way, why is the second form better than the first one?

No, but I didn't run all of the doctests before I pushed (in part because I was planning to do a lot more work).

I think the latter is more clear in terms of code. I also thought I had run some timings before that the second was faster, but this is not the case:

```
sage: k,v = range(1000), range(1000)
sage: %timeit d = dict(zip(k,v))
The slowest run took 5.50 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
10000 loops, best of 3: 58.4 µs per loop
sage: %timeit d = {x: v[i] for i,x in enumerate(k)}
```
So I will just revert this change (and any others like it).

In actual calculations, the main bottleneck is the simplification of symbolic expressions, which is performed in Lisp by Maxima. So I don't think that cythonizing would improve much here. On the other hand, parallelization over the components of vector fields (and more generally tensorial objects), as performed in #18100, helps a lot.

Something else to do would be to define coercions between the respective subsets, but that we can do on a follow up since these are just sets at this point.

The biggest thing to note is that I have separated out the structure of the manifold into a separate class. This has several distinct advantages:

- It has better encapsulation of data, which should result in fewer copies of the defining data needed and fewer duplication of functions.
- It could allow us to strength/weaken the structure on the manifold dynamically.
- We might only need to have one manifold class and one subset class, that way we don't have to duplicate documentation.

The main drawback I see at the point is we don't expose the attributes of the structure (e.g., the differential order) directly from the manifold instance. However, if we want this behavior, then we can attach the appropriate data as (hidden) (class) attributes to keep some of the modularity; it just results in more classes.

I didn't want to change documentation until I knew you approved of this refactoring (or the alternative proposed above). Please tell me what you think and how you feel it fits with the differentiable manifolds part. I hope this does not cause too much trouble with rebasing.

That is okay with me.

I wasn't imagining that they would be singletons, as they would carry instance information like differential order.

Good point. Then rather these being instance objects, they should probably be mix-in classes. This would help keep some separation of concerns, avoid some redundancies, and make it easy to manage the distinction between the full manifold and the submanifolds.

OK (I thought that since you were using singletons for the topological structure, you planed to use them for any kind of structure).

Regarding the specific case of the differential order, we may also consider that it is part of the structure per se and not of the instance, i.e. consider that a C<sup>2</sup>-structure differs from a C<sup>4</sup>-structure.

If we just had a simple inheritance, then we'd have this as our hierarchy:

```
     Abstract
   /         \
Subset      TopManifold
  |    ____/   |
  |   /        |
TopSub      DiffManifold
  |    ____/
  |   /
DiffSub
```
However, with a mixin, we would have this:

```
     Abstract
   /         \
Subset      TopManifold
  |    ____/        |
  |   /             |
TopSub  DiffMixin   |
  |    /        \   |
DiffSub          DiffManifold
```
In particular, notice that this does not introduce another diamond problem. It also makes it easier to add another class at the `Subset` and `TopManifold` level if we ever wanted to.

Ideally, I would like to abstract away the `Subset` parts to a mixin to completely avoid any diamonds, but I couldn't really figure out a good way to make that work.

Bad news: the removal of unique representation breaks parallel computations in #19147 (affine connections). For instance, in the branch of #19147, if one performs

```
sage: M = Manifold(3, 'M')
sage: X.<x,y,z> = M.chart()
sage: nab = M.affine_connection('nabla', r'\nabla')
sage: nab[0,0,1], nab[2,1,2] = x^2, y*z
sage: use_multiproc(2)  # parallelization on 2 proc
sage: nab.riemann()
```
one gets the error message:

```
RuntimeError: There is a bug in the coercion code in Sage.
Both x (=Scalar field on the 3-dimensional differentiable manifold M) and y (=Scalar field on the 3-dimensional differentiable manifold M) are supposed to have identical parents but they don't.
In fact, x has parent 'Algebra of differentiable scalar fields on the 3-dimensional differentiable manifold M'
whereas y has parent 'Algebra of differentiable scalar fields on the 3-dimensional differentiable manifold M'
```
and sage terminates badly (core dumped). 
The reason is that the parallelization is using the pickling: the parallel iterator `sage.parallel.multiprocessing_sage.parallel_iter` invokes the function `sage.misc.fpickle.pickle_function`.
With unique representation, the pickling was fine and the above issue did not occur.
Note that parallelization of heavy computations like that of the Riemann tensor is really important!...

The first looks to me much better than the second one: the nice feature of the parallelization framework as implemented in #18100 is that it is implemented at the `Components` level, i.e. for any indexed set of ring elements, whatever the ring. It sounds bad to redefine this for the special case where the ring is an algebra of scalar fields. I shall discuss with Marco about implementing some multiprocessing that does not rely on pickling.

Another solution would be to revert to `UniqueRepresentation` for manifolds (once again!). Since now the user creates manifolds via the front-end function `Manifold` and not by a direct call to the manifold class constructor, the main issue raised at the end of [comment:31](#comment%3A31) could be overcome by the handling of the cache in `Manifold`. In this way

```
sage: M1 = Manifold(2, 'M')
sage: M2 = Manifold(2, 'M')
```
would result in two different objects, as desired, but

```
sage: M1 == loads(dumps(M1))
```
would still work, because the unpickling does not go through the function `Manifold`. 
There remains the issue with `UniqueRepresentation` raised by Nils Bruin in the [sage-devel thread](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/Vzfj1haZHho/sLfOJ3ujBQAJ): *Avoid UniqueRepresentation if you can. It requires expensive processing of construction parameters and hence introduces bad overhead and it introduces "global variables" in a way that is much worse than global variables.* 
However, in a typical work session, one should not create so many manifolds, so the "expensive processing of construction parameters" is not a too severe issue.

This breaks pickling:

```
sage: class Foo(UniqueRepresentation):
....:     def __init__(self, i):
....:         pass
....:     
sage: F1 = Foo(1)
sage: Foo._clear_cache_()
sage: F2 = Foo(1)
sage: F1 is F2
False
sage: F1 == loads(dumps(F1))
False
sage: F2 == loads(dumps(F1))
True
```
The reason is pickling still goes through the `UniqueRepresentation` cache. I am still convinced we should not be using `UniqueRepresentation` for the manifolds.

Yes but by "handling of the cache" I had in mind not a call to `_clear_cache_` but rather adding a 
unique tag to the constructor, such as the time tag that you already suggested. In this way, pickling would work.

I did some exploring in the coercion code and some testing using this:

```python
from sage.structure.parent import Parent
from sage.structure.element_wrapper import ElementWrapper
from sage.misc.fast_methods import WithEqualityById
from sage.categories.additive_groups import AdditiveGroups

class Foo(Parent, WithEqualityById):
    def __init__(self):
        Parent.__init__(self, category=AdditiveGroups())

    def __reduce__(self):
        return (Foo, ())

    def _coerce_map_from_(self, R):
        return isinstance(R, Foo)

    def _element_constructor_(self, x):
        if isinstance(x, ElementWrapper) and isinstance(x.parent(), Foo):
            return self(x.value)
        return super(Foo, self)._element_constructor_(x)

    class Element(ElementWrapper):
        def _add_(self, other):
            return self.parent()(self.value+other.value)
```
which I think is a minimal example of the behavior you want. Pickling and coercion seem to work fine:

```
sage: F = Foo()
sage: F2 = loads(dumps(F))
sage: F(1) + F2(1)
2
sage: F == F2
False
```

Furthermore, from looking at your code, the reason why it now breaks is you're assuming unique representation by not passing the scalar field algebra as the first argument of the scalar field. So it's getting mismatches because the `domain.scalar_field_algebra()` may not be the scalar field algebra that was suppose to be creating that particular scalar field.

This was already the case (cf. the code of `DifferentiableManifold.scalar_field_algebra()`).

Hmm...that is very strange. Perhaps something with pickling and the interface?

However, I starting to lean towards reinstating the `UniqueRepresentation` behavior with initialization using a large random number via `manifold_constructor`. This will keep memory down with pickling because of all of the extra data that would need to be initialized after every pickling within the session. In an ideal world, I think we would implement our own variable system for the manifolds and hold some kind of global reference to that. I will think about this on my way home right now.

Question, should override the `__copy__` for the manifold (at least, I feel there might be some use cases for building two manifolds with a common base atlas)?

Replying to [tscrim](#comment%3A83):
> Okay, let's revert back to having `UniqueRepresentation` because it will work as a session/variable manager. I don't think we should spend a lot of time doing that as we can hack around it (even though it is in effect what we are doing/should do). I don't like it because it is a hack, but it seems like the best option for now. Unless you want to directly use Python's multiprocessing with shared memory for the corresponding parents to avoid pickling, which I would still somewhat prefer in a way so we don't have to do this hack. (Multithreading in Python has shared memory, but unfortunately it can't run on multiple processors because of the GIL.) Anyways, I leave the decision up to you.


Yes, I think it is reasonable to revert to `UniqueRepresentation` at this stage, leaving Python's multiprocessing without pickling for a future development, exploring meanwhile other ways of parallelization (IPython parallel framework ?). I've rerun this morning some benchmarks on the commit of #19209 based on `UniqueRepresentation` (commit [82f6f495b](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/82f6f495bb6f729624dd8396208f5a3c67e2fa8d)) merged into Sage 6.10.beta6: the gain in the computation of the Riemann tensor of a non-trivial metric (4-dimensional [Kerr metric](http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/examples/html/SM_Kerr.html)) is really significant: a factor of 4 when using 8 cores instead of 1 (30 s instead of 115 s on Xeon E5-2623 CPUs).

In the above commit, I've
- renamed class `Manifold` to `TopologicalManifold`
- renamed function `manifold_constructor` to `Manifold`, i.e. to the name by which it is imported 
  to the global namespace (IMHO, this makes the documentation more clear for a beginner: 
  previously, `sage: Manifold??` was returning something like `def manifold_constructor`...
  Also the html doc looks better with a single name)
- renamed class `TopologicalSubmanifold` to `OpenTopologicalSubmanifold`, to avoid any ambiguity with 
  embedded submanifolds of lower dimension
- revert the attribute `_open_covers` to a list of lists (instead of a set of frozensets), mostly to
  ensure the reproductibility of computations from one machine to another one, i.e. this garantees
  that `for ... in` loops are always performed in the same way (maybe this is something to 
  be discussed further...). Moreover, the mathematical definition of an 
  open cover refers to an indexed family, which corresponds more to a list than to a frozenset.   
- removed the method `is_open()` from `AbstractSet` (where it was always returning `True`!) and
  implemented it in `TopologicalManifold`. Now it is on the same footing as methods `superset`,
  `union` and `intersection`, which are not implemented in the base class `AbstractSet` but in each
  of the subclasses `TopologicalManifold` and `ManifoldSubset`
- removed the (unused) argument `category` from `ManifoldSubset.__init__`
- added an example to illustrate the class `OpenTopologicalSubmanifold`, as well as enough doctests
  to get a full coverage

To answer to some of your questions in the code:
- I don't think that `ManifoldPoint` must inherit from `AbstractNamedObject` since the name is
  not essential in the definition of a point (it can have no name), contrary to that of a subset. 
  Moreover, it would slower the creation of points, which can be a problem (no such problem for
  parent objects, which are not expected to be massively created)
- Yes, I think we need `list_of_subsets` to have something duplicable from one machine to another one
  (cf. remark above about `_open_covers`).

The test suite of `ManifoldSubset` and `OpenTopologicalSubmanifold` fails because of the lack of a method `lift`. What this method shall be? I guess we have to wait for the morphism ticket (#18725) to implement it.

In the above commit, the class `AbstractNamedObject` has been improved so that there is no need to redefine its method `_repr_()` in the classes that inherit from it. Consequently, methods `_repr_()` have been removed from all the set and manifold classes. For all these classes, `_repr_()` and `_latex_()` are now on the same footing: they use the `AbstractNamedObject` implementation. This will also be used for the scalar field algebras of #18640.

The `set` of `frozenset`s will have a faster lookup as manifolds get larger. I think this is still valid mathematically because the indexed family does not have to be ordered as far as I know. So it would be more like a `dict`, but I don't think we care about the indexing; if we did, then we should go to a `list`. For the doctests, we can just do a `sorted` or we have an internal method which returns it in a canonical way (i.e., ordered via its string representation).

Perhaps the default value for `is_open` in `AbstractSet` should return an `Unknown`, be an `@abstract_method`, or raise a `NotImplementedError`? I'm in favor of the first one.

> - removed the (unused) argument `category` from `ManifoldSubset.__init__`


This was previously there as I was wanting to call the `__init__`, but since I copied the constructor, this has become unnecessary. Although now I'm thinking we should have an `_init_subset` method to remove the duplicated code and have that be called by both `ManifoldSubset.__init__` and `OpenTopologicalSubmanifold.__init__`.

Thank you.

Fair enough. Although if that extra little function call is going to matter, then I think we should cythonize `ManifoldPoint`.

Same comments about `_open_covers` as well.

`lift` can just be a method that creates the corresponding point in the ambient manifold, and similarly for `retract`. Once we have #18725, we can convert it to a `@lazy_attribute` which is set to the morphism (note that this does not change the API).

I don't reall agree with [comment:92](#comment%3A92). I feel that this only removes a few docstrings, adds some internal complexity, and increases memory usage (although since we aren't really using this for `TopologicalPoint`, the memory usage is less of a concern).

I'm glad to hear the mixin class idea is working.

For this specific case (comparison), it depends on the open cover, not on the ordering of the subsets in it.

No there is no control at the API level, because the API is `__eq__` (one cannot pass extra parameters)

- keep the `O(1)` checking speed of something being an open cover;
- and more robust when doing the comparisons (we check to see if the distinguished open cover is an open cover of the other one, so we don't have to worry about things breaking if something ends up being out of order in the creating of the open cover list).

It means one additional attribute we'll have to manage, but I think that is an epsilon cost.

There are 2 really, really good ideas for having a more complicated class hierarchy: encapsulation and localization.

You had many `if self._manifold is self:` statements, which breaks the localization principle; it is acting differently because it is essentially a different object. This is a strong code smell and you had enough of these at this level to (IMO) warrant splitting the classes.

Additionally, subsets of a manifold are precisely that, subsets. So we should encapsulate that in separate classes. Mathematically we identity an open subset as a manifold, but by doing so, we loose the information that it is really a subset of another manifold. As such, I feel that having separate classes actually better reflects the mathematics.

In an ideal world, I would like to have a hierarchy similar to Hierachy-2, but with an additional subclass corresponding to each type of manifold that is obtained by adding a subset mixin class. Yet, that doesn't seem possible with the current core design.

While the Hierarchy-1 seems more complicated, it actually will be easier to maintain and debug as code is local to the class (i.e., if you are a subclass of `A`, then you act in the same way and like `A` irregardless of your input).

This assessment is based on my experiences and what I learned as good OOP principles. However, I have not looked at SageManifolds beyond this ticket at present, whereas you have worked heavily on it. So perhaps we can get some more data. How many times before the refactoring did you have to do a `self._manifold is self` test? Also what is your thoughts on maintenance and extendability?

Something else might be to get a 3rd party's opinion (Nicolas and/or Darij comes to my mind). I could also sit down and plan out how I would do everything from the ground up to see if I can devise a better overall strategy if you think there might be some benefit to that at this stage.

As such, I feel that having separate classes actually better reflects the mathematics.\n\n\nActually, at the moment, we are dealing with the open subsets in exactly the same way as we are doing with the whole manifold, i.e. we set up charts on them, define tensor fields, etc. This can be seen by noticing that in Hierarchy-1, the class `OpenTopSubmanifold` has very few methods in addition to those inherited from `TopologicalManifold`. Similarly, none of the classes `OpenDiffSubmanifold` and `DifferentiableManifold` introduces any attribute or method by itself, in addition to those inherited from `DifferentiableMixin` (except for their `__init__`). \nMaybe, in a future development, one could have operations that make sense only for open subsets or only for the whole manifold. Then having two separate classes is clearly the way to go. However,  at the moment I don't see any such operation, apart from those listed above: the printout (via `_repr_`) and the union/intersection with other subsets. \n\n> \n> In an ideal world, I would like to have a hierarchy similar to Hierachy-2, but with an additional subclass corresponding to each type of manifold that is obtained by adding a subset mixin class.

Well not so many: grep returns only 5 occurences in the whole SageManifolds:
- in `TopologicalManifold._repr_` for returning "Manifold..." instead of "Open subset of manifold..."
- in `DifferentiableManifold._repr_` for the same reason
- in `ManifoldSubset.superset`, because a superset can only be `self` in case of the whole manifold
- in `ManifoldSubset.intersection`, because the intersection with the whole manifold is trivial
- in `ManifoldSubset.union`, because the union with the whole manifold is trivial
 
> 
> Additionally, subsets of a manifold are precisely that, subsets. So we should encapsulate that in separate classes. Mathematically we identity an open subset as a manifold, but by doing so, we loose the information that it is really a subset of another manifold. As such, I feel that having separate classes actually better reflects the mathematics.


Actually, at the moment, we are dealing with the open subsets in exactly the same way as we are doing with the whole manifold, i.e. we set up charts on them, define tensor fields, etc. This can be seen by noticing that in Hierarchy-1, the class `OpenTopSubmanifold` has very few methods in addition to those inherited from `TopologicalManifold`. Similarly, none of the classes `OpenDiffSubmanifold` and `DifferentiableManifold` introduces any attribute or method by itself, in addition to those inherited from `DifferentiableMixin` (except for their `__init__`). 
Maybe, in a future development, one could have operations that make sense only for open subsets or only for the whole manifold. Then having two separate classes is clearly the way to go. However,  at the moment I don't see any such operation, apart from those listed above: the printout (via `_repr_`) and the union/intersection with other subsets.

Five times, as mentioned above. 

> Also what is your thoughts on maintenance and extendability?


It seems to me that, in terms of maintenance, Hierarchy-2 is better, being simpler; it is also certainly better for somebody new entering into the code. 
On the contrary, if one regards extendability, Hierarchy-1 offers the possibility to have different operations for manifolds and subsets, as mentioned above. This is a good point in favor of it. Even if at the moment I don't have in mind any such operation (apart from those listed above), I would slightly tend to maintain Hierarchy-1 because of this.

Yes extra points of view would be helpful! In addition to Nicolas and Darij, I don't know if other people associated to this ticket (Vincent, John, Nils, Jeoren,...) are reading this and have an opinion...

> I could also sit down and plan out how I would do everything from the ground up to see if I can devise a better overall strategy if you think there might be some benefit to that at this stage.


Thanks, but maybe this is not necessary at this stage, especially if we conclude that we maintain Hierarchy-1. Since all this has little impact on the user interface, maybe we could rediscuss it after having a whole view of all the manifold tickets.

Giving a second thought to this, another hierarchy that would preserve the distinction between whole manifolds and open subsets is 

```
Hierarchy-3:

The class `AbstractAmbient` would only implement the methods `union` and `intersection`, which are trivial in this case. Each of the classes `TopologicalManifold`, `DifferentiableManifold` and `OpenInterval` would implement only the method `_repr_`. 

Hierarchy-3 is simpler than Hierarchy-1 and does not require any mixin class. 
It is also easy to add a new structure, like complex manifolds. 
Hierarchy-3 is also mathematically neat, since a topological (resp. differentiable) manifold is obviously a open subset of a topological (resp. differentiable) manifold. In this respect it reverses the logic of Hierarchy-1, where the class `OpenTopSubmanifold` inherits from `TopologicalManifold`, not the opposite.

Here is another proposal, which is a kind of mix between Hierarchy-1 and Hierarchy-3:

```

Hierarchy-4:

 AbstractAmbient           AbstractSet              AbstractSubset
   |  |  |                      |    \              /   |   |   |

   |  |   TopologicalManifold   |     OpenTopSubmanifold    |   |
   |  |                         |                           |   |
   |  |            DifferentiableManifoldOpenSet            |   |
   |   \                  /     |        \                 /    |
   |   DifferentiableManifold   |        OpenDiffSubmanifold    |
   |                            |                               |
   |                     IntervalOpenSet                       /
    \____            ____/            \             __________/
         OpenInterval                OpenSubInterval
              |
          RealLine
```
Contrary to Hierarchy-1, it has no diamond problem and involves no mixin class.
As in Hierarchy-3, the class `AbstractAmbient` implements only the methods `union` and `intersection`, but contrary to Hierarchy-3, the classes for ambient objects (`TopologicalManifold`, `DifferentiableManifold`, etc.) do no longer have the attribute `_manifold`. This attribute is present only in the sub-object classes `OpenTopSubmanifold`, `OpenDiffSubmanifold` and `OpenSubinterval`, as in Hierarchy-1. In Hierarchy-4, the attribute `_manifold` is inherited from `AbstractSubset`. The class `ManifoldSubset` implements generic (not open) subsets of a manifold.
The classes `TopologicalManifold` and `OpenTopSubmanifold` do not implement
any new method by themselves: most methods are implemented in their parent
abstract class `TopologicalManifoldOpenSet`, like `chart()`, `atlas()`,
`scalar_field_algebra()`, etc.
Similarly, methods for differentiable manifolds, like `vector_frame()` or
`tensor_field()`, are implemented in the abstract class `DifferentiableManifoldOpenSet`.

It is what I was hoping to obtain, but had trouble separating out the subset portion because there still is a small diamond problem with `Parent`. Which is why `AbstractSubset` would have to be a mixin, both in this hierarchy and Hierarchy-3,4 to be effective.

It does seem like perhaps Hierarchy-2 would be the best since there is so few tests for `if self._manifold is self`.

> It is what I was hoping to obtain, but had trouble separating out the subset portion because there still is a small diamond problem with `Parent`. Which is why `AbstractSubset` would have to be a mixin, both in this hierarchy and Hierarchy-3,4 to be effective.


Yes. Similarly `AbstractAmbient` in Hierarchy-4 has to be a mixin, so that only `AbstractSet` inheritates from `Parent`.

> 
> It does seem like perhaps Hierarchy-2 would be the best since there is so few tests for `if self._manifold is self`. The biggest trouble I have with this is the separations of concerns: that it makes it somewhat harder to separate these classes later if they start needing different attributes. We also have well-established code in Sage for which there is a different class for subobjects.


As said before, it is difficult to see at the monent what kind of different attributes would exist for manifolds and open submanifolds. Basically, our open submanifolds behave just like manifolds, especially when defining fields on them. This reflects the fact that both are open sets, which is the true basic structure in topology. Things are probably different in other parts of Sage, which deal with algebraic structures, instead of topological ones.

> Ah hell, perhaps we should just revert back to Hierarchy-2 to keep the simplicity. I'm starting to wonder if there is perhaps a more fundamental issue in that we are trying to be too close to the mathematical definitions rather than be programmers, which could potentially be a complete rewrite of most things. However, we have working code, which is always better than no code. 


OK, let us revert to Hierarchy-2. It is simple, effective, offers a better gathering of documentation, and, via `self._manifold = self`, it embodies the fact that a manifold is an open subset of itself, which is not a totally crazy mathematical idea.
Anyway, the whole discussion has been very interesting (at least to me) and we can keep the above diagrams for future thoughts.
>Anyways, I'm going to shutup now and just ask do you want me to handle the revert or are you willing to do it?

I will do it. Of course, it will not be a complete revert to the state prior to your refactorization: we shall keep your singleton classes for the structure (topological, differentiable, etc.) and your removal of facade parents, which are nice features.

I think there is still the opportunity to implement another hierarchy latter, if we feel that specificities for subsets are required. Also, if we do this latter, when more tickets of #18528 are merged, this would alleviate the propagation of the changes to other tickets and one would notice at once possible side effects.

> Anyways, now it is back to going over the documentation and technicalities of the code. I hope to finish this review in a couple of days.

I've propagated the latest changes in this ticket to all tickets of #18528. Everything is OK. In particular, the new singleton classes for manifold structures have allowed to simplify the code, avoiding to redefine the methods `chart` and `scalar_field_algebra` in the class `DifferentiableManifold`.

Thanks a lot for all your changes.

> I have two comments left:
> 
> - In `Chart.set_inverse`, there is a keyword `check` that I changed to `verbose` because there was no check being done.


Yes, `verbose` seems more appropriate.

> Irregardless, I don't quite like that the default is to print things to the terminal. Is there a specific reason for this? 


No. 
>I feel like the default should be `False`.


I've set it to `False` in the above commit.
> - In `ManifoldPoint`, the methods `set_coord` should be the full `set_coordinates` (and similar methods). The short version can be an alias. (Same discussion as for `disp` vs `display`.).

I've performed the change in the above commit, adding aliases for short versions of `coordinates`, `add_coordinates` and `set_coordinates`. I've also corrected one or two typos.
