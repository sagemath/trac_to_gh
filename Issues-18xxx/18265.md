This ticket defines the usual Green axioms for semigroups, and provides stubs for the corresponding categories:

```
sage: Semigroups().LTrivial()
Category of ltrivial semigroups
sage: Semigroups().LTrivial().RTrivial()
Category of jtrivial semigroups
sage: Semigroups().HTrivial().Finite()
Category of finite aperiodic semigroups
sage: Semigroups().Commutative().RTrivial()
Category of commutative jtrivial semigroups
```

This is a first step toward #18001.

Hi Travis,

Thanks for the review.

Replying to [@tscrim](#comment%3A13):
> - Do we want these to be axioms since these properties for subcategories do not make as much sense (e.g., for groups, L-trivial = R-trivial = J-trivial = category consisting only of the trivial group, correct?)

We want them to be axioms to interact nicely with each other: there
will be many interesting combinations between the Finite / X-trivial /
Unital axioms (and more will come, like Regular, ...). In fact
implementing those was one of my original motivation for implementing
axioms in Sage :-)

Indeed `Groups().XTrivial()` is, well, trivial, so that's boring.  But
this is only polluting the namespace of the Groups() category, not the
groups themselves, so that's a minimal annoyance.

> - Typo "preoder".

Thanks for catching. Fixed!

> - Do we want to spend some time trying to beautiful axiom printing
> (i.e., "J-trivial" instead of "jtrivial")?

This would be cute, indeed. I'll have a quick look if it's trivial to
do. Otherwise, we can leave it for later; that will be easy to change
anyway.

> - I would like to see the defining properties to the category level
>   documentation, not only in the subcategory methods.

I agree that documentation at the category level would be highly
desirable. But I don't want to duplicate manually the documentation.
That's a general problem that requires a general solution by having a
nice automatically generated default documentation for categories with
axioms. See also the related:

   http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16363

In the mean time the subcategory methods are the most appropriate
location for the doc, since this makes it accessible for all
subcategories by `XXX.Jtrivial?`

I think we should also add that an inverse H-trivial monoids implies J-trivial.

Considering there is exactly 1 X-trivial group (up to isomorphism), there won't be any additional pollution from `Parent/ElementMethods` either. So I agree, minimal annoyance.

Yes, but only when we will have the "inverse" axiom in the sense of
local inverses in semigroups. Our current Inverse axiom is about
having a global inverse (it's indeed annoying that we have this naming
conflict, but there is nothing much we can do about it).

Of course an R-trivial monoid with a global inverse is J/H trivial,
but that's not super interesting :-)

I made a quick fix, so that JTrivial is displayed as j trivial and not
jtrivial; it only slightly better, but requires no special casing and
makes for a more consistent implementation of uncamelcasing.

It's been discussed several times that axioms like AdditiveAssociative
would be better displayed as `additive-associative`, to raise
ambiguities in expressions such as:

```
    Category of associative additive commutative additive associative additive unital distributive magmas and additive magmas
```

This would make the `j trivial` into `j-trivial` as a by-product
without any special casing. However this is a relatively invasive
change (it will require updating a bunch of doctests"), so I vote for
doing this in a separate ticket.

Do you agree that this is good enough for now?

I'm somewhat leaning towards having the implication for the global inverse, but considering the category of X-trivial groups is, well, trivial, I don't feel strongly about this. So if you don't feel like doing it, then you can set this to a positive review.

Yes, I believe this should be on a separate ticket.
