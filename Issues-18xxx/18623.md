```
Calling a PARI closure with variadic arguments is not possible:

```
sage: f = pari("(v[..])->length(v)")  # returns the number of its arguments
sage: f()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: PARI closure takes at most -9223372036854775807 arguments (0 given)
```
This is because variadic PARI closures are not recognised by Sage and have a somewhat different calling convention.

We also remove a check for the arity of a closure, since this is handled by PARI since recent versions.
