Solve some strange behaviors / bugs in minimum spanning tree routines.

Usually, if the graph is weighted, the weight is ignored, and the `weight_function` argument is used. If this argument is not provided, the (rather counterintuitive) behavior is to set all weights to 1 (so that any spanning tree can be outputted). However, if Kruskal algorithm is used, and `check` is set to `True`, then edge weights are used, instead.

```
sage: g = Graph(weighted=True)
sage: g.add_edges([[0,1,1],[1,2,1],[2,0,10]])
sage: g.min_spanning_tree(algorithm='Kruskal')
[(0, 1, 1), (0, 2, 10)]
sage: g.min_spanning_tree(algorithm='Prim_fringe')
[(0, 1), (0, 2)]
sage: g.min_spanning_tree(algorithm='Prim_edge')
[(0, 1, 1), (0, 2, 10)]
sage: sage: g.min_spanning_tree(algorithm='Kruskal', check=True)
[(0, 1, 1), (1, 2, 1)]

```
This example also shows that the outputs are different.

Moreover, NetworkX algorithm does not work:

```
sage: g.min_spanning_tree(algorithm='NetworkX')
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-27-b461ae20ba97> in <module>()
----> 1 g.min_spanning_tree(algorithm='NetworkX')

/home/michele/Programmi/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/graphs/generic_graph.pyc in min_spanning_tree(self, weight_function, algorithm, starting_vertex, check)
   3433             import networkx
   3434             G = networkx.Graph([(u, v, dict(weight=weight_function((u, v)))) for u, v, l in self.edge_iterator()])
-> 3435             return list(networkx.mst(G))
   3436         else:
   3437             raise NotImplementedError("Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm '%s' is not implemented." % algorithm)

TypeError: 'module' object is not callable

```
This ticket will change this behavior, by defining a specific order in the choice of weights:

* if the function weight_function is provided, it is used as default;
* if the function weight_function is None (default) and the graph is weighted, the edge weights are used;
* otherwise, all weights are set to 1.

Moreover, it will fix NetworkX problems, and it will standardize the output. 

Finally, it will modify Kruskal algorithm as follows:

* now, the input can only be an undirected graph, so that the behavior is much more clear, and the documentation becomes much smaller;
* we moved the code to remove self-loops and multiple edges in a separate routine, because it will be used by Boost.

This is a first step before the inclusion of Boost minimum spanning tree algorithms.

Hello!

I just realized I need some more modifications on the code to deal with multiple edges, before implementing the Boost version. I will submit the new version as soon as possible!

Hello!

I have made two more changes to the Kruskal algorithm, specified in the description:

* now, the input can only be an undirected graph, so that the  behavior is much more clear, and the documentation becomes much smaller;
* we moved the code to remove self-loops and multiple edges in a separate routine, because it will be used by Boost.

Sorry for the "late" decision, but I realized this was better only after I submitted the previous code.

Michele

You are right: I removed the method, and I call the `to_simple` routine.

I have improved `to_simple` and `allow_multiple_edges`: the user can choose if the graph is converted to an undirected graph, and which label should be kept (the minimum, the maximum, or any label).
