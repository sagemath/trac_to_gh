This branch adds some more general documentation about graph data structures.

Let it be said that I am not setting in stone what we currently do, but rather trying to make it clear so that we can change whatever needs to be `:-P`

Just commenting...

In `src/sage/graphs/base/overview.py`, you mention digraphs, but you seem to say nothing about them.

"Supports: addition/removal of edges/vertices available": remove the "available"?

"ligther" should be "lighter".

There is yet another distinction that is often left implicit but needs to be clarified here: In a graph, the edges can be either just predicates saying that "vertex `a` is connected to vertex `b`, (possibly) with edge label `l`", or they can be mathematical objects on their own rights.

Hello,

> In `src/sage/graphs/base/overview.py`, you mention digraphs, but you seem to say nothing about them.

I always talk about both. From time to time I said "graph and digraph", but if I need to be politically correct and do not make one side feel like (s)he is neglected I added "(di)graph" everywhere.

> "Supports: addition/removal of edges/vertices available": remove the "available"?

Right, done. I hesitated between different versions of this text, and this was a leftover.

> "ligther" should be "lighter".

Done.

> There is yet another distinction that is often left implicit but needs to be clarified here

Well, it's not really related to the data structure

> In a graph, the edges can be either just predicates saying that "vertex `a` is connected to vertex `b`, (possibly) with edge label `l`", or they can be mathematical objects on their own rights. The difference is most obvious when you have two edges with the same label both from a vertex `a` to a vertex `b`. Are these two edges equal or not?

There is no "edge" object in Sage. So asking whether they are equal is almost philosophy `:-)`

The label of an edge, however, can be any data that you like. So if you need edges to be more complicated objects, you can store it there.

> A doc should make clear which of them is supported by which class.

Edge labels are "not very compatible" with a dense data structure, and for those it is claimed that edge labels are not supported. For sparse graphs arbitrary edge labels are supported.

Thanks for the edits!

I think you should write "(di)graph", because for many people (such as myself), digraphs are not graphs.

As for the lack of edge identity, this is a perfectly fine choice, but should be documented. I don't know where, though -- I am a stranger to Sage's decision decisions concerning where to document things...

Hmmm.. Well, I'm used to document a feature or a corner-case, but it's my first time trying to document something which is not there. And if there was some place to do that, it is very unlikely that it would also be found by whoever is interested. In `GenericGraph.edges` perhaps?

But (please) in another ticket. In this one I hoped to present a clear view of the graph classes/backends and the data structures behind, so that we can start working on them seriously.

Just say that edges in a multigraph are stored as elements of multisets, so if there are two edges from `a` to `b` in an unlabelled (di)multigraph, then they will be implemented not as two separate objects but as one object appearing twice in a multiset of edges. Say that this is not the convention used in quiver theory, and that the latter can be simulated using labelled (di)graphs.

In this file, despite being about data structures, you will notice that I do not explain how exactly the data is stored, as this documentation belong to each individual module implementing a data structure. Moreover, to me your explanation of what is an edge in Sage belongs to some documentation explaining the *usage* or graphs, while this one is about their implementation. This precision does not belong here.

To convince you, notice that there is a class of Quivers in Sage, which I suspect is based on Sage's graphs: you can do whatever you like with respect to `Edge` objects, by storing them as labels.

If you want to discuss this issue further let us please do it on another ticket or by email. This branch is about describing the class diagram and the performances of Sage's graph backends.

It is part of the definition of a graph. I have no idea where it belongs, really... I would normally say "into the docstring of the `Graph` constructor", but hell knows where people will actually look.

in graph.py, and digraph.py, the backlink is indented too much (remove one space) as follows:

```
  :mod:`~sage.graphs.base.overview`):
```


in graph_backends.py, in the line

```
:meth:`~GenericGraphBackend.degree` | Returns the total number of vertices incident to v.
```
replace `Returns` by `Return` and v by <code>\`v\`</code>

Same with Deletes and another Returns a few line below.

Once done, you can set to positive review.
