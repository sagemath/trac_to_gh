This branch adds some more general documentation about graph data structures.

Let it be said that I am not setting in stone what we currently do, but rather trying to make it clear so that we can change whatever needs to be `:-P`

Just commenting...

In `src/sage/graphs/base/overview.py`, you mention digraphs, but you seem to say nothing about them.

"Supports: addition/removal of edges/vertices available": remove the "available"?

"ligther" should be "lighter".

There is yet another distinction that is often left implicit but needs to be clarified here: In a graph, the edges can be either just predicates saying that "vertex `a` is connected to vertex `b`, (possibly) with edge label `l`", or they can be mathematical objects on their own rights.

Hello,

> In `src/sage/graphs/base/overview.py`, you mention digraphs, but you seem to say nothing about them.


I always talk about both. From time to time I said "graph and digraph", but if I need to be politically correct and do not make one side feel like (s)he is neglected I added "(di)graph" everywhere.

> "Supports: addition/removal of edges/vertices available": remove the "available"?


Right, done. I hesitated between different versions of this text, and this was a leftover.

> "ligther" should be "lighter".


Done.

> There is yet another distinction that is often left implicit but needs to be clarified here


Well, it's not really related to the data structure

> In a graph, the edges can be either just predicates saying that "vertex `a` is connected to vertex `b`, (possibly) with edge label `l`", or they can be mathematical objects on their own rights. The difference is most obvious when you have two edges with the same label both from a vertex `a` to a vertex `b`. Are these two edges equal or not?


There is no "edge" object in Sage. So asking whether they are equal is almost philosophy `:-)`

The label of an edge, however, can be any data that you like. So if you need edges to be more complicated objects, you can store it there.

> A doc should make clear which of them is supported by which class.


Edge labels are "not very compatible" with a dense data structure, and for those it is claimed that edge labels are not supported. For sparse graphs arbitrary edge labels are supported.

Thanks for the edits!

I think you should write "(di)graph", because for many people (such as myself), digraphs are not graphs.

As for the lack of edge identity, this is a perfectly fine choice, but should be documented. I don't know where, though -- I am a stranger to Sage's decision decisions concerning where to document things...

Hmmm.. Well, I'm used to document a feature or a corner-case, but it's my first time trying to document something which is not there. And if there was some place to do that, it is very unlikely that it would also be found by whoever is interested. In `GenericGraph.edges` perhaps?

It is part of the definition of a graph. I have no idea where it belongs, really... I would normally say "into the docstring of the `Graph` constructor", but hell knows where people will actually look.

in graph.py, and digraph.py, the backlink is indented too much (remove one space) as follows:

```
  :mod:`~sage.graphs.base.overview`):
```


in graph_backends.py, in the line

```
:meth:`~GenericGraphBackend.degree` | Returns the total number of vertices incident to v.
```
replace `Returns` by `Return` and v by <code>\`v\`</code>

Same with Deletes and another Returns a few line below.

Once done, you can set to positive review.
