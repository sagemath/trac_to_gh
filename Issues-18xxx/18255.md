`brun` fails horribly:

```
sage: brun.n()
NotImplementedError: brun is only available up to 41 bits
sage: brun?
NotImplementedError: brun is only available up to 41 bits
sage: brun??
NotImplementedError: brun is only available up to 41 bits
```
and this leads to sporadic failure of `random_expr`, falsifying patchbot test results.
