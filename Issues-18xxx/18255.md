`brun` fails horribly:

```
sage: brun.n()
NotImplementedError: brun is only available up to 41 bits
sage: brun?
NotImplementedError: brun is only available up to 41 bits
sage: brun??
NotImplementedError: brun is only available up to 41 bits
```
and this leads to sporadic failure of `random_expr`, falsifying patchbot test results.

So we add `brun = whatever` in `all.py` and get bug reports when a new decimal place is discovered?

Interesting!  (Do you have a reference?  I can only find references to estimates using twin primes < 10 to the something.)

Are there any (other?) constants known to some number of bits only of potential interest?  I bet there are, but maybe it's not worth keeping the class around for that.
