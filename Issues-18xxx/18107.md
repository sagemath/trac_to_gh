The Sage developer's guide insists that the directories in `build/pkgs` should be all lowercase. At the same time, we have started allowing tarballs in `upstream` which have mixed case (e.g., Pillow and Sphinx). The script `sage-fix-pkg-checksums` should allow for this, converting the tarball name to lowercase before looking for the corresponding directory.


Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18344

Since we want to support OS X, we cannot allow different files whose names are the same except for case differences. So I hope this change is safe.

While your patch apparently fixes the issue *with uppercase letters* in upstream tarballs (haven't tested it yet though), I don't like the concept of the script, which is pretty upside-down:  Instead of iterating over `build/pkgs/*` and taking the name of the upstream tarball from there, it does the opposite.

I'd rather have

  `sage-pkg-checksums [--verbose] [--create|--check|--update] [<package name>]*`

with useful information about missing upstream tarballs, checksum mismatches etc., but that's presumably beyond this ticket.

(And we have a wild mixture of `tr`, `sed`, `shopt -s nocaseglob`, and shell parameter expansion in various shell scripts...  The Python script `sage-pkg` also seems to be obsolete or at least not yet suited for "new style" spkgs.)

P.S.:  How am I supposed to call that script btw.?  It relies on `SAGE_ROOT` being set, and doesn't even check whether that's the case.

`./sage -fix-pkg-checksums` doesn't work (and isn't documented), so one has to enter a Sage subshell or, as I did, for example run

```sh
SAGE_ROOT=. src/bin/sage-fix-pkg-checksums
```

`./sage --sh -c sage-fix-pkg-checksums` isn't less cryptic or tedious either.

The developer's guide says to do

```
$ sage -sh sage-fix-pkg-checksums
```
Anyway, feel free to open another ticket with general cleanup of the script.

It's a note.

(On partially case-insensitive filesystems, using uppercase letters in tarball names might be unintentional, I think.  It's not an error though, since we can deal with such.  But we IMHO shouldn't randomly change case upon upgrades.)

One point behind the note is to somehow warn people that because of OS X, we can't have packages whose names depend on case. So at least this way they see that "Pillow.tar.gz" is associated with the directory "pillow". Maybe if someone tries to create a package "GAP", in addition to the "gap" package, rather than have things perhaps mysteriously break during building, a message like this will pop up earlier letting them know something is going on.

Do I need to explain that, presumably, someone developing a new package for Sage will try to build Sage with that package? That was the context for my comment: I want to provide some feedback when they are still developing the package (and therefore running `sage-fix-pkg-checksums`), before they even get to the building/testing stage. And there may be developers who never use OS X and are unaware of how it treats case.
