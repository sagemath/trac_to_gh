Currently, most coding theory-related stuff is hidden behind `codes.<tab>`. But it is done in a way which does not allow writing 

```
   from codes import *
```

whenever you're working a lot with coding theory.
Instead, one has to do

```
   from sage.coding.codes_catalog import *
```

This could be mentioned in the doc of `codes`.

Helloooooo Johan,

This looks good to go, except for a couple of things:
- Could you remove the commented line `#import codes_catalog as
  codes`?
- There is a doubly commented line `# # Make codes available
  as "from codes import *"`
- The comment in `codes_catalog` explain 'how' `all.py` makes the
  `from codes import *` syntax available, and I feel that it is
  not the right place to do that. It is not very important
  though, just a remark.

Nathann

Yooooooooooooo !

The code looks good -> positive review.

About your branch: as you can see there are 5 commits, most of which undo what the others add. There is a very useful command in git which is 'git rebase -i': it lets you 'merge' several commits into one.

You may also find `git commit --amend` useful.

No problem for this branch: let's get it in as it is. I only give those links as they did prove helpful in my own experience to make easier-to-read branches (even a posteriori, i.e. after all code has been written).

Cheers,

Nathann

Hi Volker,

I fixed the bug you found.

Regarding your other comment, I would recommend that user to import his `codes` module from a sub-module, like `import mystuff.codes as mycodes`.  Sage injects loads of functions into the global namespace. Injecting modules as well is a natural next-step, in my opinion, once the global number of functions is high enough. That requires, as you point out, in certain circumstances a very slight annoyance on the side of users having their own modules.

I don't think a good solution is to keep `codes`, and other "collections of
semi-global functions", as objects, thereby missing out on module functionality.

Note that module imports can not be shadowed by variables:

```
$ sage -python
>>> sage = 1
>>> from sage.all import sin
>>> type(sin)
<class 'sage.functions.trig.Function_sin'>
```
So its perfectly fine to have an object bound to a variable named `codes` but its bad to have a module `codes` (without namespace), and it would be a terrible design pattern to litter the module names space with all kinds of object catalogs.

Just make your own `sage.coding.codes` module from which to import your selection of codes.

I don't think I fully see why littering the global variable namespace is fine, but littering the module namespace is bad.

But I also don't care enough about this to discuss it at length. I've rolled back the changes and instead inserted a note in the doc of `codes` on how to import it.

Global variables in the repl are a tradeoff. Sure, globals are usually bad (which is why you have to explicitly import things in the Sage library code). But then its the commandline, so we want to have a useful set of defaults. The important fact is: you can always overwrite stuff in the global **variable** namespace with stuff from your preferred module and everything works:

```
$ python
>>> list = 123      # why not
>>> list([1,2])     # of course that doesn't work then any more
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: 'int' object is not callable

>>> from __builtin__ import list    # get the old list back
>>> list([1,2])
[1, 2]
```
