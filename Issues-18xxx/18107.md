Currently, most coding theory-related stuff is hidden behind `codes.<tab>`. But it is done in a way which does not allow writing 

```
   from codes import *
```

whenever you're working a lot with coding theory.
Instead, one has to do

```
   from sage.coding.codes_catalog import *
```

This could be mentioned in the doc of `codes`.

Helloooooo Johan,

This looks good to go, except for a couple of things:
- Could you remove the commented line `#import codes_catalog as
  codes`?
- There is a doubly commented line `# # Make codes available
  as "from codes import *"`
- The comment in `codes_catalog` explain 'how' `all.py` makes the
  `from codes import *` syntax available, and I feel that it is
  not the right place to do that. It is not very important
  though, just a remark.

Nathann

Yooooooooooooo !

The code looks good -> positive review.

About your branch: as you can see there are 5 commits, most of which undo what the others add. There is a very useful command in git which is 'git rebase -i': it lets you 'merge' several commits into one.

https://robots.thoughtbot.com/git-interactive-rebase-squash-amend-rewriting-history

You may also find `git commit --amend` useful.

No problem for this branch: let's get it in as it is. I only give those links as they did prove helpful in my own experience to make easier-to-read branches (even a posteriori, i.e. after all code has been written).

Cheers,

Nathann

    "body": "<a id='comment:14'></a>\nOk, thanks for the tips Nathann. I didn't really know how the community felt about rewriting history. If I do a rebase after pushing to the public branch (which was the case here), I run the risk (afaik) of breaking other people's synchronisation to the branch (i.e. you). That could cause some annoyances. Before doing any public pushes, it can make complete sense to clean up history, as you say. I use \"--amend\" all the time ;-) (through magit in Emacs btw).",

Ok, thanks for the tips Nathann. I didn't really know how the community felt about rewriting history.

Hi Volker,

I fixed the bug you found.

Regarding your other comment, I would recommend that user to import his `codes` module from a sub-module, like `import mystuff.codes as mycodes`.  Sage injects loads of functions into the global namespace. Injecting modules as well is a natural next-step, in my opinion, once the global number of functions is high enough. That requires, as you point out, in certain circumstances a very slight annoyance on the side of users having their own modules.

I don't think a good solution is to keep `codes`, and other "collections of
semi-global functions", as objects, thereby missing out on module functionality.

Note that module imports can not be shadowed by variables:

```
$ sage -python
>>> sage = 1
>>> from sage.all import sin
>>> type(sin)
<class 'sage.functions.trig.Function_sin'>
```
So its perfectly fine to have an object bound to a variable named `codes` but its bad to have a module `codes` (without namespace), and it would be a terrible design pattern to litter the module names space with all kinds of object catalogs.

Just make your own `sage.coding.codes` module from which to import your selection of codes.

Global variables in the repl are a tradeoff. Sure, globals are usually bad (which is why you have to explicitly import things in the Sage library code). But then its the commandline, so we want to have a useful set of defaults. The important fact is: you can always overwrite stuff in the global **variable** namespace with stuff from your preferred module and everything works:

```
$ python
>>> list = 123      # why not
>>> list([1,2])     # of course that doesn't work then any more
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: 'int' object is not callable

>>> from __builtin__ import list    # get the old list back
>>> list([1,2])
[1, 2]
```
