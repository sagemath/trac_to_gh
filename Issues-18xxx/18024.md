This branch refactors `Tableau` and `SkewTableau` to derive from `ClonableList` instead of `CombinatorialObject`. While we do not currently use the cloning context-manager provided by `ClonableList`, this refactoring still has the advantage of moving to a more modern paradigm and simplifying the changes in #18013. A number of cleanup and optimization changes are also done here. (The methods deleted from `ribbon_tableau.py` and `ribbon_shape_tableau.py` are slow implementations of methods that are implemented in a better way on a superclass in `skew_tableau`. No functionality is lost.)

The speed changes range from significant speedups to minor slowdowns, the latter being mainly on methods (such as Tableau's `restrict`) which ducktype the result as follows:

```
        # attempt to return a tableau of the same type
        try:
            return self.parent()( res )
        except Exception:
            try:
                return self.parent().Element( res )
            except Exception:
                return Tableau(res)
```

Two unpickling doctests are broken: one in ribbon_tableau.py, and one in ribbon_shape_tableau.py. One of them makes no sense to me, but the other might be worth salvaging.

<a id='comment:12'></a>Hello,

I just opened the branch to see what it does (I do not understand anything of the math involved here) and I noticed this change:

```
-                if not (i is None):
+                if i > 0 and not (i is None):
```

If `i` can be equal to `None`, you should probably write `not (i is None) and i > 0` instead (i.e. reverse the conditions).

-Jan Keitel's work. Depends on #15862 but probably needs to be merged with its current state.
+This branch refactors `Tableau` and `SkewTableau` to derive from `ClonableList` instead of `CombinatorialObject`. While we do not currently use the cloning context-manager provided by `ClonableList`, this refactoring still has the advantage of moving to a more modern paradigm and simplifying the changes in #18013. A number of cleanup and optimization changes are also done here. (The methods deleted from `ribbon_tableau.py` and `ribbon_shape_tableau.py` are slow implementations of methods that are implemented in a better way on a superclass in `skew_tableau`. No functionality is lost.)
 
-Keywords: permutation,
+The speed changes range from significant speedups to minor slowdowns, the latter being mainly on methods (such as Tableau's `restrict`) which ducktype the result as follows:
+
+```
+        # attempt to return a tableau of the same type
+        try:
+            return self.parent()( res )
+        except Exception:
+            try:
+                return self.parent().Element( res )
+            except Exception:
+                return Tableau(res)
+```
+
+Two unpickling doctests are broken: one in ribbon_tableau.py, and one in ribbon_shape_tableau.py. One of them makes no sense to me, but the other might be worth salvaging.
