Keywords: tableaux, sage-combinat, mutability, ClonableList, days64, sd67

This branch refactors `Tableau` and `SkewTableau` to derive from `ClonableList` instead of `CombinatorialObject`. While we do not currently use the cloning context-manager provided by `ClonableList`, this refactoring still has the advantage of moving to a more modern paradigm and simplifying the changes in #18013. A number of cleanup and optimization changes are also done here. (The methods deleted from `ribbon_tableau.py` and `ribbon_shape_tableau.py` are slow implementations of methods that are implemented in a better way on a superclass in `skew_tableau`. No functionality is lost.)

The speed changes range from significant speedups to minor slowdowns, the latter being mainly on methods (such as Tableau's `restrict`) which ducktype the result as follows:

```
        # attempt to return a tableau of the same type
        try:
            return self.parent()( res )
        except Exception:
            try:
                return self.parent().Element( res )
            except Exception:
                return Tableau(res)
```

Two unpickling doctests are broken: one in ribbon_tableau.py, and one in ribbon_shape_tableau.py. One of them makes no sense to me, but the other might be worth salvaging.

Hello,

I just opened the branch to see what it does (I do not understand anything of the math involved here) and I noticed this change:

```
-                if not (i is None):
+                if i > 0 and not (i is None):
```

If `i` can be equal to `None`, you should probably write `not (i is None) and i > 0` instead (i.e. reverse the conditions).

Nathann

Made a few minor reviewer changes, so as soon as someone signs off on those we can call this good.

After looking into the old pickles issue, I decided to just remove them for the following reasons.
1. We had already removed a couple of old pickle tests and none of the contributors on this ticket had yet complained.
2. Frankly, I haven't found anyone who seems to really care about old pickles breaking, except for some old posts by William Stein. The most relevant sage-devel thread I found was [this one](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/sage-devel/pickles/sage-devel/KjnxIXO-xnE/YvTX9PV7LAsJ), where an old k-Schur class had been deprecated though it had some old pickles in the pickle jar, and efforts to override proved unsuccessful.

3.

I also haven't found evidence of many users complaining about old pickles breaking.
4. The k-Schur sage-devel thread I linked above makes it seem that a large amount of time and effort was wasted on that particular issue. Even if maintaining backwards compatibility of old pickles is a worthwhile goal, I'm not at all convinced it's worth stealing development time.

If others care about these pickle issues, please let me know!

Thank you! The patch looks good to me as far as I can tell (I don't personally use pickles).

Can you take a quick look at my latest changes? Your setstate made me realize that there was an ugly hack in ribbon_shaped_tableau.py, which looked easy enough to get rid of.
