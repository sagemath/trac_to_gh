The maple command does contain some options. Our pexpect interface does not work when this is used through ssh. The command used to launch maple through a ssh tunnel by pexpect is

```
$ sage-native-execute ssh -t REMOTE \
 maple -t -c "interface(screenwidth=infinity,errorcursor=false)"
```
But this does not work because the double quotes get removed **before** sending the command to the remote server.

Using instead

```
$ sage-native-execute ssh -t REMOTE \
 'maple -t -c "interface(screenwidth=infinity,errorcursor=false)"'
```
works as a charm.

We modify `sage/interfaces/expect.py` by adding single quotes to guard the command when an intermediate server is involved.

Yep, `expect.py` is to fix, not `maple.py`.  (Otherwise a local `maple` would no longer work.)

The problem when using ssh (or likewise, `sh -c ...`) is that the parameters get interpreted twice; once by the local shell, and a second time by the remote (or sub-) shell.

The local one removes the double quotes, passing literally `maple -t -c  interface(screenwidth=infinity,errorcursor=false)` to the remote shell, which gives a syntax error since the parentheses are no longer quoted nor escaped to avoid interpretation.

```sh
sh -c 'maple -t -c interface(screenwidth=infinity,errorcursor=false)'
```
would give exactly the same error, while

```sh
sh -c 'maple -t -c interface\(screenwidth=infinity,errorcursor=false\)'
```
would work.

(So it does *not* depend on the computer, unless the remote shell were some strange non-standard one not treating the parentheses as special characters...)

Hi Leif,

Thanks for your clarification!

I added simple quotes to both cases when ssh is involved (with or without `ulimit`). I also added the option `ulimit` to our maple interface. Both works for me (even with a gate in between).
