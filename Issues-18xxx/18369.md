I have tried explicitly putting --with-boost=no on the command line but that does not work either, though I do not know why.

Thanks for testing.

<a id='comment:6'></a>It seems that every piece of boost has its own independent(?) `--with` flag:

```
  --with-boost[=ARG]      use Boost library from a standard location
                          (ARG=yes), from the specified location (ARG=<path>),
                          or disable it (ARG=no) [ARG=yes]
  --with-boost-libdir=LIB_DIR
                          Force given directory for boost libraries. Note that
                          this will override library path detection, so use
                          this parameter only if default library detection
                          fails and you know exactly where your boost
                          libraries are located.
  --with-boost-system[=special-lib]
                          use the System library from boost - it is possible
                          to specify a certain library for the linker e.g.
                          --with-boost-system=boost_system-gcc-mt
  --with-boost-asio[=special-lib]
                          use the ASIO library from boost - it is possible to
                          specify a certain library for the linker e.g.
                          --with-boost-asio=boost_system-gcc41-mt-1_34
  --with-boost-thread[=special-lib]
                          use the Thread library from boost - it is possible
                          to specify a certain library for the linker e.g.
                          --with-boost-thread=boost_thread-gcc-mt

<a id='comment:14'></a>Please try this.  Note that the upstream source is now 20150510 instead of 20150423.  The only change is in the boost detection where I use Jeroen's suggested change.  In the Sage commit I updated the package version and checksum and added a line to the install script saying --with-boost="no".  It works for me...
