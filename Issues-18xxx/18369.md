Frederic, I have had real trouble with the boost configuration since I upgraded the version of the libtool boost config scripts.  I thought I had solved it, but apparently not (except on my machine).  Any chance you could help me diagnose and fix that?  It is suppose to be that if you do not put --with-boost (or --with-boost=<path>) on the configure line, that no boost is used, but now it defaults the other way and whether or not it passes depends on the locally installed boost.  (boost is only needed for running with a multithreaded, i.e. parallel, option, which I do not think is appropriate for Sage).

I have tried explicitly putting --with-boost=no on the command line but that does not work either, though I do not know why.

Thanks for testing.

It seems that every piece of boost has its own independent(?) `--with` flag:

```
  --with-boost[=ARG]      use Boost library from a standard location
                          (ARG=yes), from the specified location (ARG=<path>),
                          or disable it (ARG=no) [ARG=yes]
  --with-boost-libdir=LIB_DIR
                          Force given directory for boost libraries. Note that
                          this will override library path detection, so use
                          this parameter only if default library detection
                          fails and you know exactly where your boost
                          libraries are located.
  --with-boost-system[=special-lib]
                          use the System library from boost - it is possible
                          to specify a certain library for the linker e.g.
                          --with-boost-system=boost_system-gcc-mt
  --with-boost-asio[=special-lib]
                          use the ASIO library from boost - it is possible to
                          specify a certain library for the linker e.g.
                          --with-boost-asio=boost_system-gcc41-mt-1_34
  --with-boost-thread[=special-lib]
                          use the Thread library from boost - it is possible
                          to specify a certain library for the linker e.g.
                          --with-boost-thread=boost_thread-gcc-mt

Jeroen's solution sounds good. I am guessing the reason you are seeing this now is because the detection default has changed. All those `--with-xxx` switch usually comes with a default state and now it is set to yes. For example in https://github.com/JohnCremona/eclib/blob/master/m4/ax_boost_system.m4 at line 53 you have

```

this means that if you don't pass anything it will assume you want it. If you want the old behaviour of "not on" unless I say so, you want to change that line to

```
