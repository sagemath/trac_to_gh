Hey Peter and Dinakar,

It would be great if one or both of you would add some general documentation (in particular, a description of the model/crystal structure) and check that my changes are good with you. Also, if you could implement type G<sub>2</sub>, that would be appreciated; otherwise, we can set that to raise a `NotImplementedError` for the time being. That way we can get this merged into Sage.

Thanks,
Travis

Hi all,

I have some questions about this code.  

- I think that `.star()` is misbehaving.  Here is some evidence.  Consider 

```
sage: MV = crystals.infinity.MVPolytopes("A2")
sage: p0 = MV.module_generators[0]
sage: p = p0.f_string([1,2,1,2,2]); p
MV polytope with Lusztig datum (0, 2, 1)
sage: p.star()
MV polytope with Lusztig datum (1, 2, 0)
```
   However, when I compute by hand (using the PBW rule from Kamnitzer's paper (based on the work of Lusztig and Berenstein-Zelevinsky)), I believe the resulting data should actually be `(2,0,3)`.  Using the PBW crystal code:

```
sage: B = crystals.infinity.PBW("A2")
sage: b0 = B.module_generators[0]
sage: b = b0.f_string([1,2,1,2,2]); b
PBW monomial with Lusztig datum (0, 2, 1)
sage: b.lusztig_datum(word=[2,1,2])
(3, 0, 2)
```
   The reversal of the last output should correspond to `p.star()`.  Moreover, when I check against some previously implemented *-crystal code, it also agrees with my calculation by hand:

```
sage: MVs = crystals.infinity.Star(MV)
sage: ps = MVs.module_generators[0].f_string([1,2,1,2,2])
sage: ps
MV polytope with Lusztig datum (2, 0, 3)

sage: Bs = crystals.infinity.Star(B)
sage: bs = Bs.module_generators[0].f_string([1,2,1,2,2])
sage: bs
PBW monomial with Lusztig datum (2, 0, 3)
```
  Maybe I am misunderstanding how the *-operator is supposed to act?

- Perhaps `braid_move_calculator.py` should go with the Coxeter group code.  I believe it is more robust than simply crystals code, and Coxeter group users may also find it beneficial.  

- Is it possible initialize an MV polytope without applying a string of crystal operators from the highest weight?  If so, tests should be added that show this behavior.  If not, then it may be desirable to users if one could initialize an MV polytope using polytope vertices or from a Lusztig datum.

- Less important, but maybe it may be a good idea to group `pbw_crystal.py` and `pbw_datum.py` into a single file.  They are closely related, so having less files in the crystals folder may be a good idea.  I do not feel very strongly about this, but it is something that came up.  

Thanks for working on this!!  This patch will be a spectacular addition to Sage when it is completed!

Travis wrote the code for this function in root_lattice_realizations.py,
so I want to double-check with him before changing the tests. Let me comment on the two failed tests.

This error is because the tropical Plucker relations for B2 and C2 were incorrectly switched before. I've fixed this, and the test should be changed.

I don't know what should be the correct behavior here. When I try to run each of these tests in the repl by hand it complains that I don't have jmol installed. What is the doctest doing differently?

This doctest would normally try to open JMol, but in order to avoid this, in doctest mode (i.e., running `sage -t filename.py`) we just print out `Graphics3d Object`. It is a straightforward change.

Thank you Dinakar for adding the G<sub>2</sub> case. I plan to look at it in detail and take care of Ben's comments. Modulo Ben's comments, this should be ready for review, correct?

You've (re)introduced a mixup between type B<sub>n</sub> and C<sub>n</sub> with [a81b213](https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit/?id=a81b2134f04acc6abcccf49284be7c5c1f6d3be3):

sage: G = crystals.infinity.PBW(['B',3]).subcrystal(max_depth=7).digraph()
sage: Gp = crystals.infinity.Tableaux(['C',3]).subcrystal(max_depth=7).digraph()
sage: Gp.is_isomorphic(G, edge_labels=True)

There also seems to be too many vertices for type G<sub>2</sub>:

```
sage: G = crystals.infinity.PBW(['G',2]).subcrystal(max_depth=7).digraph()
sage: G
Digraph on 137 vertices
sage: Gp = crystals.infinity.Tableaux(['G',2]).subcrystal(max_depth=7).digraph()
sage: Gp
Digraph on 116 vertices

I think you interpret 3t as t+t+t, which you tropicalize to min(t,t,t)=t.

About the G2 errors: I also saw these two. I also fixed the B2<->C2 error.

The G2 case now matches the infinity tableau crystal with 116 nodes.

Hi all,

I'm in the process of reviewing this and I have some comments/concerns, mostly about the documentation.

- Dinakar's name should be added to the top of the `mv_polytopes.py` file as the initial author.
- Dinakar's (preferred) email should be added to the copyright of each file.
- Background information on the crystal of MV polytopes needs to be added to the documentation.  Also, even though the attributes seem to inherit from the PBW crystal, it still may be beneficial to the user to include element attributes for an MV polytope in its documentation.  In particular, `.star()` and `.lusztig_datum()` should be added.
- Background information on the PBW crystal needs to be added to the documentation.
- Documentation for `braid_move_calculator.py` needs to be linked from the `Root_System` page.
- Should the `pbw_datum.pyx` documentation be linked somewhere?  

Also, one question I brought up earlier in comment:9: is it possible/advantageous to define an MV polytope using a Lusztig datum, or using vertices, or something else than generating one from the highest weight polytope?  For example, being able to do this would be great:

```
sage: PBW = crystals.infinity.PBW("C2")
sage: PBW.set_default_long_word([1,2,1,2])
sage: b = PBW((1,2,1,2),(3,5,2,1))
sage: MV = crystals.infinity.MVPolytopes("C2")
sage: p = MV(b)
```

Other than these comments, I think the patch is ready to go.  I'm happy to read over the changes/additions once their finished!  It'll be great to get this merged!

Thanks Dinakar (and Travis) for getting this finished!

p.s. Typo in PBW crystal documentation: "Plucker" --> "Pl\"{u}cker"
