Refactor 3d plotting classes to create a uniform interface for rendering with various frontends.  Will make it easier to maintain current and implement new rendering frontends.  This will also make it possible to implement a new renderer outside of the Sage library, e.g. for prototyping.

Similar in strategy to rich representation as in #17234.

Note: we use 'render' in the most liberal sense.  E.g. x3d "renders" to a particular format.  Better term is welcome.

Idea: Instead of a repr method for each renderer on each 3d graphics class, put all rendering commands for a given renderer in a single class.  Renderers are registered in a global dict, etc.

To do: Figure out precisely how this should interact with the rich_repr framework.

Its a variant of the translator pattern, so maybe name things JmolTranslator etc?

You can't realistically have pluggable arbitrary rich output, the author of the Sage object needs to know what the possibilities are in order to decide on the suitable rich output. Now for the the very special case of just 3d graphics that might make sense, but then you can easily do that by

```
def _rich_repr_:
    ... try sane defaults first ...
    # if none of the defaults work try the rest 
    for output_type in display_manager.supported_output():
        try:
            return renderer(self, output_type) 
        except:
            pass
```
and then declare a particular output type as the only supported one from your backend.
