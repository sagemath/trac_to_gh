Refactor 3d plotting classes to create a uniform interface for rendering with various frontends.  Will make it easier to maintain current and implement new rendering frontends.  This will also make it possible to implement a new renderer outside of the Sage library, e.g. for prototyping.

Similar in strategy to rich representation as in #17234.

Note: we use 'render' in the most liberal sense.  E.g. x3d "renders" to a particular format.  Better term is welcome.

Idea: Instead of a repr method for each renderer on each 3d graphics class, put all rendering commands for a given renderer in a single class.  Renderers are registered in a global dict, etc.

To do: Figure out precisely how this should interact with the rich_repr framework.

No, the preferences are what you access through `%display`, so they are in fact the easiest and intended way to interact with the display manager. Thats why its user hostile if you name settings after obscure package names, and confusing to boot since not every 3d implementation makes sense for every UI.

If you want to micromanage the format then there is already `foo.plot(viewer='jmol')` and friends. The keyword name might/should be changed but at least its hidden away so that no ordinary user has to deal with it. An alternative would be `foo.save('output.obj').show()` and use the file extension to guess the type.

You can't realistically have pluggable arbitrary rich output, the author of the Sage object needs to know what the possibilities are in order to decide on the suitable rich output. Now for the the very special case of just 3d graphics that might make sense, but then you can easily do that by

```
def _rich_repr_:
    ... try sane defaults first ...
    # if none of the defaults work try the rest 
    for output_type in display_manager.supported_output():
        try:
            return renderer(self, output_type) 
        except:
            pass
```
and then declare a particular output type as the only supported one from your backend.
