Hi Travis,

thanks for the feedback.

> - Instead of `type(self) == BinaryMatroid`, you should do `isinstance(self, BinaryMatriod)` (or even better, for `is_binary`, I would just overwrite this method in that class which returns `True`).

I overwrote the method for BinaryMatroid and RegularMatroid, completely agree that this is a better solution. 

Why is `isinstance(self, BinaryMatroid)` preferred over over `type(self) == BinaryMatroid`? For a class like BinaryMatroid that has no derived classes, both seem to accomplish the exact same thing.

> - You need to fix the documentation of your methods. For example, the `INPUT:` block should only have one colon. You can look at the other nearby methods or ask me if you have any questions. I'd also add some latex formating to things using single backticks, e.g., <code>\`|X\B| \leq 1\`</code>.

I improved the docstring, with an eye on adjacent methods.

I wrote dozens of docstrings just before we added the matroid monster patch (essentialy all the docstrings were written after we wrote all the code), but apparently the rules for proper docstring writing have escaped me (or perhaps Stefan repaired my bad formatting during the review, so that I never even realized all my errors). Anyway, I should learn to do it properly.  I'll take a look at the developer guide.

It's a lot better (and overall, your documentation is good), but there's still some work to do:

- The indentation on all blocks with only a single colon should be the same as the base:

```
INPUT:

- ``randomized_tests`` -- (default: 1) some description here
```
- You should have (with 2 colons, space, and empty line):

```
.. SEEALSO::

    :meth:`M.is_binary() <sage.matroids.matroid.Matroid.is_binary>`
```
- The `EXAMPLES::` block should be followed by an empty line.
- Change `<=` to `\leq` (for the interactive doc, we make this substitution, but it will look better in the compiled doc).
- For the `BinaryMatroid.is_binary` and for `RegularMatroid`, I would just say the `randomized_tests` input is ignored.

Two more things. Once fixed you can set a positive review on my behalf.

- You have a `.. SEEALSO:` (missing a colon).
- Your algorithm blocks should be at same indentation level as the `ALGORITHM:`.

Thanks!

Another problem was that there was an item that was misaligned.

I made `local_binary_matroid` into a public function since it seems to be more useful than a simple helper function. I also moved the import into the function since it was circular and I couldn't get the doc to build otherwise.

Can you check that the doc also builds for you too? If so, and you agree with my changes, then we can set this back to positive review.

About making _local_binary_matroid() public... Well now that you bring this up, I agree that getting the actual binary representation itself may be useful to the user too. But with this pair of methods, if the user now wants a verified binary representation, they need to run both methods, one repeating the work of the other. And there would be two public methods in the interface dealing with one issue.

Also,  next up are ternary and quaternary matroids. For quaternary matroids the situation is more subtle. Unlike `local_binary_matroid`, the `local_quaternary_matroid` method may arrive at the conclusion that there is no quaternary representation. My idea was to let it output `None` in such cases. So then you would have very similar public methods behaving slightly different.

There may be another solution. I could rewrite `is_binary()` to a method `binary_representation()`, which outputs a `BinaryMatroid` equal to `self`, or `None` if no such binary matroid exists. The changes would be minimal. The user could still do `if M.binary_representation():` if they only care about existence. 

What do you think about this? If I promise not to mess up the docstrings this time ...

Cheers,
Rudi
