or

```
sage: Q = polytopes.icosahedron()

OK, sorry for the false alarm (it was an end of a tough day yesterday ;-)). I guess I got confused by the strange name for a backend as well...

In this setup I would not call the backend generic, because it does not provide the principal reason to use it: irrational exact values.

What about `irrational_exact` ?

I just saw that in the documentation of version 7.6.rc0, the doc file of the backend `field` is called "the python backend".

Maybe we should create a ticket about renaming the backend.
