The tests pass on my machine with 7.6.beta6. The documentation looks fine as well. No idea what the quasar bot is up to.

The I believe it is a good idea to raise an error for such a behaviour.

Matthias, any thoughts? Does that look good for you?

If it ever happens that there is a use case of the symbolic ring, we may consider adapting it properly then.

As mentioned in the title description, it only concerns the "field" backend that is **very much** broken for non exact fields. Other backends still support `RDF` as it used to be.

No worries!

It is true that the name 'field' is confusing...

In this setup I would not call the backend generic, because it does not provide the principal reason to use it: irrational exact values.

What about `irrational_exact` ?

I just saw that in the documentation of version 7.6.rc0, the doc file of the backend `field` is called "the python backend".

Maybe we should create a ticket about renaming the backend.
