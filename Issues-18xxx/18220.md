The 'field' backend does not properly support non exact fields

```
sage: omega = 2*RR.pi() / 5
sage: verts = [((i*omega).sin(), (i*omega).cos()) for i in range(5)]
sage: verts
sage: Polyhedron(vertices=verts, base_ring=RR)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AssertionError: 
```
or

```
sage: Q = polytopes.icosahedron()
sage: Q = polytopes.icosahedron(); Q
A 3-dimensional polyhedron in (Number Field in sqrt5 with defining polynomial x^2 - 5)^3 defined as the convex hull of 12 vertices
sage: Q_RR = Polyhedron(vertices = [n(v.vector(),digits=10) for v in Q.vertices()])
sage: Q_RR
A 3-dimensional polyhedron in (Real Field with 37 bits of precision)^3 defined as the convex hull of 7 vertices
sage: Q_RR = Polyhedron(vertices = [n(v.vector(),digits=30) for v in Q.vertices()])
sage: Q_RR
A 3-dimensional polyhedron in (Real Field with 103 bits of precision)^3 defined as the convex hull of 1 vertex and 3 rays
```

We simply raise an error if somebody want to try this.

The tests pass on my machine with 7.6.beta6. The documentation looks fine as well. No idea what the quasar bot is up to.

The I believe it is a good idea to raise an error for such a behaviour.

Matthias, any thoughts? Does that look good for you?
