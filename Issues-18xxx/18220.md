We simply raise an error if somebody want to try this.

The tests pass on my machine with 7.6.beta6. The documentation looks fine as well. No idea what the quasar bot is up to.

The I believe it is a good idea to raise an error for such a behaviour.

Matthias, any thoughts? Does that look good for you?

If it ever happens that there is a use case of the symbolic ring, we may consider adapting it properly then.

As mentioned in the title description, it only concerns the "field" backend that is **very much** broken for non exact fields. Other backends still support `RDF` as it used to be.

No worries!

It is true that the name 'field' is confusing...

In this setup I would not call the backend generic, because it does not provide the principal reason to use it: irrational exact values.

What about `irrational_exact` ?

I just saw that in the documentation of version 7.6.rc0, the doc file of the backend `field` is called "the python backend".

Maybe we should create a ticket about renaming the backend.
