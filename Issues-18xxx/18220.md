The 'field' backend does not properly support non exact fields

```
sage: omega = 2*RR.pi() / 5

sage: verts

or

```
sage: Q = polytopes.icosahedron()
sage: Q = polytopes.icosahedron(); Q
A 3-dimensional polyhedron in (Number Field in sqrt5 with defining polynomial x^2 - 5)^3 defined as the convex hull of 12 vertices

We simply raise an error if somebody want to try this.

OK, sorry for the false alarm (it was an end of a tough day yesterday ;-)). I guess I got confused by the strange name for a backend as well...

In this setup I would not call the backend generic, because it does not provide the principal reason to use it: irrational exact values.

What about `irrational_exact` ?

I just saw that in the documentation of version 7.6.rc0, the doc file of the backend `field` is called "the python backend".

Maybe we should create a ticket about renaming the backend.
