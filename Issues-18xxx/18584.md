<a id='comment:3'></a>Hi Nicolas and Franco -

I found this code on my computer (in my favourite `sage-6.5` with parts of the combinat queue applied and the only computer where a proper `chevie` interface for reflection groups is running). It does not appear to be in Sage, so I wonder whether that's needed, or whether there is something better than that.

Thanks, Christian

Indeed this is why I had put this iterator in `Semigroups`.

Which raises a good question: could we implement this with the current `RecursivelyEnumeratedSet`? It essentially allows only for univariate functions which is presumably not enough.

Christian: what's your use case?

Cheers,

Ok; so having it on a semigroup is enough for you.

My question was about the implementation of an iterator over a finitely generated magma using only `RecursivelyEnumeratedSet`. But if there is no explicit need for this feature right now, we might as well not worry about it.
