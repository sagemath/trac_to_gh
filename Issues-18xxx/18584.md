Hi Nicolas and Franco -

I found this code on my computer (in my favourite `sage-6.5` with parts of the combinat queue applied and the only computer where a proper `chevie` interface for reflection groups is running). It does not appear to be in Sage, so I wonder whether that's needed, or whether there is something better than that.

Thanks, Christian

It appears that `finitely_generated_semigroups` have a `succ_generators` and an {{__iter__}} defined. Is there a reason why that code is not in `finitely_generated_magmas`?

`@`Nicolas: should I move that code there, and delete my code for `magmas`?

Hi Christian, Travis!

Replying to [tscrim](#comment%3A12):
> I believe there is an issue with needing associativity. Specifically, I don't believe that iterator could get `(a * b) * (a * b)`. However, I think a default iterator could be described by using all previously encountered elements.


Indeed this is why I had put this iterator in `Semigroups`.

Which raises a good question: could we implement this with the current `RecursivelyEnumeratedSet`? It essentially allows only for univariate functions which is presumably not enough.

Christian: what's your use case?

Cheers,

I wanted (back when writing the never-finished-coxeter-group-stuff) to use an iterator through the reflection group, keeping track of the used word along the way.

Sorry, could you point to which question you refer? The way the iterator is implemented, or implementing a flag to attach the used word to the output?

Thanks, Christian

Ok; so having it on a semigroup is enough for you.

My question was about the implementation of an iterator over a finitely generated magma using only `RecursivelyEnumeratedSet`. But if there is no explicit need for this feature right now, we might as well not worry about it.
