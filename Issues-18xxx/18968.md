We should support LMFDB labels, e.g.

```
sage: EllipticCurve('11.a2') == EllipticCurve('11a1')
True
```
See http://www.lmfdb.org/knowledge/show/ec.q.lmfdb_label for details on LMFDB labels.

Sure, though much grander plans are around (with no-one yet having the time to do it) for a good interface from Sage to LMFDB using the api Harald wrote (see http://www.lmfdb.org/api/).

Actually Kiran's proposal is much easier since the LMFDB does understand Cremona labels so the URL "http://www.lmfdb.org/EllipticCurve/%s" % E.label()
should always work right now.

This is a great idea.  Note that the LMFDB can parse URLs of the form .../EllipticCurve/11a1 where the last part '11a1' is the Cremona label, as well as the LMFDB label version with a ".".

this:

does not work (ie does not lead to the page of the curve itself)

So what is the correct syntax for the link ?

Yes, it is a different thing than the title of this ticket and so should be separate.
We plan via ODK to have a much more systematic interface from Sage to LMFDB objects and this can be the start of that.
