> Guys, we are doing this work twice `:-/`

I'm helping to speed up the code in this ticket #18539, for that we just need a fast connectivity checker. I tried Sage's Hypergraph first, but look at this (same example as above):

```
sage: %time S = Hypergraph(points = list(M.groundset()), blocks =FC)
CPU times: user 1.17 s, sys: 20.9 ms, total: 1.19 s
Wall time: 1.18 s
sage: %time S.is_connected()
CPU times: user 50.7 s, sys: 593 ms, total: 51.3 s
Wall time: 50.7 s
True
```
Compared to SetSystem, the Hypergraph I want takes 200 times longer to construct, and finding out if it is connected takes about 4 million times longer. 

So what would you do in this case?

You got me wrong: I did not claim that Hypergraph's version was faster (just look at the code, you will see why it is slow), but I hope that I do not need to convince you that having two class with the same purpose (Hypergraph and SetSystem) and developping them in parallel is a very very bad idea.

Hmm, that's true. You need a sparse data structure too. So how about just replacing that incidence-matrix in there with one over GF(2)? There's dense and sparse versions of such matrices. I think I also saw a data_structures/bitset_matrix.pxi , perhaps use that for the dense version.

> The alternative is that I at some point write a new class Hypergraph from the ground up, and then we work afterwards to make that class mimick the interface of the current class Hypergraph. Would that work for you?  

Hmmm.. Do you think we could settle that with having some high-level Hypergraph classes, and some low-level hypergraph classes? That's how it works for graphs at the moment:

```
sage: graphs.PetersenGraph()._backend
<type 'sage.graphs.base.sparse_graph.SparseGraphBackend'>
```

This way we would have data-structure-specific code in data-structure-specific files, and high-level code in high-level files?

Hmmmm... Assuming that you did not mean "parent" like in "`Parent/Element`", then yes `:-P`
But let's discuss the design a bit, first.

I am looking at `matroid/set_system` at the moment, and it seems that most of what you have inside are private methods. It really does not look like it should be used from the outside indeed `O_o`

Is there any reason why `SetSystemIterator` is a class? Could that be because it was written before 'yield' became a Cython keyword?

Hello again,

I agree with this ticket, and added a small commit at `public/18682`. It is only style and doc:
- The first line of the docstring must be a short sentence
- A link toward `SetSystem` instead of plain text
- Comments in the code

It was a bit hard to read at first, for many variables hide their meaning:
- `_len` is the number of subsets (it could have been the number of points)
- `_temp` is a shipped bitset of size "number of points"

Anyway. If that's okay with you, then you can set this ticket to `positive_review`.

The style is pretty terrible, I'll grant you that. I was learning python/cython while I was writing the whole thing, so there are several things I would do differently if I had to start over. 

This in perhaps one of the reasons why making a entirely fresh start for Hypergraph (as opposed to re-using SetSystem) is a good idea. This SetSystem class essentially popped out of work on matroids and became much more of a separate entity than I had intended when I started writing the whole matroid code.

Helloooooooooo,

> I'm afraid I'm too much of a git novice to know how to pull/merge your commit in public/18682. What git command do I give?

The most trivial method to do it is simply to change the branch's name to public/18682, though that's how you would learn the least.

You have several other ways to do it. The first would be, as you say, to merge my branch with yours. This would mean:

```
git pull trac public/18682
```

In theory, that should create a merge commit atop your branch and atop mine, containing the changes of both. In practice, as my branch is merely yours with an additional commit, that would just move your branch's tip where mine is.

You can then push your branch, as usual, at its current location.

I had a good teacher :)

So if I want to politely propose a change in the work someone else did on a ticket, then this the way to go, push my modified branch somewhere else as in `git trac push public/some_name`? Excellent, I was wondering about that before.

Helloooooooo,

> So if I want to politely propose a change in the work someone else did on a ticket, then this the way to go, push my modified branch somewhere else as in `git trac push public/some_name`? Excellent, I was wondering about that before. 

That's how I work, and I believe that it is indeed the "most polite way" to proceed. I always find it a bit unpleasant when I see that the branch's name has been changed by somebody else who pushed commits I don't like on a ticket I'm working on, sometimes without even explaining what they do.

By pushing that stuff to another branch, you propose them to the author and if he likes them he can merge them to his ticket. If he does not like them, you can either forget about them or propose them on another ticket of your own.
