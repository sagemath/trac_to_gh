The installation manual is the first thing I get when I type 'install Sage' in Google. And from that manual, it is not totally obvious how Sage should be installed (especially from its sources). Read it and see how hard it is to get the basic info, like 'what to download' and 'what to type'

This branch tries to clean that manual a bit, mostly by moving things around, making lengthy explanations shorter and adding table of contents where one is needed.

In particular:

- There is no need of a section about how to build the doc in this manual. It is
  already explained somewhere else (in the developer's manual), and the doc is
  already built when you install Sage anyway.

- The section on SageTex is being moved to the (already existing)
  tutorial/sagetex document. Indeed:
  - Something as specific as 'how to configure Sagetex' does not belong to a
    document explaining how Sage should be installed (many packages require
    specific configuration, e.g. CPLEX,Gurobi,dot2tex,...)
  - Many links from the SageTex tutorial are broken if no internet connection is
    available, as they point directly to the online 'installation'
    manual. Besides, they point to the index and not to the actual install page.
    http://www.sagemath.org/doc/tutorial/sagetex.html
  - Some information is repeated in both documents (which usually leads to only
    one of the two being updated)

- 'Desktop icon' is renamed to 'KDE Desktop icon'. Though I do not personally
  believe that it is Sage's role to explain how to customize KDE.

- The 'introduction' section is merged with the 'index' page. Most of that
  section is actually a list of Sage's standard packages, and so this section
  has been renamed to 'standard packages'. Something will have to be done with
  this section later, see
  https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-devel/aEmUmFOwJYQ/discussion

Further work will have to be done to clean&simplify the two pages:
http://www.sagemath.org/doc/installation/source.html
http://www.sagemath.org/doc/installation/binary.html

I understand, though that should not stop us from reorganizing our doc. If you want some kind of 'deprecation' for the doc we could add empty pages (corresponding to the ones I removed), saying that the doc is now available somewhere else.

I do not mind doing that if you ask, but if you do please create a poll on sage-devel to ask what everybody thinks. That would be some kind of 'deprecation policy' for doc.

> but mostly I think that I would like to *expand* the influence of the installation guide and make it more obvious, not make it harder to find things.  So the more extra information (KDE, SageTeX, ...) the merrier!  As long as it's well organized.  And certainly those things fall under "installation"; I would be happy to include information about CPLEX and friends there, as a one-stop-shop is a good thing.  Then the tutorial could point to the installation guide for installation questions, leaving the tutorial to be just a tutorial.


While we should obviously provide as ample and useful explanations as possible with respect to all packages that we provide (even the optional ones), I think that gathering them all in this document would be a mistake.

Each package would have pretty different instructions, and nobody would be interested by the 'installation instructions for all "complicated" packages". We should make this information available, but we should keep it close to the general documentation on these packages. It would give us, for each package, a self-contained page about its uses and its installation instruction, if necessary.

Furthermore, there does not seem to be a reliable way to link *between* documents (except toward the reference manual). If we had all installation instructions in this 'installation' manual, we would not be able to link from a tutorial to the installation instructions (this branch actually removes some such links), or from the installation back to the tutorial.

Also, I know for a fact that I only update reliably the files on which I work.

On the other hand, anybody working on a manual would necessarily recompile it often, glance at it and notice some other thing which should be updated too.

I am in favor of pages explaining at the same time how the software can be used, and how it should be installed. Of course, we have ReST chapter to differenciate the two in the same page.
