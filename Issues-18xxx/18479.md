The following bug was found in [comment:13](#comment%3A13):ticket:18086:

```
sage: f = Newforms(Gamma1(25), names='a')[1]
sage: eps = f.character()
sage: eps.base_ring()
Number Field in a1 with defining polynomial x^8 + 5*x^7 + 11*x^6 + 10*x^5 + x^4 + 10*x^3 + 26*x^2 - 10*x + 1
sage: eps.minimize_base_ring()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: No compatible natural embeddings found for Complex Lazy Field and Number Field in a1 with defining polynomial x^8 + 5*x^7 + 11*x^6 + 10*x^5 + x^4 + 10*x^3 + 26*x^2 - 10*x + 1
```
This also causes

```
sage: ModularForms(eps, 2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: No compatible natural embeddings found for Complex Lazy Field and Number Field in a1 with defining polynomial x^8 + 5*x^7 + 11*x^6 + 10*x^5 + x^4 + 10*x^3 + 26*x^2 - 10*x + 1
```
This error is similar to #18436.

The attached branch fixes the bug by wrapping the conversion to the smaller field in a `try` block.  We also improve the code in `DirichletCharacter.minimize_base_ring()` and the function `sage.modular.modsym.canonical_parameters()`, which uses `minimize_base_ring()`.
