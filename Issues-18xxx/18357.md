There should be a variant of ascii art using unicode. It should share code with ascii art as appropriate.

Also, there are various typesetting-related modules in `sage.misc`: ascii art, latex, mathjax, .... They should be moved into a common package. I propose `sage.typeset`

Argh, the Dyck paths looks ugly. I am trying to do something but the BOX DIAGONALS do not match very well...

Do you know why in the ipython notebook we got a failure

```

Thanks for the inclusion.

I got other troubles with the Ipython notebook:
- with `%display unicode` it can not export in pdf because latex failed

```
...

    (ucs)                possibly declared in uni-35.def.

    ? 
    ! Emergency stop.
     ...                                              
                                                      
    l.225 ...lor}Out[{\color{outcolor}15}]:} ⎛2 2⎞
                                                      
    !  ==> Fatal error occurred, no output PDF file produced!
    Transcript written on notebook.log.
```

- if `%display latex` then it works fine in the browser for matrices but not for tableaux or Dyck paths. More precisely, I see the latex code.
- if `%display latex` then after an export pdf, the output which is exported is not the latex one but the plain text! I thought that `latex` would be the ideal mode for notebooks for both the display and the export...

It is the author of the request who closes the issue... not sure it is a won't fix but he did not say how he fixed it for himself. Anyway, it looks like a Ipython notebook issue and not a Sage one. Would be nice to have this "export to pdf" feature using the latex output!

Hello,

Two commits to:
- get rid of trailing whitespaces
- clean up a bit `CharacterArt/CharacterArtFactory`. I would like to do more cleanup but need your opinions on several points.

1. Why does `CharacterArt` inherits from `SageObject`? And `CharacterArtFactory`? Do you mind if I get rid of this?

2. In `build_comma_sequence`, there is a very original

```
"" ** ZZ(repr_elems._h - 1 - repr_elems._baseline)
```
  Is there any mysterious reason?

3. Wouldn't be better to make the `CharacterArtFactory` callable and make it replace the two functions `unicode_art` and `ascii_art`?

4. It would be cool to make tableaux part of the `CharacterArtFactory` (certainly for another ticket).

5. Could we get rid of `CompoundSymbol.print_to_stdout`? This could be tested inside `__call__`.

6. You defined symbols for the integral but these are not used...

7. In my console the curly braces of height 2 does not print correctly, ie those two

```
unicodedata.lookup('UPPER LEFT OR LOWER RIGHT CURLY BRACKET SECTION')
unicodedata.lookup('UPPER RIGHT OR LOWER LEFT CURLY BRACKET SECTION')
```
  Are these two standard?

Vincent

Aah the evils of trailing whitespace. Of course we shouldn't make any improvements to Sage until we have conquered that one.

1. Every object should inherit from `SageObject`. Doesn't really matter for stuff that is not exposed but why not?

2. I just refactored the code, I didn't write it.

3. There is of course always more than one way to do it but they should have different docstrings. Separate functions is the cleanest way to implement that.

I thought `SageObject` was meant for mathematical objects. It helps for interfacing with third party libraries/softwares and has this `rename` feature. But I really do not see the point of using it here... Perhaps for the very elegant

```
def __hash__(self):
    return hash(self.__repr__())

Moreover avoiding it makes clear that this piece of code is not dependent on the rest of Sage. And that it can be recycled outside of it and/or possible externalized.

```
sage: import sage.misc.ascii_art

  people might have used this feature in their own code.

9. In the Sage notebook, doing

```
unicode_art(list(DyckWords(1).list()))
```
  or

```
ascii_art(list(DyckWords(1).list()))
```
  I got

  I guess that the width of the screen is not properly detected. Indeed (still in the Sage notebook)

```
sage: from sage.typeset.character_art import CharacterArt
sage: c = CharacterArt()
sage: c._terminal_width()
0
```
  I think that this `_terminal_width` should be somewhere else as the `CharacterArt` by itself should not be aware of the output device. What do you think?

This is not only an implementation detail. If somebody has a personal file with

```
class MyObject(...):
    ...
    def _ascii_art_(self):
        from sage.misc.ascii_art import AsciiArt
        ...
```
then I think it should still work after this ticket being closed. Don't you think?

Right.

Hi Volker,

In the review commit `​2b0207c` I did some more cleaning in `CharacterArt`. The way breakpoints are used was completely wrong... it is a bit better but not perfect. I can move it to another ticket if you prefer. I will not add change anymore.

I still wonder about the `AsciiArt`. It is not available from `sage.all` so the only way somebody can use it from a `.sage` and a `.py` file is to import it from its module. Why are you against a lazy import with `deprecation=True`?

Vincent

Not all. But a reasonable subset, yes. In the particular case we are talking about, if somebody did implement some ascii art for his/her own object then the way he/she did is

```
class MyObject(Element):
     def _ascii_art_(self):
          from sage.misc.ascii_art import AsciiArt
          ...
          return AsciiArt(...)
```
I just do not want to completely break that.

By the way, `sage.structure.element.Element` is not public. Will I be able to move it without deprecation? Of course not!!

There are a number of doctest failures due to different baselines because of your changes, like:

```
File "src/sage/combinat/binary_tree.py", line 2511, in sage.combinat.binary_tree.BinaryTree.under
Failed example:
    ascii_art((b1, b2, b1 \ b2))
Expected:
    (   o    o        _o_   )
    (  / \    \      /   \  )
    ( o   o,   o,   o     o )
    (              / \      )
    (             o   o     )
Got:

    (  / \    \      /   \  )
    ( o   o    o    o     o )

Right. Sorry. With a one line modification I get the previous behavior. But do you really think that we should keep this behavior

```
            [                                       ]
            [ , o, ,   _o_        o      o      o   ]
            [         /   \             / \         ]
            [        o     o           o   o        ]
            [             / \                       ]
            [            o   o, ,  , ,      , ,  ,  ]
```
Would be better with all commas at the same position, isn't it?
