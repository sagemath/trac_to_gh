Thanks! But actually the fixes to `number_field/*` were on the branch about `reference/rings` (#18169). So the problem here is that I apparently put some of the changes to index files depending on these fixes on this ticket's branch instead of the other one, and then made a mistake while testing that the tickets were independent. Anyway, I'm now rebasing both branches—and dropping your commit in the process to avoid conflicts.

I don't remember for sure, sorry, but I guess Jeroen is right. (Most probably, I automated part of the changes and didn't notice the issue.) In any case, the general goal of the branch was to ensure that all sage modules (well, except for a few special cases) were included in the reference manual.
