Thanks! But actually the fixes to `number_field/*` were on the branch about `reference/rings` (#18169). So the problem here is that I apparently put some of the changes to index files depending on these fixes on this ticket's branch instead of the other one, and then made a mistake while testing that the tickets were independent. Anyway, I'm now rebasing both branches—and dropping your commit in the process to avoid conflicts.
