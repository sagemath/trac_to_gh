Thanks! But actually the fixes to `number_field/*` were on the branch about `reference/rings` (#18169). So the problem here is that I apparently put some of the changes to index files depending on these fixes on this ticket's branch instead of the other one, and then made a mistake while testing that the tickets were independent. Anyway, I'm now rebasing both branches—and dropping your commit in the process to avoid conflicts.

I'm confused about what the lines

```
   sage/groups/perm_gps/partn_ref
   sage/groups/perm_gps/partn_ref2
```
in `reference/groups/index.rst` were supposed to accomplish, because in Sage 8.1.beta4, they lead to useless pages. (See http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/groups/sage/groups/perm_gps/partn_ref.html, for example.) Can anyone clarify?

I don't remember for sure, sorry, but I guess Jeroen is right. (Most probably, I automated part of the changes and didn't notice the issue.) In any case, the general goal of the branch was to ensure that all sage modules (well, except for a few special cases) were included in the reference manual.
