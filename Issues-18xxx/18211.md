We just call LattE (command `count`) through the command line to get the Ehrhart polynomial of a lattice polytope.

For complete doctesting you should run both of the following command (with and without `--long`)

```
sage -t --optional=sage,latte_int $SAGE_ROOT/src/sage/geometry/polyhedron/
sage -t $SAGE_ROOT/src/sage/geometry/polyhedron/
```

This looks great to me. 

In the docstring, could you fix the spelling: "LattE integral" -> "LattE integrale"

Also, LattE has many options that control the type of algorithm used. 
For example, for many examples "--maxdet=1000" will make the calculation much faster.  
Is there a way to allow the user to pass such options to LattE?

Will do. Thanks. I was not sure if I needed to cite people for LattE contribution, should I?
  
> Also, LattE has many options that control the type of algorithm used.

Yes, whatever you want. The function `Popen` of python is flexible to send any option to the command line. Could you describe the set of option that will be interesting to have?

(I am currently testing the new method on the Sage library of polytopes... and I found plenty of bugs!)

Is `check_output` compatible with `Popen`? Is the following ok

```
latte_proc = Popen(*args)
ans, err = latte_proc.communicate()
ret_code = latte_proc.poll()
if ret_code:
    raise ValueError

By the way, I am not sure about the place where I put the code. It is currently in `base_ZZ.py` which means that the polytope has to be defined with equations with coefficients in `ZZ`. But it might be that some polyhedron with coefficients in `QQ` actually give a lattice polytope. If anybody has an idea about that.

The LattE command line options need to be written with dashes, not underscores:

--irrational_primal --> --irrational-primal
--irrational_all_primal --> --irrational-all-primal

The docstring mentions no_decomposition, but it is not handled in the code

Will do.

If you have time, could you provide more details about the command line option. I found the LattE documentation quite cryptic to that respect.

God. I had not noticed that you were reading the result from the output `:-D`

With the code from [1] you can do whatever you want with the output:

```
sage: from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
sage: p = Popen("ls",stdout=PIPE)
sage: for line in iter(p.stdout.readline,''):
....:     print line.strip()
```

And to check that it does not wait for the process to end, you can run a 'tail -f' on some (existing) temporary file

```
sage: p = Popen(["tail","-f","/tmp/eee"],stdout=PIPE)
sage: for line in iter(p.stdout.readline,''):
....:     print line.strip()
```

A new line appears in python every time you type "echo artartaert >> /tmp/eee" in a terminal.

Hello !

There was still a (very unimportant) problem when `verbose=True` and the process returns with an error. In this case the exception displays an (empty) variable `err`.

I fixed this nonexisting problem at public/18211, though I have not been able to make the process return with an error. Even when I changed "--cdd" with "--crghalruhaldd" it returned 'normaly' `:-P`

This looks great, thanks a lot for your work.

There are, however, quite a few more LattE options that are useful, at least for expert users. 
Below I list the ones (this is cut and paste from "count --help") that make sense for the "--ehrhart-polynomial" mode.

```
  --compute-vertex-cones={cdd,lrs,4ti2}    Use this method for computing vertex cones
  --smith-form={ilio,lidia}
  --dualization={cdd,4ti2}
  --triangulation={cddlib,4ti2,topcom,...}
  --triangulation-max-height=HEIGHT        Use a uniform distribution of height from 1 to HEIGHT.

Has the question of ZZ vs. QQ been resolved? 

Perhaps more examples should be added that make uses of some of LattE's options. 
For example, an Ehrhart polynomial of a cross-polytope, which benefits from irrational_all_primal.
