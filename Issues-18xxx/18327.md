This is because without the artificial padding of axes you can have graph plots with extreme dimensions where the only two nodes are aligned along one axis. Its not specific to graphs, though, you can trigger it without as well:

```
sage: line([(1e-19,-1), (-1e-19,+1)], aspect_ratio=1.0)

  warnings.warn("Unable to find pixel distance along axis for interval padding; assuming no interval padding needed.")

  warnings.warn("Unable to find pixel distance along axis for interval padding; assuming no interval padding needed.")
Launched png viewer for Graphics object consisting of 1 graphics primitive
```
The warning means that matplotlib trips over floating point errors.
