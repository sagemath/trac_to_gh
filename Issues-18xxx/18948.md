This ticket implements a new module names `strongly_regular_db` that lets us build one example of strongly regular graph, given four integer parametes (v,k,lambda,mu).

It uses Andries Brouwer's database to return more meaningful non-existence results, and help us find which constructions are missing from the database.

With a bit of luck (and time, and work) it would be great if we could reproduce all SRG that are known to exist!

The module has a simple structure:

has a simple structure:

- A `seems_feasible(v,k,l,mu)` function that performs the basic artihmetic
  checks to figure out if `(v,k,l,mu)` is realizable. The
  'apparently_feasible_parameters(n)` returns the lists of all parameters that
  pass these tests for v<n. When n=1301, the set of parameters it returns is
  precisely those that appear on your database (this is checked in the code).

- Several functions (is_paley, is_johnson, ...) test if a given set of
  parameters (v,k,l,mu) can be realized with a graph of the corresponding family
  (a Paley graph, a Johnson graph, ...). If they can, they return the parameters
  of that graph so that it can be built easily.

- The main function `strongly_regular_graph` can be called in two ways:

  - `strongly_regular_graph(v,k,l,mu,existence=True)` answers True if such a
    graph is known to exists, False if it is known to be infeasible, and Unknown
    otherwise.

  - `strongly_regular_graph(v,k,l,mu)` attempts to build and return the
    requested graph, and returns a meaningful exception if it cannot.

This branch also updates the package 'graphs', which now ships the database in json format.

To me your phrasing also sounds incorrect, as it seems to test whether "every (v,k,l,mu)-strongly regular graph is a Paley graph".

What about replacing 'a' by 'some'?

```
Test if some Paley graph is (v,k,l,mu)-strongly regular
```

How about functions like `is_paley()`? They also do not need `mu`...

By the way, what is the point of doing `return (lambda q : PaleyGraph(q),v)` instead of
`return PaleyGraph(v)` ?

That's in order to be able to tell if the construction *can* be done without doing it (which can take quite some time). Very useful to know which entries Sage can build to compare it to the list of those that are known to exist. I used a design similar to the one used in `sage.combinat.designs.orthogonal_arrays_find_construction`, where many functions exist to *guess* the parameters of some constructions (exactly like it is done here). With these design, knowing if something can be built and getting the data to build it is done in the same operation. There are two advantages:

2) No 'if exists' everywhere in the code's function, to return 'True' instead of returning the graph
3) If you want to test the existence, THEN build the graph, you do not call the function twice with different parameters (which would not use the function's cache, and so you compute the decomposition twice).

Admittedly, the functions of the design code are computationally much more expensive than those.

it seems that

```
cdef eigenvalues(int v,int k,int l,int mu)
```
only returns correct results for the non-Paley (non-conference) case (i.e. the case where the eigenvalues are not integer).

This should be documented, at least.

Scuse me, can you show me this 'doctest failure' you mention? I do not see it. I load the branch, I run the tests, they pass. Something different happens on your computer?
