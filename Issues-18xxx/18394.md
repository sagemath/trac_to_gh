The PARI command `make snapshot` (analogous to `make dist` in automake projects) is broken, causing some missing documentation in the PARI tarball distributed with Sage.

If the documentation does not get rebuilt, this can give errors while generating the `sumnummoninit` (recently added to PARI) function.

Since we need to create a new tarball anyway, we might as well upgrade to latest GIT master.

Yes.

Just build all of PARI first (`make gp doc snapshot` instead of `make snapshot`). I hope that is sufficient.

> If so, what is the fix

The correct dependencies (all generated source files, in particular `usersch3.tex`) have to be added to the `snapshot` target in the `Makefile`, but I don't know precisely which.

> have you reported it upstream?

I tried but for some reason I cannot send messages to `pari-dev` anymore (I sent 2 messages but they do not appear on the mailing list). Just now, I sent an actual bug report.

It seems so; I previously got an error and a truncated `auto_gen.pxi` while building PARI in Sage (saying that `sumnummon` or `sumnummoninit` did not have documentation) but this does not happen anymore.  I am now running doctests.

I had a similar problem recently; some messages I tried to send using Gnus with NNTP via `gmane.org` disappeared, but e-mail did work.
