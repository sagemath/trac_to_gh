Pull this branch after checking out develop branch 6.6.rc0.

In class :class:`AlternatingSignMatrix` (future: in class FullyPackedLoop): 
* add a method :meth:`obtain_gyration_orbit` for returning the orbit of self.

In class :class:`AlternatingSignMatrices`: 
* add a method :meth:`gyration_orbits` for returning the list of orbits of alternating sign matrices of order n.
* add a method :meth:`gyration_orbit_size` for returning the sizes of orbits of alternating sign matrices of order n.

For method :meth:`AlternatingSignMatrix.gyration`
* optional parameter k (default k=1) to indicate how many times to gyrate on the ASM
(Note: we are no longer adding an optional parameter because the reviewer disagreed).

See Ticket #18003 (implementing FullyPackedLoop class)

We are implementing the code that Travis Scrimshaw gave us.

<div id="comment:8" align="right">comment:8</div>

Here are my comments:

- I don't like the `count` option to `gyration`. You are much better writing a simple `for` loop which applies the sequence of gyrations to avoid the unnecessary complexity.
- Rename `obtain_gyration_orbit` to `gyration_orbit`.
- Use `@cached_method` for `gyration_orbits` (and you should not say anything about its internal representation). Also have it return a tuple instead of a list.
- Don't cache `gyration_orbit_sizes` since the previous caching will keep this fast (and definitely do not hardcode them).

Also, do you want this to depend on #17988? If so, I should be able to do that review this week.

I did all the changes you asked except for the very last comment "Don't cache gyration_orbit_sizes".

To clarify, do you mean I should remove these lines from gyration_orbit_sizes?
        if self._gyration_orbit_sizes:
            return self._gyration_orbit_sizes

And remove the "self._gyration_orbit_sizes"?
