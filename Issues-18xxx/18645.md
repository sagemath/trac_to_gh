Hi Jon,

Patch looks good, documentation looks good, and all tests passed.

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Total time for all tests: 2285.1 seconds
    cpu time: 12380.9 seconds
    cumulative wall time: 17333.0 seconds
```

Some suggestions, though:

- Should the term `strict` in `is_hyperbolic` be changed to `compact` to mesh with some current literature?

- Can you also add a method `is_Lorentzian`?

Best,
Ben

Some minor things:

- I think this logic

```
if compact:
    if not subg.is_finite():
        return False
else:
    if not subg.is_finite() and not subg.is_affine():
        return False
```
  could be rewritten as

```
if not ( subg.is_finite() or (compact and subg.is_affine()) ):
    return False
```
  (IMO using `or` reflects the definition better, but feel free to distribute the `not`).
- I'd change `all([a.det() > 0 for a in self.principal_submatrices()])` into `all(a.det() > 0 for a in self.principal_submatrices())` as you don't need to create the intermediary list.
- I'd replace `return comp_num == 0 or comp_num == 1` with `return comp_num <= 1`.
- The `INPUT:` block contents should not be indented.
- Using Sage's `Set` is somewhat of a heavyhanded approach. So I'd make this change:

```diff
-        from sage.sets.set import Set
-        iset = Set(range(self.ncols()));
-        ret = []
-        for l in iset.subsets():
+        iset = range(self.ncols())
+        from sage.misc.misc import powerset
+        ret = []
+        for l in powerset(iset):
```

For example, should a Cartan matrix with a finite block and an affine block be considered affine?\n\nFor now, the methods ` is_finite() `, ` is_affine() `, ` is_hyperbolic() ` return false if the matrix is decomposable. Indecomposability is assumed in the classification in Kac's book (and Carter's), but I've seen other conventions (e.g. calling a Cartan matrix with multiple finite blocks a finite matrix).\n\nWith this in mind, I added the ` indecomposable_blocks() ` method to make it easy for a user to check blocks individually for finiteness, affineness, and hyperbolicity.",

Is there a generally accepted convention for deciding how to classify Cartan matrices whose blocks are of mixed type? For example, should a Cartan matrix with a finite block and an affine block be considered affine?

For now, the methods ` is_finite() `, ` is_affine() `, ` is_hyperbolic() ` return false if the matrix is decomposable. Indecomposability is assumed in the classification in Kac's book (and Carter's), but I've seen other conventions (e.g. calling a Cartan matrix with multiple finite blocks a finite matrix).

With this in mind, I added the ` indecomposable_blocks() ` method to make it easy for a user to check blocks individually for finiteness, affineness, and hyperbolicity.

Hi all,

Hmm. I also had thoughts about that recently when classifying finite and affine types. Here are some thoughts, suggestions, feel free to critize/ignore...

Have a look at #17798, there is a function "recognize_coxeter_type_from_matrix".

I usually use the following naming convention for Finite and Affine:

-Finite types correspond to positive definite bilinear forms (reducible or not). For example, A_1 x A_1 should return True to "is_finite".

-Affine types are not finite but the corresponding bilinear is semi-positive definite. The group acts affinely on a Euclidean space. Note the "potentiality" here in the definition. Some may require that the dimension of the kernel of the bilinear be 1-dimensional, so that an affine type should consist of only one affine component and possibly finite components.

I like to refer to finite and affine types as level 0 types (see below).

Hyperbolic (Bourbaki and Humphreys): The bilinear form is regular (trivial kernel) but has exactly one negative eigenvalue. Moreover, it is called compact if the fundamental cone is compact in the hyperbolic space. It is called finite volume if the volume of the cone is finite volume in the hyperbolic space.

+'s: this is classical nomenclature.
-'s: there are way more matrices that are regular and have exactly one negative eigenvalue.

The only reason I found in the litterature about naming these groups hyperbolic was that they are the ones that one can easily deal with (at the time). I believe this fact to be obsolete nowadays.

There is another naming convention which says that hyperbolic is exactly when the bilinear form is regular and has exactly one eigenvalue. This was adopted by Vinberg and Maxwell for example in the 70's and 80's. But this leads to confusion.

Another convention is when the bilinear form has exactly one negative eigenvalue and a non-zero kernel: weakly hyperbolic. IMHO, this "weakly" is misleading.

Have a look at Remark 2.2 of http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.8608 where there are references about this.

==============

To clarify all this, I like to use the notion of level and strictness that reveals a lot of structure.

A Coxeter matrix or Coxeter graph is of level 0 if it is finite or affine.

A Coxeter matrix or Coxeter graph is of "level =<r" if removing any set of r generators leaves a finite or affine type graph/matrix.

A Coxeter matrix or Coxeter graph is of level (exactly) r if it is not of level <=r-1 but of level <=r.

A Coxeter matrix or Coxeter graph is strict if removing the r vertices always leaves a finite type.

The hyperbolic (compact and non compact) are the graphs of level 1. The compact hyperbolic types are exactly the strict level 1.

The level 2 graphs have signature (n-1,1,0). This was proved by Maxwell and his enumeration was corrected in the above paper.

Instead of using hyperbolic I prefer to use the term Lorentzian to reflect the fact that the group acts not only on the hyperbolic space (which is part of a Lorentz space) but also on the outside of it. Note that the Lorentzian represent a potentiality. Lorentzian types are when the signature of the bilinear is (n-1,1,0). When the kernel is non-zero, i.e. signature (m,1,k) I would use the term degenerate Lorentzian instead of weakly hyperbolic.

Sorry for the long text... Anyhow, this is more or less the picture as for Coxeter matrices and types.

As for the methods: very good to have them there!

@tscrim: I think I've made all the changes you suggested.

A couple things that we should probably do (on another ticket?):

- add ` is_hyperbolic `, ` is_lorentzian ` and ` is_indefinite ` methods to DynkinDiagram.
- unify results here with those for reducible Cartan types. To see what I mean, note the difference between CM2 and CM3 below, where the matrices are the same, but where CM2 knows its CartanType while CM3 does not.

```
sage: CM1 = CartanMatrix("A2xA2")
sage: CM1.is_finite()
True
sage: CM2 = CartanMatrix("A2~xA2")
sage: CM2
[ 2 -1 -1  0  0]
[-1  2 -1  0  0]
[-1 -1  2  0  0]
[ 0  0  0  2 -1]
[ 0  0  0 -1  2]
sage: CM2.is_finite()
False
sage: CM2.is_affine()
False
sage: CM3 = CartanMatrix([[2,-1,-1,0,0],[-1,2,-1,0,0],[-1,-1,2,0,0],[0,0,0,2,-1],[0,0,0,-1,2]])
sage: CM3.is_affine()

Thanks. Although I would not cache `principal_submatrices` as it returns a list of mutable matrices. I would change the output of `indecomposable_blocks` to a tuple so that the output list cannot be changed. Once this is changed, you can set a positive review on my behalf.

I'm happy doing this on another ticket as well. You might be interested in #15974 (which I have half forgotten about, half didn't have time for).

> - unify results here with those for reducible Cartan types. To see what I mean, note the difference between CM2 and CM3 below, where the matrices are the same, but where CM2 knows its CartanType while CM3 does not.

Yes, we do not have good type recognition for Cartan types. I think the better thing to do is to compare the Dynkin diagrams (as digraphs) and do type recognition and relabeling that way. However this is definitely a separate ticket.

Also, please add your real name as the author.
