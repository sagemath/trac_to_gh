This ticket implements a first method for computing the cutwidth of (small) graphs.
In an other ticket, I will add a MILP formulation for comparison purpose.

Helloooooooo,

Several remarks:

- You can rewrite `dict( (u,i) for i,u in enumerate(L) )` as
  ` {u:i for i,v in enumerate(L) `

- In
  ` cpt += popcount32( (Sbar&g.graph[i]) * ((S>>i)&1) ) `
  Instead of multiplying by `((S>>i)&1)`, which is 0 or 1, you can do
  ` cpt += popcount32( (Sbar&g.graph[i]) & (-((S>>i)&1)) ) `
  given that 0 in binary is '0...0' and that -1 is '1.....1'.

  This being said, there may be time to save by not re-computing the cost from
  scratch (considering all n vertices) but by computing only the difference from
  the previous cost, caused by the addition of the last vertex in the ordering.

- About
  {{{
+    This method differs from method
+    `sage.graphs.graph_decompositions.vertex_separation.exists` by a single
+    line. We can certainly combine codes.
  }}}
  Something with templates, like it is done in #18395?

- About
  {{{
+
+    This is a copy/paste of method
+    `sage.graphs.graph_decompositions.vertex_separation.find_order` and so we
+    can certainly directly import it.
  }}}
  If all you need is to change `int8_t` into `uint8_t` `vertex_separation_exp` then yes of course!

Have fuuuuuuun,

Nathann

Hello,

I have performed several modifications and I'm now using the `find_order` method of `vertex_separation`.

I don't know how to use the templates (and I'm unable to find this in #18395).

I agree that we can certainly speed-up method `compute_edge_cut`. The best operation to compute the number of edges from `S+i` to `V\(S+i)` is `count_S + degree[i] - 2*popcount32(S&g.graph[i])`, where `count_S` is the number of edges from `S` to `V\S`. However, we don't store the number of edges from `S` to `V\S`, so I don't know how to do this incremental process.

David.

The trick that is used in that ticket is the following: the function `run_spring` takes an argument of type `dimension_t` (a fused type). We do not care what the value of this parameter is, only its type matters (`D_TWO` or `D_THREE`), for the function will be compiled twice, once for each type.\n\nInside the function, depending on the *type* of this variable, the value of `dim` is determined. As it never changes throughout the function, all tests 'if dim == 2' are resolved at compile-time. You could use the same trick to be able to pick different cost functions for free (at runtime), but admittedly the trick is more a 'hack'.\n\n> I agree that we can certainly speed-up method `compute_edge_cut`.

We can just add an argument 'previous_cost' to 'exists', and then whenever 'exists' (which computed 'current_cost') calls 'exists', it can pass its 'current_cost' as a 'previous_cost'?.. This way 'exists' only has to compute the difference.\n\nNathann",

Okay ! Note that replacing the import 'fily.pyx' with a cimport is not totally free. If you cimport functions, those functions will not be inlined (in particular popcount32).

> I don't know how to use the templates (and I'm unable to find this in #18395).


I just added a merge commit (that branch was in conflict with the latest beta). The trick that is used in that ticket is the following: the function `run_spring` takes an argument of type `dimension_t` (a fused type). We do not care what the value of this parameter is, only its type matters (`D_TWO` or `D_THREE`), for the function will be compiled twice, once for each type.

Inside the function, depending on the *type* of this variable, the value of `dim` is determined. As it never changes throughout the function, all tests 'if dim == 2' are resolved at compile-time. You could use the same trick to be able to pick different cost functions for free (at runtime), but admittedly the trick is more a 'hack'.

> I agree that we can certainly speed-up method `compute_edge_cut`. The best operation to compute the number of edges from `S+i` to `V\(S+i)` is `count_S + degree[i] - 2*popcount32(S&g.graph[i])`, where `count_S` is the number of edges from `S` to `V\S`. However, we don't store the number of edges from `S` to `V\S`, so I don't know how to do this incremental process.


Well, it is the 'current cost' that is computed in 'exists', isn't it? We can just add an argument 'previous_cost' to 'exists', and then whenever 'exists' (which computed 'current_cost') calls 'exists', it can pass its 'current_cost' as a 'previous_cost'?.. This way 'exists' only has to compute the difference.

Hello,

I have improved the cost computation. It is now incremental and so faster.

I don't see how I can avoid the cimport of popcount32. If I want to reuse the `find_order` method from `vertex_separation`, I need a .pxd file. Since `FastDigraph` is an input parameter of the method, it should appear in that .pxd file, right?
Do you have a better solution in mind? The only alternative I see is to not share the code.

For the fuse type / template stuff, since now the methods have different inputs, it is may be too complicated for the possible benefit. You agree?

David.

Hello David,

I added a commit on top on top of your public branch (hoping that you will nto
mind). It does the following things:

- Unimportant things

- remove a 'verbose' flag that you do not use

- Simplify the test for connectivity (rather unimportant too)

- use `cw` in the recursive call to `cutwidth`

- use `cut_off` in the call to `cutwidth_dyn`

- You could not guess how much time I spent over your "fake simple loop", only
  to figure out that you wanted to be able to use 'break'. It really takes a lot
  of time. I swear. When you use tricks like that, *please* say it explicitly in
  a comment.

  More technically: I first added a comment above the loop to make it clearer,
  then thought that it was making things very very complicated to avoid a
  copy/paste of the three lines needed before the 'return'. Besides, your code
  did not free the memory when it was interrupted with a CTRL+C.

  I rewrote it with a try/except and with two nested loops. Three lines are
  copy/pasted, but I find this a much better deal in terms of readability than a
  fake nested loop. Plus it frees the memory.

- In 'exists', I renamed `count_S` to `cost_S`. Same here. You have no idea how
  many questions can be raised in the head of somebody reading the code and not
  understanding what you do with this variable called 'count_S' which, which
  turns out to not count S at all. My interpretation of this variable is that it
  stores the cost of `S`. Please check.

- When you want to multiply something by two, please use `*2` and not `<<1`. It
  makes your meaning much clearer. Gcc generates the same code anyway.

- About:
  {{{
  -    cdef int mini = (1<<g.n)-1
  +    cdef int mini = (<uint8_t> -1)
  }}}
  I also wondered for a moment why you defined this specific value for `mini`. I
  ended up convincing myself that you just wanted "a big constant".

- I made a slightly unrelated modification to a distant 'doctest' file. Here is
  why: this code 'injects' in any Sage file, when you run the tests, a check
  that there are as many `sig_on` as `sig_off`. You will see it if you run the
  tests on `cutwidth.pyx` after removing one of the `sig_off` (for instance the
  one that appears inside of the return, in the nested loop).

  It indicates that a doctest is broken, at some line in `cutwidth.pyx`. Of
  course, this doctest is not really there so you are looking for a line that
  does not really exists. I added a comment to it, so that its meaning is
  clearer when you get an error in a `sage -t`.

Could you also document the parameters of the 'exists' function, and the
expected behavior? I was surprised that a variable named 'cost' was actually
used as "max_admissible_cost".

Thanks,

Nathann

I have renamed `cost` -> `k` to be consistent with the `cutwidth_dyn` method. It should be easier to follow.

OK. I wasn't sure of that.

Right. For vertex separation it was sufficient to initialize it with `g.n`, but here the maximum value can reach `n^2/2` (luckily, since `n\leq 31`, the maximum possible value, `15*16=240`, can be stored in an `uint8_t`.

ok. This is admittedly easier that to create a one line ticket.

I tried to improve both the module documentation and the computation steps.

Thanks to you.

Hellooooooo,

Yepyep, 'unfortunately'. I needed it recently, and... Well, it works `:-P`

```
sage: def a():
....:     try:
....:         return 1
....:     finally:
....:         print "Hey"
sage: a()
Hey

Hello,

Thanks for the review and the commit !
Unfortunately, I see from the patchbot that we have many errors due to the counting of `sig_on`/ sig_off`. So I assume we have no choice but opening a specific ticket, right?
