Just my two cents: we should find a way to make sure that a translation of a document stays up-to-date. Otherwise any translation ends in a nightmare, when it will diverge from the official one.

Well, many open-source projects' documentation is not up-to-date even in the original language. IMHO a translation is mostly a teaser for people having a native language other then English to come, see and try the software. Anyway I hope it will be useful somehow, as it takes a lot of time to do, format, compile and publish it.

I do not know Italian, so I can't help verify the translation (you could ask on sage-devel for help on reviewing). However some general comments for this and #18699:

- Try to keep line lengths around 80 characters at the most (exclusions apply to doctests, output which does not have whitespace, and section titles).
- This is not parsed as latex, so you should just use unicode characters (i.e., `\'e` should be `é`).

You might also be interested in #17442.
