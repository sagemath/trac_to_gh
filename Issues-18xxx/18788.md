Proposal: Make /build the root for the `sage_bootstrap` Python module
* /build/sage_bootstrap/...
* /build/setup.py
* /build/tox.ini
* /build/bin/sage-package
* /build/bin/sage-spkg

Keep the current package metadata at 
* /build/pkgs/...

Move the makefile stuff to
* /build/make/Makefile
* /build/make/deps
* /build/make/pipestatus
* /build/make/install
* /build/make/...

For the record: I don't think makefiles are a hack. The current system surely is far from perfect, but it actually does work pretty well.

I don't think this commit should be on this ticket, but on a separate blocker ticket with just this one commit.

Also: don't you test building from scratch when closing a ticket?

For the record, I'm only doing incremental builds for each ticket on the buildbot. In addition, there is a weekly full build.

You can review both tickets at the same time if the location of `sage_bootstrap` irks you.

So the fact that one ticket changing the build system breaks it proves that it's not reliable?

What do you want, a build system that is impossible to break when changing it?
