In #18356, is implemented an algorithm for computing the composed sum, difference, product and division of two polynomials. That can be used to fasten exactification in QQbar.

See also #17886.

---
From the older description

Here is an example in which a fast algorithm for resultants makes a difference in timings:

```
sage: from sage.calculus.calculus import minpoly
sage: ex = solve(x^4 + x^3 + sqrt(2)*x + 1 == 0, x)[0].rhs()
sage: time minpoly(ex, algorithm='algebraic')
Wall time: 6.81 s
x^8 + 2*x^7 + x^6 + 2*x^4 + 2*x^3 - 2*x^2 + 1
```

in commit 12a1053f78c9efee9f3e6c88eb2c1c89d2db4312
it takes 31s; the difference in timings is in the computation of resultants.

Depends on #17886

Hello,

This ticket is still in state "new" but here are some remarks.

I would make this ticket independent of #17886 and ignore completely the potential application to `QQbar` (considering it in another ticket). It would be more flexible that way.

You implemented functions but I guess some of them would better be methods over polynomials (that is methods of `polynomial.polynomial_element.Polynomial`). For example, the `hadamard_product` or even the `composed_sum`. So move them. For `_hadamard_exp` it is only well defined in zero characteristic, so I am not sure what is the most appropriate; what do you think?

Did you do some serious benchmark to see which methods is faster depending on `p1` and `p2`? I guess it might aslo depends on the sparseness of the polynomials, the size of the coefficients.

1. `newton_sum`

   - I would rather add the power series ring object `R` as an argument. Building a ring is always costly.

   - In

```
p2 = R(QQ(1)/p1)
```
  You would better do

```
p2 = ~R(p1)
```
  you would avoid computing `1/p1` in the fraction field.

- It would be faster to return `p3.truncate()` or `res.truncate()` instead of adding a truncation argument

- the argument name `typ` is horrible. Be more explicit about what it is. "a related expression" is not an explanation of the output!

2. In `hadamard_product` there is no need to build the list of coefficients. You can access the coefficients of a polynomial `p` through `p[i]`. So just do

```
def hadamard_product(p1, p2):
    R = p1.parent()
    return R([p1[i]*p2[i] for i in range(min(p1.degree(), p2.degree())+1)])
```
   (I recall that this function must move as a method of univariate polynomials)

3. `composed_product`

   - you duplicated the code for `BFSS`... moreover if the argument `algorithm` is neither `"resultant"` nor `"BFSS"` an error should be raised.

   - I guess that the resultant method works in any characteristic?

Sided note: the Bostan-Flajolet-Salvy-Schost deals with any characteristic. So it would be interesting to have a more general implementation.

Vincent

Hello Vincent,
I opened #18356 implementing `composed_sum` and `composed_product` in `polynomial_element.pyx`,
taking into account most of your comments.

"hadamard_exp" appears as a method raising an exception if the polynomial is not on rationals.

I suspect that `newton_sum` method is not efficient, and it might be somewhere else in
Sage. As long as it is called by `composed_sum`, the time spent in `newton_sum` is negligible.

There is a small benchmark test, confirming the fact that the "BFSS" algorithm is asymptotically faster.

I do not plan to look at the "BFSS" algorithm in any characteristics.

I do not think I will open another ticket before #18356 is merged, because I do not know how to
manage tickets depending on other tickets, or how to add the dependence on both #17886 and #18356.

Hi Mario,

What is the intersection between this ticket and #18356? I think from now it is better to discuss on #18356 right?

> I do not plan to look at the "BFSS" algorithm in any characteristics.

This is fine. Just add a `NOTE` somewhere like

```
.. NOTE::

    The BFSS algorithm could be implemented in any characteristic but it currently only works in characteristic zero (see paper XYZ).
```

Tickets depending on other tickets have two flavour:
- from the trac point of view, this is just logical order (you just have to fill the dependency field in the ticket description)
- from the git point of view, if X depends on Y, it means that the branch of Y is based on top of X

You are free to rebase git branch on other git branches. Or change the git branch on some ticket to some other branch.

Vincent
