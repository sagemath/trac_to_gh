<a id='comment:3'>Comment 3:</a>
Namely we return the basis as a family of generators.

Without patch:

```
sage: D4 = DescentAlgebra(QQ, 4).B()
sage: D4.algebra_generators()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
[...]
TypeError: 'NotImplementedType' object is not callable
```

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: P = PartitionAlgebra(1, x, R)
sage: P.algebra_generators()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
[..]
Error: 'NotImplementedType' object is not callable
```

With patch:

```
sage: D4 = DescentAlgebra(QQ, 4).B()
sage: D4.algebra_generators()
Lazy family (Term map from Compositions of 4 to Descent algebra of 4 over Rational Field in the subset basis(i))_{i in Compositions of 4}
```

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: P = PartitionAlgebra(1, x, R)
sage: P.algebra_generators()
Finite family {{{-1, 1}}: P[{{-1, 1}}], {{-1}, {1}}: P[{{-1}, {1}}]}
```

It does not override specific class methods:

```
sage: A4 = SymmetricGroup(4).algebra(QQ)
sage: A4 in AlgebrasWithBasis(QQ)
True
sage: A4.algebra_generators()
Family ((1,2), (1,2,3,4))
```

Umm is it a "bug" from Algebras.Quotients ? Here is the line to get the algebra generators of the quotient:

```
return self.ambient().algebra_generators().map(self.retract)
```
and we get generators that are `0`...

But this methods should have been called instead of the newly implemented one, am I missing something ?

Oops, I see what was the issue! There was a conflict when I concurrently pushed my branch to trac and commented on the ticket, and I accidently reset the branch to the previous one.
We were lucky that the old one did not work so that this got noticed!

This is fixed now. So back to positive review. Sorry for the mess Volker!
