We implement several missing features of sets, enumerated sets and their cartesian products.

We add methods `is_empty` and `is_finite` to all sets.

We implement most of the methods for cartesian products of sets and enumerated sets (cardinality, rank/unrank, iteration).

For example, all commands below were hanging

```
sage: C = cartesian_product([Permutations(7), Permutations(9)])
sage: C.cardinality()
1828915200
sage: C.unrank(143872745)
([1, 5, 3, 6, 2, 4, 7], [5, 3, 2, 4, 7, 8, 9, 6, 1])
sage: C.rank(_)
143872745
sage: C.random_element()   # random
([4, 2, 6, 7, 1, 3, 5], [4, 7, 2, 8, 6, 3, 9, 5, 1])
```

then it is considered as a doctest!!

The algorithm used to detect doctests is clearly wrong!

For the first two, we might not want to call `cardinality` as this can easily lead to loop (e.g. #18400). As a rationale: a less specialized method should not try to call a more specialized one. For random_element: adding an optional abstract method would pollute the namespace.\n\n- unrank: `IndexError` is what is uniformly in `categories/*` and also in `combinat/cartesian_product`.\n- I moved is_empty from `Magmas.FinitelyGenerated.Unital.ParentMethods.is_empty` to `Magmas.Unital.is_empty` and everything looks fine\n- random_element: tuple removed\n\nI will add a second commit for `order` vs `cardinality` in `Groups`.\n\nVincent\n\n---\nNew commits:\n<table><tr><td><a href=\"https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/6389ff27cbcfcc1d51f2b6ad346c79ccd7eebbe3\">6389ff2</a></td><td><code>Trac 18290: reviewer comments</code></td></tr></table>\n",

<a id='comment:31'>Comment 31:</a>
As we discussed on the phone with Nicolas: I removed the abstract methods: `is_empty`, `is_finite` and `random_element` from `Sets`. For the first two, we might not want to call `cardinality` as this can easily lead to loop (e.g. #18400). As a rationale: a less specialized method should not try to call a more specialized one. For random_element: adding an optional abstract method would pollute the namespace.

- unrank: `IndexError` is what is uniformly in `categories/*` and also in `combinat/cartesian_product`.
- I moved is_empty from `Magmas.FinitelyGenerated.Unital.ParentMethods.is_empty` to `Magmas.Unital.is_empty` and everything looks fine
- random_element: tuple removed

I will add a second commit for `order` vs `cardinality` in `Groups`.

Hello,

For `cardinality` vs `order` here is the list of files I had to change:

- algebras/quatalg/quaternion_algebra.py
- algebras/steenrod/steenrod_algebra.py
- groups/abelian_gps/abelian_group.py
- groups/abelian_gps/dual_abelian_group.py
- groups/additive_abelian/additive_abelian_group.py
- groups/group.pyx
- groups/indexed_free_group.py
- groups/matrix_gps/coxeter_group.py
- groups/old.pyx
- groups/pari_group.py
- groups/perm_gps/permgroup.py
- groups/semimonomial_transformations/semimonomial_transformation_group.py
- libs/coxeter3/coxeter.pyx
- modular/abvar/finite_subgroup.py
- modular/abvar/torsion_subgroup.py
- modular/arithgroup/arithgroup_generic.py
- modular/dirichlet.py
- rings/contfrac.py
- rings/finite_rings/finite_field_base.pyx
- rings/finite_rings/finite_field_ext_pari.py
- rings/finite_rings/finite_field_givaro.py
- rings/finite_rings/finite_field_ntl_gf2e.py
- rings/finite_rings/finite_field_prime_modn.py
- rings/finite_rings/homset.py
- rings/finite_rings/integer_mod_ring.py
- rings/integer_ring.pyx
- rings/number_field/galois_group.py
- rings/number_field/morphism.py
- rings/number_field/number_field.py
- rings/polynomial/infinite_polynomial_ring.py
- rings/polynomial/polynomial_quotient_ring.py
- rings/qqbar.py
- rings/rational_field.py
- rings/ring.pyx

In particular it concerns not only groups but:
- (multiplicative) groups
- additive (Abelian) groups
- rings

At least Sage is able to start but I am not sure it fits exactly the purpose of the ticket. If you do not mind I will push that commit in #18410.

;-) I agree with Nathann that it is perhaps not the best default. Though, let us keep it independent of this ticket. My motivation for the rationale was to avoid loops like

- is_finite asks cardinality
- cardinality asks is_finite before starting to iterate

(which is exactly the problem with projective scheme).

On the other hand, there is sometimes nothing else to do than going through the list of elements to get the cardinality. And you know it: `sage.graphs.independent_sets.IndependentSets`.

This is exactly what I did:

```
class EnumeratedSets:
    class ParentMethods:
        def is_empty(self):
            try:
                iter(self).next()
            except StopIteration:
                return False
            else:
                return True
```

- In `CartesianProduct._cartesian_product_of_elements`, it would be semantically equivalent to use `zip` rather than `iterator.izip` since we anyway build a tuple right after. Just curious, is one faster than the other in practice (it's a tradeoff between building a list for nothing and using another layer of iterators)?

- Please update the documentation of `Sets.CartesianProducts.ParentMethods._cartesian_product_of_elements` to specify that it should accept any iterable.

- _sets_keys(): do we really want an `IntegerRange` rather than a `range`? I would imagine `IntegerRange` could be faster for containment testing and slower for iteration, so again a tradeoff.

In any cases, I'll be busy all day and don't have a strong opinion on either of the above points. So please make the choice you feel right. And then I consider this as good to go.

Thanks Vincent for all the work!

I think this is fine. I would find it strange to import it in `sage.categories.*` but `sage.sets.cartesian_product` is lazily imported.

Here you are not building the list from the pairs `(c,x)` but by calling `c(x)`. So I guess that `izip` is always better. From the timing it is very similar and `izip` gets much better as the size of the lists increase. (moreover in `Python 3` the `izip` is just deleted and `zip` becomes `izip`).

done.

> - _sets_keys(): do we really want an `IntegerRange` rather than a `range`? I would imagine `IntegerRange` could be faster for containment testing and slower for iteration, so again a tradeoff.

It is **much** faster for containment test and it is currently the only way it is used in `sage.sets.cartesian_product` (the method `cartesian_projection`). If the iteration is slower, then we should just make it faster in `IntegerRange`!

>  In any cases, I'll be busy all day and don't have a strong opinion on either of the above points. So please make the choice you feel right. And then I consider this as good to go.

I am running the long tests and will set positive review if everything is fine.
