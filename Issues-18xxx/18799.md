`2to3` proposes changes for

```
raise E, V, T -> raise E(V).with_traceback(T)
raise E, None, T -> raise E.with_traceback(T)
```
These changes are invalid (see also #18796).

Several options are given in the documentation of python-future (see http://python-future.org/compatible_idioms.html#raising-exceptions).

This ticket is tracked as a dependency of meta-ticket #16052.
The simple `raise` statements are fixed in #15990.
