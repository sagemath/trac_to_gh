This ticket implements the following syntactic sugar for functorial
construction categories::

```
    GradedModules(K)  ->  Modules(K).Graded()
    Modules.Graded(K) ->  Modules(K).Graded()
```
This makes them behave consistently with `CategoryWithAxiom`.

As is noted in the code, the internal logic is very similar, but there
seemed at this point to be no good way to avoid the duplication.

The first syntactic sugar was actually already partially implemented
for `GradedModulesCategory`, so half of the work is just generalizing
existing code.

The syntactic sugar is not valid for construction categories that take
extra arguments like `Algebras`, since there is no generic way to
decide what the argument should be used for:

```
    Sets.Algebras(K)  ->   Sets(K).Algebras() or Sets().Algebras(K) ?
```
