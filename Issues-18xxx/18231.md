The problem is in the code which looks like the following

```
def test1():
    K = QuadraticField(2)
    for _ in range(100):
        i = randint(2,3)
        j = randint(2,3)
        m = matrix(K, i, j, range(i*j))
```
It causes the various matrix spaces to rebuilt almost each time! If we compare with

```
def test2():
    K = QuadraticField(2)
    M = {(i,j): MatrixSpace(K,i,j) for i in range(2,4) for j in range(2,4)}
    for _ in range(100):
        i = randint(2,3)
        j = randint(2,3)
        m = M[i,j](range(i*j))
```
then we got

```
sage: %timeit test1()
10 loops, best of 3: 55 ms per loop
sage: %timeit test2()
100 loops, best of 3: 6.49 ms per loop
```

This is one of the reasons why the creation of Polyhedron is so slow (see #18213). (This has now improved since the creation of the ticket)

In the branch we:
- replace some old Cython code in `matrix_generic_dense` and `matrix0` and do some optimization
- move the function `_get_matrix_class` in `MatrixSpace` out of the class (as it depends only on the base ring and the sparseness)
- In the class `MatrixSpace` the argument `__matrix_class` is now `_matrix_class`. That way, it is possible in other part of Sage to optimize the creation of matrices by calling directly

```
sage: M = MatrixSpace(ZZ,3,2)
sage: M._matrix_class([1,5,3,-1,2,3], coerce=False, copy=False)
```
- we simplify the main element constructor of matrix, namely `MatrixSpace.matrix` and gain a significant speedup.

I only did some cleanup in `matrix_space.py` and `matrix_generic_dense.pyx`. And there is a substantial gain in speed! The tiny modification in #18213 to `NumberField.__cmp__` actually makes a much bigger difference.

I did not solve the problem of the matrix space being rebuilt every time.

Hello Vincent,

In this branch you create functions, remove others, and change a lot of code. There is still a lot of guessing to do on the reviewer's part.

It would be really cool if you could be more verbose about what you do. Really.

I began to read the first commit, and I have several more specific questions:

- You modify a function which takes a `MonoidElement` as input, which you immeditely cast with `cdef Matrix right = _right`. Either it is a matrix and it should not read `MonoidElement` in the first place, or it is not a `Matrix` and you cannot cast it?..

- This is cool and everything to gain miliseconds, but that's not a good way to write public code
  {{{
-        matrix.Matrix.__init__(self, parent)
+        # the four lines below avoid the following call
+        # matrix.Matrix.__init__(self, parent)
+        self._parent = parent
+        res._ncols  = parent.ncols()
+        res._nrows  = parent.nrows()
+        R = res._base_ring = parent.base_ring()
  }}}
  If the main constructor does not do what you want ty to change it. What if somebody adds a new parameter to matrix? The code has to be copy/pasted in every single function that did not want to call `__init__`?

- Why?
  {{{

     cdef set_unsafe(self, Py_ssize_t i, Py_ssize_t j, value):
-        Py_DECREF(<object>PyList_GET_ITEM(self._entries, i*self._ncols + j))
-        Py_INCREF(value)
-        PyList_SET_ITEM(self._entries, i*self._ncols + j, value)
+        self._entries[i*self._ncols + j] = value
 
     cdef get_unsafe(self, Py_ssize_t i, Py_ssize_t j):
-        return <object>PyList_GET_ITEM(self._entries, i*self._ncols + j)
+        return self._entries[i*self._ncols + j]
  }}}

Hello Nathann,

Thanks for having a look.

Replying to [ncohen](#comment%3A3):
> In this branch you create functions, remove others, and change a lot of code. There is still a lot of guessing to do on the reviewer's part.

> It would be really cool if you could be more verbose about what you do. Really.


I made a big effort to separate the commit at least! It is now in the description of the ticket.

> I began to read the first commit, and I have several more specific questions:
> 
> - You modify a function which takes a `MonoidElement` as input, which you immeditely cast with `cdef Matrix right = _right`. Either it is a matrix and it should not read `MonoidElement` in the first place, or it is not a `Matrix` and you cannot cast it?..


No choice. This is a cdef function defined in `structure.element.Element` and you can not change the signature in children classes. I thought it was more readable this way.

> - This is cool and everything to gain miliseconds, but that's not a good way to write public code
>   If the main constructor does not do what you want ty to change it. What if somebody adds a new parameter to matrix? The code has to be copy/pasted in every single function that did not want to call `__init__`?


All right. But then there is something wrong in the docstring of `matrix0.Matrix`

```
    def __init__(...):
        ...
        Subclasses of ``Matrix`` can safely skip calling
        ``Matrix.__init__`` provided they take care of initializing these
        attributes themselves.
        ...
```

> - Why?


All this was just old Cython code at the time Cython was not able to understand `l[i]` when `l` is a `cdef list`.

Thanks

Oh, okay!

Hmmmm.... Can you at least observe the difference? All that this `__init__` function does is precisely what you do. Can you measure this function call when your function copies lists around? `O_o`
