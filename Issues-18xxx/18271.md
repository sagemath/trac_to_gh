SemistandardTableaux_shape.cardinality() computes the cardinality by summing over all the weight vectors that sum to the max_entry.  If the max entry is much larger than 10, this becomes very slow.  Stanley's hook content formula  (EC2 vol 2 corollary 7.21.4) is a much more efficient way of computing the same number.

You could try something like this:

        res *= Integer(self.max_entry + j -i) / (l + conj[j] - i - j - 1)

Thanks.
The reason I abandoned that first commit was that  it was running into exactly that problem.
Sometimes SemistandardTableaux([2,1,1,1], max_entry=5).cardinality() would return 24 (correct) and sometimes it would return 12 (incorrect).

Some timings.
Algorithms)
sum:  This is the current algorithm that sums over the weights
hook: (default) This is the implementation that computes the hook_lengths and contents directly and sums the numerator and denominator separately.
hook2:  This lets the Partition object compute the hook lengths and the contents of the cells and does the summation in QQ
hook3: This is the same as hook, but does the summation in QQ .

sage: t1 = SemistandardTableaux([2,1,1,1], max_entry=5)
sage: t2 = SemistandardTableaux([4,3,2,1], max_entry=12)
sage: timeit("t1.cardinality(algorithm='sum')")
125 loops, best of 3: 5.31 ms per loop
sage: timeit("t1.cardinality()")
625 loops, best of 3: 41.8 µs per loop
sage: timeit("t1.cardinality(algorithm='hook2')")
625 loops, best of 3: 198 µs per loop
sage: timeit("t1.cardinality(algorithm='hook3')")
625 loops, best of 3: 66.2 µs per loop
sage: timeit("t2.cardinality(algorithm='sum')")
5 loops, best of 3: 33.4 s per loop
sage: timeit("t2.cardinality()")
625 loops, best of 3: 52.7 µs per loop
sage: timeit("t2.cardinality(algorithm='hook2')")
625 loops, best of 3: 409 µs per loop
sage: timeit("t2.cardinality(algorithm='hook3')")
625 loops, best of 3: 74.8 µs per loop


It appears that summing the numerator and denominator separately is the fastest way to do things, at least for reasonable size problems.  It also appears that the hook length formula is already two orders of magnitude faster than what we have now for small problems.

Although letting the partition object compute the hook lengths and contents leads to marginally clearer code, it is noticeably slower, and the direct computation is not very complicated, I think that it is best to go with the marginally more complicated code.
