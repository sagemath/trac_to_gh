```
Starting with 6.8beta8, these two doctests :

```
sage -t --long --warn-long 65.9 src/sage/groups/perm_gps/permgroup_named.py  # 2 doctests failed
sage -t --long --warn-long 65.9 src/sage/tests/gap_packages.py  # 1 doctest failed
```
fail with `database_gap` installed but succeed after installation of `gap_packages`.

This is fixed in https://github.com/sagemath/sage/pull/43

I wonder if there is a way to unify this with the branch to be reported on the ticket (well, hopefully this is not necessary).

Has anybody checked that the problem is really that those doctests themselves are the problem? i.e. do `make distclean`, install `database_gap` and check the doctests...
