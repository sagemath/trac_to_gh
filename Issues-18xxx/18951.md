There have been many questions about this (e.g. http://ask.sagemath.org/question/8472/problems-with-sagetex-under-texshop/ and http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/229473/having-trouble-getting-sagetex-working) and it's time we did something about it.

Unfortunately, I don't know that the author of TeXShop has any connection to Sage.  See [these release notes](http://pages.uoregon.edu/koch/texshop/changes_3.html) and the "About Sage.pdf" file included with TeXShop for how they do it.  ([These notes](http://faculty.essex.edu/~bannon/sp/sagetextexshop.pdf) from a Sage user seem to more or less encapsulate this as well.)

There seem to be two types of issues.  One is with TeXShop even finding `sagetex.sty`, and that seems to be PATH-related while in TeXShop - perhaps similar in nature to issues people have had on Linux or even the Windows 'app', though more hermetic due to Mac's closing off of the system.  The other is with getting things to happen automatically and exactly how to move the `.engine` file to the right place in TeXShop (and I suppose also what to do with upgrades of TeXShop).

Finally, a good explanation of what to do when upgrading Sage (i.e. how to tell whether you need to upgrade SageTeX and how to do it) would be good here too.

Ideally more detailed instructions should be made fairly robust, at least for those with Mountain Lion and above.
