Infinite affine crystals should use the extended weight lattice. This would include both B(infinity) crystals and crystals of integrable representations.

Here is an example.

```
sage: C = crystals.infinity.NakajimaMonomials(['A',1,1])
sage: v=C.highest_weight_vector()
sage: v.f(1).weight()+v.f(0).weight()
0
```

The answer should be `-delta`. The problem is that the extended weight lattice is not being used.

My proposal is to change the default value for the weight lattice to be the extended version by default since it would have the proper dimension and is the more natural thing to do weight computations in. As a result, we should create a new category for U<sub>q</sub>'(g)-crystals which uses the non-extended weight lattice. This would give us:

- greater flexibility long-term to implement generic methods for things like energy, R-matrices, and perfectness,
- better support once I patch up morphisms (#15463), and
- allow us to fix a (IMO) hack in the default plotting options of 0 arrows of not reversing them by checking if a crystal is not in the category of highest weight crystals.

At least to fix this ticket, I don't think there would be much work. However it would be a backwards-incompatible change; although I think it would be mild.

There may be cases where one does not want the extended weight lattice. For example Kirillov-Reshetikhin crystals, I think it would complicate things if you used the extended weight lattice.

This is addressed by Travis' proposal since he would create a new category for finite crystals that use the non-extended weight lattice.

The alternative way of fixing things would be to find the places where the wrong weight lattice is created (for example in the !__classcall_private!__ method o `InfinityCrystalOfNakajimaMonomials` and add `extended=True` to the parameters of `weight_lattice`. Both ways would fix the problem.

One question is whether we more often than not want affine weight lattices to be extended. I myself do. So I would support Travis' proposal but I am pointing out that there is an alternative.

Okay, here's a rough draft of my proposal that mostly works. I would like some feedback, in particular from Nicolas on the change of the behavior and the reorganization of the code. There also seems to be a subtle issue with subclassing and `@cached_method` (with my branch):

```
sage: P = RootSystem(['A',3,1]).weight_lattice()
sage: P.fundamental_weight('delta')
delta
sage: P.fundamental_weights()
Finite family {0: Lambda[0], 1: Lambda[1], 2: Lambda[2], 3: Lambda[3]}
```
Restart Sage and do

```
sage: P = RootSystem(['A',3,1]).weight_lattice()
sage: P.fundamental_weights()
Finite family {0: Lambda[0], 1: Lambda[1], 2: Lambda[2], 3: Lambda[3]}
sage: P.fundamental_weight('delta') # This is now the method of the base class!!!
...
ValueError: delta is not in the index set
```
I have no idea about why this occurs, much less how to fix this.

However it does not actually fix the problem noted on this ticket as we compute the weight by `Phi - Epsilon`. I've fixed this directly for LS paths (to which we need to be much more careful with the category) and rigged configurations. For Nakajima monomials, I'm not quite sure how to fix it. I really don't want to special case the affine types. In Kang et al., they construct B(\infty) by the path realization, and so I think they consider it as a U'<sub>q</sub>(**g**)-crystal (and so is in the non-extended weight lattice).

(Additionally, the weight function isn't correct for the Kyoto path model either, but that is a separate issue.)

Hi Travis,

littelmann_paths and generalized_young_walls are fixed. Ben is working on monomials to get the hyperbolic cases working. Could you fix the rigged configuration crystals by implementing the correct weight and weight_lattice_realization? In this ticket we do not want to revamp all the root_system stuff that you added in your previous patch and the category changes for KR crystals.

Thanks!

Anne

I've fixed the rigged configurations

- `CrystalOfAlcovePaths` fails outright:

```
sage: C = crystals.AlcovePaths(La[0])
sage: C
Highest weight crystal of alcove paths of type ['A', 1, 1] and weight Lambda[0]
sage: C.module_generators[0].f_string([0,1])
((alpha[0], 0), (2*alpha[0] + alpha[1], 1))
sage: _.weight()
TypeError
```
- We should also explicitly implement a `weight_lattice_realization` for `DirectSumOfCrystals` similar to what we did for tensor products.
- We have to decide what we want to do with `KyotoPathModel` and if we want to consider it as a U<sub>q</sub>'-crystal or a U<sub>q</sub>-crystal. I think the former is what we should do considering it is a tensor product of U<sub>q</sub>'-crystals. In any case, we will probably have to do something special for this.
- We have a problem with not distinguishing between elements of the extended and non-extended affine weight lattices. In particular, this causes an issue with creating the highest weight crystals with the same weight but you accidentally first create it in the non-extended affine weight lattice.

```
sage: LaE = RootSystem(['A',2,1]).weight_space(extended=True).fundamental_weights()sage: La = RootSystem(['A',2,1]).weight_space().fundamental_weights()
sage: B = crystals.LSPaths(La[0])
sage: B2 = crystals.LSPaths(LaE[0])
sage: B is B2
True
```
I had changed `crystals.RiggedConfigurations` with inadvertantly triggered this. I don't think we want to enforce that the user must consider weights in the extended affine weight lattice as it is a valid restriction from U<sub>q</sub> to U<sub>q</sub>' (in particular, the Kyoto path model). IMO the solution would be for `__classcall__`/`__classcall_private__` to pass the weight lattice realization with the default to use the parent of the weight given. I feel this gives the user added flexibility for where they want the weights to be printed. Although part of me also thinks there should be some kind of option which could be changed in the method-input/classes/globally which specifies the weight lattice realization.

Mathematically speaking, the Kyoto path model is a model in the category of highest weight affine crystals. It is a U_q(g)-crystal not a U_q'(g) crystal. Really what one does it take tensor products `B^{r,s} \otimes u_\Lambda` with `\Lambda` of level `s`.

Ah, we do need the `weight_space`, so we should probably make it error out similar for the LS paths if we aren't in the weight space. Also it does work using the extended weight lattice:

```
sage: La = RootSystem(['A',2,1]).weight_space(extended=True).fundamental_weights()
sage: C = crystals.AlcovePaths(La[0])
sage: C.module_generators[0].f_string([0,1])
((alpha[0], 0), (alpha[0] + alpha[1], 0))
sage: _.weight()
-Lambda[1] + 2*Lambda[2] - delta
```

I agree that it is in highest weight affine crystals, but we don't have a way to get `\delta` from the elements. The embedding `B(\lambda) \to B^{r,s} \otimes B(\mu)` has to be as U_q'(g)-crystals as `B^{r,s}` must be a U_q'(g)-crystal as otherwise it breaks the condition for the weight function. Also if `\Lambda` is of level `s`, then `\Lambda + k\delta` is of level `s` for all `k` since `<c, \delta> = 0`. I still don't quite see how we could figure out what the coefficient of `\delta` is for an arbitrary element in the Kyoto path model.

I tried doing this using the path to the highest weight vector, but it causes a loop in Sage because of the way the crystal operators are defined in the monomial crystals model.

Right...I'm now fairly convinced it will be best to simply store the weight as an attribute of the elements. This might also result in a speedup as we wouldn't need to (re)compute the weight everytime we call `phi()`.

We have the following behavior in root systems (as Travis mentioned):

```
sage: R = RootSystem(['B',2,1])
sage: La = R.weight_space().basis()
sage: LaE = R.weight_space(extended=True).basis()
sage: La[0] == LaE[0]
True
sage: La[0].parent() == LaE[0].parent()
False
```
This yields to the behavior that LS paths labeled by extended fundamental weights and nonextended ones are considered to be the same crystal. Should we fix the weight issue or pass another (fake) argument in the init method to distinguish the crystals?

Nicolas, do you have an opinion on the above?

I would if I could … I pulled the branch, built and can't run it it because of some problem with ascii_art. I'll make distclean and try again.

I'm a little worried that if the changes required replacing the inner product in weyl_dimension method there could also be failures in weyl_characters.py too which also depend on the same inner product.

Strange. It works for both myself and Ben.

The only problem with it was that it only worked for the ambient space and we want it for all weight lattices. If that is not an issue for weyl_character, then it hopefully does not change anything there!

<a id='comment:44'></a>
From the thematic tutorial at http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/thematic_tutorials/lie/affine_hw_crystals.html
we have:

```
sage: sage: La = RootSystem(['C',3,1]).weight_space().fundamental_weights()
sage: sage: LS = crystals.LSPaths(2*La[1]+La[2])
sage: sage: SL = LS.subcrystal(max_depth=3)
sage: sage: GL = LS.digraph(subset=SL)
sage: sage: La = RootSystem(['C',3,1]).weight_lattice().fundamental_weights()
sage: sage: M = crystals.NakajimaMonomials(['C',3,1], 2*La[1]+La[2])
sage: sage: SM = M.subcrystal(max_depth=3)
sage: sage: GM = M.digraph(subset=SM)
sage: sage: GL.is_isomorphic(GM, edge_labels=True)
True
```

Why do we use weight_space for one and weight_lattice for the other? (Maybe the thematic tutorial should explain.)

After this:

```
sage: LS.weight_lattice_realization().is_extended()
False
sage: M.weight_lattice_realization().is_extended()
True
```

I think the point of the example in the tutorial is that the two crystals are isomorphic, but one uses the extended lattice and the other does not.

I think that the user should be encouraged to use extended lattice for crystals of integrable representations of affine Lie algebras and therefore the example in the thematic tutorial should be changed. The tutorial goes on and shows another affine crystal in the Littelmann path model that does use the extended lattice. I think the patch is good but it would be good if some revisions to the above page in the thematic tutorial are made. Here are some suggestions for change to the tutorial that could be part of this patch.

(1) Change the first example to use the extended lattice unless there is a reason not to.
(2) Tell the user just a bit more about the issue. The following is my understanding: roughly, the extended lattice is the weight lattice of the full Kac-Moody Lie algebra and the unextended lattice is the weight lattice of the derived algebra.  If the highest weight is a nonzero dominant weight then the crystal is infinite and it is preferrable to use the extended lattice. These are the crystals of integrable representations. A contrasting situation is with Kirillov-Reshetikhin crystals where there is an advantage to working with the unextended lattice, namely that the derived algebra has a finite dimensional crystal where the full Kac-Moody Lie algebra has an infinite one. So there is an advantage in this case to using the derived Lie algebra and its weight lattice is the unextended one.
(3) Explain why we use weight_space in the LS path model but weight_lattice in the monomial model.

Hi Dan,

Good points! I fixed the examples in the thematic tutorial (and also the picture since it was missing the deltas as well) and put some extra explanations.

Here's the problem:

```
sage: La = RootSystem(['A',2,1]).weight_space().basis()
sage: LS = crystals.ProjectedLevelZeroLSPaths(2*La[1])
sage: LS.weight_lattice_realization()
Weight space over the Rational Field of the Root system of type ['A', 2, 1]
sage: CS = LS.one_dimensional_configuration_sum()
sage: CS
B[-2*Lambda[1] + 2*Lambda[2]] + (q+1)*B[-Lambda[1]] + (q+1)*B[Lambda[1] - Lambda[2]] + B[2*Lambda[1]] + B[-2*Lambda[2]] + (q+1)*B[Lambda[2]]
sage: K = crystals.KirillovReshetikhin(['A',2,1], 1,1)
sage: T = K.tensor(K)
sage: CSK = T.one_dimensional_configuration_sum()
sage: CSK
B[-2*Lambda[1] + 2*Lambda[2]] + (q+1)*B[-Lambda[1]] + (q+1)*B[Lambda[1] - Lambda[2]] + B[2*Lambda[1]] + B[-2*Lambda[2]] + (q+1)*B[Lambda[2]]
sage: CS == CSK
False
sage: CS.parent()
Group algebra of the Weight space over the Rational Field of the Root system of type ['A', 2] over Univariate Polynomial Ring in q over Rational Field
sage: CSK.parent()
Group algebra of the Weight lattice of the Root system of type ['A', 2] over Univariate Polynomial Ring in q over Rational Field
sage: CS.parent().has_coerce_map_from(CSK.parent())
False
```
The group algebra, by its functoriality, should have a coercion when the underlying groups have a coercion:

```
sage: CS.parent()._indices.has_coerce_map_from(CSK.parent()._indices)
True
```
This is now #18700.

This got me curious about my memory failing. Digging back in history ended up in a mercurial patch from early 2008 from which one can't extract the author. As far as I remember, I refactored this code at different occasions (in the above to move it from
weight_lattice_realization to weight_lattice_realizations when
creating the categories), but the original code was by Dan in the `WeylDim` function. Anyway just ranting this has no relevance.
