The code introduced in ticket:18591 fails on some `LinearMatroid`. 

Consider the following examples

```
sage: M = Matroid(Matrix([[1,0,0,0,1,0,0],
[0,1,0,0,0,1,0],
[0,0,1,0,0,1,1],
[0,0,0,1,1,0,1]]))
sage: M2 = Matroid(circuits=[[2, 3, 5, 6],
[0, 1, 2, 3, 5],
[2, 3, 4],
[0, 1, 6],
[0, 1, 4, 5],
[4, 5, 6]])
sage: set(M.components()) # the components share an element
{frozenset({1, 2, 5, 6}), frozenset({0, 3, 4, 6})}
sage: set(M2.components())
{frozenset({0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6})}
sage: M2.is_isomorphic(M)
True
sage: set(M.components()) # strange, the result become correct after isomorphism testing
{frozenset({0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6})}
```

Hi Chao,

Somehow I had overlooked the fact that there exists a command for testing if two bitsets intersect when I wrote this method. 
And so cooked up a fiddly method for checking bitset intersection. Surely that is the problem. It apparently fails to detect the intersection when it happens only at the last element. 

I'll upload a fix as soon as Sage is compiled.

Cheers,
Rudi

Hmm, something else was subtly wrong: the order in which I checked intersections did not guarantee that the final set was a partition. I now use the same order as Matroid.components() again.

```
sage: M = Matroid(Matrix([[1,0,0,0,1,0,0],
[0,1,0,0,0,1,0],
[0,0,1,0,0,1,1],
[0,0,0,1,1,0,1]]))
sage: list(M.components())
[frozenset({0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6})]
sage: M = Matroid(MatrixSpace(GF(2), 500,1000).random_element())
sage: timeit("M.components()")
625 loops, best of 3: 210 Âµs per loop
```
