The `polylog` function (from Pynac) treats `1.0` like `1` and does not immediately `evalf` with some numeric arguments. 

```
sage: polylog(2,1)
1/6*pi^2
sage: polylog(2.,1)
1.64493406684823
sage: polylog(2,1.0)
1/6*pi^2
sage: polylog(2,0.9)
polylog(2, 0.900000000000000)
sage: _.n()
TypeError: cannot evaluate symbolic expression numerically
```
What makes `polylog` different is that the Sage `polylog` has no special value logic and calls Pynac's `Li_eval` for everything. This handles special values (incorrectly if an arg is FP) and sends everything else back with `.hold()`. So you need `N()` to get FP results that are not special. With FP  Pynac is called which then calls Sage/mpmath. But this then bombs with FP args.

Ralf, there was a typo in the description of #21034 pointing to #18368 rather than this ticket.

I'm finding this behavior odd:

```
sage: polylog(2,.9999999999999999)
1.64493406684822
sage: polylog(2,1.)
NaN - NaN*I
```

This doesn't look fixed upstream to me: `evalf` needs to return a numeric value.

The doctest in `functions/log.py` captures the current behavior, but needs to be updated before this ticket can be closed.

Polylog has a branch point/discontinuity at arguments (2,1). Anyway, we're just taking what arb is giving us:

```
sage: RBF=ComplexBallField(53)
sage: RBF(1.5).polylog(RBF(2.5))
[2.27833425640 +/- 2.25e-12] + [-0.61016023975 +/- 3.09e-12]*I
sage: RBF(.99999999).polylog(RBF(2.))
[1.6449338726414 +/- 9.23e-14] + [+/- 2.46e-13]*I
sage: RBF(1.).polylog(RBF(2.))
nan + nan*I
sage: RBF(1.00000001).polylog(RBF(2.))
[1.644934261055 +/- 1.08e-13] + [-3.1416e-8 +/- 3.19e-13]*I
sage: polylog(2,1)
1/6*pi^2
```
This is very sensible because if you need the exact value say so, and if you need an inexact value to 53 (or any) digits the result cannot be given in that precision so it's NaN. I'll concede that, similar to #19439 it may be desired to return the symbolic NaN.

Evalf does return a numeric value, too:

```
sage: polylog(2,1.0).n()
NaN - NaN*I
sage: type(_)
<type 'sage.rings.complex_number.ComplexNumber'>
```
so, together with my previous answer I think this ticket can be closed.
