Part of an effort to implement Jean-Baptiste Priez's external Combinatorial Hopf Algebra package into the Sage source code, began by the author in ticket #13793, and now being broken up into smaller component tickets.

This ticket adds a class for being 'connected' to the category of graded Hopf algebras with basis.

    "body": "<div id=\"comment:8\" align=\"right\">comment:8</div>\n\nWhen you compute `(1 tensor t + t tensor 1)^2`, there is a term `(1 tensor t) (t tensor 1)`. When these are multiplied, you have to apply the twist map (interchanging the middle two terms). That has a sign involved: `(-1)^{(deg t) (deg t)} = -1`. So you get a summand `- t tensor t` in the coproduct. This cancels with the term `(t tensor 1) (1 tensor t)`.\n\nThat is, in the main diagram defining a bialgebra, [like the first one here, for example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bialgebra), the twist map `\\tau` has a sign in the graded case.",

When you compute `(1 tensor t + t tensor 1)^2`, there is a term `(1 tensor t) (t tensor 1)`. When these are multiplied, you have to apply the twist map (interchanging the middle two terms). That has a sign involved: `(-1)^{(deg t) (deg t)} = -1`. So you get a summand `- t tensor t` in the coproduct. This cancels with the term `(t tensor 1) (1 tensor t)`.

That is, in the main diagram defining a bialgebra, [like the first one here, for example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bialgebra), the twist map `\tau` has a sign in the graded case.

(d) When I added the example to the categories section of the reference manual I noticed that the `finite_dimensional_algebras_with_basis` example was not in the list so I added it as well.
(e) I changed the name of the example Hopf algebra from `GradedConnectedHopfAlgebraOfInteger` to `GradedConnectedCombinatorialHopfAlgebraWithPrimitiveGenerator`.  We could yet add an example of a `GradedConnectedTopologicalHopfAlgebra` to the same file.
