Part of an effort to implement Jean-Baptiste Priez's external Combinatorial Hopf Algebra package into the Sage source code, began by the author in ticket #13793, and now being broken up into smaller component tickets.

This ticket adds a class for being 'connected' to the category of graded Hopf algebras with basis.

A typo: in the method `one_basis`: `EXAMPLES::r`. Delete the "r".

    "body": "<a id='comment:8'>Comment 8:</a>\nWhen you compute `(1 tensor t + t tensor 1)^2`, there is a term `(1 tensor t) (t tensor 1)`. When these are multiplied, you have to apply the twist map (interchanging the middle two terms). That has a sign involved: `(-1)^{(deg t) (deg t)} = -1`. So you get a summand `- t tensor t` in the coproduct. This cancels with the term `(t tensor 1) (1 tensor t)`.\n\nThat is, in the main diagram defining a bialgebra, [like the first one here, for example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bialgebra), the twist map `\\tau` has a sign in the graded case.",

When you compute `(1 tensor t + t tensor 1)^2`, there is a term `(1 tensor t) (t tensor 1)`. When these are multiplied, you have to apply the twist map (interchanging the middle two terms). That has a sign involved: `(-1)^{(deg t) (deg t)} = -1`. So you get a summand `- t tensor t` in the coproduct. This cancels with the term `(t tensor 1) (1 tensor t)`.

That is, in the main diagram defining a bialgebra, [like the first one here, for example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bialgebra), the twist map `\tau` has a sign in the graded case.

Missing an "r" at the beginning of the quotes for the docstring? If so, then the `\t` in `\times` would be interpreted as a tab, `\n` in `\neq` as a newline.
