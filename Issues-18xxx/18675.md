Part of an effort to implement Jean-Baptiste Priez's external Combinatorial Hopf Algebra package into the Sage source code, began by the author in ticket #13793, and now being broken up into smaller component tickets.

This ticket adds a class for being 'connected' to the category of graded Hopf algebras with basis.

I don't think that this is an axiom of graded connected Hopf algebras since most of the ones that I work with don't have this property (e.g. symmetric functions).  Can we call it a subcategory that satisfies the additional axiom that `f \otimes g = (-1)^{deg(f) deg(g)} g \otimes f`?

We seem to have two conflicting notions of what a graded Hopf algebra is. My version comes from topology and dates back to the 1950s. The version without the sign looks to be much more recent, mainly arising (as far as I can tell) in combinatorics. In \"[Hopf algebras in combinatorics](http://web.mit.edu/~darij/www/algebra/HopfComb-sols.pdf)\" by Grinberg and Reiner, they at least refer (Definition 1.11, equation (1.7)) to the sign, although they have decided to omit it, saying that one can artificially double all degrees to deal with this issue.\n\nI really will insist that this sign be one of the axioms of a graded Hopf algebra, unless you can provide citations that convince me otherwise.

We seem to have two conflicting notions of what a graded Hopf algebra is. My version comes from topology and dates back to the 1950s. The version without the sign looks to be much more recent, mainly arising (as far as I can tell) in combinatorics. In "[Hopf algebras in combinatorics](http://web.mit.edu/~darij/www/algebra/HopfComb-sols.pdf)" by Grinberg and Reiner, they at least refer (Definition 1.11, equation (1.7)) to the sign, although they have decided to omit it, saying that one can artificially double all degrees to deal with this issue.

I really will insist that this sign be one of the axioms of a graded Hopf algebra, unless you can provide citations that convince me otherwise. Your version could be called "unsigned", maybe? `UnsignedGradedHopfAlgebrasWithBasis`? `GradedUnsignedHopfAlgebrasWithBasis`?

I can't speak for all topologists, but when I've seen graded Hopf algebras, the sign convention has always been used.
