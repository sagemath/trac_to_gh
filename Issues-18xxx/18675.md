Part of an effort to implement Jean-Baptiste Priez's external Combinatorial Hopf Algebra package into the Sage source code, began by the author in ticket #13793, and now being broken up into smaller component tickets.

This ticket adds a class for being 'connected' to the category of graded Hopf algebras with basis.

I can't speak for all topologists, but when I've seen graded Hopf algebras, the sign convention has always been used.
