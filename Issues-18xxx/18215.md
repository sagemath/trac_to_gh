No idea. But it make sense. It was the previous implementation. I did not want to break anything.

On the other hand, it does not take the parent into account and 'sqrt(2) + 3/2' and 'sqrt(3) + 3/2' would have the same hash.

What do you think?

Hello,

Can you tell where this `42082631` comes from? Also, is it true that `mpz_pythonhash(self.b)` is zero when `self.b` is 0 ? It must hold if you want the hash of this element and the hash defined on Q to match.
