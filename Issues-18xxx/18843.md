This ticket implements tensor fields (among which vector fields and differential forms) on differentiable manifolds. This is a follow-up of #18783 within the [SageManifolds project](http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/) (see the metaticket #18528 for an overview). As in #18783, the non-discrete topological field K over which the differentiable manifold is defined is generic, although in most applications, K=**R** or K=**C**.

This ticket implements the following Python classes:

1/ Parent classes:
- `VectorFieldModule`: module of vector fields on a differentiable manifold
- `VectorFieldFreeModule`: free module of vector fields on a parallelizable differentiable manifold
- `TensorFieldModule`: module of tensor fields of a given type (k,l) on a differentiable manifold
- `TensorFieldFreeModule`: free module of tensor fields of a given type (k,l) on a parallelizable
  differentiable manifold
- `DiffFormModule`: module of differential forms of a given degree p (p-forms) on a differentiable
  manifold
- `DiffFormFreeModule`: free module of differential forms of a given degree p (p-forms) on a
  parallelizable differentiable manifold
- `AutomorphismFieldGroup`: general linear group of the module of vector fields on a differentiable
  manifold
- `AutomorphismFieldParalGroup`: general linear group of the free module of vector fields on a 
  parallelizable differentiable manifold

2/ Element classes:

- `TensorField`: tensor field on a differentiable manifold
  - `VectorField`: vector field on a differentiable manifold
  - `DiffForm`: p-form on differentiable manifold

  - `DiffFormParal`: p-form on parallelizable differentiable manifold
  - `AutomorphismFieldParal`: field of tangent-space automorphisms on a parallelizable differentiable
    manifold

3/ Other classes:

- `VectorFrame`: vector frame on a differentiable manifold
  - `CoordFrame`: coordinate vector frame on a differentiable manifold
- `CoFrame`: coframe (frame of 1-forms) on a differentiable manifold
  - `CoordCoFrame`: coordinate coframe on a differentiable manifold

Yes, this seems desirable. I'll try it.

Yes, certainly.

No problem. Sorry its taken so long. Hopefully I can make it through this soon.

However for the end user manipulating a lot of differential forms, it is certainly desirable to have a short name (in addition to TAB completion), as `diff` is a short name for `derivative`. We may even think of a shorter name, like `xd`, as a reminder of the standard mathematical notation **d**.


We currently have no `differential` function, just its shorten `diff`, which is the Sage equivalent for `derivative`. I am not opposed to having an `xder` alias, just importing it into the global namespace (by default) as it is not a "standard" short name. However, you could include the import of `xder` as part of the examples/tutorials. I do think that `xder` is okay as a method alias for `exterior_derivative` as well.

IMO `xd`, like `d`, is too short and generic to be useful at the top-level.

What about the SageMathCloud? It's certainly technically possible to define some `init.sage` there, but one has to open a terminal and edit a file, etc.

Also a drawback of `init.sage` is that your worksheets cannot easily be shared with somebody else, or made publicly available for repeating the calculation.

> I feel that one import to setup an environment with a convenience function is very little to ask. IMO, it is not good for the entry point `Manifold` to have side effects.


What about `Manifold.import_convenience_functions(verbose=True)` or something like this? It could 
(i) put functions like `xder` in the global namespace and (ii) print out the list of such functions if `verbose` is `True`.

For SMC worksheets, you can easily have the setup in an `%auto` block.

That is no different than doing a usual import. I guess a question that I have is how many such functions do you think there will eventually be?

In the same spirit, I have renamed `lie_der` to `lie_derivative` and set `lie_der` as an alias to it.

Actually `_rmul_` is already implemented in tensor fields and handles the scalar action. The current `__mul__` handles mostly the tensor product. Since this is an external operation (w.r.t. the parent module), I am not sure that it can be changed to some single underscore method within the coercion framework.

<a id='comment:52'></a>I (finally) made it through the code again, and most of my changes were smaller documentation cleanups and fixes. I changed some custom caching into ``@`cached_method` (IIRC it is faster) and separated out the zero element into `zero` (with ``@`cached_method`). If you're good with my changes, then we can set this to positive review (and hopefully sneak this into 7.4).

Thank you very much for your review and the changes in the code!

I've committed a few minor changes: besides fixing some documentation error (missing blank line),
- this reverts to the previous version of comparison to zero in `TensorField.__eq__`: indeed the following code in commit 7cf4ff4 

```
 if other == 0:
     return self.is_zero()
 elif other in ZZ:
     return False
```
  could return True for `a == b` with `a` being a zero vector, say, and `b` being a zero 2-form. We do not want this behavior, do we? We should only allow for the possibility to write `a == 0` as a shortcut for `a.is_zero()`.
