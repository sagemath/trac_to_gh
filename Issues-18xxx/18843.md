This ticket implements tensor fields (among which vector fields and differential forms) on differentiable manifolds. This is a follow-up of #18783 within the [SageManifolds project](http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/) (see the metaticket #18528 for an overview). As in #18783, the non-discrete topological field K over which the differentiable manifold is defined is generic, although in most applications, K=**R** or K=**C**.

This ticket implements the following Python classes:

1/ Parent classes:
- `VectorFieldModule`: module of vector fields on a differentiable manifold
- `VectorFieldFreeModule`: free module of vector fields on a parallelizable differentiable manifold
- `TensorFieldModule`: module of tensor fields of a given type (k,l) on a differentiable manifold
- `TensorFieldFreeModule`: free module of tensor fields of a given type (k,l) on a parallelizable
  differentiable manifold
- `DiffFormModule`: module of differential forms of a given degree p (p-forms) on a differentiable
  manifold
- `DiffFormFreeModule`: free module of differential forms of a given degree p (p-forms) on a
  parallelizable differentiable manifold
- `AutomorphismFieldGroup`: general linear group of the module of vector fields on a differentiable
  manifold
- `AutomorphismFieldParalGroup`: general linear group of the free module of vector fields on a 
  parallelizable differentiable manifold

2/ Element classes:

- `TensorField`: tensor field on a differentiable manifold
  - `VectorField`: vector field on a differentiable manifold
  - `DiffForm`: p-form on differentiable manifold
  - `AutomorphismField`: field of tangent-space automorphisms on a differentiable manifold
- `TensorFieldParal`: tensor field on a parallelizable differentiable manifold
  - `VectorFieldParal`: vector field on a parallelizable differentiable manifold
  - `DiffFormParal`: p-form on parallelizable differentiable manifold
  - `AutomorphismFieldParal`: field of tangent-space automorphisms on a parallelizable differentiable
    manifold

3/ Other classes:

- `VectorFrame`: vector frame on a differentiable manifold
  - `CoordFrame`: coordinate vector frame on a differentiable manifold
- `CoFrame`: coframe (frame of 1-forms) on a differentiable manifold
  - `CoordCoFrame`: coordinate coframe on a differentiable manifold

This is too long IMO, and we need to either find a way to speed things up or simplify the tests somehow (smaller manifolds perhaps?) so they don't take so long. One or two non-trivial top-level examples are good. For the doctests, it just needs to be small examples showing the functionality. For any more complicated examples needed to do a more complete test should either be relatively small (in terms of number of lines) and be marked as `# long time` or you need to have a separate file with the complete examples where most (all?) tests are marked as `# long time`.


OK I will try to shorten significantly the doctests.

I agree `xder` is not as descriptive as `exterior_derivative`. Certainly the latter should be the primary function name. However for the end user manipulating a lot of differential forms, it is certainly desirable to have a short name (in addition to TAB completion), as `diff` is a short name for `derivative`. We may even think of a shorter name, like `xd`, as a reminder of the standard mathematical notation **d**.

OK.

Yes, this seems desirable. I'll try it.

Yes, certainly.

We currently have no `differential` function, just its shorten `diff`, which is the Sage equivalent for `derivative`. I am not opposed to having an `xder` alias, just importing it into the global namespace (by default) as it is not a "standard" short name. However, you could include the import of `xder` as part of the examples/tutorials. I do think that `xder` is okay as a method alias for `exterior_derivative` as well.

IMO `xd`, like `d`, is too short and generic to be useful at the top-level.

What about the SageMathCloud? It's certainly technically possible to define some `init.sage` there, but one has to open a terminal and edit a file, etc.

Also a drawback of `init.sage` is that your worksheets cannot easily be shared with somebody else, or made publicly available for repeating the calculation.

What about `Manifold.import_convenience_functions(verbose=True)` or something like this? It could 
(i) put functions like `xder` in the global namespace and (ii) print out the list of such functions if `verbose` is `True`.

For SMC worksheets, you can easily have the setup in an `%auto` block.

By selecting simpler examples, the last commit decreases by a factor ~2 the doctest time of `tensorfield.py`. It's difficult to go below this because the manifold dimension is already at its minimum (for a non-parallelizable manifold): it is 2 for all tests.

`xder` is no longer in the global namespace. I've also suppressed `exterior_derivative`, but maybe we can restore the latter, as you suggest.

In the same spirit, I have renamed `lie_der` to `lie_derivative` and set `lie_der` as an alias to it.

Actually `_rmul_` is already implemented in tensor fields and handles the scalar action. The current `__mul__` handles mostly the tensor product. Since this is an external operation (w.r.t. the parent module), I am not sure that it can be changed to some single underscore method within the coercion framework. Note that we already had `__mul__` for handling tensor products in ` sage.tensor.modules.free_module_tensor.FreeModuleTensor`.

<a id='comment:47'></a>I checked out this commit with 7.4 beta0.  All of my Jupyter worksheets that use forms and vectors seem to work fine.  I would like to encourage you to include this functionality in Sage in the next possible release. I would give this a positive review except that the commit is still based on an older release of Sage and that milestone has passed.

Thanks for this update and your work on this.

Replying to [bpage](#comment%3A47): good to know that all your Jupyter worksheets passed. However, we should really wait for Travis detailed review before concluding with this ticket.

Thank you very much for your review and the changes in the code!

I've committed a few minor changes: besides fixing some documentation error (missing blank line),
- this reverts to the previous version of comparison to zero in `TensorField.__eq__`: indeed the following code in commit 7cf4ff4 

```
 if other == 0:
     return self.is_zero()
 elif other in ZZ:
     return False
```
  could return True for `a == b` with `a` being a zero vector, say, and `b` being a zero 2-form. We do not want this behavior, do we? We should only allow for the possibility to write `a == 0` as a shortcut for `a.is_zero()`.
