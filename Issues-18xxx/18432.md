We currently compute the charge of a rigged configuration `R` by taking the maximum cocharge over the entire set of rigged configurations and then subtracting `R.cocharge()`. Cocharge is constant on classical components, so it is sufficient to check this on classically highest weight elements (which are generated and stored in the `module_generators` attribute).
