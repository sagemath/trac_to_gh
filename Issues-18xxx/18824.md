This branch extends the feature added by #18926, so that creating thematic index of functions is more reliable. In particular, we are now sure that *all* methods of a class appear in the index (no risk to 'forget' one), and we can pick a category for each of them.

The interface is the result of a *LOT* of try-and-fail, and corner cases, and bad surprises. It is totally open to disccussion, but know that there may be a reason (i.e. a use-case) explaining which this part is written that way. I am not very proud of everything it does either.

But it will definitely help us.

Needs rebasing --> *needs_work*.

I won't review this because I don't know about Sphinx internals.

This patch clearly makes Sage better than it currently is, so I think this should be added. So this is just a suggestion: If we still have for example `is_chain_of_poset()` in the index, and not `is_chain_of_poset(elms)`, should it be possible to add different onliner to index than what is at the beginning of function? Like "Return True if given iterable is a chain of the poset." instead of "Return True if `elms` is a chain of the poset".

Yes, that sounds good. Without this second argument it could work just like now.

I compiled this and got strange results. `graph.html` starts with "Algorithmically hard stuff", i.e. uses alphabetical list. Should be possible to change it.

Then, it starts right with "<link>chromatic_number()</link>   Returns the minimal number of colors needed to color the vertices", i.e. forgetting the ending "of the graph G.". And next one is "<link>chromatic_polynomial()</link> chromatic_polynomial(G, return_tree_basis=False)".

Do others get similar results? Can be just some Spinx error and maybe I must recompile or something.

Hello,

> I compiled this and got strange results. `graph.html` starts with "Algorithmically hard stuff", i.e. uses alphabetical list. Should be possible to change it.


Yeah, I thought about a way to enforce an ordering. It is the kind of things that I expect we will have some day, but I did not think it so urgent that it needed to be implemented here. A lexicographic ordering is not so bad, really.

I did not notice, but I expect that you are right. I know how I wrote the code that extracts this text and it only takes 'the first line', not the first sentence. It is not related to this ticket thought, it's a code that is already in Sage.

I will probably write a fix for that today. I will add a comment here when I do.

What the hell `O_o`

```
sage: print Graph.chromatic_polynomial.__doc__
chromatic_polynomial(G, return_tree_basis=False)
File: sage/graphs/chrompoly.pyx (starting at line 28)

    Computes the chromatic polynomial of the graph G.

...
sage: print Graph.vertices.__doc__

        Return a list of the vertices.

Much better now.
I assume that we can let the ordering problem (starting with algorithmic hard stuff is not necessarily the best choice) for another patch.

Yep, I think so too. Or I can rename it to "NP-Hard problems" here if you prefer.

in the generated list for graph.py, I see:

For me this is acceptable but is this behavior expected?

It is only because the docstring of `strong_orientation` contains this additional line in its first paragraph. Can be solved by splitting it into two lines.

It seems to be complaining that `sage.misc.collections` is, after the patch, being imported per default on Sage startup, and this wasn't the case before. The import per default is done since `sage.misc.rest_index_of_methods` is being imported per default, and it includes a line to import the `sage.misc.collections`.

Sage takes a long time to start, and to try to not aggravate that in the future, the patchbot checks whether a patch will make new modules load at startup.

I presume that `sage.misc.rest_index_of_methods` more or less has to load at startup. And I assume that the `sage.misc.collections.defaultdict` is being used to good effect. In this case, the patchbot warning can just be ignored.

Best,
Johan
