```
Since Sage 6.6, the options passed to show() are not taken into account in 3D rendering:

```
sage: show(sphere(), figsize=10, frame=False, aspect_ratio=(1,1,0.5))
```
yields exactly the same result as

```
sage: show(sphere())
```

Hellooooooooooo,

The problem is fixed indeed, but the way this `_process_viewing_options` function works it only stores in `opt` the function that are actually used later. It is well implemented: your original dictionary has been stripped of what is now in 'opt', but as a result we get:

```
sage: show(sphere(), heyheyhey=35) # no problem
```

Could you raise an exception whenever `kwds` is not empty after `_process_viewing_options` reduced it? Sometimes you type `fgisize=4` and can look for a while before you notice what exactly is going wrong.

Thanks,

Nathann

Hello,

> show shouldn't validate keyword arguments since it may have to fall back to another viewer. E.g if you don't have java then it'll fall back to tachyon and has to ignore jmol-specific arguments.

In the code there is a dictionary `kwds` which potentially contains parameters given by the user, yet it is never used.

It is easy to make everything work even when different viewers are available: if viewer X is used, send it all the arguments given by the user. If there is one that it does not understand, it will raise an exception.

As I said, that is not desirable here since we might change the viewer depending on UI capabilities.

There should be some framework for keyword options, especially for plottig options, that can deal with this. But right now we have nothing better than passing dictionaries around, so we can't easily validate if **some** viewer uses an argument or not.

Hello,

We do not have to validate it in this function. Here is an example

```
def viewerA(some_option=4):
    print "Plot with some_option={}".format(some_option)

def viewerB(some_other_option=4):
    print "Plot with some_other_option={}".format(some_other_option)

def plot(viewer="A",**args):
    r"""
    Plot an object with the selected viewer.

    All other options are forwarded to the actual viewer. See their
    documentation for more information.
    """
    if viewer=="A":
        viewerA(**args)
    elif viewer=="B":
        viewerB(**args)
    else:
        raise ValueError("viewer must be A or B")
```

As you can see no verification is done in the generic 'plot'. Then, everything works as expected:

```
sage: plot("A",some_option=4)
Plot with some_option=4
sage: plot("B",some_other_option=4)
Plot with some_other_option=4
sage: plot("A",some_other_option=4)
...
TypeError: viewerA() got an unexpected keyword argument 'some_other_option'
```

How is that a problem? As the endfunctions will accept a different set of parameters they will also raise exceptions for the parameters that they do not accept, won't they?

> show shouldn't validate keyword arguments since it may have to fall back to another viewer. E.g if you don't have java then it'll fall back to tachyon and has to ignore jmol-specific arguments.

Then there is something wrong. The point of the method `_process_viewing_options` is precisely to **select** the valid keywords and modify some of their values. The remaining keywords are just ignored (as Nathann already mentioned). And as far as I see, `_process_viewing_options` is one method in `Graphics3d` which is completely independent of the viewer. And it makes sense to have viewer specific options.

And in `_save_image_png` (line 1367-1397), it seems to me that we have the very same kind of problem

```
opts = self._process_viewing_options(kwds)
viewer = opts['viewer']
    ...
    render = self._rich_repr_tachyon(OutputImagePng, **kwds)
    ...
    scene = self._rich_repr_jmol(**kwds)
    ...

Hi!  I don't have tons of time, but I have a few questions.
1. It looks like what happened here is that there was some error somewhere in all the zillions of viewing changes that should have used the dictionary `opts` and instead used the dictionary `kwds`, but that the current branch fixes this oversight.  Is that correct?  If so, that sounds awesome.
2. Is the comment above correct that `kwds` is incorrectly used and `opts` should be in another function too?  Or is that referring to some other issue?  In that event this should be "needs work", of course.
3. Is the issue about unhandled keywords (possibly for sending to other viewer commands) a new regression in 6.6?  I get

```

  with no problems (also tested in 6.4.1) so I assume that, although I can see both sides of this argument (validation/not validating), maybe this isn't the place to have that discussion, and a new ticket is warranted for that.

Okay, grading and writing an exam beckon and must be finished within 1.5 hours, so I hope this helps clarify things.  (?)
