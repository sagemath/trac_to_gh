Expand and reorganize the section of the FAQ on Contributing to Sage (at http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/faq/faq-contribute.html ) in the following ways:

* Change "How can I get started contributing to Sage?" so that it mentions both programming and non-programming contributions.

* Mention SageMathCloud and add a link to its FAQ.

* Move the text currently following "How can I get started contributing to Sage?" to a new question, "I want to add code to Sage: how do I get started?"

* Update the "I'm not a programmer" question.
