Pip works only if Python was built with libssl (which can not be a standard package because of licensing issues), so this ticket reverts #17913 (that moved sagenb install from easy_install to pip). This ticket takes the opportunity to update pip.

If there is an easy way to get sagenb to install webassets only as needed for the "newui" branch, I would be very happy to cut a new release of that.  I just don't have time to sift through all that now, and won't until mid-May.  So perhaps reverting #17913 for now is the better plan and then in 6.7 (or whatever the next number is) doing this first.

Hum webassets is one of these packages where the tarball you download from github and the one you get from pypi are different - for the same release.

May be we could avoid the whole pip business by just changing the source tarball used for webassets. I think the pypi tarball may contain the stuff that triggered the behavior that Volker tried to correct with pip in #17913.

The tarball to use would be https://github.com/miracle2k/webassets/archive/0.10.1.tar.gz (may need renaming) instead of https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/w/webassets/webassets-0.10.1.tar.gz as currently used.

Replying to [vbraun](#comment%3A19):
> So why not update it?

If it would be an optional package, that would be fine. But `pip` is standard, so it is built when building Sage. If this new version of `pip` doesn't build on somebody's system, then Sage is broken on that system.

That's all true, but even then: installing `pip` in Sage is not the same as installing `pip` system-wide.

It's just a matter of not introducing unneeded risks.

Besides, if upstream fixes [https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/issues/584](https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/issues/584), we would need to upgrade again anyway...
