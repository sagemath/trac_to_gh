The inherited copy method does not work

```

sage: G = Sandpile(g,3)
sage: G.copy()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This messes up other inherited methods, e.g. `plot`

The inherited `__copy__` method was broken because Sandpile changed the signature of __init__.

I fixed this by moving the part of `__copy__` that depends on __init__'s signature into its own function and overriding it in Sandpile.

This could also be fixed by copy+pasting the entire `__copy__` method into Sandpile and tweaking it a bit. I think that's uglier than this though, though maybe not by much.

What does everyone else think?

Hello,

There are several problems with your code:

- Why do you add this new `_make_copy` method in `GenericGraph`? I am not sure
  that I understand your goal, but I suspect that you may want to learn about
  the 'super' function of Python:

  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/576169/understanding-python-super-with-init-methods

  Perhaps you only want to call `super().__copy__()` somewhere?

- The way you added `*args` and `**kwds` to the `__init__` method of !Sandpile,
  the constructor now accepts anything as input,
  e.g. `Sandpile(heyheyhey="heyheyhey")` which has no meaning. When you use such
  a syntax, please ensure that one of the two following points is verified:

  a) The method checks that all the arguments that it is given are actually used,
    and raises an exception otherwise

  b) The method forwards all of `args` and `kwds` to another function

  This way we make sure that all arguments are read at least once, and that none
  of the input is ignored. This is especially useful to detect typos like
  `Sandpile(weithged=True)`, which would otherwise return no warning.

- All functions should have an INPUT and a TEST section:

Helloooooo,

Looks good. About the graph's `copy` function, you will appreciate that `G.copy()` does precisely what you expect. Then, if you ask it to do more it will do... What you ask it to `:-P`

Hello,

You misread. I was talking about `G.copy()` (no arguments). It does exactly what you expect it to.

Do you think that it is a problem for a `copy` function to take optional arguments? If so, can you explain why?

I do not believe that there is any risk of confusion possible, the meaning of `G.copy(immutable=True)` or `G.copy(data_structure="static_sparse_graph")` is rather obvious to anybody who reads it.
