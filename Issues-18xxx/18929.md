Include igraph library ![1] in Sagemath, so that we can use its algorithms. Add routines to convert Sage graphs into igraph and viceversa. The input files are available through the following links:

* for igraph.tar.gz: igraph.org/nightly/get/c/igraph-0.7.1.tar.gz
* for python-igraph.tar.gz: igraph.org/nightly/get/python/python-igraph-0.7.0.tar.gz

The modified files (with script spkg_src) are available through the following links:

* for igraph.tar.gz (the same as the previous one): !https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5D_YOccuV6xNFFUYnZFYzg0bkk/view?usp=sharing

If we manage to include igraph, we will have access to 62 algorithms on graphs: 29 of them are not available in Sage, yet ![2].

<a id='comment:1'>**Comment 1:**</a>
Hello!

With this ticket, I would like to add igraph library to Sage. I have tried to follow as much as possible the instructions in ![1], to include the following external libraries:

* igraph-0.7.1, available in ![2] (the C/C++ core of igraph);
* python-igraph-0.7.0, available in ![3] (the Python interface).

In order to build this code, you should do the following.

* Download the two .tar.gz source code files [2,3] and put them in folder `SAGE_ROOT/upstream` (this folder is not synchronized with git).
* run the script  `SAGE_ROOT/build/pkgs/python_igraph/spkg-src` from folder `SAGE_ROOT`, with command `./build/pkgs/python_igraph/spkg-src`. The problem is that Sage does not like dashes inside the package name: the script converts the file `python-igraph-0.7.0.tar.gz` into `python_igraph-0.7.0.gz` (it is also necessary to modify the name of a folder inside the tar archive).

I am not really sure about the procedure (in particular, about `spkg-src`), so I would like to have feedback, also related to ticket #18826.

Thank you very much!

Michele

Hello!

I have modified `spkg-src`, taking inspiration from the `spkg-src` file of `bzip2` in ticket #18826. I have added the dependencies, but I'm not really sure if I have done it correctly (I have no idea of where variable `$(IGRAPH)` is defined).

Thank you very much!

Michele

Helloooooooo Michele,

I have not installed the two igraph packages yet (the reason will follow) but it seems that you did well with the 'dependencies' file. The 'IGRAPH' variable is a bit magic it's true: it is generated from the package's name, and you should find it in `SAGE_ROOT/build/make/Makefile` somewhere. If you look for `PYTHON_IGRAPH` you should see the dependency that you added in this 'dependencies' file.

I added a small commit at `public/18929` that does not do anything smart. I flagged the new doctests with `# optional - python_igraph` so that they are only run if the `python_igraph` is installed (they would break otherwise), though there remains some problem to deal with: you cannot import 'igraph' in the (Di)Graph constructor, for this package is optional. I ran the tests before installing the package, and well.. Everything break. Even this:

```
sage: Graph()
...
ImportError: No module named igraph
```

Sooo perhaps you should 'detect' the presence of this module with something like that (unless you find something better):

```
try:
    import igraph
    _python_igraph_available = True
except ImportError:
    _python_igraph_available = False    
```

In the same way, your 'import igraph' in `GenericGraph.igraph_graph` would generate, when called on a machine on which the package is not installed, an `ImportError`. We usually try to give something easier to work with, like an error message advising to install a package named <package_name> to enable this feature.

Have fuuuuuuun,

Nathann

Hello again Michele,

I was about to try to install the two packages and so I downloaded igraph's sources, but it seems that there is something wrong with the checksums:

```
(tmp|✔)~/.Sage$ sage -i igraph
Found local metadata for igraph-0.7.1
Invalid checksum for cached file /home/ncohen/.Sage/upstream/igraph-0.7.1.tar.gz, deleting
```

Could you also provide direct links toward the archive files in the ticket's description? This is for the release manager who will have to add them to Sage's repository.

In the second case, i.e. the `python_igraph` file (as it is not vanilla upstream), it means uploading it on some server of yours so that it can be downloaded from there. The purpose of ticket #18826 is precisely to give us an easy way to 'check', in such situations, that the archive uploaded by one of us is exactly what it should.

Hello again Michele,

Don't worry about the many steps it takes to get this through. I also worry that I may be a bit boring, with all these things I add one by one to your stack because I cannot seem to figure out them all at the same time.

I installed the two packages, and things went well. I still have a question about the igraph package: upstream is apparently a 'fake' .tar.gz archive (it is not gzipped) -> is this why your igraph package is 'not exactly' (up to md5sum hash) equal to upstream?

While looking at the (Di)Graph constructor, I thought that something unlikely may happen:
1) Somebody has a igraph object in a Sage session
2) igraph is not installed in Sage
I thought that it could happen if by some chance such an object was obtained through pickling.

Perhaps it sounds stupid. This being said, I also 'fixed' something else: importing modules is not totally free, and it was even the bottleneck in some design code I met in the past. For this reason, it is better to not import things in potentially critical parts of the code (the graph constructor can be one of those, for instance when you enumerate graphs up to isomorphism) and so I tried to make it less frequent. This commit is located at `public/18929`, you can take/remove what you like/do not like in it.

Have you figured out this GPL2 vs GPLv2+ issue I mentionned in an email?

Byeeeeeeeeeee,

Nathann

P.S.: I had some issue when installing the package, which I reported upstream (https://github.com/igraph/igraph/issues/842)

However, it does not seem to be a problem: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html#WhatDoesCompatMean.

I have uninstalled it from my computer, and I have re-installed igraph (without Sage): the problem still appears, even if ./configure realizes that libxml2 is missing, because it writes \"GraphML format support -- no\". Probably it is an igraph bug.\n\nIn order to solve this problem, I have added a check in the spkg-install script, and I had to modify the sage-spkg file to allow an error which depends on the user. Do you agree with this modification? Or do you think I should do something less \"invasive\"? Because I do not like that we tell the user to contact sage-devel if (s)he only has to install libxml2.",

What do you mean by 'fake' .tar.gz archive? Anyway, I have downloaded again the file igraph.tar.gz, and I have run again the `sage -sh sage-fix-pkg-checksums` script, hoping it will solve the problem. Does it?

For this reason, it is better to not import things in potentially critical parts of the code (the graph constructor can be one of those, for instance when you enumerate graphs up to isomorphism) and so I tried to make it less frequent. This commit is located at `public/18929`, you can take/remove what you like/do not like in it.

I have included the commit.

> Have you figured out this GPL2 vs GPLv2+ issue I mentionned in an email?

The igraph file COPYING that comes with both packages starts with:

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 2, June 1991

So I believe it is GPLv2. However, it does not seem to be a problem: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html#WhatDoesCompatMean. Moreover, also package latte_int is distributed with Sage with GPLv2.

Ouch, yes, the problem is libxml2. I have uninstalled it from my computer, and I have re-installed igraph (without Sage): the problem still appears, even if ./configure realizes that libxml2 is missing, because it writes "GraphML format support -- no". Probably it is an igraph bug.

In order to solve this problem, I have added a check in the spkg-install script, and I had to modify the sage-spkg file to allow an error which depends on the user. Do you agree with this modification? Or do you think I should do something less "invasive"? Because I do not like that we tell the user to contact sage-devel if (s)he only has to install libxml2.

Hello,

> What do you mean by 'fake' .tar.gz archive?

Sigh.... After some debugging, it seems that if I click on "source code" at this address (http://igraph.org/c/#downloads) I get a file like that:

```
~$ file igraph-0.7.1.tar.gz            
igraph-0.7.1.tar.gz: POSIX tar archive
```

If I copy/paste the url and download it with wget I get a file like that:

```
~$ file igraph-0.7.1.tar.gz 
igraph-0.7.1.tar.gz: gzip compressed data, last modified: Tue Apr 22 19:55:20 2014, max compression, from Unix
```

Anyway. It works, sorry for the misunderstanding.

Helooooooo Michele,

I finished reviewing this ticket again. I'm sorry but if there is one thing I cannot stand, it is to see heaps of code meant to deal with edge labels/multile edges/loops/weights. Dozens of line which do nothing but wrap junk into another kind of junk.

Well.

I added a commit at public/18929 which does the following modifications, which you can of course accept/discuss/reject:

- documentation of `igraph` input -- I removed the end of the sentence about what is done with weights/names/etc. It is not said for other formats and it is how it is expected to work. I thought that the shortest was the best.

- removed some trailing whitespaces

- changed the message in which you mentionned a 'network'. Graphs are.. Well, nobody exactly knows. Depending on who you talk to, when you say "a graph" people hear "social network graph", "router graph", "planar graph", "vertex-transitive graph", "cayley graph", and many others. Networks do exist, but that would not make *any* sense for some of those guys, so I stuck to the 'graph' terminology.

- I "compressed" a bit the copy/paste meant to handle names, by using the relabel function. For this I had to change a line in `GenericGraph.relabel` related to `_boundary`, but this `#O&O#&&^@)#%*(` is meant to be removed in #17462 anyway.

- Try to not use `except Exception` if you can avoid it. That's too large. If there is a typo in the line before it, it will catch this too and you don't want that. Also, try to keep as little as possible in a try/except.

Finally, I have to say that I can't bring myself to give a positive review to this latest commit. Much of what it does is, to me, meant to be done by the user. We cannot adapt to the many forms he wants his data to take in the igraph graph, so I think that the best we should do is ... "keep it simple and reliable". Guessing that 'label' is a special key in the dictionary is (to me) going way too far, and I am tempted to do the same for weights. Of course their labels *have* to be dictionaries and ours can be anything. That's unpleasant, but turning our label into a `{'label':label}` in their data structure, and setting their dictionary to be our edge label is to me the best we can do.

So yes, if you apply translation several times you will not converge. Honestly, I do not care at all.

Sooooo, sorry for that. You have several ways out:

- Get this ticket reviewed by somebody else (I will not force my view, I just won't review it myself -- no way)
- Remove the commits you added since my last 'positive review' so that this ticket can get merged, and move those label commits to another ticket.

As you wish.

Have fun,

Nathann

Hellooooooo!

Well, I go for a variation of the first solution you proposed: simplifying as much as possible the interface with igraph. In particular, I have removed the graph name, and vertex and edge attributes are provided by the user in "igraph-style" ([http://igraph.org/python/doc/igraph.Graph-class.html#__init__](http://igraph.org/python/doc/igraph.Graph-class.html#__init__)). There are several examples on how to do it in my new code.

For the igraph=>sage conversion, I have used your relabel function for vertex names, while the edge label is simply kept as it was in igraph (only problem: empty labels in igraph translate to `{}` label in Sage, not to `None`).

More answers below! Hope you like this new commit!

See you,

Michele

<a id='comment:29'>**Comment 29:**</a>
Did you follow the whole procedure to install igraph? In particular, you should do the following:

* Download the two .tar.gz source code files [1,2] and put them in folder `SAGE_ROOT/upstream` (this folder is not synchronized with git).
* run the script  `SAGE_ROOT/build/pkgs/python_igraph/spkg-src` through `sage -sh ./build/pkgs/python_igraph/spkg-src` from folder `SAGE_ROOT` (you can also run it from any other folder).

Another possible procedure is to download the modified tarballs from [3,4] and put them in the folder  `SAGE_ROOT/upstream`. Then, `./sage -i python_igraph` should work.

If you still have problems, could you tell me which of the two procedure fails, and if it still fails after running the command `sage -sh sage-fix-pkg-checksums`?

Thank you very much,

Michele

<a id='comment:30'>**Comment 30:**</a>
My first trial was with the source code from [1] and [2].
One difficulty is that [2] gives `python-igraph...` and not `python_igraph...` 

Now I'm trying with [4] and it's working... but then it says that igraph is not installed.
So I'm running `./sage -i igraph` using the source code from [3] (should work also with [1]).

The point is that before installing igraph, I installed this patch and performed the following test:

```
sage: G = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: G.igraph_graph()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ImportError                               Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-2-07a5568607db> in <module>()
----> 1 G.igraph_graph()

/Users/dcoudert/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/graphs/generic_graph.pyc in igraph_graph(self, vertex_attrs, edge_attrs)
   1432             raise ImportError("The package igraph is not available. To " +
   1433                               "install it, run Sage with option -i " +
-> 1434                               "python_igraph.")
   1435 
   1436         v_to_int = {v:i for i,v in enumerate(self.vertices())}

ImportError: The package igraph is not available. To install it, run Sage with option -i python_igraph.
sage: 
```
I don't know if the installation of `python_igraph` is expected to install `igraph` as well or not. If not, then the error message should be improved.


Now that it is working, I did 

```
sage: G = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: H = G.igraph_graph()
sage: H.<TAB>
```
and got access to the list of methods.
It is surprizing to see that we have both graph algorithms and graph generators (e.g. `Barabasi`, `Erdos_Renyi`, etc.), but I assume there is nothing you can do to avoid that. Not a big deal.
Also, some methods for digraphs (e.g., `all_st_mincuts`) are accessible from undirected graphs and so an error is raised, but again I assume there is nothing we can do about it.

```
sage: H.is_directed()
False
sage: H.all_st_mincuts(0,2)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NotImplementedError                       Traceback (most recent call last)

/Users/dcoudert/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/python_igraph-0.7.0-py2.7-macosx-10.9-x86_64.egg/igraph/__init__.pyc in all_st_mincuts(self, source, target, capacity)
    390           graphs. Algorithmica 15, 351--372, 1996.
    391         """
--> 392         value, cuts, parts = GraphBase.all_st_mincuts(self, source, target, capacity)
    393         return [Cut(self, value, cut=cut, partition=part)
    394                 for cut, part in izip(cuts, parts)]

NotImplementedError: Error at st-cuts.c:1320: S-t cuts can only be listed in directed graphs, Unimplemented function call
```
Anyway, its working.

I will now try to understand the point of disagreement between you and Nathann.

David.

Hmmmmm, good question. I added igraph to the dependencies of python_igraph, but maybe it is not sufficient (see comments 4-5)... Nathann??

Yeah, I know. The dependency is taken into consideration only if you install the package by typing 'make python_igraph'. It is ignored if you run 'sage -i python_igraph'. Why? Because Jeroen likes it.

I think that it is plainly stupid, and already had to complain on a ticket (#18859) which replaced *all* instructions to install a package through "sage -i <pkgname>" with  "make <pkgname>" (which is obviously less practical for beginners).

To me, the 'most natural' command for users (i.e. 'sage -i pkgname') should install the package, and take dependencies into account.

If you agree with Jeroen you have nothing to do, if you do not care you have nothing to do, if you have any other opinion please voice it on sage-devel, or nothing will happen.

Hello,

I thought these two lines were removed from `graph.py` and `digraph.py` in #17462, but I see them in your commits...

```
    -  ``boundary`` - a list of boundary vertices, if
       empty, graph is considered as a 'graph without boundary'

```
David.
