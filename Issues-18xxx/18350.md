Hello every one,

I offer to append a generic operator on Hopf algebra: the coproduct and the product iterate k times. (I assume that operation is called the Adams operation but... it seems to be totally something else in the sage Sym... so... I'm not sure about the name of this operation)

```
sage: h = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).h()
sage: h[5].adams_operator(2)
2*h[3, 2] + 2*h[4, 1] + 2*h[5]
sage: tensor([h,h]).module_morphism(on_basis=lambda c: h(c[0])*h(c[1]), codomain=h)(h[5].coproduct())
2*h[3, 2] + 2*h[4, 1] + 2*h[5]
```

Cheers,
Jean-Baptiste

Salut Jean-Baptiste,

Thanks for the proof of concept!

Computing `n`-fold products and coproducts is a generally useful
feature, so I would abstract it away. Probably with an API such as:

```
    sage: H = MyFavoriteHopfAlgebra()

    sage: coprodk = H.nfold_coproduct(n); phi
    A morphism from H to H # ... # H

    sage: muk = H.mu(n); muk
    A morphism from H # ... # H to H

    sage: mu = H.mu(); mu         # default value
    A morphism from H # H to H

    sage: adams = H.adams_operator(n); adams
    A morphism from H to H
```

I don't have a strong opinion for what `n` should stand for. At first
sight it feels natural to have `H.nfold_coproduct(n)` go from `H` the
`n`-fold tensor product of `H`, and reciprocally for `H.mu`. But this
does not match with Dima's suggestion since `H.coproduct` would be
`H.nfold_coproduct(2)`.

Possibly with shorthands to call those from the elements:

```
    sage: h = H().an_element()
    sage: h.nfold_coproduct(n)   # in Coalgebras.TensorProducts.ElementMethods
    sage: h.adams(n)             # in HopfAlgebras.TensorProducts.ElementMethods?
    sage: tensor([h,h,h]).mu()   # in Algebras.TensorProducts.ElementMethods?
```

This approach also has the advantage of constructing the morphisms
only once.

`H.adams_operator` can be simply defined as `H.mu(n) *
H.nfold_coproduct(n)`.  `H.mu` can be defined straightforwardly on the
basis.  `H.nfold_coproduct` indeed has to be defined recursively as
you did. We might as well use binary exponentiation. For example,
`H.nfold_coproduct(2*n)` can be defined as:

```
    tensor([H.coproduct(n), H.coproduct(n)]) * H.coproduct
```

So altogether this should require no more code (possibly less) than
what you have already.

One small feature we are missing in Sage 6.6: constructing tensor
products of morphisms. Luckily we do have code for this: #15832
(Nicolas Borie also has code for this somewhere; Nicolas: could you
provide us with a pointer? Thanks). It's a small feature that we
really want to have anyway, so that can be a good occasion to get it
merged in.

Cheers,
                                  Nicolas

Hi,

That is easy to implement an ugly `nfold_coproduct` (as I did) but I don't know how to implement an `nfold_product`. Where implements it?

Furthermore, if you want to go in this way it seems to be great to be able to do that:

```
sage: h = MyFavoriteHopfAlgebras(QQ)
sage: id = h.identity_map
sage: mu = h.product
sage: op = tensor([mu, id])
sage: a,b,c = h.some_three_elements()
sage: op(tensor([a,b,c]))
a*b # c
```

This feature exists? If this exists I'm agree to implement those `nfold_coproduct` and `nfold_product` operators but otherwise I assume this feature should be implemented before.

Typically a method in Algebras.ParentMethods whose code would be along
the following lines (not tested!):

```
    T = tensor([self]*n)
    T.module_morphism(lambda t: self.product(self.monomial(i) for i in t), codomain=self)
```

Btw: I looked at the code of #15832: there are many other things in
the branch attached to the ticket; I'll try to extract a branch with
just the ticket-relevant feature tomorrow.

Yeah, I see your point. I am not super keen on "coproduct power"
either, as it's really the analogue (in fact essentially the dual) of
n-ary products (which of course are computed iteratively from binary
products), and less so of powering (for
composition/multiplication). In particular, `n` is more related to the
number of factors in the tensor than to the number of times the
coproduct needs to be iterated.

I agree that tab-completion-wise it would be nice to have a name such
as `coproduct_...`. I could live with `coproduct_nfold`. But any
better suggestion is welcome!

Cheers,

I will be merging with ticket #18678 over the next few days. In the meantime, some comments for people in-the-know to weigh-in on (will repeat in #18678 when updates appear)...

1. `.adams_operator()` should be moved to `bialgebras.py`, then in `hopf_algebras.py` one should overwrite the bialgebras version, allowing for negative integer powers. (E.g., the (-2)nd convolution power of the identity is none other than the 2nd power of the antipode.)

2. In fact, while adams operators naturally belong in `bialgebras.py`, the present code---in ticket #18678 and #18350---actually belongs in `bialgebras_with_basis.py`---as it uses `.module_morphism()` and `.apply_multilinear_morphism()`---but this would require more rewriting than I feel qualified to handle.

3. More tickets needed! When poking around for an algebra without basis---on which to test my code---I noticed that Sage doesn't know that `QQ[x]` is a module over `QQ` (and hence, one cannot build ``QQ[x].tensor(QQ[x])`. Crazy.

4. Similarly, even though `B = FreeAlgebra(QQ,a,b)` is robust enough that `B.tensor(B)` doesn't throw errors, quotients are out-of-bounds again. Putting `C = B.quotient_ring((a*b-b^2,))`, I get an AttributeError when asking for `C.tensor(C)`.

5. One could also add the following functionality: given linear morphisms R,S,T for a bialgebra B, create their convolution product, a new morphism, via `RST = B.convolution_product(R,S,T)` or perhaps, defined only at the level of a distinguished basis m for B, `RST = m.convolution_product(R,S,T)`. However, it seems ticket #15832 will have a lot of overlap with such code, so I'll hold off on implementing it unless somebody suggests otherwise.


P.S. Any final votes regarding Amy Pang's recent comment?
