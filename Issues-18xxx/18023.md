We add methods to check if a given order of facets is a shelling order and for calculating  restricted sets (when shellable). This also adds code to construct the f-triangle and h-triangles (to use for basic tests for shellability). We add some code in a doctest for a specialized method for computing the *h* vector, which should get merged into a class for `ShellableComplexes` (when such a class gets created).

Federico, I rewrote your algorithm to reflect the mathematics more closely. I think the next step after this would be to implement a new class `ShellableSimplicialComplex` to take advantage of specialized implementations (such as your `h_vector` code).

John, do you think you could do a (second) review of this?

First, I'm not an expert on shellability; my background is algebraic topology, not combinatorics. The basic code looks fine, but I'm worried that this method for testing for shellability is going to be very slow for even modestly sized simplicial complexes. If I naively do

```
sage: T = simplicial_complexes.Torus()
sage: T
Simplicial complex with vertex set (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) and 14 facets
sage: T.is_shellable()
```
