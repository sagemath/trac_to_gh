We add methods to check if a given order of facets is a shelling order and for calculating  restricted sets (when shellable). This also adds code to construct the f-triangle and h-triangles (to use for basic tests for shellability). We add some code in a doctest for a specialized method for computing the *h* vector, which should get merged into a class for `ShellableComplexes` (when such a class gets created).
