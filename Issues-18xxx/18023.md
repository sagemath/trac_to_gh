We add methods to check if a given order of facets is a shelling order and for calculating  restricted sets (when shellable). This also adds code to construct the f-triangle and h-triangles (to use for basic tests for shellability). We add some code in a doctest for a specialized method for computing the *h* vector, which should get merged into a class for `ShellableComplexes` (when such a class gets created).

Federico, I rewrote your algorithm to reflect the mathematics more closely. I think the next step after this would be to implement a new class `ShellableSimplicialComplex` to take advantage of specialized implementations (such as your `h_vector` code).

John, do you think you could do a (second) review of this?

First, I'm not an expert on shellability; my background is algebraic topology, not combinatorics. The basic code looks fine, but I'm worried that this method for testing for shellability is going to be very slow for even modestly sized simplicial complexes. If I naively do

```
sage: T = simplicial_complexes.Torus()
sage: T
Simplicial complex with vertex set (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) and 14 facets
sage: T.is_shellable()
```
I'm going to be in for a long wait. Part of the problem is that `T` isn't shellable, so it tries all 87 billion permutations of the facets to see if any ordering works.

At least add a warning in the documentation that it is likely to be slow, maybe even mention that it is a brute force method.

Good points. I've made some minor tweaks so that this works for non-pure complexes as well. I've added the f/h triangles and do shortcuts for shellability testing. I've also rewritten the algorithm for `is_shellable` to do backtracing in following the link you posted. I'll also run some more tests with Federico (next week when I get back to Davis).
