We add methods to check if a given order of facets is a shelling order and for calculating  restricted sets (when shellable). This also adds code to construct the f-triangle and h-triangles (to use for basic tests for shellability). We add some code in a doctest for a specialized method for computing the *h* vector, which should get merged into a class for `ShellableComplexes` (when such a class gets created).

Federico, I rewrote your algorithm to reflect the mathematics more closely. I think the next step after this would be to implement a new class `ShellableSimplicialComplex` to take advantage of specialized implementations (such as your `h_vector` code).

John, do you think you could do a (second) review of this?

+We add methods to check if a given order of facets is a shelling order and for calculating  restricted sets (when shellable). This also adds code to construct the f-triangle and h-triangles (to use for basic tests for shellability).
