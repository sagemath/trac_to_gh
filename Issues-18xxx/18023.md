We add methods to check if a given order of facets is a shelling order and for calculating  restricted sets (when shellable).

Federico, I rewrote your algorithm to reflect the mathematics more closely. I think the next step after this would be to implement a new class `ShellableSimplicialComplex` to take advantage of specialized implementations (such as your `h_vector` code).

John, do you think you could do a (second) review of this?

```
sage: T = simplicial_complexes.Torus()
sage: T
Simplicial complex with vertex set (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) and 14 facets

This also adds code to construct the f-triangle and h-triangles (to use for basic tests for shellability).
