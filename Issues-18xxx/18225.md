Sage forgot the existence of some polyhedras!

Platonic (or regular) solids:
- ~~[tetrahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahedron)~~
- ~~[octahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octahedron)~~

Archimedian (or semi-regular) solids:
- ~~[truncated tetrahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncated_tetrahedron)~~
- ~~[truncated cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncated_cube)~~
- ~~[truncated octahedron (truncated tetratetrahedron)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncated_octahedron)~~
- ~~[snub cube (snub cuboctahedron)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snub_cube)~~

You are free to split it into several tickets.

Quick remark on the code: some of the constructors do not accept `exact`/`base_ring` as arguments. I know that some of them are infinitely slow with `exact=True`. There are already some of them that have default `exact=False` that is fine with me if there is a clear warning.

PS: I have code that improves the generic double description algorithm and makes the constructions reasonable over QQbar... but it needs a bit of cleaning.

<a id='comment:30'></a>Here is how you can create `phi` and `xi`:

```
sage: Q = QuadraticField(5, 'sqrt5')
sage: sqrt5 = Q.gen()
sage: phi = (1 + sqrt5)/2
sage: R.<x> = Q[]
sage: A = NumberField(x^3 - 2*x - phi, 'xi')
sage: xi = A.gen()
```
You can also use `RDF` for an `exact=False` input.

For the first question, you should use instead

```
R = PolynomialRing(Q, 'x')
x = R.gen()

<a id='comment:46'></a>Hello again,

There was a small problem in the index code, which I now fixed at #19596.

If used in the library.py file without the fix, two functions are missing: `associahedron` and `flow_polytope`.

We have several ways out (tell me what you prefer):

1) We don't add any index in this ticket, waiting for #19596 to be reviewed

2) We add the index in this ticket, with #19596 as a dependency

3) We add the index in this ticket without #19596 as a dependency, and the two missing elements will appear whenever #19596 will be merged (possibly before the next beta anyway)

Have fun,

Nathann

The problem is that comparisons (ie using `<` or `>`) does only work for quadratic field. There is a ticket needing review for that #17830. In the mean time everything is working well (but slowly) with `AA` the algebraic field:

```
sage: AA(3).sqrt().sqrt() < AA(2).sqrt()
True
```
You can notice that number fields for polyhedra are only used with quadratic fields...

I don't have any real preference. As long as this ticket gets through fast. ;-) I will try to have a look at #19596 today or tomorrow.

It's a separate issue in a way and this could be used as a test for #19596.
