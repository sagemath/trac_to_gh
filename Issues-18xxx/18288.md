```
The typical `gdb` backtrace using `sage-CSI-helper.py` got broken in #17776:

```
  File "<string>", line 4
SyntaxError: from __future__ imports must occur at the beginning of the file
Error while executing Python code.
```

The issue here is that the script is read and not just executed.

Not in this case:

    .format(index, func_address, func_name, a), end=' ')
