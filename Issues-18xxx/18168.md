Yes, mostly, indeed.

I *think* all functions in these modules are imported as members of `quadratic_form.QuadraticForm` and already picked up by sphinx for this reason, except for `quadratic_form__evaluate`, whose contents are imported at the module level. I have updated the `rst` file accordingly. But I didn't check super-thoroughly, and of course, that's not a very robust way of doing things in the first place.
