Looks good but I should at least do a build of that one because it is a lot of changes even if they are seemingly trivial.

If you replace "import or declare" by "`cimport`", yes, you are right. You just need to add the libraries to the `.pxd` file.

> Of course that's how the linking to pari must have been done in the first place since there was already no `pari` in `libraries` before your change.

That was done in #18450.

Abuse? :-)

Anyway, for #17630, you'll probably want to define an analogous `BLAS_LIBRARIES` or something.

I don't doubt that you have done so already. I just do what I think I should do as a reviewer, running my own independent tests in this case.
