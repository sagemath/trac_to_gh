When I says that `10.15` fails, I mean that it leads to a lot of doctest failures. I think that they all arise from `pari`, so I'm testing to see if we can just set `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` for `pari`, not globally. 

Either approach would have to be tested on older versions of OS X, though.

We should get rid of this - after 4+ years.

```
if [ $MACOSX_VERSION -ge 14 ]; then

I have the same experience with Catalina. On both Big Sur and Catalina, I can avoid the doctest failures by using

```
% MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=X make ptestlong
```
where `X` is a suitable number for the operating system (either 11.0 or 10.15).

I do not have access to any older versions of the MacOS.

It appears that there is still one instance of `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` in `built/pkgs/scipy/spkg-install.in`. I don't think it is on purpose.
