I have the same experience with Catalina. On both Big Sur and Catalina, I can avoid the doctest failures by using

```
% MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=X make ptestlong
```
where `X` is a suitable number for the operating system (either 11.0 or 10.15).

I do not have access to any older versions of the MacOS.
