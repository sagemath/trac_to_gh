Right now I have access to computers running OS X 10.14 and 10.15. On both, using `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.14` works, while `10.15` fails. (`MACOSX_VERSION` is 18 or 19 on these machines, so the formula `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.$[$MACOSX_VERSION-4]` (which we only use if `MACOSX_VERSION` is 13 or lower) wouldn't work in this case.

When I says that `10.15` fails, I mean that it leads to a lot of doctest failures. I think that they all arise from `pari`, so I'm testing to see if we can just set `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` for `pari`, not globally. 

Either approach would have to be tested on older versions of OS X, though.

Here is a branch, only tested so far on OS X Big Sur. Sage builds for me with its own Python, with homebrew's Python, or with the system `/usr/bin/python3`. Doctests pass (except for unrelated errors) with the first two; with `/usr/bin/python3`, I get a lot of failures because of messages

```
ld: warning: dylib (/usr/local/lib/libmpfr.dylib) was built for newer macOS version (11.0) than being linked (10.14.6)
```
(Significantly, those messages are not printed in the first two cases, which is a good sign.)

I have the same experience with Catalina. On both Big Sur and Catalina, I can avoid the doctest failures by using

```
% MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=X make ptestlong
```
where `X` is a suitable number for the operating system (either 11.0 or 10.15).

I do not have access to any older versions of the MacOS.
