(`MACOSX_VERSION` is 18 or 19 on these machines, so the formula `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.$[$MACOSX_VERSION-4]` (which we only use if `MACOSX_VERSION` is 13 or lower) wouldn't work in this case.

When I says that `10.15` fails, I mean that it leads to a lot of doctest failures. I think that they all arise from `pari`, so I'm testing to see if we can just set `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` for `pari`, not globally. 

Either approach would have to be tested on older versions of OS X, though.

We should get rid of this - after 4+ years.

```
if [ $MACOSX_VERSION -ge 14 ]; then
    # various packages have still have issues with
    # two digit OS X versions
    MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.9

Moreover, there should be a way for the user to override it (as noted already on #16312).

I have the same experience with Catalina. On both Big Sur and Catalina, I can avoid the doctest failures by using

```
% MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=X make ptestlong
```
where `X` is a suitable number for the operating system (either 11.0 or 10.15).

I do not have access to any older versions of the MacOS.
