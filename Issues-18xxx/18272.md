Right now I have access to computers running OS X 10.14 and 10.15. On both, using `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.14` works, while `10.15` fails. (`MACOSX_VERSION` is 18 or 19 on these machines, so the formula `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.$[$MACOSX_VERSION-4]` (which we only use if `MACOSX_VERSION` is 13 or lower) wouldn't work in this case. But maybe we could bump it up to 10.14.

When I says that `10.15` fails, I mean that it leads to a lot of doctest failures. I think that they all arise from `pari`, so I'm testing to see if we can just set `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` for `pari`, not globally. 

Either approach would have to be tested on older versions of OS X, though.

I have the same experience with Catalina. On both Big Sur and Catalina, I can avoid the doctest failures by using

```
% MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=X make ptestlong
```
where `X` is a suitable number for the operating system (either 11.0 or 10.15).

I do not have access to any older versions of the MacOS.

If we're not building a `bdist`, why should we have to set `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` at all? My recollection is that we did this to work around some bugs in various spkgs, but if we can build without setting it, shouldn't we?

I agree, for normal builds, not setting `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` at all will be fine.

This ticket would need to go through testing on all supported platforms again -- do you want this change in 9.3?
