In the past, p_group_cohomology-2.1.4 was an optional spkg. Sage dropped support for old style spkgs, and thus only an experimental spkg remained.

The purpose of this ticket is to provide a new group cohomology package for Sage. I suggest to make it optional (not experimental).

In the experimental version 2.1.5, I have improved the computation of Poincaré series, depth and filter degree type (the latter now uses a Hilbert-driven computation of Gröbner bases in elimination order, which works since in that setting the Hilbert function is easily available), and I added new functionality related with nilpotency.

**__Package structure__**

Version 3.0 is refactored as follows:

- It depends on the optional meataxe package (see #24359), which is based on a fork of MeatAxe.
- The spkg-install script first tests whether the SmallGroups library is installed in GAP. If it isn't, a warning is printed; however, the package still gets installed, as it only is a runtime dependency.
- The C code written by David Green has become an autotoolized shared library.
- Gap and Singular code is put into `SAGE_SHARE/`, where GAP and Singular libraries belong.
- The rest of the package is formed by python and cython code, and uses pip for installation.
- The documentation is built in an improved way.

**__Further changes__**

- The custom logging in the old spkg is replaced by Python's logging module.
- The tests avoid side-effects by using a reset function. Hence, no custom doc tester is needed: `sage -t` is enough.
- In the previous spkg, I tried to be as backward compatible as possible. But now I'm dropping support for very old Singular versions.
- Some experimental options for the cohomology computation are removed.

Many tests have changed, since the ring presentations of the computed cohomology rings, specifically for non-primepower groups, have changed. I do not fully understand *why* they changed. but it seems that it is a consequence of changes in Singular. The changes did (of course...) not affect the isomorphism types of the rings.

For me, all but two tests fail. Both tests fail with "connection timed out" during access to a web data base, and both work fine when done in an interactive session.

Has something in the test framework changed, so that web access via `urllib2` fails during tests?

The main difference is that you no longer need to add `csage` as library. Currently, it doesn't hurt if you add the library anyway, but in the future, `csage` might not exist anymore.

And there is one additional caveat which is relevant for your package: since #18027, you must include `interrupt.pxi` only in `.pyx` files and not `.pxd` files (unless you really know what you're doing).

On the topic of `.pxd` files, this is what they should contain:

1. The API of your module, that is all `cdef` classes and `c(p)def` functions that you want to export for use in other modules (in the same package or by other packages).

2. If your module provides bindings to some library (the `mtx` module in your package for example), then add the declarations of the library functions in the `.pxd` file.

3. Any dependencies of the above. Sage example: if you're defining a new kind of element of a ring, you will probably inherit from `RingElement`.

And that's it really. Things like interrupts have nothing to do with the API of your module, those are implementation details and belong in the `.pyx` file. This is important in order to minimize dependencies.

NOTE about 2: if your module provides bindings to some library but also does significant other stuff, then it's best to split up the bindings in a different `.pxd` file. In Sage, we usually put the library bindings in `sage/libs`, look at `sage/libs/gmp` for a good example.

Bad news. It builds, but I can't import it. Which brings up the question again why there are all these incompatible changes in Sage. They didn't use to occur so frequently in earlier versions of Sage, IIRC.

Essentially, because of #17854 and its sub-tickets. Removing the low-level `c_lib` (a.k.a. `libcsage`) did indeed have consequences for all packages compiling against Sage.

> They didn't use to occur so frequently in earlier versions of Sage, IIRC.

And they probably will not occur anymore in the future, now that #17854 is dealt with. And if there are changes, now we can just change the function `sage_include_directories()` from #18494.

> Is there a reason not to make a new-style packages for `p_group_cohomology` ?


Yes. I need someone who explains to me in ALL detail how to create a new-style package.

It begins with: How do I create an "upstream" repository for my sources? Note that I will not change the meataxe matrix wrapper that is included in the package into a wrapper for the latest meataxe upstream, as this would require to rewrite most of the c- and much of the cython-code. So, the files in the current package are an old version of meataxe with massive patches (i.e., basically a fork), plus c- and cython- and singular- and gap-code, for which this package currently is the only source.

<a id='comment:28'></a>
It seems that there is no way around creating a new-style spkg, although I still find it odd to artificially create an upstream source in a situation where the spkg IS upstream. Sigh.

I have to
- get a github account (or reactivate an existing account?),
- learn how to convert the existing hg repository in the spkg to git,
- look up how to push my private repository to github,
- do what is said in [comment:27](#comment%3A27).

Did I forget something?

Now comes the complicated part.

The spkg has three sources, namely
1. C-MeatAxe
2. C programs written by David Green
3. Cython, Python, Gap and Singular code written by me.

__Ad 1.__

Actually the starting point is a very old version of C-MeatAxe. If I see that correctly, upstream currently isn't very active. However, compared with the version used in the spkg, upstream has changed most function names. 

I apply big patches to C-MeatAxe, as I implemented Strassen multiplication. It improves performance a lot (in the old sources). However, Strassen still is not implemented in the current upstream sources. Two years ago I attended a presentation of one C-MeatAxe developer, and he said that they prefer to optimise the existing implementation rather than adding asymptotically fast implementations. It didn't convince him when I told him that in the old MeatAxe, Strassen beats school book multiplication for matrices as small as 200x200.

__Ad 2.__

David Green's programs have never been published independently. Hence, the spkg *is* upstream. The code uses the old C-MeatAxe extensively.

__Ad 3.__

My code has never been published independently. Hence, the spkg *is* upstream. It contains a Cython wrapper for the old C-MeatAxe.

**__Conclusion__**

I guess in an ideal world, I would create a new spkg for C-MeatAxe, containing my patches and my Cython wrapper and the MeatAxe executable, but starting with current upstream. I would then create a repository for Green's and my code. p_group_cohomology would then depend on the new MeatAxe spkg.

If I recall correctly, I actually have a wrapper for a recent version of MeatAxe, perhaps even with my Strassen implementation. Hence, creating the new MeatAxe spkg might be a feasible first step.

However, rewriting Green's programs in terms of the new MeatAxe could be a pain in the neck.

So, as a short term solution, I'd like to keep the proposed version 2.1.5 of my spkg, that still uses the old C-MeatAxe, with the prospect that version 3.0 should be based on the current MeatAxe upstream.

If I understood correctly, the suggestion of John and Travis was to create a new-style package with the least effort. I.e., take the current sources contained in the spkg and post them somewhere (aka "upstream"), and install new-stylish from there.

Or perhaps a little better and still feasible: Use the *proper* existing upstream for MeatAxe (even though the package uses a very old version), and only put the rest of the sources to a new upstream.

> In the latter case, the ticket should be set back to needs_work.


OK.

I guess it's because of the Cython upgrade. Earlier versions of Cython did not give an error for code like

```
f(foo="hello", foo="world")

but now that's an error just like in Python.

I replaced the spkg by a version that *almost* passes the test suite. The only remaining problem is that in the stored data the old pickling of Singular elements is used, which results in a deprecation warning.

So, my plan is: Re-compute the cohomology for all groups of order 64, store them in a database, put the database into the package, and put it online.

Then, finally create a basic version of a new-style package.

Strangely, these tests worked on my laptop. Is it possible that "screen" (which I use on the office computer) prevents internet access during doctests?

When translating my implementation of Winograd-Strassen multiplication from meataxe-2.2.4 to meataxe-2.4.24, most of the work has indeed been cut-and-paste.

However, we talk here about changing third party code (namely David Green's), and since I didn't write it I don't know if the transition will be smooth.

I managed to rewrite the stand-alone programs of David Green needed in the package, and the rest \"should work\" (TM) by search-and-replace operations (really, ALL names in meataxe have changed).\n\nBut I have questions concerning the new code structure.\n\nThe old spkg (p_group_cohomology-2.1.5) consists of\n- Original sources of meataxe-2.2.4, together with my \"fork\" of meataxe,\n- C-programs written by David Green, in src/present/,\n- GAP-functions written by David Green, in src/pGroupCohomology,\n- Singular-functions written by me, in src/pGroupCohomology,\n- Cython modules written by me, in src/pGroupCohomology,\n- documentation, including a doc builder taken (and modified) from old Sage versions,\n- a data base of cohomology rings for the groups of order 64.\n\nFor the new package, I suggest:\n- `meataxe-2.4.24` is used, as provided by the package from #12103.\n- The C-programs of David Green, converted to work with the new MeatAxe, will be a new optional package called `modular_resolutions-1.0` (or do you prefer `modres-1.0`?) depending on `meataxe`, adding me as a second author, as the conversion to the new MeatAxe was very nontrivial, and I also added error handling.\n- The database will also be part of `modular_resolutions`.\n- The Cython modules will become optional extensions in the SageMath library, say, `sage.groups.modular_cohomology`, depending on `modular_resolutions` and on `database_gap`. In that way, the documentation would be taken care of.\n- Where shall the Singular and GAP functions go? Is there a natural place? There is `SAGE_LOCAL/share/singular/` for the Singular functions. But for GAP?\n\nRemark: `database_gap` is needed because of the SmallGroups library. Technically, the upcoming `modular_resolutions` (or `modres`) package would not depend on it; but it is needed in the cohomology computations, thus, perhaps it makes still sense to add `database_gap` as a dependency of `modular_resolutions`?",

I am now confident that it is feasible to make the group cohomology software work with the new optional meataxe package from #12103. I managed to rewrite the stand-alone programs of David Green needed in the package, and the rest "should work" (TM) by search-and-replace operations (really, ALL names in meataxe have changed).

But I have questions concerning the new code structure.

The old spkg (p_group_cohomology-2.1.5) consists of
- Original sources of meataxe-2.2.4, together with my "fork" of meataxe,
- C-programs written by David Green, in src/present/,
- GAP-functions written by David Green, in src/pGroupCohomology,
- Singular-functions written by me, in src/pGroupCohomology,
- Cython modules written by me, in src/pGroupCohomology,
- documentation, including a doc builder taken (and modified) from old Sage versions,
- a data base of cohomology rings for the groups of order 64.

For the new package, I suggest:
- `meataxe-2.4.24` is used, as provided by the package from #12103.
- The C-programs of David Green, converted to work with the new MeatAxe, will be a new optional package called `modular_resolutions-1.0` (or do you prefer `modres-1.0`?) depending on `meataxe`, adding me as a second author, as the conversion to the new MeatAxe was very nontrivial, and I also added error handling.
- The database will also be part of `modular_resolutions`.
- The Cython modules will become optional extensions in the SageMath library, say, `sage.groups.modular_cohomology`, depending on `modular_resolutions` and on `database_gap`. In that way, the documentation would be taken care of.
- Where shall the Singular and GAP functions go? Is there a natural place? There is `SAGE_LOCAL/share/singular/` for the Singular functions. But for GAP?

Remark: `database_gap` is needed because of the SmallGroups library. Technically, the upcoming `modular_resolutions` (or `modres`) package would not depend on it; but it is needed in the cohomology computations, thus, perhaps it makes still sense to add `database_gap` as a dependency of `modular_resolutions`?

Concerning "upstream": David Green is the original upstream. But as much as I know his code has never been published outside of the old spkg. And since the rebase on top of meataxe-2.4.24 was major, I believe that I am to some extent upstream, too.

The original sources that David Green gave me are in a folder called "present". But I doubt that a user having a look at the list of optional packages would guess that "present" is about modular resolutions of p-groups. From my perspective, "modular_resolutions" is a bit lengthy. I will ask David, after all he is native speaker.

Pure GAP code, in the files `src/pGroupCohomology/GapMB`, `.../GapMaxels` and `.../GapSgs`.

Is `src/ext/gap` somehow known to Gap? Or does one need to give the full path when loading code from there into Gap?

I got answer of David Green.
- He agrees that, by porting the code on top of the new meataxe, I became a co-author.
- He coined his package "present", because the original purpose was to deal with presentations of modular group algebras of prime power groups.
- If I understand correctly, he wouldn't mind renaming it.

I believe that the main purpose of the code is not to compute a presentation of a modular group algebra, but to compute a minimal projective resolution of the modular group algebra. At least that's what I am using it for.

Since the old package is called p_group_cohomology and the cohomology part will be moved to the Sage library, the package's responsibility will be to compute resolutions. Perhaps (to remind the old name) p_resolution? I find modular_resolution too long, Jeroen finds modres too abbreviated (I guess).

well, by package I just meant a way to package GAP files in a way understood by GAP.

Of course, you can also use GAP's `Read()` command to load any GAP code from anywhere in the filesystem.

```
sage: gap.eval('Read("'+SAGE_LOCAL+'/foo/blah.g")') # GAP
sage: libgap.Read('"'+SAGE_LOCAL+'/foo/blah.g"') # libGAP
```

<a id='comment:69'></a>
I think I need help, as I am virtually a beginner with Makefiles, compiling c-sources, and/or creating a library.

For creating .o-files, I have the following rule in my Makefile, where
- VPATH is the path to the sources
- `CFLAGS=-I$(MTXINC) -I$(VPATH) -Wall $(OO) -g -fPIC`
- MTXINC is the SAGE_LOCAL/include

```
%.o: $(VPATH)/pgroup.h $(VPATH)/pincl.h $(VPATH)/pincl_decls.h $(VPATH)/$*.c
	@echo "Compiling $*.c"
	@$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $(VPATH)/$*.c -o $@
```
The above is a modification of MeatAxe's Makefile, which says

```
tmp/%.o: tmp/mk.dir src/%.c src/meataxe.h tmp/config.h
	@echo "Compiling $*.c"
	@$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c src/$*.c -o $@
```

While the rule in MeatAxe's Makefile works, in my Makefile it is not executed. For example, when making pinc.o, the following is printed to stdout:

```
gcc -I/home/king/Sage/git/sage/local/include -I/home/king/Projekte/coho/p_group_cohomology-3.0/src/present/src -Wall  -g -fPIC    -c -o pincl.o /home/king/Projekte/coho/p_group_cohomology-3.0/src/present/src/pincl.c
```
In particular, the `@echo "compiling ..."` statement is not executed.

So, what is happening here? Is there an implicit make rule that takes precedence over the explicit rule??

And further, when I try to build an executable (say, `makeInclusionMatrix`), the rule says

```
makeInclusionMatrix: libmodres.a mim.o
	$(CC) $(LFLAGS) -o makeInclusionMatrix mim.o libmodres.a
```
with
- `LFLAGS=-l$(MTXLIBNAME) -L$(LIBDIR)`, 
- MTXLIBNAME=mtx
- LIBDIR=$(SAGE_LOCAL)/lib
Building the executable, the output indeed contains

```
gcc -lmtx -L/home/king/Sage/git/sage/local/lib  -o makeInclusionMatrix mim.o libmodres.a
```
but aborts with an error, saying

```
/home/king/Projekte/coho/p_group_cohomology-3.0/src/present/src/mim.c:51: undefined reference to `MatFree'
```

But `MatFree` and other "undefined references" are defined in `/home/king/Sage/git/sage/local/lib/libmtx.a`!

What is happening here?

I don't know. For an example in Sage, you can look at the `planarity` package.

as far as I can see, meataxe does not depend on any external libraries, right?
Then it's really easy to autotoolize/libtoolize.
An example of a Sage package I can suggest is  csdp (well, I did this libtoolization for it :-))
https://github.com/dimpase/csdp
it's more complicated as it needs Lapack and Blas.

I'll email you a pdf of a readable book about autotools, so that you can get an idea what's going on. (there is no readable free online up to day text for these purposes, AFAIK).

Can you help me to solve the following problem, please?

I would like to add a little test script that relies on a file test.reg that can be found in the same directory as modular_resolution.h.

In configure.ac, I have `AC_CONFIG_SRCDIR([src/modular_resolution.h])`

When I go to a new directory and do

```
/path/to/sources/of/modular_resolution/configure --prefix=`pwd`
```
then `make check` works. The file test.reg is sought in /path/to/source/of/modular_resolution/src, where it can indeed be found.

However, when I do `make distcheck` (which is a target provided by autotools), then first the distdir is created, and in distdir/_build the package is built and tested. Building it works fine. However, the test fails, because this time test.reg is sought in `../../src`. Apparently the test is executed in distdir/_build, not in distdir/_build/src. Thus, it should be sought in `../src`.

In other words, when doing "make check", an absolute path is used, whereas in "make distcheck" a wrong relative path is used.

How can that be fixed?

Meanwhile I have a version of the C-part of the old group cohomology package that installs fine and even passes a self-test (namely tests that several of the installed executables work together to build the basic data for the cohomology computation of the dihedral group of order 8).

However, so far I have no idea how to make it so that the package is only built if meataxe (from #12103) is installed.

And then of course I have to put all Singular and Gap files with the appropriate file name extensions into the appropriate folders, and put the Cython and Python code into the Sage library, as an optional extension.

If I understand correctly, it is needed to add "optional: modular_resolution" basically to each single line of test (several hundreds, I guess). Is there really no way to state that a whole file should only be tested optionally? I believe it is a fairly natural thing to test an optional extension optionally.

I have extracted the second stand-alone ingredient of the group cohomology package.

- First, install meataxe (see #12103).
- Second, get the branch from here.
- Third, get the sources for modular_resolution-1.0. It is based on the original source code of David Green, which I refactored rather extensively: It now uses the optional meataxe-2.4.24 package, rather than meataxe-2.2.4 sources that used to be part of the old spkg. It propagates errors (at least to some extent). And it is autotoolized. I am upstream, and you find the tarball at http://users.minet.uni-jena.de/cohomology/ (To be precise: http://users.minet.uni-jena.de/cohomology/modular_resolution-1.0.tar.bz2).

The next step will be to relocate all the Cython and Python source files from the old package into the SageMath library, say, sage.groups.modular_cohomology.

And the final step will be to fix the doctests somehow. I think there should be a way to declare that the tests of all files in sage.group.modular_cohomology are optional.

Question to the reviewer: I made the new package depend on database_gap. In fact, what really depends on database_gap is only the to-be-created wrapper in the Sage library. Since database_gap is non-GPL, I think it should only be installed (as a dependency) when the user agrees. Is that possible with the dependency framework of packages? Or better move the dependency to the wrapper?

Similarly to the MeatAxe wrapper, I plan to use `OptionalExtension()`. Hence, the Cython code would only result in an extension module under the condition that both modular_resolution and database_gap are installed.

So, if the current framework does not allow that installation of modular_resolutions stops for asking the users permission to install database_gap first, then we can make it so that modular_resolution only makes sure that meataxe is installed (no problem, both are GPL compatible, and modular_resolution will build and test fine), and then the `OptionalExtension()` will depend on both modular_resolution *and* database_gap.

Well, it's not more awkward than just `optional: modular_resolution` hundreds of times :-)

I think this is intentionally not supported. A doctest should make sense by itself, not depend on external context like the file it appears in.

Good point. Out of lack of experience I have no preference for either static or dynamic libraries (I heard that the former can be a little faster, but not by much). And I am really not sure if my Makefile.am results in a dynamic or a static library:

```Makefile
lib_LIBRARIES               = libmodres.a
libmodres_a_SOURCES         = aufloesung.c aufnahme.c fileplus.c nBuchberger.c pgroup.c pincl.c slice.c urbild.c
libmodres_a_CFLAGS          = -fPIC
```
I guess it is dynamic. But how to create a static library (if that's desired)?

```
lib_LTLIBRARIES = libmodres.la
libmodres_la_SOURCES = aufloesung.c aufnahme.c fileplus.c nBuchberger.c pgroup.c pincl.c slice.c urbild.c

OK.

So, the difference is that it is lib_LTLIBRARIES, not lib_LIBRARIES, and that the file name extension is .la, not .a.

What about -fPIC? Well, I will see if it is still needed.

Don't mix the two things `;-)`

- Meataxe is at #12103, the filenames are English, I only added one file window.c (thus, English as well), and I will *not* do upstream's job of autotoolisation.
- Here is modular_resolution, which was originally written by a native English speaker in Wuppertal, and he chose the filenames. By rebasing it on top of the new meataxe and by using autotools, I became part of upstream, but I didn't change the filenames.

After all, SageMath is an international project...

By the way, I am really glad that you guys convinced me of using autotools. It really is so much easier!

Perhaps I should add that the old spkg used several default locations for data.

- `SAGE_SHARE/pGroupCohomology` for data that are obtained during installation of the package, which are shared among different users of one Sage installation, and which are not supposed to be modified by a user, unless (s)he knows what (s)he is doing and has write permission.
- `DOT_SAGE/pGroupCohomology` for data that are created by a user, and which are only available to this user.

Is `SAGE_SHARE/pGroupCohomology` still a good location for shared data? If that is the case, then I think `GroupNames.sobj` should go there. But how? If I understand correctly, SAGE_SHARE is not under version control. Is it a possibility to add these data files in the modular_resolution tarball, and modifying its Makefile so that the data are installed in `SAGE_SHARE/pGroupCohomology`?

Hrmph. I need more help.

I created a data/ directory and put the untar'd cohomology data into that directory. Thus, data/ now has 268 sub-directories, namely 8gp3/ and 64gp1/ up to 64gp267/. The aim is to copy all these sub-directories into $(prefix)/share/pGroupCohomology (and to create $(prefix)/share/pGroupCohomology in the first place).

What I tried is to put the following into data/Makefile.am:

```Makefile
dbdir    = $(prefix)/share/pGroupCohomology
nobase_db_DATA  = $(wildcard *gp*)
```
expecting that "make install" would create the directory and then recursively (because of nobase_) copy all folders *gp* into it.

However, autoreconf complains that `wildcard *gp*: non-POSIX variable name`, and when I do make install, then there is no `share/pGroupCohomology`, and from the log I don't see any attempt to install any data.

What do I need to do instead?

It works *almost*: I can do make install and make clean and make uninstall and so on, but nonetheless make distcheck fails. And I don't understand why.

I have this in the top-level Makefile.am:

```Makefile
ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS = -I m4
SUBDIRS = src

dbdir      = $(datadir)/pGroupCohomology
dist_db_DATA    = group_cohomology_database.tar

install-data-hook:
	cd $(dbdir) && tar xf $(dist_db_DATA)

uninstall-hook:
	rm -r $(dbdir)

clean-local:
	rm $(dbdir)/$(dist_db_DATA)
```

When I run make distcheck, then the command `cd $(dbdir)` in install-data-hook fails. The odd reason: `datadir` is `/home/king/Projekte/coho/bin/modular_resolution-1.0/_inst/share` (I checked that), but during "make distcheck" the data are installed NOT in `datadir` but in `/tmp/am-dc-11743//home/king/Projekte/coho/bin/modular_resolution-1.0/_inst/share/pGroupCohomology`. Consequently, when I want to cd into dbdir, the folder can't be found.

Do you have an idea why distcheck installs data not into datadir but into a temporary folder, whereas make install correctly installs into datadir?

I can easily put the Gap code into $SAGE_ROOT/src/ext/gap/modular_cohomology/: It is under version control.

However, $SAGE_ROOT/local/share/singular is not under version control. Does that mean I should better use a different location for the Singular code?

The work is almost done, but according to discussions on sage-devel I should not proceed according to the original ticket description. Hence, in this comment, I explain why, and then I will change the ticket description.

Replying to [ticket:18514 SimonKing]:

However, due to recent backward incompatible changes in Sage, the package would not install, respectively it would install if some header were present but wouldn't work.

And it has happened again: Meanwhile I offer an old-style spkg version 2.1.6, and both new versions do nothing but coping with backward incompatible changes.

This is still the case --- based on meataxe, there is an alternative implementation of matrices in the Sage src tree, and that will be used

Note that soon I will create a ticket to add a few methods to the meataxe wrapper that I intend to use in my cohomology programs.

> - Third, get the sources for modular_resolution-1.0. It is based on code of David Green, which I refactored rather extensively:

I was told on sage-devel to *not* move the code to the Sage src tree, but make it an *external* package that depends on the meataxe spkg, and is formed by two parts: The first is a C library together with some executables provided by what above was called modular_resolution-1.0, and a pip-installable package formed by cython and python files. Reasons:

- My package adds functionality, but doesn't modify existing functionality.
- In order to use it, it isn't needed to cimport from my package.
- People wouldn't like to have more than 10,000 lines of code in the src tree that is useless without some optional package.
- There currently is no easy way to make all doctests in one file optional.

That said, I still believe that *for me* working in the src tree would be better; for the record:

- Currently I do the development in the src tree anyway. So, moving stuff from the src tree into an external package is a nontrivial additional step for me.
- Building the docs of python/cython code outside of the src tree is a nontrivial additional step for me.
- Being in the src tree would make it less likely that backward incompatible Sage changes breaking my package will happen unnoticed again.
- Having the documentation of my optional package in the Sage docs would make more people aware, so that they would be more likely to use my programs in research.

My old-style package does contain a setup.py for installing the cython and python code, and it is able to build a documentation (basically by a modified copy of an old version of Sage's docbuilder). However, very likely both is not how it should be done.

I have three requests to the reviewers:
1. Please point me to a good example of a setup.py in a new-style spkg for installing Cython code that cimports Sage types (such as Element and Parent).
2. Please point me to a good example of a new-style spkg that teaches me how to build a nice documentation based on docstrings.

I guess it is better to provide code at some point. There are many doctest failures (many of them just because of different logging), none of them is marked optional, but as much as I see it would be possible to do non-trivial computations with the new code version.

__INSTALLATION__

- Put http://users.minet.uni-jena.de/cohomology/modular_resolution-1.0.tar.gz into SAGE_ROOT/upstream/
- Pull the git branch
- Do `sage -i meataxe` and `sage -i modular_resolution`
- Do `make`

__HOWEVER...__

The current branch does everything in Sage's src tree, which (as I was told) is evil.

But perhaps some of you can answer the questions that I have posted earlier: What do I need to do with the current code base in order to create a pip-installable module and build its documentation?

There are good news:

I have just finished `unit_test_64`, which does a computation of the cohomology rings of all groups of order 64, compares the results with the data in the data base, and provides timings.

The results obtained with the new package version coincide with the old data. Moreover, the computation on a laptop with Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-5200U CPU @ 2.20GHz and 8GB of RAM only took 27:32 minutes of wall time resp. 15:56 minutes of CPU time, which is pretty fast.

Out of curiosity, I will repeat the test on the same machine with the old package version, and see how long it takes.

It takes roughly the same time. Actually the old package was two minutes faster.

Since the old version was a little faster, I did some profiling. The profiler told me that much time is spent (both with the old and the new version) on `do_system`. With the help of sage-devel, I could track it down to several calls to `system()`, which all turned out to be useless.

I currently do not have the bandwidth to post the new version of modular_resolution-1.0.tar.gz, and will do so on Monday.

Done.

And in addition I obtained some further minor improvements, basically by using a C profiler. The computation of the modular cohomology rings of all groups of order 64 on my laptop now takes about 6:50 min of wall time resp. 6:10 min of CPU time (plus the time spent by Singular and GAP, which counts for the wall time but not for the CPU time).

I started to do time series to optimise the default choice of some options, but the standard deviation is considerable. So, I guess I'll stick with the C profiler...

Let me come back to my question: How can I move this away from the src tree and make it an independent package while being able to build a nice documentation and to run doc tests? Note that all this did work in the old spkg, but certainly can be done a lot better.

If MeatAxe was a standard spkg (which might actually be something to consider) and the SmallGroups library was GPL compatible (something which the authors refuse), I could promote the modular group cohomology computation as a new standard package: With the changes that I just pushed, all tests pass (on my machine at least), and moreover the computations have still become faster.

This is most easily treated as two separate things (the C library + the Cython wrapper). There are plenty examples for each of those two. Simple examples are https://github.com/graph-algorithms/edge-addition-planarity-suite for the C library and https://github.com/defeo/cypari2 for the Cython wrapper.

> - Please point me to an example of a new style spkg that builds documentation based on doc strings in the Cython code.


https://github.com/sagemath/cysignals (result: http://cysignals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

See also http://opendreamkit.org/2017/06/09/CythonSphinx/

These are all standard Sage packages (`planarity`, `cypari` and `cysignals`)

Now I guess the meataxe problems are basically dealt with in #23352, #23400, #23399 and #21437. Therefore I have rebased the current cohomology code.

The current layout is:
1. MeatAxe is a separate optional package
2. The C code of David Green to compute minimal resolutions is a separate package, which also installs the data base of cohomology rings of all groups of order 64 and which also installs certain GAP and Singular code interpreted modules.
3. The Python and Cython code is in the Sage source tree. The Cython code is optional extension module, which needs the package from 2. as a build time dependency. Moreover, at run time, it depends on the small groups library.

What layout should there be, instead? I guess MeatAxe has to stay separate. But shall everything else be included in one optional (new-style) spkg? So, that spkg would provide 2. and 3.?

Apparently, the Cython code can not stay in the source tree, as it doesn't qualify as optional extension module.

Possible layouts:

1. Two packages
   - meataxe (as it is now)
   - everything else put into one upstream tarball, giving rise to one new-style spkg

2. Three packages
   - meataxe (as it is now)
   - C code in one upstream tarball, giving rise to a new-style spkg "modular_resolution" that provides a C library and some executables but would probably be of no interest on its own?
   - Cython and Python code in another upstream tarball, giving rise to another new-style spkg "p_group_cohomology" that depends on "modular_resolution".

Would it be OK to have an spkg "modular_resolution" if it basically has no other purpose than being a dependency for "p_group_cohomology"?

And I still wonder what to do with the GAP code and the Singular code. On the one hand, such code clearly belongs to src/ext/gap respectively to src/ext/singular. On the other hand, an spkg is not supposed to inject code into src/ext.

Is it ok to put the relevant files into src/ext even when the optional packages are not installed? I would think so; after all, the files I am talking about are not particularly large.

Although if it could not have any independent interest/development, then it probably would be better to fold it into `p_group_cohomology` from a more macro-scale maintenance viewpoint. I guess it makes the p_group_cohomology less homogeneous as a project? I also had the impression that it would be able to be a standalone library.\n\n> And I still wonder what to do with the GAP code and the Singular code. On the one hand, such code clearly belongs to src/ext/gap respectively to src/ext/singular. On the other hand, an spkg is not supposed to inject code into src/ext.\n\n\nI feel like those are no different than having Cython files whose compilation depends on an optional spkg or Python files that are only useful if an optional spkg is installed. So, by analogy, they should not be injected by the spkg during its installation, but instead part of the main Sage git control.\n\n> Is it ok to put the relevant files into src/ext even when the optional packages are not installed? I would think so; after all, the files I am talking about are not particularly large.\n\n\nIMO, I think it is fine to put it in the source tree if it is meant to be something for Sage as suggested above. I'm not sure if I have a complete understanding of everything at this point to say anything definitive about what you should do in this situation. Also, someone might come along and say you should do it all in a pip package, but then I feel it is more likely to break on future upgrades of Sage.",

Can you elaborate a bit more on this? I don't quite understand why not from a quick glance.

Yes, this is perfectly fine to have this kind of granularity. Although if it could not have any independent interest/development, then it probably would be better to fold it into `p_group_cohomology` from a more macro-scale maintenance viewpoint. I guess it makes the p_group_cohomology less homogeneous as a project? I also had the impression that it would be able to be a standalone library.

> And I still wonder what to do with the GAP code and the Singular code. On the one hand, such code clearly belongs to src/ext/gap respectively to src/ext/singular. On the other hand, an spkg is not supposed to inject code into src/ext.


I feel like those are no different than having Cython files whose compilation depends on an optional spkg or Python files that are only useful if an optional spkg is installed. So, by analogy, they should not be injected by the spkg during its installation, but instead part of the main Sage git control.

> Is it ok to put the relevant files into src/ext even when the optional packages are not installed? I would think so; after all, the files I am talking about are not particularly large.


IMO, I think it is fine to put it in the source tree if it is meant to be something for Sage as suggested above. I'm not sure if I have a complete understanding of everything at this point to say anything definitive about what you should do in this situation. Also, someone might come along and say you should do it all in a pip package, but then I feel it is more likely to break on future upgrades of Sage.

David Green's code to compute resolutions of modular group algebras of finite p-groups has originally been a bunch of executables operating on data stored on disk. I made a standalone library out of it.

So, it *could* be used on its own, but I guess nobody has ever done.

Currently, I am developer for both the C / Gap code that I inherited from David Green, and for the Cython / Python / Singular code that I wrote myself. I do not foresee active development for the C code in the near future.

It is more like "some code snippets which can be used by some optional package that the user may install". So, I could understand that we wouldn't like to have these code snippets in the src tree. However, they are supposed to be used in Sage's GAP and Singular, and thus it makes sense to put them into src/sage/libs. That's the dilemma...

The GAP functions currently are in files and are loaded into GAP like this:

```
        if not gap('IsBoundGlobal("exportMTXLIB")'):
            gap.eval('Read("%s/src/ext/gap/modular_cohomology/GapMaxels.g");'%(SAGE_ROOT))
            gap.eval('Read("%s/src/ext/gap/modular_cohomology/GapMB.g");'%(SAGE_ROOT))
            gap.eval('Read("%s/src/ext/gap/modular_cohomology/GapSgs.g");'%(SAGE_ROOT))
            gap.eval('InstallValue(exportMTXLIB,"MTXLIB=%s; export MTXLIB; ")'%(os.path.join(DOT_SAGE,"meataxe")))
```
The Singular functions are in interpreted libraries that are loaded like this:

```
        singular.load('{}/dickson.lib'.format(os.path.join(SAGE_ROOT,'src','ext','singular')))
        singular.load('{}/filterregular.lib'.format(os.path.join(SAGE_ROOT,'src','ext','singular')))
```

It would be OK from my point of view to copy `filterregular.lib` and `dickson.lib` into the shared folder containing all Singular libraries. Then, one could simply do

```
        singular.LIB('dickson.lib')
        singular.LIB('filterregular.lib')
```
I certainly could make the modular cohomology package insert stuff into `SAGE_LOCAL/share/singular/LIB/`. Actually I'd prefer this.

And it would also be OK to have some kind of GAP package, so that one could say

```
        gap.LoadPackage('WhateverThisPackageIsCalled')
```
However, I simply don't know how to create a Gap package, thus, I'd appreciate a pointer.

Actually the GAP code is the only part of the group cohomology computation that calls external programs --- currently, for example, like that:

```
  Exec(Concatenation("mkdir -p ", dir));
...
  buffer := Concatenation(exportMTXLIB, "makeInclusionMatrix ", Gstem, " ", Hstem,
    " ", Istem);
  Print(buffer, "\n");
  Exec(buffer);
```
I somehow have the feeling that external programs (here: mkdir and !makeInclusionMatrix) shouldn't be called in that way. So, if gap_packages/example tells me how to do better, I'd be glad!

Maybe I misunderstood what you meant be "call external programs". In contrast to gap-packages/example, my gap package would simply consist of a bunch of gap-readable files, but it would not provide the c sources for the external programs it is calling.

The executables are part of a C code base which also provides a library. My Cython code is linked against that library. So, no, the executables aren't called anywhere else, but, yes, the package which the executables belong to is used somewhere else.

OK, makes sense then. This means it's simpler, in the sense that 
one won't really need much configure/makefile stuff, if at all.

This sounds like trouble. E.g. think about a multi-user situation...
Does it mean to be some soft of caching?
There is a package like this in GAP, [AtlasRep](https://www.gap-system.org/Packages/atlasrep.html). There data is fetched from the net, rather
than computed, IIRC.

I thought of a multi-user situation.

It's kind of similar.

- There is a repository in the web.
- There is a local repository that *all* users of a Sage installation can read; I call this the public database. Of course, only a user with write privileges can add data to the public database.
- Each user has his or her *own* local repository (I call it "private database"). The data in the private database is soft links to the public database (when the data is available there), otherwise is fetched from the web (when the data is available there), otherwise (or if explicitly requested) is computed from scratch.

In particular, in a multi-user setting, the users share the data from the public database. However, each user may individually compute further information on a cohomology ring, that is stored in his/her private database and won't interfere with the shared data.

Then you perhaps can borrow their design. Surely Thomas Breuer, the main developer of AtlasRep, would be glad to help.

Why do you need the latter? Don't you just call executables? They call `wget`.

The meataxe package provides a library "mtx" and some executables.

The C code in modular_resolution-1.0 (which is based on David Green's code but for which I became upstream) needs to link against mtx. It provides a library "modres" and some executables.

The Cython OptionalExtensions that you'll currently find in sage/groups/modular_cohomology (but that will be moved into a pip installable module!) need to be linked both against mtx and against modres.

I am not calling the meataxe executables directly. However, IIRC, the executables provided by modular_resolution-1.0 do call some meataxe executables.

At several stages of the cohomology computation, I need to call the modular_resolution executables; it results in many data files stored on disk in special folders, all data together determine an initial segment of the minimal projective resolution of the group algebra, and the data is then used by Cython code to compute the ring structure of the cohomology ring.

The calls to modular_resolution executables partially occur in GAP functions, and GAP functions are also responsible to create the special folders. However, the path of the special folders and also the names of the data files are determined by the Cython code. So, it should (when needed) be possible to move all the calls from GAP code to Cython code.

Concerning wget: It is the responsibility of my Python code to check whether the data of a cohomology ring are found locally. If data is to be fetched from web, which is done with Python's urllib2 module. I guess urllib2 uses wget, but I am not using wget directly.

I hope that clarified the structure of the code base.

run-time dependency is a dependency too.

OK, I see, you are saying that installing `modular_decomposition` should trigger installation of meataxe and database_gap (the format of `dependencies` there is weird, I am not sure these `$(INST)/` are the right thing - most if not all packages don't have it`)

I can only repeat myself. database_gap has NOTHING TO DO WHATSOEVER with MeatAxe.

So, if anything, we are talking here about a runtime dependency for what currently is (but soon will not be) OptionalExtension in sage/groups/modular_cohomology/. IIRC, I was told that the dependencies listed in OptionalExtension only concern build time dependencies (which is mtx and modres), but not runtime dependencies.

Replying to [dimpase](#comment%3A182):
> OK, I see, you are saying that installing `modular_decomposition` [ I guess you mean `modular_resolution` ] should trigger installation of meataxe and database_gap (the format of `dependencies` there is weird, I am not sure these `$(INST)/` are the right thing - most if not all packages don't have it`)


No, an automatic installation (without explicit consent of the user) of database_gap is not allowed (licence issue) and not proposed.

Also, there are various ways to install the SmallGroups library. So, I think the correct way to deal with the problem is:
- meataxe clearly has no dependency whatsoever.
- modular_resolution will still have the dependency `meataxe`, but no other dependency. I just checked: There is no use of SmallGroup in the whole code.
- take the current experimental OptionalExtension from sage/groups/modular_cohomology and put them into a pip installable upstream tarball `modular_group_cohomology`.
- `build/pkgs/modular_group_cohomology/dependencies` is, as far as I understand, for build time dependencies, thus, it will only list `meataxe` and `modular_resolution`, but not `database_gap`.
- `build/pkgs/spkg-install` will check that the SmallGroups library is in fact installed (it doesn't matter if it comes from database_gap or another source). If it isn't it will fail and advise the user to install it one way or another.

Thanks for finding this. I did do some computations in interactive sessions, but didn't run the test suite yet.

The point is that all the modules involved in the computation are supposed to use the same singular instance. And apparently I have changed something.

While we are at it: Is it OK to just import singular from sage.interfaces.singular? Or would you think it makes sense to provide a hook so that a user can plug in his/her own singular interface to the computation? I guess the former is easier and the latter doesn't add an advantage.

After dealing with #24359, I'm back at the cohomology package.

There now remains to deal with two things:
- C code providing a library `libmodres` and some binaries; it is autotoolized and links against libmtx.
- Python and Cython code linked against libmtx and libmodres and is NOT standalone as it makes use of Sage types and Sage infrastructure.

How would you recommend to proceed?
1. Have two separate packages `modular_resolution` (installing libmodres) and `p_group_cohomology` (pip-installing the Python/Cython modules) that the user has to install both?
2. Have a single package that both installs libmodres and the Python/Cython code?
3. Something else?

I somehow tend towards 2., since libmodres and the executables hardly are of any use without the Cython and Python code. But I can also see the advantage of a strict modularisation, as in 1.

The third topic for which I need pointers: Documentation.

When I was young, Sage's documentation used a script builder.py to build its documentation. In the first versions of the cohomology spkg, I copied and modified it. Now, I see that builder.py has gone from Sage.

The question is how I could most easily build a reference manual for my spkg from all the docstrings in Cython and Python.
- Somewhere I found a blog post of Jeroen about "sphinx and Cython", advising to compile the Cython code with `binding=True`. Is that currently done in Sage? Wouldn't that involve a mild slow-down?
- My impression is that using Sphinx with Cython is currently done in conf.py by replacing inspect.getargspec() by some custom version of getargspec() that works on Cython code.

This works. At least when using `compiler_directives={'embedsignature': True}` and then adding some helper function to `doc/sources/conf.py` that removes the signature from the docstring before passing it to sphinx.

To be more precise: a project *installed using distutils* (i.e. with `./setup.py install`) cannot be uninstalled with pip. However, a project *installed with pip* (using `pip install ...`) can be uninstalled with pip, even if the `setup.py` script uses distutils.\n\nI know, it's confusing :-) You should remember that pip is just a tool on top of either distutils or setuptools, it doesn't replace them. And many features of pip come from pip itself, not from the underlying distutils or setuptools.\n\n> So, should I use setuptools instead? Would that be able to build Cython code as well?\n\n\nPersonally, I would say: keep using distutils if that works for you. I'm sure that other people will disagree and say that you really should use setuptools.",

The difference may not be so important for Python, so simple packages can get away with ignoring this difference. Typically, a source tarball would contain certain auto-generated files that the source tree does not.

> * In the old spkg, I was using distutils in setup.py. But somewhere I found the information that `pip uninstall` won't work with distutils.


That is partially correct. To be more precise: a project *installed using distutils* (i.e. with `./setup.py install`) cannot be uninstalled with pip. However, a project *installed with pip* (using `pip install ...`) can be uninstalled with pip, even if the `setup.py` script uses distutils.

I know, it's confusing :-) You should remember that pip is just a tool on top of either distutils or setuptools, it doesn't replace them. And many features of pip come from pip itself, not from the underlying distutils or setuptools.

> So, should I use setuptools instead? Would that be able to build Cython code as well?


Personally, I would say: keep using distutils if that works for you. I'm sure that other people will disagree and say that you really should use setuptools.

Yes, that should work "out of the box".

No. See #22747 for that.

<a id='comment:6'></a>
Jeroen, I just tested `binding=True`.

First problem: The signature of methods of extension classes are not correctly determined. For example, I get

```
sage: from inspect import getargspec
sage: from pGroupCohomology.cochain import COCH    
sage: getargspec(COCH.setname)
ArgSpec(args=['self', 's', 'is_polyrep'], varargs=None, keywords=None, defaults=None)
```
but the method is

```
    def setname(self, s, is_polyrep=False):
```
and therefore the html documentation would *not* be built correctly.

Second problem: Performance.

```
sage: from pGroupCohomology.factory import unit_test_64
sage: L,t = unit_test_64()
...
#267: Walltime   9:24.40 min
      CPU-time   8:31.86 min
      Singular   0:48.71 min
      Gap-time   0:19.50 min
```

Here is what I get with the current version of the package (i.e., with `embedsignature=True` and more elaborate helper functions):

```
sage: from sage.misc.sageinspect import sage_getargspec
sage: from pGroupCohomology.cochain import COCH
sage: sage_getargspec(COCH.setname)
ArgSpec(args=['self', 's', 'is_polyrep'], varargs=None, keywords=None, defaults=(False,))
```
Here, inspect.getargspec won't work at all, but sage_getargspec gives a correct answer, which can also be seen in the [published package documentation](http://users.minet.uni-jena.de/cohomology/documentation).

And concerning performance:

```
sage: from pGroupCohomology.factory import unit_test_64
sage: L,t = unit_test_64()
...
#267: Walltime   7:50.20 min
      CPU-time   6:59.89 min
      Singular   0:46.04 min
      Gap-time   0:20.58 min
```

**Conclusion**

The loss in performance is quite noticeable, and moreover, `binding=True` doesn't help with the documentation. Therefore, I won't use it.

Now I am puzzled. The monkey-patch you suggested is:

```python
     def isfunction(obj):
         return hasattr(type(obj), "__code__")

     import inspect
     inspect.isfunction = isfunction
```
However, when you inspect `inspect.isfunction, you'll find

```python
Signature: inspect.isfunction(obj)
Source:   
def isfunction(obj):
    """
    ...
    """
    # We use type(obj) instead of just obj to avoid __getattr__().
    # Some types, like methods, will return the __code__ of the
    # underlying function in __getattr__() but we don't want to
    # detect those as functions.
    return hasattr(type(obj), "__code__")
```
So, the patch seems pointless.

For reference: In order to achieve global dominance (i.e., to make the future package version `p_group_cohomology-3.1` a standard package of Sage), the following would be needed in preparation:

1. Make SharedMeatAxe standard. I think it *should* be standard anyway, as it offers matrix arithmetic over small non-prime fields of odd characteristics that is vastly superior compared with the currently used `Matrix_generic_dense`.
2. Remove the dependency on the SmallGroups library. In fact, the current cohomology package is able to create the cohomology ring of a group as long as it can be expressed as a permutation group in GAP; one doesn't necessarily need to know the SmallGroups address of it.

In that way, the cohomology package would only depend on standard packages, and thus the Cython parts of it could be moved into the Sage src tree.

However, it would be good if `p_group_cohomology-3.0` (which this ticket is about) could be reviewed first.

In any case, I should cope with that API change.
Question: Should it give rise to a new package version 3.0.1, or can it remain 3.0? From my point of view, publication of the package is only finished as soon as it became an optional package in SageMath, hence, I consider the current tar ball not as a "published version".

I guess you are missing a dependency on the Sage library. But to be completely honest, I don't really know how to declare that dependency. This is the first package like this.

Now seriously??? I just got used to using yet another Sage build tool. So then, why not use plain `pip install`, too?

Also, what seems to be the problem? modular_resolution is an autotoolized package, and I'd rather say that if `sdh_make_install` doesn't work on it then the fix should be in Sage, not in the package.

But since I don't intend to wait for yet another ticket (namely one for fixing `sdh_make_install`), I'll switch back to using `$MAKE` and `$MAKE install`.

The problem is that Sage is trying to separate the build and install steps of packages. This is in general a good thing to do. But in your package, the *build* of `p_group_cohomology` relies on the *installation* of `modular_resolution`.

> I'll switch back to using `$MAKE` and `$MAKE install`.


Only `$MAKE install` should be affected.

Line 33? That's puzzling:

```
$ wc -l build/pkgs/p_group_cohomology/spkg-install 
27 build/pkgs/p_group_cohomology/spkg-install
```

Anyway, I guess the problem arises in these lines:

```
if [ `echo "SmallGroup(13,1); quit;" | gap -b -T | grep "13"` = "" ]; then
   echo "=================================================================="
   echo "| Warning: It seems that GAP's SmallGroups library is missing.   |"
   echo "| It is a runtime dependency for the p_group_cohomology package. |"
   echo "| One way to install it is as part of the database_gap package.  |"
   echo "=================================================================="
fi
```

I was once told that this is how to test whether SmallGroups is installed. But now I see that executing the test (in a Sage shell and without SmallGroups installed) gives this:

```
(sage-sh) king@king-C70-B:sage$ echo "SmallGroup(13,1); quit;" | gap -b -T | grep "13"
Error, the Small Groups library is required but not installed
```

Not ideal.

Two potential ways out:

1. Put `database_gap` into the dependencies, which it seems is what you want me to do anyway. This would ensure that SmallGroups is installed. But technically my package does *not* depend on the full `database-gap` but on SmallGroups only, which theoretically could be installed in different ways. By consequence, I would also need to adapt some parts of the documentation and I guess of SPKG.txt.
2. Find a different way of testing whether SmallGroups is installed or not.

OTOH: Is it possible and does it make sense to put `sagelib` into the dependencies of the package? After all, it does link against stuff from the sage library.

- Add `database_gap` as a dependency. I am not totally happy about it, but as it seems the dependency will soon be GPL compatible.
- Remove the test for SmallGroup from spkg-install, as it is now tested by the dependency list.
- Change accents (Sikirić, Poincaré) both in SPKG.txt and in the index.rst file of the documentation (in the docstrings, I did use accents already).
- Fix the information on where it find the local documentation (it used to tell that it can be found in `SAGE_LOCAL/share/p_group_cohomology/html/`, but it is `SAGE_LOCAL/share/p_group_cohomology/`.
- Fix the checksum and update both the documentation and the tarball on the project's web pages.

OK, good point. For the autotools part, I did already. But for the Python part I didn't.

OK, as soon as I read the `xz` manual, I'll try it.

What does that mean? Are you saying that the `dependencies` file should contain this:

```
meataxe | database_gap
```
?

Now I recall why I didn't use `python setup.py sdist` --- because actually I tried it before.

`python setup.py sdist` creates a gzipped tar file that contains the .c files, but neither the .pyx nor the .pxd files. So, it is not a source distribution in the sense of a cython source distribution.

I put Manifest.in in the same folder as setup.py, and it contains this:

```
include COPYING 
global-include pGroupCohomology/*.py pGroupCohomology/*.pyx pGroupCohomology/*.pxd pGroupCohomology/*.pxi

global-exclude pGroupCohomology/*.c

prune dist
```
Before that, I tried to be less specific and only wrote `*.py` instead of `pGroupCohomology/*.py`. However, the effect is that all `.pxd` files and all `.c` files are INCLUDED and all `.py` and `.pyx` files are missing.

So, what did I do wrong?

Thanks for spotting it. readhdrplus is declared in fp_decls.h, but the header is not included in slice.c.

I too noticed some warnings. But which ones are serious and which aren't? What is the criterion?

The current version of modular_resolution (as sub-package of p_group_cohomology) should now install without warning. The only warnings left in the installation of the package seem harmless to me: Some cython variables may be used uninitialised (but in fact I checked at some point that they will definitely be used initialised; their initialisation is in some "if-then-else" construct), some probably harmless warning from `python setup.py ...`:

```
    reading manifest template 'MANIFEST.in'
    warning: no files found matching '*.pxi' under directory 'pGroupCohomology'
    warning: no previously-included files matching '*.o' found under directory 'pGroupCohomology'
    warning: no previously-included files matching '*.so' found under directory 'pGroupCohomology'
    warning: no previously-included files matching '*' found under directory 'doc/build'
```
and a warning concerning docs:

```
copying static files... WARNING: html_static_path entry u'/home/king/Sage/git/sage/local/var/tmp/sage/build/p_group_cohomology-3.0/src/pyxsources/doc/source/_static' does not exist
```
I would expect that `graft doc/source` in MANIFEST.in would also copy the empty folder `doc/source/_static`, but apparently it doesn't. Since the documenation builds fine, I'd say one can ignore that warning.

All in `.massey_power`, or in very different kinds of tests? What is particular about ppc64le? If I recall correctly, there have been some issues on that machine with meataxe matrices (that we have solved, though).

Yes, that was it. Under what circumstances would it be a problem? Only if one treats a char like a byte, i.e., if one does arithmetic computations with it, right?

In any case, I see the same error on my computer, too. So, there must be a recent fix that broke things...

On OS X, two issues: first, I couldn't get it to install at all because

```
/bin/bash: .././install-sh: Permission denied
```
Once I changed permissions on `src/csources/install-sh` to make it executable, the package installed.

Second, I get lots of doctest failures:

```

I am a bit puzzled, as on my machine I have

```
$ ls -l install-sh 
-rw-r--r-- 1 king king 13997 Jan  7  2016 install-sh
```
and thus it isn't executable either, but the package does install.

But if it is needed on some machines to change the permission, then I should do it.

Hm. Now I am even more puzzled.

`meataxe` is declared as a dependency of the package. Thus, installation of the cohomology package should fail if meataxe isn't installed - and installation of meataxe does involve `sage -b`, as there are optional cython modules in the Sage library.

Maybe I should ask on sage-devel what exactly is the meaning of a dependency of a package, and why install.sh works on some machines and on others not.

Yes, `sage -b` is essential for installing meataxe.

No, it does not and this is why it fails.

This is not easy to solve because `make` does not allow to specify optional dependencies (*). Ideally, we would like to say that `sagelib` depends on `meataxe` if `meataxe` has been installed but I don't know how to do that.

(*) interestingly, it does allow the exact opposite: you can specify that A depends on B only if B has *not* been installed yet.

Maybe I should have been clearer: There are optional Cython modules in the Sage library depending on meataxe, and the cohomology package uses both meataxe as a c-library libmtx and uses the optional Cython modules in the Sage library.

But while the dependency on libmtx is a build time dependency, IIUC the dependency on the optional Cython modules is a runtime dependency (that's because the .pxd headers are present anyway).

> This is not easy to solve because `make` does not allow to specify optional dependencies (*). Ideally, we would like to say that `sagelib` depends on `meataxe` if `meataxe` has been installed but I don't know how to do that.


It was suggested on sage-devel that `meataxe`'s `spkg-install` should end with `sage -b`. So, if it is OK that an optional package triggers building the optional modules in the sage library, that'll be the cleanest solution, I think.

If I recall correctly, it is totally fine for a GPL package to have a runtime dependency that isn't GPL (but it is not OK if it is a build time dependency). Is it OK if installation of a GPL package automatically triggers the installation of a non-GPL package that will be used at runtime?

And that's the situation here. database_gap is still non-GPL, although IIRC its authors finally agreed to relicense it. And p_group_cohomology uses database_gap at run time (i.e., also its test suite depends on it).

Cool thing!

Would it only trigger `sage -b` if the test suite is run, or also when just building the package without running tests?

I couldn't find a documentation of `$(SAGERUNTIME)`.

Where exactly should `$(SAGERUNTIME)` be placed? I.e., should `build/pkgs/p_group_cohomology/dependencies` be

```
meataxe | database_gap xz $(SAGERUNTIME)
```
or rather

```
meataxe $(SAGERUNTIME) | database_gap xz
```
?

Note that p_group_cohomology links against the Sage library. So, I'd guess it should be the latter version, correct?

Interesting. Apparently these are the same dictionaries, but sorting works differently (i.e., is machine dependent).

So, question: How to test that a returned dictionary is what one has expected, if sorting the items doesn't work? Perhaps I should just remove the key `prime`, assuming that sorting integers still works.

Interesting. That test is supposed to compare the efficiency of different algorithms, and when I created the tests I took care that the quotients of timings are well within the range `[0.5, 2]`.

Is it possible for you to manually recreate the test, to see in what range the quotient of timings is located? But perhaps I should just mark this test "random".

A very bad idea. That will badly break parallel builds: you might end up with two instances of `make` both building the Sage library.

It will trigger `sage -b` unconditionally.

Note that it is not guaranteed that it will run `sage -b` *after* building `meataxe` (this is the part that cannot be fixed). In a serial build `make` uses the order as specified in the dependencies, so that is why it is better to put `$(SAGERUNTIME)` after `meataxe`.

What do you mean by "every time"? Do you mean that a change in the Sage library followed by `make` would trigger rebuilding `p_group_cohomology`? In that case I'd actually prefer the alternative, as I've seen too often that a change in sagelib leaves the cohomology spkg broken, making it necessary to rebuild it.

Ideally, it should of course only be rebuilt if critical headers change, say, sage/structure/element.pxd. But I guess that's not possible, unless all pyx files are put into the sage library.

I see now. What is compared are two ways to lift a chain map. One method ("autolift") is used by default in small degrees, as it is fast but tends to consume much memory in higher degrees; thus, the other method ("Urbild Gröbnerbasis") is used in higher degrees.

It is stated in the comment before the text that autolift used to be 250 times faster than Urbild-GB, but after some recent optimisations they became comparable. They still are comparable, on my machine (since the test passes), but on your machine autolift is about 10 times faster than Urbild-GB.

I will change the test so that I give the output on my machine, mark the test as "random", and include in the comment that the ratio is highly machine dependent.

```
sage: from pGroupCohomology.cochain import COCH
sage: from pGroupCohomology import CohomologyRing
sage: CohomologyRing.set_user_db(tmp_dir())
sage: H = CohomologyRing(8,3, from_scratch=True)
sage: R = H.resolution()
sage: C = COCH(H,2,'C',[1,0,1])
sage: c0 = R.CochainToChainmap(2, C.MTX())

sage: R.makeAutolift(2)

Concerning autolift: I am currently playing with the default degree up to which the autolift method is used. Let `n` be a number, and then I do

```
sage: from pGroupCohomology.factory import unit_test_64
sage: from pGroupCohomology.auxiliaries import coho_options
sage: coho_options['autolift'] = n
sage: unit_test_64()
```

Here are the figures I'm getting (the first item should be `[]`, and the second item is a tuple "wall time, cpu time of Sage, cpu time of Singular, cpu time of GAP":

- n=0

  ```
  ([], [396.6325900554657, 352.84, 38.83, 18.056])
  ```
- n=1, which is the current default

  ```
  ([], [391.3751630783081, 350.676, 37.89, 17.484])
  ```
- n=2, which used to be the default in an older version of the spkg

  ```
  ([], [386.2917420864105, 345.348, 37.52, 17.628])
  ```
- n=3

  ```
  ([], [386.8177170753479, 346.348, 37.6, 18.056])
  ```
- n=4

  ```
  ([], [385.62233090400696, 346.06399999999996, 37.18, 17.368])
  ```

  ```
  ([], [400.68896293640137, 356.97999999999996, 39.72, 18.344])
  ```

Of course each test was in a separate Sage session.

I think the numbers indicate that I should return to the old default, n=2. But, John, since the two lifting methods differ a lot more on your machine than on mine, could you perhaps do these tests as well and tell me the results?

Ouch, that's not what I want. So, I'll put `$(SAGERUNTIME)` to the very end of the dependencies.

And who knows, perhaps in the future it will be possible to put everything into the sage library. My plan for version 3.1 is:
- Make `meataxe` standard (rationale: It is A LOT faster than the generic implementation of matrices over non-prime fields of odd characteristic)
- Make `p_group_cohomology` work without the SmallGroups library. There are only few places where I really use the SmallGroups identifiers.

If I understand correctly, these used to be the two main obstructions against putting p_group_cohomology into the sage library.

If you look at the development of this ticket, at some point I did put all cython and python modules into the sage library. I was told at some point that `OptionalExtension` should only be used when the optional extension provides a different implementation of a functionality that is also provided by the default sage library. In contrast, one shouldn't use `OptionalExtension` for functionality that would simply not be available without an optional spkg.

My dream for `p_group_cohomology-3.1` is to make it a standard package, and in that case all the python and cython modules should of course be in the sage library.

OK, in that case I could indeed return to the code layout that I had in some intermediate stage of development (i.e.: Have an optional `module_resolution-1.0` spkg and have everything else in the Sage library).

Potential issues:
- If I recall correctly, building documentation of an optional extension module is a problem. Can you confirm? What I'd really like to have is that the documentation of the optional extension in the Sage library is built even if the optional spkg is not installed.
- The cohomology computations need some helper files that rightfully belong to SAGE_SHARE (namely: code for Singular and GAP), which IIRC are not under version control. So, how to install them? Should `modular_resolution-1.0` be install them?
- Making the cohomology code optional extensions would mean to mark hundreds of doc tests as "optional: modular_resolution", which is highly awkward.

Would anything of the above be a show-stopper? Do you see further problems with that code layout?

Indeed, that does not work.

Just install them. Any package can install stuff in `SAGE_SHARE`.

> Should `modular_resolution-1.0` be install them?


If they are logically considered part of that package, then yes.

> - Making the cohomology code optional extensions would mean to mark hundreds of doc tests as "optional: modular_resolution", which is highly awkward.


Awkward but acceptable.

Thank you!

I don't see a very clear winner, but there is some tendency towards n=2 or n=3. I am now running some tests with groups of order 128. Since I am doing some changes in the package anyway, I can as well change the default behaviour of lifting, although it matters only slightly.

BTW, should I change the permission of install.sh?

It doesn't build for me otherwise, so either change it in the tar file or I suppose you could change `spkg-install`:

When I do `make dist` for the autotoolized `modular_resolution-1.0` sub-package, then I get a `.gz` and a `.bz2` tarball. For these, I get

```
$ tar -xpf modular_resolution-1.0.tar.gz

-rw-r--r-- 1 king king 13997 Jan  7  2016 modular_resolution-1.0/install-sh
$ rm -r modular_resolution-1.0
$ tar -xpf modular_resolution-1.0.tar.bz2 
$ ls -l modular_resolution-1.0/install-sh 
-rw-r--r-- 1 king king 13997 Jan  7  2016 modular_resolution-1.0/install-sh
```

`ltmain.sh` isn't executable either. And I think `tar -xpf` should preserve permissions (even `tar -xf` should, right?).

Moreover, when I do `make distdir` instead, then even in the uncompressed source tree the permissions are wrong. So, I suppose the error is in my autotools.

The permissions are wrong even in the sources.

So, I guess the maintenance problem can be solved by changing the permissions in the sources. For all *sh files, right?

Perhaps the program is trying to access the internet. I am now in my office, where I often have problems with internet connection. At home, internet works fine, perhaps that is why the tests did work there.

However, I thought that I had disallowed internet access during tests. In any case, if an internet connection cannot be established, the program should compute from scratch.

No, but it does cause doctest failures. So it must be a dependency.

Unless requested otherwise: The program first looks into the current private database (in DOT_SAGE). If the file doesn't exist then the program looks into the current public database (in SAGE_SHARE) and creates links from the private database to relevant files of the public database (and if the user does computations with the ring, then new files are added only to the private database, not to the public database, since the user may not have write permission there).

You mean it causes doctest failures in the cohomology package? Why should that possibly happen? I mean, there is plotting in the barcode.py module, but I don't think it uses matplotlib (unless matplotlib is the default in Sage when calling the `plot()` function).

Here is a problem. First I deleted (from my `.sage/pGroupCohomology/db` directory) the directories `8gp1`, `8gp2`, `8gp3`, `8gp4`. Then I started Sage and did this:

```
sage: from pGroupCohomology import CohomologyRing
sage: H = CohomologyRing(8,1)
sage: H = CohomologyRing(8,2)
sage: H = CohomologyRing(8,3)
sage: H = CohomologyRing(8,4)
```
This recreated those directories. I quit Sage and started again:

```
sage: from pGroupCohomology import CohomologyRing
sage: H = CohomologyRing(8,1)
BOOM
sage: H = CohomologyRing(8,2)
BOOM
sage: H = CohomologyRing(8,3)
sage: H = CohomologyRing(8,4)
```
The `BOOM` means that the first two commands produce errors, but the last two seem to work fine. The error looks like:

```

It's weird: I just quit and started again, and `CohomologyRing(8,1)` gave me this error the first time, but worked (in the same Sage session) after that, while `CohomologyRing(8,2)` gave an error every time I used it.

I tried twice, and I got the same error twice.

Here is how to work around the problem:
- Delete the folders
- Start Sage and create the rings
- COMPUTE the rings (with H.make())
- quit and restart sage
- create the rings again, and they are correctly loaded.

I also tried to just save the empty rings instead of computing the ring structure, but this didn't help.

So, I can reproduce it. I guess the reason is that the pickle of a freshly created (i.e., empty) ring structure constitutes a corner case in which certain autogenerated definitions in Singular become syntax errors. I'll investigate what is happening here. Certainly it SHOULD work!

I still don't understand what is your exact statement. So, let me ask again.

- Do you observe similar slowness when *you* run the test on *your* machine?
- Or do you just observe that internet is accessed, but without slowness?

By the way, I do have reason to believe that there is something weird going on in the combination of my laptop with my office: If my laptop is connected with the ethernet in my office and I try to shut the laptop down, then the shutdown of ubuntu sometimes takes ages. So, before shutting down my laptop I have to disconnect from ethernet, wait a few seconds till the network manager confirms that it is disconnected, and then I can start to shut down.

At the moment I am trying to run the tests at home.

Theoretically I could put more rings into the "public database" that is shipped with the spkg.

However, I have reason to believe that this will not solve the problem.

Namely, in my office, I have seen that even `H = CohomologyRing(8,3)` hangs. Now the point is that this particular ring is contained in the "public database" (this is something else than the tarball used to simulate web access in some tests). Hence, `H = CohomologyRing(8,3)` is supposed to NEVER access internet,vwith only one exception: If `CohomologyRing.set_public_db()` was used to redefine the location of the public database.

So, if this hangs then it isn't the internet. And if this hangs then putting more stuff into the public database will not solve it.

By the way: While I was writing these lines, the spkg installed and passed all its tests in a total of less than 20 minutes wall-time.

Let me review how the package behaves in different internet settings. It is all on the same ubuntu laptop.

- With no internet connection whatsoever:

  ```
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  All tests passed!
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Total time for all tests: 729.6 seconds
      cpu time: 1127.5 seconds
      cumulative wall time: 2119.5 seconds
  ```
- With W-Lan at my home:

  ```
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  All tests passed!
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Total time for all tests: 624.6 seconds
      cpu time: 850.7 seconds
      cumulative wall time: 1764.2 seconds
  ```
- With ethernet in my office (note that in that setting interactive use of the package does not show slowness!)

  ```
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  All tests passed!
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Total time for all tests: 12883.2 seconds
      cpu time: 641.8 seconds
      cumulative wall time: 22076.6 seconds
  ```

**__Conclusions__**

1. The tests pass under all circumstances. Therefore, it is not the case that the tests "depend on internet" or "are broken by internet".
2. The comparison "no internet" vs. "W-Lan" shows that the tests work faster if data can be found in internet. I don't see that as a problem. What matters is that the eventual outcome is the same.
3. Very likely the package is not to blame for the slowness of the tests with ethernet connection. Evidence: In that setting I have all sorts of trouble (slowness in shutting down my computer, and also thunderbird sometimes doesn't properly work in my office).
4. Therefore, I do not think that the internet issue needs to be addressed.

**__TODO__**

1. I need to check that pre-existing user data have no influence on the doctests. I.e., I will remove `~/.sage/pGroupCohomology` and `SAGE_SHARE/pGroupCohomology` before re-installing and re-testing the package. Both with and without internet connection.
2. The bug found by John ("creation of empty rings breaks pickling") needs to be fixed. But other than that, I still think the package is fine.

Yes:

It's *trying* to access the internet but failing since (as you correctly noted) internet is blocked during package installation.

I have to think about it. "Small" probably means "up to order 125". In orders 1 to 127, only the groups of order 64 take a serious amount of time to compute, but order 64 is provided by the public database, so they are available locally anyway.

> 3. Have some option (environment variable or whatever) to disable internet lookup and use that during testing.


Or:
4. Have a function that quickly determines whether `sage -t` is running. Use internet if that function returns "False", otherwise do not use internet.

Would it be difficult to check for `sage -t`?

<a id='comment:2'></a>
Can PLEASE some expert for trac finally make it so that the browser isn't insanely jumping its focus while typing a comment?!?

Lectures are starting tomorrow, hence I currently only have little time to work on the spkg.

But at least I'd like to recall some design choices and then outline the next steps I'm planning.

So far I distinguished `user_db`, `public_db` and `web_db`, where `db` in all cases means "database". However, I think I should distinguish the roles that all these databases are playing:
* A `user_db` is located in `DOT_SAGE` and is where new cohomology data are by default written to. It is formed by a bunch of folders, one folder for one ring. ALL computations are done there, even if the computation starts with data obtained from a `public_db`.
* A `public_db` is a source of cohomology data located in `SAGE_SHARE`; it is formed by folders located in a common root directory, one folder for one cohomology ring. Loading a ring from a `public_db` means to create links from `user_db` to `public_db`.
* A `web_db` is some url providing cohomology rings in the form of `.tar.gz` files, one file for one ring, that when unpacked results in a folder suitable for `user_db`.

Now I plan to do a little relabelling:
1. A more suitable label for `user_db` would be `workspace`. In most cases a single cohomology ring relies on computing various other cohomology rings. It makes sense to have a single workspace for *all* rings that the user is doing computations with. So, there should be a global option defining the location of the `workspace` (such a global option exists already).
2. In contrast, both `user_db` and `web_db` are local resp. web based data sources. It should be totally fine to have several data sources simultaneously. So, there should be global options `local_sources` and `web_sources` providing a tuple of paths resp. URLs (the current global options only allow a single location). Or, with the unifications outlined below, it would be enough to have a single global option `sources` providing both kinds of sources.
3. It should be possible to declare the optional data sources in the cohomology ring constructor, so that it will be used for the ring-to-be-constructed and the other rings that it depends on.

The relabelled global options would be used as follows:
4. The cohomology ring constructor first tries to find a ring in `workspace`. If it isn't there, it would try to load it (in order) from the available `local_sources`. If it isn't in any of them, it would try to download it (in order) from the available `web_sources`.
5. I mentioned a function `CohomologyRing.doctest_setup()`. That function would set `workspace=tmp_dir()` and `web_sources=()`, thus solving the "internet in doctests" issue.

All of the above could be done soonish (modulo the time that I need to prepare lectures). In particular, once the above is done, it would probably be in a sufficient shape for review.

After that (or when the review takes too long), I plan to rework the internal logic by which the file locations are managed. It currently works, but I find it messy.

And now I have a question for you: I have mentioned above that local databases provide one folder per ring, whereas web databases provide the `.tar.gz` versions of such folders. It would be tempting to unify the format, so that I can unify the process of (down)loading a cohomology ring. So, what shall I do?
- Change the web databases so that they provide folders? Downside would be that downloading a ring would need more bandwith.
- Change the local databases (not the workspace, though!) so that they provide `.tar.gz` balls? Downsides: Loading would take longer, and it wouldn't be possible to preserve storage space on disk by using links from workspace to local database.
- Keep the current formats, but still unify the routine that loads a cohomology ring? I.e., if there is a folder in the database, then use it, otherwise resort to the tar-ball.
- None of the above?

Hi Jeroen,

it very much depends on the group. The cohomology of group 299 of order 256 couldn't be computed in one month.

But 150 ms for a computation from scratch is probably impossible for any group.

One should also consider what cohomology rings can really be found in the web database, and currently the smallest groups are those of order 128 (except for the dihedral group of order 8, but that's in the local database, too). Also, it is only prime power order.

From that point of view, it really makes no sense to access the web for something that isn't prime power order and is less than order 128.

I am basically done with the changes and will soon post an update of the package. I have yet to run the tests with an ethernet connection in my office (recall that this used to be a problem), but will post the new package before that.

- I decided to keep a *single* local source (formerly known as "public db"), which on the one hand is due to details in old pickles and which on the other hand is reasonable: I think no sane user will create additional local databases (i.e., in addition to the one in SAGE_SHARE/pGroupCohomolog/).
- What was formerly known as "private db" became "workspace" --- I guess that's more descriptive.
- The remote sources are defined as a tuple of URLs. In particular, if that tuple is empty, there will be no web access.
- There is a new function `doctest_setup()` which clears the cache, puts the workspace into a temporary directory and defines "remote sources" as empty tuple.

The above is all about global options. I decided to keep the possibility to define a websource for a single cohomology ring, temporarily overriding the global setting.

- The file `8gp3.tar.gz`, that is used to provide a local version of a web repository, will not be installed. Instead, it is shipped in a folder `test_data` in the package. 

- I have fixed the bug on reading data for an "empty" cohomology ring (i.e., no generators, no relations). The problem was that I tried to create an empty ideal in Singular, which failed as there was no basering. I also added a test for that fix.

(MINOR) PROBLEM:

There is the following warning:

```
[p_group_cohomology-3.0] Warning: This package has a badly-behaved setup.py which outputs
[p_group_cohomology-3.0] more than the package name for 'setup.py --name'; using the last

I tried to google for that warning, but couldn't find what's wrong with my setup.py. Can you help me with it?

```
$ python setup.py --name
Compiling pGroupCohomology/resolution.pyx because it changed.
Compiling pGroupCohomology/cochain.pyx because it changed.
Compiling pGroupCohomology/cohomology.pyx because it changed.
Compiling pGroupCohomology/modular_cohomology.pyx because it changed.
Compiling pGroupCohomology/dickson.pyx because it changed.
[1/5] Cythonizing pGroupCohomology/cochain.pyx
[2/5] Cythonizing pGroupCohomology/cohomology.pyx
[3/5] Cythonizing pGroupCohomology/dickson.pyx
[4/5] Cythonizing pGroupCohomology/modular_cohomology.pyx
[5/5] Cythonizing pGroupCohomology/resolution.pyx
pGroupCohomology
```

So, the problem is that the innocent `python setup.py --name` isn't just returning the name but results in a compilation. Why is that?

I have updated the documentation at http://users.minet.uni-jena.de/cohomology/documentation/ and the source tarball at http://users.minet.uni-jena.de/cohomology/p_group_cohomology-3.0.tar.xz

I have yet to test for the "web access problem", that I only encountered in my office. But I am confident that the remote sources are set to the empty tuple in all tests that might possibly access the internet.

So, for now it is "needs review"!

Personally, I would just ignore that warning for now. There is no official proper way to package Cython projects.

I have a suggestion for the problem *here* (but it wouldn't solve the general problem): p_group_cohomology's `spkg-install` should check whether `sage.libs.meataxe` can be imported. If it can't then either the installation should be aborted with a message advising the user to do `sage -b`, or `spkg-install` should run `sage -b` automatically.

Do I understand correctly that you only needed to do `sage -b` and did not need to re-install the package in order to make it work?

In that case, I think a warning should be given at the end of spkg-install and an error schould be raised at the beginning of spkg-check, if sage.libs.meataxe cannot be imported.

But if a re-installation of the package is needed after `sage -b`, then I'd prefer an error being raised at the beginning of spkg-install.

`p_group_cohomology`

> You need to build the Sage library, that's all.


So, you install meataxe, forget to do sage -b, install p_group_cohomology, then finally do sage -b, and all is good?

You said that helpful messages are often not read. In that case, I'd suggest that at the end of `p_group_cohomology`'s spkg-install it is checked whether sage.libs.meataxe can be imported, and if it can't then sage -b is done automatically.

Actually I thought `sage -b` is the recommended thing to do. Is it really better to do `make sagelib`? I was totally unaware of it. Anyway I changed it.

This will work because the re-installation of `p_group_cohomology` will trigger a rebuild of the Sage library because of the `$(SAGERUNTIME)` dependency.

The difference is that `meataxe` is installed *before* starting the build of `p_group_cohomology`.

Maybe I should explain the problem again in full detail: there are 3 relevant packages: meataxe (M), sagelib (S) and p_group_cohomology (P). The fact that S is a special package doesn't really matter much: the build system mostly treats S like any other package. One exception is that it is never considered up-to-date: it will always rebuild S if it occurs as a dependency.

Whenever S is built, it will compile the optional module `sage.libs.meataxe` **provided that** M was built before building S. So we need some build of S after the build of M.

There is a dependency of P on both M and S. The problem is that M and S are built in an unspecified order. So the build order could be M, S, P (good) or S, M, P (bad).

If we are in the bad case S, M, P and we build P again, then the full build order will be S, M, P, S, P which works because it contains the good subsequence M, S, P.

You could at least have read [comment:362] which added the dependency and ticket #25106 which explains the problem.

In [comment:362] you did in fact NOT explain the problem. You just showed that something went wrong, but didn't give a hint how to reproduce it.

And since you didn't tell, I can only guess: You tried to install the p_group_cohomology package before you completed building Sage. But that's not what one is supposed to do in the case of an optional package: First, one has to have a FULLY FUNCTIONAL Sage installation (i.e., with all standard packages built and installed) and only then should one start with installation of optional packages.

And if Sage is fully functional, matplotlib is available (it is standard package) and the doctesting framework is available too.

Thank you. The missing bit of information for me was indeed that optional packages are supposed to be buildable before Sage is fully functional (as long as the package's explicitly listed dependencies are available, of course).

Anyway, since #25106 has positive review, I suppose we can consider that issue as being fixed, right?

You really should think of "standard" packages and "optional" as being exactly the same, *except* that optional packages are not installed by default. In particular, they follow the same rules about dependencies.

This rule makes sense because it makes it easy to change optional packages to standard (in theory at least).

Why would it be needed to rewrite the git history? I thought "dependency of a ticket" means that there is no need to post an explicit merge commit, as long as the branches from the two tickets merge cleanly.

Is that currently not the case? Here, when we omit the already-merged tickets #24998 and #25106,
we have dependency #25511, which currently depends on #25079, which depends on #25476.

So, it should be fine to state on #25511 that the ONLY dependency is #25079 and to state here that the ONLY dependency is #25511. But I don't see what that has to do with changing git history.

Then I'd say: Go ahead. I.e., rebase this ticket on top of #25511, making it the only dependency of this ticket. But then please also tell me how to smoothly pull from the git branch of this ticket after a forced push: Is there a "forced pull" command?

I typically do as follows:

```
$ git fetch
$ git trac checkout 18514
$ git reset --hard COMMIT_HASH_ON_TICKET
```
where COMMIT_HASH_ON_TICKET is the value of the "Commit" field on Trac.

I now try to rework the package on top of #25511. One question arose: Why does the following import statement in resolution.pyx does not work:

```
from sage.cpython.string cimport str_to_bytes
from sage.cpython.string import FS_ENCODING
```
?

It is the same import statement as in sage.matrix.matrix_gfpn_dense - so, it SHOULD work, shouldn't it?

**EDIT:** This is the error I get when compiling it:

I also get this very strange attribute error (unfortunately without a good traceback):

But '_strip_prompt' appears nowhere in the cohomology package! So, what the heck is going on here?

Thank you! For now, I am able to work around that problem, because at the moment it still works to pass a str to MatLoad, but I guess if #25549 gets fixed soon I should use it.

Well, my understanding is that in Python 3, `bytes` takes the role of what in Python 2 is `str`. And a string in Python 3 always comes with an encoding.

In fact, my questions ARE very general and unprecise, as I heard that there ARE differences between Python 2 and 3 regarding strings, but I do not have the faintest idea how they differ and what it means for coding.

- How to test whether a function argument is a string? I recall that `isinstance(FOO,basestring)` is depreciated.
- Is there a change when talking with a C library function? I.e., currently a Python str is converted into a `char*`; is there any pitfall in Python 3 (such as "one is supposed to use a proper string with encoding in Python code, but when talking with C one needs to convert to `bytes`"?
- Example: What does

  ```python
        if type(filename) is not bytes:
            filename = str_to_bytes(filename, FS_ENCODING,
                                    'surrogateescape')
  ```
  do that `if not isinstance(filename, basestring): <do some conversion>` doesn't

First of all, the answers are different between Python and Cython. Since you're mostly dealing with Cython code, I'll give the Cython answer.

There are 2 classes which are unambiguous: `bytes` and `unicode`. Here, `bytes` is a sequence of bytes (corresponding to `char *` in C) and `unicode` is a sequence of unicode characters. You can also think of `unicode` as an abstract string, while `bytes` is an encoded string (say, with UTF-8 encoding).

There is also the `str` class, which is an alias for `bytes` on Python 2 but an alias of `unicode` on Python 3. But it's best to think of `bytes`, `str` and `unicode` as three distinct classes (that's more or less what Cython does internally)

`isinstance(foo, basestring)` matches `str` and `unicode` (so it matches `bytes` on Python 2 but not on Python 3).

For literals, the following rules apply:
- `b"foo"` -> `bytes`
- `"foo"` -> `str`
- `u"foo"` -> `unicode`

Replying to [SimonKing](#comment%3A512):

Depends what you mean with "a string".

> - Is there a change when talking with a C library function?


Absolutely, I would say that this is the main reason of existence of `sage.cpython.string`. C functions take a `char *` which maps to `bytes`. But the Python wrappers typically take a `str` as argument. So there needs to be a conversion between `str` and `bytes` (which is a no-op in Python 2).

Let me just explain what this does and why it's the right thing to do. For filenames, many Python functions accept both `bytes` and `str`. So it's natural to allow this too in Sage.

If `filename` has type `bytes`, then nothing needs to be done because C functions can accept that (Cython does the conversion `bytes` -> `char *` for you).
If not, `str_to_bytes` is called which converts either `str` or `unicode` to `bytes` (it raises an error for other input). So that piece of code accepts `bytes`, `str` and `unicode` on all Python versions. The result is that `filename` is of type `bytes`.

The arguments `FS_ENCODING, 'surrogateescape'` are what Python uses by default for converting filenames.

The only thing that slightly puzzles me is why the check is `type(filename) is not bytes` instead of `not isinstance(filename, bytes)` (i.e. allowing subclasses of `bytes`). Maybe custom subclasses of `bytes` cannot easily be converted to `char *`?

I have reworked upstream so that the recent additions from #25511 are used. The advantage is that this ticket's branch only adds changes to build/pkgs, but not to the Sage library; these changes are in the only new commit of the branch that I just force-pushed.

Of course, I have updated the .tar.xz-file at the location given in the ticket description.

Result:

```

So, ready for review!

Strangely, only the branch field of this ticket was automatically updated, but not the "commit" field. So, I changed it manually.

Thanks for spotting it. I have informed our administrator.

Temporarily, I have posted it at my homepage (https://users.fmi.uni-jena.de/~king/p_group_cohomology-3.0.tar.xz), but that will not be permanent, as I have a data limit there.

And can PLEASE finally someone fix trac, so that the browser isn't insanely jumping to odd places (for example it was just centering at [comment:223](#comment%3A223) while I tried to write the new comment)

I tried this on `8.3.beta7` and it was not able to pass its test suite. It seems to be coming from this:

```

Yet again.

Frankly, it happens way too often that the group cohomology package gets broken because of changes in sagelib. So, I believe that the package should eventually be moved to the sage library, too, in order to make it easier to prevent this reoccurring mishap.

Even better, use the function `new_mtx` from `src/sage/matrix/matrix_gfpn_dense.pyx` which more or less does the same thing.

It would already be possible to implement it with optional extension modules. But it has been argued at some point that optional extension modules should only be used for standard functionality of Sage that can also be provided by a non-standard backend.

So, when I talk about "putting it into the Sage library", I mean "putting it into the Sage library as plain extension modules that depend only on standard packages". Then:

1. It would be needed to make SharedMeatAxe a standard package. Given that its matrix arithmetic is vastly superior to what vanilla Sage has to offer for matrices over small non-prime fields, this should happen anyway.
2. It would be needed to make the C-library part of the group cohomology package (aka modular_resolution-1.0) a standard package.
3. It would be needed to make SmallGroups (via database_gap) standard. This used to be impossible because of licencing, but that's fixed now.

If you are able to do that and MeatAxe also becomes standard, then the doc issues will be fixed because it will be a usual `pyx` file.

Good news: I managed to replace !makeMTX by !new_mtx.

Bad news:
1. Strange enough, the "commit" field of the ticket has not been correctly set, I needed to edit it manually.
2. THE PACKAGE DOES NOT EVEN START TO BUILD. ARRGHH!!!

I have posted the tar ball in its original location (see ticket description). The attempt to install the package ends in an infinite loop:

```
...
[p_group_cohomology-3.0] Installing p_group_cohomology-3.0
[p_group_cohomology-3.0] Warning: This package has a badly-behaved setup.py which outputs

...
```
Of course it is not installed! That's why I want to install it, stupid!

Can you explain what is going wrong here?

I noticed that the `python setup.py --name` results in a compilation of the cython files, which certainly shouldn't happen. How to prevent it?

But if I understand correctly, the installation went past that point and did correctly obtain the package name. So, why does it REPEATEDLY complain that the package to be installed is not installed.

Ouch.

So, at least two questions arise:
- Why is it possible to install the package from its sources by doing `python setup.py build` followed by `pip install . --upgrade`? Note that plainly doing `pip install .` did not suffice.
- How to downgrade pip? Note that system-wide I have pip 8. So, if you tell me how to remove pip from the sage installation, I would do so.

  If I understand correctly, it means that there is a changed import location, i.e., yet another internal change in Sage that creates trouble.

When I developed the first package version in 2009, Sage was an ideal platform. Frankly, if I would create a similar package today, I wouldn't know what platform to choose.

No, I was mistaken: When providing a template for `new_mtx`, I accidentally chose a matrix that with the option "nouseMTX" is not a meataxe matrix.

Apparently the import location HAS changed. However, I am importing "circle" for absolutely no reason. I only use "line", which still can be imported from sage.plot.plot. However, the official import statement is `from sage.plot.line import line`, and I'll use this.

The documentation is hosted [at my home institute](https://users.fmi.uni-jena.de/cohomology/documentation/).

I guess that's the same for most optional Sage packages. Or maybe there is one crucial difference: Most optional packages are independent projects that can be installed and used in the Sage ecosystem; so, people become aware without Sage. But p_group_cohomology is a package that *uses* Sage and is thus not independent.

However, is a problem here to solve? I know that some experts for modular cohomology of finite groups know p_group_cohomology, but I doubt that people outside that niche will use that package.

This would only be executed on a machine that has the package installed in the first place, right?

Is it not part of `$SAGE_RUNTIME`? In any case, I added it as a dependency.

Also, I added `src/sage/tests/modular_group_cohomology.py`. The tests there take 9 seconds (I hope that's OK), and they cover a wide range of functionality of the package. Hence, if some change in the sage library breaks `p_group_cohomology` and a user who has installed the package runs `make test`, then the problem is very likely to become visible immediately.

I guess it is back to "needs review", right?

Sorry, I didn't notice that you used `sage -t --warn-long`. 

On my machine, I get warnings for four tests:

```
    H.essential_ideal()
    ascii_art(H.bar_code('LowerCentralSeries')[2])
    H = CohomologyRing(gap(AlternatingGroup(7)), GroupName="A(7)", prime=2, from_scratch=True)
    H = CohomologyRing(gap(AlternatingGroup(6)), GroupName="A(6)", prime=3, from_scratch=True)
```
I'll try to come up with shorter tests.

2/3 were less than 1.5 seconds, and my machine is not particularly fast. I am happier to have the shorter tests. Yet, I think this is something that will be tested only by the bots (if they even have this optional package installed) and is meant to catch interface breakage, I did not see as much harm in having longer regular tests.

On the other hand, those bots typically run tests with `--long`, so it wouldn't hurt to add `# long time` in that case.

I just added a few trivial changes to wrap some long lines, so I guess this is finally good to go...
