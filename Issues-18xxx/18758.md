```
Currently, `ModuleElement.__mul__` raises an error when both elements have the same parent. Hence, in order to define a ring structure, one must not start with `ModuleElement`, which is bad, since sometimes the concrete structure only depends on the category (see CombinatorialFreeModule).

The approach to be implemented here: `ModuleElement.__mul__` and `RingElement.__mul__` should provide short-cuts in cases where there is an obvious way to be faster than calling the coercion model, and otherwise it is the job of the coercion model (NOT of `ModuleElement.__mul__`) to complain if the two elements come from the same parent without an action being defined.

Hence, it should be possible to start with `ModuleElement` and get a ring structure on top of it by an appropriate action of the parent on itself. Here is an example that should be made work:

```
sage: from sage.categories.action import Action
sage: class RingStructure(Action):
....:     def __init__(self, R):
....:         Action.__init__(self, R, R, True, operator.mul)
....:     def _call_(self, g, a):
....:         return g._mul_(a)
....:     
sage: from sage.structure.element import ModuleElement
sage: class MyElement(ModuleElement):
....:     def __init__(self, P, L):
....:         ModuleElement.__init__(self, P)
....:         self.l = L
....:     def _repr_(self):
....:         return "<{}>".format(self.l)
....:     def _add_(self, other):
....:         return self.parent()(zip(self.l, other.l))
....:     def _mul_(self, other):
....:         return self.parent()(self.l+other.l)
....:     
sage: class MyParent(Parent):
....:     Element = MyElement
....:     def _get_action_(self, S, op, self_on_left):
....:         if S is self and op == operator.mul and self_on_left:
....:             return RingStructure(self)
....:         
sage: P = MyParent(category=Rings())
sage: l1 = P([1,2])
sage: l2 = P([3,4])
sage: l1+l2
<[(1, 3), (2, 4)]>
sage: l1*l2
<[1, 2, 3, 4]>
```

Moreover, it should be possible to define the actions using ParentMethods in the category framework. I.e., `_get_action_` should be moved from Parent to Sets.ParentMethods. This is why #18756 (where the whole idea started) is a dependency.

More precisely: The above `RingStructure` (perhaps with some sanity test similar to `sage.structure.coerce_action.ModuleAction`) should be defined in sage.structure.coerce_actions and used by `Rings.ParentMethods._get_action_`.

__Summary__

- multiplication can still be defined by category initialisation in `Magmas()`. However, it should become faster and it should in future be easier to import the multiplication from a fast cython module.
- The way to define an internal multiplication should be more uniform throughout Sage: One simply defines `_mul_` and initialises in `Magmas()`. Overriding `__mul__` (which in some situations was still needed) should in future be even more useless.
- Similar statements hold for `_add_`.

Remark: `Magmas.ElementMethods` does provide a generic multiplication using `_mul_` (when present) and using coercion otherwise.

Two problems: There is an import statement in the multiplication method, which, if I recall correctly, is not for free. And it first checks the presence of a `_mul_` attribute, which also slows things down.

So, it would be interesting to see if the following approach yields faster code:
- ALL element classes should have generic `__mul__` and `__add__` methods. Those of `sage.structure.elements.Element` will just rely on coercion, whereas `ModuleElement` and `RingElement` first try a short-cut via `_mul_` resp. `_add_`. So, the hierarchy of algebraic base classes would be reflected in the usage of shortcuts.
- The proposed actions `MagmaStructure` and `AdditiveMagmaStructure` should test the presence of the attributes `_mul_` resp. `_add_` during initialisation, ONCE. Henceforth, the presence of the attribute does not need to be tested any longer.

So, rather than providing a `__mul__` methods, `Magmas()` would provide an action, and there should be a `__mul__` method for Element instead. Really, we need to test and get timings.

```

Explanation:
1. In P, we use Element as starting point. It has no `__mul__`, hence, `__mul__` is obtained from some element method of the category of rings.
2. In PM, we use ModuleElement as starting point.
    - It has a `__mul__` method that in vanilla Sage would refuse to carry a ring structure. Hence, the above wouldn't work in vanilla Sage. I have changed the coercion framework so that it does not complain about a ring structure.
    - Since it has a `__mul__` method, it cannot inherit a ring multiplication from the category element methods. Instead, the parent inherits `_get_action_` from category parent methods, as per #18756.
3. This would be the "classical" way to define a ring structure.

As you can see, of course a specialised cythoned `__mul__` method for rings is fastest. The first approach is taken in `CombinatorialFreeModule`, if I understand correctly, and is slowest (not by much, but it is). The new approach to use an action of self on itself somehow is in the middle, speed-wise.

Before I push my branch, I'll see what happens if I provide `Element` with a default `__mul__` method that simply calls the coercion model. It will of course make the first approach impossible, but I guess it would speed-up the second (i.e., new) approach.

This is what happens:

```
sage: %timeit l*l

100000 loops, best of 3: 7.71 µs per loop

The slowest run took 4.27 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
100000 loops, best of 3: 7.03 µs per loop
```

In other words, using `Element` becomes faster when defining a ring structure than `ModuleElement`. Probable reason: The default `Element.__mul__` that I am suggesting will immediately use coercion, whereas `ModuleElement.__mul__` first tries some shortcut that is not available in my example.

Of course, `RingElement.__mul__` is still fastest, as it uses the right shortcut.

Can you suggest a place to put documentation on coercion so that it is actually found by sage.combinat users?

The appropriate category could be `Monoids()` in the case of finite or infinite words, but could be `Sets()` in the case of "words avoiding 12" and those things (i.e., the product of two pattern avoiding words is not necessarily pattern avoiding).

   Then, one could finally take advantage of Sage's coercion framework for words.

I suggest to sanitise Permutation here, but keep Word for a later ticket.

I have changed the logic in the `bin_op()` method of the coercion model, so that it is safer against infinite recursion. The error messages in most cases do not just say that the operation "+" is unsupported, but say that a common parent has not been found. Changing the expected error messages is the hardest part of the latest commit.

Most important change: The coercion model now makes actual use of single underscore methods!

You may be surprised by the implied statement that previously the coercion model did *not* use them. In fact, it didn't. Up to now, the single underscore methods have only been used as short-cuts in `RingElement.__mul__` and friends. I have changed it, so that the short-cut still works, but additionally the coercion model explicitly calls the single underscore methods (when available) if both operands belong to the same parent.

Here are different settings, where in each case I also compare with vanilla sage-6.8.beta5.
1. Action obtained from the category:

```
sage: P = MyParent(category=Rings())
sage: l = P([1,2])
sage: %timeit l*l
The slowest run took 64.43 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
100000 loops, best of 3: 7.82 µs per loop  # 8.87 µs in beta5
sage: %timeit l+l
The slowest run took 24.53 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
100000 loops, best of 3: 8.44 µs per loop # 9.49 µs in beta5
```

2. The coercion model using single underscore methods. Both examples won't work in beta5

```
sage: P = MyParent(category=Sets())
sage: l = P([1,2])
sage: %timeit l*l
The slowest run took 15.44 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
100000 loops, best of 3: 10.3 µs per loop
sage: %timeit l+l
The slowest run took 11.54 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
100000 loops, best of 3: 10.7 µs per loop
```

3. ModuleElement using a short-cut for "+" and not complaining about a multiplication action obtained from the category:

```
sage: P = MyMParent(category=Rings())
sage: l = P([1,2])
sage: %timeit l*l
The slowest run took 108.72 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
100000 loops, best of 3: 7.88 µs per loop  # won't work in beta5
sage: %timeit l+l
The slowest run took 5.98 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
100000 loops, best of 3: 8.05 µs per loop  # 8.01 µs in beta5 (of course no significant change)
```

4. ModuleElement using a shortcut for "+" and allowing the coercion model to use single underscore methods for "*":

```
sage: P = MyMParent(category=Sets())
sage: l = P([1,2])
sage: %timeit l*l
The slowest run took 14.45 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
100000 loops, best of 3: 10.7 µs per loop  # won't work in beta5
sage: %timeit l+l
The slowest run took 4.25 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
100000 loops, best of 3: 8.69 µs per loop  # 8.02 µs in beta5. Should actually be the same time! This branch hasn't changed!
```

5. RingElement using short-cuts for "+" and for "*". Of course there are no significant changes wrt. beta5, as the short-cut didn't change.

```
sage: P = MyRParent(category=Sets())
sage: l = P([1,2])
sage: %timeit l*l
The slowest run took 4.75 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
100000 loops, best of 3: 7.12 µs per loop  # 7.02 µs with beta5
sage: %timeit l+l
The slowest run took 4.58 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
100000 loops, best of 3: 8.07 µs per loop  # 7.98 µs with beta5
