One of the TODOs that remains in the documentation for ncsf_qsym is to implement a short list of bases from the literature.  One of those bases is the dual basis to the quasi-Schur basis of QSym.  We should be able to use the transition coefficients that are implemented in qsym.py to compute the dual quasi-Schur basis.  This may mean factoring out the methods from qsym.py to combinatorics.py or perhaps just accessing those methods where they are.

The quasi-Schur basis will be realized through the monomial basis (instead of the fundamental basis) because there are more efficient ways to compute the change of basis coefficients than were in the original implementation.

I think that the original implementation in #13505 was made with the intention that one day it would be improved.

Here is a down and dirty implementation of the dual basis.

<a id='comment:6'></a>This last commit makes the basis change from the complete basis rather than the ribbon basis using the new `number_of_SSRCT` method.  My speed test for this change was `timeit('dQS[1,2,1]*dQS[2,2]',number=1,repeat=1)`
On commit 8cbcc9b it takes about 45 seconds and on commit f72162f it takes a little more than 1 second.

I think that what this means is that the Quasisymmetric_Schur basis should use a similar expansion using the monomial basis rather than the fundamental basis.

This is significantly faster than creating the `_from_fundmental_transition_matrix` using `CompositionTableaux`.

Comparing to branch ​b8cefb8 (with a `@`cached_method in from of `_to_monomial_on_basis`)

```
sage: timeit('QS[1,2,1]*QS[2,2]',number=1,repeat=1)
1 loops, best of 1: 46.3 s per loop
sage: timeit('QS[1,2,1]*QS[2,3]',number=1,repeat=1)
1 loops, best of 1: 421 s per loop
```

Same calculation on current branch

```
sage: timeit('QS[1,2,1]*QS[2,2]',number=1,repeat=1)
1 loops, best of 1: 18.7 s per loop
sage: timeit('QS[1,2,1]*QS[2,3]',number=1,repeat=1)
1 loops, best of 1: 90.7 s per loop
```

I've optimized here the single calculation, but subsequent calculations are all cached and will be faster (and faster than my `_to/from_*_by_triangularity` methods).

I made a couple of changes which should result in a speedup to the multiplication. I cached the output of `composition_order` in the matrix function so that it doesn't get recomputed every time a multiplication is done.

<a id='comment:24'></a>The old path of QS to and from the fundamental basis is significantly slower than the current branch which passes through the monomial basis and then to the fundamental basis.

Current branch:

F(QS[4,2,1]) - once : 72.2 ms / many : 16.9 ms

On master:

```

If you could add a `# long time` to line 4770 (the test `s(dQS([2,1,3,1]).to_symmetric_function())`), and once you've done and are okay with my changes, then you can set this to a positive review.

It seems that going from the Complete basis is faster to be a module morphism rather than an algebra morphism (which for this, makes sense because we are just sorting the composition and we don't need to multiply non-monomial elements). More specifically, you can look at the number of calls to `Partition.__init__`, and it's all of these additional small function calls that adds up.
