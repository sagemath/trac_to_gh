As reported on [this ask question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/26713/lu-descomposition-for-a-matrix/), there is an inconsistency in the definition of the LU decomposition of a matrix depending on its base ring. If a matrix `A` belongs to `ZZ`, `QQ`, `AA`, `QQbar`, `A.LU()` returns a triple `(P,L,U)` such that `A=PLU`. If a matrix `A` belongs to `RDF`, `A.LU()` returns a triple `(P,L,U)` such that `PA=LU`. For example:

```
sage: A = random_matrix(ZZ,4)
sage: A.LU()
(
[0 1 0 0]  [    1     0     0     0]  [   72    -4   -38     0]

[0 0 0 1], [-1/36   1/9    -1     1], [    0     0     0   -17]
)

sage: B.LU()

)


sage: B.LU()[0] == A.LU()[0]
False
sage: B.LU()[0] == A.LU()[0].transpose()
True
sage: 
```

The aim of this ticket is to fix this inconsistency and choose a common definition for all rings.

It is worth noticing that the source code for matrices over `RDF` calls `scipy.linalg.lu` which returns a triple `(P,L,U)` such that `A=PLU` and then transpose `P` with the documentation:

```
# Numpy has a different convention than we had with GSL
# So we invert (transpose) the P to match our prior behavior
# TODO: It's an awful waste to store a huge matrix for P, which
# is just a simple permutation, really.
```

So, i guess this extra transposition should be reverted, so that it becomes consistent with both `scipy` and the implementation for exact rings.

The proposed change does not change the syntax of using the `.LU()` method, but changes the semantic of the output. How would it be possible to deprecate it?

Do you say that if the `.LU()` method is used for a matrix over RDF then a deprecation warning should be used? That warning would appear also in the case that the user expects the new (not the old) behaviour, i.e., when a warning is inappropriate.

Good point.   Perhaps we need to just put a visible note in the documentation that might help clarify if someone is perplexed by the output changing - I guess that was my point, that it is a "silent" change.  But they should agree over all rings, yes.

I think along with a note in the documentation `LU()` should also give a warning on using for this behavior change, what do you think?

A warning (in the sense of: \"If M.LU() is called then a warning is printed\") is disturbing, because the mere fact of calling `.LU()` is *not* a problem. What is a potential problem is whether or not the user expects the output in a particular form. And we cannot guess on the expectation of the user. Hence, certainly it should be written in the documentation that there has been a change, give an example for which that change happens, and insert a link to this ticket. The syntax for such link in the docstrings is\n\n```\nSee :trac:`18365`.\n```\nBut there should be no warning inserted into the code.",

Replying to [@ChamanAgrawal](#comment%3A8):
> I think along with a note in the documentation `LU()` should also give a warning on using for this behavior change, what do you think?

I don't think so. A warning (in the sense of: "If M.LU() is called then a warning is printed") is disturbing, because the mere fact of calling `.LU()` is *not* a problem. What is a potential problem is whether or not the user expects the output in a particular form. And we cannot guess on the expectation of the user. Hence, certainly it should be written in the documentation that there has been a change, give an example for which that change happens, and insert a link to this ticket. The syntax for such link in the docstrings is

```
See :trac:`18365`.
```
But there should be no warning inserted into the code.

I have added a note for the change as below, any suggestion for change? 

```
.. NOTE::
            The behaviour of ``LU()`` has been changed. Earlier ``LU()`` 
            returned ``P,L,U`` such that ``P*A=L*U``, where ``P`` represents
            the permutation and is the matrix inverse of the ``P`` returned
            by this method. The computation of this matrix inverse can be accomplished
            quickly with just a transpose as the matrix is orthogonal/unitary.
                
            For Details See :trac:`18365`.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: m = matrix(RDF,4,range(16))
            sage: P,L,U = m.LU()
            sage: P*L*U # rel tol 2e-16
            [ 0.0  1.0  2.0  3.0]
            [ 4.0  5.0  6.0  7.0]
            [ 8.0  9.0 10.0 11.0]
            [12.0 13.0 14.0 15.0]
            
        Below example illustrate the change in behaviour of ``LU()``. ::

            sage: m == P*L*U
            True
            sage: P*m == L*U
            False
```
