There is really no reason to make a difference between `base` and `standard` packages, except for the only truly "base" package `configure`. And `gcc` isn't needed for Sage, so it should be optional.

Also make various changes to #18431:
1. Remove initial spaces from dependencies.
2. Build `prereq` before other packages, remove explicit dependencies on `prereq`.
3. Fix this bug: `cat >&5 "# Standard packages"`
4. Compute make variable name and version in `filtered_packages_list` function.
5. List all packages (not only standard) in `build/Makefile`.
6. Beautify the listing of all standard package, use a make variable instead of a new target.
7. Remove superfluous rule for `$(INST)/$(SAGE_MP_LIBRARY)`

Hello Jeroen! I obviously have nothing against what you plan on doing, and I will probably give you a confirmation that what you want to do makes sense:

the reason why I created this 'base' category is that indeed not all packages were listed in the "Standard packages" list in the (former) build/install script. Some, like configure, bzip2 and others, were handled differently. In particular, all standard packages appear in the 'all-sage' Makefile rule, while the *base* ones do not.

That's the only reason. I know that I do not know enough about how this all works to change the Makefile's behaviour, so I kept trying to write scripts that generate a Makefile equivalent to the former version. Thus 'basic' packages, which you can of course remove as you know what you are doing far better than me.
