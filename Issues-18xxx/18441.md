There is really no reason to make a difference between `base` and `standard` packages, except for the only truly "base" package `configure`. And `gcc` isn't needed for Sage, so it should be optional.

Also make various changes to #18431:
1. Remove initial spaces from dependencies.
2. Build `prereq` before other packages, remove explicit dependencies on `prereq`.
3. Fix this bug: `cat >&5 "# Standard packages"`
4. Compute make variable name and version in `filtered_packages_list` function.
5. List all packages (not only standard) in `build/Makefile`.
6. Beautify the listing of all standard package, use a make variable instead of a new target.
7. Remove superfluous rule for `$(INST)/$(SAGE_MP_LIBRARY)`
