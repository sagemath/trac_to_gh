With this branch, it is not necssary anymore to copy/paste a package's name in four different places in order to make it standard.

This is done by adding two files in each folder:
- 'type': can contain either 'base', 'standard', 'optional', or 'experimental'
- 'dependencies': lists the dependencies of a package in "Make" notation.

I regret not having been able to make the 'dependencies' files clearer (they are a copy of the target dependencies form the Makefiles). Making it more human-readable is complicated, as we have to handle the "|" Make character (for order-only-prerequisite). Also, some standard packages depend on targets with are not packages themselves (i.e. prereq).

The commit are split in order to ease the review.
