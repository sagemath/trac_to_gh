This branch deprecates the `NetworkX` backend for graphs. Indeed, while it made
sense to keep a `NetworkXGraphBackend` when Sage's default data structure
switched from `networkx` to `c_graphs`, we do not *need* it anymore.

This does not mean that Sage should not have a `NetworkX` data structure (though
there is little use). On the other hand, `NetworkX` is the only reason why we
have a `Backend` layer in Sage's graph data structures, as all others are
`CGraph` backends.

Thus, in order to simplify the hierarchy of classes for graph data structures,
it is easier to uniformize our data structures first. When this series of
patches will be finished and when the graph backends will be in a clearer and
simpler state, it will be possible to implement a new `NetworkX` backend.

It makes little sense, however, to rewrite the current networkx backend as a
`c_graph` backend when it will have to be rewritten again later during the
refactoring.

Technical info:

- The main problem in this branch was the handling of (old) graph pickles. As
  the classes themselves are being deprecated, the `__setstate__` functions
  detect whenever an attribute uses a deprecated class, and in this case convert
  it into a non-deprecated data structure (sparse graph, by default).

- Two `random_stress` functions are removed, as they work by comparing the
  behaviour of `c_graph` and `networkx` backend. This is not as terrible as it
  sounds, for graphs are tested extensively in many places of Sage (I am often
  surprised to find out where they are used when code breaks)

This ticket removes a feature you probably did not know even existed:

```
sage: Graph([(1,2),(3,4)])._backend
<type 'sage.graphs.base.sparse_graph.SparseGraphBackend'>
sage: Graph([(1,2),(3,4)],implementation="networkx")._backend
<class 'sage.graphs.base.graph_backends.NetworkXGraphBackend'>
```

The 'networkx' backend only means that inside of the graph class, at a level you are not supposed to reach except when you write low-level graph functions, the graph is stored as a netowrkx object.

That changes nothing to the fact that networkx is still available in Sage. You can import it, call it, and still get a networkx copy of your graphs with `Graph.networkx_graph()`. And Sage itself still uses networkx in many places: the stupidest example of that is `graphs.CompleteGraph`. Believe it or not, in order to build a complete graph Sage calls networkx' function `networkx.complete_graph(n)`.

It gets tested automatically. It is done in `sage.structure.sage_object`. You can also do it manually with:

```
sage: sage.structure.sage_object.unpickle_all()

So the patch is working well.

However, in the doc, on page /reference/graphs/sage/graphs/base/overview.html  the section `The backends` could be updated, at least to mention that the networkx backend is deprecated.

Okay, I am fine with that - actually I *did* know that feature existed.
> Believe it or not, in order to build a complete graph Sage calls networkx' function `networkx.complete_graph(n)`.

Yes, in fact I think there are other places where that occurs :)  Thanks for the clarification!
