The `cdef class CategoryObject` has this strange method:

```
    def gens_dict(self):
         r"""
         Return a dictionary whose entries are ``{var_name:variable,...}``.
         """
         if HAS_DICTIONARY(self):
            try:
                if self._gens_dict is not None:
                    return self._gens_dict
            except AttributeError:
                pass
         v = {}
         for x in self.gens():
             v[str(x)] = x
         if HAS_DICTIONARY(self):
            self._gens_dict = v
         return v
```
which provides caching only for Python subclasses. It turns out that caching this doesn't really matter since `gens_dict()` is not used in critical code, so we can just remove the funny "caching".

The class `ParentWithGens` is deprecated! There is no need for an attribute `_gens_dict` on all category objects. Why `Partitions` or `Integers` should have a method `gens` or `_gens_dict` attribute? I am very against this change.

Then why is there a `gens_dict()` method on all category objects?

It makes absolutely no sense to have a method on class `A` whose results are cached in a subclass `B`.

If you prefer, I can move the whole `gens_dict()` method, but that's a more drastic change.

This is indeed the problem!

Yes please. I found that doing what you proposed is just worse in the direction of cleaning `Element/CategoryObject/Parent`.

On the other hand, does it really hurt to have this extra attribute? We already have these attributes on `CategoryObject`:

```
cdef class CategoryObject(SageObject):
    cdef _generators
    cdef _category
    cdef public _base
    cdef public _cdata
    cdef public _names # will be _printer
    cdef public _factory_data
    cdef object __weakref__
    cdef long _hash_value
```

The point is: `CategoryObject` already has functions dealing with generators, such as the `_populate_generators_()` method. So why not `gens_dict()` then?

And my proposed patch is actually compatible with the deprecation of `ParentWithGens`, since it *removes* something from `ParentWithGens`.

Could you also remove the custom implementation in `PolynomialRing` as the following seems to work

```
sage: Parent.gens_dict(QQ['x'])
{'x': x}
sage: Parent.gens_dict(QQ['x,y'])
{'x': x, 'y': y}
```
