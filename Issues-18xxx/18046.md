I've just pushed a commit containing updated code so that graphs with multiedges can be tex-ified, but there's a particular case that still causes issue: when a set of multiedges contain labels, their customizations do not match up correctly.

My first guess was that this due to the nature of using a dict_of_dicts to track all edge/vertex properties, which python then gets the order of hashable items mixed up.

See below for a test case illustrating the issue:

```
mygraph = DiGraph(multiedges=True)
mygraph.add_edge('A','B','thinnest')
mygraph.add_edge('A','B','blah')
mygraph.add_edge('A','B','thickest')
mygraph.add_edge('A','C','blah')
mygraph.add_edge('B','C','blah')
mygraph.add_edge('C','B','blah')
mygraph.set_latex_options(
    units='in',
    graphic_size=(6,6),
    edge_thickness=0.01,
    edge_labels=True,
    edge_thicknesses={('A','B'):[0.01,0.025,0.05]},
    )
print latex(mygraph)
view(latex(mygraph))
```

I've specified a list of thicknesses for the multiedges 'A' -> 'B'. Their labels were defined in a particular order, and the thicknesses are meant to match this order, but they don't.. any ideas?

Hello,

Several other remarks:

- These days I have been told that we should use `isinstance(x,list)` instead of
  `type(x) in [list]`. Note that the following works:

    sage: isinstance([],(list,dict))
    True
    sage: isinstance({},(list,dict))
    True
    sage: isinstance(5,(list,dict))
    True

- Now, this file looks rather messy and you apparently tried to get your code to
  'fit in the local style'. It seems that they define a variable named
  `number_types` that you could use.

- `et` -> no short name please.

- This line contains both `and` and `or`. Could you add parentheses where they belong ?

  `if self._graph.is_directed() or self._graph.allows_multiple_edges() and not loop:`

- Could you write the proper documentation (in the INPUT section of the docstring) for the parameter `edge_thickness` in
  case of multiple edges?

- Your error message is misleading: it is not that multiple customization of
  multiedges is impossible, it is that only `thickness` can be set. At least,
  this is what your condition tests.

- What is the difference between `->` and `post` in TikZ? Why did you make that
  change?

- Is there any reason why you call `self._graph.edge_label(edge[0],edge[1])`?
  That value should already be equal to `e[2]`, shouldn't it?

Nathann

The color issue seems like a lot of work, because each vertex/edge color is specified via unique `\\definecolor{}{rgb}{`} latex definitions, instead of just passing colors as strings. From what I can tell from the documentation (though I don't understand French), tkz-graph understands colors as strings, so it seems like the entire set of `\\definecolor{}{rgb}{`} definitions are unnecessary. Perhaps one should open a ticket just for updating this feature? I could see an update to this being more useful for my own purposes, but it also just seems better to just have colors specified within each edge's tex-string.\n\n> - What is the difference between `->` and `post` in TikZ? Why did you make that change?\n\n\nI don't know what `post` is, but I replaced it with `->` because `post` doesn't respect line widths and it's not in the most recent documentation (https://www.ctan.org/pkg/tkz-graph).\n\n> - Is there any reason why you call `self._graph.edge_label(edge[0],edge[1])`? That value should already be equal to `e[2]`, shouldn't it?\n\n\nHmm that wasn't my doing, but I did find out that attempting to refer to `e[2]` absolutely doesn't maintain the order in which the edge labels are called, which I find very bizarre.

Thanks for your feedback. Sorry for missing some of the style rules, but some of the issues you raise are actually left over from previous work. Regardless, I've tried to fix them the best I can.

> - Your error message is misleading: it is not that multiple customization of multiedges is impossible, it is that only `thickness` can be set. At least, this is what your condition tests.


I've edited the message to read "Edge-specific colors are not available for multiedges.", so that it only refers to the case of edge_colors, which I wasn't up to the task of fixing immediately. The color issue seems like a lot of work, because each vertex/edge color is specified via unique `\definecolor{}{rgb}{`} latex definitions, instead of just passing colors as strings. From what I can tell from the documentation (though I don't understand French), tkz-graph understands colors as strings, so it seems like the entire set of `\definecolor{}{rgb}{`} definitions are unnecessary. Perhaps one should open a ticket just for updating this feature? I could see an update to this being more useful for my own purposes, but it also just seems better to just have colors specified within each edge's tex-string.

> - What is the difference between `->` and `post` in TikZ? Why did you make that change?


I don't know what `post` is, but I replaced it with `->` because `post` doesn't respect line widths and it's not in the most recent documentation (https://www.ctan.org/pkg/tkz-graph).

> - Is there any reason why you call `self._graph.edge_label(edge[0],edge[1])`? That value should already be equal to `e[2]`, shouldn't it?


Hmm that wasn't my doing, but I did find out that attempting to refer to `e[2]` absolutely doesn't maintain the order in which the edge labels are called, which I find very bizarre. Leaving it as-is will at least ensure that my fix for `edge_thicknesses` works properly.

Helloooooooooooo,

Several coments:

- Could you add to the doctests an example of a graph plot which uses the new
  feature you impplemented?

- `if isinstance(x, list) and (not isinstance(x[0], number_types) or not x[0] >= 0.0):`

  This code only tests if the *first* element of the list is a positive. You
  should probably replace
  `x[0] >= 0.0`
  with
  `all(xx>=0 for xx in x)`

- The previous test appears so often that it would be better to define a
  `is_positive_number=lambda x:isinstance(x, number_types) and x >= 0.0` and
  use it everywhere.

- In this block of code

  ```
  reverse_index = len(edge_thickness) - (multiedge_index+1)
  edge_thickness = edge_thickness[reverse_index]
  ```
  You should probably use the following Python trick

  ```
  sage: a=[1,2,3,4,5,6]
  sage: a[-1]
  6
  sage: a[-4]
  3
  sage: a[-5]
  2
  sage: a[-6]
  1
  ```

Short of this the code looks good. Thanks,

Nathann
