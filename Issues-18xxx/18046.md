It was discovered that the LaTeX module for graphs raises the NotImplementedError for graphs containing multiple edges (`multiedges=True`). The intention of this ticket is to incorporate the fixes needed to typeset a graph with latex.

I've just pushed a commit containing updated code so that graphs with multiedges can be tex-ified, but there's a particular case that still causes issue: when a set of multiedges contain labels, their customizations do not match up correctly.

My first guess was that this due to the nature of using a dict_of_dicts to track all edge/vertex properties, which python then gets the order of hashable items mixed up.

See below for a test case illustrating the issue:

```
mygraph = DiGraph(multiedges=True)
mygraph.add_edge('A','B','thinnest')
mygraph.add_edge('A','B','blah')
mygraph.add_edge('A','B','thickest')
mygraph.add_edge('A','C','blah')
mygraph.add_edge('B','C','blah')
mygraph.add_edge('C','B','blah')
mygraph.set_latex_options(
    units='in',
    graphic_size=(6,6),
    edge_thickness=0.01,
    edge_labels=True,
    edge_thicknesses={('A','B'):[0.01,0.025,0.05]},
    )
print latex(mygraph)
view(latex(mygraph))
```

I've specified a list of thicknesses for the multiedges 'A' -> 'B'. Their labels were defined in a particular order, and the thicknesses are meant to match this order, but they don't.. any ideas?

<div id="comment:7" align="right">comment:7</div>

Hello,

Several other remarks:

- These days I have been told that we should use `isinstance(x,list)` instead of
  `type(x) in [list]`. Note that the following works:

    sage: isinstance([],(list,dict))
    True
    sage: isinstance({},(list,dict))
    True
    sage: isinstance(5,(list,dict))
    True

- Now, this file looks rather messy and you apparently tried to get your code to
  'fit in the local style'. It seems that they define a variable named
  `number_types` that you could use.

- `et` -> no short name please.

- This line contains both `and` and `or`. Could you add parentheses where they belong ?

  `if self._graph.is_directed() or self._graph.allows_multiple_edges() and not loop:`

- Could you write the proper documentation (in the INPUT section of the docstring) for the parameter `edge_thickness` in
  case of multiple edges?

- Your error message is misleading: it is not that multiple customization of
  multiedges is impossible, it is that only `thickness` can be set. At least,
  this is what your condition tests.

- What is the difference between `->` and `post` in TikZ? Why did you make that
  change?

- Is there any reason why you call `self._graph.edge_label(edge[0],edge[1])`?
  That value should already be equal to `e[2]`, shouldn't it?

Nathann

I've edited the message to read "Edge-specific colors are not available for multiedges.", so that it only refers to the case of edge_colors, which I wasn't up to the task of fixing immediately. The color issue seems like a lot of work, because each vertex/edge color is specified via unique `\definecolor{}{rgb}{`} latex definitions, instead of just passing colors as strings.

I don't know what `post` is, but I replaced it with `->` because `post` doesn't respect line widths and it's not in the most recent documentation (https://www.ctan.org/pkg/tkz-graph).

> - Is there any reason why you call `self._graph.edge_label(edge[0],edge[1])`? That value should already be equal to `e[2]`, shouldn't it?

Hmm that wasn't my doing, but I did find out that attempting to refer to `e[2]` absolutely doesn't maintain the order in which the edge labels are called, which I find very bizarre. Leaving it as-is will at least ensure that my fix for `edge_thicknesses` works properly.

Helloooooooooooo,

Several coments:

- Could you add to the doctests an example of a graph plot which uses the new
  feature you impplemented?

- `if isinstance(x, list) and (not isinstance(x[0], number_types) or not x[0] >= 0.0):`

  This code only tests if the *first* element of the list is a positive. You
  should probably replace
  `x[0] >= 0.0`
  with
  `all(xx>=0 for xx in x)`

- The previous test appears so often that it would be better to define a
  `is_positive_number=lambda x:isinstance(x, number_types) and x >= 0.0` and
  use it everywhere.

- In this block of code

  ```
  reverse_index = len(edge_thickness) - (multiedge_index+1)
  edge_thickness = edge_thickness[reverse_index]
  ```
  You should probably use the following Python trick

  ```
  sage: a=[1,2,3,4,5,6]
  sage: a[-1]
  6
  sage: a[-4]
  3
  sage: a[-5]
  2
  sage: a[-6]
  1
  ```

Short of this the code looks good. Thanks,

Nathann
