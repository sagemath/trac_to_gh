When a Python function always returns `None`, you usually don't put an explicit `return None` at the end either. This function *always* returns 0, so why write it explicitly? The only reason why the return value is `int` is for exception handling. Mentally, this function should really be `void c_sage_inputhook()`.

Side comment: I once asked Cython upstream to include a new type for situations like these (`vint` would be a good name, for `void + int`, analogous to `bint` for `bool + int`), but they didn't like that.

Ok ; I do not feel very competent here. Nevertheless, I have looked at the changes,
and they look reasonable and innocent enough.

Given that the patchbot has given a green light, I would be ready to propose a positive
review. But maybe you would like a more serious review ?

To be honest, I also think the code looks good (I am the author after all). So I'm interpreting your comment as "positive_review".
