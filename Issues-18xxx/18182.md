I've reviewed David's part, but I am also an author of this ticket; thus I request an additional reviewer.

Note that there is still one failing doctest, where I don't have any glue why (it is the bug at the very top of the file). Who knows what is going on there?

Kind of fixed; now calling the cartesian product by `cartesian_product`, which produces the correct result.

There are still two failing doctests.

<a id='comment:20'></a>
Hello!

I had a look at the changes on this ticket, made a few reviewer commits, and I have the following comments:

1. `categories.modules.CartesianProducts`: I'm not entirely sure about how everything is handled here:
   - `ParentMethods.base_ring`: It seems as if the base ring of the cartesian product of some modules is considered to be the base ring of the first module in the list. Is this intended?
   - Should different base rings of the modules in a cartesian product be allowed? If so, this has to be fixed:

    ```
      sage: E = CombinatorialFreeModule(ZZ, [1,2])
      sage: F = CombinatorialFreeModule(QQ, ['a', 'b'])
      sage: cartesian_product([E, F])
      Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
      AttributeError: 'CommutativeAdditiveGroups.CartesianProducts_with_c' object has no attribute 'FiniteDimensional'
    ```
   - Otherwise, if this should not be supported, the error message should be replaced by something more meaningful.

Note that fixing these things would be suitable for a follow-up ticket, as the current behavior is (as far as I can tell) correct: if the base rings of the modules coincide, the cartesian product can be built (at least in the examples I tried). Otherwise, a (unfortunately rather strange) exception is raised. And in the case where all base rings coincide, `base_ring` can of course return the base ring of any of the passed modules.

2. `categories.pushout.ConstructionFunctor.common_base`: I think that `Raise a CoercionException` does not fit in a `OUTPUT`-block from a semantic point of view.

3. `categories.pushout.MultivariateConstructionFunctor`: Is there a reason for the import of `CartesianProduct` in the `TESTS`-block? (I've removed the import in one of my commits.)

4. `MultivariateConstructionFunctor.common_base`: Could you explain why you use `get_coercion_model().common_parent(...)` instead of `pushout(...)`?

5. `pushout`: Is there a reason for using

  ```
    sage: from sage.sets.cartesian_product import CartesianProduct
    sage: A = CartesianProduct((ZZ['x'], QQ['y'], QQ['z']), Sets().CartesianProducts())
   ```
   over

  ```
    sage: A = cartesian_product((ZZ['x'], QQ['y'], QQ['z']))
   ```
   As far as I can tell, the only difference is in the categories -- but they aren't used in these doctests.

6. `pushout`: Am I right in the assumption that the reason for the check `.. and R_tower[-1][0] is not None` is that when considering, for example

  ```
    sage: from sage.categories.pushout import pushout
    sage: pushout(ZZ, cartesian_product([ZZ, QQ]))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    CoercionException: 'NoneType' object is not iterable
   ```
   that a `CoercionException` is thrown (instead of an `AttributeError` for the failed call to `R_tower[-1][0].common_base(...)` in the line after the check)? Or is there more to it? Would it make sense to add a doctest for this exact case? (I've included one in my reviewer commits; proceed with it as you like.)

7. `pushout`: `CartesianProductPolys` vs. `CartesianProductPoly`? (cf. #18223 `;-)`).

Benjamin

This is now #19375.

Rewritten (but I am open to suggestions if you want something different)

Thanks.

We need a common parent, thus `common_parent` is the correct method to call. A pushout is one possible way to construct a common parent, but there are other ways; e.g. one could coerce into the other, or there is a scalar multiplication or action available.

This is to check that it works as well (there was once a bug with this kind of construction, thus a doctest was added).

Yes, this is the reason. An `AttributeError does not work with some of the calling functions; they need a `CoercionException`.

> Or is there more to it? 


No.

> Would it make sense to add a doctest for this exact case? (I've included one in my reviewer commits; proceed with it as you like.)


Thanks.

> 7. `pushout`: `CartesianProductPolys` vs. `CartesianProductPoly`? (cf. #18223 `;-)`).


Done.

Perfect.

No, the way you've rewritten it is fine.

Alright.

I cross-checked your changes, everything seems to work now, and I have no more comments.

The documentation builds and `make ptestlong` passes. --> `positive_review`.
