For now, linear codes don't have a proper structure for decoding, where "decoding" means using an error-correction algorithm to recover the original codeword.

We propose in this ticket a new structure, designed to handle word -> codeword and word -> message transformations.

We provide the following:

- An abstract class `Decoder`, for inheritances purposes. Every `Decoder` will inherit from this class. It contains:
    - a default constructor;
    - `decode_to_code` and `decode_to_message` default implementation;
    - several methods to get information on the instance of the class and
    - explanations on what to do to create a new decoder subclass. 

- An exception class `DecodingFailure`, for errors related to decoding algorithms. 

- Methods for decoding handling in `AbstractLinearCode` (see Design) 

## Design


What "Decoding" means depends on the algorithm used to find and correct the errors in a provided word. For instance, there are decoding algorithms able to locate and correct up to a certain amount of errors, and will fail if there is more errors than this bound. Others will return a list of codewords, which contain the original codeword. Some decoding algorithms are probabilistic, some are deterministic.

To describe the variety of behaviours, we introduce a list of "types", called `_decoder_type` which is a set of keywords describing the semantics of the decoding algorithm represented by the class.

Decodig usually recovers codewords close to the provided words. Some decoding algorithms, however, naturally decode directly to the message from which the codeword was obtained. This is e.g. the case with the Berlekamp-Welch or the Guruswami-Sudan algorithms. Since both uses are natural and in common use in theory and practice, we provide two different methods: decode_to_code and decode_to_message. The former corrects the errors and return an element from the code, while the latter corrects the errors and returns an element from a message space. Thanks to a default implementation, reimplmenting both is not needed. One only needs to override one of these two methods in a Decoder class, and the default implementation will be used to perform the other one.

As is discussed in #18376, a code can have many message spaces, and the map between a message space and the code is given by an Encoder. The `decode_to_message` will pertain to a certain such `Encoder`, so we introduce the string field `_connected_encoder_name` to point to this encoder. A user can acquire the actual `Encoder` object by calling `Decoder.connected_encoder`.

Furthermore, we propose here the exact same structure of registration for decoders as the one we introduced in #18376, and the same handling of it on the level of codes: each code will have a `default_decoder`, so if one does not want to be bothered by multiple decoding algorithms when he just wants to decode a word `y` for his code `C`, all he has to do is to write `C.decode_to_code(y)`, and the default decoder will be used to correct the errors in `y`.

With this structure, we are able to represent different decoding algorithms for each code, even if they have different behaviour. We also have a versatile structure which allows specific experimentation on chosen decoding algorithms alongside with generic decodings in which the algorithm does not matter.


## Notes

This ticket relies on the encoding structure proposed on trac #18376, as every decoder has to be linked with an encoder. 

The original decoding algorithms, which were in decoder.py are now in two different `Decoder` objects in `linear_code.py`. I removed the guava one as the call to guava's decoding algorithm returned a guava error.

Depends on #18376

+Decodig usually recovers codewords close to the provided words. Some decoding algorithms, however, naturally decode directly to the message from which the codeword was obtained. This is e.g. the case with the Berlekamp-Welch or the Guruswami-Sudan algorithms. Since both uses are natural and in common use in theory and practice, we provide two different methods: decode_to_code and decode_to_message. The former corrects the errors and return an element from the code, while the latter corrects the errors and returns an element from a message space. Thanks to a default implementation, reimplmenting both is not needed. One only needs to override one of these two methods in a Decoder class, and the default implementation will be used to perform the other one.
+
+As is discussed in #18376, a code can have many message spaces, and the map between a message space and the code is given by an Encoder. The `decode_to_message` will pertain to a certain such `Encoder`, so we introduce the string field `_connected_encoder_name` to point to this encoder. A user can acquire the actual `Encoder` object by calling `Decoder.connected_encoder`.
+
+Furthermore, we propose here the exact same structure of registration for decoders as the one we introduced in #18376, and the same handling of it on the level of codes: each code will have a `default_decoder`, so if one does not want to be bothered by multiple decoding algorithms when he just wants to decode a word `y` for his code `C`, all he has to do is to write `C.decode_to_code(y)`, and the default decoder will be used to correct the errors in `y`.
 
 With this structure, we are able to represent different decoding algorithms for each code, even if they have different behaviour. We also have a versatile structure which allows specific experimentation on chosen decoding algorithms alongside with generic decodings in which the algorithm does not matter.

The semantic of the field: `input_space` of a decoder is unclear.
It seems to me that it should corresponds to the ambient space of the associated code, and it is implemented this way line 246 of decoder.py or line 4028 of linear_code.py. 
But line 75 of decoder.py, it is set to `code.base_field()`.

Also a clear definition of what this field means should be added somewhere.

In the current state, the output of the hash function does not depend on the code, but only on its dimensions. (changing some coeffcients in the generating matrix G line 107 of decoder.py does not change the hash of the linear code and therefore does not change the hash of the decoder neither.

This remark is just to point out this inconsistency: either add a `__hash__` in encoder and in linear_code or remove the hash here.

I'm confused by the syndrome method.
It really looks to me as a "NearestNeighbor" decoding, not as syndrome decoding.

Syndrome decoding means (following Roth's Book)
1/ compute the syndrome s=Hy  where H is the parity check matrix
2/ Among the coset of vectors sharing the same syndrome, return the coset leader, with minimal Hamming weight

I don't see any parity check matrix here, and the output is simply the leader of the coset of **all** r+C vectors.

+ fix the docstring "Returns the all ..."
