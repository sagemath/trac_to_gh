Currently, Sage doesn't install any files other than `.py` and compiled cython code. Headers and other auxiliary files that are necessary for compiling user code (such as the `cython()` command or certain optional packages) are kept in the `src` directory and we rely on its presence. Since #18027 we also rely on the presence of the `src/build/cythonized` directory. It would be good if sage could just work without relying on the presence of it source and build directory.

I wouldn't copy stuff to `SAGE_SRC`. The build system should treat the source directory as read-only as much as possible.

When you talked about "an installed `interrupt_api.h`" in [comment:10], which installation location did you mean?

Ultimately I was thinking `SAGE_LOCAL/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/ext/interrupt/`, site-packages is the final installation destination. I get what you mean by keeping source pristine, we would like building out of source as much as possible, must have hurt to mess up with that to autogenerate the pari stuff, of course you can argue that you prepared the source before putting it through `setup.py`.

In any case I am not sure what would effectively be a two passes approach is a good idea.

It does to me, it means that I need to make two ebuilds because I cannot break the order "prepare/configure/build/install/merge". I don't think it matters much to add an entry to `include_dirs` in `setup.py`. It is not used for anything but building/installing unlike `cython.py`.

I disagree. include dirs being the same in `setup.py` and `cython.py` is on the nice to have list but there is no compelling reason why install time and runtime absolutely have to match. In this particular case having the same list in `cython.py` has in `setup.py` means that you want to use the source instead of the installed files at runtime. I don't find that compelling. I cannot really accept a cythonize/"install headers"/build/"final install" routine which could put the two in agreement. I think that's undue complication an breaking of standard building procedures.

So what the current branch does:
* clean up the "cythonized" path from `pxi.h`
* clean `cython.py` so it use installed include directories rather than source ones. Prune useless directories as well and use python mechanism as much as possible rather than path "knowledge" (potentially help python2.3 as well)
* add cythonized include path in `setup.py` so that `pxi.h` can find the generated include files at build time
* add sections to `setup.py` to install header files under `sage/ext` including the generated headers. Also install all `.pxi` and `.pxd` files
* also replace one instance of path knowledge by python mechanism in `source.py`

There is more that could be done but I don't want to extend the scope of the ticket. I have bled a little on one extra file as it is.

That would be clever. I'll try that.

It is actually quite hard to work out which `.pxi`/`.pxd` will never be used which why I included the `padics` files. There is no other python sources in that directory so to package them I either have to do it as a `data_files`  or introduce a special case in `package_data`. Any chance of them being obsolete?

I'll check my space after commas and correct the surroundings. I usually follow the style of what I change rather than move to a new style but I guess the space after comma should really be the standard.

I cannot really say but I see the last dependency of #17854 is getting rid of something NTL related.
Our NTL wrapping code is really terrible with regards to what Cython can now do and we should definitely rewrite it all using actual C++ bindings.
This is not so difficult but very time consuming...

> Our NTL wrapping code is really terrible with regards to what Cython can now do and we should definitely rewrite it all using actual C++ bindings.
> This is not so difficult but very time consuming...

I agree completely with the above statement. Note that #18367 doesn't really clean-up the NTL interface, it just moves it from `c_lib` to the Sage library.

It seems to need re-basing but #18367 seems to be clean and ready for a run on the patchbot as far as I can see.

OK, regardless I have noticed that #18450 is also needed and in need of review. And there seem to be no progress with upstream cython on that one, which puts a damper on the whole thing.

It is not really needed for #18450, it's mostly a dependency to avoid conflicts.

Yes very strange conversation I have to agree. Upstream think their reasons are obvious. Unfortunately while I am sure you don't care it makes my other life a bit too "interesting".

Least you think I am not working on this. My attention had to be divided between a number of things but I am still working on this. Any recommendation on where to put this function? We do not want to put it in `cython.py` because we don't want to import any bits of it in `setup.py` (bad things will happen to you if you do). I don't want to put it anywhere in `sage_setup` because it should only be used at build time not runtime, same for `module_list.py`. `env.py` could be interesting if I can get away with it. The other possibilities: 
* its own file

opinions?

Actually, `env.py` sounds like a good suggestion. You'll need to move `SAGE_INC` (currently defined in `setup.py`) also to `env.py`.

I'd wait for 6.8.beta3 though to be safe with merge conflicts.

Ok I initially did that and reverted because it broke a doctest (`sage/repl/interpreter.py`) but I have no objection to making it absolute and fixing the doctest instead. 

All comments sound good to me, I guess my vocabulary on "phase" is packaging speak, your suggestion is simpler.

I don't want to assume that all `cython_generated_files` are in `sage/ext/interrupt`, so I don't like this:

```
python_data_files = [
    (os.path.join(SAGE_LIB, 'sage', 'ext', 'interrupt'), cython_generated_files)

```

Eventually, also files like `src/build/cythonized/sage/modular/arithgroup/farey_symbol.h` should be installed in the correct directory.

I agree and what you did is not quite what I had in mind: the point is that the `ext/interrupt` should be *computed* from the `os.path.join(SAGE_CYTHONIZED, 'sage', 'ext', 'interrupt', 'interrupt.h')` part.

On the other hard, if you're tired of making these changes, they could be postponed to a follow-up ticket.

No, changing `setup.py` triggers re-compilation of everything (i.e. running of `gcc`) but not re-cythonizing. The usual trick to do that is to change what's in the `.cython_version` file, see line 545 of `setup.py`.
