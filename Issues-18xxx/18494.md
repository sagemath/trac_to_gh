Currently, Sage doesn't install any files other than `.py` and compiled cython code. Headers and other auxiliary files that are necessary for compiling user code (such as the `cython()` command or certain optional packages) are kept in the `src` directory and we rely on its presence. Since #18027 we also rely on the presence of the `src/build/cythonized` directory. It would be good if sage could just work without relying on the presence of it source and build directory.

It does to me, it means that I need to make two ebuilds because I cannot break the order "prepare/configure/build/install/merge". I don't think it matters much to add an entry to `include_dirs` in `setup.py`. It is not used for anything but building/installing unlike `cython.py`.

                os.path.join(SAGE_SRC,'sage','ext'), \
                os.path.join(SAGE_SRC), \
                os.path.join(SAGE_SRC,'sage','gsl')]
```
Any ideas why we add `SAGE_SRC` and `SAGE_SRC/sage/gsl`? Neither has any headers in it although I am guessing `gsl` may have had once.

I disagree. include dirs being the same in `setup.py` and `cython.py` is on the nice to have list but there is no compelling reason why install time and runtime absolutely have to match. In this particular case having the same list in `cython.py` has in `setup.py` means that you want to use the source instead of the installed files at runtime. I don't find that compelling. I cannot really accept a cythonize/"install headers"/build/"final install" routine which could put the two in agreement. I think that's undue complication an breaking of standard building procedures.

So what the current branch does:
* clean up the "cythonized" path from `pxi.h`
* clean `cython.py` so it use installed include directories rather than source ones. Prune useless directories as well and use python mechanism as much as possible rather than path "knowledge" (potentially help python2.3 as well)
* add cythonized include path in `setup.py` so that `pxi.h` can find the generated include files at build time
* add sections to `setup.py` to install header files under `sage/ext` including the generated headers. Also install all `.pxi` and `.pxd` files
* also replace one instance of path knowledge by python mechanism in `source.py`

There is more that could be done but I don't want to extend the scope of the ticket. I have bled a little on one extra file as it is.

returning the include directories for `cython()` if `sage_lib_dir` is `SAGE_LIB` and returning the include directories for `src/setup.py` if `sage_lib_dir` is `SAGE_SRC`. I haven't thought about is that much, but I think that's the right direction to go.

Did I just make sage automatically load `numpy` by importing it in `cython.py`?

```
sage -t --long src/sage/tests/startup.py
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/tests/startup.py", line 6, in sage.tests.startup
Failed example:
    'numpy' in sys.modules
Expected:
    False
Got:
    True
```

That would be clever. I'll try that.

It is actually quite hard to work out which `.pxi`/`.pxd` will never be used which why I included the `padics` files. There is no other python sources in that directory so to package them I either have to do it as a `data_files`  or introduce a special case in `package_data`. Any chance of them being obsolete?

I'll check my space after commas and correct the surroundings. I usually follow the style of what I change rather than move to a new style but I guess the space after comma should really be the standard.

I cannot really say but I see the last dependency of #17854 is getting rid of something NTL related.
Our NTL wrapping code is really terrible with regards to what Cython can now do and we should definitely rewrite it all using actual C++ bindings.
This is not so difficult but very time consuming...
So maybe waiting for #17854 is not the right thing to do.

It is not really needed for #18450, it's mostly a dependency to avoid conflicts.

But a very tiny damper regardless. It's trivial to fix #18450 such that it does not depend on the non-accepted Cython patch.

Yes very strange conversation I have to agree. Upstream think their reasons are obvious. Unfortunately while I am sure you don't care it makes my other life a bit too "interesting". 

But I should start re-writing stuff for this ticket, if there are conflicts we'll sort them out when we work out the merge order.

Least you think I am not working on this. My attention had to be divided between a number of things but I am still working on this. Any recommendation on where to put this function? We do not want to put it in `cython.py` because we don't want to import any bits of it in `setup.py` (bad things will happen to you if you do). I don't want to put it anywhere in `sage_setup` because it should only be used at build time not runtime, same for `module_list.py`. `env.py` could be interesting if I can get away with it. The other possibilities: 
* its own file
* something I haven't thought about

opinions?

Actually, `env.py` sounds like a good suggestion. You'll need to move `SAGE_INC` (currently defined in `setup.py`) also to `env.py`.

I'd wait for 6.8.beta3 though to be safe with merge conflicts.

For me, you don't need to wait to put it to needs_review, just be aware of #9552, #18450, #18367 (and #17854 which isn't reviewed yet).

Replying to [jdemeyer](#comment%3A66):

Ok I initially did that and reverted because it broke a doctest (`sage/repl/interpreter.py`) but I have no objection to making it absolute and fixing the doctest instead. 

All comments sound good to me, I guess my vocabulary on "phase" is packaging speak, your suggestion is simpler.

I don't want to assume that all `cython_generated_files` are in `sage/ext/interrupt`, so I don't like this:

```
python_data_files = [
    (os.path.join(SAGE_LIB, 'sage', 'ext', 'interrupt'), cython_generated_files)
]
```

Eventually, also files like `src/build/cythonized/sage/modular/arithgroup/farey_symbol.h` should be installed in the correct directory.

I agree and what you did is not quite what I had in mind: the point is that the `ext/interrupt` should be *computed* from the `os.path.join(SAGE_CYTHONIZED, 'sage', 'ext', 'interrupt', 'interrupt.h')` part.

On the other hard, if you're tired of making these changes, they could be postponed to a follow-up ticket.

Sorry for the delay but I  still have problems with trac12375. I have tried to isolate the problem:
(can you reproduce it?)

setup.py:

```/usr/bin/env sage -python
from sage.env import *
import os

###
try:
    # Sage >= 6.8
    from sage.env import sage_include_directories
except ImportError:
    # Sage < 6.8
    def sage_include_directories(source=True):
        return [
            os.path.join(SAGE_LOCAL, "include"),
            os.path.join(SAGE_LOCAL, "include", "csage"),
            os.path.join(SAGE_SRC),
            os.path.join(SAGE_SRC, "sage", "ext"),
            ]
###

from distutils.core import setup
from distutils.extension import Extension


cmdclass = { }
ext_modules = [ ]

include_dirs=sage_include_directories(True)

from Cython.Distutils import build_ext

ext_modules+=[Extension(
                   "giacpy",                 # name of extension
                   ["giacpy.pyx"], #  our Cython source
                   include_dirs=include_dirs,
                   language="c++")]
cmdclass={'build_ext': build_ext}


setup(
    ext_modules=ext_modules,
    cmdclass=cmdclass
    )
```

and giacpy.pyx

```
from sage.rings.integer cimport Integer
from sage.env import * ##without this line it builts
include 'sage/ext/interrupt.pxi'
include 'sage/ext/stdsage.pxi'
```

gives:

```
giacpy.cpp: In function ‚Äòint __pyx_import_star_set(PyObject*, PyObject*, char*)‚Äô:

Two remarks, in `setup.py` you have

```
include_dirs=sage_include_directories(True)
```
It should be 

```
include_dirs=sage_include_directories()
```
In `giacpy.pyx` why would you need `from sage.env import *`? What do you need from this?

Yes, I understood that. I'm saying that, regardless of earlier Sage versions, the best way forward is to use #18494 anyway.
