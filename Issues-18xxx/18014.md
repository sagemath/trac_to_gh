Being a ribbon means not just containing no 2x2 squares; it also means being connected.

```
sage: SkewPartition([[3,1],[2]])
[3, 1] / [2]
sage: _.is_ribbon()
True
```

Good news is that these methods seem to never be used.

A correct way to check if a skew partition `\lambda / \mu` is a ribbon is the following: Let `u` be the smallest positive integer for which `\lambda_u > \mu_u`. Let `v` be the largest integer greater (strictly greater!!) than `u` for which `\lambda_v = \mu_{v-1} + 1`. If every `i > v` satisfies `\lambda_i = \mu_i`, then `\lambda / \mu` is a ribbon; otherwise it is not.
