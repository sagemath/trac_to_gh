Before:

```python
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(GF(5), sparse=True)
sage: (1+x)^(5^10)
... (hangs for ever)
```

After:

```python
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(GF(5), sparse=True)
sage: (1+x)^(5^10)
x^9765625 + 1
```

**Notes.**
1. I've tried to be careful with quite extensive tests not to slow down the computations for "easy" cases. This explains the threshold values in the code.
2. This is related to #7253 and #12660. Though, there is another problem for non-sparse polynomials: Simply assigning the value and printing the polynomial take a very long time. Compare the timings for
    {{{#!python
    sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
    sage: 1+x<sup>5</sup>10
    x^9765625 + 1
    }}}
    and 
    {{{#!python
    sage: R.<x> = GF(5)[]
    sage: 1+x<sup>5</sup>10
    x^9765625 + 1
    }}}
    Thus for tickets #7253 and #12660 to be closed, it remains to handle this other problem, but this is not the purpose of this ticket.

Right, because my doctest was wrong: The code is intended for sparse polynomials. I have not really been able yet to determine what is precisely going on for dense polynomial. Though, as indicated by [comment:6 fwclarke] and mentioned in my note 2. in the description, there is another problem for dense polynomial, namely that creating a large polynomial over a finite field takes a very long time. It is not the purpose of this ticket to correct this, even though it should be corrected!

This patch thus improves the situation for *sparse polynomials only*. The code is indeed not used for dense polynomials over `Zmod(k)` for any `k` since specific code appears in `src/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_template.pxi` for this case.

**Important note:** I forgot to test whether the base ring is a field, which is of course mandatory. I correct this mistake in my latest commit.

Why is this "of course" mandatory? You need that the characteristic is a prime number, not that the base ring is a field.

<a id='comment:13'></a>The algorithm I proposed was completely wrong: If `p` is the characteristic and `n=p * q + r`, I used the **wrong** identity `f(x)^n = f(x^{p*q}) * f(x)^r` instead of the correct `f(x)^n = f(x<sup>p)</sup>q * f(x)^r`. 

In the commit, I correct this mistake, and in the same time I take [comment:10 jdemeyer]'s comments into account:
- I add doctests for the different possibilities. (Note that I wrote code for the case where the base ring is a finite field and the polynomials are in dense representation, though as I wrote [comment:9 above] this code is not used since there is specific code in `polynomial_template.pxi`. Thus there is no doctest for this case.)
- "Of course", it is not "of course mandatory" for the base ring to be a finite field...

Furthermore, I improve the code not using `self.subs(...)`, but rather doing the computations myself.

<a id='comment:17'></a>I think this test is much too weak:

```
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(GF(17), sparse=True)
sage: for d in [17, 264, 516]:
....: assert((1+x)^d == generic_power(1+x,d))
```

(but I'll wait to suggest a better test until I understand the code better).

I had run some tests and my conclusion that was using `generic_power` was faster in characteristic 2. (Note that binary exponentiation is well suited to this characteristic.) I am not able to reproduce this behavior though, so I removed the special case.

Done.

Replying to [comment:19 jdemeyer]:

Actually, the current code is faster for finite fields. With the special case:

```python
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(GF(17),sparse=True)
sage: p = R.random_element(100)
sage: %timeit p^(17^5)
The slowest run took 11.13 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
1000 loops, best of 3: 159 µs per loop
```

Without the special case, with the same `p`:

```python
%timeit p^(17^5)
The slowest run took 26.59 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
1000 loops, best of 3: 249 µs per loop
```

I may refactor the code though so that it is less redundant. Tell me what you think.

I am happy if you find a good way to test this function!

You have many cases and they should all be tested:

```
sage: R1 = PolynomialRing(GF(8, 'a'), 'x')
sage: R2 = PolynomialRing(GF(9, 'b'), 'x', sparse=True)
sage: R3 = PolynomialRing(R2, 'y')
sage: R4 = PolynomialRing(R1, 'y', sparse=True)
sage: for d in range(40):  # long time
....:     for R in [R1, R2, R3, R4]:
....:         a = R.random_element()
....:         assert a^d == generic_power(a, d)

I introduced your proposed doctest, with the following change: Since I put a threshold `20` on the exponent before using the new code (for efficiency reasons), the loop is `for d in range(20,40)`.

Actually, the code was not correct for non-prime finite fields... (The special case should have been for prime finite fields only.) So I finally followed your advice and removed the special case. In the same time, I refactored a bit the code.
