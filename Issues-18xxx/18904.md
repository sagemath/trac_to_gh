With this branch, the default value of `--optional` in `sage -t` is larger than the list of installed new-style optional packages.

In particular, `cplex` and `gurobi` (which are not optional packages as they are proprietary) are added to the list (some tests are too slow to be run with glpk, e.g. #18871).

More can be added to that list. If you know a better way to implement it, I am all ears.

I am not sure that I understand what you propose. Do you want to have somewhere a list of the packages that we do nto distribute, along with a list of functions testing if they can be used (e.g. detect licenses)? In which file, and how?

For CPLEX and Gurobi, the tests I used handle the case when the license is wrong.

```
sage: MixedIntegerLinearProgram(solver='gurobi')
...
MIPSolverException: 'Gurobi: HostID mismatch (licensed to 52332a80, hostid is 230063bf) (GRB_ERROR_NO_LICENSE)'
```

not tested (don't know how to test that script in `sage/doctests`):

```python
        def tryer(s):
            exec('from sage.interfaces.'+s+' import '+s)
            try:
                eval(s+'(1)')
                options.optional.add(s)
            except:
                pass

        for stuff in ['matlab', 'maple', 'macaulay2', 'octave', 'scilab']:

Are we sure that we actually *want* to do this? We have no control over those external packages. What if somebody has `magma` but with a version that is not fully compatible with Sage? With Sage's optional packages, that issue does not occur since we have full control over those packages.

A few comments on the code:
1. Never use `except:`. Use `except Exception:` or some other specific exception class.
2. Code structure: can we please move all this detect-optional-packages code to a separate function?
3. Performance: how much time does it take to run all those tests? Note that #13540 has a system for "lazy" checking of optional dependencies: the check for a given package is only done if we are actually running a test involving that package.

If you oppose the changes involving `Maple/Matlab` and others then I do not mind removing them for you. We can keep Gurobi and CPLEX for they are only used by Sage if the user explicitly linked them with it.

> 1. Never use `except:`. Use `except Exception:` or some other specific exception class.


I thought that here it was pretty safe: I do not want this test to ever break, and if there is something wrong with the mathematica/maple/... interface, then other doctests will have to report it.

> 2. Code structure: can we please move all this detect-optional-packages code to a separate function?


I will add a commit.

> 3. Performance: how much time does it take to run all those tests?


Almost nothing, give it a try. That's clearly negligible against the time it takes to run the `sage -b` part of `sage -btp`.

> Note that #13540 has a system for "lazy" checking of optional dependencies


I do not see a need for that given the time it takes to run those tests. Especially, if you want the maple/matlab/others to be removed from the list.

I don't have those non-open-source packages installed. Ideally it should be tested by people *having the packages installed*. And the fact that it takes time than `./sage -b` is irrelevant. I often just do `./sage -tp` without the `./sage -b` when I'm writing doctests.

I mean that CPLEX and Gurobi are not auto-detected from `$PATH` or `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. The corresponding cython modules are only built if those instructions are followed:
http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/thematic_tutorials/linear_programming.html#using-cplex-or-gurobi-through-sage

Thus, I believe that it is safe to assume that if Sage can use CPLEX/Gurobi then it means that the user wants it to be linked with Sage. The situation is different when you install Sage on a machine that already has mathematica installed, for it is automatically detected even though the user may not want to use mathematica from Sage.

If I understood your objections to having automatic tests with mathematica/maple, they do not apply to CPLEX/Gurobi because of this installation procedure.

```
 sage: %time _=DC._default_optional_tags()
 CPU times: user 8 ms, sys: 28 ms, total: 36 ms
 Wall time: 350 ms
```

That's how long you lose. Compare it with the time it takes to doctest control.py (which is not a 'hard' file by any standard)

```
(tmp|…)~/sage/doctest$ time sage -tp control.py
...
sage -tp control.py  2.94s user 0.45s system 74% cpu 4.530 total
```

And of course this become totally negligible if you test several files, a folder, or the whole of Sage.

And that's the only way for us to learn in how many ways such installs can be broken, and act upon it by fixing our interfaces.

Besides, in the case where you really don't have those external softwares installed, checking whether they can be run should be as fast as detecting that the executable cannot be found. So we can also improve that, if we find it too slow.

I would let .version() return -1000 if there is no program available, instead of a separate
function...

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle

Is the doctest controller responsible for third-party interfaces?

E.g. page 34 of http://vitoex.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Read/Clean%20Code.pdf recommends:

"The first rule of functions is that they should be small. The second rule of functions is that
they should be smaller than that. [...] Functions should not be 100 lines long. Functions should hardly ever be 20 lines long."

The other good news for me is that I do not see anything about creating a new file for functions of 20< x < 30 lines.

So it's still up for review.

I think that you are officially splitting hairs.
