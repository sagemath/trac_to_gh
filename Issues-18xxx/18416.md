The power series ring (`sage.rings.power_series_ring.PowerSeriesRing`) inherits from `UniqueRepresentation`. In the argument of the constructor there is the precision (`prec`) but it can be modified! Which leads to wrong behavior

```
sage: R = PowerSeriesRing(QQ, 'x', 3)
sage: R.default_prec()
3
sage: R.set_default_prec(19)
sage: PowerSeriesRing(QQ, 'x', 3).default_prec()
19
```
Moreover, a function can modify a power series in use

```
sage: def haha()
....:     PowerSeriesRing(QQ, 'x').set_default_prec(1)
sage: R = PowerSeriesRing(QQ, 'x')
sage: R.default_prec()
20
sage: haha()
sage: R.default_prec()
1
```

Does anyone know the status of this?

The corresponding behavior for LaurentSeries was deprecated in #16201 (which also mentions power series) and finally removed in #26915 .


So now we are in the situation where PowerSeries and LaurentSeries work quite differently here, I can't see any real reason for this.

Okay, this is tricky: mostly all doctests heavily rely on the `default_prec` syntax, which is actually bad. Either we add after each example where the precision has been changed a

```
sage: set_series_precision(20)  # reset to default
```

or we have to establish each example with the default precision.

At least, this behavior would be expected with the proposed changes, whereas now it is entirely random to the user.

Alternatively, we come up with an entirely different solution. I am open for suggestions.

So, this my first approach. Since the global variable `series_prec` keeps track of the multivariate case too (otherwise one runs into problems with the background power series ring), I set the default to 15, as a compromise for now.

If this meets your approval, we have to think what we should do with the failed doctests.

I know, this is a big change. But the current behavior should not be further promoted either.

For some reason, both the Laurent series ring and power series ring refer to the global series precision in the documentation even though they just use the locally defined default precision

However, effectively, the global series precision is only used in `expression.pyx`.

How do we treat elements of a power series ring with different precision than its parent? I tend to say that the element's precision should be fixed and linked to the parent. But this would change the entire behavior of power series.

Yes, we should deprecate `set_default_prec`.

There is some use for that global variable, that is to ensure consistency across implementations in Sage as it is not exposed to the user. It can also be used by an expert who knows what they are doing.

Then, this needs a change of the current behavior, which is that the element's precision and precision of its parent are independent:

```
sage: R.<x> = PowerSeriesRing(QQ, default_prec=10)
sage: p = R(x, prec=20); p
x + O(x^20)
sage: p.sin()
x - 1/6*x^3 + 1/120*x^5 - 1/5040*x^7 + 1/362880*x^9 - 1/39916800*x^11 + 1/6227020800*x^13 - 1/1307674368000*x^15 + 1/355687428096000*x^17 - 1/121645100408832000*x^19 + O(x^20)
sage: p.sin() in R
True
```
