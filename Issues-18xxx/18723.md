Censorship regimes like a restrictive firewall and force use of a `http_proxy` in order to snoop on their users. 

In this case the direct connection to mirrors will fail, and we cannot time the fastest mirror.

[ Reminder : as you advised, I have edited my .git/config file to use `git@...` (= forcing SSH) addresses for the upstream locations. ]

Mixed results : added on top of 6.7, I have been able to install fricas. My damn "corporate" proxy gave me cold sweats by hanging for about 3 minutes almost at the end of the download. As I am writing this, the (long) compilation proceeds uneventfully.

But ./sage -optional hangs (no error message for > 5 mn==> Ctrl-C). This happents whether I use an `http://...` or a `git@...` address for the "origin" and "trac" upstream address.

I'll wait your feedback before trying to update my 6.7 installation to beta4.

Unless you think that the `sage -optional` is a separate issue, I think that this `needs_work`

Is there something wrong in the way the online list of packages is read? It is done with this line:

```
    f = urllib.urlopen(MIRROR_URL+"/spkg/"+args['category']+"/list")
```
