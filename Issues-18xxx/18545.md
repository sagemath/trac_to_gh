I've been meaning to add something to the documentation for poset display options, so I'm glad to see this ticket already exists. 

Is it really worth creating aliases in the code for slightly modified terminology? Especially since in all the literature I've seen where one wants to assign labels to the covering relations in a poset, they are called 'edge labelings'. It would also have implications for ticket 19396 (if I ever get around to it), which is about adding edge labels as an optional part of the poset data structure.

I was thinking about just having text that says "The poset `plot` method passes to the `plot` method for digraphs (link to Digraph display options), where poset elements are vertices, and covering relations are edges.", and then having a few key examples.

The two key examples that I think definitely need to be in here are for displaying order ideals of a poset (done with P.plot(vertex_colors={'blue':order_ideal}), and showing how to use `vertex_labels` to display linear extensions on the Hasse diagram.

Good point. OTOH we already have `cover_relations()` etc. Hmm...

What about `edge_colors` (or `cover_colors`), what kind of example to do for those? Also an example with more than one additional color would be nice.

OK, added that.

So is `heights`, but 1) `Posets.PentagonPoset().show(heights={0:[0], 1:[2], 2:[1], 3:[3], 4:[4]})` does not really work as you would guess, and `Posets.PentagonPoset().show(layout='circular')`... well, it works but whoever wants that? IMO it is meaningfull only when the user thinks poset as a Hasse diagram, and then he/she can use `.hasse_diagram()` first.
