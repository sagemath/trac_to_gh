Affine weight lattices have a method called symmetric_form which implements the symmetric bilinear form on the weight lattice (or weight space) used extensively in representation theory. See Kac, *Infinite-dimensional Lie algebras* Chapter 2. It is an inner product, that is, a pairing of the space with itself. Here are some examples where it doesn't work right unless you coerce the root into the weight lattice.

```
sage: RS = RootSystem(['A',2,1])
sage: P = RS.weight_lattice(extended=true)
sage: Q = RS.root_lattice()
sage: alpha = Q.simple_roots()
sage: alphacheck = Q.simple_coroots()
sage: omega = P.fundamental_weights()
sage: [alpha[1].symmetric_form(omega[i]) for i in [0,1,2]]
[-1, 2, -1]
sage: [alpha[1].symmetric_form(alphacheck[i]) for i in [0,1,2]]
[-1, 2, -1]
sage: [P(alpha[1]).symmetric_form(alphacheck[i]) for i in [0,1,2]]
[0, 1, 0]
sage: [P(alpha[1]).symmetric_form(omega[i]) for i in [0,1,2]]
[0, 1, 0]
```

The first three answers are (in my opinion) wrong for the following reasons.
The last answer is correct. The first one is therefore wrong since
the symmetric form should not depend on whether alpha is regarded as
an element of Q or of P. The second two pairings should be undefined since
alphacheck cannot be coerced into P.

The pairing self.scalar(other) can be used to pair roots with coroots. The
pairing self.symmetric_form(other) should then be defined for elements
of the same space.

This seem to be wrong also in a different way for type ['B',3,1]. The following is
essentially correct behavior:

```
sage: RS = RootSystem(['B',3,1])
sage: Q = RS.root_lattice()
sage: P = RS.weight_lattice(extended=true)
sage: Matrix([[a.symmetric_form(b) for a in Q.simple_roots()] for b in Q.simple_roots()])
[ 4  0 -2  0]
[ 0  4 -2  0]
[-2 -2  4 -2]
[ 0  0 -2  2]
sage: RS.cartan_matrix()
[ 2  0 -1  0]
[ 0  2 -1  0]
[-1 -1  2 -1]
[ 0  0 -2  2]
```
The symmetric form is twice the symmetric form defined by Kac (Infinite-Dimensional Lie Algebras, third edition, (6.2.2) on page 81). The doubling is harmless for applications. So far so good.

But the fundamental weights should be dual to the roots.

```
sage: Matrix([[a.symmetric_form(b) for a in Q.simple_roots()] for b in P.fundamental_weights()])
[ 4  0 -2  0]
[ 0  4 -2  0]
[-2 -2  4 -2]
[ 0  0 -2  2]
```
For type A we can fix this by coercing a into P (as shown above). But for type B this doesn't seem to work:

```
age: Matrix([[P(a).symmetric_form(b) for a in Q.simple_roots()] for b in P.fundamental_weights()]) 
[ 1  0  0  0]
[-1  2  0  0]
[-2  0  2  0]
[-1  0  0  1]
```
I think this should be a diagonal matrix. It almost is, except the first column. 
 
For affine Cartan types, the symmetric form works correctly as a pairing of the root lattice Q with itself. It is defined as a pairing of the extended weight lattice p with itself, or of P with Q. These pairings should be the same, that is, coercing from Q to P should not affect the result, but it does. For type A, we can get accurate results by pairing the weight lattice with itself, so if we wish to pair an element of Q with an element of P, we coerce the element of Q into P, and then the pairing gives the right result. But this doesn't work with Type B.

Yes. We do have another pairing `self.scalar(other)` which I think we use for the pairing with the dual space.

> Or should we use the av = 2 a / (a, a) identification to do the pairing? 


I think the answer is no, since this will blow up on imaginary roots where e.g. `(delta|delta)=0`.

Yes, if we coerce elements of the root lattice into the weight lattice to compute the symmetric form I think this will give the right answer.
