I have no idea what is going on.

```
sage: F.<omega> = NumberField(x^2+x+1)
sage: xx = polygen(F)
sage: ABs = []
sage: ps = [p for p, _ in F(7).factor()]
sage: for mu in ps:
    K = F.extension(xx^3 - mu, 'alpha')
    print K.defining_polynomial().roots(K)
sage: for mu in ps:
    K = F.extension(xx^3 - mu, 'alpha')
    print K.defining_polynomial().roots(K)

[(alpha, 1), ((-omega - 1)*alpha, 1), (omega*alpha, 1)]
[(alpha, 1), (omega*alpha, 1), ((-omega - 1)*alpha, 1)]
[]
[(alpha, 1), (omega*alpha, 1), ((-omega - 1)*alpha, 1)]
```

So, that's weird. But it gets worse! First do this

```
sage: fbar = xx^3 - ps[0]
sage: Kbar = F.extension(fbar, 'alpha')
sage: fbar.roots(Kbar)
[]
```

Okay, but then do fbar.roots?? to see the source code, then press 'q' to exit that, then

```
sage: fbar.roots(Kbar)
[(alpha, 1), ((-omega - 1)*alpha, 1), (omega*alpha, 1)]
```

Huh?

(I'm doing this is sage 6.7 on the cloud.)

It seems this is caused by the `PolynomialRing` constructor not distinguishing between relative number fields with different defining polynomials, but with the same *absolute* polynomials and the same variable names:

```
sage: F.<omega> = NumberField(x^2 + x + 1)
sage: y = polygen(F)
sage: K = F.extension(y^3 + 3*omega + 2, 'alpha')
sage: L = F.extension(y^3 - 3*omega - 1, 'alpha')
sage: K is L
False
sage: K.absolute_polynomial() == L.absolute_polynomial()
True
sage: K['x'] is L['x']
True
```
I found this ticket via [this sage-nt discussion](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-nt/NM7bbCgefdo) and suspect the above problem is the cause of both bugs.

In fact, in the above example we have

```
sage: K == L
True
```
which causes a cache lookup in `PolynomialRing` to return `K['x']` when given `L` as input.

We should probably make number fields satisfy `K == L` if and only if `K is L`, i.e. make them inherit from `WithEqualityById`.  Doing this in the most naive way unfortunately leads to a number of doctest failures.

I like this theory, but it seems like it would be more consistent with this output:

```
[(alpha, 1), ((-omega - 1)*alpha, 1), (omega*alpha, 1)]
[]
[(alpha, 1), ((-omega - 1)*alpha, 1), (omega*alpha, 1)]
[]
```
where the polynomial ring gets created once and then never changes. Fortunately (?), this actually is the output that I get trying this on two different machines running 7.1, starting from an empty session, and on SMC, currently running 6.10. This behavior appears to be reproducible.

However, I tried a development build I have on SMC (version 7.2beta6), again from an empty session:

```
[(alpha, 1), ((-omega - 1)*alpha, 1), (omega*alpha, 1)]
[(alpha, 1), (omega*alpha, 1), ((-omega - 1)*alpha, 1)]
[(alpha, 1), ((-omega - 1)*alpha, 1), (omega*alpha, 1)]
[]
```
This also appears to be reproducible.

In this example, we also have:

```
sage: hash(K) == hash(L)
True
```
which is presumably why `PolynomialRing` is fooled. Digging into `src/sage/rings/number_field/number_field.py`:

```
   def __hash__(self):
        r"""
        Compute the hash value of this number field.

        TESTS:

        Since there is a custom implementation of :meth:`__cmp`, we need a
        custom ``__hash__``. The number fields ``K`` and ``L`` in the following
        example used to have different hashes prior to :trac:`11670`::

            sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
            sage: R.<y> = QQ[]
            sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2+1)
            sage: L.<a> = NumberField(y^2+1)
            sage: K == L
            True
            sage: hash(K) == hash(L)
            True

        """
        return hash((self.variable_name(), self.base_field(), tuple(self.__polynomial)))
```
It appears that `self.__polynomial` is the absolute defining polynomial, not the relative one. I'm guessing this was done on purpose to fix some other problem, judging from this byline:

```
- Julian Rueth (2014-04-03): absolute number fields are unique parents
```
It might be worth trying to replace `self.__polynomial` with something like `self.relative_polynomial()` to see how much doctest breakage results.

Several comments:
- Changing `__hash__` is not enough; you also have to update `__cmp__` to be compatible with it.  Python (and Sage) objects are supposed to satisfy the implication `x == y` ==> `hash(x) == hash(y)`.  Otherwise things like the cache lookup in [comment:2](#comment%3A2) will give undesired results if there is a hash collision.
- In particular, the output of `K == L` in the first doctest should be `False`.
- There is no reason to introduce a new attribute `__relative_polynomial`.  Since `relative_polynomial()` simply returns an existing attribute, you can just do

```
return hash((self.variable_name(), self.base_field(), tuple(self.relative_polynomial())))
```
- An indented block should always be indented by 4 spaces relative to the previous line; in some of the doctests there are only 3 spaces.
- It is not very useful to have a doctest whose output consists of dozens of lines `True`; it is cleaner to replace `print(elt.is_integral)` by `assert(elt.is_integral)`.
