There is currently a `prime_range` function in `sage.rings.fast_arith` which return a list of prime in a given range `{0, ..., n-1}` and a function `primes` in `sage.rings.arith` which return an iterator.

We should have only one entry point and the answer would better be an iterator.

I found this ticket and the next one, and wonder if they are going to be worked on?

My current beef is that the docstring for primes is wrong.  The only argument with no default is "start" and it says that this is a lower bound (as the name suggests) but in fact it is an upper bound unless "stop" is also set!  ALso there is no way at present (I think) to get an open-ended iterator with only one parameter, you have to use primes(2,infinity).  You can also use Primes() as in "for p in Primes(): ..." but I have no idea how efficient that is.

I don't get what Vincent intends to do.  Merge both functions into a single one (with an even more complicated interface)?

Both have pretty different applications, and the functions' docstrings refer to each other.

In the long run, we could of course implement something better...
