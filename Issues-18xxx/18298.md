There is currently a `prime_range` function in `sage.rings.fast_arith` which return a list of prime in a given range `{0, ..., n-1}` and a function `primes` in `sage.rings.arith` which return an iterator.

We should have only one entry point and the answer would better be an iterator.

I don't get what Vincent intends to do.  Merge both functions into a single one (with an even more complicated interface)?

Both have pretty different applications, and the functions' docstrings refer to each other.

\\

In the long run, we could of course implement something better...
