So i see you are switching to only using `data_files` and the only headers to be considered are those found in `SAGE_CYTHONIZED` which makes sense as all the useful headers will be copied. 

Is the issue only happening when one does an upgrade or a re-build where as your commit suggest we may have obsolete `.pxd`, `.pyx` or `.h` files being kept while they should have been deleted?

Yes, if we delete a `.pxd` file from the sources, it should also be deleted from the installation directory.
