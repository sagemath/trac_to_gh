It is more logical for a user to think "What can I do with this poset?" than "What functions are defined in this file?". This is a suggestion to add `is_selfdual` and `is_lattice` to index of functions in `posets.py`.

Sidenote, we do have index in `lattices.py` now: #18489.

I asked about moving functions about a year ago. There was some reasons for not doing it.

I think that everyone using lattices will know that a lattice is a poset, and so can find the functions. This is totally different in this case: plain mathematical knowledge can not reveal at all that some functions are available but from another file.

(There is a real corner case: Student playing with groups may not know what is magma or semigroup. In principle there should be no `.is_abelian()` (or something like that) directly on groups. It should be inherited from magmas. But that might be a problem from documentation point of view.)

This has been discussed on sage-devel. I did not understood all of it, but in any case there will be functions in two places.

Can be done. However, there is BIG difference here: it needs "only" mathematical knowledge to know that a lattice is a poset, but it needs knowledge of Sage internals to know that more functions may be found on categories.

But this is another story and does not belong to this patch.

Already lowering ticket counter with #19023.

I think that the point of this ticket is not about those two lines. It is the discussion about how to enhance documentation of the software.

I would say "reject" to leaving things as they are. This patch is my suggestion one. Suggestion two is to add index to category of posets, add index to category of finite posets, and link them at the beginning of index of finite posets. Suggestion three is to make a new page that contains index of poset functions and a short introduction to posets in Sage. All these suggestions assumes that the code itself will not be refactored.

OTOH if I make a big but simple patch of doctrings, it will take a year to write, will needs rebasing ten times, and may never get positive_review.)

Move the two functions from categories to posets.py and the problem is solved. I don't see the added value of having those two lone functions in another file, where nobody will find them. Move them to `posets.py` and they can obviously be added to the doc.

We could start getting rid of those big index, and of the duplication of [1) the description of the function that follows the name of the function in the index 2) the first line of the docstring of a function] by using #18926.

Once this is done, the individual modifications do not need to be rebased as often, for the parts of code that get modified are not all located in the index: only the individual docstrings need be modified, and git has less problems with that.

> Move the two functions from categories to posets.py and the problem is solved. I don't see the added value of having those two lone functions in another file, where nobody will find them. Move them to `posets.py` and they can obviously be added to the doc.


That would be my suggestion number zero. But I wrote about that on sage-devel, and was clearly rejected. (And this is not only about two function, see for example `is_antichain_of_poset()`. -- it does not help if you look only the category of *finite* posets.)

> We could start getting rid of those big index, and of the duplication of [1) the description of the function that follows the name of the function in the index 2) the first line of the docstring of a function] by using #18926.


The fact that #18926 is a great improvement (thanks!) does not mean that it will make documentation good. Good index is arranged by topic. And actually I have used a little different phrasing in the index compared to function.

Is "Clearly rejected" the difference between my "I don't like it, so I will not review it" and somebody else's "I don't like it, so you must not do it"?

I still don't know what there is to reject. There was a Poset class with everything inside, then somebody created a Poset category and suddenly it magically becomes "the best place" to store code, even though there is nothing in there.

I don't know. There was some explanation, of which I think I didn't understood all.

I see. Well, if you ever want to move two functions back to the Poset class, just add me in Cc.

You can disable it, too.

If it makes sense, we could even update the code so that it can take as argument a list of functions "with label", group the functions according to the lablels and build the corresponding tables. Should take 10 lines at most.
