For now, every family of linear code (eg: Hamming code) is a method which returns a `LinearCode` object. It would be nice to change this: every family of code should be an object.
Besides, every linear codes needs to know its generator matrix to be constructed. This is fine for linear codes without a specific algebraic structure, but not for sub-families of linear codes.
For instance, it is possible to encode & decode words in Reed-Solomon codes without the help of a generator matrix. With regards to this, the user should be free to build the generator matrix for sub-families of code (which can be both a time- and memory-consuming operation).
This is also true for the dimension of a code (which can be long to compute for some sub-families).

However, some parameters (like the length of the code, or its base field) are mandatory to every linear code, and subfamilies. They need to work fine with the category framework as well.

We then propose the following design:

implement an abstract class , `AbstractLinearCode`, which will initialize parameters used in every linear code, and make linear codes properly interact as modules in the category framework in its constructor. Besides, as all methods that were previously in linear codes need to work for all subfamilies of codes, we propose to relocate them as methods of `AbtractLinearCode`. With this design, every linear code and subfamily will only need to inherit from this abstract class to get all the generic methods and parameters initialized.

Besides, linear codes get their `base_ring` method from their category. For better consistency, we propose to implement a `base_field()` method which will be specific to linear codes.

Helloooooooooooooooooooo !

Several comments:

- I do not understand why you created a specific function `_init_linear_code`
  instead of writing what you need in the `__init__` function. In particular the
  names `__init__` and `_init_linear_code` do not indicate how their aims are
  different.
  - If you want to change the name of the function, could it mention categories
    explicitly? (Or is there a reason not to?)
  - If you decide to remove this function, please move the doctests that it
    contains to the `__init__` method.
- You say in the ticket's description that you add a `base_ring` method while
  you implement `base_field`. What is the correct version?
- I do not understand why you implement this function while saying that it is
  'inherited'.
  - If it is inherited, why do you need to implement it?
  - If it is *not* inherited, then shouldn't we fix that instead of
    implementing the function?

- We usually type '::' at the end of the line. Is there any reason why you write
  your code this way?

  ```
  We now create a member of our newly made class
  ::
  ```

  Note that writing `our newly made class::` will appear in the HTML as 
  `our newly made class:` (only one ':'). If you do not want to see
  this terminal ':' then a space is sufficient, e.g.: `This sentence ends here. ::`

Okay then!

I changed the structure of the file: we now have an `AbstractLinearCode` class which has all methods that was previously in `LinearCode`. 
`LinearCode` now inherits from this new abstract class (and gets all its former methods that way). I fixed the `::` stuff too.

Helloooooooooooooooooooooo,

Several comments:

- (superficial) The way you moved code around makes the commit much more
  difficult to read than it should. It is a good thing to quickly read the
  commits before you push them, as usually the reviewer has to
  "reverse-engineer" what you want to do from the diff file. If you are forced
  to move code around, it is better to do so in a specific commit which *only*
  moves the code without changing anything in it.

  As a reviewer, we have to make sure that all changes are correct, and as
  moving code around appears to us as 1) remove the code 2) add the code we have
  to re-read and check all of it, even if it was a no-brainer change on your
  side.

- I changed your toy example a bit so that the matrix is given as argument. I
  hope that you will not mind.

- While modifying `minimum_distance()` and `gens()` you interfered with its
  caching mechanism: answers which used to be cached are now forgotten. Could
  you fix that?

- The doctest you wrote for the abstract class takes a lot of time, and we try
  to not go over a couple of seconds if we can avoid it (even for long ones). As
  this one does not test a very fundamental feature, could you make it a bit
  faster by changing the figures?

Thanks,

I added a small commit at public/18099. The usual procedure is that, as I
reviewed your changes, you can be the reviewer of mine. In particular, feel free
to discuss/oppose any of the changes.

Nathann

Not at all. I kept it in the new version of the code.

Done. These methods are now cached.

Sure. Considering I picked some random methods to illustrate the inheritance mechanism with a dummy class, I just replaced it by something faster.

Hello,

I just had a quick look.

1. What is the point of having two classes `AbstractLinearCode` and `LinearCode`. I would naturally name `LinearCode` the one from which I need to inherit from. Why not `LinearCode` and `LinearCode_generic` instead?

2. Why the ambient vector space is not part of the input of `AbstractLinearCode`?

3. What is the difference between `base_ring` provided by the Module and `base_field`?

4. Coud you include in the docstring of the former `AbstractLinearCode`:
   - the set of attributes that are provided by the class
   - what should be done to implement a linar code when inheriting from it

   In particular, some methods of `AbstractLinearCode` assume the presence of the attribute `._generator_matrix` (like `__cmp__`).

5. Could you remove

```
+ # sage: C.minimum_distance_upper_bound() # optional (net connection)
+ # 3
+ # sage: C.minimum_distance_why() # optional (net connection)
+ # Ub(7,4) = 3 follows by the Griesmer bound.
```

6. In the docstring of `AbstractLinearCode` replace `from this abstract method.` with `from this abstract class.`.

Vincent

It is meant to represent a linear code *defined* from a matrix. On the other hand, they will have some code which will *not* be defined from a matrix [2]. Thus, I thought that it made sense to have a class defining methods which apply to all kinds of codes in some astract class (I don't care much what the name of that class is).\n\nNathann\n\nP.S.: As usual, when we discuss things \"live\", important information is left out from the ticket's comments.\n\n[1] At user level, I don't see anything wrong with having it aliased as \"LinearCode\", as it is the easiest way for users to define a code.\n\n[2] Like Reed-Solomon codes.

Hello,

> 1. What is the point of having two classes `AbstractLinearCode` and `LinearCode`. I would naturally name `LinearCode` the one from which I need to inherit from. Why not `LinearCode` and `LinearCode_generic` instead?

I am not sure that I totally understand your question, but I may be able to help a bit.

The class which is currently named "LinearCode" should (to me) be named "LinearCodeFromMatrix" in the code [1]. It is meant to represent a linear code *defined* from a matrix. On the other hand, they will have some code which will *not* be defined from a matrix [2]. Thus, I thought that it made sense to have a class defining methods which apply to all kinds of codes in some astract class (I don't care much what the name of that class is).

Nathann

P.S.: As usual, when we discuss things "live", important information is left out from the ticket's comments.

[1] At user level, I don't see anything wrong with having it aliased as "LinearCode", as it is the easiest way for users to define a code.

[2] Like Reed-Solomon codes. They apparently have better ways to compute things than to work on a matrix.

Hello,

I updated the description of the ticket.

Regarding the naming problem : from the programmer's point of view, having a class named `AbstractSomething` makes sense (in my humble opinion) with regards to inheritance. Usually, if you see an abstract class of `something` you know that you need to inherit from this class when it comes to the implementation of `something` (or its subfamilies). 

Regarding the name of what we call `LinearCode`, we think it's the right name for coding theorists. `LinearCode_generic` is not really clear. I'd prefer to avoid this idea of using aliases, but if you tell me it's a more Sage-consistent naming scheme, I'll take it.

>Why the ambient vector space is not part of the input of AbstractLinearCode?

It is actually implied by the parameters: the ambient space is a vectorial space over the base field of the code and of dimension the length of the code. `base_field` and `length` are the two parameters in our abstract class constructor, so every code knows its ambient space. Having both `bsae_field`, `length` and `ambient_space` as class parameters is redundant. We chose to pick `length` and `base_field` (and thus build the ambient space from these parameters) but the inverse could make sense too. It's really a matter of taste here `:)`

>What is the difference between base_ring provided by the Module and base_field? 

We noticed that some classes in Sage (like for instance `VectorSpace`) have both `base_ring` and `base_field` methods implemented, the former coming from the category framework and the latter specifically made for the class, both returning the same result. We chose to follow that because we thought it was consistent with Sage to do so. If it's not, I can remove the `base_field` method!

>Coud you include in the docstring of the former AbstractLinearCode:
>the set of attributes that are provided by the class
>what should be done to implement a linar code when inheriting from it 
>

Sure, I'll do that. Thanks for noticing that in `__cmp__`, because it should not directly call the class parameter anymore but use the method `generator_matrix()` instead. My mistake.

>Could you remove

There is some commented lines in the files of the coding part of Sage, along with some algorithms that could be more efficient. We definitely want to clean up the whole coding library, which means:
- remove all these commented lines
- remove some deprecation warnings which are more than one year old
- enhance some algorithms and methods

If you agree, we would prefer to focus on integrated our new functionnalities into Sage for now, and once it is done clean up all the coding library based on what we noticed while working on the existing code, and on the new input we might get.

For vector space, you have

```
def base_field(self):
    ...
    return self.base_ring()
```
(see line 5144 of `sage/modules/free_module.py`). Why would you dupliacte the attribute in your class `LinearCode`? Note that I have nothing against a **method** `base_field` but you should get rid of the **attribute** `_base_field`.

Actually, one thing that I would find more natural is to inherit from `FreeModule_submodule_field` (from `sage.modules.free_module`) instead of simply `Module`.

All right


Next:

- It is very wrong to set

```
Element = type(facade_for).an_element()
```
  The thing is that in the category mechanism, `Element` is just here to produce the attribute `_element_class` which is then used as the class for elements. Except in the case where the class is an extension class (i.e. a Cython class) those two classes are different. Moreover, if at some point you implement a `LinearCode` which is not a facade, you will need to set an attribute `Element` to it. In the current state, this attribute would be overriden in the `__init__` by mentioned line.

- This badly fails

```
sage: sage.coding.linear_code.AbstractLinearCode(GF(3),2)
<repr(<sage.coding.linear_code.AbstractLinearCode_with_category at 0x7f6867c61890>) failed: AttributeError: 'AbstractLinearCode_with_category' object has no attribute '_generator_matrix'>
```
  One way is to provide a generic is just to move the `_repr_` in `LinearCode` to `AbstractLinearCode`.

- the method `AbstractLinearCode.generator_matrix` is implemented as `return self._generator_matrix`. Why not

```
def generator_matrix(self):
    raise NotImplementedError("This method must be set in subclasses")
```
  That way, the programmer knows where there is something wrong when he implements a new code. Another way to do is to use the decorator `@abstract_method` from `sage.misc.abstract_method`.

- In the docstring of the class, you forgot to mention that the method `generator_matrix` must be implemented in subclasses.

- the `NOTE::` section in the docstring should be a `.. NOTE::` section. Moreover, the lines are too large here (>110 characters and should be around 80).

- the method `zero` is badly implemented. Instead, just do (without caching)

```
def zero(self):
    return self.ambient_space().zero()
```
  Or if you really care about the non-facade cases

```
def zero(self):
    if self.facade_for():
        return self(0)
    else:
        return self.ambient_space().zero()
```

- Why did you set `gens` as a `cached_method`? Why do you check for a `_gen` attribute there? If you have an attribute `_gen` at some point the `cached_method` feature will just duplicate the fact that you already have an attribute that takes care of caching!!

- In the constructor, don't you want to check that the argument `base_field` provided is actually a finite field? An easy way is

```
    if not base_field in Fields().Finite():
        raise ValueError("base_field (={}) must be a finite field".format(base_field))
```
  the argument `length` should also be checked and converted to the type you want to use (I guess either a Python `int` or a Sage `Integer`).

Enough for now...

Hi Vincent

It's awesome that you're being so thorough and giving feedback, but I think you're asking for too many things in this ticket. There's many things wrong with the current code, but for this ticket, we're not trying to fix it all. I'll reply to your comments below.

Ok, we'll go with the abstract class then.

This implementation of `base_field` is indeed better, and we can kill `_base_field`.

We didn't write this facade code; it's from #16644. We're not sufficiently
familiar with the category framework to judge whether it's sensible or not. If
it is not good as you say, it should of course be fixed, but I suggest doing
that in another ticket since it implies various other cleanup (e.g.
`__contains__` and `ambient_space` as you mention). I therefore suggest adding
`base_field` with the simple implementation above -- to fix the interface in
this ticket - and then create a new ticket to fix the category stuff (which I
hope you can further help us with).

It's supposed to fail: it's an abstract class, so you shouldn't instantiate it.

>   One way is to provide a generic is just to move the `_repr_` in `LinearCode` to `AbstractLinearCode`.

The usual `_repr_` should be in `LinearCode`, and I don't see a reason for defining `AbstractLinearCode._repr_`. I guess it could possibly be flagged with `@abstract_method` but that's largely a matter of taste. In this instance, I don't find it integral to the functionality of sub-classes that they have a `_repr_`, and `@abstract_method` is intended for flagging only essential-to-override methods.

The current implementation should indeed be in `LinearCode`. In `AbstractLinearCode` it should raise a `NotImplementedError`, though not with the message you suggest: mathematically, every linear code has a generator matrix (it has many), but from a programming point of view, one should not be forced to implement it for every code class.

We made this mistake in the current code because we're introducing a generic way to handle encoders in a ticket coming up. Encoders are linked to generator matrices, and this framework will override `AbstractLinearCode.generator_matrix` with a method which asks the "default" encoder for the generator matrix. In this sense, `AbstractLinearCode.generator_matrix` becomes a convenience function, and more or less no sub-class will ever need to override it.

> 
> - In the docstring of the class, you forgot to mention that the method `generator_matrix` must be implemented in subclasses.

Subclasses don't need to. (sure, lot's of functions in `AbstractLinearCode` will throw a `NotImplementedError` with the above default implementation of `generator_matrix`, but that's ok.)

>

Ok. On a side-note, is the 80-character wrap really enforced everywhere? IMHO, it is archaic and very impractical to enforce, especially for doc-tests.

Lot's of stuff is badly implemented (and we know). But it's not the job of this ticket to fix everything in `linear_code.py`.

You're right, `@cached_method` should be removed.

Note that such a check wasn't there before either (matrices can be over rings
too). But the check makes sense so we can add it. Probably `length` should be
cast to Python `int`, and then cast to `Integer` in the `def length()` method.

No problem. I am just saying what I found wrong while reading the code. You are free to say "this is not for this ticket". But keep my remarks under your pillow for the next tickets.

You somehow ignore my most important request: inheritance from `FreeModule_submodule_field`. That would avoid implementing plenty of useless stuff like `__contains__`, `cardinality`, `__iter__` and so on.

What happens if you just get rid of that line? Category is a driven by error experimentation ;-)

On the other hand the implementation uses the attribute `_generator_matrix`. Perhaps, you could just remove this `_repr_` in `AbstractLinearCode`.

The thing is that many methods in `AbstractLinearCode` will just fail if you do not implement the method `generator_matrix` (like `gens`, `__iter__`, `information_set`, `is_permutation_automorphism`, `is_permutation_equivalent`, ...). I agree that there are many generating matrices, but in order to define properly your subspace you need to tell Sage at least one. Perhaps not through the method `generating_matrix` though. This is of course related to the inheritance from `FreeModule_submodule_field`.

I am not familiar with encoders (nor code theory by the way ;-).

It is not strictly requested. But the two dots before `NOTE` are.

That is great work to clean all of this... a bit tedious but definitely needed!

Hello,

Here is what I did:

- as Vincent suggested, `generator_matrix()` is now an abstract method (returns `NotYetImplemented`) in `AbstractLinearCode`. I set an implementation of it in `LinearCode`, and I changed the docstring of the abstract class accordingly.

- as 

```
self.Element = type(facade_for.an_element())
```
  seemed harmless to removed (tested with the `TestSuite().run` method presented in the category tutorial) I killed it.

- I actually removed `_gens` parameter from `LinearCode` and removed the related part in `gens()` method, so duplicated cache anymore.

- However, I did not inherit from `FreeModule_submodule_field` because as far as I understand, it forces us to set the generator matrix as a class attribute, which is something we really do not want to do.

Hi Vincent and David,

I was not clear enough earlier, it seems. What I meant about the category stuff
was that I don't think we should touch it in this ticket at all (not even
removing the `self.Element = ...` thing. I for one have no idea what it might or
might not break). It is a different kettle of fish and would require cleanup
of several functions, etc. Also, as David mentions, it is really important for
us that the generator matrix is not explicitly calculated except when asked for
(possibly indirectly) by the user. If inheriting `FreeModule_submodule_field`
would require us to explicitly calculate the generator matrix, I down-vote that
solution. This whole discussion needs to be thought through properly in another ticket.

Relatedly, I find it perfectly acceptable that lots of functionality breaks in
subclasses of `AbstractLinearCode` if those subclasses don't override
`generator_matrix`; after all, those methods are default implementations which
can and should be overridden in many cases. That being said, most code families
*will* usually have a generator matrix implementation (based on encoders, after
our future ticket on the matter).

David, you forgot to mention that you also fixed the `NOTE` thing, removed the
`_repr_`, and reimplemented `base_field()` as suggested. I updated the
doc-string for `AbstractLinearCode` with some small stuff, and I changed the error message in `AbstractLinearCode.generator_matrix`.

While doing so, I noticed the following: `__cmp__` and `__eq__` now breaks for
`AbstractLinearCode` since they use `generator_matrix` which is not defined.
That's of course unavoidable if the definition of code equality is that they
describe the same sub-space. We have had a discussion on what comparison
semantics makes most sense for linear codes, and we should bring this to Trac
soon. Our consesus was that it should mean equality of sub-spaces. In this case, the `NOTE` in `AbstractLinearCode` should be removed. However, that's for later, I guess.

David, will you create a ticket for fixing up the category stuff, so we don't forget?

Best,
Johan

All right. Then, I do not understand why there are so much methods in `AbstractLinearCode`. If most of them need the `generator_matrix` why not put them in your current `LinearCode` class? I really do not like the fact that most methods of `AbstractLinearCode` just reimplement the logic of `FreeModule_submodule_field` using `generator_matrix`.

I would be happy if you briefly explain your reasons to avoid the construction of one generator matrix in the constructor.

A generator matrix is not mandatory to perform operations of subfamilies of liner codes.

Hello,

There still are trailing whitespaces!

What do you want to do with `LinearCode` in the future? Will it dispatch into subclasses. If not, you should add a comment about the implementation (telling that everything is computed from the `generator_matrix`).

In your children classes of `AbstractLinearCode`, will your elements always be vectors in a vector space? You talked about polynomials. Will polynomials be valid elements for some code or you will handle a conversion between them?

Vincent

Hi Vincent

> What do you want to do with `LinearCode` in the future? Will it dispatch into subclasses.

It is quite likely that `LinearCode` is a "final" class. I see little reason why one would sub-class it.

> If not, you should add a comment about the implementation (telling that everything is computed from the `generator_matrix`).

Clearly that is implied by the fact that the generator matrix given as input to the constructor is **all** the information that the object has. The `LinearCode` could compute stuff from nothing else.

> In your children classes of `AbstractLinearCode`, will your elements always be vectors in a vector space? You talked about polynomials. Will polynomials be valid elements for some code or you will handle a conversion between them?

All `AbstractLinearCode`s will be subspaces of `GF(q)^n`, so yes, its elements will always be vectors over some field. Usually, one talks of an "encoding" which is a bijection between the code and some other space called "the message space". The latter space is usually `GF(q)^k` where `k` is the dimension of the code, and the "encoding" bijection can be described by a linear mapping using a matrix. But it could also (for e.g. Reed-Solomon codes) be a `k`-dimensional space of polynomials.

We will handle this - in a later ticket - using a light-weight system of `Encoder` objects.

Best,
Johan

Hi Vincent and David,

Actually, having reflected about it I think I now get Vincent's point on generator matrices. Perhaps the doc for the class `LinearCode` could be improved to something like

    Linear codes over a finite field or finite ring, represented using a
    generator matrix.

    This class should be used for arbitrary and unstructured linear codes. This
    means that basic operations on the code, such as the computation of the
    minimum distance, will use generic, slow algorithms.

    If you are looking for constructing a code from a more specific family, see
    if the family has been implemented by investigating `codes.<tab>`. These
    more specific classes use properties particular for that family to allow
    faster algorithms, and could also have family-specific methods.
