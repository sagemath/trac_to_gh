Namely we return the basis as a family of generators.

Without patch:

```
sage: D4 = DescentAlgebra(QQ, 4).B()
sage: D4.algebra_generators()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
[...]
TypeError: 'NotImplementedType' object is not callable
```

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: P = PartitionAlgebra(1, x, R)
sage: P.algebra_generators()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
[..]
Error: 'NotImplementedType' object is not callable
```

With patch:

```
sage: D4 = DescentAlgebra(QQ, 4).B()
sage: D4.algebra_generators()
Lazy family (Term map from Compositions of 4 to Descent algebra of 4 over Rational Field in the subset basis(i))_{i in Compositions of 4}
```

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: P = PartitionAlgebra(1, x, R)
sage: P.algebra_generators()
Finite family {{{-1, 1}}: P[{{-1, 1}}], {{-1}, {1}}: P[{{-1}, {1}}]}
```

It does not override specific class methods:

```
sage: A4 = SymmetricGroup(4).algebra(QQ)
sage: A4 in AlgebrasWithBasis(QQ)
True
sage: A4.algebra_generators()
Family ((1,2), (1,2,3,4))
```

Umm is it a "bug" from Algebras.Quotients ? Here is the line to get the algebra generators of the quotient:

```
return self.ambient().algebra_generators().map(self.retract)
```
and we get generators that are `0`...

But this methods should have been called instead of the newly implemented one, am I missing something ?

We were lucky that the old one did not work so that this got noticed!
