This ticket is a duplication of #12715.

Currently, the default coerce embedding uses RLF/CLF but heavily relies on AA/QQbar. It is bad for several reasons:
- there is no coercion from RLF/CLF to AA/QQbar
- equality and comparisons in RLF are completely broken (because it relies on finite approximations)

```
sage: K.<cbrt3> = NumberField(x^3 - 3, embedding=1)
sage: b=(1+RLF(cbrt3))/2
sage: c=1/2 + 3/2*(RLF(cbrt3)/3)
sage: b == c
False
```

In this ticket:
- we get rid of RLF/CLF for number field embeddings and use AA/QQbar instead
- we make the interaction between AA and number fields more friendly
- we speed up a lot the approximations of number field elements using Cython

In a ticket #18104, we will consider number fields with complex embeddings.

It is (of #12715). Could you close it?

I will add some details in #12715 (I have an implementation which works except for cyclotomic fields).
