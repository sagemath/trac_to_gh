```
Currently:

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: x^(1/2)
1
```

I correct to

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: x^(1/2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: non-integral exponents not supported
```

that is consistent with the results in other polynomial rings.

Keywords: integer polynomials, exponentiation

<a id='comment:3'></a>Salut Bruno,

1. You introduced trailing whitespaces, please remove them.

2. Why would you want to do that

```
try:
    nn = PyNumber_AsSsize_t (exp, OverflowError)
except TypeError:
   raise TypeError("non-integral exponents not supported")
```
  the problem comes from the fact that you can cast rationals to Python int

```
sage: int(2/3)
0
```
  I would very much prefer

```
cdef long u = exp
if exp != u:
    raise TypeError("...")
```

Vincent
