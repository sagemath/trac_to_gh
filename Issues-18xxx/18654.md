Now I understand what you mean.

That's clearly not a bug. If you do

```
Q=0
Q.reduce(G)
```
then Q is an Integer. When you do `Q.reduce`, you will find that an integer has no reduce method. The reduce method is for free algebra elements, and integers is something totally different. That's how object oriented programming languages such as Python work.

<div id="comment:2" align="right">Comment 2</div>

As you have shown in the ticket description, the zero element in the free algebra can be reduced. The INTEGER zero element has nothing to do with free algebras, hence, reduction can not be provided.
