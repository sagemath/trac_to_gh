Right now PolyBoRi relies on scons (which is still Python 2 only), and has some Python 2 specific syntax in its bindings. These issues will need to be resolved before Sage can support Python 3.

On this ticket we update to the first version of BRiAl which includes a new (incomplete, but sufficient for our purposes) autotools based system.

To achieve this, we fork upstream `polybori`, see [https://github.com/BRiAl/BRiAl](https://github.com/BRiAl/BRiAl)

I also don't know how we should handle this with regards to upstream, since upstream is dead. I certainly don't want to take over maintenance for polybori, but we'll probably need to make some sort of fork.

I think there are two separate issues:
 1) polybori is using a internal copy of a third party package that may not be dead upstream (I think it has updates once in a while): cudd.
 2) the python bindings

We could package the libraries properly and then have a separate python binding package, unless `polybori` is altering its upstream significantly beyond the build system. The python binding could be moved in sage making it "a collective" responsibility.

Polybori has made some real modifications to cudd (I don't think that they are too significant though). From looking at the code it seems like they at least tried to support using an unmodified version, however I don't know if it actually works. Also, cudd's build system looks to be a joke (e.g. assumes `sizeof(void *) == 4` unless you explicitly tell it otherwise), so I don't know how much I would trust it.

So I looked a bit more into how exactly polybori modifies cudd, and other than the build system changes, it appears to be just one of two things:

1. Prefixing the symbols to not collide with another installation of cudd
2. stripping out code that polybori doesn't use (there is only one case that polybori makes any meaningful changes to do this).

Given this, I don't think it would be hard to make polybori work with a vanilla version of cudd. Also, since upstream cudd is not completely dead, the author might be receptive to a better build system if we provide it.

Exactly what does this patch do? It looks like you're moving part of `polybori` into the Sage library, why that?

From sage-devel "Python 3 focused Sage Days" thread:
Hi, here's a reply from a PolyBoRi developer:

Subject: Re: [Polybori-discuss] Fwd: Re: [sage-devel] Re: Python 3 focused 
Sage	Days
Date: Saturday 10 Jan 2015, 22:19:16

<polybori-discuss@lists.sourceforge.net>

Hi Martin,
Unfortunately, Andrew's right, PolyBoRi died when its developers left the 
scientific community. I'm not sure, what's the best way for SAGE to deal with 
it. Porting PolyBoRi's py files shouldn't be a big deal, and Sage already uses  
it's own Cython-bindings for the data structures. What remains is scons. 
Perhaps, it's easier to set up a setup.py or another build system than 
removing PolyBoRi from all the crypto modules. (You probably know the 
dependencies better than me.) For working around lots of scons issues, most of 
the SConstruct file is plain python anyway.

Best regards,
 Alexander

I don't think that's "the question".

All the packaging effort in Sage is really converging towards separating packages from the Sage library proper.

At the very least, moving `polybori` in the Sage library is a sufficiently big change that it should be discussed on `sage-devel`.

If you really decide to move `polybori` to the Sage library, then I think that

1. moving `polybori` to the Sage library and
2. making it Python 3 compatible

should be two different tickets.

Yes.

I would not. As I see it there are three routes we could go with polybori:

1. We adopt the route that we took with Pynac (as a fork of Ginac). Our fork might in the future become tightly coupled with Sage, but we maintain it as a separate package outside of Sage.

2. We make a minimal fork, only include the minimal changes necessary to build polybori without scons. If more substantive changes are needed, we include those in the Sage library.

3. A hybrid approach: maintain a minimal fork, and a maintain a set of patches for more substantive changes.


I really dislike option 3 (which seems to be the one you are voting for). It seems like it just adds the unnecessary work of maintain patches, with no real benefit. Upon reflection, I would vote for 1, since it allows us make changes to the c++ source if we need to in the future.

If we go with option 1, I would rename this ticket to "Switch from polybori to XXXX", where XXXX is our fork of polybori (still needs a name, I haven't been 100% happy with anything I've come up with). In that case, I view it as perfectly acceptable for there to be additional changes to the fork, such as the Python 3 changes I made.

Also, `@`fbissey. The author of cudd got back to me finally, he said he was already planning on making a new release sometime this summer which uses autotools. Until then, I think I'll continue bundling it with polybori.

One thing I don't like is that this will mean essentially unreviewed code in Sage.

From a practical point of view, there is not much difference between code in the Sage library and code in some upstream project which is only used in Sage.

But the code in the Sage library is supposed to be reviewed, while code in upstream projects is normally not reviewed (if people are using upstream outside of Sage, that means at least that the code is tested).

To be honest, I also don't have an optimal solution. Maybe that's why you should ask for feedback on `sage-devel`.

Cool to see some move on this! `spkg-install` still has messages about `polybori`, it is especially important to update those not too confuse new-comers.

I see that the library name hasn't changed upstream (`libpolybori*`), that would be something to consider although it is not a show stopper for this.

I notice `ipython` has been dropped from the list of dependencies, is it on purpose?

I didn't want to have to deal with this on the sage side of things at the moment, so I didn't change this. There are a ton of places that the polybori name is used throughout the source code, and it would be a pain to change them, although changing the library name and headers shouldn't be too bad.

It shouldn't have been a dependency in the first place from what I can tell.

```
              libraries=['polybori', 'polybori_groebner', 'm4ri', 'gd', 'png12'],

shouldn't include `gd` we have removed the dependency in polybori and a check in sage-on-gentoo (all compiled with `-Wl,-as-needed`) shows that it is not used in `pbori.so`, there is only one instance of a direct linking to `libgd` in the whole sage, I'll check where it is coming from.
