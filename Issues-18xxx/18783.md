This is the first ticket about the implementation of differentiable manifolds resulting from the [SageManifolds project](http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/). See the metaticket #18528 for an overview.

The base field K of the differentiable manifold is generic (only assumed to be some non-discrete topological field), so that the user may specify e.g. K=**R** (real manifolds) or K=**C** (complex manifolds). This ticket implements the following Python classes, all of them being subclasses of classes introduced for topological manifolds (tickets #18529, #18640, #18725):

- `DifferentiableManifold` (subclass of `TopologicalManifold`, cf. #18529): differentiable
  manifold over a topological field K (Parent class)
- `DiffChart` (subclass of `Chart`, cf. #18529): chart of a K-differentiable atlas
  - `RealDiffChart` (subclass of `RealChart`, cf. #18529): chart of a K-differentiable atlas 
    for K=**R**
- `DiffCoordChange` (subclass of `CoordChange`, cf. #18529): differentiable transition map
- `DiffScalarFieldAlgebra` (subclass of `ScalarFieldAlgebra`, cf. #18640): set C<sup>k</sup>(M) of
  k-times continuously K-differentiable functions M --> K, where M is a differentiable manifold
  over K, C<sup>k</sup>(M) being a commutative algebra over K (Parent class)
- `DiffScalarField` (subclass of `ScalarField`, cf. #18640): k-times continuously 
  K-differentiable function M --> K (Element class)
- `DiffManifoldHomset` (subclass of `TopManifoldHomset`, cf. #18725): set Hom(M,N) of
  differentiable maps between the differentiable manifolds M and N over the same topological
  field K (Parent class)
- `DiffMap` (subclass of `ContinuousMap`, cf. #18725): differentiable map M --> N (Element class)

The follow-up ticket is #18843.

+This is the first ticket about the implementation of differentiable manifolds resulting from the [SageManifolds project](http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/). See the metaticket #18528 for an overview.
+
+The base field K of the differentiable manifold is generic (only assumed to be some non-discrete topological field), so that the user may specify e.g. K=**R** (real manifolds) or K=**C** (complex manifolds). This ticket implements the following Python classes, all of them being subclasses of classes introduced for topological manifolds (tickets #18529, #18640, #18725):
+
+- `DifferentiableManifold` (subclass of `TopologicalManifold`, cf. #18529): differentiable
+  manifold over a topological field K (Parent class)
+- `DiffChart` (subclass of `Chart`, cf. #18529): chart of a K-differentiable atlas
+  - `RealDiffChart` (subclass of `RealChart`, cf. #18529): chart of a K-differentiable atlas 
+    for K=**R**
+- `DiffCoordChange` (subclass of `CoordChange`, cf. #18529): differentiable transition map
+- `DiffScalarFieldAlgebra` (subclass of `ScalarFieldAlgebra`, cf. #18640): set C<sup>k</sup>(M) of
+  k-times continuously K-differentiable functions M --> K, where M is a differentiable manifold
+  over K, C<sup>k</sup>(M) being a commutative algebra over K (Parent class)
+- `DiffScalarField` (subclass of `ScalarField`, cf. #18640): k-times continuously 
+  K-differentiable function M --> K (Element class)
+- `DiffManifoldHomset` (subclass of `TopManifoldHomset`, cf. #18725): set Hom(M,N) of
+  differentiable maps between the differentiable manifolds M and N over the same topological
+  field K (Parent class)
+- `DiffMap` (subclass of `ContinuousMap`, cf. #18725): differentiable map M --> N (Element class)
+
+The follow-up ticket is #18843.
+
+**Documentation**:
+The reference manual is produced by
+`sage -docbuild reference/manifolds html`
+It can also be accessed online at http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/doc/18783/reference/manifolds/
+More documentation (e.g. example worksheets) can be found [here](http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/documentation.html).
