Unicode/Ascii art needs to know the line width, but the setting is dependent on the display backend (e.g. terminal vs browser-based notebook).  Hence it should be moved from `sage.typeset.character_art` to the display backends in `sage.repl.rich_output`.

Where abouts is `sage.typeset.character_art`  located? I was able to find `sage.repl.rich_output `, but i couldn't find any references to `sage.typeset.character_art` or terminal_width when searching the code on github.
