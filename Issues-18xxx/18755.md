On a quick look-over, what you currently have looks good (one typo `an hyperbolic`). However I would add how the elementary crystals are useful in relation to `B(\infty)`, specifically the path model.

Since grade school, I had been under the impression that you always use "an" before a word that starts with "h", since the "h" is supposed to be silent.  However, I did some reading about it, and I now agree that it should be "a hyperbolic" rather than "an hyperbolic".  Thanks for catching that!

One problem I noticed already (and don't know how to immediately fix) is that the `Next topic` links are not working as expected.

[Kashiwara1995] can also be used as a reference for T_lambda. (Example 7.3.) Also for the B_i.

In some cases left tensoring with T_lambda is different from right tensoring with T_lambda. For example left tensoring B_i with T_lambda is the same as right tensoring with T_{s_i lambda}.

There is potential for confusion since Sage's convention for tensoring is the opposite of Kashiwara's. Kashiwara usually considers B tensor T_lambda if he just wants to shift the dimension. So I guess we do the reverse, which is what you do in the tutorial. The issue comes up again with R_lambda. It might be worth mentioning something about this issue.

The patch should add Ben Salisbury as an author.

Hi Anne,

An example has been added now to the C crystal section.  Hopefully this example will give some good motivation for using the R crystal.  Also, `make doc-clean` solved the link problem.  Thanks!

Best,
Ben

Hi Ben,

I found one more typo `Rμ−λ\otimesB(λ)` in the R-crystal section. I think there is a space missing between \otimes and B. Other than that, it looks good to me.

Do you agree with Travis' comment that the weight `\rho` versus weight 0 problem should be fixed in the example?

Dan, any further comments?

Best,

Anne
