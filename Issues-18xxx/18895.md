The definition allows a choice of a general c<sub>ij</sub> matrix such that c<sub>ij</sub> + c<sub>ji</sub> = 1 for all `i != j`.

We also perform some cleanup:

- Remove the trailing whitespace at the end of the monomial printing.
- Only needing to input the dominant weight.
- Better handling of dictionaries in monomial methods.
