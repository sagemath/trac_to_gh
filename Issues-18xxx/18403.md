Since #17555 the 'dev' scripts have been removed from Sage's documentation. They have been kept around 'for those who still use them' yet should be removed in the long run, to be replaced with 'git-trac'.

With this branch, a deprecation warning is raised when it should to warn everybody who uses them.

Just for fun, I actually used the `dev` scripts to review this ticket. They somehow create a message like that.

Let me also repeat that I oppose removing the dev scripts as long as `git-trac` does not support checking out tickets "out of the box".
