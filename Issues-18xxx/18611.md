```
To compute all `l`-isogenies, Sage uses a function `mult(f)` which computes

```
gcd( numerator(f(m)), psi )
```
where `m` is a rational function giving the multiplication-by-`m` map (the denominator of `m` is coprime to `psi`)

Instead of the above computation, the inverse direction is actually easier to compute: given `g`, we want to find `f` such that

```
gcd( numerator(f(m)), psi ) = g
```
Using some theory, this is equivalent to

```
f(m) = 0 mod g
```
Since `f` must be irreducible of the same degree as `g`, this is just the characteristic (= minimal) polynomial of `m mod g`.

---

Example timing:

**before**

```
sage: %time from sage.schemes.elliptic_curves.isogeny_small_degree import isogenies_prime_degree_general; E = EllipticCurve(GF(3^3,'a'), [0,0,0,-1,0]); L = isogenies_prime_degree_general(E, 73)
CPU times: user 1min 52s, sys: 16 ms, total: 1min 52s
Wall time: 1min 52s
```

**after**

```
sage: %time from sage.schemes.elliptic_curves.isogeny_small_degree import isogenies_prime_degree_general; E = EllipticCurve(GF(3^3,'a'), [0,0,0,-1,0]); L = isogenies_prime_degree_general(E, 73)
CPU times: user 33.1 s, sys: 107 ms, total: 33.2 s
Wall time: 33.2 s
```

Depends on #18589

though thanks to the code at #18589 this does not use mult() anyway so is not strictly relevant to this ticket.
