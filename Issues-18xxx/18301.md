(`build/pkgs/ncurses/patches/ncurses-5.9.20131221_work_around_broken_GNU_cpp_5.x.patch`, self-explanatory:)

```patch
Building ncurses with GCC 5.1 (or more precisely, with its 'cpp') fails with
a syntax error, caused by earlier preprocessing.

(I'm not entirely sure whether it's a GCC bug or rather caused by a new
feature which breaks further processing with 'awk' and 'sed';  I *think*
at least the 'awk' inline script "AW2" simply isn't prepared for the changed
output of 'cpp' w.r.t. line directives [1].  Anyway, the patch fixes the issue.)

Haven't checked whether or how upstream already deals with this (probably even by adding `-P` unconditionally).

P.S.:  Doesn't look like that single upstream patch alone would suffice, we'd presumably have to include more (but our package is already patched).

I'm not really keen to figure out which other parts we may need, and whether those may in turn break other things.

Well the corresponding gentoo bug is https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=545114 since the same dev opened and closed it, I would say they very much have tested upstream patch.

I'll have to say I like yours better, it feels more comprehensible. But upstream will probably stick to its own fix. 

Current version of ncurses in sage is a dev version from upstream (available at ftp://invisible-island.net/ncurses/current/ the one we have is old enough to be off the list) may be we should just upgrade to one of the latest dev version? Jean-Pierre Flori did the last upgrade may be he has an opinion on the process?

Well, that's the problem.  Last time J-P had to add a patch again because something got borked again which was fixed in the previous version, and I cannot (and don't want to) test on various platforms, with various compilers or setups.

(The diff above is btw. from the latest devel version, but only for that file, which got fixed in an earlier version.)

I agree, let's update in a follow up ticket.

And I fear the XOPEN_SOURCE thing if still present is still broken on some archs.
The patch surely does not apply anymore because configure was regenerated...

Thanks.

Where did you have the XOPEN_SOURCE problems?

I currently cannot test on anything but Linux x86/x86_64 (skynet and bsd.math, RIP), so I didn't even try to upgrade.

The XOPEN_SOURCE problem was on Solaris...
See ticket:15268#comment:10 and #15796 for some info.

Note sure what is in latest upstream right now...
See http://invisible-island.net/ncurses/NEWS.html#index-t20131116 and http://invisible-island.net/ncurses/NEWS.html#index-t20140209 and http://invisible-island.net/ncurses/NEWS.html#index-t20150221 for some recent changes, especially the second one.
I'd say the patch is not needed anymore, but we'll have to check the source or test on Solaris.
