(`build/pkgs/ncurses/patches/ncurses-5.9.20131221_work_around_broken_GNU_cpp_5.x.patch`, self-explanatory:)

```patch
Building ncurses with GCC 5.1 (or more precisely, with its 'cpp') fails with
a syntax error, caused by earlier preprocessing.

(I'm not entirely sure whether it's a GCC bug or rather caused by a new
feature which breaks further processing with 'awk' and 'sed';  I *think*
at least the 'awk' inline script "AW2" simply isn't prepared for the changed
output of 'cpp' w.r.t. line directives [1].  Anyway, the patch fixes the issue.)

Well, that's the problem.  Last time J-P had to add a patch again because something got borked again which was fixed in the previous version, and I cannot (and don't want to) test on various platforms, with various compilers or setups.

<a id='comment:12'></a>Thanks.

Where did you have the XOPEN_SOURCE problems?

I currently cannot test on anything but Linux x86/x86_64 (skynet and bsd.math, RIP), so I didn't even try to upgrade.

<a id='comment:13'></a>The XOPEN_SOURCE problem was on Solaris...
See http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15268#comment:10 and #15796 for some info.

Note sure what is in latest upstream right now...
See http://invisible-island.net/ncurses/NEWS.html#index-t20131116 and http://invisible-island.net/ncurses/NEWS.html#index-t20140209 and http://invisible-island.net/ncurses/NEWS.html#index-t20150221 for some recent changes, especially the second one.
I'd say the patch is not needed anymore, but we'll have to check the source or test on Solaris.
