Currently, it is possible to do a truncation of a polytope via the method ".edge_truncation()".

See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncation_%28geometry%29

I currently need the notion of edge-truncation, which is achieve by cutting the polytope along a "well-chosen" hyperplane whose normal vector lies in the normal cone of the edge. This edge truncation uses only one edge. Not all edges at once.

Further, one can define a face truncation similarly with the same code. I am implementing a method called ".face_truncation(face, normal_coefficient, cut_frac)" taking a face of the polytope, and two optional parameters to vary the angle of the cut.

This new method makes the old method ill-named. It should be renamed simply "truncation" or "complete_vertex_truncation".

While at it, I corrected a few writing conventions in the file.

<a id='comment:21'></a>Hello,

Why did you changed the default value of the argument `cut_frac`?

The following is by far not enough to understand what the method is doing

```
+        - ``linear_coefficients`` -- tuple of integer. Specify the coefficient
+          of the normal vector of the cutting hyperplane.
```
You should add more description in the docstring. (that would help me to understand what this method is doing)

In your examples you are only showing how combinatorially the method behave. I guess that the actual added vertices are indeed interesting. (that would help me to understand what this method is doing (bis))

There is a trailing whitespace after the docstring and many before the `return`.

You should replace

```
if False not in map(lambda x: facet.contains(x) and
        not facet.interior_contains(x), face_vertices):
```
by

```
if any(facet.contains(x) and not facet.interior_contains(x) for x in face_vertices):
```

Also replace

```
linear_evaluation.difference(set([B]))
```
by

```
linear_evaluation.difference(B)
```

And add an example where the base ring does change.

Vincent

<a id='comment:28'></a>Salut Vincent,

I was also confused with the choice `edge_truncation` already. I have no idea why it was named this way. The only reason I can find is if you think of a polytope as a graph only and you cut all the edges simultaneously twice: close to each of their ends. But geometrically, there is much much more happening.

As I said, this method does the truncations all at the same time, giving a different result than cutting a single face at a time, where you then also have to take care of how deep you cut.

The previous `edge_truncation` (which is now `truncation` inspired by the wikipedia page above), actually performs face truncations with faces being vertices, again all simultaneously.

I tried to think of how to join the two methods. Doing the `truncation` using the function `face_truncation` one vertex at a time while also recording the old data for where to cut each vertex next seemed like over doing what it was already doing with very simple code.

So, I don't really see an advantage in joining the functions...

<a id='comment:40'></a>Salut,

two remarks, otherwise this is good to go:

1) in

```
+            normal_vector = sum([linear_coefficients[i]*normal_vectors[i] for i
+                                 in range(len(normal_vectors))])
```
there is no need for the [ ] just inside sum()

2) similarly in 

```
+        linear_evaluation = set([-normal_vector * (v.vector()) for v in
+            self.vertices()])
```
inside set()

Once done and checked, you can set a positive review on my behalf.
