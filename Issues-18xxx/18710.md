Move all `make` targets involving building parts of Sage to `build/Makefile`.

One advantage is that we can build the documentation in parallel with packages: not every package needs to be installed to build the documentation; in particular R (which takes a while to build) can be built in parallel with the doc.

We also add targets for every package, such that `make mypkg` would install `mypkg` *with dependency checking* (unlike `./sage -i mypkg` which does not have dependency checking).

Currently in Sage:

```
build: logs configure
    +cd build && \
    "../$(PIPE)" \
        "./install all 2>&1" \
        "tee -a ../logs/install.log"
    +./sage -b
```

With this ticket:

```
%::
    $(MAKE) configure logs
    +cd build && ./pipestatus \
        "./install '$@' 2>&1" \
        "tee -a ../logs/install.log"
```

There is no difference at all in how `install.log` is treated.

Be honest for a second Jeroen. There is no difference at all *when make build* is called. For all other calls, there is a difference. In these situations, it would make more sense to not double-log everything. Why don't you move the logging to `install.log` to the `build:` rule in the other makefile?

And then, you can remove the logging from this very very generic rule.

OK, let me try again:

> Can't you just move this logging to the other makefile?

There is already logging in the individual rules in `build/Makefile`. This is logging number 1.

The logging to `install.log` from `Makefile` is logging number 2.

I don't see where a "triple logging" could come from.

Note that `install.log` contains information which is not available from the individual log files:
1. a listing of environment variables at the start of the build, and other output from `build/install`.
2. timing information: it shows all commands in parallel as they are executed. This is actually a feature, since it allows debugging race conditions. With just the individual files, that information is lost.

Right. Do we agree that before your branch is applied, this "number 2 logging" in `install.log` is only performed for 'make build'?

(assuming that we agree on that) With the new fallback `%::` rule that you added, all calls to 'make X' that are not defined in `SAGE_ROOT/Makefile` are forwarded to `build/Makefile`. Thus, after your branch is applied, the output of `make doc-html` is logged in `install.log`. 

(assuming that we agree on that) Before your branch is applied, the output of `make doc-html` was not logged i install.log.

(assuming that we agree on that) Why wouldn't we remove the logging from the `%::` rule, and only add it in the `make build` rule (which is now the `make all-build` rule from `build/Makefile`)?

For 'make build' it I agree that this information can make sense.

Okay. From what you say, it appears to me that:

1) After your branch is applied, "make build" is logged exactly as previously in `install.log`
2) After your branch is applied, the output of `make doc-html` is logged in `install.log`. As it triggers a `make build`, then the output of `make build` is logged twice in `install.log` (once in `make doc-html`, once in the triggered `make build`)
3) My problem with your `%::` is that is that it covers *any* kind of rule, even those that we will add in the future. Promising right now that any rules that is aliased from `Makefile` to `build/Makefile` will be logged in `install.log` looks too wide for me.

Thus, could you remove this logging from the `%::` rule? You could add the same logging in the `make all-sage` rule. It would also let you add a more specific logging of `make doc` that would not cover the subsequent call to `make build`, thus we would not double-log that.

> See the last paragraph of [comment:34]. Those reasons make sense for `make doc` as much for `make build`.

I would have less problem if you were only adding those rules in `make doc` and `make build`. Right now you are doing this in a wider scope: you apply then to all rules that are aliased, even those that will be added later.

I think you are misunderstanding something, because this is not true: `make doc-html` does not trigger `make build`.

The documentation is now built similarly to spkgs. The dependencies for the documentation are declared just like the dependencies for packages, see this part of `build/Makefile`:

```Makefile
# Building the documentation has many dependencies, because all
# documented modules are imported and because we use matplotlib to
# produce plots.
DOC_DEPENDENCIES = sagelib $(INST)/$(SPHINX) $(INST)/$(SAGENB) \
    | $(SAGERUNTIME) $(INST)/$(MAXIMA) $(INST)/$(NETWORKX) \
    $(INST)/$(SCIPY) $(INST)/$(MATPLOTLIB) $(INST)/$(PILLOW)

doc: doc-html

doc-html: $(DOC_DEPENDENCIES)
    cd .. && $(PIPE) "./sage --docbuild --no-pdf-links all html $(SAGE_DOCBUILD_OPTS) 2>&1" "tee -a logs/dochtml.log"
```
