Move all `make` targets involving building parts of Sage to `build/Makefile`.

One advantage is that we can build the documentation in parallel with packages: not every package needs to be installed to build the documentation; in particular R (which takes a while to build) can be built in parallel with the doc.

We also add targets for every package, such that `make mypkg` would install `mypkg` *with dependency checking* (unlike `./sage -i mypkg` which does not have dependency checking).

I split off 2 tickets: #18715 and #18716 and kept only the core of this ticket here, I hope it's more clear now.

Actually, why not? I don't see a problem with having one "master" log file logging everything. And it can help debugging race conditions if some command fails depending on when it was run.

The individual log files are still generated, so I don't see this as a regression.

You concatenate in the same file the results of several commands, don't you? How are we meant to know what is the result of what? Wouldn't it be better to have a logfile whose name includes the date or something?

Also, 'install' is ill-chosen. This filename is used whenever the rule that is being used does not exist in the  main makefile, and it can be anything (install/docbuild/tests). It also seems that calls to 'make' with a wrong rule will produce output too.

Well, this ticket is about integrating the build of the documentation into the rest of the build system. So having one log file is consistent with that.

True, but that's not really a major problem, is it?

The only new issue is that the output of `make this_target_does_not_exist` gets logged in `install.log`. I do not believe that this is sufficient reason to reject this patch.

All the other issues that you mentioned in [comment:20] are already present in Sage, independent of this ticket.

Currently in Sage:

```
build: logs configure
    +cd build && \
    "../$(PIPE)" \
        "./install all 2>&1" \
        "tee -a ../logs/install.log"
    +./sage -b
```

With this ticket:

```
%::
    $(MAKE) configure logs
    +cd build && ./pipestatus \
        "./install '$@' 2>&1" \
        "tee -a ../logs/install.log"
```

There is no difference at all in how `install.log` is treated.

Be honest for a second Jeroen. There is no difference at all *when make build* is called. For all other calls, there is a difference. In these situations, it would make more sense to not double-log everything. Why don't you move the logging to `install.log` to the `build:` rule in the other makefile?

And then, you can remove the logging from this very very generic rule.

OK, let me try again:

> Can't you just move this logging to the other makefile?

There is already logging in the individual rules in `build/Makefile`. This is logging number 1.

The logging to `install.log` from `Makefile` is logging number 2.

I don't see where a "triple logging" could come from.

Note that `install.log` contains information which is not available from the individual log files:
1. a listing of environment variables at the start of the build, and other output from `build/install`.
2. timing information: it shows all commands in parallel as they are executed. This is actually a feature, since it allows debugging race conditions. With just the individual files, that information is lost.

Right. Do we agree that before your branch is applied, this "number 2 logging" in `install.log` is only performed for 'make build'?

(assuming that we agree on that) With the new fallback `%::` rule that you added, all calls to 'make X' that are not defined in `SAGE_ROOT/Makefile` are forwarded to `build/Makefile`. Thus, after your branch is applied, the output of `make doc-html` is logged in `install.log`. 

(assuming that we agree on that) Before your branch is applied, the output of `make doc-html` was not logged i install.log.

(assuming that we agree on that) Why wouldn't we remove the logging from the `%::` rule, and only add it in the `make build` rule (which is now the `make all-build` rule from `build/Makefile`)?

For 'make build' it I agree that this information can make sense.

True. But this is a feature, not a bug.

I would have less problem if you were only adding those rules in `make doc` and `make build`. Right now you are doing this in a wider scope: you apply then to all rules that are aliased, even those that will be added later.

I think you are misunderstanding something, because this is not true: `make doc-html` does not trigger `make build`.

The documentation is now built similarly to spkgs. The dependencies for the documentation are declared just like the dependencies for packages, see this part of `build/Makefile`:

```Makefile
# Building the documentation has many dependencies, because all
# documented modules are imported and because we use matplotlib to
# produce plots.
DOC_DEPENDENCIES = sagelib $(INST)/$(SPHINX) $(INST)/$(SAGENB) \
    | $(SAGERUNTIME) $(INST)/$(MAXIMA) $(INST)/$(NETWORKX) \
    $(INST)/$(SCIPY) $(INST)/$(MATPLOTLIB) $(INST)/$(PILLOW)

doc: doc-html

doc-html: $(DOC_DEPENDENCIES)
    cd .. && $(PIPE) "./sage --docbuild --no-pdf-links all html $(SAGE_DOCBUILD_OPTS) 2>&1" "tee -a logs/dochtml.log"
```

When you say `make doc`, do you really mean `make doc` or also `make doc-pdf` and `make doc-html-jsmath` and similar? When you say `make build`, I guess you really mean `make all` and `make all-build` (or just one of these?). You see that this becomes complicated...

This commit was by Volker for #18788, but it really belongs on this ticket. I give it positive_review:
> |                                                                                                                                          |                              |

So this is the only commit which needs to be reviewed:
> |                                                                                                                                          |                                   |
