**Every** doctest failure should be a blocker. That's why I care so much to not introduce artificial doctest failures in #18904.

It's a bit weird to say that something is a blocker even though our automated testing (patchbots, Volker's tests before each release) does not even detect it.

> That's why I care so much to not introduce artificial doctest failures in #18904.

If only you did not try to hid bugs under the carpet in order to preserve the appearance of reliability ...

I also want all doctests to pass. My method to do so is to let them scream when they want to, and to fix the problems.
