Split up `IntegerListsLex` in a fast Cython back-end and a (slower) Python front-end. Restructure with multiple implementations (like #17920) in mind.

This ticket will not change anything to the public interface of `IntegerListsLex`.

<a id='comment:1'></a>- I believe we should rephrase this ticket as "extract the
  `IntegerListsLex` *iterator* as a standalone tool that depends on
  nothing but `Python`/`Cython`". In fact this could go as far as making
  it a standalone library in e.g. C++.

  We want to keep the parent to model the set itself, ask questions
  like cardinality or building the polyhedron, do constructions on top
  of it (e.g. use it as indexing set for a vector space), etc.

  #18056 would be a good occasion to handle this part.

- Being able to specify an element constructor is a useful feature as
  well. What we need to discuss here is whether we want to switch to
  using lists (or tuples!) by default.

- To remove `__classcall__` we need to wait until the end of the
  deprecation period. To remove `global_options` we need to wait for
  the subclasses using it to be refactored to not impose this burden
  on `IntegerListsLex`.

The 'Lex' there seems a bit too much for the mathematical object that you want to represent. You describe things that could be a method of an 'IntegerLists' object (or more specifically methods of 'Compositions' or 'Partitions').

There should be a way to enumerate these objects without paying this cost, however. A way to have both is to implement the iterator to return a copy of the current list, or a tuple (or even the current list itself, with big 'read only' warnings), and then implement in `IntegerListsLex` an `__iter__` that wraps every element returned by that iterator with <whatever you need>.

I said for the iterator. Not for the main class. I would not bother if `iter(IntegerLists(10^100))` just failed. It should be very fast for small entries.

I think that we really should support `list(IntegerLists(10^100, length=1))` because in Sage, we *always* support large integers if possible.

In any case, changing this is certainly outside the scope of this ticket (it could be done in #18055 or #18056). Here, I just want to reorganize the code without changing the implementation.

That's part of why I am thinking of C++; then we can just have a
templated iterator, and depending on the input we can choose one
instantiation or the other.

I have no idea really. A lot of the code I write for Sage is Cython and it hasn't bothered me.

On the other hand, I on purpose did not Cythonize `IntegerListsLexIter` (it's in a Cython source file, but doesn't use any Cython features). So if it makes your life easier, just move that one class to a Python file.

FYI, I rebased this branch on top of sage-6.7.beta0 and everything looks clean.

I noticed that in `nn.y` in `sage.combinat.integer_lists` it currently says

```json
{
    "body": "<a id='comment:44'></a>Hi Jeroen,\n\nSorry, I got sidetracked reviewing other tickets. Thanks Anne for the\nreminder, and for checking the code and the documentation!\n\nI have just been through the code myself (not checking the fine\ndetails though).\n\nAltogether, I believe it's correct. Cythonizing the envelope function\nand making the iterator into a Cython class that depends on little of\nthe Sage infrastructure was in our long term plans, so that's great (I\nwould have done it after the algorithm refactorisation, but since it's\ndone, let's move forward). Generalizing a base IntegerLists class is\nuseful as well.\n\nOn the other hand, is it absolutely necessary to have this separation\nbetween frontend and backend classes? It introduces some complexity\nand in fact some duplication (e.g. in the tests). In particular, I am\nworried that it might introduce complexity in the construction of new\nspecial case classes based on `IntegerListsLex`, when the primary goal\nis to make this as trivial as possible.

<a id='comment:44'></a>Hi Jeroen,

Sorry, I got sidetracked reviewing other tickets. Thanks Anne for the
reminder, and for checking the code and the documentation!

I have just been through the code myself (not checking the fine
details though).

Altogether, I believe it's correct. Cythonizing the envelope function
and making the iterator into a Cython class that depends on little of
the Sage infrastructure was in our long term plans, so that's great (I
would have done it after the algorithm refactorisation, but since it's
done, let's move forward). Generalizing a base IntegerLists class is
useful as well.

On the other hand, is it absolutely necessary to have this separation
between frontend and backend classes? It introduces some complexity
and in fact some duplication (e.g. in the tests). In particular, I am
worried that it might introduce complexity in the construction of new
special case classes based on `IntegerListsLex`, when the primary goal
is to make this as trivial as possible. I'd need to actually implement
such new classes to qualify this worry.

If it's just a question of avoiding calls to the element constructor,
could not this be done just locally in `__iter__` (returning directly
an `IntegerListsLexIter` object, or mapping the constructor on it)?
If it's a question of making the iterator code independent of
`Parent`, well, it already is: it only uses the `IntegerListsLex`
object as a data holder for the constraints, right? As long as we
don't have a specific use case (backed up by benchmarks if speed is
the motivation), there may not be much point in maintaining additional
code for this.

At the very least, there should be some entry point (typically in the
module description) listing all the classes, and clarifying their
respective roles. Maybe slightly more systematic class names could
help; say: `IntegerLists`, `IntegerListsLex`, `IntegerListsBackend`,
`IntegerListsLexBackend`.


Some small suggestions:

- some of the cdef attributes could be declared as
  int's. E.g. `Envelope.min_length`.

- maybe we could use the occasion to rename the attribute
  `IntegerListsLexIter.parent` especially if it's not a parent
  anymore.

- Another small complication is having to handle pickling by hand each
  time. At least, would there be a way to implement `XXX.__reduce__`
  to return `(XXX, *)` rather than having to implement an
  `unpickle_XXX` function each time?

Cheers,
                          Nicolas

It's a question of making the backend class independent of `Parent` yes. I think it's good to have a fast simple Cython backend and a proper Sage `Parent` front-end.

I consider that out of the scope of this ticket. These are micro-optimizations which can be done after we have a clearer view of the final design.

Sure, fine for me.

It's certainly annoying, but that's because Cython cannot automatically (un)pickle extension types. I have to check if it can be simplified.

I agree its good in theory. But if it makes things more complicated,
then it's only good in practice if we have an actual use case.

A main point being: unless we create millions of small IntegerListsLex
objects, I don't see why having it be a (facade) parent makes things
slower.

Fair enough.

A use case is in `MatrixSpace.__iter__` and I also have others intensive usage for building so-called square tiled surfaces (if you care, look at `u/vdelecroix/flat_surfaces-6.5`). I would be grateful if the iterator could be accessible without initializing any parent.

Wouldn't this happen if somebody wants, for all `n` between 10 and 1000, one instance of a partition of `n` satisfying <a specific set of constraints> ?

There is a (trivial) case at least which makes sense to me, i.e. for a fixed `k` find some partition of `n` into integers between `floor(n/k)` and `ceil(n/k)`. I agree that this can be done manually without this iterator, but I expect that it can happen with more complicated set of constraints too.

Thanks Vincent and Jeroen. For fairness, we should also initialize the
category. Here it is:

```
sage: %timeit B()
The slowest run took 4.13 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
100000 loops, best of 3: 13.3 µs per loop
sage: %timeit B(category=C)
The slowest run took 7.14 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
10000 loops, best of 3: 21.7 µs per loop
```

Those benchmarks teach us that constructing a `Parent` costs 200 times
more than an empty object. Not quite surprising, but it's a start. Now
what I really had in mind was a benchmark in a real use case, to
estimate what's the relative overhead in a typical situation.

Let's take something really trivial:

```
sage: sage: %timeit IntegerListsLex(n=1, max_length=1).an_element()
The slowest run took 6.67 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
10000 loops, best of 3: 113 µs per loop
```

Now we start to have some concrete ground to start discussions: what
we are speaking about is an overhead of 13% in the case of the most
trivial operation. There probably is some room for improvements in the
initialization of `IntegerListsLex` objects; but not so much either:
there is some unavoidable option parsing and initialization work to
do. Similarly, there may be room for improvement in the initialization
of a `Parent` (I am surprised that initializing the category is
costly, since for a Cython parent it does nothing but set an
attribute). Altogether, the 13% has to be taken with a grain of salt
at this point.

For additional insight, I believe we would be need to have some
typical concrete use case, like the one Vincent has for matrices or
flat surfaces. And see, then, what's the actual overhead. With that,
we will be able to take an informed decision; not just out of fear
that "parents are slow".

Vincent, could you pickup such a situation and make a benchmark?

In general I would like to follow this rule of thumb for our
enumerated sets:

- On one hand, implement super optimized standalone iterators with
  bare bone API, whenever there is a proven need for them.

- On the other hand, when modeling an enumerated set, implement it as
  a `Parent`s with nice input parsing and a full fledged API; and
  typically using the above iterators under the hood.

- Avoid half measures with iterables that are not `Parent`.

Here the situation is a bit delicate since we are in between the
shores: the iterator needs some non trivial parsing and internal
data. Which calls for an intermediate class handling the parsing and
the data storage; is this class meant to model the enumerated set
itself or not?


All that being said, just make your call. I am fine with additional
complexity when there is a proven and worthwhile need for it. And when
someone is willing to pay for the maintenance overhead ...

Cheers,
                              Nicolas

Why do you think that the current implementation is a "half measure"? I would say it fits your "super optimized standalone iterators with bare bone API" (except that it's currently not yet super optimized, see #18055 and #18056).

Yes, I am very happy with the Cython iterator (and its upcoming
optimizations) and the Parent enumerated sets (`IntegerLists*`). What
I am wondering about are the intermediate classes
(`IntegerLists*Impl`). What's their precise role? Do we really need
them?

- Are there situations where an iterator is not enough (we really need
  to model the enumerated set itself), yet we can't afford the
  overhead of having a Parent?

And / or

- Are the *Impl just utility classes that are mandatory to construct
  the iterator?


Maybe we should have a short video conference at some point; it would
be much easier to discuss!

Well, I can see two main use cases:
1. if you need to iterate twice over the same set.
2. to check containment.

In the future, point counting could be added as an extra algorithm in the `Impl` class, not in the iterator.

Do you find `...Backend` more clear than `...Impl`? If you care a lot, I can change it, but it smells like bike-shedding.

I see your point. Still I find useful to give the reader a hint that,
in this case, there is such a correspondence.  When reading the code,
I had to dig around to make sure I was getting it right.

So I'd rather have a consistent naming scheme, and a note to the
developers, in the overview documentation of the module, that there
need not be in general such a 1-to-1 correspondence.

Cheers,
                             Nicolas

PS: fun error message :-)

In writing this comment, I've convinced myself that having a frontend class for each backend will likely be a good thing in practice as it can be used to distinguish different iteration orders without having to look at the backend (which may not be python visible at the end of the day).

But why would you need to "distinguish different iteration orders" in the first place?

In the few cases (maybe invlex is the only one?) where the iteration algorithm really matters, I understand that you want a separate front-end. However, it should be possible for a backend to iterate in an arbitrary order.

I really want to see the front-end and back-end as orthogonal: I can see use cases for different front-ends with the same back-end and use cases for different back-ends for the same front-end.

It was for performance reasonings, but not the reason you're thinking of: short circuiting.

I don't need this flexibility, but it comes as an added bonus. Right now we can check backends explicitly, but this allows us to separate that off into a completely separate package and still retain a differentiation.

I can see both use cases as well, but chances are there will be a coupling between base classes and backend. However I don't think it is really useful to continue this discussion because we both have our reasons for liking it. We just need to take care of the additions from #15525 (and the doc tweak above).
