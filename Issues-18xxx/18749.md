```
We propose a new C++ library to compute Groebner basis over finite fields with the F4 algorithm.
This library works on prime fields of characteristic < 2<sup>32</sup>
and on binary field extensions of degree < 64.

The source code and a documentation are available on 
http://nauotit.github.io/openf4/

The tarball is available on 
http://nauotit.github.io/openf4/openf4-1.0.0.tar.gz

The branch attached to this ticket contains a wrapper (Cython) for this library.
Place the openf4 archive in the upstream directory, then use
`sage -i openf4`
before using this branch.

Informations on the new package:

-Speed (on my computer without vectorisation):

cyclic 8, GF(251): 
sage : 45.7 s
f4 : 30.8 s 

katsura 12, GF(251): 
sage : 12min 36s
f4 : 3min 16s

cyclic 8, GF(65521):
sage : 58.4
f4 : 25s

katsura 12, GF(65521):
sage : 15min 47s
f4 : 2min 46s

cyclic 8, GF(4294967291) : 
sage : does not work
f4 : 55.5 s

katsura 12, GF(4294967291) : 
sage : does not work
f4 : 11min 50s

Ideal in 8 variables over GF(2<sup>15</sup>):
sage : 60 s
f4 : 10s

Ideal in 8 variables over GF(2<sup>31</sup>): 
sage : 58.1 s
f4 : 15s

Ideal in 8 variables over GF(2<sup>63</sup>):  
sage : 1min 18s
f4 : 30s


Memory requirement:

The memory needed by openf4 depends on:
- the number of variables of the polynomial ring.
- the (unknown) maximum monomial degree reached during the computation.
- the (unknown) size of the considered matrices.

Even if our matrices are smaller than the ones of Magma, on cyclic 9 they exceed 70000 x 70000, which requires already around 20 GB on 4 Bytes integers.




Documentation:

Available with the package (doxygen).
And in the updated file multi_polynomial_ideal.py, function groebner_basis.


Usability:

Can be used in the same way than other algorithms.
However only the grevlex order is available.
Detailed in the file multi_polynomial_ideal.py, function groebner_basis.


Absence of memory leaks:

Tested with valgrind.


Maintainable:

When the Givaro version of Sage will be updated, the package could be build with this dependency in order to handle the prime fields of big characteristics.


Portability:

In order to be efficient our package can use the SSE2 and SSE4 extensions (vectorisation).
This extensions are automatically detected at build time (configure).
However, even without these optimisations our package is more efficient than the current implemented algorithms in Sage.
The package was tested on:
- Ubuntu 12.04 (64 bits)
- Ubuntu 14.04 (64 bits)
- Debian 8 (32 bits)
- Arch Linux (64 bits)
- Mac OS X Yosemite (64 bits)


Reasonable build time, size, dependencies:

If the build time is a problem, examples can be removed from the makefile.am.
Size: 12Mo
Dependencies: Givaro is an optional dependency but a recent version is required.


Note:

The proposed wrapper in Cython is not very efficient and may be improved:
for instance, the computation of katsura 12 over GF(4294967291) takes only 2min 11s, 
and more than 9 min are spent in the cython wrapper to convert the result into sage polynomials.

<a id='comment:1'></a>This looks very interesting.

Can you clarify what you're trying to achieve with this ticket. Do you want your F4 code to be a standard or an optional package? Note that adding standard packages requires a vote on [sage-devel] and usually some time during which the package was an optional package.


Does your package have a name other than F4?

Also, do you have an idea why the performance of the wrapper is so poor?

- I think the pyx file should be moved to `sage.libs.<libraryname>.<libraryname>.pyx`

- I improved conversion a bit:

```python
# before
sage: P = PolynomialRing(GF(next_prime(2^31)), 8, 'x')
sage: I = sage.rings.ideal.Cyclic(P)
sage: from sage.rings.polynomial.groebner_basis_f4 import groebner_basis_f4
sage: %time gb0 = groebner_basis_f4(I)
6.4465777874 # <- conversion time
CPU times: user 14.8 s, sys: 400 ms, total: 15.2 s
Wall time: 15.2 s

# after
sage: P = PolynomialRing(GF(next_prime(2^31)), 8, 'x')  
sage: I = sage.rings.ideal.Cyclic(P)                  
sage: %time gb0 = groebner_basis_f4(I)                
3.16141104698 # <- conversion time

on sage with giac and giacpy the syntax is like this:

```

<a id='comment:21'></a>Thank you for the bug report and the wrapper improvement.

I have found the bug (due to SSE).

Does the name 
-f4lib
-openf4
may be a suitable ?

For the "extra /include":
I place in $prefix/include only libf4.h and f4.h,
the "real" sources are placed in the $prefix/include/f4 directory where the declarations are separed from the definitions.

I will set up a git soon with the fix.

Let me know if you have any other requirements.

I'd say anything which is a proper name should work. 'f4lib' doesn't really qualify by that criterion I'd say, but it's better than 'f4'; 'openf4' could do. It's really up to you, though.

Why do you install the sources at all? As far as I can see you instantiate all templates in `libf4.cpp` anyway, so is there a need to copy the whole source code in `local/include`?

<a id='comment:25'></a>1. Is there an "upstream" page? It should be mentioned in `SPKG.txt`.

2. Is this right?

```
## License

 * GNU GPLv3
```
It would be much better if it was under GPL version 3 *or later*. If this isn't the case, you should ask upstream if they are willing to release under GPL version 3 or later.

3. Obviously, this shouldn't be there:

```
Put a bulleted list of dependencies here:
```

4. In `module_list.py`, this shouldn't be needed

```
depends = [SAGE_INC + "/libf4.h"]
```
since you're explicitly refering to `libf4.h` in the `.pyx` file.

5. For the copyright statement in `groebner_basis_f4.pyx`, please follow the format at

<a id='comment:26'></a>I update the code on https://github.com/nauotit/openf4 (the bug is fixed)

and the Sage files in the branch u/tcoladon/f4.

The new upstream name is openf4.

I don't understand your question about the licence? 

If the sources installation is a problem, we can remove them (just change the Makefile.am in the src directory) in a special target dedicated to Sage?

I haven't deleted the # lines in file groebner_basis_f4.pyx in case Givaro version is updated.

For the comparison with Magma, I'm not sure that openf4 is better on smaller prime fields. Magma is very slow when the characteristic is higher than 2^24

There is a difference between releasing between releasing a project under "**GPL version 3**" and "**GPL version 3 or any later version**". The latter is much preferred in case a GPL version 4 ever comes out and we want to be compatible with that.

I read the ticket description.

(or rather it doesn't really tell you this, it just gives you

+We propose a new C++ library to compute Groebner basis over finite fields with the F4 algorithm.
+This library works on prime fields of characteristic < 2<sup>32</sup>
+and on binary field extensions of degree < 64.
+
+The source code and a documentation are available on 
+http://nauotit.github.io/openf4/
+
+The branch attached to this ticket contains a wrapper (Cython) for this library.
+Place the openf4 archive in the upstream directory, then use
+sage -sh sage-fix-pkg-checksums
+sage -i -c -f openf4
+before using this branch.
+
+Informations on the new package:
+
+-Speed (on my computer without vectorisation):
+
+cyclic 8, GF(251): 
+sage : 45.7 s
+f4 : 30.8 s 
+
+katsura 12, GF(251): 
+sage : 12min 36s
+f4 : 3min 16s
+
+cyclic 8, GF(65521):
+sage : 58.4
+f4 : 25s
+
+katsura 12, GF(65521):
+sage : 15min 47s
+f4 : 2min 46s
+
+cyclic 8, GF(4294967291) : 
+sage : does not work
+f4 : 55.5 s
+
+katsura 12, GF(4294967291) : 
+sage : does not work
+f4 : 11min 50s
+
+Ideal in 8 variables over GF(2<sup>15</sup>):
+sage : 60 s
+f4 : 10s
+
+Ideal in 8 variables over GF(2<sup>31</sup>): 
+sage : 58.1 s
+f4 : 15s
+
+Ideal in 8 variables over GF(2<sup>63</sup>):  
+sage : 1min 18s
+f4 : 30s
+
+
+Memory requirement:
+
+The memory needed by openf4 depends on:
+- the number of variables of the polynomial ring.
+- the (unknown) maximum monomial degree reached during the computation.
+- the (unknown) size of the considered matrices.
+
+Even if our matrices are smaller than the ones of Magma, on cyclic 9 they exceed 70000 x 70000, which requires already around 20 GB on 4 Bytes integers.
+
+
+
+
+Documentation:
+
+Available with the package (doxygen).
+And in the updated file multi_polynomial_ideal.py, function groebner_basis.
+
+
+Usability:
+
+Can be used in the same way than other algorithms.
+However only the grevlex order is available.
+Detailed in the file multi_polynomial_ideal.py, function groebner_basis.
+
+
+Absence of memory leaks:
+
+Tested with valgrind.
+
+
+Maintainable:
+
+When the Givaro version of Sage will be updated, the package could be build with this dependency in order to handle the prime fields of big characteristics.
+
+
+Portability:
+
+In order to be efficient our package can use the SSE2 and SSE4 extensions (vectorisation).
+This extensions are automatically detected at build time (configure).
+However, even without these optimisations our package is more efficient than the current implemented algorithms in Sage.
+The package was tested on:
+- Ubuntu 12.04 (64 bits)
+- Ubuntu 14.04 (64 bits)
+- Debian 8 (32 bits)
+- Arch Linux (64 bits)
+- Mac OS X Yosemite (64 bits)
+
+
+Reasonable build time, size, dependencies:
+
+If the build time is a problem, examples can be removed from the makefile.am.
+Size: 12Mo
+Dependencies: Givaro is an optional dependency but a recent version is required.
+
+
+Note:
+
+The proposed wrapper in Cython is not very efficient and may be improved:
+for instance, the computation of katsura 12 over GF(4294967291) takes only 2min 11s, 
+and more than 9 min are spent in the cython wrapper to convert the result into sage polynomials.

+\`sage -i openf4\`
+before using this branch.
+
+Informations on the new package:
+
+-Speed (on my computer without vectorisation):
+
+cyclic 8, GF(251): 
+sage : 45.7 s
+f4 : 30.8 s 
+
+katsura 12, GF(251): 
+sage : 12min 36s
+f4 : 3min 16s
+
+cyclic 8, GF(65521):
+sage : 58.4
+f4 : 25s
+
+katsura 12, GF(65521):
+sage : 15min 47s
+f4 : 2min 46s
+
+cyclic 8, GF(4294967291) : 
+sage : does not work
+f4 : 55.5 s
+
+katsura 12, GF(4294967291) : 
+sage : does not work
+f4 : 11min 50s
+
+Ideal in 8 variables over GF(2<sup>15</sup>):
+sage : 60 s
+f4 : 10s
+
+Ideal in 8 variables over GF(2<sup>31</sup>): 
+sage : 58.1 s
+f4 : 15s
+
+Ideal in 8 variables over GF(2<sup>63</sup>):  
+sage : 1min 18s
+f4 : 30s
+
+
+Memory requirement:
+
+The memory needed by openf4 depends on:
+- the number of variables of the polynomial ring.
+- the (unknown) maximum monomial degree reached during the computation.
+- the (unknown) size of the considered matrices.
+
+Even if our matrices are smaller than the ones of Magma, on cyclic 9 they exceed 70000 x 70000, which requires already around 20 GB on 4 Bytes integers.
+
+
+
+
+Documentation:
+
+Available with the package (doxygen).
+And in the updated file multi_polynomial_ideal.py, function groebner_basis.
+
+
+Usability:
+
+Can be used in the same way than other algorithms.
+However only the grevlex order is available.
+Detailed in the file multi_polynomial_ideal.py, function groebner_basis.
+
+
+Absence of memory leaks:
+
+Tested with valgrind.
+
+
+Maintainable:
+
+When the Givaro version of Sage will be updated, the package could be build with this dependency in order to handle the prime fields of big characteristics.
+
+
+Portability:
+
+In order to be efficient our package can use the SSE2 and SSE4 extensions (vectorisation).
+This extensions are automatically detected at build time (configure).
+However, even without these optimisations our package is more efficient than the current implemented algorithms in Sage.
+The package was tested on:
+- Ubuntu 12.04 (64 bits)
+- Ubuntu 14.04 (64 bits)
+- Debian 8 (32 bits)
+- Arch Linux (64 bits)
+- Mac OS X Yosemite (64 bits)
+
+
+Reasonable build time, size, dependencies:
+
+If the build time is a problem, examples can be removed from the makefile.am.
+Size: 12Mo
+Dependencies: Givaro is an optional dependency but a recent version is required.
+
+
+Note:
+
+The proposed wrapper in Cython is not very efficient and may be improved:
+for instance, the computation of katsura 12 over GF(4294967291) takes only 2min 11s, 
+and more than 9 min are spent in the cython wrapper to convert the result into sage polynomials.
+

thanks. It would be good to use different numbers for different versions (1.0.0 was already used before, see comment [comment:47]).

+We propose a new C++ library to compute Groebner basis over finite fields with the F4 algorithm.
+This library works on prime fields of characteristic < 2<sup>32</sup>

+
+Memory requirement:
+
+The memory needed by openf4 depends on:
+- the number of variables of the polynomial ring.
+- the (unknown) maximum monomial degree reached during the computation.
+- the (unknown) size of the considered matrices.
+
+Even if our matrices are smaller than the ones of Magma, on cyclic 9 they exceed 70000 x 70000, which requires already around 20 GB on 4 Bytes integers.
+
+
+
+
+Documentation:
+
+Available with the package (doxygen).
+And in the updated file multi_polynomial_ideal.py, function groebner_basis.
+
+
+Usability:
+
+Can be used in the same way than other algorithms.
+However only the grevlex order is available.
+Detailed in the file multi_polynomial_ideal.py, function groebner_basis.
+
+
+Absence of memory leaks:
+
+Tested with valgrind.
+
+
+Maintainable:
+
+When the Givaro version of Sage will be updated, the package could be build with this dependency in order to handle the prime fields of big characteristics.
+
+
+Portability:
+
+In order to be efficient our package can use the SSE2 and SSE4 extensions (vectorisation).
+This extensions are automatically detected at build time (configure).
+However, even without these optimisations our package is more efficient than the current implemented algorithms in Sage.
+The package was tested on:
+- Ubuntu 12.04 (64 bits)
+- Ubuntu 14.04 (64 bits)
+- Debian 8 (32 bits)
+- Arch Linux (64 bits)
+- Mac OS X Yosemite (64 bits)
+
+
+Reasonable build time, size, dependencies:
+
+If the build time is a problem, examples can be removed from the makefile.am.
+Size: 12Mo
+Dependencies: Givaro is an optional dependency but a recent version is required.
+
+
+Note:
+
+The proposed wrapper in Cython is not very efficient and may be improved:
+for instance, the computation of katsura 12 over GF(4294967291) takes only 2min 11s, 
+and more than 9 min are spent in the cython wrapper to convert the result into sage polynomials.

I don't see any easy way to do this after quickly browsing `openf4` source code.

As far as initialization is concerned, the only constructor for polynomials on top of move and copy contructors takes a vector of strings.
You can init an empty polynomial and add terms one at a time but you have to sort the temrs first.

And to extract the result you have to do the same thing.

So my opinion is that such functions should be added to openf4, not the the sage wrapper.
They could for example eat and spit vectors of Element.
