    The actual implementation of `__contains__` for linear codes is quite slow.
    It can be improved using the syndrome computation instead of checking if the vector belongs to a specific subspace of the ambient space.

    Test:

    ```
    F = GF(1009)
    n, k = 1000, 500
    C = codes.RandomLinearCode(n, k, F)
    
    subspace = []
    syndrome = []
    
    for i in range(20):
        c = C.random_element()
        start = time.clock()
        A = C.ambient_space()
        S = A.subspace(C.gens())
        res = S.__contains__(c)
        elapsed = (time.clock() - start)
        assert res == True
        subspace.append(elapsed)
    
        start = time.clock()
        if not c in C.ambient_space() or len(c) != C.length():
            res = False
        else:
            res = (C.syndrome(c) == 0)
        elapsed = (time.clock() - start)
        assert res == True
        syndrome.append(elapsed)
    ```


    Results:

    ```
    sage: median(subspace)
    1.526604500000019
    sage: median(syndrome)
    0.00408399999997755
    ```

An obvious alternative is to use the existing implementation but cache the space `S` for later use. Let's call that solution "sug" (for suggestion), and yours "new".

Now, your tests are not very convincing: you are testing only one set of parameters over one field. And furthermore, you are testing only for the speed of `contains` on codeword - not on non-codewords.

I quickly wrote a more comprehensive set of tests. Here are some timings (`element=True` means that we are testing on codewords, otherwise we test on random elements of the ambient space):

As can be seen, "sug" does much better than "new" when we are testing codewords, except that the first call is sometimes exorbitantly expensive (for high-rate codes). On non-codewords "new" seems to beat "sug" more or less always, but less so on low-rate codes.
