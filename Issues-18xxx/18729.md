Currently if someone were to do:

```
sage: A = matrix([[1, 1, 5], [2, 2, 0]])
sage: g = NormalFormGame([A])
sage: g.obtain_nash(algorithm='garbage')
```
sage just returns with no error raised.
correct output should be:

```
sage: g.obtain_nash(algorithm='garbage')
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: garbage is not a valid algorithm.
```
