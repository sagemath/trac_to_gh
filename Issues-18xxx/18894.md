Its likely that Sage fails to build on many distributions as the developers tend to use a pretty small subset. Also, it is time consuming to ask the few users that **do** complain to upload individual build logs. Instead, logs from failed builds should be uploaded automatically but
* only after sanitizing
* only after asking the user for permission
Compressed logs are about 2M so it is easily doable.

As concrete steps I'm proposing to
* replace `tee` with a python script that logs without spewing forth endless output and sane error propagation
* Only output from **failed** builds (and perhaps hung processes) should ever be dumped to the console
* Logs should always only be a single build log, and never have logs from multiple builds concatenated
* Upon failure, ask the user for permission to upload the logs to our server
* Implement a backend to store the logs
* Implement a webapp to view the logs
* Viewing the logs should be restricted to Sage developers (emails in git commit log), perhaps with the option of being invited by a developer


Depends on #18953

There are several points here I don't agree with or don't understand:
> * Only output from **failed** builds (and perhaps hung processes) should ever be dumped to the console

Why? If people type `make` and they see nothing, they will surely think there is a problem. I think it's good that people see that stuff is happening.
> * replace `tee` with a python script that logs without spewing forth endless output

I guess the "spewing forth endless output" part also refers to not dumping output to the console?
> * Logs should always only be a single build log, and never have logs from multiple builds concatenated

We have logs for individual packages (`logs/pkgs/gap-4.8.4.log`) and one log with everything (`logs/install.log`). Both have reasons to exist (`install.log` can diagnose race conditions in parallel builds).

And all this is obviously too much for one ticket. For example, the part about replacing `tee` should be a ticket by itself.

I don't see the need for this additional complication. Assuming we sanitize the logs and assuming that the user gives permission to make his logs public, what's the problem really?

OK, I see.  I would suggest to keep the logs of the last N builds, for some small value of N.

Are you planning to send an email to sage-devel? I think it should be done, in case people really like their concatenated logs.
