Its likely that Sage fails to build on many distributions as the developers tend to use a pretty small subset. Also, it is time consuming to ask the few users that **do** complain to upload individual build logs. Instead, logs from failed builds should be uploaded automatically but
* only after sanitizing
* only after asking the user for permission
Compressed logs are about 2M so it is easily doable.

As concrete steps I'm proposing to
* replace `tee` with a python script that logs without spewing forth endless output and sane error propagation
* Only output from **failed** builds (and perhaps hung processes) should ever be dumped to the console
* Logs should always only be a single build log, and never have logs from multiple builds concatenated
* Upon failure, ask the user for permission to upload the logs to our server
* Implement a backend to store the logs
* Implement a webapp to view the logs
* Viewing the logs should be restricted to Sage developers (emails in git commit log), perhaps with the option of being invited by a developer

There are several points here I don't agree with or don't understand:
> * Only output from **failed** builds (and perhaps hung processes) should ever be dumped to the console
 
Why? If people type `make` and they see nothing, they will surely think there is a problem. I think it's good that people see that stuff is happening.
> * replace `tee` with a python script that logs without spewing forth endless output
 
I guess the "spewing forth endless output" part also refers to not dumping output to the console?
> * Logs should always only be a single build log, and never have logs from multiple builds concatenated
 
We have logs for individual packages (`logs/pkgs/gap-4.8.4.log`) and one log with everything (`logs/install.log`). Both have reasons to exist (`install.log` can diagnose race conditions in parallel builds).

And all this is obviously too much for one ticket. For example, the part about replacing `tee` should be a ticket by itself.

I don't see the need for this additional complication. Assuming we sanitize the logs and assuming that the user gives permission to make his logs public, what's the problem really?

Are you planning to send an email to sage-devel? I think it should be done, in case people really like their concatenated logs.
