Nicely done.

May be you could combine methods  `dominator_tree_dictionary` and `dominator_tree` using an optional parameter (e.g., `return_dict=False`) ?

Actually I don't know which is the most useful: the tree or the dictionary.

Also, I suggest

```
- edges = [[v,dom_tree_dict[v]] for v in dom_tree_dict.keys() if dom_tree_dict[v] is not None]
+ edges = [[v,dom_v] for v,dom_v in dom_tree_dict.iteritems() if not dom_v is None]
```

Also, you do not need to write two functions (with doc+test) when everything it does is call another function defined outside, in a module. You will find many such examples at the bottom of `generic_graph.py`.

Install OK, docbuild OK, doc looks good.

However, I have questions on the expected behavior:
- with 1-vertex graph:

```
sage: G = graphs.PathGraph(1)
sage: G.dominator_tree(0)
{0: None}
sage: G.dominator_tree(0, return_dict=False)
Graph on 0 vertices
```
- With disconnected graphs

```
sage: G = 2 * graphs.PathGraph(1)
sage: G.dominator_tree(0)
{0: None, 1: None}
sage: G = 2 * graphs.PathGraph(2)
sage: G.dominator_tree(0)
{0: None, 1: 0, 2: None, 3: None}
```
If this is effectively what we expect, then I will finalize the review.

Helloooooo again,

Is there any reason why you kept two functions with the same name (dominator_tree)? If you moved the 'graph output' to the one defined in `boost_graph.pyx`, you would only have to import it in the `GenericGraph` object. No duplication of doc/doctest.

You are right, if the dominator tree is empty (that is, if from the root we cannot reach any other vertex) it is better to output a 1-vertex graph containing the root, not an empty graph. For the dictionary, I think the behavior is correct.

Here, the behavior is correct, in my opinion. I have changed the doc to better explain this case, by adding an "OUTPUT" block.

You mean that I should move all the code in boost_graph.pyx, and then import this function through something like

`GenericGraph.dominator_tree = types.MethodType(sage.graphs.base.boost_graph.dominator_tree(GenericGraph, ???))`

Could you tell me the exact command? The three examples I have found in `generic_graph.py` do not have arguments...

Hellooooooo!

I have done it, but there is a problem: in order to obtain this result, `generic_graph` should import `boost_graph`, which imports `directed_graph`, which imports `generic_graph`, and I have cyclic dependencies. I tried to put

```
import types
from sage.graphs.generic_graph import GenericGraph
GenericGraph.dominator_tree = types.MethodType(dominator_tree, None, GenericGraph)
```
inside boost_graph, but it is not imported when Sage starts, so I have to import boost_graph before running dominator_tree (and I don't like it). Any suggestion?

This is weird since for instance the `distances_all_pairs` module imports `Graph` many times.

Could you try the following: in the `boost_graph.pyx` file, move the `from sage.graphs.graph import Graph` statement inside all the methods using it. Same for `DiGraph` etc.

Now it's working and I'm trying to understand the expected behavior of the method.

- is it normal that the resulting tree is always a star ?

```
sage: G = graphs.RandomBarabasiAlbert(1000,2)
sage: H = G.dominator_tree(0, return_dict=False)
sage: H.is_tree() and H.diameter()<=2
True
sage: H = G.dominator_tree(193, return_dict=False)
sage: H.is_tree() and H.diameter()<=2
True
```


- I suggest to set parameter `return_dict=False` by default. Well I don't know which is the most useful

- There is a labeling problem with the root.

```
sage: G = graphs.Grid2dGraph(4,4)
sage: G.dominator_tree((0,0), return_dict=False).vertices()
[0,
 (0, 1),
 (0, 2),
 (0, 3),
 (1, 0),
 (1, 1),
 (1, 2),
 (1, 3),
 (2, 0),
 (2, 1),
 (2, 2),
 (2, 3),
 (3, 0),
 (3, 1),
 (3, 2),
 (3, 3)]
sage: G.dominator_tree((1,1), return_dict=False).vertices()
[5,
 (0, 0),
 (0, 1),
 (0, 2),
 (0, 3),
 (1, 0),
 (1, 2),
 (1, 3),
 (2, 0),
 (2, 1),
 (2, 2),
 (2, 3),
 (3, 0),
 (3, 1),
 (3, 2),
 (3, 3)]
```

- Try also this. The output digraph is not connected and you have some labeling problems.

```
sage: D = digraphs.DeBruijn(2,4)
sage: D.dominator_tree('0000', return_dict=False).show()
```

David.

Yes, it is: if the input is undirected, the dominator tree is a star if and only the if the graph is biconnected. In a Barabasi-Albert graph, the minimum degree is 2, so I believe it is.

Yes, you are right, I did not "translate" properly the Boost vertices into Sage labels. I have corrected that line and I have added a test to check that the translation is correct. The new line is:

```
edges = [[int_to_vertex[result[vertex_to_int[v]]], v] for v in g.vertices() if result[vertex_to_int[v]] != no_parent]
```
Thank you very much!

So for undirected graphs, we can first test if is it connected. If true, then we can directly construct and return the star (or the dict) without using boost, right? If False, then what's the output ?

What for directed graphs?

> In any case, probably the dominator tree in the undirected case can be found by computing biconnected components and cut vertices. There is a linear algorithm for biconnected components, but it is not very easy to implement, and the Boost algorithm is O(m log m), which is not much worse than O(m). Is the linear algorithm for BCC implemented in the hyperbolicity algorithm?


For undirected graphs, we have `B,C = G.blocks_and_cut_vertices()`, where `B` is the list of blocks (list of vertices of each biconnected component) and `C` is the list of cut vertices. It's a Python implementation, but it's efficient. We use it for the hyperbolicity and many other algorithms.

However, now that I have a better understanding of the method, I think it is better to let it as it is. So improve the doc and it should be ok.

David.

Helloooooo!

I have made a small modification in the Boost interface: now the Boost graph "knows" (through a vertex_property) the number associated to each vertex. This way, if the result is an vector, where in position i there is a property of vertex i, this vector is generated directly from Boost, without conversion.

However, after this modification, I think this patch needs a new review, at least for this part.

Thank you very much!

Michele

PS: I still have no idea on how to test 32bit Sagemath, and I hope modifying the vertex name from unsigned int to int worked! Anyone is able to test it?

For me the patch is good to go.
I tried the patch successfully using an old computer on which I can only use cplex 32bits and not cplex 64bits. So I assume it is 32bits... 
I cannot do better test.
