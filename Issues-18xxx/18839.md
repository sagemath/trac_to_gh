<a id='comment:6'></a>Nicely done.

May be you could combine methods  `dominator_tree_dictionary` and `dominator_tree` using an optional parameter (e.g., `return_dict=False`) ?

Actually I don't know which is the most useful: the tree or the dictionary.

Also, I suggest

```
- edges = [[v,dom_tree_dict[v]] for v in dom_tree_dict.keys() if dom_tree_dict[v] is not None]
+ edges = [[v,dom_v] for v,dom_v in dom_tree_dict.iteritems() if not dom_v is None]

<a id='comment:10'></a>Install OK, docbuild OK, doc looks good.

However, I have questions on the expected behavior:
- with 1-vertex graph:

```
sage: G = graphs.PathGraph(1)
sage: G.dominator_tree(0)
{0: None}
sage: G.dominator_tree(0, return_dict=False)
Graph on 0 vertices
```
- With disconnected graphs

```
sage: G = 2 * graphs.PathGraph(1)
sage: G.dominator_tree(0)
{0: None, 1: None}
sage: G = 2 * graphs.PathGraph(2)
sage: G.dominator_tree(0)
{0: None, 1: 0, 2: None, 3: None}
```
If this is effectively what we expect, then I will finalize the review.

You are right, if the dominator tree is empty (that is, if from the root we cannot reach any other vertex) it is better to output a 1-vertex graph containing the root, not an empty graph. For the dictionary, I think the behavior is correct.

Here, the behavior is correct, in my opinion. I have changed the doc to better explain this case, by adding an "OUTPUT" block.

I have done it, but there is a problem: in order to obtain this result, `generic_graph` should import `boost_graph`, which imports `directed_graph`, which imports `generic_graph`, and I have cyclic dependencies. I tried to put

```
import types
from sage.graphs.generic_graph import GenericGraph
GenericGraph.dominator_tree = types.MethodType(dominator_tree, None, GenericGraph)
```
inside boost_graph, but it is not imported when Sage starts, so I have to import boost_graph before running dominator_tree (and I don't like it). Any suggestion?

<a id='comment:20'></a>Helloooooo!

Thank you very much: it worked! Now, I have rebased all my commits, so that the history of generic_graph is correct, and I have moved everything to boost_graph.

<a id='comment:27'></a>Now it's working and I'm trying to understand the expected behavior of the method.

- is it normal that the resulting tree is always a star ?

```
sage: G = graphs.RandomBarabasiAlbert(1000,2)
sage: H = G.dominator_tree(0, return_dict=False)
sage: H.is_tree() and H.diameter()<=2
True
sage: H = G.dominator_tree(193, return_dict=False)
sage: H.is_tree() and H.diameter()<=2
True
```


- I suggest to set parameter `return_dict=False` by default. Well I don't know which is the most useful

- There is a labeling problem with the root.

```
sage: G = graphs.Grid2dGraph(4,4)
sage: G.dominator_tree((0,0), return_dict=False).vertices()
[0,
 (0, 1),
 (0, 2),
 (0, 3),
 (1, 0),
 (1, 1),
 (1, 2),
 (1, 3),
 (2, 0),
 (2, 1),
 (2, 2),
 (2, 3),
 (3, 0),
 (3, 1),
 (3, 2),
 (3, 3)]
sage: G.dominator_tree((1,1), return_dict=False).vertices()
[5,
 (0, 0),
 (0, 1),
 (0, 2),
 (0, 3),
 (1, 0),
 (1, 2),

 (2, 1),
 (2, 2),
 (2, 3),
 (3, 0),
 (3, 1),
 (3, 2),
 (3, 3)]
```

- Try also this. The output digraph is not connected and you have some labeling problems.

```
sage: D = digraphs.DeBruijn(2,4)
sage: D.dominator_tree('0000', return_dict=False).show()
```

Yes, it is: if the input is undirected, the dominator tree is a star if and only the if the graph is biconnected. In a Barabasi-Albert graph, the minimum degree is 2, so I believe it is.

Yes, you are right, I did not "translate" properly the Boost vertices into Sage labels. I have corrected that line and I have added a test to check that the translation is correct. The new line is:

```
edges = [[int_to_vertex[result[vertex_to_int[v]]], v] for v in g.vertices() if result[vertex_to_int[v]] != no_parent]

OK, I see. Could you mention this in the description of the method? and perhaps add a simple example of a graph with 2 biconnected components. For Instance

```
sage: G = 2*graphs.CycleGraph(3)
sage: G.add_edge(0,3)
sage: G.dominator_tree(0, return_dict=True)
{0: None, 1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 0, 4: 3, 5: 3}
```

<a id='comment:41'></a>Helloooooo!

I have made a small modification in the Boost interface: now the Boost graph "knows" (through a vertex_property) the number associated to each vertex. This way, if the result is an vector, where in position i there is a property of vertex i, this vector is generated directly from Boost, without conversion.

However, after this modification, I think this patch needs a new review, at least for this part.

Thank you very much!

Michele

PS: I still have no idea on how to test 32bit Sagemath, and I hope modifying the vertex name from unsigned int to int worked! Anyone is able to test it?

I tried the patch successfully using an old computer on which I can only use cplex 32bits and not cplex 64bits. So I assume it is 32bits... 
I cannot do better test.
