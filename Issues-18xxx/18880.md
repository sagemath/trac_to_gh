Starting with 6.8beta8, these two doctests :

```
sage -t --long --warn-long 65.9 src/sage/groups/perm_gps/permgroup_named.py  # 2 doctests failed
sage -t --long --warn-long 65.9 src/sage/tests/gap_packages.py  # 1 doctest failed
```
fail with `database_gap` installed but succeed after installation of `gap_packages`.
