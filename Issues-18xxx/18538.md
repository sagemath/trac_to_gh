As reported in [this ask question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/26950/range-xrange-and-ellipsis-iteration/), there is a problem with `ellipsis_iter`:


```
sage: r = lambda n: (n-(n%2))//2
sage: for n in range(6):
....:     print([r(n-k) + r(n+k) for k in (-n..n)])
AttributeError: 'xrange' object has no attribute 'next'
```

This is due to the fact that, while `xsrange` claims to return an iterator, it does not provide a `.next()` method when called with Python ints or longs:

```
sage: xsrange(int(42)).next()
AttributeError: 'xrange' object has no attribute 'next'
```

This is because in those cases, it returns an `xrange` object (which is only an iterable).

<a id='comment:10'></a>Hello,

Why `xsrange` should have a `next` method?

```
sage: next(xrange(10))
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: xrange object is not an iterator
```
I think that we should keep compatibility between `xsrange` and `xrange`.

```
``.next()`` or a ``.__next__()`` method
```
should be replaced by

```
``.__next__()`` method
```
