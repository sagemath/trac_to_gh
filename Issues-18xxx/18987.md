The following computation takes a lot of time:

```
sage: from sage.games.quantumino import QuantuminoSolver
sage: QuantuminoSolver(0).number_of_solutions()  # long time (several days)
```

but we can make it faster by doing the computation in parallel... This ticket does this (directly in the dancing links code).

<a id='comment:9'></a>Salut Sebastien,

Do you mind if I rebase over 6.9.beta1? Note that I also have a waiting commit that does some tiny optimization to `dancing_links.pyx`.

I am not sure the overall strategy is the good one. If parallelization is needed I guess that it should better be implemented at the level of dancing links. Googling "parallelization dancing links" already gives a lot of things.

Less importantly:
- I do not understand the name of the function `orthogonal_transformation`. Are these the orthogonal transformations of `R^3` with integer coordinates? If so, please write more precise specifications.

- As far as I see, you do not test all cases of the function `orthogonal_transformation`.

- What is the `modpi` arguments. What is a rotation of angle `pi` for you? Is it a linear transformation that is a pi-rotation restricted on a plane and leaves invariant the orthogonal complement? (I guess it should also have integer coordinates) If this is, then it is of course not a group... but of course you might consider the group generated by these.

Vincent

Merge or rebase? I prefer if you merge. Or I can rebase on 6.9.beta1 to keep the authorship (right?).

Indeed, I am using a parallelization strategy that applies to a tiling problem where each piece is used only once. This strategy obviously does not apply to the general problem that is the Exact cover problem.

Also, I prefered to cut the (tiling) problem into subproblems that takes at most 2-3 hours each so that I can more easily follow the process of the computation and stop and restart the computation more easily. Even with a parallel implementation of dancing links, the computation would take days to finish.

This strategy obviously does not apply to the general problem that is the Exact cover problem.\n\n\nIn the exact cover problem, each subset is used at most once. In your tiling formulation a piece count for several subsets. You can naively apply the same thing for dancing links: look at one position `i0` and consider the set `S0` of subsets that cover it. For each subset in `S0`, launch a thread where you only run through the subproblem that consists of having fixed this subset.\n\nBut I guess that there exists less naive parallelization.\n\n> Also, I prefered to cut the (tiling) problem into subproblems that takes at most 2-3 hours each so that I can more easily follow the process of the computation and stop and restart the computation more easily. Even with a parallel implementation of dancing links, the computation would take days to finish.\n\n\nWhy? If your parallization ends with a time better than `total_time / nb_cpus` then you should parallelize more often ;-)\n\nVincent",

The autorship of what? If I do a rebase, you keep the autorship of commits. But of course it will be my branch (or a public one).

I do prefer rebase over merge because:
- history is much cleaner afterwards (fewer commits that follow each other)
- you can hide whatever you want in a merge commit

On my computer ;-) It is waiting for the rebase or merge.

In the exact cover problem, each subset is used at most once. In your tiling formulation a piece count for several subsets. You can naively apply the same thing for dancing links: look at one position `i0` and consider the set `S0` of subsets that cover it. For each subset in `S0`, launch a thread where you only run through the subproblem that consists of having fixed this subset.

But I guess that there exists less naive parallelization.

> Also, I prefered to cut the (tiling) problem into subproblems that takes at most 2-3 hours each so that I can more easily follow the process of the computation and stop and restart the computation more easily. Even with a parallel implementation of dancing links, the computation would take days to finish.


Why? If your parallization ends with a time better than `total_time / nb_cpus` then you should parallelize more often ;-)

I chose that name 3 years ago. I agree it was not the best function name.

Your comments are very good. The reason that things are not clearly written is that it is not clear enough in my head. Let me sleep this night and I will come back on this tomorrow or later this week.

When `modpi=True`, I (think! I) want to quotient the result by the group generated by the diagonal matrices of 1's and -1's with exactly two -1 on the diagonal. Only, when the dimension is 3, I was able to generate representative of the classes easily.

<a id='comment:29'></a>> A bit. What do you mean by `the rectangular parallelepiped`? There is only one? 


Of course the length of the side can change, so there is more than one. But, of course, I consider the case where the length of the sides are all distinct.

You understand well.

Yes.

> And as before, this is the group *generated* by these rotation and not only thes rotations themselves (except in dim 2 and 3).


Of course. "modpi" is in the sense of modulo a group.

> Isn't this group exactly the subgroup of matrices with an even number of `-1` on the diagonal? 


Yes.

> So the quotient is just the signed permutation matrices with either `0` or `1` coefficient `-1` (all others being `1`). Isn't it?


Maybe. When the dimension is odd, the quotient is the signed permutation matrices where the signs is either all positive or all negative with determinant 1. That is the formula that I was using.

> When `orientation_preserving` is `False` I guess this group is the subgroup of matrices with any number of `-1` on the diagonal. In that case, the quotient would just be the permutation matrices. No?


Yes! You are right.

Ok, now I understand why I needed it that way. I need well-chosen representatives for the quotient. By this, I mean that the chosen representatives of the cosets form a group itself.

For example, these representatives do not form a group:

```
sage: n = 3
sage: c = identity_matrix(n)
sage: c[0,0] = -1
sage: L = [w.matrix() for w in WeylGroup(['A', n-1])]
sage: L = [(w if w.det() == 1 else c*w) for w in L]
[
[1 0 0]  [ 0  0 -1]  [0 0 1]  [ 0 -1  0]  [0 1 0]  [-1  0  0]
[0 1 0]  [ 0  1  0]  [1 0 0]  [ 1  0  0]  [0 0 1]  [ 0  0  1]
[0 0 1], [ 1  0  0], [0 1 0], [ 0  0  1], [1 0 0], [ 0  1  0]
]
sage: MatrixGroup(L).cardinality()
24
```

But these representatives forms a group:

```
sage: L = [w.matrix() for w in WeylGroup(['A', n-1])]
sage: L = [m.det() * m for m in L]
sage: L
[
[1 0 0]  [ 0  0 -1]  [0 0 1]  [ 0 -1  0]  [0 1 0]  [-1  0  0]
[0 1 0]  [ 0 -1  0]  [1 0 0]  [-1  0  0]  [0 0 1]  [ 0  0 -1]
[0 0 1], [-1  0  0], [0 1 0], [ 0  0 -1], [1 0 0], [ 0 -1  0]
]
sage: MatrixGroup(L).cardinality()
6
```

And I still don't know how to construct the quotient when n is even.

<a id='comment:33'></a>> Ok, now I understand why I needed it that way.


Wait. I really need the quotient itself finally. I was just lucky that the transformation keeping some the pentamino invariant was in the group.

```

    sage: from sage.combinat.tiling import ncube_isometry_group
    sage: from sage.games.quantumino import pentaminos
    sage: L = ncube_isometry_group(3)
    sage: f = lambda p : [m for m in L[1:] if (m*p).canonical() == p.canonical()]
    sage: [(i, f(p)) for i,p in enumerate(pentaminos) if f(p)]
    [(6, [
    [ 0  0 -1]
    [ 0 -1  0]
    [-1  0  0]
    ]),
     (7, [
    [ 0  0  1]
    [ 0 -1  0]
    [ 1  0  0]
    ]),
     (12, [
    [-1  0  0]
    [ 0  0 -1]
    [ 0 -1  0]
    ]),
     (13, [
    [ 0  0 -1]
    [ 0 -1  0]
    [-1  0  0]
    ]),
     (16, [
    [ 0  0 -1]
    [ 0 -1  0]
    [-1  0  0]
    ])]
```

Above, I get a problem with pentamino number 7 because it is invariant under a transformation that is not in the subgroup isomorphic to the quotient. So I really need to consider the quotient with all of the elements in each coset. Chosing a representative won't work even if it is well chosen.

Give me more time. I'll update my branch.

<a id='comment:42'></a>Are you sure `ncube_isometry_group` is worth a ``@`cached_function`?

In `ncube_isometry_group_modpi` why are you building `MatrixGroup`?

In

```
P_coset = set(frozenset((m.matrix() * self).canonical() for m in coset) for coset in L)
return set(next(iter(s)) for s in P_coset)
```
You are building a lot of images to consider `matrix x polyomino` to use just one at the end. Why not

```
return set((L[0].matrix() * self).canonical() for coset in L)
```
And if you were not using matrix groups you can even do

```
return set((L[0] * self).canonical() for coset in L)
```

Calling this function takes 2.8s on my machine. And it is called once for each polyomino. That is 16 times for the Quantumino puzzle. With the cache, I gain about 40s to construct the rows to give to the dlx solver.

> In `ncube_isometry_group_modpi` why are you building `MatrixGroup`?


Because otherwise, this

```
G = ncube_isometry_group(n, orientation_preserving)
H = [h for h in G if all(i==j for (i,j) in h.nonzero_positions())]
left_cosets = set(tuple(sorted(h*g for h in H)) for g in G)
```

throws a `TypeError: mutable matrices are unhashable` and I find it more fun to read like this instead of the `.set_immutable()` on every matrices.

I know but I need all of them. That is what I understood yesterday. Let me try to explain. In general it is okay to take only one matrix in the coset. The problem comes when the polyomino is invariant under some of the 24 orientation preserving isometries of the cube. For example, consider:

```
sage: from sage.games.quantumino import pentaminos                                  
sage: from sage.combinat.tiling import ncube_isometry_group                         
sage: p = pentaminos[7]                                                             
sage: m = ncube_isometry_group(3)[-3]                                               
sage: p                                                                             
Polyomino: [(0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 2, 0), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 0)], Color: orange   
sage: m                                                                             
[ 0  0  1]                                                                          
[ 0 -1  0]                                                                          
[ 1  0  0]                                                                          
sage: (m*p).canonical() == p                                                        
True                                                                                
```

The polyomino `p` has 12 distinct rotation images instead of 24. And among the 12 ways of placing that polyomino into a box, there are 3 distinct ways up to rotation of the box keeping the box invariant. To compute this, we need to consider the whole coset:

```
sage: cosets = ncube_isometry_group_modpi(3)
sage: P_coset = set(frozenset((m.matrix() * p).canonical() for m in coset) for coset in cosets)
sage: len(P_coset)                         
3   
sage: len(set(next(iter(s)) for s in P_coset))
3                                                                                          
```

Otherwise, you obtain too many polyominos (see below).

```
sage: set((coset[0].matrix() * p).canonical() for coset in cosets)                 
{Polyomino: [(0, 0, 1), (1, 0, 1), (1, 1, 1), (1, 2, 0), (1, 2, 1)], Color: orange,
 Polyomino: [(0, 1, 2), (1, 0, 0), (1, 1, 0), (1, 1, 1), (1, 1, 2)], Color: orange,
 Polyomino: [(0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (1, 1, 0), (2, 1, 0), (2, 1, 1)], Color: orange,
 Polyomino: [(0, 1, 0), (0, 1, 1), (1, 1, 1), (2, 0, 1), (2, 1, 1)], Color: orange,
 Polyomino: [(0, 2, 0), (1, 0, 0), (1, 0, 1), (1, 1, 0), (1, 2, 0)], Color: orange}
```

Perhaps the way it is implemented is wrong. For example

```
sage: %timeit P = [s.matrix() for s in SymmetricGroup(4)]
1 loops, best of 3: 1.27 ms per loop
```
and with the signs

```
sage: from itertools import product
sage: %timeit M = [diagonal_matrix(p) for p in product([1,-1], repeat=4)]
1 loops, best of 3: 2.9 ms per loop
sage: M = [diagonal_matrix(p) for p in product([1,-1], repeat=4)]
sage: %timeit S = [m*s.matrix() for m in M for s in SymmetricGroup(4)]
100 loops, best of 3: 18.3 ms per loop
```
So it is likely to be `~20ms`.

In fact, you make me realize that there is already caching involved in WeylGroup. Therefore caching that function is not so necessary. Without caching, I get:

```
sage: from sage.combinat.tiling import ncube_isometry_group
sage: time L = ncube_isometry_group(4)             
CPU times: user 1.14 s, sys: 19.7 ms, total: 1.16 s
Wall time: 1.3 s                                   
sage: time L = ncube_isometry_group(4)             
CPU times: user 358 ms, sys: 4.01 ms, total: 362 ms
Wall time: 448 ms                                      
```

Note that you can't use timeit above since there is caching involved in SymmetricGroup.

For comparison, your solution on my machine gives the following timings:

```python
sage: from itertools import product   
sage: # first call                                 
sage: time M = [diagonal_matrix(p) for p in product([1,-1], repeat=4)] 
CPU times: user 11.4 ms, sys: 92 µs, total: 11.5 ms                    
Wall time: 11.9 ms                                                     
sage: time S = [m*s.matrix() for m in M for s in SymmetricGroup(4)]    
CPU times: user 191 ms, sys: 25.2 ms, total: 216 ms                    
Wall time: 667 ms                                                      
sage: # second call
sage: time M = [diagonal_matrix(p) for p in product([1,-1], repeat=4)]
CPU times: user 11.7 ms, sys: 1.34 ms, total: 13 ms                   
Wall time: 16.6 ms                                                    
sage: time S = [m*s.matrix() for m in M for s in SymmetricGroup(4)]   
CPU times: user 108 ms, sys: 1.92 ms, total: 110 ms                   
Wall time: 114 ms                                                     
```

So it seems using `WeylGroup(['B',4])` is about 4 times slower than your solution. But I don't know if I will change it. I mean that improvement could be done directly in `WeylGroup` code...

Don't you get that the first execution of

sage: time S = [m*s.matrix() for m in M for s in SymmetricGroup(4)]
```
is slower than the second? And that the second takes about the same time than the third, the fourth, etc. ? Like me:

Nope. I also the think that the `WeylGroup` code has to be improved.

> Also, for timing improvements in that file `tiling.py`, there is a another more important thing to spend time on because a lot of time is spent creating vectors from tuple (because coordinates are stored as tuple). This should be done in another ticket.


Did you notice that

```
sage: t = map(vector, t)
```
is much slower than

```
sage: V = FreeModule(ZZ,12)
sage: t = map(V,t)
```
(I measure a factor x8 in `__sub__` and `__add__` for example)

Moreover, everything would be faster if you would store integer vectors instead of tuples (and an attribute `self._free_module`). Why aren't you doing that?

<a id='comment:65'></a>- `(solving) independant (cases)` -> `independent`
- I do not understand this comment

```
If possible, a good choice of column gives a partition
of solutions where each part has about the same number
of solutions.
```
- could you make a complete sentence for the `OUTPUT` section instead of `dict, row number -> list of rows`
- this is not quite accurate

```
After the split each subproblem has the same number of columns and
rows and the same solutions as above::
```
  it is the union of solutions of the subproblems that form the solution of the initial one.
- I do not see the point of having `number_of_solutions_iterator` and `number_of_solutions`. You should just get rid of the first one and allow parallelization in the second.
- Why not also make available parallelization for getting the list of solutions?

  - `number_of_solutions_iterator` is now `_number_of_solutions_iterator`
  - `number_of_solutions` now allows parallel computation
  - I kept `_number_of_solutions_iterator` because for the problem I am currently looking at, `number_of_solutions` takes days while `_number_of_solutions_iterator`  yield something once every hours.
