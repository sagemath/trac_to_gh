`sage.rings.quotient_ring.QuotientRing` and
`sage.modules.with_basis.subquotient.QuotientModuleWithBasis` are two
implementations of quotient that share some common features.

In both cases, the algorithmic relies on having a reduce method for
the submodule/ideal one is quotienting by: the reduce method
shall be a additive linear map on the ambient module so that

```
    reduce(x) == reduce(y) iff x==y [submodule]
```
This algorithmic part would be valid for any module. Actually for any
commutative additive group.

On the other hand, the data structures differ: in `QuotientRing`
elements are represented by wrapping element of the ambient space. In
`QuotientModuleWithBasis`, the indexing set of a subset `B` of the
basis of ``self`` that spans some supplementary of ``submodule`` is
determined explicitly (user-specified or computed). Elements are
represented in the module spanned by those indices. Depending on the
context both data structures can be helpful.

TODO:

- Generalize `QuotientRing` to `QuotientXXX` to handle any commutative
  additive group. Update the `quotient` method accordingly, and add an
  option to choose the data structure when relevant.

- Let `QuotientModuleWithBasis` inherit from the above.

- Get all the additional structure (quotient ring, ...) from the
  categories `(Rings().Quotient(), ...)`.

- Explore if some of the other existing implementation of quotients in
  Sage could be refactored and simplified.
