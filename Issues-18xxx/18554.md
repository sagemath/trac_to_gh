Use of `string` module functions like `join()` must be replaced by the corresponding `string` methods.

`from string import join` will fail. Those imports must be removed.

Uses like `print(string.join(a_list)` must be changed to `print("".join(a_list)`.

The following functions are removed:

```
capitalize|center|count|expandtabs|find|index|join|
ljust|lower|lstrip|maketrans|replace|rfind|rindex|rjust|rsplit|
rstrip|split|strip|swapcase|translate|upper|zfill
```
