Currently, the element method `is_real_root()` of root_lattice_realizations.py is not quite correct. It checks only if `norm_squared()` is positive. This is correct in a root system, but not when in the root lattice. We can add an additional check in this situation: see Proposition 5.10b in Kac's book.

```
sage: R = RootSystem(['A',1,1])
sage: Q = R.root_lattice()
sage: alpha = Q.simple_roots()
sage: beta = 3*alpha[0] + alpha[1] # not a root
sage: beta.norm_squared()
8
sage: beta.is_real_root()
True
```

```
sage: R = RootSystem("A2")
sage: Q = R.root_lattice()
sage: alpha = Q.simple_roots()
sage: beta = 2*alpha[1] + alpha[2] # not a root
sage: beta.norm_squared()
6
sage: beta.is_real_root()
True
```

Updated: Kac's Proposition 5.10b applies to finite, affine, and hyperbolic types. Ticket #18645 implements the checks for these. More generally, the correct check for a real root is to see if its ` norm_squared() ` is positive and if its multiplicity (#18000) is positive.
