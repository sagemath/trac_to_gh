Hashing is a critical function in Python. In several places, objects do use the generic `__hash__` from `SageObject` or a badly implemented one that makes everything slow. For example:
- #18215 for quadratic number field elements (in relation with polyhedra #18241)
- #18239 for permutation group elements

See also #19016 for a ticket with the same purpose (with `Element` instead of `SageObject`).

Because `UniqueRepresentation` provides a hash that is fast and appropriate and `Parent` doesn't:

```
sage: Parent.__hash__
<slot wrapper '__hash__' of 'sage.structure.category_object.CategoryObject' objects>
sage: UniqueRepresentation.__hash__
<slot wrapper '__hash__' of 'sage.misc.fast_methods.WithEqualityById' objects>
```
In order to get the MRO right, `UniqueRepresentation` needs to appear before Parent:

```
sage: class A(UniqueRepresentation, Parent): pass
sage: A.__hash__
<slot wrapper '__hash__' of 'sage.misc.fast_methods.WithEqualityById' objects>
sage: class B(Parent, UniqueRepresentation): pass
sage: B.__hash__
<slot wrapper '__hash__' of 'sage.structure.category_object.CategoryObject' objects>
```

Once all default hashes have been deleted and no classes in the MRO of Parent offer a hash function, the order doesn't matter. Until then, `UniqueRepresentation` has to come first.

The code is hard to follow, but in general, if enumeration somewhere involves a set or a dictionary, then results depend heavily on the hash used and the order in which the dictionary was constructed. I'd expect that a changed hash causes things to be enumerated in a different order (because a set or dict is storing its entries in a different order somewhere)
