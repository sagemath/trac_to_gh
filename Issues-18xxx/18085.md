```
The following integral cannot be evaluated by maxima:

```
sage: integrate(1/sqrt(1+x^3),x)
integrate(1/sqrt(x^3 + 1), x)
```
With 'sympy' algorithm the computation fails:

```
sage: integrate(1/sqrt(1+x^3),x,algorithm='sympy')
...
AttributeError: 'gamma' object has no attribute '_sage_'
```

However, SymPy can compute the integral and gives the result in terms of gamma and hypergeometric functions:

```
sage: import sympy
sage: sympy.integrate(1/sqrt(1+x**3))
x*gamma(1/3)*hyper((1/3, 1/2), (4/3,), x**3*exp_polar(I*pi))/(3*gamma(4/3))
```
It can be seen that not only `gamma` is a problem (already fixed in sympy master) but also `exp_polar` which Sage does not know.

This ticket should track the status of the Sympy pull request fixing the `exp_polar` issue, and it should implement a skeleton `exp_polar` on the Sage side.

Depends on #20185

The problem actually does occur in Sympy code...

```
sage: import sympy
sage: s = sympy.gamma(1/3)
sage: s._sage_()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: 'gamma' object has no attribute '_sage_'
```

Would you like to make a bug report in Sympy? Either on

After some more digging it turned out the this is almost OK in the most recent git version of Sympy (not 0.7.6 which is shipped with Sage). Class Function [has a `_sage_` method](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/blob/master/sympy/core/function.py#L679) and hypergeometric function `hyper` is also [correctly dealt with](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/blob/master/sympy/functions/special/hyper.py#L306).

However, the example mentioned above still fails because Sage does not know `exp_polar` function. I have created [this pull request](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/9224) which adds `_sage_` method to `exp_polar` and returns the usual exponential.

I have doctested the function with git version of Sympy and all tests passed (especially the one with integration). I guess we have to wait for a new version of Sympy to arrive in Sage (probably Sympy 0.7.7).

Anyway, this is my first attempt to contribute to Sage, so feel free to knitpick.

I have one question. How complicated it would be to force Sage to perform simplifications like 

```
sage: exp_polar(2 + 5*I)*exp_polar(5 - I)
exp_polar(7 + 4*I)
```
My current understanding is that such simplifications are taken care of by an external library ( Pynac ) and there is no way how to do this in Sage alone, am I right?
