```
The following integral cannot be evaluated by maxima:

```
sage: integrate(1/sqrt(1+x^3),x)
integrate(1/sqrt(x^3 + 1), x)
```
With 'sympy' algorithm the computation fails:

```
sage: integrate(1/sqrt(1+x^3),x,algorithm='sympy')
...
AttributeError: 'gamma' object has no attribute '_sage_'
```

However, SymPy can compute the integral and gives the result in terms of gamma and hypergeometric functions:

```
sage: import sympy
sage: sympy.integrate(1/sqrt(1+x**3))
x*gamma(1/3)*hyper((1/3, 1/2), (4/3,), x**3*exp_polar(I*pi))/(3*gamma(4/3))
```
It can be seen that not only `gamma` is a problem (already fixed in sympy master) but also `exp_polar` which Sage does not know.

This ticket should track the status of the Sympy pull request fixing the `exp_polar` issue, and it should implement a skeleton `exp_polar` on the Sage side.

I have one question. How complicated it would be to force Sage to perform simplifications like 

```
sage: exp_polar(2 + 5*I)*exp_polar(5 - I)
exp_polar(7 + 4*I)
```
My current understanding is that such simplifications are taken care of by an external library ( Pynac ) and there is no way how to do this in Sage alone, am I right?

Yes, other tickets are waiting for that too.

I think so, but I'm not much into Pynac. Anyway, it could be part of Python Sage by including a function that does it in one of the `Expression.simplify*` methods.
