```
The following integral cannot be evaluated by maxima:

```
sage: integrate(1/sqrt(1+x^3),x)
integrate(1/sqrt(x^3 + 1), x)
```
With 'sympy' algorithm the computation fails:

```
sage: integrate(1/sqrt(1+x^3),x,algorithm='sympy')
...
AttributeError: 'gamma' object has no attribute '_sage_'
```

However, SymPy can compute the integral and gives the result in terms of gamma and hypergeometric functions:

```
sage: import sympy
sage: sympy.integrate(1/sqrt(1+x**3))
x*gamma(1/3)*hyper((1/3, 1/2), (4/3,), x**3*exp_polar(I*pi))/(3*gamma(4/3))
```
It can be seen that not only `gamma` is a problem (already fixed in sympy master) but also `exp_polar` which Sage does not know.

This ticket should track the status of the Sympy pull request fixing the `exp_polar` issue, and it should implement a skeleton `exp_polar` on the Sage side.

The problem actually does occur in Sympy code...

```
sage: import sympy
sage: s = sympy.gamma(1/3)
sage: s._sage_()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: 'gamma' object has no attribute '_sage_'
```

Would you like to make a bug report in Sympy? Either on

I have doctested the function with git version of Sympy and all tests passed (especially the one with integration). I guess we have to wait for a new version of Sympy to arrive in Sage (probably Sympy 0.7.7).

Anyway, this is my first attempt to contribute to Sage, so feel free to knitpick.

I have one question. How complicated it would be to force Sage to perform simplifications like 

```
sage: exp_polar(2 + 5*I)*exp_polar(5 - I)
exp_polar(7 + 4*I)
```
My current understanding is that such simplifications are taken care of by an external library ( Pynac ) and there is no way how to do this in Sage alone, am I right?

Thanks for your contribution. There were some minor problems requiring changes which I have added: removed the warning (because this ticket is pending Sympy-0.7.7 anyway), and adapted a bit to PEP 8. Documentation is fine, tests pass, so there is no reason to hold this back. If you agree with my changes you can set positive review.
