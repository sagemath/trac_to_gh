Hello!

This is the first version of Boost minimum spanning tree. With this code, I'm inserting in Sage the code to interface with Boost weighted graphs. The improvement on this specific algorithm is not striking (about 2x over the old algorithm), but I still set the Boost algorithm as default.

Some benchmark:

```
sage: sage: def random_weighted_graph(n, m, lower_weight = 1, upper_weight = 100): 
        import random
        g = graphs.RandomGNM(n,m)
        m = g.num_edges()
        weights = [random.randint(lower_weight, upper_weight) for r in xrange(m)]
        uw_edges = g.edges()
        w_edges = [(uw_edges[i][0], uw_edges[i][1], weights[i]) for i in xrange(m)]
        return Graph(w_edges, weighted = True)
....: 
sage: g = random_weighted_graph(20000,200000)
sage: %timeit(g.min_spanning_tree(algorithm="Prim_Boost"))
1 loops, best of 3: 279 ms per loop
sage: %timeit(g.min_spanning_tree(algorithm="Kruskal_Boost"))
1 loops, best of 3: 361 ms per loop
sage: %timeit(g.min_spanning_tree(algorithm="Kruskal"))
1 loops, best of 3: 492 ms per loop
sage: %timeit(g.min_spanning_tree(algorithm="NetworkX"))
1 loops, best of 3: 1.92 s per loop
sage: %timeit(g.min_spanning_tree(algorithm="Prim_edge"))
1 loops, best of 3: 17.3 s per loop
sage: %timeit(g.min_spanning_tree(algorithm="Prim_fringe"))
1 loops, best of 3: 36.1 s per loop
```
Hope you like it!

The weight function you use does not allow to access all possible stuff that might be stored on an edge. For instance, I may have an edge like `(u, v, {'weight':3, 'toto':4})` in which case a function like `weight_function=lambda e:e[2]['weight']` is possible. With current implementation, you assume that `weight_function((u,v))` returns the weight. Better to have `weight_function(e)` or `weight_function((u,v,l))`.

Also, could you be a bit more specific with the description of the weight function

```
- ``weight_function`` -- A function that takes an edge and returns a
          numeric weight. If ``None`` (default), the algorithm uses the edge
          weights, if available, otherwise it assigns weight 1 to each edge (in
          the latter case, the output can be any spanning tree).
```
In particular, the default behavior assume that edge weights are numbers, that is if `e=(u,v,l)` then `l` is a number.

David.

Hello!

Yeah, I have some problems, too: it is difficult to decide which is the correct behavior. In your examples, I have trouble understanding which improvement you are suggesting: could you be a bit more specific?

In particular, in the first two cases, you provide a weight function which is not correct, so a TypeError is raised (if you provide a function, the algorithm raises an error if it is not correct). In the third case, your graph is not weighted:

```
sage: g = Graph([(0,1,1), (1,2,'b')])
sage: g.weighted()
False
```
Hence, the algorithm simply says "Since the graph is not weighted, I ignore the label and set weight 1 to each edge".

Maybe a problem occurs if the graph is weighted and no function is provided: in this case, the algorithm tries to use labels even if they are not numbers. In Boost algorithms, non-numeric weights are assumed to be 1, while in other algorithms labels are simply compared, and Python decides which is the biggest.

```
sage: g = Graph([(0,1,1), (1,2,'b')], weighted=True)
sage: g.min_spanning_tree(algorithm="Prim_Boost")
[(0, 1, 1), (1, 2, 'b')]
sage: g.min_spanning_tree(algorithm="Prim_fringe")
[(0, 1, 1), (1, 2, 'b')]
sage: g.min_spanning_tree(algorithm="Prim_edge")
[(0, 1, 1), (1, 2, 'b')]
sage: g.min_spanning_tree(algorithm="Kruskal")
[(0, 1, 1), (1, 2, 'b')]
sage: g.min_spanning_tree(algorithm="Kruskal_Boost")
[(0, 1, 1), (1, 2, 'b')]
sage: g.min_spanning_tree(algorithm="NetworkX")
[(0, 1, 1), (1, 2, 'b')]
```
In the latter example, do you think I should only improve the explanation, which is in the INPUT section of the documentation and in the examples? Or do you think I should raise an exception if a weight is not a number?

Thank you very much!

Michele

Hello!

I have changed the behavior: now, if edge weights are not convertible to floats through `float()` function, an error is raised. I have tried to clarify this behavior as much as possible in the documentation.

Thank you very much!

The documentation builds properly and is now good.

I tracked all calls to `min_spanning_tree` to launch tests. All tests pass in graphs and homology.
However, one test is broken in `src/sage/matroids/utilities.py`, method `lift_cross_ratios`. I suspect that this is due to the change in the output ordering of edges.
I don't know what to do here. I have forced you to sort edges because all methods where not returning edges in the same order, and I think it is better now (the output is independent on the algorithm). 

The set T constructed in this method is, before applying this patch:

```
set([((0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 0)), ((0, 0), (2, 1), (0, 2)), ((0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 0)), ((1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 1)), ((1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1)), ((0, 0), (3, 1), (0, 3)), ((0, 0), (4, 1), (0, 4))])
```
and with this patch:

```
set([((0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 0)), ((0, 0), (2, 1), (0, 2)), ((0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 0)), ((1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 1)), ((2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2)), ((0, 0), (3, 1), (0, 3)), ((0, 0), (4, 1), (0, 4))])
```
So only one entry differs: `((1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1))` becomes `((2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2))`.

I don't know if we can safely update the expected output of this test or not. Nathann?

Hello,

> I don't know if we can safely update the expected output of this test or not. Nathann?


Not sure. Possible, but not sure. The best is to ask the matroid guys. Stefan, Rudi? Does it look okay to you if by changing the behaviour of a graph spanning tree routine, the output of 

```
sage: Z = lift_cross_ratios(A, to_sixth_root_of_unity)
```

at line 416 of matroids/utilities.py changes like that?

```
Failed example:
    Z
Expected:
    [ 1  0  1  1  1]
    [ 1  1  0  0  z]
    [ 0  1 -z -1  0]
Got:
    [     1      0      1      1      1]
    [     1      1      0      0      z]
    [     0  z - 1      1 -z + 1      0]
```

It may be caused by a different spanning tree, or by a reordering of its edges.

Yes, it is normal, I think: I modified that line only after I merged #18876. However, I do not think it is a problem, because the new commit in #18876 should not create conflicts (I have tested the merge).

In any case, I re-merged them with this new commit.
