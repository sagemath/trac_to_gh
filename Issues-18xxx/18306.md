Python has very little documentation about how comparisons work (both `__cmp__`, `__richcmp__` in Cython and `__eq__`, `__lt__`, ... in Python). When you throw in the Sage coercion framework, it gets only worse.

All this deserves a new thematic tutorial.

Depends on #17890

Nice start - if I finally understand this based on the finished product, I'll give it a positive review!

(One could also open a sage-wishlist ticket for expanding this to Python 3 as part of the Python 3 meta-ticket?)

Just a small suggestion: link to the tutorial from the developer guideâ€”or perhaps make it a chapter of the developer guide rather than a thematic tutorial?

That's not currently technically possible.

> or perhaps make it a chapter of the developer guide rather than a thematic tutorial?

Personally, I don't think it fits within the scope of the developer's guide. There are several other thematic tutorials which explain one specific aspect of Python/Cython/Sage programming, it fits more with those.
