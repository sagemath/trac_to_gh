As reported at [1], some doctests from graph_plot are skipped. This is because of a replacement that is being done in the `__doc__` variable of this file.

After the branch is applied:

```
sage: from sage.doctest.control import DocTestDefaults
sage: from sage.doctest.sources import FileDocTestSource
sage: FileDocTestSource("/home/ncohen/sage/graphs/graph_plot.py", DocTestDefaults(long=True, optional=True))._test_enough_doctests(verbose=True)
<no output>
```
