Currently, most of the games within the catalogue of games for normal form are fixed instances of a single game. This ticket addresses this issue by adding several classes of games with generators similar to the graph generators. This allows for the generation of multiple instances of the same class of game based on specified parameters.

The other random games and whether or not they should be in the catalog is probably worth discussing.

I also am not sure what you mean by 'multiple instances of the same class of game based on specified parameters'. This is something that the current setup can accomplish.

OK.

I was mainly trying to address generating games without the payoff entries of the game being passed as a parameters to the generator instead other parameters such as the size of the game or covariance etc. are passed into the generator.
