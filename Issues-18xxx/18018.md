<a id='comment:7'></a>Hello,

Did the reviewer really test the code before setting it to positive review?!

```
sage: t = Tableau([[1,2],[3]])
sage: t.leq(1)
TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for '+':
'Integer Ring' and '<type 'str'>'
```

The line

```
             raise TypeError(secondtab + " must be a tableau")
```
is wrong since only string can be concatenated to strings.
