Unicode provides nice symbols which can be combined to form large delimiters. It would be nice if we could print matrices using these, instead of the same ASCII brackets on all the lines. So instead of

```
[1 2|3]
[4 5|6]
[7 8|9]
```

I'd like to see one of these:

```
⎛1 2│3⎞    ⎡1 2│3⎤
⎜4 5│6⎟ or ⎢4 5│6⎥
⎝7 8│9⎠    ⎣7 8│9⎦
```

Perhaps it's best to do this in small increments: start with a keyword argument to the `str` method of matrices, then later on make this the default. So the ticket here is only for on-demand support of this feature, not for its automatic use by default. For later reference, see #14733 which switched the banner to Unicode, and thereby made the choice that Sage may look broken on non-Unicode terminals.

Perhaps you should file that as a bug, so it can be addressed? Does using `screen -U` help? What does `locale` print on your client's terminal, inside the `ssh` and inside `screen` respectively?

> For the on-demand feature

I meant “on-demand” as opposed to “automatic”, with the demand being expressed for each matrix that gets printed, i.e. by using the keyword argument from my commit. I believe you're talking about something far more automatic here.

> it would be nice to have a global flag allowing (or avoiding) unicode

The canonical way, at least on Linux, would be to inspect `LC_CTYPE` facet of the current locale, and detect whether that refers to UTF8 or not. If one used this to automatically choose a sane default, then setting the `LC_CTYPE` environment variable manually would serve the same function as the switch you suggest:

```
$ LC_CTYPE=en_US      sage  # without unicode
$ LC_CTYPE=en_US.utf8 sage  # with unicode
```

Of course, using `en_US` in this example is just the common default. I guess you as well as I might be using a different setting there in practice. Adding a switch might still make sense to add visibility to this feature. But all of this should probably be discussed in a follow-up ticket once we get the change here accepted.

Indeed, `screen -U` solves the problem. My locale on the client is

```
LANG=en_GB.UTF-8
LANGUAGE=en_GB:en
LC_CTYPE="en_GB.UTF-8"
...
```
and on the remote is

```
LANG=C
LANGUAGE=fr_FR:
LC_CTYPE="C"
...
```

Because I don't encounter them in my day-to-day work. Can you give me a hint as to where these might occur? For an even number of rows (except two), big curly brackets would look slightly unsymmetric, but I doubt that should be a concern.

If there are comments it is fine. For example

```
tlb = u"⎡"    # top left bracket
...
```
or

```
# we set delimiters as a string composed of 6 characters
#   - top left bracket (tlb)
#   ...
if unicode_symbols:
    delimiters = u"⎡⎢⎣⎤⎥⎦"
else:
    delimiters = "[[[]]]"
tlb, ... = delimiters
```

By "curly", I meant only using ⎧ ⎫ ⎩ ⎭ instead of your more angular version. The term was probably wrong. See

```
sage: m = matrix([[2,1],[0,1]])
sage: view(m)
```
... no angle...

Ah, round parentheses. Personally, I much prefer these round ones as well. I had the impression that in the USA especially, the square brackets are somewhat more common.

We might of course let the user choose between these alternatives, by allowing a string like `"round"` or `"square"` instead of `True` for the keyword argument.

IMHO its 
* British: round bracket ()

I also prefer round for matrices. Could you also change it to `unicode=<bool>` instead of `unicode_symbol` (shorter and clearer).
