1. you should break the lines in your comments. The line `The construction of a Hughes plane is based on a nearfield ...` is one kilometer long. Try to keep the width around 80.

2. you should align the comments `# xyz` with the code

3. It would be cool to have some code in the `EXAMPLES` section which proves that Hughes plane are indeed different from the standard finite projective plane. You can show that the theorem of Desargues is not satisfied.

4. For the function `normalize` it would be better to say that it is only intended to be used in `HughesPlane`. And you can even call it `normalize_hughes_plane_point`, in other words choose something more explicit.

<a id='comment:11'></a>Hello Quentin,

There is a lot of work to do in the documentation. Most of it is uncomprehensible. Hopefully I know what you are trying to do but any other person will not get a word. I already modified some of it in my commit at `public/18527` but there are still a lot of things to do:
- In `HughesPlane` the following sentence is uncomprehensible

```
    For p an odd prime.
    If kernel K of order `p^n` coincides with the center of a nearfield N.
    The construction of a Hughes plane is based on N of order `p^2n`.
```
   you should explain **simply** what is the Hughes plane. If it is complicated just make a reference to wikipedia and just explain what it is (e.g. The Hughes plane is a finite projective plane introduced by XYZ and which is not Desarguesian)

- If you want to include mathematics formula in the documentation you must use the block `MATH`. This is described in details in [the developer's guide](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#documentation-strings)

- the example that shows that the Hughes plane is not Desarguesian is not finished... And you should explain what you are doing with sentences (not Python comments starting with `#`). I already modified and simplified the begining.

Vincent

<a id='comment:14'></a>Hello,

When you are done with your changes, you need to set back to `needs review`. That way I know that I need to have a look.

Some more comments:

- with your last commit the test do not pass
- put spaces around equality signs `a = b` and not `a=b`. Similarly, add spaces in function declaration `f(a, b)` and not `f(a,b)`.
- When you define the Hughes plane you start with `p` being an odd prime but it is never used
- for coherence of notations, instead of using `n2` and `n` it would be better to use `q2` and `q` (and do not forget to modify the `INPUT` section)

I did a bit of profiling and it appears that most of the time is spent in doing matrix by vector multiplication! I will try to see whether it is possible to improve that part (in another ticket).

Vincent

<a id='comment:19'></a>In my review commits I changed few things (removed `random` from `random_q3_minus_one_matrix`, make `HughesPlane` works for non prime `q` and improve a bit the code).

There are still some issues with the documentation. Please pay more attention to what you write.

You wrote

```
Return the Hughes projective plane of order `n2`.
```
But the name of the parameter is now `q2`. Moreover you must use double quotes for the parameters ```q2````. Simple ones are for latex code.

This is not a sentence

```
For q an odd prime.
```

When you test the fact that it is not Desarguesian, it is weird to do it in two ways. Here you print the name of the points

```
        sage: set(b_0_1).intersection(b_57_70)
        {2}
        sage: set(b_1_10).intersection(b_70_59)
        {73}
        sage: set(b_10_0).intersection(b_59_57)
        {60}
```
But then you just test equality

```
        sage: p = set(b_0_57).intersection(b_1_70)
        sage: q = set(b_1_70).intersection(b_10_59)
        sage: p == q
        False
```
You should do it coherently.

You can also add a section `AUTHORS` with your name in the function `HughesPlane` (see the developer guide).
