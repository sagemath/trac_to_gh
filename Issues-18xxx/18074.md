Keywords: plot

In Sage-6.6.rc0 and before 

```
sage: contour_plot(0, (0,1), (0,1)).show()
```
fails deep in matplotlib with

```
ValueError: zero-size array to reduction operation minimum which has no identity
```
although non-zero constants can be handled.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18074
