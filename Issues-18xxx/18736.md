The only immediate payload is that sage doesn't need to be installed to then install `conway_polynomial`, which has always bothered me because sage itself won't start if `conway_polynomial` is not installed. Of course sage is never started for the installation.

Thinking further ahead, I did this in sage-on-gentoo because it will enable me to install all the runtime dependencies of sage before sage itself. In turn, thanks to that, I may be able to run the testsuite before installing sage like most other software packages.

But we do not to do this here.
