The function `sage.schemes.plane_conics.con_field.ProjectiveConic_field.hom(x, Y)` with `x` a matrix and codomain argument `Y` given fails on base fields for which sage does not simplify fractions of multivariate polynomials. It raises a `ValueError` for perfectly valid input.

```
sage: C = Conic(QQ, [1,0,0,1,0,1])
sage: D = Conic(QQ, [1,0,-2,1,0,2])
sage: T = Matrix([[1,0,1],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]])
sage: C.hom(T, D) # works fine over QQ
Scheme morphism:
  From: Projective Conic Curve over Rational Field defined by x^2 + y^2 + z^2
  To:   Projective Conic Curve over Rational Field defined by x^2 + y^2 - 2*x*z + 2*z^2
  Defn: Defined on coordinates by sending (x : y : z) to
        (x + z : y : z)
sage: K = FractionField(PolynomialRing(QQ, 't'))
sage: CK = C.base_extend(K)
sage: DK = D.base_extend(K)
sage: TK = T.base_extend(K)
sage: CK.hom(TK).codomain() == DK # works fine when the codomain is not specified
True
sage: CK.hom(TK, DK) # fails over K when the codomain is specified

/Users/marcostreng/sage_builds/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/schemes/plane_conics/con_field.pyc in hom(self, x, Y)
    656                     raise ValueError("The matrix x (= %s) does not define a " \

    659             x = Sequence(x*vector(self.ambient_space().gens()))
    660             return self.Hom(Y)(x, check = False)

ValueError: The matrix x (= [1 0 1]

```

Here is the code that raises the `ValueError`. It should test whether q is constant, but instead tests whether its numerator and denominator are constant.

```
                q = Y.defining_polynomial()/im.defining_polynomial()
                if not (q.numerator().is_constant()
                        and q.denominator().is_constant()):
                    raise ValueError("The matrix x (= %s) does not define a " \
                                      "map from self (= %s) to Y (= %s)" % \
                                      (x, self, Y))
```

Here is a less direct example, which shows that consequently `diagonalization()` fails for such base fields.

**Example:**

```python
sage: K = FractionField(PolynomialRing(QQ, 't')); (t,) = K.gens(); C = Conic(K, [1/2,0, 1, 2, 0, 3])
sage: C.diagonalization()

    339         D, T = self.diagonal_matrix()
    340         con = Conic(D, names = names)
--> 341         return con, con.hom(T, self), self.hom(T.inverse(), con)
    342 
    343     def gens(self):

    656                     raise ValueError("The matrix x (= %s) does not define a " \

    659             x = Sequence(x*vector(self.ambient_space().gens()))
    660             return self.Hom(Y)(x, check = False)

This is a serious bug in `hom`, giving incorrect information to the user. That needs to be fixed, independently of what it means for the diagonalization method, and for all fields once and for all. I removed the workaround (which only works for certain fields) from the ticket description.

As a temporary workaround: avoid giving `Y` to `hom` in conics, and use `diagonal_matrix()` directly instead of `diagonalization()`.
