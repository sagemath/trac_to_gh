The function glp_exact provides access to an implementation of the simplex method in exact rational arithmetic (using GMP). 

The only access to data is via double-precision floats, however. It reconstructs rationals from doubles and provides results as doubles using the standard API functions of GLPK. 

On the Sage side, since the combinatorial basis information is available via get_col_stat, get_row_stat, one could then reconstruct the rational solution. See #18735.

(Direct access, using GMP rationals, would be possible through the header file glpssx.h; see ticket #18765.)

Hi Dima, 

Replying to [@dimpase](#comment:1):
> copying from a comment on another ticket:
> 
> I don't think using non-public non-documented features is a good idea. Next version would break them, and we'd be stuck with maintaining a fork...

I share your concern about the non-public functions, which is valid for the other ticket (#18765), but *not* for this ticket.

glp_exact is a documented API function.

There's just no way to feed the problem using exact data, or to retrieve the solution using exact data.
However, if the problem can be expressed using small integers (<= 53 bits) that are represented exactly by double floats, then the rational reconstruction that GLPK does should be exact. The Sage code could refuse, or warn, if this is violated.

And we can access the combinatorial information about the basis on the Sage side and compute the basic solution using exact arithmetic.
