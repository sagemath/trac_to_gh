```
sage: (1-2^(-s)).factor_list()
[(2^s - 1, 1), (2^s, -1)]
sage: (1/(1-2^(-s))).factor_list()
[(2^s - 1, -1), (2, s)]
```
I would have expected the first expression to have `(2, -s)` or the second to have `(2^s, 1)`.
Also, this looks odd:

```
sage: (1/(1-x)).factor_list()
[(x - 1, -1), (-1, 1)]
sage: (1-x).factor_list()
[(-x + 1, 1)]
```
