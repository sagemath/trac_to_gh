What's wrong with creating `build/sage_bootstrap` *without* moving the "makefile stuff" first? Independently of whether `build/install` and friends should be moved, what influence does it have on the present ticket?

I think it's stupid to first create `$SAGE_ROOT/src/sage_bootstrap` on this ticket and then immediately move it to a different place. Just put it in the correct place from the beginning...

I see your point, but I don't find it strong enough as an argument for why `$SAGE_ROOT/src/sage_bootstrap/sage_bootstrap` is better than `$SAGE_ROOT/build/sage_bootstrap`.

Can we get rid of that `setup.py`? Move it? Rename it?

That can be solved with a simple comment like

```
#
# This setup.py file is only used for tox testing of the
# sage_bootstrap package, do not actually execute it!
#
# For building Sage packages, see "install", "deps" and "Makefile".

```
 (Something like "The main entry points are sage-download-file and sage-package, which are used as follows: ...". Note also that "libary" is currently misspelled.)
- In addition, I think that each python file in `sage_bootstrap` could have a bit more documentation, illustrating how to use it. I don't really want to have to read the source code to figure out this sort of thing. For `download.py`, for example, mention `Download(...).run()`.
- Add the link `​https://tox.readthedocs.org` to `README`. Maybe we should all know about tox already, but that doesn't seem to be the case.

They are used for testing in unittest.TestCase.assertEqual, doesn't really have anything to do with tox (which is just the test runner) besides that.

> - There are some blank spaces on several otherwise empty lines in `tarball.py`. Do we care?

I don't. 

> Overall, the code is just a relocation of old code, so that's okay. I'm not sure about the whole idea of moving it. Seems okay to me, but it doesn't strike me as very high on the priority list.

The old script was already too long to fit comfortably into one file, with added testing its can't fit into one file. So it has to grow into a package.

> Less minor questions and comments:
> - What does `sage-package` do?

It mostly makes the release manager's job easier because you don't have to log into the server and associated tarball names to package names by hand, which wastes my preciously little available time.

I'm happy to add a line of documentation here or there but unlike the math part this is **not** a library for Python novices. IMHO its not too much to ask to google for "tox", thats bound to produce way more relevant and informative information than I can possibly be.

Here is some documentation for the main scripts. I think that few of the Python files could use a bit more information: the current descriptions for `package.py` and maybe `tarball.py` are too terse.
