`sage-pkg` was the command to create old-style packages, now it's something completely different. Since we still support old-style packages, can't you rename this script?

Also: why is this a blocker? There is nothing in the description or comments justifying that.

tox (which is pretty much the standard for cross python version testing) is configured to not fail if a python version is not found (see tox.ini)

scripts in src/bin end up being installed in SAGE_LOCAL (and globally if Sage is every packaged / packageable). Build tools shouldn't be globally installed. Really sage-bootstrap only makes sense if you have the source lying around, so why pretend otherwise.

It's a name collision with *current* Sage versions. And `sage --pkg` is still currently documented in [http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/packaging_old_spkgs.html#the-file-spkg-txt](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/packaging_old_spkgs.html#the-file-spkg-txt)

> tox (which is pretty much the standard for cross python version testing) is configured to not fail if a python version is not found (see tox.ini)

Sure, but it is confusing to see `ERROR: InterpreterNotFound: python3.4` if it's not really an error. But if that's the way how `tox` works, so be it.

What's wrong with creating `build/sage_bootstrap` *without* moving the "makefile stuff" first? Independently of whether `build/install` and friends should be moved, what influence does it have on the present ticket?

I think it's stupid to first create `$SAGE_ROOT/src/sage_bootstrap` on this ticket and then immediately move it to a different place. Just put it in the correct place from the beginning...

Moving the files physically, sure. But that's only a very small part of the effort of moving files. All the code referring to those files needs to be changed, everything has to be tested again...

> So why do it now when /build is not ready for it?

First of all, I don't agree with the premise that "`build` is not ready for it". I really don't see the problem. Second, like I already said: I would avoid having to move things in the future.

Minor questions:

- In `package.py`, are the lines

```

 there just for testing via `tox`, or do they serve another purpose?
- There are some blank spaces on several otherwise empty lines in `tarball.py`. Do we care?

They are used for testing in unittest.TestCase.assertEqual, doesn't really have anything to do with tox (which is just the test runner) besides that.

> - There are some blank spaces on several otherwise empty lines in `tarball.py`. Do we care?


I don't. 

> Overall, the code is just a relocation of old code, so that's okay. I'm not sure about the whole idea of moving it. Seems okay to me, but it doesn't strike me as very high on the priority list.


The old script was already too long to fit comfortably into one file, with added testing its can't fit into one file. So it has to grow into a package.

> Less minor questions and comments:
> - What does `sage-package` do?


It mostly makes the release manager's job easier because you don't have to log into the server and associated tarball names to package names by hand, which wastes my preciously little available time.

I'm happy to add a line of documentation here or there but unlike the math part this is **not** a library for Python novices. IMHO its not too much to ask to google for "tox", thats bound to produce way more relevant and informative information than I can possibly be.
