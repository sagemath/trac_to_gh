In optimization, the concept of a "proper" (closed, convex, solid, pointed) cone is useful because such cones define partial orders on the ambient vector space. We're missing an `is_proper()` method but one would be nice to have to throw out "bad" cones.

So, I'm interested in computing the Lyapunov (or bilinearity) rank of cones. The best reference I have is http://www.math.umbc.edu/~gowda/papers/trGOW13-01.pdf, but basically, I want to know the dimension of the space of all transformations `L` with `<Lx,s> = 0` for all `(x,s)` in the complementarity set of the cone `K`. If the dimension is large, we can do a trick like we do in the linear complementarity problem where we rewrite the condition `<x,s> = 0` as `x_{i}s_{i} = 0` (for i=1,...n).

In general this seems very hard, but for polyhedral cones, it should be easy (if slow) to attack combinatorially: there are only so many elements in the complementarity set of `K` that we need to look at since the cone is finitely generated. The first problem I ran into is that in the literature so far, the cone `K` is always assumed to be proper. I planned to throw an error if `K` was not proper, but dropping that assumption has given me some interesting questions to play with over the last few days.

In that sense I'm using them to research the Lyapunov rank of non-proper cones, but I'm not one of the people who actually tries to solve optimization problems =)
