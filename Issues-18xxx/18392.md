In optimization, the concept of a "proper" (closed, convex, solid, pointed) cone is useful because such cones define partial orders on the ambient vector space. We're missing an `is_proper()` method but one would be nice to have to throw out "bad" cones.

So, I'm interested in computing the Lyapunov (or bilinearity) rank of cones. The best reference I have is http://www.math.umbc.edu/~gowda/papers/trGOW13-01.pdf, but basically, I want to know the dimension of the space of all transformations `L` with `<Lx,s> = 0` for all `(x,s)` in the complementarity set of the cone `K`. If the dimension is large, we can do a trick like we do in the linear complementarity problem where we rewrite the condition `<x,s> = 0` as `x_{i}s_{i} = 0` (for i=1,...n).

In general this seems very hard, but for polyhedral cones, it should be easy (if slow) to attack combinatorially: there are only so many elements in the complementarity set of `K` that we need to look at since the cone is finitely generated.
