The `show()` function is an alias for `pretty_print()`. The latter is far less confusing, its just like `print()` except that it makes use of rich output (graphics etc). But just `show(x)` is hardly self-explanatory, and in fact it is often misused in our own tutorials, e.g. 

```
sage: P = parametric_plot(...)
sage: show(P)    # no need to write show() here
```
If you know just a little bit of Python then you would't type in

```
sage: x = 123
sage: print(x)
```
but many users are not aware of the show <-> print analogy.

If you want to see a plot of the graph use one of the following two

```
sage: plot(g)
sage: g.plot()

Or use `pretty_print(g)` instead of `show(g)`, though whether or not that results in a picture will depend on the user interface capabilities.

Of course this wouldn't show the plot: the statement `P` doesn't do anything. It's exactly the same as a regular non-interactive function:

```
def f():
    P = plot(x)
    P

f()
```
This wouldn't show the plot either.

If you change the last line to `return P` then it *does* show the plot in Jupyter.

It's related because not every Sage user can be expected to be an expert (at least not immediately) in "standard Python stuff".

I agree with Karl-Dieter on this. I think `show` is self-explanatory (particularly to people from Missouri), and it's what Mathematica uses. If it does no harm to include it when expecting output, then it helps to make code consistent for users who are either new or employ interacts more than the command line. When I assembled some [documentation](https://github.com/paulmasson/sagemath-docs) of special functions for rendering with SageMathCell, I used `show` in places where it didn't need to be just to keep the code consistent.

And FWIW, I don't use `pretty_print` because it just sounds silly to me. What's wrong with `show`?

I think switching to `display` is also a great idea (btw GAP also uses `Display`). We would be consistent with ourselves AND jupyter...

That Mathematica uses `Show[]` is another point against as that language is known to get everything wrong ;-)

Though the name display is currently not available as line magics can also be called without percent (not sure why), so the following are equivalent

```
sage: display text plain
sage: display
Display preferences:
* graphics is not specified
* supplemental_plot = never
* text = plain
sage: %display unicode_art
sage: %display
Display preferences:
* graphics is not specified
* supplemental_plot = never
* text = unicode_art
```
