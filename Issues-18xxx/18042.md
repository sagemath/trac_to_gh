Create a file `testing.spyx` containing

```
from sage.all import *
print ZZ
```
and then run `sage testing.spyx`. This will produce an error:

```
NameError: name 'ZZ' is not defined
```
The same happens if the import statement is `from sage.all import ZZ`. This file works properly if it is attached or loaded.

I think this used to work and I think this ought to work. Is the problem in `sage-run-cython`? Or in `sage.repl`?

Any fix should add a doctest (or modify the existing doctest) in sage.tests.cmdline for running a `.spyx` file.

A workaround, in case anyone needs to do this: `sage -c "load('filename')"`

More generally, first importing all of `sage` fixes the problem.
