Random testing (from Ticket #18454) reveals the following. I'm not familiar with the `Fan` stuff, so this might not even be an issue mathematically.

```
sage: K = Cone([], ToricLattice(0))
sage: K.is_isomorphic(K)
...
KeyError: (frozenset([]), frozenset([]))
```

```
sage: K = Cone([(0,)])
sage: K.is_isomorphic(K)
...
TypeError: 'bool' object has no attribute '__getitem__'
```

Well, mathematically the cone consisting of the origin in a 0-dimensional space is certainly isomorphic to itself and correctly handling such cases is often important for algorithms that ran into corner cases on less trivial examples.

On an unrelated note it is sad I didn't notice this ticket before, looks like RSS on trac has changed.

So the problem is with constructing the cone lattice of a fan containing the trivial cone only. We probably should call/get

```
sage: list(sage.geometry.cone.Hasse_diagram_from_incidences([()], [()]))
[((), (0,)), ((0,), ())]
```
for the lattice with a single atom (fan) and single coatom (trivial cone). We seem to correctly pass the list of coatoms, but have no atoms at all.

This ticket is a treasure chest of chained bugs, the latest one is

```
sage: K = Cone([(0,0)]); K.is_isomorphic(K)
```
which, after fixing a corner case in fan code, boils down to

```
sage: matrix(2, 1).echelon_form().is_mutable()
False
sage: matrix(2, 0).echelon_form().is_mutable()
True
```
