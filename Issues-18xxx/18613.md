Random testing (from Ticket #18454) reveals the following. I'm not familiar with the `Fan` stuff, so this might not even be an issue mathematically.

```
sage: K = Cone([], ToricLattice(0))
sage: K.is_isomorphic(K)
...
KeyError: (frozenset([]), frozenset([]))
```

```
sage: K = Cone([(0,)])
sage: K.is_isomorphic(K)
...
TypeError: 'bool' object has no attribute '__getitem__'
```

Well, mathematically the cone consisting of the origin in a 0-dimensional space is certainly isomorphic to itself and correctly handling such cases is often important for algorithms that ran into corner cases on less trivial examples.

On an unrelated note it is sad I didn't notice this ticket before, looks like RSS on trac has changed.

So the problem is with constructing the cone lattice of a fan containing the trivial cone only. We probably should call/get

```
sage: list(sage.geometry.cone.Hasse_diagram_from_incidences([()], [()]))
[((), (0,)), ((0,), ())]
```
for the lattice with a single atom (fan) and single coatom (trivial cone). We seem to correctly pass the list of coatoms, but have no atoms at all.

This ticket is a treasure chest of chained bugs, the latest one is

```
sage: K = Cone([(0,0)]); K.is_isomorphic(K)
```
which, after fixing a corner case in fan code, boils down to

```
sage: matrix(2, 1).echelon_form().is_mutable()
False
sage: matrix(2, 0).echelon_form().is_mutable()
True
```

Yet another bug uncovered by this ticket. In clean 6.9.beta0 I get

```
sage:             sage: polytope = LatticePolytope(
....:             ...       [(-3,0,-1,-1),(-1,2,-1,-1),(0,-1,0,0),(0,0,0,1),(0,0,1,0),

sage:             sage: coarse_fan = FaceFan(polytope)
sage:             sage: P2 = toric_varieties.P2()
sage:             sage: proj24 = matrix([[0,0],[1,0],[0,0],[0,1]])
sage: proj24
[0 0]
[1 0]
[0 0]
[0 1]
sage: proj24.pivots()
(0, 1)
sage:             sage: fm = FanMorphism(proj24, coarse_fan, P2.fan(), subdivide=True)
sage: fm.matrix()
[0 0]
[1 0]
[0 0]
[0 1]
sage: fm.matrix().pivots()

so pivots are obviously screwed up somewhere. With my changes this affects the rank computation as well. Now to figure out the fix...

I know, but it's all unrelated to this ticket, isn't it? I don't want to drop them -- I'm just not qualified to review them at the moment. The first half I've reviewed and tested already, so we could set that to positive_review and then move your remaining commits to another ticket where someone who knows the matrix stuff could look at it.
