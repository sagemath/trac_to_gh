Random testing (from Ticket #18454) reveals the following. I'm not familiar with the `Fan` stuff, so this might not even be an issue mathematically.

```
sage: K = Cone([], ToricLattice(0))
sage: K.is_isomorphic(K)
...
KeyError: (frozenset([]), frozenset([]))
```

```
sage: K = Cone([(0,)])
sage: K.is_isomorphic(K)
...
TypeError: 'bool' object has no attribute '__getitem__'
```

Well, mathematically the cone consisting of the origin in a 0-dimensional space is certainly isomorphic to itself and correctly handling such cases is often important for algorithms that ran into corner cases on less trivial examples.

On an unrelated note it is sad I didn't notice this ticket before, looks like RSS on trac has changed.

This ticket is a treasure chest of chained bugs, the latest one is

```
sage: K = Cone([(0,0)]); K.is_isomorphic(K)
```
which, after fixing a corner case in fan code, boils down to

```
sage: matrix(2, 1).echelon_form().is_mutable()
False
sage: matrix(2, 0).echelon_form().is_mutable()
True

I've attempted to fix the `is_immutable()` issue separately (basically dropped your last two commits and made a copy of the trivial matrix in `echelon_form`). The only other issues were leading whitespace and that new OUTPUT block that I tried to clarify a little. It passes a ptestlong but leaves the pivot stuff as Somebody Else's Problem.

I know, but it's all unrelated to this ticket, isn't it? I don't want to drop them -- I'm just not qualified to review them at the moment. The first half I've reviewed and tested already, so we could set that to positive_review and then move your remaining commits to another ticket where someone who knows the matrix stuff could look at it.
