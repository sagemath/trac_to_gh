```
sage: P.<p> = ZZ[[]]
sage: a = 1/(1+p)
sage: o = a - a.truncate()
sage: o
O(p^20)
sage: 2*o
O(p^20)
sage: 2*SR(o)
0
```
The last line is wrong.

<a id='comment:8'></a>
It's "only" a hack that will give us bare symbolic bigoh. Realistic behaviour must be added on Pynac level, it's simply not there at the moment, if I understand correctly.

You see you cannot do arithmetics at all with symbolic series:

```
sage: s = SR(1/(1-x)).series(x,5); s
1 + 1*x + 1*x^2 + 1*x^3 + 1*x^4 + Order(x^5)
sage: 2*s
2*(1 + 1*x + 1*x^2 + 1*x^3 + 1*x^4 + Order(x^5))
```
For that reason it would be helpful if someone could at least review those tickets that deal with symbolic<-->dedicated ring conversion (#10846, #16203, #17402 and maybe #17400 and #17659). I cannot do this: I am the author 8P

> It's "only" a hack that will give us bare symbolic bigoh. Realistic behaviour must be added on Pynac level, it's simply not there at the moment, if I understand correctly.

No, it's there but the user is asked to apply `series` again:

```
sage: (2*s).series(x,5)
2 + 2*x + 2*x^2 + 2*x^3 + 2*x^4 + Order(x^5)
```
So, it's not as bad as thought, and the patch could go in without having to fix a bigger issue.
