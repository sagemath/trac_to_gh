I started out as a branch for #6311, but then I realized that the test didn't need to be optional at all.

Each time we add something to the declaration file of pari or modifiate the generation we should artificially upgrade the package version? Won't this force the build system to download again the pari package? In any case, it forces a useless recompilation of pari...
