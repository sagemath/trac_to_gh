After installing the Python 3 package from #17607 on OS X 10.10.3, Xcode 6.3.1, I see

```

The same happened on a machine with just the Xcode command-line tools installed.

To be completely clear, I got this failure using the branch at #18517 because `git trac checkout 17607` failed earlier today. But I don't think #18517 has anything to do with the error here.
