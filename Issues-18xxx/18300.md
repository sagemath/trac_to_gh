The documentation for number theory in the reference manual is a bit confusing. There is a section `Number Theory, Algebraic Geometry` in the index which lacks many integer related features (which are hidden in the `Standard Rings and Fields` section).

We also correct some formatting (like <code>#xyz -> :trac:\`xyz\`</code> or <code>\`QQ\` -> \`\QQ\`</code>).

Depends on #18169

Just be sure not to change links too dramatically - in the index is fine, but we don't want third-party links to our doc to go down without a good reason.
