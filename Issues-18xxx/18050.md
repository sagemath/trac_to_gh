<a id='comment:12'></a>I think the docstring of `Partition.dual_equivalence_graph` could be clearer.  I suggest

```
Two permutations `p` and `q` differ by an elementary dual Knuth
relation (of color `i`), when, in one line notation, the letter
`i` does not occur between `i-1` and `i+1`, and `q` is obtained 
from `p` by switching the places of `i-1` and `i+1`.

Two standard Young tableaux of shape `\lambda` differ by an
elementary dual Knuth relation (of color `i`), if their content
reading words differ by an elementary dual Knuth relation (of
color `i`).

The *dual equivalence graph* is the edge-colored graph formed by
the set of standard Young tableaux of shape `\lambda` where edges
colored by `i` are given by dual equivalences of color `i`.

My question is still standing: Where are the `= 0 or 1` conditions in Assaf's (4.1) reflected in your code and doc? Or are they redundant, or wrong, or your notion of dual equivalence graphs different?

Also, I had to change the meaning of "head" (of a directed edge) in the partitions.py method; please check whether it is correctly used in the other file.

In regular_crystals.py, what is required of X ? Should it be closed under e_i and f_i?

Thanks for doing the review.

> My question is still standing: Where are the `= 0 or 1` conditions in Assaf's (4.1) reflected in your code and doc? Or are they redundant, or wrong, or your notion of dual equivalence graphs different?


It's in the code, see this line:

```
if x.epsilon(i) == 1 and x.epsilon(im) == 0:
```
Note that because I considered the directed, I make it slightly more specific than Assaf's definition by saying `\varepsilon_j(b) = 1`. A similar statement appears in the doc.

> Also, I had to change the meaning of "head" (of a directed edge) in the partitions.py method; please check whether it is correctly used in the other file.


It looks okay. I think instead of writing `a - b` we should do `a \to b` in both files for directed edges (especially since it's in latex).

I also feel this statement is too verbose:

```
- In the one-line notation of the permutation `p`, the letter
  `i` appears either to the left of both `i-1` and `i+1`, or
  to the right of both `i-1` and `i+1` (but not between the
  two).
```
and we should just say `i` does not appear between `i-1` and `i+1`. Does this sound okay?

> In regular_crystals.py, what is required of X ? Should it be closed under e_i and f_i?


No, I wanted it to be as general as possible (at least this is what I needed for my research; I didn't necessarily know if my set of elements was the full dual equivalence class).

But what about the doc? Without this condition it sounds like your graph has a lot more (isolated) vertices than it should have.

I think it's fine the way it is. The edge is undirected a priori; we direct it by assigning it a head. You'd have to reword my definition if you want to put an arrow there.

That's fine; feel free to change it (I won't return to this until tomorrow).

OK, but it seems (from a brief glance) that if you don't have a union of equivalence classes, then your code can leak some non-X vertices into the graph by constructing edges one of whose endpoints is not in X. Is that OK to you?
