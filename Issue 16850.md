The packages fflas-ffpack and linbox work in tandem and have unnecessary complex setup to deal with blas. This ticket aims to simplify the spkgs by removing the useless bits and tidying the bits relating to blas.

The only question I have left before finalizing the ticket is whether we keep the possibility to set the variable LINBOX_BLAS externally to override whatever default there is. I am for removing it now as we will want to remove it anyway once we push #17075 in earnest.

Looks OK but untested as I don't have access to a computer. Lets trust the patchbot.
