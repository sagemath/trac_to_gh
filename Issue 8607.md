All test passed in `sage/plot/misc.py`. I tested it on a keyword I changed recently and everything works as expected. I tested the sphinx docbuild and no new warning are created... but that is because the doc of the affected file is not generated. To me this is a positive review.

I added a patch where I make use of the `rename_keyword` with deprecation warning and where I fixed some small sphinx syntax. If Jason aggrees with my patch, I allow him to change the status of this ticket to positive review.

Positive review on the documentation changes.  I'm not qualified to comment on the deprecation you did in the word code, though, so I'll let someone else review that deprecation.

I removed the deprecation in the word code from the review patch. I realize more and more that mixing independent things in the same ticket is not a good idea : the review process gets unnecessarily longer. Hence, I kept in the review patch only the documentation changes to the file `sage/plot/misc.py` which was given a positive review by Jason. Therefore, this ticket now deserves a positive review.

Sorry again for the first version of the review patch. I hope it will make it into sage-4.4. Thanks again for the idea about this ticket : I like it and will definitively use it ...in later patches!

One last idea (for another ticket) since I am thinking about it. Maybe this `rename_keyword` decorator could move up in `sage/misc` because I think it will be used by more than the plot code.

+1.  In fact, the other decorators in that file probably ought to be moved up to sage/misc as well.
