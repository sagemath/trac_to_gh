I removed the deprecation in the word code from the review patch. I realize more and more that mixing independent things in the same ticket is not a good idea : the review process gets unnecessarily longer. Hence, I kept in the review patch only the documentation changes to the file `sage/plot/misc.py` which was given a positive review by Jason. Therefore, this ticket now deserves a positive review.

Sorry again for the first version of the review patch. I hope it will make it into sage-4.4. Thanks again for the idea about this ticket : I like it and will definitively use it ...in later patches!

One last idea (for another ticket) since I am thinking about it. Maybe this `rename_keyword` decorator could move up in `sage/misc` because I think it will be used by more than the plot code.

+1.  In fact, the other decorators in that file probably ought to be moved up to sage/misc as well.
