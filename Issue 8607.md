I added a patch where I make use of the `rename_keyword` with deprecation warning and where I fixed some small sphinx syntax. If Jason aggrees with my patch, I allow him to change the status of this ticket to positive review.

I removed the deprecation in the word code from the review patch.

Hence, I kept in the review patch only the documentation changes to the file `sage/plot/misc.py` which was given a positive review by Jason. Therefore, this ticket now deserves a positive review.

One last idea (for another ticket) since I am thinking about it. Maybe this `rename_keyword` decorator could move up in `sage/misc` because I think it will be used by more than the plot code.
