CC:  tscrim klee jhpalmieri @tobiasdiez

A few files still use `$...$` for math instead of backticks in docstrings.

We can make the source more uniform by replacing it. Then 
the function `sage.misc.sagedoc.process_dollars` (which is used in `sage_docbuild.conf`) can be deprecated and eventually removed

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33968

Thanks a lot for testing this. Probably we should keep `process_dollars` for now though because the docbuilding machinery may be in use in user packages. Perhaps we can emit a deprecation warning when `process_dollars` actually makes a substitution?

I will push in a little bit; I've found at least one more change. I agree about `process_dollars` — I was just making that change to test things out. We can deprecate it on another ticket.
