The saturation() method for elliptic curves of Q has a small bug: a variable (which will most often notbe used) was not initialised.  At the same time I changed two parameter in the saturation code.

I have been using this code (with the patch) for many thousands of curves over several months.  I no longer remember which curve actually triggered the bug, so I have not added a doctest.  WIth a new release I realised that I had never submitted the patch for review (but I will go on using it every day even if reviewers don't like the lack of doctest!).
