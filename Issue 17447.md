As reported on [this ask question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/25617/density_plot-defed-python-function-typeerror/), the following does not work:


```
sage: f1(a, b) = 1 - b / a
sage: f2(a, b) = 1 - a / b
sage: def f12(a, b):
....:         if a - b < 0:
....:                 return f1(a, b)
....:         else:
....:                 return f2(a, b)
sage: density_plot(f,(1,2),(1,2))
KeyError: 'text/plain'
```


While the following works:


```
sage: f1(a, b) = 1 - b / a
sage: f2(a, b) = 1 - a / b
sage: def f12(a, b):
....:     if a - b < 0:
....:         return RDF(f1(a, b))
....:     else:
....:         return RDF(f2(a, b))
sage: density_plot(f12,(1,2),(1,2))
```

Nice.  Unfortunately I can't upgrade my Sage currently to actually check this (quite old computer with fragile installation, based on past experience, and I can't afford to bork it), but patchbot says okay ... would you be willing to post some of the plots from the documentation (Including the tests for bug fixes, including your new one) here to verify?

That said, the real bug here is in `fast_float`, because it should still be taking this function in `setup_for_eval_on_grid` and doing the "right" thing with it.
