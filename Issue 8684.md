This is a follow-up to #8513.  The graph theory in the reference manual needs to be organized in some sensible fashion.

The [current organization](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/graphs.html) of the graph theory module in the reference manual should be enough to close this ticket. If you agree, then this ticket should be closed.

I'm closing this ticket as fixed, since the [current organization](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/graphs.html) of the graph theory module is much better than when this ticket was first opened.
