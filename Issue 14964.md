It seems to be a problem to compute Hecke eigenvalues for Modular Symbol subspaces at integers dividing the level N unless the eigenvalue for the Hecke operator at N is computed first.
I have verified this problem for sage versions between 5.8 and 5.12.beta.

Example::


    sage: M=ModularSymbols(5,6,sign=1)

    sage: S=M.decomposition()

    sage: f=S[0]

    sage: f.eigenvalue(10)

    IndexError                                Traceback (most recent call last)

    ...

    IndexError: n must be a positive integer

    sage: f.eigenvalue(5)

    25

    sage: f.eigenvalue(10)

    50

The code used the recursive formula for the Hecke eigenvalues of p-power index without implementing the base case.  This is fixed in the attached branch.
