pkgconf is an implementation of widely used pkg-config.
In fact, pkg-config can be configured to look at certain directories, so we can use the one on the system, I suppose. 

Fiddly, but probably doable

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).

the plan is to install `PKG_CONFIG_PATH=SAGE_LOCAL/lib/pkgconfig` into `src/bin/sage-env-config` in case the system has `pkg-config` installed.
