This patch [is already merged](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/release/sage-4.7.2.alpha3/tickets.html#t9739) into Sage 4.7.2.alpha3 (otherwise I'd put it on another ticket):

I just wonder why the date in the log is that wrong.

I think this ticket can be closed, so I'm going to mark it as "positive review".
