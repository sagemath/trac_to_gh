# Issue 21793: falling_factorial simplifies too early

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22030

Original creator: pelegm

Original creation time: 2016-12-06 13:58:41

Keywords: factorial, falling_factorial, simplify

This is what happens now:


```python
sage: falling_factorial(x, x)
gamma(x + 1)
```


Instead, the falling factorial should not be simplified immediately, but rather stay `falling_factorial(x, x)`, just like in `factorial(x)`.

A call to simplify (or rather to factorial_simplify) should probably simplify it.  I must say that I prefer the `rewrite` routine of SymPy, which allows one to "rewrite" factorials as gamma, etc.

I open this as an enhancement, but this is, in some sense, a defect as well.

Agreed, but see also #19461.

Right. I mark this as a duplicate, then.
