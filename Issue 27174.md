Any idea why the elements are failing the category test? Also, why is `Element` after `Link` in the MRO? (Side note: `Link` probably should inherit from `SageObject` instead of `object`, but that is a separate ticket.)

No idea. I just did that quickly, and did not try to find what was wrong.

Changing keywords from "" to "knots".

Here is the fix for the `_test_category` failures. Basically the class being created was `Knot`, but the test is checking to make sure it was a subclass of `Knots().element_class`. I also fixed the `SageObject` while-I-was-at-it.
