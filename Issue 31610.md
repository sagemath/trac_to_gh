# Issue 31610: "show()" does not display LatexExpr in jupyter as of sage 9.3

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31847

Original creator: rjbarker

CC:  egourgoulhon klee slelievre

Keywords: show() sage.repl.rich_output.pretty_print()

"show()", alias for sage.repl.rich_output.pretty_print(), does not format LatexExpr correctly as of sage 9.3. Prior versions, specifically 9.2, do format LatexExpr correctly. 


Defect can be reproduced in CoCalc as shown in attached screen shots. Code used to reproduce defect is:

sage.repl.rich_output.pretty_print(LatexExpr(r"\frac{x}{y}"))

or

show(LatexExpr(r"\frac{x}{y}"))

Maybe the changes in #31536 cause this change in display?

Changing keywords from "show() sage.repl.rich_output.pretty_print()" to "show, sage.repl.rich_output.pretty_print".

Possibly a duplicate of #31629.
