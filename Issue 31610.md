Keywords: show, sage.repl.rich_output.pretty_print

Up to Sage 9.2, `show(...)`, alias for `sage.repl.rich_output.pretty_print(...)`,
formats `LatexExpr` correctly in Jupyter.

In Sage 9.3 it is broken, as illustrated by:

```
sage: sage.repl.rich_output.pretty_print(LatexExpr(r"\frac{x}{y}"))
sage: show(LatexExpr(r"\frac{x}{y}"))
```
Screenshots reproducing the defect in CoCalc
are attached to this ticket.
