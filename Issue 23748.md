The following is not very surprising as pandoc is listed as a requirement on https://pypi.python.org/pypi/rst2ipynb/0.2.0 .

To fix this, we upgrade the rst2ipynb package and apply a patch:

**Upstream patch**: https://github.com/nthiery/rst-to-ipynb/pull/4

**Tarball**: https://pypi.python.org/packages/59/21/e8bc2432fb6b901d40728a8520401b04f3a8601c8f203790eea65b999793/rst2ipynb-0.2.2.tar.gz

Hi Jeroen,

Would you think testing for pandoc during the installation of rst2ipynb and printing a clear error message redirecting the end user to https://pandoc.org/installing.html would be a good way to solve this? From the website it seems that this is a mature project that is easy to install on every platform we support and more. And building it ourselves from source would require a haskell compiler, and I rather not add this to sage if not needed, even not as optional package.

There are also Python packages related to pandoc. Maybe the error would better be raised there. I'll check...

    "body": "I like the fix you made, and the install now fails as it should. However because of the standard pip + sage failed install bloat, this means that the actual error is somewhere hidden in a bunch of noise so long that on my machine I actually have to scroll up to see the useful part of the error message. I would not have seen it if I was not reviewing this ticket and knew what to look for. So giving positive review since this fixes the blocker part of this ticket, but I am creating a follow up ticket to make the error messages more user friendly.\n\n```\n[rst2ipynb-0.2.2.p0] Installing collected packages: rst2ipynb\n[rst2ipynb-0.2.2.p0]   Running setup.py install for rst2ipynb: started\n[rst2ipynb-0.2.2.p0]     Running command /Applications/sagedev/local/bin/python2 -u -c \"import setuptools, tokenize;__file__='/private/var/folders/36/zx43_ll10r1dt47nqpbgmrs80000gn/T/pip-DMBGQ3-build/setup.py';f=getattr(tokenize, 'open', open)(__file__);code=f.read().replace('\\r\\n', '\\n');f.close();exec(compile(code, __file__, 'exec'))\" --no-user-cfg install --record /var/folders/36/zx43_ll10r1dt47nqpbgmrs80000gn/T/pip-zR3Z5F-record/install-record.txt --single-version-externally-managed --compile\n[rst2ipynb-0.2.2.p0]     running install\n[rst2ipynb-0.2.2.p0]     error: rst2ipynb requires the Haskell program 'pandoc'.

I like the fix you made, and the install now fails as it should. However because of the standard pip + sage failed install bloat, this means that the actual error is somewhere hidden in a bunch of noise so long that on my machine I actually have to scroll up to see the useful part of the error message. I would not have seen it if I was not reviewing this ticket and knew what to look for. So giving positive review since this fixes the blocker part of this ticket, but I am creating a follow up ticket to make the error messages more user friendly.

For Sage, a new version does not help since we already include the patch.

I'll let you decide how important the patch is for non-Sage users who are doing `pip install rst2ipynb` without having `pandoc` installed. I would say: when in doubt, do make a release. It shouldn't take more than 10 minutes to actually do that.
