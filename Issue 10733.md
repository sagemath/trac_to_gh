Keywords: resultant

for univariate polynomial rings over other polynomial rings, the .resultant() method might fail if the variables are not ordered in a 'good' way (i.e. following the PARI convention). This also affects the discriminant method (which calls resultant)

Here is a patch to detect these cases and do the corresponding computation in a bigger multivariate ring (which is handled by Singular).

Reviewed; all checks out.

Note that this fixes resultant() for polynomial rings over [polynomial rings over exact fields]; resultant() is *not* implemented when the base field is RDF or CDF. I'll open a new ticket to try implement this.
