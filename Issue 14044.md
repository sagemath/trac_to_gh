Currently all string values are converted to lowercase in global options, so checks are case insensitive. This will add an option to allow case distinctions.

Hi Travis,

Sorry, have been meaning to review this for a while as well...

I just looked over the code and **values_case** doesn't seem very meaningful to me. I think that it would be better to have optional argument **case_sensitive** which is either True or False, with whatever default you think reasonable.Â 

I guess with your patch you allow the options to be forced to be either upper case, lower case, or to be case sensitive. Perhaps this is better than simply case sensitive or insensitive. Given that I was happy to always enforce lower case I am perhaps not the best person to comment on what is best here!

Will be happy to finalise a review once some one else comments on this.

Andrew

I like `case_sensitive=True/False` more! I don't really see the point if *forcing* the user to use either lower or upper case, while forcing/not forcing exact replication of the "original" makes sense.

I also think that in automatically generated documentation things should show as entered no matter whether the case is forced or not, i.e. if I have in my code "English", it should show in documentation as "English" even if we accept "english" as well.

Would it be too painful to make "keep as is" the default? All of python, and in particular string matching, is normally fully case sensitive. It feels very strange that this is not, even if it might be considered convenient by some.

In particular, by the time someone is setting options he/she is a stage beyond "beginner" and they'll have to look up the name of the option anyway, so I don't think in practice the convenience will really matter.

In most of python, ambiguity about case is removed by preferring all-lower-case. (I know, singletons `True`, `False`, `None` oddly deviate from that)

Incidentally, the need for options has a code smell to me: I'd start to look for a design flaw if I felt the need to introduce one.

Disagree on this one - I guess you don't use bashrc files etc?

I think that options are useful for either reflecting user preferences (for example, changing how something is displayed, often corresponding to different conventions in the literature), or for controlling parameters to a class (for example, see  the options used in #13131 - which isn't using GlobalOptions, but could).

Hi Travis,

I finally got around to reviewing this. The attached review patch, which is also in the queue, fixes number of doc-string problems (most of which predate your patch) and makes case_sensitive into a proper boolean. The patch is also in the combinat queue. 

Please have a look at the review patch. If you're happy with this then I'll make this a positive review.
