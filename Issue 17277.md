# Issue 17277: Upgrade Maxima to 5.35.1

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17514

Original creator: pbruin

Original creation time: 2014-12-16 12:36:41

CC:  jdemeyer kcrisman fbissey

Keywords: maxima

Tarball: http://pub.math.leidenuniv.nl/~bruinpj/sage/maxima-5.35.1.tar.gz

In view of the recent discussion on whether we should ship vanilla tarballs or stripped ones (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/a9yIdaqNHKU), this is the unmodified upstream tarball.  The size is 28.2 MB, compared to 12.2 MB for the stripped .tar.bz2 of 5.34.1.

Comments on the attached branch:
- Setting `MAKE="make -j1"` in `spkg-install` does not seem necessary; I tested this twice with `make -j12` on a multiprocessor system.
- The trick in `spkg-install` of touching `.info` files to avoid running `makeinfo` does not seem to work anymore.  The system I tested this on does not have `makeinfo`, which led to the new patch `makeinfo.patch`.  (If `makeinfo` is not found, then `$MAKEINFO` is set to `missing --run makeinfo`, which just touches the existing `.info` file.)
- `compile.patch` is superseded by an upstream fix (http://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/bugs/2848/).

Everything looks in order and no other doctests than the one fixed seem to be broken.
