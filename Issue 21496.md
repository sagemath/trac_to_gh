The doc of the `codes` catalog is generated using `sage.misc.rest_index_of_methods.gen_rest_index_table`. This was designed to leave out classes by default (I don't recall why). But `codes` includes several classes, so these do not appear in the generated documentation.

This patch does not modify the default behaviour of `gen_rest_index_table`, but adds an optional argument to turn on including classes. This is then used in `codes`.
