This is harder than some other library clean up ticket. In particular I do not understand why some things are wrapped as `DefaultRinged<T>` instead of just `T`.

For example, why

```
cdef cppclass PBSet "DefaultRinged<BooleSet> "
```

The reason I can gather for the wrapping is a template approach to giving a default value for the ring, but I haven't looked to deeply into it.

However, this is definitely an improvement, so positive review.
