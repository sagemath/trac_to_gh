Keywords: symmetric functions, sf, combinat

There is a todo in `sf.py` to add a tutorial about how to create a new basis in the symmetric functions.  The tutorial will be much easier to read if the only thing that is necessary to implement is a coercion back and forth between a basis so it depends on #18233.
