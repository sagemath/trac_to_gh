# Issue 17997: Fill in tutorial about how to create a new basis in symmetric functions

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18234

Original creator: zabrocki

Original creation time: 2015-04-17 00:11:21

CC:  sage-combinat darij saliola

Keywords: symmetric functions, sf, combinat

There is a todo in `sf.py` to add a tutorial about how to create a new basis in the symmetric functions.  The tutorial will be much easier to read if the only thing that is necessary to implement is a coercion back and forth between a basis so it depends on #18233.

I made some very minor reviewer tweaks (commas, 80 characters per line, and changed the category). If you're okay with my changes, then positive review.
