If you merge it over #16714 you will only see them, I think...

Okay. Really, adding the ticket number to the commit message helps a lot in case like that. Tickets like #16722 would be very hard to review without that `:-P`

OK, here is one more commit (with the ticket number).
I can in principle fix the other commit messages - should I? Or you can review like this?

Yes yes of course, no problem ! But why did you remove PPL and CVXOPT from this list ? Initially it was not about optional solvers only, was it ?

PPL and CVXOPT are mentioned in the lines just above the one you mean, so it was purely
an unnecessary repetition, potentially confusing.

This last commit has not been merged, see the discussion at [sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/tQhromqp9hQ/KDCvCnKEd1kJ).
I opened a new ticket for that commit: #18219.
