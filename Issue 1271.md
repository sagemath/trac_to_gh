An updated spkg can be found at:

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/malb/pkgs/singular-3-0-4-1-20071202.spkg

which installs fine on my notebook and on sage.math. After installing this spkg the attached patch trac1271.patch needs to be applied to fix a trivial doctest failure.

This new release fixes:
* Singular is now GPLv2 or GPLv3
* monitor segfault (#1074)
* spkg-install modularized
