A minor clarification: The classic Jupyter notebook has built-in support for live matplotlib interaction through the `%matplotlib notebook` magic command, but this matplotlib backend does not work in JupyterLab.  The `ipympl` package provides `%matplotlib widget` which works with both versions of Jupyter.

Moving this ticket to 9.4, as it seems unlikely that it will be merged in 9.3, which is in the release candidate stage
