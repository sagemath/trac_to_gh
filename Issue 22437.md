# Issue 22437: Add irreducibles_poset()

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jmantysalo

CC:  tscrim

This patch will add a function that gives the smallest subposet having completion by cuts isomorphic to the lattice. (I.e. the poset of meet- and join- (or both) irreducibles, except the one-element lattice.)

This done, so I put this to needs_review.

Is this still true?

```
Due to implementation detail in Sage, actually isomorphic to the dual of the lattice.
```

No, not anymore. You reviewed the ticket that changed `completion_by_cuts()`.

That is what I was thinking, so it should be removed. Otherwise LGTM.

?? I already did that, see commit 7c6ae98.
