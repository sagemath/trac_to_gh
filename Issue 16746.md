For prime finite fields, we should support a custom modulus:

```
sage: x = polygen(GF(7))
sage: k = GF(7, modulus=x+5)
sage: k.modulus()
x + 6
sage: k.gen()
1
```


We should also make the modulus monic:

```
sage: x = polygen(GF(7))
sage: k.<a> = GF(7^2, modulus=2*x^2-3, impl="pari_ffelt")
sage: k.modulus()
2*x^2 + 4
```

(the Givaro backend already does this)

I get a failing doctest in `src/sage/rings/finite_rings/homset.py` because some ordering changed.

There is something missing here:

```
+ def polynomial(self, name=None):
+ """
+ Return the irreducible characteristic polynomial of the
+ generator of this finite field, i.e., the polynomial `f(x)` so
+ elements of the finite field as elements modulo `f`.
```

Otherwise, this looks fine to me and all tests pass.
I'll give a final look a little bit later this afternoon.

I just moved that sentence, in fact it dates back to
