```
sage -t src/sage/sets/totally_ordered_finite_set.py
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/sets/totally_ordered_finite_set.py", line 218, in sage.sets.totally_ordered_finite_set.TotallyOrderedFiniteSet
Failed example:
    for e in [1,'a',(0, 0)]:
        f = A(e)
        l = (e == f,
             cmp(e,f) == cmp(type(e),type(f)),
             cmp(f,e) == cmp(type(f),type(e)))
        print(l)
Expected:
    (False, True, True)
    (False, True, True)
    (False, True, True)
Got:
    (False, False, False)
    (False, True, True)
    (False, False, False)
