This patch extends the functionality of bruhat_poset and introduces new parabolic_bruhat_graph for finite Weyl groups. 

Let W be a finite Weyl group and let W_S be the subgroup of W generated by reflections associated with a subset S of simple roots. Then the cosets W / W_S have unique representatives of minimal length which are ordered by the Bruhat order of W. Similarly for W_S \ W. These poset structures appear in many places, e.g. intersection cohomology of generalized flag varieties or nilpotent Lie algebra cohomology.

This patch adds a parameters index_set (= S) and side (left / right).

Introducing parabolic_bruhat_graph is ugly. Ideally, one would just extend the existing bruhat_graph. However, this method is based upon bruhat_interval which belongs to categories/coxeter_groups.py 

I was unsure where to put the code, which I haven't written yet nor which I need  in the foreseeable future anyway. Since it seems that the best course of action would be to implement class (or category?) for parabolic subroot systems / groups I think that one more method for Weyl group is not much of an issue.

The `has_key` is being deprecated (removed?) in python3 in favor of the `in` syntax (which I believe is faster...?). Also I agree with Darij since this loop is so small, I'd pull the `side == "right"` statement outside as:

```
if side == "right":
    for y in g:
        r = y*x.inverse()
    if x.length() < y.length() and r in ref:
        d[x][y] = r
else:
    for y in g:
        r = x.inverse()*y
    if x.length() < y.length() and r in ref:
        d[x][y] = r
```
