CC:  @nthiery @hivert @tscrim @saliola

Keywords: monoids, days64

It will mostly be a re-writing of the sage-combinat patch finite_semigroup-nt.patch of Nicolas M. Thiéry.

The aim is to provide some specific methods for
* H-trivial monoids
* R-trivial monoids
* L-trivial monoids
* J-trivial monoids

As well as several examples.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18001

The failure comes from the fact that the category of `RTrivialMonoids().Finite()` is not enumerated, as opposed to the category of `Semigroups().Finite().FinitelyGenerated()`. So I think you just have to add `.FinitelyGenerated()`.

From the code, it also looks like you want `JTrivialMonoids().Finite()` to imply `FinitelyGenerated()` since you are giving it a distinguished generating set.

Quick doc comment: Sphinx doesn't like `*`H`-preorder*`; instead use ``H`-*preorder*`. Also, typo `preoder`.
