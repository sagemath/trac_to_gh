We remove another case of the obstacle to modularization described in #32414: Importing a class from a far away Python module just for the purpose of `isinstance` testing.

Because this use of `SchemeHomset_generic`, `SchemeHomset_points` only happens in two files, we don't bother with introducing some abc and just use `try...except` around the import.

(cherry-picked from #32432)
