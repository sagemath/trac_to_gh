`__getslice__` has been deprecated for a long time in Python. This patch adds equivalent functionality to `__getitem__`, which is where the functionality should be.

Currently there is one failing test in `"devel/sage/sage/rings/finite_rings/homset.py"`.

```
sage: H = Hom(GF(32, 'a'), GF(1024, 'b'))
sage: type(H[2:4])    # w/o patch
<class 'sage.structure.sequence.Sequence_generic'>
sage: type(H[2:4])    # w/ patch
<type 'list'>
```

Suggestions to solve this problem are welcome.

What are in both case the types of "H" and say "H[1]"? I am actually not to worried here, I don't think the individual elements of H have ever been of type  sage.structure.sequence.Sequence_generic I am suspecting that's just a type for the slice. In this context a list is probably just as valid. We should check what the test is supposed to "test", but it may just a test that slicing is working.

Seems like a fairly reasonable output to me does the doctest complains about formatting? If it is just that, I would just add a patch to take into account the new format.

I may be able to test this a little bit later.
