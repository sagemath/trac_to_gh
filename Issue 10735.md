This is a frequently requested feature.  We should start with some little script that does this, and build on it.  I tried all the following, and ran the test suite and it worked fine. 

- rm SAGE_ROOT/local/lib/*.a
- rm SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/build/lib.*
- rm SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/build/temp.*
- strip SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/Singular-* SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/gfan   # gfan is a huge win.
- jsmath image fonts are in MoinMoin and are *HUGE*.  Just delete everything related to moinmoin...
- strip SAGE_ROOT/local/lib/*.so
- rm -rf SAGE_ROOT/local/python/site-package/MoinMoin 
- rm all files in SAGE_LOCAL/devel/sage/sage/ that begin "* Generated by Cython"  (I didn't do that)

Slightly related: `sage -crap ...` (`local/bin/sage-crap`)

Note that we already have a few `*clean` targets in the top-level Makefile; there could be more (like `strip`), and some of the others could perhaps get improved or extended.

I personally wouldn't use `-strip` for anything else than really stripping debug symbols, i.e., if it is e.g. intended to delete also static libraries (which may be needed if someone installs some package, not necessarily an spkg), I'd choose a different name for such an option (or `make` target).

FUTURE: Yes, but in a future version of this?

FUTURE: It's safer to put a small string in each, to avoid confusion.  This happens automatically when you build a binary with "sage -bdist".   Anyway, this is something that could be added later.

Ben:

1. Regarding the size savings, I started with a binary... so we may see a difference.

2. Regarding the startup time failure, this has nothing to do with my patch.  It routinely fails on sage.math.  It's a test that it isn't taking more than 2 seconds on sage.math.  I put it in back when we got the startup time down to solidly be < 1 second on sage.math, since I didn't want people to screw that up.  They did though.
