# Issue 29790: Bug with Automaton.language()

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30027

Original creator: MatthieuDien

Original creation time: 2020-06-30 09:10:12

Keywords: automata

It seems there is a bug or a lack of documentation about how to use `Automaton.language()`.

For example:

```
>>> for w in (automata.Word([0])*automata.Word([0]).language():
>>>     print(w)
# Does not print anything
>>> for w in (automata.Word([0]).kleene_star()).language():
>>>     print(w)
[]
[0]
```


But when the automaton is determinized `Automaton.language()` works.

Moving to 9.4, as 9.3 has been released.
