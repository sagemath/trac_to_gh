Hi Frédéric,

The description should mention that this ticket also refactors all the code doc for better conformance to the coding standards; thanks by the way! I checked those changes and they seem ok. While you are at it you might want to:

- Fix the couple remaining "Returns ..."
- `characteristic_quasisymmetric_function`: put a proper title for the doc
- line 1465: remove the `returns the`

As for the algorithm itself: this sounds reasonable, but I haven't checked the details. Also I haven't convinced myself it's uniform.

My patchbot should finish its work on this ticket and report shortly.

And by the way, could you put in the documentation of `random_element` that your sampler is uniform. At some point, I would like to implement some automatic testing for random samplers.

I have added in the doc that it should be uniform random

I have added in the ticket description that this is also a clean-up ticket

I have made a little more clean-up

I am not sure what to do with all the "`Returns ****.`" Should I remove all the `s` and all the final dots ? Is there really unanimity on this matter ?

I have not yet looked at `characteristic_quasisymmetric_function`

The developpers manual is rather specific about this. I believe the consensus is that this does not deserve wreaking havoc by changing it all other the source code; but when one is already changing a line or file heavily for conformance, one might as well go for it.

Thanks!

well, this looks like a good ticket to start.

- the patchbot has checked that all tests pass and the doc build

So you only have to check if you are happy with the code. If so, then please set to positive review.
