# Issue 23297: Rational reconstruct over a generic univariate polynomial ring

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23534

Original creator: edgarcosta

Original creation time: 2017-07-24 16:01:16

I have implemented rational reconstruct over a generic univariate polynomial ring.

I'm not sure if I put in the right place, if not, please let me know.

A couple more quick changes:

In the following, Where should be When:


```
Returns a tuple of two polynomials `(n, d)` where ``self`` `* d` is congruent to `n` modulo `m`.  

Where `\deg(n) \leq n_deg` and `\deg(d) \leq d_deg`, the default value of `n_deg` and `d_deg` is `floor(\deg(m) - 1)/2)`.}}}


Also, in the documentation you need an empty line after each ::

Finally, it could be rebased on the newest development branch.  

I'm currently applying and playing with the code.

Updated and trailing whitespace removed.

Played with it, looks good and all tests pass.

Missing (real) author name. Also, the one-line description and `ALGORITHM:` needs a period, and use ```None``` for code formating. Last, I might consider doing the one-line description as

```
        Return a tuple of two polynomials ``(n, d)``,
        where ``self * d`` is congruent to ``n`` modulo ``m`` and
        ``n.degree() <= n_deg`` and ``d.degree() <= d_deg``.
```

and maybe make the `INPUT:` a bit more concise (same for `m_deg`):

```
        - ``n_deg`` -- (optional) an integer; the default is `\lfloor (\deg(m) - 1)/2 \rfloor`
```

Thanks Aly!

Period for the `ALGORITHM:` block. Once done, you can set a positive review on my behalf.
