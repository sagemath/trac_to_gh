The plan seems to be for removal in python 3.12. Somewhat connected, does sage depend on python packages that are in a somewhat abandoned state and therefore will just stop being buildable? Do we have some kind of audit?

We just caught one such package that does not work with 3.9 in #31372.

The closest thing we have to an audit is upgrade tickets for python versions in alpha development state, such as #30766.

OK, I could have flagged pari_jupyter earlier, but I am more worried about packages sage_lib depends on. pari_jupyter not working is probably affecting a very small number of users and not an obstacle to sage itself. I guess in the back of my mind I see cysignals going out of maintenance since Jeroen disappeared. cypari has somewhat been rescued but could also be a concern.

`cysignals` is likely going to be the biggest problem at some point. I see hints of trouble in #31350 (Julia package providing Sage) already

Changing priority from major to critical.
