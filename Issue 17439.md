The following groebner basis computation over integers is 
not correct (compare with M2 or Magma): 

```
sage: R.<x,y,z> = PolynomialRing(ZZ, 3, order='lex')
sage: I = Ideal(13*x*y*z+6*x*y+78*x*z+36*x-11*y^2*z-66*y*z,
168*x*y*z+84*x*y+1008*x*z+504*x+12*y^3-154*y^2*z+72*y^2-924*y*z,
-168*x^2*y*z^2-84*x^2*y*z-1008*x^2*z^2-504*x^2*z+x*y^3*z+6*x*y^3+154*x*y^2*z^2+6*x*y^2*z+36*x*y^2+924*x*y*z^2-11*y^4*z-66*y^3*z
);
sage: gI  = R*( I.groebner_basis() ) 
sage: len(gens(gI)) # expected 3
4
sage: gI
Ideal (x*y*z + 78*x*y + 6*x*z + 468*x + 144*y^3 - 143*y^2*z + 864*y^2 - 858*y*z, 84*x*y + 504*x + 156*y^3 - 154*y^2*z + 936*y^2 - 924*y*z, 156*y^5*z + 72*y^5 + 1562*y^4*z^2 + 1728*y^4*z + 432*y^4 - 1694*y^3*z^3 + 9372*y^3*z^2 + 4752*y^3*z - 10164*y^2*z^3, 312*y^3*z + 144*y^3 - 308*y^2*z^2 + 1872*y^2*z + 864*y^2 - 1848*y*z^2) of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y, z over Integer Ring
```

M2 code:

```
R = ZZ[x,y,z,MonomialOrder=>Lex]
I = ideal{13*x*y*z+6*x*y+78*x*z+36*x-11*y^2*z-66*y*z,
168*x*y*z+84*x*y+1008*x*z+504*x+12*y^3-154*y^2*z+72*y^2-924*y*z,
-168*x^2*y*z^2-84*x^2*y*z-1008*x^2*z^2-504*x^2*z+x*y^3*z+6*x*y^3+154*x*y^2*z^2+6*x*y^2*z+36*x*y^2+924*x*y*z^2-11*y^4*z-66*y^3*z}

This is fixed in Singular-4.0.2, so this bug should be resolved once #17254 is merged.

I've removed the stopgap, added a doctest, and updated the doc of that function to (IMO) the more standard format.

Changing component from packages: standard to algebra.

Replying to [comment:3 roed]:

Sure, but here some words of warning:
If you try hard, you will probably find more bugs in groebner computation over integers. 

I suppose there at least are some bugs left of the sort:
easy example, should finish quickly, but it runs forever and eats up all mem.

I may try to catch some in my spare free time using my 
testbot framework https://github.com/jakobkroeker/infiniteTests.Singular (in development)

Singular is merged, so shall we also merge this ticket as well?
