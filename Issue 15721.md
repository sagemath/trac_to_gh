CC:  @tscrim sage-combinat

There is a bug in the implementation of the product in partition algebras.


```
sage: A = PartitionAlgebra(1,17)
sage: g = SetPartitionsAk(1).list()
sage: a = A[g[1]]
sage: a
P[{{-1}, {1}}]
sage: a*a
P[{{-1}, {1}}]
```


This should return


```
17*P[{{-1}, {1}}]
```

Good catch! I've improved it a bit. First of all, bugs fixed should be doctested to ensure that they don't reappear when someone later copies bad code (or for other reasons). Second, there is no good reason to check for `len(part_list) > 0` after a call to `part_list[0]`; that test should have been removed rather than corrected.

Bad news is that someone else will have to review this ticket now. :)
