Keywords: crystals

It is good to Cythonize things that can be called quite frequently.

I also go through and change the base class to `ClonableArray` from `CombinatorialElement`. This helps out things like the R-matrix computation, which relies heavily on hashing and is slow because `CombinatorialElement` uses the string representations to hash. However, all crystal elements should be hashable, so we can just hash the input.

I'm also taking this opportunity to do a little bit of extra cleanup of the methods.

CPU times: user 11.2 s, sys: 52 ms, total: 11.2 s

vs the old

```

Fixed.
