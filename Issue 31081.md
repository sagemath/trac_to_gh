In preparation for dropping support for Python 3.6 in Sage 9.4 (#30551), we issue a deprecation warning when `configure` accepts a system python 3.6. For example, on `ubuntu-bionic` Python 3.6 is the default, but Python 3.7 is also available, and users will want to consider using that by the configure option `--with-python=...`.

This seems okay, but I am not going to be able to test it very effectively: I don't have easy access to a system which has Python 3.6 as its latest version, and I don't want to set one up.
