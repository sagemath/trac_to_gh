CC:  jpflori @embray gouezel @kiwifb

I suggest to upgrade `glpk` to the latest available version (4.60 at the time of writing). The current version has been superseded in Gentoo and the formatting of the output has changed.
Here are the tasks for this upgrade:
 1) use `spkg-src` instead of patching `configure` directly
 2) drop the `have_error.patch` has the functionality is now upstream without having to change sage's code.
 3) clean up `SPKG.txt` and other files so they are reflecting the current reality more closely without obsolete historical comments

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20710

Still doctests to fix.

`@` jpflori could you have a look at the cygwin part? Upstream has added some stuff to add `--no-undefined` if host is `*-*-cygwin*` but you are also checking how gmp/mpir is built if host_os is `cygwin*` at the moment I have adapted the patch but may be it is safe to drop it completely. From `configure.ac`

Are you sure about this? As I mentioned in #19525, GLPK upstream accepted the Sage patch **with significant modifications**.

I had been using `glpk-4.57` for a while (before moving to 4.60 in my private overlay before starting this ticket) and I had only one doctest failure (version reported is different and cannot just be ellipsed away because that doctest already uses tolerance) for a long time - until some recent MIP work which introduced new doctests. The failures are in verbosity and nothing about error reporting. 

But to be sure do we already have a doctest for the functionality and if not, do you have a test case?

The default behaviour for GLPK when encountering an error is to print an error message and then `abort()`. This printing of the error message is done the same way as the usual printing of messages, for example with verbose output. The printing can be customized with a hook function.

GLPK also has an error hook, which is called after printing the error message. It can be used to do something else besides `abort()`. In the case of Sage, this does a `longjmp()` through the `sig_on()` mechanism, raising a Python exception.

In Sage, we want the usual messages to appear normally, but we want to intercept the error messages and convert them to a Python exception. For this to work, we need a way to detect whether we are handling an error or not. I added a patch to GLPK to support this. It allows to checking whether `env->err_file` is `NULL` or not. This `env->err_file` is set to some non-NULL value when entering the error handler and is set back to NULL after printing the error message, before the error hook.

The part which upstream did not accept was the setting back of `env->err_file` to NULL because they don't want to officially support error recovery. In upstream's view, once GLPK has encountered an error, it is in an invalid state and there is no way to recover.

This test tries to verify that no exception is raised when the optimization process is terminated early because of a set time limit.
However, this is not actually true; no exception is raised only when GLPK has a feasible solution available when the time limit expires. 
Here (in version 4.60) it does not have a feasible solution available. I have not checked the details. 
On my machine, increasing the time limit to 0.1 fixes this test. Needless to say, this is of course a brittle test.

Thank you, I prefer repacking rather than "custom" patches to configure, Makefile.in and al. Of course, I would prefer running autoreconf on the spot from a pristine tarball but that trade off has already been sold in sagemath.

Any ideas what is going on with the error reporting code?

That's true, but only C internals which are actually exposed by the library. This concerns some internal structure of GLPK which is not exposed by any API.
