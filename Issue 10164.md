I have taken everything available in tickets #7221,  #7222, #7223,  #7224, #7225,  #7226

and made a single branch out of that. The doc builds and pass the doctests.

The build error was due to referring to some more nonexistent (yet) sections, I think.

For example, any of the _original_ authors could feel free to weigh in...

I made sure one uses the new style of doctest continuation.

Thanks, then all that is needed is checking that [this commit](http://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit/?id=06b08bffd679bad37ab5589b7129e0490e44016f) is correct linguistically.

Comment by chapoton created at 2015-06-03 10:17:29

Maybe we can get this into sage despite some eventual "linguistic issues" ?


---

Comment by chapoton created at 2015-08-10 18:56:43

Ok, guys, I vote for inclusion of that, even if not perfect. PatchBot is green-happy, right now.

Could one of you express its agreement and put this into positive review, please ?

Ping ?

I only see a minor linguistic issue with the use of "Ésto". Since 2010 we do not place a diacritic accent in demonstrative pronouns. As in
"código fuente para los usuarios de Linux, OS X y Windows. Ésto provee
+   a los usuarios de una mayor flexibilidad para que modifiquen el sistema."
should be
"código fuente para los usuarios de Linux, OS X y Windows. Esto provee
+   a los usuarios de una mayor flexibilidad para que modifiquen el sistema."

And in
"+donde :math:`h>0` está dado y es pequeño. Ésto, junto con la ED, dan"
should be
"+donde :math:`h>0` está dado y es pequeño. Esto, junto con la ED, dan"

Let me know if I can be of any help.

Thank you so much!  Is this true only in Spain or also in the broader Spanish-speaking world?

If you can put your name in the "Reviewers" section that would be very helpful.

Prior to 2010, the use of diacritic accent for demonstrative pronouns "este","ese" and "aquel" was recommended whenever they could be confusion as to whether interpret them as adjective or pronoun. So, other demonstrative pronouns like "esto","eso" or "aquello" which do not have adjective counterparts never required diacritic accent.
As from 2010 revision from RAE (Real academia Española) it is discouraged even in the former case ("este","ese" and "aquel") though allowed.
These rules are common for all spanish language countries, since it's a  panhispanic work.

Issues I see when compiling.
* A broken link or two - trying to fix.
* `/src/doc/output/html/es/tutorial/index.html` has a link to `sage/src/doc/output/html/es/tutorial/py-modindex.html`, which however doesn't exist.  It _does_ exist in the English and the French translation.  Any ideas on what happened there - did I compile the doc wrong?  (Just did `make doc`.)  Similarly for `sage/src/doc/output/html/fr/tutorial/genindex-all.html`, which exists but doesn't have anything in it.  Maybe this is because not everything is in the doc yet.
* Also had to fix a doctest.

Pushing this.  The module list in the other language docs has broken links anyway, and there are no elements to the gen index because there is nothing to put in it.  Pushing.

Thanks chapoton and everyone else!

chapoton, do you know what the status of #10180 is with respect to the stuff here?  I guess one could just only add the modules there (including restoring any needed links).

I just checked out the branch, rebuilt the entire documentation with 'make doc-pdf' successfully creating the SageTutorial.pdf under sage/src/doc/output/pdf/es/tutorial
Could you indicate in which file did you get the error?
