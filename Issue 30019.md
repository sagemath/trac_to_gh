There appears to be an issue with the iterator for the Stein-Watkins database in Sage 9.1 the second time I use next.  See I/O below attempting to follow example from documentation:


```
sage: version()
'SageMath version 9.1, Release Date: 2020-05-20'
sage: d = SteinWatkinsAllData(0)
sage: C = next(d)
sage: C
Stein-Watkins isogeny class of conductor 11
sage: next(d)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-101-9b2daf1403f5> in <module>()
----> 1 next(d)

/Applications/SageMath/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/sage/databases/stein_watkins.py in __next__(self)
    240 
    241     def __next__(self):
--> 242         return next(self._iter)
    243 
    244     next = __next__

/Applications/SageMath/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/sage/databases/stein_watkins.py in __iter__(self)
    226                     yield C
    227                 x = L.split()
--> 228                 N = int(x[0])
    229                 C = SteinWatkinsIsogenyClass(N)
    230                 C.rank = int(x[2])

ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: b'[0,-1,1,0,0]'
```


If it matters, I am running this on macOS 10.15.5 using a prebuilt binary.
