Assignee: @williamstein

We introduce a new feature: user globals. The idea is to store somewhere a dictionary with the user-space globals which can then be used to inject global variables.

This ticket implements the framework for this and fixes this bug in `cython_lambda` as proof-of-concept:

```
        sage: a = 25
        sage: f = cython_lambda('double x', 'sage.math.sin(x) + sage.a')
        sage: f(10)  # known bug
        24.455978889110629
        sage: a = 50
        sage: f(10)  # known bug
        49.455978889110632
```

Executing this gives

```
sage: a = 25
sage: f = cython_lambda('double x', 'sage.math.sin(x) + sage.a')
sage: f(10)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
KeyError: 'math'
```

Actually, the floating point ones are fixed at #13533, so I guess this globals thing is still all this ticket is about.  However, that's not documented at #13533, so I figure I'll at least post this error message for posterity.
