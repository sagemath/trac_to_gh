Keywords: module

After #10513, only the following module classes still inherit from `Module_old`, which is being deprecated:
1. `sage.modular.abvar.finite_subgroup.FiniteSubgroup`
2. `sage.modular.overconvergent.genus0.OverconvergentModularFormsSpace`
3. `sage.structure.formal_sum.FormalSums`
The goal of this ticket is to make these inherit from `Module` instead.

Hi Peter,

I do only have very minor points.

This error message is not very nice

```
"x does not define an element of self"
```

I would rather be more explicit

```
"x (={}) does not define an element of {}".format(x, self)
```

(I notice that you are not responsible for that)

Why did you create the method `generator_orders`? Why not instead replace the code in `abelian_iterator`?

## not for this ticket

Do you know why `FormalSums` is in `sage.structure`? It makes no sense to me. It should rather be in `sage.modules`. Moreover it intersects very much with the combinatorial free modules

```
sage: C = CombinatorialFreeModule(ZZ,GF(7))
sage: C.an_element()
2*B[0] + 2*B[1] + 3*B[2]
```

What do you think? 

what `gens_py.py` is doing in `sage.structure`?! I would rather put it in `sage.combinat` or `sage.misc.`

```

I think you should consider putting LazyFormat in the error messages (it's basically a drop-in replacement) or argue that the relevant error messages are only constructed with really cheap arguments in time-critical situations, or that these error messages never get raised in time-critical situations.
