> I don't like the added complexity of having 3 branches in every function. Why not just use the generic case everywhere?

The main reason is to avoid numerical noise (I want the cosine of a real number to be a real number). You have

```
sage: a = CIF(2,0)
sage: I = CIF.gen()
sage: ((I*a).exp() + (-I*a).exp()) / 2
-0.4161468365471424? + 0.?e-16*I
```

It should be fine to remove the imaginary branch, but then it would be less precise

```
sage: a = CIF(0,2)
sage: b1 = CIF(0, a.imag().cosh())
sage: b1.diameter()
1.33393183261575e-16
sage: b2 = ((I*a).exp() + (-I*a).exp()) / 2
sage: b2.diameter()
2.36079803558624e-16
```
