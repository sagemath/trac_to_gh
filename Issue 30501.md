Currently, the sage code contains `_test_xyz` methods that are invoked via doctests and discovered via a custom `TestSuit` class. In this ticket, we are proposing to replace this custom designed test discovery by using the established pytest framework https://docs.pytest.org/ (this is inline with #28936 - using mainstraim Python test infrastructure).

The changes are as follows:
- Move `_test_xyz` from `module` to new file `test_module`
- Rewrite test using pytest (which is straightforward and more or less only amounts to removing all the custom code involving `self_tester`)
- Remove invoking the `TestSuit` in the doctests
- Instead, add the corresponding test elements as parameterized fixtures for pytest

For the moment, I did this only for one test method in `sets_cat` to illustrate the process.
What is still remaining is to call `pytest` as part of the build process so that the newly added tests are found and checked.

Advantages of this approach:
- Reuse standard test infrastructure instead of a custom test discovery interface (this is a big plus as we do not have to maintain it ourself, especially given the large list of todo's in the TestSuite code)
- With this there also comes better error messages in case a test fails.
- Easier onboarding of new Python developers
- Clear separation of test methods vs production code. For example, the `test_*.py` files can easily be excluded from distribution.
- Good support by IDE (auto completion, test discovery and easier invocation)

Disadvantages of this approach:
- Current developer have to learn the new conventions (files need to be named `test_*.py` and tests methods need to start with `test_`) and pytest
- Tests no longer live in the same file as the code (I would say this is an advantage, but some people may prefer to have them really close together).


What do you think? (Please feel free to add more people to cc if you think they may be interested.)

If you run `pytest` on this branch, it invokes `test_elements_eq_reflexive` with the arguments `['a', 'b', 'c', 'ab', 'ac', 'ba', 'bc', 'ca', 'cb', 'abc']`. 
This is the same as the doctest for `finite_semigroups`:


```
Now, let us look at the structure of the semigroup::

        sage: S = FiniteSemigroups().example(alphabet = ('a','b','c'))
        sage: S.cayley_graph(side="left", simple=True).plot()
        Graphics object consisting of 60 graphics primitives
        sage: S.j_transversal_of_idempotents() # random (arbitrary choice)
        ['acb', 'ac', 'ab', 'bc', 'a', 'c', 'b']

    We conclude by running systematic tests on this semigroup::

        sage: TestSuite(S).run(verbose = True)
        running ._test_an_element() . . . pass
        running ._test_associativity() . . . pass
        running ._test_cardinality() . . . pass
        running ._test_category() . . . pass
        running ._test_construction() . . . pass
        running ._test_elements() . . .
          Running the test suite of self.an_element()
          running ._test_category() . . . pass
          running ._test_eq() . . . pass
          running ._test_new() . . . pass
          running ._test_not_implemented_methods() . . . pass
          running ._test_pickling() . . . pass
          pass
        running ._test_elements_eq_reflexive() . . . pass
        running ._test_elements_eq_symmetric() . . . pass
        running ._test_elements_eq_transitive() . . . pass
        running ._test_elements_neq() . . . pass
        running ._test_enumerated_set_contains() . . . pass
        running ._test_enumerated_set_iter_cardinality() . . . pass
        running ._test_enumerated_set_iter_list() . . . pass
        running ._test_eq() . . . pass
        running ._test_new() . . . pass
        running ._test_not_implemented_methods() . . . pass
        running ._test_pickling() . . . pass
        running ._test_some_elements() . . . pass
```

So the idea would be to replace this doctest by `pytest`. There are a few more doctests of this form that can be replaced in a similar vain by adding the corresponding elements to the `test_elements` list.

A few? Currently `_test_elements_eq_reflexive` is invoked by `TestSuite(object).run()` whenever `object` happens to be in the category of sets. This is a huge, dynamically determined list.

Thanks for this clarification. I'm setting this ticket to "needs_work" because the branch in this form is not complete -- it effectively removes existing tests for  `_test_elements_eq_reflexive`. Without a much more complete branch that reaches test parity, this idea is difficult to evaluate.

Overall I think there is a conflict here between the dynamic nature of our category system and what seems to amount to a static determination of what objects to test for what properties (in the proposed changes).

But even for the test function that you already added, it is only testing a few objects.

So to get parity even for this one test function, `category_instances` would have to be extended vastly -- if I understand the design correctly.

It is unclear who should do this work and why.

I've now vastly extended the tests, and replaced some of the TestSuite calls by pytest. A handful of test methods are still missing to get full feature parity (will do this later), but I hope the idea and design get clearer now (at the cost that there are bigger changes).

The following change is characteristic for the aim of migrating from Sage's custom TestSuite framework to pytest:

```
-        sage: TestSuite(C).run()
+        sage: import pytest
+        sage: pytest.main(["-r", "test_finite_semigroups.py"])

I think you may be missing that the category of an object is not statically known but is computed by code.

The design is as follows. Say you have a category `LieGroups` combining the categories `Manifolds` and `Groups`.
Then you:
1. Create `manifolds_test` and `groups_test` files, specifying the category tests that should hold for all objects of this category.
2. Create a `liegroups_test` file, specifying in `category_instances` the examples of Lie groups you want to test, say `SO(3)` and `SU(2)`. Moreover, add test methods that are particular for the cateogory of Lie groups.

When run, the code then looks at these examples, determines that they are objects of the categories Manifolds, Groups and Lie Groups and collects all tests from `manifolds_test`, `groups_test` and `liegroups_test`.

This can already be seen in action in the code, where the finite semigroups inhert tests from the category of sets and of finite sets.

Would it not be better to have one test file for each module (... whose doctest currently has calls to `TestSuite`)?

Hello!

Thanks for bringing me in the conversation. It's been
ten years since I designed TestSuite (with the help
from many). Since that time, Python and the available
testing tools have evolved a lot. I am
glad to see efforts going into rethinking the design
in this new context, questioning the implementation,
and studying alternatives that would reach the
same design goals but better suit the context.
Especially toward using
now standard infrastructure and practice to reduce
both the technical debt and the entry barrier for
new devs and/or for integration with other software.

```

(the rant may be a bit long, so I am splitting this into several comments).

So, what were these design goals:

(I) Hardening library and user defined algebraic structures, and beyond

The tests are there for checking the internal consistency
of category code and for checking that parents (and their
elements, morphisms, ...) satisfy the specifications of their
categories (e.g. axioms). Supporting user defined algebraic structures is
a must. In my research area we routinely create new algebraic
structures, and when doing so TestSuite is a daily tool:
practice has told me that, once the implementation of
that algebraic structure pass the testsuite, most of the time
it's actually correct (certainly something that is research
area dependent!).

In some cases, it even becomes a research tool: I am not
sure whether the newly defined algebraic structure actually
satisfy the axioms I want it to satisfy, and I use TestSuite
to actually run checks. And use post-mortem instrospection
with the debugger to actually recover the counter examples ot
my conjectures.

The next step in this direction is to work toward merging
the `_test_xxx` methods and `_is_xxx` methods: most of the time,
the code is mostly the same: checking whether axiom xxx is
satisfied. What changes is how thorough the test is, and
how failures are reported. I have toyed around with the idea
with prototypes in sage-semigroups. Alas I never got to actually
converge to a proposal for Sage. But this is something we want
to keep in mind.

(II) Categories as bookshelves of code, documentation and tests

Each category models some algebraic realm. 
Like the bookshelf about Group Theory in a library,
the category of groups in GAP or Sage ties together
everything that applies to all groups: code, documentation,
and tests. In a perfect world where the same system would
be used for computations and proofs, I would include here
mathematical statements (e.g. formulae for the axioms)
and proofs! Then, there are subshelves for group elements,
group morphisms, ... Subshelves for particular types of
groups, and so on.

There are several ways to implement that tying together.
In GAP, categories are a mere filters; each method is
tied to a category through an individual declaration.
And the language uses a bespoke method resolution that
data. In [SageMath](SageMath) instead, we decided to rely on
standard OO method resolution, grouping together methods
in classes. Both approaches have their advantages notably
in terms of flexibility left to organize the code, and
enable user extensions to existing categories.


Two features are required for testing purposes:

(a) Recovering all the tests that one wants to run to check an object in category A

(b) For each of them, resolving which test method is to be called. Indeed, a subcategory may overload a _test_xxx method when, for example, it has a more efficient way to check xxx.


Note that (b) is of the same nature as when resolving a usual method call. It thus seems highly desirable to use the exact same resolution mechanism as for code.

(III) Scalability

Nothing much to say here: whatever design is chosen should scale to
the rich hierarchy of categories in [SageMath](SageMath), with all the mantras
(axioms, ...) that were implemented to support that richness.

A critical bit is to satisfy as much as possible the Single Source
Of Truth principle. E.g. if at some point I want to refine the
category of a parent (e.g. because a new category was created),
I should only need to update a single location in the code.

Oh, that's wonderful feedback! This kind of deep insight is hard to get if you only read the existing code and don't know the story behind it's origin. Thanks a lot for your detailed account.

Please don't take this proposal as a critics of your work on the TestSuite. I was actually amazed when I discovered that Sage has it's own testing framework. The main idea behind this ticket was to outsource the cost of maintenance of such a framework to the broader Python community, so that we can focus on the math-related elements.

Concerning your points, I'm happy to report that the proposed design should fit all the points you mentioned. In short:

(I): It is flexible enough to accommodate new user-defined categories and examples.

(II): It relies on pytest's discovery mechanism, which makes it very transparent which tests are run for a given category object.

(III): Scalability is a bit hard to judge for me, since I'm not that familiar with all the possible edge cases. But so far I had no problems migrating the existing code.
In particular, the "single source of truth principle" applies, since the testing code only relies on the calculated super categories.


Hence, I would like to invite you to play around with the new design and see if it's works for your use cases. Basic documentation about pytest is added in #31003. Let me know if you encounter any problems.

Merry Christmas!
