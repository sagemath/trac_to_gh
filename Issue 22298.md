Keywords: chart, manifolds

The following is a bug:

```
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M')
sage: X.<x,y> = M.chart()
sage: X.add_restrictions((x^2+y^2<1, [x>0, abs(y)<1]))
sage: X.valid_coordinates(2,0)
...
AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'subs'
```

It occurs because of some lack of depth in the analysis of the coordinate restrictions (here `x<sup>2+y</sup>2<1 or (x>0 and abs(y)<1)`). The current ticket fixes it by introducing a recursive function to check the coordinate restrictions.
