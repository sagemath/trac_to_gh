# Issue 32484: Remove abuse of predefined x in doctests

For example in `src/sage/rings/number_field/number_field.py`

```
        sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2 - 2)
```


This leads to numerous errors when `sage.symbolic` is not available (#32601).

Many `NumberField` and `FiniteField` definitions
use a polynomial in `x`.

The corresponding documentation examples
would be improved by first defining `x` as:

```
sage: x = polygen(ZZ)
```

Many calculus and plotting examples use a symbolic variable `x`.

The corresponding documentation examples
would be improved by first defining `x` as:

```
sage: x = SR.var('x')
```

Perhaps, but that's not in the scope of this ticket.

Some of these fixes are done in #32609.
