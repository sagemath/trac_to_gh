# Issue 29970: Deprecate sage.misc.dist.install_scripts

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30207

This function does not belong into sagelib. If it is still needed at all, it should become a script in sage-the-distribution.

`install_scripts` is also mentioned in one place in the sage installation guide, `src/doc/en/installation/source.rst`. While updating that, also https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/source.html#installation-in-a-multiuser-environment should be updated.

Sage development has entered the release candidate phase for 9.3. Setting a new milestone for this ticket based on a cursory review of ticket status, priority, and last modification date.

Here's a branch. I removed `hg`, `kash`, and `M2` from the scripts to be installed, since those are not connected to Sage packages anymore. Questions:

- should we remove `from .dist import install_scripts` from `sage.misc.all`?
- `install_scripts` is used in `docker/Dockerfile`. Is this necessary?

I did not do any updating of https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/source.html#installation-in-a-multiuser-environment, by the way.

Thanks! Someone can take care of `docker/Dockerfile` in a later ticket, if it's an issue.

No, only after removing the function, I'd say.
