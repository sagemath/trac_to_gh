If its a beta version then we shoudn't save it as `cython-0.21.tar.gz`. Tarball names must be unique over time, otherwise you'll have to manually delete the old cached version.

This ticket isn't yet needs_review (and the ticket description clearly states that it's a beta), so I don't consider that a problem. It's easier for me to simply rename the tarball than to edit `build/pkgs/cython/*`.
