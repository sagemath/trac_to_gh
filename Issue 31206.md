I recently made a new version of eclib, which will only affect the saturation of points on elliptic curves over Q.  The interface for this (in the saturation() method for elliptic curves over Q) has some problems.  Mainly, it does not do a good job of choosing the real precision which mwrank should work at, and also (due to shortcomings in eclib which are now improved) (1) when saturation at one prime fails owing to precision being to low, Sage has no way to do something sensible such as raise an error, or put the call into a loop in which the precision is increased; (2) there is no way to saturate at a single prime, or a range of primes, only at all primes or all primes except 2 or all primes up to some bound.  The new eclib version allows for a first and last prime at which saturation should be done.  The rationale here is that if you have saturated points on one curve and map them to another using an isogeny, then the image points will autimatically be saturated at all primes dividing the isogeny degree.

I don't see a sensible wway to dedeal with this in two parts, so I'll make a new eclib spkg (if that is what they are still called) and make the code changes to saturation at the same time.

Incidentally, Sage has its own implementation of the same underlying algorithm for elliptic curves over number fields, as as well as all the above, there should be a parameter called 'implementation' which could be either 'sage' or 'eclib' (or 'pari' before long).

Here's the updated `eclib` version `v20210310` (see tarball link above) together with the necessary changes to the interface in `src/sage/libs/eclib`, and also a much simplified (and improved) `saturation()` method in `sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_rational_field`.

This was a symbiotic procedure, in the sense that as I modified the interface code and tested, I found issues which had to be fixed on the `eclib` side.

The main changes for `eclib` are:  various efficiency improvements in the sieve used to p-saturation for an individual prime p;  much better division of a point by p (when it is p times a smaller point), by default using division polynomials instead of floating point methods, though I did also improve the f.p. approach to set the precision appropriately (instead of just relying on the user to do so) which fixed the immediate hard cases I had;  reducing the saturation index bound when the subgroup is enlarged.  I also made some improvements to the construction of a newform from an elliptic curve which will avoid the normalisation problems with modular symbols (which I had already fixed on the Sage side, but this is more robust).

I will post here some elliptic curves whose saturation is now faster and/or better.  There are plenty of examples in the old doctests, but the really hard cases are not very suitable for doctests as they involve hundreds (or thousands) of digits, or take 15 minutes.

An example where the point P is 3*Q but E.saturation([P]) used to fail.

In Sage 9.2:

```
E = EllipticCurve([0, 1, 0, -3532341, 2671895459])
Q = E([188751344014/116704809 , 43530702836852015/1260762051627])
P = 3*Q
E.saturation([P]) # fails
```

even after `mwrank_set_precision(2000)`, which is slow.  But with the new version (and no precision adjustment necessary, as the new method is exact):

```
sage: E.saturation([P])                                                                                                                               
([(188751344014/116704809 : 43530702836852015/1260762051627 : 1)],
 3,
 22.2351273597058)
```

and this is instantaneous.

An example you will probably not want to run to completion:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve([0,1,1,-9872,374262])                                                                                                         
sage: pts = E.gens(sat_bound=0)                                                                                                                       
sage: pts                                                                                                                                             
[(-88 : 754 : 1), (-42 : 846 : 1), (-25 : 778 : 1), (57 : -1 : 1)]
sage: %time E.saturation(pts, verbose=True)
```

Under 9.2 it reports that the saturation index bound is 86682 but that it will not go past 10000 -- you can override this if you want, but even going up to 10000 takes a long time.  With the new code, it does not reduce the bound (since the default is supposed to be that it goes all the way up to the bound necessary to prove saturation) and takes about 15 minutes.

I added the line (literally)

to build/pkgs/eclib/checksums.ini and then did 
./sage --package fix-checksum eclib
though the response was
Checksum of eclib (tarball eclib-20210310.tar.bz2) unchanged

I'll update the branch in a minute, but I suspect that Sage will not like the fact that the upstream tarball (which is a tar.gz file created by github) is not the same as the tarball I put into upstream/ (and in the link on this ticket) which was created using make dist-bzip2.

If they need to be identical then I'll replace the actual tarball and then the checksum really will change.

The developers guide instructions are not at all clear.  For example, I had assumed that one was suppose to replace the string 'VERSION' with the actual version number.  Or is it supposed to be literally the string 'VERSION' which will be replaced by the content of the file package-version.txt?  If that is the case I'll need to make another adjustment.

You should use a configured tarball (created by `make dist`, typically. It would have `./configure` script then ready), not the raw [GitHub](GitHub) tarball, in `upstream_url=` field of `checksums.ini`.

Then `./sage -f` should go through.

Is this a non-backward compatible change in Sage's interface to eclib (many distros have versions of eclibs available, and they are used by default).
If so, we also need to modify `build/pkgs/eclib/spkg-configure.m4` to take this into account. 

A quick fix would be to assume that pkg-config will now work with eclib, simpifying  build/pkgs/eclib/spkg-configure.m4 a lot.

`pkg-config` is standard, distros that don't use it consistently have only themselves to blame.
With `pkg-config`, it's as simple as with `fplll`, say, see
https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/develop/build/pkgs/fplll/spkg-configure.m4

Probably the separate check for `mwrank` should be kept, though. Can you add `--version` and/or `-v` option to `mwrank`, so that `mwrank -v` prints its version (make it equal to 
the `eclib` version) and exits?

Theoretically, there could be a situation that versions of mwrank and eclib are not the same on the system, so `mwrank -v` will allow to check for this consistency.

Say, one installs `mwrank` using an old eclib in `/usr/local/bin`, and has it shadow the new one `mwrank` in `/usr/bin`. We see such fun not quite bugs creeping up once in a while. 

Comparing versions of eclib and mwrank is an extra check that won't hurt. `pkg-config` is useful in Python, as there is a Python interface to it (already used in Sage quite a bit
to simplify the dread of getting the right libraries etc).

this is correct. Also, Sage is still on flint 2.6.3, see #31069

Pari upgrade to 2.13 is not yet done, see #30906 - needs review.

I don't recall right away, there was a problematic Pari 2.12 release, perhaps something from there needed to be backported...

Hmm, if you already have mpir/gmp installed in your Sage install, then ./configure will assume you want to keep it (and thus everything that depends upon it will be built).


```
make gmp-clean mpir-clean

I have nbot yet managed to push my branch, but I'll try again only after merging your fix for the mp4.

My version numbers did not use to have the v in them, I added that yesterday for some reason.  I will revert that -- I think it was because my tag did have the v, so th tarball github creates has the v, an I thought I would be linking to that -- but we are not.  This will require a fresh tarball, but that will not take long.

The configure tests I have been running are on a fresh download from trac, not an existing build, so *nothing* has been built in it yet!  eclib itself detects gmp, and when I run ldd on my latest version of the shared libec library I see

```
libgmp.so.10 => /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgmp.so.10 (0x00007f23ee737000)
```

so I don't know why Sage's configure does not find it.  I do build mpir in its gmp-compat mode, so as well as the system library as above, in /usr/local/lib I have both libmpir and libgmp both installed when I do 'make install' on mpir.

gmp is a build dependency of gcc, so not too bizzare.

I think it *is* bizarre since I reinstalled the system gmp and gcc and after that gcc did not work, while after reinstalling my own mpir build gcc does work.

I don't know exactly what that means or how to fix it.

The only reason I am in this  mess is that I was trying to improve Sage for Sage users by improving eclib (no-one else uses it).  I have now spent several days on all this package installation nonsense, which used to be very simple but is now in some in-between state where things only half work.  And now I cannot even push my branch to trac for some other stupid reason.  I did push it to my github fork https://github.com/JohnCremona/sage/tree/31443-eclib-saturation

but I have had enough of all this.  I may come back to it next week, but I have others things to do.

remove these `git://` things - you are not using `ssh` while pushing to a `git://` URL. `git://` is a "native" git protocol that does authentication via a password, I have no idea how you actually managed to push from this machine earlier. That is, run

I don't know either, I've never seen this before --- I only know that your gcc toolchain is messed up (and this doesn't have much to do with Sage). It might be as simple as looging out and back in, or perhaps a reboot, bit it really no Sage's fault.

which this is not Sage's fault (other that Sage messes up with MPIR for far too long :-)).


I think your packages is in a good shape, I will finish up the branch and put it up for review.

this is fine - git:// works for fetch, this does not need authentication,

There is also a possible middle ground - you could set an upper bound as well such as `<= 20231231`. 

Does the new version of `eclib` work with old version of Sage?

By the way, about eclib's 3 dependencies:  

- NTL is vital, used in many ways throughout.  

- FLINT is optional -- eclib can be configured and built without it, though I am not sure when I tested that.  The only difference would be in the speed of certain parts of linear algebra mod p which are used by Sage only in some modular symbols code.  That would still work without the FLINT use but larger examples (large enough to take hours anyway) would be slower.  It will be easy to write that using NTL instead, which I will do and if the performance is no worse than using FLINT then I will consider removing the FLINT version and hance that dependency.

- pari could be made optional, though there seems little point in  that. Until version 20190909, the only difference would have been that without it integer factorization would only use trial division.  Since the 2021 releases eclib also uses libpari's ellap function for point-counting on elliptic curves mod p.

Github makes a tarball whenever one makes a release, and it is at https://github.com/JohnCremona/eclib/releases/tag/20210318
but I don't think that it is identical in content to what one gets from autotools "make dist".  I would certainly prefer to having the tarball there instead of making a separate one and putting it on my own web page.

In the example I mentioned above (Comment 3) the bound is no longer ~86000 but ony ~11800, taking the time to saturate that example down from 15 minutes (which was many hours before I started) to under a minute.

What this means is that is that there will be yet another eclib release soon (I am hoping for tomorrow), so I am quite relaxed about whether this version gets into 9.3, despite having a positive review a week ago.

Replying to [comment:104 dimpase]:

Thanks, Dima.  If you ever feel like helping me set up [GitHub](GitHub) actions for eclib, that would be good. I have been using Travis.

There is nothing special about the one example which triggers that error on 32-bit machines, and I will just change it to a smaller one.  This version of eclib contains may improvements to the code for saturation so it was tempting to put in a non-trivial example in this doctest but it is not necessary.

> Thanks -- and you are right, that error cannot have anything to do with eclib.  Though I wrote that function and test -- it uses pari.  Probably a good idea to sort the result of this method (which just calls a more general one which returns an iterator).

it is not just sorting - the sets are not the same!

I will look at that but I hope we will not have to reopen this ticket. The code has passed with both gcc and clang using github-actions.

The Point_comparer is used to sort lists of torsion points (finite order) and uses the point's order as the first comparator, but calling order(P) has a side-effect of caching the order in P if it was not already there, so cannot be called on a const point.  Of course I could use copies within the comparer.

Would this change get around the issue?

Thanks, this patch fixes it. I have opened #32101 - I would just put this in as a patch.

Yes, `ubuntu-trusty` is ancient and we will likely drop support for it at some point (a recent discussion appeared in #32074).
