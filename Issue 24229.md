# Issue 24229: Fix widget.descriprion

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24466

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2018-01-03 16:14:45

There is an obvious typo in the code:

```
widget.descriprion = abbrev[0]
```


This also indicates that a doctest is missing.
