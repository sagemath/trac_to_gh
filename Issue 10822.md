I think this should probably be closed as a non-issue since we don't want to diverge from Python on this point.  Python3 will make this a syntax error even for the `07` case.

I agree. Close as invalid. The leading zero for octal is a potential pitfall, but then thats Python for you. Luckily upstream saw the light and deprecated it. For the record, use `0o1234567` to enter octal numbers nowadays.

Close as invalid.
