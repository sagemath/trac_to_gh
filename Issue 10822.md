sage: 07
7
sage: 08
------------------------------------------------------------
   File "<ipython console>", line 1
     Integer(08)
              ^
SyntaxError: invalid token
```

This is Python's old syntax of entering an integer in octal format which has been deprecated.  See http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3127/ for more info.

I think this should probably be closed as a non-issue since we don't want to diverge from Python on this point.  Python3 will make this a syntax error even for the `07` case.

I agree. Close as invalid. The leading zero for octal is a potential pitfall, but then thats Python for you. Luckily upstream saw the light and deprecated it. For the record, use `0o1234567` to enter octal numbers nowadays.

Close as invalid.
