CC:  vivianepons

and they were.. But now:


```
sage: hash(TamariIntervalPosets(4)[0])
TypeError: <class 'sage.combinat.interval_posets.TamariIntervalPosets_all_with_category.element_class'> is not hashable
```

In what way? I think your doctest is bad because posets are `UniqueRepresentation`s, so, IIRC, the hash is the ID of the object. I think you should have a test like

```
sage: hash(TamariIntervalPosets(4)[0]) == hash(TamariIntervalPosets(4)[0])
True
```
