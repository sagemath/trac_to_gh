In what way? I think your doctest is bad because posets are `UniqueRepresentation`s, so, IIRC, the hash is the ID of the object. I think you should have a test like

```
sage: hash(TamariIntervalPosets(4)[0]) == hash(TamariIntervalPosets(4)[0])
True
```

damned, this is not working at all, unless there is no cover relations, which is the chosen example !!!
